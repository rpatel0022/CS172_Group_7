Set\u00a0Instant\u00a0Pot or Cooker to SEAR function (or use a pan on the stove over medium heat of you wish). Saut\u00e9 the bacon in 1 tablespoon of oil until crisp and browned. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n2. Pat dry beef with paper towel; sear in batches until browned on all sides in the oil/bacon fat.\u00a0\n3. Return bacon to the pot. Season with 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4  teaspoon ground pepper. Sprinkle with flour, toss well and cook on SEAR  for a further 4-5 minutes\u00a0to brown.\n4. Add in the onions, pearl onions, carrots, wine, 2 cups of stock,  tomato paste, 4 cloves minced garlic, bullion\u00a0and herbs. Stir well,  cover and lock the lid into place.\u00a0Press\u00a0Keep Warm/Cancel to stop the  Saut\u00e9 function, then set to MANUAL mode. Choose HIGH PRESSURE for 30  minutes cook time.\u00a0\n5. After cooking, allow the pressure to release naturally for 8-10  minutes. Open the valve and allow and remaining steam to escape (for  Instant Pot,\u00a0turn the valve from sealing to venting to release the  pressure).\n6. While steam is releasing, *prepare your buttered mushrooms\u00a0(OPTIONAL -- or add them straight in without cooking in butter if desired):*\u00a0Heat  the butter in a medium-sized skillet/pan over medium heat. Add the  remaining 2 cloves garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds),  then add in the mushrooms. Cook for about 5 minutes, while shaking the  pan occasionally to coat with the butter. Season with salt and pepper,  if desired. Set aside.\n7. Change the Instant Pot or cooker setting back to the SEAR setting (or  SAUTE) stir well and allow the sauce to thicken uncovered, for a  further 5-10 minutes.\u00a0\n8. Add the buttered mushrooms, garnish with parsley and serve with mashed potatoes, rice or noodles.  \n  \n\n**SLOW COOKER BEEF\u00a0BOURGUIGNON:** \n\n1. In a large pan or skillet, saut\u00e9 the bacon over medium heat in 1  tablespoon of oil for about 3 minutes, until crisp and browned. Transfer  to 6 quart (litre) slow cooker bowl. \n2. Pat dry beef with paper towel; sear in batches\u00a0until browned on all  sides in the oil/bacon fat. Transfer to slow cooker bowl with the bacon,  and add in the onions (both types) and carrots. Season with 1/2  teaspoon coarse salt and 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper, tossing well to  combine.\n3. Pour the red wine into the pan or skillet and allow to simmer for 4-5  minutes, then whisk in the flour until free from lumps. Allow to reduce  and thicken slightly, then pour it into the slow cooker along with 2  cups of stock,\u00a0tomato paste, garlic, bullion\u00a0and herbs.\n4. Mix well to combine all of the ingredients. Cook on high heat setting  for 6 hours or low for 8 hours, or until beef is falling apart and  tender.\n5. *In the last 5 minutes of cooking time, prepare your mushrooms:*\u00a0Heat  the butter in a medium-sized skillet/pan over medium heat. Add the  remaining 2 cloves garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds),  then add in the mushrooms. Cook for about 5 minutes, while shaking the  pan occasionally to coat with the butter.

Slice  the smoked sausage into medallions. Add the olive oil and sliced  sausage to the multi-function pressure cooker or a skillet and saut\u00e9 the  sausage until it is brown on both sides (about 5 minutes). Once the  sausage is well browned, remove it from the pot with a slotted spoon.\n2. While  the sausage is browning, finely dice the onion, bell pepper, and  celery, and mince the garlic. After removing the sausage, add the onion,  bell pepper, celery, and garlic to the pot and continue to saut\u00e9 for  another five minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent. The  moisture from the vegetables should dissolve the browned bits off the  bottom of the pot.\n3. Rinse  and sort through the beans to remove any bad beans or debris. Add the  beans to the pot along with the cooked sausage, thyme, oregano, paprika,  cayenne, some freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper  mill), chicken broth, and water. Stir to combine.\n4. Secure  the lid on the pressure cooker and close the vent. Cook on high  pressure for 35 minutes (either use the manual button or bean/chili  button on the Instant Pot and increase time to 35 minutes), then let the  pot naturally release pressure as it cools. Test the beans to make sure  they're extremely soft. If they're not soft yet, re-secure the lid,  close the vent, and cook for an additional 20 minutes on high power.\n5. Once  the beans are very soft, stir and smash the beans agains the side of  the pot with the back of a large spoon until the liquid thickens. Taste  and add salt as needed (start with a teaspoon and add more until the  flavors pop).\n6.

{"title": "I found research on NEGATIVE effects of pressure cooking on nutrition ...", "selftext": "\u2026and here\u2019s is why I\u2019m not going to write an article about it.\n\n\nI recently found a really promising research paper that tested THIRTEEN different frozen vegetables for nutrition after boiling, pressure cooking, steaming and microwaving. Whenever I find a research paper before bearing down and reading it I always look at the data tables. Initially, I was so excited to find this jackpot of nutritional data on comparing different cooking methods on so many vegetables. \n\n\nAs I went through one vegetable after another, pressure cooking was either worse than or slightly better than boiling and retained VERY LITTLE folates, carotenoids, and vitamin C compared to non-pressure steaming and microwaving. \n\n\nWhat?!?! \n\n\nI was confused because this data went against EVERYTHING else I\u2019d found so far \u2013 if true it would completely turn one of the values of pressure cooking on its head. But, it didn\u2019t take me long to find a BIG FLAW in the data. \n\n\nAt the beginning of a paper, the researchers detail what equipment they used and how they measured the data. And that\u2019s where something jumped out at me right away. For Boiling, Steaming and Microwaving the researchers instantly froze the cooked vegetable in liquid nitrogen for storage until they could measure the nutrient levels. BUT, the pressure cooked vegetables were thrown in an ice-water bath for 5 minutes first and THEN dipped in liquid nitrogen. \n\n\nHmm\u2026. so how could this small alteration affect the results?\n\n\nWell, I kept searching and found out that folates, carotenoids, and vitamin C are all WATER SOLUBLE. That means, they dissolve in water.\n\n\nSo, it is feasible that the pressure cooked vegetables lost additional nutrients in the ice water bath compared to all of the other cooking methods. So basically, the data on the pressure cooked vegetables is totally useless and cannot be compared to vegetables with other cooking methods that WERE NOT thrown in an ice bath for 5 minutes. \n\n\nI have contacted the lead researcher to ask if they also measured the nutrients in the ice water \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard back from them but I think it is unlikely since they did not state doing it in the paper. \n\n\nI\u2019m just putting this out there, in case anyone else stumbles on this research either thinking they found a GOTCHA and in the interest of full disclosure! If Dr. Bureau answers my query, I\u2019ll share her response in the Hip Pressure Cooking forums (where I originally posted this text). Ciao, L \n\n\nCitation: \n&nbsp;Bureau, S., Mouhoubi, S., Touloumet, L., Garcia, C., Moreau, F., B\u00e9douet, V., & Renard, C. M. (2015). Are folates, carotenoids and vitamin C affected by cooking? Four domestic procedures are compared on a large diversity of frozen vegetables.

I did read the article and it didn't say why they were treated different than the other vegetables. I also wonder why that was acceptable? I've only studied social sciences but still, that's a blaringly obvious way to alter your results. \n\nI'm also curiuos why the pressure cooked vegetables were cooked out of the liquid. I know it comes down to either preference or what the recipe calls for, but most of the time my vegetables are at least partially submerged by liquid, unless they are potatoes or something that would come out soggy. AND, to add to that, I'd say more than half of my dishes in the PC include eating the liquid, so how much of any nutrient is really lost there? Compared to boiling, where a recipe tends to call for straining and dumping the liquid the vegetables were boiled in. \n\nI couldn't sleep last night, and now I'm sitting here at 7 am reviewing a study of pressure cookers. Thanks OP!", "If they didn't use the same methodology, the entire thing can be tossed.  \n\nI skimmed over it briefly and a couple other things stand out too.  For example, they salted the cooking water at \"around 10g/L\". So the salinity of their cooking medium is yet another independent variable that's basically unaccounted for.  That's just bad science.  I'm surprised it was published, actually. \n\n", "Good find, thanks for sharing.", "Here's the statement in the study about how the vegetables where handled before analysis.\n\n\"Just after cooking, vegetables were drained, chilled in an ice water bath during five minutes, drained, stabilized by freezing in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C until analysis.\"\n\nLaura thinks that this -> \"chilled in an ice water bath during five minutes, drained\" is the flaw in the study that invalidates it entirely.\n\nEven though the researchers should have used a consistent methodology for all the cooking methods, **the ice water bath is not likely to be the cause of the nutritional losses that were measured**.   Have any of you used an ice water bath (cold bain marie) to cool down vegetables?  Have you observed any obvious visual indications of significant leaching of nutrients into the freezing cold water?   In simpler terms, does the ice water look like soupy water after cooling.   My experience is definitely NOT.  The water remains very clear.    In fact, the ice water bath probably helped to reduce further nutritional losses by arresting the cooking process.  That's why we use cold bain maries - to stop the cooking and to preserve texture, flavor, and nutrition.  Most experienced cooks know this.  It's how we ensure that blanching and par-boiling doesn't become full-cooking.\n\nNow compare the water left in the pot after boiling or pressure cooking vegetables.  Is the water clear afterwards?  Far from it.  It will be cloudy with the nutrients leeched from the vegetables (unless the vegetables are in a separate bowl to hold the liquids separately).   That's natural because this is the same cooking method as to make soup.  The whole point of soup is to intentionally leech nutrients and flavor from the ingredients into the water.   Of course nutrients will be lost from the vegetables.  But that doesn't mean they are lost from the soup so long as the liquid from the boiling or pressure cooking is consumed along with the vegetables.  If you discard the cooking liquid from the nutritional evaluation, then you're (1) intentionally wasting the nutrients or (2) you're an idiot who can't observe that the soup you're discarding has nutrients that were extracted from the vegetables.   Any study such as this that discards the cooking liquid from nutritional evaluation is being conducted by morons or fraudsters.\n\nThe REAL problems with the study are elsewhere.  The loss of nutrients is FAR MORE OBVIOUS:   \"Just after cooking, **vegetables were drained**\"\n\nThat's where a lot of nutrients were lost.  I can guarantee that liquid looked like soup.  The researchers are morons to not realize that a study measuring nutrient loss should keep close track of what happens to all of the nutrients.   Discarding the cooking water of veggies is violating Nutrition 101:   Don't boil veggies and throw away the water or you will obviously losing a lot of the nutrition.   You're making soup and then throwing away the soup.\n\nWhether nutrients were lost from the vegetables during cooking or not isn't even the proper question to be ask.  There are many better questions to ask.   One question is what are the best ways to cook food to preserve nutrition, and this study didn't really answer that question due to a different kind of flawed methodology.\n\nThe researchers apparently didn't pressure cook the vegetables properly to retain maximum nutrition, or at least they provided far too little evidence that they knew how to do so.\n\nIn order for pressure cooking to be effective at preserving nutrients, a very important rule is to minimize the TOTAL cooking time to the least that is necessary for the desired texture of the vegetable being cooked.   The other problems with this study appear to be that they dramatically and excessively overcooked the vegetables using ALL the cooking methods, but particularly with the pressure cooker.   They didn't specify the exact model number and size of pressure cooker that they used.     However, they did specify that the \"time of cooking given in Table 1 corresponded to the time after the first issue of vapor.\"    This means that they did NOT measure or at least report the TOTAL cooking time from the point heat was applied to the time of pressure release, draining, and soaking in the bain marie.   \n\nThey didn't report the size of the pressure cooker.  It looks like they used an 8 liter or perhaps 6 liter model.   They were only cooking 500g of vegetables, which is about 1lbs.   The proper size of pressure cooker to reduce nutrition loss is 2 liters.   The smallest pressure should be used that can fit the ingredients without overfilling the liquid above the appropriate safe level in the cooker.  Using the smallest cooker will minimize the TOTAL cooking time by greatly reducing the time required for it to come up to full pressure.   \n\nThey were also using **frozen vegetables** which more greatly impacts the proper cooking time of a pressure cooker MORE than all the other cooking methods because of many more variable that affect the timing, such as the amount of heat applied and the time required to get up to full pressure.   Cooking is occurring during this pressure build-up time that went completely unreported.\n\nTherefore, all of the cooking times for the pressure cooker method reported in the table should be considered invalid and are a gross underestimate of the actual cooking time that the vegetables experience in that method.\n\nThe study also did not provide any valid evidence to support whether the cooking times that were used for all methods were the best to achieve the minimum nutritional loss while achieving the desired level of doneness using objective measures.\n\nThe study merely states that they were \"following the recommendations indicated on the packaging by Toupargel, and following the instructions for use of the steamer (see x 2.2.3), of the pressure cooker, and of the microwave-oven. The frozen vegetables were ready to use, without thawing.\"\n\nBut there is no evidence that Toupargel and the individual instructions on the cooking devices ended up with the minimal cooking required to preserve nutrition properly according to each method.  If anything, the actual total cooking times for the pressure cooker were far too long and misrepresented by only reporting the time after pressure was released from the cooker, which they said was \"the time after the first issue of vapor.\"   Who knows what that means or how long it took to get to that point?   Was it just a little vapor?  Or was it a full pressure release by the safety valve?  The difference in timing can be huge.\n\ntl;dr:   The study should be considered invalid due to poor methodology, insufficient reporting of the true cooking process used for the pressure cooker, and because the veggie liquid was drained and discarded, which was not done with the steaming and microwave methods.  The use of an ice water bath for the pressure cooker method does reveal poor methodology, but it's unlikely to be a significant or primary cause of the differences measured in the nutritional content.", "I appreciate how /u/pazzaglia1 monitors research. Thanks for the info\n\n", "Wow, how unethical of them.  That paper should be redacted.", "It's well known that the micronutrients you've mentioned are fairly temperature sensitive. Cooking at high temperatures or for extended periods denatures these readily. As pressure cooking involves higher temperatures than can be achieved by boiling at atmospheric pressure, you would accordingly expect lower concentrations of these compared with boiling when cooking for the same amount of time. The same applies to steaming. For other methods such as sauteing or frying, the temperature and length of cooking time make it so that often the center of the vegetable does not achieve a very high temperature for very long, at least when compared with pressure cooking. So in the end, yes, pressure cooking will, as a result of cooking at high temperatures, result in lower concentrations of temperature-sensitive micronutrients. Of course this comparison will not hold for all the other non-temperature-sensitive micronutrients.", "[removed]", "U went ham"]}

If your brisket is too large to sit flat on the bottom of your pressure cooker, cut it into pieces that will fit. Season brisket all over with salt and pepper. In an electric multi-cooker (such as an Instant Pot), set to searing mode or a stovetop pressure cooker set over medium-high heat, add oil and heat until shimmering.\n2.  Working in batches, add brisket, and brown on both sides, about 6 minutes per side (the exact browning time will depend on your pressure cooker model; electric ones will generally take quite a bit longer than stovetop ones). Transfer brisket to platter or rimmed baking sheet, and set aside.\n3. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons additional oil, as needed, if pot has gone dry. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, and season with salt. Cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits, until onions are very soft and any released juices have thickened into a glaze, 25-35 minutes (the exact cooking time will again depend on the type of cooker you're using, with electric ones taking quite a bit longer); reduce heat at any point if vegetables threaten to scorch. The vegetables should have reduced significantly in volume by this time.\n4. Stir in ketchup and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until thick, about 3 minutes. Add wine and cook until raw alcohol smell has cooked off, about 3 minutes.\n5. Add thyme and bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low or turn off searing mode on electric multi-cooker. Give the vegetables a good stir, scraping the bottom well all over (this will be your last chance to stir before closing the cooker); if vegetables are very dry, stir in 1/2 cup water to moisten. Add brisket pieces, nestling them well in the vegetables, and add any accumulated juices. \n6. Seal pressure cooker and bring to high pressure over medium heat or using the pressure-cooking mode of an electric multi-cooker. Cook for at least 1 hour at high pressure and up to 1 hour 30 minutes. Choose 1 hour if your brisket pieces are closer to 1 inch thick, or if they're thicker but you want a little more chew to the meat; choose 1 hour 30 minutes if your brisket is closer to 2 inches thick, and you want it more tender.\n7. Rapidly release pressure cooker or allow to release naturally, then open. Transfer brisket pieces to a work surface, and let rest until cool enough to handle. Taste braising liquid and season with salt, if necessary. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves, and skim off any excess fat if it's there (this will depend on the cut of brisket). \n8. If the braising liquid is a little too watery, you can reduce it at this point by simmering it uncovered until it thickens slightly (in some electric multi-cookers, you may need to use the saut\u00e9 or similar function)\n9.

Add the pasta  into the pot after the soup has pressure cooked and turn the pot to the  saute setting. The pasta will cook in about 10 minutes. Stir often so it  doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom of the pot. \n7. **Way 3**\u2013Boil on  stove.\u00a0 Bring water to boil on the stove. Add the orzo pasta.

I do a full pot (2lbs of dry beans) about once a month and put it all in the freezer. A few things I do differently.\n\nBrine your beans the night before. Soak your beans covered in cold water with a couple tablespoons of salt. Fewer beans will blow out and they will have a creamier texture.\n\nI save the sausage till later. Render several slices of choped bacon and sautee your vegetables in that; gives a great smokieness. I use red bell peppers, green ones have a musky flavor I dislike. Up the garlic to your preference. I'll easily use 7-10 cloves.  I personalities prefer to no use the dried thyme oregano, and paprika, but to each their own. A couple bay leaves and Cheyenne pepper is a must. If you can find smoked ham hocks, I use two. Like the bacon, it really ups the flavor.\n\nI throw in 2 quarts of chicken stock and add just enough water to barely reach the top beans. There's almost no water loss in the pressure cooker and it's really easy to add too much water. Cooking 2lbs of dry beans, my Perfect time is 40 minutes under pressure and a 20 minute natural release. DO NOT QUICK RELEASE. Quick release and a lot of your beans will explode. Discard the Bay leaves and ham hocks. You can try picking meat from the hocks, but there's a lot of fat, cartilage, and bone to get out. I don't. \n\nNow for the sausage. I find cutting rounds  leads to too large of pieces and they break down too much. Instead I quarter links down the length creating triangular sticks. I broil them until very well carmalized and brown. Then them cool a tad, cut down to bite size pieces, and add. You've removed a bit of the oil that tends to sit on top, have nice chunky pieces, and the crispy skin adds a great texture.\n\nSalt well (more than what seems reasonable) and add a few dashes of hot sauce.

Aborio rice  requires 2 or sometimes 2 1/2 cups of liquid per 1 cup rice. Different  kinds of rice also require different cooking times. For example, brown  rice takes 15 mins of pressure cooking.

The result was a perfectly smooth and creamy, and not overly sweet, flan with a beautiful caramel sauce.\n\nI used this [cake pan](http://a.co/5mbrKCe) in my IP Duo 6qt.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- 1 cup sugar (divided into 2 portions)\n\n- 1 cup table cream / heavy cream\n\n- 2 cups milk \n\n- 6 whole eggs\n\n- 1.5 tsp vanilla extract\n\n- 0.5 tsp grated orange peel (optional)\n\n- 0.25 tsp cinnamon (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Add 1/2 cup of sugar to heavy-bottomed, medium-sized sauce pan, set heat to medium-low. Let sugar liquify and caramelize to a deep amber without stirring too much.\n\n2. When sugar has caramelized, quickly pour into cake pan and swirl around to cover the bottom and the sides of the pan as much as you can before it solidifies. Put pan aside.\n\n3. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar, cream, milk, vanilla, cinnamon and orange peel to the sauce pan you used for for the caramel and set heat to medium-high. Whisk and allow to heat and deglaze the remaining caramel into the milk mixture. \n\n4. When milk mixture is heated (but not boiling), add to blender. Carefully start your blender, keeping the steam release hole open and gently covered with a piece of paper towel and hold it in place wearing an oven mitt. Hot liquids in blenders can be dangerous.\n\n5. While blender is running, slowly pour in your eggs into the blender. Blend for 10 seconds, then stop.\n\n6. Pour your custard mixture through a fine mesh sieve then pour into your cake pan. Give it a few good taps on the counter-top to remove bubbles.\n\n7. Tent tinfoil over the cake pan, then place on trivet. Add 1 cup of water to IP inner pot, then place trivet and foiled cake pan inside.\n\n8. Use Manual to set High Pressure for 15 minutes. Natural release after 10 minutes.\n\n9. Let flan rest 15 minutes covered on the countertop, then transfer to fridge to completely chill (preferably overnight).\n\n10.

The soup can be refrigerated  for up to 4 days.\n\n**Notes**\n\n1. If using frozen corn, make sure the corn is thawed. If using canned  corn, drain and rinse the corn before adding it to the chowder\n2. If you cut the potatoes in advance, soak them in cold water to keep  them from browning. Just drain the water before adding them to the  chowder\n3. The soup thickens up when refrigerated, so add a little broth of water while re-heating\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nServing Size: 1 Bowl\n\nCalories Per Serving:                 **397**\n\n## % Daily Value\n\nTotal Fat *19.2g*  30%\n\nCholesterol *80.3mg*    27%\n\nSodium *620.8mg*   26%\n\nTotal Carbohydrate *38.8g*   13%\n\nSugars *8.7g*\n\nProtein *20.5g*   41%\n\nVitamin A *162.9\u00b5g*    11%\n\nVitamin C *22.7mg*        38%", "Where is the recipe?", "I really like your bowls.", "I've made this exact recipe several times.

Sear the chuck roast in the bottom of a pressure cooker until well-browned, then remove and set aside. \n\n2. Add the beef broth and powdered gelatin,then bring to a boil and reduce until the broth is reduced to a sticky glaze (don\u2019t let it burn). \n\n3. Season the reduced beef broth with plenty of black pepper and then add the ranch powder and A1 sauce (you can add more or less A1 to taste). It\u2019s kind of shocking how well these seasonings work in the final dish, the flavors end up very savory and balanced.\n\n4. Add the onions and beef back to the pressure cooker, bring to full-pressure and cook for 90 minutes. \n\n5. Depressurize, and add the potatoes and carrots, and bring back to full pressure for another 8 minutes. \n\n6. Depressurize, add the celery and then just cover with the lid for about 2 minutes while you chop some parsley.\n\n7. Add a lot of chopped parsley to garnish, it helps balance the richness of the dish. \n\nNote: There\u2019s a really good video on ChefSteps YouTube channel showing the technique, which I\u2019ve modified to simplify the steps.

Turn  the instant pot to saut\u00e9. When it's hot add ghee, cumin, cloves,  cinnamon, peppercorns and stir to flavor the ghee. Allow them to sizzle  for 30 seconds.

When the cooking  time is over allow the pot to rest undisturbed for 10 minutes. Then  release all remaining pressure.\n6. Using a very light, hand mix the peas carrots and rice together and tip into a large serving dish to serve.\n7. Make  sure you don't bite directly into any of the whole spices!

You can use Garam Masala if you'd like, and  in doing so you'll save yourself the extra effort of having to eat  around the whole spices, but it really is *that* much better when  you use whole spices. The spices flavor the rice around it and the  water in a gentle fashion, with different tastes in different bites.\n9. If you decide to use Garam Masala instead of the whole spices, I highly recommend you make it yourself. \n10. You can sub any other frozen veggie that you'd like.\n11. You can add paneer for protein if you'd like.\n12. Typically  for 2 cups of rice, you'd only use 1.75 cups of water. But in this  case, we're using two cups of water to account for steaming the  additional vegetables.\n\n**Garam Masala Recipe**\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Place  a small skillet over medium heat and add all the ingredients. Toast  them until they\u2019re fragrant but not browned, about 2 to 3 minutes.

Transfer the spices to a plate or a paper towel to cool completely.\u00a0Once cool, place the spices in a coffee or spice grinder. Grind until the spices form a medium-fine powder.\n3. Stop the grinder several times and shake it so all the spices get under the blades and grind more evenly.\u00a0When  you\u2019re finished, unplug the grinder. Holding the lid in place, turn the  grinder upside down and shake the spice mixture into the lid.\n4. Pour the garam masala into a small jar with a tight-fitting lid.

Grab  your chicken thighs and sprinkle \u00be teaspoons kosher salt all over them.  You can do this part up to two days in advance, and keep the chicken  covered in the fridge.\n2. Press the \"Saut\u00e9\" button on the Instant Pot or heat a stovetop pressure cooker over medium heat. Add your fat of choice.\n3. When the fat is shimmering, add the onions, carrots, and mushrooms, and a \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt.\n4. Saut\u00e9 the vegetables until the softened, about 3 to 5 minutes.\n5. Stir in the garlic and tomato paste, and cook for about 30 seconds or until fragrant.\n6. Add the salted chicken, cherry tomatoes and green olives to the pot.\u00a0Give it all a good stir.\n7. Turn off the saut\u00e9 function, and lock the lid on the pressure cooker.\n8. I  position my Instant Pot under my stovetop exhaust vent before I program  the pressure cooking so that when the chicken\u2019s done and I immediately  release the pressure, the vent will suck up all the steam. Your kitchen  cabinets will thank you. (Stick a cutting board underneath your cooker  if your stove top grates aren\u2019t even\u2014and remember not to turn on your  stove!)\n9. If  you\u2019re using an Instant Pot, press the \u201cManual\u201d or \u201cPressure Cook\u201d  button and set the cooking time to 7 minutes for chicken breasts (if  your chicken boobs are bigger than 8 ounces each, you can cut them in  half or increase the cooking time to 9 minutes) and 10 minutes for  thighs. Bone-in thighs will take 15 minutes to cook under high pressure.  (For those of you using a stove top pressure cooker, crank the heat to  high to bring the contents to high pressure. Once high pressure is  reached, reduce the heat to low, or just enough to maintain high  pressure. Set a timer for 6 minutes for breasts and 9 minutes for  thighs.)\n10. When  the chicken is finished cooking, turn on the stove top exhaust fan  before turning the pressure cooker valve to release the steam.\n11. Remove  the lid right away to prevent overcooking. Add the freshly cracked  black pepper and adjust the seasoning with additional salt as needed.\n12. If you want a thicker gravy, remove the chicken and blend up the vegetables and cooking liquid with an immersion blender.\n13. Stir in the fresh herbs, and serve immediately.\n14.

My parents are Gen X and they like it because it's easy for them to use. I don't think they asked me for help once and just consulted the manual or YouTube if they had questions. I also find it's quicker than cooking soup on the stove especially if you are doing something like Brock's no chew stew from Pokemon. It's basically a soup with chicken, broccoli, and other heavier ingredients that take a while to cook. It's a big hit among parents because they can go do other chores or tend to their kids as long as they check in on the pot instead of having to watch the stove constantly. I feel that it is also easier to keep out of reach of small children because you can move it unlike a stove or oven.

Electric pressure cookers are great for quick mac-n-cheese. Even blue box! No shame. :)\n\nFirst off though, your pressure cooker is kinda big (6 qt? 8 qt?) for the smallish amount of pasta/liquid I see. I have a couple of different sizes of PC (2-qt, 3-qt, 6-qt) and I size to the recipe/amount I'm cooking. You can't change the size of your pot though, so just be aware that if lightly filled, there's a pretty big volume of pressurized steam to release, that wants to help you repaint your kitchen.\n\nSecond: did you add cheese before pressure cooking? I add pasta, butter, water, spices, then pressure cook; then add cheeses and milk and stir for a bit on saute setting. Might work better.\n\nThird, and actually most important: almost never, just \"twist and quick release\". (Note: most everyone does this at least once, so again, no shame.) Use the tappa-tappa-tappa method -- grab a spoon, spatula, butter knife, whatev -- and use the end to gently lift the nose of the black pressure release valve from underneath, with small interval taps. Small spurts of light steam release will occur; keep tapping briefly from under and release each time just before it gets too juicy. This prevents the kitchen repaint lol.\n\nFourth: DON'T natural release pasta. A rule of thumb is half the stovetop cooking time for PC pasta (varies per type of pasta, recipe, etc.); if you natural release you've just added a bunch more minutes and you'll likely have flabby pasta. Use the tappa-tappa-tappa as described above.", "It boiled rapidly. Pressure raises boiling point. When you open the vent, pressure wants to normalize with the outside. This results in rapid and violent flash boiling since the items are way hotter than boiling temps at normal air pressure.

Really you are just boiling some flavorful pasta, but it it my favorite.", "You never boil cheese.  If you make a sauce and add the cheese and continue to heat, it will \"break\" oil will separate and curdle the sauce.  Cheese should be added off the heat and stirred to melt.  If the sauce needs heating, gentle heating is recommended but not to boiling.  \n\nA pressure cooker heats to above the boiling point, the cheese didn't stand a chance.  A cheese sauce has no place in a pressure cooker.  \n\nCooking is very much trial and error, best of luck next time!", "This is my favorite Mac and Cheese Recipe for the instant pot. I put the butter in first and then pasta and then liquid (I use chicken broth instead of water) so that the butter doesn\u2019t bubble out with the steam. I also use 2-3 spices instead of salt since there\u2019s already salt in the broth. (But the total amount being around 2-3 tsp) Usually Cumin, paprika, and garlic powder or salt. But you can have lots of fun experimenting with different seasonings/cheeses. You add heavy cream and cheese after releasing.

Discard the cooking liquid. Rinse the cooked tendons  under cold running tap water. Cut tendons into smaller pieces, then  remove some of the fat if desired**.**\n5. **\\*Pro Tip:**  Try to buy pre-cooked beef tendons to simplify the cooking process.  Both chenpi or tendons are optional. So omit if you can't find them.\n6. **Brown Beef Finger Meat:** Heat  up Instant Pot using Saut\u00e9 More function. Wait until it says HOT (\\~8  mins). Pat dry the beef finger meat. Drizzle the inner pot with 1 tbsp  peanut oil or olive oil. Then, brown 2 sides of the beef for 3 minutes  per side in Instant Pot (may have to brown in two separate batches). Set  aside browned beef.\n7. **Saute Ginger & Garlic:** Add  crushed garlic cloves, sliced ginger, chopped shallot, and white part  of green onions in Instant Pot. Saute until fragrant (\\~2 mins). While  the ginger and garlic are being sauteed, quickly cut the beef into  stew-size pieces.\n8. **Deglaze:**  Add pre-cooked tendon pieces and browned beef pieces (with all the meat  juices) in Instant Pot. Give it a few quick mixes. Pour in 1 tbsp  Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry wine/water) and completely deglaze the  bottom of the pot.\n9. **Make Chu Hou Sauce:**  Add 3 tbsp (45ml) chu hou paste, 1 tbsp (15ml) regular soy sauce, 1  tbsp (15ml) dark soy sauce, 2 tsp (12ml) oyster sauce, 3 star anises, 2  tsp (10g) rock sugar or white sugar, and a piece of chenpi in Instant  Pot. Give it a quick mix so all the ingredients are infused with the  paste. Add in daikon chunks, 1 cup (250ml) unsalted chicken stock, and a  pinch of salt. Give it another quick mix. Ensure all the beef are  partially submerged into the sauce.\n10. **Pressure Cook Chinese Beef Stew:**\n11. **Option 1 - Super Soft Daikon**:  Pressure Cook at High Pressure for 25 minutes (beef with some chew) -  32 minutes (melt-in-your-mouth beef), then 15 minutes Natural Release.\n12. **Option 2 - Perfectly Cooked Daikon**:  Pressure Cook at High Pressure for 10 minutes + Quick Release to set  aside the Daikon; then Pressure Cook at High Pressure for 12 minutes  (beef with some chew) - 18 minutes (melt-in-your-mouth beef) + 15  minutes Natural Release.\n13. **Thicken & Season:** Bring  the beef stew sauce to a simmer with the \"Saute\" button. In a small  mixing bowl, mix cornstarch with water, then mix it in one third at a  time until desired thickness. Taste and adjust seasoning by adding more  salt. For reference, we added 2 large pinches of salt in the end.\n14. **Serve:** Add beef finger meat, beef tendons, and daikon to a serving bowl. Drizzle with the yummy flavorsome chu hou sauce.

Spoiler alert, you bake it.\n\n>#The easiest way to get the stink out of silicone\nSince that initial test run, I\u2019ve made some adjustments to the technique as it was posted on Reddit. Here\u2019s what I do:\n\n\n>* Preheat the oven to 250 \u00baF. I find that a lower temperature works just as well, though it may take a little longer. Most silicone cookware I\u2019ve seen is oven-safe up to 500 \u00baF or more, and if yours is clearly labeled as such, go ahead and use a higher temperature. But because things like ice cube trays don\u2019t usually come with heat limits, I like to err on the side of caution and treat them a little more gently. So far I haven\u2019t had an issue.\n* One very important thing to check before you go any further: Make sure that whatever you\u2019re cleaning is 100 percent silicone or otherwise heatproof. Although silicone can hold up under high temperatures, it\u2019s not a good idea to stick most rubbers or plastics into the oven. Read more on this in \u201cSome important precautions\u201d below.\n* While the oven is heating, carefully wash your silicone item with soap and hot water to make sure it\u2019s not covered in any food residue or oils that might get baked onto it in the oven.\n* Place your silicone item in the oven, either on a baking sheet or directly on an oven rack. Set a timer for 20 minutes.\n* Pull the item out of the oven and carefully take a whiff (you don\u2019t want to burn your nose!). If you detect some lingering scent, return it to the oven. I like to check every 10 minutes or so until the scent is gone, and in my experience the process shouldn\u2019t take more than 40 minutes or so. Leaving your items for longer probably won\u2019t harm them (things like a silicone loaf pan are meant to be left in the oven for an hour or more anyway), but I haven\u2019t tested baking anything for more than an hour, so proceed with caution when baking items like ice trays that aren\u2019t specifically labeled for oven use.\n\n>#Some important precautions\nBefore you go throwing a bunch of kitchenware into your oven, there are a few very important things to know:\n\n>* Most important, as mentioned above, this trick works only for items that are 100 percent silicone or otherwise extremely heatproof. Please do not put plastic ice cube trays or spatulas with plastic handles into a hot oven. The heat will ruin the tool, and maybe ruin your oven. If you\u2019re at all unsure what an item is made of, check the manufacturer\u2019s website to find out. And note that certain materials, like the rubbery handle on our favorite OXO whisk, look and feel like silicone but aren\u2019t and will melt.\n* Silicones in general are stable at high temperatures, and I haven\u2019t noticed any changes to my ice cube trays after baking them several times. But items like ice cube trays haven\u2019t necessarily been heat tested by the manufacturer. If that makes you uncomfortable, you should stick to using this technique only on items like silicone cake pans, which have been heat tested.\n* Along the same lines, if you plan to use this technique on the gasket for your Instant Pot, stick to heating it to 250 \u00baF. Other silicone accessories made by Instant Pot are heat resistant to 450 \u00baF, but the company doesn\u2019t provide those specifications for its sealing rings so it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution. The Instant Pot itself can reach temperatures as high as 242 degrees, while stovetop pressure cookers with similar gaskets (as well as the forthcoming Instant Pot Max) will get up to 250 degrees, so 250 is likely a safe temperature for the gasket. But because your Instant Pot won\u2019t build pressure properly without an intact gasket, it\u2019s important to treat it with more care than you might an ice cube tray. That being said, the gaskets on all pressure cookers eventually need to be replaced, as they wear out over time. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to get a new one when your cooker takes longer than usual to come to pressure.", "Mine smells like chicken tikka masala... I can\u2019t wait to try this. I tried soaking in dish soap and once in vinegar and nothing has helped.

I\u2019ve been wanting forward to the current series of posts for for a while currently. however before we have a tendency to dive into a full tutorial on a way to create my favorite straightforward maki rolls, we have smart effort to create dish rice. This classic vinegared (\u201csushi\u201d virtually means that \u201csour-tasting\u201d in Japanese), firm, sticky, short-grain rice is that the foundation for all dish. And, a minimum of in my opinion, it\u2019s one in every of the most factors that separates the so-so dish from the stellar dish.\n\nThe good news for America is that glorious dish rice is kind of straightforward to form reception in either a rice cooking utensil, autoclave or on the stovetop. and every one you wish to form it easily! I true go the non-traditional route and simply use a basic bowl and spatula for the rice-folding method, that could be a technique that has forever works simply fine for America. however if you'd prefer to build your dish rice the normal Japanese manner, I actually have enclosed choices below for the way to use a picket hangiri, rice paddle and a disciple to fold and funky your dish. thus pull together these basic ingredients, and allow us to build some dish rice!\n\nSUSHI RICE INGREDIENTS: To make delicious dish rice, you may want these essential dish rice ingredients: Japanese-style short-grain white rice: This unambiguously sticky, plump and firm-textured sort of rice is crucial for creating sensible dish rice! \u2661 once buying dish rice, hunt for short-grain rice that square measure either created in Japan or tagged as \u201csushi rice\u201d (some of the cheaper brands square measure currently full-grown in California). That said, quality, price, style and textures will run the gamut with dish rice, therefore if you actually wish to dial in on your favorite rice, be happy to taste-test some totally different brands to ascertain that one you like best. My favorite brands square measure Lundberg Farms, Nishiki, and Kokuho Rose.\n\nRice vinegar: A basic bottle of unseasoned rice vinegar. (You should purchase bough ten \u201csushi vinegar\u201d if you favor, that already includes the sugar and salt mixed in. however it generally includes additional additives too, therefore I like better to take the additional couple of minutes to create my very own dish vinegar by mix along unseasoned rice vinegar, sugar and salt.) Sugar: refined sugar is ancient for dish rice. however be at liberty to sub in your favorite natural sweetener if you favor. Fine ocean salt: I used fine ocean salt during this formula. therefore if you're victimization favorer, please note that you simply can got to use less salt. Kombu (optional): If you would wish to add it!\n\nHOW TO build dish RICE: After having experimented with numerous ancient and non-traditional strategies for creating dish rice, this is often the essential technique I\u2019ve landed on. the most goal here is to cook the rice hard (it ought to be firm however not crunchy) and to undertake to not mash the sticky rice as you stir it (hence the mild slicing/folding technique, rather than simply stirring in circles). sensible dish rice ought to look polished and glossy, and also the individual rice grains ought to keep fairly separated rather than being all smooshed along. however that same, but your rice seems, I assure you it'll work well in dish and be delicious!

Put a few pounds of bones and meat scraps, or a chicken or turkey carcass, a couple roughly cut onions, a few carrots and celery stalks in the cooker.  Add whatever herbs and spices you want, I like Sage and Coriander, and cook for 90 minutes at 15lb.  If you want to store it for later use, turn it into a glace.

And, in December probably preferable for those of us in northern climates.\n\nYou'll need: \n\n* a boneless pork butt (4'ish pounds is good) \n* some sort of spice rub (I've linked one below, or your own) \n* a little BBQ sauce (again, your own or store-bought)\n* a medium yellow onion\n* liquid smoke (optional, get the good stuff if you do)\n\nThen, of course, any fixings (buns, pickles, etc...). \n\nAlso, you can opt to brine the pork butt (in chunks) if you'd like...but I really don't know that it's necessary, especially if you're looking to keep things simple and quick'ish.\n\n1. If possible, trim your butts into 4-6 large'ish chunks (trim excess fat, or don't...much of it will render out, but I trim off some) \n1. Season chunks with [Memphis Dust](http://amazingribs.com/recipes/rubs_pastes_marinades_and_brines/meatheads_memphis_dust.html) or a rub of your choice, and brown in the InstantPot/PC - remove chunks once lightly browned and set aside - Memphis Dust has a good bit of sugar, so watch the chunks to avoid too much scorching\n1. Toss in a medium sliced onion (sliced pole-to-pole), and begin to deglaze the pot a bit, then add a couple of cups of water/chicken stock and scrape the bits, then about a cup of BBQ sauce (store bought or homemade) and a couple of splashes of liquid smoke (if that's your thing, not a requirement...try and find liquid smoke that is essentially just liquid and smoke, no other flavorings...you can skip this, some liquid smoke is terrible\n1. Bring up to pressure and cook for 55 minutes (some recipes call for 50, some for 60...I split the difference)\n1. Natural release (slow release, let pressure come down in its own), remove pork chunks carefully and shred - eat on sandwiches with more sauce as desired, etc, etc...\n\nOne other thing you might consider is to take the chunks/shreds and coat with some of the excess fat that cooks out and toss them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp/brown, similar to what is called for in the [Serious Eats carnitas](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/no-waste-tacos-de-carnitas-with-salsa-verde-recipe.html) recipe.\n\nUsually serve 'em one roles with sauce and some spicy quick-pickles - though you could do onions (raw, but I'd prefer lightly caramelized), or slaw...a slice of cheese if you're up for it.\n\nThat's how I've done BBQ-Style Pulled Pork in my InstantPot, never had any issues, and always tastes great. Plus, if there's just two of you you'll have plenty of leftovers and they freeze great - bonus if you freeze them in a Food Saver or the like.

Cook the rice according to the package directions. Fluff with a fork and set the pan aside.\n2. Fill a large deep pot half full of water. Bring to a boil over high heat.\n3. Remove  the core from the cabbage and place it, core side down, in the boiling  water. Cover and let the head of cabbage boil for 7-8 minutes. Remove  the softened outer leaves and place them on a plate to cool. Cover the  pan and cook the cabbage for 6-8 minutes, checking and removing the  outer leaves as they soften, placing them on the plate to cool. When you  get down to the center of the cabbage and the leaves are too small for  rolls, cover the pan and cook the cabbage until crisp-tender. When done,  remove the cabbage from the heat, coarsely chop it and set it aside.\n4. For  the sauce, melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the onion and cook  over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions start to turn  light golden brown. Add the garlic and cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir  in the tomatoes, tomato sauce, vinegar, bouillon, garlic powder, onion  powder, Worcestershire (or black) pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Mix  well, taste and adjust the seasoning. Remove from the heat. Stir in some  of the chopped cooked cabbage. Set the sauce aside.\n5. For the  filling, in a large bowl, beat the egg, then stir in the onion, garlic,  salt, pepper and cooked rice. Add the ground beef and pork and mix with a  wooden spoon or your hands until all the ingredients are well combined.\n6. Lay  one of the cabbage leaves flat on a work surface with the stem end in  front of you. Take 2 generous tablespoonfuls of the filling and place it  at the bottom of the cabbage leaf. Fold the 2 sides in and roll away  from you, making sure filling stays in the center and away from the top  edge, until you reach the top of the leaf. You can secure the roll with a  toothpick if you like. They stay together  quite well once rolled, and if they do start to unroll, they can be  easily tucked back together.\n7. Repeat this with the remaining filling and cabbage leaves. \n8. Place  the rack in the bottom of the pressure cooker. Pour in 1 cup water.  Place 7-8 cabbage rolls on the rack. Cover the rolls with about 1/3 of  the sauce. Add a second layer of rolls to the pressure cooker,  alternating the direction of the second layer. Pour the remaining sauce  over the top of the rolls. After adding the last bit of sauce, take a  plastic spatula and gently go around the outer edge of the rolls to  allow some of the sauce to drip down around the rolls. Make sure not to  overfill the pressure cooker. It's easy enough to cook these in 2  batches, if necessary.\n9. Lock the lid in place, choose High  pressure and set 18 minutes cooking time. When the beep sounds, turn off  the pressure cooker, unplug it, wait for 15 minutes, then use Quick  Pressure to release any remaining steam.\n10. Gently remove the cabbage rolls from the pressure cooker to a platter.\n11. Select \"Saut\u00e9\" and bring the sauce to a boil.\n12. In  a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and cold water until smooth  and the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir the cornstarch mixture into the  sauce and cook until thickened, stirring constantly.\n13. Serve the sauce over the cabbage rolls.\n\n\\*You can substitute all ground beef for the pork if you prefer\n\nNutrition Information:\n\n**Serving Size: 2**Amount Per Serving:\n\nCalories: 228;   Total Fat: 11g;   Saturated Fat: 5g;   Trans Fat: 0g;   Unsaturated Fat: 5g;   Cholesterol: 73mg;   Sodium: 459mg;   Carbohydrates: 11g;   Fiber: 1g;  Sugar: 5g;   Protein: 19g", "Came here for the Golumpki correction and am sadly disappointed."]}

Rub  the roast all over with the kosher salt, seasoned salt, black pepper,  dried parsley, dried thyme, dried rosemary, onion powder and garlic  powder\n2. Add the olive oil to the\u00a0Instant Pot\u00a0and hit \u201cSaut\u00e9\u201d and adjust so it\u2019s on the \u201cMore\u201d or \u201cHigh\u201d  setting. Allow the oil to heat up for 3 minutes and then sear the  seasoned roast in the oil for about 1-2 mins on each side. Remove the  roast when done searing and set aside on a plate\n3. The bottom of  the pot will likely have some spice remnants stuck on it from searing  the meat. Add in the butter and as it melts, immediately scrape/deglaze  the bottom of the pot with a wooden or plastic spoon to remove any  remnants of the spices from the roast. Add the onions and they will  release water as they cook making it easier to deglaze the bottom of the  pot. Cook for 2 minutes an then add in the garlic and Worcestershire  sauce and stir for another 2-3 minutes while deglazing. The bottom of  the pot should be nice and smooth by now with most spices no longer  stuck to it\n4. Place the trivet over the onions with the handles  facing upwards and place the roast on top of the trivet, fat-side up (so  it allows the juices to coarse through the meat as it cooks), along  with the mushrooms. Pour the wine and beef broth over everything\n5. Lastly,  securely wrap the potatoes and carrots in their own foil pouches and  place in the pot on top of the roast (make room for it and it should fit  fine as I did this in a 6qt). This will help the potatoes and carrots  retain character and texture since they won\u2019t be directly exposed to the  pressure and will be a HUGE benefit to the final results\n6. Secure  the lid and then hit \u201cPressure Cook\u201d or \u201cManual\u201d High Pressure for 60  mins. When done, allow a 15 minute natural release  (meaning you do nothing for 15 minutes) and then follow up with a quick  release\n7. Once the lid comes off, first remove the foil-covered  veggies and set aside and then carefully remove the roast using the  trivet\u2019s handles and flip it onto a cutting board. Allow to the roast  and veggies to cool a few moments\n8. Go back to the pot,\u00a0hit \u201cKeep  Warm/Cancel,\u201d\u00a0and then hit \u201cSaut\u00e9\u201d and adjust so it\u2019s on the \u201cMore\u201d or  \u201cHigh\u201d setting and bring the sauce to a bubble. Unwrap the foiled  potatoes and carrots and add/stir them into the sauce. Once the sauce  bubbles, add the cornstarch slurry and stir immediately and then add in  the gravy packet and stir. Allow to bubble for one minute and then turn  the pot off and the sauce will become something so incredible, you may  forget your name\n9. Using a good knife,  slice up the pot roast against the grain in strips about 1/4 inch thick  (or make thicker cuts if you wish). Then, cut each strip into  good-sized chunks and immediately add them into the sauce and let sit in  there for a few moments to soak it in. Make sure you toss in any  remaining little strands of meat into the sauce too and give everything a  final stir\n10.

It's frustrating because ALL other pork cuts come out perfect, ribs, pulled pork etc are phenomenal but a straight roast kept coming out tough. In fairness I resorted to the pressure cooker because I can only get them tender with a slow cooker otherwise. \n\nGet fatty cuts, too many pork roasts are cut lean and the leaner it is the harder it is to get perfect. Fat marbeling in the middle is ideal.\nUse a marinade with vinegar, I like red wine vinegar the best and white vinager is the trusty standby. You can also just add the vinager to the water/broth but I prefer to use a marinade and go a little heavy. Vinager really helps the tenderizing process.\nCut the roast, the smaller you cut the less time you cook, I cut about 2 to 3 inch wide slices before browning.\nRoast it well, with most meats I just do a quick burn on each side but with roast I found really letting it brown in oil more than normal made a difference. I usually brown it in larger chunks and cut them down or brown them slightly less when cut smaller.\nSubmerge the meat, broth, water, your own mix, whatever just get the liquid to cover the meat as much as possible. I usually cook it for 45 minutes with large pieces and 35 minutes with small pieces, I have done 1 inch slices in 20 minutes. The problem is you have to start low and slow release then if it needs more time go in 5 minute increments which can add substantial time.\n\nMy personal solution is dont use Boston butt cuts or pork loin, use lower quality shoulder cuts. They make amazing shredded pork and have more fat, cut them into large chunks and cook for 45 minutes, you can cook it for up to an hour and it just falls more apart the longer you leave it. I do 45 for roast and 60 for shredded pork on the same cuts I get cheap at the Korean grocery store.", "I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you're over cooking it. \n\nFor pork tenderloin:\n\nSet your probe thermometer for 140, and cook your loin at 350. Put the probe into the thickest part of the roast. If you don't have a probe thermometer get one. Take it out when the probe thermometer tells you it's done. Let it rest for a minimum of 5 mins (it will continue to cook while it rests). \n\nSlice 1/4 inch slices and be amazed at the tenderness. It will be slightly pink in the center  with slightly pink juices. This will not kill you. Stop over cooking your pork. \n\nTop your slices with pan juices for amazing flavor. \n\nI follow the same general recipe for other non bone-in pork roasts.  If there's a bone it's probably going in the pressure cooker or slow cooker as pulled pork.", "Are you using pork loin?  I feel like that cut will never be good in a pressure cooker -- not enough fat and connective tissue.  A pressure cooker does a bang-up job on pork shoulder, though.", "One thing I haven't seen mentioned: brine it! \n\nSoaking it in a saltwater solution for at least a few hours before cooking makes for a much moister cut of meat. You can also add cooking phosphates if you have any handy. Just make sure to rinse and wipe dry after brining.", "The usual two tricks to achieve moist and tender meat of any kind is brining and the denaturation of proteins. \n\nThe cell membranes of meats tend to cause water to flow toward higher sodium content. By presoaking  in brine overnight  at which point non saline water will flow into the cells resulting in moist meat. Most cuts of chicken are pre-brined. \n\nThe second factor is the duration and temperature of cooking.  The toughness of a meat is largely a result of collagen in the cells. Low and slow cooking breaks down the collagen into gelatin resulting in tender meats. But if the sodium gradient is negative such cooking causes water to flow out resulting in dry meat. In sous vide or barbecue  it is common to first brine the meats and then cook at relatively low temperatures for ridiculously long times (12-72 hours). The temperatures in a Instant pot are higher so the process is faster and the level of control is lower  but if you can time things right on brined pork this should result on a better balance.", "A couple things I've learned using the instant pot almost every night for something:  \n\n\n1. Natural Release is the most important aspect.  I have, for years, impatiently depressurized my PCs and it absolutely has a toughening effect on pork and beef.\n2. Pork Shoulder is your friend.\n3.

I also aggressively season the meat with spices before cooking. I don\u2019t like to use oil because pork has enough already. I\u2019m not sure what cut pork roast is but I hope this helps.

They're not like fatty cuts or cuts with a lot of connective tissue, which are extremely forgivable, and practically cook themselves to perfection.\n\nLean roasts must be cooked to an exact and proper temperature, no more, no less.  You can't do that in a pressure cooker, because you have no way to monitor temperature, and you can't stop the process instantly, since it's locked away inside the cooker.\n\nI only cook pork loin in the oven, at a low temperature, around ~250F, I often brine it the night before if I have time.  I put the roast on a wire rack, inside its roasting tray, and seal the whole thing with aluminum foil.  Periodically I baste it in its own drippings.  After it reaches about 135-140F internal temperature, take it out of the oven, remove aluminum foil, and transfer to a thin baking sheet.  Turn oven onto broil, and sear for a few minutes, with the roast as close to the top of your oven as you can get.  Alternatively you could sear it in a big cast iron pan, depending on loin and pan size.\n\nAnyone advocating pork loin in a pressure cooker either doesn't know their cut of meats, and is really using a shoulder, is lying about the results, or got extremely lucky but doubtfully could reproduce those results.", "ANOTHER way to cook pork is to cube it into nice big 2 inch chunks, put it in a pot and cover it with enough liquid/beer/water/cola or whatever you want to use and slow boil it until the liquid is boiled out of the pot. \n\nThen the magic happens. It starts to fry in it's own fat so keep an eye on it at this stage. You have to use a fatty cut like pork belly or a fatty pork roast. I season it before i start to cut it, rub it in and let it sit for about 30 min. \n\nAs you cut the meat the rub gets smeared into the cut sides.  As i cut to the meat i toss it in the dry pot. I gently add the liquid, loosely cover and bring it to a boil. Once it starts to boil I turn it down enough to keep a rolling boil. After about 30 min. I remove the lid so the liquid evaporates. \n\nIt takes about an hour to 90 minutes.", "The problem with pork loin:  (1) it's too lean; and (2) i find them to vary widely in dimensions.  So a \"recipe\" with a set time and process may work great for one loin but not another.  There isn't a lot of wiggle room.  That means you should never rely solely on cooking times with a loin.  You need to have absolute control/knowledge of its internal temperature during the cook.  So, considering that,  I would never cook it in a pressure cooker or instapot.\n\nThe best way to cook pork loin:  sous vide.  145 to 150 for a couple of hours followed by a quick sear in a smoking hot skillet.  Perfectly tender. (note: some people love it closer to 140 or even lower...not me).\n\nIf you aren't going to sous vide, definitely roast it with a digital thermometer embedded in the center.  Take it out around 150 (more or less depending on how you like it), let it rest for 10 minutes.  If its still dry and tough, its not your cook, its the loin itself.", "Brining is necessary.", "I used sous vide for this type of stuff. If I do cook it in the oven or smoker a remote temperature gauge is a must to monitor the interior temperature of the meat. Enough trial and error can work too, but I prefer the techy solution.", "Pork loin should never be slow/pressure cooked. Sear on all sides, cover loosely, bake at 325 until 140 internal. Remove from cooking vessel. Let rest before slicing. Every degree over 145 means less moisture and tenderness.\n\nPork shoulder/butt should always be slow/pressure cooked (or smoked) to make pulled pork. How big is the roast? A 3 pound roast may only take 45 minutes at pressure a 6 pound roast may take 75+ minutes at pressure. The pork is done when you can easily stick a fork in it and twist it all the way around (about 200 degrees internal). If the roast doesn't fall apart it needs more time. Let rest under foil for 30 minutes or more to retain juiciness before pulling with 2 forks.\n\nGood luck!", "Ok first  thing . Get a large fry pan hot with a little olive oil. Do a quick brown on both sides this seals the juice in the pork. Remember your not cooking just browning on both both sides . Might  want to do a garlic rub on both sides after you brown .Now follow  the instructions on your pressure cooker according to the weight of the roast . At the end of cooking check temperature at center of roast. Should be around 165 degrees  F.", "I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted for this...We\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic induced pork shortage, and you used the wrong method/cut (hence overcooking) five times??? I hope the food didn\u2019t go to waste.\n\nAs many have said, \u201cpork roast\u201d usually refers to the loin which is extremely lean meat that lacks connective tissue, and should be treated like a steak (don\u2019t cook over 140F if you want it to be juicy). No good reason to cook this in a pressure cooker, unless you want pork leather.\n\nPork *shoulder* (or \u201cBoston Butt\u201d) is what you wanted here. It\u2019s high in fat and connective tissue. These are the kinds of meats that do well in a pressure cooker (or also in low and slow methods such as braising or smoking) as they need to get up to 195F to break down the connective tissue and tenderize."]}

Add the stock, seal the lid, and cook on the \"rice\" setting, adjusting the time to 12 minutes. Do a quick release and open the pot, then switch back to\"saute\" mode and continue cooking until the rice is thickened but still flows (you don't want rice pudding). Add the cheese, taste for salt and pepper, and season. Serve immediately with extra cheese and freshly ground black pepper on top.\n\nOf course, I almost never make it with just those ingredients, as risotto is a great way to clear out leftovers in your pantry or fridge:\n\n* Go the classic route by sauteeing wild mushrooms with your onions, adding some steamed asparagus right when you open the pot, and grating in some lemon zest and nutmeg when you add the cheese.\n* Make it a southwest risotto by adding chili powder, a can of green chiles, and bacon to the saut\u00e9ing onions, toss some cherry tomatoes in when you add the stock, add some canned corn (and optionally some cooked chicken) when you first open the cooker, and mix cheddar in with the romano or parmesan.\n* Make a seafood risotto by substituting miso broth for the chicken stock, adding canned tuna or frozen cooked shrimp when you open the pot, and adding some chopped dill with the cheese.\n* Make a fall risotto by adding some dried cranberries and pumpkin puree with the chicken stock, adding in some cooked cubed butternut squash (and optionally ground sausage) when you open the pot, and grating in some nutmeg with the cheese. \n\nThe possibilities are endless!"]}

If you like a more cooked center, you can add another minute or two to get that consistency.\n\nTo make ahead, assemble the batter, pour into individual baking ramekins, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate till later.

This is a traditional soup in many Polish homes and you can find many different versions of this recipe.  \n\nwhat is very important, saute the onion, bacon, and sausage first, then add water and the rest of the ingredients. Set timer for 1h, soup/broth/stew option (depends on pressure cooker)\n\nenjoy!\n\nIngredients:  \n1 medium onion  \n2 garlic cloves  \n500 g yellow split pea  \n2 l water  \n1/2 tbsp marjoram  \n1 tbsp Vegetta (or 1 cube of chicken stock)  \n200 g pork ribs (or chicken leg)  \n2 medium potatoes (diced)  \n200 g polish smoked sausage (kielbasa)  \n70 g smoked bacon", "It looks like a good recipe.  Split pea soup is one of my favorites, so I enjoy seeing variations like yours.\n\nI suggest sauteing the kielbasa and meat until it's nicely browned on all sides before adding the onion, liquid, or any other moist ingredients.  Onion has a lot of moisture that it releases quickly when it starts to cook, and that moisture cools the oil and prevents the meat from browning.  Even though you get a little browning at the bottom of the pot in your video, you will get a lot more flavor by nicely browning the meat on all sides before adding the onion or anything with liquid.  \n\nAfter the meat has browned, you could also saute the onion long enough to brown some of it too in the same oil and fat.  Otherwise you're basically just boiling the onion.  The moisture released by the onion has to be mostly steamed away for the temperature to rise high enough to brown it.   You don't have to brown the onion of course if you don't want to. I'm just saying that if you want to boost the flavor by browning it, you have to get the temp of the oil high enough to give the onion time to actually brown by waiting for the moisture released from them to evaporate.\n\nI mention this because I frequently see a lot of pressure cooking videos in which onion and meat are sauteed in oil for a minute or two with none of it getting browned at all before liquid is added.   That's just a waste of time when done that way.  It's just boiling the onion in its own moisture, even though it's going to be well cooked and boiled anyways when you pressure cook it.  Therefore it's a wasted step unless you actually brown it to boost the flavor.  The point of sauteing is to concentrate the flavor and brown it (or at least toast it).\n\nFrying in oil with moisture isn't really frying at all, it's boiling with the oil not able to get to a browning temperature.  The moisture prevents the oil temperature from rising above the boiling point of water until most of the water has evaporated.\n\nYou can tell whether something is frying or boiling by the sound it makes and how the food behaves in the pan.  The word saute comes from the French verb sauter, meaning \"to jump\".  The literal meaning of saute describes how the food jumps and pops when fried in hot oil.  If it's not sizzling, jumping, and popping in the pan, then it's probably just bubbling and boiling, not sauteing.\n\nI agree with your comments in the video about how important it is to brown the food for flavor, and you did get some browning (the fond) in the pot, so I'm merely trying to describe the flavor that you're missing because a lot more browning could happen by changing the order of frying a little bit to keep the moisture away from the oil to let the browning happen.\n\nYour soup looks good regardless, so I'm just offering some detailed suggestions that might make it even better.", "Excellent you\u2019re back!

{"title": "Day 3: Marinara Sauce", "selftext": "After a successful chicken soup, I figured it was time to adapt another personal staple--good 'ol marinara. \n\n1) Mise en place: I peeled and grated 1 large carrot, and 1 white onion onion (grating the onion is a tearful process, but overall I think it adds well to the consistency of the sauce), and diced 2 large cloves of garlic.\n\n2) I set my Instant Pot to normal saute, and put in 3 tbs of extra virgin olive oil.\n\n3) Once it's fragrant, I put a generous tablespoon of tomato paste--using a wooden spoon to coat it in olive oil and flatten it a bit for a greater browning surface area. The paste can be difficult to work with at times; it wants to clump up. To solve this I recommend rapidly tapping the edge of the wooden spoon against the bottom of the pan. I'm able to form a nice paste patty this way. \n\n4) Saute the paste, while carefully agitating to prevent it from burning. Over about 10 minutes, the paste will turn to a dark brick red color.\n\n5) Introduce the grated onion, the carrot, the garlic, and some more olive oil to keep the pan from drying out (\\~1 tbs). Incorporate the paste with the veggies, add salt, pepper, 3 bay leaves, basil (sometimes I add thyme, rosemary, or oregano too), then let it sweat for 2 - 5 minutes. \n\n6) Add a red wine (I prefer merlot). How much is up to preference I think. 1/3 - 1/2 a cup seems like the right amount to me. You need just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, but you don't want to overpower the sauce.\n\n7) Let the sauce simmer for about 7 minutes. Then add in a 32 oz can of whole tomatoes and 5 crushed garlic cloves.\n\n8) Put the cover on, and set the pot to pressure cook on low.\n\n9) Once it reaches pressure, let it cook for 10 minutes.\n\n10) After 10 minutes, release pressure and remove lid. Set the pot to normal saute, then mash the tomatoes and stir.\n\n11) Let the sauce reduce to desired thickness.\n\n12) Turn off pot, then add cooked al dente pasta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResults: This recipe has been a goto for a while, so a pressure cooker adaptation would bound to happen in my kitchen. Overall, I would say it's a good recreation. It cuts maybe 30 minutes of simmering out of the equation. 9/10", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/g3ug3s/day_3_marinara_sauce/", "created_utc": 1587241774.0, "score": 66, "author": "_theZincSaucier_", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/g3ug3s/day_3_marinara_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Quality post Op, thank you for non click baiting to a stupid blog or youtube chan. +1", "Very similar to how I make mine.

{"title": "Pressure Cooking tip: saute mode", "selftext": "I've seen countless pressure cooking recipe videos which seem to demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of using saute mode to brown food first, especially for diced meat, ground meat and onions.  \n\nBrowning can have two different meanings, depending on the recipe.  Most people seem to think it means cooking the meat until they don't see any pink.  Usually the meat actually turns grey, not brown, because the meat often releases a lot of moisture that prevents any actual browning until it all steams away, letting the saute temperature rise because only oil and grease remain.  Most of the videos I see show people adding liquid while the meat is still gray, not browned.\n\nBrowning can also mean cooking until it most of it turns from soggy and moist gray to a more crispy brown, to some degree.  This kind of browning add quite a bit of flavor and color due to the Maillard reaction of the amino acids and sugars with the higher heat.  No need to worry about those crispy bits remaining tough, since pressure cooking will end up tenderizing it anyways, but with much of that appealing browned color remaining.  If your pressure cooked ground meat always seems to look like gray dog food - it's probably because you didn't actually brown it: you grayed it.\n\nSame goes for onion.  If the onion remains white or translucent with no actual browning, then no extra flavor or color is being developed through the Maillard reaction.\n\nGarlic, on the other hand, can easily burn and become bitter if cooked too long at high temperature, especially garlic powder.  That's why it's better to add it after any meat or onions have browned so that you can lightly toast it and then add liquid to lower the temperature before it burns.  Extra care is necessary when toasting spices in oil to release their flavor without burning them.\n\nIf you don't want to actually brown any meat or onions because you don't care about the additional flavor and color, that's OK and I'm not judging your choice one way or another, but you can save yourself a whole lot of time in the saute mode by skipping most of it.   You can simply add some of the liquid in the recipe to the ground meat to easily break up any large chunks to mince it by stirring and proceed to add all the ingredients and liquids.  It's a lot faster to mince the meat with liquid, even if the meat is still pink and uncooked before bringing it up to pressure.   It will all get cooked the same in the end, just faster.\n\nIf you do brown the meat and onions, then it's usually normal for lots of browned goodness to stick to the bottom of stainless steel pots.  That's good, not bad.  It's a lot of free flavor.  You just need to add a small amount of liquid that will quickly boil and help you dissolve (deglaze) it with a little light scraping with a soft spatula of some kind that won't scratch the pot.   Deglazing the bottom is important to prevent those bits from burning or causing a burn warning on electric pressure cookers.  It also captures all that flavor and color into the cooking liquid.\n\nMuch of this subject is discussed in this [reddit thread](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/kf9atd/cook_beef_until_brownedshould_i_actually_be/)  but not in the context of pressure cooking.\n\nI hope this is helpful and I welcome any comments you might have regarding browning in pressure cooker saute mode.  You might be able to cut the time of many recipes or improve the results of others when you know the difference between graying and browning.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/nq44hv/pressure_cooking_tip_saute_mode/", "created_utc": 1622580297.0, "score": 60, "author": "vapeducator", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/nq44hv/pressure_cooking_tip_saute_mode/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This is really good, thank you for taking the time to write it all out", "When people ask me for a recipe, which I can't supply because I haven't used recipes much since 1980, I tell them how to make it as best I can.

Should this worry me?", "Another tip: I find the saut\u00e9 mode to be more than adequate for fragrant veggies like onion, garlic, celery, fresh herbs and spices or for toasting rice or other grains before adding the cooking liquid.  \n\nIf i'm going for browning/searing meat before cooking,  nothing beats cast iron pans.  They're usually bigger, get hotter, and you can manipulate and adjust the pieces to make sure to get all sides easier than at the bottom of the pressure cooker pot.  I can't seem to get as much of the meat's surface area seared off in the pot, plus it tends to hold quite a bit of the steam in, and the sear doesn't come out as crispy.  This makes a huge difference for things like carnitas and stews.  \n\nPlus if i sear in a different pan, then I can leave behind much of the oil I was searing with.  It's well worth the cleaning of an extra pan for the really good sear and the milliard reaction."]}

Reason is it releases the enzymes in the beans that cause gas. An overnight soak or even 8 hours is better than nothing. Rinse the beans and add new clean water before you start cooking them. Always sort your beans before you start cooking them. Just don't empty the bag into the pot and have at it. Reason is the beans aren't really clean yet. I'm making beans today and sorted them last night and found a couple stones in the bag. Nothing worse than chomping down on a rock when I'm munching on my beans and corn bread. Read this next sentence because it's very important!! DON'T ADD SALT TO YOUR BEANS EITHER BEFORE THEY ARE COOKING OR DURING THE COOKING PROCESS!! Adding salt will slow the cooking process and sometimes stop it entirely. If you need salt add it after the beans are done. Or do like I do and add some country ham before the beans cook along with the water. Country ham adds tremendous flavor to the beans plus it's salty enough for me. Hope this helps you. I cooked beans today in my Instant Pot but you can cook them in a pot on the stove. Cook until the beans are soft. I like to add a little onion to mine."]}

{"title": "Simple and Fast Turkey Cajun Dirty Rice", "selftext": "With the recent increases in food prices, I thought I'd post some pressure cooker meal recipes that I think are affordable, simple, and fast to make.\n\nI frequently make my own version of Cajun Dirty rice, which I make no claim to be authentic, but is quite delicious and I think is something that's worth trying and making with your own preferences in mind.\n\nMy local Walmart has Festive-brand frozen ground turkey for $2.20 per pound, and turkey breakfast sausage for $2.10 per pound.  Either can be used for this recipe, although I prefer the seasoned sausage flavor.  You may use ground beef, ground pork, and/or ground sausage, as well as sliced smoked sausages or hotlinks of the spice level you like.  Ground meat of some kind is usually the basis of dirty rice, but lots of additions are OK to make your own hybrid.  Some recipes add chicken livers - I don't.\n\nWalmart has Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix - Family Size, 12 oz., for $2.08 per box.  The Zatarain's Jambalaya mix is similar, so you can use that instead if you wish.  Zatarain's products are widely available at many supermarket chains.   If you can't find the mix, use a 2 cups of parboiled/converted rice, 2 teaspoons Tony Chachere\u2019s Creole seasoning, and 2 teaspoons of Better than Bouillon roasted vegetable base (or other good bouillon), and 3 cups of water, to be added per the recipe instructions below after the sauteeing has been done.\n\nI would be quite derelict of my duty if I failed to stress the importance of the [Cajun Holy Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_\\(cooking\\)) of onions, bell peppers and celery for this recipe, which have the fundamental flavors of this cuisine, as well as Cajun dark roux of flour that's well toasted in oil and/or butter.  Unfortunately, I think the process of making a proper dark roux is out of scope for my mission of a simple & fast recipe, so please pardon me if I take some shortcuts in that regard in the interest of my goal here.  I have included a source of jarred dark roux for those who consider it required, although you're at liberty to make your own dark roux, of course.\n\nTwo parts of the Holy Trinity are easily obtained with the Walmart Great Value Pepper & Onion Blend, Frozen, 20 oz, $2.33, which contains sliced red and green bell peppers, with onion.  Kroger has something very similar:  Kroger Recipe Beginnings 3 Pepper & Onion Blend 12 oz for $1.39.  ALDI and many other stores have something similar: frozen bell peppers and onions, already cut and prepped.  Use whatever you find that's available.\n\nOnly the celery part of the Trinity is missing from that veggie mix.  So you can get some fresh celery, wash it and slice a couple of stalk of it if you wish.  Or you can use a little bit of celery salt or ground celery seed, less than half a teaspoon.  Or you can skip it.\n\nExtra rice can be used to stretch the meat and flavor into a larger batch.  Use rinsed long grain white rice or parboiled rice, preferably the latter.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pound of ground meat/protein, I use Festive Turkey Breakfast Sausage 16oz.\n\n* 1 20oz bag frozen peppers and onion mix,  2 12oz. bags, or whatever you want\n\n* 1 box Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix - Family Size, 12 oz.\n\n* approx. 2 tablespoons of oil.\n\n* optional 1/4 cup [Karys Dark Roux](https://www.amazon.com/Karys-Dark-Roux-16-Pack/dp/B08KQJPMYY/)\n\n* optional: extra dry rice, parboiled or long grain, plus 1.5 cups extra water per cup of dry rice.  Boost seasonings by at least 1 teaspoon per cup of liquid, so 1.5 teaspoons of Better than Bouillon Roasted Vegetable base and/or Tony Checheres Seasoning.\n\nInstructions:\n\nThaw any frozen meat, safely.   I transfer the frozen turkey sausage from freezer to fridge the night before cooking, if I remember.   I have a wiz bang newfangled inverter microwave oven that can thaw the turkey perfectly in 12 minutes, without cooking it.\n\nStart heating a 4qt. or larger stovetop pressure cooker over medium heat or start Saute mode on an electric pressure cooker.\n\nAdd 2 tablespoons of neutral cooking oil (your choice) to the pressure cooker, or spray with non-stick oil spray, or both.\n\nFry/saute the meat/protein until nicely browned in the oil, not merely gray color.  It's ok it it sticks to the pot, just don't let it smoke excessively or burn.  Brown is good.\n\nFor health reasons for those on a lower fat diet, you can remove/drain any excess oil/grease if you wish at this point or after frying the veggies in it.\n\nAdd the pepper/onion mix to the meat (whether the veggies are frozen or fresh, doesn't matter).  You may add sliced celery too.  Feel free to add other diced/sliced veggies, including diced carrot, more onion, minced/crushed garlic, chili peppers, etc.  You're eating it.  Use what you like.\n\nYou may saute or lightly brown the veggies, if you wish for more flavor.  You may add 1/4 cup of the dark roux (optional).\n\nAdd 1 12oz. box of Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix to the veggies & meat, stir briefly to absorb the oils and liquids with the rice mix.\n\nAdd 3.5 cups water.

{"title": "Putting The Instant Pot Under Pressure: Testing Instant Pot vs. Fagor - The Basics: White Rice", "selftext": "**Preface**\n\nI have both an Instant Pot (Duo 8 quart) and a Fagor (Lux 8 quart), two of the most popular multicooker/electric pressure cookers on the market today, and I love them both. Most of the information below is applicable across most of the different model types.\n\nWhile using them both side by side I have discovered many similarities, but also more differences than meet the eye. After spending far more hours researching and reading about this stuff than I would care to admit, I've learned a few surprising things, and found that even though there is a wealth of information out there, some of it is certainly bad or confusing, and on certain topics, there is definitely a lack of information. I wanted to test some of the things I've been figuring out, and I thought I would post my results here.\n\nIt turns out a lot of those programmed function buttons on your IP don't work exactly as most people think, often in a surprisingly good way. Prepare to love your IP even more, and I have more tests coming!\n\n**White Rice**\n\nGoing with the basics, white rice seems like a good place to start. Both units have a function button for white rice - \"Rice\" for the IP and \"White Rice\" for the Fagor, however they do work slightly differently. **NOTE:** The \"Rice\" function button on the IP is only designed for (most) varieties of white rice, and is not suitable for brown or most other rice/grain varieties. I have found, however, that it works perfectly for quinoa!\n\n**Fagor** \\- This unit uses low pressure for white rice, and has a default time under pressure of 10 minutes. I live (mostly) at an elevation of 6,000 feet above sea level, and I do find that a number of things don't quite get cooked using standard recipes. Using the rule of thumb to add 5&#37; to the cooking time for each 1,000 of elevation above 2,000 feet seems to work quite well, so for this comparison I am going with 12 minutes (10 minutes plus 20&#37;) using the \"White Rice\" function button, and then a 10 minute natural pressure release, and fluffed with a fork at the end.\n\n**IP** \\- This is where it gets interesting. The IP \"Rice\" function button also uses low pressure, but it does not use a fixed time. The literature from the Instant Pot folks says: \"The cooking time is adjusted automatically depending on the amount of rice.\" This is true, but not really in the way implied by that sentence, as the IP has no way of measuring weight or volume. Specific to the \"Rice\" function only, the IP will determine when the rice is done by monitoring the temperature. When most of the liquid has been absorbed the IP will see a temperature spike, and thus it knows to switch itself to the \"Keep Warm\" mode and alert you that the pressure cooking time is done. I have found that it works out to a time under pressure that averages very closely to the times discussed above for the Fagor, and I also use a 10 minute natural pressure release, with the rice fluffed with a fork at the end.\n\n**The Recipe**\n\n\\-2 Cups Long Grain White Rice\n\n\\-2 Cups Water\n\n\\-2 TBSP Soy Sauce (low sodium, in this case, because that is what was in the fridge)\n\n\\-2 TBSP Extra Virgin Olive Oil (also good with an equal amount of butter, instead)\n\n\\-Rice rinsed under running water for 30-60 seconds, drained for 30-60 seconds (\\*this is a very important step\\*)\n\n**The Results**\n\nDelicious! Seriously, they both turned out wonderful rice. Fluffy, moist, just very slightly sticky, but the individual grains were slightly firm. In other words, about as close to perfect rice (to my preferences, at least) as I am likely to produce (and individual preferences could easily be accommodated by adding/subtracting small intervals to the natural pressure release time). There was virtually no difference between the two - if I could pinpoint any difference at all it would be that the Fagor rice seemed very slightly firmer, but not even enough to call it *al dente*, and it was so slight that it might be my imagination. If I am not imagining it I would guess that it might be because the IP runs a bit hotter than the Fagor.  Low pressure yields 5.8 \\~7.2 psi and 110\u00b0C \\~ 112\u00b0C (229 \\~ 233\u00b0F) for the IP, and 4 \\~7 psi and 108\u00b0C \\~ 110\u00b0C (226 \\~ 230\u00b0F) for the Fagor. Those numbers would be somewhat lower, factoring in elevation.  Also, the 5&#37; elevation rule mentioned above is just a rule of thumb, not an exact formula.\n\nIf I were blindfolded and being fed random forkfuls of both (which I will not do - not after The Great Blindfold Hot Wings Debacle of 2016), I don't think I could really tell when changing between the two.\n\n**And the winner is...** The Instant Pot! While I consider it a tie as far as taste/doneness/texture goes (they both did great), I would give the edge to the IP because the automation of the \"Rice\" function button. I am constantly pressure cooking stuff in different locations (and elevations), and not needing to worry about any calculations, even though a quite small issue, is a big plus to me. Also, should I happen to add more or less liquid (intentionally or otherwise) I think the rice would be more likely to turn out correctly with the IP.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/8vnk95/putting_the_instant_pot_under_pressure_testing/", "created_utc": 1530576143.0, "score": 58, "author": "kjl291", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/8vnk95/putting_the_instant_pot_under_pressure_testing/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This is terrific.

(For the curious but lazy, combustible fumes from alcohol boiling off and gathering around your pressure cooker.) There was a quote from Instant Pot that makes allusions to this, but in the next paragraph it talks about using alcohol to build pressure, so I was uncertain what the exact danger the article was talking about until I reached the section that explained it.\n\nAlso a lot of the statements in the article seem to be overly cautious like 'Dr. Bella wants to make it clear that warming up ethanol, which is a highly flammable liquid, should only be done in a controlled environment (a chemical laboratory or a distillery), and only by means of apparatus which has been specifically designed and tested for this specific purpose.' - Cooks have been using wine and spirits to deglaze pans for a long time, as well as in other uses in the kitchen that require heating it up or lighting it on fire. To say that this should only be done in a lab is absurd and weakens all the other safety arguments presented in the article.\n\nAlso the article leaves me unsure of what quantities of liquor would be unsafe to heat up. The main focus seems to be on people heating up mason jars full of everclear, which I could certainly see producing enough fumes to produce unwanted ignition under the right (or rather wrong) circumstances, but what about using a shot of whiskey, or some wine to deglaze? Laura does touch on this a bit, and mentions that wine is a common ingredient in vintage Italian recipe books, but I'm left with no clear idea with what concentration would be dangerous or safe.\n\nFinally, Laura ends the article with the warning 'Hip Pressure Cooking recommends not following pressure cooker recipes from any source that require the use of liquor.' I would note that some of Laura's own recipes use liquor, such as her [chicken liver pate](https://www.hippressurecooking.com/quick-italian-pate-spread/). I will note that it adds the liquor (and a small amount at that) after pressure has been released (although wine is added before bringing to pressure), but her warning isn't against using liquor under pressure it is blanket warning any pressure cooker recipes that use liquor.\n\nAlso Laura has published [other techniques that may be unsafe but includes reasonable safety precautions.](https://www.hippressurecooking.com/dulce-de-leche-pressure-cooked-condensed-milk/)", "Thanks to the redditors who took the time to answer my earlier queries and your tips to look at the distillation process. <3 - Laura", "Never had an issue, tho I only use beer on occasion & a half cup at most myself.", "Sounds like it needs more research", "/r/howtoasplodeyourkitchen"]}

Press on the top of the chunks of meat with a fork, just to break them up some. If you prefer yours shredded, go for it. If you're using the condensed milk, dip your spoon in the can and drizzle over the top of the meat and veggies. Don't go crazy, but just drizzle it on.

{"title": "Looking for lazy pressure cooking recipes", "selftext": "Me and my brother just got a pressure cooker from our dad. Neither of us are big fans of cooking. So we are looking for super simple pressure cooking meals. Or just advise on using a pressure cooker. We mainly use thawed chicken breast and would like a way to cook maybe 6 all at one time so we can use them through out the week. Is it as simple as placing the chicken in and cover with some kind of flavored liquid? Literally something as simple as that is what we are looking for. Any advice would be great though. Thanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/ao9qwr/looking_for_lazy_pressure_cooking_recipes/", "created_utc": 1549579907.0, "score": 50, "author": "rockleesww", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/ao9qwr/looking_for_lazy_pressure_cooking_recipes/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": [">Is it as simple as placing the chicken in and cover with some kind of flavored liquid?\n\nSo here's how a pressure cooker works:\n\n1. It requires one cup of liquid to operate; the liquid is required to pressurize the pot.  Sometimes you'll have juicy food, so you may not require as much liquid.  The water is heated & then used to create pressure inside of the pot.\n2. If you've ever blown up a balloon, a pressure cooking works in the same way: you lock the lid, then it builds up pressure, just like a balloon.\n3. Water normally boils at 212F; inside of a pressurized environment, the boiling point of water raises to 250F.  This roughly quadruples the cooking speed, without affecting the quality of the food.\n4. It cooks in a special way, using \"saturated steam\", which is different than simply steaming the food.\n5. There are 3 parts to the cooking process; the preheat or \"pressurization\" time, the cooking time, and the cool-down time.\n6. You have two options for cool-down: NPR or QPR.  NPR means \"natural pressure release\", which means that when the pot finishes cooking, you let it come down to room-pressure by itself over the course of ten or twenty minutes.  QPR means \"quick pressure release\", which means you twist the vent knob (don't put your hand over the top of it!) to quickly release the pressure, which typically happens in under a minute (steam shoots out like a volcano & it makes a loud, scary noise, which you'll get used to).  Different recipes require different release methods for different reasons (affects the texture, mainly - sometimes you want an NPR and sometimes you want a QPR; the recipe will tell you).\n7. It's important to realize that all advertise cooking times are essentially straight-up lies.  Rice may take 3 minutes to pressure-cook, but it takes 6 minutes to pressurize and another 10 minutes to do a natural pressure release, so it's really about 20 minutes to cook the rice from the time you dump it in & start the machine to the time it's ready to eat.\n\nThe TL;DR is that you drop food & water in, let it cook, and eat!  The majority of recipes involve either dumping ingredients in, or doing a few extra steps, such as using \"saute\" mode to brown the meat before you pressure-cook it, so you get some texture on the outside, as well as super-tender meat.\n\nAn easy method is to pour in some salsa & add a few boneless, skinless chicken breasts; frozen is fine!  Cook for 25 minutes on manual mode using high pressure.  Take the chicken breasts out, chop them up or shred them with forks, and then stir them back into the salsa.  See if they're cooked how you want or if they are over-cooked; I'd suggest keeping a little notebook to take notes in so that you have a reference of what works & what doesn't!\n\nSome tips:\n\n1. I don't know what kind of pressure cooker you have, but you'll want to buy some spare sealing rings.  The ones for the Instant Pot absorbs smells like crazy, so I have separate ones for really potent, savory stuff & stuff for sweeter items like desserts.  I made chicken curry one time & then made yogurt later that week & my yogurt smelled like Indian food!\n2. I use a [mesh basket](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CPVFN8) for many of my meals, especially stuff like pulled pork, where I don't always want the meat to be sitting in the water.  It makes it easy to remove the food using an oven mitt (hot handle!).\n3. Once you figure out a recipe that you like, write it down!  Again, a paper notebook is fine.  The key thing to remember here is that the pressure cooker will cook it *exactly* the same way every single time if you follow the same instructions & use the same quantities of ingredients as you did originally, which means that once you nail a recipe down, it will always come out perfect!\n4. Check out egg bites made in the pressure cooker; they are like velvety mini omelets and are REALLY good!  I use [this silicone mold](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MYE40CO/) to make them (fits in my 6-quart Instant Pot).\n\nChicken, beef, pork, eggs, rice, oatmeal - you can make all kinds of stuff in the pressure cooker!

I'll be experimenting with different cooktimes to find a sweet spot eventually.\nI made this in a 6-qt Instant Pot and a small Aroma rice cooker I already had.\nIf you're making this for small kids, consider boneless chicken for safety.\nThis recipe makes about 3-4 servings:\n\n* 2 thawed, skin-on, bone-in or boneless chicken thighs (dark meat, bone-in breaks up better and is more flavorful once cooked imo)\n* 2 \"rice cooker\" cups of white long-grain rice. you can use your PC for similar results\n* 2-3 chicken bouillon cubes (you can even use ramen flavor packets in a pinch!)\n* Half can of Cream of Chicken soup\n* Half of a large onion, or one small onion\n* Salt, pepper, garlic powder\n\n-Use rice cooker or PC to cook rice, adding one bouillon cube to the water before it starts. \n\n-Take the rice off the heat source after cooking (move it to a bowl and set it aside for a few). \n\n-Start up your PC and add the chicken thighs with about 2 tablespoons of oil, a cup of water, the remaining bouillon, a half-teaspoon of salt, half-teaspoon of pepper, and a few pinches of garlic powder. Add all of the onion, diced. \n\n-Set your EPC for manual, 10 minutes, high pressure, and \"sealing\"\n\n-Once the cycle finishes, pour off most of the excess stock (leave about 1/4 cup's worth, you can use the rest for soup or something later!) and add that rice and half can of Cream of Chicken soup into the PC.\n\n-Before closing, stir everything in and use your spoon to break up the chicken. You basically want the pieces to be shredded so they're bite-sized.\n\n-Close the PC and set it to manual for a couple minutes, or \"keep warm\" for another 5 minutes or so, and keep it \"venting\". Don't pressurize it again, or the rice will begin to burn. At this point you're just letting it steam up and letting the soup and rice mix in.\n\n-After that, check that the chicken is cooked thoroughly and you're done! Add more salt/pepper if you need. You can steam some green veggies while you're on that last step. I usually eat it with broccoli or green beans.\n\nThis took me about 45 minutes total to make, and that includes the 15 or so minutes I used to unbox and test the cooker.\nPlease let me know if any of you try it out!\n\n**edit: I never really measure anything exact while cooking from scratch (grew up this way- southern family), so I've reread this to make small edits on approx. measurements.**"]}

It looks like the pressure hasn't built up enough to reach full pressure, because the weight should be floating and slowly moving as the steam becomes like an air bearing under it.  I'd use a pipe cleaner brush or q-tips to clean the inside of the weight of any crud.  I'd check and clean the pressure regulator tube too, and see if the top of the tube is smooth and clean to minimize the amount of steam release.\n\nWhen the pressure exceeds 15 psi, the weight should lift but not fly off due to a spring clip retainer that should hold it on the metal tube.  The clip is a spring so that you can remove it by hand, but to keep it attached with steam pressure alone.  \n\nThe weight is designed to lift and release more steam when the pressure is too high.  But the proper operation is to turn down the heat as soon as the weight starts to float, so that it never does have to lift to do that.   In other words, ***you're*** the pressure regulator with a stovetop pressure cooker.  It's your responsibility to know how to use it.  The pressure regulator weight shows you when it's at full pressure by floating.  If the pressure gets too high to cause it to lift and release a lot of steam, that means the person operating it has failed to adjust the heat properly, so that it doesn't continue to build up pressure and explode.  The red valve on the lid (not the lid lock in the handle) is a backup safety valve.  Who knows if that one will work if needed?", "Thank you for your posts!!!\nI only have started canning last year.\nI mostly read up on it, when it\u2019s time..\nI found that what I can can with A so called water bath\u2026\nBut now I would like a large size pressure cooker.\nEvery thrift store has no bobber on it.\nSo No, I\u2019m not buying \ud83d\udc4e\nThanks again\u00a0\nLeslie \u270c\ufe0f", "You see the red-orange bit on the handle that's popped up? That pops up when the pressure inside the pot has built up enough to force it to pop up. It should also lock the lid in place so that you can't open it until the pressure inside the cooker has died down. This should also be popping up before the weight starts to float and hiss.  \nThe floaty weight in the middle of the pot keeps all the steam inside the pot until there is enough pressure built up inside to lift the weight. At that point, it will lift the weight, and vent a bit of steam, reducing the pressure inside. With reduced pressure, the weight will lower and seal the pressure inside once again.  \nThe weight here is constantly floating because steam inside is building up as fast as it can vent. What you should do at this point is reduce the heat to your cooker so that it seals once again. You want to find a sweet spot where your giving the cooker enough heat that it will maintain temperature and thus pressure, but not enough that it will constantly lift up the weight and vent away that pressure. If the temperature is too low, the pressure inside the pot will drop, and you'll see the red-orange lock drop, and your food will no longer be pressure cooking, it will just be regular cooking.", "The weights on my pressure canners begin to rock when they approach the target pressure.  I can also tap the weight like you did and they will release for a second.  I'm not familiar with the style of weight you have, but it appears to be working.\n\n[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/XqdKSkbIQ3g)", "This looks like a later model Brazilian-made T-Fal or Wearever Mirro cooker. The jiggler is supposed to [hiss softly and then intermittently jiggle and spin softly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF8xJSejRvE). Did it ever jiggle by itself or just hiss like this continuously? If it never jiggled, then I would recommend inspecting the vent tube (that the jiggle sits on) for any obstructions, and also inspect the bottom of the jiggler. May want to run a pipe cleaner through to the vent hole and jam it into the bottom of the jiggler and twist a few times.", " there's no way for the pot to control the heat on the stove.. \n\nso it releases pressure to *maintain* temperature. (an electric PC, like InstantPot, controls the temperature of the heating element)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe weight is probably 14.5psi (if it's the high pressure weight).\n\nthis means that the pot will hiss/rattle when the pressure/temp inside exceeds14.5/\\~250F\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/how-pressure-cookers-work\n\nSince then, not much has changed, and pressure cooker designs can be classified by generations. The first and simplest ***\u201cold type\u201d pressure cookers feature a weighted \u201cjiggler\u201d valve that releases and regulates pressure, causing a rattling noise as steam escapes.*** Today, most pressure cookers you can find are first-generation designs, with small safety improvements like pressure-sensitive locking mechanisms, as well as the ability to adjust pressure by changing the weight of the valve."]}

{"title": "I finally had success with Instantpot vegetarian red beans and rice, and I would like to share my method.", "selftext": "I love my instantpot, but i've had a lot of bad experiences with beans. Problems with flavor, consistency, undercooking, overcooking, etc. Well, last night I think I finally did something right with a big pot of red beans and rice. I would give a recipe, but it's more fun to discuss technique and go through the thought process that brought me to this success. \n\nAs a vegetarian I don't have many chances to enjoy that smokey, charred, grilled flavor that meaty dishes tend to have. So last night I decided to make cajun red beans. I know that the best way to flavor beans is to cook them with plenty of aromatics like the ones you would typically put in stock. However, in the past this approach left me less than satisfied with the tepid soupy flavor that results if you just throw in raw onion, carrot, celery and parsley with the beans. And sauteing the diced veggies beforehand killed a lot of the flavor in the finished product. I wanted something more savory and complex, with a smokey flavor that is so necessary in cajun food. \n\nI decided to give the veggies a quick char in my oven's broiler. Ideally I would have done this on a grill or gas stove to get that flame-fired taste, but this was the next best option. I very coarsely (only 2-3 pieces per veggie) cut up red onion, bell pepper, and celery (the holy trinity) along with some carrots and serrano peppers, and put them as close to the broiler as I could. I put no oil on the veggies to encourage them to char and burn instead of browning. They were in for a total of 6 minutes, with a quick flip at minute 4. I was very pleased with how the veggies turned out; blackened near the edges but still had some crunch.\n\nNow about the red beans. I soaked a pound of them for 8 hours. I know that some new-age food blogs encourage people not to soak their beans, but in my experience that advice doesn't apply to pressure cooked beans. Unsoaked beans seem to break apart and have very inconsistent texture no matter how long you cook them. Thus, I soaked and cooked them with the soaking liquid to preserve the color. It was 6 cups of liquid in total, which turned out to be a little too much, but next time I will cook in 5 cups and it should be perfect.\n\nI was conflicted about adding any tomato considering that acid can hinder the bean cooking process. I ended up caramelizing half a can of tomato paste in the instantpot with some canola oil before adding the beans/liquid. I didn't toast the beans like some have suggested, but I will try that next time to see if it makes a difference. \n\nOn top of the beans and liquid I generously threw in the charred veggies, several whole garlic cloves (raw), a bouquet of thyme and parsley, 2 bay leaves, half an orange, salt, pepper, and cajun salt seasoning. Additionally, a small pinch of baking soda was added to neutralize the acid from the tomato paste. I know there is a lot of debate about whether or not you should put salt with the cooking beans, but this time I took a chance and added salt.\n\nI cooked on high pressure for 15 minutes with a natural release, making the the total cooking times about 40 or so mins. When I finally opened the lid, the wonderful smell of thyme and filled my apartment. The beans seemed overcooked at first, but firmed up after cooling a bit. Although not bad in any way, next time I will probably cook them for a little less time (13-14 mins), or for the same amount of time with less water. Overall, they were consistently cooked with (somewhat) intact skins and a creamy texture. \n\nThe flavor was outstanding. The smokiness from the charred veggies mingled beautifully with the aromatics and the herbs, and could be tasted throughout the beans and the liquid. The tomato paste was a good, subtle addition to the texture and taste. I gave it a couple quick pulses from my stick blender to thicken it up and create a smooth, composed gravy. \n\nI removed the orange, the herbs, and the bay leaves but left the very soft veggies in. I then added generous dashes of hot sauce, fresh lemon juice, plenty more cajun salt, chopped parsley, sliced green onion, and a lot of butter. The result was tremendous served with basamati rice. I had it again for lunch today and it tasted even more smokey and savory. I would love to polish this recipe, next time with less cook time, less water, more salt, and a few more ingredients like cumin or smoked paprika. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/568g99/i_finally_had_success_with_instantpot_vegetarian/", "created_utc": 1475797055.0, "score": 49, "author": "None", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/568g99/i_finally_had_success_with_instantpot_vegetarian/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["You can get that smoky taste from chopped canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

If you don't see one, just know that it's 2/3 the entire capacity of the pot. Filling the pot beyond that point has the potential to get food stuff clogging up the pressure release valve, making you unable to open your pressure cooker.

Chop the onion, celery, and carrot. Set aside.\n2. Break the garlic bulb into cloves and peel off the papery  outer layer. You can leave the garlic cloves whole but cut down any  larger cloves to the size of the medium cloves.\n3. Salt and pepper the pork.

Remove the pork from the pot and set aside.\n4. Add the bacon and vegetable mixture to the pot and saute for  several minutes.

Cut into 1 x 2 inch pieces.\n2. \\*\\*you can substitute any manner of sausage for the kielbasa. Kielbasa  gets soft but  still has a bit of bite from the skin. Not all kinds of  sausage will fare well under pressure for that long.

It is shockingly easy and shockingly good. You'll thank me in the morning.\n\nServes 4-6\n\n1. Add olive oil to pot and set to saut\u00e9. When hot add in onion and pepper. Stir every thirty seconds or so until onion go from translucent to just starting to get a little color, about 5-7 minutes.\n2. Add in sausage, garlic, seasonings and wine (if adding). Stir every 30 seconds or so until the pink is gone from the sausage (but it doesn't necessarily have to be thoroughly cooked), about 5-7 minutes\n3. Add ziti pasta and water and stir.\n4. Top with sauce, close/seal lid and set for manual/high pressure for 5 minutes.\n5. When time is up, quick release pressure and open lid after pressure is done releasing.\n6. Ziti should be rather *al dente*. To complete the cooking set cooker to saut\u00e9. Stir every 20-30 seconds until ziti is fully cooked and sauce consistency is as desired, about 7-10 minutes. If the pot gets too hot and cooks too hard, to avoid scorching switch to \"less\" saut\u00e9 mode (or simmer, for a unit like a Fagor) after 3-4 minutes.\n7. Turn to warm mode (or off) and let cool for about 5 minutes.\n8. Serve, and sprinkle the fresh basil and grated cheese on top.\n\n**NOTES**\n\n1. The sauce you choose will have probably the most impact on the final product. You may go with simple tomato sauce, or a pasta sauce of your liking. The first time I did it was with a Muir Glen pasta sauce, and I don't think I've ever topped that. Experiment.\n2. The sausage will also be a big determinant - hot, sweet, whatever you like. I grind my own meat and make my own sausage, but I know that is impractical for many. Experiment.\n3. The \\*\\*Variable/Optional (see notes)\\*\\* tag is there because these ingredients will probably be represented at least in part in the sauce and sausage combination you select, so you will have to work it out - you might want more, less, or none. Experiment.\n4. Salt - there will be saltiness imparted by the sauce, sausage, and cheese. I'd recommend not adding any salt the first time you make it and see how it comes out.

{"title": "Second day - Chicken noodle soup", "selftext": "So I picked up [this recipe](https://www.realordinaryfood.com/instant-pot-chicken-noodle-crispy-skin/), and I wanted to try it out. But I also have my own tricks for chicken soup that I decided to incorporate.\n\n1. After I parted a chicken, I decided on using the breast meat and legs for the soup. Mise on place prep: 1/2 white onion, 1/2 sweet onion, 2 large carrots, and 4 small celery stalks.\n2. I set the cooker to saute, and browned the chicken parts in olive oil, allowing for room as to not overcrowd the pot. By the end, I had a nice fond going. Once browned, I removed and reserved the chix.\n3. I introduced the chopped veggies, bay, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, pepper, and some more olive oil to the pot and got a good sizzle going.\n4. Once the veggies had sweat 5 minutes, I added \\~1 cup of pinot grigio, scrapped the fond, and let it simmer for 5 more minutes.\n5. Finally, I nested the chicken at the bottom of the pot, added \\~4.5 quarts of home made chicken stock (that I had made from the carcass earlier in the day), closed the lid and set it to high pressure for 10 minutes.\n\n\\-----------Chicken skins.\n\n1. On the other side of the counter, around step 2, I brushed the detached chicken skins with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n2. I preheated the oven to 350 and let them cook for \\~ 20 minutes.\n3. After 20 minutes, I flipped them, they were still soft, but were firming up.\n4. After 15 more minutes I took them out, though they did still seem somewhat soft. I placed them on a paper towel, and within a few minutes of that they were crisp.\n\n\\------------Back to soup\n\n6) The pressure cooker finished, but I had stepped away for a little bit to run an errand.  When I had returned it was on the last minute of a 10 minute warm cycle, and it struck me that I was supposed to depressurize as soon as it finished.\n\n7) I depressurized the instant pot.\n\n8) After depressurizing, I removed the chicken and shredded it with two forks.\n\n9) I reintroduced the chicken , and set it to saute on low and introduced the noodles (about 2.5 cups of fusilli).\n\n10) I let them simmer for 9 minutes then set it to warm.\n\n\\------------Result\n\nFor my second full meal experience, this went better than my first. I was worried that I had ruined the meat again, but to my luck I didn't. It probably could have come more tender if I hadn't dropped the ball about depressurization. Overall though it was good 6/10. The broth turned out great. Silky smooth, but not watery. I had made chicken stock in the past, and it came out meh. The trick, I think, is to always scoop a good amount of fat off the top after it settles. The fat makes it too greasy and taste off. Certainly, leave some in there, but after making stock there is always too much. 8/10. The chicken skins: great crunch, but I added too much salt 5/10, but easily could have been 7/10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus tip: if you want some extra flavor, try adding a small splash of soy sauce to a bowl of soup.

My only head-scratcher here is there\u2019s no reason to pressure cook this recipe if you\u2019re not using dried beans.

Otherwise your results will not be as intended \u2014 even if you still enjoyed what you ate. \n\nWhat you *could* do if using canned beans for a quick version, is add your uncooked white rice and the corresponding amount of cooking liquid, then cook it for a minute or two all together at pressure with a natural release.

They are smaller with a more intense hue, far more creamy and have a cooking time eons longer. 5 hours and 15 minutes longer to be exact which makes this an ideal pc recipe. Lacking proper sausage here in the northwest I have found cooking a smoked pork hock with the beans an ideal way to add smoky pork goodness to the dish.\n\nCook the soaked beans and hock for 50 minutes. Remove the hock from which the skin, fat and bone can be removed before shredding the meat and returning it to the beans. Saute the trinity with some diced pork fat and add it back to the beans. Thyme, Cayenne and garlic as well. Simmer while the rice cooks. This is better the second day but who can wait.", "I made this over the weekend, but used canned beans (cause I had them).

I feel like I am getting two recipes what with the pickled jalapenos that stay intact as whole slices and a jalapeno hot sauce with the remains of the slightly mushed up jalapenos left in the jar. After using up the slices, I've taken to giving the jar a good shake and then using it as a hot pepper sauce. Commercial pickled jalapenos have additives to hold color and texture which probably muck up the flavor a bit. These taste cleaner if that makes any sense. This is so easy and the flavor is so good that I am making these on a regular basis now. \n\nThe recipe is quite similar to candied jalapenos but minus the sugar. The candied jalapenos hold their shape as slices and have a little brighter color while the pickled jalapenos tend to break down a bit. Both are great to have on hand.\n\nAt a recent potluck, I provided candied jalapenos on cream cheese with crackers on the side. This simple offering was a hit.

Overcooking fish is not good to maintain its tenderness.  You might need a slightly longer cooking time if you added a lot of slower cooking vegetables inside the pouch, but not with a seasoning paste like this recipe uses.\n\nThe normal cooking time should be only 2.5 - 4 minutes at low pressure (if using a quick release on an electric pressure cooker) or 2-3 minutes at low on a stovetop pressure cooker using the cold water release method (which is better to prevent overcooking).  \n\nRemember that this timing doesn't include all of the cooking that happens as the Instant Pot is coming up to pressure, which will already be mostly enough to fully cook the fish.   \n\nI suggest using a instant read meat thermometer to verify the internal temp of the fish and to adjust the cooking time to be less or more until you dial in the best time for it.  10 minutes + 5 minutes natural release will have an internal temp well above 210F for most of that cooking time.   I've seen fish at that temp with an 8 minute cook time + quick release even though it was frozen solid at the start.  For example: [Instant Pot Frozen Fish with Vegetables](https://youtu.be/kKBogL-9Z_s)\n\nBanana leaves and aluminum foil make sense when steaming food in a jungle village over a wood fire, since the leaves and fire are what you'd have in that situation.   However, they're completely unnecessary when using any pressure cooker.  This is basically a French fish \"En Papillote\" recipe that normally uses parchment baking paper to make the pouches.  You can eliminate the pouch entirely by using the pot-in-pot technique, as demonstrated in the video above.\n\nThe video also has some incorrect information at the end.  Pressure cookers do not \"infuse\" flavors into meat with steam pressure for the short cooking times needed to cook tender fish.  The higher pressure only allows a higher cooking temp due to physics, since the boiling point of water varies with air pressure.  The pressure does not somehow cause the liquid and seasonings to be injected or infused into the meat.    \n\n[Seafood and Fish pressure cooking times](https://fastcooking.ca/pressure_cookers/cooking_times_pressure_cooker.php#seafood_and_fish)\n\nThe essentials of the recipe, the chili paste, seem very good to me, so please don't take my comments as if I think it's a bad one.  On the contrary, I'm just trying to help complete the conversion to Instant Pot to fully utilize its capability.  No banana leaves.  No parchment.  A reusable pot serves the same purpose, with a lower cooking time to keep the internal temp of the fish down to \"perfectly done\" range instead of being overcooked.   Now if you want to use banana leaves or parchment, that's fine, but they aren't essential to the results, which is fish steamed with seasonings in its own juices.  A lot of people can use this recipe to get the same results without specific pouch materials.", "Oh! This looks so delicious! If you wouldn't have told that this is Indonesian dish, I would have thought it as South Indian dish as they serve most of the dishes in banana leaves. But, fish in banana leaf sounds great! I'm gonna give it a try.", "Oh this is so great!!! I had that meal in Indonesia and have been looking to recreate it for my SO ever since"]}

Then you have to rinse and soak the rice in water overnight or 4-10 hours.   This step helps to hydrate the starch all the way through the core before attempting to cook it.

If the center is not hydrated, cooking will mostly prevent the center from being gelatinized - because gelatin = starch + water + heat.

Make sure the pot is as hot as it can be when you place the  onions in (Instant Pot: wait until indicator says HOT).\n3. **Saut\u00e9 Onion, Shallot, and Garlic:**  Add 1 tablespoon of peanut oil into the pressure cooker. Add sliced  onion & shallot, saut\u00e9 until brown & fragrant. Add minced  garlic, saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Season layering with kosher salt &  ground black pepper if desired.\n4. **Saut\u00e9 Chicken Thighs:**  Pour in the chicken, saut\u00e9 until slightly browned (let the chicken  caramelize on one side first before stirring, you don\u2019t have to stir  continuously). Add in 1 \u00bd teaspoon of turmeric powder & 1 teaspoon  cumin powder. Saut\u00e9 & mix well to let the spices release their  aroma. Add quartered potatoes, carrots, & 2 small bay leaves. Mix  well.\n5. **Deglaze:**  Pour in 200 ml of coconut milk & 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce,  completely deglaze the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.\n6. **Pressure Cook Portuguese Chicken and Rice:**  Place a steamer rack into the pressure cooker and carefully place a  bowl with (250g OR 1 cup + 1 \u00bd tablespoon) of Jasmine rice onto the  rack. Pour (230 ml OR 1 cup minus 1 \u00bd tablespoon) of water into the bowl  of rice. Make sure all the rice are soaked with water. Immediately  close lid and cook at High Pressure for 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and  Full Natural Release. Manually release the remaining pressure by  carefully turning the venting knob to the venting position. Open lid  carefully.\n7. **Optional Flavor Enhancing Step - Preheat Oven:** While the Portuguese chicken and rice is cooking in the pressure cooker, preheat oven to 425\u00b0F.\n8. **Thicken Coconut Sauce:** Fluff  rice and set aside to allow it to cool down. If you are making the  optional fried rice, preheat a wok or skillet on high heat with 2  tablespoons of peanut oil. Turn heat to medium (Instant Pot: Press saut\u00e9  button). Add green pepper, cook for one minute, taste the seasoning.  Add more light soy sauce, coconut milk, or salt if desired. Mix the  cornstarch with water and mix it into the coconut sauce one third at a  time until desired thickness. Turn off the heat.\n9. **Optional Flavor Enhancing Steps - Fried Rice:**  When the oil starts to smoke, add in the fluffed rice and press them  against the wok with a wok chuan (wok spatula) to separate the rice from  each other. Repeat for roughly 20 - 30 seconds. Add 1 beaten  extra-large egg on top of the rice and quickly stir-fry the rice to  allow the beaten egg to coat the rice evenly. Stir-fry for another  minute until fragrant, then season with sea salt. Mix well and turn off  the heat.\n10. **Optional Oven Step:**  Fill an oven-safe container half-way full with fried rice. Fill up the  container with Portuguese chicken and vegetables. Add grated cheese (as  much as you like!) over the top and place into oven for 5 \u2013 10 minutes.\n11. **Serve:** Remove from oven and serve immediately"]}

I find black beans don't need a soak and taste better without one.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBean cooking time can be changed by the age of the bean.  Old beans can take longer then fresher beans.  check if there are any dates on the packaging.  Also, be wary of any acid.  A couple of tomatoes in a bean recipe and you'll be there for 2 days.  My favorite veggie chili recipe you cook black beans to 90% done, add your tomato mixture then basically cook them for the original amount of time again.   Acid slows bean softening to a \\*crawl\\*", "My suggestion would be to cook it longer.\nMake sure you are beginning time after the pot comes to the right pressure.\n\nAlso do not use any vinegar as seasoning until the beans are finished cooking. It'll toughen up the beans.", "I do 30 mins just the beans, water,  little bit of oil and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. then slow release the pressure.  \n\nAdd onions, salt and let simmer for 30 mins more without the lid.\n\nThey always turn out great!", "I have an instant pot. I don't pre soak my black beans. It takes about 20 minutes for them to cook.", "Yes, you're doing many things wrong if your goal is a consistent cooking time and texture for black beans.  \n\nThe first problem is that you could be using hard tap water that has a relatively large amount of dissolved minerals such as calcium and magnesium.  These minerals reinforce the outer cell walls of the beans and slow down the hydration of the proteins and starches in the middle of the beans.  The solutions to this problem is to buy a water softener or reverse osmosis filtration system to remove these minerals or to use water without them, such as distilled water.  Filtered water doesn't necessarily have fewer minerals and may in fact have more if the filtration method is merely using activated carbon filter.  The taste of the water can be significantly affected by the presence or absence of various minerals.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11318912](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11318912)\n\nPre-soaking the beans makes the cooking process quicker, more reliable, and keeps more beans intake good condition after cooking.   Is it necessary?  No, but then don't be surprised if the cooking time varies due to hard water without pre-soaking.  Use distilled water to to pressure cook the beans and they should be fully cooked in less than 40 minutes, but then they may be very bland and flavorless.  Dump the water, rinse the beans, and then you can use filtered water with salt, seasonings, and flavorings to let them absorb them from the liquid.", "For me personally I find that even though it's a hassle, soaking the beans overnight and then 20 mins in the pressure cooker leaves the beans perfectly soft... And if you do enough at a time you can keep the rest in the fridge for a while unseasoned... I always \"season\" the beans, once cooked, with fried garlic, fried onions and salt also a bay leaf sometimes. To thicken the liquid part of the beans, I take a few spoonfuls of the beans out with a slotted spoon, mush them up with a fork on a plate and throw that back in and mix it up ... Yum! (source : picked this up in Brazil!)", "If your water is acidic they won't soften. Don't add any acids like vinegar or lime juice until the end. You can even add a sprinkle of baking soda to help them soften.\n\nIf your beans are very old and withered, like more than two years they won't soften.", "In my instant pot, I cook unsoaked black beans for like 60 minutes on high. I do 30, add sofrito, then 30 more. I\u2019ve read that salt makes it take longer. Could account for the different times you are seeing.", "Even soaking for a few hours can help too. I'm not a great planner but if I soak around breakfast or lunch and cook around dinner, it's enough to get a quicker cook time.", "I am at a higher elevation & and I have to pressure cook my dry black beans for 35 - 40 minutes.  Recipes will say 30 but I always end up adding another 5-10 minutes.  I'm guess that the timing varies depending on the age of the beans.", "You gotta soak 'em to bring the time down, there is no shortcut I'm afraid."]}

I'll try the steam cleaning first.", "The silicone-\"compound\" used for the Instant Pot rings just will absorb stronger odors.  And if the IP is kept closed all the time, rather than lid crooked back or turned upside down, the odor will definitely be noticeable when it's opened up again.\n\nWhether to wash the ring after every use is a personal preference.  Some people do it every time without fail, many do it only when they feel it's needed (from odor or from cooking ingredients used or spew, etc).  Surprisingly many people say that using a ring-with-odor doesn't affect other foods cooked later, but some feel it will with sweeter or more neutral foods like cheesecake, yogurt, etc, so may order a 2nd ring to use only for those foods.\n\nPersonally I don't wash the ring separately after each use, but it does get pretty well washed if/when I wash the underside of the lid (when needed).  The dish brush gets all behind and around the ring fairly easily while the ring is still in place, then all the soap gets rinsed out afterward.\n\nAll kinds of ways have been suggested for de-odorizing the ring too, from soaking in baking soda or vinegar to hanging somewhere in the sun (and UV light), and many more.  \n\nI'd also add that using *Bar Keeper's Friend* on the inside bottom of the inner pot especially, is a favorite cleaner/etc of many owners of Instant Pots (and for all stainless steel).

Press START to begin pressure cooking.\n\n5. At the end of the cooking period allow 10 minutes of natural pressure release.

I describe the phenomena here in detail (plus give my own story - which led me to look into the science behind the result):[https://www.hippressurecooking.com/meat-openings-pcs/](https://www.hippressurecooking.com/meat-openings-pcs/)", "What kind of effect are you asking about? Natural release takes more time, so it continues to the cook the food throughout the duration of the release period; rapid release continues to cook for a lesser period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFew other questions: Are you asking about nutritional benefits or something? What kind of meat?", "There appears to be very limited information about this online. I checked my copy of The Food Lab and there\u2019s no mention of it there. It\u2019s not really discussed in Modernist Cuisine at Home either. I did, however, find some mention of this topic in my 2008 edition of Vickie Smith\u2019s *Miss Vickie\u2019s Big Book of Pressure Cooking Recipes*. On page 59 she states, \u201cUsing the quick-release or cold water release rather than the recommended natural release method results in dry, tough meats. The rapid depressurization causes the meat fibers to contract. Although the meat fibers relax somewhat after a 10-minute resting period, the meat is never as tasty and tender as when pressure comes down naturally.\u201d Unfortunately her statement isn\u2019t really backed up by any empirical testing or other cited sources. \n\nHipPressureCooking.com\u2019s Laura Pazzaglia\u2019s (u/pazzaglia1) theory that evaporation is the culprit doesn\u2019t appear to be backed by any empirical testing either. While water content can affect the perceived juiciness of meat, it\u2019s usually muscle fiber structure and the breakdown of connective tissue that affects the perceived tenderness of a piece of cooked meat.\n\nI suspect that the added cooking time involved with the natural release method is the underlying cause of texture differences in pressure-cooked meats. While meat temperature and resting are important when cooking steaks, high temp braises are a different game. I will run some tests this weekend to see if I can come up with some evidence to support my hypothesis. I\u2019ll report back once I have some results.", "Here's a more practical use of the scientific method rather than relying merely on what other people say about it: conduct your own experiment to gather data about it.  Your hypothesis will be: \"Rapid pressure release has a different effect on meat than natural release.\"  I know of an specific experiment that will help to partially confirm this hypothesis.   Get several packs of different kinds of hotdogs and sausages, particularly ones with natural casings like Nathans, Hebrew National, etc.    Pressure cook one of each for one minute and then do the different kind of pressure release for each experiment, as well as another that merely cooks them at a rapid boil for one minute without pressure as a control.  If you have a stovetop pressure cooker, you can also do a cold-water release method as an additional experiment.\n\nIn my experience, many of these hotdogs will completely rupture as if exploded when doing quick release, but will usually remain intact when doing a natural release.   The exploded ones will lose a lot of their moisture and flavor compared to the intact ones where the juices have been retained better inside the casing.  However, the meat itself may not be significantly different in texture because it was already seasoned with salt and spices that can help the protein retain moisture instead of becoming dry.  Meat that hasn't been brined or seasoned could behave differently, as well as different kinds of meat.  Pressure cooking filet mignon, ribeye, chuck steak, and perhaps different kinds of meat like fish, pork tenderloin, pork butt roast, chicken, and  brined/unbrined variations will add additional data that could reveal differences in the effect of pressure release methods.\n\nWith regards to the hotdogs and sausages, my own experience leads me to conclude that some the water inside the meat itself actually converts to steam when during a rapid pressure release, but this doesn't happen with a natural release, even though they both reach the same cooking temperature.   The slower release of pressure seems to allow the meat to cool down without causing the internal moisture of the meat to generate steam.  \n\nMerely bringing the food up to 15psi and 250deg.F. may have its own effects of different kinds of meat like filet mignon (compared to only cooking up to medium rare doneness), but having some of the moisture inside the meat convert to steam seems to have a much more dramatic effect on the texture than the temperature alone.", "I have been using a stovetop pressure cooker for many years to cook meat, generally using the ultra+quick release of holding the pot under the kitchen faucet. I do not get rubbery fibers or whatever. One of the biggest drawbacks to the instant pot is the mess made during quick release, or the long time required for natural release. I use it often enough because it is so hands-off, but I use quick release if I'm in a hurry. The food is cooked and perfectly edible. I generally don't use dry meats like pork loin or chicken breast, maybe they're more touchy.", "The boiling temperature is higher under pressure. If you do a quick release it allows the content to boil. Natural release allows the pot to cool slowly without ever boiling.  More tender meat results. \n\n"]}

Pressure cooking deserves respect for the power involved.\n\nBut pressure cooking can be very safe with modern safety devices and education about the proper use and maintenance of the equipment.  I've been using pressure cookers for more than 20 years very safely and without any close calls.\n\nFor stovetop pressure cookers, the most important thing is to be attentive and (1) reduce the heat after reaching full pressure to merely maintain pressure and (2) set a timer and monitor the process to ensure that you turn it off at the proper time or when observing any potential problems.   Most stovetop pressure cooker accidents are due to inattention or ignorance, by leaving them on high heat, forcing open the lid while under pressure, forgetting to turn off the heat, or not observing the warning signs of problems - like when food starts spraying out of the valve or the steam stops being released because the valve gets clogged.\n\nElectric pressure cookers automatically lower the heat to maintain pressure.  They will also automatically detect more problems.  They will automatically shut off or go into warming mode when the cooking program completes.  But the valve can still get clogged with food and idiots can still attempt to force the lid open.  People can also accidentally drop them when moving, or accidentally cause a fire by having a burner turn on when the cooker is put on top of it on the range top.

And the humongous Facebook group for the IP (although there are many IP groups at Facebook) has loads of info, recipes, how-to's in the posts as well as in the Files section, and you can ask questions there any time and get many answers (usually quite quickly):  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/InstantPotCommunity\n\nAs for ribs and potatoes specifically, I guess those could be cooked at the same time but ribs will usually take a bit longer under pressure than whole potatoes.  There are ways to equalize those things though since using NR (natural release) after the pressure cooking time is finished allows the foods to cook a little longer (automatically) than QR (quick release, immediate release)...for example, I cook my ribs (in an IP *electric* pc) for 35 min of pressure + QR, and a good sized raw whole potato might take 20 min + NR, so those might come close to evening out, or you could use something like 25 min + NR and hope that would work for both. (That's using 1 cup water in the bottom of the pot for either/both.) \n\nRibs are usually pressure cooked first, then removed and slathered with bbq or other sauce, then put under the broiler 10-15 min to caramelize and thicken the sauce before eating. So you could instead pressure cook the ribs and potato sequentially: cook the ribs and remove, then cook the potato while slathering ribs with sauce and broiling.  \n\nPressure cooking relies on the thickness and the density of foods for determining the pressure time btw.  So if you cut the potato so it was thinner than whole, it would take less time to pressure cook (which could speed up the time needed for cooking it, after the ribs for example). \n\nNote that frozen meats/foods can be set for the same pressure times as fresh/thawed versions of the same type and thickness, but frozen ones will have a longer \"coming to pressure\" period (automatically).  That's only important in this case because the potato would be getting more *heating* time because the ribs were frozen, and although it's not pressure time, heating will still be adding a bit to the total cooking time the potato will get.\n\nAnother way to make \"pre-made\" meals would be simply to make a bunch of something (one-pot meal, or not), then put single portions into ziptop freezer bags (or use a Foodsaver, etc) and freeze (preferably flat so can \"stack\" later).  You could do that whether you used a pressure cooker or more conventional ways (stovetop, oven, Dutch oven pot, microwave, etc).  \nThen when needing a pre-made dinner, just remove one from the freezer and microwave or reheat in other ways (if in a microwave, you'd want to remove the food from ziptop perhaps after running water over to loosen and put in a bowl or plate to reheat...if using a Foodsaver, those bags can be microwaved in the bag if cut a corner off first or put in simmering water in a pot on the stove with no cuts necessary).  \n\n", "Yes.  Look in the lower right of this page.  Under \"Recipe Sources\" you'll find really valuable web sites to get you started.  Good luck!", "My daughter has always refused to learn to cook. Since I got the pressure cooker, she's been cooking most nights. I'm not sure why it appeals to her so much, but it's nice.\n\nThe thing it's hard to understand about pressure cookers until you have one is that the cook times are short but it takes time to get up to pressure before the cook time starts, and depending on what you cook you need to let it set a while after cooking stops. Do you might cook macaroni in five minutes but it's really going to take twenty. When I cook meat, I cook about three pounds and it takes an hour, plus the time to come to pressure. So it's not as fast as microwaving a tv dinner but it's faster than cooking the same things in the oven or crock pot and cooking pasta or potatoes in it is nice because it doesn't steam up the house.", "Before you get an Instant Pot (I'm so glad I bought mine), watch Flo Lum's YouTube channel for inspiration....she uses the Bluetooth enabled Smart Pot....", "I'm a very lazy cook, pressure cookers make life so simple. Throw in ingredients with very little prep, set the timer and come back to tasty food.\n\nAs you learn you can experiment with different things, preparing the ingredients and stuff more, but for a beginner they're great.\n\nI would definitely recommend an electric pressure cooker rather than a stovetop one though, especially being new to cooking.

I checked mine and didn't see much that was concerning.  The worst of the reports was that a user opened the steam valve and nothing came out, but the lid wouldn't open so he forced it with a screwdriver and it blew steam and hot food in his face.  That sounds horrible, but the user did bypass the built-in safety system in order to make it happen.\n\nI'm no expert, but I think the basic safety advice is:\n\n* Keep your steam valve clean.\n\n* If you just cooked something and no steam comes out, don't be a dummy--unplug and wait for the unit to depressurize naturally before opening.\n\n* Never, ever, force the lid.  It should be very easy to turn and if it isn't, the unit is pressurized.\n\nAlso:  http://cookingequipment.about.com/od/pressurecookers/a/PressureCookerSafe.htm\n\n", "It was the old models of stovetop pressure cookers that got a reputation for \"exploding\" but even then it was caused by someone (usually a reasonably-strong male) forcing the lid open before all pressure had been released.  Then the very hot food/liquid in the pot could spew up and out (even onto the ceiling) and burn any skin in its path; the pot itself never \"exploded\" though (however, if packed with explosives as might happen in a terrorist situation the pots themselves would also explode).\n\nIn the last 20 years or so however, pressure cookers have much-improved safety features which make that almost impossible (though a *really* strong person might manage it if determined), and almost all *electric* pressure cookers (which started being made after that period) have multiple safety locks/features to prevent it (I know the Instant Pot brand has a load of them, and I'd assume a brand like Cuisinart would too, but perhaps some of the cheap and/or unknown-brands aren't quite as robust?).\n\nAs for things that don't cook well in a pressure cooker, for one that would include foods that require \"dry\" cooking and/or browning (cooking in hot air, over flames, or in oil) since pressure cookers are moist cooking environments.  Pressure cookers can be used like any large pot though and cook with oil to brown or just saute if desired (and sometimes that's done in addition to pressure cooking afterward), or any browning can be done after pressure cooking (in the oven usually).   \nThey also won't work for \"baking\" grain-based products like bread/cakes/etc, except that some of those can actually be steamed (often in metal which browns them a bit).  \nAlso pressure cookers cook so quickly (but also take a few minutes to build pressure) that just using one to cook fairly well chopped broccoli for example, would possibly be more trouble than it's worth unless also cooking other things along with it or after/before it. \n\n", "Instant pots are the best."]}

I've decided to order a Tefal stovetop pressure cooker, looking forward to trying it out!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/hc85cn/how_to_convert_instant_pot_recipes_to_stovetop/", "created_utc": 1592598543.0, "score": 35, "author": "Selzar62", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/hc85cn/how_to_convert_instant_pot_recipes_to_stovetop/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["The rule of thumb seems to be that electric pressure cookers need longer time under pressure due to lower PSI (some newer models like the Instant Pot Max can apparently do the same 15 PSI as stovetop cookers, so this may become a moot point), and also that you might have to allow for extra carryover cooking time from it taking longer to heat up and cool down to release pressure after cooking due to being more insulated? So presumably, you'd have to adjust for stovetop based on that.\n\nBruce Weinstein & Mark Scarbrough's _The Great Big Pressure Cooker Cookbook_ is one of the few that I've seen that gives a dual set of instructions with modifications as necessary for both stovetop and electric, and the timing for the latter is consistently 20-30% longer. Other cookbooks like Jill Nussinow's _Vegan Under Pressure_ are geared towards one or the other (Nussinow's is stovetop), but will drop a general mention about timing changes.\n\nLaura Pazzaglia, author of _Hip Pressure Cooking_, has a [comparative timing chart for basic ingredients](https://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooking-times/) on her website which covers different sizes and models of stovetop and electric. Her recipes (and presumably also her cookbook, which is on my wishlist but I've never read) also give dual timings as appropriate.\n\nThere are also well-regarded older cookbooks from Lorna J. Sass and Marguerite Patten and L. D. Michaels (sometimes cheap on sale as ebook reprints) and others who worked with stovetop-only in the pre-Instant Pot era, that you could check for more recipe ideas and tricks that can apparently only be done with a stovetop model (like running the cooker under cold water to help speed up the depressurization, IIRC).", "It\u2019s really just minor experimentation with heat settings. I have a small Lagostina, a larger T-Fal Clipso and a big Viking stove top. I generally use high pressure and depending on cook time. \n\nAssuming you\u2019ve used a stovetop try and reverse the steps you think they\u2019d use in so far as browning if it says to brown anything. If it says like 10 minutes cook time generally assume that to be from when it\u2019s pressurized. \n\nYou\u2019ll likely have better results than the instapot once you get used to it.", "I'm pretty used to converting IC recipes for my stovetop PC, but I'd say it's more important that you take the time to learn how to use the model you buy.\n\nWhat I mean by that is, for chicken thighs, 20 mins on high pressure will make them fork shreddable. If I want it to maintain it's form more, I cook it 10-15 on high. I know it takes about 7 min on low pressure to make risotto how I like it. It's 40 on high for black beans (from dry) to get them to the texture I like.\n\nOnce you have these sorts of basics down, you can look at the ingredients in an IC recipe and pretty much know exactly what you need to do. \n\nIf you have an example of a recipe you'd like to make that is geared towards the IC, post it here and I'm happy to provide guidance.\n\nOther random advice: \n\n- A lot of mediocre PC dishes have you add ingredients before you seal it up. Figuring out when it's better to add them afterwards (or prepare them in a separate pan and add them at the very end) is what will lead you to perfect results.\n\n- Once the cooker comes to pressure, lower the heat to medium/medium-low (or whatever the minimum amount to maintain pressure is). Keeping it medium-high or above can often lead to food burning/sticking.\n\nHappy to answer any other questions!", "I would say that you\u2019d probably just have to cook it in less time for stovetop PC. With stovetop, it\u2019s nice cause you can put the whole thing in the sink and just run cold water over it if you need to do a QR. When I first got my stovetop PC and I was converting non PC recipes for it, I found I could cut the time to 1/3. For IP i cut the time to 1/2.", "For most recipes - meaning those where you cook longer than 5 minutes and have a natural release - you should be able to use the recipes interchangeably. \n\nThe IP cooks at lower pressure...but because the inner cooking pot is insulated, it also takes longer for the pressure to release than with a stovetop PC. So it basically comes out even. \n\nIf you are doing a more delicate recipe (shrimp), you may need to just find a stovetop PC cookbook and use their timing. You should probably do that anyway; you don't need to convert the entire recipe; you just need to know the timing needed for the particular meat or vegetable.\n\nAfter you use it for a while, though, you'll figure out some very simple rules of thumb; a recipe with beef cut in 1\" cubes will always (I think) take the same amount of time (which I've forgotten...20 or 30 minutes with natural release). Beef cut into roughly 1 lb chunks will take an hour; a 3lb chuck roast or brisket or corned beef will take around 90 minutes. (I usually like my meat fork-shreddable, though). \n\nThere are two caveats to keep in mind, though. First, I find that a lot of PC cookbooks understate how long things should be cooked. Possibly because they want to make the PC seem more convenient, or possibly because they just have different preferences. \n\nThe second is: if you have an electric stove, you shouldn't get a stovetop PC. It's hard not to burn anything tomato based in it, for one (sometimes you can work around this); and when the PC reaches pressure, instead of just turning down the burner like you can with gas, you have to have turned on a second burner on \"low\", and then slide the PC to that burner when the button pops up. (And watch for a bit to make sure that the burner is hot enough to maintain pressure, but not too hot).", "Buy a good stainless steel pressure cooker and it will work for years with no issue. Additionally you can remove the lid and use it as a stand alone pot or pan as well depending on the size the you're getting. Just one thing to check is that make sure it is compatible with induction cooktops as well. That ways you won't have to worry about anything in future.", "FWIW, most of the T-FAL pressure cookers run at the same 12PSI that the Instant Pots do. I am very happy with my 8 Qt. T-FAL.", "Can I ask why not just get an instant pot? There's a reason they're so popular, they're FAR more convenient than a stovetop one and relatively inexpensive."]}

It all depends on the amount of extra moisture, fat, and gelatin that's available to mix into the meat while you're chewing or better, that you mix in before hand to fully absorb to saturate it.  Oxtail and neck bone usually have enough fat and gelatin to moisten the meat as you're eating it.  The gelatin comes from the collagen in the connective tissue that's cooked long enough with water to convert it.   After the meat is cooked, use a sharp knife to cut it against the grain to keep the strands short, then shred it into the cooking liquid to let it absorb the moisture, fat and gelatin.  An electric knife is particularly good for this because it will slice right through the meat with very little pressure, since the serrated pair of blades move back and forth against each other to slice instead of chop.   \n\nAfter cooking I've often set the pressure cooker to warming mode for 99 hours so that the leftovers are ready to use up for the next several meals.  I always finish them long before the 99 hours are up.  For me, it has never burned because I ensure that there's enough liquid left to prevent it from thickening too much and boiling dry.", "I believe it depends on if the meat is fatty or not. I would imagine oxtail would be tough to overcook.", "I never managed to, but I never cooked it for longer than 1 hour on max pressure.", "I don't have an answer, but another question:  Do you pre-boil your oxtail several times before putting it into the pressure cooker?

I pressure cooked something sold as \"stew meat\" which I assume is a mixture of chuck and round scraps, and they were dry and flavorless after cooking at 15 PSI for 15-20 minutes with NPR. Even 7 minutes was a bit too much. Maybe I just did something wrong, you guys tell me.", "I usually cook oxtail or neck bone (beef or pork) till the desired tenderness. Leftovers are kept in the fridge and reheated at meal time. I didn't notice any difference in the taste or texture. If cooked too long, then yes, the meat will be too tender to be good.", "yeah..

{"title": "Pot roast: The best thing I've ever made in my PC", "selftext": "I've never had pot roast that was half this flavorful. Perhaps I shouldn't oversell it, but I made this for some friends along with some steamed brussels sprouts and some baguettes that I baked myself and it's easily in the top 10 best things I've ever eaten.\n\nIt's basically just [this](http://www.pressurecookingtoday.com/classic-pot-roast-and-potatoes/) recipe without the tomato paste and mushrooms. I tried it with tomato paste a couple weeks ago and didn't think it was as good. I have not tried it with mushrooms but I'm sure they would be good.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n\n2.5lb chuck roast. The one that looks like a huge steak.\n\n\nkosher salt\n\n\ncoarse ground black pepper (I buy the big things of Tone's \"restaurant\" coarse pepper at Sam's Club)\n\nOne medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped\n\n\n1-2 TBSP butter\n\n\n3-4 TBSP vegetable oil\n\n\n3 cups beef broth\n\n\n1.5lbs bite-size potatoes\n\n1) Season the roast moderately with kosher salt and heavily with pepper.\n\n\n2) Get a big skillet screaming hot with a few tbsps of vegetable oil and THEN add the roast, being careful not to splash hot oil on yourself. Brown thoroughly on all sides. Keep sliding the roast around while it's browning to get it evenly browned. Tongs work well for manipulating it. On my stove this takes a couple minutes per side. I gave up on browning things in the PC itself. I have a Presto 6qt rocker top and it's just too small and it's not nonstick.\n\n\n3) Transfer the roast into the pressure cooker. It will barely fit in mine - I had to squish it in a bit to get it flat. I always use the little steamer rack on the bottom because I've had meat burn on the bottom in the past.\n\n\n4) Add the onion and butter to the skillet. Keep the stove on high or perhaps turn it down just a little to medium high. Cook the onion for a few minutes until it starts to brown. Try to scrape up the leftover pepper etc from browning the roast and incorporate it into the onion mixture. Next time I might throw in just a little stock or something at the end to deglaze the pan and help pick up all of that flavor.\n\n\n5) Add the onion to the PC\n\n\n6) Add the beef stock and the potatoes to the PC\n\n\n7) Pressure cook for 50 minutes and then do a natural release. \n\n\nThe one weak spot in this is the potatoes - they are OK, but they don't absorb the flavor as well as I'd like. Maybe if I poked them with a fork next time... \n\nIf you don't like to have a bunch of juice/sauce with your food you can back off on the stock quantity a little. I like to have a ton of juice to soak up with bread and so that I can get some meat and juice in every bite.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/5nl0xg/pot_roast_the_best_thing_ive_ever_made_in_my_pc/", "created_utc": 1484245568.0, "score": 36, "author": "Obvious0ne", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/5nl0xg/pot_roast_the_best_thing_ive_ever_made_in_my_pc/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["How are your potatoes not mash after that long in the cooker? I usually pull the meat out and then add potatoes (and carrots) and then just cook them 4-5 minutes, natural release. I used peeled, thick sliced russets. It's possible if you're using whole unpeeled potatoes that's why they aren't absorbing flavor and can survive the duration. \n\nAlso, I make gravy from the juices -- once the potatoes come out, add some water and cornstarch slurry and bring to a boil for a couple minutes. ", "Most of my PC work is along these lines and if you don't mind I have a couple of suggestions. It's not a good idea to brown meat with pepper, you will develop bitter flavors. Add pepper to the liquid then finish with some fresh ground pepper after pressure release. The tomato paste and mushrooms are there to develop umami. Another great way is to use a little bit of fish sauce, don't worry it won't taste like fish at the end. For myself I will rarely do beef without tossing in a branch of fresh rosemary which I remove after pressure release. I love your post and it's stuff like this that made me fall in love with the PC. Oh, and I usually chop my potatos in half but I think poking them with a fork is a good idea too.", "I do a lamb roast the same way, but the main difference is i cook the meat and onion for about 30 mins in the PC, then open, throw in the potatoes and carrots and cook for another 30 mins. Stops the potatoes and carrots from going too mushy", "I know I'm way late to the party here but I'd recommend cutting way back on the oil for browning. Then when you are done browning add about a cup or less of red wine to the still hot pan and scrape loose all the brown goodness off the pan and add it to your cooker. It's a shame to waste all that flavor! \n\nSkip the taters and make roast garlic mashed potatoes separately. \n\nThis is my #1 favorite meal. ", "Caramelizing the onions and browning the meat first are the two best things you can do for flavour, well done! Add a pinch of cumin to this recipe and its pure perfection!

But I'd still quibble with a few things he said.   The points and \"Wins\" he gives would also depend on who the user is, what they're making most of the time, and what's important for them.  \n\nJust as one example, he gives a Win to stovetop pc's over electric pc's in the Cleaning category.  I've had both types of pc's and definitely find IP brand at least, easier and quicker to wash. \n\nThe IP's pot is *not* heavy, and it's also a shape that fits easily/quickly in most home sinks, under home faucets, and at angles for rinsing.    \nI even have less trouble washing the IP's lid in the sink since it balances in my hand nicely (and again no long handle to make balancing/turning more difficult). I just use a soapy dish brush for the lid and scrub round and round really quickly, and the top as well.   \nI also don't have to keep up with or separately wash/rinse a stovetop pc's \"weight\" if it has one.   \n   \nThe long handles on many stovetop pc's plus their heavy weight make washing stovetop pots much more difficult for me especially, including shlepping ones with food over to the sink and often back (for quick releasing, and/or for washing), and also when putting away. \nThe stovetop pc's that do have two shorter handles would be better than having one long handle, but still more awkward for washing and they're often more expensive units.    \nKenji is male, young and healthy, and always uses a dishwasher (though the IP can be put in dishwasher if don't mind a bit of the black becoming less black, according to IP)--a few differences from this user.  \n\n(It is true that the silicone-type ring used in the IP holds odors more than stovetops' gaskets, but my sense of smell is unfortunately too good and I never have a problem with odor since I keep the lid cocked back on the pot and partway open, and don't put my head over it and sniff intentionally. Would be a small price to pay for the conveniences though anyway.) \n\n", "I have the Breville Fast Slow Pro and love it. I use it at least twice a week.

The reason being that since they are foamy foods there is a very REAL possibility of clogging the valves.  Now, I've pressure cooked every one of these foods with the exception of the rhubarb, spaghetti and applesauce (well, I've *made* it but I don't think that's what they mean) and they can all be pressure cooked safely with proper precautions.  Those precautions include: no more than 1/2 full, using  Natural Release opening and sometimes tightly controlled liquid quantities and bain marie (pan in pot).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI, for one, am happy to see more pressure cooker recipes on Serious Eats  and as more chefs and cooks tackle the pressure cookers we're going to see some bumps in the road in terms of \"perfection.\"  The polite thing to do is inform them privately about the error to give them the opportunity to correct it.

If you are cooking the meat in the liquid, you can scale it with the recipe.", "https://fastcooking.ca/pressure_cookers/cooking_times_pressure_cooker.php\n\nMost chicken sold in grocery stores is tender meat, previously classified as fryers, one of three tender meats such as broilers and roasters, opposed to tougher and older meat classified as stewers that can use tenderizing for stews and soups. \n\n[Chickens: What is the difference between fryers, broilers and stewers?](http://eatstayfarm.com/2019/10/chickens-what-is-the-difference-between-fryers-broilers-and-stewers/)\n\nTender meats don't require tenderizing and don't benefit from long cooking times.  They should be cooked as little as possible and only get tougher with overcooking.   In other words, the prime objective with tender chicken is to cook it as little as needed to achieve a safe internal temperature of about 160-165deg.F. and no more.  If the temperature exceeds that range, then it's important to not leave it hotter for a long time and to get it cooler as soon as you can.\n\nThese are completely different objectives than used for tough stewing meats.   So that's why the cooking time chart used cannot be for all \"meat\" in general.  You must consider the nature of the meat being cooked or you'll probably get very bad results by applying the wrong cooking method.\n\nYou also can't use weight to adjust the timing for pressure cooking meat for anything except large roasts.   If meat is diced, chopped,  ground/minced, de-boned, filleted, or butterflied, then the heat of the pressure cooker may be able to easily penetrate into the center of the meat very quickly, so no additional time needs to be added to allow for it.\n\nTherefore, 3.11 pounds of diced, boneless chicken takes only 5 minutes to cook with a quick pressure release, especially if the chicken is mixed with other ingredients such as rice or vegetables.   \n\nThis means that pressure cooking is fabulous for dishes such as Arroz Con Pollo and other chicken & rice recipes like Cajun Dirty Rice, Jambalaya, Cheesy Chicken Rice and Broccoli, etc.   You can make a small or large pot of these recipes in only 6 minutes or so at pressure.  You could feed a whole crowd in less than 10 minutes with a delicious, flavorful, and filling meal, with no preparation at all using any appropriate ingredients that you happen to have on hand, so long as you have enough rice put away.  It helps to have some powdered chicken bouillon for quick seasoning of the rice.

While I love my instant pot for most tasks,^(\u2020) and while pressure steaming eggs in the instant pot still beats conventional cooking, it was never quite as good as my old stove-top, and I think I figured out why.\n\nI don't think it's the pressure. My stovetop cooker does 90 KPa (about 13 psi over ambient) which I recall being a wee bit higher than the instant pot. My experience adapting recipes is that the slightly slower cooking speed in the instant pot is next to nothing.\n\nWhile it's a small sample size, (because I only did two eggs for breakfast) I think the key is the ability to do a really quick release.

The sharp temperature difference shocks the eggs once submerged, and has two important benefits: It stops cooking immediately and makes the eggs easier to peel.\n\nEven once a pot of boiled eggs is taken off the heat, they continue to cook due to carryover cooking \u2014 the continued rise is temperature is caused by the retained heat in the eggs and water. It can often be just enough to take a hard-boiled egg from [perfectly cooked](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-boil-eggs-perfectly-every-time-video-202415) to overcooked. Using an ice bath to shock the eggs and immediately cool them completely stops any further cooking.\n\nPlunging just-cooked hard-boiled eggs into an ice bath is also an important step in making them easier to peel.

Better to use chicken thigh and leg meat that you brine in advance and cook the minimum necessary to be safe, to preserve their flavor and tenderness.  Most chicken is already moist and tender when raw, so the trick is to preserve that tenderness and moisture.   Chicken fully cooks quickly when it's boneless, diced, seasoned, and then sauteed briefly in oil in only a couple of minutes.   Cooking longer than that risks dry, rubbery meat.  It doesn't require long stewing times to tenderize it.\n\nRice will only be crunchy if your liquid ratio is wrong or your pressure cooker is defective, releasing all the steam, and never coming up to pressure.

I purchased an electric pressure cooker about four years and had not used the stovetop unit since. I now have two 6qt Instant Pots (Smart and LUX), 4qt Fagor Lux, 3qt Instant Pot Mini Duo and a 2qt Cosori. So much for reducing the number of appliances in my kitchen. That said, it is not unusual to have a 2-3 going at the same time. \n\nThe smaller units I like for making yogurt. I do 24 hour cycle on yogurt so is nice to have a spare cooker for that reason alone. The Instant pot allows setting yogurt cycle for 24 hours while the 2qt Cosori can be set for up to 14 hours. Not a big deal but a consideration if you make yogurt. \n\nThe smaller units come to pressure a little quicker so it nice for a quick lunch soup or \"baked\" potato. The 6qt units would do a fine job in these cases but take a little longer to hit pressure. In our household of two people, I tend to grab the smaller units to cook meals. If I am cooking a roast large enough to use in several other dishes or a whole chicken, I go with 6qt units. I cook meals for three dogs every other day and use the 6 qt cookers for that too. When we travel, I pack the 4qt unit.\n\nThe \"keep warm\" cycle on electric cookers is your friend. When cooking roasts, stews, beans or anything that holds up well in slow cooking, I cook under pressure and then let it sit in warm mode for hours. This is the only way I have been able to end up with flavorful, moist and tender chicken breasts (3-4 minutes of pressure depending on size of chicken breasts). With leaving dish on warm mode, it seems the flavors continue to develop a bit more. This has been a happy discovery from unplanned delayed meals and now an active plan in letting warm mode finish.\n\nEach cooker I have has advantages in some way depending on what is cooking. The 4qt Fagor Lux is creeping up my list on overall favorite though. It seems quick to pressure up, has a really nice ceramic pot which is easy to clean and is not showing wear after all the use it's gotten. The 4qt size allows me to cook a little extra to share or for leftovers. As with Instant Pot, Fagor has parts available and customer service experiences have been favorable. If I wanted to replace the 6qt LUX Instant Pot, I would seriously consider upgrading to the Fagor brand because of my experience with the 4qt unit. I just recently purchased the 3qt Instant Pot and really like it too. It would work well for a single person and is big enough to cook multiple servings. \n\n", "don't judge, but aldi has them for $40 right now. it's not an instant pot, but it does the job. good place to start at least.", "I use it for myself and other people, doesn't matter, can be used for 1 to 50 people.\n\nIt's worth it, get it.

{"title": "Instant Pot woes. Slow cooker and rice cooker functions are not impressing me thus far. How wrong am I doing it?", "selftext": "Greetings! \n\n\n\n\nGot my Instant Pot a few weeks ago to replace my FAGOR stovetop pressure cooker that failed, as well as a rice steamer/vege steamer, and my slow cooker. I'm a pretty experienced home chef of 40years. \n\n\n\n\nI have made rice in it twice so far, 2 to 1 water to rice ratio, and the rice has come out a little too wet both times. Am I supposed to cook rice using the rice setting with the vent in to open position? I am pretty sure the manual says to have it closed. \n\n\n\n\nThe slow cooker function seems to have too low a temp. I made a 3.5 to 4 lb pork butt a couple weeks ago, left it on \"normal\"....(medium), and it took 10 to 11 hrs to cook through. Even after that time it was still not that fall apart rich succulence that I used to get in the slow cooker. I am making a pork butt right now, and using the \"more\" setting. Its been 7 hours and the pork is not quite  cooked through. I have had the vent open to get some moisture out, should I have it closed? The slow cooker I got rid of produced a liquid simmer on low and the butt was cooked through at 4 -5 hours. I have no such simmer with the Instant Pot with the vent open. I've closed it now and await new results. \n\n\n\n\nMy biggest gripe so far is the pressure cooking method for vege. In my stovetop FAGOR I could cook 1/2 to 1lb of Broccoli/Green Beans/Cauliflower in 1/4C water for 3 to 4 minutes and have the most awesome tasting/most awesome textured vege ever. In the Instant Pot I use the manual function for 1 min and its overcooked. I have only used the high pressure setting though, hopefully the lower setting will yield better results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Instant Pot is said to have a learning curve, so I am trying to learn.

Are you using a steamer basket, doing pot in pot cooking, or setting it right in the water?", "Play with the water ratio for your rice. I eat rice from the pressure cooker almost every day, it has always been the best rice that I've made.", "Water ratio with rice in the pressure cooker depends a lot on the type of rice you are cooking.\n\nI tend to cook rice with a 1.5 to 1 water to rice ratio with the vent closed and with a natural release and it turns out quite well, but I only cook 1 cup of rice. I find that a natural release lets the rice soak up a bit more water and prevents it from being too wet.\n\nHere is what I follow when cooking different types of rice: http://www.hippressurecooking.com/easy-pressure-cooker-steamed-rice/", "I've had the same problem with the temps when slow cooking. We've only used it a couple of times but we had to put it on high to get the temps needed.", "I use this recipe for rice in my Instant Pot, and I haven't had any further issues with overly wet rice.

Every time I made broccoli before, it was mush, but that setting worked much better.", "I do manual pressure for rice,  and I follow the chart in the book that came with the instant pot,  depending on the type. For brown,  it is 2:2.5 and 22 to 27 minutes on high I think", "Re the Slow Cook mode of an IP compared to stand-alone slow cookers:  \nOld slow cookers used to end up cooking at lower temps (over time) than slow cookers manufactured in the last 15-20 years.  That's because too many owners were tossing *big frozen hunks* of meat into slow cookers (against instructions), then some of them were getting sick because the meats had spent too long in the \"danger zone\" of temps (40-140 F), and especially way down in their centers, for longer than 2-4 hours.    \nThough they can vary some, all slow cookers made more recently use those higher effective temps so everything will cook \"faster.\"  Lower temps during slow cooking are actually better for melting the cartilage in meats that profit most from slow cooking though and making the meat moist and most tender (though will take longer).\n\nAs for veggies, as mentioned there is some \"cooking\" going on in the coming-to-pressure time so all but the densest veggies and whole potatoes/winter squashes/root veggies/etc will take a fairly short time (sometime \"0\" minutes of full pressure set on the dial).  Thickness matters too, so *chopped* cauliflower, broccoli, etc, will take less time than bigger pieces, etc.", "For veggies, try 0 min or low pressure. Are you putting veggies on top of the trivet? You can also put veggies in a steamer basket or Pyrex container - that will make the veggies take a bit longer to cook.", "A stovetop pressure cooker is better for some things, particularly for the 3 examples you gave.  A 4qt. or smaller stovetop is faster for rice because it can heat up and cook faster, since you can use a more powerful burner, it has less volume to bring up to pressure, at high pressure it cooks at a higher temp, and the cold water release method is an option to depressure faster and stop cooking more precisely.  It takes only 4-6 minutes at 15 psi to cook white rice.  You merely need to reduce the liquid a bit, as others mentioned.  But it's also manually operated vs. the automatic set and forget modes with keep-warm, so there's a trade-off involved of convenience.  Rice cooks so quickly that the automatic process isn't much of an advantage, in my opinion.\n\nThese stovetop advantages are also important for quick-cooking vegetables, like you described.  The electric ones tend to take longer to get to pressure whilst overcooking the veggies in the process.\n\nI suggest not using the slow-cook mode on a pork butt, since you'll get superior results in 90 minutes or less at the full 15psi of the stove-top, saving a lot of time.  It will be even faster if you dice the pork first.  Dicing the pork lets you trim the excess fat at the same time before cooking and lets the meat absorb any seasonings better.  Dicing gives more surface area for browning in advance, boosting flavor and color of the result.\n\nNot that you can't use the Instant Pot for these recipes, it's just that the balance tips in favor of a stovetop model in my opinion unless you want to set it and forget it."]}

It's difficult to slice without the meat falling all apart on you if it's too tender.  However, an electric knife can easily slice through very tender beef like a hot knife through butter because it has two long serrated blades that slice in opposite directions, keeping the meat together, while the long slicing of a regular carving knife can break the meat apart.\n\nI have cooked large beef and pork roasts up to 8lbs.

{"title": "Understanding minimum and maximum quantities for pressure cookers", "selftext": "We are looking at buy a programmable electric pressure cooker for batch cooking.

Liquidy kinda things that we then put in bags in the freezer and defrost for easy dinners. We want something that will cook those things quicker and with less monitoring so we can dump everything in, walk away, and come back when it's cooked.\n\nI am considering this one: [https://adexa.co.uk/Commercial-Multi-function-Pressure-Cooker-18-litres-1-8kW-Adexa-YBWD18?language=en&currency=GBP&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpeaYBhDXARIsAEzItbGUU7Ti-qciWBa5NYiuAyOtQy9hjoK2RC8-j3N5mYmqNwYqK3BIeNcaAjNkEALw\\_wcB](https://adexa.co.uk/Commercial-Multi-function-Pressure-Cooker-18-litres-1-8kW-Adexa-YBWD18?language=en&currency=GBP&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpeaYBhDXARIsAEzItbGUU7Ti-qciWBa5NYiuAyOtQy9hjoK2RC8-j3N5mYmqNwYqK3BIeNcaAjNkEALw_wcB)\n\nBut I don't really understand how much food we can cook in it at once.

And it says it's 18L, but we can't actually cook 18L of raw stuff in it at a time, can we?\n\nAlso interested in other recommendations for XL pressure cookers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/x8waw7/understanding_minimum_and_maximum_quantities_for/", "created_utc": 1662631113.0, "score": 32, "author": "Napoleon2727", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/x8waw7/understanding_minimum_and_maximum_quantities_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I only have instant pots. The older instant pots had a max fill line, but that was only for cooking without pressure. The manual says that under pressure the pot should never be more that 2/3 full. For things that expand while cooking, I leave room for them to double in size. So when I do rice or pasta I fill my instant pot no more than 1/3 full.\n\nI don't know for sure if that's universal to all electric pressure cookers, but my hunch is yes.", "Those recipes seem to be poor candidates for pressure cooking in large batches because the ingredients cook very quickly, too quickly, so that they will already be fully cooked before the batch can even get to full pressure.   Carrots only take 1 minute to cook at pressure.  It could take 10 times that for a full electric pot to get up to pressure.\n\nElectric pressure cookers using resistive heat elements aren't very efficient or fast at heat transfer.  You'd probably be better off buying a commercial hot water dispenser that holds several gallons and pay for plumbing it for continuous use.  That will eliminate all the waiting time for the water to come to a boil.   A large stainless steel pot with handles and a powerful induction hob would make more sense than a pressure cooker.   For food safety, you should also get a bunch of ice wand/paddles to be able to extract most of the heat quickly before dividing and putting into the freezer.\n\nI'd never suggest buying that pressure cooker you linked for this because it has a non-stick pot instead of stainless steel.\n\nAnother option would be to prep all the ingredients for the soups, portion them out in bags, freeze them (or use prepped frozen veggies), and then pressure cook them as needed to directly serve.  That lets you use a small stovetop pressure cooker on an induction hob + the hot water dispenser.   I could make that carrot soup in literally just a couple of minutes, with at stick blender to puree at the end.  The result would have a much fresher flavor, color and texture than cooking, freezing, and reheating.  Reheating from frozen would probably take longer than pressure cooking this way.\n\nThe lentils also only take several minutes to cook if you soak them first.   You could soak them and then freeze them in proportioned bags in the same way.\n\nI mention this because I frequently make a very good broccoli soup in about 5 minutes.   I get a 2 pound bag of frozen broccoli florets, pour a couple of cups of boiling water on top them in a 4qt stainless stovetop pressure cooker, bring up to pressure on high, reduce heat to cook for 2 minutes.   Then I take the pot to the sink and use a cold water sprayer to do a cold water release method.  This depressurizes the pot in about 30 seconds and helps to get the soup to a better serving temp.    I throw in a little butter, salt, pepper, and Vegeta seasoning, then use an immersion stick blender to puree.   It's soooo creamy and delicious this way.  I transfer some of the soup to a storage container and eat some immediately.  The pot is already in the sink with the sprayer, so I can rinse it out and be completely done in well under 10 minutes.", "The link you provided has a link to user manual. According to that \n\n>\tFor cooking the rice, the maximum quantity of rice for model 3L, 4L, 5L and 6L is 6cups, 8cups, 10cups and 12cups, respectively, and the proportion between the water and rice is 1:1.\n\nThey don\u2019t list 18L but a quick glance tells us probably 2 cups per liter, so you\u2019re looking at whopping 36 cups.\n\nI own a 6 quart (5.6 L) instant pot that I make two cups of rice with and that\u2019s like bare minimum less than an inch of cooked rice in the pot. Less than two cups of rice would probably not even cover the bottom of that massive pot."]}

My advice is buy a 6 qt Instant pot brand secondhand.   There should be Amazon returns, liquidated store merchandise that still has a slight food odor, and store returns available this time of year.      If they go back on sale for $50 or less, either of the Magic Chef electric pressure cookers on [HomeDepot.com](https://HomeDepot.com) are a great value, and probably are made by Midea who makes the IP.   I owned the stainless one that doens't have sous vide. It's a great machine. My sister has it now.    \nIf you want cheap, and just high pressure, and no sous vide or frills, the Insignia cookers sold by Best But go on sale periodically for $30ish 6 qt and $40ish 8 qt.   They are also probably both made by the same company who makes IPs.  \nAnother that might be on sale sometime is the Farberware 6 and 8 qt machines sold by Walmart.  Have a 2 or 3 year warranty and are high pressure only and essentially the same machines as the BB Insiginas, it looks to me.  I have the 8 qt Farberware, and paid $53 for it on sale.  \nInstant Pots themselves are plentiful and there are lots of people parting them out so you can even buy the guts on the secondhand market.  Every time I link this , Reddit removes my link.  But at [pressurecookingtoday](https://pressurecookingtoday.com/best-instant-pot-to-buy/) dot com there is a great article Best Instant Pot to Buy, with a summary at the bottom of the page that sorts out the various IP models.   Lux is high pressure only, no yogurt, and the bottom of the line.   Duo Evo Plus is an evolution of the Duo and had sous vide and a dry bake program and an inner pot with handles and is very nice.    Ultra, Max:  Both those are the top end models.    Duo and Duo Nova are midrange with essentially the same cook programs but the Nova has a fancier lid and display.   Duo Plus V2 and Viva V2 and the next higher tier of midrange, both have sous vide, and the Viva can be bought at Walmart.    Duo SV is an obsolete weirdo machine specially made for Costco and had zero replacement parts available plus didn't share parts with any other model, so AVOID the Duo SV.   It has been replaced by  the new Duo Gourmet at Costco, so definitely comb through some reviews before you pay good money for that one, but I think it's probably okay and probably shares parts with the rest of the Duo series.  The common Duo60 will do everything any beginner needs, and there are plenty of used ones out there.   It has high and low pressures and yogurt program.   You can use the Yogurt program to raise bread, as well as make yogurt.      Personally , I think 3 qt is too small.  All recipes are written for the 6 qt and adjustments may or may not be required for making the same in a 3 qt.   Make things easier and start with a 6 qt.  \n\n\nWhat I've settled on as keepers are:    Ultra 6 & 8 qt,  Duo Evo Plus 6 qt, and Duo Plus V2.  All of mine have sous vide.  It's enough to sous vide one or two portions and I thought it will be nice to have a portable sv capability to take on vacations or trips later.    I also kept a dented Duo60 as my take-to-social-functions beater machine that I don't have to worry about.   I personally find the manual steam release handle less annoying than trying to do a controlled release with an Ultra or Duo Nova style lid with the annoying push button.

But we do have a great liquidator store, where the owners buy pallets of store returns by the truckload, break up the pallets, and sell off the returns.    I have bought several used IPs there that were used a time or 5 and had food odor in the gasket, so the stores dump them to liquidators instead of resell them in stores.   Especially with covid.    I paid anywhere from $23 to $30 for either an IP Duo / Duo Nova or a CrockPot Express, 6 qt.    I paid $60 for an 8 qt Power Quick Pot that has sous vide.   (That was a great price on them at the time, since they were brand new and expensive in that large size.)     I put a cup of white vinegar, a cup of water, and a few drops of Dawn dishwash liquid in there, pressure cook, high pressure for 15 or 20 minutes, then quick release to blow all that vinegar and hot steam through the vent to clean it out.    Hand wash, dry, and it's clean, deodorized (mostly) and ready to use.    Odor will always get into the gasket because the gasket is exposed to the foods in these electric pressure cookers."]}

Beef Stew recipe in pressure cooker - YouTube", "top_comments": ["Good video.   The recipe could be improved in a couple ways to make it easier and better.   If you coat the meat with flour, it will be easier to brown and the flour will brown and help to absorb the meat juices.  \n\nIt's generally better to avoid trying to thicken the stew a lot in a pressure cooker before the long cooking time needed to tenderize the meat because it will greatly increase the chances for the stew to burn at the bottom.  The acidity of the tomatoes and paste will also reduce the effectiveness of the starch to thicken.   \n\nYou can thicken the stew after pressure cooking by mixing starch or flour with cold water or cold stock to make a slurry that you gradually add to the hot stew while stirring.  That prevents the starch from seizing and immediately clumping when added directly to hot liquid.  You won't need to use the sieve to try to get rid of the clumps.  You won't have any clumps.   \n\nYou're right that flour will need to be cooked to remove the raw flavor, but that only takes a couple of minutes without pressure and you can be stirring the stew to prevent burning at the bottom.   Starch often doesn't need any extra cooking because it's more neutral in flavor than raw flour.  It's also easier to adjust the thickness at the end to get the result you prefer.\n\nAn even better method to thicken the stew is to merely add a bit more potato to the recipe.  The potato will not thicken the stew very much while the meat is tenderizing.  Afterwards, you can simply mash one or two large potato pieces and stir to release the starch to thicken the liquid as much as you want.  The potato will be fully cooked, so you don't need to add any extra cooking time.  This is my favorite method of thickening the stew at the end because no flour or powdered starch is needed at all.", "Hi,\n\nanother stew recipe and this one was so tasty.

Now you should have one trimmed steak and diced stew meat.\n\nSeason it all with salt, fresh ground black pepper, and garlic powder, pasted, or minced garlic.    Put the steak into bowl or ziplock bag to marinate with some worcestershire sauce or soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil or peanut/canola oil, 1 Tbs onion powder, 1/2 tsp Accent MSG, 1 tsp Balsamic vinegar, a little pineapple or lemon juice, a couple of shakes of any seasoning you like that's good for beef.

So you're safe from parasite eggs, if any. Parasites are also quite rare in modern poultry operations since the chickens are pretty well separated from the outside world parasites need to complete their lifecycles. Of course, if you buy fancy cage-free chicken, this isn't as true.\n\nIt is possible, but really more rare than people assume, that chickens can be infected with asymptomatic salmonella (which is how one would get it from eggs, but it's in other tissues as well). Most bacterial infections in chickens make the chicken sick as well.  Then when a chicken is sick, it's culled from the flock (not turned in to food) to avoid contagion.\n\nMuch more likely is surface contamination due to processing after the bird is killed, but to a larger degree since chicken parts are small, fragile and hard to isolate while butchering. And we usually leave the skin on, unlike most other grocery store meat.\n\nBut none of this really matters, 160 kills everything that can make you sick. Even when sanitizing water, it's only necessary to heat it to 160 to render it safe, not boil, and especially not boil for minutes (although it might be a good idea to warm a bit past 160 to make sure it all reaches at least that).", "Sterilization under pressure is profoundly more affective.", "Parasites are all killed quickly at relatively low cooking temperatures, in less than a second at 65\u00b0C/150\u00b0F.  Freezing kills the parasites too, so the frozen chicken meat has no living parasites, however some bacteria like salmonella are much harder to kill than parasites.  Therefore a minimum internal cooking temp of 74\u00b0C/165\u00b0F is recommended if cooking time isn't used as a factor, however lower temperature cooking is safe too if you look up the time & temperature combinations that are used in sous vide cooking for food safety.\n\nNotice that these temperatures are way below the cooking temps of a pressure cooker.  A bigger problem with cooking chicken in a pressure cooker isn't parasites or bacteria, it's overcooking the meat so that it becomes a dry, flavorless, tough, ball of rubber that you wouldn't want to eat.  Chicken doesn't get better with more cooking, particularly large chunks of lean white breast meat.  So we try to cook it as little as possible just to be safe, and no more, and we brine or marinate the meat to help it retain moisture and texture after cooking.", "DNA starts to unzip as you get closer to 100\u00b0C. Very few things can last long at that temp and those things don't usually grow on chicken. Higher temps kill more things. So if parasites are your concern cooking the chicken longer will make it hotter and less likely to have parasites or microbes. 99% of the time as long as your chicken has reach above 160 F you'll be fine. \n\nThe time to cook will depend on how big your specific chicken is and how cold it is internally. If you are concerned I would recommend getting a meat thermometer to check after it cooks if the internal meat temps are above 160 F. If not cook longer. \n\nUsing the trivet verse placing directly in the pot is just a different method of cooking. The method doesn't matter as long as the inside of the chicken gets above 160. Changing the method can change the time it takes to reach that temp however. So if after all this you are still unsure, pick up a $5-10 meat thermometer and test your meat after you cook it foraximum peace of mind."]}

{"title": "Trying to cook pork shoulder, and finding contradictory recipes on the internet.", "selftext": "I bought a 8 lb bone-in chunk of pork shoulder to cook in the pressure cooker. I've done this only once before, and I can't find the recipe I used (that turned out perfect). So I searched, and ended up very confused.\n\nHere's what I ended up doing:\n\nMy cooker is a large stove-top model that goes to 15 psi. I cut the shoulder into about 5 pieces (following advice that said cut it into 2 lb chunks). The pieces fit in a single layer in the bottom of the pot. I added about 5 cups of water, which left the top inch or so of the meat exposed.  \n\nI put the heat on high and brought it up to 15 psi and the jiggly weight started rattling. I lowered the heat a bit, then raised it a little when the rattling stopped. I set the timer for about 40 minutes (I forgot to set it to begin with, so I estimated what the elapsed time had been when the rattling started).\n\nWhen the timer went off, I turned off the heat, and noticed that the pressure had gone up a little past 15 psi (maybe 16-17?). I moved the pot to a cold burner, and now it's hissing as it cools down.  I will wait for it to get back to room pressure before opening it up and seeing what I ended up with.\n\nMy goal is to shred the pork, and then use it to make tacos and pozole and stir fry, etc.  I'll keep the stock to make rice in, or use as a soup base.\n\nI was confused by the recipes that said \"cook 15 mins for each pound of meat\" which seems strange to me, because it's a giant pot, why would it matter how many pounds there are, especially since I was able to put them in one layer?  I decided to ignore this instruction and cook it for 45 minutes which is a time I saw in other recipes that talked about carnitas.\n\nSome people say cut it into 2\" chunks, other people say cut it into 2 pound chunks. Is it preferable to use a smaller size?  Why the variation in instructions?\n\nWhat does \"high pressure\" mean? Is that just another way of saying 15 psi?\n\nWhen I finally open the pot and see what's in there, how can I tell if it needs to be cooked more? And if it does, should I just cook it in a regular pot on the stove? Or pressure cook it some more?\n\nIf I overcooked it, is there anything I can do to make it better?\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSo it turned out really nice and tender, falling apart as soon as I tried to pick it up.  Tongs were very difficult to use, lol.  Shredding it was annoying, because I don't like globs of fat, and it was hard to separate the fat from the meat.  I guess next time I should trim it before cooking (but let the fat stay in the pot for flavor).  I wonder if letting it cool more will make shredding easier, to give the fat time to solidify more?\n\nThe bone got super soft and crumbly; I didn't expect that.\n\nThank you everyone for your advice and encouragement!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/qqlpim/trying_to_cook_pork_shoulder_and_finding/", "created_utc": 1636517146.0, "score": 31, "author": "MoreRopePlease", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/qqlpim/trying_to_cook_pork_shoulder_and_finding/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": [">I was confused by the recipes that said \"cook 15 mins for each pound of meat\" which seems strange to me, because it's a giant pot, why would it matter how many pounds there are, especially since I was able to put them in one layer?\n\nBecause in theory more meat will take more heat and therefore more time to cook.

Maybe sooner if the meat wasn't frozen and was a single layer like you described.  It's done if it shreds.  If it's close to shredding then braising on the stove is fine, if it's still really tough then I'd put it back under pressure for 10 more minutes.\n\n>If I overcooked it, is there anything I can do to make it better?\n\nIt won't be.

Once done I fill with water or broth until there is maybe an inch of meat showing, if small batches I'll just cover it all in liquid. Cook for 50 minutes, natural release and done.\nThis has worked with any amount of pork I have put in as long as the cut up chunks aren't TOO big. If I really want the pork to have strong flavor I'll cook 45 minutes, shred all the pork while the stock boils a bit, add in the flavor I need into the broth and then put the shredded pork in for another 5 of just simmering in the sauce, no pressure."]}

{"title": "Plantain stock", "selftext": "Where I live I can buy 3 plantains for a dollar or sometime 5 for a dollar if they are really ripe. Sometimes you can get a pair of plantains that grow fused together. These are lucky so I grab them when I see them as they are still priced the same as a single plantain. I usually stock up buying some every so many grocery trips, ripen them real good if needed (when the skin comes off real easy and you smell the sweetness you are ready), and freeze them whole after pealing.  I use them as needed throughout the year to make stock. No need to chop them up as there is no cooking advantage. \n\nTypically I use 3 or 4 whole pealed frozen plantains and put them in about 5 cups of water (you don't have to really measure just make certain they are well covered.) I cook them at pressure for 15 minutes. I do not add any spices or salt. You will smell the sweet flavors during this cooking time. Afterwards I let the pressure come down naturally and then strain the stock. The initially yellow/brown frozen plantains should be pinkish and fall apart on touch. \n\nThe broth is what you want so you have to strain out what is left of the plantains. These plantains are not even edible and are thrown out. I use a pasta strainer as that works well for me. But be sure to smash the plantains with the back of a spatula to get all the juice out. It hides in there.\n\nThis broth is really a good basis for cooking beans by PC. I usually use 1 lb of black beans or black eyed peas. These take longer to cook than other beans and work the best I have found. I soak the beans over night and then cook for 25 minutes at pressure. Add enough water so the beans are covered if you do not have enough stock. At this point I add salt and pepper  1.5 teaspoons each before cooking. \n\nAfter cooking I added in diced green chili peppers. The effect is you taste the chili then the bean and plantain stock. I buy lots of green chili peppers and freeze them. Cut them frozen then stir in to the hot beans and they will thaw quickly.\n\nI never freeze this stock btw. I freeze the plantains and make the stock as needed. Works easier for me. I also use my old Presto stove top cookers.\n\nThis is any easy cheap way to make a $1 bag of black beans into a great meal. I serve with my corn bread I posted, rice, or pasta. This easily serves a few ppl and a cheaper meal than a meat dish for well under $5.

Use this timing regardless of the recipe. \n\n*Excluding, of course recipes that require you to stop cooking under pressure, add something else, and then recook under pressure. Although your total time will still be 30 minutes.\n\n**To avoid overcooking chicken breasts, if the recipe calls for diced chicken, it is always better to cook the breasts whole and then dice them afterwards. \n\n\nAdjust these timings to your preferences. If you like firmer, sliceable chuck roast, you might want to cook for 60 minutes under pressure. But then 60 minutes would be the time you'd use for similar cuts."]}

Things like beans, lentils, and vegetables definitely have times out there for them. If you undershoot and have time you can always bring it back up to pressure. ", "Any whistle = wasted heat + time + pressure + moisture.\n\nThe whistle means overheating the pressure cooker to the point that the pressure valve pops up and releases steam to prevent excessive pressure from further building up.  The problem is that you waste all that steam+pressure+time released to get the pressure low enough for the weight to fall back down.   It would be like a cruise control set at 60mph that jams on brakes at 65 mph until the speed falls back to 30mph, instead of merely cutting the throttle back at 61mph to just what's needed to maintain 60mph.  Jamming on the brakes would be stupid and ignorant.  Intentionally causing whistles is stupid and ignorant.\n\nThe proper way to heat the pressure cooker (with weighted valve) is to heat it up until the weight just starts rocking or rotating slowly, and then you cut the heat to the level just barely needed to keep the weight acting that way without a big steam release (whistle).\n\nNo whistles mean that you're doing pressure cooking right.  You base the cooking time on the kind of food being cooked, not whistles.  You also determine the method of pressure release based on the food being cooked.   Thick liquids or any thing else that is likely to produce foam when boiling should have pressure released slow by the natural cooling of the pot to prevent clogging the valve with foam and food particles (although the cold water release method can be used by more advanced users).\n\nIn other words, I agree with /u/P0rtu6a1 about timing.  You determine the timing based on past experience with those foods, not using the widely variable timing of overpressurizing the pressure cooker valve.", "No idea, but the only thing I can think of is first whistle = low pressure, second whistle = high pressure.

A lot of the advice out there is from the states and there is an unholy fascination with apple pur\u00e9e. Babies don\u2019t need that amount of sugar.  \nMy son didn\u2019t do well with my bolognese. Too rich and too acidic I think, so we laid off until he was about 14 months.  \nThe great thing about pressure cooking is beans are easy AF to do. My son has probably eaten more beans and lentils than most adults.   \nOnce he was able to spoon food into his own mouth we went back to lumpy food, but I\u2019ll do a mix of things like du puy lentil, quinoa, and spinach (add the spinach at the end and simmer for ten).\nTry to get a variety of different foods into your kid, with different textures. The more they are exposed to, the more they will eat later in life.  \nDon\u2019t be worried if they don\u2019t eat what you make the first time. Mammals can be like that and even baby rats have been shown to not eat novel foods until the fourth time they have been exposed to it. \nIntroduce meat after six months, but not steak, like minced meat. Again, look up baby lead weaning. \nBabies love to play with food. Let them it not only introduces them to new foods in a manner that gives them a chance to play with texture, learning to feed themselves is important.  \nIf your baby doesn\u2019t eat something that they have eaten before, give them something else and don\u2019t worry. Ours went through days where he only wanted strips of red meat, and others where he only ate veggie stew. I suspect it had something to do with teeth. Teething is the worst. \nAs long as it\u2019s overall balanced, they\u2019ll be fine.  \nI\u2019ve taken to putting nutrient yeast in some of his foods. It\u2019s there so why not. \nA couple of strawberries or blueberries at the end of the meal is a good way to tie everything up and signal that the meal is done.  \nSpeaking of signaling; we got into the routine of dinner, bath, books, bed. It takes about an hour but after a year and a half, if we run that routine we can just chuck him in the cot and he\u2019ll go to sleep. Even if we are a thousand clicks from home, it still works. Babies like routine and boundaries. But they\u2019ll test the fuck out of the boundaries. Oh god so they will.  \nOf course, your mileage may vary. All babies are different and this is our particular experience with our one baby. Take my advice with a giant grain of salt and do what works for you.  \nIf you need anything else, go ahead and ask, otherwise: good luck! \n\n", "I made all my baby's purees.

Cubed chicken takes as little as 5 minutes to pressure cook in liquid (stock or bouillon).  With an Instant Pot, this would be 1 minute cooking time with a natural release (in which most of the cooking actually occurs). Cubed meat also takes a lot less time to brine, which helps to maintain their moisture and flavor.  This is best for using in a wide range of chicken recipes.  Thigh meat is better though, for flavor and texture.  Another advantage is that the poaching liquid can easily be converted into a great sauce or gravy with a thickener like a cornstarch slurry or instant mashed potato flakes, to help keep the chicken moist for many days in the fridge.\n\nThe cubes don't even have to be small.  They can be 1 inch cubes that are very meaty.   It's the consistent size, the large surface area, and the ability for the heated liquid to circulate that lets them cook quickly and evenly.\n\nThe worst case is using large size frozen breasts with bone.  The cooking time will be highly unpredictable and you'll pretty much guarantee that many pieces will become overcooked and dry just to get everything cooked to a 165F internal temp.  15-25 minutes could be required, with a natural release.  Much of the meat might only become edible by shredding it and adding liquid to moisten it.  I recommend checking the internal temp of all pieces to ensure that they're safe.

What you'd want to do is stack the chicken in to no more than the max fill line making sure there is space all around and room for at least one cup of liquid in the pot. Then take the chicken out and weigh how much you have. Then you can find a recipe for a pork loin roast of the same weight and use the pressure cooking time for that. My estimate is 50 minutes with natural release, but it depends on how much you put in and how tightly it's stacked.\n\nI will add: *don't do this!* \nThis is probably the worst way to cook white meat chicken. The result will be no better than barely edible. A pressure cooker (or slow cooker) is a bad way to cook white meat to begin with.

Don't be too strict about the \"layering\" in a manner that obstructs the liquid and rice from naturally circulating at the bottom when it starts boiling.  1 teaspoon of tomato paste should not thicken the stock enough to cause this problem.

Having different sizes is useful to match the amount of food in the recipe.  Smaller pressure cookers come up to full 15 psi much faster than bigger ones.   Stovetop models are often the best choice for people who pressure cook a lot and don't want the limitations of the electric models.\n\nIf you want air frying, roasting and baking, there are far better options than the foodi.   \n\nFor example, the Panasonic NN-CD87KS Home Chef 4-in-1 is a microwave, air fryer, convection oven and infrared grill all in one appliance.  If you want to brown food from the pressure cooker,  an infrared broiler is usually the best choice because it doesn't require preheating and it browns a lot faster.  Its convection oven is better for baking.  The inverter microwave is better for thawing and reheating than older microwave technology.  It's a better size and lets you use regular rectangular pans.  Toshiba, Cuisinart, and other companies make good combination ovens too.   \n\nPersonally, I have a Cuisinart CMW-200 combo microwave + convection oven that works great.  It cooks a rotisserie style roast chicken in about 45 minutes by using the microwave a little bit to heat the meat at first but then it transitions to the convection heat for beautiful browning.

It may only be 12 minutes of cooking time, but remember that will easily double or triple from start to finish.\n\n * A pressure cooker is not the best or most ideal way to cook **all** cuts of meat. In particular, leaner muscle - think pork loin, e.g. - often benefits from a quick, dry method rather than a braise. But the pressure cooker is aces at breaking down tougher cuts in reduced time. Think spoon-tender stew meat in an hour from start to finish: that's where it shines!\n\n * A pressure cooker can intensify flavors, but it can't create them.

{"title": "First Pressure Cooker Fail, Looking for Advice on Why", "selftext": "I've had my Instant Pot for a year and use it about once every week or 2. It's been a learning curve, but I've mostly had success with it and love using it. I've mostly made stews, roasts, shredded pork, chicken and dumplings, pasta dishes (okay, mac and cheese).\n\nYesterday was the first real problem I had. I made [Alton Brown's Pressure Cooker Chili](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pressure-cooker-chili-recipe.html) and followed the recipe exactly as written, except I set the pressure cooker to 30 minutes on high to account for having an electric model rather than a stovetop. \n\nLike I usually do, I sealed the top, set the timer and walked away. When I heard the timer go off, I walked into the kitchen and noticed that the pressure valve was still down. In my previous experiences, the timer never starts until the valve pops up. When I opened the pot, the food LOOKED good, but the meat was very undercooked and tough. I turned it back on high pressure for 5 minutes and watched it this time - again, the timer started after a minute or 2, but the valve was still down. It hissed and let some steam out, and then the steam stopped, but the valve was still down. It wouldn't come to pressure. I check the obvious things like making sure it wasn't set to vent, but everything seemed fine. \n\nI gave up and ate a bowl of tough, undercooked meat in a tasty sauce, but I will probably end up tossing most of it. I can't even feed it to the dog because it's too spicy. I'm really disappointed because I spent a good amount of money on this recipe. \n\nI imagine that the problem stemmed from the tortilla chips in the recipe, since they were the only thing really different about this recipe. The recipe started with a good amount of liquid - 12 oz of beer and 16 oz of a really thin salsa, plus the liquid the meat released - so I didn't think the chips would be a problem. At the end of cooking though, the sauce was really thick. Still liquid, but thick. I could tell from stirring it that there was some burning on the bottom of pot, something I've never run into before. \n\nWhat I really don't understand is this recipe got a lot of really good reviews, so obviously several people have made it successfully. The problem seems to be with me rather than recipe - what variable could have led to this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/5glnyd/first_pressure_cooker_fail_looking_for_advice_on/", "created_utc": 1480941138.0, "score": 28, "author": "leftnewdigg2", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/5glnyd/first_pressure_cooker_fail_looking_for_advice_on/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Not sure about your IP issues (I haven't got mine yet) but I wouldn't throw it out... if nothing else (and you continue to have problems reaching pressure) at the very least you could slow cook it for a few hours to tenderise the meat, either in the instant pot, on the hob, or in the oven.", "Burned on the bottom and not reaching pressure is almost always a sign of not enough liquid.  Maybe cook something else in it (after finishing off yours the slow way like mentioned above) to make sure your valve is working properly?\n\nIf it is, then I guess you just have to add more liquid to the recipe?", " \n> Like I usually do, I sealed the top, set the timer and walked away. When I heard the timer go off, I walked into the kitchen and noticed that the pressure valve was still down. In my previous experiences, the timer never starts until the valve pops up. \n\nYou're absolutely right. This was the issue. Two things: the water line is there to ensure you have enough space for the storm cloud of water vapor to form inside the pot. Don't fill liquid above the line or you won't get enough pressure to push the plunger up. Without pressure, the meat is just boiling in water and not pressure cooking. \n\n2nd, be sure to inspect and clean the rubber ring in the lid after every cook. \n\nJust as a final tip, You can sometimes shimmy the lid up and down after the first few minutes of warmup in the pot to force the plunger up. Think of it working like a bellows. If I think it's taking too long to come to pressure, this will usually do the trick. ", "I've had this happen with the IP when I had it packed which made it difficult for liquid to circulate. It will happen if the mixture is too thick which results in heating for too long and not being able to get to pressure. The safety feature kicks in and triggers the countdown without hitting pressure. ", "I have discovered in mine if the float valve (silver peg with rubber cap on the inside) is sticky, the cooker won't reach pressure BUT the boiling liquid will fool the timer into starting. Thus the timer will count down, but no pressure is reached. \n\nCheck the float valve - remove the stainless steel perforated cover on the inside of the pot, take the small rubber cap off, pull pin out, and clean everything. Don't lose the small rubber cap down the drain hole in your sink, where it will fit perfectly over the round hole and cause you to swear like a stevadore until you can get it out with a pair of tweezers. Once that is clean and moving freely, the steam from cooking is enough to move it to the closed position, reach pressure, and start the timer properly! ", "You can rule out a mechanical or seal issue by simply heating a cup of water, if the unit comes to pressure normally then your recipe probably didn't have enough liquid or thickened too early. ", "To thick, I've done the same it never reaches pressure ", "The user guide suggests to replace the silicon around the valve. (if the issue persists)... See user guide, troubleshooting section, valve not closing bit.", "My 3rd ever IP cook, the pressure stopper didnt come up. Ruined the cook. Now if i am there when its getting up to steam I jiggle it a bit just to make sure its not stuck and it can move.", "A couple of things to think about too.    \nI notice that once I've used my IP to pressure cook or saute something (so the unit gets hot), that can happen.  I'll usually make sure the rim of the inner pot is wiped clean of any oil or debris, make sure the ring is well seated and *stays* seated while putting the lid on, and always press the lid down firmly if it keeps letting steam out for longer than I'm expecting (the more liquid in the pot, the longer that coming-to-pressure time will be).    \nIf the steam keeps coming out \"too long,\" or especially around the lid rather than the valve, I'll definitely press the lid down and/or eventually remove the lid and check to make sure there's no *thick* stuff on the bottom of the pot and nothing is scorching on the bottom, there's sufficient liquid (left), and it's heating.  Sometimes it's necessary to remove and clean the valves, but I almost never do things to get sticky or dried stuff in there (like quick-releasing starchy items, using too much liquid, etc).\n\nSounds like your stew meat cooked some just from the heat that happens during the coming-to-pressure time, but not long enough to make it tender?\n\n\n", "I might have experienced the same problem. My wife made chili the other day. I used it too make dog food the day after and when is went back after the timer went off 10 minute NPR nothing was done. I tired again this time watching to see what was happening. I noticed a small amount of water around the area where the lid locks and a very small amount of steam coming out from the float valve. It was such a small amount that it was hard to see. \n\nI took off the sealing ring and noticed some spots that felt a little rough. I put it back on, did a water test and it was fine. Maybe a chance the ring wasn't cleaned well enough, not seated properly or just getting old."]}

Let\u2019s look at bagels ? boiling is responsible for this holey bread\u2019s unique qualities. Specifically, boiling serves three purposes: First, it sets the shape and kills off some of the yeast on the outer surface of the dough, limiting the bagel\u2019s expansion when it\u2019s baked. Second, it gelatinizes the starches on the surface, leading to a shiny coating and a chewy texture. Finally, it activates the yeast in the inner layers of dough.", "If you're not canning and the food will be consumed immediately or refrigerated, then none of those extra steaming rules apply at all.

In fact, you could make the yogurt in an instant pot first, like I often do.   You can convert powdered milk and/or canned evaporated milk (not sweetened condensed milk) into yogurt using some plain yogurt as a starter for the IP yogurt mode.   The tart flavor of the cultured milk/yogurt is part of the flavor of a quick bread.   Powdered buttermilk is also available as a substitute, but yogurt is far cheaper, more widely available, and can be used for a lot more purposes than baking.\n\nYou can use a combination of baking soda and baking powder in the brown bread recipe.  The baking soda is to react with the acidic yogurt/buttermilk, while the baking power provide the double-acting reaction with heat.\n\nBundt pans are far better than using tin cans.  The bundt shape is designed specifically for even cooking by eliminating the middle of a regular round cake.  It will cook faster too.", "also just fyi for anyone here, the instant pot isn't safe fot pressure canning because you can't verify the exact pressure"]}

It's delicious this way.\n\nPreheat your oven to 325 degrees F.\n\nSalt and pepper the pork shoulder while you are heating up some peanut oil in a large roaster on the stove.\n\nBrown the roast on all sides (this takes about 15 minutes), then transfer it to a plate while you drain all the fat out of the pan.\n\nReturn the roast to the pan.  Sprinkle the roast with a mixture of 6 rosemary sprigs and 6 garlic cloves minced together.  Put it in the oven and roast it for an hour.\n\nRemove the roaster and add enough chicken broth so that your roast is sitting in an inch or two of liquid.

Don\u2019t worry\u2026 it will be ok\ud83d\ude00", "I am old and grew up in a home where a pressure cooker was used every day, at a time when there were no built in safety features. My grandmother and aunts also used them daily. No one ever had an issue. If used properly and the pressure is released without forcing it, there should not be a problem. I have 3 Presto\u2019s stove tops that are 44 years old and are still doing great. \n\nThe Instant Pots are very safe and unless you try opening one with brute force without releasing the pressure, I cannot see how it would explode if you follow the instructions. \n\nAlways use at least the minimum amount of liquid, don\u2019t fill it over the max line and don\u2019t open it when there is built in pressure. I own 2 IP\u2019s and love them. I also own another electric pressure cooker I bought before the IP\u2019s, a Ming, and a stove top Fissler or a total of 4 stove tops and 3 electrics. I have never had a problem with any of them. So just relax and enjoy using them. They are not a substitute for other appliances but they definitely have their well earned niche in the kitchen.\n\nEdit\nOne other point, make sure to replace gasket and whatever other replaceable parts your pressure cooker has. My stove tops that are 44 years old have had gaskets and pressure plugs replaced many times.", "Thank you all!", "lol. I had mine for months before I used it for the same reason. After you use it once you will see how easy it is. Also it turns itself off if there is an issue. My valve was defective and wouldn\u2019t hold pressure, so it just turned itself off. Once I got that fixed I use it all the time. It does some things so much better than the stove and in some ways it\u2019s safer because it turns itself off! (I get distracted and boil pots dry sometimes with the stove.) Amy and Jackie is great, also if you like Indian food check out the Ministry of Curry online. She has an Indian food Instant Pot cookbook.", "The only way you will blast your lit to the roof is if you try and open the lid manually while there is still pres ure in it. \n\nIf you can remove the jiggler weight, the thing that serves as pressure regulator, when it has cooled a while and most of the steam has released you lust wait till steam stop.

{"title": "ISO advice from experienced PC users re: stovetop PC vs electric plug in types", "selftext": "Hi! I'm tired of certain cooking limitations from not using a PC and have been looking into getting one. I have a tiny kitchen with no counter space, or storage for the \"safer\" electric plug in style PC, so we've decided those aren't going to work for us. However, I have childhood memories of seeing a relative severely burned after deciding to \"check\" on my mom's stovetop PC, so i have some stovetop PC trauma. This has been a difficult choice for me, and I'm hoping that stovetop ones are fairly safe these days if the user (me) carefully reads the manual.\n\nI'm trying to decide between the 4 quart Presto stainless steel PC bec that size seems more manageable for me, or a 6 quart PC from Ikea. These two are the only stainless steel options under $100 that I've found. I don't have prime and try to avoid ordering from Amazon. Presto has free shipping, replacement parts availability, and a reasonably priced accessory lid for draining that I think would help me when using it by myself. The ikea option looks fairly easy to use, has inexpensive shipping, but I'm not sure about availability of replacement parts. I also don't know how safe these are. Do I need to be an expert PC user before buying a stovetop PC? I'm still a little worried about this.\n\nI cook for just two people and I think I'll be using it mostly for cooking potatoes, dried beans and possibly related soups and stews. My husband does want to try making soy yogurt, which I think we need an instant pot for, but I'm a little confused on this point. Optimally, I'm hoping the 4 quart will work for our minimal needs, but I'm worried it won't be big enough for yogurt making. We will never use it for cooking meats or for canning.\n\nOne last problem we're confused about is the plethora of instructions and recipes out there for instant pots. How easy is it to convert those to a stovetop PC, since I'm not an advanced cook? I hope that makes sense.  Please ignore if it doesn't. \ud83d\ude33\n\nI would love to hear from experienced users on whether I'm thinking about all this correctly, or if there's something I'm not considering. We're on a tight budget, so if I buy something, I'm really stuck with it. I think this could help us expand our meal options and save money, but only if i choose correctly.

The stovetop ones are better for fast cooking like rice because they heat up fast so a 5 minute cook takes a total of around 15 minutes, 5 to come to pressure, 5 to cook, 5 to cool down. And if the food needs a little more, it's quick to pressurize again. \n\nThe electric is better for set & forget like some beans or meats. It also does slow cooking and sort of sous vide. That's where the yogurt comes in, not pressure cooking but very low well regulated temperature hold. \n\nAll take the same cleaning process: pot goes in dishwasher, hand wash lid. I would certainly not get an electric with a nonstick pot - you'll want to scour it.", "You do not need to be an expert PC user before using a stovetop PC. Electric may be a little safer as they may be able to detect overpressure via temperature measurement, but otherwise I believe they're about the same regarding safety. They'll both lock shut while under pressure and have multiple failsafes. Just clean it when you're done and the worst you can do is cook all the water out of it and ruin the food.\n\nStovetop pressure cookers are often higher pressure than most electrics, though I think InstaPots can hit the higher pressure of the stovetop systems. Converting recipes will typically be either bringing up to pressure then turning the stove down a bit, or just going for a little less time. It might take a bit of experimentation. But I wouldn't worry about this *at all.*\n\nPressure cookers have been around for a long time, far longer than any electric and especially longer than instant pots. You won't have any trouble finding recipe books for a stovetop PC. If you really must do that one special TikTok or Instagram recipe, just open up any decent older PC cookbook and look for a recipe that uses similar ingredients. The only difference between what you see on Instagram and what grandma made was instead of saying, \"Crack chicken!\" she said, \"Shredded chicken with bacon, cheese, and ranch powder. Now get out of my kitchen before you make the cake fall!\"\n\nAs for yogurt, I think you need to keep mild temperatures for HOURS (like just over 110\u00b0F) and this isn't something you'll want to do on a stovetop PC. Electric, sure. Sous vide, even better. Stovetop PC will require an engineering project with a budget to pull it off.\n\nIkea parts?

I can make a pot of stew and get four very carefully portion controlled meals out of it. If I'm not careful about it, I eat like Shrek and will have one meal and a snack. For that reason, I can't recommend a 4 qt PC. You'll also never say, \"I wish this were smaller!!!\" when you're halfway through making a chili and realize you forgot to add the beans.", "I love my Presto 6-quart stainless steel-steel pressure cooker.

That is a size used in a lot of recipes and is large enough to double as a stock pot without the pressure cooker lid. It is also large enough to allow you to batch cook beans. My mom always used a 6 quart for everything.", "The main thing with stovetop is standing nearby until it comes to pressure. At that point you must turn the burner down to low. It will never explode if you do that.  Bigger is better for cooking beans and making stock. I have an 8q Kuhn Rikon. Look on marketplace or eBay and get a really nice one. I have refurbed lots of vintage Prestos and prefer them to the modern ones. You can easily replace the rubber ring and pressure valve.", "I have a stovetop PC and they are very hard to explode. Safety regulations have addressed the issues and I am not aware of any incidents involving PC in the last several years. \n\nPC yogurt is not a thing. That\u2019s for electric multi cookers like instant pot. Google countertop yogurt. \n\nElectric vs stovetop - cook times can be considered equivalent. Like the other poster said, you may want to adjust some times, but it\u2019s not really an issue. So use instant pot recipes no problem. I LOVE being able to pull my PC off the stove and run water over it at the sink and have it depressurize in a minute without spraying steam all over the kitchen!\n\nI have a 4.8 qt.

I use the small one ALL the time.\u00a0It honestly doesn't take up much more space than a traditional pressure cooker, especially considering most traditional cookers have a large handle jutting off to one side. It's small enough that it could sit between burners on my stove if I wanted to use it there. It's also great for small sous vide, a slow cooker, rice cooker, and easy to take to parties or events with food sealed inside. I really only use the large one for making big batches of yogurt.\u00a0", "I've been using a pressure cooker for probably close to 40 years on my own and was around my grandma doing canning for as long as I can remember.\n\nI have had an IP for about 8 years and I really do love it. I have a stovetop pressure cooker (and a canner) but the Instant Pot is just so easy. It controls its own temperature and it shuts itself off when it's finished. No messing around with the stove, trying to get the heat right and you don't have to stay closeby to keep an eye on and take it off the heat when it's done\n\nThe other thing about things like the Instant Pot is that it does a bunch of other things besides just pressure cooking. You mentioned making yogurt - which is something you can do with just a pot, a jar and a heating pad, but the IP makes it super simple. It's also a slow cooker, a steamer, a rice cooker and a warmer. \n\nJust to note though - modern pressure cookers, even the ones for the stovetop, are so much safer than they were years ago.", "A stovetop cooker runs similar recipes as Instant Pots. Nothing special to change in the recipe. \n\nMaking yogurt just needs body temperature warmth.  An instant pot can do this easily, people without this temperature control put the dish in the oven overnight with the light bulb on.\n\nModern stovetop cookers should incorporate a couple different passive safety designs to handle over-pressure.  On any of them if you try hard you can open the cooker under pressure, this may have been what went wrong in your youth.  An instant pot's safety system can be defeated with a finger.   Just don't do that then.", "I've been using stovetop pressure cookers since the 1970s, and have seen safety features come a long way. Pressure-sensitive locking lids and redundant overpressure relief devices make the beef-stew-on-the-ceiling nightmare a thing of the past. It might be possible to get a second-generation pressure cooker like those you're considering to explode, but you'd have to work pretty hard at it. \n\nAs noted, get the larger model if you'll be cooking a lot of legumes. There's no such thing as underfilling a cooker, but overfilling can definitely be a problem. Even if it isn't dangerous it can still make a mess.\n\nETA: To convert an Instant Pot recipe, just select the 10psi (low pressure) setting. Or use high pressure (15psi) and shorten the cooking time, but that involves some guesswork.", "My kitchen is a tad bigger than yours, but I do have the same outlet problems, hence I own stovetop PCs.\n\n\nI bought a 2.5l WMF Perfect, used from what is craigslist over here. It was 30\u20ac and looked brand new. People get them as gifts and are afraid to use them \ud83d\ude01 The first year I just cooked potatoes in it, which is what I bought it for.\u00a0\n\n\nThen I declared 2023 the year of the pressure cooker. I bought a bigger one and a stovetop PC cookbook. Now I do almost everything in one of my PCs. They are the original 2.5l WMF perfect, a 3.5l Lagostina Novia (found a 30% off deal) and a 5l Lagostina Novia (they have side handles intead of the long one). Being single, I do not need a big pot, but I got the 5l dirt cheap, too (48\u20ac). It took me a bit until I had figured out how my stove and the pots work together to get the cooking times just right, but because it was a project, it was fun. Once you've found out how much liquid/food needs which temerature to hold the pressure, there is no need to baby sit the thing. For example, potatoes in the smallest pot need 150 ml water, build pressure on the highest dial (6) on my electric stove, than hold the pressure on the lowest (1) for 8 minutes. After the timer went off, I just cut tge heat and let it depressurize naturally. Asparagus is 250 ml water in the medium pot, on 6 till pressure, than on 3 for two minutes, depressureizing in a sink filled with cold water.\u00a0\n\n\nMy advice is to get a used one, that is not too old, preferably an unwelcome wedding gift or something like that.\u00a0\n\n\nGet a second, regular lid for it and use it as a normal pot, too.\n\n\nSkip the Ikea pot. I think their bottom is too flimsy, which means you might end up with burnt food. Also, a stove top PC lasts for decades, but I doubt you will find spare parts for it for as long as you'll get them from other brands.\u00a0\n\n\nAs for size, I'd recommend a small one for rice, totatoes and side dish veggies and a 6l for soups, stews, stock and beans.", "Hi again, OP.  I think you can order your stovetop PC directly from Presto on their website.

A stovetop pressure cooker is going to take just about the same storage space as an electric one.  Personally I prefer electric.  Put it on my stove, do the saut\u00e9ing, put everything in, set time, pressure, and release method and forget about it until you hear the pressure releasing.  My stovetop one requires constant monitoring to keep the pressure in the correct range.\n\nLove my well reviewed Instant Pot:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-6Qt-Plus-WiFi/dp/B08TMTJZ8L/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?crid=2MRNB09OOW12G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vu-40Sejda6w\\_Hm1ojkYkc6SsYoQxdj4kyvAiFIjflzC1uFaiz4oEbLtlcWh8A3fJFrBp7XWTIuZ6\\_QzrfE9mn0GVeKnlU6L3hBvNpOanu5krj2W5u-KWyz1UsHtG2P9SHj8QzVKwtBUeRtaokVQGmogvfuLDdz-H4YfvNwMQV28qDEjUOleLirceinlVUXo3OYNCpMvVjV1Nmrb\\_QHanoLDw\\_na8Xe35MwMw4gNGfI.NrJFRd2uoYhIQiQePMFKJ4BEXr\\_ARbc4H\\_Gdk\\_kvBck&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=instant%2Bpot%2Bpro%2Bplus&qid=1745563086&sprefix=instant%2Bpot%2Bpro%2Bplu%2Caps%2C360&sr=8-1&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-6Qt-Plus-WiFi/dp/B08TMTJZ8L/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MRNB09OOW12G&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vu-40Sejda6w_Hm1ojkYkc6SsYoQxdj4kyvAiFIjflzC1uFaiz4oEbLtlcWh8A3fJFrBp7XWTIuZ6_QzrfE9mn0GVeKnlU6L3hBvNpOanu5krj2W5u-KWyz1UsHtG2P9SHj8QzVKwtBUeRtaokVQGmogvfuLDdz-H4YfvNwMQV28qDEjUOleLirceinlVUXo3OYNCpMvVjV1Nmrb_QHanoLDw_na8Xe35MwMw4gNGfI.NrJFRd2uoYhIQiQePMFKJ4BEXr_ARbc4H_Gdk_kvBck&dib_tag=se&keywords=instant%2Bpot%2Bpro%2Bplus&qid=1745563086&sprefix=instant%2Bpot%2Bpro%2Bplu%2Caps%2C360&sr=8-1&th=1)"]}

Beans don't require natural release.  A cold water release is better and takes seconds to do.\n\nNavy beans can be pressure cooked and be ready to eat in less than 30 minutes, start-to-finish, not merely the pressure cooking time.\n\nI prefer the Hambeens Cajun 15 bean soup mix vs. plain boring navy beans, though.  I stock bags of them in my pantry at all times.", "I have learned here today that people are pretty militant about their beans. Good luck OP.", "Sounds like part of the problem is that your cooker takes a long time to come up to pressure. And you're doing it twice. So the easiest thing to do would be to only do it once. Soaking beans isn't always necessary, but with some beans it helps to make sure the middle is cooked before the outside gets mushy. Try skipping the soak, or soaking overnight at room temperature.\n\nThe other problem is that you're overcooking your beans. The solution to that is simple - don't cook them so long. If they're a little al dente after you release the pressure you can simmer them until they're just right.\n\nI disagree with the comment that beans like a quick pressure release. For the quick soak, sure. But IME releasing the pressure quickly when they're done tends to make the skins fall off. I always do a natural release and it seems to do a better job of keeping the beans intact.", "They are about the same size as black beans.  I cook both in my instant pot for about 40 mins and they taste great to me.", "I make Boston Baked Beans from navy beans.\nO don't try to cook them all the way in the pressure cooker, but finish them in a bean pot in a slow oven.\n\nIdeally, before assembling the final dish, you cook the beans just long enough so that the skins burst when you blow on them.\n\nTry to buy your Beans from a store that sells a fair number of them. Older Beans can take a much longer time to cook.", "I like beans that others characterize as mushy, so I like navy beans pressure cooked. I brine them instead of soaking, but you can also just cook them without soaking.", "Try this:\n\n1. With the lid off on your pressure cooker, bring just water to a rolling boil.\n2. Add the dry beans, the boiling will stop momentarily.\n3. Put the lid on, with vent open, then close vent.\n4. Pressure should come up in under a minute. \n5. After it seals, pull the plug. Let them stay under pressure for a few minutes.\n6. Open the vent to release pressure. It will not have to vent very long.\n7. When vented, remove lid and rinse the beans. I like to use distilled water for my final cook because it does not have fluorine or chlorine or other tap water minerals that can interfere with flavor.\n\nNow, for the final cook:\n\n1. chop any herbs/vegetables you intend to put in your beans.\n2. Bring salted distilled water to a boil.\n3. Add any butter/oil/lard/bacon you intend to cook with your beans to the boiling water.\n4. Add any dry spices (pinto bean seasoning, onion powder, etc.) to the boiling water.\n5. Dump your washed beans and all chopped vegetables all together and immediately put the lid on.\n6. Pressure should come up and it should seal in less than a minute. The longer this step takes, the more light aromatic compounds you are losing to the atmosphere. It might smell great, but this needs to stay in the beans.\n7. Pressure cook for 15-30 minutes, depending upon the temperature setting/make/model of your pressure cooker and the desired bean texture.\n8. Rapidly cool without venting. If you use a plug in, like instapot, I use a wet paper towel with an ice cube on the exposed metal surfaces (unplug first) but if done right, no water will run down the side. It will flash off.\n9. The next step I withhold because the instapot can implode if you don't do it correctly. Leaving it out gets you 90% of the way to perfection. So not worth the risk.\n\nLet me know what you think. The oil helps retain some aromatic compounds that are insoluble in water. Sealing the pot quickly prevents the lightest of these from escaping before it can seal. Quenching the pot lets the temperature drop so that by the time the vent releases, air is coming into the pot, not steam leaving.  \n\nThe biggest trick is getting the water content where you want it. If there's too much liquid, you'll be tempted to cook them down with the lid off. This turns this back into a standard pot of beans. Much better to add water to thin, as this doesn't drive off flavor.", "I pretty much cook any beans in my pressure cooker for somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes. And I go with the slow release. I kind of like them a little crunchy. It doesn't take mine nearly as long to come up to pressure is yours does I'm not sure what that's all about", "Huh.  Is your Breville electric?

Since I eat a lot of Greek yogurt it was worth it for a time but the strainer I was using was really labor intensive to clean and I've just bought store yogurt for a while. If you just made yogurt and not Greek yogurt you'd probably get maybe 50% more and would skip cleaning the strainer. One additional benefit is that you can actually strain it past where Greek yogurt is and make really thick (and high-protein) that's almost cheese-like in consistency.\n\nAlso it takes quite a while to make, so you'll want to plan your day around it.

Put the lid on with the valve open (or use a crock pot lid adapter). Wait until it gets to 160-180F. It should alert you to this on its own, but you can check it if you want to.\n\n3. When it beeps, take the inner pot out so it can cool. You can speed this up by putting it in a sink full of cool water. If you have a thermometer, you want to get it down to 110F. In water this takes 3-6 minutes. Set a timer, it's faster than you think.\n\n4. Dump a blep of existing yogurt in and stir it until it dissolves. I usually make more yogurt when I have less than a cup left, but don't worry too much about having too much - it'll just become part of the final product, the yogurt bacteria will keep it food safe. Drop the pot back into the heater and press the yogurt button until it says 8:00.\n\n5. If you're an overachiever, agitate it every hour or so for the first two or three hours. I don't know if this helps, but I started doing it after I had a batch that came out runny and that never happened again. I think this helps ensure the yogurt bacteria evenly distribute after having some time to populate, if you don't drop in enough starter.

Strain the final product through two layers of cheesecloth. I usually throw the cheesecloth over a spaghetti strainer, you just need something with holes to let the liquid through. I do recommend catching the whey as it drains, a big stock pot works great, or even dumping the yogurt into your strainer and putting that back over your inner pot (works for a half gallon, I can't quite fit a whole gallon of yogurt in my strainer).\n\n8. If you're lazy like me, you probably leave the yogurt in the strainer until pretty much all the whey has been removed and it now has the consistency of cream cheese. Dump that in a bowl. Add whey back into the yogurt and stir it until it reaches your desired consistency. I like it thicker than you get from the store, but not so thick you have to chew it.\n\n9. Refrigerate it.

Coating do wears over time if you cook too acidic or too alcaline foods like I do. This particular model comes with a cast aluminium with a thin ceramic coating with measurements of 240 mm wide(to the lip) and 264.7mm in height.\nAfter measuring thoroughly the deformation of the seal, disassembling different parts and trying to understand the security measures on the lid I was confident that the tolerance in height was significant. I decided to test a compatible stainless steel inner pot with measurements of 240 mm (to the lip) and 260 mm height. \nThe first test I did was a heat transmission, this I measured by adding 1 kg of water to the pot and measuring the time to boil from room temperature (using the reduce function). I did this 3 times and found no difference at all. I must add that in the stainless steel pot heat transmission seems to be non linear, but was to lazy to keep testing.\nThe second test I did was a seal test. First I tested five minutes to low pressure to see if the seal holds. Found no problem at all. The second time I tested five minutes to full pressure, I noticed pressure climbs neglectably faster, but I wasn't testing for time so it was just perception. It did hold with no problem and no excessive venting.\nMy conclusion is that although there are differences, those are not significant enough to say that the fast slow pro will behave differently.

Why I ask that is because I heard if you blend a raw onion and garlic, then you can remove the bitter if you cook them for longer than if you did it the other way.\n\nAnd I also hear that pressure cooking will cook foods quickly at super high heats. SO would that deal with the bitter taste of blending a raw onion and garlic?\n\nI also heard issues of pasta sauce in pressure cookers, so would I just do the garlic and onion first, place that in the pressure cooker, cook my lentils in water first, then after releasing pressure just add the blended tomatos, and then use a normal cooking function without pressure?\n\nAsking this to see if it's worth going for a pressure cooker, and what I can expect from such a purchase.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1imurlz/blending_raw_onions_and_garlic_then_pressure/", "created_utc": 1739265928.0, "score": 3, "author": "Cushee_Foofee", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1imurlz/blending_raw_onions_and_garlic_then_pressure/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Is the onion thing a sensory issue?

It all just happens faster.", "Ok, so what you are saying is, \n\n- You make lentils in something akin to a tomato/red pasta sauce. \n\n- You are trying to cut down on the overall cook time but utilizing a pressure cooker.\n\n- You want to make sure you can pressure cook lentils without precooking the onions and garlic.\n\n- You want to make sure a pasta sauce won't ruin the lentils during cooking.\n\nThis is going to be a bit of an info dump too, so as questions and I'll try to reword or better explain if you need.\n\nFor the cooking process, with or without a pressure cooker/instapot/etc, there are a ton of different ways to cook them. I'd recommend googling ideas/recipies. On a quick search, [AllRecipies](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-cook-lentils/) has a basic how to cook on the stove or in an insta pot.\n\nAdding the garlic and onion to the pot with the lentils during the cooking would definitely assure they would be cooked by the end of the pressure. You would not cook these separate from the lentils, instead dumping everything in so it can cook and meld under pressure. If you do them separate, you may create onion & garlic soup which will steam and may stink up your house.\n\nPressure cookers do cook food quick, but it is typically foods that are dried (like beans and rice) or tough cuts of meat that need long slow cooks w/o the pressure. You do have to take into account the amount of time that it takes a pressure cooker to come to pressure to though, outside of the cook time. A recipe I use for cooking pinto beans in a pressure cooker takes 1 hour AFTER it comes up to pressure. Depending on amount of liquid, external temps, elevation, etc, you could add 15-30 minutes of cook time just to reach pressure on a stove top pressure cooker for 1.25-1.5 hours of total time.\n\nLiquid (typically a thin liquid like water or stock) is used to create the steam that pressures the food. Thick liquids like pasta sauces could burn or over reduce under high heats and since you cannot stir or check on the sauce during cooking which could ruin the rest of the dish. The thicker liquid may not as easily convert to steam, defeating the point of pressure cooking as well. The way you are talking, using the tomato sauce and watering it down, may work though if it is more like a tomato soup than a pasta sauce, but it would be trial and error for me to tell you anything.", "Cutting onions and mincing garlic that you then pressure cook will render them practically invisible in whatever you are cooking. No need to sweat them first. I think blending them will release more sulfur. They won't smell great in this state when they're raw but I'm not sure about bitterness. \n\nBe forewarned, I grated shallots for a dish that was pressure cooked, and the smell that came from the instant pot was unbearable. My apartment reeked for days. The grating broke down the shallots too much, so blending onions may give you the same result."]}

Latch the lid by lining up the arrows, setting it down on the base and rotate it to align the handles. When it boils it should be venting steam out of the blue valve somewhere. Move the lever to the 1 position to get it to start building pressure. That silver thing in the middle of the blue valve will probably start moving up as pressure increases. If it continuously vents steam while building pressure then something is not tightened properly or the seals are bad. If it seems to be holding at position 1 you could move the lever to 2. At each pressure setting it may vent some steam to maintain pressure. It shouldn't be a lot.\n\nWhen you're done testing you can turn it off and leave it to cool down or SLOWLY move the adjustment lever down and let it vent steam.

Cooked for 1hr, no early release", "This is a hard one to put into words without over explaining or answering your question with a lot of other answers.\n\nSo, the whole point of a pressure cooker is to cook under the high heat and pressure. The pressure helps to evenly disperse heat around the cut of meat, while also forcing the heat into the meat at a higher rate. The increased rate of heat absorption due to the highly heated and pressurized steam helps to break down the meat at a much quicker pace and more evenly throughout the meat.\n\nAs for overcooking/drying out, it is possible with most anything you cook under pressure but you just need to know you equipment and what you are cooking. You can also treat your protein differently to achieve different results, such as cutting it into smaller pieces to cook quicker, searing the outside on high heat to help lock in juices and develop flavor, or pre-tenderizing using a marinade or tool.\n\nJust as an example, I love making pinto beans in a pressure cooker, as you get them in an hour and the water can turn into more of like a thick soup base. Thing is, how you treat the beans prior can change a lot of the cooking process.\n\nIf you soak the beans the night before, you can lose some of the starch, thinning the end product while not requiring as much water or cooking time, as they've already become saturated and won't require as much during the cooking process.\n\nIf you don't soak your beans overnight, then the liquid can become very thick as that starch is released as the water and steam is forced into the beans. You have to add a large amount of water and keep an eye on it as well though, as the beans will not only absorb water, but the older jiggle top pressure cookers constantly release steam and can end up causing the beans to burn if to much water is lost. You may have to de-pressure the pot, add water, and cook for longer than the soaked beans."]}

And the Instant Pot does not have any saved settings. So, on the Cosori I could hit the \"poultry\" button (or whichever button) and it would automatically set the unit for the time and pressure. The Instant Pot unit does not have any of these buttons or saved settings! It's crap! I thought since it had an app I could save recipes and settings in the app and just use that to control the unit, but no. The unit itself does not even have WiFi to connect to the app! You have to manually dial in the settings for everything you cook. No way to save it or assign it to a button, and no preset settings on the device from the factory. Complete crap!\n\nSo the Instant Pot comes with a fancy air fryer lid, but as a pressure cooker the cheap Cosori unit is better. If I'd noticed this (I hadn't used the device yet) before I donated my Cosori to a thrift store, I'd have kept the Cosori and returned the Instant Pot."]}

The pressure control valve is excellent. It's easy to adjust the pressure and clearly shows where it's at. By far the best thing to me is that the valve allows controlled pressure release. You can turn it so it slowly lets pressure out or do the more typical rapid release. My previous pressure cookers couldn't do easy controlled releases. The Magefesa could do a controlled release if you stood there and carefully held the release handle up.

Smaller pieces of food cook faster and have more surface area to release the flavor.  After cooking at full pressure for 10 minutes, everything will be well cooked and tender.    If you want to extract even more flavor and body, you can use a stickblender or regular blender to puree everything before straining.  That's if you want a full-body stock, cloudy and thick.  If you want a clear stock, then you can just strain the ingredients and look up how to clarify it with egg.  The egg will bind to other proteins, fats and food particles when it cooks, leaving a clearer broth.\n\nSome people mistakenly think that the cooking times for stock from beef, pork, and chicken are all the same.   But chickens are not large farm animals with huge bones.  Chickens have small bones that will quickly release their collagen under pressure.  Beef and pork bones take longer to do this because they're so much bigger.\n\nIf you aren't even using chicken bones or other pieces like wing tips and chicken feet, then you don't even have the collagen to extract.\n\nMaking stock from merely chicken meat and veggies can be done in 10-15 minutes.

That way, you don't get extra liquid affecting the taste of the chicken.\n\nAs for oxtail, you could use the same method as for steaming chicken. It will take a very long time though.

Therefore, your assertions are false because you are using a false assumption and conclusions that your subjective opinion about taste is true for everyone because it's an inherent property of the food, protein and cooking method when that's not true and is an overgeneralization.\n\nEven a small amount of heating can change the flavor of foods that remain entirely uncooked.  Try tasting a raw slice of sushi grade fish like bluefin tuna or king salmon at different temperatures and you'll probably taste a big difference because the temperature affect how the fat melts, how solid or soft the meat is, how quickly it softens, and how cold food can stop your taste buds from working at all by freezing them.   Taste buds require bloodflow for the nerves to fire and send signals to your brain.\n\nWhat you're calling \"gamey\" seems to be a misinterpretation or highly skewed perspective of what's happening.   If you boil proteins/meats in plain water with no seasoning or preparation, you're highly diluting its flavor because the water is acting as a solvent.   Boiling meats in plain water extracts the flavor in it without adding any of the flavors that we associate with flavorful meat: salt, fat, browning, charring, caramelization, etc.   Even when boiling meat to make a good soup or stock, we still must add a lot of flavor to the liquid to make up for the dilution of the flavor of the meat.    This is why most bad cooks use water instead of always looking for an opportunity to use better liquids to add flavor - not subtract it.\n\nTherefore, the \"off-flavor\" that you're describing about slow cooking is most probably the very poor technique and recipe that detracts from the flavor instead of enhancing it.   It's just bad cooking - not bad food or bad tools.   Usually good flavor is the result of knowledge and skill about how to enhance the food.   This is one of the fundamentals of French cuisine, for example, to take advantage of the ingredients for maximum flavor, texture, odor, and eye appeal through every step of the process.", "I had a pressure cooker, electric wolfgang puck, that whatever cooked in it took on some \"flavor\" of the rubber ring seal. Really odd. Now my newer one doesnt suffer that \"issue\". I found all pressure and slow/crock cookers tend to leech out the flavor of the meat (protein) into the tidal wave of juice. The juice is flavorful and a mixture of everything in the pot but the mostly tender meat, not so much."]}

The sink becomes a make-shift bain marie water bath.

During my last 2 usages I've noticed that it takes around 30 minutes to build up the needed pressure/temperature while using 2 cups of rice and 2 cups of water (around 160-200 ml of water, so keep the ratio 1:1 or even slightly less water). I did clean the cover and it looks very clean after each cooking in general. I clean the rice from starch before cooking.

Food gathers in the top around the gutter and smells and because it is made of plastic, it also absorbs smells from things so it just perpetually stinks instapot never did. It's disgusting. Whenever you cook anything, you smell everything you've cooked for the last few years. Gross there is no way to get the smell out. I've tried everything. It's also nigh on impossible to get bits of food out of the gutter that surrounds the edge or rim of the pot because it is just very badly designed. The pot that you cook in itself is held up okay.

Nope, turns out it just doesn't turn on anymore. Who knows what else will start to go. I will probably try to get an instant pot delivered immediately, so I doubt that I will have anything else to contribute to the review. Total regret this is a terrible purchase. Do not buy it.

We LOVE to cook, but don't have time during the week. But we still need budget friendly, nutritious, homemade food.\nTime really is of the essence as we may have 30 minutes we are willing to spend making tomorrow's food before we need to pass out for the night. \nWe don't mind doing a lot of food prep 1-2 days a week so things are ready to throw into a cooker at night. We would generally make food and have it ready in Tupperware for the next day. Morning prep time is not going to happen. \n\nIs a PK really faster? I keep hearing about time it takes to come to pressure and depressurizing, etc. I'm really looking for a quick meal maker for the little time we do have. \n\nI've heard there are models that come to pressure faster than the instant pot,  but never heard someone say which ones.

So my meal took closer to an hour to cook....still it's shorter than doing it the non-PC way.", "Any of those models are fine. I recommend getting one with a yogurt program, worth trying.\n\nPressure cookers can do entire meals but owing to cooking times not everything is possible.

It makes like the important 80 % of a meal.", "Yes. Pressure cookers will let you cook faster and do make a difference. \n\nThey are great tools for people who work outside the home and need to cook a meal fast. Stove top pressure cookers are faster than electric but require attention. I do not believe that to save a few minutes it would be worth it for you to give up the automation of an electric pressure cooker. I own both stove top and electric and usually reach for the electric ones so that I do not have to bother with keeping track of time. \n\nKeep in mind that they excel at braising and are not intended for \u201cdry\u201d cooking. \n\nDo not waste money on units with lots of preprogrammed buttons. They are not needed. The one exception is the yogurt button. It does simplify the process. The other programmed buttons are a function of time vs power, both of which you can control with the power and time buttons yourself. In my opinion, the \u201ccrisping\u201d tops are not worth the extra expense. \n\nAs far as brands, the basic Instant Pots are a good choice. There are many videos and recipes dedicated to the brand. So your learning curve will be well covered. If you can only buy 1, get a 6 qt. \n\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask some more.", "I've had an instant pot brand pressure cooker, the 6 quart size, for six or seven years and it's the one I would recommend. Don't get a fancy one that does multiple things, something always seems to not live up to expectations. Even the one I have has a slow cooker function that I've never used, that's not its forte.", "OP\nThe 8qt will need more liquid just because of the size, so it may take a little longer than the smaller ones. One way to avoid using a ton of liquid when the type of recipe itself does not call for so much liquid, is to use the pot in pot method. You may want to look for some YouTube videos about this. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that an 8 qt will take up a lot of room to store. Think it through whether you really need an 8 qt. \n\nI totally understand your reasoning,  and I get it, because I normally get the larger one of anything. However, for every night cooking for a couple of people, I believe a 6 qt is more manageable.\n\nEdit: Another point to consider, the 8qt will take longer to \u201cde-pressurize.\u201d", "I know it's been a little while since you posted, but I wanted to chime in in case you haven't found your perfect pressure cooker yet. It sounds like you're juggling a lot, and a pressure cooker could really save you time without sacrificing healthy meals.\n\nYou\u2019re right that pressure cookers like the Instant Pot Duo Pro and Duo Plus are super popular and well-advertised. They are great options, but since you're looking for something that really saves time, there are a few things to consider. The cook times themselves are quick, but the time it takes to come to pressure and then to depressurize can vary by model. If speed is key, you might want to look into models that have faster heat-up times.\n\nThe **Instant Pot Nova 6** is one that\u2019s pretty quick and within your budget, while the **Ninja Foodi** models are another great option. They tend to heat up faster than the Instant Pot and are really versatile, too. Some newer models have features that help streamline cooking for different types of dishes, which sounds like it could be super useful for your busy schedule.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re prepping ingredients ahead of time and then using the cooker in the evening, you should definitely be able to hit that 30-minute meal window you\u2019re aiming for.\n\nI actually put together a blog post with a guide to the best pressure cookers, including models with faster heat-up times and detailed comparisons of features. It might be helpful if you\u2019re still shopping around for the right one!

Carcass from rotisserie bird, and/or really inexpensive backs & necks, and if thighs are on sale use them!  Always a few chicken feet, which provide body, protein and flavor.  Roasting uncooked chicken does add flavor, but I don't often have the time.\n\nBasic Veg:  By all means, use frozen scraps & ends & uglies here!   I aim for a couple carrots, 2-3 celery stalks (with green tops), 1 big onion *with yellow skin on* (hey, you want gold colored stock, right?), and if I've got them, a couple of garlic cloves, mushrooms, etc.  I stay away from the cabbage family.\n\nFlavor Secrets:  Bay leaf, Cloves, Parsley, Thyme.  Salt (not too much) & cracked pepper (dozen peppercorn, 1 teaspoon).   I \"pin\" a bay leaf to a chunk of onion with a clove twig.  Good handful of parsley from the freezer where I stashed it when the fresh started to get limp.\n\nPut it all in the PC, and add water to cover plus a shot of vinegar (white or apple cider) and seal.  After it comes to pressure, I cook at high for 1 hour and then natural release which takes my stovetop PC about 1/2 hour.  You're the cook -- go ahead and nibble the vegetables!

Let's say if the 6.5 liter sized pressure cooker requires 1 cup of water so would the larger 12.5 liter sized pressure cooker require 2 cups of water to cook that amount of chicken?\n\nSecond question:\n2. I understand 6.5 liter pressure cooker will build up or come to full pressure faster than larger 12.5 liter pressure cooker due pan volume and water amount.And release the pressure earlier than the larger sized pressure cooker.\n\n Question is approximately how much time  difference would I see between the 6.5 liter pressure cooker and 12.5 liter pressure cooker in building up of pressure and releasing of some of that pressure in the first whistle? \n\nLet's say for example the smaller 6.5 liter cooker builds up pressure and releases it in the first whistle in approximately 8 to 10 minutes.So how much time the 12.5 liter pressure cooker would take for build up pressure and releasing some of that in the first whistle? Approximately 13 to 15 minutes or longer like 17 to 20 minutes?\n\nQuestion 3. After building up of pressure and releasing of some of that pressure in the first whistle on both 6.5 liter pressure cooker and 12.5 liter cooker does the rest of cooking process of those 4 kg chicken take noticeably different amount of time?Or rest of the cooking process on both those pressure cookers roughly take more or less same amount of time without any noticeable  difference in time?\n\nQuestion 4. After the cooking is done does the natural release of pressure take longer for 12.5 liter cooker compared to 6.5 liter cooker?How much difference in time between these two above mentioned sized pressure cooker?Let's say 6.5 liter cooker takes more or less 15 minutes to naturally release  pressure after the flame is turned off.How long approximately it would take for 12.5 liter cooker to naturally release pressure after the flame is turned of?\n\nThank you for reading the wall of text.Please do share your experience in a reply or two.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1bg4fhq/so_a_couple_of_things_i_need_to_know_about/", "created_utc": 1710590297.0, "score": 2, "author": "Skeuomorph7", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1bg4fhq/so_a_couple_of_things_i_need_to_know_about/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Do not intentionally cause a \"whistle\".

I can't remember the particular dishes, but they're ones that start with very little water with ingredients that will release more during cooking - just enough water, basically, to make enough steam to bring it to pressure.

Originally I started with an 8L model, then I got a smaller one (2L?) for making rice.\n\nMy wife is Japanese and pressure cooked rice is her preference, especially for Haiga rice, which is a sort of hybrid brown/white rice. (Zojirushi makes a rice cooker that does pressure cooked rice, but it's not as fast as a 15 PSI pressure cooker and results are not as good, IMHO.)\n\nI used my pressure cooker for everything initially, but ideally they work best for meats, grains, and beans. For vegetables, other than root veggies, I found it too difficult to time tenderness consistently.\n\nFor the Kuhn Rikon pots I had to replace the main gaskets once or maybe twice, plus some of the plug gaskets in the lid which got hard. I used both, often daily.\n\nEventually both pots stopped sealing well when building pressure. Meaning, steam would escape and pressure would not build. Pulling on the spring often caused them to seal and build pressure. I'm guessing it was simply a gasket issue but they never worked consistently after replacing the gaskets.\n\nI also used an induction burner. I got one since the counter top burners have a timer which was useful for making rice. Eventually uneven heating expansion caused the bottom plates to warp and separate from the aluminum layers. Once the bottom plate warps it will eventually peel off, unfortunately.\n\nOnce I updated my kitchen range to induction range, I could no longer use either one pot. I tried buying two new steel plates but I had no way to reliably glue the plates in place. They would eventually separate.\n\nIf I bought a gas stove, not induction, I probably would keep them.\n\nKuhn Rikon did not offer any way to repair them. I had considered asking some local metal fabricators in Seattle if they could help but it just seems sensible to give both away. (If you want them, PM me, I want them to have a good home.)\n\nOther complaints: Yes they are initially very shiny and pretty. But unfortunately, they eventually will get greasy and dull. I've spent time scrubbing them but they go back to being dull. I also lost broke both lid caps, and replaced them both and they broke again.\n\nI also have an Insta-Pot and aluminum pot I got for camping\u2013was only like $25. The Insta-Pot works well enough but takes time to heat up and isn't as fast.

How much it reduces it depends on a lot of factors, so it's not precisely predictable in advance.  It's better to undercook expensive beef that's already tender and then add time, rather than overcook it.  Pressure cooking is generally a poor choice of cooking method for prime rib, filet mignon, NY strip, porterhouse, T-bone, and other quality beef loin and sirloin cuts.   It's basically the same as boiling or steaming quality beef because it doesn't enhance the flavor compared to dry heat roasting cooking methods.  But it's really just a matter of preference and taste.  If you pay for the meat and you enjoy the results after pressure cooking it, then it's good enough for you.    Rick Mammana may have different tastes and be easily satisfied.   He did brown the meat nicely before pressure cooking and he seasoned the liquid and put a lot of garlic and pepper on top.

Inside the cooker there is liquid water and steam.  The pressure allows the liquid water to get hotter before turning to steam, but it needs the pressure to keep it liquid.  The vent lets off the steam, and lowers the pressure, and as it does so some of the water turns into steam.  The problem you faced is that you depressurized to the point you could force the lid open, but not to the point that it was actually safe to do so.  There might have only been a pound of pressure in there, but there's a heck of a lot of energy still in the water at that pound.  Also, when a drop of water turns into steam, its volume increases dramatically.  If that drop of water is under your food, it will push your food up as it forms.  Scale this up to a good chunk of the water that's in there and *everything* is going to be coming out the top of the cooker at a very high speed.\n\nTo prevent this, don't open the cooker until it has fully vented *on its own*.  Giving it that time allows the liquid water to vaporize as it depressurizes in a controlled manner, so by the time you go to open it there is no instantaneous conversion of water to steam.  You can't cheat physics, you really need to wait until it's done venting.  Some people cool it off a little quicker by running water over it, I've never done that but it's a thing.  It doesn't take that long where I'm terribly interested in speeding up the process.  You are very lucky you didn't get hurt.  Pressure cookers contain a lot of energy.  That doesn't mean you should be scared of them, but you do need to respect them and use them properly.  Anything else and you are asking to get hurt or killed (yes, it has enough energy to kill you, and it has killed people who used them improperly in the past)."]}

Please note that I have absolutely no relationship with the manufacturer or sellers and I paid for the item because I wanted it :)\n\nThe Avalla K-45 electric pressure cooker is by far the smallest pressure cooker I've found, and for me and my wife it's perfect.\n\nWe have a tiny kitchen, and there are only the two of us to cook for. All the big, electric pressure cookers are simply too much. I've used a Kuhn Rikon stovetop pressure cooker for decades (and still will for bigger things) but I really wanted the quick ease of something electric and automatic for everyday meals. And it had to be small. Even cleaning the Kuhn Rikon is awkward in our kitchen.\n\nThis K-45 has a footprint of only 21cm diameter, and a height of 28cm. It's tiny compared to every other electric pressure cooker I've looked at. The pictures include a standard sized tin for comparison. Despite its diminutive size and light weight, it feels very sturdy and well made.\n\nPot capacity is 2.5L, which is just right for a good portion of vegetables each (we like a lot of veg), or a full meal. Today I cooked broccoli and cauliflower in it, to go with a steak pie. It cooked perfectly in the default 10 minutes veg setting. There was plenty of veg for two and it could have fit more. Avalla claims four portions can be cooked; I would agree with 'normal' veg portions. Cleanup is easy with the non-stick coating, and they say it can even go in the dish washer (we don't have one - too small to fit one here). Cleaning the K-45 was quicker than cleaning my Kuhn Rikon, even though you have to clean the lid, steam guard and pot.\n\nHeating power is 800W. That is clearly enough as the K-45 gets up to temperature and pressure within a few minutes, with plenty of water in for the vegetables I cooked. The outside of the K-45 got just lukewarm after 10 minutes cooking (the timer starts when it reaches temperature), and there was no steam escape whatsoever until I used the steam release. It was so quiet that I wasn't convinced it was actually working at first, other than the timer counting down, so I nudged to steam release after a few minutes to check. It was working alright!\n\nThe K-45 is not a multi-cooker really, although it can steam and warm food as well. To steam, you just leave the steam release lever open and use the steam setting. There is a button to activate keep warm, which the K-45 will also do automatically at the end of a program. There are simple programs for a few food types (potatoes/veg, rice, soup etc.) and the cooking time can be adjusted on any of them with the +/- buttons. There's also a delay start timer, which I'll be making use of so I can be lazy.\n\nIncluded with the K-45 is a simple, clear instruction book, plastic rice spoon, measuring cup and a kettle-type lead about 1m long. I prefer that to a fixed lead as I can change it for a different length if I need to, and it's neater to pack away with the lead inside the pot. It won't be packed away though. Tiny as our kitchen is, I'm rearranging it to fit the K-45 on the worktop because it's going to be used a lot.\n\nI've been really pleased with the K-45. It's silly-easy to use, quiet, quicker than using my stove top pressure cooker and no doubt uses a lot less energy. And it takes up hardly any room. Time will tell on the longevity of it but Avalla gives a two year guarantee, which gives me a little extra peace of mind.", "It looks like it\u2019s based on the Pressure King"]}

That will reducing the cooking and release time to less than 15 minutes, unless you're at very high altitude.\n\nIf you want to cook them dry without soaking, you need to increase the cooking time to 50-60 minutes, add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and salt as the only ingredients to the water.  Definitely don't add any acidic ingredients.\n\nWhy?  Some T-Fal pressure cookers use a lower pressure than normal, 8-10psi, not 15 psi.   The baking soda helps to compensate for acidic or hard water with certain bad mineral or metals, like iron.   The amount of the water also varies by the size of the red bean, with small beans needing 6-8 cups of water per pound, and larger ones needing 8-10 cups of water per pound.   You should be able to confirm this via the instructions on the package of beans.", "Camellia's basic red bean cooking directions [here](https://archive.ph/doQad) are pretty good IME: 6 cups water per pound of unsoaked beans, with 40 minutes under pressure give a roughly 10psi electric cooker or apparently some T-Fal models using around the same. I usually give the beans 45, then also simmer for a while longer with the lid off after adding the sauted trinity and meat plus most of the seasonings in like I would for slower-cooked red beans. I also prefer them extra creamy and thick,  but IME they have always turned out nice and soft after Camellia's recommended time.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't think that adjusting the cooking time down should even be necessary if you're using 15psi, since you are aiming for falling apart soft here. Maybe just try the 40 minutes starting out. If they're still hard after that, it may just be that particular batch of dry beans."]}

I did try to post a few days ago but was having issues, gave up and forgot. I had this model for a short time last fall (long story). Ended up replacing with another dedicated rice cooker (CRP-BHSS0609F) and the multi cooker CMC-QSN501S. Most recently I added CMC-ASB501F.  We eat a lot of rice and often a rice cooker and multi cooker will be used simultaneously. Now I remember your unit seemed to do fine with rice. My experience so far with the CMC-QSN501S would be to avoid for anyone looking to use primarily for rice and secondarily as a multi cooker. As far as the CMC-ASB501F, although there are now multiple rice settings the results for rice as well not been stellar.  However, I have had rather limited experience with that function in that unit and it just may take some \u201ctweaking\u201d.  They are again primarily and quite heavily used as multi cookers in my home.  \nI agree that Cuckoo could do better with documentation and support for these units. They do promptly answer questions and warranty issues by email. I will not promise the answer always makes sense. One example, when new, I had a question about the unexpected (unannounced) steam releases when using the multi cook setting. If using the other programmed settings this doesn\u2019t occur so I wanted to make sure this was normal. For some reason cuckoo referred the question to one of their service centers. To my surprise, someone at one actually answered the phone. He seemed a bit confused but confidently told me to read the book and cook with it twice. I thanked him politely,  hung up, and broke out laughing.  Normal function. Reading documentation I have found online from other units did help fill in some gaps on functions and settings.   \nRecipes are limited from Cuckoo America. You can get more from Cuckoo Brunei (kitchen.cuckoobrunei.com). Cuckoo Malaysia did have some recipes but I think they may have only a few on their instagram site now. There is some random stuff occasionally you will encounter out there with the multi cookers they marketed in Eastern Europe as well. Eventually you will get a feel for how to adjust IP and other recipes.   \nThere are a couple good Korean YouTube videos out there that cover repairs. Additionally helpful if you ever have one of those \u201caccidents\u201d and have the need to breakdown the unit to really clean\u2026  \nI really wish they had included a trivet with that unit (ST0609F).  Anyway, the trivet with the 10 cup multi cooker is useless  due to a central post.  Thankfully the IP silicone trivet/sling will fit. The 6 cup rice cooker came with a useful trivet that would fit your unit but I have not seen it for sale on their website.  You can not fit the IP sling in this pot. In your unit I did use a folded up inner shelf of a Lekue steam case as kind of a trivet as well as other random silicone kitchen items. Cobble something together or try to find an appropriate size on amazon. Food safe, high temperature silicone could be used to coat metal to try to protect your pot coating if you are forced to go that route.  \nI apologize for the length. Good luck and have fun!  \nOH- remember buy a replacement pot and gasket when and if this is available.", "With the pressure setting, you can do Uzbek plov.

Beans will froth a lot when quick released, and natural release takes a lot of time for the pressure/heat to fall.   Cold water is the best method for beans, so long as you can easily transfer the pot to the sink safely.

Then it pressure cooks for only a couple of minutes.  The rice is starch.  It's a thickener.  No need to rinse the rice to get rid of starch you want to have anyways.   Adding a corn starch slurry to thicken this soup is a waste of time and duplicated effort for no benefit.  The diced potatoes are another thickener.  \n\nWith the proper amount of rice, liquid and pressure cooking, this recipe could be made in half the time and fewer steps, with a better result.   Rice and potatoes are the only thickeners needed.  Just double the rice up to 1.5 cups.   It will still be soup at this ratio, just thicker.  This can be completely pressure cooked in 10 minutes total, in one step.   Instead of stock and bouillon, you can use just one or the other.  They serve the same purpose - chicken flavored liquid.   The dry herbs are rather light, only a half teaspoon each, for 8 cups of liquid?  1-2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning would be more flavorful with more herbs:  thyme, sage, black pepper, marjoram, rosemary and nutmeg.

I am very bad with cooking appliances and if somebody has experience with the same multicooker making rice I would be happy if you could tell me exactly like I am an idiot (which I am about these stuff) step by step what to click so that I can make the rice.\n\nThe exact model is  Tefal CY505E Fast & Delicious Multicooker or here is the amazon link -[https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Delicious-Multicooker-Electric-Automatic-Stainless/dp/B089KS86WS/ref=sxin\\_36\\_amzexc?adgrpid=82888510740&content-id=amzn1.sym.847d2d9a-cab6-4e6f-ae6e-d401b6deb556%3Aamzn1.sym.847d2d9a-cab6-4e6f-ae6e-d401b6deb556&cv\\_ct\\_cx=tefal&hvadid=394603400058&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1001454&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=15181422118165413617&hvtargid=kwd-10621811&hydadcr=22032\\_1956401&keywords=tefal&pd\\_rd\\_i=B089KS86WS&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-2-927bf3db-8647-462d-8059-e6876d2261d4](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Delicious-Multicooker-Electric-Automatic-Stainless/dp/B089KS86WS/ref=sxin_36_amzexc?adgrpid=82888510740&content-id=amzn1.sym.847d2d9a-cab6-4e6f-ae6e-d401b6deb556%3Aamzn1.sym.847d2d9a-cab6-4e6f-ae6e-d401b6deb556&cv_ct_cx=tefal&hvadid=394603400058&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1001454&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=15181422118165413617&hvtargid=kwd-10621811&hydadcr=22032_1956401&keywords=tefal&pd_rd_i=B089KS86WS&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-2-927bf3db-8647-462d-8059-e6876d2261d4)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1618nva/sushi_rice_help/", "created_utc": 1692991665.0, "score": 7, "author": "pokoslav", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1618nva/sushi_rice_help/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["My time to shine! \u2728\u2728 \n\nI haven't used the multi cooker, but my lil rice pot pretty much heats water till it's all boiled off then switches off. It uses a sensor or a heat Sentice wire inside. \n\nYour multicooker will prob boil/steam for about 15-20 mins and then beep off. As long as you have the ratios right, it should be enough for sushi rice. \n\nIn my family, we \"wash\" the rice. This means running cold water into a pot with the rice. My dad says do it three times, you must make a claw with your hand and mix it around in the rice and water. It helps it get off the starchy powder from transportation and storage (basically it's covered in powder from the rice rubbing together). I think they used to put talc or something wayyy back in the day, too. But it'll help your rice be more clean and less goupy. The water should run pretty clear. You should use your hand to hold back the rice and drain as much water in between each \"washing\". If you want to use a fine mesh strainer, you can. But you will likely lose a rice grain or two, it's normal, or you won't feel like it's drained enough for the next wash. Also normal. \n\nMy friend also soaks his rice for 20mins in the summer and 30 in the winter. I tried and I liked the result. You don't have to do this though. \n\nThe ratio I was taught was 1:1.2 of rice to water. You might need to play around to get a texture you like, it's always better to have less water than not enough. If you end up with too hard of a rice than you like, pour a little (ideally hot water) water in and turn the cooker back on for 5-6 mins then shut off and move to the next stage. \n\nWhen the cooker turns off, or signals it's done, it's good to let the rice sit in the steam for like 10-15 mins more. It helps give the rice a bit of time to absorb more water and get a bit less sticky and more fluffy. You can use a fork or something similar to fluff the rice up. Of it doesn't turn off, I would recommend unplugging it, I find the rice gets a bit over cooked on the bottom if you don't. It'll stay plenty hot while it steams \n\nI've made sushi rice before, but sushi is still good without the extra steps of adding the vinegar and sugar if you don't want. It's fun to make onegiri, even a simple one with just salt is very yum! If you want to make it the traditional way, you should watch some videos but you'll need to fan the rice while you mix it. It's fun! \n\nDon't let the sushi chefs hear me say this but tou can also use any short grain glutinous rice, like red rose, you don't have to buy sushi grade rice. If you have an Asian supermarket of any size nearby, go and ask them about short grain rice, it should be plenty sticky enough and maybe save you some pennies.\n\nEnjoy. I hope my rice snobbery is helpful.", "I\u2019ve used the pressure cooker mode on the Ninja Foodi for sushi rice. It\u2019s worked pretty well so far.\n\n2-3 mins pressure cook on High, with 10 mins delayed release. The water ratio it suggests in the manual is for min 200g:310ml .\n\nI wash the rice a few times before cooking, and when it\u2019s done, I open the lid, scrape the bottom and then close it for another 5 mins or so."]}

If you want to either air fry or sous vide, I recommend getting an 8 qt for the capacity.   A 6 qt will be very small.

But if you would like to have a sous vide machine or one that actually slow cooks or makes yogurt, then the extra features might be nice to have. But be careful cause as angrygnome pointed out, having extra features may mean that it does poorly on all features. I don't know if Instant Pot has improved their technology, but I remember watching a review showing how the slow cook option was too cold and didn't actually cook their food.

Chickpeas and many beans release proteins and carbohydrates into the water that cause it to thicken, which can produce foam that can spray everywhere as the burst of steam is released from the whistle when the liquid rapidly boils due to the sudden lowering of the pressure.  The chefs you followed deserve most of the blame for posting bad pressure cooking recipes using whistle timing instead of clock timing.\n\nInstead of using whistles, you should use an accurate timing chart for chickpeas like the following:\n\nhttp://fastcooking.ca/pressure_cookers/cooking_times_pressure_cooker.php#pulses\n\nThis chart indicates that soaked chickpeas take about 9-14 minutes to cook at 15psi with additional time for pressure to naturally release.  It indicates 13-18 minutes for soaked beans with a quick release - but I don't recommend doing a quick release because it can cause exactly the same foaming mess as what you experienced.

The whole point of pressure cooking is to hold the steam inside to the safe tested full pressure level for it to achieve the maximum temperature.\n\nAn analogy is the RPM rev limiter that many cars have in their electronic fuel injection computer, which is designed to prevent engine damage when exceeding the maximum RPM that's been set (usually by killing the spark plug ignition or some other drastic measure).  You're not supposed to intentionally hit the max RPM and let the rev limiter constantly be employed.  The rev limiter is an emergency backup process to prevent damage when you screw up or you're being an idiot.\n\nYou're supposed use your own brain to set the throttle appropriately to avoid exceeding the redline and causing the RPM limiter to be employed.  The assumption is that you should know not to constantly use 100% wide open throttle all the time, by adjusting the throttle based on many conditions you should be controlling and observing, which the limiter can't do.  The limiter is simple and stupid.  The driver is supposed to be smarter than the limiter.  The limiter is there to reduce the consequences of mistakes or stupidity, not to replace or substitute for the drivers control of the throttle.\n\nSame goes for this kind of pressure cooker.  You're supposed to adjust the heat level to maintain full pressure without causing the weight to be lifted enough to release a lot of steam.\n\nIt's at full pressure when the weight merely floats, rotates, and has a small amount of steam being released.  This kind of weight doesn't drastically jiggle or rock.  It merely floats like an air bearing, with the steam just lowering the friction that prevents it from barely floating.  When the weight is floating, you reduce the heat to just keep it floating, that's all.   If the weight regulator pops up and releases a lot of steam, you didn't lower the heat enough, and now you've wasted that steam and cause the pressure/temperature to fall a lot, requiring the pressure to build up again to reach full pressure.\n\nPerhaps now you can see that letting the pressure continually build up and be released is just wasting heat and slowing down the cooking process for no good reason at all."]}

Put differently, you'd have to simmer a tomato sauce for a really long time to get the same flavours as a pressure cooker.", "There's no difference in the flavor of a boiled vs. pressure cooked potato.  Pressure cooking is merely faster due to the higher temperature.   Baked potato gets some additional flavor from the browning of the skin on the outside, but not nearly as much if it's baked in aluminum foil, which basically steams it and prevents browning.\n\nIf you peel and dice potatoes first, pressure cooking them will only take about 6 minutes to fully cook when submerged in the liquid.  Whole potatoes will take a lot longer based on how big they are.   A minute of dicing or slicing can save 20 or more minutes of cooking time.  A big potato acts as heat insulation to slow down the cooking to heat up the center.   Same goes for big pieces of meat:  the cooking time greatly increases as the size/mass is larger.\n\nYou can easily overcook or undercook foods with pressure cooking, all depending on the kind of food.   Most vegetables will be mushy after 10-20 minutes at pressure, which can be ok for stews, soups, and purees where you don't care.   You have to be extra careful with tomato because it will thicken and burn at the bottom of the pressure cooking pot, since you can't stir it while under pressure.   Anything that thickens can be a problem when pressure cooking if it prevents the liquid from circulating at the bottom, trapping the heat and burning the food.\n\nFor a bolognese sauce, it's better to tenderize the meats first under pressure, and then add the tomatoes and sauce afterwards so that you can simmer and stir it frequently to avoid burning the bottom as it reduces and thickens.", "I make a killer 5# boneless pork loin in an hour and a half (Start to Finish) using my 10qt Presto Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, with an interior basket and spacer setup.

{"title": "Impressions of Zavor Duo and Fissler Vitaquick (small review)", "selftext": "Splitting up with your partner after 11 years involves a lot of pain, and one of those pains is that I am losing my old, trusty, pressure-cookers(a 6 quart Presto, my favorite, and a 6 quart Lagostina). But, I decided to turn this into an opportunity to maybe upgrade.  So, I settled on a budget and went hunting.  I ended up getting a Fissler Vitaquick 6 quarts and Zavor Duo 8 quarts(much cheaper than the fissler 8 ).  I was also eyeing the Presto 8 quarts(stainless steel version), but I prefer to have an handle, so I decided to give Zavor a try instead.   Here is a quick review of both.\n\nAs a small backgroud, I've cooked with pressure-cookers ever since I left home 30 years ago.  And before that, my mother used them extensively to save cooking time (raised on a farm where time is precious)  I also tried using multipurpose electric pressure cooker, but simply never really liked those and I am using exclusively stovetop units now.\n\nFirst, the Zavor.  When it arrived, I had some bones ready to make beef broth, so I was able to quickly test it.  First thing I noticed when I got it out of the box is the weight.  It was insanely light for the size.  I admit this did not sit well with me.  The bottom was not as thick as I would have liked, and the sides appeared real thin too, having almost a crystal ring to it when I hit it with my nail. The silicone ring seemed a tad too small for the top too, and didn\u2019t look as solid as what I was used with Presto.   But hey, as long as it cook nicely, right?  So, I cleaned it, made sure everything was in working order(using the manual as reference) and was about to start making the broth when I noticed something\u2026 The manual stated 18/10 stainless steel, just like the store website, but the box said: 18/8.  Uh?  So I wrote to Zavor to verify.  I then proceeded to make the broth.  Well, my enthusiasm died as quickly as the pressure rose.  There are lot of things I instantly disliked about this unit.  First, while the pressure build, there is a lot of water dripping from the handle, and some steam comes out on all side while the ring expand in its spot.  Second, when it reached the right pressure, the \u201cexhaust\u201d is on the side of the cover, and it send the steam downward.  The problem?  If you use the right side element of your oven, you are about 100% sure the steam will get directly on your countertop!!!  Third, that thing was dripping water from the left side too.  I stopped everything, made sure the ring was positioned ok(it was), I removed the handle and made sure all was tight (it was) and restarted the process.  Same result, water dripping by the handle, and once pressure was reached, additional dripping on the left side.  Looking online, I saw I was not the only one with that problem.   Plus, the handle still wiggled a bit left to right when the steam is at 15 psi.  That wasn\u2019t reassuring, I am used to handles locking completely when the pressure is reached.  Keeping the steam at the right level was on par with what I was used to with my Presto, meaning I could lower the temp to mid-level, but not more.   I made the broth, but I was disenchanted at the functionality of the device.  Having to constantly wipe the excess water dripping on the heating surface, and making sure the outgoing steam doesn\u2019t touch the counter, is no fun.  A day later, the final nail in the coffin arrived when Zavor confirmed their \u201cnew\u201d factory, in China,  only made 18/8 stainless steel and they were in the process of updating the documentation.  Call it what you want, that\u2019s false advertisement, period.  I contacted the store who was very surprised at the change in stainless steel quality, and promptly told me to return the unit and that I would get a full refund, which I did.  Zavor is out.  Forever.  In that price range, I would select Presto(stainless steel version) or T-Fal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn to the Fissler 6 quarts, which arrived a few days later.  Taking it out of the box immediately felt good.  A good weight, but still easily used with one hand only.  A thick base, and sides that doesn\u2019t sound like crystal.  The sealing ring is also very thick and looks like it will last a long time.  And man does everything simply feel solid.  I decided to make rice for a quick test that evening, since that is a very good indicator if a base is thick enough(when too thin, the rice will stick or burn at the bottom).  Both my presto and Lagostina had some trouble with rice, especially the lagostina.  The unit is so silent that I was stunned when I saw the pressure level rise to the second bar, indicating the pressure was now at 15 psi.  I am so used to seeing more steam come out when it reach the right pressure!  After 3 minutes I cut the heat and let it depressurize over 10 minutes.  Well, the rice was puuurrrfect!  My oldest even commented on how it was \u201cjust right\u201d.  Not a single grain burned or stuck at the bottom.  I was impressed!  The next days I tried it again to make a beef stew, to test how it goes over a longer period.  Again, it reached 15 psi in complete silence, and once it reached 2 bars I had to lower the heat to the lowest setting!  I was able to forget about it for the next 25 mins without worries.  That means the base is really good at keeping the temperature stable.  After that 25 mins, I depressurised manually. This was easily done with the handle, but I admit having it comes out in a \u201cV\u201d shape makes for some gymnastic to make sure the steam doesn\u2019t go on a surface it shouldn\u2019t.  Then added the vegetables for another 5 mins at high pressure.  The stew was perfect.  Meat was melting in the mouth, and the vegetables had that nice beef broth taste.   I love \u201calmost\u201d everything about that unit.  It is sturdy, the cover locks perfectly, manual steam release is easy, no chance of burning yourself when doing so, no wiggling on the handle, the extra steam comes out on top while cooking(when it comes out, because, as mentioned, there are barely any coming out at all!!). Cleaning was super easy.  The only downside?  The 6 quarts base could be a tad wider IMHO, to help with browning more meat.\n\nI so loved this unit that I simply decided to get the 8 quarts version too to replace the Zavor, even though it busted the budget I had planned for the pressure cookers.(luckily, I managed to get both size on sale on Fissler website, so it wasn\u2019t so bad in the end)  After 3 weeks, I haven\u2019t a single regret.  They are a joy to use and the food comes out perfectly cooked and extra tasty every time.  And with the 8 quarts, I can now buy any chicken size without having to worry if it will fit or not.\n\nNow, if I ever get married again, I\u2019m making sure to have a contract signed that I keep both of these cookers if things goes south in the future :P", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PressureCooking/comments/1094k5b/impressions_of_zavor_duo_and_fissler_vitaquick/", "created_utc": 1673443296.0, "score": 19, "author": "kinwolf", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/PressureCooking/comments/1094k5b/impressions_of_zavor_duo_and_fissler_vitaquick/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you. \n\nLoyal Fagor user for nearly 30 years.

You're missing quite a few important ingredients, especially the mirepoix (celery, onion, carrot), herbs and seasonings like bay leaves and thyme, and salt+pepper.\n\nHere's a [classic recipe](https://toriavey.com/andersens-split-pea-soup/) from the largest seller of split pea soup in the world, [Pea Soup Andersen's Restaurants](http://www.peasoupandersens.net/historyBuellton.html) in California.   They've been selling split pea soup for nearly 100 years.  Their Travelers Special includes all-you-can-eat split pea soup and I remember as a kid taking full advantage of it, stuffing myself to the gills with soup when visiting Solvang, San Diego, or Santa Ynez where these restaurants were located.\n\nHere's [a version](https://www.seriouseats.com/30-minute-pressure-cooker-split-pea-soup-recipe) adapted for pressure cooking by Serious Eats.\n\nThe following warning is very important:  \"Split peas are particularly prone to clogging valves and foaming, so some precautions are necessary when cooking them in a pressure cooker. Do not attempt to double this recipe\u2014the split peas and liquid should not come more than halfway up the pot. Do not cut down on butter, since fat can help inhibit foaming; you can use oil in place of the butter and omit the ham if you're making a vegan version of the dish. If using a stovetop pressure cooker, do not set the heat higher than medium-high, and monitor carefully, lowering the heat to maintain pressure as soon as it has come to pressure. After cooking, make sure to immediately clean the gasket and valves on the lid as soon as the pot is cool enough to handle, since pea soup can clog the valves and harden if not properly cleaned.\"\n\nThis is why many pressure cooker models have dire warnings in the front of their manual specifically saying to not cook split peas.  It is dangerous for novices to cook split pea soup without knowing how to avoid the conditions that can clog the pressure valves and end up spraying boiling hot soup all over the kitchen.\n\nHam isn't really the main flavoring of split pea soup, although it's good for a smokey flavor.   In my opinion, the most important ingredient is the celery.   Split pea soup just doesn't taste right without celery.  Even celery salt is better than no celery at all.\n\nThere are other ways to get the smoked ham flavor.  One is to use \"ham base\" paste, either Better Than Bouillon brand or the ones sold by restaurant supply stores.   A better way for pressure cooking is to use smoked ham hocks.  Pressure cooking will tenderize them, but you'll need to remove them and chop/dice the meat before serving and remove the bones, of course.  Smoked hickory salt also works for vegetarian/vegan recipes.", "I much prefer pea soup made with yellow peas. However I can no longer find them on the store shelves.

Is it something specific they can quantify that you can try adjust in your recipes?  Too salty/sweet/spicy/aromatic/etc?\n\nThe problem here is that with braising or pressure cooking, the meat is going to donate a lot of its flavour and fat to the cooking liquid, and if served without it, will likely be dry and/or bland.\n\n> Pressure cookers also have a steam function, but i do believe its a seperate setting from pressure cooking.  So can I \"pressure steam\" with less liquid?\n\nAs long as you always include at least the minimum amount of liquid specified in your PC manual, and don't overfill the pot past the max line, you can adjust the amount however you'd like, whether or not you use a basket/trivet.\n\nJust be aware that the steam function on an electric pressure cooker is essentially just cooking at low pressure, usually only for a short period of time, to avoid overcooking delicate foods like vegetables, fish, or tofu.\n\nFor tough meats, you typically want high pressure over a longer period.

How much depends on your device. Steamed meat is, on the whole, pretty nasty. There are some exceptions, but grey, tough and bland are the usual outcome here. If your family hates casserole style meat dishes a pressure cooker is not necessarily the best one-pot device, but it can be useful. For example, I pressure cook beef cheek in wine/water/stock/vegetables for an hour then transfer to the oven to brown gently. You get the best of both worlds. Browning gets the flavour and the milliard reactions for caramelized crispy goodness, the pressure cooking gets the creamy soft texture without drying it out. I don't do this myself but some people get good results doing a similar thing with large roast cuts like lamb and pork. Don't try to pressure steam vegetables. Steaming is fast anyway, and by the time your cooker gets up to pressure / depressurises you will have made baby food, not crisp steamed broccoli.

I cooked a batch of rice on Monday that I just finished off tonight.  Do not follow the booklet you used.  Sorry, it's not a very good recipe for brown rice.   I have a Presto 4qt and 6qt stainless steel pressure cookers that I use so often that I leave them on my stove, and I don't even use 4 or 6 qt. regular pots anymore at all.\n\nDescription:\n\nIgnore and reject the brochure's use of pot-in-pot cooking for brown rice.  In this case, it merely slows down the whole process and doesn't save cleaning time at all, since it only takes a matter of seconds to rinse out the pressure cooker after the rice is done and removed for serving.   Using a separate bowl will require you to clean the pressure cooker AND the bowl.  You'll always need to clean whatever holds the rice because it's a starch, and the starch will stick to the container and then dry hard like glue if you don't rinse it right away.\n\nThere is NO fixed amount of water to rice that's always right or perfect.  Rice will absorb a rather wide range of moisture, which gives you a range of textures that you may choose based on your personal preferences.   You may using anything from a 1:1 ratio to a 1:2.5 ratio of rice to water.   The lower ratio will result in a much firmer rice texture and individual grains.  As you increase the ratio of liquid, the rice gets softer and somewhat stickier, until it becomes more fully saturated and can't absorb any more, creating a rice pudding, congee/porridge, or soup, and there's nothing wrong with any amount of water and texture you wish.  A thick soupy congee with brown rice is delicious, and so is a firm rice with very little moisture.\n\nSo here is an ultra simple recipe for brown rice to use instead, which you can try first and then alter later to fit your preferences.\n\nSimple Brown Rice recipe:\n\nMeasure 2 cups of dry brown rice.  Briefly rinse off the rice with cold water and then drain.  (many ways to do this, like using a fine mesh strainer, rice washer, etc.)   You don't need to rinse it 20 times.  Just once is ok at first.  Later on, you can rinse it a bit more if you want to remove slightly more surface starch, but we're just keeping it simple.   Add 3 cups of cold (preferably filtered) water to the 2 cups of rice.   Season the water:  I suggest 1 tablespoon of Knorr chicken or vegetable bouillon powder/granules. (1 teaspoon per cup of liquid).  Other brands like Better Than Bouillon are fine too, just follow the ratio of seasoning per cup of water described on the package.\n\nPut the heat on high and stir occasionally until it starts coming up to a boil.  Put on the pressure cooker lid and wait until the pressure regulator weight starts to float, rotate, and slightly rock and then immediately turn down the heat to just barely keep it floating.\n\nStart a timer for 18 minutes.  Turn off the heat entirely when the alarm goes off.\n\nDepressurize options:\n\nAt this point, you have 3 options to depressurize:  very fast, fast, and slow.\n\nVery fast method:  carefully transfer the hot pressure cooker into the kitchen sink with pot holders or towels.   Run cold water over the lid, sides and bottom of the pot.  You can use a sprayer with a light stream of water if you have one to evenly cool the pot.\n\nThe lid lock will fall and release the lid, and the black plastic safety plug will fall when it's depressurized.   This will only take about 15-30 seconds.  Remove the lid, being aware that there will still be some hot steam and condensation on the bottom of the lid when you open it.\n\nFast method:  Use a long handled spoon or utensil to lightly tip the pressure regulator weight to start releasing steam, and only steam, not foam or food.  Clear water is ok.  If a little froth comes out, stop releasing steam and then count to 10 to let it settle, then proceed to release steam.   Once all the steam is released, the lid lock has fallen, and the black safety plug has fallen, you may carefully remove the lid.  Avoid the steam and condensation as you remove the lid.\n\nSlow method:  Just wait about 5-10 minutes until the lid lock falls and the black safety plug falls.\n\nDon't stir the rice with a spoon if you want fluffier rice.  Use a fork or rice paddle to lightly fluff the rice to cool it down a bit at a time until it's all fluffy.   If you used a lot of water and you're making a congee/porridge, it's fine to stir the rice to get the thickness you like.  Stirring it releases more starch by breaking up some of the rice grains.\n\nServe the rice or remove it to storage containers.  Immediately rinse the bot with tap water to save you a lot of hassle if you let it dry.\n\nEnjoy!", "You can do rice in as much water as you want.  All rice except those that rely on starch for their appeal, ie Arborio or sushi, can be done like pasta.  Cook it long enough then drain it.  Generally I do white rice ten minutes, brown 15, long grain 25.  Let the cooker cool naturally.\n\nBowl in bowl is only needed for small quantities, where the portion on the very bottom that may overcook represents like half of what you\u2019re making."]}

Many kinds of soup can be made literally in minutes using a combination of shelf-stable dry ingredients, canned/jarred ingredients, mixed with some fresh and/or frozen ingredients that cook in minutes.\n\nTherefore, cooking the soup ahead of time, well in advance of when you plan to eat the soup, doesn't really save you any time or effort compared to reheating old soup.\n\nIf it took a lot of time and effort to make the soup, then sure, preparing it in advance in a larger batch could save you time.   But most soups don't take a lot of time and effort, especially with a pressure cooker.   Only ingredients like tough stewing meats or dry beans require a longer cooking time to tenderize them.\n\nFor example, a basic vegetable soup can be something like 3 cups of water plus 1 tablespoon of bouillon powder/granules, or 1 tablespoon of Better than Bouillon soup base paste or other preserved soup base.   You can add many kinds of diced, sliced, or chopped vegetables, frozen, fresh, or canned, to the soup base and they will cook in 3-5 minutes at pressure.  Diced potatoes, white rice or barley could also be added for flavor and thickening and they'll cook in the same amount of time.   You can also use a dried soup seasoning mix like Vegeta, which is a great value for the flavor it gives.\n\nThe cooking time of soups will depend on the ingredient you use."]}

Are you reducing the heat after hitting full pressure?\n\nIt sounds like you could be making many mistakes like using too large of a pressure cooker, cooking them for too long, not reducing the heat at the right time, and letting too much steam be released.\n\nSoaked soy beans (the beige ones) only take 5-8 minutes to cook at 15psi full pressure on a stovetop pressure cooker.  But many smoothtop electric cooktops are very slow at heating up large pots of liquid and may take much longer than 8 minutes to get to full pressure, especially if there's any excessive steam leaking from it.\n\nAlso, after the soybeans are soaked, it's important to drain and rinse them well to get rid of the excess starch and sugars in that liquid.\n\nThe foaming is caused when the cooking liquid is allowed to rapidly boil for too long, with the starches thickening.   You can avoid this many ways:  use a much smaller pressure cooker, like 4qts, to cook in smaller batches.  Since they only take less than 8 minutes to cook, you aren't really saving time by doing large batches.\n\nThe smaller size can come up to pressure much more quickly, particularly if you start with boiling water that you've pre-heated in a rapid-boil kettle.  You should be able to get up to full pressure in just a couple of minutes.   That lets you get to full pressure before a lot of starch, proteins, and sugars are released into the liquid, thus eliminating foaming.  Then you must reduce the heat to just maintain full pressure, which also reduces the agitation of the boiling liquid that also causes foaming.\n\nThe best way to release the pressure is to carefully take the smaller pressure cooker to the sink with cold water already in it, and pour or spray cold water over the lid.  This also prevents foaming by letting the water absorb the heat to remove the pressure, without causing the liquid inside to boil and foam.  This only takes about a minute to fully relieve the pressure.\n\nBut if you don't feel safe moving the hot pressure cooker to the sink, then just turn off the heat and let it do a natural release on the stove for about 10 minutes.", "Have you tried a [wooden spoon](https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/why-does-wooden-spoon-stop-pasta-from-boiling-over-0151541/)?"]}

So while you can still use an excessively large pressure cooker to make small amounts of rice and other recipes, it doesn't make a lot of sense to do this on a regular basis.\n\nThat's why I have a wide range of pressure cooker sizes, including 1.5L, 3L, 4qt, and 6qt.  I pressure cook rice more than any other kind of food, at least several times a week.  Some of my favorite recipes are improved versions of Cajun dirty rice, various kinds of rice pilaf or rice-a-roni, which take less than 10 minutes to make, start to finish including clean up, in a smaller pressure cooker.\n\nOne Cajun secret is to use parboiled (converted) rice, which doesn't need to be rinsed or soaked at all, and gives a better texture after pressure cooking and fluffing.  Walmart Great Value parboiled rice is only about $1.50 for 2 pounds to make these recipes from scratch.\n\nSimply saute the rice in a little oil and butter to toast it lightly brown, then add spices to bring out their flavor with diced/sliced/chopped onion, green/red bell pepper, and celery, aka the Holy Trinity.  Last, you can add green onion, shallots, parsley, and garlic (aka the Pope).  Once all is lightly browned, then you add the water and bring up to pressure.  For parboiled rice, a ratio water to rice of about 2:1.   The seasoning can be Tony Chechere's (lite, low salt, or salt free), Slap Ya Mama, or similar.  Lower salt versions let you control the salt better, especially if you want it spicier/hotter without getting saltier.\n\nThe Holy Trinity is the spicy Cajun version of French mirepoix or Latin sofrito, sofregit, soffritto, or refogado (Spanish, Italian, etc.).  Similar ingredients are used for [pilaf/pilau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf) in many regions of the world.\n\nIt's rice + flavor.  Light sauteing of the rice and ingredients boost the flavor, color, and texture with very little effort and time, only a minute or two.  Dirty rice adds ground beef or other meat that's browned too.  [Jambalaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambalaya) adds other meats like sliced sausage, chicken, bacon, shrimp, etc.", "[deleted]", "So we are a just a couple. I often make two cups of rice, portion and freeze it. So easy to grab a serving from the freezer  and microwave it. I do the same with pasta.

Diced chicken that's fully thawed can be cooked in as little as 2 minutes to the safe internal temperature of 165deg. F.   It's better to use temperature as the method to determine when the chicken is done.\n\nUsually chicken is removed from heat at about 160deg.F because the temperature tends to continue climbing for a few minutes thereafter.\n\nIt's difficult to directly measure the temperature of chicken when it's locked inside a pressure cooker.   So what we do is estimate the cooking time based on the largest piece of meat in the pot, and stop cooking when we expect that piece to be done.   Therefore it's a good idea to dice or chop pieces to similar sizes, so that small pieces don't get overcooked to get the center of the big pieces done.\n\nIn fact, there is NO benefit to pressure cooking diced chicken because it cooks so quickly.  Pressure cooking just gets in the way in this case, and you'll get better results without pressure.\n\nChicken thighs and legs tend to do very well with pressure cooking because they have more internal fat that tolerates overcooking better.   Large white-meat breast pieces tend to get dry and tough during pressure cooking unless they are salted, brined, or marinated before hand to help them absorb more water in advance of the heat.\n\nThis is why nearly all chicken restaurants and fast food places take the extra step of brining or marinating the meat before cooking, especially before pressure cooking or pressure frying.", "A pressure cooker will not come up to pressure with frozen items.

In an old-school pot, you could conceivably brown and pressure cook at the same time, but the electronic ones will refuse, in order to prevent burning and overheating problems.\n\n> to adjust my recipe, if a chicken breast comes out less tender than i want, is that a result of too little water, too much water, or just too long a pressure cook?\n\nChicken breast has plenty of water to come out juicy and tender. It dries out because of irreparable damage to the structure of the proteins. The fix is shorter cooking time, brining, or possibly continuing cooking till it starts to fall apart completely; water doesn't have a whole lot to do with it.\n\n> If i wanted to make a Bolognese sauce , would i want to pressure cook at all?\n\nLike a traditional ragu Bolognese? It would benefit from pressure cooking (during the slow-browning step) as far as time goes, but digital pressure cookers would get angry about the lack of water. Mine refuses to saut\u00e9 at pressure, and refuses to pressure cook at high temperature. An Italian-American style with lots of tomatoes could go either way, but I spent most of my time gently browning the beef and soffrito. I don't personally see a benefit from dirtying my instant pot.\u2014I brown everything, add the tomatoes, bring it up to temp with high heat and lots of stirring. Then when I turn it down to simmer, boiling the water and cooking pasta in it is just about long enough for the sauce.", "Yes, there needs to be ***liquid*** in the pot, not necessarily water. Chicken stock is fine.  Water with bouillon powder or Better Than Bouillon paste is fine too.   Tomato based sauces can be problem for sticking and burning because of the starches and sugars they contain.  Often pressure cooking recipes will put a safer liquid on the bottom that won't thicken, and then tomato stuff is carefully put on top of other stuff to keep it away from the bottom of the pot while it's coming up to pressure.\n\nFor a bolognese sauce, the meats and seasonings can be pressure cooked first to brown them in saute mode and then tenderize them under pressure for 20-40 minutes.  Then tomato ingredients can be added without pressure in a low heat saute mode to reduce the moisture while frequently stirring.  The meat is what normally takes so long to tenderize without pressure, so this is the main benefit of pressure cooking for much less time instead of 3-4 hours.  The time to reduce the moisture to concentrate the flavor still takes time.  Sometimes it's better to transfer to a different pan to do the sauce reduction.\n\nI agree with the others that thighs are better than breast meat.  It's also better to brine or marinate the chicken, and then possibly dice or pound it to tenderize before pressure cooking.  Diced chicken cooks very quickly under pressure, only about 5 minutes.  Larger pieces take more time and can be more unpredictable.\n\nI cook meat and veggies + rice frequently at the same time, but only if the cooking time is similar because the meat is already tender and diced to cook quickly.", "Cook\u2019s Illustrated or maybe America\u2019s Test Kitchen has an amazing cookbook for pressure cookers!

Cooking chicken above 165F is overcooking it.  Pressure cooking thawed boneless chicken of any kind for 5 minutes will usually overcook it way above 165F, probably closer to 240-250F, but this depends on how thick the meat may be.   Thigh meat can usually tolerate that overcooking better than white/breast meat if brined.  The brining helps to trap extra moisture into the protein, and thigh meat has more fat that helps to keep it moist too.\n\nCook boneless thigh meat the least that you can to achieve 165F in the middle, and no more.  If you have to overcook it, then do so for the least amount of time as possible.   This is why poaching, grilling, baking, or sous vide with a meat thermometer is the best so that you can stop applying heat when you reach the right temperature in the middle.   Since you can't easily monitor the meat temp inside of a pressure cooker, then the only answer is to cook it for the shortest time you think necessary then measure the temp afterwards to ensure that it's at least 165F.\n\nI suggest experimenting several times first to estimate the time needed for yourself for the size of the thighs you have.

It's important in air frying to not block the air flow by stacking the food.  The best air fryers have the most horizontal cooking surface.

Similar regular pots are about the same price or more.\n\nThe advantage of using a smaller pressure cooker for smaller quantities of food is that it requires less water, comes up to boiling and to full pressure much faster, and depressurizes much faster.  It's also smaller and lighter to use the fastest method of depressurizing: cold water release.   I just take it to the sink and use the sink sprayer to absorb the heat in a matter of seconds, not minutes.\n\nThe cold water release method also helps to cool the food quickly to a more reasonable serving temperature.  I don't have to wait a long time for the food to cool down from 212F to somewhere around 130F by using the water in the sink as a water bath.   There is no faster way to depressurize and cool down the food than using cool water to absorb it.\n\nI can peel and roughly dice some raw potato in a minute or two, and then have perfectly cooked and seasoned mashed potatoes from scratch in less than 10 minutes total.   That's impossible to do this quickly with larger pressure cookers, especially electric pressure cookers.   I'm usually eating the mash well before many electric pressure cookers have got to full pressure.\n\nSame goes for long grain white rice, only 6 minutes of cooking at pressure, but the time to get to pressure and cold water release it can be done much more quickly than a larger pressure cooker.\n\nI can save even more time by bringing water to a boil while I'm prepping the food.  I have a powerful rapid boil water kettle with auto-shutoff.   That way I have boiling water ready to add to the pot to get up to full pressure in a fraction of the time.  I can also thaw or preheat food in the microwave before pressure cooking.\n\nI have an inverter microwave that's much better for thawing frozen meat without cooking it than older microwaves.  Then I can brown it in the pressure cooker for more flavor and saute veggies before pressure cooking stews, pot roast, pulled pork, Cajun dirty rice, gumbo, jambalaya, etc.   Full flavor for a fraction of the time.\n\nI can always haul out my larger pressure cookers for larger groups.  I can feed more people than I can fit in my home in 30-45 minutes.  Diced potato takes only 5-6 minutes to cook whether I make 1 pint or 1 gallon, so the only difference is the time to get to pressure and depressurize.\n\nI use my 6 qt Instant Pot to regularly make a gallon of yogurt for about $4, so I do put the bigger ones to use too.  It's better for making pulled pork from a large picnic roast (that I get for about $1/lbs).  Bulky food like pork short ribs need the larger cooker.", "If it's just one or two people then the 6.5L is too big.  I have a 7L Kuhn Rikon.  It takes a long time to come up to pressure.  By the time it's at pressure I might as well have just been simmering in a normal pot.  The big size makes sense only for large quantities of food.\n\nMuch better to have a smaller P.C. that will heat up and pressurize much faster.  I wish I knew that when I bought my big thing."]}

If someone gave me your product as a gift, I would try to return it, and failing that, I'd donate it to Good Will or similar charity.  I'd refuse to have something like that taking up countertop or shelf space.  And I love useful kitchen gadgets and appliances, when they help in some substantial way that I frequently use.  Your product would be a waste of space to provide a solution to a problem that doesn't exist for me, and merely would cause good spices to go bad sooner.\n\nThe best quality of spices are left in their whole form and protected from air due to oxidation and humidity, which degrades them.  Grinding the spices into a powdered form greatly accelerates the degradation process.  Most people who buy a lot of spices know this.  Apparently, your whole team doesn't know this or you've dismissed it.  \n\nI have no idea why nobody has told you this.  Have you ever been to restaurant where they offer to grind some fresh pepper on your salad or pasta?  The table may have salt and pepper shakers on it.  Why would they do this?  Is it merely a matter of performance art?  No.  No it is not.  It's because freshly ground pepper tastes better and smells better.  This is the case for most spices.  \n\nPeople who buy expensive, quality spices also usually have spice grinders and [mortar&pestle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_and_pestle), technologies that go back to the stone age.\n\nYour product is trying to solve a problem that doesn't really exist while introducing new problems.  I buy spices that I use frequently in much larger quantities than your little machine could hold.  I buy whole peppercorns by the pound and my pepper mill holds a lot more than your machine could hold, and I don't buy ground pepper at all.  \n\nHere's my the one I use: [Cole-Mason Derwent Pepper Grinder](https://www.amazon.com/COLE-MASON-Derwent-Pepper-Grinder/dp/B003OICYZO)\n\nI do buy some spice mixes that are already ground, but I use them in such high quantities that they don't have much time to oxidize or go bad.  Example of these spice mixes are Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning in low salt or salt free versions,  Slap Ya Mama Cajun Seasoning, and Old Bay Seasoning.  These are frequently sold in 5-8oz. shaker bottles.  I've never had any problem with measuring out these mixes.  They have rotating lids that you can select for measuring spoon quantities and pouring, as well as shaker holes, and then rotated to closed to protect from air.\n\nFor all my spices, it takes only a matter of seconds to pull one from the rack and use it, then put it back in it's sealed container.  Putting any machine in the middle of this process isn't needed or wanted unless I were a multi-billionaire to invent an AI+robot that could do what I already do better than I can.\n\nSorry, but your little survey was also useless for providing feedback.

It's a lot easier to brine the pieces in smaller containers or ziplock bags than a whole chicken.  Brining is the single most important thing you can do to end up with moist and flavorful meat with better texture after pressure cooking, especially for white breast meat.  A simple brine is 1 tablespoon of Kosher salt and sugar per cup of water.  2 teaspoons of table salt is about the same as 1 tablespoon of Kosher salt, and it's better to use non-iodized salt.  Brining is a good chance to add some seasoning and herb flavors at the same time.\n\nPressure cooking isn't so good for chicken skin, making it rubbery and tough.  Might as well remove it at the same time, unless you plan to roast the chicken afterwards.  The skin can be fried or baked to make crispy cracklings and to recover that liquid gold fat (schmaltz) for cooking.\n\nThe back, wing tips, and other cuttings can be frozen and saved for making chicken stock or bone broth.\n\nStrangely enough, sometimes leg quarters can be cheaper than whole birds with more usable meat per pound, and they fit better in a pressure cooker.\n\nOf course you can pressure cook a whole bird if it fits, but don't be surprised if the breast meat is drier than you expect unless brined, salted, and seasoned in advance for at least several hours.  It will look rather unappetizing unless you use some type of seasoning to give it color like paprika, red pepper, black pepper, and herbs.  Seasoning the outside will do little to flavor the meat deeply like brining does.  A poultry syringe can be use to inject brine and seasoning into the meat for better flavor and texture.", "If you are making stock or broth, don't go over the max line. It's very simple, actually.

The internal pressure is directly related to the temperature.

Because the oatmeal starts to cook immediately once you pour in the boiling water.  The pressure cooker is merely being used to maintain and increase the cooking temperature, which it does in the time coming up to pressure, in the 1 minute cook time, and whatever time is left on the first timer.\n\nYou'll usually have oatmeal that's ready to eat in 15 minutes or less total time this way, with no extra unnecessary waiting time.", "No steam will come out when you let the Foodi \"naturally release.\" What you should notice is the steam spray is weaker when you open the vent than when you \"quick release\" and open the vent right when it switches to warm mode."]}

There may be a slight amount of burned food at the bottom of your pot, but not enough to ruin whatever you're cooking. Instead of continuing on with this warning, your Instant Pot will actually stop the cooking process to prevent further burning.\r  \n\r  \nThere are a number of reasons your Instant Pot will display its burn message. Most of these involve mishaps that may occur during the cooking process, like not adding enough liquid or forgetting to adjust the steam valve to the sealing position. Once you figure out what you've done wrong, correcting the error is easy. Here's what may be triggering the burn notice and the precautions you can take to prevent it.\r  \n\r  \n1. Your steam valve isn't sealed\r  \nA pressure cooker can't pressure cook without steam. And while there are plenty of recipes that require the valve set at vent, your pressure cooking process is at risk if there isn't enough, well, pressure. Additionally, the steam valve can help prevent the liquid inside from evaporating and drying whatever you're cooking out. Always be sure to adjust the pressure valve to the appropriate setting before you start cooking.\r  \n\r  \n2. There isn't enough liquid\r  \nA closed valve isn't the only thing you need for pressure cooking. You'll also need an adequate amount of liquid (at least one cup) for the pot to actually reach the required pressure, creating the perfect environment for a burn warning. This can also happen if the liquid inside your pot is too thick.\r  \n\r  \n3. You added ingredients at the wrong time or in the wrong order\r  \nHave you ever wondered why Instant Pot recipes start with liquid ingredients first? The less starchy an ingredient is, the less likely it is to stick to the pot and burn. Don't add starchy ingredients until the recipe tells you to, and don't stir them unless it's instructed. Additionally, ingredients like dairy and cornstarch will thicken up your food (and make it vulnerable to burning), so it's best not to add them until after the pressure cooking is finished.\r  \n\r  \n4. Something's up with your Instant Pot\r  \nPressure cookers can be picky, and if one thing is off, your food is at risk. Some of the most common culprits include using a damaged or dirty sealing ring, not closing the lid all the way, and a dirty Instant Pot. If there are food debris in your Instant Pot, they can compromise the pressure by blocking a part, such as the float valve, or simply burn up along the inner pot's underside.  \n\n\nhttps://www.allrecipes.com/article/instant-pot-burn/\n\nhttps://kristineskitchenblog.com/instant-pot-burn/#:\\~:text=The%20burn%20warning%20is%20a,the%20cooking%20process%20has%20stopped.", "&#x200B;\n\npressure cookers work by increasing the temperature to increase pressure\n\nat max pressure, the temp inside is higher than boiling water.

You could be a bit more specific about why you want a small model, what you intend to use it for, or how small is too small and how big is too big.\n\nThe best general answer I can give is to get the smallest one that can do the job.  Using the smallest pressure cooker needed for the job takes much less time to build and release pressure, and therefore faster cooking because more cooking time occurs at max pressure.   Smaller pressure cookers also require less water, but are also at greater risk of overfilling, depending on the lid design.\n\nSome lids are high and deep, with a lot of extra air space above the pot to allow for some foaming without clogging the valve.  These models allow for a higher fill line inside the pot, if you're careful and know what you're doing.  These all have a lid that rises at least an inch above the pot rim.\n\nOther lids are short and shallow with very little space for overflow.  These require a much lower max fill line to leave space for some foaming to avoid clogging the valve with food.\n\nI think stainless steel layered with a heat spreading aluminum core are more durable and versatile than aluminum or anodized models.  Some models have spring valves with 2 pressure settings, others have a floating weight valve.", "I've had a larger version of this for over 15 years. \\*Never\\* a problem with it, I've always felt very safe using it and it's a real workhorse.
