I did culinary in high school, then two years at community college starting at 15 (I was lucky enough to have some strings pulled), and my first apprenticeship was a year in to the program.\n\n\nFor being a chef to pay well, you need to own your own place and have a mix of luck, ability, and a strong network. Figure mid-20s is when having your own place is a legitimate possibility if you are in the kitchen by 16, unless you ha e rich family.\n\n\n\nIt's ridiculously fun being a cook, or a chef. It's a hard life though, and the industry is filled with interesting characters, some ex-felons, some drug users, some alcoholics. If you are accepting and chill, you will always have a good brigade. That doesn't mean allowing low standards of conduct or quality in the kitchen.\n\n\n\nEducation wise, save your dollars, get good grades, and try to get a scholarship to a well known culinary program which you can leverage into an apprenticeship out of the country, or in a Michelin starred kitchen. Friend of mine did 3 years under Thomas Keller and she's not just amazing, but people see that name on her resum\u00e9 and shes hired. To get high in the industry, expect both a culinary education and apprenticeships.\n\n\n\nSomething I'd suggest is getting one of the mid 70s editions of Jacques pepin's book, la tecnique. Work your way through it. Ignore the current editions, they're not as good. As soon as you can, get a job as a dishwasher and work hard. Learn Spanish to a native fluency. Spend your time cooking. Learn what you like, pastry? Butchering? Sauces? Meats? Salads? Get very good at drawing, and math. Become diligent about writing down ideas. Try new foods, and do away with the saying, \"I don't eat that.\" Walk into a nice restaurant right when they open and ask to talk to the front of the house manager. Tell them you are trying to find out if you want to become a chef and ask them if they can help you schedule an interview with the executive chef or chef de cuisine if it's a place that has both.

Your first sous position will be long hours doing the executive chef's job for little pay. Even your first exec job won't pay you as much as you think. \n\nCulinary school helps, but if you're not a good natural cook/manager, you'll struggle. A formal education won't fix either of those things. \n\nIt's worth it to me because it's my only real practical skill and a lot of things the job requires have always come natural to me.

Like teaching, you do it because its your passion. Passion can fade away if you burn it too hot. This industry isn't for everyone. I believe some people are not built to handle the environment. It's brutal at times. Its a blast most times. It's miserable and tiring, physical amd mental exhaustion are common and down right expected. Its got high highs and low lows. For much of your career it will be thankless. In truth you'll only know if it worth it by starting some kitchen job someplace ( try to make it a scratch kitchen) then see if you are someone who can handle the long, hot, manic hours. The reward is only what you take from it. Not money, not fame, not gratitude. You be a chef for you and no one else. Just my 2 cents after 20+ years in this industry. ", "I was a chef with my own restaurant a catering business and a couple of food trucks. I made more money buying and selling the food trucks than I ever did being a chef. Cooking professionally eventually stole my passion for cooking as the amount of work and stress just wasn't worth it. \n\nA restaurant is more than a full time job, it's a way of life and you never get to rest. It's hot, there's constantly pressure and the margins a restaurant has to work within to be profitable are frustrating. Getting help is harder than ever and when it came down to it my \"hourly pay\" ( which as an owner can vary depending on a million different variables ) wasn't really very good. 80 hour weeks are the norm. \n\nAfter 28 years in the business I went to barber school and completely reinvented myself. I own a great little shop and make an excellent living with very little stress and more money with a 30 hour work week than I ever made working 80 hours. Just my story...if you're passionate then go for it. Many close friends of mine live their lives as chefs and embrace the lifestyle. Do what makes you happy my friend! I wish you luck!!", "First is first. Get a restaurant job. I worked my way up the ranks (starting at a taco bell) now I'm cooking $50+ dishes at multiple different restaurants. Only put in a year at each place (after one year it becomes completely repetitious and you stop growing) I learn more at every new place. I've worked Mexican, Chinese, American, and now I'm doing Italian. You just learn as you go. \n\nBut, you have to experience it for a few months to learn if you really WANT it. It's an extremely harsh environment, the pay is terrible for the amount of effort, and it destroys any social life you want to have. \n\nImagine this. Working every weekend from lunch to midnight. 5-6 days a week, more than 50 hours a week. Walking more than 10 miles a day with only 2 maybe 3 smoke breaks. Coming home to sleep for 4 hours and doing it all over again. \n\n\nI've worked with people who have started their own business. And it can actually grow to nearly 100 hours a week in the kitchen to get it off the ground, just to barely break even.\n\nBeing a cook is ruthless. It can chew you up and spit you right out. But if you get it, if you enjoy the rush and adrenaline of cooking 20 plates (more than $1000 of food) in less than 10 mins, perfectly. It is actually rewarding. \n\nI do not want to stay a cook forever. Cause I want a family. I want to go on campouts, I want to see them play baseball or football. I wanna go out on a Friday for date night. I want to come home and not be so exhausted I cant even take my socks off before falling asleep...\n\nBut I'm really good at it. And I've learned and grown so much. My life has changed with flavors and experiences I'll never forget. I have no idea what kind of worker youd be. But remember, its harsh, and it takes a lot of sacrifices to be a successful  chef. \n", "You\u2019re young and you have plenty of time to experiment with this. When you\u2019re old enough to, get a job at a restaurant for after school or weekends - it will give you a taste of what cooks/chefs do every day and what they deal with. You\u2019ll probably start out as a dishwasher depending on how nice the place is, but being a dishwasher at a nice restaurant will Net you more observations into your \u201cfuture\u201d than being a line cook at Applebee\u2019s.\n\nYou CAN make money as a chef, but not doing the fun stuff. I worked for Marriott for about a decade and they pay well, being corporate, but the focus is on numbers and making money, not making good food. Some people are okay with that life but it killed my spirit.\n\nRestaurants though, especially nice ones, do not pay as well and are more demanding - but the work you do is more interesting. However, due to the workload burn out is more likely to come on faster and harder. It is possible to find a good restaurant group that pays decently and doesn\u2019t work you to death, but the restaurant business runs on very thin margins so there isn\u2019t a lot of wealth to spread around (and what there is will mostly return to the owners and or investors).\n\nThere are lots of alternatives to the traditional career path though - there\u2019s research and development, recipe testing, Private or personal cheffing, etc etc. anything scientific will require schooling but not so much culinary school as good science (so be cognizant of that if that\u2019s the way you think you might want to go).\n\nThe nicer culinary schools are so expensive that they will financially cripple you for years. I went to the CIA and my minimum student loan payments every month are a little over a thousand dollars - almost as much as my rent. I cannot save money at all due to this and it sucks. This is my life for 25 years. So hopefully they\u2019ll be paid off when I\u2019m fifty. I wish I had not gone to that school because while it was a fantastic school and the teachers were great and I learned so fucking much... I had no hope of making a salary that would allow me to pay the money back unless it was a soul crushing corporate job. \n\nThe cheaper culinary schools provide a rudimentary education which CAN be helpful - learning the basics gives you room to grow and experiment with more wisdom rather than just trying random stuff because you don\u2019t know how anything works. However, for a much much cheaper option, you can buy culinary books and research stuff online for self study while working in a restaurant under a more experienced chef.\n\nNow, chefs will say they will nurture you and teach you: they mostly really mean this. But chefs are busy and their time is limited so you cannot count on significant one-on-one time. They\u2019re very unlikely to personally mentor you, even if they want to. Every chef everywhere is usually running around like crazy trying to accomplish as much as possible in a day, and it will be hard to get them to slow down for you. Don\u2019t take it personally or be disheartened, but be realistic - a lot of people will advise you to \u201clearn by working in a restaurant\u201d but this will only teach you the things that the restaurant makes. It\u2019s not going to teach you about the core of cooking - about why or how emulsifiers work, or thickeners, or why deglazing works. Knowing this stuff allows you to create your own recipes rather than just making the things you\u2019ve been taught to make. I recommend at least self study to learn the science behind cooking so you can think critically on your own and make recipes and dishes you\u2019ve never seen make - but are relatively sure will work because you know how the science of cooking works. \n\nLastly: the work is hard and demanding and you don\u2019t get paid nearly enough to deal with the bullshit you\u2019ll encounter. Customers are irritating and the industry tends to attract volatile personalities. It\u2019s common for line cooks etc to go at each other hard or just be generally pissy and bitter. They\u2019ll also be the weirdest and most fun people you\u2019ve ever met, but when the stress is on everyone\u2019s tense and it shows, and lots of people get snappy and unpleasant in those circumstances. So while you\u2019re working as a teen in a restaurant - take a look around and just ask yourself if this is an environment you want to spend the majority of your time in for the rest of your life.\n\nLastly, some hard truths about the chef life that no one really thinks about when they join this career, or think it won\u2019t happen to them:\n\n- burn out. It\u2019s physically AND mentally AND emotionally demanding work. You will feel tired and old at 40, and at 60 you\u2019ll probably be teetering near death unless you find a nice cozy corporate job to slide into.\n\n- personal social time is nonexistent. Have a family? You\u2019ll barely see them. You will work mostly nights (in a restaurant), and you\u2019ll be asleep when your kids get up to eat breakfast and go to school. You will work weekends. Have friends who work a typical Monday to Friday job? You will never see them either. They\u2019re off on the weekend or want to go out Friday and Saturday - every restaurants busiest days. If you\u2019re lucky you will have friends in the industry and you\u2019ll get to go out on Monday or Tuesday, if you\u2019re not so tired you\u2019d rather just sleep until you have to go back in Wednesday morning.\n\n- say goodbye to cooking for yourself at home, the thing you enjoy so much right now that you\u2019re considering cooking as a career. You will likely almost never cook for yourself, because you will work 12-18 hours a day and won\u2019t want to do anything but sleep when you get home. If you take a poll of professional restaurant chefs and ask them what they eat, I\u2019ll bet a dollar every time that they say fast food or heat-and-eat meals. That will be your life too. All your cooking brilliance will feed others, rarely you. If you love making and eating your own food, you will lose that when you enter the industry due to lack of time and exhaustion. Every one thinks they will be the exception to this rule and I have yet to meet one chef who is. So think hard on that too.\n\n- you will very likely need to career switch because you will not make it all the way to retirement age, which will probably be like 75 by the time you get there, with the way it\u2019s trending. So think now about what you\u2019d switch to and how and whether that\u2019s something you\u2019re interesting in also. Lots of chefs who burn out go into stuff like IT, since the certifications are simple to get and the pay is high for much less stress and time. But they don\u2019t live doing IT - they just can\u2019t handle being a chef anymore. So they spent the first half of their life chasing a passion at the expense of time and energy and most likely physical health... and they\u2019ll spend the last half doing work that doesn\u2019t fulfill them but gives them some free time and money. Just think a while about whether that is the kind of quality of life you want.\n\nNow for a nice truth:\n\nLife is long and you don\u2019t have to be a chef forever just because you decided to pursue that at 18. If you are a passionate chef through your 20s but find a new passion and career in your 30s, that\u2019s fine. Find a new passion every decade, why not? There\u2019s no reason to treat this as a life sentence. Explore it for a few years and if it\u2019s not for you, who says you can\u2019t start medical school at 25? \n\nYour parents come from a time when your career was supposed to last a lifetime. That isn\u2019t the world a lot of us live in anymore and there\u2019s no shame in changing your mind at any point. You\u2019re not required to be passionate about something for 70 years or else it\u2019s invalid. 5 years of passion is fine - you will learn and grow the entire way. It\u2019s not time wasted, it\u2019s time invested - in yourself. You will have many years to find what brings you joy. Don\u2019t fret too hard about this. ", "In my opinion, you can learn valuable experience in the kitchen working professionally. It can be rewarding when young because you can meet great, like minded people, and gain skills that will benefit you your entire life - everyone needs to eat, after all.\n\n\n\nBut, and this is a big but, it's not a good career to go into financially, or if you want a good work/life balance. Kitchens can be little homemade families, but the downside of that is that it's incredibly demanding and everyone else works 60+ hours a week on their feet for a small paycheck. It's good when you're young, because your body doesn't hurt and you're not jaded yet, but it's best if it's a part time job to get through high school and college, and then maybe when you job hunt after college. \n\n\n\n\nI have never worked with a chef or cook who hasn't thought of getting out of the kitchen or actually gotten out, though. I started when I was 15, and I will be 32 this year - I am actively trying to get out by taking programming classes. I don't regret getting into culinary, but I definitely regret staying in it so long. ", "One thing I would really emphasize is that the career you choose at 18 doesn't have to be the career you have at 28.\n\nI cooked for 3 years, from 18 to 21, and I think it was the best possible job I could've had at that stage in my life.\n\nI learned how to really do stuff with a checklist method. Every shift there is a list of stuff to get done before service, and/or a list of things to get done before you get to close the restaurant. During service itself, each ticket is a mini-checklist. Managing the flow of those tasks with visual and written representation of tickets going to a particular metal ticket rack, checking off items that are already done, combining tasks when practical, and having the satisfaction of stabbing a finished ticket onto a little spike was all part of it.\n\nI also learned how to set up my workstation and how important it was to make sure everything was ready to go for service, from ingredients to tools to just the organizational flow of which task is represented by which bin. It's commonly called mise en place, and it's really important for pretty much any job. You know your station, and you learn to appreciate the timing of when it's time to replenish ingredients without letting tickets pile up, etc.\n\nI've taken both of these lessons elsewhere to other careers - a soldier the army, a brief computer networking/sysadmin career, and my current career as a lawyer. Even now, when I prepare for an argument in court, I make sure to bring a folder with my cases and my arguments clearly organized and easily accessible so that I can be ready for \"service.\"\n\nSo yeah. For me, it was worth becoming a cook, even if just for 3 years. I learned how to really cook, a skill I still use (which is part of how I caught the attention of my future wife), and I learned how to really work on a team and within a system. It's a great job to have, even if long term the long/irregular hours and low pay really start to wear on anyone over the age of 30.", "God no, not for the money alone. It\u2019s a career where you have to have a lot of passion because it\u2019s quite unforgiving.

I've thought about it and always come back to what I say above.  I like making a good meal, but the joy would quickly fade away if I had to make that same good meal day in, day out.

Cooking just felt good. It was stressful and challenging, but in all the right ways. \n\nIn short, FS is super fun! I love both pastry and culinary, but pastry is my preferred. It's got more science & art to it. Though it is fun, don't think it's easy. It can be, but it will be challenging. FS takes a lot out of a person sometimes. \n\nI just finished my Associate degree in Pastry, working on a Bachelor in Food Service Management. FS is definently not an industry you NEED a degree in, but it can help. Attending Johnson & Wales, I have many friends who also attend the CIA or elsewhere. \n\nI believe anyone who has gone to school will give you a response as to how they experienced school, but it's really what you make it. You have to work hard to keep connections with chefs and continuously ask questions and try to learn more than what they offer. School is great if you KNOW you want to be in this industry, or you have a bunch of $$$. \n\nMaking money will depend on you; where you are and how hard you're willing to work. Different locations are going to pay different based on the standard of living in that location. $15/hr in Charleson, SC is NOT going to be the same in NYC, NY. You get me? Not all kitchen jobs pay well. Ones that do will likely be more stressful, ones that don't could be sh*t or not be challenging enough. \nLots of FS workers have more than one job. ", "If you're worried about money, then no it is definitely not worth it. That being said, if you can manage to work in high end and creative kitchen, it can be very fun and rewarding. As far as realistic paths to a career for creative types, I think being a chef is one of the safer options.\n\nBut honestly, the American restaurant industry is so fucked, there are so many issues. Your work will not be valued as much as you think it's worth. You will watch the front of the house staff take home twice as much money as you for working less hours. If you enter a salaried position, your hourly pay will actually go down and you'll just end up working way more hours. Depending on how frugal you are and how expensive your city is, you might end up needing multiple jobs just to make ends meet and still have money left over for fun and savings. If you want any sort of work-life balance you will have to fight for it, and doing so will most likely slow your career.\n\nI ended up cooking at the place I'm at now after looking for marketing work (I have a degree) and not finding anything and getting desperate. I've worked a lot of food service since high school (26 now) but I'd always felt like ending up in food service would be a failure. But at this place I saw cooking like I'd never seen before and I get to work with the best cook I've ever met. I started as a dishwasher 2 years ago and I'm on my way to sous now. I'm having a ton of fun right now, but I don't expect to be professional cook or chef for the rest of my life, it's just too hard of a job for what you get in return. But I've learned a lot about myself here, and I can say that making things for a living is far more fun than selling things. It just pisses me off that creating generally earns you less money than sales/marketing. You can see that stark difference first hand in a restaurant between the kitchen and the wait staff. The world is not a fair place. ", "Yes and No. \n\nIs it a good job? Not really... long hours spent in the restaurant. Pay is almost non existent especially when comparing your paycheck to hours worked. You need to love it in order to love being a Chef. You will work all holidays so hopefully your girlfriend/boyfriend will understand. Plus you will probably work all weekend so hopefully friends/family/girlsfriends/boyfriends will understand that. You will work 5-7 days a week, pulling probably 12-24+ shifts so no more family parties, no more friend parties, etc. In my case, my other brother was graduating from medical school. He has always been a great older brother to me.. always there for me and whenever I needed something, he would do it. I asked for the weekend off and the restaurant said \"no problem... enjoy!\" A few weeks before I was suppose to leave...we had a big party and guess what.... I was denied my vacation. I was not able to attend his graduation. Your social life will be non existent. \n\nHowever, with that being said...nothing has ever replicated working in a restaurant. The hard but fun hours spent there. The feeling of being in the weeds and knowing what being in the weeds is in other fields. For example...  I am currently a respiratory therapist now. My coworkers wonder why I stay calm all the time regardless of how busy we are and how crazy the hopsital is. Because..deep down.. it still doesnt compare to being in the weeds and staying focused like it does in the restaurant. \n\nAfter ~10 years, I left the food business for multiple reasons. One main reason was money and hours worked. At my last location, I would be in the restaurant 5 days a week on average...sometimes 7. I would work at least 12-20 hours a day. However, on those rare days off... it would be spent on call in case something went wrong or meeting Chefs from our sister locations, meetings...etc. \n\nAnother reason was the drinking. Because of the works I worked, nothing was open when I left besides fast food, bars and alcohol stores. I saved a lot of money by not buying clothes or anything so I spent it with my coworkers at the restaurant. After work friday...we go to the bars to drink. After they closed, we went to the  club that closed at 4am. After they were closed...go home, shower, and go back to the restaurant. If we werent doing that.. I just spent in on weed or tequilla/beer. \n\nInsurance was another reason why I left. There was none or if it was..it was the cheapest thing possible. I didnt want to be one of those people who didnt have a good job with good insurance in case of those \"what if\" moments. Based on the following reasons... I didnt see a safe future for when I wanted a future and to start a family. Most of the Chefs I knew were great at their jobs but either divorced, drunks, or cheaters Or a combo of the three. Plus even with their great skills.. they were either broke or living paycheck to paycheck. I didnt want that. I never wanted to live paycheck to paycheck. \n\nDo I miss working as a Chef? Every single freaking day. I miss it and I loved it. Now that I have a semi secured life with my wife...we know the opportunity to return is always there and I was considering it in the past few months but I am still also happy with were my career is and will be in the next few months. These days... I am happy enough cooking great meals for my wife and coworkers and family. \n\nPlus... I also had a wow moment during my days as a Chef. After ~8 years of never showing up to a family party (I have a big family on my moms side and we are all very close)... I was able to attend a family party. I actually had a day off... I showed up and every acted like I died and returned back to life. Then I got a big hug by three little kids who grabbed my leg like their lives depended on it and I had no idea who they were. These kids were around 4 years old and I have no idea who they were. They were my cousin's kids. A cousin that I thought I was very close with... had two kids that I didnt know anything about and that was when I felt shitty about being a chef. ", "So far most are saying the pay isn't great. What about a specialty, like patisserie chef? Do these jobs pay better?", "My two cents...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow enjoyable being a chef is depends on where you work. There are lots of different styles and cuisines you can choose from. There are honestly so many chef positions available that you don't have to stay somewhere you hate (you could even run your own kitchen). That is the beauty of cooking. There are so many possibilities for creativity. You do not have to be bored.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently working at an Indian restaurant and having a LOT of fun. I'm even learning some punjabi. The people working there are very nice and supportive. At previous places I've worked at they have treated me poorly, which is a problem with the culture in the hospitality industry. People like Gordon Ramsay have propagated a culture where it's okay to abuse others, but it's honestly not okay and if that ever happens to you stand your ground and rely on your worker rights. Don't be a doormat. Grow some balls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow much you earn depends on where you are working and how talented and dedicated you are. The best chefs get a lot of fame and fortune but they work their ass off. If you are an average chef you may get an average wage, so expect around $40K for 40 hours of work. It's certainly liveable but not extravagant. But unless you have other hobbies that you actively spend money on, then you'll amass a good amount of savings over time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings you can do now are to work on your knife skills and mise en place. They are the most important parts of working in a kitchen. You save so much time if you have fast, safe cutting technique, and your employer will recognize this. A sharp knife helps too. Learn how to sharpen knives (all kinds of knives). Mise en place on the other hand is all about preparing and maintaining a level of organization at all times, having everything in its proper place. This also saves you time as your work environment is much more efficient. You can start by organizing your house and keeping it organized all day every day. Don't get lazy, just do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to get a formal education I would recommend an apprenticeship at a small kitchen and work part-time until you have enough confidence and passion to spend longer hours in the kitchen.

Never did I want to be a chef though, that's where you get stuck behind a desk for a lot of the time.    \nI've never had as much of a rush while at work running the line. Second closest was running a bar, which is very similar in practice, the difference being that I made close to 3x the money behind the bar.", "It all really depends man.\n\nLike at your age I would say don't do cooking school, you can get in part time, depending where you live, at a restaurant that does from scratch and as long as its a decent kitchen with a good chef you can learn a lot, especially working prep. People will say school helps but honestly I know so many chefs who really don't give two shits if you went to school or not they are going to look at your experience, and any good kitchen will have you come in for a stage, which you should always ask to do anyways once you get to the point where you seriously want to get into a kitchen, it will give you the opportunity to see the kitchen and how the team works together. You just need to find a decent kitchen. And thats one of the big problems in the industry.\n\nLet me preface by saying I went to school for Baking and Patisserie, and everyone else I know who went to school in the industry has always said that school was good and all, but it's basically just worth it for the basics. You're not going to learn everything you need to know in a kitchen. Like I said at your age its better to develop your skills at home and eventually give a try at getting into a kitchen with a good chef.\n\nThat brings me to my other point, depending on the kitchen you get into, you're either gonna have a good chef and a good crew of people who actually like working there and have the same passion as you, or you're going to have a good chef, but they've been in the industry for forever and are reaching their burnout and are going to be a bit of a pushover when it comes to keeping the kitchen in check and on top of that a so so crew, this is where it kind of sucks, because you LOVE cooking and this is your passion and all of your peers could give two shits and are giving their bare minimum.\n\nOne thing you have to realize in the industry is you will come across a lot of people who work in the kitchen just for a job. They see it as semi-easy money so they aren't going to put there all into it. \n\nYou need to find a space where you're surrounded by people who have the same mindset as you, a chef who is probably going to be a bit of a hard ass but they mean well. With chefs who care there is usually someone of higher power putting a good bit of pressure on them to be perfect, and while its not fair for them to bring their stress into the kitchen, it does happen, and those chefs are going to be hard on you but they are going to push you to strive to be better and push yourself. And you can usually find a chef who is going to teach you well.\n\nIt is fun being in a kitchen, especially when you find the one that works for you, its great to learn and its awesome to get into a flow with your coworkers especially on busy nights, there is always that bit of an adrenaline rush when you get in the weeds and it feels great to push through that and put out great food and know people are enjoying the food you put work into.\n\nThe hours are long, like really long, I averaged anywhere from 10-16 hour shifts everyday depending and you have to realize I wasn't a chef, I was a line and prep/production cook. When you actually become a chef you have to realize you'll probably be averaging 12-16 hours or more and you'll be on salary, you're not getting paid for that overtime bud.\n\nWhich will hit another point of yours, depending on where you work you can make so so money, it depends on where you work, if they are part of a corporation or chain and what style of dining it is. As a chef you'll obviously get paid more than a cook but its also dependent on where you work. You won't be making 6 figures unless you're reaching celebrity status haha. But one thing I've always held strong to for myself at least, is its not really about the money if you are happy with where you are and are enjoying your work. It's a bit different when you're in the industry because you love what your doing and I was lucky I worked for a chef who recognized my hard work and paid me accordingly.\n\nLike I'm not trying to be a downer even if my post seems to read a little negatively, the industry is great and you'll meet great people and amazing chefs who you can tell love food and are super knowledgeable, you'll also meet people who you'd like to throw in a steamer, but it happens. It really comes down to what you want in life man, like I said you're at that age where you can work on your own skills and knowledge at home, and eventually get a part time job at a restaurant. You're young enough to get an idea of what you want for your future in the industry and if it's going to be right for you and what direction you would want to take if you proceed to see yourself working in the food industry for life.\n\nI love cooking and baking and everything food, I just currently am taking a break, my last place I worked just went to complete shit and became overly stressful to where I was starting to get burnout and I have only worked in the industry for 6 years. It's shitty because I know what I love in this industry but the area I live in is a bit on the slow end of being a little progressive when it comes to the food scene. I hope to one day maybe get back into a restaurant but for now im good with enjoying cooking and experimenting at home.\n\nIf theres one thing I can definitely say is if you do get into this industry don't ever stay anywhere out of loyalty if you feel like its bringing you down, don't let the industry kill your passion for food.\n\nI know this has gotten overly long so I'll leave you with some recommendations.\n\nIf you haven't watched them definitely watch Chefs Table and Mind of a Chef on Netflix, they are great, great shows.\n\nI would also recommend reading Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat by Samin Nosrat. They did turn it into a show on Netflix but the book is infinitely better.", "First, being a chef is nothing like cooking at home. I encourage you to keep learning to cook, it's an extremely useful and diverse hobby and skillset. But please understand that the joy you get out of cooking for yourself and family will almost certainly not carry over to being a chef. It's a tough, thankless job, nobody cares enough to be proud of you for doing your job, so you must be proud of your work and be okay with you being the only one. I would agree with your family, choose a different career path unless you are very dedicated to cooking in professional kitchens.\n\n> Is it worth it being a chef?\n\nThat depends primarily on you. It isn't glamorous or high paying. It's hot and often extremely fast paced work that requires very good multitasking, while also requiring an eye for detail. It can be incredibly frustrating and stressful. There are also different types of chefs within a single kitchen, so responsibilities can vary wildly.\n\n>-does being a chef pay well?\n\nThe answer is almost always no. It takes a long time to make decent money in this industry, and a lot burn out well before they make it that far. Some long time chefs make liveable money, but they work long hours at odd times. TV chefs make a lot of money, but you're looking at a handful of people out of hundreds of thousands.\n\n>-is it fun being a chef?\n\nAgain, that depends primarily on you. For one, nobody thanks you or is proud of you for it, it's your job and it's expected of you, you have to do it because you want to. For two, you have to get used to cooking the same things thousands of times, and you must do it quickly, correctly and consistently. The exploratory and experimental cooking is sparse. You get fulfillment from doing 1000 covers a night and not crashing.\n\n>-do i need special education to be a chef?\n\nNot really. If you train in the right places, under the right people, you can learn most everything. You can go to culinary school, and learn some of the basics, but some things can only be learned in a working kitchen, not a learning kitchen.\n\n>-what can i do now to make sure that i become a chef in the future?\n\nStart drinking a lot and doing coke. You'll fit in just fine. Really though, just get a job at a restaurant. You'll probably be stuck as a dishwasher for a while, but eventually, if you are reliable, you will be moved up to some basic prep or something like a breading station. Once you actually start dealing with tickets, if you like what you are doing start shopping around, be ready to start at the bottom and to listen and learn.", "Honestly? I want to say no. I have mental health problems and the industry makes me want to kill myself quite often\n\n* Overworks me, I have to fight to maintain appropriate boundaries. My mental health gets bad if I don't have time to maintain myself. My days are so long that my meds wear off in the middle and it's like Flowers for Algernon every day.

I'd sit in class thinking \"this is interesting, but too narrow for me to do just this for the next 40 years\" (journalism and writing was the one I very nearly fully committed to). But I needed to pay rent, and I knew how to cook, so I got a job first at a campus sportsbar, but come summer when the students were gone, 20 hours a week at $5 wasn't cutting it, so I got a job at a \"real\" restaurant... and I found myself cutting class to pick up shifts and one day realized \"I CAN do this for 40 years\". 30 years later, I'm in a small place, if I get a call off, I have to stay an extra 8 hours and cover the line, and it is annoying but still fun. I like and thrive off the pressure of a line of tickets, each with items of different cooking times and trying to time it all just right and making it just right. At my age, I'm a little more tired and sore than I was when I was younger, but for me, it is fun and not sure what else I really would have done had I not fallen into this.

{"title": "What is different about Kewpie mayo, chemically speaking, that makes it so creamy/spreadable? It can't be just the yolk density.", "selftext": "So for a bit of background as to why I care - I have a soy protein intolerance. I cannot tolerate the soybean oil used in Kewpie - which is problematic for me, primarily because the use cases for Kewpie are more broad and diverse than western mayo. \n\nWhat I mean is, you aren't out of place throwing down a few thin stripes of kewpie over a rice or noodle bowl, whereas trying something like that with American mayo is an exercise in futility. Even if I were to take American mayo and stuff it into a kewpie bottle, it would sputter and spurt and not come out in perfect, thin ribbons the way Kewpie does.\n\nI've tried to make my own mayo, and leaned heavier into the egg yolks (and added MSG of course) in an attempt to mimic what Kewpie is doing, but even doing so, I don't wind up with a texture (or flavor for that matter) conducive to rice bowls and noodle bowls. \n\nThis process is driving me crazy, which is leading me to believe I'm missing some element of what they're doing. Some people have said they use dashi stock in theirs, but that doesn't track with the ingredients labels I've seen.\n\n\nThe other reason I believe there's something chemically different about Kewpie is due to the way it reacts in water - well, more specifically, *broth*. A popular ramen hack involved putting some kewpie in the bowl before adding the broth to turn the broth creamy. Kewpie does this without fail - but if you try it with American mayo it instead sort of \"shreds\" into these little white mayo particles that will not emulsify in no matter what you do.\n\nI thought maybe the broth was scrambling the mayo before it could separate, but even adding it in slowly, and stirring vigorously, it just wouldn't behave. By contrast, I have no such issues emulsifying an egg yolk into broth - so I don't think it's technique here. And Kewpie, of course, just *works* and doesn't scramble at all.

The flavour is extremely unique, like boozy GG paste.\n\nIf you look up fermented garlic ginger paste online you\u2019ll see a video from Brad @ Bon Appetite. Brad is my spirit animal, but don\u2019t follow the video. He adds olive oil to it, which is dangerous. Just use the juices from the garlic and ginger and a 2% salt. Add water if necessary. If you don\u2019t have a fermentation jar like mine, just use an air tight jar and be sure to burp it every few days. \n\nIf fermentation isn\u2019t your thing, cooking it is another option. Bring it to boil in a skillet in its juice and some water. This is a trick many Indians use to make GG paste keep longer. Usually, it\u2019s done in a pasted form, but I\u2019m sure it will work in a chopped form too. You might need to add more water. Personally, I prefer pasted over chopped in all Asian dishes.", "There is a lot of bad advice here. Garlic will *not* taste fresh if younprechop it and store it. It\u2019ll overproduce all\u00edcin and become really pungent after only an hour or so of sitting around. Ginger you can prechop but garlic you can\u2019t. If you don\u2019t believe it just try it.

Larger pieces cook more slowly, might be uneven from edge to centre, and can give contrast within the dish by retaining flavours in small 'pockets'.\n\nFor aliums like onion and garlic, mincing also creates more flavour impact. Some onions/garlicky flavour notes are created enzymatically when the flesh is cut and exposed to oxygen. Because of this, smaller pieces will have a more intense flavour as more surface area is exposed to the air before cooking. Both can be sweetened by cooking but the minced product may have more characteristic onion or garlic notes. \n\nCanned minced onion or garlic often contains acids or oils to help preserve them so they can also have a different flavour altogether.", "With some alliums, like garlic, the intensity of its flavor depends on breaking the cell walls that isolate various chemicals like cysteine sulfoxides & alliin.  When the cell walls are broken, and these chemicals combine, they produce more intense garlic flavor. So that halving a clove creates less of these compounds than mincing or pureeing.\n\nOther than that, how an onion is cut has primarily to do with texture, mouth-feel, and the suitability with the recipe.  I wouldn't puree onions for use in hash browns, but I might if I were incorporating them in mashed potatoes.", "There is no short answer for this , but basically everything changes on the ingredients and cuts and methods of cooking. For instance the onions you ask, if you puree them and put those in a pan it would boil on its own juicies, and if you cut them in pieces and sautee them in oil you could brown them. You should get a book on basic techniques to grasp most basic interactions between different ingredients, methods of cooking and cuts.", "Cell structure of the onions are altered by different cuts. A julienne or slice will have more bite to it and provide more of a texture to a dish. A fine dice or Brunoise will give you a little less texture with a little bite. Grated or pur\u00e9ed will be more like a boiled onion with the cell structure pretty much mush", "I\u2019m not a trained chef but I think I can help in answering this. \n\nThe longer an ingredient cooks, the deeper it\u2019s flavor. Next time you make pomadoro sauce try separating into two pots, and adding the basil early on one, late on the other. You\u2019ll notice the flavor is much brighter the less it\u2019s cooked. Not to say it\u2019s bad to add early, it\u2019s just a different flavor profile.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with onions and garlic. It\u2019s kind of like the first press olive oil (extra virgin) vs last press. If you want flavors to stand out less, cook them less.\n\nThis can translate into cut sizes. If you want to deepen the onion flavor more, and get more caramelized flavor from them, chop them smaller. If you want a fresher onion flavor, cut them larger. If you\u2019re cooking for a long time, like a roast, even large cuts will produce deeper flavors, but not as much as small. \n\nPur\u00e9e is a bit different. Same rules apply, but you have to account for the first extra moisture. Pur\u00e9e onions would be great in meatballs because it adds juiciness. This can easily reduce caramelization however, since the moisture helps stabilize the heat.\n\nAgain, not a pro chef but this is just my experience", "I had to dig out a couple books for such a seemingly simple question, haha, but I wanted to dive into the science of it, so here goes.\n\n>1. How does the grated onion differ from chopped onion when caramelized?\n\nOnions, and all alliums I believe, rely on various sulfates (one of which, you guessed it, is the one that makes you cry) and sugar chains to create flavor molecules. \n\nThe Sulfates vs. Sugars: A Game of Balance\n\nWhen you damage an onion cell oxygen is exposed to an enzyme in the cell's storage and it pops out and starts the chain-reaction that creates a bunch of flavor molecules, how we cook the onion during this time will nudge the reactions in the direction of certain compounds. As an example baking, drying, or microwaving an onion will produce an \"overcooked cabbage\" flavor that's very mild. High temperature cooking in a fat will create more volatiles and a stronger flavor.\n\nThe cooking (heat) will actually inactivate the \"trigger\" enzyme that starts this process. This is why alliums cooked as a whole piece are extremely mild, sweet, and/or nutty. A popular example most people would be familiar with is roasted garlic. If you've ever tasted raw garlic you know there is a HUGE difference in flavors. This is because when your teeth crush the uncooked garlic cells it launches the enzyme that activates the defense sulfates which make it taste extremely bitter and astringent. **When you blanch the garlic (or any allium) it essentially \"cuts the red wire\" on the molecule bomb in each cell so they don't get set off.** So what are you tasting then? You're still tasting them a little bit but they're different because they're in their inert \"unweaponized\" state so they produce a mild nuttiness to taste instead. You're also tasting the sugars now since they aren't being covered up by the sulfate flavors that push every other molecule out of the way.\n\nSo the basic take-away is this: the more you beat your onions up before heating them, the stronger the sulfer-activated flavor will be (Bitter/ Astringent). The less you do they'll be sweeter, nuttier, and much more mild as the heat will inactivate the sulfate defenses. In summation grating the onion will create a more bitter flavor that will counteract the sugars. Bigger pieces = milder and sweeter. Smaller pieces = astringent and \"onion-y\". (When you're heating up an onion. Raw onion will always be astringent no matter how you cut it because chewing activates it's cells defenses)\n\n>2. Does the taste of a dish matter in the way onion/tomatoes are cut up?\n\nI pretty much answered that above but I'll use this to talk about raw ingredients. Our taste buds are actually pretty bad at picking up flavors, but this is actually a good thing because it means we can pick up multiple flavors at once. If the molecules could more strongly attach to our receptors then we'd have to wait for a flavor to pass before tasting another because they can't knock each other out of the way.\n\nIt seems obvious but it's worth stating: the more of an ingredient there is, the more you taste it. What isn't as obvious is this has to not only apply to the dish as a whole but *each bite*. You won't taste it if it's not on your fork, and on the other end of that scale if the pieces are too big I won't taste anything else I've just eaten.  \n\nThink of the last time you had a burger and the cook sliced the tomatoes as thick as the burger patty itself, or the onion. That was probably all you could taste right? Because the sheer amount of flavor molecules from that much of one ingredient will \"knock\" all the other flavors away from your receptors. So with raw ingredients like onion the size matters very much but that's a choice you have to make about how much of a particular flavor you really want on each bite. I know plenty of people that actually love a super sized amount of veggies on their burger. \n\nThe other example I have is *pico de gallo* versus *tomato salsa*. Most non-Mexicans know them as both essentially the same ingredients. One is pureed and the other is hand chopped and mixed together. They have similar, albeit slightly different, flavor profiles. Salsa makes a medley of all of the flavors into one \"super flavor\" but that's all you taste.\n\nWith pico the flavors are spread out like a party in your mouth. Because of the weak bond between flavor molecules and receptors you're capable of experiencing all of those flavors in \"waves\" as the ingredients get chewed and they overpower the receptors in their little area of your tongue for only a moment before something else moves in. This can make each bite a little different (as opposed to the more uniform blended salsa) and a less \"heavy\" taste as you won't fatigue your receptors with piles and piles of a specific flavor molecule. They both taste great. One isn't better than the other, except when you would rather have one than the other for whatever your goals are.\n\nOn the flip side of ***that*** you also masticate (chew) your food more efficiently then anything can puree it. As a results bigger pieces get chewed easier than small pieces because they can get moved between your teeth easier without slipping around your mouth like a small piece would. The flavor of smaller raw ingredients, therefore, also \"last longer\" as your mouth is not as efficient at turning it into a mixed \"prison slop\" ready to swallow. \n\n>3. What kind of a difference does it make to the taste of a dish when something is pureed as opposed to chopped or as opposed to grated?\n\nAs a general question not related to just onions the answer is basically \"it depends on the ingredient\" and how you're gonna apply it to your cooking. All foods will react in different ways to different forms of physical damage.\n\n>4. As an example, how will pureed garlic alter the dish as opposed to using chopped garlic in it?\n\nUsing everything I mentioned above the pureed garlic will have a stronger more bitter flavor than chopped garlic. And from there the size of the chop will determine its final flavor as all of the cells that are on the \"inside\" of each piece won't activate the sulfates. So the bigger the pieces, the more cells that won't begin that process.\n\nSources:\n*On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen* by Harold McGee p. 310 (regarding the onion)\n\n*Molecular Gastronomy: Exploring the Science of Flavor* by Herv\u00e9 This p. 86-109 (regarding taste, digestion, and  the human side of the answer.)", "In simple terms, I\u2019ll say this:  the coarser the cut, the less consistent the flavor is of that particular ingredient is in the final dish, and vice versa.  \n\nBasically, let\u2019s say that you\u2019re making a beef stew and onions are required, so you mince them and saut\u00e9.  The finer the onions are chopped, the more of their own fluids will leak, strengthening the flavor of onion in the entire dish.  However, onions don\u2019t magically lose moisture which they had just because they\u2019re cut a different way (unless they\u2019re completely blitzed in a food processor let\u2019s say).  So, therefore, in the same stew, had you cut the onions into larger pieces, the flavor would still be the same, just spread out less consistently throughout the dish.  Instead of a noticeably pleasant onion flavor you\u2019d get bursts of sweetness from larger pieces of onion.  This is just a matter of whether or not you like homogeneity in your food.", "Here is something I found...doesn't answer all your questions but it is a good read. Doesn't only mention caramelizing...Hope you find all the answers to your questions.\n\nhttps://blog.memeinge.com/fun-fact-friday-caramelizing-onions/", "Generally more onions, more sweetness. Smaller the onion, smoother the sauce,. Subcontinental food uses onions very very frequently as a base for curries and the texture and taste is determined to an extent by how we cut the onions and of course, how much we use of them relattive to other ingredients . I havent compared the curries side by side but i know that i get a sweeter base with pureed onions as opposed to sliced ones. Even if i caramelise them exactly to the same degree. Cooking is chemistry after all.  \nI have to admit i most chop onions fine for most everyday curries now because it saves time in chopping and cooking, and its a good compromise.", "People have discussed flavor, but no one has really discusses *texture*.  \nDepending on the *sugar content* of what you cook, that caramelization process makes a most noticeable change in texture as well as taste, and THAT is where your main differences lie.\n\nIf flavor concentration was the only factor, the world would successfully live off of tubes of pre-chewed mush.../s\n\nI LOVE onions. We were very poor growing up, and onions are a cheap flavoring...  \nThe difference you ask about is related to the sugar content of onions, which can actually be quite high.\n\nBut, the more you break down the cellular structure of the onion, the more you mash together its cellular structure, combining the various chemical properties that make an onion such a unique vegetable for consumption. Acids, and tannins, and other flavor compounds I don't knowledgeably know the specs on, and don't care to research... You can find a yellow onion that is as sweet as a white one, but boy, they won't taste the same, raw or caramelized.\n\nIf you took one onion, and broke it down to the various forms you ask about (grated, chopped, pureed), you will find that in caramelization, yes, you will concentrate those sugars and complex flavor compounds by the same process. But, by changing the way the onion cells containing the flavor are \"hanging out together,\" you will lose some of the \"umami,\" that is onion, as the juices are more and more freed from their cellular containers.\n\nPersonally, I have found that the flavor compounds that give onions a bit of an acrid, or borderline \"bitter,\" flavor, seem to concentrate as much as the sugars, and intensify.  \nCaramelizing puree will enhance the \"onion,\" flavor as much as the sweet.  \nDepending on the brand of onion (Red, Yellow, White) and the water content, as well as how long  you  caramelize it, you will intensify the onion flavor far more with puree than with chopped or grated.\n\nBut, *texture* changes (at least for me) dramatically. Releasing all those sugars from the cells by pureeing, even with the less sweet varieties, like yellow, when combined with the allium compounds gives the onions a texture that isn't caramelization, unless you cook it down really hard, and even then, the sugars do not brown the same way. I find that the alkaloids  make the solids kind of \"jellify,\" before drying out.\n\nDepending what you're using them in, and the amount, that texture may be irrelevant, or covered up with other food textures, but (for me) it is a more pronounced, somewhat slimy mouthfeel if what I'm cooking as a lot of onions (which my cooking tends to have, as 1. I'm still poor, and 2. I LOVE onions and use them in almost every savory thing I cook...  \nThe more intact the onion pieces, the more the separate flavor compounds can retain their \"individuality,\" giving food an accent.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I puree onions and dehydrate them just to be able to add those specific flavor notes to certain types of dishes - Red onions, with their higher sugar content, are, IMO to die for, pureed and dehydrated into a powder...diced fine and dehydrated make dried onion piece that make any food you use them with absolutely sing, from sprinkled on salad to added to bread dough for bages...mmmmm....  \nBut when I caramelize, I try to use slices or large chunks, so that the \"onion\" specific compounds don't mingle too much with the released sugars. This allows the sugars to brown and accent the onion flavors, not just become a mishmash of them.\n\n\\~Spuddlebuns", "Many people have explained the science behind it, so let me just tell you in context of Indian food: \n\n1. Some dishes call for grated OR pureed onions. It's a personal preference. Making a puree of raw onions is personally not my preference, as they cook up bitter. This is done in some curries to make the sauce smooth, not chunky. For example, butter chicken is cooked in a smooth sauce. So everything that goes into it is pureed. My way of doing it is chopping onions, caramelizing them, making the sauce with most of the ingredients, then using an immersion blender before adding chicken. (Other dishes require onions chopped to specific fineness and cooked to specific stages, because the surface area does indeed make a difference in how sweet or sharp a dish will be.) \n\n2. The taste definitely depends on how you chop onions. Excellent explanations given by other redditors. \n\n3. I think I read the answer to the puree question, but honestly, pureed onions taste bitter, especially when you try to cook them down. Raw pureed onions aren't very appealing. I don't personally think there's a difference between grated and pureed when you try to cook them, but grated isn't as much of a mush as pureed is. It's still bitter to me. I've tried both. \n\n4. Folks answered the garlic question. We use pureed garlic in most dishes but some call for chopped. It's the same thing - cell walls breaking down, etc. Pureed garlic also gets bitter when overcooked, so knowing when to stop cooking it is important in Indian cooking.", "The cut does matter! Kenji Lopez-Alt explains it very well, but basically cutting an onion pole to pole vs in rings will determine how many of the cells get destroyed by the knife passing through. the more cells get destroyed, the more sulfuric acid you will release. I personally haven't done a side by side comparison but more acidic flavors will be released. When grating an onion, you're destroying most of the cell walls therefore releasing even more of that sulfuric acid. You say specifically with a dish with caramelized onions, I imagine that when you cook the onions for a while to reach caramelization then it doesn't really matter because you are breaking down the sugars and cell walls one way or the other. The main difference you are going to get is in texture, if you chop it finely (diced) you are going to get a couple little pieces every couple bites, in strands fewer bites will have a lot of onion, and grated will be \"creamier\" i.e. very small bits every single bite.", "Surface area to volume ratio. The finer you cut something up the higher surface area to volume ratio you have. Caramelizing is a surface effect so simply put the more surface you have the more caramelized the food will be.", "For onions to caramelize in an open frypan on a stovetop, both heat and moisture must be present in a way that balances both from getting too extreme. If the onions are in too much liquid, then they will not caramelize. If the onions are too dry, then they will burn.", "I mean... Why not just try it out? Can't take you more than an hour with a few pans.", "So basically everyone is correct in the sense the longer you cook something the deeper the flavour but that impacts texture (like overcooked noodles or vegetables get mushy). For onions they don't get mushy but do get \"slimy\" so when you carmelized or do a onion brulee it's pure deep flavour with a ok mouth feel. Speaking strictly on the size of ingredients (non protiens like fruit and veggies), not only does the size impact texture and mouth feel but it impacts the flavour. When you puree,grate, or chop finely you are increasing the amount of surface area. This means you are getting more of that ingredient on your tongue so you taste it more. Ex. If you eat a roundelle or large dice piece of carrot it will taste \"woody\", if you eat a jullienne or fine dice it will taste like just carrot, if you finely grate it it will be somewhat mushy but also it has more carrot juice and surface area making it sweeter than the others (sweetness depends on how small of a grate it is, smaller=sweeter). You can think of it like adding butter to something, butter in its solid form tastes more like \"milk\" generally speaking, but once it comes in contact with heat you get the rich \"butter\" taste, or you spread it across something not warm is the middle ground (you taste butter but it is still \"milky\"). Anyways I know this was a long reply but I'm currently in a food science class and this is what I've learned and how it was explained to me. Hope this helps, happy cooking!", "I'm sure there may be some difference in intensity, but for me I would think it's more about final texture. Do you have onion almost melted and melding throughout the dish or pieces you can bite into? That type of thing.", "Hamburger?\n\nThe way you add onion in many shapes and cooking styles do make a difference.", "I would believe that by further destroying the cellular structure of the product at hand, which in this case is the onion, more sugars will be released. That way the caramelisation process of a pureed onion will be far greater in terms of flavour and much lesser time to cook (and even burn). Grated onions would also have a far better flavour when caramelized than chopped onions, but not as much as pureed onions \n\nAt least that\u2019s what I believe if I am wrong I hope to be corrected", "if I had to guess the finer the cut on the onion the more surface area you create, thus creating a stronger flavor?", "Lots of Indian curries that I\u2019ve made start out with a pur\u00e9ed onion or two. The recipe I use for Butter Chicken starts this way. The first time I tried it I thought it would be overpoweringly oniony. But somehow you don\u2019t really taste the onions.", "I do a fair bit of Indian cooking and as I've understood it the purpose of the onion paste is to thicken the sauce.", "The \"best\" way to cut onions for caramelizing for soup is ribbons- slice the onion in half and make radial cuts from tip to base before cutting off the root end.\n\nPer ATK plus other sources I've read and seen.."]}

Arguably a marketing opportunity to move product\n\n2) in the fall we have sold our first batches to our usual clients. For me that is stores, friends, tourists.

Forget about Vermont and Wisconsin being American states, in this respect, we\u2019re all from the fabled country of Erablia, with Ontario and NB; others are heathens. On a more serious note, the Old Canadiens lived in all those states since the first voyages, and the exodus of next to a million poor French Canadians at the start of the century was almost all to these states. Maybe that\u2019s why we\u2019re so similar in many respects, I guess. \n\nI think many here didn\u2019t grew up in a place where maple is abondant.\n\nMaple syrup is definitely a spring thing, firstly, and that is true even though it can be consumed all year long.\n\nIn Qu\u00e9bec, spring is still very cold, and I guess that\u2019s true in our brother states, as it is true in other maple provinces. You just can\u2019t beat fresh maple syrup, and the traditional Qu\u00e9bec chalet or house often smells like sugary heaven when traditionalists cook it up all day long. The tradition is also to taste it every time you can, from the basic eau d\u2019\u00e9rable to the fully done stuff. Children love it, and frankly everybody else. It\u2019s not done everywhere nowadays, of course, but it\u2019s still done in many, many homes.\n\nBut in Qu\u00e9bec, the Cabane \u00e0 sucre season is an Important tradition, one that is upheld by almost every student of the province. All the schools I know make the student go on their pilgrimage, and this is action is always in spring, hence the association with spring. It\u2019s a cultural \u201chub\u201d too, as there\u2019s French Canadians traditional songs and some places even dress the employees with French Canadian clothes. It\u2019s tacky, it\u2019s fun. If you want an example of Cabane \u00e0 sucre food at its extreme form, the Cabane \u00e0 sucre - Pied de cochon is a contemporary form of food decadence. It\u2019s haute cuisine, rural Qu\u00e9bec style.\n\nWe can\u2019t stop there though. Some posters said that it can be a summer food. For sure, maple syrup can be put on everything. My wife\u2019s coffee is sugared in maple syrup only, for example. Mainly, it is sugared stuff, like some desserts, that are the representative of maple in summer, and it\u2019s mostly the sugar, not the syrup. However it is not a tradition, and it\u2019s not that common too.\n\nLike other knowledgeable posters said, it\u2019s useful to know that the syrup is graded. For the layman, we use three categories : dark, ambered, golden. While golden is the most known elsewhere from what I know, ambered is the most common here. People eat it all the time, so no real season about it. While they\u2019re all good, no judgement, golden is better for the light taste that you might want in a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois summer, humid and heavy.\n\nThe least common is often the dark syrup, and that\u2019s the one more common in Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois cooking. It\u2019s super rich, and thus mainly used for winter cooking. Maybe you\u2019ve already eaten Qu\u00e9bec traditional dishes? Poutine is pretty known nowadays, and while it\u2019s not really a dish tied to maple syrup, it can be an example, as generally Qu\u00e9bec cuisine is a heavy, heavy cuisine made for poor people living in harsh winters. So it\u2019s hot and fatty. Dark syrup goes well with this, you can imagine. \n\nSo yeah, if you cook ham or sausages in winter, well, you\u2019re going to use syrup for sure in many recipes. It\u2019s not as associated with winter than with spring, but for sure it\u2019s the second most maplely season, if I may. \n\nAnd as always I speak too much. In a few words then, maple is almost always associated with temperature, not the season. If it\u2019s cold early in autumn, you\u2019ll eat more of it, same thing with spring; if it\u2019s a cold and long spring, you\u2019ll eat more of it in more complex dishes. The only non maple season is often summer, and even then many people now eat crepes and things like that for the season. There are no rules to maple for sure. When it\u2019s hot we often drink lemonade and sangria, when it gets cold, syrup makes us better, I guess.\n\nThe only rule is that you never call the other thing maple syrup.\n\nIn Qu\u00e9bec we call it Syrop de poteau : telephone-post syrup.\n\nSorry for the rambling, and I hope it helps!", "who says it is a spring food?", "Western MA chiming in.

We referred to this time of year as Maple Tapping Season or Maple Syrup Season (because our goal was to make the table syrup from the raw Maple tree sap) \n\nI don't know about the big industrial Maple Syrup Producers, but the families that did it as a hobby had to process and boil the sap for hours and hours on end.

{"title": "Just hired at fancy restaurant; need advice", "selftext": "TL;DR\nJust hired in a fancy restaurant, overwhelmed.\n\nAdvice? \n\n\nI've been a cook since i was 15, everywhere from Wendy's to Dennys to iHop and more recently privately owned local restaurants that pay a bit more. I never took a job in my life unless it was for more than I was making before.\n\nSo fast forward to now, I got hired at a pretty high end secret gem on the outskirts of a massive college town. Anyway the level of cooking I am doing now is just insane. I've always been a very good and very fast cook, but i am now dealing with professional chefs and incredible standards and pressure.\n\n\nRant warning,\n\nThe hardest part is probably remembering orders in order and in time, I've been doing it for 10 years but now everything has to be perfect built from scratch with raw ingredients. I mostly cook steaks and fish but then they want me to do Sautee which is what the chef does. Wtf? I mean im honored but i came from bullshit jobs.\n\nAny good chefs have solid advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/57l4pg/just_hired_at_fancy_restaurant_need_advice/", "created_utc": 1476517917.0, "score": 325, "author": "NackZeff", "num_comments": 82, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/57l4pg/just_hired_at_fancy_restaurant_need_advice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Learn how to work quietly. Like I never thought about how important closing drawers and cooler doors lightly helps the equipment, as well as the things inside (an absentminded lowboy door slamming shut can shake your sauce out of a container and spill around your lowboy over the rest of your mis en place).  And same with ovens, pots/pans, station mis en place, plates.... Basically if you're not supposed to make noise and are, you're increasing the risk of breaking or fucking something up.\n\nAlso, work from one container to another, with a trash container. Like, one bowl for mushrooms, one for trimming and discards, and one to place product in. Keep your cutting board clean except the current focus.\n\nFold your towels, stay clean. A folded towel is cleaner, more effective, takes up less room, etc.  And keep your station as clean and organized as you can. And line sweeps show a chef you don't want to lean when you don't have something to do, as well as you care about the cleanliness of his kitchen.\n\n\nSharpen your knives, and get nice ones. Show pride in what you're doing and what you use to do it. If someone has a dull ass Mercer or Shun that's been beaten to hell, I can assume they won't be caring much for whatever tasks those knives will be put to. NOTE this does not necessarily translate to knives make you better. I have indeed seen good knife work from terrible knives. So that's why I say sharpen your knives before you get a nice new set of Inox or Masamotos. Splurge after you learn to sharpen and maintain knives.\n\nStart reading cookbooks. Good ones, not Jaime Oliver's best 100 Fuck Ups or whatever. Phaidon is a fantastic publisher, with restaurants like Osteria Francescana and NoMa in their collection. But also, like just badass books about ingredients and tastes and butchering and yea. You'll learn to enjoy going through a cookbook and dissecting their creative processes and cooking methods. I suggest getting a copy of The French Laundry to begin with. Or Momofuku. Both are great starter books. The Fat Duck Cookbook is a much more advanced volume but it is oh so sweet. And maybe one day you can get a copy of elBulli or Modernist Cuisine when you've fallen in love with reading.\n\n\nStage around. If you don't know what staging (stah-j / stah -jing) is, it's basically a tryout or short intern at a restaurant traditionally used as an interview, but also as a way to get around some kitchens. It's a great way to spend a day off for workaholics like 90% of our industry. And a lot of restaurants will honor your time in their kitchen with a few dishes to taste their menu. And you get a feel for other kitchens, chefs, teams, cuisines, etc. AND you can network, set up more stages at better restaurants, set up future jobs and relationships within the industry.\n\nLastly, listen to everyone. That guy that's in the weeds every night and looks like a mess? Maybe what he tells you has some weight because he knows how he's messing up. Some of the best coaches were mediocre or even laughable players. A lot of the time everyone has sage wisdoms to share. When I train new cooks I usually try to help them beyond myself, so they start off as high off the ground as possible. If someone is giving you shit or calling you out, it's because they want to push you to be better. Take it in stride and be better, don't get offended. ", "Best to speak to /r/KitchenConfidential ", "Play to your strengths, learn and get better at your weak areas. Keep your eyes n ears open. Ask if you do not know.\n\nThings arent really THAT different. So you come from a line short order background. I can prety much guarantee you can mise en place (station prepp) rings around the regulars. The trick will be to learn that as you have taken a step from a volume focused enviroment into a quality one: what components you can prepp/precook and how far. \n\nYou need to taste everything you dish out. \"Well it was ok an hour ago\" mentality wont cut it any more. Be critical of the work you do. Dont just wing it. Would you serv it to your SO on that special night? Be critical of your work and not yourself.\n\nThe recepies, specific handling techniques and exotic raw ingredients the head or sous cheff should tell you how they want it and what ever are the special considerations. Because they will differ from place to the other. If they dont: look for a new job ASAP, be cause they're assholes and you deserve better.\n\nShow some elementary understanding that it is after all a profit making business -> know what the ingridiants are worth and show it in your work. The general worth of the goods at your disposal will have dramatically changed from your last place.\n\nAbove all else: remember that when the crap hits the fan (because its a kitchen ergo it will happen) find your Zen mode and work the problem; don't let the problem work you.\n\nPut in some focus and effort and you will do fine.\nRef: ex-chef, seafood fine dining in Europe", "[deleted]", "Stick it out. Those guys are working on another level. Make good food and ask questions. ", "Sautee is something you can learn to handle, especially if you have experience with the pace of other kitchens. It's mainly what I do at my restaurant, along with every other station once in a while if I'm not feeling it. It has its challenges for sure, especially with timing dishes properly, but you do eventually get the hang of it. If you're expecting to read a post and get good at it, you're expecting too much. I would say it takes a minimum of three months to get decent at it with a little experience. Minimum. Another three months to feel comfortable, and I would say around a year to have a really good grip on what you are doing. \n\nIt really is one of the most rewarding stations in my opinion, as it transfers over to cooking outside of the kitchen quite well. This is a station that real chefs work. Not just any line cook, but somebody who understands the craft. Anybody can slap steaks on a grill, throw stuff in a fryer, build a 30 second salad in a bowl. But this station? It requires skill. Pacing, timing, tasting, yelling and getting so pissed off you'll storm off line only to come back the next night and do it again. You'll learn when to cook what so things don't burn, when to add spices, how much to add, how long it takes to cook specific things and a whole bunch of other stuff.\n\nAnyways don't get stressed. It's all about learning and growing in this industry. Get rid of the mindset that is holding you back and dive in head first. I've been where you are. Its pretty demanding at first but you will feel more like an actual chef than a short order cook if you work at it. \n\nAnd hey, if you end up not liking it? Just quit and move on. There are endless other restaurants out there for you, which is the great part of being a cook. A good one is always in demand, and that is a promise. \n", "This might be a little off topic, but I think it's good advice.

I think dill is really the only exception because it's so strong it works with anything.\n\nThe same goes for drying.

That\u2019s the cool thing about cooking is that everything is versatile", "Generally speaking any tough, or woody type of herb (like rosemary, thyme, anise) I add to braises at the beginning of cooking. If it's light and leafy (basil, cilantro, parsley) I add it at the end of cooking or even as a garnish.", "Herb things I learned:\n\n-some herbs are fat soluble only (rosemary, oregano, sage) they should be added before anything watery is introduced, or infused into butter/oil beforehand and added to dishes.\n\n-the greenest herbs (basil, mint, parsley) shouldn't be chopped too hard as their cell walls can break down and turn black and release bitter notes. It's best to cut them with your best knife in straight, confident strokes. If you need to pummle them, still be as soft as possible, ie don't mash it but gently crush it.\n\n-usually the stems of most herbs are perfectly edible. They're just most fiberous, so if chopped well and added early, they work and taste great, sometimes even more flavorful than the leaves in the case of Parsley and cilantro. Alternatively save them, freeze them, and throw them in your next broth. This excludes more woody-stemmed herbs like rosemary sage oregano and thyme.\n\n-add herbs like cilantro and basil in stages to build layers of flavor. Cilantro cooked till it disappears tastes amazing, but so does fresh cilantro, so add some in the beginning, some 5 minutes before you're done and garnish with fresh cilantro in the end.\n\n-learn to chifonade. Also get a mortar and pestle. Both do wonders with different herbs. If you're making guac, pesto or chimichurri, hand crushing works way better than food processors, which has to do again with the way their cell walls contain bitter notes if crushed.", "General rule of thumb is to add the dried herbs during the long, slow cooking process, and finish with fresh herbs (or add at the end of cooking).", "Something else you can do with softer herbs that would traditionally go in at the end is use them to infuse your cooking oil at the beginning.\n\nFor instance, when I make a weeknight pasta sauce, I start olive oil in a cold pan with garlic and a couple sprigs of basil. I bring the olive oil up to medium heat until the garlic is lightly browned and the oil is shimmering. Then I pull the basil leaves and add the canned tomatoes. It makes a pretty noticeable and lasting flavor impact.", "I know you can do literally whatever with bay leaf", "For most people cooking is a lot like having a long relationship with someone when you can remember a lot of things you've loved and a lot of moments when you failed the other person.  I'm sure we can all think of the times we've added a beautiful green herb to a dish only to find it later as a gnarly brown thing in your beautiful flaked pastry.\n\nAs a chemist and pharmacist I always think of herbs as substances used for extraction.  There is a museum in one of the pharmacy schools in Philadelphia that has all of these wonderful glass globes from the 1800s where they would extract the chemicals from natural compounds into alcohols which would become tonics.  It is a wonderful example of how herbs interact in your food.  The time they are in contact with your cooking, the temperatures and the composition all matter in determining the flavor they will impart.\n\nI'd recommend you experiment because every way you use your herbs will have a different result.  Adding fresh, 'wet' herbs at the end of the dish is a sure way to add lightness.  \n\nI think a lot of people here have already answered you as much as possible but I'd recommend you try things out and I'll give you a couple things right off the bat:\n\nFor Thyme I have had beautiful bistro lunches in Paris where a long sprig of thyme is added to the butter in the pan with a steak and then lit on fire on the way to the table.  The flavor extracts into the butter and the fire adds a scent.\n\nFor Rosemary I am always extracting into Olive oil.  My partner makes extraordinary Focaccia bread and instead of adding the rosemary to the dough or atop we have taken to using olive oil that has been infused to make the bread.  The flavor comes out of nowhere and people are left looking all over the place for those little needles but they never find them!\n\nOregano is much more wild.  There are a couple varieties but the most important distinction is whether it is dried or fresh.  Dried oregano is one of the few herbs that I keep in a shaker because it has its uses.  If you do have fresh and it is of the Mediterranean variety it has a more assertive and peppery notes which can be used lightly in a Cacio e Pepe because the herbal pepper notes go well with the cheese and crushed black pepper.  \n\nHave fun cooking!", "Once exception would be tarragon - it works great steeped in a cream sauce!  Remove the tarragon after the sauce is complete.\n\nOr, it can be added at the end sprinkled for the green color and the deep anise flavor - bright when used this way, or put into emulsions for salad dressings, blending into the mix.\n\nI grow it in my garden; I cut it back once a month and it always returns bigger and better than ever.  It helps to fertilize.  As a result, tarragon is a big win in my kitchen.", "It depends on the type of cuisine and what you are cooking.\n\nFor example in South Asian cuisine, fresh herbs like cilantro leaves are added in the end. In Thai cuisine, cilantro stems and basil leaves are added early on in the curry paste.", "Plenty of good responses already here, but I just wanted to say that I often do both. Putting your herbs in early helps build a nice flavor base, while adding them towards the end keeps some of the \"fresher\" flavors that would mellow from longer cooking. \n\nMy golden rule when cooking is to taste frequently throughout the entire process (where safe, obviously don't go tasting something raw that needs to be cooked first). You can make minor adjustments along the way if you do this, and save something that may have otherwise gone completely off course. These tastings are perfect times to add seasonings so you get to learn how the flavors change over time and figure out how to get the result that you want from any particular dish.", "General rule: fresh herbs add at the end to preserve freshness, but dry herbs you add earlier so it can 're hydrate and infuse their flavors", "Thyme, Rosemary and Oregano are all considered woody herbs; and most of their flavour is in the actual stem itself (that's what I was taught). I usually tied them up stem and leaf and all and cook with them.\n\nThe picked leaves can also be eaten raw as a garnish too, but I feel they taste better when they are cooked a little bit. \n\nDelicate herbs like basil, chives and parsley should be added at the end of cooking or kept raw.", "They only place herbs belong is in the bin"]}

{"title": "Welcome to /r/AskCulinary! PLEASE READ!", "selftext": "WELCOME! [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) recently hit 250K subscribers! We're thrilled that so many others find this community as informative and entertaining as we do. Our readership includes cooks of all skill levels, from pro chefs to total beginners, and it's wonderful to see everyone coming together to help each other out.\n\nSince our corner of reddit is growing, the mod team thought it was a good time to post a refresher on our rules:\n\n# POSTING:\n\n1. **NO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OF FOOD SAFETY.** We can't tell you anything about the specific packet of chicken or pot of soup you left out overnight. General questions about good food safety practices are allowed, but for specific situations we recommend you consult government food safety guidelines for your area and when in doubt, throw it out.\n2. **PROVIDE AS MUCH INFO AS YOU CAN.** We can't help you if you don't tell us what you've already done first. Please provide the recipe you're working from and tell us what went wrong with it or what you'd like to improve about it. \"I've tried everything\" isn't specific enough. If you're following a video recipe, consider putting a timestamp at the relevant portion of the video or writing out the recipe in text form.\n3. **NO RECIPE REQUESTS.** If you have a recipe you'd like help adjusting or troubleshooting, we'd love to help you! But [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is not in the business of providing recipes. There are [tons of other subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/wiki/relatedsubs) that can help you with that.\n4. **NO BRAINSTORMING.** We do make exceptions for mass quantities (real past examples: wheelbarrow full of walnuts; nearly 400 ounces of canned tuna; 50 lbs of whole chicken), but \"What do I do with my last three limes?\" or \"What should I serve with this pork loin?\" should go to [/r/cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/cooking). We also make exceptions for rare or unusual ingredients that [/r/cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/cooking) might not have the expertise to handle.\n5. **NO BRAND RECOMMENDATIONS** or \"What piece of equipment should I get?\" posts. It's very rare that one person has enough experience with multiple brands or models of a particular item to provide an objective response. We suggest you consult sources like Consumer Reports.\n6. **NO GENERAL DISCUSSION.** [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is modeled after [/r/AskScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScience) and [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians), not [/r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit). Community discussions are reserved for our weekly stickied posts. If you have a discussion question that you think people would find interesting or engaging, please [**send a modmail**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskCulinary) so we can add it to our list of discussion questions.\n7. **NO SURVEYS.** If you think your survey might be a good fit for this community, please send a modmail first so the team can determine if our subreddit or a different one would be more appropriate.\n8. **DON'T COME HERE JUST TO PICK A FIGHT.** This isn't [/r/DebateCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateCulinary). We can tell if you came here just to argue with people, and we will remove your post on the grounds that the question was asked in bad faith.\n\n# COMMENTING:\n\n1. **BE NICE TO EACH OTHER.** Politeness is not optional at [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary). We're all here to help each other learn new things and succeed in the kitchen.\n2. **TOP LEVEL COMMENTS MUST ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.** Saying \"oh hey, I always wondered that too!\" or \"try it and let us know!\" doesn't help OP. Comments asking for more information and comments made in good faith that don't *directly* address OP's *exact* question but provide an alternate solution are OK.\n3. **NO LINKS WITHOUT EXPLANATION.** The reason people come to [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) is because the people who answer questions here are real people with real kitchen advice. If you find a good source that answers OP's question, please provide it! But also provide at least a little bit of extra information so OP knows what they're clicking on and what to expect.\n4. **NO JOKES.** We're here to help OP. If OP comes back to their post and finds a dick joke about sausages instead of a helpful answer, they're going to be disappointed. Remember that our main goal is to be helpful.\n\n**FULL COMMENT ETIQUETTE POLICY:** Comments should be factual, helpful, thorough, and respectful. When commenting avoid abuse, jokes, chatter, speculation, and especially links without explanation.\n\n**FAQs:** See our [Ingredient, Equipment, and Food Life FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/wiki/faq) to find answers on common topics like caring for cast iron and whether you should go to culinary school or not.\n\nLastly, please use the report button to let moderators know about posts or comments that violate one of the above rules! We spend a lot of time here but we can't catch everything on our own. We depend on you guys to help us keep bots, antagonistic weirdos, and habitual rule-breakers away.\n\nIf you have any questions about the above rules or thoughts on the community reaching this milestone, please leave a comment below!\n\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE for making [/r/AskCulinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary) such a fantastic place!

This means more tenderness and more flavour.\n\nThe two main proteins in muscular fibres are Actin and Myosin. Myosin will break down first at upwards of 40 degrees in fish and upwards of 50 degrees in meat. This will lead to more tenderness and flavour - great! So drawing a parallel to adding acid, it will begin by denaturing the myosin in a similar way.\n\nHowever the Actin will begin to denature at higher temperatures - around 66 degrees and upwards. Actin makes up the structural filaments and breaking too much of this down means the moisture held within the protein is lost. So too long a period exposed to strong acid will act in the same way.\n\nThinking about the effects of milder acids such as olive oil it may have the ability to denature Myosin but not actin so we've tenderised but not \"over-marinaded\".

Because honestly, nothing we eat is without risk of some kind.\n\nEggs can be infected by salmonella in one of two ways: First, bacteria can be passed from an infected hen to her eggs as they develop inside her. Chickens can be vaccinated against this to mitigate that type of risk. Second, it can grow on the outside of the shell after an egg is laid if it comes in contact with a hen\u2019s poop that contains salmonella.\n\nIn the US, the USDA requires eggs sold for consumption to be washed, processed, and then refrigerated. Washing them ensures that any salmonella that was present on the outside of the shells is removed. But- there's a trade off. Washing eggs removes the thin, filmy, protective outer layer called the cuticle. This cuticle is the natural shield that keeps bacteria out of an egg while letting oxygen circulate. \n\nOn the other hand, most European and Asian countries do the opposite and require that table eggs not be wet-washed, and also not refrigerated, because they still have their protective cuticle. Its thus recommended that non-washed eggs be washed immediately before consumption to remove any trace amounts of poop.\n\nBoth regulations were arrived at as effective ways to solve the same problem: reducing exposure to salmonella, a bacteria that causes unpleasant, though non-life-threatening, illness.  \n\nAdditionally, cooking isn't the only way to ensure food safety. Other ingredients like acid and salt in things like mayo and salad dressings help to create an environment that is less friendly to bacteria growth.\n\nIn the US, the CDC estimates Salmonella bacteria cause about 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths in the United States every year and that *most people recover without specific treatment.* Infants, adults aged 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are the most likely to have severe infections.\n\nMost establishments will note on their menus any items that contain raw eggs so that people can make their own decisions whether or not to consume them.", "I think you'll be interested in [this discussion from StackExchange](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/33331) which discusses in some depth various funded research studies conducted on homemade mayonnaise.\n\nIn brief, you actually want to store it at room temperature for 24+ hours so that the acid can effectively kill harmful pathogens, which does not happen effectively at fridge temperatures.\n\nAnother alternative, as has been already suggested by other commenters here, is to start with pasteurized eggs.

Effing Rachel Ray is notorious for this.  \"On my granpops coat tails I would watch him make [fill in the blank] over and over and over again.  What the Eff happened to just finding a recipe, liking it and modifying it to meet your tastes.  There's nothing wrong with that. \n* It's not about the food or the ingredient. Its about how one can get bacon in something and how convenient it is.  Drives me nutz.  Honestly, I spend more time sourcing my ingredients than I spend cooking most nights.  \n* Can I just include Guy Fieri as a whole. He's all over the place and doesn't like eggs. Who doesn't like eggs? No skills, no palette, nothing other than the camera loves him.  He's the epitome of what's wrong with cooking shows now.  \n\nThings I miss about cooking shows of yore, that is missing currently:\n\n* what happened to just cooking?  As someone mentioned earlier, Great Chefs of the World. What a great effing show.  No fan fare, not boring ass story, just a chef with his mise and him cooking. That is all. Loved it and would love to see it on air again sometime. \n* No explanation as to the why?  Julia was an expert at this.  Don't crowd your beef for boeuf bourguignon,  and here's why.  Another that was great at this was Jeffery Rosengarten.  I think back to the old days of Food TV, when it was just Mario, Emeril, and reruns of Julia. This coupled with Great Chefs of the World really piqued my interest in cooking and made me want to be a better chef. \n\nWhat's Missing in cooking shows now:\n\n* More focus on the science and how to get more flavor out of your food.  I'd love to see a series  based on the the book Moderinist Cuisine at Home.  Talk about sous vide, benefits, pitfalls, drawbacks.  How to use a pressure cooker for something other than canning.  How to use sodium citrate in cheese sauces for a sauce that never breaks.  how to make hollandiase sauce with an immersion blender. Why the maillard principle is important on meat as well as vegetables.  What is umami? Stuff like that. \n* How to plan your menu, how to go about planning the sequence of events so things are completed in the order you need them to be, not completed in the order that they were started.  How often do you start something  for a meal and solely focus on that until its done before starting on the next thing.  \n\n", "I used to watch food network incessantly and still have a couple people that I'll watch when convenient.

TV 'chefs' might write their own monologues, do menu ideas and sizzle things on camera but that does not make them a chef. \n\nObviously there are guys like Ramsay and Marco that have transitioned to TV but they are chefs who are now TV personalities. I guarantee their daily lives are vastly different from when they cooked exclusively. I often wonder how they deal with not being top dog on a shoot and doing what they are told to do by studio producers and directors. They probably just think of the cheque at the end of the month which will be a lot more than the margins on a restaurant. \n\nSo to answer you're question about what annoys me with TV chefs?

But yeah there is not alternative to airing it out\n\nWithout actually smelling, it's hard to tell which spice it is. if it's the typical Indian food smell, it's the combination of the spices, or it could be the kasturi.methi but you can probably just directly smell it to compare.", "Onion, garlic and cumin are the main culprits.

I also live in a very cold and dry city, so maybe this is just the natural advantage for me, but that has been my experience", "Roasted is the answer.

Ozium is a spray that helps.", "Not sure there's an answer to this.  \n\nWhen I worked retail, Indian and Pakistani restaurant workers would come in, and they had that aroma baked into their coats and clothes.  It's a very definite group of spices.  I could pick out very strong garlic & cardamom, after that there were definite notes of turmeric, coriander, (star?) anise.  They're all components of various curry powders and pastes.  \n\nBut, once they get into fabric, I'm not sure what process there is that can remove them.  Maybe steaming or dry cleaning, I don't know.

I tried that once - had to get rid of the (very expensive) filters after one cooking session.", "Asafoetida is famous for having a scent that sticks around.  It's most  likely that, with maybe a bit of the cumin, onion and garlic contributing. Best way I've found to get rid of lingering smells like this, put a cup of water and a cup of vinegar in a pan on your stove, and simmer it  until at least half has evaporated. Yes it will stink like vinegar while you do this, and for a little while afterwards, but it won't stick around, and it will take other smells away. Works on all kinds of smells. (The acetic acid in vinegar binds to odors, and quickly clears them)  You can also leave a dish of baking soda or activate charcoal sitting out to absorb lingering odors, those this takes a while. If smells are really bad, try simmering vinegar, and afterward set a dish of baking soda or charcoal out overnight. And repeat the vinegar if needed. I've used this to clear the smell out of a place a smoker lived for a while. You can also add some citrus peels or cinnamon to the vinegar to help add a pleasant covering smell.  And make SURE that any asfoetida is in a tightly closed glass or metal container. It's smell can get through anything less.", "You have to have a exterior venting hood fan running.

The ingredients for a full batch are:\n\n1/2 cup red wine vinegar  \n2 tablespoons granulated garlic  \n1 teaspoon salt  \n1/2 teaspoon pepper  \n1 tablespoon dried oregano  \n2 cloves fresh garlic  \n3/4 cup boiling water  \n1 cup olive oil  \n1 cup vegetable oil  \n\nAdd everything except the oil to a blender and blend. Gradually add the oil, and run until it thickens, about a minute or so after the oil is fully added. I've found that jarred or tube garlic doesn't work, it's gotta be fresh garlic.

I've had moderate success using yogurt- which is a bonus because it adds a nice tartness. The coolest emulsifier I've used was homemade preserved lemon- the fermentation breaks it down and eliminates the bitterness in the rind, and it helps release the pectin which gives the dressing a great texture.\n\nI've done prep as simple as bringing a tiny jar to work with me and shaking it for like 20 seconds before I eat. The emulsion holds for like an hour while I eat, so it's a lot better than adding the dressing in the morning and opening up a soggy mess at lunch time.

OP can heat the milk to kill the pathogens or can use it to sterilize your equipment. 160 F is a magic point where heat is not overly damaging but pasteurization happens in mere seconds.

In truth  pretty much everything you're using (aside from sugar/oil) has water but some things are better for sauteing, i.e. garlic, onion, thyme, oregano, etc. These should be at the very least sweat in a good amount of cooking fat (your choice). Then you add the watery ingredients -- tomatoes, vegetables, stock, puree, sauce, etc. If you add these too soon, it limits the temperature your overall sauce can reach to the boiling point of water, which is too low to extract some of the good flavors you want.\n\nI don't know if you prefer your sauce chunky but I actually cook the canned tomatoes for a bit and then blend the whole sauce for consistency and to emulsify a bit of oil into the sauce (if you have a lot of oil you'll see it lightens in color substantially when this happens). Fat in sauces helps to round out flavors and \"soften\" the hard acidic/bitter edges.\n\nAlso sounds like you're using a TON of ingredients in your sauce -- I generally make mine with garlic, onion, olive oil, canned tomatoes and salt, that's it.

Caramelising onions slowly will do the job, but sugar is a simpler way (I don\u2019t like adding sugar personally).\n\nSalt definitely helps but be careful not to overseason.\n\nInfuse oil with garlic and a bit of chilli and oregano at the start if you like. The chunks of garlic can be removed if you don\u2019t want it to be overpowering. I prefer chili flakes over powder, can\u2019t tell you why! Add fresh basil right at the end, it sort of wilts otherwise and loses intensity.\n\nUse some pasta water to thin the sauce at the end to reduce some of the strength of the flavour.\n\nThis will make a reasonable tomato sauce. I think then the veggies usually need some work to shine through, apart from the mushrooms they don\u2019t have the strongest flavour. Are you saut\u00e9ing them first? Or grilling?

If you dump them into a pot en masse, the best you'll get is boiled tomatoes. No carmelization. \n\nWith the water content that high, you won't get much over 100c. Use a wide skillet and a good olive oil. Don't skimp on the oil. It allows for the needed higher temp. My preference is not to use evoo, but to each their own.

You can add meat like ground chuck and/or pork to brown if you'd like, but it's not necessary for a good sauce.

A large brown onion.  Those 4 cloves of garlic. A tin of quality tomatoes in puree is ideal.  A tablespoon of tomato paste.  Brown sugar, salt/pepper. Thyme OR Oregano.\n\nBrown your onion first, add the garlic towards the end of browning the onions so it doesnt burn.  Then brown your meat.  Dont use aubergine and courgette  - they have so much water in them that you will have to spend quite a long time cooking the sauce to reduce the amount of water in it.  You can add them later when you get the basic sauce nailed. You're going for a thick mud like consistency that will just about stay heaped on a spoon.

(You do need some oil, not only to caramelize the onion in, but also to solubilize the oil-soluble flavor compounds.) Anywhere from light golden brown to deep honey brown will do.  If you do this right you shouldn't need sugar - caramelized onions are sweet.  Only when the onion is done do you add the watery ingredients for a simmer.\n\nDon't add the basil, oregano or thyme until the last minute of cooking.  Cooking drives off some of the lighter aromatics and can destroy others.  I also wait until the last minute to add garlic, but I like the sharp, pungent flavor of uncooked garlic.  If you don't want that, fine-dice and caramelize the garlic separately at the start for a minute or two, take it out of the pan, and add it back when there's a minute left.\n\nIf you want your sauce sweeter, the Bolognese add finely shredded carrot.  Carrot is pure sugar.  Don't caramelize them; you want those shreds to melt, not toughen.  Another way to kick up the flavor is to add a small amount of anchovy, or what my family does: clam juice.  If you use clam juice don't talk about it; it's a secret.\n\nWe call courgettes zucchini.  In my opinion, these should be kept completely away from food prep areas, lest someone mistake them for food.", "Butter!", "I would say the pasta sauce needs to cook longer as others have mentioned. The most important part in this is the simmering. I only recently learned (after making many a bad sauce to my SO's rebuke) that simmering is just under boiling temperature. The sauce needs to be brought to a boil, and then quickly brought down to a temperature that has the sauce showing bubbles breaking the surface and creating wisps of steam. This gently cooks the ingredients. \n\nAlso adding a rind of parmesan cheese helps, and whisking in a knob of butter after the sauce is finished and you are about to plate it. \n\nI would also like to add I do not use any tin tomatoes but rather tomatoe puree, so I do not use any sugar. \n\nTheres a YouTube video about three levels of chefs cooking, and it being analyzed by a food scientist.

It's up to you where you like it, but try a long cook at first just to taste the difference.\n\nBrowning the mushrooms will only help. Lose the thyme and chili powder (if it has cumin -- you don't want cumin), add more parsley than you think at first, chopped or dried. Crushed red hot pepper is good. Black pepper is good. More salt. A pinch of sugar is fine. A chopped bell pepper will work beautifully.

{"title": "Can anyone tell me what ingredient is creating this \"honeycomb\" texture in taro fried dumplings (Wu Gok)", "selftext": "Unfortunately I don't know any dim sum chefs to ask but I would like to know what creates this honeycomb texture in this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zow8u9iEDRo). The chef explains that it has to do with the frying temp (150\u00b0C) and says if the oil is too hot it won't \"honeycomb\", but I've seen other videos where they use up to (180\u00b0C) and it still creates this effect to some, albeit lesser extent. There are many things happening in this recipe that I suspect might contribute to the honeycomb texture but I'm not sure. Can someone explain what is happening?\n\nSome observations:\n\n\\-taro itself is quite dry and \"sandy\", as is wheat starch. Together they might create a dough that doesn't hold together well when mechanically agitated, thus creating those little bits of tempura-like batter that fly around when the dough starts frying, creating the honeycomb.\n\n\\-I've also seen someone do this with celery root, so maybe it's not due to the taro itself but rather overall moisture content + wheat starch\n\n\\-part of the starch is gelatinized as they pour boiling water into the starch. Does this help create the honeycomb?\n\n\\-something about the low temperature of the frying oil seems to be important as I've seen many chefs mention it in other videos. But obviously not the only factor otherwise \"honeycomb\" fried foods would be a thing with other dishes too ;)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/xy3vnp/can_anyone_tell_me_what_ingredient_is_creating/", "created_utc": 1665160936.0, "score": 308, "author": "poniverse", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/xy3vnp/can_anyone_tell_me_what_ingredient_is_creating/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["OP your observations are pretty on point. Taro should be as starchy/\"sandy\" as possible.  Starchy taros are usually lighter since they have lower water content. The center of a taro usually have lower water content than its ends. (Wu Gok/\u828b\u89d2 are from Southern China, traditionally it's claimed that the taros from Lipu, China (\u8354\u828b) make the best Wu Gok)\n\nWheat starch. It's starch with little to no gluten and also the starch used in many other dim sums like the shrimp dumplings (Har Gao)  to provide strength and allow the Wu Gok to hold itself and puff\n\nTemperature of oil depends on which oil you choose, traditionally people use lard. But it's true that it won't honeycomb if the temperature is too high. To check your oil temperature you can always fry a small piece of wrapper first and see the results.  If the temperature is too low, the Wu Gok won't hold itself.\n\nEgg helps, but it's not necessary and not used in typical Wu Gok recipes.\n\nThe slang term people in dim sum industry used if your Wu Gok won't honeycomb is \"\u70b8\u6b7b\", literally means \"fried to death\". Some cheap-ass dim sum place don't even have Taro in Wu Gok, and it's common to add ammonia bicarbonate to help leavening.", "I think the answer is that little bits of starch are forced out of the dumpling and upward with the \"progressive frying\" technique, and then expand and the structure expands and then crisps as the starch hits the oil.\n\nMoisture in the starch from the gelatinisation probably helps with the puff - think about what happens if you get water into hot oil, but controlled to a degree by the \"stickiness\" of the starch.  \n\nAs to temp of the oil - if I'm right about the mechanics, the lower temp would create a higher puff because it gives the starch longer to expand before it gets hot enough to set/crisp than would be the case at the higher temp.", "The recommended videos include a bunch of other Taro Puffs recipes with this texture visible.  Check to see if they do anything different in order to drill down the suspects.", "I've been curious about this myself, as I make these at home and have wondered what the mechanism to create the frilly airy texture is and whether it's possible with anything other than taro root. Can't explain it, but I can rule out some explanations by process of elimination.\n\nDoesn't seem to be the oil temperature. I have fried these successfully with a single fry at a very standard temp, say 350f - no attempt to make sure the oil is \"not too hot\" or anything. I've also had the texture work regardless of whether the dough is fresh or the dumplings have been formed and frozen, then later dropped right into the oil without defrosting.\n\nIf it's the wheat starch, then the amount added / ratio isn't sensitive, because the recipe you linked has about 37% the taro weight in wheat starch. Recipe I've used is 32oz taro to 5oz wheat starch, so about 15%.\n\nI assumed baking soda (about 1tsp per 2 pound of dough) was an essential ingredient, and have had a batch disappoint when I forgot it, but the recipe you linked has no alkalinizing agent. The closest fried food I've ever had to Wu Gok in texture is a modernist fry batter that uses baking soda in the wet mix.\n\nMy main assumption was that somehow this texture is only possible specifically with taro root, but you mention seeing someone do it with celery root. That's news to me, would love to test it. I've never personally seen this texture achieved intentionally or accidentally with any other food, ever. Some people think tempura is similar - I disagree. I'd imagine if you used any other root vegetable, you'd end up with a total failure or a corndog type texture.\n\nSo... I don't know what's going on.

The short length of available proteins I  taro and put starch lens the dough to fracture as it is frying. Once fractured the issue develops in a systemized way, surfaces shrink and recoil, fractures expand and press those surfaces into sinusoidal curves, setting them. moisture leaves the system rapidly and provides for the thorough crumb development as it fissures apart. In turn new fissures develop and the process repeats, likely some relationship between the elasticity of the hydration and staches as well as time to rest and the area to fissure density. The shaping provides a boundary layer of dryer starch that is even and uniform on the surface with only necessary time for the seam to be set as a continuous surface. That's all I got.

If you stirred it, however, it would start to splatter again for another minute, then simmer down again.\n\nNow, this never seemed to happen to my tomato pasta sauces.

The thing is I always cook them with either whole or chopped tomatoes, never with pureed tomatoes.

You do what you want or feel comfortable with. In the end your the one who eats the food right.", "\"Only cook with something you would drink\" is a rule for people who drink $5 wine. The quality of the wine really doesn't have as big of an impact as those people think. Is a cheap drinkable wine better than \"Cooking Wine?\" For most people, yeah. Mostly due to its salt content and inability to control seasoning then. The only time the quality of the wine would have an impact is if its making up a sizeable volume of the finished product, and even in that case, cooking it will remove a lot of what makes the wine better than others.  \n\nHowever, in your situation cooking wine might be perfect for you, because it is salted so quite really undrinkable, if having alcohol on hand would be a temptation. \n\nAlso, be aware that not all of the alcohol content cooks out of wine quickly. If you are using it to deglaze and you reduce it to almost nothing, you are probably good, but in larger quantities where it is not getting flash-evaporated, like say in a sauce or something, there might be enough alcohol left to be noticeable. I don't know how that would effect you personally - maybe have no impact at all, maybe make you crave that food as its sort of hitting that old craving unbeknownst to you, or maybe something worse. \n\nBasically, if the alcohol ignites or you can see it evaporate, it should be gone, but if its added to a liquid, then heat alone (simmering etc.) will likely not cook the alcohol entirely out the way many believe. \n\nAlso keep in mind the reason for adding alcohol is often for alcohol-soluble flavors. That is, it will bring out additional flavor in other ingredients, and the quality of the alcohol has limited bearing - it would the same if using straight vodka for example. Wine is a great combination of a fruity and acidic liquid plus the alcohol however.

It's time to fill that notable gap in our FAQ.\n\nWhere do you go to find recipes, advice, and specialty techniques? What are those resources' particular strengths?

I bake and cook a lot of vegan stuff. I generally just Google things to find out what I can use instead, but here is a rough guide to subbing ingredients, and other tips on vegan cooking.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'd like to say that there are few vegan ingredients that can entirely replace animal ingredients in cooking, especially with ingredients where you rely on the chemical properties as opposed to the flavour. Hence, there are different suggestions for different cooking/baking scenarios.\n\nAlso, this guide will be exclusively for vegan cooking.\n\n# EGGS\n\nEggs are important in non vegan cooking since they provide stabilising proteins and tasty tasty fat, and are also a versatile standalone ingredient. Often they are used to give stability to cakes and cookies, or thicken sauces. Unfortunately, there are very few vegan substitutes that can play the role of an egg in every dish that they are put in. For example, tofu used for scramble won't be suitable in a cake. There are several egg replacements that can be used for different purposes:\n\n* Tofu. This is often used for scramble, flavoured with black salt, but it can work in pad Thai or Singapore noodles too.\n* Flaxseed. Commonly used in baking as a binding agent.\n* Boxed egg replacements, such as Orgran or Bob's Red Mill varieties. Used as binding agents in baking or very rarely in meringues.\n* [Aquafaba](http://aquafaba.com/faq.html). Leftover juice of cooked legumes, used to make Royal icing and meringue.\n* Applesauce. Often used alongside flaxseed jn baking to provide moisture.\n* Agar. Used to replace eggs when doing a clarification for consomm\u00e9, or to make faux boiled eggs. A surprisingly useful ingredient for vegan chefs.\n* Black salt. Used for sulphurous flavour of eggs.\n\nThese are all the egg replacements I can think of. There are obviously more but these are the ones I have commonly used in my cooking.\n\n# DAIRY\n\nThis is a very vague category, so I will do. my best to split it up into sections.\n\n[The Non-Dairy Evolution Cookbook by Skye Michael Conroy](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Dairy-Evolution-Cookbook-Modernist-Plant-Based/dp/1499590423/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1547506923&sr=8-1&keywords=non+dairy+evolution+cookbook) is an excellent resource on veganising dairy products. I will refer to it as the NDE in this section.\n\n# MILK\n\nMilk is another versatile ingredient. It is used either as a beverage or ingredient, and often in the latter, recipes rely on the chemistry of milk. Cow's milk is mainly made of sugars, water, and protein. Plant milk replacements may vary in what they are made of, but the nutritional content of various plant milks can be found [here](https://1y2u3hx8yml32svgcf0087imj-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/UACF-Milk-Varieties-Chart.jpg) (image credits to myfitnesspal).\n\nFor things that rely on the caramelisation of milk sugars, you should use plant milks that are high in sugar. And so is the case for milks that are high in fat, etc.\n\nGenerally, I will use oat, soy, or cashew milk for most applications. To me, they are the creamiest varieties of plant milk and those 3 tend to cover all bases for my culinary applications. Coconut milk is also very good in desserts and Asian savoury dishes.\n\nYou can make your own vegan milks but the results are much less consistent when using them as ingredients than buying the milk from the shop. Oat milk is tricky to use as a cooking ingredient for example because it becomes slimy when heated.\n\n# CHEESE\n\nCheese is a controversial subject in the vegan or nearly-vegan community. Again, with cheese, lots of the things we love about the dairy variety rely on the chemistry of cheese. The stretchiness and coagulation come from casein, a structural protein found in cheese. The sharpness and flavours come from microorganisms eating the sugars in the milk. The browning when cheese is baked is due to the maillard reaction from the proteins and sugars in the cheese.\n\nSo you will want to emulate those properties using various ingredients in your cheese. Some of the properties can be found easily in store bought products, for example vegan Parmesan is usually satisfactory for its purpose.\n\nPizza is something I missed when I went vegan. You can make decent vegan mozzarella using [this recipe](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/melty-stretchy-gooey-vegan-mozarella/), or there is a recipe listed in the NDE that is suitable. On that note, the NDE has plenty of recipes that make delicious vegan cheese. \n\n# YOGURT\n\nYogurt can usually be used in the same way as dairy yogurt. Many commercial varieties now exist and have a similar tangy flavour to dairy yogurt. If you're into fermentation, you can make your own; there is a recipe to do so in the NDE or [here](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/yogurt/how-to-make-non-dairy-yogurt/). You can still use vegan yogurt to add moisture to cakes and breads!\n\n# CREAM\n\nCream can usually be bought in the shops, yet lots of people decide to [make their own out of cashews](https://www.rebootwithjoe.com/savory-or-sweet-cashew-cream/), which is tasty. The shop bought cream is usually single soya cream, so it is suitable for using in cooking but not as whipping cream, since it has a low fat content. To make vegan whipped cream I follow [this](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/09/dairy-free-food-whipping-whipped-cream) recipe. Be cautious that some shop-bought soya cream may have added sugar, which might not be suitable for the application you want to use it for.\n\n# BUTTER\n\nOf all these ingredients, vegan butter is the one I cherish the most. I live in the UK, and I'm loyal to the brands Vitalite and Stork. Butter is incredibly important in both cooking and baking, because it has some wonderful flavour compounds and is responsible in aiding the lovely maillard reaction that gives us delicious browning on our food. \n\nWhen using vegan butter, you must be cautious that some margarine often has a higher water content than butter, which we don't necessarily want all the time. You can tell if this is the case by checking the calorie content, or the fat content. My vitalite has 500\\~ calories and 50g fat per 100g, whereas my stork baking block has 600\\~ calories and about 75g fat per 100g. Butter generally has about 700 calories and 81g fat content. \n\nMargarines with a higher water content can be useful for creating cakes that are less stodgy and glazing vegetables without using too much fat, however they should be avoided when baking pastries and cookies/biscuits. High fat margarines are preferred for the tastiest pastries since a lot of the properties we love about pastry come from the fat content of pastry.\n\nAnother important aspect to consider about vegan butter is the flavour of the butter itself. I like to use vitalite if I want the butter flavour to really shine through, hence why I use it in savoury applications such as glazing vegetables. If your margarine tastes of nothing, your food will be a little lacklustre. \n\n# \n\n# ", "[Vegan Richa](https://www.veganricha.com/) is probably my favorite vegan chef.

", "Real live vegan here!\n\n/u/ayshketchum's advice is useful, especially for baking, but I think one of the main reasons people find it so hard to be vegetarian/vegan in the West, and one of the main reasons vegetarianism and veganism especially have such a bad reputation, especially among people who really care about cooking and cuisine, is that so much of the conversation functions around replacements, substitutes, and fake shit. Unless you lie to yourself or you have idiosyncratic tastes, fake eggs, yogurt, chicken, beef, and bacon is just not going to taste as good. Most of the time it barely even tastes similar, let alone good. So, someone who goes around looking to find the best fake bacon or whatever is generally not going to end up a very happy vegetarian/vegan, and the people they feed the fake bacon to for breakfast are going to think vegetarians/vegans are sad, deluded people who eat shitty food all day instead of delicious bacon.\n\n(Incidentally, I *don't* dislike fake stuff - my palate is very unsophisticated and I like everything. Even before I was a vegan I loved Boca burgers. But I'm much less discerning than even the average person.)\n\nSo, although I'm not *against* fake stuff (the longer I've been vegan, the more willing I've become to cook recipes with fake stuff, and when it comes to baking, I've pretty much always been willing to do it, because there it rarely matters) I do think it does a *huge* disservice to vegetarian and vegan cuisine when the conversation centers around replacements for stuff.\n\nWhat should the conversation center around, if not shitty tasting fake food? Well, food that's already vegetarian or vegan in the first place without having to use any faux ingredients!\n\nNow of course there are lots of foods like this: hummus, French fries, sourdough bread, falafel, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, etc. However, one issue with the common Western diet is that people think about meals as ways of dressing up meat. So, when it comes to full meals, even the *idea* of a vegetarian/vegan option strikes them as anomalous.\n\nThis means I think the best approach to vegetarian/vegan cuisine is learning how to think about food not in terms of replacing non-vegetarian/vegan recipes in the first place, but in thinking about meals in ways that aren't \"which dead animal should I eat for dinner today?\" This is a pretty big shift in thinking for a lot of people.\n\nThe way *I* accomplished this was by looking at cuisines around the world that aren't so meat-centric, and which thus have all sorts of naturally vegan dishes. A very good way to do *that* is to check out recipes. So, here are some of my favorite cookbooks/food blogs:\n\n[Thai Vegetarian Cooking](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517581671) (Thailand)\n\n[Real Vegetarian Thai](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Vegetarian-Thai-Nancie-McDermott/dp/0811811514) (Thailand)\n\n[Teff Love](https://www.amazon.com/Teff-Love-Adventures-Ethiopian-Cooking/dp/157067311X) (Ethiopia)\n\n[Kansha](http://www.amazon.com/Kansha-Celebrating-Japans-Vegetarian-Traditions/dp/1580089550) (Japan)\n\n[The Lotus and the Artichoke](http://www.lotusartichoke.com) (Malaysia and Sri Lanka are my two favorites, but also has India, Mexico, and Ethiopia)\n\n[Decolonize Your Diet](https://www.amazon.com/Decolonize-Your-Diet-Plant-Based-Mexican-American/dp/1551525925) (Mexico)\n\n[Tahini & Turmeric](https://www.amazon.com/Tahini-Turmeric-Eastern-Classics-Made-Irresistibly/dp/0738220108) (the Middle East)\n\nhttp://thegreekvegan.com (Greece)\n\nhttps://www.chinasichuanfood.com/topics/chinese-recipes/chinese-vegan-recipes/ (China, especially Sichuan)\n\nhttps://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-vegetarian-recipes/ (China)\n\nhttp://www.manjulaskitchen.com/recipes/vegan/ (India)\n\nhttps://www.vegrecipesofindia.com (India)\n\nhttps://georgianrecipes.net/category/vegetarian/ (Georgia)\n\nhttps://www.justonecookbook.com/tags/vegetarian/ (Japan)\n\nhttps://hot-thai-kitchen.com/category/all-recipes/meatless-recipes/ (Thailand)\n\nhttp://www.phamfatale.com/cat_25/tag_vegetarian/ (Vietnam)\n\nhttps://thevietvegan.com/recipes/vegan-recipes/ (Vietnam)\n\nAnd of course plenty of non vegetarian/vegan books from these cuisines and others have tons of vegegatarian/vegan recipes. Fuchsia Dunlop's *amazing* Chinese cookbooks, like Every Grain of Rice, have some of my favorite vegan recipes of all time. Mesfin's classic Exotic Ethiopian Cooking has lots of vegetarian/vegan stuff. Burma: Rivers of Flavor has a lot of great vegan food, and lots of food that is easily veganized if you use its recipe for soybean cakes to replace shrimp powder. And so on. Most Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines have a ton of vegetarian stuff. Most East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines have a lot of vegetarian and vegan stuff. Any cuisines that have religious traditions that avoid meat sometimes (or always) will have lots of vegetarian and vegan stuff.\n\nOnce you learn how to eat without replacing meat, vegetarianism/veganism gets *soooooooo* much cheaper, easier, healthier, and most importantly, it doesn't taste like shit, either for you or for the non-vegetarians/vegans to \n whom you feed your food.\n\nThis entire post so far is theory/hypothetical, so here are some of my favorite recipes to get you started:\n\nhttps://andrewzimmern.com/2013/03/28/fuchsia-dunlops-fish-fragrant-eggplant/\n\nhttp://500sandwiches.com/post/84432075201/bears-paw-tofu (obviously don't use Chicken stock)\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/the-food-lab-vegan-experience-best-homemade-falafel-recipe.html\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/israeli-style-extra-smooth-hummus-recipe.html\n\nhttps://smittenkitchen.com/2009/03/pita-bread/\n\nhttps://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/samosa-recipe-punjabi-samosa/\n\nhttps://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/lemon-rice/\n\n", "My entire vegan arsenal comes from [Minimalist Baker](https://minimalistbaker.com/) (my favorite resource tbh - she has a ton of simple, tasty recipes as well as tips on perfecting specific techniques), [Love and Lemons](https://www.loveandlemons.com/), and [Simple Veganista](https://simple-veganista.com/)!

So chefs working on gas ranges might say to use high heat, but if you are on electric, then it will probably be lower, maybe even significantly lower. The kind and size of pan you are using affects heat distribution and retention, how long you heat the pan for, what fat you are using (if any), how much of it, and how long it heated up for. The size of your burners does too. So does whatever you are cooking.\n\nIf possible, I highly recommend turning/flipping your food pretty frequently when working with high heat. It allows you to better monitor the progression of the food and then adjust the temperature as needed. Contrary to popular belief, this does not interfere with the formation of a sear/crust.", "Not all stoves are created equally.  If you are aiming for med/high and set your stove to 7, and it is burning your food, then turn it down.", "I go by temperature, not whatever number scale my stove / plate / range has. \n\nLow is 200 F / ~90 c and under. Aka under boiling\n\nMedium is 300 F / 150 c.\n\nHigh is 400 F / 205 c and above. Approaching the smoke points of common non-olive oils.", "Honestly, stop guessing and just buy a hand-held IR thermometer.\n\nIt costs about 20 bucks, but I became a MUCH better cook once I started just measuring temps (steaks stopped being a hit-or-miss affair, frying things suddenly worked, I stopped burning things).\n\nYou can see a sample of what I'm talking about here: [https://www.amazon.com/Infrared-Thermometers/b?ie=UTF8&node=9931459011](https://www.amazon.com/Infrared-Thermometers/b?ie=UTF8&node=9931459011)\n\nThey are basically instant (measures temps in about a second) and extremely easy to use.  Plus it works on the grill and the stove and you can check the oven with it.\n\nMedium high is \\~400 degrees (little lower or higher depending on the oil you're using, and what you're cooking, but basically always above 375, and usually below 450 - if you can keep the temp between those numbers, you're usually good).\n\nThe problem is that unless you have \\*really\\* dialed in your stove/pan for your specific recipe - just leaving the knob in the same spot is going to either stay too cold, or get too hot.  It sounds like your stove is getting too hot (I made this mistake for a long time).  You need to turn down the heat as the food comes up to temp.", " So I just watched his video, did you fill the pan like he did? If your pan wasn\u2019t as full then it makes sense yours burned.

It'd be fine if 9 on this burner was Extremely Effing Hot, and 8 was High and all the other numbers were adjusted accordingly. But oh, no. Frigidaire decided to scale all the other numbers up on the dial, so 8 is Slight Less Than Extremely Effing Hot, and so on down the line.

They burn the fuck out of their food right there on camera and call it perfect... Same people love to use metal utensils ruthlessly in their non-stick pans...

Should I just stick to Manhattens, Old Pals, and Boston Ward 8's (can I even batch Boston sours?)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess I might as well ask what I should pair with each course with my very uninformed menu (can't talk to the caterer until she immerses, am trying to work the sides I like the idea of where I can, and the spreads will probably way down to account for the limited guestlist so nobody pops):  \n\n1. Tisch: dairy appetizers. Fish chowder tarts (or in muffin-tin bread bowls, bluefish pate, pickled turnips and beets, herring eight million ways, maybe whitefish, cheese blintzes, jonnycakes playing the role of blini.\n2. Fish course: Catch of the day, probably scrod or sauteed smelts (edit: or was it sprats?) given the season (although , haMotzi bread (anadama? thirded?), Texas-style (equal parts mustard, vinegar, mayo) root-cellar slaw or winter veg latkes or sauteed winter greens? \n3. Soup: strong consomme made from mushroom, cider, and smoked whitefish frame (I've noticed they remove a lot of them at parties, maying them an easy resource, but they'd also work for the chowder and he may not have so many given the short notice and reduced party frequency) with brunoised seasonal vegetables and maybe a slice of fish quenelle (gefilte fish)\n4. Intervening course 1: Ladies' cabbage\n5. Entree: Beef tartare? cepelinai (using potato, chestnut, salsify mix?) with harvard beets or baked beans?\n6. Intervening course 2: maybe one of the rejected sides, like Harvard beets? fruit soup? Can lemon snow be kosher? Ptcha?\n7. Bird/game/whatever: (Maple glazed?) goose w/ potato, chestnut, and cranberry stuffing, root vegetables roasted with their greens (and maybe cider? there's usually liquid down there, right?) underneath, and dripping gravy. I also want helzl (stuffed neck) and greben (stuffed skin) in the meal at some point, but I think more than one starch per course is overdoing things. Maybe they can be the royale in the consomme if there are no fish frames.\n8. Intervening course 3: sorbet? potato/chestnut/salsify/parsnip kugel? Harvard beets? some sort of winter salad?\n9. Roast: Muttom/lamb (or goat if I can source it, which I can't) a la New England boiled dinner or yankee pot roast. I think the vegetables they're cooked with will be enough, but this might be a good place for baked beans or potato et all kugel? Cranberry sauerkraut (maybe that'll be one more thing sitting on the table for the full meal)?\n10. Intervening 4: fuck it, I'm pouring Moxie over some snow. Most of these palate cleansers are probably getting cut anyway, even if they're a good dumping spot for extra side and veg ideas. That winter salad idea's still nice.\n11. Cold dish: Chopped liver on a little square of something or other, maybe rye and injun. Will I flip this with the beef tartare (which I wanted to squeeze in somewhere)? Probably, as keeping that raw in the dumpling seems unlikely. Will I push this back to make it a British-style savoury? Maybe. Will the caterer be calling me an idiot by this point? Definitely.\n12. Sweets: I'm split between a cider doughnut and teiglach croquembouche and a flodni-filling babka (using white poppy seeds, made in a crown shape as they do in Israel). Maybe I could go with an old-fashioned white fruitcake instead, but I've never actually had fruitcake before and think my bride and I would dislike it. As pastries seem kind of unfinished without something on the side of garnishing and it's a favorite, I may try to get Indian pudding on the plate as well.\n13. Dessert:  Kisielius garnished with (dried fruit) compote.\n14.

Prolonged exposed to heat, or a combination of heat and pressure for example relies on doing so energetically by overloading the tissues so that they are no longer able to hold together in the same manner. These methods have the benefit of also dealing with the risks associated with consuming the meat raw.

The main alternative is to apply a mildly corrosive substance like baking powder briefly , ensure you rinse it off and then boil, bake or fry it.

Sometimes I repost [this comment I left](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/2l2tiq/browning_ground_beef_maximizing_maillard/).. wow apparently 8 years ago:\n\n> There is an important lesson here about heat management.\n> \n> When you're browning meat, you're essentially trying to sear a combination of meat, fat, and water. Water boils at 212F, and there's a fair bit of energy required to push water at 212F into water *vapor* at 212F. Maillard reactions (and other browning reactions) generally don't start until north of 275F.\n> \n> *This means that as long as water is present in the pan, the temperature cannot pass 212F and browning cannot happen*. If water is in the pan for a significant period of time, you end up boiling/steaming your meat instead of browning it.\n> \n> You can counteract this a number of ways:\n> \n> 1. A really really hot pan. A sufficiently hot pan (and powerful stove) can boil off a fair bit of water fast enough that the moisture present doesn't matter. For, say, a pound of ground beef, this is just not feasible on a residential stove top. This is why people love super heavy pans like cast iron - they hang onto so much heat that their temperature doesn't drop as much as other pans when you drop a slab of meat into it.\n> 2. Cook in batches/don't crowd the pan. By reducing the amount of water that your stove has to deal with at a given time, a regular stove can cook off the water fast enough to sufficiently brown the meat. If a pan is too crowded you might not be giving water vapors a clear path to escape and they can condense again on the neighboring cold meat.\n> 3. Remove excess moisture before cooking. When I cook a steak or chicken breast I'll thoroughly pat the surface dry with a paper towel before seasoning. Every bit of water you remove is water that your stove doesn't have to cook off. For things where I really want a great crust (prime rib, chicken wings) I'll even leave it uncovered on a rack in the fridge overnight, or point a fan at them for a bit on the counter.", "For my bolognese I actually add water to help break apart clumps then cook while mixing untill it is all grey and no pink then I leave it alone in a thin even layer. I let all the moisture boil off and still leave it until I hear sizzling and popping like a steak and a very good fond is achieved. \n\nThe fond brings flavour elements. Think a grey steak vs one with a seared brown crust. They taste different. Same principle just in many small pieces.", "Not a silly question at all!\n\nWhen you brown beef, the intention is to get some colour and a crusty layer on your pan which you then deglaze with liquid.\n\nCook it on a medium heat, stirring often, until it's dry and crumbly, and there's a light brown crust (fond) on the pan. This gives an amazing amount of flavour to your dish. (There are other methods but this is the most common)", "One tip I saw in Cook's Illustrated is to add a bit of baking soda to the ground beef and mix it in before adding to the pan.", "I agree that it's totally preference. My preferred technique for browning ground beef is to start with half of the total and let it cook through from pink to grey to brown (i.e. all the way browned) then add the other half and cook that one until not-pink. Gives a nice mix of crispy bits and not-dry bits.", "Cook it until the water cooks out then you will hear the sizzle of it cooking in it's own fat, that's the browning.", "Cook until not raw anymore. I personally have a difficult time achieving any kind of sear on ground beef. I\u2019ve heard that you can spread it out and let it sit on the heat undisturbed, but it didn\u2019t work for me and it didn\u2019t matter to the recipe.", "My current technique is place the ground beef on a cutting board. Using a knife, press the knife into the chuck across the grain (but not all the way through) every few millimeters, then repeat going with the grain. Do this until the chuck is flat (should kinda look like a small piece of bubble wrap with a flat side on bottom and textured side on top). Place said chuck in a hot, lightly greased pan, flat side down. Sear for 2-3min then start aggressively breaking up the chuck with a spatula as it continues to cook. Once the pink is almost completely gone, lower or remove from heat and continue with the recipe. \n\nI use this primarily for tacos or meat sauces.", "Buddy do I have a tip for you! Add 1/4 tsp of baking soda per lb of ground meat. Mix well, let sit 15 min, then cook in pan. You will have beautifully browned results.", "You're never going to sear crumbled ground beef. If you've for.ed it into a patty or ball etc. it may call for searing but ground beef that's just going to get crumbled up, browning means cooking until no longer raw.", "bround beef", "cook till not raw, as others have stated here.\n\none suggestion not mentioned; if the recipe's then calling for spices and liquid to be added. add the spices first and go for a bit of a sear. mixing a lot, quickly, over fairly high heat. *then* add the liquid.", "When the beef turns brown, you're done.  I can also help you understand when water is boiling if you need the help.", "I am most familiar with people Browning meat Browning meat that is going to then go into a stew or something that's going to cook for a while\n\nSo I'm seeing it on a really hot Pan and then I'm not continuing to cook it because it's gonna continue to cook inside whatever it is I'm making", "You don't have to add oil to ground beef.

There was very little  discernible taste difference in the end product, but the _just  cooked_ version was much more tender.  I used to get it nice dark brown for sloppy Joes, but no more - the \"maillarded\" flavor just gets lost in the (not too) sweet and tangy sauce, which gets its umami from tomato paste and Worcestershire. \n\nTry mixing in  1/2 tsp. baking soda dissolved in 1 Tbsp water per pound of ground, for extra tender ground beef, (or pork!

I\u2019ve tried saut\u00e9ing the onions and garlic taking them out, then searing the ground meat. Maybe I\u2019ve been so conditioned \u2026 I can\u2019t tell the difference in the taste (yes have noticed the texture/crispy parts of meat) . I also feel like I am dirtying more dishes and adding unnecessary steps.", "Sometimes you don't want that browned flavor (e.g. you don't always want to brown your onions) so it just depends on what you're going for.\n\nI can't think of an application where the ground beef would not taste better seared (when cooked separately)", "I think most mean until it is not pink anymore but I have never really noticed a huge difference.\n\nI did see cooking video that added a 1tsp of baking soda on ground beef. It supposedly pulls the water out? Not quite sure what is officially happening but it does make the ground beef crispier. I like it bc I am impatient and that speeds up the process.", "it probably means to sear it. i think a lot of people do use it to mean cooking it thru though, because it takes on a brownish color. i don't know though, i'm not really an expert, and honestly, i've only been cooking in a serious way for like a year. i wouldn't be the first person to know, i can only answer my opinion."]}

So you give it a half spin so the side that was on the right is now on the left, and the front is facing the back. This helps to combat uneven cooking, because it's pretty common for ovens to have hot spots. It's less common if you have a convection oven (oven with a fan that circulates the air), but it can still happen, so I personally will rotate almost anything in an oven at least 1 or 2 times throughout the cooking process, or once per hour on longer cooks.

Also you could add a tiny bit of soy sauce or tamari, and a couple drops of worcestershire sauce. Also, if your burgers ever come out a bit dry, but the flavor is what you want, the next time just buy a little fatties beef, or try adding in a little bit of ground beef fat, or you can even add in some ground pork.

The outermost surfaces (maybe 1mm?) will take on some flavor.

I always assumed the meat absorbed the marinade, I stand corrected. I think my biggest concern is salt. Like in my original example, if the 2 lbs would become too salty in a marinade made for 5 lbs.

Am I supposed to keep adding more flour every time it sticks? Or should I just work through it even if it\u2019s sticky?\n\nThis is a super common trap. Avoid adding more flour until you really know what you're doing. Until then, use a scale to weigh each ingredient. What you want to do is mix the dough until it just comes together, cover it, then walk away for 15 minutes. This will allow time for the flour to hydrate and when you come back, it will be significantly easier to work with. This is called \"autolyse\". \n\n> After kneading, my dough isn\u2019t very sticky anymore (probably because I keep dusting it with flour). Should properly kneaded dough still be a little sticky at the end?\n\nIf you're adding more flour as you go, you are definitely changing your hydration percentage. Something you have to consider. And all of that flour you're adding won't be hydrating at the same rate, so that's probably why it's still a little sticky. \n\n> After fermenting in the fridge, the dough doesn\u2019t feel very stretchy.

Are there beginner-friendly shaping methods I should try?\n\nNo matter what, it does take practice. [This is the method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtAeKM_f2WU) that I finally settled on and recommend to others. When I first got started, I kept the video in front of me and would do each step at a time, then rewind the video when needed. Don't be afraid to work slowly and deliberately. Speed will come with time. And also note that he is using very large balls of dough. It's actually easier with larger dough balls. I make 16\" pizzas and it works pretty well. I start with about 400g of flour and use ~60% hydration to get to 16\".\n\nHere's a calculator to get you started\n\nhttps://burner.com/pizza/calc/\n\nHere's more info on the thickness factor\n\nhttps://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=12243.msg115759#msg115759\n\nhttps://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php/topic,40354.msg402402.html#msg402402\n\nHere are a couple of my pizzas just so you know I'm not full of shit lol\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4s4KLOJ\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3gPwhUc", "For one, start with weight measurements\u2014that should give you more consistent results. Digital kitchen scales for home use in this day and age are affordable and reasonably accurate.\n\nSecondly, get a dough scraper. As a professional, I like matfer nylon scrapers, but I\u2019ll use the free ones you get from the pastry supplier (ice cap in my area). As a home cook, I still prefer matfer, but an Amazon special would work okay. Use it to scrape your bowl, your hands, your work surface, etc. The only thing it can\u2019t scrape are the sins from your soul.\n\nThirdly, if your dough is rough/sticky\u2026let it sit. Scrape your hands clean, cover it, and walk away for half an hour or so to let the water hydrate the flour. It\u2019ll still look the same when you come back, but it\u2019ll be a lot more cooperative when you do start kneading again. The last thing you want to do is add more flour. If anything, you want to add as little flour as possible when kneading.\n\nAnswering your questions directly, you have a good eye! White dough means you have overkneaded it. The oxygen in the air that you incorporated during the kneading process has literally bleached your dough and will cause it to rise too quickly due to the fully-developed gluten, leading to a loss of the aromatic alcohols and natural acids produced with a good, long fermentation.\n\nAs for the stickiness, I think I already answered that, but if it\u2019s too sticky to work with, let it sit. Don\u2019t power through by adding flour. If you really want to, then don\u2019t add flour, but rather change your mixing technique. I remember passage en tete (bisecting dough in half with fingers and placing one blob on top of the other, then repeating) and soufflage (slapping the dough onto the work surface, stretching it, and folding it over itself and repeating) And yes, it should be a little tacky at the end but not a mess.\n\nDough has two qualities: elasticity and extensibility. Elasticity is the tendency to spring back when pulled (like an elastic band), and extensibility is the dough\u2019s ability to stretch without breaking. It\u2019s been a long time since school, but my gut instinct says it\u2019s due to overkneading. The dough has risen, fallen, and the yeast has started eating the gluten leading to a degradation in the structure. To increase extensibility, try a liquid preferment (poolish), lower temperature of water (I could get into the Desired Dough Temperature Method, but I won\u2019t bother for a beginner; just know that warm water is for making things rise faster, and you want to allow the dough time to ferment and develop flavour and shelf life), and the autolyse method (or just letting the damn thing sit after ingredient incorporation).\n\nAs for the last one, practice, practice, practice. If you have any other questions, let me know.", "My biggest tip is to get a kitchen scale and start measuring your ingredients by weight instead of volume. \u201c5 cups\u201d is a very inexact amount of flour. Depending on how you scoop it you could be off by as much as 50%.\u00a0", "Don't keep adding flour stick to the recipe. Yes it should be smooth, the gluten hasn't formed fully, it's not being kneaded long enough. Google or YouTube \"window pane test\".  Keep at it, and you will get it. Don't listen to the 5-7 minutes kneading, listen to the dough it will tell you when it's ready, people knead differently what may take them 7 minutes might take you 10. The bakers window pane test will let you listen to the dough.", "A few things are going on here that I'd note. This sounds like it's Adam Ragusea's recipe, which is... Not great. \n\n1. measure by weight, not by volume. Flour compacts quite a bit and your dough will be inconsistent.\n\n2. Converted to weight (236g water per cup, 120g flour per cup) this is almost 90% hydration (i.e., you're adding water equivalent to 90% of the weight of flour) dough. I'd expect it to be very slack and loose. Typical NYC doughs are in the ballpark of 60%. \n\n3. A dough that wet sounds like an absolute nightmare to knead by hand. For doughs that wet you pretty much have to do the \"stretch and fold\" technique. \n\n4. If the dough doesn't stretch well, that means gluten hasn't developed well. This might be some of your issues with shaping as well. Some of your issue shaping is that you're new at it.\n\n5. Round pizza requires round dough balls. \n\nAnyway,  this is a roughly typical NYC style recipe, not identical to what I use but close. \n\n100% bread flour (let's go with 600g since that's what you've been using with 5 cups of flour)\n\n60% hydration (360g, about 1.5 cups- water can be measured by volume since it's about 1g per ml)\n\n2% salt (12 g - this is to taste, if you find you want the dough more seasoned try 2.5-3% but keep in mind this will impact fermentation as salt inhibits yeast)\n\n2% sugar (12g - sugar helps fermentation as well as browning and keep the crumb softer)\n\n2% oil (again, helps browning, and softens the texture)\n\n0.2% instant yeast (1.2g - don't be too precious about this, anywhere from 1-2 grams is fine. If you're using active dry, double it.)\n\nMix all dry ingredients except for the yeast and sugar (if using active dry yeast) together. If using instant yeast, combine all dry ingredients.\n\n If using active dry, proof the yeast in the water with the sugar (add together and wait til the yeast rises to the surface).\n\nAdd water (or yeast mixture) and oil to dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms. \n\nTurn out onto a work surface and knead until the dough is a smooth ball and passes the windowpane test, about 10 minutes.\n\nPut the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until not quite doubled in size - 1-3 hours depending on room and dough temperature. \n\nDivide the dough into equivalent portions (12\" pizza should use about 240g, 14\" about 300g), form into a ball by folding the dough over onto itself. \n\nPlace on an oiled baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and let proof in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours but up to 3 days. \n\nRemove dough from the refrigerator at least 2 hours before you want to use it.", "Buy the book \u201eThe Elements of Pizza\u201c by Ken Forkish. A friend sent me the  24h-48h dough recipe and from the beginning I had a decent dough, but I should have immediately bought the book instead of waiting a year and a half, because all the background info and little tricks are well explained. If you\u2019re going for a traditional Neapolitan pizza, then the dough is really just water, salt, a small amount of dried yeast (like 3/8 tsp with 500g flour) and 00 flour. My first pizzas were decent, but doing it regularly helped ensure I get an excellent pizza every time.", "R/pizza will have the guidance you seek.", "Your dough is sticky because the hydration level is too high. 600 grams of AP flour and ~530ml of water (rough conversion from dumb US measurements to metric) puts you at ~88% (530 / 600). Even for a Detroit or Sicilian style pizza I'd expect 80%, and for Neapolitan closer to 65 or 70.\n\nYour dough should be smooth and elastic after kneading. If it isn't, you're not done kneading. The dough balls themselves might be a bit rough depending on your shaping method \u2013 that just needs practice but it's not a big deal.\n\nDough color will reflect the color of the ingredients; fermentation won't change it. Don't sweat this.\n\nYou don't say what you're doing to form the pizza crust, but generally I start by patting the ball into a disc, flattening the center, and then gently pulling the edge along its circumference to stretch a bit. When the circle is wide enough to get both hands underneath, I drape it across the backs of my hands and use my knuckles to pull gently apart, then toss the dough and twist it counterclockwise, and repeat. You can also just put it on a round pan and pull the edges of the dough up to the edges of the pan.", "Knead it longer.  Knead it for at least 5 minutes longer than you did.  At that point you\u2019ll be 20% done kneading. Were you sweating, breathing heavy, and were your shoulders burning?  If not, you didn\u2019t knead it long enough.  If so, you still didn\u2019t knead it long enough.  Start a 30 minute timer next time, and then when it\u2019s done if the dough looks lumpy do another 15.\n\nOtherwise you probably made a few mistakes, or used less than best practices.  Mix your water yeast sugar salt etc.  add half your flour and mix.  Let it sit 15 minutes.  Add the rest of the flour, mix, start kneading.  5 min into kneading, add a bit of oil, like a tablespoon of it.  Knead more.  Knead more again.  Add another tablespoon of oil.  Knead.  Knead.  Knead.  Add last of oil.  Knead knead knead.  At this point if it\u2019s sticky you can dust with flour but probably better to grease your surfaces with oil.  Knead until shiny and SMOOTH.  This will take a good amount of work.  Make your balls, oil them, wrap them, stash in fridge until ready to use.\n\nWhen making pizza, have a BIG bowl of flour, like a 10 inch bowl and 3-4 cups of flour.  Dust your table, take the dough ball and put it directly into the bowl of flour, flip and dunk the other side.  Now you can dimple the dough, form a crust, dimple and stretch.  When you\u2019re mostly stretched move the dough to your (well floured) wooden pizza peel.  Stretch into shape by pulling gently at the crust, then add sauce and cheese, and move to your pizza oven.", "It sounds like gluten development is lacking.  Use bread flour or a mix of AP and brwad flour, and knead more.\n\nDon't use cheap, shitty flour. Go for King Arthur if it's available.\n\nAs far as the degree of stickiness, you want it sticky but not too sticky, which takes a little practice.\n\n\"Chris Bianco's pizza dough recipe\" is on the Google and sounds close to yours.\n\nThe dough should definitely be smooth and elastic.\n\nWhen you form the pie, push it out along the edges so you don't tear a hole in the middle.\n\nI recently started using a couple of 14 inch pizza screens with a Lodge 16 inch cast iron \"steel\n\nThe screen makes it much easier to deal with the pie, and I like it directly onto the steel about halfway through.", "Lots of good advice in this thread. We make pizza weekly, dough once a month. First tip, get a scale, best way for baking. It saves you measuring ingredients and portioning dough accurately. Second patience and practice. Patience is making sure the dough rests, don't be in a rush, making sure after the dough needs to be room temp for optimum shaping. That's about 11/2- 2 hours prior to baking. Practice is everything, but shaping the dough especially. Don't knead in this stage, it will tighten the dough. Don't stress on the the circle, work towards it. My family took about a month or two to get it down. So about 8-10 tries. They don't always come out perfect circles but they taste great no matter they shape.", "My absolute gamechanger for pizza dough is when it's sticky - put olive oil on your hands, DON'T ADD MORE FLOUR! Try it!", "Bread dough is a living thing. You might need more water / less water depending on the day. Practice makes perfect! The dough should be kneaded 4-6 minutes to develop sufficient gluten structure. Don\u2019t add too much flour, give it time to absorb as you knead. After you divide into balls, let rest at least 1-2 hours before you try and shape - in the fridge if it\u2019s warm. Work the dough out slowly to avoid holes. 1 pound of dough generally yields a 14-15 inch pizza.", "The fridge is your mistake. Making it fresh before hand.

I only eat wild caught, and that's rare to see in stores and much more expensive. It's usually no longer an option, because very few people are allowed to fish for them.\n\nI live in Norway, and we export about 50% of all salmon worldwide. On average, 15% of every fish in our fish farms die in the farm, with disease being the main cause and injuries also being common. We get news reports a few times every year that these fish (that are unfit for human consumption) still end up going to consumers, and it's been documented that they've been sold as \"premium\" fish with a high price tag. Both the Norwegian Food Authority and the police's section for economic and environmental crimes regularly sanction salmon companies for dangerous practices. \n\nFish farming can be done in many ways, but the absolutely cheapest (and pretty much exclusively used) method is basically just a huge net floating in the ocean, filled with about 200 000 fish. This method has a huge environmental impact, when both feed and waste from the farm sinks beneath the farm and is caught by currents. This pretty much kills the local wildlife in the area because (1) the seabed gets covered in waste, (2) high concentration of waste can lead to oxygen-poor areas where the water becomes poisonous to local species, (3) fish farms become hotspots for salmon lice that go on to affect wild salmon and threaten their existence, and (4) tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of farm-salmon escape every year which reduces the food supply available to wild fish.\n\nThe result is that normal fishing for wild salmon is banned in many regions most years. (Wild salmon was classified as an endangered species in Norway for the first time in 2021, with the rise in fish farming as a major cause.)\n\nYou should also be aware that only wild salmon has that iconic redish/pinkish colour in their meat. Salmon from farms are getting increasingly more pale in their colour,  but this is being \"compensated\" for by adding chemicals to their food. They even use different amounts of these chemicals, depending on what country the salmon will be sold to - different countries want different coloured salmon. The meat from farmed salmon also differs from wild salmon in taste, the amount of fat, the distribution of fat, and farmed salmon is significantly more slimey. Basically, the meat is worse in every way imaginable.\n\nThe combination of disgusting production practices and huge environmental impact is enough for me and many other Norwegians to boycott salmon until we get stricter regulations. The problem is that we produce so much salmon nowadays that the Norwegian market makes an almost insignificant impact on these companies, so we need people elsewhere to be aware of the problem and take action.", "I look at the texture to see if it's been properly handled and stored.

This will happen to your steak. There's nothing magical in the words \"dry brine\" that make the curing process not happen.\n\nIn any case, try it and find out. It will still be fine (if a bit salty, depending on how much salt you used) and you will learn something through the process.", "Why would it get oversalty? Once you've begun the dry brine, after a few hours the salt has already made it's way into the meat. Whether you cook it the next day or a couple days after, the same amount of salt will be in the meat. It'll be fine.", "I tried dry brining a 2-inch ribeye for 48 hours once. The crust was amazing, but the interior started to feel a bit dry. I think 24 hours is the sweet spot for me. Longer than that, and it starts to lose that juicy tenderness.\u200b", "For lack of a better term, it'll be kinda hammy, because you're essentially, very lightly curing it... It'll still taste good, but I personally am not a huge fan of the texture."]}

{"title": "I have a few questions about oil-based food coloring (meant primarily for chocolate)", "selftext": "I recently acquired some food coloring, both water-based gel and some (soybean) oil-based coloring.\n\nWith the increased price of the coloring, on top of water-based gels being more appropriate for most recipes I can think of, I don't see myself using them when I have cheaper and more-appropriate dyes.\n\nBut considering that I will only be making so much chocolate, let alone colored chocolate, and the shelf life of the dyes is 2 years (according to the label), I am curious as to how I might be able to use it if I have more than needed for its primary use, as well as some of the properties of its ingredients.\n\n## Description of Oil-Based Food Coloring\n\nThe ingredient list of each of the non-white dyes, excluding the pigments themselves, is **soybean oil**, **CAFAG**, and **phospholipids** (which I am guessing act as emulsifiers). \n\nThe white dye has some different ingredients (soybean oil, sorbitol, maltose syrup, propylene glycol, CMC-Na, and potassium sorbate), which I imagine is mostly due to the nature of its pigment, titanium dioxide.\n\nThe manufacturer lists chocolate as its main use, but also suggests they can be used for icing, frosting, buttercream, fondant, and some other applications.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. **(a)** Would I be able to mix them into a mostly-fat wet ingredient (like melted butter or egg yolks), and then mix that into a mixture with higher water content? **(b)** Would I need an emulsifier, and if so, would the lecithin in egg yolk be sufficient?\n\n2. What does CAFAG stand for, and what does it do? The best guess I have is \"caffeic acid\", but I haven't found anything definitive.\n\n3. Given its different ingredients, how would I expect the white dye to behave differently than the other ones?\n\n4. Is the shelf-life an issue of being \"fresh\", or the pigments falling out of solution?\n\n5. For a mostly-water based liquid, would adding an emulsifier like soy lecithin allow it to be used? I probably wouldn't do this if I had water-based available, but I am curious if the coloring would work as expected.\n\nI could test 1, 3, and 5 out myself, although I figured it would be worthwhile asking here first.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1k38vy2/i_have_a_few_questions_about_oilbased_food/", "created_utc": 1745104186.0, "score": 1, "author": "ImposterWizard", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1k38vy2/i_have_a_few_questions_about_oilbased_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["You might be better off in the pro subs like r/chefit or r/kitchenconfidential- or even r/foodscience- or a chocolate focused sub.

Do not drain or wash the pasta.\n* In another pot or wide frying pan add whatever sauce that you need into that pot/pan and transfer the mostly cooked pasta directly into that pot (along with any water that comes with it). If the sauce still looks a bit thick, add some extra pasta water and then cook it down until the pasta is fully cooked.\n\nThe mostly cooked pasta absorbs some of the sauce, flavouring it and thickening it. The starch from the pasta water also helps to thicken the sauce and allow it to better stick to the pasta.\n\nYou can see a demonstration of what this last step looks like in the following video:\n\n[https://youtu.be/\\_qy6HNqxhKU?si=KUSM6HRcHMYx-dQQ&t=216](https://youtu.be/_qy6HNqxhKU?si=KUSM6HRcHMYx-dQQ&t=216)\n\nAlso one thing that isn't really said in a lot of these videos is that you need a fair amount of starch in the pasta water. It's not a problem in a restaurant where you're using the same water to cook a lot of pasta. However, at home you might be using a relatively large pot to cook a modest amount of pasta, so you're not going to get anywhere near enough starch from the pasta water.\n\nThe rough pasta I mentioned earlier will help add more starch to the water but it's usually just easier to just use barely enough water than you need to cook the pasta.

Besides, as the French say, \"When in doubt, add butter!\")  \n\\- Heat the butter until it starts to brown. (This step imparts a nuttiness from the caramelized milk-solids.)  \n\\-Add red sauce (You'll be adding pasta to the pan later, so you want enough sauce to balance with that pasta. Too much sauce is better than too little. You'll be reducing the sauce's volume.)  \n\\- Mix the butter and red sauce. Simmer and reduce. (Allow the sauce to rest for a little while in the pan. Don't keep moving it around. You want it to caramelize. Stir it occasionally so it doesn't burn.)    \n\\- Eliminate enough water so that the solids in the sauce start to emerge from the liquid.  \n\\- Add reserved pasta water to reconstitute the sauce. (The pasta water adds starch, thickening the sauce, and improving mouthfeel.)  \n\\-Add cooked pasta to pan. Combine thoroughly. (Add enough pasta to fit the amount of sauce you have in the pan. Distribute the sauce evenly into the pasta. The mixture should be moist. The pasta will absorb some liquid. You can always add more sauce or pasta if it looks like it needs it.

Do not let the dough go to the sticky stage.\n\n\nNote:  One way to make sure you don't use too much water is to make a well in the middle of your dry ingredients and add about half the water.  Lightly toss that mixture together using your fingertips starting on the outside and covering the water with masa.  Keep tossing the water/masa together lightly with your fingertips until clumps start to form.\n\n\nGather the clumps together.  Just gather whatever sticks together.  Don't try to make the dry masa incorporate into the clumps.  Make a big clump and take that out of the bowl.  Repeat this process with the remaining dry ingredients and water until that, too, forms clumps.\n\n\nNow you can knead the clumps together to form your ball of dough.  If it still feels too dry, as in not everything is sticking together, dip your fingers in the water and sprinkle drops of water onto your dough and knead some more.  It's really important to not use too much water.\n\n\nOnce all the dough is made into a ball, cover it and let it sit for a half hour.  This allows all the masa to absorb water.  Knead a few more times (this is just to make sure everything is mixed) and measure out enough dough for one tortilla.  I use 40g for each tortilla.\n\n\nFlatten each dough ball using a tortilla press or rolling pin.  Get them as thin as you possibly can.\n\n\nCook each tortilla on a hot, dry pan.  I do 30 seconds per side.  I cook the first side, flip it, let it cook for a few seconds and then I press down HARD on the tortilla with a spatula.  Ideally, the tortilla should puff up with air in the middle, then sink back down.  My tortillas actually squeak when I press them with the spatula.  I use a metal spatula because you can't press hard enough with a plastic one.

{"title": "Why does my butter-and-yolk-based sauce de-emulsify?", "selftext": "When I make a sauce such as mayo, bearnaise or hollandaise based on egg yolks and butter, it either fails to hold together or it works when fresh but turns into a puddle when fridged and re-heated. If I instead use egg yolks and oil, the sauce is fine even after re-heating. Lard seems to have the same result as butter.\n\nHere's the Hollandaise I fucked up last night: 2 yolks, 3 tbsp water, half a lemon for zest+juice, mix until creamy, add 300g browned butter slowly during constant mixing, then add salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper. You know how after you brown butter, there's some sweet, delicious, sugar-like stuff at the bottom? I had added all the butter and decided to add that bottom stuff as well, mixed, and suddenly the sauce was watery instead of thick and creamy. Soon the sauce looked completely de-emulsified.\n\nI don't know if the addition of that solid bottom stuff somehow disturbed the emulsion, or if the mixture was already unstable for some reason and had to de-emulsify as soon as the mixing stopped, or if I hadn't noticed the sauce becoming more watery over time. Does browning butter (or over-browning as I think I did) make emulsification more difficult? Is the ratio of egg to butter too low? I previously made bearnaise with 2 yolks and 175g butter, and it was good when fresh but not when re-heated.

Butter is a saturated fat and when it is solid those are actually fat crystals.  All fat solidifies into crystals but saturated fats tend to do that around what we call room temperature.  So what is happening is that when your emulsification cools down, the fats break from their emulsification because the bonds with the other fats are more preferable.  You can try to interfere with that by chemical means (gums, starches, etc) or maybe mechanical means (blender) but it is still unlikely it be able to be reheated if it doesn't ruin the texture.  \n\nMy advice to fix this would be either smaller batches or use your broken sauce as the new \"butter\" and restart your process with one egg yolk.  Check out Alton Browns hollandaise video if you have anymore questions, he can explain it in a much more fun and visual way if you want.", "You can't reheat it but before you put it in the fridge, you can mix in more water this will keep the sauce from seizing in the fridge.

As a sanity check, without the mayo you can hold a sauce like that warm for about 1 to 1.5 hours and with the mayo you can make it 3-4 tops.

When the steam escaping sounds quite violent but I wouldn't really describe it as a whistle (more like toddler me trying to whistle but not managing it), does that count?\n\nAnd lastly, if steam is able to escape through the little security nob, everything should be fine right? No need to be afraid of what feels like a bomb in my kitchen?\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the reassurances and advice :) I think I'll be ok now", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1k1a1wg/pressure_cooker_whistle_4_times/", "created_utc": 1744887919.0, "score": 0, "author": "SapGreenJacket", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1k1a1wg/pressure_cooker_whistle_4_times/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["First, if steam is coming out it won\u2019t blow up. It is far more dangerous to drive a car than operate a pressure cooker.  \nOnce it whistles it has reached its operating pressure and then you can turn the heat down to medium low to low. Then just let it do its thing.", "To add to the answer you already got:\n\nWhistles are an old-school way of measuring cooking time for people who have pressure cookers with regulator valves that are weight-based (steam lifts valve, valve opens and releases steam to regulate pressure, making a \"whistle\" which actually sounds like a hiss)\n\nIf you have a more modern cooker with a spring valve, your cooker will continuously release steam, so you cannot count whistles. If this is you case, look up what is the recommended cooking time for the main ingredient in your dish in the cooking chart that comes with your cooker", "When I lived in India (and briefly in Nepal too) people refered to counting the whistles like this. They stay hands off, while the whistle blows steam for a loud minute, then drops for a few minutes, then blows again. They don't adjust the heat during this, just let it happen.\n\nYou're right, it's not a whistle, it's an alarmingly loud harsh noise. But it's called a whistle in South Asia.\n\nActually, it's not an accurate or fuel efficient way of timing your cooking. While the steam is blowing out, the cooker is cooling down even though the flame is continuing under the cooker. So the first time you make this dish, note the minutes from the start of the first whistle until the fourth. \n\nIn the future, as soon as the whistle starts to blow steam, turn turn the heat down to the minimum and let it simmer under pressure for the required number of minutes. This actually keeps the food in the cooker at a *higher* temperature than letting all the pressure blow out. \n\nDo let the whistle blow for a second initially to vent out the air and ensure that it is only steam inside, but after that turn down the heat, tap the whistle knob down if it doesn't go down by itself, and start the timer. It reduces noise and steam in your kitchen, and uses less fuel.", "Can you post your actual recipe and the type of pressure cooker you are using?  That would really help us to help you understand what's being asked and how to achieve it with your pressure cooker.  \n\nGenerally speaking with weighted pressure cookers (they have a little weight on top [like this](https://www.simplycanning.com/wp-content/uploads/pressure-canner2.jpg)) when you start hearing the steam/whistle blowing out the top it's because you've reached the max pressure and now steam is starting to escape.  Some recipes call for that limit to be hit and then to cut all the heat and allow it to cool because that's all the cooking you need.  Some recipe call for you to reach that point and then lower the heat so that only a small little trickle of steam escapes so that pressure (around 15 psi if your American, 1 bar or, roughly 14.5 psi if you're European) is maintained.  \n\nAs for safety, modern pressure cookers are pretty damn safe.  In addition to the little weighted steam escape valve they all have a plastic blow off valve on them.  If, for whatever reason, your weight gets stuck or the steam tube gets clogged, the little piece of plastic can only take a bit more pressure than the weight and will pop off releasing all pressure.  You have to get those things up to a very high pressure (deliberately sabotaging two separate safety features first) before they'll explode."]}

I woke up at 4 and the oven had turned off during the night (no idea when) but it was still warm in the oven. The meat was tough. I turned the temp up to 300 and put it back in. That was at 5 am. It's now 8:20 am and this is where we are. One piece (the flat) is starting to come along nicely and get more tender. The others are still pretty tough. \n\nMy question is, did I ruin it by using too much liquid for those first 2-3 hours?

Whenever I have tried to rush it by cranking up the heat and doing it in 20 minutes it has just lost something and been disappointing, even though I used exactly the same ingredients. I now just put a podcast on or a TV show whilst I am simmering.\n\nThe quality of the canned tomatoes does matter and I usually use posh Mutti ones, but I have also done the same recipe with cheapo canned tomatoes and it was still surprisingly good. I believe the longer cooking time breaks down some of the acid so it probably does not need the sugar (or baking soda), but I add sugar out of habit now.\n\nOther differences are that I use way more garlic than you, and a bit more extra virgin olive oil, and I skip the baking powder. I also slice the garlic rather than crush it. Typically for 8 portions I would use:\n\n* 2 x 400g cans of tomatoes. I usually use 1 x Mutti Pelati (whole peeled tomatoes that I crush a bit before adding), and 1 x 400g Mutti Polpa (finely chopped/crushed).\n* 1.5 head garlic. Usually around 40-50g. 16 or so cloves. Sliced.\n* 1 tsp salt, \n* 1 tsp sugar, \n* 90g EVOO,  \\~6 tbsp\n* 1 tsp chilli flakes\n\nFry the garlic on low for a 5-10 minutes, just until it starting to go golden. Add the chilli flakes then tomatoes, salt and sugar. Simmer on low stirring often until you get a nice wallpaper paste type texture. This usually takes at least 45 minutes, but I once managed 70 minutes.\n\n It does work for half the recipe too, but I usually make a large batch and freeze it. Then it s only \\~10 minutes per portion if it takes me 80 minutes all in.\n\nAnother question is how many portions are you making as you may be using too much sauce so masking the taste of the pasta too much. I would get 4 portions from 1 x 400g can of tomatoes and have each portion with 100g-125g or pasta (dry weight).", "Whole canned tomatoes. Must be a premium brand, La Fede and La Regina are both super premium, with La Fede being slightly higher quality. Drain them, leave only the whole tomatoes behind. No blender, and no hand crushing. You MUST use a food mill. Food mills evenly distribute the pulp, and don\u2019t break open the seeds. Blenders oxidize the tomatoes and break open seeds, hand squeezing is basically juicing and will result in a more watery tomato.\n\nSalt, and rest over night.

And this isn't necessary.  Most US restaurants aren't buying big cans of San Marzano from Italy.  They're buying big cans of ground or whole plum tomatoes grown in California, often under the Stanislaus brand (I buy this brand from restaurant supply stores).\n\nIf you want a chunky sauce, get a can of whole plum tomatoes in sauce.

I've been here for almost two months now and I feel like the pizzas that I make if the dough is straight off the walk-in chiller is perfect. I have no problem stretching them and it's very rare that I even puncture them. But I've had a problem since I started and it's still a problem now: over inflated doughs. We have proofing boxes for our pizza dough, and each box have about 10 - 12 doughs in them. When we have an order, we take out a box, make the order, and leave the box in room temp. Now this usually results in some dough not being used for quite some time, and [triples in size](https://eu-central.storage.cloudconvert.com/tasks/368d13bd-1c22-4eb5-9ff6-9cfb32c4c7f1/dough-over-proving.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=cloudconvert-production%2F20250411%2Ffra%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250411T221222Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=51e35c9c07b47f04e7914af704af12a312c0c4294bf797e328ec2fc61ae0825f&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D\"dough-over-proving.png\"&response-content-type=image%2Fpng&x-id=GetObject).\n\nI can do ones that double in size no problem. I've tried working the ones that tripled in size and all attempts have lead to multiple small holes in the dough and the crust being unbelievably thick. I thought that we can just use these over-proofed dough as a poolish (as a co-worker told me before) so I just get another tray from the chiller to use. Been doing that for around two weeks now and haven't had a problem until yesterday.\n\nNow yesterday, my only male co-worker go off on me saying \"these pizza doughs are still good to be baked, I had to sac two trays yesterday (it was my day-off btw) These doughs are not easy to make :/\".

It was also my first time hearing that there was a problem with what I've been doing. He also explained that I should \"just be careful\" with those types of dough. But that's what I've been trying to do, I've taken so much time with the same results. \n\nSo I have a couple of questions:\n\n1) First thing that came to mind was that maybe I should just put back the tray back in the chiller after an order. Is there no problem with doing that?\n\n2) If I cannot put the tray back, is there a foolproof way that I can work those triple-size dough because just \"being careful\" doesn't seem to be working for me? The internet is not helping me with my search and all results have just been about working a normal-sized dough, which I have no problem doing.\n\n3) The closest answer I've seen to help is \"punching the dough down\". Can somebody explain this to me because I've only seen [one video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEThHBo6x6U) about it, and it was vague.

There's enough air and enough steam buildup inside a pepper that if it builds up just right it could explode and cause hot oil to splatter.\n\nWhen I'm using dried chilis like this I seed them, which involves at least cutting them in half or breaking open a big hole in one end.\n\nI'm not sure why you'd ever do this with fresh peppers. The skin will decrease the flavor extraction. If you absolutely wanted to extract some heat a flavor from some extra spicy peppers that you didn't want to leave in the dish, it's probably better to make chili oil ahead of time.

I used to do it all the time for Chinese-style stir fries.\n\nIt's convenient for managing heat, especially when some family members / guests are sensitive to the heat.  It adds a surprising amount of flavor, and depending on the dish and the flavor you want to develop you can \"blacken\" the chilis more or less.  So darker for Chinese dishes, not so much for Italian or Indian dishes.", "It does. You could test this with a little oil, a chili, and a piece of bread.

For this reason, if you bite into a hot chili and want to remove the heat quickly, wash your mouth out with something fatty.", "Yes. I toss a single chopped up Thai chili and garlic into the oil in the wok for a few seconds before frying the rice.  It becomes almost too spicy for my kid, but almost perfect amount of heat for me.", "If it's sundried, yes. The peel will have degraded enough in a low pH environment to allow permeation of capsaicin and flavor compounds to the oil. If it's machine dried, maybe depending on the variety. If it's fresh, not really. The outer skin doesn't have heat or flavor, and the internal pressure buildup of a fresh chili pepper in hot oil can lead to an explosion. I don't really recommend it.\n\nIn general, if you see a whole fresh pepper, it's for photography purposes rather than culinary ones. Most food bloggers are content creators more than chefs.", "Why would it be silliness? That\u2019s basically just making an infused oil, and so anything cooked in that oil will carry that flavor. \n\nThink of it like this, if you fried a shallot in oil, you probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy eating a doughnut fried in that same oil afterwards, right? So if the oil takes on enough shallot flavor that it would be detrimental for some things, it\u2019s not much of a stretch that it would be beneficial for things where you want shallot flavor, right?", "Try it with and without it yourself and see what happens"]}

It also has quartered onions instead of chopped which means there are big chunks of onion under the meat keeping it off the bottom of the pot. \n* Recipe #2 has you pile everything on top of the meat after browning so the meat is sitting on the the bottom of the pot.  Also it calls for chopped onions and mine were probably a little more diced than chopped.  \n* Recipe #1 I have never left any ingredients out, it calls for a 3-4lb roast and I likely used one that was 3lbs or less.\n* Recipe #2 calls for potatoes which I omitted and my roast was only 2.5lbs when the recipe calls for 3-5lbs.  \n* Both recipes call for a similar amount of meat but #1 has 3 cups of liqiud and #2 calls for 4 cups of liquid.\n* Recipe #1 cooks for 1 hour 20 minutes and recipe #2 recommends 1 hour for a 3lb roast (which I did since mine was 2.5lbs).  \n\nWhat made recipe #2 so tough and disappointing?  Was it the meat altitude? The onion raft? The omission of potatoes?  Is red wine magic?  Did I actually not cook it long enough - I thought if meat was tough it always meant you overcooked it?!

This is way higher than a well done steak, but the reason it works is that converted gelatine surrounds the meat fibers and creates an unctuous fall apart texture despite how much the protein strands have been cooked. \n\nSo assuming your roasts were both the same cut, I think it probably was time. Note that cooking based on x minutes per lb is just a rough guess and you'll need to adjust as needed for specific pieces of meat. A thermometer can help you see what's going on more clearly.

Huge hunks of veg (onion, carrot, celery, herbs) as the base for the roast is all you need to get the roast drippings. The veg roasts and sweats into the drippings to add flavor. Remove the roast to let it rest, tented. Remove veg (I usually serve the onion, carrot and potatoes from that base, toss the celery) and use those drippings/grease to start the roux, toast is quite well, add beef stock to make the gravy and season well.\n\nIf you\u2019ve nailed the beef, that\u2019s the hard part.

My brain says breasts (and I have a butcher I can get good quality from) but if you know of ways to cut thighs into strips I'd love to hear that too.\n\n2. In an effort to get more uniform browning I'm thinking of adding butter powder to the last dredge step then spraying the strips with neutral oil before cooking. Are there any concerns with using powdered butter in a dredge in this manner? Any ideas about how much to use? It's a new ingredient to me that I've honestly been trying to find a reason to use it and I might be forcing it in this situation\n\n3. Shallow fry or bake? If I were to shallow fry I'd likely skip spraying them with oil, if I bake I'm thinking spray, but my concern is that the potato flakes would be liable to burn in a shallow fry, but some charring is delicious so any input is welcome\n\nI see that I'm getting a warning for using the term \"best\" but I hope this passes scrutiny because I'm not sure r/cooking would take these questions. \n\nThank you all in advance,\n\nHappy cooking!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jpcri6/a_couple_of_questions_about_making_chicken_strips/", "created_utc": 1743557549.0, "score": 7, "author": "milleribsen", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jpcri6/a_couple_of_questions_about_making_chicken_strips/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["\u201cBest\u201d is an auto-mod trigger word because it typically signals an open-ended, subjective post - I think you\u2019re fine here.", "1. You can cut thighs down the long direction into two or three strips depending on the size. They won't be quite as long as breast tenders but they still eat fine.\n\n2. I wouldn't use butter powder for this. It doesn't behave like butter when cooking, just brings the flavor. I think all you need to do to get good browning is cook it properly, but corn starch or rice flour are common additions to breading to get it more crispy. I also wouldn't spray with oil unless you just want oil on there because in an oven the oil won't be acting as a heat conductor the way it would when frying.\n\n3. Depends on your nutrition goals but if you're in good shape health wise I wouldn't be afraid of the shallow fry and it'll give crisper results. Getting a crisp but not burned exterior with a properly cooked interior just comes down to temperature control. Keep in mind if the outside is browning too fast vs what your thermo tells you about the inside, you can just let it sit on a rack for like 5 minutes then do a second fry to let the interior coast up."]}
{"title": "Soft tofu", "selftext": "I\u2019m doing something wrong. I used Mary\u2019s test kitchen tofu method. I tried twice. The first time I had my soybeans in water in fridge for bout 13 hours. And then I blended it with water as per \u201chttps://www.marystestkitchen.com/diy-silken-tofu-soy-beans-lemon-juice/\u201c . Than I had 3 milk bags combined and squeezed as much as I could, and than transferred to a pot where I did high heat and it boiled over so I was left with 3 cups of milk instead of 5 as in beginning. And I let that milk simmer for 10 mins. And than I let it cool to warm and I used 3 1/4 teaspoons of gypsum food grade and mixed it really well and I stuck in my aroma steamer as it warmed up and 10 mins to cook in, also I didn\u2019t put any plastic wrap, it was open. After it beeped as in done steaming, I opened it and the liquid was yellowish clear, and all the tofu was in the middle look crumbly. As if I used lemon in her video. So I took it out and left it alone to cool cause it\u2019s my first time and I thought maybe it still needs to cool. And it still was the same and went I cut through it looked like scrambled eggs. So I left it in the fridge and started in my next try. So my 2nd try. I left my beans on counter for about 8 hours to speed it up. And then I blended it new water and for about 3 mins in a very high powered blender but half a cup less because maybe it was too much water. And then I squeezed everything into a pot through 3 milk bags again. And this time I set it high and stirred frequently as before but watched carefully and as soon as it started to bubble and rise a bit, I took it off the stove and set the top to simmer and set back my pot for 10 mins and stirred regularly but not as frequently. Then I let it cool and stuck it into a fridge until became cold to touch, cause last time I did warm. Then I separated the milks. This time instead of mixing everything in one big jar, I had a glass cup where I poured abit milk of the 1 cup I was going to use, and I had a ceramic cup where I poured some milk. And left some in pan in fridge in case this gets screwed up. Then for glass I mixed in 1/4 teaspoon and an extra pinch to gypsum cause maybe not enough in first round and for ceramic I used the 1/4 teaspoon for each. And I poured the rest of cup of milk to each ceramic without stirring like Mary\u2019s video and set them into the aroma steamer opened. Then as I was going to pour the rest of cup milk in the glass cup, I realized my Soymilk became solid but very soft and jiggly and I thought maybe that\u2019s it, and that is my tofu, but it wasn\u2019t even heated, and it wasn\u2019t even the whole cup of milk so it would mean my soft tofu and the gypsum is out of balance and probably won\u2019t taste good as too much gypsum. So I had a small tray and I tried to get the bit of solidified tofu into the tray and it wouldn\u2019t come out until I smacked the glass a few times and it fell in chunks into the tray and looked fairly smooth and I added the rest of the soy milk to equal 1 cup in total into the tray. And this time I let the aroma steamer heat up before the 10 mins timer count down because maybe I was suppose to let it heat up. And I set it into the steamer uncovered again because her videos shown all jars uncovered. And I did it for all 3 containers. The tray with the tofu that looked soft in the glass jar before I added more milk. After it cooled, half of the round tray was solid and the other half was pure liquid like white but diluted. Like Soymilk with condensation. The other half with solids is because I had chunks of it I smacked in there and they grew a little bit bigger but they no longer soft looking but looked crumbly. And the other 2. Had bubbly looking on top. And were yellow yellow liquids, and looked like example she gave in the last part of the video claiming why store bought milk is not a good idea. And 1 tray lowkey looked like her last example of almond milk if tried with gypsum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used food grade gypsum!\n\nLater I cooked it for longer and realized I could make firm tofu and made firm tofu with it after pressing and all. \n\nMy goal was silken soft tofu or soon tofu or even very soft silken tofu. All I want is soft tofu just soft and smooth and yummy. \n\nSo I did bunch of research and watch videos of others \n1. Was I supposed to use the plastic wraps before putting into steamer?\n2. Was I not supposed to use steamer and just done it in hot soy milk and let it set on counter?\n3. Is 10 mins too hot to steam in and should done less?\n4. Should I used the GDL method instead and go buy GDL?\n5. Was I supposed to mix it throughly instead ?\n6. Am I supposed to use way less gypsum or way more?\n\nThere is so much questions but I can\u2019t keep testing it and failing so much. \n\nPlease tell me what went wrong!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jpe8kq/soft_tofu/", "created_utc": 1743561531.0, "score": 4, "author": "Ok_Seaweed8659", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jpe8kq/soft_tofu/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Just a helpful hint on how to get the best feedback- distill this wall of text down to a few cogent questions.

It used to be both ends of the rib were delicious and flavorful. \n\nThese days the end with the bone exposed cooks okay, with the outer layer done nicely, but underneath that layer it\u2019s pretty dry and unseasoned. The opposite end of the rib disappears into a mess of a joint and cartilage, with unrendered fat.

I found the texture strange and the taste unpleasant.  I grew up eating A Lot of rice and had never experienced this before switching to a cheap brand.  Perhaps the brand of rice is the issue?\n\nIf this is happening with multiple brands it could also be that the rice isn't getting enough time to rest?  My understanding is that resting your rice makes it more glossy and helps it to finish cooking evenly so there are no mushy patches.  I was taught to always mix rice as soon as it finished cooking to \"fluff it\" and then give it at least five minutes to steam and rest.  Typically we leave it for longer bc we're busy getting the rest of the meal together so don't stress, just let it hang out in the rice cooker until you're ready to spread it on your sheet pan.\n\nI hope this helps you on your fried rice journey!\n\nETA: I noticed you mentioned you're cooking a small amount of rice in another comment.  That could be the problem as well.  Most rice cookers have a minimum and maximum and the rice can get weird if you go outside of those bounds.", "Are you rinsing the rice? White rice needs the excess starch rinsed off or you\u2019ll end up with a gloppy mess. \n\nWhat kind of rice are you using? It doesn\u2019t really matter but for fried rice you want something fairly long grained, like jasmine.", "What type of rice are you using, and how much water?", "Either higher heat or use day old rice or both.", "TLDR; too much water.  If the finger method or lines on the cooker pot aren't working, you'll have to experiment.\n\nLong Answer, believe it or not, all rice needs the same ratio of water which is 1:1 by volume.  This is true whether it's white, brown, red, etc.  The difference is some rice takes longer to cook / get soft therefore you get more evaporation which is why it seems like it needs more water.  If you seal rice and water into a vacuum bag and cook it that way so there is no evaporation, it only needs a ratio of 1:1.  But you still have to cook brown rice longer than white to get it to be \"done\".\n\nThe way simple rice cookers work is it just as a simple thermocouple to see if the temperature exceeds a certain level.  When there is water in the rice cooker, the temperature stays around 212f / 100c.  But when the water boils off the temperature suddenly spikes which triggers a switch to cut the power.  Fancier ones do other things but basically that's how it works.  If you have too much water in the rice cooker it will take longer for the water to boil off and to get the temperature to spike so the rice will cook longer and absorb more water and become mushy.  Just like if you overcooked noodles.  So if that's the problem, the only solution is to use less water.\n\nAs for getting the correct water ratio, the lines on cooking pot are set for the rice cup, not a regular measuring cup.  So a \"cup\" of rice is actually 180 ml or \\~3/4 of a cup.  If you use a regular cup the lines on the rice pot won't work.  Your rice will come out dry.  This is the opposite problem to what you're getting but I'm including it here for completeness.\n\nIf all that fails, you can always use the pasta method of cooking rice.  That is, just boil rice in a lot of water just like you'd cook pasta.  While it's cooking pull out a grain to see if it's done, like you would pasta,  If it is, just pour the contents into a fine mesh colander to drain the water out, then put the rice back into the pot and let it sit for a bit to remove the surface moisture.

The meat will contract as it cooks, so searing one face hard while the other face is raw will curl/warp the steak, which makes it difficult to maintain good surface to surface contact.\n- Not the best results to effort option, but if you\u2019re trying to dial in a sear to be perfect, edge to edge, I sometimes use a torch to touch up on the face-up side of the steak while the other side sears in the pan. Mostly my goal is to fill in the gaps where the sear is lacking, (or even the sides if it\u2019s a thick steak) but I\u2019ve found this also goes a long way to keep moisture low as it\u2019s sweating from cooking or salt application.

The only difference is that I started with cold egg whites, but just beat them for a long time until they came up to room temp. \n\nToday I decided to try the chocolate variant suggested by the top comment: \n\n> For chocolate meringues: Omit vanilla and sift 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder with half the sugar. Add to egg whites, cream of tartar and salt. Continue with Step 1.\n\nBut today they deflated! Is it due to lack of sugar? Or could it be that they ended up more stable when I started with the cold egg whites the other day? I did the test of turning them upside down to see if the mixture moved today and it seemed pretty stable. But maybe I should have beat them longer anyway? \n\nI suppose there's nothing to be done for this batch is there? Any suggestions for a use for them?\n\nETA: I think it's because today I whipped them too quickly and at high speed. I did it slower and longer yesterday because they were still cold. \n\nETA2: After even more reading, it does seem like reducing the sugar is a bad idea too. Most people seem to say that a 2:1 ratio is needed for structural integrity. Which is too bad because less sweet meringues would be nice! I often find them borderline too sweet. Oh well. Often the NYT comment section is very good, but this time it seems to have been off the mark.\n\n>  It may seem counterintuitive to whisk on medium speed when you could make a meringue much faster by beating the egg whites on high speed for less time, but the key to a meringue that won\u2019t deflate is to go slower for longer. As I wrote in my chocolate mousse recipe, the bubbles in egg whites become smaller and more stable the longer we whip them. As Herv\u00e9 This explains in his book Kitchen Mysteries, the process of whipping helps to unfold egg white proteins and connect them with one another, creating a network that protects the tiny bubbles. Whisking for longer also helps to ensure your sugar is properly incorporated, which reduces the risk of weeping.\n\n> This may be surprising, but whipping your eggs slower for longer also helps prevent overbeating. Whisk your egg whites too long, and the proteins will bond too tightly, essentially \u201ccooking\u201d the whites. An overbeaten meringue will lose its sheen and become a lumpy, uneven foam, and fail to rise in the oven when baked. \n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/perfect-meringue-cookies-recipe-8656492", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jf5n5m/did_my_meringues_deflate_due_to_lack_of_sugar/", "created_utc": 1742412996.0, "score": 2, "author": "AQuestionOfBlood", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1jf5n5m/did_my_meringues_deflate_due_to_lack_of_sugar/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Probably a combination of the fact that whipper slower, longer is better + chocolate introduces fat that makes it harder to form a stable meringue foam.

The dough will tighten but it'll also start breaking down faster and faster as the strands of gluten reach their maximum tension and start ripping apart faster than they're being produced. Furthermore, you're using whole wheat flour which contains bran, so these basically slice through gluten while you're kneading it, so it's much easier to overwork it.\n\nThe most likely the thing is some form of over-kneading. I would recommend timing your mixing so you don't accidentally over do it and maybe stop halfway and give the dough a little time to relax.

I find the end product comes out like crap if there isn't a large excess of breading. If you find this wasteful, consider freezing your leftover breading and reusing it. \n\nI followed the J Kenji-Alt method of frying chicken a million different ways to get it perfect. It's a long write-up, but i'll include it here if you'd like to read it. There's a short and long version.\n\n**Ingredients** \n\nChicken tenderloins \n\nPickle juice \n\nButtermilk\n\nFlour \n\nBaking powder \n\nCorn starch \n\nTry potato starch? \n\nConsider freezing leftover breading and reusing it for better breading.\n\nI spent a couple years trying to up my deep frying game. Read kenji articles, others, made tenders, wings, and whole chickens a ton of ways. Here's my opinion. \n\n**Short version.**\n \nFried chicken - tenders, wings, etc\nBrine in half buttermilk, half pickle juice and some hot sauce. Add seasoning, and a bay leaf.\nWet dry wet dry. Do all the chicken at once, comes out craggier. Let sit for five minutes before frying, makes a better barrier. \n\n**Better version.** \n\nI've worked in a dozen restaurants, and personally used more recipes and pieces of recipes for fried chicken, wings, and tenders than I can count. This has never failed me.\n\nMarinate chicken if you want. Pickle juice is my favorite. No more than 24 hours imo. I've done a one day Pickle brine followed by one hour of Buttermilk and it was unreal. \n\nDry mix of flour, corn starch, baking powder, seasoning. Ideally 50:50 flour and starch. \n\nDo not dry the chicken. Just go directly into your dry. This will stick to the chicken well and deposit liquid into the dry that will allow the dry mix to get you a craggly crust. Ideally you batter enough chicken that each piece spends a minute coated in dry mix before going into the wet. \n\nWet time. I like a few options. Egg and a little vodka, but only make this option if you're going to use it (the wet) immediately. Does not last. Does not affect shelf life of chicken. You can also do egg with some milk, cream, or buttermilk or just Buttermilk. \n\n**Craggliest?** Egg and vodka. \n\n**Tastiest?** Buttermilk. \n\nIf you\u2019re not reusing old breading, add some or all of the wet to the dry mix and make the flour have tons of craggly bits. \n\nDry again. If you're using a rigid piece of meat (wings, bone in meat), this is easy. If you're battering tenders or something floppy, manipulate it. Bend it. Get it fully coated. Make sure you're patting, packing. \n\nLet sit for five minutes. Toss back through the dry to ensure a good coating. Give it another minute.\n\nMake sure your oil is 350. Make sure it can hold that temp. Don't over crowd. \n\nIdeally, I fry a ton of wings or tenders. But I par fry it all. Usually aiming for 130 ish. I'll finish the first batch after frying it all so I have some to eat, leaving the rest out to cool. \n\nFreeze par cooked chicken until rock hard. But take into account carry over cooking, typically I can pull mine around 155/160.\n\nThis fry, freeze, refry is something I pulled from kenji during his French fry escapades. It works with battered chicken/meat as well, making the crust even cragglier. However, it also has the benefit of having a freezer of fried chicken that just has to be dropped into hot oil. Don't have to batter every time you want some. Just thaw before cooking if you want best results.", "Yes. Or pass through a strainer", "I\u2019d sift it to remove the lumps, then keep using it.", "You could always sift it.", "Yes, it feels wasteful, but it's normal.

I'm thinking of adding a little sugar to see if that helps cut into that strong flavor, but I'm an amateur and hesitant to add for fear of ruining the dish. Any suggestions?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the suggestions! I'll try some out and see what works. It'll also chill before we eat it so fingers crossed it'll mellow out.

Normally no,  thighs have higher fat content and more myoglobin.

The other way around would result in a dry and ropey texture. This recipe would probable turn out better with thighs though,  due to first saut\u00e9ing and then pressure cooking. The higher temperature will accelerate the dissolving of the fat and myoglobin. Using breast would probably result in a dry ropey and chalky texture.  Think of breast like steak, high to medium high heat for browning and to make sure the core temp makes it safe to eat. Take it off the heat as soon as the core temp is close to safe ( preferably slightly lower to account for carry over cooking if you're using a skillet). Thighs are more like the beaf you would use for a stew. Brown them on a high heat and then go low and slow (or pressure cooker for quicker results)."]}

This is basically word for word some instructions I sent to a friend of mine who is a very novice baker who wanted to try it after she tasted mine at a party.\n\nHere's the base recipe I use:\nhttps://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/8082-bee-sting-cake\n\nSome edits and parts where I went off-recipe or with other techniques:\n\nForget everything that recipe says about making the pastry cream (pastry cream with gelatin, I find is inauthentic, finnicky, and has a gross texture).  Use Martha's recipe instead, and add 1/4 tsp of almond extract: \n\nhttps://www.marthastewart.com/1084932/no-fuss-pastry-cream.  \n\nJust make sure you don't undercook it, or you'll have runny filling in your cake.  If it does turn out runny, you can always re-heat it to get the starches to absorb more liquid, but be careful not to scorch it.\n\nFor steps #3-4, where you're making the dough, don't go simply by the timing of it (\"8-10 minutes\").  You need to get the brioche dough (that's what this \"cake\" is, essentially, a really sweet brioche dough) to a windowpane texture.  8-10 minutes of kneading is a good start, but it can depend on your tools, the temperature of the butter, the speed of your kneading, etc.  And this where I would say that if you want to switch it up from AP, bread flour would be my choice.  The gluten is important as part of the process, then let the butter and richness of the dough soften things up from there.\n\nHere's instructions on how to do the windowpane test, just in case that's a new concept to you: https://www.thekitchn.com/bakers-techniques-how-to-do-th-70784\n\nIn step #5, I have several notes:\n\n>Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and press into 9-inch round. Transfer dough to prepared pan and press in even layer to edges of pan\n\nIt is very important to press without tearing, and get this 9 inch round really even in thickness.\n    \n>Cover pan loosely with plastic and let rise at room temperature until puffy, 35 to 50 minutes.\n\n\"Puffy\" here means once you can make a small indent with your finger, and the dough stays indented.  \n\n>After rising, dough and pan can be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let dough come to room temperature before baking\n\nThe reason for this, which the recipe neglects to mention, is that it increases the flavor profile.  It gives it that really nice yeasty taste that offsets the sweetness and sugars, and for me is very nostalgic of Slovak and German desserts my grandmother used to make.  I did do an overnight rest for the dough for that reason, though it's not completely necessary.\n\nIn case you're curious, you don't have to worry about it over-proofing, because the butter re-solidified and stops the dough from expanding.  It's a cool piece of brioche dough science/technique.  \n\nGood luck!  This dessert is absolutely amazing once you pull it off.  Easily one of my favorite things I have made in a few years.\n\nI have also done a chocolate brioche version topped with honeyed pecans and with an apricot gelatin fill.

It's sometimes marketed as \"saved\" or \"brewers\" flour as well.", "A number of problems with this:\n\n* Wheat is the only grain that's really high in gluten. While barley, rye and some other grains contain them too, they don't form your typical 'glutinous' dough structure. For this to have any chance at all you'd need to use spent grain that's mostly wheat. That does exist, but most spent grain is mostly barley, possibly mixed with cheap starch sources such as maize and rice. So this rules out most spent grains, but it leaves a door open for wheat-based spent grains.\n\n* spent grain contains lots of husk. These insoluble fibrous bits prevent a nice dough from forming: imagine the difference between white vs wholemeal flour, but then way, way worse. So for this to work you would need to separate the gluten from the husk\n\n* about this point I'm less sure about the extend of the effect since I'm neither a brewer nor a baker, but it could potentially be the major reason why it's simply impossible: during the mashing not only starch-converting enzymes are present, but proteases too. These enzymes break down proteins, including gluten. The (partly-)broken down gluten will still be present and are still 'protein' in a nutritional sense, but they will lose the length and functional groups to stabilize a good dough.

While eels tend to be caught further down the coast (Monterey as opposed to SF) they\u2019re not a traditional ingredient.  But who cares. As long as your gravy is good, and you have a generous amount of fish/seafood, along with good crispy bread, it will make a great meal."]}

{"title": "Any tradeoffs to braising in roasting pan with lid vs dutch oven?", "selftext": "I am considering purchasing a 12 Qt oval roasting pan with lid (stainless steel; triply clad lid and bottom; \\~10 pounds) to use for braising recipes. As context, I recently made Beef Bourgignon in my 7.5 Qt dutch oven, which is a great kitchen workhorse, but browning the 5 lbs of chuck roast required 3 batches. I am hoping for a larger pot/pan that gives more surface area for browning to save time. \n\nI have also considered a Rondeau or Braiser, but I prefer cookware that provides diverse uses to save space, and other than greater surface area for browning and sauteeing, I'm not sure it would provide additional value add compared to my current options. On the other hand, I don't have a large roasting pan, so am thinking I can kill two birds with one stone by getting a roasting pan with a lid.\n\nI know rectangular roasting pans would provide more surface area, but for whatever reason, most of the pans with both lid and rack I've found tend to be oval.\n\nSo in short, are there any tradeoffs to braising in this type of cookware instead of a dutch oven or braiser? (e.g., related to heat retention or evenness, or to the larger volume of air inside the dish when covered?)  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1ixd762/any_tradeoffs_to_braising_in_roasting_pan_with/", "created_utc": 1740431666.0, "score": 13, "author": "Extension_Bobcat3532", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1ixd762/any_tradeoffs_to_braising_in_roasting_pan_with/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I have a stainless rondeau that I use for braises and one-pot meals, but also for searing steaks since wide cooking surface and such a thick base it holds more heat than anything else in my kitchen. I've even used it for quasi-griddle duty when I need another cooking surface at breakfast.", "For home use probably not - negligible at any rate.", "Thinner gauge metal and faster heat transfer on the roasting pan mean it does less to stabilize the oven temperature as it cycles. \n\nYour oven is not perfectly at the temperature you set it to. It cycles above and blow the set point, according to the thermostat clicking on and off. Typical swings are about 10-25F above and below the set point. \n\nSince it's thicker, and lacks the aluminum layer. The cast iron in the Dutch oven, rondeau and braiser. Takes longer to heat up. So it's going to spend less time at the high and low point of the cycle, if it heats them at all. And more time closer to the set point. \n\nWhich means less chance of over cooking things. \n\nThat said I have a enameled carbon steel braiser, and a deep sided multi-ply skillet with lid. Both of which I braise in. And there's not ton of difference between that and a cast iron dutch oven. Things do tend to get up above boiling a little easier in my currently very crappy oven. But it's easy enough to just keep the oven temp set lower. \n\n>I know rectangular roasting pans would provide more surface area, but for whatever reason, most of the pans with both lid and rack I've found tend to be oval.\n\nBecause rectangular lids are much, much, much more prone to warping. Particularly for thinner materials. \n\nOther things on roasting pans make them a poor choice for general use, or just conflict on the subject of getting a hefty tri ply one. \n\nThey don't fit on a single burner, which means they heat unevenly when used on the stove top. Heat doesn't transfer up the side properly and won't spread evenly accross the bottom. No matter what it's made of, things are just a bit too far apart. So stove top beyond the basics (making gravy) is not really in it's wheel house. \n\nHigh sided roasting pans are not great roasting pans. They trap moisture in the pan and shield the sides of food from radiant heat. Slowing cooking and limiting browning. Many roasting pans are used with a rack. The high sides defeat the purpose of that. \n\nFrankly a roasting pan is not a general use tool. They're only for roasting. And a sheet pan or other low sided pan, especially fitted with a rack does a better job. Even the sort of pan you might need for something with a lot of drippings. Like duck. Is gonna be lower than most roasting pans. (I like 2\" deep hotel pans). \n\n*Covered* roasting pans have all the same short comings. Except that they're even higher sided, making them especially bad for uncovered roasting. The thing those are for is *covered roasting*. Which is a bit like a light braise, You're kinda cooking with the trapped liquid from the meat and veg itself. \n\nIt's a bit out of fashion. But I tend I like it for the right cut. \n\nA rondeau, Dutch oven or braiser can be used for covered roasting. The covered roaster generally can't be used for all of the other stuff the other pans can be used for.\n\nThe only reason to get a covered roaster is if you're *covered roasting* items too large or odd shaped to fit in the other options. Like a leg of lamb, turkey, whole pork shoulder etc. \n\nAnd for other roasting you're better off looking towards lower sided hotel and sheep pans. As they are both better roasting pans, and more general use.", "Which Looks you prefer matters here. Team polished colorful dutch oven vs team looking expert stainless steel"]}

It will warm the product more slowly. You may have to cook it a little longer to get it heated through but it will be less mash. \n\nFourth - seasoning.

A few tips that are a little left field but we were very well known for our FOS so they clearly worked.\n\n* Half chicken/half veal stock but we would also add in some marmite- but not what you're thinking of. In old school french cooking, marmite is a stock made with oignons br\u00fbl\u00e9s, onions that are halved and then almost burnt on the flat top. Skins on. Gives depth, character and colour to the stock. Made properly, its not bitter.  I haven't tried this- but since the stock does give its name to actual Aussie Marmite which is an umami bomb, you might want to skip the stock and try adding some.\n\n* Sadly, the stock does make all the difference but given your limitations, adding gelatine to a good quality store bought is a decent mimic of the real thing.\n\n* Salt the hell out of the onions when cooking them down. This is the only salt you'll need. Deglaze as you go with whatever liquid, stock, wine, water- doesn't matter, just toss, bubble and scrape occasionally. FOS is made by every cook who walks past a rondeau and gives it a stir.\n\n* Speaking of umami, we always added a few generous glugs of Japanese tamari- less salty than its Chinese counterparts- and a big helping of white miso.\n\n* We used whatever wine we had left over from the 'by the glass wine pairings' from the night before so a melange of white and red.\n\n* Really really really good sherry vinegar. This is the true game changer. The expensive shit makes a difference.\n\n* High quality, yeasty baguette rounds for the top. Toasted with some good quality olive oil.\n\n* Slice each of gruy\u00e8re and comt\u00e9 and occasionally some provolone when my whack job Ukrainian head chef was around. He was a scrounger of cheap products, hence the whatever random fucking wine he didn't just chug ended up in the soup. Provolone gives it a great pull but its the swiss types that make the difference in taste. The cheese should be a little burnt- like on a great pizza.\n\n* Mushrooms are an outlier on this.

Kind of like when baking how you mix all the dry together before combining them with all the wet. To me, that helps me be more confident that I can uniformly mix the meat with everything else without overworking the meat and giving it a weird texture.", "I think the major flaws in your method were putting the ketchup in the meatloaf instead of on top, and adding all that brown sugar. Sugar acts as liquid in recipes so you\u2019re basically adding a couple of cups of flavored liquid to some ground meat. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen anyone add more than a tablespoon of brown sugar, and I\u2019m honestly not sold on even that. \n\nI\u2019d get sweetness from onions/carrots, and maybe a sweet glaze on top. If you want some tomatoey-ness in the meatloaf itself, you could add a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to the meat mixture. The metal tubes of paste keep in the fridge for a long time so you\u2019re not stuck with half a can of tomato paste. \n\n(And coming up is probably way more detail than you were looking for, sorry \u2014 I was hoping if I procrastinated my grocery run long enough it would stop raining. No luck, but the words are already written!)\n\nThe meatloaf I made a few weeks ago had a really good texture, easily sliceable straight out of the oven. \n\nBasic recipe \n\n4 ounces dry bread heels from the freezer thrown into the food processor and processed into a mix of coarse crumbs and smaller than dime sized chunks\n\nHalf cup milk (or so)\n\nMed yellow onion, chopped\n2 cloves garlic, minced\nAnother cup of chopped vegetables of your choice, optional\n\n1 lb each ground beef and ground pork\n\n2 eggs\n\n3/4- 1 tsp table salt (better to use less to start)\n1 Tbl Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper\n1/2 t or so of other spice/herb you might like - cumin, chile/i powder, rosemary, sage, etc \n\nCombine the bread pieces/crumbs with the milk in a large mixing bowl and set aside to let the milk soak in. Saut\u00e9 the vegetables over medium to medium low heat until the veggies are softened and starting to brown. You can add 1/2 - 3/4 cup of a tasty liquid ( compatible beer, wine, or nonalcoholic option) if you want *edit: and saut\u00e9 for a few more minutes u til the pan is nearly dry*, or just move on. \n\nCooked veg goes into the bowl with the bread. Add the meats m, eggs, and seasonings. Stir gently to mix everything, or use hands. \n\nWhole thing goes on a big sheet pan. Shape into a 10x4 block and spread about 3 tablespoons of ketchup on top and a little down the sides. \n\nBake at 375 for 40-55 min (center should reach 160) on the center rack of oven. \n\nThis is basically the fancy version of what I grew up with, and made as a young teenager. Childhood version used all ground beef, onions were chopped and thrown in the bowl raw, bread was heels from the freezer that got hand torn and tossed in the bowl. Sloshed in just enough milk to moisten the bread without any extra runoff. Seasoned with granulated garlic, pepper from a metal shaker can, probably some salt.  Cracked in a couple eggs, squirted some ketchup on top and chucked it in the oven. As long as the raw mix is pretty self supporting the finished product should hold together well.\n\nEdit: my \u201cfancy\u201d framework is adapted from the Feb/mar 2011 issue of fine cooking \u2014 it\u2019s a column called cooking without recipes. Lots of variations on ingredients and flavor combinations so you can change things up if you want. My recent recipe had chopped carrots, bell pepper, a few leftover slices of bacon I chopped up, pan deglazed with some stout beer, and some red pepper flakes. I\u2019ve also done bacon and cheddar with mushrooms and carrots, classic celery/inion/carrot with all beef and ketchup glaze. It\u2019s a good way to use up odds and ends of stuff from the fridge!\n\nEdit 2: If you want to stretch the meat more you could up the bread component a bit and add an extra egg to help it hold together. Not that eggs are that economical these days either\u2026", "Holy shit, a cup of ketchup and a cup of brown sugar is alot of sugar for a meatloaf!\n\nAs to your problem, you probably don't need anywhere near as much ketchup or sugar.

I won't do the chemistry here, but to dissolve 1 mg of metallic copper in even a straight acid like vinegar would be difficult.

Roasting them mellows out the bitterness.\n2. You didn't simmer long enough. 45mins works well when your veg has been roasted off, but is way too short for raw onion etc. You need about 2hrs for raw onion.

Ground black pepper especially goes bitter over time. So use whole peppercorns instead. So add your dried herbs and spices for last 30mins of simmer.\n4. You need a gentle simmer. Over boiling will agitate and break the veggies way to aggressively releasing a lot of bitter chemicals. Simmer for 2hrs and skim any excess scum/foam that holds a lot of bitter flavour. \n5.

Maybe over a hundred at this point. Not saying that to make you feel bad, just making it clear that this is a known-problem. \n\nThe problem is that you are using the leidenfrost test. The effect happens at 380F and continues to happen well passed temps that you don't want to cook eggs at. The odds that you catch it exactly at 380F are very low. The odds that the pan's temp is in the 400F-450F range is very high. You could even be in the 500F range, if your oil is smoking. This temp is way too hot for fried eggs, and that's why they are sticking and things are burning. And then you were putting the pan back on the heat even longer... so it's definitely too hot.\n\nSo instead, you have a few options...\n\n1. Use butter, if you can. Pre-heat the butter over medium heat until it just stops foaming but before it turns brown. If it's already browning, the heat is too high, so turn it down to med-low. Then add your eggs. The butter actually does a better job than oil at keeping eggs from sticking. I don't have a science-y answer for why. And the butter also has a built-in way to determine when the pan is at the perfect temp for eggs (when it just stops foaming).\n\n2. Do exactly what you were previously doing, leidenfrost test and all, but instead of putting the pan *back* on the heat for a couple minutes, just take it *off* the heat for a couple minutes. The pan needs to cool down.\n\n3. Use a nonstick pan for eggs. There's really no reason to try to make breakfast more challenging. \n\n> Incidentally the best way I have found to clean things that are stuck off is to put it on the stove full of water, chuck in a dishwasher detergent puck, and let the water boil for 10 minutes or so.\n\nSkip the dishwasher detergent, it's wasteful and unnecessary.

{"title": "Butter Bell / science question", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a potter, and have started making butter bells. I have a question about the science re how they work.\n\nConventional wisdom says that a bell prevents butter from become rancid because water stays in contact with the butter, thus creating a seal preventing oxygen from reaching the butter ([see illustration](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B-gR2HaIL.jpg))\n\nIn practice, however, this is not what happens. If the butter is filled to the brim of the bell, yes. But once some of the butter is used, and the butter level falls below the rim of the jar, water will no longer touch the butter because a vacuum is created. It's the same idea as holding a drinking glass upside down and submerging it in water.\n\nI imagine this still works to keep the butter fresh - the water is indeed creating an airtight seal such that no new outside air is entering. But there will still be a pocket of non-circulating air between the butter and the water.\n\nDoes this track? And is exposure to air, as long as it does not circulate, ok when trying to preserving butter at room temp?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1it8ze3/butter_bell_science_question/", "created_utc": 1739981056.0, "score": 2, "author": "BlueAnnapolis", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1it8ze3/butter_bell_science_question/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["As you suspect, the important thing is that it's an airtight seal, *not* that the butter is touching the water.

{"title": "Tips for making fruit-flavored creme brulee?", "selftext": "I've been trying to nail down a recipe for making fruit-flavored creme brulee, where the fruit flavor is actually incorporated into the custard. Most recipes I've seen online involve adding whole chunks of fruit, or an entirely separate. layer of coulis/fruit reduction. \n\nMy first attempt did not turn out well: \n\n- I cooked down a pound of strawberries with 1/4 cup of sugar and a splash of lemon juice, then passed this through a fine-mesh sieve to get a pretty thick sauce (lost a good amount of fruit here because it wouldn't pass through the sieve). \n- I added this to my [normal creme brulee recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9039-vanilla-creme-brulee) (only reducing the cream by a little, no other alterations). Because the fruit sauce was so thick, I had to whisk the custard a lot to mix it in evenly and ended up over-aerating the custard (but I didn't realize this at the time/was in a rush, so just baked it anyways). \n- The end result had a foam-like quality to it, definitely not what I had intended. The strawberry flavor also wasn't a strong as I would have liked.\n\nMy second attempt was a little better, but still not great:\n\n- I decided to use 1.5 pounds of fruit to increase the strawberry flavor and also blend the fruit prior to cooking it (I would blend after, but I have a shitty blender that can't handle hot liquids). My hope was that blending it would reduce the amount of fruit lost to the sieve (boosting the strawberry flavor) as well as result in a smoother sauce that would be easier to incorporate into the custard. \n- I did accomplish both goals - the custard was not over-mixed and the fruit flavor was more noticeable. \n- However, I neglected to account for how adding that much extra liquid would affect the custard setting. Because I don't trust myself to consistently judge texture/consistency, I normally pull my creme brulees based on internal temps taken with a thermometer. I took them out of the oven at the same temp as usual, not paying much attention to the actual consistency. Once they fully cooled, they essentially had the texture of yogurt - not exactly what I was looking for.\n\nI'll be making my third attempt soon, and plan to try the following:\n\n- Use only 1 pound of fruit to reduce the final amount of liquid added to the custard. Still plan to blend the fruit prior to reducing to help smooth out the final sauce. I'm hoping this will produce a strong-enough strawberry flavor without diluting the custard too much.\n- Bake the custard for a longer period of time, and try to judge doneness visually since I have no idea what the appropriate temperature would be.\n\nI'm still debating on trying the following to help fix the texture even more:\n\n- Adding an extra egg yolk to help thicken the custard, AND/OR\n- Reducing the amount of cream so that the ratio of egg yolks to other liquids is the same as the original recipe\n\nI'm crossing my fingers that the third time's the charm, and I'd really appreciate any thoughts anyone might have/suggestions on changing up things that I haven't considered!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1isowuv/tips_for_making_fruitflavored_creme_brulee/", "created_utc": 1739917106.0, "score": 15, "author": "theasianpianist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1isowuv/tips_for_making_fruitflavored_creme_brulee/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Personally I'd try powdered freeze-dried fruit since that's what I use when I want really strong fruit favor in SMBC and don't want the texture screwed up", "I would approach this slightly differently.

They have no problem going from 100 to 101, but going from 0 to 1 is never accurate. It works better if you don't tare the container you're measuring into and do the math.\n\nBetter yet, get a small scale that measures to 0.01g, they're far more sensitive. I use an AWS-100 for measuring seasonings for sausage making and anything else where I need a high level of precision.  They're easy to find, and around twenty bucks.", "humidity for one thing.", "Most home kitchen scales don't register below like 10g. Place a bowl on the scale but don't zero it out.

For instance- on my scale, that lower limit is about 4-5mgs- it just won\u2019t detect anything less. So if I started with a zeroed out scale and added 1mg, it would read 0.00. If I then added another 1mg it would read 0.00. If I added another 3mg, it would also still not register anything and read 0.00, despite having 5mgs of total shit on it and withing the range it can detect. \n\nKnowing this- when I need an accurate reading of a very small amount of something, just a few milligrams, I know I need to first put down a greater amount of whatever I\u2019m weighing, and then pull from it, until I reach the weight that I need. In that example above and anytime I need to weigh something in that ballpark, I\u2019d be much better suited to put down 10mgs, and subtract by 1mg until I ended up with whatever it is I was aiming for. \n\nEvery scale has a threshold for the minimum mass it can detect. Look up what yours is and that should help. It\u2019s likely greater than 1g, and that seems about right since most kitchen scales are not designed to handle such small amounts usually.

They're nice looking, but they're basically a scale which has been flipped upside down. The feet press on the strain gauge (sensor that detects force) such that the sensor is weighing the entire weight of the scale plus the load you are wanting to measure. From an instrument design perspective, this is a crap design because your sensor has a much smaller percentage difference in output when weighing light things. \n\nFor instance, if your scale weighs 300g and you want to weigh 1g of stuff, your scale is differentiating a signal strength between 300g vs 301g. A weighing pan can be made much lighter, say 30g. Now your sensor is differentiating between 30g vs 31g which gives a signal variation that 10x bigger than when you flipped the scale upside down.\n\nGet a bit of crud under one of the feet and they'll rock and sensor is likely to give funny results too.\n\nDon't buy scales just because the display shows lots of decimal places. Reported resolution is easy to provide with electronics, but the LCD output may still have a fundamentally terrible mechanical design. It is also common for junk scales to output 0.00g when they are close to 0g because it makes users itchy when they see a scale not coming back to zero. If you report a lot of decimal places, you mechanical design is junk and your signal processing stuff is also junk (not temperature compensated for example), you'll get a lot of non zero outputs with nothing being weighed. Instead of advertising how junky your junk is, just report zero for any output that is below 2g.\n\nIf you haven't got this kind of scale I guess I wasted a bunch of time typing this out..."]}

{"title": "Concerned and Confused About Storing Raw Chicken", "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'll preface this with saying I am someone who has food anxiety and worries about getting sick from it, especially things like meat - and chicken specifically. So I am very cautious. \n\nOne thing I've been confused about for a while is how long raw chicken is good for in the fridge after purchasing it. For example, the USDA says 1-2 days after purchase, but the pack of chicken my sister bought yesterday (2/16) has a sell by date that I'm assuming must be something like 2/20 or 2/21 because she plans on making it on 2/19. She's fairly cautious too (but not as much as me lol) and told me that she was making it before the sell by date. \n\nThis would put her making it at 3 days after purchase, but theoretically it could've sat at the store for another day or 2 even...\n\nSO... what is the real story here? Is the USDA just super cautious with their 1-2 days after purchase policy? Or is it sketchy to use it on the 3rd or 4th day even if it's before the sell by date? \n\nThank you!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1irkgco/concerned_and_confused_about_storing_raw_chicken/", "created_utc": 1739800808.0, "score": 0, "author": "jenjenjk", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/AskCulinary/comments/1irkgco/concerned_and_confused_about_storing_raw_chicken/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["The packaged chicken is packaged in a particular environment, and often has gas around the chicken instead of air to slow spoilage - the date is for an unopened package of chicken.

If you are evaluating it, like in food manufacturing, you take each factor into account and build a process that is very specific and tailored to what you\u2019re doing. For blanket, general rules? You have to take the literal entirely of possibilities into account, not just the variables for a specified process. \n\nIn your example here- 1. How was the chicken transported, was the cold chain maintained? 2. Did the store handle and label and date the chicken properly? 3. How long was the chicken in the temperature danger zone while it was being purchased and transported to your house? 4. How cold is your fridge and how good is it at maintaining that temp? 5. What climate do you live in? 6. What rate of decay is this chicken going through? What step is it in the process currently? 7. How will it be prepared? 8\u2026\u2026. You get the picture. I didn\u2019t even touch on how the chicken was slaughtered or how clean your kitchen is. \n\nIt\u2019s a literal impossibility to predict because there are so many variables that will influence results. As a result of this, and as a result of the fact that the general populace is pretty stupid, you have large governing bodies that have to go very conservative with recommendations. Think about it- what amount of harm would come if the USDA said chicken was good for 5 days post purchase? How much actual harm, in real numbers on a population level, would that give us? And keep in mind, the government literally can\u2019t recommend things that are bad for health- if they did recommend a practice that **reasonably led** to foodborne illness in **the general population**, we would have a huge problem, because once things get to that level of incompetence, the numbers will get very big, very fast. You have to remember the immense difference of scale that feeding a household is vs feeding hundreds, thousands, and then tens-hundreds of thousands of people. Now, is chicken fine to eat 5 days after purchase? Yes, absolutely, in the majority of cases. But that doesn\u2019t mean that 5 days should be the guidelines, which is really the core of the issue. The guidelines necessitate the most conservative answer, because of the large numbers of population and the average skill set of the population.

Wait long enough and the egg will rot inside the shell. There is a membrane between the albumen or white and the shell. This is the skin you encounter when peeling hard cooked eggs. If you flip the eggs (just flip the whole carton) every two or three days you'll keep that membrane more evenly distributed and reduce gas exchange. I find keeping track problematic so I just flip them every day.

Condensation is moisture which leads to the growth of mold and mildew, the roots of which grow into the egg.

You need to check if it's induction compatible because not all are.\n\nCast iron is relatively cheap, extremely heavy, excellent searing, very durable. But you cannot throw it in the dishwasher, it is brittle so if you accidentally drop on hard materials or give it too much thermal shock, it can snap (RIP my beloved 20 year old pan). The non-stick capability is very dependent upon maintenance and it will never be as good as a non-stick. You have to create a \"seasoning\" layer by rubbing it with oil and heating it to smoking temperature, which makes it non-stick and stops it from rusting. It's best not to simmer anything acidic like wine based or tomato based sauces. They will strip your non-stick seasoning and corrode and leach iron from the pan into your food. Not a huge issue but just something to be aware of. \n\nEnameled cast iron has better non-stick properties, and it's dishwasher and acid-safe at the cost of a slight reduction in searing and some extra brittleness. Induction compatible.\n\nCarbon Steel is almost exactly the same as cast iron except it's thinner and lighter (still heavy). Less brittle so even more indestructible than cast iron, but it can also be more expensive depending on manufacturer and brand. Woks are traditionally made of carbon steel. Keep them dry and well seasoned. They'll start to rust within hours if not maintained properly. This means immediately drying after hand washing and you may need to re-season it too.\n\nStainless steel has the best mix of properties. Not very heavy, indestructible, excellent searing, non-reactive (so dishwasher and acid safe), decently non-stick. It doesn't need you to create and maintain a non stick layer. However, it is relatively expensive, and it takes a while to learn how to cook on it so that it is non-stick (make sure it is hot before you place any cold proteins in it).\n\nIf you can afford it, stainless steel is the best option for most home cooks who don't want any extra maintenance.\n\nBrief mention to anodised aluminium which has a good mix of properties like stainless steel but it's even lighter.

I had an aversion to things without good reason (I didn't dislike the flavor, I had just decided I didn't like it. There's a book called the expectation effect by David Robson that talks about this. If you are told the tasting notes of certain food in a positive way, you'll be statistically more likely to enjoy it whereas if you're told what to dislike, your brain will focus on that.\n\nThis is why I like cooking food. It makes me understand the food itself and made the ingredients less scary.\n\nEating the food raw by itself also was helpful for me (just biting into a pepper and thinking about what it actually tasted like and why I did or did not like it). So lets say you don't like soup. But what's in the soup? Maybe you could make a soup with only ingredients you like and you could start bye eating each of them separately.\n\nI have so many other thoughts about this. I fear my kids will be picky (if I ever have kids) and so I've been devising strategies. I just remember there was this soup that had \"green stuff\" in it. This friend of mine was like \"hey close your eyes, I have a special surprise food for you.\" He kept spooning this delicious thing in my mouth that I ate. \"did you like it?\" \"yes! Very good\" \"you ate a lot of green stuff.\" began to prove to me that this was a bias without real reason.", "You put the food in your mouth.", "Is it primarily a textural issue?

Since then, I\u2019ve massively increased the range of foods I eat as I can prepare them in the way I want.\u00a0\n\nAs a child, adults would serve dishes containing large undercooked pieces of onion making me think I hated onion.

I\u2019ve got to a point where I can quite happily eat shallots that have been cut in a brunoise fashion and integrated into a sauce or a dish. \u00a0\n\nHappy to share more if of any use! Food intake is something that people feel they can comment on in a way that they wouldn\u2019t with anything else, can assume you will eat things and be offended when you don\u2019t.

They prefer bland food.\n\nBesides that I think picky eaters typically gravitate towards things that have a lot of taste but very little flavor. Very sweet things that are bland. Fried foods that are very greasy and salty. Things that are rich.  A salad is mostly water with a TON of subtle flavors and very little taste.  Try chewing and breathing out your nose and noticing the various spices. I wouldn't recommend trying to convince yourself to like things, but rather convince yourself to be neutral and observant.  I didn't like a lot of things, especially bitter things or things that taste earthy like beets AT ALL the first time I tried them. I tried them and explored them occasionally and ended up having them in a dish that I really liked where the flavors made sense to me. \n\nAlso, if you have a diet with lots of processed foods and sugar then it's going to be very hard for you to enjoy plain fruit.  If you're used to things that are unaturally sweet then naturally sweet is going to be hardly sweet at all in comparison. The amount of added sugar in the standard American diet has been steadily creeping up. I'm really trying to stay away from a value judgement here, but consider that we are programmed biologically to love sugar. It's like the easy button for making stuff taste good (I also think butter is the easy button lol. I love French cooking).

If you keep an open mind and you taste the best version of a food that's new to you, there's a much better chance you'll like it.

You could try a different box Mac and cheese like velveeta, or you could try adding a protein or vegetable to it for a one pot meal, or you could put it in a casserole dish, add some kind of crumbs on top (bread, cracker, even potato chip). If you\u2019re feeling even more adventurous, maybe get a recipe and try making it from scratch, or try some lobster Mac and cheese when you\u2019re out at a restaurant.  \n\nGo with your gut and let your inspiration guide you. Don\u2019t be too afraid of food waste, accept that you tried something, you didn\u2019t like it, and move on. Go to a buffet and grab a little bit of everything.

I'm not sure how accurate this is as our taste buds are kind of always changing especially from childhood and I've had to consistently eat foods i didn't like for years before tolerating them but I've never been a picky eater so perhaps it's different if you're just trying to force yourself to like something you don't like vs picky eating which is kind of an aversion i assume? Try to establish what is unappealing about foods you avoid then try to mitigate that, don't like the texture of something, try mashing or eating it raw or cooking it a different way etc etc so you get the flavour without the thing you don't like about it until you can try it textually.
