Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the well, putting the egg whites into a sandwich bag and popping into the freezer for making meringues another day. \n\nAdd the oil and 4 tablespoons of cold water to the well, then use a fork to whip up with the eggs until smooth, then gradually bring the flour in from the outside. When it becomes too hard to mix, get your clean floured hands in there and bring it together into a ball of dough. Knead on a flour-dusted surface for around 4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (eggs can vary in size and flour can vary in humidity; this dough shouldn\u2019t be too wet or dry, but tweak with a touch more water or flour if you need to \u2013 use your common sense). Wrap in clingfilm and leave to relax for 30 minutes.\n\nROLLING OUT\nTraditionally, Italians would have used a very large rolling pin, and you can do it that way if you like, it just requires a large flat surface and a bit of elbow grease. In this day and age, I think it\u2019s fun and advisable to use a pasta machine. Attach it firmly to a nice clean table and divide your pasta dough into four pieces, covering everything with a damp clean tea towel to stop it drying out as you go.\n\nSTAGE 1\nOne at a time, flatten each piece of dough by hand and run it through the thickest setting, then take the rollers down two settings and run the dough through again to make it thinner. Importantly, fold it in half and run it back through the thickest setting again \u2013 I like to repeat this a few times because it makes the dough super-smooth and turns it from a tatty sheet into one that fills out the pasta machine properly.\n\nSTAGE 2\nStart rolling the sheet down through each setting, dusting with flour as you go. Turn the crank with one hand while the other maintains just a little tension to avoid any kinks, folds or ripples. Take it right down to the desired thickness, which is about 2mm for shapes like linguine, tagliatelle and lasagne. For anything turned into a filled pasta, such as ravioli and tortellini, go as thin as 1mm because when it\u2019s folded around a filling it will double up to 2mm.", "Love this technique!!", "There\u2019s something g to be said about how you just push things to the side when you\u2019re done with them", "Where did you buy the board?", "Jumpin Gemelli thats nice.", "Beautiful!", "More!!!", "Gabadeels!!!!!!

Crack the second egg reserving the yolk but not as strictly, a bit of white is fine.\n\nWhisk egg with fresh cracked black pepper (I add a fair bit here)\n\nFinely grate as much pecorino cheese as you like, my preference is about 100g, add most of this to your egg mixture (reserve some for topping... Or add it all!) Stir.\n\nIf you used a large amount of Guanciale you may have a large amount of fat, as in it is totally submerging the meat. Judge it for yourself but if you feel there's too much just soak some up with kitchen roll/paper towel and discard. (Or pour in a jar for later cooking)\n\nBy now Guanciale should be starting to colour, crank up the heat to crisp it up (can leave it low for softer meat, I just enjoy the texture variation when crisped). This should only take a minute or two\n\nOnce browned, turn off heat and add garlic (if using, if not turn off heat).\n\nMeanwhile Check pasta, it should be firm, with bite. Aka, if there's a tiny bit of uncooked bit in the centre, that's my preference to use here as it'll finish just cooked. If you prefer it softer give it another minute or so. If the pasta is very far off, turn heat back on lowest for the guanciale pan then turn off when pasta reaches this stage.\n\nNow the important bit.\n\nAdd about 1/2 - 2/3 a ladle or starchy pasta water to your Guanciale pan. It should react a bit to hitting the fat but nothing dangerous. Now, use a slotted spoon/sieve/tongs to take your pasta directly from it's pot to the frying pan. This will pull over a bit of extra pasta water, it's fine. \n\nQuickly stir, now add the egg mixture quickly and frantically throw the eggy bowl to the side or in the sink.\n\nUse a silicone spatula or tongs to now grab all parts of this pan and twirl/mix/combine the hell out of it. The eggs will not scramble without the heat on AS LONG AS YOU KEEP MOVING IT\n\nNow after a minute or two if it is too runny still, you can put it on the lowest heat setting and continue mixing thoroughly until it resembles the picture here. \n\nIf too thick, just add tiny bits of the pasta water but do little by little, easy to add more, impossible to take away.\n\nTuck in!\n\nEnjoy everyone", "done to perfection, bravo!!", "This looks absolutely incredible.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/pasta) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "BASIC RECIPE\n\n*INGREDIENTS*\n\nSpaghettoni (thick spaghetti), from the God brands (De Cecco, Rummo, Molisana, Monograno Felicetti)\n\n3 egg yolks per person, may vary on size. Use quality, fresh eggs \n\nGuanciale, well aged\n\nPecorino Romano\n\nBlack pepper, grind it yourself\n\n*optional* some people like 2 parts of Pecorino and one part of Parmigiano Regiano. It's delicious too, try it!\n\n\n*PREPARATION*\n\nPut your pasta pot on the stove, NO salt. Enough water for the pasta to cook and move around a little, but not too much that it looks like an ocean with a goldfish in it\n\nRemove skin AND pepper from the Guanciale. Many people skip this, I don't know why. The pepper side of the Guanciale does NOT have any flavor you want in your pasta\n\nCut the guanciale in the shape of thick cubes / rectangles\n\nIf there is way too much lard, trim it a little and save it to bring another dish of yours to the next fucking level \n\nGuanciale in a pan, absolutely NO extra oil/grease - Mid/High heat\n\nWe are aiming for a crispy texture outside and soft and juicy on the inside, that's why it has to be thick but not too much. It will shrink during the cooking\n\nDuring my first 10 attempts I ended up eating half of the Guanciale in the pan to taste it during cooking, I suggest you do the same to get the feeling for it\n\nOnce it's sizzling well turn down the heat, don't make it burn and especially DON'T MAKE the grease burn. If it doesn't smell heavenly, you burnt it\n\nRemove guanciale from the pan, place it somewhere safe and where it won't get eaten by eventual company lurking around \n\nSave some of the grease, you'll need it for the *carbocream*\n\n*CARBOCREAM PREPARATION*\n\nI like 3 egg yolks per person and you should too hehe\n\nIn a bowl add the eggs and mix with the pepper\n\nAdd the pecorino, it will be kinda hard at first, but it incorporates well after a minute\n\nBy now you should have added enough Pecorino to make it thick enough it sticks\n\nPut the bowl on top of a simmering pot filled with water\n\nStart whisking as if your life depends on it, because if you cook the eggs you've failed\n\nAfter few seconds add a splash of that starchy pasta water, cooked down a few seconds (or normal warm water is totally fine)\n\nKeep whisking and slowly incorporate the grease you had saved, it should emulsify perfectly\n\nKeep on whisking until it reaches 63\u00b0C, remove it, let cool down and repeat one more time.  Be EXTRA careful not to cook the egg. It takes a few attempts to get perfect\n\nNow your CARBOCREAM should be ready\n\nFinish cooking the pasta and drain very al dente (but should be still pleasant), incorporate it with the carbocream, part of the guanciale and use a little of the pasta water to adjust the consistency. Remember that it will thicken after a few minutes in the plate. Eat it immediately\n\nTop with guanciale, pecorino and more pepper to taste", "Buongiorno, her majesty!", "I fucking love carbonara", "Beauty", "r/carbonara", "Damn this makes me hungry.", "Beautiful carbonara!!", "That looks excellent!", "Yumm"]}

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/pasta) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Hi Pasta Friends.\r  \n\r  \nThe following is recipe/process. I'm not entirely sure of the exact measurements of everything I used, so consider this more of a guide and less of a strict recipe.\r  \n\r  \nI started off searing 3 bone-in short ribs (maybe 1.5lbs?) of short rib in a cast iron. I sweated down some shallot and deglazed the pan with about 12oz of Guinness. I then transferred the short-ribs and Guinness into a pressure cooker, then added beef stock until the liquid was just under the top of the short ribs. I pressure cooked them on high pressure, medium heat for 1 hour with a 30 minute natural release.\r  \n\r  \nWhile that was cooking, I made a duxelles with shiitake mushrooms and shallots in butter. I stirred this constantly. About 50% through the process, I deglazed with a bit of brandy and added some thyme, and finished the duxelles just shy of where you want it in a beef wellington to retain moisture and volume. Once the beef was finished, I shredded it and added the duxelles to the beef and used a food processor to turn it into more of a paste.\r  \n\r  \nThe pasta is homemade, consisting of 50% Tipo-00 and 50% semolina flours. I used 7 high quality egg yolks and 2 cheaper whole eggs. I used my kitchen aid pasta attachments and rolled the dough out into sheets at the level 7 setting (1 away from the thinnest).\r  \n\r  \nFrom there, after a bit of trial and error, I settled on using ~ 1/2 tsp helpings of the beef/duxelles mixture into round balls placed about 1/2 inch away from eachother, about 70% midway up a 5 inch wide sheet of pasta. I then made the agnolotti, as you do. The agnolotti was then cooked in heavily salted water with a fair amount of extra semolina flour for about 5 minutes.\r  \n\r  \nFor the sauce, I rendered down 3 thin slices of pancetta, and then removed from the pan, kind of tearing it up into nice strips/curls.

Take tsps at a time of the boiling water and whisk it into the yolk and cheese. You\u2019re looking for a smooth paste. This step is NB. \n\n- There\u2019s almost never a need to drain your pasta. Take it straight from the pot with tongs or a slotted spoon or whatever you want. You need that water in the pan with the fat of the guanciale as the starch of the last and the fat will emulsify when mixed vigourously. \n\n- the guanciale should be rendered while the pasta is boiling. You\u2019re doing it all in one motion. \n\n- mixing the pasta and guanciale fat until it\u2019s creamy, you may add in a bit more water from the pot here. (The pan with fat is on a mid-low heat). Be patient with this step. Most people think it happened instantly but no give it a bit of time and you\u2019ll rewarded. I normally use tongs and I shake the pan whilst lifting and flipping the pasta constantly until creamy. Then take it off the heat, keep moving it around slowly. The emulsified fat should coat the pasta, but not be a sauce. \n\n- you can leave it off the heat for 2 min and it won\u2019t get cold.

Bake @ 325 convection for about an hour or until soft all the way through. \nCube the pancetta and fry over medium heat until the fat is rendered.

This will also help the rendering. \nRemove the pancetta and cook the sliced shallot in the fat until soft and caramelized. \nRemove the squash flesh and blend it together with the shallot.

This is my own recipe that I crafted. it portions perfectly for a pound of pasta using Marcella Hazan\u2019s famous and simple tomato sauce recipe. Rigatonis are simply the only option IMO. Penne doesn\u2019t give me the same texture and fill with the sauce.\n\nSaut\u00e9 these together adding the garlic last. The garlic can burn easily so be careful how hot the pan is when you add it. Be liberal with the olive oil and red pepper.\n\nOlive oil\n\nProsciutto\n\nRed pepper flakes\n\n3 cloves Garlic pressed\n\n\nBasil is really the only herb you need. I make the tomato sauce the day before and keep in the fridge, or atleast earlier in the day. So for that reason first step is to \u201cbring the tomato sauce to temperature\u201d. You should put the pasta in water around this time. WATER NEEDS TO BE SALTY. Add in the salt pepper and dried basil to the tomato sauce once it\u2019s hot.\n\nDon\u2019t buy the off brand cream it really is not as thick. You need to add in the cream slowly, just a little at a time. Or else it will curdle. You want to keep stirring and move slowly and patiently just to get things up to temperature every time you add the cold cream. The full pint of cream is nice but you want to have a nice orange color, the sauce can taste more milky and all your beautiful flavors will be lost. So you don\u2019t have to use the full pint. Add a spoonful of horseradish cream here. Add the vodka and let thicken for a few minutes, be careful not to boil but a light simmer will bring things together nicely. A little sugar here can boost the flavor of vodka.

Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the well, putting the egg whites into a sandwich bag and popping into the freezer for making meringues another day. \n\nAdd the oil and 4 tablespoons of cold water to the well, then use a fork to whip up with the eggs until smooth, then gradually bring the flour in from the outside. When it becomes too hard to mix, get your clean floured hands in there and bring it together into a ball of dough. Knead on a flour-dusted surface for around 4 minutes, or until smooth and elastic (eggs can vary in size and flour can vary in humidity; this dough shouldn\u2019t be too wet or dry, but tweak with a touch more water or flour if you need to \u2013 use your common sense).

Importantly, fold it in half and run it back through the thickest setting again \u2013 I like to repeat this a few times because it makes the dough super-smooth and turns it from a tatty sheet into one that fills out the pasta machine properly.\n\nSTAGE 2\nStart rolling the sheet down through each setting, dusting with flour as you go. Turn the crank with one hand while the other maintains just a little tension to avoid any kinks, folds or ripples. Take it right down to the desired thickness, which is about 2mm for shapes like linguine, tagliatelle and lasagne. For anything turned into a filled pasta, such as ravioli and tortellini, go as thin as 1mm because when it\u2019s folded around a filling it will double up to 2mm.", "Sopressini!", "My grandmother cooked similar things from the dough left over from making varenyky (big Ukrainian ravioli).

Using a flat bottomed spoon, chop up the sausage to break it down into smaller pieces and then cook until the moisture has evaporated and you start to see and hear the sausage frying in its own fat and browning. This will also build up the fond on the bottom of the pan again so once the sausage is nicely browned, deglaze the pan with a little more vodka, just enough to pick up all that flavor from the pan.\n\nAdd the pasta to the water and start to cook the pasta. Add the sauce to the sausage to the pan and let it simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes or until the pasta is cooked. Then 1-2 minutes before the pasta is perfectly cooked, add it to the sauce with a tablespoon or two of the pasta water, marry the sauce and the pasta until the pasta becomes perfectly al dente.

Return to low heat, stirring, until the sauce comes together nicely and coats the pasta. Add more cream or pasta cooking water if needed to coat all the pasta. You want the sauce to be slightly looser at this stage than your desired end result. Taste and adjust the seasonings.\n\n- remove from heat. Tear the fior di latte into smaller pieces and scatter over the top of the pasta. Transfer into the preheated oven for 10 minutes to thicken up and melt the cheese. Remove from the oven, let it cool slightly, top with more hot pepper flakes and serve.\n\nEdit: just realizing I forgot to add a step for discarding the bay leaf.

However, I will advise that I flattened the sfoglie as normal until setting 4 on my imperia roller and then moved over to the chitarra box and rolled them out. I needed 3 times, the first two rested for 15 mins and the final one overnight in the fridge. This helped the dough to become delightful and airy.\n\nSauce:\n- a lot of cherry tomatoes\n- a lot of EVO oil\n- 350g of guanciale\n- handful of 'nduja (see photo for reference)\n- half an onion.\n- salted pasta water (obviously)\n- grated pecorino\n- basil leaves\n\nHalf the cherry tomatoes and season generously with salt, EV olive oil and some lemon rind. Lay out onto a baking tray lined with parchmebt paper and roast/confit at 180 degrees until very soft and intensified. It took me about an hour, I don't know how powerful your oven is so be instinctive. This can be done even a couple days before. Put into a container and refrigerate with some basil leaves.\nBring a big pot of lots of water on to boil. When it does, add salt. Take the cooked cherry tomatoes and use a stick blenser to puree along with some pasta water until the desired consistency is obtained, and set aside this slurry for now.\nCut the guanciale into 1cmx1cm cubes and place into a cold pan. Bring the heat up to medium and fry, turning to avoid burning. Once you see the fat rendering, tip into a separate container, being careful not to let the guanciale dall' out of the pan (I use a slotted chef's spoon to facilitate). Repeat this process, I usually do it three times and buy that stage the guanciale is a delicious golden brown that is rendered crispy on the outside and soft a luscious on the inside (this is a direct rip off of Luciano Monosilio because it works amazingly well).\n\nAdd the reserved fat back to the same pan and fry your onion until soft and translucent and then add the 'nduja in pieces as per the image. Melt this down with some of the cooking water to help emulsify. Add the cherry tomato slurry and begin mixing. Bring to boil then turn off the heat. Add your pasta and cook. If it's fresh pasta, will only take like three minutes otherwise and in any case, obviously cook it until all dente.\nDrain the pasta and toss through the sauce vigorously \"mantecando\" until you have the desired thickness add some pecorino romano and more cooking water if necessary. \nServe into bowls and buon appetito!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsnpkz", "created_utc": 1743920522.0, "score": 382, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jsnpkz/home_made_spaghetti_alla_chitarra_con_pomodorini/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["For homemade dishes such as lasagna, spaghetti, mac and cheese etc. we encourage you to type out a basic recipe.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Was feeling very fall-inspired, and had this idea for shaped ravioli. Shocked that they actually turned out!\n\nFor the pasta, I made dough from scratch using pumpkin puree, then dyed a small portion green and the rest a more vibrant orange. For the filling, I roasted pistachios and ground them with olive oil, then added ricotta, low moisture mozz, parmigiano, lemon zest (super important), and basil. I froze the filling in balls and then wrapped them with dough, and when the filling softened a little, I shaped the ravioli into pumpkins with the back of a knife (and added the leaves).

Everything from scratch.\u00a0\n\nFor the Bolognese make a soffritto from onions, celery and carrots. Braise the meat, cook everything with broth, a little milk. Lastly canned San Marzano tomatoes. There are different recipes that all work fairly well. Some use red wine, some no milk. It depends on your taste. I use broth and a little bit of milk. No photos from the process, as I hadn\u2019t thought of taking them when I made the bolognese.\n\nFor the pasta you first need to cook the spinach. I used fresh spinach leaves. Put them in a bowl with ice water after cooking, to preserve the color. Dry in a salad spinner. Then finely chop or use a blender. Combine with the flour and egg yolk. Let the dough rest. Then roll through the pasta machine to get sheets for the lasagna.\n\nThe b\u00e9chamel is made by first mixing flour into warm butter to make a light roux. At the same time warm the milk. Then slowly add the warm milk (with sprinkles of fresh nutmeg if you like) to the roux. Cook for 10-15 minutes until it slightly sticks to a spoon. Constantly stirr so it doesn\u2019t burn.\n\nCombine everything. The first layer should be bolognese and b\u00e9chamel. Then pasta sheets. Then I put bolognese on top of those sheets, B\u00e9chamel around, and a little bit of b\u00e9chamel on top. Repeat until you reach the desired height. Top with any combination of mozzarella and freshly grated parmigiana. I prefer parmigiana as it\u2019s not as chewy in mouth feel.\n\nBake for 15 minutes under aluminum foil. Then an additional 10-15 min without, until it\u2019s golden, and the cheese and b\u00e9chamel are bubbly.

And critically, this dish would be perfect topped with some crispy fried sage but I don't have that on hand either.\n\n1 small butternut squash, halved and seeded\n\n453 gram box of dried orecchiette pasta\n\n1 tbsp butter\n\n1/2 onion, diced (I used red onion because that's what I had on hand)\n\n473 ml of 35% cream\n\nWhole nutmeg, for grating (only grate a small amount)\n\n2 bay leaves\n\n1/4 tsp hot pepper flakes (adjust for more or less according to your tastes)\n\n1 cup freshly grated parmigiano reggiano\n\n3 tbsp butter\n\n1/2 cup walnut halves\n\nSalt, pepper and extra virgin olive oil\n\nProcess:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F. Prep the squash by rubbing both halves with oil and sprinkling the cut sides with salt. Place cut side down on a baking sheet.\n\n2. Roast the butternut squash until tender. For me that took about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool until it's cool enough to handle.\n\n3. Once the butternut squash is cool enough, scoop the flesh out from the skin. Discard the skin.\n\n4. Add the butter to a wide pot over medium low heat. Once melted, add the onion and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the onion is softened and becoming translucent.\n\n5. Add the butternut squash to the pot and stir, trying to crush the butternut squash into a paste. I left a few small chunks because I think it's nice to bite into some butternut squash when eating the dish.\n\n6. Next add the cream, nutmeg, bay leaves and pepper flakes, along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook at a low simmer, stirring often, while the cream thickens. Once the sauce has reached a thick but still creamy consistency, reduce the heat to the lowest setting.\n\n7. Meanwhile, boil the pasta in heavily salted water. Boil if for about 1 minute less than the al dente instructions, you want it to reach al dente when it finishes in the sauce later.\n\n8. While the pasta boils, stir the parmesan into the sauce bit by bit. Allow each addition to incorporate fully before you add more. Once finished, remove the sauce pot from the heat.\n\n9. Once the pasta has finished cooking, transfer it to the sauce. Also add a couple of ladels of the pasta cooking water (adjust the amount based on the thickness of your sauce). Stir to coat all the pasta evenly in the sauce.\n\n10. Put a lid on the pot and let sit for 5 minutes.\n\n11. Meanwhile, melt some butter in a pan over medium low heat. Add the walnut halves and toast, stirring, until the nuts are fragrant and butter has browned. Remove from the heat just before your desired level of brown, as it will continue to brown as it sits.\n\n12. Stir the pasta, taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can also add more cream or pasta water if the sauce is too thick. Remove and discard the bay leaves.\n\n13. Portion the pasta out into bowls, and top each serving with some of the toasted walnuts and a drizzle of the browned butter. Then sprinkle with an additional pinch of hot pepper flakes.\n\nIf you're in the mood to make your own pasta, I feel like gnocchi would work beautifully here.", "CORRRecchiette", "I might be crazy but those walnuts looked like bugs at first."]}

Cut into 1cm wide rectangles, or ultra thin if you prefer flaky and crispy guanciale. \n\n\nDirections: \n1. Bring water to the boil, filling 2/3 of a large saucepan. Salt generously \u201clike the sea\u201d \n\n2. While waiting for the water to boil, toast whole peppercorns in a pan over a medium heat until fragrant, then deliver into a pepper grinder for later use.\n\n3. In a large bowl, prepare the sauce mixture by adding 3 whole eggs plus one egg yolk, and roughly a cup of 50/50 pecorino:parmigiano. This step, much like dough, relies on you to adapt the amount of cheese/egg based on the consistency. Grind about 2tsp of pepper into the bowl and mix thoroughly until all is combined.\n\n4. In a high-walled skillet or casserole dish (e.g a shallow Le Creuset), add the guanciale in. Turn the heat to medium and allow to cook until golden, tossing every now and then. \n\n5. When the guanciale is cooked, take it off the heat and place a wooden spoon under one side of the pan so that it is raised unevenly - this is to separate the meat from the oil. \n\n6. With the sauce mixture, place it top of the saucepan of water, and stir the mixture until it relaxes and becomes a thick liquid - it should coat a metal spoon. Set aside once at the desired consistency.\n\n7. Cook the pasta - 2-3 minutes only. Turn off the heat on the water. Add the pasta to the sauce mixture in the bowl and bring some starchy pasta water in as well, about 1-2 tbsp. Also add 1 tbsp of the oil. Beginning this process off the heat, mix thoroughly and keep the pasta moving. Add half of the guanciale to the mix.\n\n8. As necessary, add more water to aid the emulsification. Bring the bowl over the hot water to assist in the process if it becomes too thick.\n\n9.

Rosemary's best notes are fat soluble; it produces an unusual flavor when steeped in water.  It's also a bit too hard - too much textural contrast.  Make a rosemary-schmaltz oil and buy some nasturtium leaves or something if you want green stuff on top of your soup.  I also think an oil garnish would happen to really tie this dish together.

They are no bigger than your thumb nail.  \n\nAs much as it\u2019s tempting to garnish dishes like this, the impact should be the work your put into it, and I have to confess that I feel raw woody herbs like sage, but especially rosemary are unpleasant to eat.

Then there are the so-called gurus who insist on a foolproof method, often treating it like a science: the perfect potato, the right tools, always baking the potatoes instead of boiling them.\n\nAt the start of my cooking journey, I bought into all of it. But then I thought back to my mother and grandmother, who would simply take a leftover boiled potato from the fridge and turn it into perfect gnocchi\u2014no fuss, no overcomplication. That\u2019s when I realized the true foolproof method: not following rigid rules, but learning how to work with any type of potato, cooked in almost any way. Hot or cold, it doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is practice\u2014developing a feel for the dough, understanding the moisture level, and adjusting the flour accordingly.\n\nI also see a lot of fear around kneading. While you don\u2019t want to overwork the dough, you do need to knead it enough to give the gnocchi some chew and structure. Finding that balance comes with experience.\n\nAt its heart, gnocchi isn\u2019t supposed to be a complicated, fussy dish\u2014it\u2019s simple, adaptable, and meant to be made with whatever you have on hand. So just keep making them, experimenting, and trusting your instincts.", "I just made gnocchi this weekend!  I had some russets that I needed to use up and I'd been jonesing for some homemade pasta.  I agree with you that people make way too big of a deal over the degree of difficulty.  Nothing about making gnocchi is hard but it is time consuming from start to finish.\n\nI baked the potatoes until they were tender then peeled them when they were cool enough to handle.  I couldn't find my ricer (I still don't know WTF it is) so I ran the spuds through a box grater (which worked surprisingly well).  Add an egg, a big pinch of salt, and then enough flour to hold it all together.  I have a gnocchi board somewhere, which of course I couldn't find, (probably hiding with the ricer) so I just used a fork to form them.  It made just under 100 gnocchi.  I froze 3/4 of them and we had the rest for dinner.  \n\nThe one tip I do think is valid is that making gnocchi with the potatoes while they're still warm makes them fluffier.  I have no idea why.  They just always seem more dense when I make them with leftover baked potatoes.  Maybe it's just me.", "I did gnocchi alone only once (but many times as an \"assistant \" of more experienced people) and since kneading was a bit hard I added too much flour, and they ended up being too firm. Not bad, but far from ideal. \nI think that's the main risk of gnocchi, but once you get the doses right it's easy enough. \nAlso something something about mashing versus using a blender for potatoes?", "Yeah I don't understand how exactly people struggle with gnocchi. The easiest \"pasta\" to make. One time I didn't have the right flour and it made it a bit difficult, so maybe that's the problem? Or over kneading?", "The most important ingredient to any dish is love. People saying otherwise do not fundamentally understand cooking.", "TIL people think making gnocchi is hard. I\u2019ve used leftover mashed potatoes and it turned out great.", "Soft little pillow of joy.", "Yea I've made a lot of bad gnocchi by being too concerned about over kneading."]}

Last weekend I got to it and gave the egg and spinach dough triangoli a go; there was definitely a learning curve involved from getting the spinach dough right to interlacing colors, but the end result was great!\n \n\nEgg dough:\n\n200g 00 flour, 2 eggs, and 1 yolk. Combine and knead well, cover, and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\n\nSpinach dough:\n\n250g 00 flour, 1 egg, 1 yolk, and 150g fresh spinach. Blanch spinach for 30 seconds, rinse under cold water immediately, then squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Throw all of it in a blender along with the eggs and blend well. Finer the better. Add to flour, knead well, and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nNote: Although Mateo says use 250g, that turned out to be too dry and the dough was hard to work. Next time I\u2019m going to use 200g.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSeparate doughs into 6 equal pieces (3 from each color) by weight. It\u2019s important as we want to match same quantities of yellow and green dough. Get 2 pieces from one color each and roll into equal sized rectangles (make sure to keep the others covered so as not to let them dry out). Rectangles must not be rolled too thin, otherwise they will not stick to each other well when interlacing. Cut them into stripes and interlace, then roll slightly with the wooden pin to let them come together. Then ideally using a pasta machine roll them into a thinness about setting 7. Cut into about 3.5-inch squares, and put a dollop of filling into the center, and fold the squares along the diagonal. Use the roller cutter and cut out edges so they end up with a nice wavy edge. Repeat with rest of the dough.\n \n\nFilling:\n\nMix ricotta with thinly sliced dill (or green onion, green part only) and ham if preferable. Salt to taste.\n \n\nSauce:\n\nChop morel mushrooms into small pieces. If using dried morels, rehydrate in a bowl of room temp water for about 30 minutes, then pat dry. Fry them lightly in a little bit of olive oil in medium heat, turn heat down to medium low and add a lot of butter and fresh rosemary and coat well. Add cooked raviolis, mix well, and finish with a little bit of reserved pasta water.

{"title": "Another Cacio e pepe", "selftext": "Traditional method - three ingredients (4 if you include pasta water)\n\nMy recipe:\n\nFor 500g of bronze cut pasta, ideally spaghetti alla chitarra or tonnarelli \n- 275g-300g of Pecorino Romano cheese (whole)\n- A handful of peppercorns\n- Pasta water QB\n\nStart by freshly grating room temperature pecorino romano cheese. The key here is that it needs to be grated with a microplace because of the way it renders the cheese very fine and fluffy, perfect for creating the creamy sauce. If you can't find a microplace, just a regular grater should do the trick. Set aside into a bowl.\n\nNext, toast your peppercorns on a medium heat whilst constantly swirling the pan (ensuring not to burn). For 2-3 mins until aromatic. Take off heat and put into mortar and pestle and grind straight away.\n\nBoil some water to boil. When boiling, add some salt (not too much because pecorino is already very salty). Take some cooking water and mix with some room temperature water to make it warm (around 50-60 degrees Celsius) and slowly start adding to pecorino to create a paste. Carefully not too add to much at a time and make sure it is all absorbed before adding more. Add some of the ground pepper as well, it should look like a cookies and cream ice cream almost - set aside.\n\nCook pasta to Al dente and then place the pasta into a stainless steel bowl. Bring the pasta water down to low heat and wait about 1 min. Add a ladle of water to pasta, a generous helping of pepper and add also the cheese paste. Begin stirring vigorously with tongs and you will need to also \"mantecare\" the pasta here. Please google this as it is hard to explain this process but essentially, slowly, slowly, everything should start to come together and a delightful cream should begin forming. If too watery, add more cheese, if too wet, add more water. If it cools down too quick, add the bowl back to the pot of pasta water like a double boiler but please be careful with the heat as it can split the sauce. \nServe into a brown and garnish with more pecorino and pepper.\n\nBuon appetito!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/osskckdhqywe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745578970.0, "score": 119, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1k7i5is/another_cacio_e_pepe/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["For homemade dishes such as lasagna, spaghetti, mac and cheese etc. we encourage you to type out a basic recipe.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The more you pay the less you get lol", "Your dish looks PERFECT and I appreciate your method, which is almost identical to how I prepare it. There are a couple of things you might consider, though:\n\n\u2022 A microplane does produce fluffy cheese, but it\u2019s also stringy, which makes it more susceptible to coagulation when the hot pasta water is introduced. Better to use the diamond-shaped side of a box grater which produces the same fluffiness without the strings. You\u2019ll be able to ladle out the hot pasta water and dribble it right into the cheese without waiting for it to cool. If you\u2019re concerned about the heat, scoop the pasta water with a cup and let it sit for 15-20 seconds before adding it to the cheese, but NEVER cool it by diluting it with tap water; you want that water to be as starchy as possible. \n\n\u2022 I also transfer the cooked pasta to a stainless steel bowl to cool, but for nowhere near a minute, because at that point the pasta is nearly cold. Leave it for a maximum of 20 seconds and you won\u2019t have an issue with the sauce breaking.

Would it be terrible?\n\nI have embarked on this journey and have lived to tell the tale...\n\nThis was absolutely awesome.\n\nWas it better than using a bronze cut dried tonnarello or spaghetto? It was different.\n\nThe dough was simply water and semola, kneaded twice and rested once for 15 mins, ann then in the fridge overnight. Google the method for that, there are an abundance.\n\nRecipe below:\nFor 500g of bronze cut pasta, ideally spaghetti alla chitarra or tonnarelli:\n- 275g-300g of Pecorino Romano cheese (whole)\n- A handful of peppercorns\n\nStart by freshly grating room temperature pecorino romano cheese. The key here is that it needs to be grated with a microplace because of the way it renders the cheese very fine and fluffy, perfect for creating the creamy sauce. If you can't find a microplace, just a regular grater should do the trick. Set aside into a bowl.\n\nNext, toast your peppercorns on a medium heat whilst constantly swirling the pan (ensuring not to burn). For 2-3 mins until aromatic. Take off heat and put into mortar and pestle and grind straight away.\n\nBoil some water to boil. When boiling, add some salt (not too much because pecorino is already very salty). Take some cooking water and mix with some room temperature water to make it warm (around 50-60 degrees Celsius) and slowly start adding to pecorino to create a paste. Carefully not too add to much at a time and make sure it is all absorbed before adding more. Add some of the ground pepper as well, it should look like a cookies and cream ice cream paste almost - set aside.\n\nCook pasta to Al dente (like 30 seconds literally if fresh pasta) and then place the pasta into a spacious stainless steel bowl. Bring the pasta water down to low heat and wait about 1 min. Add a ladle of water to pasta, a generous helping of pepper and add also the cheese paste. Begin stirring vigorously with tongs and you will need to also \"mantecare\" the pasta here. Please google this as it is hard to explain this process but essentially, slowly, slowly, everything should start to come together and a delightful cream should begin forming. If too watery, add more cheese, if too wet, add more water. If it cools down too quick, add the bowl back to the pot of pasta water like a double boiler but please be careful with the heat as it can split the sauce. \nServe into a bowl and garnish with more pecorino and pepper and Buon appetito!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0gn2w", "created_utc": 1744797439.0, "score": 248, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1k0gn2w/cacio_e_pepe_with_homemade_pasta/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["For homemade dishes such as lasagna, spaghetti, mac and cheese etc. we encourage you to type out a basic recipe.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I like using\u00a0**linguini**, which is slightly thicker and flatter than classic spaghetti.  \nWhile your pasta is boiling in salted water, grab a separate pan and do the first cook of the shrimp.  \nWith a bit of olive oil, sear the shrimp for about two to three minutes on each side. Then take them out, and in that same pan, saut\u00e9 some\u00a0**finely chopped white onion**,\u00a0**halved cherry tomatoes**, and\u00a0**garlic**.\n\nOnce everything is nicely cooked, add the shrimp back into the pan and mix everything together.  \nTo season, add\u00a0**salt and pepper to taste**, and if you have\u00a0**fresh basil**, I highly recommend adding 3 or 4 leaves \u2014 the aroma combined with the shrimp is amazing.\n\nOnce your pasta is ready, toss it right into that pan full of flavor and aroma. And that\u2019s it! Time to serve and enjoy!\n\n(This is a super quick and easy version of shrimp pasta without too much fuss \u2014 and I love it because it\u2019s also pretty healthy.)\n\nIf you make it, please share a photo with me here!!! <3\n\n**Ingredients summary:**\n\n* Pasta (linguini)\n* Shrimp\n* Cherry tomatoes\n* White onion\n* Garlic\n* Basil\n* Salt and pepper"]}

It's not magic, just an efficient cooking technique.\n\n  \nPro tip for homecooks: If you plan to use the pasta water for your sauce, under season the pasta water. When ready to use, cook pasta under al dente, add to sauce pan, add/use 2-3x pasta water than you think you would need, reduce it down to \"nappe\" - you can drag a spoon across the bottom of the sauce pan and it is slow to refill its path.

The starch already sucked up all the liquid it can hold during the cooking of the pasta. It can't on more and thus it doesn't bind. The binding effect is purely based on the emulsion of a fat with a liquid. Technically it is not even a binding effect but purely the creamy feel of an emulsion. See for example a beurre blanc. \n\nPasta water is cooked and hot. Why cook more water or even worse add cold water? \n\nYes, at home when you cook just a few portions of pasta it basically doesn't much of a difference. There won't be enough starch in it. The more pasta you cook, the higher the starch concentration and the creamier the water. \n\nThis is why you use or re-use pasta water.", "Why waste time with cornstarch when you have the pasta water right there?", "Having worked pasta station a time or two in a restaurant that sold a lot of it\u2026 no, adding a little cornstarch is not the same. They have different properties. Not to mention cornstarch needs to be boiled hard for at least a minute to fully hydrate (not great for noodles being finished in the pan). \n\nThe difference between ok-ish pasta and great pasta mostly has to do with being able to emulsify your sauce in such a way that it resists breaking while adjusting the consistency to the correct viscosity where it coats the noodles without becoming tacky or gummy. Cooking a few orders of pasta will render the water pretty ideal for achieving that. If you\u2019re only cooking one serving just sift a little flower into the pot.

Why use something extra?", "It's better than bong water", "Even some rather conservative Italian cooks recommend adding a bit of corn starch if your pasta water doesn\u2019t add enough.

Saute your mushrooms and ham in the bacon fat while you combine egg and cheese in a bowl and mix until smooth. Take your pasta out of the water when el dente and put directly into pan.

{"title": "Bolognese Lasagna (Help needed)", "selftext": "Hello everyone! How\u2019s it going?  \nOn Sunday, I\u2019ll be hosting some guests at my place (4 adults and 3 children), and I want to make a classic Bolognese lasagna (or as classic as possible \ud83d\ude05).  \nI\u2019ve made this dish a few times before, so I\u2019m familiar with all the work it involves (I\u2019ve even shared the process here on Reddit).  \nI\u2019d like to share with you the recipes I plan to use, but mostly, the schedule I intend to follow (preparation, storage, cooking, etc.).  \nMy main questions are about how preparing some steps ahead of time might influence the flavor, consistency, texture, etc., of the lasagna.\n\n**Saturday afternoon:**\n\n* Make the Rag\u00f9 (estimated time: 3 hours and 30 minutes) In a large pan, brown the meats (guanciale, ground beef (2/3), and ground pork (1/3)), and deglaze with white wine. \n* In another pot, make the soffritto (onion, carrot, and celery), then add the meats, passata, and fresh herbs. Add water, and let it simmer on low for 3 hours (or until the meats are tender). Season with salt and pepper, and at the end, add a bit of milk. Let it cool and refrigerate (until the next day. Take it out 20 minutes before assembling).\n* Make the green pasta (while the rag\u00f9 is cooking): Beat eggs and spinach. Mix the '00' flour with the liquid. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate (until the next morning).\n\n**Sunday morning:**\n\n* Make the B\u00e9chamel: Butter, flour, milk, salt, and nutmeg.\n* Roll out the pasta.\n* Pre-cook the pasta sheets in salted water, then shock them in cold water.\n* Dry the pasta sheets with a cloth, drizzle with a little olive oil to prevent sticking, and stack them.\n\n**Sunday, 2 hours before serving lunch:**\n\n* Assemble the lasagna, layer by layer: \n   * Rag\u00f9 + B\u00e9chamel Pasta Rag\u00f9 + B\u00e9chamel + cheese (repeat until the last layer) Top: B\u00e9chamel and cheese for gratin\u00e9ing. \n* Place in the oven (approximately 30 minutes). \n* Let the lasagna rest for 30 minutes. \n* Serve.\n\nIn your opinion, is it possible to optimize this process? Since I\u2019ll be doing everything alone, I\u2019m always worried about timing \ud83d\ude05.  \nFor example:  \n\\- Could I roll out the pasta on Saturday and store it in the fridge?  \n\\- Is it possible to make the B\u00e9chamel on Saturday as well?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pasta/comments/1jrfc96/bolognese_lasagna_help_needed/", "created_utc": 1743782196.0, "score": 1, "author": "sholderbuffalo", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jrfc96/bolognese_lasagna_help_needed/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["For homemade dishes such as lasagna, spaghetti, mac and cheese etc. we encourage you to type out a basic recipe.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Oh well.\n\nSo this is unusual in that it's actually a uniquely medieval English creation.\n\nSimilar to tortellini, hence the name, tartlettes. After steaming or boiling the tartlettes, you make a separate meat stew and then pour it over the top. It is mentioned in The Forme of Cury cookbook, the oldest English recipe compendium published in 1390.\n\nIt's not entirely known what the tartlettes look like, so we went for large tortellini. My girlfriend made the pasta using eggs, as well as the filling of brown and white crab meat, from our hens whilst I made the bisque. I quickly boiled the langoustines, then separated the meat from the shells and claws. Set this bulk of meat aside for the last stage. Any \"bits\" that fall off can be added to the bisque if you'd prefer. They're too finicky and not enough meat to attempt to scoop so after pulling the claws off, I just broke the arms open. I fried the shells and claws in a combination of butter and oil until they browned, then added finely chopped carrots, onions and garlic. After they were browned too, I added a glass of white wine and the water I kept aside when boiling the langoustines whole previously, which during this I'd had on a low simmer to reduce... and deglazed the bottom. You need enough liquid to just cover the shells and then put this mix on a low simmer for half an hour to 45 mins. \n\nDuring this time you can make the crab tartlettes. Minced garlic and onions are softened before being mixed with brown and white meat at a ratio of 1:2. Saffron and mace are added, with a dash of cream with salt and pepper until it was a soft \"paste\". Mace, the aril of the nutmeg, has a long history of use in English cooking but is not used much in Europe at all, even if it is readily available, which is a shame. It's just about my favourite spice. The crab is then mixed with a pinch of chopped chives and is then spoonfuls are wrapped in pasta dough and set them aside. We poached them only minutes before serving, ie towards the end of the next and final stage.\n\nAfter simmering the bisque, strain it off, keeping the solids aside. Turn out the liquid into a blender. After blending the sauce, add spoonfuls of the cooked vegetables until you get a consistency like soup. It will be quite thin, the sauce is thinner than you'd anticipate for tortellini. Add a tablespoon of cream and blend again. You can blend in some shell if you want, but personally I think the flavour is full enough. Pour this through a very fine sieve and return to a pan with a pinch more saffron, which was also suggested quite liberally as additions to our own recipes, as opposed to merely recreating Asian meals, despite having been inordinately expensive in centuries gone by (it's hardly \"cheap\" now). Slowly simmer for just ten minutes, and in the last few minutes add the meat from the start to heat through again... during which time you can poach the tartlettes. Serve up the tartlettes and pour the bisque over the top! Voil\u00e0, a 14th century English recipe. \n\nIf this is similar to how 'dumplings' are served in your culture, I'd be interested to hear.", "Sounds fantastic. I\u2019m at table 3.", "Omg.

Leave to simmer for 4 hours, adding more stock if the mixture becomes dry. At the end of the cooking time, add a little more stock to obtain a smooth consistency.

You don't want a lot of water in the initial sauce because you want all your ingredients to get to know each other. But you need some water to prevent scorching. I use the test from Marcella Hazan's bolognese - drag the spoon across the bottom of the pan and see how quickly the sauce fills in behind it. You can get a visual sense of how wet or dry your sauce is.\n\nThe easy part is if you end up a little too wet, just simmer your sauce a little longer to evaporate the excess. \n\nYou can adjust your finished sauce with pasta water when saucing for service. You get precise control this way, and the starchy pasta water will make your sauce richer and help it cling to the pasta.", "He never watered down my bolognese", "I put about a cup of water at a time, let it boil down  until the meat is no longer covered then add enough to recover.

That way you never scorch and you never boil, it gives you at least 20-30m worth of time on a gentle simmer, so you can fuck off and do something else as well.\n\nTenderizing the meat really shouldnt be a concern in the sense that a) the meat shouldnt be gigantic fucking chunks, and b) if there is enough room for them to kinda wiggle around and the sauce isnt over crowded they will cook as well as they will cook within the 2-3 hours you need to make a good bolognese.", "The meat doesn't have to be boiled but to stew. So the best way is to start with the sauce having less or more the same consistence as the final result and let it simmer with low heat and a lid, adding some water when the sauce dries too much.", "i would not add just water to the sauce but if it needs it some of the pasta water - the white starchy water that forms when pasta is boiling.  another suggestion would be to add hunts sauce or chicken broth, but only if it needs it.", "I LOVE this question", "People are adding water to their bolognase???\n\nOr do you mean water content from the pureed tomatoes and sofrito veggie blend?", "A true ragu should see you introducing small-moderate amounts of liquids in phases - letting all of the liquid boil off before adding more.

Stage shortly before adding the pasta to the pan.\nYou add 2-3 table spoons to your egg an Pecorino mixture and whisk. This is called tempering the eggs. It prevents the egg from scrambling, starts to cook the egg, starts to melt the cheese and gives a more homogenous result.\n\n2. Stage adding the pasta to the pan and some water. This is to cool down the pan quick. When frying the guancale the pan has around 150-170 degrees Celsius, which is of course way to hot for the eggs. They would scramble instantly. Adding water drops the temperature in a few seconds down to about 100C already. So you only need to wait a shorter time to drop the remaining 30-35 degrees. Egg yolks start to cook at around 65C and set at around 70C.\n\nAnd of course you add water to control the consistency of the sauce. Here just add little by little, more in the range of half a table spoon to about 1 table spoon max at a time."]}

Spray bottle like other users have pointed out can be very helpful if you doug dries out after rolling.\n\nIf you're not cooking your pasta right away you'll need to blanche your pasta for 5-10 seconds in unsalted water.

Add the mirepoix and saut\u00e9 for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and slightly golden.\n\nWhile the vegetables are cooking, prep the tomatoes. Mash the canned tomatoes with a potato masher, ensuring no whole tomatoes remain.\n\nOnce the mirepoix is golden brown, remove it from the pot. Add the pork and beef mince to the pot and saut\u00e9 until browned. Drain off any excess liquid, reserving the meat juices, and remove the rendered fat.\n\nReturn the mirepoix to the pot with the browned meat. Pour in the wine and cook until the alcohol evaporates and the wine thickens slightly. Add the tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 5 minutes to reduce any acidity.\n\nPour in the stock. Reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cook for 6-8 hours, checking every half hour to ensure the ragu isn't sticking and adding water if needed.\n\nDuring the last hour of cooking, stir in 1/2 to 1 cup of whole milk. Stir well and allow the sauce to simmer gently to incorporate the milk.\n\nThe final result should look thick and luxurious without being dry or burnt.\n\nSeason to taste with salt, black pepper, and fresh basil leaves.\n\nLayering the lasagne\n\nTo begin layering the lasagna, start by spreading a thin layer of Bolognese sauce evenly across the bottom of your prepared baking dish. Next, place a layer of lasagna pasta sheets on top of the Bolognese sauce.\n\nContinue by adding another thin layer of Bolognese sauce over the pasta sheets. Following this, pour a thin layer of b\u00e9chamel sauce over the Bolognese, using a spatula to spread it evenly across the surface.\n\nNext, lay down another layer of pasta sheets on top of the b\u00e9chamel. Evenly distribute the cooked, crumbled sausage over the pasta. After, spread another thin layer of Bolognese sauce over the sausage.\n\nNow, pour a thin layer of b\u00e9chamel sauce over the Bolognese, spreading it evenly. Place another layer of pasta sheets on top of the b\u00e9chamel. Cover this layer with a thin layer of b\u00e9chamel, basil leaves and top with your cheese of choice, I chose parmesan and red Leicester.\n\nBake at 180 for 30 minutes covered in foil, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes to brown the cheese. \n\nServe with the seriously considered salad and garlic bread.", "Whole fucking tray in there!", "Food!

Nutmeg, one 15 oz. can of pumpkin, salt, and pepper and mixed it together in a ziplock bag that I then cut a corner of to make it like a piping bag to make dolloping the filling much easier and then I used my heart shaped ravioli stamp and food safe black marker to make the raviolis look like Valentine\u2019s candy hearts.\n\nUsing the leftover dough scraps from the ravioli I made rainbow spaghetti as bonus meals for my parents as they are who I made the ravioli for in the first place as a Valentine\u2019s Day present."]}

We have the farfalle currently.", "A lot of time it's going to be fairly hard to tell the difference between dried pastas, but there is one very important thing that you should look out for.  Many pastas are made by a process called \"extrusion\", which basically means to push something through a mold.  For example, ziti is made by pushing the dough through a plate.  Different shapes have different type of holes in the plate and sometimes the plate rotates.  That plate is called a die.\n\nThere are two types of material used to make a die.  Traditionally they were made out of bronze, but more recently they are mass produced in silicon, which is cheaper and easier to make.  However, a silicon die will be smoother and will produce smoother pasta than a bronze die, which is actually a bad thing.  The smoothness prevents sauce from clinging to the pasta.  Bronze die extruded pasta also will often have a lot more flour clinging to it, which is good.  Floury pasta means floury pasta water and floury pasta water is better for emulsifying a sauce when you add it in at the end.\n\nIn short, look for pasta where the packaging indicates that it is extruded through a bronze die and where you can see some roughness on the pasta if you look closely.  Some visible flour is good too.", "We grab a few, and save them as last minute dinners.

You definitely want pecorino for cacio e pepe", "Pecorino is just a general term for \"ewe's milk cheese\" in Italy. In this case, it would be Pecorino Romano, which is a protected designation of a style of mature ewes milk cheese made traditionally in the region of Lazio (the region surrounding Rome) but the vast majority of which is actually produced in Sardinia due to historical, legal and practical reasons. Ewes milk cheeses in general have slightly different properties than cows milk cheeses, and tend to have a higher fat content in the dry matter. This, and also the generous salt content, what makes Pecorino Romano an ideal cheese for a dish like Cacio e Pepe and Pasta alla Carbonara. The cheese, if grated very finely, will readily combine and form a nice sauce. \n\nGrana Padano, on the other hand, is an unpasteurized cows milk hard cheese from the Po Valley, especially north of the river. The modern format of this cheese is very similar to Parmigiano Reggiano, but it tends to mature for less time than Parmigiano in most varieties produced for market. Grana Padano is generally a much, much milder cheese than Parmigiano Reggiano and Pecorino Romano, with a few very specific exceptions. It is a great cheese for finishing pasta dishes, especially ones with lighter, more delicately flavored sauces or dressings. If you wanted to make a cacio e pepe that was less intense or slightly less salty, Grana Padano would be a good choice to mix with Pecorino Romano. \n\n  \nIf you can't find Pecorino Romano at your local store, I would try looking for Parmigiano Reggiano, or you can also try any hard ewes milk cheese you can find. Sardinian pecorino would be the closest, but if you see aged spanish manchego or even graviera (aged if possible) from Greece, those would all work too.", "Pecorino is very different - made from different milk (sheep)\n\nI had pecorino toscano from local italian shop and it reminded me of slovak \"bryndza\" in flavor/aroma tbh.", "When I worked for a food importer in the early 90s, we imported mostly pecorino romano and parmigiano reggiano, but also grana padano, which was little known in the US back then and was marketed as a less expensive alternative to parmigiano, as the taste profiles were similar. \n\nI\u2019ve always considered it to be a midway point between pecorino and parmigiano \u2014 a little more complex than the former, less so than the latter. \n\nIronically, today grana padano usually eclipses parmigiano in price.", "Both are strong in flavour and salty, but I wouldn't call them similar.", "Very different, not only in taste, but also in how it melts. Pecorino Romano is responsible for the creaminess in Cacio e Pepe.", "Nope, different laws and regions\n\nGrana is very floural and happy alp cows \nPecorino is the og sheep cheese.", "Not sure what your price point is but you can order pecorino, gran padano, Parmesan Reggiano on Amazon.

They've got a ridiculously good cheese selection and I'm always falling madly in love with the store every time I go.", "Do you live in the US?

But nothing beats hand kneading to get your final dough correct.  I have used a dough hook before, and I don't prefer it to hand kneading.  The dough hook is actually not that great at working a stiff dough like pasta, it is meant for bread dough which is significantly higher hydration.", "My Italian mother in law taught me a little bit of a trick when you use the dough hook.\n\nWhen you hand knead, you can feel the gluten development under your touch.\n\nYou don't get that feedback with the machine. So how do you know when the dough is ready?\n\nFirst, run the mixing machine slow to get all the ingredients mixed. Maybe 2 or 3 minutes. \n\nThen, crank it up to slowly to high speed and be sure to hold the mixer, as it will walk across the bench when the dough ball forms. \n\nAfter about 7 -10 minutes or so, the dough ball will be fully attached to the dough hook, and you'll notice the sound change to a slap like noise. \n\nAfter about 2 minutes of dough slap at high speed in the mixer, with clean edges in the bowl means the gluten is developed and ready to be rested. And then, of course, rolled in the pasta machine. \n\nGood luck.", "I did Evan\u2019s hand mix/roll approach and really could not determine a difference between that and my regular dough. That said, I always finish the mixing/kneading part by hand to assure my texture.", "I dont think its worth using the dough hook for the kneading because pasta dough comes together fast enough by hand and because the dough is so stiff I dont think the dough hook dough much of anything other than bang the dough ball around. Definitely use the pasta roller attachment though."]}
