I used a 1/4oz of regs, which comes out to about 1/3 cup ground up; so, 1/3 cup regs to 1 cup oil. It says to cook it right in a crockpot, but that wouldn't really be that efficient unless you're cooking high quantities. I ended up double-boiling--just mix the oil and bud in a mason jar with no lid, and half-submerge it in water. Getting the water to a super-light simmer was enough to heat the oil and extract the goodness from the bud. Also, I cooked it for 10 hours, which might seem a bit excessive, but was probably the secret to the potency. \n\nThe video says 1 tbsp/dose, but sweet Jesus, that shit was strong. I advise halving that the first time just to see how it hits you; you can always dose up. I ate 1 and 1/3 doses like a derp, and hit a 9 soon enough...

I made Cannabudder last night and I am thrilled, also very stoned. So here goes..are you ready for a formatting nightmare!? I'll go easy on you guys :p\n \n* I used a BUNCH of stems for this [12-ish grams] and about 4 grams of AVB. You can totally use real bud if you desire, I encourage it! You'll also need two stick of butter if using a half ounce of material. Along with some cheese cloth or panty hose for the straining that happens later.\n\n* Alrighty then, take a larger sized pot and fill it with between 1-2 cups of water, just so that the bud stays suspended and won't touch the bottom.\n\n* Place your butter in the water and watch it melt, make sure the water is no longer boiling, but slightly bubbling instead. Once butter has melted, place in your finely ground herbs.\n\n* Stir every few minutes for 2-3 hours. DO NOT BURN THE BUTTER. Probably best to keep it down on LOW heat. Burnt the butter? Burnt the herb.\n \n* The liquid on top of the mixture will change from foamy and watery to glossy, thick and slightly foamy. Once it's changed to a nice dark, slightly thick substance on top, you're probably done.\n\n* This is when you'll want to strain your budder mixture through cheese cloth/pantyhose. Veggie matter should collect in bottom of strain, squeeze it out as best as you can and let that puppy chill overnight or until your budder has hardened up. Once hard, drain the water and you're good to go!\n\n* Edit: [THIS](http://imgur.com/GRT1X.jpg) is the cooking process.

{"title": "EUREKA!  I have perfected my \"ten drop\" tincture.", "selftext": "I have been trying to create a concentrate that travels well for discrete use and I think I have succeeded!    Here's my process.\n\nGrind up your herb as fine as possible (one ounce), I use a coffee grinder that I bought just for this process.  Decarboxilate by spreading it on a cookie sheet and baking for twenty minutes in a preheated 225 degree oven.  You'll know it's done when it's dry, slightly brown, and just starting to give off a cooked odor.  Put this in a canning jar and add two cups of grain alcohol, I keep my in the freezer but I'm not sure you need to.  Store the jar in the freezer for two days, shaking it every time you feel like it.  (I'm not sure the freezer storage is needed but that's what worked for this batch)  Poor through a coffee filter into a baking dish.  Place the dish in a food dehydrator (if you don't have one use a gentle heat source, like a heating pad, and a fan) When all the liquid is gone you should have a thin layer of the darkest, stickiest, concentrate you've ever seen.  Scrape this up with a razor blade and put it in a small glass jar.  If you can't get it all out of the corners use an ounce of grain alcohol to re-hydrate the rest.  Add this ounce of alcohol to the small glass jar with your sticky concentrate, seal tightly and shake frequently to dissolve.  If after a day there is still concentrate at the bottom of your jar you have saturated your alcohol, add a bit more and continue to shake occasionally, repeat this until everything is liquid.\n\nYou now have a high potency tincture.  I tried ten drops in my coffee (with cream) this morning and it gave me a pleasant high.  \n\nNOTE:  I scrape and then re-hydrate rather than re-hydrate in the baking dish because re-hydrating in the dish exposes a large surface area of your alcohol to the air and 190 proof grain alcohol evaporates quickly.  If you can perfect a tightly covered baking dish that should work too.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\nEDIT:  I almost forgot, you can soak your herb again to get a second batch but it'll be milder.  Also, once you have the sticky concentrate you can use butter or food grade glycerin or even bacon fat instead of alcohol.  This lets you make a huge variety of edibles from your trees.

Compact gently into cup; rebutter spoon before every rice crispy to prevent sticking. Place cups in freezer for 5 minutes too cool; remove from muffin cups. Keeps 1 week at room temperature, 12 weeks frozen.\n***\nYou can substitue cannabutter for the butter and hash, but it needs to be strong (40 doses per stick, since the recpie uses 1/4 of a stick). AVB will work too - use about 1/2 ounce in 2 Tbsp butter; melt in double-boiler and simmer for 1 hour, then strain butter through cheesecloth and proceed.\n\nWith 1 g of the hash I used these are a tad bit on the weak side; but due to bad prior experiences with overly strong edible I prefer my edibles that way. These start in about 20 minutes, reaching a nice peak around 60 minutes, on an empty stomach.\n***\nThe soy lecithin can be found at health food stores or some vitamin stores; get granules, not capsules. It's an important part of the recipe as it acts to make the hash more available for absorption."]}

The flavors are simple and close to home, but it\u2019s easy to develop a thoroughgoing love for it, spoonful after spoonful. Mexican people everywhere serve it as regularly as they do flan; it\u2019s creamy and, in its own way, light and soothing.\n\nThis is an especially pretty and tasty recipe, based on one from Zelayaran\u2019s Las 500 mejores recetas de la cocina mexicana.\n\nYield : 8 to 10 servings\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n2 inches cinnamon stick\nA 2-inch strip of lime zest (colored rind only), \u00be inch wide\n1 cup rice\n1 quart milk\n\u00be cup sugar\n\u00bc teaspoon salt\n4 large egg yolks\n\u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract\n\u00bc cup raisins\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into bits\nGround cinnamon, for garnish\n\nDirections:\n\n1. **The rice:** Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan, add the cinnamon stick and lime zest, then cover and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the rice, let the mixture return to a boil, stir once, then cover and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender.\n\n2. **The pudding:** Stir in the milk, sugar and salt, and simmer over medium to medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid shows the first signs of thickening, 20 to 25 minutes. Take from the heat and remove the cinnamon stick and zest. Beat the egg yolks until runny, stir in the vanilla and a few tablespoons of the hot rice, then stir the yolk concoction back into the rice mixture. Mix in half the raisins, then spoon the rice pudding into a decorative 8-inch-square baking dish.\n\n3. **Browning and finishing the pudding:** Preheat the broiler and dot the rice pudding with butter. Set the dish under the heat long enough to brown the top, 3 or 4 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining raisins and the ground cinnamon, and serve warm or at room temperature.\n\n\n*Techniques*\n\n**Thickening the Rice:** In Step 2, the mixture should be simmered only until the milk takes on a slight creaminess (it will still look soupy). Overcooking will give you something dense and unapproachable.

{"title": "I decided to have a go at the Green Dragon, in the name of SCIENCE! These are my findings.", "selftext": "Upon learning about green dragon tincture a couple days ago, I realized I had all the necessary supplies:\n\n* Extra kiefy shake and frosty nuggies, 6 g total. 4.5 g. shake, 1.5 g nuggies.\n* Everclear in the freeze (leftover from party, I don't drink that shit) \n* Thermometers, jars, parchment paper, my own kitchen to stink up, ect.\n\n**The Science:**I heated the oven to 300, and left it in for 4 mins (until I started smelling it. It was still green, but crispy.) I slid it off the parchment paper into 3 oz of everclear (95%), stirred it, and added it to the water bath. I boiled it for 25 minutes. I found that 165 degrees was the best temperature for the alcohol, and tried to keep it there where I had bubbles but it wasn't violent. After straining and french pressing it, my result was almost exactly 1.5 oz. The resulting liquid was dark green, and smelt like weed/grass. I covered it and allowed it to cool slowly before placing it into the fridge.\n\n**Results:** Without being previously high but having a high tolerance, I tried 5 ml (one common eyedropper, as recommended in the Wu article) at 10 o'clock and after 45 mins felt nothing. I added 2.5 ml at 11 pm. Again nothing. At 11:30pm I took another 5 ml, nothing. And at 12 I still felt nothing so I drank another 7.5 ml. (total 20 ml) At 12:30 I got frustrated and wanted to know if this was going to work or not, so I drank the whole lot of it (~25 ml) so total of about 45 ml in 2.5 hours. Nothing.\nI should note that I tried it straight, mixed with OJ (not bad), Lipton Bottled Green Tea (not bad), water (just dec. alcohol flavour, but more to drink), and gatorade (really bad). I also was on an empty stomach.\n\n**Analysis (TL;DR):** Well I didn't feel anything. I did get hungry, but I hadn't eaten before the experiment either. It had a powdery taste to it, as well as the dark green color (chlorophyll) I'm sure stains your teeth-tongue. It's scent is pungent, and too pleasant-thought NOT terrible. Smells like grass/weed.\nI know people swear they have had success, and I have friends that have. If I were to guess where I went wrong, I'd say I didn't bake it long enough. Some people say when they pull it out of the oven, it's turned to bronze. If I knew this worked, I'd probably just make it with kief. \n\n**My Errors:**So any seasoned green dragon riders know where I went wrong? I'll probably try one more time at least with everything the same, but increasing the oven time until the bronze stage is reached (figured that'd be too far, I guess not. I know the heat should help release the chlorophyll which has a huge effect on taste.) So.... Science?\n\n**EDIT:** Formatting, sorry about that. Thanks for the responses and suggestions, I posted this on r/trees but didn't get much back. I'm definitely still interested in Green Dragon and it's potential applications if I can get a solid recipe. I did all of this based on the fact most people said it worked and a lot still said it didn't (had to know what's up behind the mystery.) Sounds like it's worked for some of you all, so I'll be trying/refining other methods and posting my results in the future, for science!\n\n**EDIT 2:** Found my [source](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLsyYxGBFgw) and [source 2](http://boards.cannabis.com/concentrates/82380-definitive-green-dragon-revised-updated-combined.html) for the original Master Wu's recipe.

Last batch I made, everyone (about 10 people) took the same dose on an empty stomach, but one person didn't get high and one person didn't feel it for over an hour. My best guess is that this is due to genetic variation in liver enzymes.

{"title": "How to determine dosage of your homemade edibles BEFORE you eat them", "selftext": "This is posted in multiple subs, sorry to those that had to spend more eyeball time on this than necessary. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed several posts asking \u201cHow many of these brownies do I have to eat?\u201d or \u201cHow strong do you think these gummies are?\u201d For harm reduction purposes, this is how you figure it out. Be prepared, you\u2019re gonna have to do math.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how much cannabis you used to make your edibles. If you bought it from a dispensary or you\u2019ve paid to have yours tested, that\u2019s great you know exactly the THC %. If you don\u2019t know how much the THC % is in your cannabis, you can make some assumptions. An assumption is a guess, and your guess is as good as mine or anyone else\u2019s. Dank 20%, Mid\u2019s 15%, Schwag 10%\n\nWe need to determine the total THC content you are working with. To do that, we will convert your total weight of cannabis used to milligrams then multiply that by the THC percentage. Let\u2019s say you have 7 grams of cannabis that tested at 20% THC.\n\n7 grams = 7000mg\n\n7000mg (cannabis) x 20% (THC percentage)= 1400mg of THC\n\nSo, in a perfect world (perfect extraction, accurate testing, God blowing the wind in the right direction, etc\u2026) you would end up with 1400mg of THC. Now divide 1400mg by the number of pieces you ended up with and you have an approximate dosage. Let\u2019s say you made gummies and ended up with 40 pieces.\n\n1400mg / 40 pieces = 35mg each\n\nWhat about 60 pieces?\n\n1400mg / 60 pieces = 23.33mg each\n\nWhat about if you want to make particular dosages BEFORE you divide everything up? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026\n\nI want 10mg doses\n\n1400mg / 10mg = 140 pieces\n\nTo make 10mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 140 equal units\n\nI want 70mg doses\n\n1400mg / 70mg = 20 pieces\n\nTo make 70mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 20 equal units\n\nHope this helps those that would have eaten too much otherwise. Sucks when that happens, but it happens. Most important is knowing that you\u2019re not gonna die. You just have to wait it out and hopefully know how much you took so you don\u2019t make that mistake again. However, once you know your upper dosage limit and you are willing to do the math, you\u2019ll never have to go through that again.\n\nCPT, Cannabis Pro Tips: \n\n1. Nothing good happens without a scale\n\n2. Assuming that testing results applies equally to every gram in the tested batch makes you a fool\n\n3. Home extractions will never be perfect. You\u2019ll never get 100% return unless you use the right tools in a perfect environment which most people (myself included) could never accomplish at home. Feel accomplishment with ever step forward knowing it\u2019ll never be perfect.\n\n4. Eating more edibles than your buddy DOES NOT make you a cooler person\n\n5. When you\u2019re friend doesn\u2019t want anymore, they don\u2019t want anymore. Quit asking.\n\n6. If in doubt, don\u2019t start with the whole thing or even 1/2, go with a 1/4.

{"title": "The Official How To Make 'Cannabutter' Guide", "selftext": "**Things you will need:**\r\n\r\n- Butter (or ghee - the less water content, the better)\r\n- Cannabis (trim, bud or shake). Use DRY!\r\n- Water\r\n- A crockpot/stovepot\r\n- A strainer (grape press, french press, cheesecloth or pantyhose)\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. **Combine Water w/ Butter over Heat.** Stir constantly and bring to a simmer (not boiling).\r\n\r\n2. **Add Your Cannabis.** You will need more trim than shake and more shake than bud. \r\n\r\n3. **Bring to a Simmer.** Keep heating the mixture and stir for anywhere between 1 to 8 hours - depending on the amount and potency of your cannabis (vs. butter). Stir at least every 30m - 1hr.\r\n\r\n3. **Strain Mixture.** Do this while still hot/warm. The more viscous the mixture remains, the more butter will come through in the straining process. If you are using cheesecloth - use multiple layers & secure over pot.\r\n\r\n4. **Squeeze!** Get every last bit of the butter out.\r\n\r\n5. **Refrigerate Overnight.** You should end up with a clean mixture of cannabis butter and water. \r\n\r\n6. **Separate.** The butter/fat will solidify on top. Slice around the side of the butter layer and push through & pull out your slice of cannabis butter :)\r\n\r\n**F.A.Q.**\r\n\r\n- **How much cannabis should I use?** There is no 'de-facto' butter:cannabis ratio. Do it by eye and improve over time. Some people say an 'oz of bud per cup of butter' - but each batch has a different potency and there will always be water loss if you're using butter.\r\n\r\n- **How hot should the pot be?** Cannabis boils off at around 365F (like in a vaporizer). The boiling point of water is 212F. You pot should never go over a rolling boil. Since the cannabis you're using is already dry, it will quickly dissolve into the fat at a simmering temperature.\r\n\r\n- **What should I do with the excess water/cannabis?** DUMP the water!! It's gross!! You will see all of the dirt and sediment at the bottom that comes from the cannabis.  As for the cannabis, if your butter is *super* green - and you think more potency might be left - boil it through another cup of butter to be sure.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use fresh trim?** Yes - but I don't recommend it. I've used buds straight from the plant and the trichomes will take MUCH longer to melt. The end product also tastes a little iffy.\r\n\r\n- **How do I know when it's done cooking?** Look for the trichomes. You should see them shrink as the cooking process goes on.  If you have no trichomes for reference - cook it until the plant matter is soggy and your pot is easier to stir. It should lose its green color eventually as well.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use stems??** Stems have very little THC content... and they will break your strainer.

{"title": "[RECIPE] Medicated Hard Candy & Everclear Tincture", "selftext": "I was looking for things to do with the trim from my harvest and after a lot of searching hard candy seemed like the perfect option. I made an [Everclear tincture](http://i.imgur.com/mlU9E.jpg) and then used that to make my [first batch of hard candy](http://i.imgur.com/k5nZH.jpg). Two pieces had me feeling pretty damn good for hours and then knocked me out. \n\n**Everclear Tincture**\n\nWARNING: You will be working with a VERY flammable substance. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use an electric stove. If a gas stove is your only option, proceed at your own risk. I would recommend extensive ventilation around your stove to prevent alcohol vapor buildup.\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 1/4 oz. trees (I used 5-6g of some old bud, .5g kief, and all my trim from two plants.)\n\n* 1/2 cup Everclear or equivalent 190 proof grain alcohol (Your trees should completely submerged. If they are not, use more until they are)\n\n* 2 pint mason jars with lids\n\n* Cheese cloth or 2 cloth reusable tea bags\n\n* Grinder\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* 1 qt. saucepan\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F. (*See update at bottom of post*)\n\n2. While your oven is heating up, grind up all your trees and trim. It's important that the trim is properly dried.\n\n3. Put everything you ground up into one of the mason jars and place it on the middle rack in the oven for 5 minutes. This process is called decarboxylation and you can read up on why it's important. If you skip this step or heat it too high, it's worthless.\n\n4. Heat up 1 1/2 cups of water in your saucepan over medium-low heat. Put your candy thermometer in and get it as much into the water as you can without touching the bottom of the pan. This is BAD and will throw off your reading. Get the water to 190\u00b0F. You'll need to keep adjusting your burner to get it stable. Once it is steady at 190\u00b0F for 5 minutes without adjusting the heat, you are ready to proceed.\n\n5. Once your jar is cool to the touch, mix your everclear in. If your trees are not completely submerged, use enough to cover them. Place the jar in the pot for 30 minutes. The everclear will simmer but the water will not. Stir every few minutes with a fork so it doesn't burn.\n\n6. Strain the mixture through your cheesecloth or tea bag into your other jar. Squeeze as much as you can out of this. You can filter it once more if you still see floating bits. \n\n7. Store this in a cool, dark place until ready to use in your candy. Exposure to light can degrade the THC.\n\n---\n\n**Medicated Hard Candy (credit to /u/captaintrips420)**\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 3 qt. pot\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* Everclear tincture recipe from above (original recipe calls for 3g BHO)\n\n* Non-stick cooking spray\n\n* Newspaper or aluminum foil\n\n* Gloves\n\n* Plastic containers\n\n* Non-stick wooden or silicone spoon\n\n* [Candy molds](https://www.lorannoils.com/p-8611-sheet-mold-rectangle-breakup.aspx) (The recipe makes 2 to 2.5 sheets)\n\n* [Flavoring](https://www.lorannoils.com/c-6-super-strength-flavors.aspx) (BHO recipe calls for 1 dram, I would have used 1.5-2 for the Everclear tincture)\n\n* Food coloring\n\n* 1/4 cup powdered sugar\n\n* 2 cups sugar\n\n* 3/4 cup light corn syrup\n\n* 1/4 cup water\n\nPrep your work area.

When it reaches 200\u00b0F, put in your BHO or tincture. (The original recipe didn't call for any stirring during the cooking process, but I would recommend stirring occasionally)\n\n3. When the candy reaches 320\u00b0F, turn off the burner and remove the pot from heat.\n\n4. Stir the mixture, add in 5-7 drops of your food coloring. Add 1-2 drams of your flavor oil and mix the shit out of the mixture (rather quickly, we don't want this to cool)\n\n5. Lightly spray your molds with non-stick cooking spray (have them done beforehand). Pour the mixture into the molds, spreading it out as best you can. Use a spoon to spread if needed. You don't want them so full that the divider between candies is covered. This will make them hard to break up later.\n\n6. Let cool for 15 minutes. Then put in the freezer for 5. \n\n7. Take the molds out of the freezer and, with gloves on, turn the molds upside and SLOWLY work the candy out of the molds. The molds can break if you are not gentle. Once the candy is out of the molds, break them apart. \n\n8. Put the candies in a plastic container with your powdered sugar. This will keep them from sticking together. Once they are evenly coated, place them into a clean plastic container to shake off the extra.\n\n9. Store these candies in a cool, dark place such as your fridge. Exposure to light can degrade the THC. 1-2 candies should give you a very nice body high depending on the potency of your tincture. Remember that these can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to kick in, so don't overdo it.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nThere were some varying opinions on the best way to decarboxylate so I went looking for facts.

What looks to be the best method for a glycerin extraction involves sealing the glycerin and chopped buds in a pharmaceutical grade beaker, and then cooking it for 36 hours at 311 degrees F. So i guess I just really want to know how I would go about doing this method safely, as this method sounds to be a little dangerous as well, any real chemists out there have some opinions as to the usefulness of this extraction, or any opinions would be greatly appreciated, relevant recipe included below.\n\n\n~~~Autoclave\n\nIf you have an autoclave, or a pharmaceutical grade glass beaker with threadlock top, than this next method is for you!\n\nTake 1oz of primo bud, not crushed but de-stemmed and totally and completely dried out. Toss them into a screw seal boiling beaker. Then, you must absolutely ABSOLUTELY use thread lock on the beaker. If you don\u2019t do this, its totally pointless to even try this method. \n\nPut the bud in the beaker with 1 cup glycerine; boil in your oven or on an autoclave at 155C or 311F; leave for 36 hours. It should be boiling for most of this time, but air should not be escaping the beaker. Remove and let cool. Upon cooling it should have separated into a green oily substance (which you want to keep) and a black thick tar, which in this case tested at 12% THC. The green oily substance in this case tested at 88% THC. \n\nThe bud should have completely and totally dissolved into the glycerine. That black tar stuff is all the plant material. It can be tossed if you like\u2026 or you could try drying it and smoking it, its up to you. (Thanks to Quanium for testing this for us!)\n\nOnce you have your drops, you can soak some of your normal bud in it to give it an extra little kick. Or you can put a few drops in a joint, or just on the top of a bowl in a bong. But by far the single best way to do this is to put just a few drops under your tongue and hold it there for about 2-3 minutes. Will make you go absolutely mad. The better herb you have, the better this concoction will be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/h10n6/looking_for_assistance_with_advanced_thc/", "created_utc": 1304197619.0, "score": 15, "author": "derelictmindset", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/h10n6/looking_for_assistance_with_advanced_thc/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Sounds very intriguing.\n\nAlso, does this recipe result in 1 cup of finished product?", "I usually Make honey oil hash using a rice maker boiling water to keep the Pyrex dish hot (no flame).

I've put weed into butter (made brownies, banana bread), vegetable oil (made brownies, cake), peanut butter (made firecrackers), and everclear (made green dragon). \n\nI'd say butter is the most difficult and the easiest to screw up; it can burn. Also probably the least efficient.\n\nOil is probably the easiest and most efficient if you are looking to make brownies or similar baked goods. Just grind up weed really fine cook on medium low in about a cup of oil in a skillet for 30 mins. Straining is optional, but tastes better strained.\n\nHowever for overall efficiency I would say firecrackers. Since your weed is never exposed to more than 250 or 300 (depending on how you do it) degrees, you lose the least amount of cannabinoids  to inadvertent vaporization.\n\nGreen Dragon is harder to compare to the others because its so different, but this works well too. Downside is it takes time to \"absorb\". Also you don't get drunk from this if you do it right. You should only need a shot or less to get you more than stoned.\n\nEDIT: Yes the high is different. More of a full body high, and lasts a lot longer too.", "I bake with butter. **A lot.**\n\nI would say that depending on the yield and what you have in regards to your marijuana are all determining factors with what you use and how you use it.\n\n\nI have a buddy who grows and you know what happens to the rest of the plant after the harvest? I get it.\n\n\nThe bud is what is smoke-able on the plant, but hey... *everything can be used!*\n\n\n\nOn that note, I make butter by the gallons. It takes HOURS of cooking and I, personally add water into it to create a buffer to keep it from burning. (Not to mention that fat and water don't mix so it separates once the butter is solid again.)\n\n\nIf you're not looking into bulk like that, I would say that, that is a little too time consuming for minimal amounts... but that's just my opinion...\n\n\nAnother great choice is firecrackers! They're super easy to make and just sprinkling some bud into the peanut butter/fat does the trick.\n\n**Side-note:** *Vap'd weed is reusable as well. If you have some, it'll work for this too. (You'll just have to add a lil more than usual.)*\n\n\nI will say that the weed can come off bitter after being baked and I normally use chocolate to kind of mask that taste when it comes to firecrackers.\n\n\nAs for the high, it usually takes anywhere from 44mins-2hrs to *really* feel anything.

{"title": "Bac-n-cheese. Aw yeeeeeeee", "selftext": "I like this with macaroni and other bite-size pasta, but you could do it with any pasta you like; noodles, cut-up sheet pasta like lasagna, whatever. Pasta is pasta.\n\nFirst, the roux.\nA roux is basically equal parts fat (butter, oil, whatever) and flour, melted together in a pot and used to thicken sauces or soups or whatever.\n \n* Cut up some butter into little bitty dice, about two or three tablespoons per person, and melt it down on the stove like the fucking Terminator. Whatever that amount is, remember the number.\n \n* Whisk in the same amount of flour, a little bit at a time so it doesn't lump together. Good cheese-sauce is *smooth.*\n \n* Keep the roux warm, add the same amount of milk straight from the fridge - you want your roux hot and your milk cold, so they even out in the middle and make a nice warm sauce that gets that sort of shimmery-fatty shine on it. If you want thinner sauce, less shine - add more milk.\n \n* Keep whisking like hell, until it goes from yellowish thick stuff to pale-shiny-yellow-swirly-white thinner stuff that smells a lot better.\n \n* Season it if you want, salt, pepper, diced onion bits, cloves, bay leaf, whatever.\n \n* Turn the heat down on that shit, simmer it for about twenty minutes more so it doesn't taste floury all over your pasta.\n\nWait a second, the pasta!\n \n* Get a niiice big stockpot. Flatten out your hand on the inside wall of it, all your fingers straight vertical and touching the bottom. See where your wrist starts? Fill it with that much water **at least.**\n \n* Boil that shit until its bubbles look mad enough to leap out of that pan and fuck your mother. Add the pasta. Stir it all around if it gets frothy - that's the starch in the pasta reacting to being soaked in hot water, it'll make your pot boil over, *stir it* like hell so it doesn't. You don't always need to \"add a fat (oil, butter, etc.) to your water so the pasta doesn't stick together\" like Mom says, but it does help.\n \n* Add your pasta. Pick out a piece after three minutes, and bite through it. Do that every half a minute, until you're happy with how it feels. \"Al dente\" is about halfway done. For pasta with fillings, cook it all the way, you don't want raw meat and shit like that with your fucking awesome cheese sauce.\n \nWait a second, the cheese!\n \n* American and Cheddar. That just goes without saying. Add Gruyere or Gouda if you're rich and picky, mozzarella doesn't melt very well - better shredded on top, if you like - and stay away from bleu unless you actually like that on pasta. Weirdo.\n \n* Shred it, dice it, chop it up all to hell, doesn't matter, *more surface area is better.* Melts faster, easier, more evenly. It's the difference between a single huge block of ice in your cup of Coke, or a bunch of little cubes. Which one feels colder? The cubes one. Same principle.\n \n* Once your milk-and-roux sauce is done, is off the stove, *then* add the cheese. If it's not melting just from the heat of the sauce, put it back on the stove to simmer but watch it like a preteen pyromaniac. Bubbling is okay, a little. Smoking or burning is NOT. There will be CONSEQUENCES, young man. That's IT, you're grounded for a week, and NO BACON.\n\nWait a second, the bacon!\n \nYES.

Heat for at least 30 minutes. Watch the oil, **DO NOT LET IT BOIL** this will waste your THC. If it does, take the pot off the stove quickly. After the oil turns a dark green color, pour it out, strain it using a fine mesh strainer or a cheesecloth. You now have Cannaoil.

Also, when putting the brownies in the oven to bake, put aluminum foil over it.\n   \nMethod 2: Cannabutter: Put butter in a pan on a stove, melt it (again low-med power, probably closer to low). Put weed in butter and allow it to dissolve, like last time. Strain it. You now have cannabutter. Now substitute cannabutter in the recipe for regular butter.

Strain, and then you can drink small amounts of this (half an eye dropper or less) and get pretty damn high.

Don't throw it in until the oil is close to the smoke point. I recommend having a fan on and the windows open. Tie a plastic bag over the smoke alarm if you have to. It will probably smoke, and it will definitely smell a bit. Cook it until everything browns fully. You can filter with a colander or something, but we leave the dregs in - your edibles will definitely taste a bit funny, but it seems to be more potent that way.  \n  \nBrownies are a good place to start - get a box mix (whichever one has the most chocolate to cover up the flavor is a good idea), put the amount of oil in the box in the pan (add a splash more, some may evaporate, and edibles seem to turn out a bit dryer than their unlaced counterparts), do your thing, make brownies as usual. We generally throw in an eighth and ours turn out pretty strong. Results will probably vary based on the potency of your weed. \n  \nA word of warning - in my experience, the brownies tend to take a while to kick in. Like, one to two hours. Take the amount you want, and then wait. Resist the urge to take more because you're not feeling it yet, because when it hits it will hit like a truck. Seems to be a lot faster, and harder, on an empty stomach, but it also doesn't last quite as long. Start small and experiment to find the right serving size. Also, once you figure the right size (length and width) out, pay attention to the thickness of the brownies. I speak from personal experience - if some are thicker than others by any significant amount, you'll find out later. \n  \nCan't think of any more tips at the moment, but if you have any questions, feel free to PM me or something. There are definitely other ways of doing this, idk if this will work best for you. Good luck!  \n  \nEDIT: Grind it before you throw it into the oil, you want as much surface area exposed as possible. If you don't have a grinder use a fork or a spoon or something.

I'm not sure how cooking time will differ with a smaller amount. It's a very easy process. \n\n\nWhen I bake I use the same amount. This can be very potent so be careful.

(The little buds on the bottom that suck to manicure) This is the most important thing in my book. Use a quality product to start! Lots of people I know use all fan leaves and woody stems. I highly disagree with this method. Again, I only use popcorn buds, and the sugar leaves coming out of the buds, the stems and fan leaves have a very low thc content. I wait till I have 2-4 plants worth of quality trim. I wait till I get about a QP saved up to make a batch. This way I only need to make it a couple times a year. I take all my trim and run it through my hand grinder, this can take a good hour or so. I melt roughly 12 sticks of butter on low in a croc pot/slow cooker. Then add in all the trim and kief that I have ground up. I keep it set on low to melt it all, then leave it on low for about 1 hour stirring A LOT. The low setting can start to simmer the weed and in my opinion is too hot and evaporates some of the thc out. That is why I only go an hour on low. Then I switch to the warm setting and let it sit for a good 6 more hours, stirring vigorously every hour or so. Once I have let this sit for a whole day more or less, I strain it out. I do this with a regular kitchen strainer, but I line it with a bunch of coffee filters. The plant matter doesn't taste that great and can be overpowering when made at this concentration. Straining it very well can help get rid of some of the taste. Then I divide it up in half cups, store it in ziplock containers and use them to make brownies or cookies. This is a very powerful recipe. Most people I sell these to have to learn the hard way. They will get you uncomfortably high if you eat too many. I always tell people I make them to get weird. So, lets get weird!"]}

{"title": "Just found you. Here's my improvement to candied bacon.", "selftext": "There was a huge party going down. We even had tincture that had been waiting in a closet for months. I wanted to make sure the food was also suitably epic:\n\nFirst, you candy the bacon in whatever manner you find appropriate. (I suggest thick-cut in oven at 325 for 20 total minutes.) You put it in the oven covered in brown sugar or syrup or honey or a mixture, whatever. You bake it, flip half-way through and recoat, bake some more and then you have candied bacon. Use whatever recipe you like, but with one exception - **Undercook the bacon** (*unless you like it really crispy.*) I think the best way to go about this might be to cook at higher heat for less time, but I'm not sure. I just got lucky. Anyways, set the bacon to the side.\n\nMake some batter. I mixed guinness and flour so that it was thick and gooey. Two ingredients. That was enough for me. There are better and more advanced batters, but whatever. (You see where this is going.) There are multiple techniques for applying the batter to the bacon, but before you do that - \n\nGet out some oil and pour it into a wide pot. ^(You probably should not do this recipe high, but tincture usually takes awhile to hit me and it was the morning and I had only just dosed.) Heat that baby up. ^(Oil burns, yay!) For my stove, the right setting is medium. You can tell by checking if a wooden spoon or bamboo skewer or whatever bubbles.\n\n**Do not touch anything that has gone into the oil with your hands.** (unless it has cooled)\n\n*Optional, but recommended:* Put some plain batter in the oil and pull it out when it's a little brown. Let it get cool. Try it. See if it's overdone, underdone, etc. Use that time as a metric for the cooking time of the bacon.\n\nAlright, now that your oil is ready, apply the batter to the bacon. I had a medium to large width bowl that was very flat and not very tall, so I dragged the strip through, then dragged the other side through the other direction, like sweeping with a broom, but bacon and batter. (Whatever.) Put that bacon in the oil.\n\nYou want to set out some paper plates with paper on top to absorb oil/grease.\n\nI don't know what to tell you about how you can tell whether or not a deep-fried thing is done other than google some before and after pictures or videos of battered shit getting deep fried. I don't know. But, when it's done, place the bacon on the paper plates (or grates or whatever you set up). Do not stack.\n\nNow, you're still not done. You have all this wonderful deep-fried candied bacon. Now, you make a candied bacon funnel cake. Shake powdered sugar over this mess. It will be glorious. Do it. *It's like I have taste flashbacks.*\n\nTry one and only one. Only one. It's good, right? Now, GET HIGH.

{"title": "[Advice] All you experienced makers of weed butter -- help?", "selftext": "I have never tried to make weed butter before, but the time has come. I have 1/4 ounce of high-grade bud, and about 1/4 ounce of old stems that I've been collecting for awhile. I've been having a hard time finding a cannabutter making method that seems good, because all the recipes I find have been calling for huge amounts of weed or trim that I simply don't have access to. I have decided to go with [this method](http://www.marijuanacooking.com/weed-butter.htm) with the proportions scaled down.\n\n* Do I really have to simmer the butter for 22-24 hours? Will it really take *that* long for the THC to extract? I am worried that simmering it for that long will burn my butter, because the quality of my cookware is \"meh\" and stuff tends to burn (even with the heat as low as possible) when left to simmer for a long time. Maybe I should use a doubler boiler instead? \n\n* I have a little less than 1/4 ounce of old stems that I've been collecting for about a year. Is there any reason not to grind these up and use them in the butter too? What about old seeds?\n\nI've been a smoker and a cook for years, and it's pretty preposterous that I haven't done any weed cooking yet! I've been too scared of spending a bunch of money on weed, only to have it get completely ruined because I messed it up somehow. But I cannot live in fear anymore! Weed cooking is too intriguing, and must be done.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/jrpsl/advice_all_you_experienced_makers_of_weed_butter/", "created_utc": 1314110311.0, "score": 13, "author": "None", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/jrpsl/advice_all_you_experienced_makers_of_weed_butter/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["You don't *have* to do it for 22-24 hours, but the longer you do it, the better. If you have a crock pot, it's pretty easy to just turn it on and leave it going all night long. So long as you go for at least 5 hours (8 is better), it should work fine. Again though, as *long* as you can stand it.\n\nIf you decide you're going to do it for a shorter amount of time, go ahead and bake the ground plant matter in the oven at ~250 (just stay away from the vaporization point at ~350) for about 20-30 minutes. This will help decarboxylate much of the THC, something the long heating would do as well.\n\nStems and seeds have minute traces of THC on them, so you can toss them in. It certainly won't hurt.\n\nAlso, a tip: After you drain the butter after boiling it (but before you refrigerate it), add a few cups of water to it (up to an equal amount of water to butter). Then, when you refrigerate it, the non-polar THC will bond to the oil, while the rest of the artifacts from the plants (pectins, tannins, microscopic plant matter) will be dissolved in the water. When you pull it out of the fridge, the butter will have congealed into a large disc of tree goodness and the water (with the excess plant matter) will be sitting in a pool below it. It'll make your butter taste much less 'plant-y', and make for some goooooood eats.\n", "If you're going to use good chronic, don't bother with the stems this time.  Save them for another year and make a batch of cookies out of them in the future.\n\nI recently made butter and it worked great - here's what I did.\n\nI used approx 1/2 oz of stems.  If you use 1/4 of good chronic, it'll mean your butter is nice and strong.\n\nPrepare a double boiler.  This is essentially a big pot of boiling water, and inside that you put a metal bowl (the bowl just sits on top of the water).  The water keeps everything at about 190 degrees and it won't burn.  Grind up your weed really good.  I'm talking really really good, powder that stuff if you can.  More surface area = easier for the THC to leech into the fats.\n\nThrow two sticks of butter in the empty metal bowl that is sitting on top of the boiling water.  The butter should melt in a minute or two - once it is, throw all of your organic material into the butter and stir it up.  Stir this mixture every 10 minutes or so.  How long you cook it is up to you.  I'm sure that after about an hour, most of the THC has been absorbed.  I went about 90 minutes, which was when I noticed the butter was starting to reduce.\n\nPour the butter mixture through cheesecloth in order to get the plant material out.  There is no THC left in that stuff, so straining it out means that your butter will be awesome.  Let the butter solidify if you like, or just add it to whatever recipe calls for melted butter.\n\nMaking pot food is good fun, and not that hard.  Before going into it, just make sure you have everything necessary, and know that your house will stink like pot for a couple of hours.\n\nLet me know if you've got any other questions!", "If you are a cook, you probably have a crockpot. Doing the whole thing in a crockpot on \"warm\" is a lot easier than a double boiler or on the stove because you eliminate any over/under temp problems.\n\nAlso, if you are unsure of the ratio - go strong. You can always cut really potent cannabutter with regular butter if it's too strong but you don't want to be in a situation where you have to add more butter than the recipe calls for, just for the sake of potency.", "I followed the recipe for clarified cannabudder [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ezo1o/i_have_right_under_an_ounce_of_vaped_weed_what_is/) using AVB last week and made brownies on the weekend. The parts worth noting are: this reciple calls for  the butter to be cooked in no more than for 6hr blocks, and left sitting with the plant matter in it for 24 hrs in the fridge before being melted down again and separated with water.\n\n1 female, low tolerance, average bodyweight, consumed 1/4 of a brownie and was feeling effects in 15 minutes of consumption. Noticably (visibly to myself: red-eyes, giggly, general silliness) high within 30 minutes. Full effects were felt for around 2 hours, and mild effects for another 2hrs afterward. \"Afterglow\" the next day (happier, at peace, etc) was immense and has continued for 2 days.\n\n1 male, medium tolerance, mildly above average bodyweight consumes a \"nibble\" with breakfast coffee daily around 0700 and feels mild effects almost immediately. Effects continue until around midday, afterglow continues for some time after that.\n\nNeed to check with 1 other person.

I simmered a half oz for 3 hours into 2 sticks of butter plus two tablespoons of margarine (cuz I wanted a bit extra for a bagel ). \n\nLike I said, I made cookies. used a tablespoon for measuring - I have 50 space cookies. and what I mean is I was [7] for about 5 solid hours on one cookie, and got tons of shit accomplished. I introspected for about an hour, I went out and weed eated my yard for an hour, cleaned my back room for a bout an hour, talked to the wife, vacuumed dog hair, did dishes, watched Modern Family on Hulu, and I wouldnt dare eat two. \n\nUsing high grade I think makes waaay better butter than stems and cuttings.

{"title": "How to Hide the Taste of Weed in Edibles", "selftext": "Each cannabis strain has its unique taste, aroma, and effects. But, the most common flavour profiles notes in cannabis strains include words like:\n\n. Earthy\n\n\n. Smoky\n\n\n. Citrusy\n\n\nThough some of these flavours may pair well with edibles (citrus flavours and chocolate can be a winning combination), others do not, leaving people with a disappointing tasting edible.\n\n\nThe taste of each strain is determined by its terpene profile. With over 100 different terpenes possible, there are seemingly endless different flavour combinations created and found in plants.\n\n\nSo, how can you ensure your edibles don\u2019t taste too much like weed? There are some tricks you can use.\n\n\n1. Use concentrates or oils. Though you certainly can use cannabis flowers to make your edibles, concentrates are a great alternative. They are potent, so you won\u2019t need to use as much concentrate as you would a bud. Because less is used, their flavour will likely be fainter and easier to mask, but this would not sacrifice the effects that you expect.\n\n\n2. Make strong cannabutter and canna-oil. The majority of edibles are made using cannabis butter and cannabis-infused oil. These are often made in advance so people can use them as they want. To help temper the taste of weed in your creation, make your cannabis butter and oil potent so you can use less in your recipes. Many people half the amount of cannabis butter a recipe calls for and sub in traditional butter to make up the difference, leaving you with a great product that doesn\u2019t taste too much like weed.\n\n\n3. Go for the chocolate. Cannabis chocolate is an excellent edible option for those with a sweet tooth. It is also a perfect option for homemade edibles. Because chocolate itself can be a bit bitter and complex, this is considered a benefit when fusing it with cannabis. This bitterness can often overpower the weed taste more easily than other edibles.  \n\n\n4. Branch out from sweets. Though edibles most often refer to sweets and candies, there are tons of recipes out there on cooking with cannabis. Mixing cannabis products with heartier dishes that may contain other herbs can help temper the taste of weed.\n\n\n5. Match your flavours. Whether you are planning to cook using cannabis oil or a cannabis flower, you can do a lot to improve the taste of your edibles by ensuring the flavours complement each other. For example, if you are making chocolate, don\u2019t choose a CBD oil that is cotton candy flavoured. A vanilla or chocolate flavoured oil would likely work better. By ensuring your flavours all work together, you can create a more flavourful and delicious product.\n\n\nDid you try this before? If you can add more detail.\n\n\nSource : [BMWO](https://buymyweedonline.com/edibles/how-to-hide-the-taste-of-weed-in-edibles/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "created_utc": 1619190942.0, "score": 10, "author": "LessieDerrico", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Making edibles with distillate is probably the best thing I've seen when trying to cover up the taste/smell.

This should be easier after it has been in the oven, and I used a combination of rolling it between my hands and using an actual mortar and pestle, which worked wonderfully. Simmer ground cannabis in oil for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. After 10 minutes, take off heat and let it cool for a few minutes. I didn't bother to strain the cannabis out.\n* Follow directions on brownie mix box.

Unless you have access to some extract (hash, etc.) that you can add to the recipe, I would recommend making some butter that you can easily substitute into any recipe.\n\nBest advice for making butter : Plan ahead.\n\n* Know what you're making, and how much butter it calls for\n* Know how many servings you'll likely have, and how potent you'd like each serving.\n* Do some math before you start cooking :  \nI typically use [this](http://imgur.com/iAxue) mix, which calls for 3/4 cups of butter, and makes 36 cookies. When using trim, typically a 'medicated' serving size would be about 1g. Using this ratio, I will make a larger batch of butter than I need (typically around 3 cups), but using the ratio I want to ensure that each cookie = 1 serving.  \nThis means using about 48g of trim per 1cup of butter. Sometimes I'll make it stronger... Okay, usually I make it stronger (1.5g/serving).\n\nI definitely recommend using a method with water, and continually adding some throughout the cooking process. This will keep your butter from burning, and will also help to separate the chlorophyll (green color/taste) from your end product.\n\nStrain through cheese cloth, and cool in the fridge. When you're done, the butter will be on top of your bowl, with the green water left underneath. Discard the water as it is of no medicinal value, and enjoy your butter.\n\nPS - The reason I like that cookie mix in particular is that it has some oats in it (not too many). When you make ganja butter, it has a little bit more oily of a texture that doesn't work well, molecularly, with some recipes. The oats tend to soak up the 'oily' parts of the butter, and the texture of the cookies is a lot better as a result.", "let aunt sandy guide you\n\nhttp://foodiegossip.blogspot.com/2010/12/cooking-with-cannabis-medical-edibles.html\n\nif using schwag/brick/trim  1oz-4oz\nbud  7g-28g  per lb of butter\n\n\nkey is to use water and time \nif you let the mixture freeze and cool in a water/soda bottle upside down. when it is done you can just unscrew the cap and the not important oil will drain out and you will be left with the butter\ndon't cook brownies above 325 F\n\ngood for a couple months", "I use a half ounce per stick of medical grade buds.

Ingredients:\n\n1 lbs. of ground beef i prefer 90/10 but whatever you can get\nclove of finely minced garlic\n1/4 cup worchestershire sauce\nsalt and pepper\n1 medium sized pkge. thin sliced french fries\n1/2 stick butter\n1/4 cup flour\n1 to 2 cups milk\na package of sharp cheddar cheese\nassorted toppings such as bacon, grilled onion, mushrooms\n\nin a medium sized bowl mix ground beef, sauce, seasonings, and garlic together and mix by hand and form 4 patties. While these guys are sitting soaking up flavor you can start making the cheese sauce. In a medium sized sauce pan melt a half stick of butter over low heat, whisk in flour and continue whisking until it forms a paste-like consistency that is called a reux. slowly whisk in part of the milk and keep the heat on low reducing the mixture until it coats the back of a spoon. While this is going on you can heat up your fryer and your grill at which point you can start grilling your patties, just drop them in and let them go, excessive flipping and squishing with the spatula leads to moisture loss, cook them to desired level of doneness and then reserve, coving with aluminum foil. Fries are to be cooked normally and laid out on old newspaper or paper towel to soak up excess oil. They can be seasoned however you like them I prefer sea salt. Now you can finish the cheese sauce by adding in cheese bit by bit and whisking until the cheese is incorporated taste test and whenever it reaches your preferred level of cheesyness, add salt and pepper to taste and then have all the rest of you stoner friends too lazy to help come and start assembling the burgers. Start by laying down a hamburger bun/slice of bread then butting down your condiment of choice such as mustard, mayo, pesto, bbq sauce what have you, put your patty down on top of that then top with whatever your heart desires.

{"title": "Bake yourself a present before you bake yourself. ", "selftext": "This is my apple cinnamon caramel roll recipe. I've got it started and I'm hoping to time it so that they will be hot out of the oven when my dude gets home. It's a bit of an involved process, you should probably do this before you smoke. If you do, your stoned self will get a super awesome crush on your not-stoned self.\n\nFirst, I start with this [dough recipe](http://baking.about.com/od/sweetrolls/r/brdmachcinnroll.htm). If you don't have a bread machine you can find recipes for regular cinnamon roll dough or you can buy frozen dough. \n\nWhile your dough is rising, peel and shred 2 apples into a bowl and put aside.\n\nFor the cinnamon sugar I do 1/2 cup sugar and about 1 tablespoon spices, it seems to be a pretty good ratio. You can do a full tablespoon of cinnamon or you can cut back on the cinnamon and mix in ground ginger, cardamom (my favorite), nutmeg or allspice. \n\nThe caramel part is optional. In a small fry pan (or sauce pan, you are the boss of your pans) toast a goodly handful of pecans (half cuppish), then add 1/2 stick butter and let that melt. To that add 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tbl water and 1 tsp cinnamon. Stir and cook until gets gooey bubbly. Pour this mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 pan. \n\nIf you do not make the caramel, then just generously butter a 9x13 pan and go forward.\n\nOnce your dough is ready, roll it out. The recipe I linked to recommends rolling it to a 10x15 rectangle. Personally, I prefer to roll it bigger and thinner which gives me more layers in my rolls and more layers means MORE DELICIOUSNESS! Melt a half stick of butter, then drizzle and brush it evenly over the dough leaving about an inch or so space around the edges.\n\nSprinkle your sugar mixture over the butter. Then grab up the shredded apple and SQUEEEEEEZE the excess moisture out and sprinkle the apple shreds over the dough.\n\nRoll that all up into a log and use some unwaxed dental floss to cut that log into rolls and put the rolls in the pan. Cover that up and let it rise about an hour.  Then bake at 375 for 25-30 minutes.\n\nIf you made the caramel sauce it's pretty important to pop these babies out of the pan before the sauce cools and hardens. Just put a cutting board over the pan and flip that right over. \n\nI'm off to roll them out.

Use DRY!\n* Water\n* A crockpot/stovepot\n* A strainer (We use an old T-Shirt stretched out, works pretty well)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Bring water to simmer\n\n2. Add Your Cannabis.\n\n3. Keep heating the mixture and stir for anywhere between 2 to 4 hours - Add water as needed\n\n4. When the water is less than a knuckles depth from the base of the pot, add the butter\n\n5. Lower heat slightly and bring butter to simmer\n\n6. Stir Regularly for 30-40 minutes\n\n7. Strain Mixture. Do this while still hot/warm. The more viscous the mixture remains, the more butter will come through in the straining process. If you are using cheesecloth - use multiple layers & secure over pot.\n\n8. Squeeze! Get every last bit of the butter out.\n\n9. Refrigerate Overnight. You should end up with a clean mixture of cannabis butter and a minimal amount water.\n\n10. Separate. The butter/fat will solidify on top. Poke a couple of holes in the butter and let the water drain (This is usually less than a quarter of a cup.)\n\nEDIT:Formatting", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmw3z/alternate_cannabutter_recipe/", "created_utc": 1286243844.0, "score": 1, "author": "Joelsomethingorother", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmw3z/alternate_cannabutter_recipe/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Caramelize diced onions. While onions are softening, spread a very thin layer of the eggplant/red pepper spread on half of one side of a tortilla or on one full side (if doing a full size quesa).  When onions are done, remove them from the frying pan or push them to a corner and put tortilla on pan.\n\n\nSpoon the caramelized onions on top of the eggplant spread (which is on the tortilla), then put the shredded mexican blend, several thin slices of pepperjack, and several crumbles of the feta cheese evenly on top of it all. Evenly drip a small amount of salsa in various places on top of the cheeses. Powder it all lightly with ground sage.  Then fold other half of tortilla (or put second tortilla on top of first) on top of the side full of the ingredients. \n\n\nPress tortilla sandwich softly with spatula to help mush everything together, then flip every 3 minutes or so to evenly brown the sides till desired crispiness.\n\n\nEnjoy. \n\n*P.S.  When I say thin layer/thin slice/small amount I do mean pretty thin, maybe 1 mm thin slices and like...dime sized drops of salsa.  It's tempting to make a loaded, exploding quesadilla when you're high, but with all the ingredients in this one the key is subtlety in order to get the most flavor out of everything. The mexican blend is the thickest of the layers, and in the end no quesadilla should ever be thicker than 1-1.5 cm, even with chicken.* \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmyib/fusion_quesadilla/", "created_utc": 1286255939.0, "score": 0, "author": "minimalist_reply", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmyib/fusion_quesadilla/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Sounds AMAZING.
