This has been a really challenging but fun journey. I haven't completely figured out my perfect recipe quite yet but will come back and post when I do. The final test and most successful test was created by combining the best ingredients and folding of the videos below.\n\nMy biggest problems were overworking the gluten as seen in test 1, finding the perfect amount of folds, and the temp of the butter and dough (a lot of tests that completely failed the butter got too cold and broke inside the layers). I own a Brod & Taylor bread proofer and proofed them at 77F for 3.5-4 hours. In previous tests I didn't proof them long enough and they didn't have the perfect croissant wobble before baking. Kerrygold Butter is gold and I highly recommend using.\n\n[Benny's Baked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvwZMTeQ6Po): These folds and extra ingredients (brown sugar, milk powder) yielded the best results. My 00 tipo flour actually had too much of a protein percentage and didn't even get past the dough proofing stage (the gluten strands were so tough and didn't rise at all). Bread flour is a safe go to for anyone. I also really like the method of not overworking the dough and letting it proof in the fridge overnight after an hour rise.\n\n[Buttermilk Pantry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOQfTGfNLjM&t=144s): This was the OG croissant video I've always been inspired by and I have yet to get these perfect results. I really struggled with overworking the gluten by using a stand mixer and I decided to just mix by hand. With so many times in and out of the freezer my butter broke more easily. Temperature REALLY matters and my fridge and freezer temps were not accurate enough.\n\n[Al Brady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P41vNUP_H1s&t=43s): The biggest tip I learned from Al's video was the temperature of the dough and butter while laminating. Starting off with the dough at around 8-10C and butter at around 11-13C was perfect. I highly recommend using an infrared thermometer. The double folds also worked really well in some tests.

I'm now probably 50 meters from the cart, cause I wanted to keep looking around and immediately turn around. Because this sandwich was so good that I knew that in this one bite I would not just want, but NEED another one. \n\nAnd as Im walking back, gobbling down the sandwich, the old lady sees me and immediately starts smiling again and I ask her shyly to please make another one. \n\nI'm a very skinny white dude that is pickier than a cat about what I eat (and my diet was mostly just shite food, with nearly no vegetables), but this was just way too good. It literally changed me. I started eating more vegetables and healthier stuff, trying more new things and shit like that. \n\nAnd I wish I could go back to this woman and get another sandwich. Because the day was great before it, but that sandwich made the day perfect.

These are the folks who essentially began the \"Nashville Hot\" trend and if you've had it, you'll know why. Even If you've had REAL Nashville Hot chicken, you'll quickly realize this stuff, somehow, is on a whole nother level. \n\nThe line to buy can get up to 3-4 hours long (pre-pandemic) and the line itself is a party most of the time. People come from all over and bring booze, weed, and music to party with and everyone usually has a pretty good time. \n\nOnce you get to the front and enter the little almost hole-in-the-wall establishment, you're met with the most hilarious, loudest, funnest, and most of all, GENEROUS crew you've ever met. Line guys are screaming at you from the counter Givin you free pickles and making fun of your hat while the guy who helps bus will slip you a couple of wings or some big ol snicker doodles for that extra beer you didn't finish in line. From the moment you walk in, they make you feel a part of the big, loud, crazy family. If you're lucky enough to grab one of the few spots at the counter, you're in for a time. The line guys will will bombard you with free goodies, jokes, banter, and a special ritual to hand over your Sando when it's ready. There hasn't been a time I've been there where I haven't had an absolute blast with those people and walked out with a better experience than I've had before. And I would go about once every other month, so that's saying something. \n\nAnd For those of you complaining about the cost, this picture doesn't do the actual size or experience of these Sandos/Strips justice. They're massive; and if you knew the taste, quality, and portion that comes with it, you'd quickly realize that the price is well beyond worth it.\n\nEdit: And no, that is not even remotely enough comeback sauce.\n\nSecond edit for the mouth breathers who can't read: They didn't *create* Nashville Hot.

Always test 2 cookies first! Always, always, for any recipe. That way if you have to adjust anything you're not SOL! Also you might want to watch the video in the blog post I linked above for a good idea of what the texture of the dough should look like!*\n\nIn a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt. Set aside.  \nIn a large bowl, beat together the cooled melted butter and the sugars with a hand-mixer for about one minute. Then, add in the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat until just combined.  \nSlowly add in the dry ingredients and mix briefly, just until there are no flour clumps left. Fold in the chocolate chips.  \nCover and refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes to an hour.  \nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F, making sure you have the racks in the middle of the oven. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.  \nScoop 1/4 cup of cookie dough at a time and roll into balls. Then, tear the balls in half by pulling gently on both sides. Smush the two halves together again, but this time have the lumpy, torn sides face upward. Place on the prepared baking sheet, making sure the cookies have plenty of space to spread. You should be able to fit 6-8 cookies on each tray.  \nBake for about 10-14 minutes, rotating half-way through, or until the cookies have spread out and the edges are golden, but the centers of the cookies still look soft and undercooked. Every oven is different, so I recommend starting with just one or two cookies on the tray to see what baking time works best for you!  \nLet the cookies cool on the baking sheets until the cookies are firm enough to remove, about 15 minutes. As the cookies are cooling, press additional chocolate chips into the tops for a more bakery-style look.  \nRepeat with remaining batches, until all cookies are baked. Enjoy with a cold glass of milk!  \n\nx-posted from /r/morganeisenberg\n\n**EDIT**: I'm trying to keep up with everyone's comments but they're coming in very quickly!

Now I see that you have reposted this with tiny tweaks (please put a link to the new post in that post if it will let you).  I tried multiple cooking times and even adjusted size and temp. and could not get them to turn out well (I think your new recommendation of 350 is best for this dough).  The strange method of pulling the dough balls apart and putting them back together didn't seem to make any difference (more chilling time might help, not sure, but the dough spreads too much for this to matter)  The edges were too crispy for our preference.  The middles were good and chewy, but it was hard to get them done without the edges being too dark.  The cookies were too flat since there is no baking powder in the recipe.  Anyway, generally not impressed and wouldn't make again.  I don't want to be rude to another baker, just putting this here in case it helps someone else.  I have my own recipe that took many batches to tweak and I think in the end that's what everyone should do since we all have our own idea of \"the perfect chocolate chip cookie.\"  I tried this one because I'd never seen a recipe with cornstarch.

The plating is very nice as well. 10 out of 10, OP", "Here is my recipe!\n\nRecipe here originally: [Easy Orange-Thyme Beef Stew](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2020/10/30/easy-orange-thyme-beef-stew/)\n\nThis easy orange-thyme beef stew is loaded with rich, warming flavors and just a hint of sweetness thanks to a fresh blood orange.\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\n\nInactive time: 3 hours 30 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 3 hours 50 minutes \n\nServings: 6 \n\nCalories: 483kcal\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide ovenproof pot with lid\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil for frying\n* 3 pounds chuck or rump roast cut into bite-sized cubes\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 2 yellow onions peeled and cut into thin wedges\n* 5-6 cups low-sodium beef stock\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme or 4 sprigs fresh thyme\n* 1 head of garlic halved crosswise, do not remove the garlic skin; the head should remain intact\n* 1 red Fresno pepper halved lengthwise, seeds removed, if desired\n* 1 large blood orange or navel orange halved\n* 1 pound young carrots tops removed and peeled; halved if the carrots are large\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n\n#### For Serving:\n\n* Mashed potatoes crusty bread, noodles, rice, or roasted potatoes\n* Parsley for garnish\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Brown the Beef:\n\n* Preheat oven to 300\u00baF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the beef dry and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in batches in an even layer until very well-browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\n\n#### Cook the Aromatics:\n\n* Melt the butter into the pot and add the onions. Cook, stirring regularly, for 4-5 minutes until softened. Add 1 cup of the beef stock and scrape up all the browned bits stuck to bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and stir occasionally for 4-5 minutes until reduced slightly.\n* Return the beef back to the pot and reduce heat to low. Add the remaining beef stock. \n* Add the thyme, garlic halves (cut-side up) and the red Fresno pepper. Squeeze the juice from both orange halves over the beef and add the orange halves to the pot. Taste and season lightly with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Turn the heat off and cover the pot. Transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours until the beef is very tender.\ud83d\udcf7\n\n#### Cook the Carrots:\n\n* Return the pot to the stove over medium heat. Remove and discard the orange and chili pepper. Remove the garlic from the pot. Once cool enough to handle, pop the cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste. Work the garlic paste back into the broth. Taste and season the broth to your preferences. Add the carrots and cook, covered, for 15-30 minutes on low heat until tender. Remove the cover and cook for 5-10 minutes over medium heat to allow the sauce in the pan to thicken.\n* If needed, add a splash or two of water. If a thicker gravy is desired, add a flour slurry to the pan and whisk it in and allow it took for an additional 5-10 minutes to thicken.\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Ladle the beef stew over mashed potatoes or your accompaniment of choice. Garnish with parsley, if desired.

Preheat the oven for 375\u02daF (190\u02daC).\r\n2. Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately \u00b9\u2044\u2081\u2086-inch (1-mm) rounds, then set aside.\r\n3. Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Saut\u00e9 the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.\r\n4. Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the middle of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.\r\n5. Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.\r\n6. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.\r\n7. Serve while hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day--cover with foil and reheat in a 350\u02daF (180\u02daC) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.\r\n8.

Here it is.**\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nHeston\u2019s ultimate roast potatoes \n\n* 2kg large Maris Piper potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, roughly the same size \n\n* 200g jar Cooks\u2019 Ingredients Beef Dripping 250ml \n\n* extra virgin olive oil \n\n* 6 sprigs rosemary \n\n* 6 sprigs thyme \n\n* 12 cloves garlic, bashed in their skins\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC\n\n2. Put the potatoes in a colander and hold under running water for 3-5 minutes to wash off the starch, or just until the water runs clear. Drain, place in a large pan, then cover with cold water. Don\u2019t add salt. \n\n3. Bring to the boil, then simmer until very soft and starting to crumble and crack (about 25 minutes). Set a wire rack over a tray. Carefully lift the potatoes from the water using a slotted spoon, and transfer them to the rack. Leave to cool completely; they will firm up. This can be done the day ahead, and then the potatoes covered and chilled overnight, if you prefer.\n\n4. Put the beef dripping and olive oil in a roasting tray approx. 35x25cm, large enough to hold all the potatoes in a single layer. Set the tray on the hob (or in the oven for 15 minutes), and let the dripping melt into the oil. \n\n5. Once melted, the fat should come about 0.75-1cm up the sides of the tray. Very carefully place the potatoes in the hot fat. \n\n6. Stir to coat, then place in the oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, gently turning every 20 minutes, until crisp and golden. When you think they\u2019re ready, add another 20 minutes cooking on top, until the potatoes are deeply golden and very crisp.\n\n7. Add the garlic, rosemary and thyme to the potatoes, stir well and cook for a final 5 minutes. \n\n8. Remove the potatoes from the oven, drain on kitchen paper and sprinkle with sea salt to serve. Remove the garlic cloves before eating.\n\n[Source](https://www.waitrose.com/content/waitrose/en/home/recipes/recipe_directory/h/heston-s-ultimateroastpotatoes.A4.html)", "fade chase liquid pause numerous salt depend tie memory snatch\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*", "The best thing from the recipe was the boiling stage, it asks you to boil them until they are pretty much falling apart! \nDo not toss in a colander after because they will fall apart into mashed potato.

Leave apartment \n2. Ultimate Swiss roll\n\nETA: and you clearly chose correctly", "**Recipe formatted for easier viewing**\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n*For the cake:*\n\n* 3/4 cup all-purpose flour\n\n* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n* 1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n\n* 3 extra-large eggs\n\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n\n* 1/3 cup water\n\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n* nonstick cooking spray\n\n* confectioners\u2019 sugar for sifting\n\n*For the vanilla buttercream:*\n\n* 12 tablespoons (or 1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature\n\n* 4 1/2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar\n\n* 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n\n* 2 tablespoons whole milk\n\n*For the chocolate buttercream:*\n\n* 1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature\n\n* 3 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar\n\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n* 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder\n\n* 2 tablespoons whole milk\n\n*For decoration:*\n\n* milk or dark chocolate shavings (optional)\n\n* edible gold leaf (optional)\n\n**Directions**\n\n*For the cake:*\n\n1.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a jelly roll sheet pan (10 x 15-inch) with nonstick cooking spray. Line the pan with parchment paper\u2014leave enough for an overhang to help get the cake out after baking\u2014and spray with cooking spray again. Set aside.\n\n2. In a medium size bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n\n3. Place eggs in a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and mix on high speed until eggs are thick and a light yellow in color.\n\n4. Slowly add in sugar and whip for 4-5 minutes, until the sugar dissolves and creates volume in the egg mixture. Then, add the water and vanilla extract on low speed.\n\n5. Slowly add the flour mixture and continue to mix until combined. Do not over-beat. Pour mixture into pan, making sure to cover every inch of the pan. Tap the pan against the counter a few times to release any air bubbles.\n\n6. Bake cake for 13-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. While the cake is baking, sift a good amount of confectioners\u2019 sugar onto a clean dish towel, covering every inch of the towel evenly.\n\n7. When the cake is finished baking, remove from the oven and use a paring knife to cut along the side of the edges. While the cake is still hot, flip the pan over onto the clean dish towel with the confectioners\u2019 sugar. Carefully remove the parchment paper and roll the cake with a dish towel from one short end to the other short end. Allow to cool for 45 minutes or until cooled completely. \n\n*For the vanilla buttercream:*\n\n1. Combine all ingredients in a stand mixer on low speed and mix until combined. \n\n2. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Increase speed to high and mix for 5 minutes, or until the buttercream is fluffy and white in color. \n\n3. Transfer 1 cup of buttercream to a pastry bag with a large star tip. Set aside.\n\n*For the chocolate buttercream:*\n\n1. Combine all ingredients in a stand mixer on low speed and mix until combined.\n\n2. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Increase speed to high and mix for 5 minutes, or until the buttercream is fluffy. Set Aside.\n \n*For the assembly:*\n\n1. Unroll cooled cake and place vanilla buttercream on the inside of the cake, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. The vanilla buttercream should measure \u00bd-inch in height. \n \n2. Carefully remove the dish towel, and roll the cake. Place the cake, seam side down, onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.\n \n3. Place the cake in the refrigerator and allow it to set for 20 minutes.\n \n4. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and cover the outside with the chocolate buttercream using an offset spatula (the back of a spoon or a butter knife are good substitutes). Covering the bottom of the cake with the chocolate buttercream is entirely optional.\n \n5. Use the spatula to create designs on cake. Transfer to the refrigerator and allow to set for 20 minutes.\n \n6. Remove the cake from the refrigerator and begin to decorate the top of the cake with the pastry bag with the star tip filled with the reserved vanilla buttercream. Pipe 4 rows of dollops on the top center of the cake going lengthwise down the cake.\n \n7. Using a vegetable peeler or a grater, shred milk or dark chocolate over the vanilla buttercream dollops. Gold leaf is optional.\n \n8. Refrigerate until ready to serve and then allow to sit at room temperature for an hour before consuming.

I was scared what he was going to do to me so I\u2019m booking it all to hell bumping into people then this guy out of nowhere just trips me and I hit my head on this dumpster but I still got the cheesesteak in my hand and I\u2019m thinking \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t eat this whole sandwich before this crack head catches up to me\u201d So I\u2019m just mowing down this cheesesteak with a gash on my forehead and I get to about halfway through until this crack head grabs some jumper cables from the pile of rubbish im lying in and starts whipping me to hell the exact same way my dad use to beat me with jumper cables for the past 33 years. So I just drop what\u2019s left of the sandwich and run down the alley until I was able to flag down a taxi that took me to the ER where I had to get 23 stitches, and a stint for a broken finger.

{"title": "Roasted Red Pepper Ravioli", "selftext": "[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-ravioli)\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the Ravioli Dough:\n\n- 300g all-purpose flour\n- 100g semolina flour\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 200ml warm water\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n\nFor the Ravioli Filling:\n\n- 200g firm tofu, crumbled\n- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast\n- 1 clove garlic, minced\n- 1 tbsp lemon juice\n- Salt and black pepper, to taste\n\nFor the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce:\n\n- 3 large red bell peppers\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 200ml vegan cream cheese\n- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast\n- 1 tsp smoked paprika\n- 1 tsp dried oregano\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- 1 tsp lemon juice\n\nFor Garnish:\n\n- Fresh basil leaves, chopped\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C. Cut the red bell peppers in half and remove the seeds and membranes. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cut side down. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the skin is charred and blistered. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl and cover with cling film for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and set the roasted peppers aside.\n\n2. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for 5-6 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\n3. Add the roasted red peppers to a blender, along with the saut\u00e9ed onion and garlic. Spoon in the vegan cream cheese, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika, and dried oregano. Blend until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Season with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.\n\n4. To make the ravioli dough, combine the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the warm water and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling film and let it rest for 20 minutes.\n\n5. While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. In a medium bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, nutritional yeast, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.\n\n6. Once the dough has rested, divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface until it is very thin (about 2mm thick). Place small spoonfuls of the filling, about 4cm apart, on one sheet of the rolled dough. Place the second sheet of dough over the top, pressing around each mound of filling to seal. Use a knife or ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli pieces, ensuring the edges are sealed well.\n\n7. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli in batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain and set aside.\n\n8. Pour the blended roasted red pepper sauce back into the frying pan and warm it over low heat. Add the cooked ravioli to the sauce, gently tossing to coat each piece in the creamy sauce.\n\n9. Divide the creamy ravioli between four bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves for a burst of colour and flavour.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/5q23ny2qjo2e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1732380190.0, "score": 18004, "author": "Whiterabbit2000", "num_comments": 106, "permalink": "/r/FoodPorn/comments/1gy3u1a/roasted_red_pepper_ravioli/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["\u201cWe eat first with our eyes\u201d - Apicius \ud83d\ude0b\ud83e\udd29", "Ok stop it this is actual porn.", "Damn this looks amazing!", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Well I wasn't hungry... then I saw this.", "# Interesting combination \ud83d\ude0bDefinitely tasty", "My mouth is watering!", "Thank you so much for the lovely picture and recipe with instructions!", "Please let us know when you open (or include this deliciousness in) your own restaurant! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "I just drooled all over my phone! \ud83e\udd24", "Recipe?", "Insanely delicious looking!", "Tr\u00e8s sexy.", "OMG, this looks divine!", "That looks incredible I don\u2019t even eat peppers and that looks delicious as frack", "This, I fear, would cure me", "I love ravioli, What I dont love is a dish of ravioli usually only has 6 ravioli.

He loves dinosaurs more than anything, and I love them too so I made a realistic dinosaur fossil cake set up like a dig site so that he could discover the fossils himself before eating the cake. \n\nFor those who don't know, **marzipan** is a decorating material made from finely ground almonds and sugar--similar to fondant in texture, but IMO it tastes much better. I prefer using marzipan to fondant, and in this case there were no kids with nut allergies so I figured it would be the better choice. \n\nRecipe:\n\n**Cake**\n\n1 cup baking cocoa\n\n1 cup boiling water (you can also use strong black coffee)\n\n1 cup butter, softened\n\n2 cups sugar\n\n4 eggs, room temp\n\n1 tbs vanilla extract\n\n3 cups cake flour\n\n2 teaspoons baking soda\n\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream \n\nDissolve cocoa in boiling water; cool. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition. Add cocoa mixture and mix well.\n\nPour into greased, parchment-lined rectangular pan and bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes. \n\nThe frosting is **cocoa buttercream:**\n\n3 sticks soft butter\n\n1/2 cup cocoa\n\n4 cups powdered sugar\n\n1/3 cup whipping cream\n\n1 tsp vanilla\n\nbeat butter on high until it starts to fluff. Lower speed and beat in sugar and cocoa until incorporated. Increase speed and add in cream in a thin stream. Increase speed more and whip until the frosting is fluffy. Take breaks to scrape down the bowl as needed.\n\nThe dinosaur skull and bone took exactly one 7-ounce tube of marzipan. I freestyle sculpted it onto parchment paper and then peeled it off and transferred it to the top of the cake--it held together surprisingly well. The \"dirt\" is chocolate graham crackers put through the food processed to different degrees of fineness. Then my son got to discover the fossils with a pastry brush. \n\nYes it's very messy--crumbs will get on the floor and table. But it's worth all that for the fun of the activity. We served it with ice cream, which paired well with all the crumbs, and the cake was really moist. The other kids at the party even liked the marzipan.\n\nThis recipe made enough to cut into 20 servings (although obviously that varies a bit based on how big you like your pieces).

{"title": "I made hazelnut-shaped mousse cakes. They're filled with caramel, hazelnut sponge discs, and hazelnut praline!", "selftext": "", "url": "https://i.imgur.com/NQoJQtr.jpg", "created_utc": 1607696660.0, "score": 17130, "author": "Fluffy_Munchkin", "num_comments": 213, "permalink": "/r/FoodPorn/comments/kb3phd/i_made_hazelnutshaped_mousse_cakes_theyre_filled/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Did anyone else think it was a coconut", "this is insane", "Are you a fan of Bruno Albouze?", "[Cutting the hazelnut:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syVevrHFY48&ab_channel=FluffyMunckin)\n\n[Batch shot, minus the sacrifice:](https://i.imgur.com/JYo9ZPN.jpg)\n\nI used [Bruno Albouze's recipe](https://brunoalbouze.com/recipe/hazelnut-shaped-dessert/) to create this. It's not my recipe, but I'm going to type it up to make it easier to follow. I love Bruno, but he gives instructions, not tutorials; he tends to assume you already know how to do half the things, and just tells you what to do, rather than showing you how.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the components (not including the supplies) are very expensive for this project. It uses ~600g hazelnuts, a ton of gold luster dust, and between that, the cocoa butter, and the good-quality chocolate I used, my wallet kinda hates me.\n\n#**Recipe for Cedric Grolet's La Noisette** \n\n(Bruno claims it makes 10 servings. Maybe his molds are of different sizes, or some other variable, but I only managed to squeeze out 7. The ganache is the limiting factor, followed by the caramel.)\n\n**Toasted Hazelnuts**\n\n600g raw hazelnuts\n\nToast hazelnuts at 350F for 8-12 minutes, or until golden brown and fragrant. Let cool.\n\n**Hazelnut Butter**\n\n150g toasted hazelnuts\n\n10g neutral oil (if necessary)\n\nBlend toasted hazelnuts in a food processor until it turns to a thick paste. Add oil if necessary to achieve a smooth consistency (I didn't need to).\n\n**Praline**\n\n300g toasted hazelnuts\n\n180g sugar\n\n2g salt/fleur de sel\n\nMake a dry caramel with the sugar. Toss in hazelnuts, coat the nuts in the caramel mixture, and transfer to a silicone mat to cool. Break into chunks, blend in a processor until it turns to paste. Add salt, blend again briefly.\n\n**Hazelnut Ganache Montee**\n\n6g gelatin (I used powdered, bloomed in 30g cold water)\n\n200g whole milk\n\n80g toasted hazelnuts\n\n125g white chocolate\n\n80g hazelnut butter\n\n500g cream, divided\n\nHeat milk just below a boil, add hazelnuts, and use an immersion blender to homogenize the mixture. Cover the mixture and let infuse for 20 minutes (NOTE: I deviated from the recipe here, by doing an overnight infusion to increase the flavor.)\n\nPlace a sieve over a saucepan, pour mixture into sieve, and use a rubber spatula to press down on the mixture to extract the liquid into the pan. (There was about a 50% absorption, so you'll probably be left with ~100g hazelnut-flavored milk.)\n\nAdd 250g heavy cream to the extraction, and heat to a near-boil. Pour over chopped white chocolate, blend. Add gelatin, blend. Add hazelnut butter, blend. Add remaining 250g cream, blend. Chill completely.\n\n**Hazelnut Sponge**\n\n50g softened butter\n\n50g hazelnut paste\n\n80g egg yolks (~4-5, egg-dependent)\n\n30g sugar\n\n90g egg whites + 50g sugar (I also added 1/8tsp cream of tartar here, for the meringue)\n\n6g AP flour\n\n6g cornstarch\n\n50g crushed hazelnuts\n\nCream butter and the hazelnut paste. Beat the yolks and sugar in a separate bowl, then combine both mixtures. Beat egg whites (with tartar if using) on medium speed until they begin to foam. Gradually add sugar, increase the speed to high, and beat until stiff peaks. Fold meringue into the batter. Spread evenly on a small baking tray lined with parchment. Evenly sprinkle chopped/crushed hazelnuts over the sponge, and bake at 350F for ~18 minutes. (NOTE: I deviated again and pulled mine at 15m, it looked like it was going to get a little too brown. This is fine, everyone's oven is different. Just keep your eye on it.)\n\n**Hazelnut Praline Insert**\n\nUse a 3cm cookie cutter to punch out sponge discs. (Note: For maximum hazelnut flavor, make sure the discs have a nice concentration of the sprinkled hazelnuts on top.) Fill the bottom of a mini half-sphere silicone mold with praline paste, place a disc inside, then top with praline. Freeze completely.\n\n**Soft Caramel**\n\n165g heavy cream\n\n45g whole milk\n\n25g sugar (Note: I used some vanilla sugar for this part I had on hand just to slightly amp up the vanilla flavor profile in the caramel)\n\n25g corn syrup\n\n2g fleur de sel/kosher salt \n\n5g vanilla bean paste\n\n75g sugar \n\n100g corn syrup\n\n55g unsalted butter\n\nHeat up cream, milk, the 25g of both sugar and corn syrup, salt, and vanilla paste. Keep mixture hot, but not boiling. Heat the 100g corn syrup and 75g sugar to the caramel stage (I made a medium caramel, ~355-360F). Remove caramel from heat, and slowly, carefully, pour the cream mixture into the caramel to \"deglaze\" the caramel. Stir to combine, and then add the caramel/cream mixture back to the saucepan and cook to 221F (I imagine this is to evaporate some degree of liquid to make the caramel thicker.). Pass through a sieve, let cool to 158F, add the butter, and homogenize with an immersion blender. Let the mixture cool.\n\n**ASSEMBLY PT I**\n\nAdd 50g of whole milk to the chilled caramel and mix.\n\n(Another note: I used large and small half-sphere molds. I don't have the $65 bougie professional mold Bruno sports, so I made do with what I had. This recipe reflects how I made the hazelnut, so I'm giving instructions as per the half-mold.)\n\nWhip the hazelnut ganache to smooth it out. Fill a half-sphere with the mousse, and place a frozen praline insert in the center. Smooth out the top, and reserve the excess ganache. (Keeping the top flat makes attaching the half-spheres much easier.) Repeat the same process with another half-sphere mold, only freeze the mold for 30 minutes, then scoop out a well in the center (~the same size as the praline insert) and fill with the soft caramel. Again, reserve the ganache. Repeat for both with the remaining molds, and freeze completely (4-6 hours, or overnight). \n\nUnmold, and wearing gloves, firmly press both halves together MAKING SURE YOU REMEMBER WHICH SIDE HAS THE CARAMEL. Caramel side must be facing up. Make a slight mark or something on the top of that dome, save yourself the headache. Fill in any gaps with a tiny amount of ganache, and refreeze for 30-60 minutes. Shave off the bottom with a microplane to allow the nut to sit without wobbling. Pipe out a dollop of ganache on top of each sphere (caramel up!), and using a small offset spatula, [contour the dollop to the sphere in the shape of a hazelnut.](https://i.imgur.com/01Qv2vf.jpg)Freeze again. Remove, and using your thumb, smooth out the surface of the nut. Imperfections will show up on your glaze.\n\n**Enrobage**\n\n300g milk chocolate\n\n300g cocoa butter (If you can get deodorized cocoa butter, I recommend that. Regular is VERY strong in both scent and taste, and will obliterate the taste of the milk chocolate.)\n\nHeat cocoa butter to 175F, pour over chopped milk chocolate. Blend well, pass through a sieve, and reserve. Glaze when it reaches a temp of 113F.\n\n**ASSEMBLY PTII**\n\nRemove nuts from the freezer, and stick a bamboo skewer in the bottom. Make sure it's secure, nothing's worse than having it slip off while glazing. Dip each cake into the glaze, ensuring it's completely submerged. [Here's the man himself performing this step:](https://youtu.be/hMHhXEVSKLM?t=42) I suggest copying his motions exactly to ensure an even, smooth coating. The glaze will set very quickly, perhaps after 10 seconds max.\n\nBrush sides with a wire brush. Or, if you don't have one, spend 20 minutes [scoring the sides with a freaking paring knife.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=out_4foT_I4) (Don't go too high up, and ensure you're using a gentle touch so as to not crack the shell.)\n\n[Brush nuts with gold luster dust.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csuZP4WQf90&ab_channel=FluffyMunckin) If you want, you can forgo brushing the bottom, it'll be covered with chocolate. And luster dust ain't cheap. Refrigerate while you temper your chocolate.\n\n**Hazelnut skin**\n\n300g dark chocolate (I used 200g, you don't need so much. Even that was overkill, although larger batches ARE easier to temper.)\n\nCut out plastic acetate sheets (or freezer bags) into 20cmx5cm rectangular strips. Bring chocolate to 120F, cool to 80F, rewarm to 88-89F before using. Spread a little bit on the acetate strips, and use a brush to mimic hazelnut skins (literally the most difficult part of the project for me). Place a nut in the center, [fold the sides over, and secure the ends with tape.](https://i.imgur.com/PMqrMk6.jpg) Refrigerate until set. Let nuts thaw for ~4-6 hours before removing acetate and eating.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nIt's god-awful, don't make it.\n\nKidding, it's transcendental, especially if you love hazelnuts. The \nganache packs a very strong hazelnut flavor, and there's a great interplay between the caramel and hazelnut flavors. You get some nice textures too, fluffy mousse, runny caramel, gritty praline, crunchy nuts (from the sponge). Was it worth the time? I dunno, I'm as nutty as this dessert, so I don't have an issue spending all that time making it. It's an art project to me first and foremost, and a gourmet dessert second.\n \nFinal note: I'm the kind of weirdo who cares, so I did some research, and [according to this,](http://www.letribunal.com/cedric-grolet-noisette/) the real thing sells for 18 Euros. If you plan to sell em, you can recoup on the component costs pretty easily, even at 75% of that price. Also, that website claims it weighs 93g; the ones I made were 175g, so I wonder if theirs was purchased half-sized for some reason. They note they bought it for less than the original price, so maybe.", "This is Cedric Grolet's \"la noisette\" (the hazelnut)? https://www.google.com/amp/s/sucredorgeetpaindepices.fr/par-difficulte/noisette-de-cedric-grolet/", "Paul Hollywood would like to know your location", "I\u2019m gonna need a banana for scale", "That's art.", "This is absolutely gorgeous and I swear I can almost taste it.

If I finished my homework, I was still not allowed to leave my room and had to sit at my desk.\n\nNot once did my father ever try to be a father.

If you did something, he did it better. If you knew something, he knew more. Even if he was wrong, you were wrong.\n\nHe never yelled. He never hit.

Excellent work.\n\nIt also goes to show that a nice dinner isn\u2019t about doing six different complicated dishes! This was absolutely delicious I\u2019m sure, and it only required some good beef, some mushrooms, either an onion or shallot I can\u2019t tell (I prefer shallots), herbs, seasoning, and a nice bottle of wine.\n\nIf you want to expand on your success, try making a red wine pan sauce to go with your steak next time. I recommend a simple pan sauce with shallots, garlic, beef stock, red wine, cold butter, and a bit of thyme (which also goes quite well with the mushrooms).

Only helpful if you're using a steak less than 3/4\" thick. If the steak is thawed, but cold, it'll be fine. 1\" (or the length of the 1st segment of the thumb), med heat in heated pan/oil, 3-4 mins per side. Better, 4 on 1st. 2.5 on other, (always render the fat cap 1st),  then baste with butter and aromatics for the last 1.5. Turn out to rest wrapped in foil for 5 mins or open to the air (I prefer the foil so I can use the flavor fluid collection for an au jus or gravy). I ALSO only use prime or fillet.

He works in everything from Kamikaze servers, monks, and even Pearl Harbor Celebrations (which are used to promote unity as an icebreaker) and he has turned Sushi and Sake into his theme.

But I need it in my life.", "Recipe she used: https://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/recipe-prinsesstarta-swedish-princess-cake/\r  \n\r  \n(only difference being she used a white marzipan lid)\r  \n\r  \nIngredients\r  \nYou need:\r  \n3 layer cake bases\r  \n1 portion pastry cream around 600g\r  \n600 ml whipping cream\r  \n2 tbsp icing sugar\r  \n150 g raspberry jam\r  \n200 g green marzipan lid\r  \npink and green modelling icing for flowers and leaves decorations\r  \nPiping bag spatula, cake stand.\r  \nTip: Depending on your schedule you might find it best to make the pastry cream first so it can cool and have time to set whilst you get on with the cake layers - but this is up to you.\r  \nLayer Cake Bases\r  \nIn our book we do not use baking powder \u2013 which is a genoise sponge \u2013 but if you are a little unsure add the mentioned 1 tsp baking powder and your rise is pretty much guaranteed. For more experienced bakers, try without (and you avoid the baking powder slight aftertaste and get a lighter result).\r  \n25 g butter melted and set aside\r  \n4 medium eggs\r  \n120 g caster sugar\r  \n120 g plain flour\r  \noptional 1 tsp baking powder\r  \na pinch of salt\r  \n1 tsp vanilla sugar or vanilla extract or seeds from \u00bd pod\r  \n3 baking sheets lined with non-stick baking paper (and ideally a few puffs of non-stick spray).\r  \nPastry Cream\r  \nMakes 600g gram approx.\r  \n500 ml whole milk\r  \n1 vanilla pod seeds scraped out\r  \n1 whole egg plus one egg yolk\r  \n100 g caster sugar\r  \n30 g cornflour\r  \nPinch of salt\r  \n25 g butter\r  \nMake your own marzipan:\r  \n200 g finely ground almonds use ground almonds, then re-grind them a few ties to make them extra fine.\r  \n100 g granulated sugar\r  \n100 g icing sugar\r  \n1 tsp almond extract\r  \n1 medium pasteurised egg white\r  \ngreen food gel\r  \n\r  \nInstructions\r  \nPre-heat the oven to 180C, 350F, Gas 4\r  \n\r  \nIn a stand mixer with the whisk attached, beat the egg and sugar on high until you reach ribbon stage. This means when you can see the traces of the mixture when you most the whisk through it. It will take a good 4-5 minutes to reach this stage and it\u2019s crucial \u2013 especially if you are not using baking powder, this is your only opportunity to get air into the mixture.\r  \nUsing a 20cm plate, draw 3 circles on your baking paper. Set aside.\r  \nCombine the flour, salt and baking powder if using. Sift this into the egg mixture and very carefully fold to combine, using a figure of eight, until all the flour is incorporated. Be very gentle at this stage, but thorough. Pour the cooled, melted butter down the side of the bowl at the end and give a final few folds to incorporate it.\r  \nDivide the mixture evenly between the 3 circles and gently use your spatulas to guide to the drawn edge.\r  \nBake in the oven for 5-8 minutes or until baked through and lightly browned.  Allow to cool down. To remove from the baking paper, if it sticks, wet your hands and allow to damped the underside of the baking paper, this release the cakes.\r  \nTrim any edges so you end up with 3 perfectly round and even sized bases.\r  \nTip: You can use 3 x 20cm baking tins if you have.\r  \nCheat\u2019s tip: Use ready bought layers \u2013 these from Karen Volf are brilliant. Comes with 3 layers and are ready to use. They are light and not too sweet \u2013 a really good option.\r  \nVanilla Cream Patisserie\r  \n\r  \nIn a saucepan, heat the milk with the vanilla seeds.\r  \nIn a separate bowl, using a mixer, whisk the eggs, sugar and corn flour.\r  \nWhen the milk reaches just boiling point, take it off the heat and pour 1/3 into the egg mixture, whisking continuously.\r  \nPour the egg mixture back into the hot milk, return to the stove and bring to the boil whilst whisking. Whisk continuously as the mixture thickens and keep on boil for just under a minute (this removes the cornflour taste).\r  \nPour into a cold bowl and leave to cool and set for several hours in the fridge. To avoid a \u2018crust\u2019 forming on top, place clingfilm straight on to the cream, covering the entire surface.\r  \nCheat\u2019s tip: Use an instant cream mix \u2013 we like this one from Dr. Oetker - just mix one sachet with 500ml whole milk, whisk for 1 minute and leave to set in the fridge. It has a nice vanilla taste and does not taste powdery \u2013 this is a great pastry cream alternative. You can also use this one for baking.\r  \n\r  \nMarzipan Lid\r  \nHere\u2019s the admission: I usually buy green marzipan. Why? Because it\u2019s easy and smooth and it\u2019s ready to use. You can get one that fits a 20-cm cake here \u2013 Odense Green Marzipan Lid.\r  \nBuy a covering marzipan from the supermarket and colour it green (should be minimum 25% almonds). To colour the marzipan, you must use a gel colour NOT a liquid green food colouring. If you use a green liquid colour, your marzipan will get sticky and hard to work with - and you will have to add a lot of extra icing sugar to make it workable.\r  \nPlace all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until you have a smooth marzipan. Roll the mixture into a ball and wrap tightly with cling film. Chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour before using.\r  \nBecause this marzipan contains egg white, use within a day.\r  \n\r  \nHow to assemble\r  \nThe most important bit - and the hardest step. Take your time and you will be fine!\r  \nFirst, arrange base layer on your serving tray. Add raspberry jam, then a good layer of pastry cream. Add middle layer - and repeat.\r  \nAdd the top layer and then spread a thick layer of whipped cream (make sure it is quite firm and cold). Use a palette knife to smooth the top reasonably flat - you don't want too much of a dome.\r  \nRoll out the marzipan into a round circle - it needs to be big enough to cover the whole cake. You get one stab at this bit, so carefully lift the marzipan and place on cake.\r  \nGently - bit by bit - pull down the edges all around the cake. You need to do it very carefully or you end up with folds - and the cake is too fragile to use a smoother. Practise makes perfect on this step, but patience will go along way.\r  \nCut off excess marzipan around the edges to leave a neat edge, decorate with a pink icing rose and dust with icing sugar just before serving.", "One of my fav cakes.

Unlike most sushi fish, it\u2019s served fully cooked and is typically coated in \u201ceel sauce\u201d and broiled. You can find frozen prepared eel at a Japanese grocery store, so it\u2019s an easy option to make at home if you can find it (especially if you are nervous about using raw fish)! You just defrost it and reheat in the oven, I was pleasantly surprised that the result was just as good as what I typically get at mid-level sushi restaurants! Preparing from scratch at home is also an option, however raw eel is a bit more difficult to come by.\n\n# Boat Breakdown:\n\nThree new rolls this week! On the left is the Salmon Siren Roll: spicy salmon and avocado on the inside, topped with salmon then brushed with chili oil and finished with spicy garlic crunch. In the middle is the Electric Boogaloo Roll:  eel, avocado, and miso cream cheese on the inside, topped with daikon sprouts. On the right is the Black Dragon Roll: shrimp tempura and avocado on the inside, topped with alternating avocado and eel, eel sauce, and black sesame seeds. There are two eel nigiri in the front and back of the boat, and two salmon nigiri in the back.\n\n**As always I\u2019m happy to answer your sushi questions in the comments!** Check out my Instagram story archives for tons of sushi recipes and how-to guides if you\u2019re interested in learning to make sushi at home!

The fact that it was made by a 13-year-old is what makes this above average.\n\nConstructive criticism:\nWhen putting on the sauce, spread it all the way to the edge of the crust. That'll prevent it from looking as thick and undercooked as it appears to be.\n\nSame thing with the cheese--put it all the way to the edges. The crust will bake out slightly, but with the sauce and cheese, it'll actually have some flavor and not be dried out and bland.\n\nJudging by the cheese, she placed the pizza too high in the oven, which put it too close to the heating element. That's what's caused the cheese to look overcooked. (That means it'll tear and not stretch.) Set the rack to the lower third of the oven.\n\nSomeone else mentioned it, but get a pizza stone. If you make any pizza at home--fresh home made or frozen--you owe it to yourself to get one. It'll give the bottom of the crust a nice char while keeping the inside of the crust moist and bread-like.\n\nHope this helps. I wouldn't turn that pizza down if it was offered to me.

It retains heat amazingly and makes for a great crust. Just heat the oven with the pan in it to 500F (or as high at it'll go) with the rack as high as you can place it. Pull the pan out, place the dough on it and add toppings. The dough will start to cook while you're adding the toppings to get an even better crust on the bottom.

Needless to say it was crowded as hell in this house.\n\nSkip ahead a few hours towards the end of the night when everyone is trickling out. Myself and a few friends were doing a sort of pre-cleanup recon. We come across ole Caren in the kitchen with her pants around her ankles; now at the time it didn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal. We just sort of ushered her to a spot to sleep off whatever drunkenness fell over her.\n\nThe next morning when were cleaning, Caren slipped out of the house never to be seen again. While we were cleaning up, we smelled a smelly smell that smelled...smelly. We could not for the life of us figure it out. Eventually we gave up and decided that our lingering hunger was more important. I took the opportunity to preheat the oven to 425 for pizza rolls...that ended up being the biggest mistake in recent human history. This only increased the raunchiness ten fold. I opened the oven to put the food in and the most distinct smell hit me right in the face. Now this is something I\u2019ll never forget; the appearance of this mound is something out of a Goosebumps novel. It looked like something similar to my neighbor\u2019s Rottweiler feces.\n\nAt this point, we didn\u2019t know what to do. After a few minutes of dry heaving, I built up the courage to clean it. I didn\u2019t have much on hand except an old spatula and some degreaser. The real fun began after i made my initial scoop...have you ever stabbed a fork into slightly undercooked brownies? A nice crust built up on the outside, but inside was a liquid so vile that not even the the craziest of war criminals would consider using this as a bio weapon. This was the lava cake from hell.\n\nEventually everything was \u201cclean\u201d and disposed of. Later that day, my mom came home and of course was curious about the stench that hardly died down. I told her with my sweet teenaged charm that we simply burnt a lasagna (only a partial lie). She bought it and we moved on. I thought everything was over.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nRewind to the discovery of said shit casserole. My buddy, Zane recorded the findings on his phone...for science. Anyway, he eventually uploaded this to Facebook and tagged me along with many others in this video which made it pop up on my mom\u2019s timeline. My mom wasn\u2019t too thrilled with the fact that she\u2019s been cooking dinners in that oven for the past six months completely unaware of the poo essence fusing with our food. That day ended with a new oven being installed.\n\nSome of you may ask what happened to the demon we know as Caren. Well, she never admitted to doing it. She also never agreed to a DNA test, but deep down I know it was her. We all know, Caren.", "Recipe please?

Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.\n\n\n3.Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, then oil it well.

Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with oil. Set aside.\n\n\n5.USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN HANDLING LYE. WEAR LONG RUBBER GLOVES AND RINSE IMMEDIATELY IF IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH YOUR SKIN. Bring the water and lye to a simmer (do not boil, it can splatter!) in a 12-inch straight-sided saute pan or a roasting pan (something wide and shallow is best). Do not add the lye to hot water: it can spurt!\n\n\n6.Meanwhile, turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, and, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place on a half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.\n\n\n7.One by one, place the pretzels in the water and lye for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula. Return them to the sheet pans and sprinkle with pretzel salt.\n\n\n8. Bake until dark golden brown in color, 10 to 12 minutes.

They\u2019re garbage! \n\nRhubarb? Don\u2019t get me started! People have to be tricked into thinking it\u2019s good, as we see here in this eye-catching geometrical pattern. Don\u2019t be fooled, it\u2019s a trap. Run! \n\nWhen my siblings and I were little, we\u2019d visit our grandma\u2019s house and play in the backyard.

She would disappear into the house and return from the kitchen into the sunshine with ramekins full of sugar! One for each of us! Then she cut us stalks from the rhubarb plant and handed them out, instructing us on how to dip the plant in our sugar and then munch it down. How cool does that *seem*, you know? Especially to little boys?\n\n\u201cHere ya go, kids! Have all the sugar in the world! Let me know if you need more! And here, take these sharp knives\u2014one for each of you, don\u2019t be shy! Attack my yard\u2019s wildlife and be merry!  And feast! Feast until you can feast no more!\u201d\n\nBut again...just like this pie with its hypnotic pattern, I know now that it was an elaborate ruse. A Siren song we were powerless to resist. \n\nSure, as we ate, we enjoyed a sweet, sugary burst of flavour at the get-go; but then we all winced at the sour finish as we choked down this bitter, fibrous weed. I don\u2019t even think this past time she taught us was that great back in the Depression era when she would have learned it. In fact, I might even go so far as to say that my grandmother \u201cgroomed\u201d us to landscape her yard \u201cLand Before Time-style\u201d by tricking us into eating that disgusting perennial every summer. \n\nWho am I kidding though, I\u2019ll probably do the same to my grandkids one day.", "I want so bad", "Wow this is beautiful", "This needs to be on u\\oddlysatisfying", "This picture being slightly off frame just upsets me and makes me want to downvote...", "Funny thing: Rhubarb in Poland is called rabarbar.", "Where's Q-Bert?", "cyberpunk cottagecore", "Oh wow", "All I see is Q*bert", "It's beautiful.

Spicy tuna is the most popular topping for crispy rice, but it\u2019s also great topped with spicy salmon, spicy crab mix, mayo crab mix, and really whatever you can think of! This version includes an optional avocado mash to add some extra richness and balance the spice.\u00a0\n\nThis batch also has some salmon nigiri brushed with lemon infused olive oil, and a new roll concept I was trying out. It\u2019s toasted sesame oil marinated salmon and avocado on the inside, rolled in black sesame seeds. I was going to call this roll the Umami Bomb, but frankly it didn\u2019t quite live up to the name so there will be more iterations in the future!\u00a0\n\n**Spicy Tuna (or salmon)**\n\n(one batch is enough for 1-2 rolls or 12 crispy rice)\n\n*Ingredients*\n\n* \u00a00.2 lbs sushi grade tuna\n* 2 green onions, greens only\n* 1 1/2 tsp sriracha (for medium heat, optionally add more to taste)\n* 1/2 tsp soy sauce\n* 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil\n* 1/4 tsp sugar\n\n*Instructions*\n\n1. Mince the tuna and green onion to desired texture.\n2. In a small bowl combine the minced tuna, minced green onion, and all other ingredients and mix well.\n\n**Crispy Rice**\n\n(Makes 12)\n\n*Ingredients*\n\n*  Prepared seasoned sushi rice (\\~1.5 cups)\n* 4 tbsp vegetable oil, for frying\n\n*Instructions*\n\n1. Wet your hands and shake off excess water (so the rice doesn't stick). Grab about 1.5 tbsp of rice and form it into a \\~1 inch X 1 inch square patty. Make 12 patties, rewetting your hands after every 2-3.\n2. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 1 hour (this helps the rice patties hold their shape when frying)\n3. Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the rice patties and cook for \\~3 mins until golden. Gently flip using tongs or a spatula and cook for another \\~2 mins until both sides are golden and crispy. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Watch the patties closely as they can quickly overcook.\u00a0\n\n**Avocado Mash**\n\n(enough for 12 crispy rice)\n\n*Ingredients*\n\n* 1/2 a medium avocado\n* 1/2 tsp lime juice\n* dash of salt to taste\n\n*Instructions*\u00a0\n\n1. Combine the ingredients in a medium bowl, mash with a fork until smooth.\u00a0\n\n**Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna**\n\nTo do final assembly, plate the prepared crispy rice patties.

However one can def make some short cuts.\n\n- do you have a local ramen place? Go ask if you can buy some noodles uncooked. I've done it and was able to get a few servings. Or search Amazon for ramen noodles and there's a few options, dry noodles that are still really good, or packets of soft noodles that take like 2min to cook.\n\n- find some pork belly. Easiest way is to just cut it so it's more of a block rather than attempting to roll it up and using butchers twine....I struggled making the pork roll lol it's tougher than it looks.

Finally!) https://imgur.com/gallery/m8zZl\n\n- Lastly search Amazon for: Japanese Noodles Tonkotsu Ramen Concentration Pork Bone Soup, 1-Pounds, 10 Packs\n\nI can promise you that these little packets of broth concentrate are absolutely worth the money because if combined with the rest of your homemade toppings it will get you about 80% of what I spent 18hrs making.  Seriously. Not to mention they utterly crush your average bullshit powder based ramen packs. Not even a question. After making my own broth, then trying the broth concentrate, I'm not ashamed to admit it's my go to for ramen broth. I make everything else so ya why not?\n\n*edit for thanks\n\nGuys seriously thank you all for the awards and upvotes, this is my most successful reddit post and it's ramen haha I love it.", "That is gorgeous.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees\n2. Mix together ingredients for crust. I will use the paddle attachment on my stand mixer if I\u2019m baking other things or its best to use your hands honestly. \n3. Press into the bottom of a 9x13 glass pan. Try to ensure it\u2019s even. I will make it even all the way around and then push down right on the inside of the edges. I found the edges are too crispy to serve so this pushes a little bit of the lemon filling into the middle more and saves it from being cut off. \n4. Bake 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. The edges will start to brown a little bit too. \n5. While that\u2019s baking, in a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and flour for the filling. In a separate bowl (I use a 4 cup measuring cup to save dishes) measure the lemon juice. After the sugar and flour are mixed together, add in the lemon juice. Whisk all of this together until the sugar is mostly dissolved. \n6. In the same measuring bowl (or whichever bowl you used for the lemon juice) beat the four eggs. Add these to the mix. \n7. Mix all of the filling ingredients together. It may settle a bit, so mix again before you actually pour into crust. \n8. Pour over baked crust. \n9. Bake for an additional 20 minutes. \n10. Allow bars to cool at room temp for an hour or so, then cut into squares. I cut them while they\u2019re in the glass pan. Sometimes cutting them is a process, so go over the cuts multiple times. This ensures the crust doesn\u2019t crumbly. No one likes crumbly crusts. \n11. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Refrigerate for another hour before serving, or overnight. (Or if you\u2019re like my family eat immediately because they\u2019re savages and love lemon bars). \n\nThis recipe is mildly modified from the \u201cBest Lemon Bars\u201d recipe from thebakingchocolatess (Kim Lange). I\u2019ve made them so frequently I\u2019ve found what works best for me, but her recipe is great to go off of as well!  \n\nOptional: if you want to swirl in some blueberries, out about 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries in food processor with 4 TBLS of white sugar. When you add the lemon filling to the baked crust (step 8) dollop the blueberry mix into the filling. Use a toothpick and swirl it around, careful not to touch the crust below. Bake for an additional 4 minutes. \n\n   -If you only have frozen blueberries, let them defrost in a strainer and prepare the same way. Add about a teaspoon of blueberry extract (as they lose flavor when they\u2019re frozen). \n\nHappy baking, friends! \n\nEDIT: Sorry for the formatting of the ingredients! Not sure how to fix it. \n\nEDIT x2: THANK YOU for the golds and silver!! I\u2019m so excited so many people love lemon bars. To add from some comments I\u2019ve seen, the ratio is perfect believe it or not. It\u2019s just sweet enough and just tart enough, and the crust melts in your mouth as it\u2019s more of a shortbread texture. You can add lemon zest if you like. And for cutting, I usually cut the edges off first while it\u2019s in the pan and use a knife that is NOT serrated. I mean, really go over those cuts. When they are completely cut, they separate on their own with little help from a (frosting) spatula. You can do powdered sugar first, to save some, but do this after they\u2019ve set for a bit. If you do it right after they are out of the oven then it dissolves and you\u2019ll taste it but it won\u2019t look pretty anymore haha. I hope this helps! I would love to send you all the lemon bars if I could!! ", "You got any more of that recipe", "As a bisexual, I approve of this\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc49", "r/bisexual ", "Well.

Then we\u2019d need to review it again, which would mean you making more and then sending it to us in New Zealand for a secondary judging. This of course would carry on indefinitely until we couldn\u2019t eat anymore. ", "I love making lemon bars and my family request them for most holidays. My recipe looks pretty similar to yours (I don\u2019t have it pulled up at the moment) but mine NEVER cut as nice as yours. Do you have a system for cutting them?

Noone mentions lemon bars.  But you need to hire a jizz mopper if you want to even utter the word macaroons (overrated).", "[deleted]", "On a recent \"America's Test Kitchen\" they modified the lemon bar mixture slightly.\n\n3 eggs + 3 egg yolks were used in the filling. They reasoned that all eggs with the whites can add an \"off\" flavor to the filling.\n\n2 tsp. of Cream of tartar were used. The alkalinity raises the lemon flavor of the bars.\n\nThe filling is heated to 160 deg in a saucepan prior to pouring it on top of the crust. It is then baked for 10 minutes. They said that if the mixture is not heated first, it would take 30-40 minutes to cook through in the oven, causing other issues with the crust. The mixture is strained before placing in the oven (to remove any curdling at the bottom of the saucepan).\n\nCool for 1.5 hours, cut and enjoy.", "I wish we were friends", "Gotten is such a weird word.

Feel free to ask anything in the comments.\n\nSpecs: direct method, 65% hydration, tipo 00 flour ( I used W350), 3% salt and roughly 0,3% fresh yeast. Here's what it looks like for 5 pizzas:\n\n744g flour\n\n484g water\n\n22g salt\n\n2.2g yeast\n\nRoom temp water into large bowl, add salt and melt it by mixing with your hands. Add some 10% of flour and mix until you have a completely smooth and creamy mixture. melt the fresh yeast into the mixture and start adding the rest of the flour in small patches while making sure you hydrate the flour properly before adding more. Also keep the edges of the bowl clean,  ensuring you incorporate all of that flour. Keep mixing until a rough dough ball forms and let that rest for 15-30 minutes. The dough is a bit sticky and looks very bad at this point but there is no need to add more flour. After the dough has rested, start kneading the dough by hand on a sturdy surface.  If it feels sticky after kneading a bit just simply cover it with the bowl you used and let it rest  again for 15-30 min. Keep kneading and do a few folds until you have a perfectly smooth dough. This usually takes me about 10-15 min total without accounting for the time the dough is resting. At this point the dough shouldn't be sticky. Spread a little bit of olive oil into your hands and tap the surface until it's thinly coated. Bulk fermented at room temp for 2h under a damp cloth, then divided into balls, let them rest at room temp for 1h in airtight containers (brush the containers with a tiny bit of olive oil) , then cold fermented in the fridge for about 24h. Take the balls out 2h before it's pizza time. Bake at 400c for about 60-90 seconds.", "Look at that subtle colouring. The tasteful thickness.

Cheesecake and blueberries my favorite! Did you make the blueberry topping? I can\u2019t do the van stuff?

If you go much above that temperature some of the sugars start caramelizing on the surface and make it darker than you might like. \n\nThe result is a uniformly moist and creamy cheesecake.

I\u2019m really glad everyone is digging this picture.\n\nHere are the recipes for the chicken tikka masala and the naan. The basmati rice was cooked in a rice cooker. Just follow package/rice cooker instructions.\n\nAlso, the recipes are not completely mine. The websites where they came from are cited below. I have tweaked them a little and my version is what\u2019s pasted here.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything I could be doing differently, please let me know. This turned out so amazingly good but would love any additional tips/tweaks to help elevate the flavors. \n\nHope you all enjoy!\n\nCHICKEN TIKKA MASALA\n\nChicken Marinade:\n* 24 oz boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into bite-sized pieces\n* 1 cup plain yogurt\n* 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic\n* 1 tablespoon ground ginger\n* 2 teaspoons garam masala\n* 1 teaspoon turmeric\n* 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground red chili powder\n* 1 teaspoon of salt\n\nSauce:\n* 2 tablespoons of vegetable/canola oil\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 large onion finely diced\n* 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic finely grated\n* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger finely grated\n* 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala\n* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin\n* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n* 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n* 14 oz tomato sauce\n* 1 teaspoon ground red chili powder\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 1/4 cups of heavy cream\n* 1 teaspoon brown sugar\n* 1/4 cup water if needed\n* 4 tablespoons Fresh cilantro\n\nSteps:\n1. In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade. Let marinate for at least an hour.\n\n2. Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)\n\n3. Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.\n\n4. Add garlic and ginger and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.\n\n5. Pour in the tomato sauce, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.\n\n6. Stir the heavy cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.\n\n7. Garnish with cilantro.\n\nNAAN\n\nIngredients:\n* 1/2 cup warm water\n* 2 tsp instant yeast\n* 1 tsp sugar\n* 3 Tbsp olive oil\n* 1/4 cup plain yogurt\n* 1 egg\n* 1/2 tsp salt\n* 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n* 2 Tbsp melted butter\n* 2 tsp garlic, minced\n\nSteps:\n1. Combine warm water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let sit for five minutes or till bubbly. Add olive oil, yogurt, egg, salt and 2 cups of flour. Stir till smooth.\n\n2. Add enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead a few times on a floured counter until smooth.\n\n3. Place dough in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled.\n\n4. Preheat a skillet to medium heat.\n\n5. Cut dough into eight pieces. On a floured surface, roll out each piece into a 6\" circle.\n\n6. Add a little oil or non-stick spray to the skillet. Cook each circle for 2-3 minutes or until bubbly and golden brown on the bottom. Flip over and cook for another 2-3 minutes.\n\n7. Brush the top (the bubbly side) of each naan with melted garlic butter.\n\n\nChicken Tikka Masala:\ncafedelites.com/chicken-tikka-masala/\nNaan:\nlilluna.com/homemade-naan-bread/\n", "\"naan bread\" my Desi Bois will get it ", "Did you make the naan too?", "I feel like I'm the only one who has never tried Chicken Tikka Masala", "[deleted]", "Warning: SUPER TASTY.", "Did this happen to be inspired by the recent Basics with Babish episode?

What\u2019s your recipe?!?", "I'm not trying to complain and point fingers or tell you that you're a bad person. Not my intention at all! Like I said I'm really glad different people are cooking the food! It's awesome! However the way these dishes are cooked are being misreprepresented. Your spices your process on marination and the process of cooking is spot on! However instead of the tomatoes sauce add fresh tomatoes. San maranzo canned or fresh should be considered even heirloom tomatoes have great body and sweetness to them which would help enhance the flavours. Tumeric is essential as well that's how you get the right color and depth to your dish only a teaspoon or less or you could make your dish bitter. Cream in my opinion shouldn't be in our food. It dampens the flavours and actually hijacks the complex flavor profiles you've worked so hard over the past hour to produce! You don't want to homgenise those beautiful profiles! Clarified butter or ghee is also important. Due to the high boiling point you can achieve a tarkha (saut\u00e9ed veggies) that is rich in flavor and is almost the consistency of vindaloo paste you get in a jar. I know people might have reservations on ghee, but it takes dishes to a whole different level! Also for next time add a little red wine and cook the tarkha with that. I make it that way with a spiced red wine and people drool over it. Your naan recipe is also spot on no complaints there. Just be mindful for the future that this food is being misreprepresented and catered to I don't know who really (not my family) If recipes that use cream keep getting pushed  over how it actually should be made then this wonderful food might be lost forever.

The day rolls round and we all meet up and it's all lovely, and we all go out for a big walk, leaving Gooby in peace to make dinner.\n\nGooby decides that before he starts he'll have a little smoke to chill. This turns into several.\n\nEveryone gets back to the cottage at 6ish, expecting dinner to be an hour away, and we find Gooby floating around the kitchen only just taking the meat out the fridge, big pile of unwashed mushrooms on the side.\n\nSeveral hours later, having enjoyed a starter prepared by my stepmother and having gone through all the nibbles and biscuits, the Wellington arrives at the table. Admittedly it is a very good Wellington, but it is very lonely, no sides or potatoes or sauce.\n\nUs: \"Gooby, wheres the sides and the potatoes and the sauce?:\n\nGooby: \"Well at work somebody else does all of that\"\n\nLast I heard Gooby moved to SE Asia to he a tattoo artist, and I can only assume he's since been hacked to pieces by some gangster annoyed that Gooby only did half his tattoo before getting stoned, or some such other calamity.", "Good job bud", "Very nice !", "Puff pastry looks a liiiittle soggy but that beef looks like an awesome med rare, if not like 5 min overdone.

I used to work for a bakery that made a garlic-cheddar loaf and all the breads were great but the smell of that one was next level.", "[deleted]", "OP we need the recipe!", "This would go great with some bloody Mary\u2019s for breakfast", "I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up so much. So what I did essentially was follow [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/b972wa/noknead_crusty_white_bread/)  recipe from another reddit post but I also added in two cups of cheddar that I grated from a block and I also cut up two jalape\u00f1o whole peppers. I tried to make sure there was some cheese throughout the dough.\n\nAs for when I added the cheese and peppers, I let the dough rise room temperature, after first mixing it up, for two hours. After that I threw it in the fridge for almost 12 hours until this morning. I woke up early cause I wanted to have it ready for work today and I threw in my Dutch oven and let it preheat with my oven to 450 F. While it was preheating, I pulled the dough out and while it was still cold and that is when I mixed in the cheese and peppers. I would flatten out the dough and throw a bit in and then fold it in and repeating until it\u2019s well covered. After that I cover the dough for about an hour while the oven finishes preheating with the Dutch oven in it.\n\n\nNow it\u2019s money time and I just pull out the Dutch oven, sit my dough on some parchment paper and put it in the Dutch oven with the lid on. I don\u2019t score the dough or anything else. I cook it with the lid on for anywhere between 30-45 minutes (this one was done for 45 minutes). I pull off the lid and cook an additional 12 minutes and pull it out. Once the lid is off you can keep a better eye on the color of it but 10-12 minutes is usually the window here. Now you can sit it on a cooling rack for 30 minutes to 2 hours and it\u2019s good to go! I am by far no expert in bread making I just started a couple months ago and love doing it.

When hot, add chicken pieces, ensuring not to crowd the pan. (This is important!)\n\nCook for 2-3 minutes a side, until browned. Make sure you have some nice brown bits at the bottom of your pan! Set aside chicken in bowl.\n*The Chicken doesn't have to be cooked through at this stage\n\nIn the same pan, add butter and Onions, and cook until soft, translucent and brown. Add Ginger and Garlic, and sautee for 30-45 seconds. (No Longer)\n\nThen add all the spices Fry until fragrant (15-20 seconds, until fragrant).\n\nAdd Tomato Sauce, Pur\u00e9e, Ground Red Chili and Sriracha. Simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally until Tomato Sauce thickens, and takes on a deep reddish brown colour. (Make sure you get this sauce thick like my naan people!)\n\nAdd Chicken and Cocunut Cream, and cook for an additional until mixture is bubbling, glossy, and thick.

In 2009, Aaron Franklin launched the restaurant in a trailer. The restaurant has sold out of brisket every day since its establishment. Franklin Barbecue moved to a brick and mortar location in 2011. The restaurant appeared on Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations in September 2012. In 2014, Texas Monthly listed the restaurant on its list of \"the 50 Best BBQ Joints in the World.\" That July, President Barack Obama visited the restaurant and bought lunch for those in line behind him. The restaurant is prominently featured in a scene from the 2014 Jon Favreau film Chef, with speaking cameos by owner Aaron Franklin and general manager Benji Jacob. In May 2015, Franklin Barbecue owner Aaron Franklin was awarded a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef: Southwest. He is the first chef who specializes in barbecue to be nominated, or receive, the award. - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Barbecue)", "Mouthwatering.", "Went there in January ... best bbq brisket I\u2019ve ever had by far.", "You had me at \"brisket\"...", "*Breathes heavy in Austin*", "I just had lunch but this made me hungry af", "Just watched that episode of Chef Show last night, looked JUST like this.

Cook over simmering water while whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, about 165F. Pour into a cylindrical container, add the butter, and use an immersion blender to emulsify the butter. Chill completely.\n\n**Craquelin**\n\n75g light brown sugar\n\n75g AP flour\n\n75g softened butter\n\n2g salt\n\nBeat butter, salt, and sugar together in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment for about a minute. Add the flour, mix until just combined. Roll mixture out between two sheets of parchment to about 2 mm. Freeze completely before cutting out rectangles.\n\n**Pate a Choux**\n\n125g bread flour\n\n105g whole milk\n\n105g water\n\n10g sugar\n\n3g salt\n\n100g butter\n\n~202g egg, beaten\n\nBring water, milk, sugar, salt, and butter to a rolling boil. Remove from heat, add in flour all at once, stir until no lumps remain. Return to medium heat, stirring constantly, and cook for about 2 minutes. The mixture should reach at least 165 F to fully gelatinize the starch. Place mixture in a stand mixer bowl with the paddle attachment and beat on low speed for a minute or so cool down the mixture. Add the egg mixture in several additions until the proper choux consistency is reached. Transfer to a piping bag with a French star tip and let sit at room temperature for 1 to 3 hours.\n\nPipe out choux of 4.5cm x 16xm. (You can squeeze the batter while holding the tip in place for a second or so to create a larger extrusion. This takes a bit of practice to make it even.) Cut out frozen craquelin rectangles of 5cm x 17 cm dimensions and place over the choux. Bake at 425F for 5 minutes, then 375F for ~40-45 minutes. Turn the oven off and let the choux continue to dry in the oven for about an hour.\n\n**Glaze** \n\n100g dark chocolate, 85%\n\n25g Dark Matter\n\n75g butter\n\n20g corn syrup\n\n10g black cocoa powder\n\nMelt the chocolate and dark matter completely in the microwave. Stir in the remaining ingredients until homogeneous. Glaze while fluid but not set.\n\n**Vanilla Mousseline Cream**\n\n250g evaporated milk\n\n1 vanilla bean, ~15cm\n\n50g vanilla sugar\n\n60g egg yolks\n\n18g cornstarch\n\n2g salt\n\n225g softened butter\n\nSteep vanilla bean and seeds in the evaporated milk for 30 minutes. Remove the vanilla pod before proceeding. Whisk yolk, sugar, cornstarch, and salt until pale in color. Heat vanilla milk to a simmer, then temper the yolk mixture. Return to the saucepan and cook until thickened, then cook for another minute to denature residual amylase. Chill completely.\n\nPlace the chilled cream in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment. Beat cream briefly to smooth it out, then add the softened butter in chunks until fully incorporated.\n\n**Italian Meringue Buttercream**\n\n65g egg whites\n\n0.5g cream of tartar\n\n2g salt\n\n135g sugar\n\n40g water\n\n225g softened butter\n\nWhite food coloring*\n\nBeat whites with the cream of tartar until foamy. Bring water and sugar to 240-245F. Once the whites are glossy, but not overwhipped, slowly drizzle in the syrup and beat on high. Add the salt, then continue beating until shiny, stiff peaks form. Add the butter in chunks until fully incorporated and glossy. Add drops of white food coloring to your satisfaction.\n\n*Yes, it's not good for you. I know. But neither is this eclair.\n\n**ASSEMBLY**\n\nDrill holes along the length of each eclair with a French star tip. Fill with a generous squirt of mousseline cream in each hole (haha), then a squirt in vanilla curd into each hole. Continue filling with mousseline until cream begins to burst out of all holes in the eclair.\n\nGlaze each eclair and refrigerate briefly to set the glaze.

So no, it's not a traditional tiramisu but it takes the idea and puts a summer spin on it. \n\nThe lady fingers are soaked in lemon syrup spiked with Limoncello and there's a layer of strawberries and cream in the middle. The blog post has a little video that shows the assembly as well as pics of what it looks like on the inside. \n\n\nIngredients\n\n\nFor the Lemon Syrup\n\n1 1/2 cup (120ml) water \n\n1 1/2 cup (300g) sugar\n\n2 large lemons, peeled with a sharp vegetable peeler to avoid the white pith (about 10 strips)\n\n3/4 cup (180ml) fresh lemon juice (juice of 2 large lemons)\n\n2 tablespoons (30ml) Limoncello (optional)\n\n\nFor the Mascarpone Filling:\n\n3 tablespoons (45ml) water\n\n2 tablespoons (25g) sugar\n\n4 large egg yolks \n\n16 ounces (2 cups, 340g) mascarpone cheese, cold\n\n3/4 cup (100g) confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted if lumpy\n\n1 cup (250ml) heavy cream, cold\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n2 quarts (about 2.5 lbs) fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced  (or other berry of your choice)\n\n1 1/2 packages of ladyfingers (about 36 cookies)\n\n\nBorage flowers or other edible flowers, optional\n\n\n\nMethod \n\n\nMake the lemon syrup: Add water, sugar and lemon peel to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Simmer for 1 minute, or until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat, stir in lemon juice and Limoncello, if using, and set aside. Allow to cool and remove peels.\n\n\nMake the cream: Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Bring to a boil and simmer until sugar dissolves, 1 minute. Place egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, and whisk on medium-low. With the mixer running, slowly and very carefully drizzle in the hot sugar syrup. Increase the mixer\u2019s speed to medium-high and beat until the bowl is no longer hot to the touch and the mixture has tripled in size, about 5 minutes. Turn mixer to medium speed and add mascarpone in a few large dollops, letting each incorporate before adding the next. Add confectioners sugar and beat until just combined and smooth.\n\n\nIn a separate clean and chilled bowl, beat cream and vanilla to stiff peaks. Using a spatula, gently fold whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully incorporated. Set aside.\n\n\nPour lemon syrup into a shallow bowl and dip ladyfingers, turning once to coat for a few seconds, allowing them to absorb some of the syrup. Line the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish with a single layer of the ladyfingers. If you have a lot more than half the syrup left, drizzle an extra two or three tablespoons syrup over the ladyfingers in the dish. \n\n\nTop ladyfingers with half of the mascarpone mixture and smooth the surface with an offset spatula or butter knife. Place a layer of sliced strawberries all over the mascarpone mixture, reserving the remaining strawberries for the top.\n\n\nRepeat with the second layer of dipped ladyfingers, and top with the remaining mascarpone mixture. Smooth the top.\n\n\nDecorate the top with the remaining strawberries. For a flower pattern, work from the center-out and angle the strawberries slices, continuing around the dish until you have a flower-like pattern. Refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours and up to 1 day. Top with a sprinkle of edible flowers, if desired, then slice and serve.\n\n", "It's so pretty!!!

Just wanted to get y'all the recipe asap. Will proofread for typos shortly :)\n\nNote: This recipe uses homemade chicken broth and with the resulting shredded chicken. I will give you the recipe for how to make the homemade broth + chicken, but you can use store-bought stock + buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it up if you\u2019re pressed for time. Not sure how big rotisserie chickens usually come, but I used a 5 lb raw bird and got 4 cups of shredded chicken. You could get away with 3 cups of shredded chicken instead but you might want to reduce the stock a bit.\n\nOnce a week, I\u2019ll buy a whole bird and start the broth the night before. The next day, I shred it up, cook down the broth a little and make whatever kind of soup I can come up with. I recommend starting the broth the night before to be honest\u2026saves a lot of work for the next day.\n\nNo need to peel the onion or garlic! Just leave them in the paper. Wipe off any dirt you see.\n\nI also added orzo to mine because i was feeling lawless tonight\n\n**Homemade broth:**\n\n* 5 pound whole chicken, giblets removed and reserved for another use\n* 3 heads garlic, halved crosswise\n* 1 stalk celery (note: the whole bunch..not just 1 rib), trimmed and rinsed and cut into thirds\n* 2 yellow onions, wiped down and quartered\n* Salt\n\n**Chicken Broccoli Cheddar Soup:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder (or use a few fresh cloves, minced)\n* 3 teaspoons sweet paprika\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, optional\n* \u00bd teaspoon cayenne powder or crushed red pepper, more or less to taste, depending on how spicy you want it\n* 4 cups shredded chicken\n* 8 cups homemade broth, plus more water if needed\n* 1 cup dry orzo\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 4 cups broccoli florets and stems, finely chopped; a handful of florets reserved for garnish if you want\n* 2 cups freshly grated cheddar (do NOT use bagged)\n* 1 cup freshly grated pepper jack cheese (do NOT use bagged), plus more for serving\n* 1 tablespoon cornstarch\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Freshly minced parsley for serving\n\n**Prepare the broth:**\n\n1. Place the chicken in a large stock pot and season all over with salt. Pile the aromatics on top and cover completely with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Skim off any foam or scum from the top of the broth as it cooks. Let cool completely and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n2. The next day, remove the pot from the refrigerator and transfer to the stovetop. Using tongs, carefully remove the chicken from the liquid and transfer to a large bowl. Discard the skin and pick all the meat from the bones. You can save the carcass for stock if you want. Shred the meat using your fingers and set it aside.\n3. Bring the broth back to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Rapid simmer for about 30 minutes to reduce the broth slightly and intensify the flavors. Turn off the heat. You should be left with about 8 cups liquid. If not quite 8 cups, you can supplement with water as the broth will be quite intense.\n4. Carefully pour the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard solids. Rinse out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Start the soup:**\n\n1. Heat the 1 tablespoon neutral oil in the pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 5 minutes. Add the garlic powder, sweet paprika, smoked paprika, and cayenne powder. Cook for 1 minute.\n\n**Cook the chicken and pasta:**\n\n1. Add the shredded chicken to the pot and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the homemade broth and bring to a boil. While boiling, pour in the orzo. Stir constantly and cook for 8 minutes until just shy of al dente.\n\n**Cook the broccoli:**\n\n1. Add the broccoli and heavy cream to the soup, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10\u201315 minutes or until the broccoli is tender. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.\n\n**Prepare the cheese:**\n\n1. Place the freshly grated cheddar and pepper jack cheese in a large bowl. Sprinkle with cornstarch and use your hands to coat the cheese completely. Set aside.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Reduce the heat on the soup to low. It should not be bubbling at all! If on an electric stove that has residual heat, I recommend turning off the heat for this step.\n2. Add a handful of the cheese and whisk to incorporate. Continue whisking until fully melted. Continue adding the cheese in handfuls, whisking after each addition, until smooth and creamy. The cornstarch will help prevent the cheese from clumping. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.\n\n**Make the broccoli garnish (optional):**\n\n1. Place the broccoli florets in a bowl with a few splashes of water. If your microwave has a steam setting, use that. Otherwise, just microwave in 30-second increments until tender-crisp and warmed through. You don\u2019t have to do this step; I just like a bit of fresh broccoli on mine. Sprinkle with a bit of salt.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Spoon a few steamed broccoli florets on each bowl and sprinkle each bowl with a bit more pepper jack cheese. Garnish with freshly minced parsley.

Add the peanut butter, egg, and vanilla and mix until just evenly combined. Pour the flour mixture into the wet mixture and quickly mix until no clumps of flour remain. Make sure not to over-mix or your cookies will be puffy.  \nRoll the dough into 1/4 cup balls and roll them in the remaining granulated sugar. Place 6 cookie dough balls on each baking sheet, evenly spaced, and then gently press down on the tops with your palm to flatten slightly. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.    Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.  \nUncover and bake the cookies for 12 minutes, or until just set around the edges but very soft and puffy in the middle.

McVities defended its classification of Jaffa Cakes as cakes at a VAT tribunal in 1991, against the ruling that Jaffa cakes were biscuits due to their size and shape, and the fact that they were often eaten in place of biscuits. McVities insisted that the product was a cake, and allegedly produced a giant Jaffa cake in court to illustrate its point.The product was assessed on the following criteria:\n\nThe product's name was regarded as a minor consideration.\nThe ingredients were regarded as similar to those of a cake, producing a thin cake-like batter rather than the thick dough of a biscuit.\nThe product's texture was regarded as being that of a sponge cake.\nThe product hardens when stale, in the manner of a cake.\nA substantial part of the Jaffa cake, in terms of bulk and texture, is sponge.\nIn size, the Jaffa cake is more like a biscuit than a cake.\nThe product was generally displayed for sale alongside other biscuits, rather than with cakes.\nThe product is presented as a snack and eaten with the fingers, like a biscuit, rather than with a fork as a cake might be. The tribunal also considered that children would eat them in \"a few mouthfuls\", in the manner of a sweet.\nThe court found in favour of McVitie's and ruled that the product should be considered a cake, meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa cakes in the United Kingdom.", "Recipe,\n\nSponge;\n\n110g softened butter\n110g Granulated sugar \n2 medium eggs\n110g self raising flour\n1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n1/2 tsp orange extract\nSplash of milk to loosen batter if needed.\n\nBake in a greased 20cm cake tin at 180C/gas 4 for 25-30 mins or until skewer comes out clean.

Leave to cool and set before taking the side of the springform off.\n\nIf you set it it the fridge, take it out for 30mins to an hour before serving for the chocolate to get back to room temperature.

Allow to sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.  \nSift in the flour, then add in the salt and melted butter. Mix until no large clumps of flour remain (the dough will be slightly sticky). If mixing by hand, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 additional minutes.  \nSpray your mixing bowl with nonstick spray, place the dough back in, and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm, draft-free spot for about an hour, or until doubled in size. (See notes.)  \nTurn the dough out onto a floured counter. Using a pizza cutter or a long knife, divide the dough into 12 even-sized wedges.  \nSpray a 3 quart baking dish with nonstick spray. Form each dough wedge into a sphere by pulling the edges toward the center and pinching them together. Place the dough in the prepared baking dish, seam-side down, and space evenly apart. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rise for an additional hour. Then prepare the baking soda bath.  \nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F. In a large saucepan, bring 2 quarts of water to a low boil. Remove from heat and slowly add the baking soda, a bit at a time, whisking to combine. Place back on heat and lower to a simmer.  \nOne at a time, transfer a risen dough ball into the baking soda bath, seam side down, and poach for 30 seconds. Then turn over and continue to poach for 30 more seconds. Using a large slotted spoon, transfer the poached dough back to the prepared baking dish, making sure not to transfer too much of the baking solution with it (or you'll wind up with soggy-bottomed pretzels). Continue until all of the dough balls have been poached and they fit snugly together.\nBrush the dough balls lightly with the egg wash, making sure to get in the nooks between the dough balls. Sprinkle with pretzel salt.\nUsing a sharp paring knife, make two slashes in the tops of the dough balls. Transfer to the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until cooked through and well-browned. Let cool slightly in the pan and then gently lift out to serve.  \n\n**NOTES**  \nWhen it's cold out, it may take longer for your dough to rise. To prevent this, I usually preheat my oven to the lowest setting, turn the oven off, let it cool for 5 minutes, and then place my bowl of dough in there to rise. The slight additional heat will help, and keeping the oven door closed prevents drafts.  \n\nx-posted from /r/morganeisenberg", ">Hot. Tempting. Perfectly tanned.

But when I realised god they look DELISH", "For my European fellows:\n\nIngredients\n\nCrust:\n\nNon-stick cooking spray\n\n150g unbleached all-purpose flour\n\n55g powdered sugar (plus more to decorate the finished bars, if desired)\n\n1/2 tsp salt\n\n120g unsalted butter, softened but still cool, cut into 1-in pieces\n\nFilling:\n\n7 large egg yolks, plus 2 large eggs\n\n225g granulated sugar\n\n0.5dL finely grated lemon zest (the zest of two lemons) **zest the lemons before squeezing for juice\n\n1.5dL / 150g lemon juice (the juice of 2 lemons)\n\nPinch of salt\n\n60g unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces\n\n0.5dL / 45g heavy cream\n\nPreparation\n\nStep 1 Before beginning, read the entire recipe and measure all ingredients. The warm filling must be added to the warm crust. Start preparing the filling when the crust goes into the oven.\n\nBe sure to cool the bars completely before cutting them.\n\n1.) For the crust: Spray a 9-inch square baking pan with non-stick cooking spray. Fold two 16-inch pieces of foil or parchment paper lengthwise to measure 9 inches wide. Fit first sheet in the bottom of the greased pan, pushing it into the corners and up the sides of the pan (the overhang will help in removal of the baked bars). Fit the second sheet in the pan in the same manner, perpendicular to the first sheet. Spray the sheets with more non-stick cooking spray.\n\n2.) Place flour, powdered sugar and salt in a food processor and process briefly. Add the butter and process to blend, 8 to 10 seconds, until the mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle the mixture into the prepared pan and press firmly with your fingers in to an even layer over the entire pan bottom and slightly up the sides. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n\n3.) Preheat the oven to 180C and adjust an oven rack to the middle position. Bake the crust for 20 minutes.\n\n4.) For the filling: In a medium-sized non-reactive bowl (glass or stainless steel), whisk together the yolks and whole eggs until combined (about 5 seconds). Add the granulated sugar and whisk until just combined. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice and salt. Whisk until combined. Transfer the mixture to a medium-sized non-reactive saucepan (the heavier the better). Add the butter pieces and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the lemon curd thickens to a thin sauce-like consistency and registers 75C degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes. Immediately pour the curd through a single-mesh stainless steel strainer set over a clean non-reactive bowl. Stir in the heavy cream; pour the curd onto the warm crust immediately.\n\n5.) Bake until the filling is shiny and opaque and the center 3 inches jiggle slightly when shaken, about 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Refrigerate until completely chilled.\n\n6.) Remove the bars from the pan using the foil or parchment handles and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 16 squares, wiping the knife clean between cuts, as necessary.\n\n7.) Sprinkle powdered sugar over the bars, if desired.", "This looks like a work of art, even closer to what I usually cook hahaha\r  \nBut I'm going to be inspired by what you did and try to do at least similar!", "It looks like the top Lemon Bar is levitating", "![gif](giphy|35OR75YXfTj4PCrbJV)", "The delegation from /r/bisexual is very impressed", "I fucking love lemon flavored treats!

Remove from heat. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a small bowl and push the puree though, leaving any skin/large chunks behind. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the strainer, which catches a lot of the puree! Set aside until needed.\n\n\nFor the White Chocolate Fudge:\n\n\nLightly grease an 8 x 8-inch baking pan. Line the pan with parchment paper, allowing the excess paper to hang over the sides; set aside. In a large, heatproof bowl combine the sweetened condensed milk, white chocolate, butter, and salt; set aside. Fill a saucepan with a little water (you want it about 1/4 full) and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to barely a simmer. Place your heatproof glass bowl holding your ingredients on top of the pot. Stir frequently, until the white chocolate has melted and the mixture is completely smooth, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in 3/4 of the blueberry pie filling, setting aside about 2 tables for later use. Fold the blueberry pie filling in about 3 or 4 times, but be sure not to over mix. The mixture will be very thick. Using a sturdy spatula, scrape the fudge into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Dot the remaining blueberry pie filling on top of the fudge and use a toothpick to marble it into the top of the fudge. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before slicing.\n\n\nGently run a butter knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the fudge. Remove the fudge and transfer it to a cutting board. Peel off parchment paper, then slice the fudge into small pieces. Serve at once or store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
