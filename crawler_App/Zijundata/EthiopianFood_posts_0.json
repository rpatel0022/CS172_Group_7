All the flour should pull from the sides and bottom of the bowl into the main dough ball. Mixing more will not hurt it. This can also be done by hand.\n\nPut this teff mixture into a clear plastic cambro or other container with a lid that\u2019s tight but not air tight. You want to be able to see through it and look at the mixture. Press it down into the bottom of the container so there are minimal air gaps, and place more RO water on top to make about a 1 inch level of water above the mixture. This prevents mold from forming.\n\nPlace this in a warm, dark cabinet (or microwave works, just don\u2019t forget it) for three days. You\u2019ll see bubbles start to form on day one, and the water may turn black or murky by day three. It may not smell amazing at this point, but it should be very bubbly and smell somewhat pleasant, not completely rotten. Pour off the water on top (down the sink) before moving on to the main batter. If you need more time for the bubbles to start, wait another day or two. Not all Teff flour has an amazing yeast culture to start, and colder temps slow it down.\n\nMain batter:\n\n500g Ivory Teff Flour\n500g RO Water\n500g RO Water (to cover)\n\nTake one cup of the starter mixture (remember, pour off that top water before this), and place it in the kitchen-aid bowl again. Place all the teff flour in it and mix it on low speed for 1 min to incorporate the starter thoroughly and warm things up. Slowly add the 500g of water and mix on low 2 mins or until the mixture pulls from the sides and bottom of the bowl (you may need to use medium speed for the pulling to fully occur). You just don\u2019t want any lumps. Place this mixture into a container like the starter. Cover with 500g of water just like the starter (the measurement of this water isn\u2019t super necessary, but I\u2019m telling you what I did). Wait 24 hours and you should see mega bubbling occur, and the dough may have lifted past the water level or completely consumed the water. If this happens, add more RO water (250-500g) to the batter and lightly mix so that when it settles in a few hours there\u2019s a water layer on top. Wait another 48 hours with it stored in a dark, warm place. It should be extremely active at this point! Tons of bubbles and good yeasty smells. There should be a murky layer of water on top.\n\nAbsit (gelatinization)\n\nPour off the murky water layer.\n\nGet 250g RO water in a wide pot and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat to medium and pour in approximately 1/2 cup of the batter, followed by 1/2 cup of RO water and stir with a whisk IMMEDIATELY upon the batter going in. Prep these ahead of time so it\u2019s quick. You\u2019ll get lumps if you don\u2019t. Cook and stir constantly until the batter begins to bubble up and gelatinization occurs. When that happens, take off heat immediately and add in 3 cups (750g) RO water while whisking to cool off the absit. Don\u2019t worry about the extra water. I know it\u2019s a lot. You want the absit slightly warm to the touch. When it\u2019s warm but not hot, add back to the main batter and give it another stir to incorporate. It will look thin. Don\u2019t worry. Let this sit another 12 hours in a dark, warm place.\n\nAt this point you should see what my first picture is. It should be super bubbly, active, smell amazing like beer and toasted bread, and have that separated water layer. If you don\u2019t see action. Keep waiting until it happens before cooking. If you don\u2019t, it won\u2019t work.\n\nCooking:\n\nPour off the murky water, INTO A CONTAINER WITH A LID, and save this in the fridge to mix subsequent batches of batter. This can be your \u201cstarter,\u201d if you haven\u2019t saved the original one. You can skip the starter stage if doing this and use the yeasty water as part of the RO water amount in the main batter if making future batches.\n\nWhat is left over after saving this water should make the perfect batter consistency. Don\u2019t add any more water. Mix it a little so as not to pop all the CO2 bubbles, but to homogenize the mixture.\n\nHeat your mitad to 285\u00b0F. Small injera take 1/2 cup of batter and full size take about 1.25 cups. This recipe makes about 20 small injera or 8-9 larger ones. I don\u2019t pour in a concentric circle because I don\u2019t have the appropriate vessels to pour. I just pour from the center out with my measuring cup, in a circular motion, making sure I don\u2019t pour near the very edge of the batter but just on the inside of the edge to spread it evenly. This may take you a couple tries. Do not spread the batter like a crepe. It will be too thin. You want a bit of natural volume. Odd shapes are fine! This will likely get rolled and cut anyway.\n\nThe batter should, within 10 seconds, show immense bubbling action that continues inward toward the center and yields that classic injera look. If you don\u2019t get these bubbles, your batter wasn\u2019t fermented enough. Don\u2019t cook anymore of them if this is the case. Ferment it longer and be patient. If you ended up killing the yeast from the absit being too hot, you have to start the batter over. I can\u2019t stress the bubbles enough!\n\nJust when about 85% of the bubbles have popped, cover the injera with a lid and wait about 30 seconds or until you see steam coming out of the hole in your lid (mine has a small hole for this purpose). The edges of the injera should be slightly off the griddle and it should look completely cooked (no wet batter). It should lift off super easy, but do use something to help you like a sefed or a piece of sturdy, clean cardboard. Immediately transfer to a towel on your counter, and pour the next injera. When you place the lid on that one, move the previous one to a new spot on that towel or on another towel. This is to help prevent sticking. When that injera is done cooking, place it in the spot the first was in, and pour the next. When the lid goes on, move the first injera to its final spot somewhere else, and move the second injera into its place opening up the original position for the one you\u2019re cooking. This way of cooling and stacking will ensure no sticking. The third and final spot for the first injera will be your final stack location. If you move them in this fashion none will stick.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Don\u2019t be tempted to add baking powder. It\u2019ll neutralize any acids and therefor take away sour flavors that should be in the injera. Just get the fermentation all happy and bubbly and the rest should fall into place.\n\nThe starter liquid can last up to one year in your fridge without feeding. It\u2019s quite awesome!", "So jealous.  I\u2019ve tried several times and failed every single time.  I\u2019m not exactly sure what I\u2019m doing wrong", "That looks great injera good job", "Something that can help is to let it ferment about 4 days.  Pour off that liquid.

Breakfast is usually a bit of dabo ena shi (bit of bread and tea). Source: I\u2019m half Ethiopian.", "When I lived in Ethiopia most people ate shiro and injera for an every day meal. Firfir or just bread and tea for breakfast.", "I believe they eat injera every day which is very hard to make. I have tried. I think you need someone to show you in person how to do it.", "Not Ethiopian myself, but when we have been invited over to someone's home for a casual lunch, there is usually injera and one or two dishes. They usually serve some lentil or split pea dish, sometimes with torn injera mixed in, and sometimes have a salad or vegetable on the side. I've only seen more variety during holidays and celebrations, or in a restaurant, but honestly don't have too much experience.\n\nMy husband and step-son are Ethiopian, so we make mostly Ethiopian food at home. Here are some tips I've found useful:\n\nUse red onions or shallots. When I use yellow onions, they mellow out the spices and berbere, so I usually have to add more to get the flavor I want. I don't have access to white onions, and shallots are hard to find and expensive, so I use red onions. The red onions really set off the spices, but also make alicha dishes look grayish (or greenish if adding turmeric). My Ethiopian friends use whatever onions they want and their food is amazing, but honestly, they are better cooks than me.\n\nOnce you can make a basic berbere or alicha sauce, you can add any main ingredient(s) you want to try.  The sauces tend to highlight the flavor of the ingredients, so you can get a lot of variety by just switching it up.  You can also experiment with browning or caramelizing the onions more or less, adding garlic, ginger, and tomato earlier or later, omitting ginger all together, cooking shorter/longer to change the texture, and adding finishing spices at the end.\n\nAn Ethiopian cook let me watch her make several dishes in Ethiopia; she usually made two at the same time. She always proportioned her ingredients for each dish in a small baking pan (about 6 x 9 inch) before starting.  She usually started with 2 very large shallots (probably the size of a small to medium red onion), one or two tomatoes for berbere dishes (they looked like roma tomatoes), a main ingredient, 6-8 cloves of garlic, and 1-2 green chili if using.  The green chili were about the size of serrano peppers, but not as spicy.  The flavor reminded me of Anaheim peppers. She always used sunflower oil. The main ingredient might be 3/4 to 1 cup split red lentils or yellow split peas, or about 1/2 kilo meat.  She didn't measure the berbere or turmeric, but added them until the color looked right.  The berbere in Ethiopia is vibrant and easier to gauge by color. I usually just taste and adjust.  She didn't use any fresh ginger in her dishes, but it adds a spicy sour note to the final dish depending on the amount and how early it is added in the cooking process.\n\nShe would start by adding the finely minced shallot to a dry pan, then add small amounts of oil or water while they broke down into a sauce. She would then add minced tomatoes (if using, usually for berbere dishes) and cook them down a bit, then berbere for red dishes or turmeric for alicha dishes. She liked to cook the berbere for at least 5 minutes, adding water as needed to prevent it from scorching. She said the longer you cook the berbere, the smoother and mellower the taste. Each blend I have used is a little different, so some are nice with 5 minutes of cooking, and others need longer to mellow out any bitter or sharp notes. My husband and I started adding the tomato after the berbere was cooked because it has a fresher, less-stewed flavor that we like.\n\nShe would then add the main ingredient, such as split red lentils (washed but still raw) or raw beef, or both together.  She said she never browns the meat for stews.  Then she would cook them in the sauce, stirring often, adding a touch of oil or water as needed until the ingredients were done and the sauce looked glossy but not too oily. The meat in Ethiopia isn't aged, so it is tougher but I found it to be more flavorful. Honestly, all of the fresh ingredients in Ethiopia were so delicious that even I couldn't mess up the food.\n\nShe liked to reserve the garlic (for berbere dishes) or garlic and green chili (for alicha and vegetable dishes) until the stew came off the burner. She usually crushed the garlic with a little salt for stews, but sliced them thinly for vegetable dishes.  The green chili was usually split in half for alicha lentil/pea stews, or sliced into thin rounds for vegetable dishes.  She would turn off the heat, stir in the garlic and green chili (if using), and let it stand 5 minutes before serving. The residual heat cooked them, but they still added freshness and punch at the end that really elevated the dish. She didn't use spiced butter, but when I have seen butter added it is only a small amount at the end. I have also seen recipes adding it sooner, but haven't tried making any.\n\nFor gomen, she would use 1 bunch of Ethiopian collard greens with the thick stems removed and leaves cut finely (about the same amount as a bunch of collard greens in US grocery stores), one or two shallots (split in half then sliced into thin strips), 10-12 cloves of garlic sliced thinly and 1-2 green chili sliced into thin rounds.  She would add the onion first, then the greens shortly after, and the garlic and green chili toward the end. You can add more onion or garlic for more flavor.\n\nFor Ethiopian spaghetti sauce, she would use 3-4 large shallots and an equal amount of tomatoes, add them to the dry pot at the same time, and adding oil and water as needed until they cooked down to a sauce. Then she added berbere, cooked it as long as needed, then turned off the burner and added the garlic crushed with salt.\n\nIf my stews taste a little flat, I usually try more crushed raw garlic at the end, or more fresh green chili for alicha dishes, or a very small amount of fresh ginger juice or ginger paste.  Stews usually taste a little saltier after cooling to the serving temperature, so I try to hold off on adjusting the salt until the stew has cooled a bit.\n\nI haven't made doro wot yet.  I might try it soon, hoping this video will get me on the right track:\u00a0[https://youtu.be/zi4AT6uYKUs?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/zi4AT6uYKUs?feature=shared)\n\nHope it helps!", "I recommend starting with doro tibs, or tibs in general - get used to the spicing and flavour profiles. Misir wot and shiro wot are both delicious and simple enough, and same with awaze or doro tibs. A good doro wot can take a while but is worth it. Tikil gomen and gomen wot are great too. Make a batch of things, they\u2019ll keep in the fridge for the week as you rotate through. I buy my injera, can\u2019t justify the bother to make it. So many great dishes, you\u2019re in for a treat."]}

Very good with the spread served.\n\nInjera - Fascinating texture and flavor. It's *stretchy* like some type of elastic material, but also soft and spongey. The flavor is pleasantly sour that would work well with savory or sweet dishes.\n\nChicken Doro Wot - Exceptional. That's really all there is to say, this was an excellent stew with rich flavor and nicely spiced. Just a little kick of heat. This is tied for my 2nd favorite dish.\n\nKik Alicha Wot - Incredibly delicious. I'd 100% add this to my homecooking rotation, it's an absolutely perfect stew for yellow split peas. This is also tied for my 2nd favorite dish from the sampler.\n\nFosolia - Excellent side dish. Very savory and flavorful, but not heavy. I almost polished off both the fosolia and kik alicha wot on the first go, they're fantastic.\n\nShiro Wot - This is #1. I don't know how shiro wot is typically eaten, but I'd happily eat a bowl of this with injera and call it a day. I cannot believe it's made from chickpea flour, it's like a savory, hot hummus without sesame, but thinner and so so so so so much more flavorful and yummy. Chickpeas really held their own here.\n\nGomen - Under seasoned, which is a shame because I know how to make simmered or sauteed greens extremely flavor packed. There was no reason for this spinach to be so bland, but it works as a palate cleanser. \n\nKey Sir - It's a nice little side. I probably wouldn't order it, but it's a nice way to use beetroot in a savory dish.\n\nAtkilt - This particular dish at this restaurant was quite bland. I know for a fact that you can make excellent, flavorful meals with cabbage and onions and carrot, etc but they dropped the ball on this one too.\n\nBeef Key Wot - Delicious, tender, flavorful. Excellent sauce.\n\nLamb Alicha Wot - Delicious, tender and flavorful as well. Another excellent sauce. I'd happily have either the beef or lamb dish over rice and injera, they're both wonderful. I might say the green sauce for the lamb Alicha Wot was a touch more to my preference, I like vegetal, herby green savory flavors tremendously.\n\nedit: I revise my review of the Atkilt and Gomen.

Is there a particular name for that type of base wat?\n\nAlso when cooking it I've experimented with the cooking times. Several times I've fried down the onions and berbere for up to five hours (constantly stirring -- work out of the year, but enjoyable with some music in the background) before proceeding to the next parts of the recipe. Other times I cook them for only for one hour or so. The difference is that the berbere and onions are much sweeter and \"full bodied\" when I do it the really slow way.

My current method is that I use around 40-45% white flour and 55-60% teff flour (although I am not very exact), .5-1 cup or so of sourdough starter, a tsp or two of baking soda, and enough water to make a batter. Then I let it sit for at least 20 hours.  When I make it, I add enough water to make a thin crepe batter and make the injera like I would a crepe on a non stick skillet (I use my portable induction burner as it has better heat control than my gas range).  \n\nI've made it a few times this way and it comes out almost exactly like what I am used to eating at the restaurants. Also it is pretty easy compared to the 100% teff recipe, so you can focus on making good wats to go with it.", "I believe the injera often served in US resturants is generally not 100% teff flour, often incorporating wheat flour. I think think it ok to use some wheat flour, you might even achieve an end product more similar to \"restaurant injera\" if the majority of the flour is wheat flour.\n\nI cannot cite a source for this, I think I just heard it somewhere. I have made injera before and with 100% teff and I found it to be different from what is served in US restaurants.", "Did you buy teff flour from the same website?"]}

Until that point, the bottom was wrinkly instead of smooth, there was more cracking, and it was hard to get the \"eyes\" to appear.\n\nI've been making injera regularly for a couple of years, and the texture doesn't come out right unless it is well fermented. After I mix in the ersho and flour into a dough, I cover it with a few inches of water and leave it alone for the 3-5 days depending on how warm the house is. It bubbles up, creating a foamy top and air pockets in the dough, then settles down, and the water separates at the top.\n\nThe trick is to make sure the yeast is hungry, but not starving, so when the absit is added for the second rise it carbonates well, making the eyes on the top of the injera. If it is too active, I have a hard time getting it to turn out right, but I am still learning. If I wait too long, the batter isn't as active when I add the absit.\n\nThis guide really helped me, except ignore the advice to add baking soda or baking powder to injera to make eyes appear, it destroys the sour flavor.

I'm trying to become adept at the vegetarian wats and gomen.\n\nMy question is, these wats end up tasting a bit bland compared to what I would normally get at a restaurant. I realize resto food is always going to be more rich, but I'm not sure if maybe there are additional spices/techniques I can use to make the wats have a deeper/more complex/authentic taste.\n\nFollowing Mulunesh Bekay's \"Ethiopian Feast\" cookbook (which I highly recommend!), I typically make lentil wats using the following recipes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Misir Wat recipe:\\*\\*\n\n\\- saute 2 chopped yellow onions and about 2 tsps ginger-garlic paste in niter kibbeh; do this for about 10 mins until it smells good and looks kind of translucent\n\n\\- add 2-3 tbsp berbere powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper and a bit of extra canola oil or niter kibbeh, mix and saute for a few mins\n\n\\- add 1-1.5 cups red lentils and 1.5 cups water, stir and cook on low for about 30-40 mins, stirring occasionally (or put in crockpot on high heat for about 4 hours)\n\n\\- a few minutes before taking off the heat, add about a teaspon of mekelesha kimem finishing spice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Alicha Wat recipe\\*\\*\n\n\\- repeat step 1 above (saute 2 chopped yellow onions and about 2 tsps ginger-garlic paste in niter kibbeh)\n\n\\- add 2-3 tbsps of tumeric, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper and some canola oil, saute a bit more\n\n\\- add 1-1.5 cups yellow lentils or yellow split peas and 1.5 cups water, stir and cook on low for about 30-40 mins, stirring occasionally (or put in crockpot on high heat for about 4 hours)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you all have any tips for stepping up these recipes?

Often people will mix the two varieties in the appropriate proportions to get the shade that they prefer. There may also be some culinary attributes that are not the color, but associated with the color, such as the flavor and the texture of the flour.", "Those are lies."]}

{"title": "Authentic berbere recipies, corroborated!! ", "selftext": "I've been cross-referencing some berbere recipes online and I would like to compile my findings here! perhaps an etheopian can speak to how accurate I am. First, my qualifications: \n\n* I am not Etheopian at all! I'm an Ashkenazi Jew living in the Twin Cities. \n* I speak very little amharic; just enough to ask for some etheopian pantry staples (berbere, niter kibbeh, korarima, etc) \n* I do study lingustics and food science! \n* I am a decent home cook, and I cook etheopian food all the time (usually three times a week!) and have a pretty good relationship with a local etheopian restaurant that sells me spices imported from etheopia. \n* I have not made berbere completely from scratch, but I have compiled a lot of recipes from the internet\n\nSO! What are my findings? \n\n# \"\"Berbere\"\" (the white person version) \n\nFirst I want to start with the worst type of recipe out there: CURRY POWDER PLUS PAPRIKA. These recipes hurt my soul because they do not evoke the aroma of etheopian food! All of these recipies are made by Anglophone white men. Every single one I've found. some of them show their big fancy stack of generic ground indian spices and like three types of artisanal european paprika and some cyanne and then mix them together in a bowl with a whisk and say \"THIS IS BARBERRY, AN EXOTIC SPICE BLEND FROM ETHEOPIA\" and it's like. dude stop. \n\n  \nThose recipes will work in a pinch, but they are really quite disappointing. These are also all the premade blends you will find at grocery stores. If you manage to find berbere somewhere with amharic (Ge'ez script) writing on it, it's probably a better bet. This is the classic \"the more languages the better\" trick for shopping for global foods. \n\n  \nUnless you are buying berbere from etheopians or eritrians who made it themsevles, always check for a list of ingredients. If you don't know what you're looking for, make sure there are at least two words in the ingredients list that sound like magical herbs from a fairytale. if you do know what you're looking for, then you don't need me to give you a list (but I will anyway below in the next few sections). \n\n  \nFrom here on, all of the recipes I have seen (with the exception of one, made by the owner of the etheopian/eritrian food truck in new york) were entirely in amharic, some of which had subtitles in english, but most of which didn't\n\n# Dry Berbere (berbere made from already dried ingredients)\n\nThis method seems to be pretty common among Etheopians. Every recipe was slightly different, but I'll list all of the herbs and spices (and descriptions) of more widespread and then indigenous Etheopian spices. I know a lot about spices and I was able to pick up on some Amharic names for the spices,and research what the spices are based on that. A lot of this knowledge of these spices is based on this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXccgeOLdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEXccgeOLdY) I recommend giving it a watch! her berbere recipe is also fantastic, but it doesn't fit in this category. \n\n  \nThis method uses dried whole spices and sundried aromatics. You can dry these yourself in an oven or in the sun, or buy them pre-sundried or pre-dried by some other method. I promise you that every corner you would cut for this recipe has been cut by an etheopian already, so don't feel too bad about using garlic granuals instead of garlic that you dried yourself in the sun. \n\n  \nAdditionally, if you're using this guide to make berbere, I recommend NOT using every single thing on this list! Not a single recipe for berbere had EVERYTHING here, so don't go out of your way to get every single one of these ingredients. \n\n  \nAll the spices are gathered and separated into bowls. First the stems and on average half of the seeds of a FUCK ton of whole dried chili peppers are heated and toasted in a pan until fragrant, and then removed to a woven basket or bowl. Then, each of the spices is toasted until aromatic. use a spoon to move them around and keep them from burning, and add them to the same basket or bowl and the peppers. Everyone who added salt to their berbere toasted that too, but that doesn't do anything (food science!), so I wouldn't bother. \n\n  \nOnce all the spices have cooled, \n\n  \nWIDESPREAD SPICES:\n\n* cumin\n* black cumin (kala jeera; closely related to cumin, in the carrot family) \n* nigella seeds (also called black cumin but completely unrelated)\n* ajwain \n* coriander\n* cinnamon\n* black peppercorns\n* fenugreek\n* dried whole garlic\n* dried whole shallots\n* dried whole ginger \n* dried rosemary \n\nCHILI PEPPERS: \n\n* kashmiri chilis (a type of chili cultivated in south asia, but used in a great deal of berbere recipes) \n* guajillo chilis, or similar cultivar (I have seen california chilis, new mexico chilis, or anything similar used instead of these) \n* piri-piri chilis (this is a cultivar of the tabasco pepper, a different species. As far as I can tell, piri-piri is RARELY used in berbere, mostly reserved for mitmita, a different spice blend; but I could be wrong. I only saw it in one recipe made by a white guy, but everything else in his recipe seemed accurate to me and fits in this cateogry. \n\nETHEOPIAN SPICES: \n\n*  korarima (HIGHLY recommended. ALL RECIPES HAVE IT. also known as \"etheopian cardamom\" or \"false cardamom.\" Sold in whole pods, removed centers of pods, and only the dark colored seeds. similar in aroma to black cardamom, but less smokey. some recipies actually do use black cardamom instead. The only people who used green cardamom for berbere were non-etheopians, but etheopians still use green cardamom in their cooking sometimes.) \n* besobela (HIGHLY recommended. ALL RECIPES HAVE IT. also known as etheopian sacred basil. It's really quite different from basil, and I don't think subbing basil is acceptable.) \n* rue (I really recommend this one! most recipies have it. it is in the same genus as szechuan peppercorns and has a similar aroma as well! That genus is in the same family as the citrus genus, so it's not a surprise that rue is citrusy. It's faintly bitter as well, but not overpoweringly so, and it is really quite tasty)\n* long pepper (I have yet to try this one on its own! It's not as common as the others listed in berbere recipes.) \n* etheopian mustard seed (different from normal mustard seeds! the scientific name for these is Brassica carinata. You can sub yellow or black mustard seeds but that would be considered a little weird; one recipe did do this though. these are actually not very common in berbere recipies online.) \n* koseret (this one smells like sage and oregano! I really like it, but only a few recipies used it, so feel free to omit.) \n\n\n\n# Wet Berbere (prepared with some fresh and some dried ingredients)\n\n  \nThis is the same as above, except the peppers are prepared first with some fresh ingredients. Grind the peppers first, and then gather:\n\n* fresh rosemary \n* fresh garlic\n* fresh besobela (or dried tbh! just soak it before using) \n* fresh rue seeds (or dried tbh! just soak a bit before using)\n* whole red onion or shallots (you should keep some of the skins on, but remove any layers with dirt on them. the skins lend a great flavor when ground up and dried, similar to onion powder.)\n* whole garlic (people usually remove the skins) \n* soaked fenugreek seeds (they should expand and turn soft)\n* fresh ginger\n* fresh rosemary\n* tej (etheopian honey wine) \n\ngrind these all together with the ground peppers and grind it up! do it in batches if you need to, and don't worry about making it homogenious; that will come later. Once ground coarsely, dry in the sun or simulate a warm dry sunny day with an oven as low as it will go until everything is dried up. move it around every now and then to prevent it from burning. \n\n  \nMix in the dried spices from the dry berbere mix and grind again until you have a powder. \n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\n  \nberbere is fantastic!!!!! mmmmm berbere.... mmmmmmm ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethiopianfood/comments/1gr081v/authentic_berbere_recipies_corroborated/", "created_utc": 1731572367.0, "score": 6, "author": "misterlipman", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/ethiopianfood/comments/1gr081v/authentic_berbere_recipies_corroborated/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["This is a wonderfully comprehensive guide!

They can help you navigate the choices specific to the restaurant. \n\nThat said, my personal \"safe but so good\" choices are almost always:\n\n* Plenty of injera. You really need to eat all of the food using injera (unless it's soup, obviously). Don't make the mistake of eating with a fork or spoon. And don't eat the injera like it is a side of bread. It's a peculiar sour pancake, not a side of garlic bread. You tear off a piece big enough to pinch up some food and pop it into your mouth. The flavor of the injera is an important counterpoint to the food, and is so much better in the same mouthful than just one or the other. It is literally your edible utensil. So you are out of injera, you are out of delicious utensils! Don't hesitate to ask for more! \n* Some kind of beef tibs (easy to eat with injera for beginners)\n* Some kind of chicken awaze (usually no bones, also easy to eat)\n* Some kind of lentils (a bit harder to eat, scoop it up best you can, and watch out, misir wat can be HOT, maybe try the yellow lentils). I'm not ordinarily a lentil fan, but Ethiopian lentils are something else altogether.\n* Atakilt wat (spiced carrots, onion, cabbage and potatoes with turmeric and other warm spices), but ask how spicy it is. It needs to be richly spiced to really shine, it doesn't have to be crazy hot, but ASK. But this is a really nice, earthy, filling dish that is kind of embracing compared to the punchier character of the tibs and awaze. Watch out for cheap buffets that just serve a bland barely seasoned version of this for the spicewary. It's OK, but it really needs love and spice, if not heat.\n* Eat the plate! The injera that everything is served on top of soaks up the stray juices and is delicious! Eat it with more injera, because it is obviously very messy. I am always disappointed when a restaurant doesn't serve their meals atop injera. \n\nYou're in for a really great time. Enjoy!\n\nEdit: added some stuff"]}

{"title": "Ordering at Ethiopian Restaurant - why so expensive?", "selftext": "I live in the Midwest, Indiana more specifically. I try to hit up Ethiopian restaurants as much as possible - the food is always incredible and I crave it (plus, it's vegan friendly which is a huge bonus) but something I continue to run into is simple, pared down menus and waitstaff that don't speak fluent English and so are unable to explain clearly the pricing/ordering system - I've ended up paying $40-50 for a LUNCH which seems a little too astronomical in my book.\n\nMy partner & I don't know how to approach figuring this out - I did some googling but it's mostly HOW to order or WHAT to order at an Ethiopian restaurant, which I'm not having trouble with. I'm mostly seeking to understand if I'm doing something wrong - am I ordering incorrectly? Is it really buffet style and you can ask for \"refills\" of certain dishes that come on the platter with injera?\n\nI ordered a veggie platter with my partner yesterday for $18.99 and she asked if we wanted two and we said yes. I wish I had taken a picture but unfortunately I didn't - I wasn't extremely full after we split our two orders on ONE platter and I guess I'm wondering if it's silly for me to think that paying $40-50 for a meal would leave me feeling very full and satisfied?\n\n  \nEDIT/UPDATE : Thanks for all your responses - I definitely appreciate the well-rounded view on eating Ethiopian food, the customs, and the pricing. I obviously needed to adjust my expectations in regards to pricing and how the food is prepared & how long that process takes.

It is also common practice for people who dine together to eat off the same platter. \n\nWhat I know is common to get more of is the injera (bread).

The higher quality restaurants that use real teff etc might be a touch more, but I don't find the prices you site astronomical for this cuisine, especially if I'm understanding this correctly it's for two people. \n\nThere is definitely a college vibe to some Ethiopian restaurants, where a bunch of University students will share some platters, and I suppose for them they might break it up more ways and reduce the cost. I'm a bit more beastly or curious however you want to look at it!\n\nI hope that that experience isn't turning you off to the cuisine too much, as it is quite unique, communal, and healthful.", "Eh I think that\u2019s a bit steep for lunch yeah. 12 would be more reasonable.

Basic vegetarian dishes like lentils and shiro are low $20s, and meats $25 to $30. It doesn't sound like you're ordering wrong, I haven't heard of free refills. Like others said, serving all of the food on one platter is normal. I'm not sure if I would be full after eating a veggie combo, probably not. I do appreciate the veggie combos though as I would never order that many dishes at once, considering each one is at least $20. At my favorite restaurant [now shut down] my usual order was a beef dish, a lamb dish, and a carrot/cabbage/potato dish. They also served a salad for free. This would be about $75 [in 2020] and provided 2 adults with 2 dinners [with salad only eaten in the restaurant and the second dinner being less gluttonous]. I started learning how to cook Ethiopian at home because I love the lentils and paying $20 for them seems outrageous. Practically though, it is a lot of work, so you've got to enjoy cooking.", "The Ethiopian spot by my place is 10$ for the veggie platter and it's enough to make you full. I'm vegan too, but I had to stop eating there because the cross contamination seeps through the food. It's location dependant pricing."]}
