{"title": "The biggest reason to go organic", "selftext": "Most people don't understand just how problematic synthetic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in conventional agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?  As these studies showcase, these pesticides, found in normal amounts in children, not children with high exposure, are implicated in reduced IQ and cognitive abilities:\n\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507778\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507776\n- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003160/\n- http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/05/17/peds.2009-3058.full.pdf+html\n- http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978\n\nTake a few minutes to ponder the ramifications; the food we eat may literally be making us dumber.  And yes, food is a major pesticide source despite what industry might claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18414640.  Continuing on, the most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a lot of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Guess which subpopulation scientists are beginning to find has significantly reduced paraoxanase activity?  People with autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297937 -- and this year a large study found associations between organophosphates and autism: http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978.  More work needs to be done on this front, but the early findings are concerning to say the least.\n\nThe data against organophosphates continues to pile up and has resulted in the thousands of scientists represented by the Union of Concerned Scientists wanting organophosphates banned.  Unfortunately, politics wins at the EPA: http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/epa-and-pesticides.html\n\nThere will be a time when society looks back in shame on its use of synthetic pesticides.  But make no mistake, the greed of chemical manufacturers and the cognitive dissonance of those who utilize these pesticides will result in unquantifiable damage before we get to that point.

They get their start in nurseries in inland Northern California before being shipped south in an effort to mimic natural progression of winter to spring. They finish their lifespan along the California coast in places such as Monterey and Ventura counties.\n\nRegardless of whether one of these baby plants \u2013 known as starts \u2013 ends up on a conventional or organic farm, the nursery soil is pumped with fumigants to eradicate the pests and diseases that can haunt strawberry farmers.\n\nIf they\u2019re matured on an organic farm, these strawberries still can be certified organic.\n\nThe federal code allows organic farmers to use strawberry starts grown in fumigated soil if there are no organic starts \u201ccommercially available.\u201d)", "Pesticide residue on virtually all food in America is negligible and the health effects of glyphosate have widely not been found to be dangerous by most academic reviewers except for the IARC which is of course the one that got the most press lol.

{"title": "Request for feedback on my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals (x-post)", "selftext": "I recently finished reading Count Down ([https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/count-down-1)) by Shanna H. Swan & Stacey Colino (2020) which is about how toxic chemicals including endocrine disrupting chemicals are damaging our health including our sexual health. I am brand-new to this subject and I was shocked by how much harm we are doing to ourselves. As I was reading the book I was noting down recommendations by the authors for how to avoid toxic chemicals with an eye towards writing some kind of list I could share with my family & close friends.\n\nAfter reading the book I felt like a \"starter list\" would be best to focus on \"Do's & don't's\" as the easiest entry point. Then if people are interested enough, they can choose to take the next step of finding healthy natural organic alternatives.\n\nSo below is my starter list of ways for people to avoid toxic chemicals. **I would love your feedback and critique if you have time. I am especially interested about whether any of my suggestions below are wrong or out of date.**\n\nThank you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Only use cleaning products that have ingredients you can identify e.g. water, vinegar, baking soda, essential oils. Look for home-made cleaner recipes online.\n* Don't use or purchase carpets, indoor mats, or rugs that are treated with perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Good alternatives to carpets include solid wood, tile, cork or natural linoleum flooring\n* If you do choose to have carpet, opt for natural materials\n* When selecting area rugs, choose wool or natural plant materials. Look for materials such as jute, seagrass or sisal, and natural rubber nonskid padding.\n* Use low-VOC adhesives to install carpets\n* Regardless of flooring, use doormats and don't wear shoes indoors. Taking off your shoes will prevent tracking in dirt and pollutants.\n* Avoid stain or waterproofing treatments on your carpets\n* Vacuum all carpets and rugs thoroughly using a machine with a HEPA filter at least once a week\n* Don't use shoe polishes and carpet cleaners containing trichloroethylene (TCE)\n* Wipe surfaces of dust using a wet cloth or mop\n* Don't use plastic containers for food storage. Use glass, stainless steel, ceramic, or porcelain containers with tops or aluminium foil.\n* Never reheat food in plastic in the microwave. Transfer it to a plate or a bowl.\n* Don't use nonstick cookware. Switch to cast-iron pots & pans or stainless steel. Also consider ceramic, porcelain, anodized aluminium cookware, or glass bakeware.\n* Only drink water that has already been filtered for toxic chemicals & microplastics\n* Use glass or stainless steel for drink bottles\n* Avoid black plastic cooking utensils\n* Don't use a plastic reusable cup or a bamboo reusable cup. Choose a stainless steel, ceramic, porcelain or glass reusable cup.\n* Eat a home-cooked fresh food diet. Choose fresh ingredients such as loose fruit and loose vegetables. Buy from bulk stores where you can refill your own containers.\n* Buy organic seasonal locally-grown food\n* if you are unable to buy organic food 100% of the time, avoid eating non-organic products which contain the highest amounts of pesticide residues such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples\n* Avoid packaged food or drink such as plastic bottles, food wrapped in plastic wrap, takeaways in fast food containers, food packaged in greaseproof lining, canned foods, packaging labelled with recycling codes 3 or 7\n* Reduce your consumption of canned food\n* Don't eat fast food\n* Don't eat microwave popcorn\n* Don't drink out of cans\n* To avoid exposure to dioxins (a harmful chemical) eat a vegan diet. More than 90% of human exposure to dioxins is through food, mainly meat and dairy products, fish and shellfish.\n* If you do want to eat meat, avoid processed meat. Choose hormone-free beef and hormone-free dairy.\n* If you do want to eat fish, choose fish with the lowest toxic chemical content\n* Use period products that are plastic-free, unscented, and labelled \"totally chlorine free (TCF)\"\n* Where possible use reusable period products such as silicon cups, reusable pads, reusable tampon applicators, and period pants/period underwear\n* Don't use anti-mold paints in the home\n* Don't wear face masks and other personal protective equipment containing nanographene and other nanoparticles\n* Buy non-toxic sunscreen and non-toxic baby sunscreen\n* Buy children's toys that are labelled phthalate-free, PVC-free, BPA-free, BPS-free, and BPF-free\n* Avoid children's toys that smell strongly of chemicals or are heavily scented.\n* Avoid soft plastic children's toys, as these can contain endocrine disruptors like phthalates.\n* Choose natural rubber children's toys\n* If a children's toy is painted or treated with varnish or other coatings, make sure it is non-toxic, free from lead, and meant for children\n* When furnishing the playroom, include natural materials whenever possible. Choose wooden tables and chairs, with cushions if desired, and baskets, rather than plastic bins, to hold children's toys and art supplies\n* Unpack any new children's toy and leave it outdoors to let some of the hazardous chemicals evaporating\n* Buy solid wooden children's toys with as few glued parts as possible\n* Buy unvarnished and painted children's toys wherever possible or watch out for non-toxic and natural finishes\n* Don't buy school uniforms that have PFAS-based stain resistance (check the labels before you buy)\n* Don't use face paint with toxic ingredients on children\n* Buy nappies that are chemical free. Opt for organic cotton, fragrance-free, and reusable nappies\n* Don't use personal care or beauty products that contain toxic chemicals. Buy certified 100% organic products packaged in glass or ceramic jars that are labelled paraben free, fragrance free, and perfume free.\n* Use PFAS-free dental floss\n* When buying abroad or online, be aware the same product can contain harmful chemicals depending on where you buy it\n* If you live outside the EU, choose products that are sold in the EU. The EU has the strictest chemical regulations in the world, and so these cosmetics may have fewer harmful chemicals in them.\n* Don't use nail varnish and nail remover\n* Don't purchase or use products with the ingredients 'fragrance' or 'parfum'\n* Don't use vinyl shower curtains\n* Don't use scented candles or antibacterial soap\n* Don't use air fresheners\n* Purchase items & products that are free of PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and other harmful plastics\n* Buy products free of free of flame-retardant chemicals and toxic adhesives (such as those containing formaldehyde)\n* Choose natural-wood tables and cabinets that are made without synthetic wood or particleboard\n* Buy organic-cotton mattress pads, not ones with the plastic barriers that will release their own chemicals into the air\n* Don't buy clothes that are treated with fluorinated chemicals called PFAS to make them waterproof or stain resistant\n* Don't use synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic fertilisers\n* Use organic fertiliser (home-made or store-bought) e.g. use grass clippings as fertiliser on your lawn\n* Avoid handling till receipts as much as possible\n* Don't put till receipts in the recycling bin \u2013 because they can contaminate the entire recycling stream\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Check suspect ingredients in hair sprays, nail polishes, hair dyes, shampoos, body wash products, body creams, moisturisers, make-ups, soaps, lipsticks, deodorants, antiperspirants, cleaning products, and fragrances against the SIN List ([https://sinlist.chemsec.org/](https://sinlist.chemsec.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As a rule it's best to avoid products labelled as having anti-microbial properties\n* Use mobile apps to identify toxic chemicals: In Germany, France and the UK, you can use apps to identify cosmetics containing chemicals that you should avoid. In Germany, use Tox Fox, in France use Clean Beauty, and in the UK try Giki Badges ([https://badges.giki.earth/](https://badges.giki.earth/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Edit (2021-05-20): Fixing the Giki Badges URL)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/ncdjf2/request_for_feedback_on_my_starter_list_of_ways/", "created_utc": 1621011916.0, "score": 34, "author": "dave-underwood", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/ncdjf2/request_for_feedback_on_my_starter_list_of_ways/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["This is excellent!

They are associated with a variety of ailments, including suppressed immune function, thyroid disease, testicular and kidney disease, cancers, and liver damage.

EPA is not required to disclose many inert ingredients in pesticides, and manufacturers usually withhold information about inert ingredients as \u201ctrade secrets\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d information.\n\n\u201cThis PFAS fiasco shows that public trust in EPA having a full accounting of these materials and their safety is utterly misplaced,\u201d added Bennett, whose organization has also been highly critical of EPA\u2019s response to the unfolding PFAS contamination scandals.\u00a0 \u201cUntil EPA acts, states need to adopt their own safeguards and chemical disclosure requirements because they certainly cannot depend upon the diligence of EPA.\u201d"]}

The high cost of organic foods is a big put-off. It's tough to buy everything organic in the kitchen. I try to pick some organic and some non-organic stuff.", "Friendly Store To Make Healthy Food More Accessible\n\nBy Amanda Froelich | May 1, 2016\n\nThe '365 Store' is a budget-friendly version of Whole Foods that will be opening in May.\n\nCredit: PortlandTribute.com\n\nWhole Foods is many things, but affordable for the majority of the population, it is not. \n\nBecause the health-focused grocery store is often referred to as \u2018Whole Paycheck,\u2019 the chain is attempting to rebrand itself by launching a new store which will offer affordable and convenient organic food options.\n\nBasically, the \u201c365 store\u201d will be a budget-friendly version of Whole Foods aimed at Millennials. \n\nThe name of the new chain stems from the Whole Foods\u2019 private label brand, whose products are a bit more economical in comparison to the other options sold at their stores.\n\nOne Green Planet relays that because a number of mainstream and specialty grocers also offer organic offers, the company hopes to set itself apart once again with this new development.\n\nAppealing to the Millennial generation is an intelligent move, for they are the most powerful group of consumers in the U.S. In fact, nearly 25% of the population falls under this generational segment. In addition, it\u2019s become trendy to \u2018live green, eat clean, and act consciously.\u2019 \n\nExpensive prices, however, are a big set back to this demographic.\n\nAccording to the company, the first store is set to open on May 25 in the Silverlake neighborhood of Los Angeles. \n\nAs the chain develops, Whole Foods will be partnering with companies to offer a variety of services to their customers.\n\nSome things will remain the same in the new stores. For example, an Allegro Coffee Company bar will continue to serve craft coffee and beer.\n\nCredit: sprudge.com\n\nJeff Turnas, president of the 365 stores, told USA Today:\n\n\u201cThe idea is to not only entice customers through the door, but get them to stay a while.\u201d\n\nIf the atmosphere, layout, and diversity of food options are similar to present-day Whole Foods stores, we\u2019re sure customers will have no problem sticking around for the bit. The new stores will also feature a rewards program that offers everything from coupons to \u201cpersonalized nutrition insights,\u201d the company\u2019s website states.\n\nMore: http://www.trueactivist.com/whole-foods-to-launch-budget-friendly-store-to-make-healthy-food-more-accessible/?", "And it will still be 100 miles away...", "If the world were to go full organic right now, 3 billions people would die of starvation in a month.\n\n\n\nOur society has been built on non-organic agriculture - and there is no turning back at this point. We **cannot** feed the world on organic farming methods. This is not the medieval era anymore. Not unless you want to kill 3 billion people you entitled insufferable cucks."]}

The plant produces those things to fight off pests.\n\nThere are also other differences in how a small local farmer grows vs large mono culture operations, which would definitely play into the whole picture.

I've had to spray conventional herbicide that could kill you if you aren't careful with it. Nothing remotely close to this exists in the organic world. There's a lot of negative disinformation out there coming from the conventional side, the bulk of it is blatantly untrue.", "I have been part of the organic movement since the 1990's. I do think that ceding control of the organic label to the Federal government was a mistake. However, all is not lost: the label still has meaning, and there is of course potential to make it even better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now, a big concern with fruits and even vegetables to me is that ground can be sprayed sprayed with glyphosate (= RoundUp or generic equivalents), then berries or similar grown in bags or containers on it, usually in a high tunnel (unheated greenhouse). This is, of course, entirely counter to the spirit of organic (NOP) legislation, but technically legal, since the fruit plants do not actually physically contact the herbicide-contaminated ground (**ON-EDIT:** *see the link from stillwaters23 directly below, showing that NOP finally slammed the brakes on this practice in 2019*). Good groups like the Real Organic movement, Beyond Pesticides, and the Cornucopia Institute are organizing against this, but progress has been slow, and tactics / proposed solutions sometimes questionable (e.g. - Real Organic proposes a second label on top of USDA Organic, which strikes me as ludicrous and ultimately defeatist).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for allowable organic sprays, there really is little I would be concerned about, compared to conventional. Rotenone (natural, but still implicated as a cause of Parkinson's, etc.) was effectively banned from organic long ago. The newer sprays are pretty darn gentle, as far as I can tell: I follow the label directions for safety precautions, and have never seen a bee die-off or experienced acute health effects. Cornucopia does things like lobby against iron phosphate (=Sluggo), but what the hell, guys; how else are we supposed to control slugs in humid climates? The frequency of spraying by organic growers can also be higher, especially in humid (disease) and ag-intensive (insects) regions, but that's what one has to do when using gentler materials.", "I work in the organic industry. Organic is definitely better \u2014 there are many, many toxic pesticides and other materials that cannot be used in organic. Is there room for improvement? Of course. One of the hot-button items right now is what\u2019s known as EPA List 4 inert ingredients. These are a group of hundreds of \u201cinert\u201d ingredients that are allowed and mostly used in organic pesticides and herbicides. They are not the \u201cactive\u201d ingredients, but rather other things added to pesticides that make them work better. The materials these inert ingredients are derived from are not public, but they are allowed under a blanket rule. It\u2019s really problematic because List 4 is obsolete and can no longer be changed. But if you did a wholesale ban on List 4 ingredients many of the herbicide and pesticide options available to organic farmers would be taken off the market. In many cases organic farming would not be economically viable without these pesticides.", "If you suspect some product or factory is not really selling organic, make a formal report to the USDA.

Conventional pesticides typically  linger on the outside of the plant or are pulled in through the roots. These pesticides can not be washed off, and will absolutely be part of the food you eat. The very few(almost completely worthless) organic (naturally \nDerived) pesticides pretty much have to be applied directly to the bug in order to work. They will not work even half a day later in our aplication. \nSo perhaps if you squint real hard then they are similar but really what you are hearing is a bs line fed by conventional farmers.", "I do organic certification for a living, so verifying those farms and processors that are using organic labels. Organic producers have a strict set of regulations they're required to follow in order to call and label their products being organic, part of that being able to trace every single organic ingredient back to the source and following organic production practices that Foster nutrient recycling and crop rotation/diversity. Yes, products that are labeled as pesticides are allowed for use, but only if they're not synthetic or have been approved to be used in organic production - The majority of those products being biologicals or different types of oils (neem oil for example). Even to use approved pesticides, organic operations are required to follow a strict set of guidelines and when they can use those. \n\nThat said, organic is a label that consumers can use so they know the production practices behind the products they are buying at the grocery store. I don't they think this takes the place of direct farm to consumer sales, so if you know the farmer that you're buying products from and have a relationship and know what production practices they're doing then yeah I would definitely go over that. But if you don't have access to a farm to buy items from directly, you can use organics as a way to know how your food was produced. \n\nIf you're interested, here are all the regulatory requirements that are organic operations are required to follow -https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-M/part-205?toc=1. \n\nUltimately, organic was designed as a way for consumers to know what the type of food they're buying is when they don't have direct access to Farmers, and as a way for Farmers to create the food that represents the true cost of production. Conventional agriculture gets large government subsidies, so you're still paying more for the sticker price for conventional food, it's just on your tax bill instead of up front. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions.

However, new research reveals for the first time that even brief contact with a common herbicide can cause lasting damage to the brain, with effects that may persist long after direct exposure has ended.\n\nIn a groundbreaking new study, Arizona State University researcher Ramon Velazquez and his colleagues at the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), part of City of Hope, demonstrate that mice exposed to the herbicide glyphosate develop significant brain inflammation, which is associated with neurodegenerative disease. The findings suggest the brain may be much more susceptible to the damaging effects of the herbicide than previously thought. Glyphosate is one of the most pervasive herbicides used in the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nThe research, which appears in the Journal of Neuroinflammation, identifies an association between glyphosate exposure in mice and symptoms of neuroinflammation, as well as accelerated Alzheimer\u2019s disease-like pathology. This study tracks both the presence and impact of glyphosate\u2019s byproducts in the brain long after exposure ends, showing an array of persistent, damaging effects on brain health.\n\nGlyphosate exposure in mice also resulted in premature death and anxiety-like behaviors, which replicates findings by others examining glyphosate exposure in rodents. Further, the scientists discovered these symptoms persisted even after a 6-month recovery period during which exposure was discontinued.\n\nConcerning Byproducts in the Brain\n\nAdditionally, the investigation demonstrated that a byproduct of glyphosate \u2014aminomethylphosphonic acid\u2014accumulated in brain tissue, raising serious concerns about the chemical\u2019s safety for human populations.", "This and NHL.  And yet we still, for 30 years, have the same chorus of idiots chanting \"Organic is a scam!  Sprays feed the world!  Glyphosate isn't harmful!  Round-up is safe, it's sold everywhere!\""]}

The Bolthouse carrot juice is good, but this was AMAZING.\n\nIn my experience carrot flavour has a lot of factors: some varieties are better for storage and some are better fresh. Cores vary by type. Temperature (drought and stress makes them woody) and having a frost makes them sweeter. Freshness also has an impact on the remaining moisture, and since carrots keep for a long time, the ones you buy organic or not can be months out of the ground. \n\nFor awesome carrots, depending on your growing region, source a small market gardener and buy a bunch in the fall. They might be funny looking, but they taste great! If you find a source, you can store a bulk purchase of carrots if you have a basement or garage or there's a method with sand in your fridge (yes, messy)\n\nYou can also revive dried out carrots, organic or not, by soaking in a little water overnight if they get wrinkly."]}

Also-- farmers start to break even at about $50,000 gross sales; you'll have a hard time meeting this on 5 acres. I recommend you read the rest of these pamphlets as they are made for new farmers. Good luck. It might be that you want a garden and not a farm business-- people have a hard time surviving on farms alone, and as these documents will tell you, most farm businesses are usually paid for by added income that a manager has from a second or third job.

People that have started from nothing and already have some experience with the trial and error aspect of farming.\n\nOne bit of advice that I would give to you though is to not bite off more than you can chew.  It's super exciting planning what you're going to plant the upcoming season, but it's really easy to get carried away.  Before you know it everything is suffering because you can't keep up with weeds, bugs, fertilizing, watering, harvesting, etc.  I would suggest not cultivating any more than 1 acre per person that is planning on working.  That is about as much of a work load as a single person can handle farming intensively.  Are you planning on doing crop rotation and successive plantings?", "Good luck!  First and foremost.  Take a look at what other people are doing in the area and see if there is an unmet need.  It might also be nice to get some chickens and sell some eggs.  Their poop is also very good for berry bushes!  Decide if you want to be certified organic and research the requirements.  You can also go with the new moniker 'naturally grown'.  Make sure you treat your customers right and be prepared to answer their questions and spend some time with them.  Customer loyalty and word of mouth is the best way to market your products!"]}

In response to questions including, \"How likely is a labeling requirement to decrease or increase the price of food for consumers in Washington State?\", the paper answers:\n\n\"The lack of uniform standards, known as harmonization, and the potential for discrimination of policies among states and across countries and their agreements makes mandatory labeling of GM products a trade issue. Mandatory labeling, especially at a state versus federal level, is likely to affect trade and impose higher costs on firms producing and selling products in Washington. These costs are likely to be passed on to the consumer resulting in higher food prices. Importantly, these costs will be borne by firms and consumers for both GM and non-GM foods as labeling foods as non-GM will require oversight costs.\"\n\nIn response to the questions, \"How would compliance be monitored and enforced? What are estimated costs associated with effective oversight and enforcement?\"\n\n\"Responsibility and costs for monitoring and compliance of I-522 would accrue to both the public and private firms; the estimates have a wide range, and could vary from a few hundred thousand to millions of dollars annually. The wide range reflects the lack of 'after the fact' economic data and reliance on prospective estimates that have variable assumptions about the levels of administrative oversight, laboratory testing, and litigation associated with ensuring compliance.\"\n\nAnd the paper repeats what should be obvious:\n\n\"There have been no statistically significant, repeatable evidence of adverse human health consequences due to GM products. Given the current state of knowledge and evidence, GM foods are considered to 'not differ' in safety as compared with foods with non-GM ingredients. Continued surveillance of food safety, including long-term health effects, is warranted for both GM and non-GM containing foods.\"\n\nLuckily, the initiative in Washington state failed at the ballot.

Some of it is linked to ag chemical companies. Research into this area is complicated due to how complex soil microbiome and environments are, but in general organic has proven again and again to have many benefits. Many folks criticize it because of \"lower yields\" but that does not look at the full picture of soil health, nutrition, and impact. Also yields are comparable in many situations (and also the fact that we waste so much food and resources are poorly allocated, we could feed more people on less than we grow now. Poverty and food scarcity is by design, not a \"not enough\" problem). There are strict regulations that control the organic label in the USA (and other countries as well), it's not just a lip-service marketing label. Yes, big corporations have latched onto it to make money but we live in a capitalist hellscape where this happens to everything. That reality does not discount the real benefits to soil health, ecosystem services, and the fact that in the face of climate change we need resilient food production. The way we do \"conventional\" ag just isn't resilient with the number of inputs, monoculture, and chemicals. Don't even get me started on the anti-organic propaganda that states \"organic uses pesticides too\" which is such a straw man. While technically true, it's hiding the reality that the common kinds of organic pesticides include things like soap.

We use brewery waste, horse manure, and leaves to make compost. Yes, we drive a truck to get them, but they are being driven away in any case. Some of the fossil footprint of small farms is likely just them replacing another industry, so its not necessarily additional carbon.\n\nMost of our crops dont get any pesticide at all. We grow a wide array of things, and have kept forest and wetlands all around the farm, so most pest populations dont usually build up too bad. \n\nAll that being said, theres no reason a conventional farm couldnt do these things, too. However, organic gets another level of inspection and they are specifically looking for these practices.\n\nI think organic farms just have more eyes on them", "\u201cOrganic gardening \u201c done at a corporate level is mostly just paid lip services for someone who want to feel like they are making a difference .

The study lasted three years, and the results were quite favorable for organic.\n\nThe team was made up of researchers and thirty experienced beekeepers. They tracked 300 honey bee populations on eight certified organic farms in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The scientists would listen to the beekeepers and the results. This would ensure that the study captured beekeepers' day-to-day challenges outside of a controlled environment. The beekeepers and the scientists were providing each other feedback.\n\nColonies were placed in one of the following categories: conventional management, organic management, and chemical-free management. The main difference between the groups is that hobbyists prefer chemical-free, while organic beekeepers generally intervene as little as possible. Most large-scale honeybee operations often intervene with chemicals and supplements to keep colonies alive.\n\nThe results for organic and conventional systems were almost identical. Both increased winter survival by 180%. There were no major survival issues between the two. Honey production was up 118% for organic and 102% for conventional. Parasites and pathogen levels were not materially different.\n\nThe results for organic production are promising. The scientists noted that the colonies' products could not be marketed as certified organic because this requires a 3-kilometer pesticide-free zone around the colonies. This is challenging to create in actual world production.

It's the financing part with the loans and the insurance that can be a little more complicated.\n\nAnd if you're accounting for your costs properly (which many farmers don't), you will rapidly come to realize the profit margins are *razor* thin and the only way to make a decent living is volume. You farm as many acres or raise as many animals as you can handle, and hope you make enough to pay off the equipment necessary. For the row crop farmers this is often 500+ acres, or even more.  \n\nMostly, the farmers that make good money doing it are able to do so because they can ignore some key cost.  My wife's grandfather makes good money from his cows because he bought 120 acres for cash in 1991 when he retired. If he had to make payments on his land, he probably wouldn't make much at all. \n\nTo make a good living off a small farm, you have to find a way to sell a niche product.   For many farmers,  that niche product is premium produce, which is mostly organic or natural produce and find customers that are willing to pay a premium. \n\ntheir costs are higher, but so are the profit margins. But the tough part is finding customers for what they're growing, and that's where the innovative businessmen, the Joe Salatins of the world come in."]}

Also; 1) the application timing for herbcides is typically early in the season prior to canopy set, 2) very few herbicides absorb into the crop (most persist in the soil until metabolized by microbes or they degrade naturally), therefore the idea that there are herbicide residues in your food is ridiculous.

The value of natural and holistic medicine is in its application of genuine solutions paired with healthy lifestyle complimented by intentional medical ritual orienting ourselves towards health.

In fact, Food, Inc. played a huge role in my decision to become a vegetarian. \nThis is my advice: Go to a farmers' market in your area. Try to go to a couple, and see which farmers are offering something called a CSA share. The idea of a CSA is that you pay up front in the beginning of the season a fixed price, and then you get a box of veggies each week. Normally it's enough to feed a family of 4, and you can even get a half share from some farmers. Get to know the farmers there, and maybe even ask if you can go out to their farm and see what they do. I live in North Central Florida, and I have become really good friends with some of the farmers in my area. It's a wonderful feeling. If you go out and help them for a day, they'll usually send you home with some free veggies, AND we you stop by at the market they'll give you their best products. Additionally, they love to share what they know about the other vendors at the market, so you can be informed about which ones are legit.\nAlso, for your meat habit, farmers' markets normally have a good selection of delicious and ethically grown meat (and dairy!). My town is small, and we have 4 different meat vendors, so I'm sure you can find a bunch in SF. ", "I've found that in Australia many of the organic farmers do delivery, so if you go to any farmers' markets where you are, see if they do likewise.\n\nOrganic meat is more expensive than regular meat.  However, some products are cheaper than others.  Organic sausages for example can be very affordable.\n\nWith steaks, what I tend to do now is cut them in half.  It's still enough meat for a healthy and satisfying meal, and it makes you eat more vegetables.  I posted some tips about this in another thread, but you can also make meat go further by having it in Asian-style stir fries (which typically use less meat for the same flavour impact).  And get cheaper cuts and slow-cook/crockpot them.  You may also find that your organic meat needs to be cooked differently than intensively farmed meat equivalent cuts.\n\nYou'll also want to make the very most out of your organic meat.  With chickens, make soup from the remains on the carcass, then make broth or stock from the bones.\n\nAnd good luck!  You will really not regret this move.", "Find farmer's markets.

{"title": "Hello, Are there any profitable, sustainable organic farmers on this board? I'd love to ask you some questions!", "selftext": "I've been bitten by the organic bug and have decided this is what I would like to devote my life to.  I have a fair amount of education and business experience but none of this revolves around agriculture.  I would like to spend this year building a business plan for a camp in Arizona that would begin as a small sustainable organic farm and expand into a destination location that would provide camping, hunting, education, career paths and a few other things as well.\n\nI feel entirely capable of finding both the land and investors for such an undertaking but have a LOT of catching up to do in regards to the actual mechanics of the operation.  To give you a little background I have two main objectives here which I will outline below.  If this seems interesting to you and you would be willing to devote some time to provide me with a little education I would be very grateful.\n\n**To use a small but profitable sustainable organic farm as a stepping stone to expand a business.** The major benefit here other than the obvious is to document the process and use it as a media piece to show others that it is both rewarding and possible.  In my experience as a consumer of organic products I feel that the industrialization even of organic produce is not the solution we need.  Yes it will certainly play its part and it is important as a nation and world that we move away from dangerous chemical and genetically modified production, but most importantly SUSTAINABLE and LOCAL practices must be part of the mental shift.  I would like to help illustrate this by providing a \"If I Can Do It, So Can You\" example for others.  \n\n**To provide education to those who otherwise may not be seeking it out.**  By using the organic farm as a \"base of operations\" for other business ventures I hope to draw in a crowd of people that usually would scoff at the organic movement.  In Arizona this is generally the \"right wing\" costco shopper that spends as little as they can on food and as much as they can on their new truck.  No judgement here, that was me a year ago.  If people could come to this location, rent a cabin and be provided with delicious sustainable organic meals, breathe the fresh air and witness firsthand the physical and psychological benefits, I might actually have a chance at \"winning their hearts and minds\".\n\nThis idea is still in its infancy and is certainly subject to change and influence, thats where you come in.  I will give you an idea of what in my uneducated opinion would be a good start and if you could offer suggestions or warnings that would be awesome.\n\nBuy 30-40 acres of land with a small farmhouse and decent water rights.\n\nPlant a 5 acre orchard (thinking apples?) with adjoining pasture.\n\nUse a few dairy cows or a fair amount of goats to clear the orchard and pasture.\n\nUse free range chickens to cut down on pest insects.\n\nUse a few pigs to consume the fruit not suited for sale.\n\nStart farming organic produce on an acre or two using fertilizer generated from the livestock.\n\nBuild a few small prefab cabins on the property and begin renting them out.\n\nEncourage survival/outdoors/hunting/backpacking experts to use my location as a venue for their classes by providing reasonable rates and the added benefit of free meals.\n\nFrom there I could head in a few directions but first I need to make the farm pay for itself, provide extra for guests and generate profit for expansion.  I need to first learn more about the financial nature of organic farming though.  I would be providing my own labor but this would not be enough and I would have to hire some help to get started and then maintain the farm.  I have a lot of friends who would be very excited and happy to come up on weekends and participate but I have to just count that as a bonus.  \n\nSo here are a few questions I have but im sure there are a million I dont even know to ask.  Feel free to participate as you see fit.\n\nNot counting land, how much did it cost you to begin operating your farm?  At what point did you get out of the red with your operation?  How many people do you feed from your produce?  What has been your greatest challenge so far?  If you could do it all over again what would you change? How many people work for you and what/how do you pay them?  Do you have any people that live on your land in exchange for labor?  What kind of livestock do you have and how much of their feed comes from your land?\n\nWell this post is already a short novel so i'll cut it off there.  Thanks in advance for any advice/help!\n\n**EDIT:**  I appreciate the upvotes but also feel free to throw in your two cents even if you are not an \"expert\".  I realize I might be getting my hopes up too much that someone with this kind of experience will see my post.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/u92yw/hello_are_there_any_profitable_sustainable/", "created_utc": 1338232128.0, "score": 15, "author": "whathassciencedone", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/u92yw/hello_are_there_any_profitable_sustainable/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["My family owns and operates [One Straw Farm](http://onestrawfarm.com) go ahead and check us out.

Pick one or two things to start and stick with it. \n\nFirst off. Small farm markets won't pay the bills. I learned early on it won't. I'm just outside Youngstown. When I first started after moving home 12 years ago. I was raising 3 acres of produce. It took me all of a month to figure out that selling in two markets in Youngstown and one in Salem wasn't going to cut it. I had an advantage, I had access to equipment that was vital, things like a plastic layer, Plows, rototiller. I did own an 75HP tractor. I ended up doing two markets in Pittsburgh and two in Cleveland every week. But it was shit load of running. I did that 3 years before I figured out I was working myself to death. On top of that I was leasing ground to raise cereal grains on. (wheat, oats, spelts,barley, buckwheat) and dry beans(navy, pinto, black turtle, adzuki)\n\nI ditched the produce and stick with grains,beans and hay. Thats what I have a market for. \n\nSecond, If at all possible, try leasing ground. It's a 100% tax write off every year and if you decide to walk away your not trying to sell a large chunk of real estate. I own 22 acres that my house is on. all but 4 acres of it are woods. I lease a 45 acre farm at $90 per acre per year. So for just $4050a year I have ground, a barn and two out buildings. All the equipment is stored there, hay gets stored there, All the grains are stored at home. \n\nYou mentioned selling preserves and canned goods. That can be a whole headache on its own. Never mind insurance for product liability, what kind of licensing, inspections and equipment is the state going to require? You are now dealing in processed foods. \n\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg. Have you priced equipment yet? Get ready for sticker shock. \n\n", "You have some great ideas.  I have an organic farm in BC but my family is from Arizona and I know from experience that you need to have two things to be successful...a market and water.  Find a way to sell your produce way before you get the land, and keep in mind the government regulations.  You might not be able to sell meat the way you think you can.  You also need to be able to transport your product to your customers so unless you have a refrigerated truck you don't want to be more than 45 minutes away from them and that means being near an urban centre.  Water is a serious issue everywhere, even here on an island.  We use 1000 gallons per day watering our 2/3 acres in production, so you need to be somewhere with a deep reliable well or city water.

I appreciate any and all responses :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/11n3wbe/new_to_organic_and_have_a_question_about_organic/", "created_utc": 1678396191.0, "score": 15, "author": "irregulartheory", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/11n3wbe/new_to_organic_and_have_a_question_about_organic/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Organic farmer here. Yes, organic farmers are absolutely allowed, and do, use pesticides. These are primarily insecticides and fungicides rather than herbicides (for economic/technical reasons). As a previous commenter mentioned, those pesticides (in the vast majority of cases) cannot contain synthetic (not found in nature) components, and are usually (but not always) OMRI listed. They are still generally developed in labs and produced in factories, often by the same companies that sell synthetic pesticides.\n\nConventional producers generally \"burn down\" (spray herbicide before planting) before planting and then (in corn and the majority of genetically modified crops) apply one or more \"over the top\" herbicides that the crop is resistant to (glyphosate, 24d, and/or dicamba). You will avoid all of this with any organic certified food.\n\nThe insecticides and herbicides are a little trickier. The synthetic ones are generally much more toxic than the organic ones, but there may be negative impacts to human health, as well as environmental impacts, from any pesticide. The majority of non-hydroponic, organic crops likely have had at least some pesticide applied to them if they are susceptible to insects or disease.\n\nOn our farm we try to minimize pesticide applications by utilizing other techniques, but some crops are not marketable without at least some application, some times of the year. For us in the midwest, that is generally BT (bacillus thuringis) applications to brassica crops (kale, broccoli, cabbage, etc) because otherwise they are packed full of caterpillars.\n\nMy bottom line is that organic crops are generally going to expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than conventional. The flip side is that certain conventional crops are absolutely guaranteed to have had toxic pesticides applied. I'd be happy to share my thoughts on specific crops if that is helpful. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) and consumer reports have also both released lists of crops that have the most conventional pesticide residues on them (the best crops to buy organic) , but they are mostly focused on fresh produce and are not a perfect guide.", "I'm currently studying federal regulations for organic crop, livestock, and processing operations. \n\nFor crops, organic farms need to show that they have tried preventative, mechanical, or physical methods to **BEFORE** they are allowed to apply substances that are **approved** on the National List. Practices like crop rotation, sanitation of fields, and introducing predatory bugs can go a long way to setting up a bad environment for \"bad\" bugs such that they wouldn't want to move in.\n\nHere's a link to the regulations that details this: [https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-M/part-205/subpart-C/section-205.206](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-M/part-205/subpart-C/section-205.206)\n\nThere is also something called the National List of approved and prohibited substances. This is a list of what is explicitly approved or prohibited to be used as pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, sanitation, repellants, etc. Farmers need to follow it and can have their farm tested for prohibited substances during their annual inspection.\n\nThe complication is that most commercial pesticides aren't single-ingredient, so every ingredient has to be checked and approved. Which is where we get organizations like OMRI, which some organic certification agencies trust for their materials review. \n\nAll that being said, the biggest point of organic is land and ecological conservation. The nutritional/health aspect is a by-product of that, even though that's mostly why the general public buys organic. It's definitely a logical conclusion (healthier land > healthier to humans crops) but my understanding is that there isn't enough scientific evidence to support this claim yet, as organic regulation is relatively young. \n\nIf I were you, I'd visit some local farms if you're able to. Ask questions. I think eating locally and seasonally is just as much of a factor as organic.", "One of the big problems of certified organic farming is that it\u2019s very difficult for small farms to obtain that. However their methods are on par with organic farming in many ways.They may use some pesticides but they are applied sparingly. I have tried to grow produce on a large (ish) scale and I can tell you it is quite difficult to grow food without pesticides and fertilizer additions. Everything wants to eat what we eat.", "[removed]"]}

Low prices in this case also aren't a particular red flag; one would expect that a large national retailer like Walmart could establish large-volume supply chains with contract-growers.

{"title": "I want to tell you guys about a conventional farming practice called 'dessication'", "selftext": "So as a organic farmer living in a 'conventional' farming community (in western canada) I see the 'farming practices' these guys use on a regular basis. Now you all are likely aware that conventionally grown crops are sprayed several time throughout the growing season to combat things like weeds, insects, fungus, etc. but no one really speaks about a process called 'desiccation'. Basically what this process is, when the crop is almost ready to harvest they go out and spray a chemical on it to ensure the entire field is ready to harvest all at once in a 'efficient and uniform' way.... this is done on pretty much all cereal crops (except malting barley), several oil seed crops (eg, flax), legume crops (lentils, beans, peas). This is a fairly new practice (less then 10 years old), it eliminates the need to 'swath' the crop (the way it was done for 100s of years, and still done by organic farmers) to ultimately save time/money. I believe it puts a significant health risk into our food. The chemical is sprayed DAYS before the crop is harvested, it is also a concern that the crop absorbs some of the chemical that is applied during the desiccation process. These are not nice chemicals, one of the common ones that is used for desiccation is roundup (im sure your familiar with this chemical) another common one is 'Reglone' if you look at the MSDS sheet for reglone it states \"Symptoms of Acute Exposure\nMay cause eye irritation. Harmful if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the skin.\" Please feel free to google 'reglone msds' to see the harmful effects the chemical has on the human body...\n\nNow there are people that will say the chemicals are applied at such a low rate they're not a health concern. However there is no one monitoring how much a farmer is putting on his field, other then the farmer (or corporation) himself. And truth be told, there is very little testing done to ensure these 'maximum residue limits' are enforced. \n\nThe reason I am telling you this is to get the word out there... i've been 'preaching' about this for several years to 'city folk' and no one had any clue something like this was going on.

That\u2019s the equivalent of about two extra portions of fruit and vegetables a day, with no increase in caloric intake.\u201d\n\nAntioxidants are thought to help prevent a variety of diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke and certain cancers.\n\nConventional crops had twice the amount of cadmium and were three to four times more likely to have pesticide residues than the organic versions, the Newcastle study found.\n\nCadmium is a highly toxic heavy metal contaminant that has been linked to kidney failure, bone softening liver failure and lung cancer.\n\nEWG releases its Shopper\u2019s Guide to Pesticide in Produce\u2122 each year to highlight the fruits and vegetables with the highest amounts of pesticide residues.\n\nMillions of consumers rely on the guide to make smarter shopping decisions for themselves and their families.\n\nPesticide exposure has been linked to cancer and neurological damage and impaired intelligence in children.\n\n\u201cThe pesticide and chemical companies always try to discredit any science that challenges the notion that organic food is better,\u201d added Cook.  \u201cThanks to the team at Newcastle University and Washington University Professor Chuck Benbrook, we now have further proof of what we already knew and suspected, that there are clear differences between organic and conventional food, and organic comes out on top when it comes to our health and the planet.\u201d\n\nHere's the PDF of the entire study-read it-save it:\n\nhttp://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF/documents/14-06-12%20Final%20Crops%20Paper%20BJN5552.pdf\n\nThe EWG Article: http://www.ewg.org/release/more-scientific-evidence-organic-food-more-nutritious", "[deleted]"]}

I'm surprised really at the claim in the title -- that small farms are often the most productive in terms of output per unit of land and energy -- but I don't doubt that.\n\nThe bigger question I have is whether small farms, regardless of whether they have higher output on those terms, are otherwise capable of feeding the world. In the US at any rate, we would need millions more small farmers to match the current production.  And that doesn't address at all the issue of whether these small farms would generate enough revenue to support them.  \n\nLastly, you will find that very small farms are usually centered around vegetables and livestock.  Specialty crops especially are generally priced higher than commodities.  But when you get to wheat especially (a very vital crop), but also soy, corn, etc, it turns out that a small wheat farm is not a viable business model.  It may indeed be more productive in terms of output per unit of land and energy (although I doubt that), but that doesn't make it a financially viable option. ", "I've always believed small farms could feed the world. It's never going to happen though. There is simply not enough interest from people to farm. \n\nMy brother, nephew and I farm right at 300 acres. we can pay the bills, but there's not much left over for fun. As a result I work full time and take care of certain things. Brother is retired so he is there all the time, Nephew works part time for the state (winter work). \n\nThis way all farm money goes right back into the farm. We also do custom work. Mostly round baling and a little custom combine work. We could easily do more, problem is there's no ground available in our area. When a piece of ground does come available it starts a bidding war.

However, it did become clear that some sources produced better outcomes for me than others. \n\nThe first time I really realised that was when I had to use a different supplier for chicken breasts and suddenly I went from needing to eat an entire breast to be full to feeling full after only eating 2/3 of a parable sized breast. That chicken breast was a bit more expensive but when you offset the reduced volume consumed and the reduced calorie count of the meal (which aided my weight management), it was absolutely worth it for me. \n\nSo I would say that the organic certifications are the starting point and then I monitor my physical reactions to determine which sources are best for me. \n\n2.\nI can\u2019t say that I have had any input from influencers. After identifying the benefits to my health I have read some books about food production to try and understand what it was that had such a negative affect on me when eating non-organic foods but I can\u2019t say that the research changed my actions further with respect to food choices. \n\n3.\nI am sure that some organic labelling is misleading. Nowadays I tend to assume that if it is relatively cheap but claims to be organic then it is potentially dodgy and I won\u2019t trust it. \n\nI also know personally some farmers who, for all intents and purposes, manage their crops/animals organically but don\u2019t have certification as it is so much work to get it. So I also feel comfortable eating those products based on my relationships with, and understanding of the ethos of, the farmers. \n\nMy point is that certification is valuable in that it provides a certain amount of generic information but it isn\u2019t everything; it can\u2019t tell you if the individual product is the best quality for your specific needs and it doesn\u2019t necessarily prove that the quality is vastly different from smaller farms who may not be able to afford the certification process.", "When I found out that conventionally grown food is loaded with unnatural chemical pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides,  fungicides,  and sewage sludge; I went totally organically grown!

It may cost more to buy organic, but I save money because I never have to pay the doctors.  Organic food tastes way better than conventional too! The only thing that I don't like about organic food is that you can't find it at restaurants,  not where I live.  So, I never go out to eat, I also can't do much social eating. If I eat conventional food, I feel like crap the next day, sometimes longer. Life is too short to feel bad for even a day.", "I trust USDA organic certification and look for that seal on products I buy or certification at the farmers market. \n\nWith the cost of groceries going (been) up, I am more selective in the products I choose to buy organic.

I usually choose conventional produce for fruits where the peel\nIs not consumed and things like asparagus, which don\u2019t really use a lot of pesticides. \n\nI know what to look for when shopping organic, so I rarely feel misled. However I do notice when organic products are placed closely next to the same type of conventional product. I notice if the signage is confusing or could be misleading to accidentally grab a conventional one instead of the organic. This happens often at Costco, for example their organic blueberries will be in crates right next to the conventional ones and it\u2019s easy to grab the wrong one. Costco is usually pretty good and will have organic signage in a different color, but sometimes they don\u2019t and that makes it harder to differentiate as well.", "The framing of your questions is suspicious", "My first questions might be - 1) what would lead you to be believe that Certified Organic food is being misrepresented? and 2) what would lead you to not trust Organic certification or Organic certification bodies?", "Usda is greenwashed.

These farmers have to be certified usda organic before getting a (free) Real Organic certification.   \n\nGet to know your local farmer. Ask your local farmers how they farm. If they take care of their land and plants using no harmful chemicals and are passionate about how they take care of their plants, that is all that matters.  \n\nAlso, lastly, fuck Whole Foods. They screw over organic farmers all the time with incorrect orders. Farmers think they sold their large volume of produce, they take the time to pack it up on pallets to deliver to WF, then WF cancels the entire order last minute.

Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macroencapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).

So for example, we only buy organic wheat, because regular non-GMO wheat can be \"finished\" with glyphosate, while glyphosate can't be used on organics (as long as the overall organic system is working as expected).", "There are certified organic seed companies that sell seeds/produce that have GMO origins.

Simultaneously, occupational intellectual apathy and negligence are also regionally homogenous issues in the actualization and outcomes of policy and performance standards. So, who verified the farm, and who approved the farm, and who regulated any issues \u2014 and are they more type-A and perfectionist-to-a-fault than anyone else \u2014 or do they generalize and slack based on a small sample from only a small corner of only the first crop? And would these questions be answered truthfully and honestly universally anyway? So where's the publicly accessible proof, and is it good enough?\n\n\nMore relevant question still is \u2014 how much worse is the human physiology who consume industry certified organic vs homegrown ideological methods? In other words, the relevant question is \u2014 is certified organic as harmless as it is made out to be when it's only compared to the worst case scenario (conventionals) instead of utmost ideal methods of truly organic \u2014 because my perfectly clean grocery store organic fruit and produce is in containers or with tags that still advise washing it, whatever \"wash\" even means realistically at that end point that it's perfectly clean already, or else clearly covered in unidentifiable stubborn residue stains. City dwellers have no clue but to just go through an act of an insignificant rinse, so what does that matter when\u00a0 organic chemicals are soaked and UV-sun-baked into the fruit and produce, not to mention root-uptaken into the veins of the plants anyway, right?\n\n\nSo certified organic is required to be reliably proven as 95\u2105 of whatever that certification is. So maybe it's 5\u2105 nuclear fallout and ten year old GMO residue or secret proprietary \"natural\" untested genocidal ingredients that are \"undetectable\" because the impact is \"mostly\" washed out after the physiological sand storm impact it leaves behind in any affect it has yet to be tested (in an officially accepted format) as at all residually harmful.\n\n\nIn the end, it's not any question about the standard, but instead about Americanized occupational intellect and anal-retentiveness. Free enterprise corruption meddles too much in what would and/may otherwise be uncompromised regulatory performance.\n\n\nI would imagine the tests are only as thorough as the intelligence of the person in place to conduct the test. Then same with the administrative bureaucracy processes and those regional or department personnel.\n\n\nThen there's the global dilemma of obvious catastrophic issues completely disregarding adequate implementation of accountability, both in the field, the workplace, and across departments. Once something is on paper or databased, minds turn off to objective doubt of validity of the data. Not always, and even often not, but it is sill a pervasive dilemma.\n\n\nIt's tough to think about, much less to fully address. But it always needs to be fully righteously spearheaded at every examination point to the fullest most corruption-proof and negligence-proof methods possibly imaginable. Is organic certification negligence-proof? More importantly, is organic farming leagues better than mere organic standards?

There are also innocent producers and vendors further down the chain who buy ingredients in good faith, and then resell them in products that they genuinely believe are organic.", "For fresh food (fruits and vegetables that don't have ingredient lists beyond the 1 food), yes. For packaged foods, potentially. The best indicator in the US is if it has the [Non GMO Verified certification](https://www.nongmoproject.org/), which is often, but not always, also on organic packaged foods. The organic certification allows for up to a 5% non-organic substances in the food, so it's possible you get 5% GMO. Checking the ingredient list for whether it contains corn syrup or any other GMO foods like soy and sugar beets is another way to be sure it's GMO-free."]}

{"title": "\"Organic\" and other terminology on meat labels", "selftext": "I was vegan for 13 years so I know NOTHING about meat. However, due to health reasons, I had to switch back to an omnivorous diet a couple months ago. For both health and ethical reasons, I am trying to buy my meat from local farms only. I live in a very large US city and have a few farms relatively close by that I get deliveries from. However, I've noticed the labels on many different meats from many different farms are always variations of the same thing, worded slightly differently. I.e.:\n\n\"No antibiotics, no hormones, vegetarian fed\"\n\n\"No antibiotics ever\"\n\n\"No added solutions or injections\"\n\n\"Never administered antibiotics\"\n\n\"Non GMO project verified\"\n\n\"Never treated with rBST*\" \n\nI know a lot of these phrases are mainly differentiated between poultry/other meats. But why would something that's not treated with any sort of hormones, antibiotics, or injections, and is 100% grass fed, not be non-GMO or organic labeled?

The folks working the market stand should be able to answer your questions about how the animals have been raised. Sometimes the people working the stalls are just hired to work the market, but often it\u2019s people who work at the farm too. They should be happy to answer your questions, and you may find a farm that is raising animals humanely but not necessarily certified organic - very common for small farms who do direct marketing. \n\nAnother way to ease into an omnivorous diet would be to make some bone broth - many livestock farmers (not all) sell soup bones, and there\u2019s lots of recipes online for bone broth. Easier on the stomach but still full of minerals/collagen/ect and you can use lots of herbs and spices and veggie scraps to round out the flavor.", "\u201cOrganic\u201d also means organic fertilizer (manure, usually) for the plants fed to the animals, so it\u2019s a hard label to earn *especially* on meat.", "Well, you jumped right into the deep end, didn\u2019t you? lol\n\nIt can be overwhelming. \n\nWe\u2019re lucky enough to have a little bit of land and though no cattle yet, have people close to us who do. \n\nFor cattle/sheep you want 100% grass-fed and grass finished. A lot of cattle can be marketed as grass fed and still be fed corn or just grain the last 2-4 weeks to \u201cfatten them up\u201d (adding more fat/marbling). The issue here is that even in the wild during fall/early winter when they would eat grain heads they would still mostly be eating grass. They\u2019re designed to eat grass and having 100% grain the last few weeks isn\u2019t going to give you the best meat quality wise. \n\nFor poultry you want pasture raised. This means they get to grass, bugs, grubs and other things that make them happy. Most poultry are omnivores and vegetarian only isn\u2019t necessarily the best for them. \n\nBy allowing the animals to do what they naturally want to do and given space and clean air, you\u2019ll find that a lot of times they aren\u2019t as sick as feedlot/battery animals. Humans are the same way. Disease spreads faster when locked in close quarters with one another and/or having a bad diet. \n\nYou\u2019ll also want to do a bit of research on cooking these types of meat. For example, a pasture raised bird is going to taste different and can have different cooking requirements than a conventional raised battery hen. Some might do better with lower and slower temps, other animals you might be able to turn the heat up a bit more but take them off sooner. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment. \n\nIf you still feel overwhelmed you can either enter your list into ChatGPT and tell it to explain what each thing means and how it\u2019s different from the other items or you could choose phrase a week and take some time and study it. So week one learn about rBST, week two learn about grass-fed vs. grass fed and grass finished. Week three learn about non-project GMO verified (meaning no GMO\u2019s but not necessarily organic). The big thing right now is called \u201cRegenerative agriculture.\u201d Means using live stock and/or growing methods in a way that regenerates the land and planet while you\u2019re still farming. \n\nHonestly though? Find a local farmer and ask them if you can ask some questions. Most are going to walk you thru it and tell you what they provide and what they don\u2019t. If they can\u2019t give you what you\u2019re looking for they can probably point you to someone in the area who can. Tell them you were vegan and you\u2019re looking to make informed choices as you start adding meat to your diet. Watch videos with farmers like Joel Salatin who are passionate about letting pigs be pigs and chickens be chickens and can help you learn (via video) what to look for as you start this journey. \n\nWhen it gets overwhelming just remember: at least you\u2019re asking the questions. A lot of people never even ask or think about where their food comes from. If you\u2019re asking the questions you\u2019ll eventually find the answers and then you can make the best choice for you and your health. \n\nGood luck!", "Well ... \"organic\" is generally cleaner and healthier than meat that's not organic.

And my understanding is that animals that are Not fed antibiotics are generally healthier to eat.\n\nIt seems that \"No added solutions or injections\" is mostly for poultry as for example there's a saline solution injected into some turkeys for both better flavor - and maybe to increase the weight of a bird that's sold by the pound.\n\nAnd imo non-gmo is mostly meaningless - as a big reason to avoid gmos is to avoid glyphosate residues, but glyphosate is often used to desiccate non-gmo crops before harvest."]}

Or is organic produce in Europe mostly a scam (not really organic)? Thanks!\n\n  \nEdit: My theory is that they try to compensate the losses due to no pesticides by making the plants grow faster with extra fertilizers or other methods, resulting tasteless water boxes made of plant cells", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/1cciapy/why_is_organic_produce_worse_in_australia/", "created_utc": 1714016888.0, "score": 4, "author": "peddidas", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/1cciapy/why_is_organic_produce_worse_in_australia/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Well there is a huge variety of growing areas in Europe, be interested to know specifically what country you are but Im a chef and did a tour in a place in France called rungis international market (this place is HUGE toured for a whole day and my god was an eye opening experience) and its the market place of Europe basically shops buy from here, but pretty much every farm, place that makes diary and meat and fish go to here then goes back out to everywhere in Europe. and as a place we are spoiled cause we get some good stuff.  Obviously all countries in europe would sell there own produce first but when its not massively expensive to import better quality produce, competition is high so farmer and growers have to try more \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungis\\_International\\_Market\n\nNow I don't know anything about Australian food and its economical process, but at a guess, I don't see a lot of different types of growing areas that's needed for specific fruit and veg that need different climates to make better tastier food. Plus there is no competition from different countries to produce better quality products (im sure there is imports but not lots of the same produce from multiple countries) because people are going to buy cheap as possible and if that's all there is well that's all going to be bought if there is nothing else, and im sure that companies abuse this why make a better quality product that costs more when people have to buy it anyway  and im sure that companies put some strain on the government to keep the market controlled in their favour", "Possible reasons:\n\n1. Regulatory differences between Australia and the other countries. \"Organic\" means different things in different jurisdictions.\n\n2. Differences in focus between organic and non-organic farmers and simple immaturity of the organic industry in Australia: \nFor comparison, I find vegan, vegetarian, and macrobiotic food in Japan to be mostly bland and boring. I know some amazing macrobiotic chefs too, but on average, most of the chefs are in my opinion not talented. The reason for this is that the people who become chefs in those categories in the first place are not as interested in good flavor as other people from the get go. If they were, they'd care more about taste and prioritize it over other factors, and might not even become vegan/vegetarian/macrobiotic in the first place. It's rare to find someone who cares about taste but also decides not to use all the ingredients available to them.\nMy assumption is that this might carry over to farmers as well. They care about producing food that's primarily healthy before all other factors, rather than primarily tasty before all other factors.\nNow if the organic grower industry is mature, i.e. there are a lot of experienced, talented growers, then growers will emerge who can achieve both: good taste and healthiness. But if the industry is immature, taste will often suffer compared to health.\n\n3. It might be something inherently Australian. I recall that when I bought organic bread in Australia some years ago, it was so bland that it was almost inedible. They had basically removed any ingredient that might contribute to good taste, like salt or some kind of sweatener, to go for a product that was as healthy as they could possibly make it. Taste was clearly not a consideration. It was like eating sawdust. Admittedly, this was in the 90s.\nBut the point is that it might even be a cultural thing where the product has to be inferior in some way in order to appear \"more basic\" or \"more natural\" to Australian consumers. Organic consumers there may believe that large tasty products that look attractive \"must be\" the result of bad chemical-based farming and therefore to be avoided.", "The EU has stricter standards against GMOs and pesticides. I know compared with the US at least that there are 1200 chemicals (pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, and bacteriacides included) that are banned in the EU but legal in the US. The only GMO legal in the EU is GMO livestock feed and a very small percentage of farms in the EU even use this (maybe 10% or less .. I\u2019ll have to look it up) whereas in America <1% of all farmland is organic \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2e\n\nI\u2019m from America and the main reason I want to move to the EU is because I have no digestive issues at all there, even if I eat a bunch of pizza or whatever unhealthy food. I still buy bio foods there when I grocery shop but when I eat out I can eat foods that would mess me up in America but that cause no problems in the EU, and when I lived in Germany for a few years, I had no issues ever it was like heaven! I\u2019ve looked up a lot of research about differences in food standards in the EU vs US but it\u2019s been a few years and I\u2019m too tired to look up stats and stuff rn \n\nI don\u2019t have specific statistics about Australia but since the UK uses more chemicals in their foods than countries in the EU, I would assume since Australia is a commonwealth state that their standards are more similar to the UK, which is better than the US, but worse than the EU.", "Sounds like the organic Aussie produce is the scam here. \n\nOrganic farming produces superior and better tasting produce in virtually most circumstances, speaking from comparing samples around the world. \n\nAlternatively the certified organic farmers in Australia might just not be very good at farming yet or the produce deteriorated in packing and shipping process."]}

Also, I\u2019m starting to find out that the USDA seal on food does not always guarantee food that was not sprayed with pesticides. Would it be cheaper to shop from local farms through CSA\u2019s or continue shopping from grocery stores? Is there a quality farmers market in the DMV for organic food? Any help would be appreciated.

It doesn\u2019t help if someone here has a great almost-all-local store in their town, you gotta figure out what\u2019s best at your location.\n\nI figure there is a handful of contenders, based on driving distance, right? Take a notepad and go in and see what you can find in the way of tags/signage and if you can find the produce manager or assistant (or maybe other staff) and just ask. I bet they\u2019d be happy to discuss their ordering.

And I bet you\u2019ll learn some interesting stuff.\n\nAlso maybe it would be interesting to try this at the distribution level. Get familiar with the produce distributors in your area. Get an idea of how they do their sourcing and who their customers are. It\u2019s the distributors that would really have all of the info that you need/want. They might not want to share everything, because setting up a supply chain is difficult and may be proprietary info, but places usually want to advertise the \u2018local\u2019 element of their business.\n\nI would look at organic as just a parallel factor. Some local food will be organic, some not. Organic is easier to identify. Or really you should pretty much always be able to tell if it is organic.\n\nEdit: also look into a CSA. Those are definitely going to be local and probably organic. You could have a big chunk of your produce needs met with a weekly CSA pickup.", "This is going to depend heavily on where you are located and seasonality. The best place if you want to make sure it\u2019s local is a farmer\u2019s market or CSA, or perhaps a local independent grocer. But all the major chain stores including WF are going to get the bulk of their organic produce from large scale organic farms. While they will all carry produce from smaller farms at times, and many of the big names contract with small growers, the simple fact is they all have demand that far exceeds what small independent farmers can produce, and they are also governed by economics, they have a legal responsibility to shareholders to maximize profit, and they have to be competitive against one another, and economies of scale mean the larger farms can produce more at a lower cost. \n\nWhat is it about local farms that attracts you versus the bigger growers? It may be that you can reach some of those goals by being selective about which kinds of produce and which growers you buy from."]}

They will lie and blame you for their mistakes and fight to keep your money. Go to Cottonique. Cottonique is much higher quality, great selection, great clothes, trustworthy and reliable customer service. You also earn points at Cottonique, they have fair prices, and ocassionally some very good sales. Best underwear and socks (their ankle docks are a little annoying though, just to get on cause they don\u2019t stretch but fit well once on) and loungewear and tshirts and I'm starting to explore their new styles as well.\u00a0\n\nFor towels I got from Coyuchi\u2014expensive but the thinnest ones are cheapest and they are EXCELLENT! Even got extra wash cloths for cheaper organic dish towels. I bought all my towels and robe from them in 2022, been using regularly, and they are in PERFECT condition!\u00a0\n\nFor sheets I get from Blaynk or Blanke or Blank (forget how they spell their company name, I am new to them), totally natural chemical free organic cotton sheets, freaking best sheets I ever had in my life! So soft, soooo breathable! And no icky new sheets smell because no chemicals\u00a0\n\nFor linen napkins and couch cover I got from magic linen, chemical free and so soft and high quality and beautiful\u00a0\n\nFor slippers, fuzzy logic! Their undyed organic cotton slippers are so comfortable it\u2019s insane, but no grip at the bottom which I like cause they\u2019re totally natural and washable, but get used to walking in them before walking on stairs.\u00a0\n\nNatural fabrics are very important to me after learning about things and at first it can seem daunting when searching for good companies so I wanted to share. I know sometimes prices are outside of reach but first time buyers codes help and sales, too! And with the towels, it was an investment I made 4 years ago and so glad I did. When natural products are made well, I find they are far superior and last longer. Hope this info helps.\u00a0"]}

The land has been in her family for 95 years and has operated as a vegetable and flower farm with a roadside stand the entire time. We\u2019d like to continue the tradition, but we need some guidance, as we also found out that it barely breaks even. \n\n\nWe run the flower operation on 1/4 of an acre, while relatives grow produce on six acres. The operations are separate in terms of space and accounting, which is how we were blindsided by the lack of profits on the produce side. Our flowers are profitable.\n\n\nThe farm has never grown fruit, had animals, or even compost. For having only six farmable acres, the farm has been run conventionally without a thought given to long-term sustainability. For example, the soil is literally sand, tilled to the fine texture of a beach. Flowers and weeds grow well, but produce gets blossom end rot or does not reach full potential. \n\n\nAdditional info, features, and concerns:\n\n\n\n* We are in Wisconsin, zone 5b\n* We are both 41 and have three kids under 8\n* The property is a long rectangle, 300 feet east to west, 1300 feet north to south\n* Suburban-type houses are on all sides, comprising 22 adjacent neighbors\n* No irrigation \n* On a well, no city water or sewage \n* No fences, so deer and rabbits are constant problems\n* Thrips, aphids, Japanese beetles, horn worms, and cabbage moth worms are constant problems \n* There\u2019s a uninhabited single-story frame house with two beds/one bath built in 1890 that has a mold problem that can be smelled from outside \n* There\u2019s a two car garage built in the 1950s that raccoons made their home in for many years\n* There\u2019s a pole barn built in 1960s that has a dirt floor, a caved in roof, and a sliding door that won\u2019t shut\n* There are five 48-foot long hoop houses (currently used to store tools and tractors)\n* 2 acres of forest\n* A section of a several mile long ravine runs west to east on the back side of property through the forested area\n* There\u2019s a 1986 John Deere 900HC tractor\n\n\nThis seems to be golden opportunity to create a proper farmstead\u2014as in living there, putting things right, and making money; however, we don\u2019t have much to spend and it can\u2019t take decades. \n\n\nSo, I am looking for detailed guides that specify low-cost, straightforward steps that will allow us to turn this worn-out land into something green, profitable, and beautiful.

Organic foods are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. These chemicals can be harmful to human health, and they can also pollute the environment.\r  \n\r  \nAnother factor to consider is the cost of organic foods. Organic foods can be more expensive than conventionally grown foods. However, the price difference is narrowing, and there are now many affordable organic options available.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, you may also want to consider your personal values when deciding which organic foods to buy. If you are concerned about the environment or animal welfare, then you may want to choose organic foods that are grown and produced in a sustainable and humane way.\r  \n\r  \nHere are a few of the organic foods that I believe are \"worth it\":\r  \n\r  \nFruits and vegetables: Fruits and vegetables are the most commonly sprayed crops with pesticides. Eating organic fruits and vegetables can help to reduce your exposure to these harmful chemicals.\r  \nMeat and dairy: Conventional meat and dairy products may contain antibiotics, hormones, and other chemicals. Organic meat and dairy products are raised without these chemicals, and they may be healthier for you.\r  \nEggs: Conventional eggs may come from chickens that are raised in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Organic eggs come from chickens that are raised in more humane conditions.\r  \nBeans and lentils: Beans and lentils are a good source of protein and fiber. They are also a good source of iron and other nutrients. Organic beans and lentils are grown without the use of pesticides, which can help to reduce your exposure to these harmful chemicals.\r  \nIf you are looking for more information on organic foods, I would recommend checking out notoxapp.com. It's a great resource for learning about the different toxins in our environment and how to reduce your exposure to them.\r  \n\r  \nHere are some additional tips to help you make informed decisions about which organic foods to buy:\r  \n\r  \nLook for the USDA organic seal when you are shopping for organic foods. This seal ensures that the food has been grown and produced according to USDA organic standards.\r  \nRead the labels carefully. Some foods may be labeled as \"natural\" or \"all-natural.\" However, these labels do not mean that the food is organic.\r  \nAsk your grocer about their organic food selection. Many grocers now have a wide variety of organic foods available.\r  \nI hope this helps!", "The answer you're requesting is the \"Clean Fifteen\".\nOtherwise, the best answer other than all out would rank all the harmful chemicals that inundate the soil, water  air, production process, and food supply and subsequently list each and every food contaminated by each and every poison to offer a clear chart that places everything along a full spectrum of *certain death* to *deadly* to *influences disease* to *health complications* to *allergens* *indigestion*, and then on into nutritional content and medicinal, regenerative, and nootropic content.\nBTW, I would love to see such a complete chart and list set realize.\n\nA: All.\nIn my young adult years when I was dropped from my parents excellent healthcare plan, I realized my health is entirely my responsibility, so I have since researched nutrition and production processes to motivate an all-out pursuit of the best I can make happen.\n\nI would even suggest the tightest budget should still shop hard in consideration of micro- then macro-nutrition to make the most of the local market options, even if that means prioritizing Market Match programs which double up to $60 of produce purchases at farmers markets per month for those on welfare. I would rather live close to farmers markets that offer those perks just to get by than out in an isolated and weather-restricted area restricted to the options at a bait and tackle shop. But still, even mostly farmed areas *should* still promote strong nutritional community to share the organics being grown in trade for friendship, helpfulness, and whatever support, event if it's just a local farmers market just for the local farmers to trade produce.\nKeep in mind, proper fasting can be a very health-promotive strategy that also yields fat loss, and an acceptable BMI can range pretty low to a very trim end of the spectrum (though, I recommend hovering around mid-BMI). Fitness activities should also be utilized to build macronutrients into the body and to expel excess fat storage.

By developing the Non-GMO project, brands were able to have a certification process to have an actual data point where products are tested to ensure they truly are Non-GMO (although due to cross contamination, almost no product is 100% free from GMO\u2019s, much like how traces of glyphosate will still show on many end product organic oats). Also, both the manufacturing site, and the ingredients must be non-gmo certified, so an all organic product that is co-manufactured at a facility that is not Non-GMO certified cannot be Non-GMO verified even though the product is organic.\n\nNow many brands are only showing non-gmo because people see this as almost equal to Organic, but it is not the same.

Higher yields means more money, and more money means the ability to expand organic production.  It means the ability to better compete against conventional production, and encourage more commercial farms to go organic.  It means less land use for agriculture, and thereby more land that can be dedicated back to nature.  It means more efficient use of scarce resources such as water.  It means less energy use and greenhouse gas emissions because farming on fewer acres means more efficient use of tractors and other equipment, and often more efficient use of trucks to get products to market.  It can mean more efficient use of nutrients, and less overapplication of nitrogen and phosphorous which is a massive sustainability issue for organic today (something people *really* don't like to talk about).

{"title": "Organic food for health, TCM and wholistic view", "selftext": "I was replying to a TCM question regarding organic food choices and I thought that the reply might be of interest to others who are following or deciding to follow organic diet and make healthier food choice in life. Here is goes:\n\nNon-organic food (especially in worst cases of non-organic gardening) is grown either without soil or in soil fed with artificial fertilizers, slime, chemical compounds, factory wastes that haven't been broken down by the earth and its microflora. The result is the big blown and often imperishable and tasteless (apart from sweetness) vegetables that are partially made from indigestible, non-living matter. On top of that, the inorganic matter in them is often charged with toxins and unstable, polluted energy accumulated during growth, harvesting, storage, production and transportation.\n\nOur digestive system doesn't have the capacity to break down non-living matter, as the result, the spleen runs out of Qi trying to separate those little bits that are digestible, while the rest goes into waste and is deposited as dampness and phlegm in the body, because the body doesn't have enough energy to evacuate all that waste.\n\nAny active toxic substances, pesticides, chemicals, irradiation etc. accumulated in that non-organic food, cannot be just let alone and moved out from the body as is, as they are too volatile. They have to be enveloped into a thick Yin layer of Damp first. As the Spleen becomes Qi deficient and unable to cope with all that waste, and it would damage the body if the Spleen tries to separate those toxins from the matter, they just get deposited in the body until better times come, usually starting around the waist and hip area and spreading into other vital organs and then the rest of the body. We might be eating more but we keep depleting our life energy and create blockages in energetic pathways as well as in bodily liquid circulations.\n\nThe large intestine suffers the most perhaps, as all those inorganic deposits create a thick layer around its walls preventing healthy energy and blood circulation, building a perfect environment for unhealthy, non-human beneficial microflora to thrive within it. As its function weakens, all body organs suffer from being unable to fully cleanse and restore their functions. The wastes in the large intestine become reabsorbed by the body as its energy to contain and eliminate the waste efficiently is compromised.\n\nThe further it goes the worse it gets until we start carefully looking onto what we eat and how much, and listen to our body response to all that.\n\nWhen that unhealthy inorganic microflora in our guts and organs accumulates to a substantial degree, it has the power to influence our body and mind, thoughts and desires, creating cravings and needs that would continuously feed that microflora and that would reduce the healing, restorative powers of the body, mostly through direction of all the energy away from the body and into the brain through all sorts of external or internal stimuli, suppression of body emotions and expressions and through consuming unhealthy food and information.\n\nWe want to make sure that the Yin we nourish our body with and the Yang that gives it vital animating energy, both are balanced and come from the cleanest, natural sources, grown with love and care for the planet and humanity. When we eat, we need to lower our mind into the abdominal area, not superficially checking on it here and there, but steadily keeping it in the lower body. When we see colors and taste flavors of the food, we need to be able to connect, without thinking, comparing or judging, these flavors, aromas and colors with the feeling we get from the body. Eating like that we will know intuitively what and when our body needs, to stay healthy and vibrant.\n\nI hope it is helpful and is not completely out of the context!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/organic/comments/s9offs/organic_food_for_health_tcm_and_wholistic_view/", "created_utc": 1642808484.0, "score": 3, "author": "AlMaxim", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/organic/comments/s9offs/organic_food_for_health_tcm_and_wholistic_view/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you.

We focused on eating [Organic Food](https://www.dwarakaorganic.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-organic-food/) and staying fit to fight the deadly virus. It is time we understand the value of being fit and having a strong immune system. \n\nSo, let us indulge in a habit of eating pesticide-free and organic food and continue it for life. Read further and find out how it is made and is beneficial for us.\u00a0\n\n**What is Organic Food?**\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food)\u2018s definition for \u201c**Organic Food\u201d**\u00a0is\u00a0[food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food)\u00a0produced by methods complying with the standards of\u00a0[organic farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming). The term \u2018organic\u2019 refers to how produce is grown. General farming involves the use of [herbicides](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/herbicide.htm#:~:text=A%20herbicide%20is%20a%20pesticide,often%20based%20on%20plant%20hormones.), [pesticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide), chemical fertilizers, and [GMOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism). \n\nWhereas organic farming is a more natural way of growing produce. It doesn\u2019t involve the use of chemicals hence making the product more nutritious and less harmful.\u00a0\n\n**How is Organic Food grown and processed?**\n\nOrganic products are allowed to grow in natural arrangements. They are given enough time to grow and mature on their own. The crops aren\u2019t fed with harmful chemicals to speed their growth and increase their quality. \n\nThis is why organic products appear more natural and not as shiny as chemically produced products. This slow and natural process of farming ensures that organic products are filled with nutrients. \n\nFurthermore, even the soils the crops are grown in are organically fertilized. The whole process of organic farming is governed by strict government standards so that you get the best. \n\nAt [Dwaraka Organic](https://www.dwarakaorganic.com/), all [our products](https://www.dwarakaorganic.com/product/) are in compliance with standards of the USDA National Organic Program that regulates all the [organic agriculture in the USA](https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams).\n\n**Benefits of Organic Food**\n\n\u201cWe are what we eat\u201d this well heard saying is as true as it can get. How your food is grown or raised has a major impact on your physical and mental health too. \n\nHarmful chemicals like pesticides can take a huge toll on one\u2019s emotional, mental, and physical growth. Hence, we suggest choosing organic food as your first choice. \n\nBelow are a few benefits that organic food has.\n\n* **It is fresher**  \nSince the products are naturally grown and no chemicals are used to prolong the product\u2019s natural life span, organic foods move faster from the farm to the consumer. We at Dwaraka Organic,\u00a0 make sure all our organic products reach you in their freshest form.\u00a0\n* **Organic farming is healthy for the environment**  \n[Organic farming](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/environmental-benefits-of-organic-farming-2538317) helps in reducing pollution, increasing soil fertility, and even conserving water and energy. As it doesn\u2019t include the usage of synthetic pesticides, it keeps the nearby birds, insects, and other creatures safe. Hence maintaining a balance in the environment.\u00a0\n* [**Organic Food is GMO-free**](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2013/05/17/organic-101-can-gmos-be-used-organic-products#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20genetic%20engineering,t%20use%20any%20GMO%20ingredients.)  \nGenetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are plants that are genetically modified to make them more resistant to synthetic pesticides. Such plants can be harmful if consumed on a daily basis for many years. Organic farming keeps the plants away from such practices, hence giving you GMO-free produce. We follow strict guidelines set by the [USDA National Organic Program](https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic). Moreover, we are certified by [India Organic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Organic) for the authenticity of our brand.\u00a0Organic food has the potential to give you the cleanest nutrients your body requires. It helps you to stay away from harmful chemicals. Moreover, it keeps the environment clean.

I never got allergies never got hurt never had got sick or had colds not even stomachaches. Then I went to college I started eating out changed my diet completely by eating pizza fries and a lot of junk food. Basically the American diet which was eating a lot of processed and fried food. I used to have an Indian diet with an emphasis of lots of organic fresh fruits and veggies everyday with rice and naan thanks to my mom. I slowly started to see my health detoriating in college though. I developed allergies got a kidney infection twice and even got an allergic reaction so bad I had to be hospitalized overnight. The doctor at the ER said I should see an allergist. I did and the allergist said I was allergic to everything like grass to every kind of nut. I was shocked, I\u2019ve never been allergic to anything how can I be all of a sudden allergic to every nut there is and even grass when I\u2019m a soccer player ?!! It got so bad that I felt dizzy and felt like I couldn\u2019t get up for 10 days. Then I saw the doctor and she said I had acid reflux and that I shouldn\u2019t worry and it\u2019s completely normal. At this point I was like WHAT THE HELL why am I getting such bad health problems when I\u2019m only 21. I dugged deeper into why my health was getting so bad and I realized it was because of eating processed toxic foods that caused my acid reflux and allergies. Then covid hit and I got back home to eating my moms cooking. Now I barely have acid reflux symptoms and I\u2019m doing okay. But this ignited a passion that in me to end this horrid toxic food and to help people to preserve their health and not have to go through horrific bad health experiences like I have. This toxic food turned a completely healthy young adult like me to a person with a lifelong disease like acid reflux. So I started Green Club a website where we only sell non-toxic organic food!

{"title": "What Are The Facts You Should Know About Organic Weed Prevention?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nAn alternative to conventional gardening is organic weed prevention. But the question of why you should do organic things is still up in the air.\n\nA garden is a lovely thing to have. It also provides an area for rest and refreshment, aside from the fact that it adds splendor to your place. Similarly, a vegetable garden is also helpful. It can not only offer additional income; it can also enhance the health of your family.\n\nThere are many reasons why you'd like your yard to have a garden. It doesn't matter what kind, as long as the stuff you want from it is there. Yet again, although you have managed to have an attractive lawn, you may encounter some issues.\n\nWeeds are only one of the few problems you may encounter with gardening. They are undesirable grasses that can grow on your lawn anywhere. While some of them may look beautiful, it is not recommended to raise them with your plants, though.\n\nDifferent ways of killing weeds exist. You can purchase weed spray, fertilizer for grass killer, or follow organic weed prevention. Although there may be effective lawn weed killers, some of them are still discouraged.\n\nThe best and most advisable way to kill weed so far is by preventing organic weed. Rather than chemicals, it is merely the use of organic weed preventers. But why go for an option like this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here are some of the reasons why you should consider killing unwanted grass in your garden in an organic way:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1)** Be an active ecologist. Due to its relevance to anti-pollution and soil pollution, the main reason why organic living is promoted is. That is why your most significant contribution to the most important and most prominent campaign of our time is to use natural products.\n\n**2)** Your plants' healthy soil. If there is one thing in your garden that you have to take care of, that would be the soil. To grow beautiful and healthy plants, it is essential to have healthy soil.\n\n**3)** When too many chemicals are put into it, the soil's natural nutrients are depleted. Weed roundup when this occurs; unhealthy plants and crops and unattractive flowers are all you'll have.\n\n**4)** On the other hand, you can be sure that controlling unwanted grass will no longer be an issue when you have healthy soil. This is because some of their growth will be able to control the plants.\n\n**5)** Avoid risks to health. Conventional fertilizers are packed with hazardous chemicals for our health. People exposed to these chemicals may develop ailments attributed to the use of these chemical weed killers in the long run.\n\n**6)** Support from the government. Nowadays, because organic living is highly recommended and encouraged by governments and international organizations, you can only expect it to be beneficial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, to market your products, you don't have to spend too much money. Governments are allocating budgets to the marketing of organic products and products. That is why they purchase them whenever people see organic products.\n\nMoreover, governments are now providing areas where [organic products](https://www.saansmart.com/) are displayed in supermarkets and other market areas. They sometimes even encourage those businesses and farms that use organic products.

It has a way higher shelf life (doesn\u2019t even need to be kept in the fridge!!), tastes very similar (I actually think the taste of oat milk fits cereal better than the taste of cow milk since it kinda has a slight cereal-like taste to it), and is better for the environment and animal well-being."]}
