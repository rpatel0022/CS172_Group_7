Absolutely insane.", "[Baba Yaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga) is a witch from Slavic folklore who lives in the woods in a hut that stands on chicken legs.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI have been wanting to make this out of gingerbread for a long time but I always put it off because I wasn\u2019t sure I could pull it off (and I thought it would be a lot of work - it was). This one is honestly more engineering than baking, which I am terrible at (which is why structural baking has always intimidated me). I initially made a sample hut out of cardboard and used that to generate my own structural plans. I also made a wooden form to shape the gingerbread roof on as soon as it came out of the oven to get that curved effect. I cut and baked the gingerbread one day and then assembled the hut with royal icing the next day. I let that dry overnight before decorating, which basically also took a day.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor the decorations: the roof is made of cereal and the eye, windows, feathers, and Baba Yaga\u2019s hair are made of wafer paper colored with edible ink. I made modeling chocolate to shape a chocolate tree, edge around the chimney, and eyelids and then used silicone molds to cast the skulls and Baba Yaga face out of chocolate. I also made a cake colored with spinach and tore that apart for the moss. Finally there are crumbled gingerbread pieces and sprinkles on there as well. I used a pair of bird claw candle stick holders attached to plexiglass to hold the structure up.\n\n\n\nBird feet and plexiglass aside, everything is entirely edible. Since I don\u2019t intend on eating it, I went ahead and used regular sugar/flour for the gingerbread and chocolate (it\u2019s so much cheaper and easier though I do have a gluten free and sugar free gingerbread recipe). I also dropped some lit incense down the chimney to get smoke coming from it. The cake and roof tiling are gluten-free and sugar free. Without the bird feet, the hut stands over a foot tall. I will count this a success in structural baking and NEVER want to do a gingerbread ever again. This project nearly broke me had me rethinking my life choices multiple times, especially while gluing all the roof tiles and gingerbread sprinkles on one by one. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/baba-yaga-gingerbread-house-process-HhpiOUK) are some quick phone snaps of the process along with a [source of inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/corvids/comments/1d88zge/my_friend_ed_the_raven/) for this project.

The Lion King was one of my favorite animations growing up. I knew all the songs by heart, I cried when Mufasa ~~died~~ was murdered, and I longed for cool uncles like Timon and Pumbaa (mostly Pumbaa, let\u2019s be real). I also remember having a visceral reaction to the Hakuna Matata Trio feasting on grubs that they\u2019d harvested from under logs and unceremoniously plopped on their leaf plates. According to the Wiki, \u201cgrubs are a species of animal native to Hakuna Matata, the Outlands, the Pride Lands, and the Tree of Life.\u201d While I had zero desire to scrounge up actual insects for this challenge (I really could have since, as an agricultural country, there are areas in the Philippines that practice entomophagy), I knew I wanted to somehow make these \u201cslimy, yet satisfying\u201d Grub from The Lion King. Enter the sapin-sapin.\n\nMade from glutinous rice flour, coconut milk, and sugar, Sapin-Sapin is a layered dessert that is steamed and traditionally served on a banana leaf lined bilao, a flat, circular winnower. Before steaming, the batter is divided into three bowls, flavored with fruits or root crop, and enhanced with artificial coloring. Often served during big parties or fiestas due to its colorful appearance, the commonly used flavors and colors for sapin-sapin are fresh ripe langka (jackfruit) for the yellow layer, macapuno (young coconut sport) for the white layer, and ube (purple yam ***not*** purple sweet potato) for the purple layer. The first colored batter is poured into the mold, steamed for a few minutes, then the process is repeated with the next two colors. The end result is a dessert with distinctly colored layers (the literal translation of sapin-sapin is \u201clayer-layer\u201d).\n\nFor this dish, I divided the batter into 8 colors: red (strawberry jam), orange (jackfruit), yellow (jackfruit), green (buko pandan or young coconut and screwpine extract), blue (ube), violet (ube), white (macapuno), black (ube). I then steamed them layer by layer in bug shaped silicone molds. Scattered around the grubs is latik tagalog (caramelized coconut curds) which is sprinkled on sapin-sapin when served. I was so happy with how these turned out!

Too much agar agar, and it will become completely opaque, too little, and it will fall apart the second you want to unmold it. It took many, many tries to get it right, or at least right enough.\nSince it is very pretty, but to be honest, a tasteless dessert, it's the opposite of my matcha cookies.

The grew so well!! So lovely. But two problems. 1. It was too much oil. 2. I took them out to early and they deflated. \n\nI immediately wanted to make a 3rd batch but the steak was done and I didnt want to end up with a bunch more of soggy buns. \n\nI will say, the flavor is DELICIOUS. They tasted more eggy than I pictured them, but yum!\n\n I want to try again as soon as possible to get those golden buns I see online. If anyone has a favorite recipe they like to follow let me know!", "Can someone PLEASE explain to an American what constitutes a \"pudding\"?

New Zealand also happens to be the home of some amazing [glow worm caves](https://myqueenstowndiary.com/waitomo-caves-new-zealand/) and these are still one of my favorite things I have seen in person. The glow worms (Arachnocampa luminosa) are an endemic species of fungus gnat that uses bioluminescence and silk snares to capture their prey during their larval stage. This dessert is a fusion of the two ideas. I may have taken a bit of poetic license with the appearance of the glow worms to make them resemble the traditional M\u0101ori food of [huhu grubs](https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/10075/huhu-grub). Rather than tasting like chicken though, these are made of marzipan. To keep with my Halloween meta, I also added a white chocolate skull, meringue mushrooms, and moss of crumbled cake atop the filling of whipped cream, ganache, and fresh raspberries. This pavlova is to feature glow worms after all so I needed to make them glow. I remembered a post by u/AndroidAnthem last year about glowing cupcakes and decided to see what else I could get to fluoresce under a UV light. I reduced some quinine containing tonic water for dipping the marzipan worms to get their characteristic blue glow, and used chlorophyl containing crumbled spinach cake (I promise you can\u2019t taste it) that fluoresces red.

{"title": "Week 16: Battered - Citrus Birthday Cake", "selftext": "This is my birthday cake for this year, I\u2019ll start by saying that I feel like this is a bit of a cop out by me because I was always going to bake myself a cake, but the theme was announced just before I decided on what I was going to bake...and I definitely did make a cake batter...\nand I have done an awful lot of deep frying lately... Usually I get inspiration from the theme but this time the theme has taken inspiration from the day of my birth!\n\nBecause my birthday is right at the beginning of Spring, I am always drawn to flavours and decoration that represent the change of season. I have always loved citrus in desserts, and it felt right for the warmer weather. I thought it would be fun to celebrate all kinds of citrus all in one cake and took ideas from [this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/6-inch-citrus-cake/) which uses mixed zest and juice into the batter, I doubled the cake recipe and baked it in two 9-inch tins. I managed to find lime, lemon, orange, grapefruit and blood oranges at the supermarket, and I thought it would be fun to make each one into a different curd. [This](https://buttermilkbysam.com/the-best-lemon-curd/) is my favourite lemon curd recipe because it has a lot of lemon juice and zest so it\u2019s extra tangy, and also uses whole eggs so there is no faff with separating yolks, you just sieve any bits out at the end to give a silky texture. I made a small batch of this recipe 5 times, just changing the citrus each time to get 5 different curds. I realised my lemon, lime and orange curd all looked pretty much identical so I added a few drops of food colouring so I could identify each curd more easily. I was going for pastel colours but it's ended up more neon but hey at least they look different!\n\nI cut my cakes into thirds to get 6 layers in total, then layered up with [stabilised whipped cream](https://livslittlemuffins.com/stabilized-whipped-cream/) and curd. I kept the decoration pretty simple because there\u2019s a lot going on inside, so did a naked style cake with some extra cream on top, then finished with slices of all the different citrus fruits. I loved the way this recipe came together, I used all the leftover zest and juice from making the curds in the cake batter so was left with no wasted fruit!

{"title": "Week 10: Rice - Tumpeng", "selftext": "This week I made a celebratory Indonesian dish called Tumpeng which is a cone of rice surrounded by side dishes. The dish is full of philosophical and religious symbolism: making the rice cone is supposed to represent the idea that you get stronger as you mature, as the rice only becomes stable in the mould using pressure and leaving it for some time. It is also thought to be pointing skyward towards God and also represents the mountains of the country, with the side dishes representing flora and fauna.\n\nThe version I made is called Tumpeng Nasi Kuning so the [rice](https://www.cookmeindonesian.com/nasi-kuning-yellow-rice-vegan/) is coloured yellow to symbolise prosperity, and flavoured with turmeric, lemongrass, pandan leaf, kaffir lime leaf and coconut milk. There were two dishes using an interesting marination technique that I hadn't tried before: [ayam bakar](https://www.cookmeindonesian.com/ayam-bakar-solo-solonese-grilled-chicken/) which is chicken that is first braised in loads of ingredients (including some that were new to me like candlenuts and salam leaf), then left to marinate and then grilled. A similar technique is also used on the [telur pindang](https://whattocooktoday.com/telur-pindang.html) - marinated marbled eggs. I also made [perkedel](https://whattocooktoday.com/perkedel-kentang-potato-fritters.html) (mashed potato fritters), [tempe orek](https://muchbutter.com/authentic-indonesian-tempeh-orek/)(stir fried tempeh), [urap sayur](https://cinnamonsnail.com/urap-sayur-salad/)(green beans, beansprouts and spinach topped with a toasted coconut dressing) and [sambal terasi](https://whattocooktoday.com/sambal-terasi.html)(shrimp paste chilli sauce).\n\nThis was lots of fun to make and really interesting to research.

So I asked in the Discord and a few people suggested banchan \u2013 Korean side dishes served alongside steamed rice.\n\nSo, this is my celebration of all things cruciferous in banchan form, starring broccoli, cabbage, pak choi, mustard leaves, daikon and of course, Chinese leaf (Napa cabbage).

I piped the details, left it to dry for a few hours and then realised my mistake as soon as I tried to pipe the cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re in.

Remove the Spam from the plastic wrap and place on a sheet of pastry. Top with the second sheet. Trim away the excess dough, then press edges together with a fork to seal.    \n    \nBeat the egg yolks with 1 tsp of water. Brush the pastry with half of the egg mixture, the place in the fridge.

Now the dinosaurs were of two kinds. Some had flat teeth, and ate the leaves of trees, and some had sharp teeth for eating meat, and they preyed upon the leaf-eaters. Then it happened that the trees began to die. The mighty beasts who appeared to rule the earth, were, in truth, ruled by the leaf. Desperate for food, some of the dinosaur herds struck out to the west, in search of the Great Valley, a land still lush and green. It was a journey toward life.\n\nThe audience is transported back to the time of the dinosaurs... Dinosaurs in peril at every turn. The climate is changing and the dinosaurs must change with it. This causes the dinosaurs to take desperate actions, such as striking out West through the Mysterious Beyond in search of the Great Valley. A lush, verdant oasis where the food is still plentiful.\n\n(Canonically, the dinos don't see [the meteor](https://youtu.be/S3hJwroCIjY?si=3EsNNl39BwBRgZl8) that would decimate the dinos and herald the climate change until movie #7. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/exwbj2/the_land_before_time_the_series_will_end_with_the/) is my favorite fan theory about it. However, if you want to see a REALLY COOL yet at times controversial dinosaur site allegedly from the extinction event, check out the [Tanis site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanis_(fossil_site)) in North Dakota. There's also a great [BBC documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs:_The_Final_Day_with_David_Attenborough) narrated by the international treasure, [Sir David Attenborough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough).)\n\nThe movie follows Littlefoot, a [longneck dinosaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatosaurus). He is the only baby hatched along the herd's journey. As a young dinosaur, he meets others along the herd's path to the Great Valley, such as Cera the [three-horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triceratops). While playing with Cera against Cera's father's wishes, the pair encounter a [sharptooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus). They are saved by Littlefoot's mother, who is fatally injured. An [earthshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake) divides the land during the battle, separating the pair from the rest of the dinosaurs. With her last breaths, Littlefoot's mom tells him the landmarks he must follow to reach the Great Valley. And then the two youngsters are alone.\n\nLittlefoot and Cera pick up many friends along their journey, including Ducky the [bigmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurolophus), Petrie the [flyer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteranodon), and Spike the [spiketail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus). The group follows Littlefoot's mother's directions toward the Great Valley, hoping to be reunited with their remaining families. The sharptooth isn't far behind and tails the youngsters on their journey.\n\nWhile the first leg of their journey is completed in the film, these friendships launch a [huge franchise.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time) There are a total of 14 movies, a [TV series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time_(TV_series)), and 14 [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Land_Before_Time_video_games). \n\nBefore they meet the sharptooth, Littlefoot's mom gives him a [tree star](https://landbeforetime.fandom.com/wiki/Tree_Star). While these leaves are plentiful in the Great Valley, they are hard to come by in the Mysterious Beyond. [They are very special](https://youtu.be/Hd34t4wOnKQ). They are lush, inviting, and we [all wanted to eat them](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/s/iViZBDtCUI). As Littlefoot mourns her death, a single tree star [falls from above](https://youtu.be/8zAgCpBy__A). It helps him remember her directions to the Great Valley and find the strength to carry on.\n\nAs if making the 80's and 90's kids [relive the collective trauma](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/s/UcDgJqNl29) of Littlefoot's mom's death wasn't enough sadness, let's talk about Ducky's actress, [Judith Barsi.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Barsi) Her life was tragically cut short when she and her mother were murdered by her father. By all accounts, she was a kind-hearted girl and talented actress. \n\nAllegedly, Burt Reynolds needed [many takes](https://www.reddit.com/r/80s/s/Ds3LGyLakS) to record the ending to All Dogs Go to Heaven. Judith's lines were recorded before her death, and you can hear the real emotions in Burt's voice. I can't make it through that scene without crying.\n\nHer life and death are [worth reading](https://people.com/judith-barsi-murder-what-to-know-8701466) and with knowing about. Since this is r/52weeksofcooking and not r/truecrimediscussion, I'm trying to keep this very high level. However I would be remiss not to mention the bright little girl who was taken too soon. I wonder how far her she would have gone.\n\nFor this week, I wanted to highlight the tree stars that gave Littlefoot hope after his mom's passing and to Ducky's voice actor, Judith, who clearly needed some hope while she was here.\n\nI wanted to emulate the picture from the film linked in the gallery: a tree star covered in dewdrops on the barren ground of the Great Beyond. For the ground, I made a New York-Style Crumb Cake using [this recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/crumb-cake/). For the leaves, I made [modeling chocolate](https://thebearfootbaker.com/modeling-chocolate/) with green candy melts and used a [silicone mold](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSPPFVTY). I added a bit of edible gold luster dust to the edges. I used isomalt for the dewdrops using [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fhmgs4MK2g).\n\nThis was fun. I got to work with modeling chocolate, isomalt, and luster dust, all of which were new to me. I will definitely make another project that needs these, if only to get additional colors of luster dust to play with. It didn't photograph nearly as cool as it looked in person. The chocolate leaves tasted great, which is why I went that route rather than fondant. The cake was great! The kiddos loved it. I would do all of this again in a heartbeat. \n\nAs a side note, I love this week so much. I love everyone's submissions so much!

No matter where I searched, I couldn\u2019t find any Filipino dish that used yoghurt in any form. I finally landed on subbing yoghurt for some of the sweetened milk mixture found in ice candy, a frozen summer staple in the Philippines. Just like all the frozen fruit pops all over the world, ice candy is pretty simple to make. Mix fruit with the liquid of choice, pour into molds, freeze, and enjoy on a sunny day. Filipino ice candy is usually a concoction of sweetened condensed milk, regular or evaporated milk, and flavoring in the form of fruit, vegetables (root crop like ube, mung bean, corn), or chocolate drink mixes. Using a funnel, this concoction is then poured into narrow plastic tubes made specifically for this treat and frozen overnight. This post features buko pandan (shredded young coconut with screwpine flavored agar-agar), roasted mangoes with crushed graham crackers, and shredded cantaloupe. I replaced a bit of the milk mixture with yoghurt to fit with this theme. Of the three, only the roasted mango with graham crackers worked with the yoghurt. The flavors of the other two are more delicate and were overpowered by the tanginess of the yoghurt.

For a pack with three legs, I added a whole clove of garlic, one stalk lemongrass, along with whole versions of five spice for a little more flavor.\n* After cooking, I refrigerated the duck in a bag for a few days before making ramen. Interestingly, I think I prefer letting it \"cure\" a bit more in the bag than eating it fresh. When you're ready to eat, warm up the bag and strain out the liquids.\n* You can reheat at 375-400 for \\~12-15 minutes followed by low-heat broiler for 10 minutes to crisp up skin\n\n**Broth:**\n\n* Take any of the liquid drippings from the bag, strain, and add to pressure cooker or instant pot. Make sure to separate as much of the fat as possible (though don't worry if a little gets in)\n* Carefully pull out the bone from the meat. Add bones to the drippings + quartered onion, 1 stalk celery, 1 medium carrot, 3 garlic cloves, and 1in knob of smashed ginger. Add enough water to cover everything and set pressure cooker to high for 2 hours.\n* Prepare your dashi as you would for ramen normally (I like niboshi). The duck broth to dashi ratio should be about equal. I squeezed a little ginger juice into the broth to give it a slightly stronger zing.\n\n**Tare:**\n\n* A miso tare would work best with duck IMO. Given the duck's iron/mildly gamey flavor, I think the earthier, fruitier notes from miso balance out with the duck better compared to a shoyu (which could make the iron flavors more prominent) or shio tare (which I think would come across very one-note). Definitely consider adding a little more sweetness and acidity than you would normally as well.", "The dish looks so amazing.  But also the presentation in that  bowl is brilliant", "Each of these things sounds amazing separately, but there\u2019s so much going on flavor-wise that I would think there would be so much competition that it would be hard to pick out certain notes. I\u2019m curious if this was the case. Looks spectacular btw!", "Sorry but I\u2019m new to ramen and want to try this brilliant receipt out this weekend. What\u2019s the brown chips on the left? Is that bok choy on top? Ana\u2019s what\u2019s grated on the top? And what\u2019s your favorite ramen noodle?"]}

It was such a memorable dish, really rich but absolutely delicious. As soon as this theme was announced, my mind went to fresh pasta because I've never made it before and I got a pasta machine as a Christmas present. I looked up the Bancone dish and to my surprise I found [the whole recipe](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/silk-handkerchiefs-recipe), shared by Ben Waugh, the executive chef at Bancone. I hadn't planned to attempt the whole dish though, because that was three whole elements that I'd never made before, so triple the intimidation! But I thought about it and realised it was obviously perfect for this theme, so I just went for it.\n\nI first started pasta dough, because this recipe has you chill it for 2 hours. That was easy enough, so I turned to the confit egg yolk. They were also not too difficult, they just slowly cook in a bath of oil on a low heat in the oven. The beurre blanc was also not too scary but did require white balsamic (delicious and well worth it IMO) and a whole block of butter. The hardest part of the dish was using my pasta machine - it was a bit of a learning curve but I managed OK in the end!\n\nThe actual hardest part was plating. First on the plate is beurre blanc and chopped walnuts, then folded silk handkerchiefs, more beurre blanc, then a few more walnuts, the confit egg yolk and a dusting of parmesan. Luckily I made spare confit yolks because I broke half of them in the journey between oil and plate!\n\nThis dish was just as good as I remember, and it's a great example of how far I've come in my cooking journey. I really enjoyed all aspects of this challenge and have since made fresh pasta again because it was kind of revolutionary for me!

(Honorable mentions to the [highest grossing movie of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_box_office_records_set_by_Avatar) and the amazing [Heavenly Creatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Creatures) that introduced Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey to the world.) This makes Middle Earth fair game for the week.\n\nThe original [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)) movies were released in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien, two hobbits undertake an incredible journey to destroy the One Ring in Mt. Doom. Aided by many companions--initially Gandalf the Wizard, fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, men Aragorn and Boromir, elf Legolas, and dwarf Gimli--many, many adventures and misadventures are had.\n\nWhat was also happening around this time was the early proliferation of [Internet memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme). While the term \"meme\" was coined way back in 1972 as a way to describe cultural transmission, Internet memes really came into play in the mid-to-late 90's as the internet itself grew. Sites like [4chan,](https://www.4chan.org/) [Something Awful,](https://forums.somethingawful.com/) [Albino Blacksheep,](https://www.albinoblacksheep.com/) and [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/) flourished.\n\nSince the LotR movies were being released at just the right time, the images from the movies were perfect for early memes. Among this early flash animation is [Mashed Taters \u266b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihMMw0rnKz4). In the movie, Sam is trying to explain to Gollum that [hobbits eat their food cooked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7S4wPzcruY) Sam wishes he had taters to go with his rabbit stew. What's taters, Precious? You know... boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew. The video isn't super high quality by today's standards, but none of the flash animation from back then was. It is part of the charm. Honorable LotR meme award goes to [They're Taking the Hobbits to Isengard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-1RPDqJAY), which just sort of runs on a continual loop in my subconscious.\n\nIt's hard for me to try and describe why any of the early flash was catchy or funny. Since I apparently am that old and have been shitposting on the Internet since before that time, it just was. Early internet really was like the wild west... A place to really let your goofy and witty side run amok with people who appreciated it for what it was. It landed for me at a really impressionable time in my late teens and early 20's and is definitely why I landed at Reddit.\n\nSo for this week I wanted to celebrate taters... Boiled, mashed, and stewed. So I made potatoes three ways. I used [The Starving Chef's Shirecuterie board](https://thestarvingchefblog.com/lord-of-the-rings-potatoes-boil-em-mash-em-stick-em-in-a-stew/) as a springboard. From that post I made the boiled potato skewers and mashed potato fries. I used [this recipe](https://www.food.com/recipe/crock-pot-style-loaded-baked-potato-soup-301754) for a crock pot baked potato soup.\n\nI will say that the potato skewers and smash fries were just okay. I wouldn't repeat them unless I was actually having a LotR party. However, the baked potato soup was awesome. The recipe calls to leave it more chunky, but no one liked the texture. I smoothed it out with my immersion blender and it was glorious. It made banging leftovers for a few days. I will definitely make that again.\n\nPop culture meta explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/lvK8Bvj7GM).", "As a fellow Old, I appreciate the reference to ABS.

He's a blue collar worker that is living in a trailer park in Detroit. He and everyone he knows is struggling with money, urban violence, and direction in their lives. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Jimmy sees the rap battle circuit and fame as his ticket out. The movie swings back and forth between the violence and uncertainty in Jimmy's life, his efforts to turn things around, and his efforts to get noticed and respected as a rapper. \n\nLoosely based on Eminem's life, [\"Lose Yourself\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lose_Yourself)\n was written on set during filming breaks. A critical and commercial success, it was the first hip hop song to receive an Academy Award for Best song. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Solo Performance. It was one of only three rap songs from the 21st century to be included on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time back in 2004. In short, it helped cement Eminem's position as a rap superstar.\n\nThe beginning of the song talks about B-Rabbit being nervous in a rap battle that bombs out:\n\nHis palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\n\nThere's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti\n\nHe's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready\n\nWhile the song is notable in and of itself, \"mom's spaghetti\" has taken on a life of its own as a [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/moms-spaghetti). Riffing on the lyrics from \"Lose Yourself,\" it started making the rounds on early Internet boards like 4chan, FARK, and LS1TECH. It became a proxy for any awkward situation and ends up with random spaghetti at the end. I still see it pop up here on Reddit pretty frequently.\n\nSo for homemade pasta week, I wanted to celebrate Eminem's mom's spaghetti. This song has a special place in my heart and I listened to it frequently post-divorce. I don't normally swing towards hip hop, but these lyrics spoke and still speak to me during hard times.\n\n(Also a plug here for my favorite cover of this song. Robyn Adele Anderson does a fantastic [Gypsy swing cover](https://youtu.be/NeB9TSu08KU?si=UIH-qcjz-Akx81fG) of Lose Yourself for [Postmodern Jukebox.](https://youtube.com/@postmodernjukebox?si=ebzDcmHB81G4etfQ). Postmodern Jukebox does old-style covers of modern songs. Their remixes are amazing.)\n\nSince I could not reign myself in for this challenge, I made both a savory and a sweet tribute.\n\nSpringboarding off the song lyrics, Eminem opened a [Mom's Spaghetti](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom%27s_Spaghetti) in downtown Detroit. It sells spaghetti and spaghetti-related merchandise. The [online store](https://momsspaghetti.com/products/moms-spaghetti-pasta-sauce) describes the dish as follows:\n\n\"For the most legitimate mom's spaghetti pasta, pull some pre-cooked spaghetti from the fridge and reheat in a frying pan while adding your mom's spaghetti sauce ... It\u2019s ready when the noodles have a bit of a snap and the sauce is heated to taste ... That's how you get a great leftover taste the first time around! Add powdered parm and serve with some texas toast with garlic butter for s'ghetti like we serve it up on woodward avenue in downtown Detroit.\"\n\nFor the savory dish, I tried to emulate the down-to-earth, homey feeling rather than doing something fancy. I used [this recipe](https://www.food.com/recipe/my-super-simple-spaghetti-sauce-266734) for the sauce and [this recipe](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/simple-meatball-recipe/2959910f-1b27-438a-9085-d40b1950db20) for the meatball version of the dish. \n\nI tried and failed to make spaghetti from scratch. It wouldn't come together in the stand mixer and I have early onset arthritis, which makes it hard to knead dough for that long. So it goes. I didn't count it as a fail because it's important to learn your limits. \n\nIt was decent. It tasted like something my mom would make, assuming she didn't make everything from a box or a jar.  I would have used dried mixed onions rather than fresh for texture, but my mom wouldn't have substituted haha.\n\nBecause I couldn't leave a fun idea just sitting there, I made a sweet version of this! While researching, I found a [news story](https://austin.eater.com/2024/10/18/24273861/eminem-f1-birthday-cake-austin-spaghetti-and-meatballs-hannah-brockert-formula-one) about an Austin baker who made Eminem a giant spaghetti birthday cake when he was there for F1 last fall. It went viral. You can see Hannah Brockert talk about her process in [this news segment](https://www.fox7austin.com/video/1537760). She made a devil's food cake with peanut butter frosting, strawberry sauce with a touch of vanilla buttercream for viscosity, and rice krispie style meatballs out of Chocolatey Chocolate Lucky Charms. That sounded amazing and I *needed* it. \n\nI made a smaller version of the cake with three 8\" rounds of [Nana's Devil's food cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/jd3hf3/comment/g97212w/). I made [Wilton's peanut butter buttercream](https://wilton.com/peanut-butter-buttercream-frosting-recipe/wlrecip-141/). I made a double batch [this strawberry sauce](https://www.sugarologie.com/recipes/strawberry-puree) and added about 1/4 a recipe of [this vanilla buttercream](https://www.twosisterscrafting.com/buttercream-frosting). The strawberry sauce says no blender, but I opted to use one anyway to make it very smooth and distribute the buttercream evenly. I used [this rice krispie treat recipe](https://www.twosisterscrafting.com/christmas-rice-krispie-treat-bites/) as a general guide since it included rolling and shaping. I also used a tiny bit of zested white melting chocolate leftover from my [Tanzania grubs](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/KEEEmcNqHB) for parmesan. I piped the frosting on the stacked cake to look like spaghetti.\n\nOh man. If the other recipe was simple, this cake was decadent. I was worried it would taste too much like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. It didn't. I usually don't like fruit sauce in my cakes because most bakeries use more of a jelly-like filling. The strawberry sauce was hands down the best part of the cake. The combo was fantastic. It was very, very rich.

The sun rises over the Pride Lands and the world bursts into song celebrating the birth of the new king. All creatures come to pay homage to the little lion cub, Simba. Simba is held for all to behold and he in turn beholds his kingdom. I get goosebumps every time.\n\nThe Lion King is set in the Pride Lands, a vast open savannah plain. This is inspired by natural landscapes of [Serengeti National Park ](https://www.journeybeyond.travel/real-life-setting-of-the-lion-king/) in Tanzania. The park is part of the route of the [Great Migration](https://www.serengeti.com/great-migration-africa.php), the annual migration of  wildebeest. Calves are born in the Serengeti and then migrate en masse across the plain and into the [Masai Mara reserve](https://www.masaimara.com/) in neighboring Kenya. Scar uses the Great Migration to stage Mufasa's murder and Simba's attempted murder.\n\nAfter Simba flees the Pride Lands, he takes refuge in the jungle. He is raised by Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him a carefree lifestyle.\n\nTimon: Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase.\n\nPumbaa: Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze.\n\nTimon: It means no worries for the rest of your days.\n\nBoth: It's our problem-free philosophy!\n\nTimon: Hakuna Matata.\n\nAs part of living with two prey animals, Simba gives up eating meat for [grubs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSerlz47srg). As in insects. So this is what I made.\n\nFor this week, I wanted to showcase The Lion King, their grubs, and the gorgeous Serengeti for Tanzania week. I thought about doing this for Animated Week, but held off just in case Tanzania popped up. I am glad I did because Tanzania, but also because u/chizubeetpan made Lion King Grubs for that week. (They are amazing, go check out [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1jabqec/week_8_animated_the_lion_king_sapinsapin_steamed/)!) So y'all get a second round of grubs.\n\nI went the candy-making route and wanted to make candy that tasted as described in the movie. In the scene, we see:\n\n * A grub that tastes like chicken\n\n * A grub that is slimy yet satisfying\n\n * A red beetle that is piquant with a very pleasant crunch\n\n * A blue beetle that is filled with cream\n\nI made gummy caterpillars for the first two following [this recipe](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/real-gummy-bear-recipe/#recipe). I used strawberry flavor and pink color for the \"slimy yet satisfying\" ones. For the chicken ones, I had a leftover jar of chicken baby food from when my kitty was sick. I mixed that in rather than flavoring and left them naturally chicken-colored. Since I had another set of molds for the other grubs, I also made yellow mango-flavored ones. The flavored oils I used were really strong, so I used half as much with the mango ones. That was a smarter choice.\n\nFor the filled grubs, I made filled chocolates following [this recipe](https://icecreaminspiration.com/easy-homemade-filled-chocolates/). I used colored melting chocolate and made the fondant filling. I used whipped cream flavor for the blue ones. For the red, I used butter pecan with a dash of cinnamon. I added toasted pecans because my childhood self heard \"pecan\" because I didn't know the word \"piquant\" yet.\n\nThese were fun! The kids loved them. I would definitely make them again, except for the chicken ones. I let my little lion investigate those. He kept licking the air because he couldn't figure out where the chicken smell was coming from. (This was fine. There was too much sugar to actually give it to my orange floof, so it was just for show. He got many treats for being my model.) The chicken one wasn't bad, but sugar chicken isn't my favorite. I haven't done a lot of candy-making, so this was a fun experience.\n\nPop culture meta explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/lvK8Bvj7GM).", "Ok I giggled way too hard at this.

Essentially the recipe is as easy as boil the noodles - create the sauce - combine.\n\nFor the sauce we whisked: gochujang, gochugaru flakes, honey, soy sauce, sugar, minced garlic, sesame oil, and rice vinegar. \n\nStart by boiling salted water. The noodles take about ~12 minutes.\n\nIn the meantime we rendered the pancetta. After about 4 minutes we added onion, mushrooms, and black garlic until aromatic. In goes about a cup or so of kimchi. Stir in the sauce to incorporate everything. When the noodles are ready, drain and add to the sauce with sliced scallions. Let all the flavors get too know each other. We fried up a couple of eggs, soft boiled would have been great too. Also garnished with lime juice and seaweed salad for a (much needed) fresh aspect.\n\nThis dish had a ton of complex flavors and a pretty high level of heat but it was so delicious that we both went back for seconds.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to try a very unique and foreign concept in kawaii next week.

It\u2019s salty, umami, and sweet so the spicy and vinegary pickled cucumber helps balance that. Traditionally it is served over rice so I used a konjac based rice to keep it low carb. To give it a halloween look, I added a chili flavored tuile that I briefly torched to give it some contrast.\n\n\n\nThe second side dish I made is Liang ban hei mu er, a wood ear mushroom salad. If you\u2019ve never had wood ear mushrooms before they are a fun experience. They are a bit crunchy and springy even after some cooking and take on the flavor of whatever sauce they are in. Here, I used coconut aminos, chili crunch, toasted sesame oil, and black vinegar.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe last dish is a version of boba tea. Apparently it was invented in Taiwan in the 1980s and is traditionally made with tea mixed with fruit or milk along with sweetened tapioca pearls known as boba. Over time there have been lots of variations made both in the flavors of tea or dink base (to include things like chocolate, coffee, and caramel or any fruit you like) to the pearls themselves. Gaining in popularity are pearl alternatives such as popping boba, grass jelly, and red beans. I opted to make my own mango flavored popping pearls and added them to a milky matcha.

{"title": "Week 8: Animated - Lasagna (Garfield)", "selftext": "When Garfield, the lasagna-loving cat, first appeared in 1978, no one could have predicted that his obsession with the cheesy pasta would elevate lasagna to new heights of popularity. While there\u2019s no official data linking Garfield\u2019s debut directly to a spike in lasagna sales, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that this lazy, lasagna-obsessed tabby cat became a food icon. If Garfield loved it, then surely everyone else would too, right? It\u2019s likely that many people saw Garfield devouring plate after plate and thought, \"Maybe I should try this lasagna thing.\"\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about lasagna\u2019s unofficial link to Mondays. Have you ever noticed that people tend to serve lasagna on Mondays? Garfield would approve\u2014after all, it\u2019s a comforting dish to ease you into the week. Who wants to deal with sad salads or boring sandwiches when you could dive into a hearty, cheesy serving of lasagna to kickstart your week? It\u2019s like Garfield knew that Mondays needed some extra love in the form of carbs and cheese.\n\nIn the end, Garfield didn\u2019t just entertain us\u2014he made lasagna cool. The comic helped keep the dish front and center in pop culture, and it\u2019s no surprise that more people probably turned to lasagna after seeing that orange tabby enjoying it. So, whether it\u2019s a Monday or any day of the week, if Garfield was around, I\u2019d bet he\u2019d still be reminding us to enjoy a big plate of lasagna.

I was feeling like a responsible, independent child, so I marched into the store, grabbed a cart, and made one bold decision: cereal. The whole cart was filled with nothing but boxes\u2014cereal, cereal, and more cereal. I didn\u2019t get bread, veggies, or even a loaf of meat. I was ready to live my best life with nothing but cereal.\n\nWhen I got home, my mom\u2019s face went through a range of emotions\u2014confusion, disbelief, mild concern. \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of the food?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe can\u2019t live off cereal!\u201d But I was undeterred. I had an idea. I could make it work. After all, cereal is versatile, right?\n\nOn day one, I made \u201cCereal Surprise Soup.\u201d I grabbed three different boxes, mixed them together in a bowl, and added some milk. Then I threw in some random fruit I found in the fridge for good measure. I called it \"soup\" to make it sound fancy. My mom, raising an eyebrow, took a tentative spoonful, then reluctantly said, \u201cIt\u2019s... something.\u201d I took that as a win.\n\nDay two was \u201cFrosted Flake Frittata.\u201d I decided cereal could be a breakfast and dinner food, so I saut\u00e9ed some flakes in butter, scrambled a couple of eggs, and topped it off with cheese. It looked a bit like scrambled eggs on a cereal landscape\u2014not a masterpiece, but edible enough to keep the family alive.\n\nBy day three, I had honed my culinary craft and served up \u201cHoney Nut Flake Stir-Fry.\u201d I threw some honey-coated flakes into a pan with whatever I could find in the fridge (yes, a couple of wilting carrots, don\u2019t ask), added a dash of soy sauce, and called it \u201cfusion cuisine.\u201d It was crunchy, it was confusing, but it was... something you could chew.\n\nThen came the grand finale\u2014\u201cCereal Shepherd\u2019s Pie.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to let this cereal extravaganza end without a big flourish. I mashed up some cereal (yes, mashed cereal), added milk and butter, and spread it over a layer of\u2014you guessed it\u2014more cereal. Then, I baked it until it looked like a casserole that might just have had a midlife crisis. My brother tried it and called it \u201cthe weirdest shepherd\u2019s pie ever,\u201d but he ate the whole thing, which I considered a solid victory.\n\nBy the end of the week, I had turned cereal into a gourmet disaster that would haunt us forever. But hey, it was a week of creative meals\u2014and that\u2019s what truly matters.\n\nNow, if you\u2019d like to try your own shepherd's pie and other meals like tacos and a BBQ bowl based off of smoked flat iron steak, potatoes, carrots, and broccoli, here\u2019s how to make them:\n\nI actually just winged these dishes, but I am sure you can make up as you go to after reading a recipe or two. :)", "If you don't mind me asking, did you cook the meals with your partner?

She is then hunted and beheaded by Perseus. The image of Medusa has been regaining popularity and power over time (and I love that she is more well known than her aggressors). Most recently as a symbol of justice for wrongs against women in the MeToo movement, which has led to some progress in accountability in sexual assault and resulted in legal action against some guilty prominent figures as well changing the law around sexual harassment and NDAs.

These are colored wide udon noodles (Oni-Himokawa Udon) shaped into Maria Clara and Balintawak, which are two of the Philippines\u2019 traditional attire collectively known as Filipiniana. The first and third photo are of the uncooked noodle dresses, the rest are photos of them cooked.\n\nThis tells the story of the three major occupations of the Philippines\u2014told through fashion and food. Before the Spanish colonized the country, pre-colonial Filipinas wore clothing that was both functional and climate-appropriate. Depending on which part of the archipelago you were in, women wore a tapis [tah-pis] (a wraparound skirt often made of sheer fabric) or a saya [sah-yah] (longer, patterned skirts), paired with a baro [bah-rho] (a collarless blouse or jacket), or sometimes no top at all (because again, tropical, humid, aka it just wasn\u2019t practical).\n\nWhen the Spanish occupied the islands and forced the different groups under one flag, they wanted to \u201cChristianize\u201d and \u201ccivilize\u201d (read: control) the locals.  As part of this, they demonized pre-colonial clothing and introduced strict standards of feminine modesty. They enforced new dress codes: the sheer tapis became an accessory worn over the thicker saya, the baro became mandatory with longer sleeves, necklines were raised, and a pa\u00f1uelo [pah-nwe-loh] or kerchief was added for extra coverage. The black and white noodle dress here is a \u201cMaria Clara\u201d which evolved from the more formal version of the baro\u2019t saya that the Spanish imposed.\n\nOver time, Filipinas gained more control over their fashion and adapted it to better suit the climate. Necklines became lower, sleeves shorter, and hemlines inched higher. By the time the Americans bought control of the Philippines, dresses like the more casual Balintawak [bah-lyn-tah-wack] were widely worn. These dresses were typically made from cotton or calico in bright plaid or checkered patterns and were worn by women working closer to the land. The plaid Balintawaks came to symbolize the bayanihan [buy-uh-nee-hun] spirit of communal unity and Filipino identity in the countryside. Interestingly, these dresses were often immortalized in famous artworks, which, while promoting American colonial narratives of peaceful rural life, ignored the occupiers\u2019 violent repression of freedom fighters in those same areas.\n\nBoth of these dresses were made using a noodle from the third major\u2014and shortest, but most intense, violent, and traumatic\u2014occupation of the Philippines: Japan. The Oni-Himokawa Udon is a wide, uncut udon from the Gunma Prefecture in Japan, typically dipped into flavorful broths or tsuyu.\n\nInstead of the usual tsuyu made of sake, mirin, soy sauce, kombu, and katsuobushi, I made a Filipino-style dipping sauce or sawsawan [sahw-sah-wan] with Filipino soy sauce or toyo [toh-yoh], kalamansi (Philippine lemons), bagoong (fermented shrimp paste), garlic, tanglad (lemongrass), and bird\u2019s eye chili. Salty, sweet, umami, a little bit funky and all Filipino. \n\nI sat on this idea for weeks and finally just went out and made it in the middle of the night (this is becoming a recurring theme with me and 52WOC) with no dress pattern or plan in sight. This explains many of the imperfections in the size, construction, and pattern. I followed Just One Cookbook\u2019s recipe for udon, colored the dough, rolled it out into thin ravioli sheets, and just winged the cutting and \"fabric patterns.\" The Maria Clara was relatively easy and I had a lot of fun making the \"lacework\" in the tapis. The Balintawak though? \ud83d\ude2c Had to work really fast to keep the dough from drying out, then I rolled it out too thin, which made the plaid pattern go all wonky. I went with it anyway because I was out of dough and it was 1:30AM.\n\nCooking these was an adventure, too! I initially steamed them, but that did not work. So, I resorted to boiling these more vigorously than I had intended because I was losing the light for the photos. Instead, I lost a few chunks of the sleeves and parts of the dresses tore. But for the most part, this was a success. The sawsawan was also SO GOOD. We just had this for dinner and 10/10 would recommend. Brb, gonna go make more noodle couture. \ud83c\udf5c\ud83d\udc57\n \n\n[Meta explanation and list of posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/NWCIKEjGTD)", "Woah, I initially thought those were doll clothes as a backdrop and looked for the pasta!!

Chewy, moist, and savory textures and flavors that'd come with a streaming hot bite - oftentimes burning the top of your tongue. They would always be ordered anytime I saw them on a Chinese restaurant menu. Under my fascination, I never quite understood how they were made.\n\nThis week's theme was a great opportunity to explore the process involved in folding the delicate bites. I went to Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt for his [Serious Eats soup dumpling recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/soup-dumplings-xiao-long-bao-recipe). Kenji is a go-to source for much of my exploration. I appreciate how much he tinkers for his own sake of learning while still having a great deal of appreciation for food being food at the end of the day. \n\nMy experience with Chinese dumplings are bulking potstickers. Usually 100-200 at a time to be thrown in a freezer for a quick appetizer or meal. Upon my research for soup dumplings, I  stumbled upon [Maggie Zhu's recipe](https://omnivorescookbook.com/soup-dumplings/) in addition to Kenji's. There were a few differences but I wanted to eliminate any intimidating friction in starting. I made the dough from scratch which if you've followed my previous posts has always been intimidating. I reduced chicken wings, chicken broth, ginger, peppercorn, and green onions down over a couple of hours and had totally forgotten the bacon. At this point, I felt a bit nervous if the amount of gelatin would be enough. Whatever... I placed the gelatin into the fridge for cooling. I switched over to making dough - which has always felt too messy and too precise, particularly in baking, for me to feel comfortable. Surprisingly, the bao dough was incredibly easy to work with! I mixed the gelatin with ground pork, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, and sugar. My had to recruit my wife in helping with dividing and rolling the dough and forming the dumplings. Our first dozen wrappers were a bit too dense and thick. I steamed a few to test and we realized we could roll the wrappers thinner.\tOverall, we made around 70-80 soup dumplings.\n\nEarlier in the week, I had an extra gallon of milk lying around. On a whim, I grabbed some rennet in the local grocery store's baking section and tried [Gemma Stafford's mozzarella recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk6tQfArMvw). I've made paneer before so making a very basic cheese wasn't too scary. The mozzarella turned out subpar... [Pictured here](https://i.imgur.com/IsFeCg8.jpeg), I had it with some store-bought bruschetta, balsamic, and basil. The texture was almost there but I think I didn't squeeze enough of the liquid out for the cheese to be stretched, folded, and shaped well. Will try again!\n\nI really enjoyed this week's projects to push me a bit."]}

I'm going to take a moment to acknowledge my privilege: I work part-time and from my home, leaving me plenty of free time; I also have a large, well equipped kitchen and access to virtually any ingredients that I want. I'm someone who enjoys the process of cooking - there's something immensely satisfying about the act of making food and serving it to people you love for me. I don't choose to eat traditional instant food because it takes the fun out of it for me. (Also, I'm a try-hard.)\n\nAll that said, I'm also someone with a disability that causes chronic pain. On **bad days**, cooking is pretty much impossible because of it. On those days, dinner is an assembly of whatever is in the kitchen and requires no or minimal prep - something that can be ready in an instant - since I don't have anyone who can cook for me. This week's dish is one of those days: \n\n**Beetroot houmous** is a staple at this time of year. It's one of the few ways I'll eat beets and has the benefit of being bright pink. This is from my fridge, having been made for snacking purposes earlier in the week. A few basic subs for my meta, including exchanging lemon juice for vinegar, skipping the oil and tahini. (Yes, I know this isn't real houmous at all - in British English, the word is used to describe any chickpea dip at this stage.)\n\nTopping the beetroot houmous is **lentils and mushrooms with spring greens**. It's just saut\u00e9ed British grown mushrooms, garlic and onions with puy lentils. My instant cheat here is tinned lentils - not as tasty as ones home cooked in stock but significantly faster. For a speedy flavour boost, I added some miso and soy sauce instead. Finally, I added thyme leaves from my kitchen garden and chiffonaded local spring greens. \n\nIt's topped with **home-made soy yogurt** from the fridge and charred pita. The pita were homemade ages ago and have been hanging out in the freezer so I just tossed them on the grill pan for a couple of minutes to refresh them. \n\nThe whole meal took 10 minutes to cook and assemble, which is basically instant for me. It's also simple enough for me to do with pain pill brain fog. \n\n**Total carbon per plate is 780g CO2e.** The CO2e per serving is equivalent to driving 2.66 miles in an average UK petrol car. \n\n*A note on carbon calculations*: these are approximate, given the limited data sets available to the public. One of the biggest limitations is that they are averaged across the year, rather than considering how seasonality influences carbon use in vegetable production. In the UK winter, it is lower carbon to eat apples from New Zealand than British ones that have been preserved but my data set does not consider this. The lowest carbon option is to avoid out of season produce in the first place. Get to know what grows around you and when for the freshest, best tasting and most environmentally friendly choice.\n\n**A Lot of Words About My Meta:**\n\nOur world is in crisis - we face the prospect of catastrophic climate change and we are poisoning the ecosystem on which we all depend for survival. The political has to become personal and we should all be making efforts to change. While businesses might be responsible for the majority of emissions, they're doing that in response to consumer demand, so we need to step up and demand sustainable practices.\n\nMeat and dairy cause the majority of the carbon dioxide emissions from the human diet so this meta theme might seem like cheating for a vegan. However, I believe we can always to better. \n\nI always try to menu plan to use local, seasonal vegetables as the basis of our diet but now I'll be focusing in on other imported or highly processed foods too: if a recipe calls for citrus juice (always imported in my country), can it be replaced with a locally produced acid, such as vinegar? Can I replace the coconut milk in my recipe with a homemade hazel, pea or oat cream? What ingredients can I forage, since wild ingredients typically have the lowest carbon footprint? With limited space and skill, I'll try to grow some of my own foods too - at least herbs.\n\nWhere possible, I'll be using fresh food over processed and following the advice from Lowly Food, who has a nice [write up on the low carbon diet](https://www.lowlyfood.com/what-is-the-low-carbon-diet/).  I'll also be calculating the carbon value of each meal to better understand the impacts of my choices. It's not going to be exact but I hope to learn more about how I can make the most ethical choices. \n\nAlong with carbon, I'll try to think about water usage, soil health and biodiversity. That might mean swapping rice for millet (a far less water intensive grain), or using hazelnuts and sunflower seeds instead of cashews and almonds.\n\nThe aim here is to understand how I can make our everyday diet more sustainable and to share those findings with anyone who is interested.\n\nTL; DR: Eat plants, save the planet.", "Take care! Beautiful post as per usual.", "Beautiful dish, if I could make mine look half as good as yours I would be so happy. \n\nAnd many congratulations on the three year anniversary!", "I live beet hummus.

I decided on 12th century because (a) it\u2019s my favorite and (b) it\u2019s juuuuuust before a lot of common ingredients in modern Japanese cooking arrive, making it a little more different than, say, Edo period or even Muromachi cooking.\n\nI won\u2019t claim super-accuracy or anything, but my goal was to stick to techniques and ingredients that *would* have been available at the time. Basically, I set my flavor palette and then cooked within that. So that means:\n\n* Steaming? \u2705\n* Boiling? \u2705\n* Grilling?\u2705\u3000\u3000\n* Saut\u00e9ing? \u274c\n* Deep frying? \u274c\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\n\nThis time period is before the arrival of modern-type soy sauce. Instead, there are references to something called hishio, which could be a lot of things, but in some cases seemed to refer to a fermented fish sauce. So to stand in for that, I used ishiru, a very simple squid-based sauce. (Ishiru was a major find for me \u2014 it is super-delicious and easy to use.)\n\nMiso is also sliiiiiiiiightly out of time frame and started off expensive and reserved for aristocrats, so I skipped it, and of course sugar is right out.\n\nAristocrats ate white rice, but the bushi class seems to have eaten mainly Genmai brown rice. As a result, aristocrats were prone to lifestyle diseases, including thiamine deficiency (Also called beri beri, or kakke in Japanese), and the bushi class were relatively healthier. This is the time period when proto-onigiri appear.\n\nVery little farmed meat in this time period \u2014 no domesticated pigs, and cows and horses were too valuable for farming to kill for food. The aristocrat class tended to be Buddhist and thus not eat meat as well. The bushi class hunted and ate game, but that was trickier for me to get hold of, so I stuck to fish.\n\nI wanted a green veg in there, but the common leafy greens now (komatsuna, spinach, et. al.) don\u2019t arrive until later. I thought about using something like daikon greens, but opted for kogomi, a wild mountain vegetable that is just coming into season.\n\nThe sesame paste is borderline for this time period \u2014 suribachi *start* showing up from China around now (and will later help in the development of modern miso soup \u2014 early miso was chunky, with the soy beans\u2019 form more retained, rather than a paste).\n\nThis is too many dishes to be a typical bushi meal, but it was fun cooking and I needed to use up that burdock root and satoimo, and I got kind of carried away.\n\nIncidentally, there\u2019s a Tales of the Heike program on at the moment, and the most recent episode finished with the untimely death of (spoilers for a 800 year old medieval epic) Taira no Shigemori. I looked up what his cause of death may have been, and common ideas are cancer or stomach ulcers. But it\u2019s also possible that he had the thiamine deficiency mentioned above. So enjoy some brown rice in memory of Shigemori\u301c", "Japanese food looks better than European Medieval food, confirmed.", "Wow, that looks beautiful!", "Your attention to detail is incredible.", "This is awesome!

The mustard gin was home infused of 50g yellow mustard seed to 12oz of gin (used kirkland because I wasn't sure how it would come out). I ended up waiting about 5 days where it had a little spice and a nice mustard flavor but not too much. Ok here we go trying to explain these.\n\nRight: Fairly classic tartare with dijon, cornichons, capers, onion, mayonnaise, ketchup, olive oil, worcestershire, and used a little chopped chilies. Topped with chives and an egg cured for 2 hours in worcestershire.  Served with puff pastry that had been rolled thin and brushed with a dijon and egg wash. For the drink it was a basic Tom Collins style with lemon and simple using the Mustard Gin.\n\nMiddle: Korean style \uc721\ud68c (yukhoe) with chopped pear, soy sauce, sugar, garlic, sesame oil, and a little gochujang. Topped with an egg yolk that had been soy sauce cured for a few hours. Served with pickled mustard seeds (momofuku recipe) and perilla leaf. The drink was from the Maille website ([here](https://us.maille.com/blogs/recipes/maille-punch-cocktail?_pos=2&_sid=70c61ba95&_ss=r))  with gin, lime, peach brandy, honey, and dijon mustard.

Added things until I was happy with the taste. Then topped with chives and grated hard cured egg yolk (cured in a salt and crushed chile mix). Served with dumpling wrappers that had been baked with a little oil and crushed mustard seeds on top. The drink was based on [this](https://edibleeastbay.com/2022/02/23/two-mustard-seed-cocktails/) drink that I found called The Sandwich. I used 2oz of the mustard seed gin, a light 1/2 oz of Suze, and a few dashes of celery dandelion bitters. \n\nOverall I was extremely happy with all of the results.

Honestly this was my magnum opus, everything was so good!\n\nStarter - Arancini made with leftover pumpkin risotto which I had also added licorice powder to on a suggestion from /u/mentaina which was phenomenal!\n\nSoup - Sopa de arroz (Colombian style) which was a sort of fail but a delicious one. I used [this recipe](https://www.colombia.com/gastronomia/recetas-colombianas/sopa-de-arroz-r1160) but without the meat, and I made it the day before I put everything together. Once it was finished cooking, I served myself a bowl and sat down in front of the TV. When I came back half an hour later, I realised I had left it simmering and it turned into more of a congee which was then exacerbated by keeping it overnight. Oh well...\n\nMain course - Jollof rice which I made from [this recipe](https://zenaskitchen.com/my-mums-jollof-rice/). I always assumed jollof rice was really difficult to make for some reason, but actually it was quite easy and so so good! I couldn't get my hands on scotch bonnets so I used some jalapeno and chilies from my garden.\n\nSide dish - Yalanc\u0131 dolma, grape leaves stuffed with a rice mixture. I used [this recipe](https://www.carolinescooking.com/turkish-stuffed-grape-leaves-yalanci-dolma/) and it took a lot of attempts to get a roll that stuck together, but eventually I got some passable ones. Also delicious!\n\nDrink - Miki, a fermented rice beverage from Okinawa. You make it by mixing rice and sweet potatoes together and then letting it ferment on your counter. It's very healthy and refreshing! I used [this video recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7wn5TFtFF8) in making it.\n\nDessert - Sweet potato butter mochi from [this recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/butter-mochi/) with some purple sweet potato powder added to it. And horchata flavoured rice cream using the base of [this recipe](https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/rice-ice-cream/) but heating the milk mixture with some cinnamon first and I added some xanthan gum as well.

Wrap with 1/2 slice thin bacon, secure with toothpick and grill.\nI made a quick ranch dressing to go with it and tone down the spice a little", "So it may sound weird, but I use the autopsy cut when it comes to stuffing peppers the size of jalapenos or smaller. It allows for the greatest stuffing volume, and you dont waste any part of the pepper unless you throw the seeds away. Wrap the whole thing with bacon and then toothpick. Baking is fine, wood grilling is good, but deep frying stuffed jalapenos can't be beat. If you deep fry with the cutting method I proposed you will be peachy, cutting like your picture will cause the cheese to seep out. Yours is perfect for baking though, it will crisp the cheese a little too."]}

Yes, I'm aware it's a flower; just go with it.\n\nThe sunflower was not the technique I chose for this week; the pasta was. But the sunflower took me a lot of time to figure out and I wanted to create this post to document it for myself and others to follow in future.\n\nPasta: As mentioned, this was the technique I've been putting off trying for years now. I've had a manual pasta roller sitting around unused for years now. Pasta recipe from  [https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/silk-handkerchiefs-recipe](https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/silk-handkerchiefs-recipe) because it looked so good in a YT video. The pasta was much easier than I expected but also super annoying for one person to do with a manual roller. The filling was the sunflower chopped up finely in the mini food processor  (the knife alone wasn't doing it) and some chevre. Cooked it in cream, initially intending to take it further to let the sauce break into a browned butter sauce, but we were too hungry to wait for that. Really enjoyed this; must repeat it (after I get a pasta roller for the stand mixer).\n\nThe giant sunflower head!\n\nI grew it from a seed to over 2m tall and I am childishly pleased with how well it turned out. I have a ridiculous number of photos of that sunflower on my phone. I knew I wanted to eat it once it started flowering and spent a lot of time trying to find good recipes/methods online, which proved surprisingly difficult. So I kind of winged it based on everything I read and common sense. Long explanation to follow!\n\nCut it down as soon as the flowers (the centre bit, not the big yellow petals) were almost all fully unfurled, as I read that you need to catch it early to ensure it remains tender and not woody. Picked off all of the yellow petals, then pried off the green bit at the back (phyllaries, not sepals, as it turns out) so the tender white of the head was exposed. Then soaked it with a halved lemon and pulled off the flowers, which is what you see happening in the second photo. Then I rubbed it all over with salted butter, put some dry spices on and wrapped in heavy foil. This went onto the grill and when it seemed tender and cooked through (pic 3) took it out of the foil and put it directly onto the grill to get some colour. Then it was ready to serve.\n\nI did not bite into the whole head like all of the videos show. Cut into it (pic 4) and then into wedges or slices for everyone. Served it with an elotes-esque sauce. It was quite interesting. Somewhere between sweetcorn and artichoke in flavour. The... ok, I don't know the words for this, but the bits in between the bits that look like sweetcorn kernels on the top taste like the bits left on the ear when you've eaten the corn kernels.\n\nWe did not finish the whole head the first day. It was really large and we had a lot of other things off the grill. It kept well in the fridge for a good few days and I did use it in other ways, including sliced on a pizza which I would highly recommend. I had also tossed a chunk into the freezer which is what I used for the pasta.\n\nThe child continues to refuse to eat pasta in all its forms. Did try a bite of the sunflower and stopped there.\n\nAbout my meta: I'm trying to re-introduce a taste for vegetables into the child's life. I'm doing that by spending 10 to 30 days incorporating the chosen vegetable into at least 1 meal a day. It will be a mix of prominent and incorporated/barely noticeable in the dish. The aim is to get the child to eat the vegetable and acknowledge liking it.", "Oh wow, this is amazing. I didnt even know this was a thing.", "Super duper cool tbh!

The only major tweaks were swapping imported olive oil to a local vegetable oil - in a dish with this many bold flavours, it's barely noticeable - and replacing lemon juice with apple cider vinegar. I also followed Ottolenghi's suggestion to substitute Turkish pepper paste - Aleppo pepper and tomato puree. This worked well, although I'd probably add more pepper next time, just because I love some spice. \n\nI should have substituted the pine nuts for sunflower seeds, as they are impossible to buy from a British source. However, they're a favourite treat and I decided that a few Italian pine nuts (rather than Russian or Chinese, the most common countries of origin) would be a reasonable compromise this time. \n\nHaving put the dish together, I knew I'd be left with a pile of delicious cauliflower greens and a gozleme inspired dish seemed like a good option to round the meal out. I used some of Huge Fernley Whittingstall's magic bread dough that I keep in the freezer, slowly defrosted in the fridge to allow it develop its flavour profile - a bit unorthodox but a practical choice. I make it with British wheat and vegetable oil. The filling is made from saut\u00e9ed onion (done at the same time as the cauliflower onion to reduce fuel use), cubed potatoes, garlic, the cauliflower greens and a handful of kale as well as a good pinch of salt. Once assembled and sprayed with a little vegetable oil, they were baked on a pizza stone while the cauliflower roasted, once again saving cooking fuel. These don't look very authentic and should really have been pan fried but they were savoury, tasty and filling, especially dipped in some of the pepper sauce left over from the cauliflower dish. \n\n**Total per serving 1190g CO2e. The CO2e per serving is equivalent to driving 3.99 miles in an average UK petrol car. Replacing the potatoes with the same weight of  European beef would increase the emissions per serving to 2885g CO2e. The CO2e per serving would equivalent to driving 9.68 miles in an average UK petrol car.** A very small (75g) portion of beef would more than double the carbon emissions from this meal. While beef and potatoes aren't nutritionally equivalent, I could have used beans, tofu or seitan and had much the same result. \n\n*A Lot of Words About My Meta:*\n\nOur world is in crisis - we face the prospect of catastrophic climate change and we are poisoning the ecosystem on which we all depend for survival. The political has to become personal and we should all be making efforts to change. While businesses might be responsible for the majority of emissions, they're doing that in response to consumer demand, so we need to step up and demand sustainable practices.\n\nMeat and dairy cause the majority of the carbon dioxide emissions from the human diet so this meta theme might seem like cheating for a vegan. However, I believe we can always to better. \n\nI always try to menu plan to use local, seasonal vegetables as the basis of our diet but now I'll be focusing in on other imported or highly processed foods too: if a recipe calls for citrus juice (always imported in my country), can it be replaced with a locally produced acid, such as vinegar? Can I replace the coconut milk in my recipe with a homemade hazel, pea or oat cream? What ingredients can I forage, since wild ingredients typically have the lowest carbon footprint? With limited space and skill, I'll try to grow some of my own foods too - at least herbs.\n\nWhere possible, I'll be using fresh food over processed and following the advice from Lowly Food, who has a nice [write up on the low carbon diet](https://www.lowlyfood.com/what-is-the-low-carbon-diet/).  I'll also be calculating the carbon value of each meal to better understand the impacts of my choices. It's not going to be exact but I hope to learn more about how I can make the most ethical choices. \n\nAlong with carbon, I'll try to think about water usage, soil health and biodiversity. That might mean swapping rice for millet (a far less water intensive grain), or using hazelnuts and sunflower seeds instead of cashews and almonds.\n\nThe aim here is to understand how I can make our everyday diet more sustainable and to share those findings with anyone who is interested.", "I think what you're doing is admirable. Just be careful with the foraging. It may have made sense in a time when there were plenty of wild spaces, but now, where most of us live in urban environments and wild spaces are shrinking and ever under threat, it's important to protect the biodiversity of these spaces. Foraging has the potential to degrade these precious places in ways we don't yet understand.", "Love me some Ottolenghi! Looks delicious", "That is all just gorgeous.

I thought I was sooo clever, seeking out specifically whiter pumpkin seeds, sure that I wouldn't get a green marzipan like hers; turns out pumpkin seeds just really wanna be green if you  blend them up. The \"white\" parts of the Substitute (cheeks, tummy) are the undyed colour of the marzipan. It only looks less green in comparison because I dyed the rest extra green.\n\nThis was very tasty; the artificial almond essence I used made it taste pretty much just like marzipan, and I really liked the depth of flavour the pumpkin seeds added. I missed the note about using less aquafaba so mine was a bit too sticky and got a bit droopy, but as a marzipan for eating purposes, this would work great. As a marzipan for decorative purposes, it's a bit limited; you don't get fully uniform colours and you're starting with a slightly green base. But it has inspired me to keep experimenting with the idea since it just means I'll have to keep eating marzipan until I get it right :)\n\nP.S.

Even then, I was chucking the dough in the fridge almost every 5 minutes and it was stickier than ideal.\n\nI had only two goals: to get a flaky crust and to achieve robust structural integrity. I didn\u2019t roll the dough out thin enough which resulted in a denser bottom crust but the walls of the crust were very flaky! The crust was also strong enough that I really could have tossed it like a frisbess had the impulsive thoughts overpowered me. I\u2019d say these results makes this a success!\n\nThis durian cream pie is meant to be served frozen and is a dupe of a pie from [Casa Luisa](https://casaluisa.ph), a restaurant in Laguna which is a province south of the capital of the Philippines. The rest of the components took several days to make which made this an even more challenging dish. The only part that was easy was procuring the durian as my in-laws had just brought some frozen ones from Davao, the durian capital of the country.\n\nI\u2019m largely indifferent to durian. I\u2019ll eat it if it\u2019s there but I never look for it (quite the opposite of my partner who constantly craves it). When frozen, the fruit\u2019s flavor and smell mellows. The oniony notes go away and you\u2019re left with a subtly floral and sweet flavor. In this dish, the semifreddo and whipped cream marries beautifully with the custardy fruit. The smoky flavor and crunch of the puffed rice and caramelized white chocolate provides a nice contrast to the richness.\n\nI would absolutely make this again. I\u2019ve also overcome my fear of pie crust enough that I\u2019m already planning on other pies to make! One day I will get over my fear of viennoiserie and laminating sourdough inclusions. Until then, flaky pies it is!\n\n[Meta explanation and list of posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/NWCIKEjGTD)", "this is beautiful and sounds delicious!", "Once again you\u2019re killing it with the high-cuisine Filipino dishes and beautiful photography.

The combo consists of a choice of two sides (the most common are fries, home fries, baked beans, or mac salad) and two servings of a protein (hotdogs, burgers, cheeseburgers, etc), and then \"the garbage\", all made to order choices: onions, ketchup, mustard, and Rochester's other signature, beef based tomato hot sauce. It's the perfect drunk-night-out meal, and a hots place is usually where people end up to get a plate after a night of bar hopping. Did I mention the plate also comes with bread and butter? Gotta soak up that booze.\n\nThe Plate is now everywhere and goes by a million names with a million variations, including poutine versions, vegetarian/vegan options, and fancy specialties. Every Rochesterian has their favorite plates place, their favorite order options, and we like to fight about it (we like to fight about a lot of things). My personal order? Home fries and mac salad, cheeseburgers, no onions, no hot sauce, yes ketchup and mustard, and lots of both.\n\nI get razzed a lot for not liking Rochester hot sauce. It's VERY spicy and greasy, and the kind of spice I especially don't like - the kind that's just painful with no real flavor, and gets worse and worse the more you eat. BUT, this is local specialty week so I couldn't make a plate without it. I found a recipe from Home In The Fingerlakes and honestly it's great - my spice level was 1/2 t cayenne and 1/2 t chili powder, half of what the recipe calls for. It also has great flavor and isn't too greasy. \n\nI also decided to feature another classic local specialty, white hots - a sausage made of uncured and unsmoked pork, beef, and veal. I browned them in butter and then hit them with a local pale ale from Roc Brewing to finish them off.\n\nHot Sauce: https://homeinthefingerlakes.com/rochester-hot-sauce/", "Did I also mention that Rochester was just ranked the 4th best city in the country for foodies?\n\nhttps://www.rochesterfirst.com/food-and-drink/rochester-ranked-4th-best-city-in-the-nation-for-foodies/", "My husband grew up in Rochester, and I have to admit, garbage plates never really did it for me.

Thanks to a little encouragement from u/joross31, I'm going for my first meta.\n\nFor posterity, I will be completing a pop culture theme. Each dish will try to reference something from popular culture... Movies, TV shows, Internet memes, fads, etc. Anything goes. I am not always [hip with the kids these days](https://media4.giphy.com/media/JTzPN5kkobFv7X0zPJ/giphy.gif?cid=6c09b952vyj7ntn6r6uq6a648jsyda877owwijnsyo35pc1a&ep=v1_internal_gif_by_id&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g), but I'll call it a win if it makes sense after [a little explanation](https://youtu.be/Nt7Cr6X2sDs?si=QEKw2wU8G_7pLOvT). Here's to some laughs in 2025.", "Proud to announce this year's Meta will be \"actually do the challenge\" =p\n\nStill going through past ones on an old account", "A technique I'm intimidated by?? But I'm intimidated by those!", "Wish me luck, I'm trying my hand at macarons this week. I'm preparing for a fail post lol", "Unfortunately, I knew I probably wouldn\u2019t do all of this year\u2019s challenges. I did every challenge last year, which was my goal. However, due to expense, it\u2019s not feasible for me to complete every challenge indefinitely. Since I\u2019ve achieved my one year goal, I will allow myself to slow down & participate intermittently.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve missed week 3, stretching, which is disappointing because I found an online recipe that I really wanted to try: blue cheese gnocchi with dark ale gingerbread. I would\u2019ve done a non-alcoholic version, but it sounded tasty. I just posted week 4, as I\u2019m behind (but still within the three week limit).\n\nI think this is a great group / challenge. I plan to participate in & post some 2025 challenges. If I have the ingredients on hand or plan to purchase them, I will be more likely to participate. However, I might occasionally do other challenges. Eventually, I might complete some skipped prompts, as well, though I won\u2019t be able to publish those in the group. I will try to follow what others are doing, regardless of my direct participation.\n\nAs for the past year: I loved the novelty & learning experience of making something new frequently. I enjoyed participating in the variety of prompts, as well as seeing what others created. I was able to make dishes that I\u2019d planned on trying for ages! I was also able to learn about new dishes & try things that I\u2019d never heard of before.\u00a0\n\nWhile part of me doesn\u2019t like letting any of the prompts go undone, I think there will be some benefits to slowing down temporarily. While I benefitted from the deadlines, as they motivated me, slowing down allows me to avoid feeling pressured if I\u2019m sick, busy, etc. I have a few medical procedures that I need this year, including an already completed surgery. I\u2019m also looking at attending some events out of the area. Plus, I\u2019m hoping to return to work, which means that I\u2019ll have less free time.\n\nSlowing down might allow me to remake more of the recipes that I loved, as well. I found that I didn\u2019t remake as many recipes as I would have otherwise because I was so busy making new things. Trying so many new dishes was great, & I hope to continue, but I also want to take time to remake some of our favorites. Finally, while I love trying culturally & regionally diverse dishes, & want to continue exploring that, I\u2019m also hoping to learn some more home / family / regional recipes.\u00a0I might do a full year of weekly prompts again sometime in the future.", "While I love this challenge, I will admit that it's been hard for me personally to work it into my eating/macro goals over the past couple of years. So, while everyone is here declaring their metas, I want to tentatively say that for 2025 I'm going with the meta \"Soup or Salad\". (I did consider \"Super Salad\" but I thought people might be confused when I posted soup.) I love both of those foods, but they're also things I find easy to fit into my nutritional goals, whilst still being tasty and varied and not explicitly \"diet food\". Some weeks I will be looking up soup or salad recipes from the start and other weeks I will be turning things into soups or salads myself ;) Maybe I'll find this meta too restrictive and end up dropping it, but I'm gonna give it a red hot shot.\n\nAnd I'm going to state it for the record now: Stew is soup.", "I come back to this challenge year after year but never make it past a few weeks because February is the worst.

I mostly mustered up the courage to join because of the community on Discord!\n\nTo keep myself from getting overwhelmed by possible ideas (I am very much OOOOH SHINY to a point where everything is shiny and nothing ends up getting done), I'm going to adopt a Filipino meta for my first year. Since cooking and baking are my primary outlets for creativity, I try to make pretty diverse stuff for my partner and I. However, I\u2019ve noticed that because I tend to seek out dishes from other cuisines, I don\u2019t really make a lot of Filipino (or Filipino inspired) food. I\u2019m hoping to amend that with this challenge by making dishes that aren\u2019t as popular outside the Philippines (so most likely no adobo from me this year), using Filipino ingredients to make non-Pinoy food, or adding twists to popular Filipino dishes.\n\n* [Week 1: Jacques P\u00e9pin - Mollet Eggs Florentine with kangkong, all-purpose cream, and queso de bola - A fun fail!\u00a0](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/DbW5es2Djv)\n* [Week 2: Scottish - Betamax Scotch Eggs](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/AQp5o2XZVe)\n* [Week 3: Stretching - Malasimbo Kesong Puti Sandwich](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/Z0OYkosvgK)\n* [Week 4: Cruciferous - Fermented Mustard Greens, Red Radish, Tomatoes, and Salted Duck Eggs/Ensaladang Burong Mustasa, Pulang Labanos, Kamatis, at Itlog na Pula](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/yPFMLiAPNK)\n* [Week 5: Aotearoa - Spaghetti Toastie on Monay and Malabon on Puto](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/onfClZPDLl)\n* [Week 6: A Technique You\u2019re Intimidated By - Lamination - White Chocolate Semifreddo Durian Cream Pie with Caramelized White Chocolate and Puffed Rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1j2igrm/week_6_a_technique_youre_intimidated_by/)\n* [Week 7: Yoghurt - Buko Pandan, Roasted Mango Graham, and Cantaloupe Ice Candy](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1j39qgl/week_7_yoghurt_buko_pandan_roasted_mango_graham/)\n* [Week 8: Animated - The Lion King Sapin-Sapin (Steamed Layered Rice Cake) Grubs](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1jabqec/week_8_animated_the_lion_king_sapinsapin_steamed/)\n* [Week 9: Caramelizing - Latik Bisaya at Latik Tagalog sa Suman Lihiya/Yakap (Coconut Caramel Syrup and Caramelized Coconut Curd on Glutinous Rice Cakes with Lye/Hugging Glutinous Rice Cakes)](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1jckrrx/week_9_caramelizing_latik_bisaya_at_latik_tagalog/)\n* [Week 10: Rice - Sinangag sa Bagoong (Fried Rice in Fermented Shrimp Paste) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1je47n6/week_10_rice_sinangag_sa_bagoong_fried_rice_in/)\n* [Week 11: Nostalgia - Suam a Mais ampung P\u00e1ro't Bulung Sili or Glutinous White Corn Soup with Shrimp and Bird\u2019s Eye Chili Leaves ](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1jv2g8g/week_11_nostalgia_suam_a_mais_ampung_p\u00e1rot_bulung/)\n* [Week 12: Tanzanian - Inasal na Kuku Paka or Bacolod-Style Chargrilled Chicken in Tanzanian Coconut Sauce](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k0hf9c/week_12_tanzanian_inasal_na_kuku_paka_or/)\n* [Week 13: Homemade Pasta - Maria Clara and Balintawak Filipiniana Udon with Toyo-Kalamansi-Tanglad-Bagoong Sawsawan or Dipping Sauce](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k5bpe6/week_13_homemade_pasta_maria_clara_and_balintawak/)\n* [Week 14: DINOSAURS - Jurassic Crispy Pata (Deep fried pork hind leg)](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k9yl2j/week_14_dinosaurs_jurassic_crispy_pata_deep_fried/)\n* [Week 15: Puerto Rican - Tembleque Maja Blanca Sunflowers ](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1kanjkm/week_15_puerto_rican_tembleque_maja_blanca/)\n* Week 16: Battered\n* Week 17: On Sale\n* Week 18: Taiwanese\n* Week 19: Tempering\n* Week 20: Lemons and Limes\n* Week 21:\n* Week 22: Pickling", "Week 3: Stretching\n\nDoes cooking while stretching it till the payday count?", "My face upon seeing on Discord that Week 19 is 'Tempering': \ud83d\ude31 [(For context)](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1il87oa/week_6_a_technique_youre_intimidated_by_tempering/) \n\nOn the bright side, maybe this can be my redemption arc!", "Aotearoa ~ New Zealand, saved you one Google", "Cheers to year 9 of this cooking challenge! \ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf7b\n\nMy hubs and I have been participating together since we married!

If there is a Caesar, I will always order it. When I saw a recipe for Win Son\u2019s Golden Sesame Caesar Salad, I knew I\u2019d be planning my meal around that.

The chicken wings marinate in a buttermilk, scallion, and 5-spice (and many other ingredients) mixture before being dredged in flour, sweet potato starch, and corn starch. After a quick fry, they\u2019re doused in a sticky-sweet-earthy imperial sauce and scallions. \n\nAnd then a sandwich because why not? I made milk buns and folded in some scallions, then packed them with homemade shrimp cakes, a fluffy nest of pork floss, and Win Son\u2019s zippy Ginger Deluxe Sauce.

During this journey, her father takes a shortcut through the mountains. The family stops in front of a tunnel that leads to an abandoned resort town. Chihiro's mom insists they explore it. Chihiro is not up for this, but her parents are not listening. They come upon an empty restaurant that has a feast laid out and waiting. Wasting no time, Chihiro's parents sit down to eat. Chihiro continues to explore the town and meets Haku. He warns Chihiro to leave and cross before sundown. As the sun begins to set, spirits appear in the town. Chihiro races to find her parents, but finds they have been turned into pigs. The river has flooded over and she cannot cross. Chihiro is trapped in the spirit world. \n\nChihiro signs a work contract with Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse and cursed Chihiro's parents. Yubaba causes Chihiro to forget her name and renames her Sen. She must recover her real name and save her parents before she is trapped forever in the spirit world.\n\nThus begins the dramatic opening to Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece, Spirited Away. The 2001 film was the first animated, Japanese language film to win the Academy Award for best animated feature. A critical and commercial success, Spirited Away was the highest grossing Japanese film in history until it was surpassed by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Mugen Train in 2020.\n\nMiyazaki's spirit world is allegedly inspired by the town of Jiufen, Taiwan. Jiufen's winding, lantern-lined streets are built into the side of a mountain in the Ruifang District. The old gold section of town in particular has a strong resemblance to the movie. The Amei Teahouse that sits atop the summit in particular pays a striking resemblance to the bathhouse where Chihiro works.\n\nMiyazaki has come out and said publicly that Juifen is not a direct inspiration for the movie. However it has been in the pop cultural narrative for so long that you continue to find it in guide books and recent online articles. [This article](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/exploring-the-magic-of-taiwans-spirited-away-city) has some beautiful photos of Jiufen.\n\nPop culture isn't always literally true. Sometimes it's more feels than reals. So for this week, I wanted to honor Miyazaki's classic and the town that many believe to be have inspired it... even if it might not be literally true.\n\nIn the opening of the movie, Chihiro's parents sit down to a \"cursed feast\" that included many different goodies. I settled on three treats: [banquet roast Cornish game hen](https://youtu.be/8ehZVWRsuuE?si=LRXxx9bye8doRM5U), Taiwanese sausages, and the massive dumpling Chihiro's dad slurps down. According to the animator, it's supposed to be a stuffed [coelacanth stomach](https://soranews24.com/2020/09/21/studio-ghibli-animator-reveals-the-secret-food-eaten-by-chihiros-parents-in-spirited-away/). For the filling and folding, I followed [this video](https://youtu.be/rHxp3T9whvU?si=tt2ld5EQ9zJ_LbvG). I used [this recipe](https://thewoksoflife.com/har-gow/) for the dumpling skin. I did not make the sausage from scratch. I bought it from my local Asian grocery. If [Alvin from Babish](https://youtu.be/GI-w_R7CqR8?si=EZAcOMBcXh6I7-gc) bought some for his version of the cursed feast, then I can too.\n\nAll of this was really, really good. Far, far too much food for lunch for one person, but that's kind of the point. The banquet Cornish game hen was delicious. The marinade was very sweet and I would definitely make it again. If I do, I'd probably pair it with a dipping sauce of some kind to offset the sweetness. I rolled the dumpling a bit thicker than I wanted, so it didn't get as nice of a see through effect. It was unwieldy but delicious. I couldn't eat it all in one go because it was so big and couldn't quite support itself. I would make the combo again with a more traditional dumpling shape. The sausages were great. I wouldn't have had anywhere near as good a result as if I had made them. They were a nice offset to the other dishes that were very sweet.\n\nPop culture meta explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/lvK8Bvj7GM)", "I love your choice of inspiration and the execution. It all looks and sounds delicious!", "This is fantastic! I love how moody this photo is. It really goes well with the cursed theme. Also, I love Ghibli films (though my favorite one is Totoro) so this was all really nice to learn! I had no idea Spirited Away was inspired by Jiufen!

I decided to cook four dishes that intrigued me or appealed to me the most, and seemed doable at home. Unfortunately, I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to make possibly the best named food I\u2019ve ever come across: Dachang Bao Xiaochang (\u5927\u8178\u5305\u5c0f\u8178) which translates as Small Sausage in Large Sausage as it was just too much work, but I decided to go with:\n\n- [ba wan \u8089\u5713](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0043/4490/5828/files/Crystal_Meatball.pdf?v=1695218423): crystal skin dumplings\n- [yan su ji \u9e79\u9165\u96de](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/taiwanese-salt-and-pepper-chicken-yan-su-ji/): Taiwanese popcorn chicken\n- [zhu xie gao \u8c6c\u8840\u7cd5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjN7hYi6xKA&pp=ygUVcGlnIGJsb29kIGNha2UgcmVjaXBl0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv): pig blood cake\n- [tie dan \u9435\u86cb](https://www.thehongkongcookery.com/2022/01/chinese-iron-eggs.html): iron eggs\n- [Haishan sauce \u6d77\u5c71\u91ac](https://yunhai.shop/blogs/recipes/oyster-omelets-%E8%9A%B5%E4%BB%94%E7%85%8E?srsltid=AfmBOopcGqSNsyyzIADv_rFtyyr8GFFLzu5USTNfxn0nqHKW4EbgtQQe)\n- [garlic thick soy sauce \u849c\u84c9\u91ac\u6cb9\u818f](https://cookinginchinglish.com/taiwanese-thick-soy-sauce/)\n\nThe ba wan were the most complicated as they involved making a dough out rice flour, sweet potato starch, tapioca starch and water as well as a pork filling. The dough is really sticky so the recipe recommends using small bowls to first spread a thin layer of dough into, then scoop a ball of filling, then seal with more dough. This did work well but I didn't quite grease the bowls properly so not all of my dumplings came out well. These are often served with coriander and the Haishan and garlic thick soy sauce. These were absolutely delicious and even the ones that didn't look so pretty still tasted great. \n\nI chose the pig blood cake because that was pretty far out of my comfort zone and I do really love black pudding. It's only made with pig blood, glutinous rice and salt, which is then steamed. I really doubted it would work out but it set up perfectly! Traditionally these are dipped into peanut powder and coriander. I really enjoyed these, reminiscent of black pudding but with a much bouncier texture.\n\nThe popcorn chicken were very much in my comfort zone, and I particularly liked this recipe. The marinade gave the chicken so much flavour, and the sweet potato starch gave a really crunchy coating. This has deep fried basil leaves which went unexpectedly really well with the chicken, although I definitely added way too many into my deep frying oil at once, it nearly bubbled over and terrified myself! \n\nThe iron eggs are similar to other soy-marinated eggs, except you simmer and cool the eggs multiple times which makes the eggs shrink and changes the texture. Supposedly this dish was invented when a vendor hadn't sold the eggs from the previous day, so she had to continually reheat them. These were the only miss of this meal, they were too salty for me and I much prefer a softer yolk.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/c0u8kxbgd0ye1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1746034650.0, "score": 79, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1kbmfvw/week_18_taiwanese_night_market_ba_wan_\u8089\u5713_yan_su/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Your dishes look great!

Specifically her scallion sauce is one of the best things I've ever had. So for this week, I made a noodle dish using as many kai dong ingredients that I had. \n\nCooked down shitake mushrooms and some baby bok choy. Browned some pork. Combined the three kai dong sauces - scallion sauce (3 tbsp), shallot oil (1 tbsp) and mamas chili crisp (1-2 tsp) and added the freshly boiled kai dong noodles. Got the noodles good and saucey before adding in all my fixings. One of my favorite meals, I do make this all the time on weekdays for a quick meal. Happy with this week =]"]}

Enter: Puerto Rico\u2019s Tembleque (coconut pudding) married with the Philippines\u2019 Maja Blanca (coconut and milk pudding).\n\nThe two dishes use almost the same ingredients. Tembleque calls for coconut milk or cream, cornstarch, sugar, cinnamon, and sometimes vanilla. Maja blanca uses similar ingredients but skips the cinnamon and vanilla in favor of corn kernels, grated cheese, and dairy milk\u2014usually cow\u2019s milk or gatas ng kalabaw (carabao/water buffalo milk). These small differences in ingredients and ratios lead to distinct results: tembleque is soft and silky, almost like panna cotta, while maja blanca is firmer, denser, and a touch savory from the corn and cheese.\n\nMy goal was to lean tembleque in flavor, add the corn and cheese from maja blanca, and land the texture somewhere in between. I was mostly successful\u2014except I goofed the ratios and ended up with a more tembleque-like texture. Honestly? I preferred it that way. I\u2019ve never liked the texture of maja blanca. My apologies to any maja blanca stans in the house, but in my opinion, it\u2019s inferior to another Filipino milk pudding called tibok-tibok, which melts on the tongue like a dream. I could also be biased because tibok-tibok is from my hometown but to each their own (milk pudding). Anyway! This tembleque is no tibok-tibok, but its silkiness puts it in a league of its own.\n\nThe real surprise? How beautifully the corn and cheese paired with the cinnamon powder. It was cozy, lightly spiced, and incredibly soothing. Using sunflower molds made the whole thing even more delightful. I loved this dish so much\u2014and it got so many rave reviews\u2014that I\u2019m already planning to make it again for Mother\u2019s Day.\n\n10/10 will tembleque again.\n\n[Meta explanation and list of posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/NWCIKEjGTD)", "Love the plating!

But the crispy pata? That\u2019s still here, and it\u2019s *delicious*. Golden, crunchy, shattering skin? Check. Tender, juicy meat? You bet. Proportions so big they could have belonged to a T. rex? Done and dusted (with \u201cmeteor ash\u201d).\n\nAs soon as the DINOSAURS theme was announced, my partner latched on to the idea of crispy pata [pah-tah] looking like a dinosaur leg/arm. This was the first time they requested something for a challenge, so I had to indulge them\u2014despite my fear of deep frying and general ineptitude with any kind of frying (my brain just finds it so boring so I\u2019m always burning things).\n\nOften served during special occasions, crispy pata is a two-day process. The day before, you boil the whole hind leg for about an hour to an hour and a half\u2014enough to cook the pork through but not so much that the skin and meat fall off the bone. It\u2019s then placed on a wire rack to cool before being pierced all over, liberally salted, and placed uncovered in the fridge to dry out overnight. The next day, you heat up a vat of oil, ask the group chat to wish you luck, gently lower the massive leg into it, try to cover it with a lid like the recipes say, but instead, you run away shrieking out of the room, calling for your partner because it\u2019s bubbling over way too much like a witch\u2019s cauldron. Anyway, after both you and the oil have calmed down, wait about 15 minutes before bracing yourself and flipping the pata over. After another 15 minutes, you\u2019re done.\n\nThe best crispy pata I\u2019ve ever had was so crispy and tender you could cut into it with a popsicle stick. While this was not that crispy pata, it was still really good! Crackling skin, melt-in-your-mouth fat, and tender meat. This paired with a vinegary sawsawan [dip] full of chopped red onions and a bit of heat from bird\u2019s eye chili is just \ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c\ud83e\udd0c.\n\nI won\u2019t be making this again any time soon (my partner says I\u2019ve made it twice before, but I have zero recollection of that, so I think deep frying really is traumatic enough for me to have blocked those memories out lol). But I\u2019m so pleased with how the pata turned out. We also had so much fun making this and kept laughing while staging the photo, randomly going \u201cIN A WORLD\u2026\u201d like movie narrators.\n\nBonus trivia no one asked for: We originally titled this photo \u201cLast Leg Standing: We honor our fallen kin with crispy skin\u201d and really wanted to play up the silliness of all this. Those two charred marble potatoes in the foreground are supposed to be the Porkasaurus Rex\u2019s eggs that it refused to leave behind, even as the meteor fell.

Baby spinach was on sale for $1.99 for a bag, so I grabbed one of those too. As I left the store I was imagining making something along the lines of a stuffed spinach fried chicken. After making the filling (sauteed onions, spinach, sundried tomatoes mashed with some goat cheese) and lightly pan frying the chicken I realized people probably stuff and bake *raw* chicken, which I did not do.

This step isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but it helps to remove the weird taste that shelf stable heart of palm can have.\n\nI then lightly browned some cubed ham and broccoli before adding water. To create the sauce, I added a mixture of grated parmagiano and mozzarella and emulsified it into the water with sodium citrate. I finished it with lots of black pepper.\n\nI definitely enjoyed this one. I\u2019ve used sodium citrate quite a bit and I\u2019m a huge fan of it.

This means one thing in the town of South Park... Black Friday. The day after Thanksgiving marks the unofficial start of the shopping season for the Christmas season. The South Park Mall is offering an 80% discount to the first 30 people in the mall. This news is met with horror from the mall staff as previous years have been a literal blood bath. \n\nHowever, this is welcome news for Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and the rest of their friends. The new X Box One and PlayStation 4 are being released that day. If they all band together, they can be among those 30 and purchase new systems to play... But which system? The kids, who have been roleplaying a game similar to Game of Thrones, cannot agree on which system to play. Friend must battle friend to be the first to reach the mall. Discounts deepen, alliances are forged, and are friendships betrayed. [George R. R. Martin conducts a song about weiners.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO2DH1Dl1M8)\n\nThus begins South Park's three part saga of Black Friday sales and spoof of Game of Thrones. South Park is known for its smart and goofy satire, always managing to keep its finger on the pulse of pop culture. I love it. The critically acclaimed show has been running since 1997 and still manages to be fresh and insightful 26 seasons in.\n\nI do not love Game of Thrones. A cultural phenomenon in its hay day, the HBO show was everyone's darling in the early seasons... until the show's content went beyond what was written in George R. R. Martin's series \"A Song of Ice and Fire.\" In a series known for betrayals, the fan base turning on the show in its later seasons was perhaps the most shocking. The series that was so popular is now effectively erased from the cultural memory other than the ending was bad... And it was that bad. I called myself a fan until right around the introduction of the Sand Snakes and then I checked out. Its one of the few shows I hate watched. I was actively rooting for the zombies to kill everyone by the  end. They didn't, but it would have been a better ending. The books are still unfinished, but I won't read them if they actually come out. I am fully done with Westeros.\n\nAs part of their plan to be the first in the mall, the PS4 faction rents out the Red Robin restaurant, which serves as a side entrance to the mall. Red Robin is a popular US hamburger chain, which shows up several times in South Park. By this time, the XBox faction has surrendered and the two sides meet for burgers. However, the Red Robin Wedding is a ruse by the XBox faction to lock the PS4 side in the restaurant to prevent them from buying systems. So for this week, I wanted to pay tribute to South Park and its epic battle centering around the deep, deep sales of Black Friday. \n\nI made a meal loosely modeled after the one featured in the Red Robin Wedding. A burger, towering [onion rings](https://copykat.com/red-robin-onion-rings/), [campfire sauce](https://www.restlesschipotle.com/campfire-sauce/), and a basket of [double-fried steak fries](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/guy-fieri/double-fried-french-fries-recipe-1945253) seasoned with [Red Robin seasoning](https://heartscontentfarmhouse.com/red-robin-french-fry-seasoning/).\n\nIn fitting tribute to Game of Thrones, this meal was a total letdown. The burger was fine. The panko breading fell off the onion rings. The fries were soggy. The seasoning didn't quite taste like Red Robin's. The saving grace of the meal was the campfire sauce, which was fantastic and made the meal at least edible. I'll make the sauce again, but will save the rest for a visit to Red Robin.\n\nPop culture meta explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/lvK8Bvj7GM).", "Wait but who got the gaming system? Don\u2019t leave me hanging like thatttt. I know I can Google it but it is much more fun learning about pop culture from you. Also, I\u2019m sorry that you did not enjoy the meal. I do however love that the ending was as disappointing as GOT. There\u2019s something poetic in how that turned out. I hope your next one isn\u2019t a dud!", "Ugh this all looks so good.

{"title": "Week 17: On Sale - Parmesan Crusted Turkey Breast and Creamy Vodka Pasta (Meta: From My Garden)", "selftext": "Any resemblance to last week's post is purely coincidental. Ahem.\n\nEvery November for Thanksgiving my favorite grocery store (HEB) has a sale where if you buy a ham, you get an 11 pound turkey for free. Anything above 11 you pay like $1.20 a pound for. I buy an insane amount of ham for my breakfast kolaches, so I ended up with a lot of turkeys last fall! I thawed them and broke them down and refroze the pieces. This was the last of the breast meat. I treated it exactly like I would for chicken parmesan - butterflied, salted, then a coating of flour and garlic powder, then eggs, then a coating of panko, parmesan, garlic powder and parsley flakes.\n\nThe vodka pasta was new to me and is something I've wanted to try for a long time. I don't drink but I will cook with alcohol, and I had to make a stop at a liquor store to buy a small bottle of vodka. That was an amusing interaction. The reason I decided on this recipe for this week's theme (and there were so many options because I buy a lot of meat on sale) was that Brian Lagerstrom just posted a video for this sauce that uses Calabrian chilis. I bought those for a theme last year and haven't touched them since, so it was great to get some more use out of them! The pasta was awesome, if spicy (#SpiceWimp) and I will absolutely make it again!\n\nFor my meta, I harvested fresh parsley from my garden.

{"title": "Week 17: On Sale - Duck \u00e0 l'Orange", "selftext": "My local supermarket had baskets full of flowers on sale the week after Mother\u2019s Day, with loads of daffodils. I picked up three bunches, which were reduced from over \u00a312 in total to about \u00a32.50. The theme had just been announced so I hoped I could use the daffodils in some way in my dish. Unfortunately, when I came to researching it turns out that daffodils contain lycorine so are highly toxic and are absolutely not safe for consumption. After a couple of days my daffodils had all opened and looked beautiful, but I was about to go on holiday so thought about using them in a decorative way for my dish for this theme, to give them one last hurrah before they had to be binned.\n\nI found a whole duck on offer and so instantly thought of Duck \u00e0 l'Orange because I had quite a few spare oranges leftover from my citrus cake. I almost made [this Jacques P\u00e9pin recipe](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/duck-lorange) for week 1 this year, but chose something else as I couldn\u2019t find duck very cheaply, so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try this recipe out. The duck is roasted and then the recipe calls for making a duck gravy from the neck and gizzards along with some vegetables, aromatics, stock and wine. This is then added to an orange syrup with vinegar, redcurrant jelly and butter, which makes for a really shiny, deeply flavoured sauce. I decided that only using pantry ingredients (except for the duck) felt in the spirit of this theme, so I used only the vegetables I had on hand (so missed the celery and leek) as well as omitting the Grand Marnier, and served with roast potatoes and broccoli.\n\nI made a kind of floral wreath to decorate my duck and sauce, taking care not to let the daffodils touch any of the food. I really liked this dish, the sauce is sweet and savoury and pairs so well with the duck. Duck is probably my favourite meat so I\u2019m delighted to find another way to make it! \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/f1dxqwu2rkwe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745409700.0, "score": 158, "author": "Anastarfish", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1k5xdo9/week_17_on_sale_duck_\u00e0_lorange/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Wow Ana!

It\u2019s one of those recipes that\u2019s incredibly easy but feels like you put way more effort into it than you actually did.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nDinosaur Beans\n\nIngredients:  \n\t\u2022\t2 Tbsp olive oil  \n\t\u2022\t\u00bd large onion, diced  \n\t\u2022\t\u00be cup green pepper, chopped  \n\t\u2022\tPinch of salt and black pepper  \n\t\u2022\t3 large garlic cloves, minced  \n\t\u2022\t16 oz hot sausage (we usually go with Bob Evans)  \n\t\u2022\tTwo 28 oz cans of Bush\u2019s Baked Beans (original is best)  \n\t\u2022\t\u00be cup BBQ sauce (something smoky or spicy adds a nice kick)  \n\t\u2022\t1 Tbsp Creole mustard (Zatarain\u2019s if you\u2019ve got it, spicy brown works too)  \n\t\u2022\t1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar  \n\t\u2022\t1 tsp chili powder  \n\t\u2022\t\u00bd tsp Creole seasoning  \n\t\u2022\t1 Tbsp molasses  \n\n\u2e3b\n\nDirections:  \n\t1.\tHeat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high.  \n\t2.\tAdd onions and green pepper, season with salt and pepper, and saut\u00e9 until soft and lightly browned\u2014about 5 minutes.  \n\t3.\tStir in garlic and cook for another minute.  \n\t4.\tAdd the sausage, breaking it up as it browns.  \n\t5.\tOnce fully cooked, pour in the baked beans (juice and all).  \n\t6.\tStir in BBQ sauce, mustard, vinegar, chili powder, Creole seasoning, and molasses.  \n\t7.\tLet everything simmer for 5\u201310 minutes to bring the flavors together.  \n\t8.\tServe hot and enjoy.  \n\n\u2e3b\n\nSuper simple, super nostalgic, and hands-down one of our favorite things to eat with grilled anything."]}

I used about 2 cups of flour and a little less than 1 cup water, added in a pinch of salt, maybe 2 tsp of sesame oil & two full bunches of scallions. I didn't want the batter to be too thin, but I realized shortly after trying to cook them that it was def too thick. This pancake seen here was the **only** semi pretty one.

Some ideas for you:\n\n* Consider whether a food processor can grind soaked rice to a fine-enough consistency. Many Indian cooks use stone grinders or mixies which have more powerful motors than standard food processors. A vitamix-type heavy duty blender may work better.\n* There's a technique of dolloping the dosa batter with a ladle on the hot pan (cast iron works best for me), then using the bottom of the ladle to smooth the batter onto the pan in circular motions. Look up videos!\n* Do add water while grinding as needed to make a cake-batter like consistency, or a bit thinner.\n* Do add some salt while fermenting.\n* Add rice flour to dosa batter after fermenting to make crispy dosas.\n* Try making unfermented dosas!\n   * One kind is called \"adai\".\n   * Another type is instant dosas- there are various recipes for these."]}

I heated up the electric skillet outdoors to avoid all of the oil splatter that typically comes with frying. The challenging part for this dish was using a mortar and pestle to mash garlic, salt, pork rinds, and the fried plantains by hand.

Some of the comments got filtered out by Reddit's algorithms too. Maybe Reddit just be doing Reddit things today. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThe first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.\n\nThe [second rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC1yHLp9bWA) of Fight Club is you do NOT about Fight Club.\n\nWait. Back up. [Let me start earlier.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF-BYUMaGjg)\n\nFor six months, Jack couldn't sleep. With insomnia, nothing is real. Everything is far away. Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy. Jack's doctor refused to prescribe him something to help. If you want to see real pain, the doctor said, swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights and see the guys with testicular cancer... That Jack should find out what it is really like to suffer.\n\nSo he does. And in seeing those men that are losing everything... something happened.  Jack was lost in oblivion -- dark and silent and complete. Jack found freedom.  Losing all hope was freedom.\n\nThus Jack begins his journey to hitting rock bottom. Jack works as an automobile recall coordinator, and on a plane ride he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler makes and sells soap, [works as a waiter in the Pressman hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNTuR-WD6os), and a [film projectionist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1b6xTjoUlk) with questionable ideas what belongs in family films. Tyler takes Jack in after his apartment full of clever solutions for modern living goes up in flames.\n\nAnd on this quest to get Jack to give up and let that which does not matter truly slide, Tyler utters these famous words: \"I want you to hit me as hard as you can.\" Fight Club is born. A way to set aside the trappings of the consumerist and corporate lifestyle in which they find themselves and let go. No one gets to a be a special or unique snowflake. [You're not your job.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__4Yz-gwojQ)\n\nThere is more, of course. Much more. Marla Singer, the woman Jack meets at these support groups. Project Mayhem. Bob. His name is Robert Paulson. But these are the basics. It's hard to know how much to spoil in a movie that is now 26 years old, but the less you know going in the better the payoff.\n\nIt made a huge impression on me when I saw it. It is one of three movies that I turned around and brought friends to see it in theaters immediately. (The other two are [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) and [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind)). It has amazing performances by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. There are minor cameos from [Meat Loaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_Loaf) ([a toast to absent friends](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/466aa48d-0cbe-431a-9d8d-9e9e4247fee1/gif)), [Eion Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eion_Bailey) before he started playing the worst TV dad ever on [From](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_(TV_series)), and [Jared Leto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Leto) before [30 Seconds to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Seconds_to_Mars_(album)) and his questionable group [Echelon](https://vocal.media/geeks/escaping-the-cult-of-mars). It's worth seeing.\n\nAnd suddenly I realize that all of this has got something to do with a man named [Chuck Palahniuk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Palahniuk) Before there was [David Fincher's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher) movie, there was the novel. Fight Club was published in 1996 as Palahniuk's first published novel. He's written many, many more since, as a write of subversive and shocking fiction. For example, public readings of his short story \"Guts\" were allegedly so shocking that [people puked and passed out.](https://pittnews.com/article/36878/archives/palahniuk-reads-story-people-faint/) According to this [Esquire piece](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a44891150/chuck-palahniuk-fight-club-not-forever-but-for-now/), it's really about the emotional ride for the reader. Subjects that make his reader uncomfortable are the tools he uses to do that.\n\nI will say I adore the book version of Fight Club as much as I adore the film. The book's ending is ever-so-slightly different, so I'd suggest picking it up if you liked the movie. In writing this up, I learned there are also Fight Club 2 and Fight Club 3 comics that Palahniuk worked on. I haven't read those but they're on their way from my library.\n\nSo for this week, I wanted to pay tribute to the movie and books that had such an impact on my perspective in my younger years. Why Fight Club? People *batter* each other senseless.\n\nWherever Jack travels as part of his job, everything is [single serving...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1iQp8g9SQo) Single serving sugar, single serving cream, single pat of butter, etc. For lunch, he receives a \"microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.\" Cordon bleu, wild rice, steamed veggies, and a brownie on the side. I used [this recipe](https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-cordon-bleu-easy-fancy/) for the cordon bleu. My daughter helped me out with the brownies. We used u/moonjelly33's [gooey fudgy brownies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1714o53/comment/k3oly1z/).\n\nThe cordon bleu was good, but the brownies were hands down amazing. They were perfect. I can see why they went viral last year... Dark, fudgy, and a shiny crackling top. My daughter now has unrealistic expectations for baking because everything she makes will always be as perfect as these brownies. \ud83d\ude44 We will definitely make these again.\n\nI had only anticipated making one dish for this... But in showing off my daughter's brownies on the Discord, u/chizubeetpan guessed which way my post was going. u/draivun said \"Please don't make soap.\" So of course I needed to make soap to go with my first dish. This is a beautiful idea and I love how it came out. I've been working on my photography, and this looks just like an ad for Paper Street Soap. I infused chocolate with cilantro at u/Kauyon_Kais' suggestion, so that it tastes soapy to at least some folks. I thought it tasted good! I like cilantro though since I don't have the soap gene. It also looks great since the cilantro looks like those little scrubby things we all had back in the day.\n\nA ton of fun for this week. I would make it all again in a heartbeat.\n\nPop culture meta explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/lvK8Bvj7GM).", "YES! Excellent take on the theme! I love this.", "I just choked on my lunch with this interpretation. I'm obsessed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.", "Is the soap edible?

This looks and sounds amazing!", "Beautiful dish! It looks & sounds amazing!", "I looove the sound of this. Chicken inasal was one of my absolute favourite things that I made from last year's 52woc, it sounds so yummy paired with coconut!", "It was while I was researching how to do a Bicho-Bicho style Mandazi when I came across Kuku Paka. At first, I was going to make it to accompany the mandazi/bicho-bicho but when I saw some preparations that grilled the chicken after cooking in the coconut curry sauce I knew I could make a Bacolod Inasal x Kuku Paka dish.\n\nKuku Paka in itself is already a fusion dish. It was born out of culinary traditions that was heavily influenced by the maritime trade routes between East Africa, India, and the Arabian Peninsula. Most recipes have you preparing the curry sauce with cumin, coriander, turmeric, coconut milk, and sometimes potatoes, boiled eggs, and tomatoes. The chicken is cooked in this curry and sometimes grilled over charcoal after being sauced.\n\nInasal \\[in-ah-sal\\] is a style of char-grilling that Bacolod \\[Bah-koh-lodd\\] originated but that is wildly popular nationwide. There's even a fast-food chicken chain devoted to inasal. Chicken is grilled all over the Philippines but this Western Visayas city\u2019s chicken stands out because of its marinade. For a few hours, the chicken luxuriates in a mixture of calamansi, vinegar (often cane vinegar because this region\u2019s biggest crop is sugarcane), lemongrass, ginger, and garlic. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, fat is rendered from chicken skin with annatto thrown in towards the end to make an annatto chicken oil. This is used to not only baste the chicken as it grills to give it the signature orange-reddish color, many also douse steamed rice with the oil while eating the inasal.\u00a0\n\nFor this dish, I marinated the chicken in the inasal marinade plus kuku paka's coriander, turmeric, cumin, and coconut milk. While grilling the chicken, I applied the annatto oil baste every few minutes. On the stove, I cooked the Tanzanian coconut curry sauce while halved baby potatoes roasted in the oven. I did char the chicken a bit more than I intended, but otherwise this dish was so freaking good! All the flavors went so well with each other and we ended up literally licking our plates afterwards.\n\nThis was citrusy, rich, smoky and tasted so much like summer to me. It reminded me of going to the beach with family, grilling all sorts of food, eating the grilled meats with something rich and savory (often Filipino spaghetti lol), and getting sauce all over my face. The first photo in this carousel is more a tribute to the family-style eating while the second is just me wanting you all to see more of the sauce. \n\nIt took me so long to land on this dish. After [my Nostalgia week\u2019s](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/1jv2g8g/week_11_nostalgia_suam_a_mais_ampung_p%C3%A1rot_bulung/) emotionally-charged procrastination, not being able to figure out this week really had me firmly stranded in Executive Dysfunction Land. I\u2019m so glad that after agonizing over this for so long it is now going to be part of our regular rotation\u2014the highest praise a dish can get in our house!\u00a0\n\n\n[Meta explanation and list of posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/NWCIKEjGTD)", "Gorgeous! And this sounds amazing too. Adding it to my try list!", "This looks wonderful! I made chicken inasal last year and it was so good.

Predominantly of Puerto Rican descent, Lin-Manuel takes his name from the poem \"Nana Roja Para Mi Hijo Lin Manuel,\" by the Puerto Rican writer Jos\u00e9 Manuel Torres Santiago. It's a poem about the Vietnam war, and you can hear Lin-Manuel Miranda recite it in Spanish [here](https://youtu.be/_WegkkhlzeI?si=3Cd-ZgU62Idmaz-v). Tumblr isn't my favorite source, but you can read an English translation [here](https://www.tumblr.com/purelintrash/140473658451/cacafueg0-purelintrash-notes-i-didnt-find-a), along with a lovely note from the author to Lin-Manuel Miranda. A verse from this poem reads:\n\nDemocracy on this side is living through misery, shit and death every day). Knowing that one day (that is, unless you demonstrate that you don\u2019t have the patriotism and guts) \nthey\u2019ll recruit you and hand you a rifle \nto murder liberty.\n\nIt reminds me very much of the subject matter of *Hamilton: The Musical*, which brought Miranda to international renown. This isn't the only thing Miranda is known for--his Broadway debut was in 2008 with his musical *In the Heights*, which won Miranda a Tony and a Grammy--but Hamilton became a pop culture phenomenon when it debuted in 2015. It won an additional 11 Tony Awards. This means that like [Eminem that I featured in homemade pasta week](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/FWJOLVi8Ed), Miranda is one award short of the coveted EGOT status. He won Emmys for Hamilton and for [the song \"Bigger!](\nhttps://youtu.be/R8SeysuMpA0) featuring Neil Patrick Harris. But Miranda won a [MacArthur Genius Grant](https://playbill.com/article/lin-manuel-miranda-among-macarthur-genius-grant-winners-com-364593) and a [Pulitzer Prize](https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/lin-manuel-miranda), so [what is a legacy?](https://youtu.be/WlnY2AYbKu0) That is an incredible legacy from someone just getting started. It must be tough if [history has its eyes on you](https://youtu.be/ws_pklV1cP8), but [man, the man is non-stop](\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/FrYsq_f7gjM)\n\nHamilton tells the life story of Alexander Hamilton, one of America's founding fathers. We see Hamilton's rise; role in the war for independence, the Constitution and its adoption, and the US Bank; his indiscretions; and death in a duel. It has a fantastic soundtrack that is an amazing listen. It is a powerful story of a powerful man told by a masterful storyteller. \n\nYou can hear Miranda talk about the experience on the [Graham Norton Show](https://youtu.be/AH7rPkRRJZ8), including performing it for [Prince Harry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex) and [Meghan Markle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex). [King George III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III), played by [Jonathan Groff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Groff), has a minor but magical role and is Prince Harry's [6x great and 5x great grandfather.](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a22862493/how-prince-harry-related-to-george-iii-hamilton/) That could have been AWKWARD if Harry and Megan weren't big fans of the show. \ud83d\ude05", "Oh my.

It's marinaded overnight with a mixture of blended garlic, fresh oregano, salt, pepper and adobo seasoning, and then it cooks slowly at about 140\u00b0C for 5 hours before turning up high to make the cuerito - the crispy skin. I used [this recipe](https://youtu.be/1V6HIGf64bA?feature=shared) and followed a tip in the comments to wrap in parchment paper before wrapping in foil so that the foil wouldn't stick to the skin but would trap all the moisture inside during the slow cooking portion of the cooking time. \n\nTo accompany the pernil I made [arroz con gandules](https://www.delishdlites.com/occasion/holiday-recipes/arroz-con-gandules-puerto-rican-rice-with-pigeon-peas-recipe/) (rice with pigeon peas), [tostones](https://salimaskitchen.com/tostones/) (twice fried plantain) and avocado. \n\nThe meat was easily the star of the show, meltingly tender with excellent crunchy crackling. The arroz con gandules was delicious as well, packed full of flavour and texture. The pigeon peas were hard to find but I did manage to source a tin of cooked ones, they were good but I don't think I would've noticed a huge deal if I had substituted them for lentils. I really liked the dish as a whole but I did find it a bit rich. When I had leftovers I made a salad with a tangy citrus dressing which went really nicely. I'm definitely making the pork again soon.

Sweet potatoes are my go-to\u2014they caramelize when fried and adds extra crunch.\n\nFor me the perfect okoy is very crackly and crisp, never cakey. After a few soggy failures, I\u2019ve found that a mix of rice flour, potato starch, and cornstarch is the key to an okoy that shatters when you bite into it. Fritter perfection!\n\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be me if I didn\u2019t burn most of the things I fried lol. I started with ten. After chef\u2019s snacks and charred sacrifices, I was left with a grand total of three fritters. Paired with a sawsawan of chopped red onions, vinegar, and just a pinch of salt and sugar, I sat down for a satisfyingly crunchy meryenda. These might actually cure my aversion to frying. So fricking good.\n\n[Meta explanation and list of posts here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/s/NWCIKEjGTD)"]}
{"title": "Week 17: On Sale - Chicken Caesar Salad Pizza", "selftext": "The local grocery store had chicken on a pretty deep discount so I bought a couple packages.  I had romaine lettuce, anchovies, and Caesar dressing in the fridge to use up so we came up with this recipe.\n\nThe anchovies were minced and mixed with the dressing and spread on the pizza crust.  I added a layer of Italian cheese blend, sliced up cooked chicken tenders, and a bit more cheese.  I also attempted a bit of a stuffed crust which explains the pillowy edges.\n\nAfter baking, the lettuce was added.\n\nThis was pretty good but the extra anchovies were a bit overpowering.  I wanted to get them moving so I regret nothing!
