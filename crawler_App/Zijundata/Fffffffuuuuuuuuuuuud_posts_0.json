This is absolutely overwhelming. I thought you'd like it but I wasn't prepared for this! Like I'm saying below: we'll do this bigger and better in 6 months or a year. Keep uploading great recipes, and keep being awesome. EDIT: [read about what's up with that plan](http://redd.it/v7ugu)\n\n**[CHECK THIS OUT IF YOU WANT THE LATEST PDF VERSION TO PRINT YOURSELF](http://www.reddit.com/r/hungryasfuck/comments/mw4xs/free_pdfs_for_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook/).**\n\n------------\n\nFirst off, [this is what my giftee thought](http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/yes-redditgifts-two-books-not-one-two/). I'm so happy he likes it :D.\n\nI hope you guys like it too!!\n\nI've prepared some pdf's so you can view and print the cookbook yourself:\n\n* First off, a [screen version](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52343386?secret_password=1iegmlye705qtzzf1qde). This has the pages sitting next to each other in spreads, whereas for the print versions all the pages are separated.\n\n* Second, [the version I printed myself](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52343795?secret_password=oe4frar46oyk7mg4873), for those who want to make an exact duplicate of the booklet I printed (double sided print on a4 sized paper). This includes the 'bleed', which means that the pictures extend a bit beyond the crop mark so that when you cut it to the right size the picture or color will run to the end of the page. I originally made the cookbook on a4 but decided to print it at 80% because that's a cuter size. **PLEASE TAKE NOTE:** the inner margin is a bit small, so for the physical copy I made my bookexchange giftee I didn't cut off the full bleed on the inside margin, I only cut like 1/4th and left the rest.\n\n* Thirdly, [a version with bleed](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52343448?secret_password=56b0fw8lxuw7ce6xaw). So it's a4 sized plus one cm bleed all around. With this pdf you can print it on any size you want, including the 80% version above. You can of course also print this on letter-sized paper, and cut it off at the crop marks. See the note above about cutting.\n\n* Fourthly, [a version without bleed](http://www.scribd.com/doc/52343721?secret_password=fjxwltalai2zyj62ge3), for those of us that are too lazy to cut it to size. It's a4 sized and the colors/pictures run to the end of the page exactly, so if your printer cannot print right up to the edge it's best to use 'scale to print area' or a similar setting.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n**edit:** Also, I want to thank [pixel8](http://www.reddit.com/user/pixel8) for her very helpful proofreading and suggestions!\n\n**EDIT: CHECK THE REPLY BY TOASTD FOR A MIRROR!!! ** Thanks toastd!\n\n**EDIT:** The wonderful [LordStryker](http://www.reddit.com/user/LordStryker) just sent me 3 months of reddit gold! OMG I'm OVERWHELMED! Thank you LordStryker!\n\n**EDIT: For all the people that are asking about version 2, putting it in the reddit store, etc: Not yet. This subreddit is still rather young, so it'll be better if we wait a while, gather more possible entries and then when we make an actual cookbook we do it right: with permissions to use all the content, photo's at the right resolution, and with the admins involved (if they would like to be at least). This one is just for fun. If you'd like to be involved in the next one, message me in 6 months. **\n\n**edit:** [OhighOpyro](http://www.reddit.com/user/OhighOpyro) sent me more gold!!

A cake mix can cost from around $2.50 to $4.50 (I think?  It's been a long time since I bought cake mix) for a single cake.  If I'm not doing anything super fancy with uncommon ingredients, it feels a lot cheaper to just make it from scratch.  With a little practice, it doesn't take much longer, either.  I mean...I haven't done the math.  Anybody want to figure up how much two and a half cups of flour costs when it comes out of a five pound bag that costs around $4?  I think it's kind of like buying a large container of yogurt and spooning some out everyday, as opposed to buying cute little 100-calorie packs that cost a lot more in comparison.\n\nBut like I said, I haven't done the math, so I could be completely mistaken.  I'm sure someone will let me know if I am. \n\nEdit:  I'm thinking a basic cake like [this](http://smittenkitchen.com/2010/08/everyday-chocolate-cake/).  No, I don't use dutch cocoa and I mix up buttermilk from a dried powder like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Saco-Cultured-Buttermilk-16-Ounce-Canister/dp/B001E5E2BS).

Unless you are a lazy fuck and it's 12 am and you're studying for finals and the only thing you have in your house/apartment/room is a box of cake-mix. Fine.

It always feels like a challenge. \n\nSo, I disagree with apparently most F7U12D redditors... Sorry. ", "One reason I dislike cake mix is fashion.  You see, cake mixes, obviously due to economic reasons, tend to cater to what is fashionable as far as taste go.  If people want moist and fluffy, cake mixes are moist and fluffy, if people want sweet, cake mixes are sweet.  This causes a few problems.\n\n1) Any cake based on a mix may not be portable over time.  These mixes change more often than you'd think to keep up with the tastes of customers so my mom's cake may be a completely different cake than mine if the recipe relies on a mix.  As someone interested in food culture, the inability to understand what people of the past were eating is a major concern to me.\n\n2) If you want a taste that is out of fashion, you are screwed.  There are always exceptions, but relying on mixes tends to mean a fairly homogeneous playing field of cakes.  Right now, moist cakes are the paragon of cake, but there are some recipes that do better with dense cake (tres leche comes to mind - less moisture means better absorption).\n\n3) Creativity is lost.  Because cake mixes create a fairly homogeneous playing field, home cooks who rely on them are basically out of the game when it comes to creating new styles of cakes.  Yes, you can add stuff to a mix, but you are always stuck with the base (and remember, it is constantly shifting).  In many parts of the world, home cooks have a proud tradition of being major players in the world of food.  Home cooks create new things and new ideas in cooking.  Now, we relegate this responsibility to chefs, professional bakers, and, sadly, cake mix makers.  While we can argue that some of these people have a desire to create new things, they are secretive with their creations and are still beholden to make things that have wide ranging appeal.  \n\nNot that I needed another reason, but another reason I hate cake mixes is the ingredients that are actually in them.  Cake mixes are designed to 'just work' almost no matter how badly someone screws things up.  This means there are lots of weird ingredients and preservatives in them, but that really isn't my issue with this.  The idea that baking should 'just work' deprives home cooks of the knowledge that once came with baking.  Yes, when you bake you have to measure carefully, but you also have to get a feel for what you are baking.  Is the cake batter too dry, too lose, are we at a different altitude, how is the humidity.  Having to consider these things might seem anathema to many people, but the thing is that they become fairly easy to work with once you gain a knowledge of baking.  This knowledge is the essence of a baker and is now considered too much work due to the ease of things like cake mixes.  Where is the artisan spirit? ", "As a baker, I fucking hate cake mixes.  That stuff is full of dyes, artificial flavours, preservatives, and comes in a massive amount of packaging for such a small amount of product.  Okay so the hippie in me hates them, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Also; biscuit mix. Seriously? Biscuits take like 30 seconds to make. FFS. "]}

One day I had some friends over and they brought with them various bits of alcohol and mixers.  It was one of them who brought first brought the evil into my house.  She had said she was going to bring \"everything for margaritas\" which turned out to be sweet and sour mix and some crappy tequila.  I'm not fan of crappy tequila, but I was ok with using; the sweet and sour, however, I wanted nothing to do with.  Luckily, for unrelated reasons, I had made pomegranate sweet and sour (a very similar process to this recipe) earlier in the week and so we used that.  An epic party ensued and, the sweet and sour was left in the pantry on the shelf (I guess someone from the party put it there...).  \n\nWe all know that giving evil beings time to concoct plans is never a good idea.  The sweet and sour sat and plotted, forgotten.  It used its time in confinement to hatch a plan of revenge.  I would rue the day that I passed it up for some home made mix!  Time passed...\n\n..Two months later...  I'm late to work and I'm stuffing breakfast in my gob as fast as I can.  I'm eating over the sink with my back to the pantry giving the super-concentrated-evil sweet and sour mix the chance it had been waiting for.  A weird scraping sound echoed under the door of the pantry and, suddenly, \"BANG!\" and the back of my pants are soaked with mysterious liquid.  I spin around to find the tiled kitchen floor slowly flooding with a foul smelling green liquid.  \n\nI rushed to the pantry, flung it opened, and found the fucking bottle of sweet and sour had gone suicide bomber.  It had pushed itself off the shelf in order to explode on impact with the ground (these are plastic bottles by the way).  Now, I don't know how many of you have ever spilled this shit on anything, much less tile (and grout), but let me tell you that it instantly makes a super sticky coating on anything it touches.  My pantry, my kitchen, and my pants were now covered in nasty, sticky goop, and I could do nothing but mop... and mop... and mop.  Nearly two hours later (had to take a part day off work...) and seemingly a half gallon on white vinegar (I use it to clean) later, I had gotten most of the sticky off the floor.  To this day I still find small patches of sticky hidden somewhere and have to expend quite a bit of effort scrubbing said patches.\n\nSo, in the war of shitty sweet and sour vs me, the total losses were:\n\n* 1 25lb bag of Japanese rice\n* 4 boxes of cereal\n* A box of cake mix \n* Many hours of time\n* 4 hours of personal leave\n* 1 pair of pants (the spray spots never really came out...)\n\ntl;dr The sweet and sour won and I've been dealing with the aftermath ever since.

So hard.\n\nMade this this evening with 2.5 pounds of boneless pork shoulder that I picked up, and shaved off a couple of hours of prep time by letting it cook for the first hour in my crock pot on high, before reducing the temperature.\n\nAs for the \"liquids to pour in a crock pot when cooking\" thing I've noticed here:\n\nAny dark colored non-alcoholic carbonated, sugared beverage tends to work well.\nYou can pair this with either a sweet barbecue sauce, or a vinegar based, spicy sauce.\n\nAny dark colored non-alcoholic carbonated, artificially sweetened (read: aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, etc) beverage can work here as well, but I would pair it only with a vinegar based sauce. The sweet sauces, I've discovered through similar endeavors, seem to draw out a strange layer of bitterness that can be left in the meat from the sweetener.\n\nAny beer generally works, with handcrafted ales and lagers working better than your general mass-produced beers.\nGo for the darker, maltier flavors, and pair it with a sweet sauce.\nMatch this with a whole grain bread that actually has bits of the grain in it, not that smooth \"wheat\" shit they sell in stores (in the Southeastern part of the US, Arnold breads has a line of breads that are good for mass produced stuff, if you don't have a local bakery or store with a bakery in it that has a clue).\nToastinate the hell out of that bread. Put some muenster cheese on it, and pile that steaming hot pork on top, baby.\n\nBooze can work as well, but I can't see myself pouring eight ounces of sambuca into the crock pot (the licorice flavor would murder all the taste). Whisk(e)y, Bourbon, Brandy, not necessarily in that order, tend to be the options to go to.\nNotice again that it's darker liquors I suggest.\nThis, I would pair with brown and wild rice, steamed cabbage.\nYou might want to use mojo criollo (sparingly) or make a sauce for this - something tangy, but not overtly spicy, and a hint of garlic. The rice has its own flavor, and the steamed cabbage would serve well as a neutral ingredient to balance everything out.\n\n\n(I must note: A lot of the beverage advice I offer comes from years of helping the woman I loved the most cook large amounts of food for family picnics.

Thermostat-controlled griddles will get you more even cooking and more consistency.\n\nI recommend grilling just the slices of bread, first, on both sides until slightly browned. You may then optionally rub the bread vigorously with a clove of garlic, if you love garlic like I do. Then pile the cheese on one of them, leaving it open-faced.\n\nOnce the cheese has melted slightly, add mustard on top of the cheese and the other slice of bread and press down (ideally with a heated weight, like a cast iron pan set on the griddle while it preheats).\n\nOnce it's mostly 'ready', i.e. bread is toasty the way you like it and the cheese is thoroughly molten with some excess frying around the edges, the secret is to **add mustard on the top slice of bread, flip it, then grill briefly.** Grilled mustard is delicious. I blame In-n-Out for this brilliant idea.", "fuck you all take two pieces of bread throw some cheese in between butter that fucker and throw it in the oven and flip it half way"]}

I put in about a cup of soy sauce and maybe a quarter cup of olive oil (but sadly, no JD).  I also mashed in about six cloves of fresh garlic and I threw in the leftover \"body\" of each clove as well.  I also added cayenne pepper and onion powder to the marinade.  I put it in a ziploc bag, which sprung a leak, so I put that ziploc in another ziploc.  Then I put it in the fridge overnight.  Every time I went in to the kitchen (to get the baby's milk, or a soda, or turn off the light, etc), I mashed and flipped the marinading Chechen to make sure it all got covered and coated and infused with the marinade.  My 2 year old liked \"helping\" with that part.\n\nThis evening, I got out my big pot, and I got out my pasta pot, and I got out a slotted metal spatula.  I started cooking the chicken in the big pot and there just wasn't that much sauce left over, so I poured a bit more soy sauce into the pot (maybe a half cup?) as I cooked the chicken.  Once the it was cooked, I removed it (and threw away the dead bodies of the garlic).  After I took the chicken out, I didn't bother measuring how much flour it was, I just put in about six or so tablespoons.  It clumped right up.  So I poured in some milk, a little less than a cup, and mixed it up.  it got nice and thick pretty quick.  I put water on to boil for the pasta.  Then I started adding the cheese (I used about 16oz of hand-shredded Cheddar) fistful by fistful.  When one fistful was melted in, I added another, and so on until all the Cheddar was melted.  My forearm began to get tired.  While I was melting the Cheddar, my 16oz of Penne Rigate were boiling, and I occasionally stirred it to make sure they weren't clumping.  When the cheese was all melted, I added the chicken back into the cheese mixture and mixed it up.  The pasta still wasn't done, though, so I turned the heat down to 1 on my stove and just agitated it enough to make sure it wasn't burning to the bottom of the pot.  When the penne were done, I drained them (though I didn't rinse) and added it to the pot of the cheesy goodness.  \n\nAfter it was cooked, I called my brother and my wife into the kicken to prepare their bowls ad they were both fairly amazed at the delicious spells coming out of the room.  We ate and it was fantastic.  \n\nI think I will make this again.  The next time, I'm going to crumble some bacon in just as I return the chicken to the pot, and I think I'm going to thinly slice some fresh jalapeno to put on top.  I will also put some finely diced fresh tomato on top.  I'm also toying with the idea of adding green chilis and bell peppers.  \n\nThanks for the inspiration!  It was awesome!", "I don't like soy sauce. I would just use regular garlic chicken with oregano. I'd make alfredo sauce instead, just because parmesan is cheaper than cheddar. and I'd use ziti or shells or elbows. broccooli would be good too."]}

Add the resulting slurry 1/2 tablespoon at a time. Stir and simmer for a couple of minutes. Not thick enough?

Melt a tablespoon of butter in the pan after you take out the lemons, add a tablespoon of flour and stir and scrape until it's incorporated completely with the butter and just starting to turn light brown. Add the wine at this point and stir like crazy until everything smooths out and continue as normal.\n\nEdited to add - if you're not a wine drinker, you still have no excuse for cooking wine. Ask someone in the store to help you pick a decent, dry bottle of white and a full-bodied red. Tell them it's for cooking with. If you're too shy to ask, just grab a sauvignon blanc (white) and a rioja or cabernet sauvignon (red). Anything around $7-$10 is fine.

I just had this the other night. I do EXACTLY this (except for one thing which I will get to below) and my mom always did too. Gosh I love slow cookers so much! The only difference between my mom and I is that I started browning the meat first which she never did. Not that that's bad. Hell, if the meat is frozen I don't thaw it completely before browning, just enough so the first 1/2\" or so of surface meat is thawed.\n\nNow, for the one thing I do different: Do not let those brown bits and juices go to waste! Add a can (or two, depends on what you like) of diced tomatoes to the pan after browning, keeping the heat at medium-ish, while scraping at the bottom with a silicone spatula. The acidity helps to release the browned bits fairly quickly. When you've gotten them all freed, add it all to the crock pot. (Also agreeing with BlueDogLA to sit the meat upon the veggies rather than the other way around.)\n\nThe acidity will help tenderize the meat further, as seen in braising. I sometimes add a bit of honey or brown sugar (maybe a couple tablespoons? I never measure anything). The sweetness will offset the acidic taste, but doesn't keep it from doing its job.\n\nAlso, when browning, I agree as well with those who said 1) higher temp and 2) slightly longer time. They key is to keep the surface of the meat as DRY as possible before browning. Pat generously with paper towels and go easy on the salt (which draws water from deeper tissues). Fat and protein heats quicker than water. So, if it is wet with blood or water before browning, the heat will be wasted into boiling that off first before browning can begin... which then just cooks the meat rather than searing it. Not THAT big of an issue if slow cooking, true, but it is when roasting if you want to avoid that nasty grey overcooked 1/4\" ring that surrounds a good, pink center. Yuck. So, it is helpful to do this even with slow cooking as practice for when you should choose to roast instead. =)", "Chuck roast was on sale at the grocery store yesterday!

Christ both on a crutch AND in a sidecar, do I have to do everything around here? This is how you make meatloaf. It's a goddam algorithm, you don't need a recipe. Somebody else, take this and make a comic out of it if you want, I don't have time for that crap.\n\n\nBuy some meat. Get what's on sale.  \nRead the little tags, not the big signs, the big signs lie.  \nGet the kind of meat you like. I like beef and pork.  \n\nFor about every pound of meat you've got, get an egg and break it into a bowl. Add a sploosh of something reddish or brownish that you like the taste of -- ketchup, bbq sauce, A-I, worcestershire. Hot sauce if you're the type. Don't worry about how big a sploosh is, just add it and pay attention after and next time add more or less. This is meatloaf, not rocket science, and it's pretty damn hard to f*ck up.  \n\nIf you like onions, now is the time to chop one up and chuck it in.  \nIf your mom was sneaky, this is when she put in the grated carrot.\n\nBeat all of this sloshy stuff up.\n\nGo to the pan in the oven that has the brown bag of dried bread ends in it. Pull out what you think you'll need, put it in a tough plastic bag, and whang the shit out of it with the bottom of a heavy pan or a rolling pin, or put it on the floor and jump on it.  \n\nTake the bread crumbs (you can throw in anything dried along with the bread crumbs - garlic powder, basil, black pepper) and add them to the egg a little at a time, until the egg stuff is just a little wetter/squashier consistency than the meat. Let it sit a little and the bread crumbs will finish absorbing the sploosh and then it **will** be the same consistency as the meat.\n\n**THAT IS THE GOAL HERE. MEAT IS EXPENSIVE. YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE IMITATION MEAT OUT OF LEFTOVER BREAD, EGGS FOR A BINDER, AND STUFF THAT TASTES GOOD IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MEAT GO FURTHER.**   \n\nDo NOT buy any goddam Stovetop, that stuff is a ripoff. You are paying good money for stale bread and garlic salt. Just keep a brown bag in the oven and put your bread ends in there. \n\nNow take the real meat and the fake egg/bread meat and goosh it together with your bare hands. Nothing else works quite as well as hands, and it's curiously satisfying to do, and if you squish in a rhythmic pattern it will sound like someone having sex.\n\nMake it into a shape like a loaf and put it in a pan. \n\n**DRAPE A BUNCH OF SLICES OF BACON CROSSWAYS OVER THE TOP, SPACED NICE AND EVEN SO EVERYONE GETS THEIR OWN. I SERIOUSLY CANNOT BELIEVE YOU LEFT THIS OUT.**\n\nStart baking, 350 is about right. After a half an hour spread some more of whatever brown/red stuff you used over the top.\n\nPUT A BUNCH OF RUSSET POTATOES IN THE OVEN TOO, AS LONG AS YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THE OVEN BEING ON YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. DON'T USE THE RED KIND, THEY HAVE THE WRONG MOISTURE/STARCH RATIO AND ARE FOR SALADS. GET THE RUSSET KIND AND DON'T FORGET TO POKE EACH ONE WITH A FORK SO IT DOESN'T EXPLODE.\n\nMake a nice salad, put out some good fruit and cheese after, and you won't be a bachelor for much longer.  \n\nYeesh.", "PROTIP: If you hate ketchup as much as I do, you can use BBQ sauce instead.", "NEEDS MOAR JALAPENOS\n\nNote: Jalapenos can vary widely in spiciness - I highly recommend tasting them before you try my suggestions.

It's possible to get the Adobo by itself, but adding peppers + sauce into a food processor/blender/ninja-like chopping session can work well too.\n\nSuggestion #2: \n\nJust add some finely diced fresh jalapenos.\n\nSuggestion #3:\n\nGet some [pickled jalapenos](http://www.amazon.com/Goya-Green-Pickled-Jalape%C3%B1o-Peppers/dp/B002IOBJVU/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1314567393&sr=1-1), dice them, and add them to the beef.

I've tried a lot of different store-bought curry sauces, and tried making it the legit way with spices I actually managed to bring back from a trip to India, but my favorite go-to is still Trader Joe's yellow Thai curry sauce. \n\nIngredients:\n\n* Cut an onion, mince a head of garlic, or just use whole cloves of it, or both (yes I said a head, I love mah garlic), and clean a couple chicken breasts. Cut the chicken breasts into roughly 1-inch chunks. Pro tip: rinse the chicken breast, then pat it dry with a paper towel so that it'll brown nicely when it hits the pan, rather than using up lots of heat to get rid of water. I usually add carrots too, sliced fairly thin.\n\n\nDirections:\n\n* Heat some oil in a saucepan (I use extra virgin olive oil, even though it's got a low smoke point, because it's tasty and a bit healthier), and once it gets hot (but before it starts smoking!) add the carrots. Let them cook for a few minutes (3-5), then add the onions and garlic and let it cook a bit longer. I also like to add additional curry powder, maybe some salt and pepper, and whatever other spices look good throughout this process. I like it spicy, so here is where that happens.\n\n*  After a few more minutes add the chicken and continue cooking everything on medium-high until things are starting to brown (the chicken doesn't need to be cooked through completely, in fact it's better if it's not at this point). The goal is to have everything cooked for the right amount of time, that's why you don't just dump everything in at once. Otherwise the carrots will still be crunchy and raw and the garlic and onions will be a blackened mess.\n\n* Then add the whole jar of sauce (like I said, Trader Joe's is the shit) and turn it down to a simmer. I sometimes rinse the bottle with a bit of water and dump that in as well to get all the deliciousness out of the jar. I've also tried adding additional coconut milk here to make it more Thai, but it gets a bit too rich for my taste.\n\n* Let it simmer until the chicken is cooked satisfactorily, and serve it over brown rice or cous cous or whatever you like. If you start a container of brown rice in the microwave when you start cooking the curry it should be done at about the same time. Also, if you timed the cooking of the chicken right and can let the sauce simmer long enough to reduce a bit without overcooking the chicken then the flavors get more intense, and it's fantastic.\n\nAlso! Plain yogurt with curry is delicious. Serve it alongside the hot curry, and the cold/hot contrast is awesome.\n\nIt may not be classy, or authentic, but that's how I make chicken curry. Now if someone in this thread can teach me how to make Naan easily then I can die happy.", "Its not Indian but it is Asian: \n\nEgg Biryani\n\n - 2 eggs\n - 1 diced/ chopped onion\n - 2/ 3 chillies (cut into small pieces)\n - 1 1/2 teaspoon curry powder\n - 2 teaspoon salt\n - diced coriander (the fresher the better)\n\nHonestly this is a matter of mixing everything into a bowl, really easy. Just do it in the order above. Heat up a frying pan, oil that baby up and when pan is hot pour the contents in and cook until brown. You can help cook the top with some kind of lid but eventually the egg needs to be flipped.\n\nBest inside piece of toast and with some tea.", "I've got some recipes.

Because a lot of people asked for it, I then put it up [on lulu](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/go8vf/ok_ok_you_win_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_is_now/) for the people who didn't have printers, and made a new and improved pdf for the people who had not gotten around to printing it yet ;). I'll take the book off lulu about 2 weeks from now, so if you still want one you'll have to be quick!\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of talk about making a proper book with a publisher, and I've been contacted by people who are interested in publishing it. The reason I'm posting this: it's not going to happen without you all, so I figured we need to get our expectations and priorities straight. Below I've written some discussion points, and my own thoughts and interpretations. Please discuss! :D.\r\n\r\n*Discussion points:*\r\n\r\n1. **Who does what?** As you can see, I'm taking the lead in this project, as well as doing a lot of the work involved ;). The publisher will do a lot of work as well, and have a say in many things based on their experience and expertise. I do view this as a community project, but it's going to be hard to be productive if everyone needs to be involved at all times. So IMHO this should be like a 'benevolent dictatorship': I'll do my absolute best to go about this project with integrity and respect towards this community, to ask for feedback and explain what's happening. In return I'll need you to trust that the publisher and I will do the right thing for the project, and respect our decisions. If you need to know more about me before you feel you can trust me, please don't hesitate to AMA or check out my comment history :). \r\n\r\n2. **What is the timeline?** I think we need to wait a little more, at least a few months, and gather more possible recipes. I personally would like to make the book a lot thicker than it is now, so the more recipes are submitted, the better. I'm thinking about starting discussions with publishers in 3 or 4 months, and then see what happens. Also, I'd like to be graduated by the time we get to the actual work of putting the book together, so I can work on it full time for a while. Either way, it might well be that it won't work out with a publisher, but at least it'll be an interesting experience. Self-publishing is of course always an option too, but doing this with a publisher is way cooler and easier.\r\n\r\n3. **What about the recipe authors? Part I: permission.** For the previous book I didn't get any permissions, because that wasn't supposed to be such a big thing ;). I did attribute every recipe (when possible), and I would of course do that for the next version of the cookbook as well. However, if we actually want to publish something for real, it can't go forward without official and legal permission from recipe authors. \r\n\r\n4. **What about the recipe authors? Part II: money.**  A publisher will only want to publish this if they think they can profit from it. I will only want to work for this if there's a good chance I'll be paid for my time, because I need to eat ;). There are about 35 recipe in the current book, and it took me a couple days to create a somewhat passable version, for which I didn't bother too much with picture resolutions, font size, kerning, etc etc. I'd like the next book to have lots more recipes. Lots of recipes means lots of authors and lots of work for me/the publisher. So, after thinking about all of the previous sentences, I don't think it's realistic to assume there's going to money to pay 50 or 60 or 70 or more recipe authors. Maybe if it's an overwhelming success we can send you each a copy for free, but I don't know if that's possible. Of course this is something a publisher has a much better handle on, so I might well be wrong, and then we'll all be rich :D. It's definitely something to think about though. Will this change your opinion of the project? Is this (un)acceptable? I'd love to hear your opinions.\r\n\r\n5. **Would you be ok with changes to the recipes?** Some recipes might need changes to make them ready for publishing, for instance because the pictures are blurry, because they're just a little bit too wide or too long, because things are misspelled, because the instructions are unclear, because they use ingredients that are local to somewhere, etc. Of course this is partly a legal issue, I assume you'll sign for this when you give permission to be included, I think no publisher will go near it if you don't. I would like to think that we'd work with the authors if possible, but that might not be practical depending on the volume of changes and the number of authors. Is this acceptable?\r\n\r\n6. **How will I keep you up to date or ask for feedback?** I don't want to keep spamming this subreddit if that's in any way unwelcome. But I do want to be transparent about this project, and open it up for occasional feedback. Should I make a new subreddit/blog/whatever to discuss the project or keep it in here? Mods, maybe you can weigh in on this, it's your subreddit ;). Obviously the frequency of posts etc will all depends on the publisher as well, I'm not sure how much feedback and transparency they'll be comfortable with. I've made /r/hungryasfuck because why the hell not, but I'm not sure if that is the appropriate forum.\r\n\r\n7. **Any other suggestions/thoughts/concerns you'd like to discuss?**\r\n\r\nOne more thing: I've already received a rather unpleasant message about 'selling out' when I first posted the cookbook, so I figured I should address it before some troll derails any productive discussion we might have. I have to admit I'm not super-involved in the 'f7u12 culture', I just enjoy browsing f7u12(d). The reason I'm behind this project is that I just really like your recipes, and think it'll be AWESOME to have a proper real cookbook of them. I don't expect to become super-rich from this, AFAIK most publishing endeavors don't rake in the cash, I just hope it'll cover the amount of work I'll put in ;). If all this makes me a sellout somehow, that's ok. This cookbook thing is not going to happen if you guys won't give permission to be included, so yeah, that would be it then. Either way, I loved the overwhelming positive reaction the current incarnation of the cookbook got, so if this project doesn't happen I'll always have that ;). Thank you all :D.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\ntl;dr: We're (hopefully) making a recipe book with recipes from this subreddit, with a publisher. Just read the bold discussion points and give your opinion about them.

I'm planning on making my own cookbook with my material, and I am maintaining the rights to my pieces.  Now, this doesn't mean I won't allow others to publish mine, in fact, I welcome the appearance of my material in book upon book upon book, but I do not want it to appear in a book that claims ownership or copyrights.  I am skeptical about someone profiting on my material over and over, and yet, I want you to get paid for your work.  This is going to be touchy for a lot of people who put tons of time themselves into the actual production of said comics.  I am doing this for fun, but I am also doing it with a goal in mind, as well.  I would hate to do all of this work and have someone else get the only profit, credit, and rights.  In fact, I would be down right pissed.  Now if it is handled properly, and not with greed, but in fact benevolently, I will put my full support behind whichever project and whomever is behind the wheel.  If it is handled with less than the utmost respect, I will show my fangs.\n\nFor the record: I bought one of the versions you did, and thought it was lovely.

Getting it published is a cool idea and all, but _someone_ - be it the \"author\" or the publisher - is going to be making a shit ton of money off of it, and that is entirely undeserved.", "I am in. Where do I sign up? Oh wait, do I need to do a recipe? Fuck!", "I have 3 or 4 recipes in the book and you can go ahead and do whatever you want with them.  You can make money off them and not pay me, you have my permission.  When I put things on the internet, I pretty much consider it free game (even though it technically may not be).  I'm a realist I suppose.\n\nHonestly, I think it's too niche to make any real money, but that's just my cynical nature coming out.  I still wish you luck.  That said, if you make a bunch of dough I'll just make 30 or 40 more comics and sell them myself. :-)  You're my guinea pig.", "I think we need more recipes :)", "Ok, here is the scoop. As much as cookbooks rule, I think we could do something much easier.  How about a database of the recipes on here.  Searchable and all that shit.  Because I know I haven't opened up a cookbook in a few years, I literally will have the recipe on my computer or in my head.  I do own a few cookbooks, but again, I generally don't have them open.\n\nAnyways, I think to make it easier, along with the comics, a written list of ingredients and steps comes up.  Unless its something complex, I read and understand the recipe, then have the ingredients list open so I know how much of shit goes in what.\n\nThen, with this whole database thing, we just have a \"f7u12d submit page\" where we put in the recipe name, what meal(s) it'd be, ingredients listed, and other keywords.  This way you can just search for what you want.  Have a ton of avocados left over and don't want any more (tequilla) guac?  Then search for a recipe.  My $0.02", "I don't feel comfortable about this. Why should you profit? Let's be honest here, it's not like your last book really added to the comics. (Not to say it wasn't great work)  \n\nYou're basically asking for all future profits (those that don't belong to the publisher), not to mention future deals once you've made a name (and popular culture won't be able to distinguish between the talent behind the book and the girl who edited it together, especially if you happen to be cute, you'll be branded as the mother of f7u13d within days) in exchange for doing what, exactly? Picking out 101 recipes that you had nothing to do with and deciding on the order?   \n\nLike someone else mentioned, 99% of the work is done for you already. All the talent and creative work is done for you. Why should you (potentially) profit at all?  \n\nHere's what you can do. Present publicly all your expenses and once those are covered, in addition to a reasonable sum of money for your efforts, everything the book makes is donated to charity. And pick an international charity, and don't pick cancer or children, they get enough as it is compared to other pressing issues. And no large aid organizations either, they have too many expenses.

Go get some ingredients: wood ear fungus,golden lily flower (dried), soft tofu, pork strips, egg, white pepper, chili oil, soy sauce, michu cooking wine, vinegar, bamboo shoots (shredded), mushrooms (canned for authentic Chinese restaurant flavor), and chicken flavoring (msg).  You want to soak the lily flower and wood ear fungus for a while before cooking.  Take a large pot (preferably a wok) and boil some water up.  Add the bamboo, fungus, lily flower, mushrooms into the pot while its coming up to a boil.  Now depending on the size of your pot/wok, the amounts of soysauce and other seasonings will vary.  I make a big ass pot for service, and it usually takes about 7 oz of soy sauce, 7 oz of cooking wine and 7 oz of vinegar.  ADJUST THE SEASONINGS TO YOUR TASTE. Also, save the vinegar to add in the very end if you are using a wok because the vinegar can react with the wok to give your soup a weird metallic flavor.  After the soysauce and wine are added, scoop some chili oil in (2 T), chicken stock flavoring (2 T) and 2 dashes of white pepper.  Mix it around, and get some corn starch slurry mixed up and add it in until the desired consistency is reached.  If you haven't already, cook the pork strips in some oil or water and add that in as well.  Then, beat some eggs up (3 eggs) and slowly drizzle them into the boiling soup and stir slowly.  Finally add the tofu that is cut into little strips into the soup and you can add the vinegar in if you haven't already.  Garnish with a little chopped green onion and you are good to go.  Make sure you taste it before serving to make sure its hot/sour enough for your tastes  \n\nedit: finish it off with a little sesame oil if you like", "I second this, I could eat hot n sour soup everrrrryday", "I would make one, but I don't have the time/effort... its not too hard though.

The only difference is that I use raw sugar instead of white for a deeper flavour.\n\n* 1 mug of very just under boiling hot water\n* 4 tablespoons Thai tea\n* sugar\n* condensed milk\n* evaporated milk\n* ice\n\nPour mug of hot water over 4 TBSP of Thai tea.  Stir a bit and let steep a bit* while you prepare the rest.  In a tall glass (I use at least a 20 oz glass) add 2-4 teaspoons of sugar.  Then add 2-4 teaspoons of condensed sweetened milk.  Strain your tea into this glass and mix until all the sugar and milk has been in corporated.  Add evaporated milk to taste (1/4 to 1/2 cup) and mix.  Add to a 20 oz container filled with ice or just add that amount to your glass to fill it to the top.  A light mix will melt some of the ice and dilute your drink perfectly.\n\nAfter a bit of practice, the most difficult part is measuring out the tea and sugar.  My routine is heating a mug of water and letting the tea steep, then measuring the sugar into my next cup.  I use a large spoon to add a glob of condensed sugar, mix, pour a lot of evaporated milk, ad tea, then ice.  It takes about 5 minutes or less from cold water to iced tea.  If you want, you can wait til later to add the evaporated milk to get that nice, just poured look.  I just want get that caffeinated, sugary goodness in my gullet so I try to be as efficient as possible.\n\n[This](http://www.amazon.com/Pantainorasingh-Thai-16-Ounce-Bags-Pack/dp/B000KK39CQ) Pantai Norasingh brand is the tea I use.

Amazon is convenient as heck, but this is way too expensive.  \n\n*timing or 2-4 minutes for most tea is not essential as it doesn't have a problem of becoming overly bitter.  \n\n"]}

When it's really bubbling, add in your pasta and let it cook, stirring occasionally. We're shooting for slightly under-done (between unpleasantly firm and al dente), so cook it a minute or two less than the packaging recommends.\n\nSince you're going to have to wait a lot while all that boiling and cooking happens, take the time to shred your mozzarella and cheddar if they're not already shredded. Peel the rind off of your brie--a vegetable peeler works great for this--and tear it into 1/2\" balls. Mix these and the blue cheese crumbles into the mozzarella and cheddar.\n\nOnce the pasta's done, drain it in a colander and let it rest. Don't rinse it. \n\nClean out the dutch oven and reheat it over medium high heat. Melt 3tbsp of butter (unsalted!) into it, then mix in 3tbsp of white, all purpose flour. Stir quickly and constantly to prevent lumps. Let it cook for just a moment, then lower the heat to medium-low.\n\nPour in your cream and milk, slowly! Whisk or stir constantly and try to eliminate any clumps of roux that form. Add in the mustard powder, salt, white pepper, and hot sauce at this point, mixing them in real good.\n\nOnce it's all beaten in, you can let it heat up for just a moment before mixing in the first handful of cheese. Go slowly here, stirring thoroughly to ensure each batch of cheese melts completely before adding the next.\n\nOnce it's all in there, mix in about 2/3rds of your cooled bacon crumbles, then the cooled pasta. Once they're coated, take it off the heat.\n\nSpray down a 9x12/13 baking dish and pour in your delicious, noodly goop. Let it level out for a moment, then top it with a healthy portion of bread crumbs, shredded cheese blend (I like the Parmesan/Asiago/Romano mix from Kraft a lot for this), Italian seasoning, and the leftover bacon.\n\nPop it into the oven for 35-45 minutes, watching it after 25 or so. You want the top browned and bubbling, with the very upper edges around the dish to be crisping and almost black before you remove it.\n\nLet it cool as long as you can, then serve with a scoop or wide spatula.\n\nMakes large 10-12 servings, and when it cools, creates an awesome, sliceable casserole that microwaves wonderfully.

If you use beef, season it more. Lamb is by far the most flavourful red, non-game meat (if you can't pinpoint the flavour, think gyro meat but slightly more savoury. The beef in gyro meat dulls the potency of the lamb), so with lamb you don't want to overdo spices. Beef is duller though, so use **ground chuck (NOT GROUND BEEF)** or a sirloin/brisket mix and up the spicing somewhat. \n\n2. Make sure your aubergines are dry before putting them in oil. Water makes oil explode. If your oil explodes and you're still alive, use vinegar or baking soda to smother it. If you add water to the oil fire, hold your genitals over the flames so that if you do live you can't pollute the Earth with your spawn. \n\n3. Aubergines are pretty dull in flavour. As far as I've tried, there isn't any good way to correct this. You can use salt and pepper, ideally kosher salt, to try and absorb the oil, but it's going to taste like mush regardless of what you do. Use a really flavourful side dish to offset that. Also, use as small of an aubergine as possible. The giant ones they sell in the supermarkets aren't good for anything outside of moussaka layers, while the tiny Chinaman ones that I've found in French open-air markets are a bit more flavourful and much better texturally. REMEMBA KIDS, INDUSTRIAL VARIETIES ARE GROWN BECAUSE THEY SHIP WELL, NOT BECAUSE THEY TASTE GOOD. \n\n4. Don't fucking use a hot-hot pepper. I don't care if you can stomach a volcano, this isn't a locker room and we're not teenage boys trying to one-up each other because we're too bashful to just compare penis sizes or fight with knives. The purpose of the pepper is to add a bit of kick to what is otherwise a fairly cool dish. If you add something too spicy, it's going to fuck up your tongue and you won't taste anything but the spicy. It's one of the most flavourful dishes in Turkish cuisine, you don't want to only taste one element of it. \n\n5. Don't deep fry your aubergines too long. You want them to be slightly firm, like a 75%-done baked potato. If you can pass a knife through it without resistance, it's been too long. Even two minutes may be too long if your oil is on the hotter side. Do one minute of frying, test with the knife, and adjust in 20 second increments. \n\n6. Don't use one of those giant, flavourless tomatoes you find in the US and don't refrigerate it. Use something very flavourful, like cherry or roma tomatoes. \n\n7. Put your onion in the freezer for 20-30 minutes before chopping it. It will no longer sting your eyes. Science, motherfucker.\n\n8. Again, you will seriously die if you're not careful with the oil. Castles used to pour it on invaders. That's because they'd die. Don't fuck around with boiling oil. You will die. \n", "[deleted]", "This looks delicious and whatnot but i was curious about the \"afiyet oisun\" in the last panel and so I tried google tranlsate and saw that it translates (literally) into english as \"shit your meal\" and \"shit of your meal\" in spanish and so I was wondering which of these two, if either, best approximate the \"afiyet oisun\" in the sense that you meant...\n\nI also want to add that this does look tasty and I will be trying this at home in the not-so-distant future.", "Ellerinize saglik!

Once you get around to peeling and cutting and adding them, they won't hit the hot liquid at fridge temp and cool the whole thing down too much.  \n\n* You can use dried thyme for this (preferably dried whole leaves, not powder), but if you buy one of those $2 plastic containers of fresh thyme sprigs in the produce section, you can throw it in the freezer and keep it for months if not years.

That's more than they cost to print and send, because I'll have to bind them myself and my time isn't free. **This price is for printing, shipping and waving it goodbye when I leave the post office.** And no, I don't know how much that is in dollar. I'm guessing it's about 25, but we'll figure out currencies later.\n\nPrinting will be on regular 90grams white laser printer paper, and print with a color laser machine (just like I did for the one in the picture). Binding involves a black metal coil, a sheet of white card stock on the back, and a plastic sheet in the front to protect the cover.\n\nI will write or draw something on the title page if that amuses you ;).\n\nThis will be a go at 10 people at least. We can figure out how to transfer money/addresses when we hit that point.\n\n**EDIT: To make it abundantly clear what the deal is here, this is what I said to jhh4321 below: Yes, I'll make some money of this. This is not to pay me for the work of putting all this together, this is to pay me for binding all these ones by hand, because that's shit work.**\n\nI sure hope everyone will print it them, because that saves me the time of making them and the work of making sure everyone sends me money and gets a copy.

Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Cover the rolls with plastic wrap to retain moisture.\n\n   3. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add oil to 1/2 inch depth, and heat for 5 minutes. Slide 3 or 4 lumpia into the oil. Fry the rolls for 1 to 2 minutes, until all sides are golden brown.

Best way to do it is get pre made wrappers, fill each one with roughly 2 ounces of the filling pre shape it the way you want it and close with an egg wash and let it sit so that it will stay shut when you fry them. Protip to keep it tight, put the filling in about 1/3 the way up and fold the top over and push it back and fold the sides in and roll until the last inch and brush with the egg wash.

He had to end up with a mixture that was about 2 parts potato to 1 part butter.", "1 - Open the packet of Mash Potato Powder.\n\n2 - Add water and stir.\n\n3 - I am a fat bachelor :(\n", "* Get some big, floury potatoes. 6 will serve 4 people\n* 75g of butter\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Ground nutmeg\n\n(Skin on or off, whichever you prefer).\nCut the potatoes into 2cm x 2cm x 1cm pieces.\nBoil in a pot of salted water until cooked.\nDrain and set aside with the lid on the pot.\n\nAdd the butter to a frying pan and cook until the butter has a brown-ish hue. Don't burn the butter, if you do, just throw it out and start again.\n\nAdd 150ml of milk to the potatoes and place over a low heat, to warm the milk.\n\nAdd the browned butter and start mashing.\n\nHalfway through mashing add the salt & pepper and a liberal amount of ground nutmeg.\n\nBEST EVER. Variant of this: add chopped spring onions/scallions. \n\n\n", "HOMESTYLE MASH:\n\nStart with a starchy, non-waxy potato, like a russet.\n\nCut 3 1/2 pounds of potatoes into small pieces; small is better but not too tiny. You don\u2019t want them to crumble to become glue. Scrub them first, but no need to peel them.\n\nPut into a bowl of ice water as you cut. This will prevent them from oxidizing.\n\nDrain them, and put them in a large pot. Then cover them with a high quality, salted stock or broth. Just cover them; don't fill the pot all the way. \n\nBring it to a boil on high heat, then reduce it to a temperature just enough to keep the boil. \n\nBoil just until the potatoes barely fall apart with a fork.\n\nWhile you are doing this, heat 2 cups of cream or 2 cups of half-and-half in a saucepan on superlow heat. Add garlic.\n\nYou can add crushed garlic from a can (4 teaspoons or so) or, even better, 6 cloves of fresh crushed garlic. \n\nAdd black pepper. Add a half stick of quality salted butter. Taste. Add salt generously until pleasantly salty. \n\nTurn up heat slowly, just until it simmers, and stir it frequently. Set it aside once it simmers.\n\nGrate 6oz of Parmesan, the higher quality the better.\n\nNow, the potatoes are done cooking. Drain them, and return them to the hot pan. Let the excess water steam out of them. \n\nNext, put them in tupperware if you won't be eating them until the next day (these do fantastic overnight). If you won't be eating them right away, you can pour the cream over them and just let them sit in the cream. You can throw the grated cheese on top if you want.\n\nOk, it's the next day (or same day). Put the potatoes, cream, and cheese in the big pot and mash with a potato masher until mostly mashed but still lumpy. You are going with the homemade look, so why make everything uniform with an electric mixer? These potatoes have a very hearty feel to them. \n\nFor this same reason you didn't lose the skins; it actually looks nice to have skin pieces in there. It looks less bland.\n\nNow, get a large stack of tasting spoons, high quality butter, sea salt, and a black pepper grinder (Some say you have to do white pepper in potatoes, but black pepper adds more variety to the look and has a stronger taste. The black specs look good actually!).\n\nTaste. If it needs more flavor, add a butter, salt, and pepper. Mash. Taste. Repeat until it is perfect, adjusting ingredients as you go (you won't put that much butter it; you have cream and cheese already). Mash it with the burner on medium-low. Don\u2019t overmash it though! You\u2019ll get glue. \n\nIt's really incredible.\n\nDo NOT try to skip the tasting step.

Read it, live it, be transformed.\n\n\nI did some research on ramen, and discovered that the crinkly shit is an imitation of some sort of actual ramen noodles, like there is such a thing as fresh ones and shit. Turns out they come from Japan. \nReal ramen are made with minerals that give them 'a distinctive bite'; and I suspect the packaged ones have some of that in their warped degenerate heritage, 'cause just putting spaghetti in soup was never even fucking close.\n\n\nSo I experimented (no permits, fuck the villagers), and discovered this: good whole-wheat spaghetti (costco sells some damn nice stuff in bales) cooked just shy of al-dente, a little less cooked that I would normally think was done, form the basis for a transformed ramen-like next-level experience.  Add a bunch a salt to the water, 'cause whole-wheat pasta just runs right over that dainty little pinch you sissy.\n\n\nCook a bag of noodles, toss them with just a touch of canola oil, then put them in a big ziplock. You heard right. This will keep them in better shape than a bin, better than even the less air would seem to explain.

I put some of the noodles in, cold.\n\n\nI pull out a 2 cup microwave safe measuring cup, and fill it with strange delights. Some veg, some proteins like seitan or tofu or edemame, or dead animal bits if that what you need to make you feel like a man whatever (but make it cooked or like really thin bits, be fucking careful), water, and some sauces--I usually use a little soy, oyster (again veggie version), and hoisin, not very Japanese, but who gives a shit... this is magic we're making. Sometimes I use ponzu, or shoyu and mirin, or tonkatsu sauce, so bite me. I can add things like curry, if it's my mood to do so. The options are endless, and can be as easy as binning stuff from the freezer in and saying fuggit; important, as I am disabled, yeah, playing life on hard mode bitchez.

Serve with a starch and two vegetable sides for a complete meal.\n\nSeriously, that's it.  If you can get the technique, you can do anything.\n\nWELL OF COURSE THERE ARE TIPS:\n----------------\nThe best meat (beef, pork, lamb) cuts are ribs, shoulder, roast; some hunk of meat that's pretty well marbled with fat and will fit comfortably in your cooker.  Really brown that meat well in oil in a heavy-bottomed pan.  Brown it on all sides.  Think about building up a crusty brown exterior.  A TON of the meaty flavors come from this step since there are fewer [Maillard reactions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction) in liquid environments like slow cookers.  Some people cook chicken too, like big chicken thighs -- to each his own.\n\nThink aromatic vegetables like onion, garlic, celery, carrots, shallots.  Big chunks are fine but it's easier to make a sauce when they're pretty finely diced.  I avoid starchy veg like potatoes because they tend to disintegrate and don't really add much flavor.  If you really cook the vegetables until they're mush, don't feel bad about straining them out and keeping the cooking liquid to make a sauce or gravy.*\n\nSeasonings and braising liquids pretty much define the dish.  Don't oversalt at first, as liquid levels may change, but adjust seasoning before serving.  Chicken stock and wine common braising liquids, but also try slow-cooking (braising) with beer or fruit juices.  Simple stuff like cream of mushroom soup poured over a browned beef shoulder roast and served with hot buttered noodles is pretty darn good.  Also, you can toss in some onion and lemon slices over some pork and add barbeque sauce that tastes delicious over rice.  Or pork or lamb with dried fruit and wine, served over cous cous.  Again, the specific ingredients are not as important as the technique.\n\nBONUS GRAVY RECIPE\n\n- 4 tbs fat (bacon drippings, fat drippings from cooking, butter)\n\n- 4 tbs flour\n\n- 2 1/2 cups strained cooking liquid and/or stock\n\n- salt and pepper\n\nMelt butter in heavy saucepan.  Add flour and cook that pasty roux until it's lightly browned and smells cooked (think of how a piecrust smells).  Add liquid and whisk fast and let it come to a boil.

I'm not going to lie, some oil is just too damn high and I can't afford them. So I use what I can afford. \n\nAs for how to properly fry it, first off make sure that your oil is hot enough. I can now do this now by just looking at it and testing it, I have been making fried chicken since I was nine, I'm now 27. Since you have not been frying as long as I have, here is a site that might help you determine the temp of your oil ([Link](http://johndlee.hubpages.com/hub/Deep-Frying-3-Ways-to-Check-the-Oil-Temperature-Without-a-Thermometer)). \n\nThen there is also the batter or what you coat it in. Everyone does it different. That is why I said you can't fuck it up. I use Soul Seasoning, Salt, Pepper, and other random crap I find up in my pantry. I like to live on the edge. Word of advice stay away from chili powder, used the hot stuff... took years to live that one down.  \n\nJust make sure that you get the chicken wet first and then put it in the flour mixture, which by the way I add spices too as well. Hell I add spices to every damn step, minus the oil. I want to make sure that chicken taste  like something. Some folks might call this over kill, I have yet get anyone tell me that it didn't taste good, minus the chili powder incident of 1998. \n\nI always put mine directly in the oil when it is hot enough, I don't use bags or other random things, just two cake pans. One to get the chicken wet which is eggs and milk and then the flour mixture. I use cake pans cause they are easy to clean and I only dredge one piece of chicken at a time to make sure that I get full coverage. So by the end, my hands are covered in flour so I just drop that extra into the hot oil, insta crunchy bits. \n\nAlso if you do bone in chicken which I no longer really cook cause it is a pain, make sure that you cook it all the way. It does take a little bit longer in my experience. I have since switched to boneless, still keep the skin it is the best part! To me they cook faster and more even. \n\nOh yes, make sure that you have a chicken fryer. I have one from before WWII. Lovely fry pan. Cast Iron also works really well as it is able to keep heat and that is what you need to in order to make good fried chicken. \n\nIf all else fails find the first Southern women you can find who is over 50 and ask her for directions. As every family has their own way of making chicken. So it really is kinda odd. I have seen people cook it in the oven then fry it, I have seen people use a deep fryer, I have seen people use pressure cookers. I even saw someone cook it on an open fire. Granted my mom can make fired chicken on a wood burning stove. That is where them old skillets come in handy. Then there are the different ways of bring it all together to make the perfect fried chicken. \n\nAlso don't burn it, nothing worse than burnt chicken and trust me that is worse than adding chili powder. \n\n\nEDIT: Draining the chicken is very important as well. I have old towels that I no longer use that I keep just for the draining oily things. So make sure that all the oil can drain away and moisture can not build up on the outside of it as that will also kill the crunch.

While it's heating up, rinse your split peas/dhal and lentils (a strainer under water works well).  Add the split peas first and cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat, covered.

Remember, with a vegan or vegetarian dish, the vegetables are the star, not the side. Buy good ones, cut them carefully, and cook them properly. If they are overcooked and soft, the food will suck. If they are undercooked and hard, the food will suck. If they aren't seared, the food will suck. If they are watery, the food will suck. If they aren't fresh, the food will suck.

I should have put \"notes in comments\" up there in the title. LOLNOPE\n\n2. Go easy on the salt. Ideally just use two pinches in the beginning and then one pinch per bowl after it's done. Same with the pepper, it's already flavourful as shit and you don't need to smother the flavour of the fish and herbs with your filth\n\n3. The key to this dish is to pair a white fish and a red fish. You want something fairly flavourful but not overpoweringly fishy. This isn't your mother's vagina, it shouldn't be disgustingly fishy. \n\n4. You also want to keep your fish selection limited to either one or two of each colour. Bouillabaisse and cioppino, while fantastic dishes, aren't the same thing as this. Variety in both of those is valued because they descend from fisherman docks and throwing in a portion of the day's catch. This isn't a fisherman's stew. Just pick whatever's available, somewhat firm, flavourful on its own, and fresh. Don't use frozen, tinned, or processed fish. This isn't 1944 Poland, we're not in the ghetto, you can splurge. \n\n5. Be very careful to not boil your potatoes too much. You want them to still have some semblance of firmness, just a little structure to them. \n\n6. Traditionally you don't keep your vegetables in the final product. Personally, I find it a bit cluttered when you do, and it's not like a carrot is going to rock your fucking world. If you want to keep them in, fine. If you don't, reuse them along with what's left of your white fish and herbs to make a fish stock. You can do a metric tonne with fish stock, it's fantastic\n\n7. You want to keep the pairings fairly simple, and find something that works with both the herbs *and* the fish. Usually I go with bread (not wonderbread, but something which can soak up the remainder of the broth while standing on its own) and a fresh herb salad. If you're using ukha as an appetiser, you'll want to use a side dish which cleanses the taste of fish so it doesn't bleed into the next course. \n\n8. Simplicity is the key to Russian cuisine. Don't go apeshit with your seasoning. It should have a certain hint of blandness to it, that's true of all Balkan cuisines. Personally I like that, it tastes honest.\n\n9. If you want *and* your fish choices permit it, three or four hairs of saffron added early are a welcome addition. If you do add saffron though, don't bring your stew to a high boil. Borderline simmering is best. \n\n10. It should keep for about three days in the fridge, but I wouldn't trust it beyond 5. "]}

Then, when you get home, dump everything in a skillet (or whatever), and you're good to go.\n\nFor specifics, one of my favorite fast dishes is something my husband calls Earl: boil 2 cups water, add 2 cups quick-cooking rice, remove from heat. let rice set up (five minutes), and during that time, chop up some tomatoes (or use a can, whatever). Then add 2 spoonfuls of butter, two (or more, mmm cheese) spoonfuls of shredded parmesan, dump in the tomatoes, and stir. Fast and filling.", "I posted this a [few years back](http://www.reddit.com/comments/9ffw0/i_havent_cooked_anything_in_my_life_but_really/c0cqjrk):\n\nI make this a lot. I wrote it up for my buddies. It's really easy (e.g. I can do it). A lot of the recipes on here look intimidating to me, so maybe this is up your alley:\n\nPenne with a a meaty vodka pasta sauce.\n\nStuff You Need\n\n* Penne (whole grain sucks, get the real stuff)\n* Salt\n* Vodka Pasta Sauce. [Scarpetta Tuscan Vodka Sauce](http://www.amazon.com/Scarpetta-Tuscan-Vodka-Sauce-19-8-Ounce/dp/B000F3OA7G) is good too but my Kroger doesn't carry it because they are dirty fuckos. You could also make it from scratch too I guess, but fuck that noise\n* Italian Sausage Links\n* A skillet with a lid\n* A pot with a lid\n* One of those drainy things\n\nOk, you need to boil some water to cook the pasta in. Put like a couple of quarts of water into your pot - enough that your pasta will drown in it. Add some salt. I like salt. Some don't. I put like two tablespoons in there. Balls to the wall. Put the pot on the stove, cover it and crank that shit up to high and get it going. Stir it a bit to mix in the salt. I'm not sure it's needed, but it can't hurt.\n\nOnce the water begins to bubble and get ready to boil the timing is right to begin cooking your meat. It usually takes two sausages to satisfy me (no homo), but you might want to go with one for yourself. Three is probably a good number for three people. Remove the sausage link's condoms. We are going for pleasure, not safety here. Throw them on your skillet on medium heat. Chomp up the links into tiny little bite sized chunks and cook until it's brown.\n\nOk, once the meat is cooked the timing should be good for the pasta. I just eye ball the amount of pasta I want, but I guess one cups (by volume) of pasta is about right for one hungry person. Dump that into your pot and cover that shit back up to bring it back to a boil.\n\nAs it's coming to a boil, dump some pasta sauce in there. Once again I just eye ball it based on the amount of pasta and meat. I don't know, like a cup I guess. Whatever. Mix that meat and sauce together and cover your skillet.So by now the water in your pot should be going pretty good. Uncover the lid and stir up your pasta so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot because that sucks.\n\nYou want to cook the pasta sauce (stirring frequently) until it starts to bubble up and stuff. The pasta sauce is already cooked, so you are really just heating it up. Also keep stirring your pasta so it doesn't stick.\n\nSo the key to finishing this up right is waiting until the pasta is about done. I usually just grab one out of the pot and taste it. If it's still just slightly hard then it's good enough to do the job. Drain the water out. I like to put a plate over the pasta while the steam rises up and get the plate kinda hot. Adding hot pasta to a cold plate only makes the pasta cold quicker. So take your drained out pasta and add it in with the sauce to get it good and coated. Some people like to add like a teaspoon of the pasta water to get some of the starch mixed in to make the sauce stick to the pasta better, but I can't tell the difference. Stir it all up until it's good and covered. \n\nAnd you should be good to go", "Instant ramen-style noodles, but fucking delicious:\n\nYou need home made stock for this, so only 30 minutes if you have a stocked kitchen. Also you want a _very_ strong stock, so you may need to reduce it some. That shit should look like jelly at fridge temp.\n\nPut an egg in a pot of salted water, boil that shit. When the water boils turn off the heat and let it sit for about five minutes while you get everything else together.\n\nIn another pot, get your stock and add some or all of this stuff to it: Sesame oil, sriracha sauce, seaweed, fish sauce. Soy sauce if you want, and salt if your stock isn't salted. The sesame oil is the most important.\n\nTake the egg out of that water and turn the heat back on. While the water is heating up again peel the egg. It should be barely cooked and really damn hard to peel without it exploding everywhere. Deal.\n\nCook your noodles. Asian store noodles, that you're supposed to pre-soak and they cook in like two minutes. Not fucking spaghetti ok?\n\nPut the noodles in the bowl. Cut the egg in half and stick it in there too. Add whatever the fuck else you got, like some leftover veggies or that week-old general tso's chicken or whatever. Scallions. Pour the broth all over that shit and eat it. With chopsticks.

Then you can use it in a variety of ways. When you're super lazy, couscous takes 5 minutes, pop some of that chicken in there.

Even better if you have assorted vegetables to throw in there like some carrot shavings or whatever.\n\nEDIT: Just thought of two more. Tilapia filet -> egg -> breadcrumbs -> pan with hot olive oil -> PLATE BAM YOU'RE DONE. Good with wild rice and asparagus.\n\nSalmon -> grill pan -> melted butter and lime juice. WHAT. Serve it with wild rice and asparagus again. It works for fish.\n\nSECOND EDIT: And when I say serve with wild rice and asparagus, feel free to cheap out and use the 90 second microwave rice, and as for the asparagus, don't steam it. Put it on the pan with your fishes and maybe drizzle a bit of melted butter or olive oil and parmesan on it after you plate it. Steamed vegetables are gross, man.\n\nTHIRD EDIT: It occurs to me that the 90 second rice isn't exactly cheaping out, given that it's more expensive than just buying rice.

Turn the oven on to 450.\n2. Slice up one or two apples, half-moon shaped, about 1 mm thick.\n3. Melt a WHOLE STICK of butter in a CAST IRON skillet.  \n4. Gently saute the apples in the butter until they start to get floppy.  \n\nWhile the apples are sauteing, beat up 4 eggs. \nIn a different bowl, mix 1/2c. flour with 1/2 c. milk. Blend gently but do get out the lumps. Dump into the eggs. Add 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp. vanilla.\n\nPour some of the melted butter into the egg batter and stir gently to combine.  \nPour the egg batter over the apples in the skillet and put the whole thing in the oven.  \n\nCheck it at 15 minutes, it might need a little more time to get nicely golden/brown on top. Serve IMMEDIATELY.\n\n\n*All the gory details:*\n\nEggs pouf when they're hit with fast even heat. Let them sit around and think about it and you'll get a big hockey puck instead of a pillow.  \n\nSauteeing the apples doesn't just cook the apples, it warms the pan.  If you don't like apples you can make a plain pancake, but **YOU HAVE TO WARM THE PAN**. Put the skillet in the oven while it's coming up to temp, pull it out (oven mitts!), dump in the butter then the batter, get it back into the oven. The butter should bubble when you put it in. \n\nIf you grab one of the apples and drag it around the sides and get them all buttered up, that'll help you achieve max. height.\n\nYou can modify this recipe in a bunch of different ways: fry bacon or ham for on the bottom, add Worcestershire/Sriracha to the eggs instead of some of the milk, add grated cheese. \n\nI've done it with peaches, I've added cinnamon or nutmeg or both, I've also poured a bit of maple syrup in over the apples. (Some people add a few TBLS of sugar to the batter. I like to make the fruit sweet and keep the batter rich.)  \n\nThe secret with adding other chunky things, though, is NOT to mix them in with the eggs -- it'll weigh them down and they won't pouf.  \n\nFry up some diced ham, tumble in diced cheddar, shake the pan to get everything settled nicely, then pour the batter in carefully so it sits on top. The cheese will melt over the bottom and make a great crust.\n\nYou can use a metal saucepan if it's heavy, but cast iron is the best. Enameled is great if you have it. Just don't put any meltable/burnable handles in the oven - no wood, no plastic.  \n\n\nThis is the same method, BTW, as popovers. Change the ratios to 4 eggs, 1c. milk, 1c. flour, 1/2 tsp. salt. Put about 1/2 Tbl. of butter in each popover cup. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CAST IRON MUFFIN TIN TO DO THIS. \n\n\nMake sure everyone's sitting at the table ready when you get it out -- it deflates fast!\n\nOK, now I'm all hungry.\n\n\nP.S. USE GOOD EGGS. Factory farmed ones are flat and flabby and watery and smell like fish. A good egg looks like a nice boob -- all plump and round -- and is a deep rich sunny yellow.  \n\nP.P.S (edit) Oh yeah, just remembered another favorite variation: lots of grated orange zest and a shot of Gran Marnier in the batter, fresh lemon juice/powdered sugar on after.\n\n\n\n\n", "[deleted]", "Since i just started with keto i cannot provide you with pictures, but here is the recipe I always used:\n\n* 4 eggs\n\n* 400g flour\n\n* 500ml milk\n\n* 1 small package of vanilla sugar\n\n* a tiny bit of salt\n\n\nSplit egg white and egg yolk.

Fry that shit.\n- balsamic vinegar.  Every good sandwich needs balsamic.  That said, this::sandwich = SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO::bathtub steamboat toy\n- at least two eggs.  Scrambled, sunny side up, poached, who cares\n- mayo\n- anything else you feel like because it's a free country.\n\nMake sure the bacon is nice and crispy and towel dry it well.  Burger:  rare.  That's right, either buy real good beef or suffer the consequences.\n\nRelish the vegans' empty, hungry stares as their mouths water over their barren dishes of soy protein that their unwashed, scraggly-haired, sunken-faced, sallow-skinned Indigo girls-listening unshaven girl-things force them to live off before skulking back to their methane-ridden smugness lairs.", "Grab meat. A whole fucking lot of it. 80/20. Don't get any other kind.\r\nGrab these things-\r\n-Minced onions\r\n-Minced Garlic\r\n-Garlic Salt/ Powder (or both)\r\n-Onion Salt/ Power (or both)\r\n-A1 sauce\r\n-Ground Black Pepper\r\n-Cayenne\r\n-McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning\r\n-McCormick Spicy Montreal Steak\r\n-Beer.'\r\n-Pepper Jack Cheese. Don't get American- use real cheese.\r\n-Bread Crumbs\r\n-An egg probably.\r\n\r\nWhen I make the burgers I start out at half pound of meat a person. This makes it easier to stuff cheese into the middle. Burgers will end up near 10oz each.\r\n\r\nDepending on how much meat you have, pour the whole beer in the mix. I've used a whole beer for 2 1/2 pounds, but it balances pretty ok with 5 pounds. Pictures below will show results of 5 pounds of meat. Use something heavy like DogFish Head Raison D'Etre. That way you actually taste the beer. Dump some bread crumbs in there and be liberal because this meat will be super saturated with beer.\r\n\r\nDump the onions and garlic in. Then dump the onion and garlic powder and salt in. Mix. Mix early, mix often.\r\n\r\nA1 Sauce. Pour this in too. Mix again. Keep dumping bread crumbs. \r\n\r\nPut in the Montreal Steak Seasonings. More of that than the spicy. Or more spicy, whatever.\r\n\r\nAlso put in all the other stuff. Just put it in, mix up the meat. Smell it. That's how I guess when the proportions are right. Smell it anyway, because you're mixing close to 6 pounds now of meat and Angel Blessings. \r\n\r\nBread crumbs. You thought I was kidding when I said a lot. Also probably throw and egg or 2 in to hold it together better. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou should have decided how many people were eating when you started with half pound of meat per person. So 5 pounds = 10 burgers. Split the whole mixture by 10, not by half a pound each. You'll have awkwardly tiny leftovers.\r\n\r\nSplit each burger in half. Form a patty. PULL OUT THE PEPPERJACK. Split it into quarters. stick them in the middle of that burger. Put the other half of the patty on top. Pinch it shut, mold the burger, do whatever it takes to try and keep the burger from splitting when you grill. ***This is why the bread crumbs and egg are important. Without it you'll never be able to make the burgers, they fall apart.***\r\n\r\nThrow those badboys on the grill. We use a charcoal grill because that's what's outside of our apartment, and because charcoal is better. Make a day out of this experience. Grab beer. To drink. A lot of it. Grab friends too. Looks like you've got that planned.\r\n\r\nIt's about 8-10 minutes per side. The beauty of these burgers is that even if you're like \"oh shit I overcooked\" it won't matter. You dropped a whole beer in and a lot of A1 sauce. I did mention to use a lot of A1 right? And a lot of EVERYTHING ELSE TOO.\r\n\r\nNot only will the cheese melt and squeeze out, but the burgers will cry when you bite into them. Sorry I got that mixed up. The burgers will be real juicy, and you will cry. Don't act like you wont. \r\n\r\nHere are some pictures. I've been meaning to make an F7U12D for these for a while but weather and time have not cooperated. \r\n\r\n[Burger patties, not cooked](http://i.imgur.com/9NHNW.jpg)\r\nHere is the [finished result](http://i.imgur.com/f4JC7.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou'll notice in the finished result that the cheese burst out.

Garlic mayo (just a little) is the best condiment I've found for these, ketchup and mustard clash with the flavours already there.

I just noticed this was FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUD! Should I delete this post?**\n\nShe'll probably get sick of straight-up sweet stuff pretty quick, so here's something savory (in spite of the somewhat sweet ingredients!). This is my favorite pur\u00e9ed soup ever. \n\n[Sweet potato, carrot, apple and red lentil soup](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-potato-carrot-apple-and-red-lentil-soup/) from Allrecipes.com. There's a lot of prep work in the chopping, but other than it's easy peasy. \n\nIf you don't have an immersion blender you might want to look into one, especially if you plan on pur\u00e9eing a lot of hot stuff like soups. You don't really want to be messing with hot liquids and a blender on a regular basis.\n\nRecipe's in the link, but here's the c/p:\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1/4 cup butter\n* 2 large sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped\n* 3 large carrots, peeled and chopped\n* 1 apple, peeled, cored and chopped\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 1/2 cup red lentils [you can use regular; the red lentils, though, melt right into everything easily]\n* 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh ginger\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n* 1/2 teaspoon chili powder\n* 1/2 teaspoon paprika\n* 4 cups vegetable broth\n* plain yogurt [note: I think the plain yogurt is crucial to the final flavor. It really rounds it out.]\n\n**Directions**\n\nMelt the butter in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Place the chopped sweet potatoes, carrots, apple, and onion in the pot. Stir and cook the apples and vegetables until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes.\n\nStir the lentils, ginger, ground black pepper, salt, cumin, chili powder, paprika, and vegetable broth into the pot with the apple and vegetable mixture. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the lentils and vegetables are soft, about 30 minutes.\n\nWorking in batches, pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full.  *[This is the part where I use the immersion blender instead.] *Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.\n\nReturn the pureed soup to the cooking pot. Bring back to a simmer over medium-high heat, about 10 minutes. Add water as needed to thin the soup to your preferred consistency. Serve with yogurt for garnish.", "There is a blow job joke in there somewhere..", "Maybe [polenta](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/savory-polenta-recipe/index.html) with some tomato sauce (maybe blend the sauce to avoid chunks) on top?

Simple & tasty (sorry, no comic form of it).", "I am too lazy to actually make a F7U12D comic, but I've been cooking vegetarian for half my life and my food generally goes down well with omnivores. I don't generally use recipes though.\nBut, here's some simple formulas for badass pasta and badass risotto.\n\n- If you're doing risotto, take your rice (there's special risotto rice but I like to use normal brown rice for extra nutrients and a less gooey texture). Melt butter in a pot. Dump in the rice and saute it until you get a nutty smell. If you want to be posh, add some white wine as the first liquid. Otherwise, just use veggie broth. Just add enough to cover the rice and keep adding more as it boils off until the rice is done.\n\n- If you're doing pasta, pick your favorite kind and prepare according to instructions.\n\n- Heat oil in a pan. Add cinnamon and cumin to it. Seriously, do it. Lots of it. You have no idea how well these spices work for Italian cooking.\n\n- Then add diced onions (shallots if you want to be fancy) and garlic.\n\n- Then add any and all veggies you might fancy. My boyfriend likes to cook \"pasta del' orgasmo\" with artichokes, olives (and feta cheese and pesto, but more on those later). I love mushrooms (but he's allergic to them). Eggplant and zucchini are always good candidates. Spring onions work nicely. Green asparagus. Red or orange bell peppers.\n\n- Now dump in the pasta or rice. Mix up. Add a healthy amount of cracked black pepper, and some herbs to taste (mediterranean herbs like thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary work well).\n\n- Add some cheese. For risottos, a cream cheese will work best, I like soft goat's cheese, though feta will also work. For pasta, whatever tickles your fancy from goat's cheese to blue cheese to shredded mozzarella. Mix up and let it melt.\n\n- If you like to, add some fresh rocket or baby spinach, stir in and just let wilt a tiny bit.\n\nPresto! Tastes awesome every time and you can play around with the veggies and cheeses and herbs to get different variations.\n\nI also make a mean veggie lasagna if you're interested. \n"]}

If you don't have a thermometer, lukewarm tap water is about the right temp.  You must get this right because cold water won't activate the yeast, making the bread too hard, and hot water kills the yeast, making it too hard.  Stir in flour, mixing until there are no dry patches. Dough will be quite loose/wet. Cover, but not with an airtight lid. Let dough rise at room temperature 2 hours (or up to 5 hours).\n\nBake at this point or refrigerate, covered, for as long as two weeks. When ready to bake, sprinkle a little flour on dough and cut off a grapefruit-size piece with serrated knife.  \n\nDRY YOUR HANDS or the dough will stick to you and it feels gross.  Coat your hands, the work surface, and the rolling pin if you use it, with flower to keep it from sticking.  add more flower to your hands as needed.  Turn dough in hands to lightly stretch surface, creating a rounded top and a lumpy bottom. Put dough on pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal; let rest 40 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough or refrigerate it.\n\nPlace broiler pan on bottom of oven. Place baking stone on middle rack and turn oven to 450 degrees; heat stone at that temperature for 20 minutes.\n\nDust dough with flour, slash top with serrated or very sharp knife three times. Slide onto stone. Pour one cup hot water into broiler pan and shut oven quickly to trap steam. Bake until well browned, about 30 minutes. Cool completely.

You can put pretty much anything in there you like. I like to put goat cheese, red peppers, and onions. Sometimes I like mushroom, gruyere, and scallions. Do what you like.\n\nSome tips:\n\nBeat your eggs thoroughly. Seriously fuck them up. If you like fluffy omelets, separate the eggs, then beat the whites until fluffy and beat in the yolks after. You might want to add salt to your eggs while beating, since it's granular form will help incorporate air, and your salt will get evenly distributed. About 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. should do it for two eggs. Restaurants serve 3-egg omlets, but that's more food than most people need for one meal.\n\nIf you want to mix in milk, as can help keep your eggs from getting too dry, do it AFTER you beat the eggs.\n\nAs POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY said, don't heat your pan too high. Eggs burn easilly. However unlike him, I would grease the pan with butter. Butter just seems to compliment eggs better in my opinion.\n\nThe best thing you can do to improve your omelet making is to use a non-stick pan. Even a well-greased iron skillet can fuck you up big time. Just don't use a metal spatula in your non-stick pan, or it won't stay non-stick for long (and depending on what it's coated with,  you could release carcinogens).\n\nI would NOT wait until the eggs are completely dry to fold over your omelet, but I would wait almost that long. I don't like a dry omelet. Any runnyness left over should ooze out the sides and cook on the pan. Leave it for a minute or two after you fold if you do this, to make sure it's cooked through.", "I don't always steal cooking advice from others, but when I do it's from Jacques Pepin.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57afEWn-QDg\n\nIf it's not f7u12 enough for you, just pretend that whenever he pronounces something with an accent he's actually looking down upon your inferior American culture. Nothing like a little pretentiousness to put the FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU in fuh-ronse, oui?", "You want an omelet?  Fuck you, you're making 40 and loving them all.  Go get your ass a small goddamned nonstick pan.  THE SMALLEST IS THE BETTER.\n\nBuy a box of butter.  One of the bigger boxes, AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OF PURE DELICIOUS BUTTER.  You might have to order through Sysco, US Foods or another local grocery supply.  The trick is to use a double boiler here: A GALLON OF WATER BOILING BENEATH TEN POUNDS OF YOUR SUPPLY OUGHT TO DO IT.  YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY FUCK THIS PART UP UNLESS YOU ARE A MAJOR TOOL.  Once your butter is melted, there will be a foam at the top.  THIS FOAM IS AN ENEMY AND MUST BE ERADICATED, WHILE PRESERVING THE DELICIOUS BUTTER OIL.  At the bottom, there are some milk solid little bitches. BITCHES LOVE FILTERS.  Now that your butter oil is filtered, there's still some water in there, fucking your girlfriend.  EVAPORATE THAT SON OF A BITCH WATER, FOR IT IS TASTELESS AND USELESS AND IS FUCKING YOUR GIRLFRIEND IN FRONT OF YOU WITHOUT SHAME.\n\nNow that your butter is clarified, we can move on to the omelet.  Dr. Allcaps likes his omelets with some shitty green oil and as a completely different style of omelet.  That's okay, as I respect the differences, but the inferior method is saddening to my emotions, knowing that nobody else taught you how to do this shit properly.  Shhh, shhh, daddy's here for you baby.  His heart is in the right place, but we're going to do the rest of this right.\n\nDepending on the size of your pan, 4 eggs may be too many.  The remaining ingredients (OLIVE OIL?  THAT'S GREEK TO ME) are also correct, EXCEPT THAT BLACK PEPPER LOOKS LIKE RAT SHIT, SO USE THE WHITEST FUCKING PEPPER YOU HAVE AND MAKE SURE TO BLEND EVERYTHING PERFECTLY.  DON'T BEAT AIR INTO THAT SHIT, BECAUSE AIR DOESN'T HAVE ANY FLAVOR UNLESS YOU LIVE ON RAINBOW ISLAND, JUST OFF THE COAST OF SUNSHINE HARBOR.\n\nCRANK YOUR STOVETOP UP TO 11 AND PLACE YOUR PAN ON THE FLAMES OF GLORY WITH ENOUGH CLARIFIED BUTTER TO COAT THE BOTTOM.  When that bitch starts spitting, it's time to put your goo down her top.  SPITTERS ARE QUITTERS AND MAKE THAT PAN PAY.  At this point, you're going to freak the fuck out, BUT I NEED YOU TO CALM THE FUCK DOWN AND LISTEN.  FAST.  GO! FUCKING GO!  YOUR OMELET IS GOING TO BE BROWNER THAN YOUR TIGHTY FUCKING WHITIES IF YOU DO NOT MOVE FUCKING FAST.  YOUR RUBBER-TIPPED SPATULA!  USE IT TO STIR THAT SHIT UP WHILE YOU SHAKE THE PAN LIKE A BABY'S RATTLE.  TURN THE HEAT DOWN TO MEDIUM FUCKING HIGH.  YOU'RE NOT THE GODDAMNED FLASH HERE, AND THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME.  YOUR EGG LIQUID ON TOP NEEDS TO HIT THAT PAN AS SOON AS YOU MOVE YOUR EGG.  Once it settles, you can unclench your ass, but so help me FSM, you need to finish this like a champ.  Is it still only yellow?  That's what it should look like.  Is it all runny on top? YOU SHAME YOUR PARENTS.  ROLL THAT SHIT OFF THE PAN AND LET CARRYOVER COOKING FINISH THE INSIDES.

Buy the following shits:\n\n* Tortillas (flour, because they fucking rule)\n\n* Two red boiling potatoes (you can use others, but I can get 6 burritos from two small red potatoes)\n\n* Bacon (as much as you like - I use a strip per burrito)\n\n* Eggs, scrambled, seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and a tablespoon of water (half a dozen - again, estimate one egg per burrito)\n\n* A tablespoon or so of butter\n\n1) Fry up that bacon like a boss over medium heat in a cast iron pan. [](/fyeah) If anything, you'll season your cast iron pan for future awesome burritos. While the bacon fries, dice up the potatoes into small cubes about the size of a chapstick lid. That's the first thing I saw on my desk at work. You don't like it, fuck off. [](/rtroll)\n\n2) Remove the bacon to a paper towel. You're gonna crumple that shit up into your burritos later. [](/son \"I hope you made an extra slice or two because who the fuck doesn't eat extra bacon?\") Turn the heat up to medium high, and throw your diced potatoes in there. Don't add any salt or pepper. That'll just create extra moisture, and the potatoes will be all soggy. You want that fucking crust, right? Don't add the fucking salt yet. [](/why \"Jesus.\") Just let those potatoes sit and create a nice seared crust.\n\n3) While those potatoes sizzle away, warm a nonstick pan up over medium low heat. I cook my eggs in a nonstick pan because it's fucking easy to clean up. If you want to use your cast iron, be my guess, but it can be a pain to clean. It's your time, waste it how you choose. Toss that butter in there. When it's foamy, throw in your eggs. Cook them while stirring with a spatula.\n\n4) After a decent sear has been created on those potatoes, flip them over. After 2-3 minutes, feel free to add all the salt and pepper you want. It'll taste fucking delicious.[](/fap)\n\n5) Go back to your eggs. Are they scrambled? Good. Are they already cooked in the pan? [](/poker) YOU DONE FUCKED UP. Before those eggs are done in the pan, remove them from the heat. They'll have some carryover cooking and can sit in the warm pan while your potatoes finish.\n\n6) Just before everything is done, throw some tortillas in the microwave for about 20 seconds. You don't want hard tortillas, or the fuckers will break when you try to fold them. Then you will be all [](/omg)\n\n7) Toss all of your ingredients in those warm tortillas. The potatoes should be crusty, the bacon will be crispy, and your eggs will be fucking delicious. Consume that shit, and celebrate.

When your timer goes off, drain pasta and set aside.\n\n3) Brown your chicken strips in a saute pan with a little olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder until they are golden brown and delicious. \n\n4) In a wide saute pan add the stick of butter, 1 c milk, and the block of cream cheese on medium heat. Use a whisk and stir together until smooth. Slowly add 1 c of the grated parmesan. I like to do this in 3 batches and whisking until smooth.\n\n5)At this point your done! Toss pasta, chicken and broccoli into the sauce and eat!\n\n6) If you want to finish this in the oven for a more mellow alfredo flavor, add your pasta to a 9x13 in baking dish and pour the alfredo sauce over the pasta. Mix in the broccoli and the chicken strips. Combine the 3/4 remaining parmesan and 3/4 bread crumbs together and sprinkle over the top of the dish.

I'll get to that later.\n\n*Here goes, make sure you have everything handy (mis-en-place is the shit, yo):*\nThrow some of your favorite cooking oil in a pan (wok is perfect) and heat it up, put one sliver of the onion into the oil to see when it's hot enough, when small bubbles start appearing around the edges and you hear that typical frying sound chuck in the rest of the onion, fry the onion on a medium heat until they go a little soft, now chuck in the eggplant and peppers don't wait too long because these things need a while to soften and you don't want to burn the onion, turn up the heat a little and add a couple of tablespoons of soy sauce and a couple of dashes of worcestershire until everything is coated nicely. Toss that shit up. Give it a little fry until the peppers go soft. When you think it's almost ready throw in the garlic, beans sprouts and cucumber because those don't really need to cook very long at all basically just heat them and get some of the garlic aroma in the veggies. Add about two tablespoons of honey and a few dashes of lemon juice. Sprinkle on cayenne pepper and whatever other nice asian spice you have (ginger powder works awesomely well but just a tiny bit). Toss it up some more until the honey and sauce has coated everything and it starts to throw thick bubbles (not too long or you'll burn it, go with your gut). Take a few pieces and see how it tastes. Not sweet enough: More honey, honey. Not salty enough: More Soy, atta boy! Find your balance and throw in more spice powders and so on until you're ready to stick your face in the pan.\n\nCook your rice however you like, I use a small sidebowl and fill it with rice. I poor the rice into a pot and then use the same bowl to get twice the amount of water onto the rice (1 bowl of rice, two bowls of water -stupid). I like to put in a good pinch of salt (some people prefer it without but screw those assholes). Place the rice onto your stove and set to a boil. Once the rice is bubbling away nicely set a timer for ten minutes (or look at your watch). Once the rice has bubble cooked for about ten minutes simply cover the pot and place it somewhere on your counter, the rice will steam from the residual heat and is pretty much done by now. After about ten minutes of steaming take a fork and stir through the rice thoroughly once to loosen it up and then cover for another ten minutes. (If you start cooking the stir fry right after you've taken the rice off the stove you can use the same heating element and will be done right when the rice is ready).\n\nFollow the recipe, find a few nice recepticles (plates, bowls, empty cat food tins) and spoon in your rice, top that off with the stirfry and dig in. Drink whatever you like with that I'm not your doctor. I love a good cold cider or ginger ale but since your fridge is broken I guess you're screwed :D\n\nAnother tip for your fridge is to wipe the whole thing out with disinfectant (well you probably have done that), follow it up by wiping it with (I kid you not) a nice strong vinegar. Rinse or wipe thoroughly after that. Then (and now you think I'm nuts) place a large bowl of roasted ground coffee into the fridge (it needs to be off and the door needs to stay shut for at least 8 hours). The acid in the vinegar will kill of most biological odors and once you've removed the vinegar from the fridge the coffee will give it a delicious smell. This is something you normally do to a car that had a little \"accident\" (I swear officer that's how I found her).\n\nTell me if that worked out for you.

At this point it should be quite thin, more like a broth, not thick like gravy (that part comes later).A few hours later, add at least couple cups of peeled smallish shrimp. They'll pretty much disappear and that's okay.\n\nThis is the first layer that cooks pretty much all day. It'll be medium-dark in color and will crust over as it cooks.

Chop up more onion, celery, okra, fresh tomato and toss it in. By this time it should be almost black.. that's what you want. Swamp juice! Toss in a few blue crab bodies, more shrimp, and any other seafood you're fond of.

If it's smoking, it's too hot and you screwed up, son.  Start over.  Begin to know shame.\n\n3.

We're looking for flavor here.\n\nHave another shot, you'll need it for this next step.\n\nAdd the juice from the orange into the pot. Definitely not the easiest thing in the world if you don't have something that looks like a juicer, whatever the fuck that is. Tip: putting it in a freezer bag and stomping on it doesn't work. A trip to the garage for a pair on C-clamps and a couple of chunks of fresh clean pine board did seem to get the job done, though.\n\n\nNow, add the sugar and ginger to the pot and turn on the fire kinda low.\n\nHave another shot and mop up the orange juice off the kitchen floor.\nBy the time you're done with that the sugar will have melted and you'll have something in the bottom of the pan that looks like runny marmalade and pretty much tastes the same.\n\nBefore the sugar starts burning, frantically pull the bags of cranberries out of the fridge, wash 'em and measure out 8 cups.\nA coffee cup will do if you're not a caffeine junkie with a quart jug. Now pour them into the pot with the marmalade.\n\nPour yourself another shot and relax for a moment. At least until you realize the pot isn't big enough, so pull down a bigger pot and transfer all the contents, making sure you get all the goo out of the old pot.\n\nNow you just have to wait, stir and simmer until all the cranberries pop open.\n\n\nHave another shot.\n\n\nGive it a real good stir and make sure all the berries have popped open, but you don't have to make a federal production out of it.\n\n\nHave another shot, turn off the heat.
