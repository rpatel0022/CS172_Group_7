This seems to help reduce the potentially bony smell which can come with making a raw bone broth (even when using 'good' bones and soaking the bones before in cold water and skimming the scum or throwing that first boiled batch of water out)?

I believe in these unpredictable times it gives ppl a feeling of comfort to know they have at least one great meal a week figured out.\n\n You can gift those patrons that purchase these packages a (small) ramen-box at the beginning of each month.

At the table are syringes which you can use to inject some extra flavor mid meal giving diners multiple ways to enjoy their ramen.[https://goo.gl/maps/KL7XVNjSLAhCnqti8](https://goo.gl/maps/KL7XVNjSLAhCnqti8)\n\nShio Ramen: Mendokoro Shirokuro  \nWhat I loved about Shirokuro is their broth which is made using only seafood ingredients such as kombu dried kelp and shellfish. The flavor extraction is pretty insane when you realize there's no animal products used in the broth and makes you appreciate the bowl even more.[https://g.page/soba\\_shirokuro?share](https://g.page/soba_shirokuro?share)\n\nMiso Ramen: Asahi Chounaikai  \nAsahi Chounaikai is a miso ramen shop using the techniques started and perfected by Junren and Sumire of Hokkaido.

Probably one of the richest Tonkotsu Ramen I've ever had, Umaiyo Yuchan Ramen really raises the bar for anyone even considering making this style.[https://goo.gl/maps/37y9V32wKwgtBzq8A](https://goo.gl/maps/37y9V32wKwgtBzq8A)\n\nNiboshi Ramen: Niboshi Chuka Yoin  \nMaster at Yoin was already well known as the founder of Kaigaraya, a popular oyster ramen shop in Kanagawa, but he decided he needed a new challenge and opened Yoin, a Niboshi specialty restaurant. I love Niboshi and this sort of deep, super impactful dried fish broth is what I crave. Really well made and the color is just phenomenal.[https://goo.gl/maps/3MGEjkzgW5eT8VsX7](https://goo.gl/maps/3MGEjkzgW5eT8VsX7)\n\nJiro/Jiro-kei: Buta Kaze  \nA former apprentice at Buta Boshi, a legendary Jiro-kei shop in Kanagawa, master at Buta Kaze has a star studded resume in Jiro ramen making. Bringing along his experience to Hatanodai, he is slowly becoming a Jiro-kei star in his own right.[https://goo.gl/maps/vQaqkQbrp87cbSox7](https://goo.gl/maps/vQaqkQbrp87cbSox7)\n\nIekei: Tokyo Iekei Ramen Oudouya  \nMaster of Oudouya, Shimizu-san, was originally one of the 4 kings of Iekei ramen having trained directly under Yoshimura-ya, the inventor of the style. He decided to branch out on his own and had his \"4 king\" title stripped, but is still one of the most recognizable names in Iekei ramen.

After hiding out and perfecting a new recipe, he finally opened Hikage and has been a huge hit.

This releases most of the water from the veggies while creating more surface area. Adding a pinch of baking soda raises the pH and further speeds up Maillard browning. I also add ground pork to this mixture and brown the heck out of it (this takes about 8 minutes).\n\nThen, chicken stock and gelatin go in and get cooked for 10 minutes to extract the flavor from the browned pork and aromatics. The gelatin creates the texture of dissolved collagen in a bone broth simmered for hours. This gets strained and then emulsified with Saikyo miso, shiitake powder, and katsuobushi powder.\n\nThe resulting tsukemen broth ends up super concentrated flavor and umami and it is very rich.\u00a0 The thing is this method should work for almost any style of ramen so I\u2019m going to be working on other versions soon. Any requests?\u00a0\n\nIf you want a full recipe, I've [posted one here](https://norecipes.com/tsukemen-dipping-ramen/) and you can check out a [video of the process](https://youtu.be/FHfijubytUo).", "God tier shortcuts.\n\nLove it", "[removed]", "Amazing!

The resulting soup is very rich and well seasoned, although not as creamy as some other places like Tanaka Shoten or some places I had tried in Kyushu. There are a lots of things on the counter to make the bowl your own, like sprouts marinated in spicy sesame oil, spicy greens, pickled ginger and many other things.

It\u2019s possible the person they source their truffles from didn\u2019t have as big a haul as they usually do. Or it could be that the amount they produce daily is what is budgeted so the restaurant makes a profit on that dish. It can even be as simple as a chef saying \u201cI want to make this many every day and that\u2019s it.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s also just the simple fact that when something is only available in limited quantities it compels people to come back in hopes of trying that dish. \n\nThe chefs at my restaurant only prepare a certain amount of ingredients every day. This ensures that we are selling the freshest and most consistent dishes possible. Before we begin service we receive counts on menu items so we are aware of what is available to sell that evening. We are then updated throughout dinner service as we sell out of those items.

I'd cool it in the liquid and under a little bit of weight if possible to even the texture and absorb the flavor. At least to room temp if not overnight under refrigeration.

I ultimately decided to leave cooking in favor of something that pays more and holds more promise for the future, but making a living on ramen is possible, some friends from my old shop are still doing it happily.

Not the absolute best in the bay but one that def understands and uses the traditional principles of good ramen.\n\nId strongly reccomend following ramen_lord, noodleinahaystack, nichiju.ramen among other us based ramen instagram accounts for ideas and inspiration on bringing in income from ramen outside of the traditional path of working at ramen shops, starting as a grunt worker, moving up to chef/manager etc etc and eventually leaving to start your own shop. The inspiration you can glean from those fellas in that regard will be very valuble. If you havent already, start an ig account and start posting your ramen. I can mine a list of all ramen and Japanese food accts i follow and send em to ya if u are not plugged into that world yet.\n\nMake sure to read ramen lords reddit posts and ig posts like a textbook. Alot of what i know i learned from him.

This recipe is an homage to that.\n\nAs an aside, these components can also be found in [my free e-book](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qLPoLxek3WLQJDtU6i3300_0nNioqeYXi7vESrtNvjQ/edit?usp=sharing) (shameless plug #1). But I\u2019m happy to answer questions here as well. Let\u2019s jump into it.\n\n**Soup:**\n\nThe soup is a clear pork bone soup mounted with classic Japanese fish and aromatic flavors. It\u2019s relatively simple to put together, but does hinge on those Japanese flavors.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 3 lbs femur bones\n* 3 L water\n* Half a carrot\n* Cabbage pieces\n* 8 cloves Garlic\n* Greens of a green onion\n* 30 G Niboshi\n* 15 G Kombu\n* 15 g katsuobushi\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Add bones to the pot with water, bring up to a boil over high heat\n2. When boiling, skim the scum that rises to the surface. Continue to boil until little to no scum remains, around 20 minutes\n3. Turn the heat to low, and let the pork bones cook at a bare simmer (190F or so), 7 hours.\n4. In the last hour, add all remaining ingredients, let steep for 1 hour.\n5. Strain the soup and reserve until needed. Each bowl gets 300 ml, dilute the soup to have a total amount of 3L.\n\n**Tare:**\n\nThe tare is a cooked miso tare, with a relatively low miso flavor as a result, the cooking process sending off volatile flavor compounds. The goal here is to cook out the alcohol, and most of the fruitiness of the miso. This is, ironically, much easier to do at home than it is in bigger quantity. So, yay for us home cooks!\n\nSince the miso is cooked, feel free to buy sub-par miso for this. We\u2019re not as much interested In nuanced miso complexity (like we are with my ramen\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 125 g white miso\n* 125 g red miso\n* 25 g mirin\n* 50 g sake\n* 25 g soy sauce\n* 10 g tahini\n* 6 g salt\n* 6 g MSG\n* 15 ml vegetable oil\n* Pinch Black pepper\n* Pinch of Togarashi\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl.\n2. Add to a nonstick skillet, and cook, over medium low heat, until the smell of alcohol evaporates, and the paste turns thicker in texture, around 15-20 minutes.\n3. Allow to cool, then transfer to a container to store in the fridge. Reserve indefinitely in the fridge.\n\nAdd 60 g of tare per 300 mL soup.\n\n**Akayu Spice Ball:**\n\nThis is really the defining characteristic of the style, and why I wanted to make this in the first place. It\u2019s pretty versatile, and you can add as much or as little of the ball as you like. Since the salt content isn\u2019t as high as the tare, however, it doesn\u2019t keep as long. Freeze it if not using within 5 days or so.\n\nIngredients\n\n* 80 g garlic\n* 40 g Thai Bird Chilis (other fresh red chilis would also work here)\n* 5 g Vegetable oil\n* Optional: 3 g Fish Powder\n* 60 g White Miso\n* 60 g brown miso\n* 10 g fine Korean Chili powder (add more for more heat)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Combine the garlic and chilis in the bowl of a food processor. Process until a fine paste.\n2. Add the paste to a skillet with the oil, and cook over medium heat, until the garlic\u2019s pungency has subsided considerably, and the vegetables have released most of their moisture, around 5 minutes\n3. Add the fish powder if using, bloom it with the chili and garlic mixture over medium heat, around 1 minute.\n4. Combine the garlic/chili paste with the remaining ingredients.\n\nUse around 30-40 g per bowl (but personal preference rules here) \n\n(noodles and toppings in next comment)", "Very cool! So how do people eat this dish? Are you supposed to slowly dissolve the spice ball with the noodles and the soup or is it more like it\u2019s own topping?", "I remember seeing on your Instagram that you've been refining your normal miso recipe since you posted it originally 5 years ago. \n\n\nI'd love to see how the recipe had changed over the years. Is the updated recipe in the e-book or do you have plans for the soon?", "Would you happen or be able to convert the recipe to an instant pot?", "Spicy miso ramen is my favorite - I can't wait to try this very different take on similar ingredients.", "[deleted]", "Thank you for including the entire recipe and links to your free eBook.", "thank you much! will be trying this out!", "You're such a badass UwU", "I made the miso tare and spicy ball today and OMG. I had all of the ingredients for the tare and spicy ball on hand, but no chashu or pork broth. Instead,  I used a tori paitan broth that I made and put in the freezer a month or so ago. \n\nDefinitely making again with the proper broth and chashu. Love how the soup transforms as you eat it thanks to the spice ball. Thanks for sharing!", "Hi Mike. Thanks for great recipe. Just want to double check, dilute the strained soup with water to make it 3L again?", "looks good", "Woah, looks awesome. Might give the recipe a go", "Amazing stuff, I\u2019ll probably spend the winter break making pots of ramen!", "New recipe!!! Can't wait to give this one a try. As always, thanks for all the work that you do!", "\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29", "This sounds amazing, thank you for including the recipe!  I\u2019m gonna check out your book for sure.", "would the spice ball work in other styles of ramen?  like in a tonkatsu?", "I\u2019m sad that I can\u2019t find a single instructional video in English for this style of ramen on YouTube.", "Hi there.\nSo I had some frozen tonkotsu left and decided to give this tare (and akayu spice ball) a shot, although the recipe calls for chintan. Well...that did not go well lol. The 300ml/60g soup to tare ratio was an absolute overkill, even for an avid salt lover such as myself. It was EXTREMELY salty. I had to cut down tare at least by half or so to make soup edible. I am not trying to question the recipe, but rather curious what could possibly go wrong on my end. Could I not cook off tare enough? Or could miso paste brands vary that drastically in salinity? Or my kitchen scale played me like a fiddle))\nAnyways after tweeking ratios a bit, this ended up being quite nice.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/FRfAYE9", "Sweet!", "Incredible!

I\u2019ve never been happy with my attempts at smoked chashu tbh. I\u2019m wondering how you got things to be falling apart at an internal temp of 145F though ? Ordinarily, internal temp must go a lot higher before connective tissue and fat begins to break down - 160 to 180 with most cuts being pulled off the smoker at around 195-205. Ive taken rolled Chashu to around 185 before and found that it had taken on an almost bacon like texture and wasn\u2019t tender at all. I think my next idea would be to put in the smoker rolled and sitting in the braising liquid in a pot for the entire cook and take it further to 200ish\n\nEDIT - and now I\u2019ve realised you meant that the belly was falling apart ! And not the shoulder. Makes more sense, as the smaller cut it probably raced up to 180 plus and with its high content of fat to meat explains why it was falling apart"]}

This is by no means \"traditional,\" but it mimics the one I like at my favorite at Izakaya Ajido, located in Torrance, CA.\n\nI'll post this later in the sub when I make it again, but my secret to this **making your own \"Chili Crisp Blend\".** I don't risk making the actual chili oil since I have little kids around and I don't have time to boil spicy things AND oil, but this works just as well, and gets you really good results!\n\nGo to your local Asian grocer, or even the \"Asian\" aisle of your megamarket, and just pick up all the different small bottles of chili oil, chili crisp, etc. (Make sure they are all *oils* not the chunky sambal type sauce). By combining 3-4 different types in large 32oz mason jar, it really helps balance out spiciness, salt, crunch, etc. You can play around with the different types, but here's the four I usually add\n\n[Lao Gan Ma Spicy Chili Crisp](https://www.amazon.com/Spicy-Chili-Crisp-Oil-Sauce/dp/B00MLO0VYS/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2B2BQPETQQ91X&dchild=1&keywords=la+gan+ma+chili+crisp&qid=1610082298&s=grocery&sprefix=la+gan+%2Cgrocery%2C206&sr=1-7) (for crunchiness)  \n\n[Lee Kum Kee Chiu Chow Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Lee-Kum-Kee-Chili-7-2oz/dp/B0000CNU15) (for umami)  \n\n[Ning Chi](https://yummybazaar.com/products/ning-chi-spicy-chili-oil-taiwans-hottest-chili-sauce-8-6-oz-245ml) or [Dynasty Chili Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Dynasty-Hot-Chili-Oil-5-25/dp/B004VEA96G) (for heat)  \n\n[S&B Japanese Crunchy Garlic Chili Oil](https://www.amazon.com/chili-oil-Crunchy-Garlic-Pack/dp/B01KYQX8CQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=crunchy+garlic+japanese&qid=1610082509&s=grocery&sr=1-2) (for sweet garlickyness). \n\nThis stuff works great on everything. Eggs. Pizza. Burrata. Pasta. Plus now you can make Mapo Tofu!\n\n**Quick Tantanmen Recipe**\n\n*Broth*  \n12oz of low sodium chicken stock  \n\n1 packet of unflavored gelatin  \n\n2 cloves of garlic, peeled and slightly smashed open  \n\n1 inch of ginger, sliced not peeled  \n\n1 carrot, rinsed, broken in half not peeled)  \n\n1 celery, stick broken in half  \n\n2 green onions, whole w/ roots removed  \n3\" piece of kombu  \n\nSmall pinch of large katsuobushi flakes  \n\nOptional: rotisserie chicken bones (see below)  \n\nVERY optional: tiniest pinch, just a few granules, of Aji-No-Moto \n\n*Chicken*  \n- The key to the \"30 Min\" version is using leftover rotisserie chicken. Take a 1/2 cup of meat off the bones, then set aside meat and add bones to broth as well.\nIf you don't have the whole chicken, any leftover chicken works, just chop it so it heats up in the broth.\n\n*Spicy Sauce*  \n1/4 cup Home Chili Crisp Blend (more or less to your taste)   \n\n1 tsp agave syrup, honey, or sugar  \n\n1-2 tablespoon soy sauce, to taste  \n\n1-2 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar, to taste  \n\n1 tablespoon Chinese dark sesame paste\n\n*Dan Dan-style Ground Meat Topping*  \n1/3 lb ground beef or pork  \n\npinch of salt + dash of white pepper  \n\n1 tablespoon crushed garlic  \n\n1 tablespoon grated ginger  \n\n1 tablespoon chopped Chinese Mustard Root [(Zha Cai)](https://www.amazon.com/Chongqing-yuquan-Preserved-Mustard-Vegetable/dp/B0774ZQBCX/ref=pd_vtp_325_3/142-0301492-2853777?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0774ZQBCX&pd_rd_r=0175d1cb-0364-4246-a4b6-5c6baeaa1dc3&pd_rd_w=IV0zE&pd_rd_wg=bgO4f&pf_rd_p=4f2ab3e8-468a-4a7c-9b91-89d6a9221c29&pf_rd_r=J6WKJAV5CPH6ZNM9CP8G&psc=1&refRID=J6WKJAV5CPH6ZNM9CP8G)   \n\n1 tablespoon scallion whites  \n\n1 tablespoon ground Szechuan peppercorn\n\n*Other Toppings*  \n1 bunch baby bok choy, rinsed and cut into large pieces  \n1 handful spinach, rinsed\n\n*Noodles*  \n- I always keep either some frozen Ramen (Sun Noodle is best if you can find it) or frozen Hawaiian Saimin noodles. Use whatever you got!\n\n*Directions*\n\nPrep everything and set aside into groups. Doing all the prep first will make things easier as the assembly move quick and there are several things going at the same time.\n\nBring a small pot with water to a boil on a separate burner, keeping at a rolling boil for noodles. \n\nIn a different small saucepan, combine ingredients for broth (stock, gelatin, garlic, ginger, carrot, celery, green onion, kombu, katsuobushi flakes, bones, Aji-No-Moto if using), bring to a slow simmer over low heat partially covered.\n\nIn your ramen bowl, combine ingredients for Spicy Sauce, mix and adjust to taste. Should be intense but balanced to your taste between heat, sour, and saltiness. \n\nHeat up a wok, when it starts to smoke, wilt baby bok choy for 2 min, then add spinach for 30 seconds. Make sure to keep the bok choy stalks crispy! Remove greens from the wok and set aside to use as toppings\n\nBring wok back to high heat. When smoking add 2 tablespoon vegetable oil, then ground meat, salt, and white pepper, breaking up into little granular pieces. When pink is almost gone, add garlic, ginger, Zha Cai, scallion whites, and Szechuan peppercorn. Stir fry for 1 minute until fragrant, then add to the ramen bowl. Stir meat mixture and spicy sauce until thoroughly combined. \n\nCook noodles in boiling water. \n\nWhen noodles are 2 minutes away from being done, add pulled / chopped leftover chicken to your ramen bowl. Pour hot broth through a fine mesh strainer into ramen bowl over the chicken, ground meat, spicy sauce, stir gently to combine and to heat chicken through.\n\nWhen noodles are finished, add to the bowl, along with 2 tablespoons of the starchy water (helps add a bit of thickener, and keeps thing warm). Stir gently to break up noodles and incorporate starch water.\n\nTop with cooked bok choy, spinach, then add scallion greens, a dash of more ground Szechuan peppercorn, a dash of Chinese Five Spice Powder, sesame seeds.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nEdit: formatted for easier reading", "How ? whats in it ?

They are doing this quite successfully and have the long lines in front of their doors to prove it. While their classic Jangara tonkotsu ramen is a more mild version of tonkotsu, their Bonshan tonkotsu and Kobonshan sport super rich and porky flavors. The Kobonshan is even topped with roasted garlic oil for that extra punch of aroma. \n\nIf you are a first time customer, I recommend you to go for the Bonshan with all their toppings, just so you can experience the full width of flavors of this tonkotsu ramen bowl. \n\nAfter you get a bit tired of the flavor, definitely make use of the many many condiments that are available to you. My recommendation is to go for some sesame, a bit of vinegar and some fresh garlic once you are halfway into your ramen bowl. Definitely refreshes the flavor and gives it a whole new twist. There is also nothing wrong with turning it into a spicy tonkotsu, as that seems to be all the rage recently abroad.

(There is a \u201cskin\u201d between the shell and the egg, you want to get under that and the shell comes off super easy.)\n- marinate in a plastic snap lock bag over night\n\nAs someone mentioned, these weren\u2019t marinated long enough, but I felt like ramen and figured they would still be ok.", "I've always wondered what do you do to give it that brown exterior?

I thought this was a bluff, but I felt challenged. So, I woke up at 5 am for a 10 hour tonkotsu stock. 5 hour braised chashu pork shoulder. Wood ear mushrooms, bok choy, 2 day ajitama, and Ramen Lord's tonkotsu tare. Best bowl I've ever made.", "It's nothing fancy when I break it down because I find \"proper\" ramen recipes really technical but here goes:\n\nI used probably 2lbs of pigs' feet (3 small cryocav packages) and 1lb of pigs' breast bones. This was an expensive stock, around $20 CAD, and at the end I had reduced it significantly for two heaping bowls with a modest bowl's amount left over.\n\nStock: \n\n1. Cover the bones with enough water to submerge and bring to a rapid boil for 5-10 mins. Dump the scum down the drain. A lot of people now say to scrub the bones. We don't have time for that and I've tried both ways. I don't scrub. \n\n2. Throw the bones back in the pot, add enough water to boil, and put a lid on. Meanwhile, chunk up one whole onion, one bunch of green onion, and one whole head of garlic. Roast these briefly in a pan until slightly browned. This is an unorthodox step, but when this is done add the ingredients to the pot and add a little more water if necessary. This will add complexity to the stock. Wait ten hours or even up to 12. Ramen Lord has done 18. How hungry are you?\n\nTare:\n\nI attempted to follow Ramen Lord's recipe, but I was out of Niboshi and felt like I was going through a lot of soy, so I made this Frankenstein tare and it was delicious. \n\n1. Soak some kombu in just enough cold water to cover. The longer you leave it the better, but the minimum I would say is 3 hours. I don't do measurements. Not a lot. Not a little. Use your judgment. \n\n2. Once kombu has soaked, bring the heat up to just under a boil and let it steep without boiling for another 15 mins. Remove it.\n\n3. Add some bonito flakes and (my secret) two drops of fish sauce and one small (tip of your pinky) amount of frozen and minced anchovy. I keep the anchovy pellets in the freezer. Let that simmer for another 15 minutes. Strain your liquid.\n\n4. Now, you can either (in a sauce pot) put soy, sake, and mirin OR you can use some of your egg marinade (see below). I used egg marinade. I used about 20 teaspoons, just eyeing it. Tare is all about personal preference. Once your soy mixture is in the pot, boil it briefly to remove any alcohol if it has rice vinegar in it. Add your kombu and bonito liquid and let the flavours marry. Bonus points if you want to add some roughly chopped garlic and ginger to infuse. Season liberally with sea salt and a bit of msg until it's too salty to eat on its own.\n\nChashu:\n\nI won't use pork belly again for my homemade chashu because this was delicious, but be warned: You'll get chunks of meat and not neat little circles.\n\n1. Debone the shoulder and trim the fat a bit if there's loads. If the chashu is extra thick you'll have to run a knife along the middle to butterfly sections out. You should get two or three pieces you can roll up.\n\n2. Use butcher's twine and roll your logs up.\n\n3. Warm some sesame oil or oil of your choosing in a pan and roast the logs until they get a nice crisp. Then cover with water, bring to a simmer, put the lid on, and walk away for two hours. \n\n4. After the two hours, dump the water and keep the chashu in the pot. Add to it: one cup soy, 3 c. water, 3 green onions roughly chopped, a knob of ginger roughly chopped skin on, 3 cloves of garlic roughly chopped. The chashu doesn't need to be submerged, but you will need to turn it every half hour-45 mins. on its next journey of 3 hours.\n\n5. Enjoy. You have chashu with a delicious and flavourful outer crust and a juicy core that's complimented by soft fat. \n\nAjitama:\n\n1. Eggs from the fridge go 7 mins. into boiling water. Shock them with ice water (or cold water) at the end. Peel them. Run under the tap to get microscopic shells off and then place in a bowl with enough liquid to cover. Adjust a ratio of soy sauce, mirin, rice wine vinegar, and water until it's to your tastes. I sometimes add garlic. I'm not sure if it does anything or not. I find a perfect egg is 2 days in the fridge, but I've done 3, and it's still just as delicious.\n\nNoodles:\n\nCome on. I wasn't making noodles too. I'm just an amateur.", "Yooooooooo", "Insanly good", "I am envious as the cook of my home and I cannot make ramen this good!!", "Looks mouth watering yummmm!", "I lost", "Looks amazing \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc", "Insanly good", "How insane?

You can reduce that time, if you want your eggs to have less solid yolk, but I prefer it that way. \n\nNow here's the important part:\n\nBefore the timer reaches 7:15, you should've prepared a big bowl with ice water. That's cold water with ice cubes in it. Remove the eggs from the hot water immediately and let them cool down completely, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nI use equal parts of soy sauce and Mirin as a marinade. After cooling down the eggs, peel them and put them in the marinade. \n\nAnd now here's the second most important part:\n\nLet the eggs marinate for a couple of hours and then remove them from the marinade. Put them in a container and let them cool for an additional 24 hours!\n\nMost people boil the eggs, peel them, out them in the marinade for a couple of hours and then slice them in half the same day. You will NEVER get an Ajitama with a solid yolk if you're not willing to wait.\n\nSometimes it has to be a quick meal though.

Pull from water and drop into a ice bath. I\u2019ve found the high boil for four minutes helps make the peeling process super easy. I marinate in chashu for a minimum of 24 hours. Max 48.

Even though it's written in spanish I'm so proud of the results and wish one day it would be available in english.\r  \n\r  \nYou'll see I've got almost no posts on this account, even though I used to publish with another one, u/elwing80 an account I'm not able to recover the password from (anyway, I prefer my actual username), and I'm also on Instagram under the name [donramen\\_es](https://www.instagram.com/donramen_es/).\r  \n\r  \nFirst of all, I would like to thank many people on this subreddit. Even though I started cooking japanese food more than 20 years ago I didn't get interested in ramen until around 2013-2014. This subreddit has been an unvaluable source of information which helped me take the steps to get where I stand today. Specifically, I'd like to thank u/ramen_lord because not only his old recipes here, but his book and posts on Instagram have been really helpful all these years. In fact, Mike Satinover appears on the book when talking about some of the techniques, being thankful is important to me.\r  \n\r  \nA few years ago I started buying all the japanese books I could, checking several japanese youtube accounts related to ramen and also started once more taking japanese lessons, which I quit several times since I was like fifteen years old. My main source of income ain't cooking ramen or japanese food, and even if every now and then I teach or do some showcookings on events, I do not plan to work on it professionally (too old for this shit, they say). \r  \n\r  \nAbout the book, it's a hardcover, fullcolor 220 page long book with about 2/3 of it centered about history, tools, regional ramen, techniques and the last third with several recipes. I tried to avoid one thing I saw on most ramen books, which is the need to add lots of different ramen recipes which feel like designed for the need to fill a long book. Also, something I've missed on those books is a good photography job, so we took care of it and the results were amazing. I also avoided cheating, as of making faux elaborations just so they look good in a photo. In fact, my four year old daughter ate the ramen which is on the cover.\r  \n\r  \nI also thought for several days wether to make this post or not. My sloppy english and the fact that I'm quite shy and do not really enjoy a lot of attention. Being it a book in spanish (at least for now), It's not like posting here would attract sales, but rather I'd like to show it as an appreciation post and as a chance to show how this little subreddit helped on getting to this point.\r  \n\r  \nJust hope now that it'll be available someone decides it would be interesting to have an english version, as I'd love to share it with as many people as possible. Thanks!", "\u00a1Felicidades y buen provecho!", "Congrats", "Congrats! I'll have to add it to my collection when I can.\n\nAlso who did the photography for it if you don't mind me asking?", "Congrats OP, best of luck to you!", "Felicidades!

South Texas here si lo puedo leer \ud83d\ude01", "Great stuff mate, I'm looking forward not only for the english version but for the J-Version so the circle would be complete Your Country (Spanish) > the World (English) > back to Ramen home (japanese)!\n\nGood Luck", "I wish you all the best and I\u2019ll be more than happy to tell you I\u2019ll grab this book and translate!

I use a wok style skillet for the water & noodles to speed up boiling and make tossing the noodles in sauce easier.\n\nIf you're interested, my method for making this is here: [https://bushwickgrillclub.com/jjapaguri-brunch/](https://bushwickgrillclub.com/jjapaguri-brunch/)", "The eggs literally look fuckn bomb", "Wow looks amazing", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m Korean and grew up with jjajjangmyun so my traditional Korean side is saying noooo but I\u2019m sorry Jjapaguri is bomb", "Dope plating", "That's the best looking ramen I've ever seen so far in this sub.", "Ha, that's seitain! To me it looked like oven roasted sweet potatoes and was thinking how tasty that combo must be. Looks amazing by the way.", "I never saw parasite but I\u2019m happy to see some love for whatever it is you wanna call the way I\u2019ve been preparing ramen for myself for years, love me some concentrated ramen broth sauce with some extra heat, extra fat", "I'm curious about the chili crisp! How does this compare to Lao Gan Ma?", "I saw babish make chapaguri and had to try it...\n\nMy issues with it were:\n\n1) its too spicy and the excessive heat drowns out the flavour of the jajang sauce. My advice is to just make the chapaghetti with a little squirt of sriracha, or a dollop of gochujiang added towards the end of cooking when the sauce is still quite liquid.\n\nRemember that neoguri is supposed to be eaten as a soup, with water to dilute the spicyness a bit. And while I'd totally recommend draining the water from something like \"mr noodles\" or \"ichiban\" it doesnt work with neoguri. Thats just me.\n\n2) chapaghetti and neoguri are different sized noodles. I know this probably doesnt bother most people, but maybe im just OCD like that. For presentation's sake, id recommend buying and making chapaguri in pairs, so that you can use a double portion of chapaghetti \"ramen\", or neoguri \"udon\"", "I just adore the coloring!", "I really like the neoguri but the bean flavor of chapaghetti was not my favorite", "Fuck taht looks good", "Looks great! Make sure to share your creations in /r/instantramen as well!", "What the hell is ram-don?", "Neoguri is my favorite all time. I've never tried the mixture", "My ramen is specifically always made this way at home, long before parasite. I will often just use one egg for myself and use a little butter for the noodles. I also throw in some stir fry veggies and don\u2019t use home made but rather Lao gan ma. But this is exactly how i prefer ramen to be, and it looks great. I hope to make my own chili crisp one day."]}

The soup at Uchoku is a clear chicken and niboshi based soup with shoyu tare based seasoning.

The best description I can come up with is that it's a lovechild of goulash and Jiro ramen. It is in fact a mix of Jiro ramen, Takeoka Shiki Ramen and the ramen of a place called Ariran in Chiba. So if you like any of these things, you will most likely enjoy this bowl of ramen as well.\n\n  \nStamina ramen is not a clearly defined term. The term stamina is often used for food items which come with either lots of veggies, lots of meat or lots of garlic. At Stamina Ramen Suzuki the focus is definitely on meat, fat, garlic and onion. The flavor foundation of this bowl is onion and pork, with very strong and punchy soy sauce thrown into the mix. The soup is definitely on the rich and salty side of things. The noodles are thick, chewy and provide some good balance to the overpowering surroundings. Everything is topped with fried onions and pork belly. On top of that, you can ask for free raw garlic, raw ginger and pork back fat. I heavily recommend you do just that.So far, Stamina Ramen Suzuki has been my favorite bowl of the year 2021. I recommend all ramen fans visiting Tokyo to make their way to Mitaka to grab a bowl at Suzuki.Be careful though, this bowl is only served during dinnertime.\n\n  \nIf you would like to see more of this bowl, I made a short video about it: https://youtu.be/ZT5L9wSBou0", "This is what you eat in Persona to boost your Parameters.", "I\u2019m going to Japan next year, this is now on my list", "Oh god that looks amazing.\n\nAdded to my list of ramen places and my want to go list.", "Oh my goodness that looks heavenly!

They have a sign up system so be sure to go around 8:30 am to secure yourself a spot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShio Ramen: Mukan\n\nEasier choice here. Mukan serves up an oyster base ramen that is to die for. Hands down best shop I went to in 2022 overall and looking forward to how this bowl evolves. The master is\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMiso Ramen: Kudanshita Nukaji\n\nI don't even like Miso ramen all that much, but Nukaji is hands down the best to open in 2022. Using a solid pork bone stock as base, they play around with different Miso varieties to make some phenomenal ramen soup. Love how they play around with different combos so will have to come back in 2023 to try some of their other bowls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNiboshi Ramen: NIBOSHIMANIA\n\nMaster of NIBOSHIMANIA comes from the Hechikan lineage, training at the legendary Yokohama based shop before branching out on his own. Best of 2022 was easy, this could easily be one of my favorite bowls of ramen all time. Not for the faint of heart though so I would recommend getting your feet wet at a lighter Niboshi shop before coming here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJiro/Jiro-kei: Menya Hero\n\nA former Jiro disciple, I'm not sure the entire background, but decided to open a Jiro-kei shop of his own, rather than go through as an official Jiro lineage. Regardless, the best Jiro-kei to have opened this year in my humble opinion, and definitely top 5 non lineage shops all time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIekei: Ramen Miuraya\n\nNot much to say here. Soup is funky, rich, creamy and they have free rice on the side. Chashu is a must and be sure to use the Kewpie mayo they provide at the table to make yourself a little chashu over rice bowl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoupless/Maze Soba: Teuchimensai Kamei\n\nMaster at Kamei used to do pop-ups at Miyamoto down in Kamata. His specialty ramen became so popular he decided to just open a shop of his own. I think he's actually just 24-25 years old so really young, but is making one of the best soupless ramens I've ever had. Definitely worthy of a visit, despite it's location outside central Tokyo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTsukemen: Jikaseimen Robinson\n\nLots of great contenders, but I had to go with one that opened recently in Jikaseimen Robinson.

My wife hasn't ever been able to try tonkotsu ramen because pork makes her sick, so I opened up Ramen Lord's Book of Ramen and zeroed in on a chicken alternative. \n\nI followed all of the directions for the tori paitan ramen, with the only exceptions being using koikuchi in place of white soy sauce, using rolled and tied, skin-on, boneless chicken thighs in place of pork belly for the chashu, and a baking soda trick with angel hair pasta that I found... somewhere... \n\nIt's really good! It coats the mouth the way I'd expect from a paitan broth, the chicken scallion oil is great, and the couple of tablespoons of tare I threw in this is just enough seasoning. I definitely didn't heat the bowls enough because it lost a lot of heat fast, but I'll correct that next time. I want to learn how to make noodles, but we have already begun outgrowing the one bedroom apartment we're currently in and the last thing we need right now is more kitchen gadgets.  \n\nOverall, I'm really happy with it and I'm excited to try more styles of ramen as time goes on.

According to current research, these ingredients do not cause cancer (sorry, no link to research, but it easy to google)", "Basically, it\u2019s very hard to definitively prove whether or not something is a carcinogen, and if it is, how big of a deal it is\n\nIt depends on how you\u2019re exposed: lead may be carcinogenic, but if you just poke a block of lead then wash your hands, you don\u2019t need to worry\n\nIf something is carcinogenic, then that means it raises your *risk* of getting a particular type of cancer. Let\u2019s say the chance of getting lung cancer as a non-smoker is 0.05% (completely made up number). Smoking increases your chance of getting lung cancer, so let\u2019s say that among pack-a-day smokers, they have a 10% chance of developing lung cancer (also made up number).\n\nWell, cancer typically happens later in life, and we\u2019re exposed to possible carcinogens all our lives. If someone gets lung cancer, was it because they smoked for a year before quitting? Was the air pollution in their region a bigger factor? Were they a carpenter who wound up inhaling wood dust which is also possibly carcinogenic? Were they a kid when leaded gasoline was still in use? What about that one time, also as a little kid when they ate one lead paint chip when mom wasn\u2019t looking? Red meat is also possibly carcinogenic, did they eat too much beef? Even if you have a good amount of research, it\u2019s hard to say anything beyond \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cprobably not\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly complicated, and even proving that tobacco is a carcinogen took tons of effort.\n\nAs far as I understand, if science so much as says \u201cMaybe this causes cancer? We really aren\u2019t sure yet, but if it does, it probably doesn\u2019t increase your cancer risk much more than sunshine. We\u2019re going to go research things that are more likely to have a big impact before we worry about less likely threats\u201d that means that California says there needs to be a warning\n\nAnd so everything under the sun has a warning, because proving if something causes cancer is very, very hard, and science prioritizes researching the more likely risk factors. There\u2019s only so many people doing carcinogen research.\n\nOnly after writing this comment did I remember [this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=g7MXnTJBwS4) old SciShow video.

And chicken is what this bowl is all about.\r  \n\r  \nToy Box uses a number of different chicken breeds for their ramen, using all parts of them for different things in the bowl. The carcasses and most of the meat is used for a clear broth which is simmered for a long time at 92\u00b0C. The juicy breasts are used as a topping. The chicken fat is rendered out of the chicken skin and used to enrich the ramen bowl.\r  \n\r  \nNoodles are quite thin and square, which fits perfectly with the delicate and rich soup. Meat toppings are prepared sous-vide and have a nice juicy bite to them. Eggs are perfectly prepared and have a nice seasoning, together with a really nice orange egg yolk. On the side of the bowl you can find a a crunchy hosaki menma bamboo shoot, which helps with some texture to switch things up.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, Toy Box is rightfully named by some as the best shoyu ramen shop in all of Tokyo. While that might be hard for me to say, I could possibly see it in my personal top 5 shoyu ramen in Tokyo. What I am trying to say is: It is an easy recommendation to make and you will not walk out disappointed.\r  \nBeyond their famous shoyu ramen, they also offer shio ramen and miso ramen. Although I haven't tried them yet, it is fair to assume that they are also on an equally high level as their shoyu ramen.\n\nIf you want to see some more of this bowl and this ramen shop, check out my short video about it: https://youtu.be/uG\\_p9htQjDk", "I like my eggs less cooked.", "I disagree with the commenters saying they'd like it runnier - I think that's perfect.

I weigh it every 30 minutes and continue heating until weight is reduced to 2/3 the starting weight. Store in an airtight container and make sure not to touch it with bare skin as it\u2019s caustic. \n\nFor the ramen dough you want flour that has a high percentage of protein. You can substitute with all purpose flour, it just won\u2019t be as chewy.  \n\nRamen dough: \n8g sodium carbonate\n4g kosher salt \n164g water\n396g bread flour \n4g vital wheat gluten\n\nAdd sodium carbonate to water and stir until dissolved. Then add salt and stir until dissolved. \n\nIn a mixer, mix flour and vital wheat gluten. Slowly add the alkaline solution 1/3 at a time, allowing liquid to fully absorb. After final addition, mix until dough looks crumbly. Unlike pasta dough this is more of a dry dough. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and rest for 30-60 min. \n\nAfter resting, ball up the dough and knead it to work the gluten. It\u2019s going to be really tough and will take some time to knead. Cut them in small pieces and roll it out thin enough to run through a pasta roller. Let the thin sheets rest for another 30 minutes, then run through a pasta roller. You can do this by hand, but it will take forever. \n\nAfter you cut the noodles, dust them with cornstarch or flour. Wrap in plastic and sit in fridge for an hour up to 24 hrs before cooking. Letting them dry out a little before cooking helps so they don\u2019t get too stringy. Make sure you drain them well after cooking and before putting them in your broth otherwise they get a soapy taste.", "How da heck do you made this", "These look amazing!!

I think it's partly because I love my filling recipe (I'll include it here for posterity), and mostly because I've given up making wonton skins and have no shame in using store bought and rolling out as thin as possible. I've never not enjoyed a bowl of wontonmen, and despite throwing some random characters in the mix it was still great.\n.\n.\nThe filling for my wontons (and gyoza btw) is all pork with some add-ins. The qualities of the pork are important; the grind should be finee, it should have a good amount of fat, like 80/20 or lower, and it should be cold. The reason I prefer the aforementioned qualities are of threefold importance: a thicker grind is harder to incorporate fat and other ingredients into, the fat adds to a lush texture and tackiness, and the coolness helps mitigate heat transfer during the mixing process, as you should do so by hand. I recently experienced with some kurobuta porkthat was leaner than expected. The resulting gyoza and wontons were quickly overcooked and often chewy and dense. \n.\n.\nI've honestly just realized during writing I haven't even provided a recipe. Grate one inch of ginger and five cloves of garlic into a medium bowl. Finely chop about a quarter cup of chives. Add one pound of cold fatty ground pork. Add a pinch of salt and white pepper, quarter teaspoons each soy, mirin, and sesame oil, and mix by hand until incorporated and tacky. Refrigerate until use. \n.\n.\nAs I mentioned, this recipe works for both wontons and gyoza. I hope you try it 'cause it rules. The rest of the bowl includes a pork chintan-bacon dashi double soup, a new tare (it was too sweet paired with the soup), ground pork chili paste, negi, and ajitama.

Get everything ready\n\n\n* Kraft singles\n\n* a pad of butter \n\n* diced garlic and onion (or not if you don't like) \n\n* a bit of dark leafy green (or not if you don't like it)\n\n* Fish sauce (if you have it, no issue if not) \n\n* Some sort of meat that is cooked (if you want) \n\n* 1 Raw egg or a ramen egg (if you want) \n\n* The measurement of water with a extra 50ML \n\n2. Heat pan and throw in pad of butter, while this heats open ramen pack and pour flavoring packets into a small vessel to easily dump them all at once (veggies, packets) into the water. I normally use about %75 of each packet, as I feel like the way we are going to do this makes it too salty if I use the whole thing (but try with the whole packet for the first go).\n\n3. Add chopped/minced garlic and small chopped onion to butter (if not using garlic and onion this is fine and skip step 3 and go right to 4)\n\n\n4. stir for just a min/few mins until the garlic starts to turn, I normally put the heat on high as I'm going to deglaze with water anyways. \n\n5. Pour in water and then use mixing tool to scrape any bits on the bottom. Pour in all flavoring packets and a few dashes of fish sauce NOW (this causes the water to come to a boil at a higher temp, as it has ingredients in it). \n\n6. when water starts boiling, add ramen for amount of time required. As noodles are cooking, occasionally  (so maybe 3 or 4 times total over 3 minutes lets say) use tool to lift majority of noodles out of water for just a moment to let them \"get some air\". I don't know why this work but it fuckin works in making the noodles excellent. \n\n6. When the timer is done, remove the pot from the heat and put noodles into the bowl, put the raw egg into the pot so that it can poach\n\n7. Now in your pot you should just have broth, floaties, and raw egg. The egg will be \"done\" in about 1-2 mins max (as it continues to cook in the bowl). I normally add my meat and leafy greens at this time as to not overcook whatever leftover meat I am heating (ground beef, carintas, even a slice of meatloaf!). \n\n7.

It is a very particular and unique style of ramen, which does not use any broth at all for the soup. Instead, they use hot water, a very strong soy sauce based seasoning tare, lots of MSG and a healthy helping of aroma oil. If nobody told you, it would be impossible to guess that there isn't a broth as base.\n\nWhere you would expect a pot of broth, they keep a pot of water at boiling temperature separately from their noodle boiling water. Although some shops in the Takeoka area will also use their noodle boiling water.\n\nThe next unique thing at this shop is the usage of a shoyu tare which is used in perpetuity, some call this a \"mother sauce\" or \"infinity sauce\". In Japanese it is called \"tsugitashi\". Here, they use the tare also as seasoning for their pork chashu. Over time, chashu and tare cross season each other. The tare ages in a sense and gets enriched more and more with the porky bbq flavors, which accumulate over time as the tare always gets refilled at the end of the day. A flavor which is basically impossible to recreate at home.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in seeing and learning a bit more about this style of ramen, check out this short video: https://youtu.be/2vCGzzsGJTM", "This is r/foodporn material.", "Can we please see the accoutrement to your ramen diet?", "That\u2019s it.

Tip for a umami packed soft boiled egg :   To get that glistening egg-white / yolk consistency you are going to bring a pot of water to boil (ensure pot is deep enough for desired number of eggs) . Once water is rapidly boiling bring down the heat until the water is slightly boiling (but not at a simmer!) Place eggs gently into pot set timer for 6 mins 30 seconds, no more and no less than that! and just keep an eye on the water.  No need to stir.   Once the timer is down to 3 mins, get a bowl and make an ice bath for your eggs once the timer goes off.  Once eggs are cooling down in the ice bath, you can get a small mason jar or ziplock bag. Tbh any resealable container will work fine too.  Into your container you will measure 1 or 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, a 1/2 tablespoon of minced fresh garlic or ginger, 1 cup of light soy sauce, 1/4 cup of Mirin (rice wine vinegar), 1/3 cup of water, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon sesame oil.  **If you want em spicy you can even add a couple tablespoons of your choice of sriracha or a couple teaspoons of chili oil.**  Stir it well and taste.  My measurements usually marinade about 4 large eggs so you can tweak the measurements to your liking.   Peel your cooled down soft boiled eggs and place into marinade, ensuring that it covers the entire surface of the eggs. Fridge them for a couple hours or preferably overnight . These can last you up to a week but anything past that and they will become too salty.   Finally, CUT. THEM. IN. HALF\u2026 PLEASE.  Then watch that sexy marinated egg yolk elevate your already near perfect bowl of ramen to a 10/10 .", "Why the random jalape\u00f1os though?"]}

(I prefer not to boil shoyu)  then added 1.5g sugar, 2g balsamic vinegar and season with sea salt to your taste. \n\nFor the soup wash and slice the veggies. I used a mandoline for this and sliced about 3mm thick. \n\n\n1 broccoli stalk\n1 cauliflower stalk\nHalf a sweet potato\nHalf a small cabbage\nHalf an ear of corn (not sliced 3mm)\n5 button mushrooms\nHalf a medium white onion\nI chose these for flavour but also I expected the finish soup to thicken too. \n\nLightly oil baking sheet toss veggies (not mushs) in oil and roast for 1 hour at 150 degrees celcius turning everything every 15 to 20 minutes. \n\nWhilst they are in the oven over high heat add 2 tablespoons of a neutral oil and add mushroooms. \nStir until a deep caramel colour is achieved (we are looking to build layers of flavour)\nTurn the heat to medium and add 2 tablespoons of tomato concentrate. It is really important to cook this for 3 to 5 minutes. Keep stirring until it starts to turn a deep red colour. \n\nAt this point I would have deglazed the pan with half a cup of cooking sake but I didn\u2019t have any to hand. \nAdd two litres of water, the toasted veggies and top up with water. \nBring to a boil and remove the scum. \nTurn down heat to barely a simmer, you just need to keep it at a temperature where there are a few bubbles breaking the surface. Otherwise the pot will stew and all the flavours will change. We are aiming for clarity in flavour. \nSimmer for 2 hours, keeping an eye on the water level, if it drops top it up but remember to compensate in temperature drop. \nFor the last 30 minutes do not top up with water, this will create the thickness. \nPass the broth through a fine sieve squeezing all the liquid out and blend with a dashi to taste. \nI used a vegetarian dashi, you do you. \n\nTo serve I added 30g of the tare to the bowl. \nNext 20g of onion and garlic aroma oil. Up to you how much you like oil!\n250g of broth. \nAfter a first taste I added 10g of a citrus shio tare to brighten up the bowl. \nNext time I will blend the tares to my taste, again its your journey so do what you feel is right!", "How did you get all the fattiness in a veggie broth?", "Yes please.

Things she suggests you consider: \n\n-Most people won't eat this standing, they will need to head to their table to eat.\n-Each guest bringing bowls full of scalding broth from the bar to the table is a liability most caterers would avoid like the plague.\n-Allowong guest to assemble bowls of dry ingredients and sending them with an additional closed container of broth would be safest if having it assembled at a bar is a must.  This also forces guests to head to their table with their hands full, which is something most caterers try to avoid with hugs and handshakes being thrown around like hotcakes to both young kids and old ladies.\n-Alternativley, guest could mark on their RSVP what ramen broth they want like they would mark for eentee preference.  They could make their bowls in a buffet/bar, and servers could bring hot broth by in carafes after the table is reseated.  This could also be tracked at the bar as orders are made and sent out as needed, but they would need to come to the bar grouped by table to simplify it for the staff.\n\nShe loves this idea though, any caterer would be stoked to take this job on.", "Make sure you provide bibs like they do at lobster and crab places.

Like traditional pork/chicken/veg options might be a heavier saucier pork, grilled lighter chicken, a veggie pasta.\n\nIf this is one part of the meal, that's fine.

Unless your wedding is suuuper casual and small. \n\nNot everyone knows how to create their own ramen bowl and may feel intimidated or not know what to do. Some people will opt not to eat rather than do the wrong thing in a crowd of people. \n\nBowls full of broth are really hot and heavy and dangerous.. Im a ramen fiend and I can\u2019t easily hold a bowl of ramen because the bowl gets too hot so this will  be tricky to navigate with a crowd of (likely tipsy) people. My noodle bowl at home literally has handles because it\u2019s too hot to carry without them. \n\nThen you have to consider the mess. Noodles are a messy food.. and I even feel like quite an intimate food. I don\u2019t want to slurp down noodles on front of a dressed up person I\u2019ve never met before.

The Takaida-style is named after a station in Osaka which is surrounded by many ramen shops servings this particular style of ramen.\r  \n\r  \nThe tamari shoyu seasoning of the soup gives it a very deep and smoky flavor, very different to any other shoyu ramen I had before.

Seriously addicting and you will find yourself craving for just \"one more spoon\" until you reach the bottom of your ramen bowl.\r  \n\r  \nMenya Jouroku is situated quite centrally in Osaka, within 5 minutes of the famous Namba station.

Some people wanted to know how to make it, so here we go.\n\nBasically it's my take on this recipe: [https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-chashu-miso-ramen/](https://www.justonecookbook.com/homemade-chashu-miso-ramen/)\n\nYou can achieve a great result with the recipe, but here are my chaotic additions:\n\nI use the process from the recipe for the soup and mince, but white pepper is not really my thing, and I prefer not to boil miso. Take the soup off the heat at the end of preparation, thoroughly mix in the miso using a ladle, bring the soup back up to a slight simmer, and then immediately assemble the ramen (see the recipe for when to boil the noodles and add the toppings). I feel that miso loses some character if you boil it. Some might disagree with this. I used 1 big tablespoon of shiro miso for my version. Taste your miso before adding it, some styles can be super salty. Mine was not.\n\nMy chashu is different. It's a whole piece of fatty pork chuck (about 1 kg.) simmered in Japanese soy sauce (Yamasa) and dark soy sauce (Healthy Boy brand - I think it's actually Thai style), mirin, sake, and a tablespoon of sugar. Add enough water to cover the chashu entirely. I don't really measure the ingredients, I just go for a salty (but not overly so), umami taste. Be very careful with the dark soy sauce, as it can easily overpower everything. Simmer the pork slowly until completely tender, this can take up to 4 hours. The meat must be cold before cutting, and partially frozen if you want to make thin slices, as it falls apart easily. It tends to be best if rested in the fridge for one day before cutting.\n\nHeat up frozen sweet corn, but do not boil it, you want the freshness. Put some salted butter on the corn when assembling. The corn should be hot enough to melt some of the cold butter, and this will slowly change the flavor of the soup.\n\nThe ramen noodles in this one are fresh, but store bought (I usually make my own, but I was lazy). The menma is Momoya Ajitsuke Menma.\n\nThe eggs must be prepared in advance. Soft boil the eggs for 7.5 minutes (makes them ever so slightly firm, which I prefer), cool them, and marinate them in classic ajitama seasoning for two days.\n\nSlice some green onions however you like, and put them on top.", "This looks like everything I want in my life!

And gorgeous presentation too!", "I'd be in heaven if I was served that after a night out on Kiyamachi \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude07", "Miso hungry", "Dear fellow Human can you post the recipe to this master piece, please?!", "Looks delicious.

Ryo shanghai honten (ramen museum)\n\nSpicy hot miso ramen.\nImpressive play with tastes. Perfectly spicy, its a ramen that evolves as you eat it, it starts with a chicken/gyokai taste, but as the spicy miso ball blends with your soup it changes the taste, and the ramen keeps interesting all the way to the end.\nI give it 5,5/6.\n\n4. Ichiran shibuya\n\nReally nice ramen, would give it 5/6.\n\n5. Kyobashi sasara\n\nTantanmen\nAlot of sesame taste, and not very impressive ramen,  it would be alot quicker to make a spicy pasta carbonara, and the taste would be better. 2/6.\n\n6. Rokurinsha, tokyo station.\n\nVery good, tastefull, not too salty. Alot of exiting stuff to mix up the flavor. Noodles were nice and chewy and you get dashi to finish your soup. Would give it 5/6.\n\n7. Afuri in shinjuku\n\nYuzu ramen and yuzu beer.\nPerfect harmoni in a bowl. This was my favorite on the trip.\nEvery taste is so gental and round and good and no taste overtakes the others. Its refreshing and light. And the tamago is on another level, its amasing!\nWould give it 6/6.\n\n8. Tomita\n\nVery good noodles, Soup is a bit to salty so shouldnt go all inn with your noodles. Alot of good and exiting meat and the balsamico compliments it.\nEgg is quite mild and dont do much. \n\nIts really good ofc, but a bit too hyped in my opinion. And its a bit worky to have to go there 8am to get a ticket. Would take rokurinsha over it. 4/6.\n\n9. Dont remember name, but probably a big chain store.\n\nTonkotsu black garlic oil\nNice and easy to like tonkotsu, thick noodles, that was short, so they were easy to slurp. \nNice caramelized garlic flavor that stayed in the mouth for a long time.\nGive it 3,5/6.", "Pic 2 is what I wish the amount of meat every ramen place gave here in America.", "Those are a really impressive set!", "now im hungry af", "We\u2019re heading to Tokyo in a few months.

Asuka manages to elevate the Nagoya chicken flavor to its perfection in ramen form. The soup is so rich and yet light, packs a punch and is still elegant.

This time I went for their spicy version, which poses a good challenge even more spice lovers. For me it was at a still enjoyable level of hotness, but I definitely had to push through a bit. A current special is their raw egg with gyofun fish powder, which you use like a dip for some of the noodles (realistically for like 5-6 dips of a mouthful of noodles). Essentially you mix up the egg and the powder, then pick out some noodles from your bowl, mix them in the egg and then slurp directly from there. I also went with done extra nira garlic chives which work perfectly in this bowl.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a fantastic fatty, garlicky, oniony and salty mess plus a good amount of spice, combined with thick and fun to eat noodles.

I also had this boiling covered, extremely agitated for 8 hours one day, let it rest covered without heat overnight, and then continued the rapid boil the next day for 10 hours. This was my first long tonkotsu boil, so it wasn't perfect, however it was still very tasty. u/Ramen_Lord is definitely correct in that the aromatics taint the broth color and taste, and a pure bone broth is more likely to be ideal (to try next time).

Roll pork belly and tie off with twine.\n2. Heat the rest of the ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat until sugar is fully dissolved.\n3. Once dissolved, add pork and marinade to a heavy duty ziplock or vacuum sealed bag.\n4. Let marinade in fridge 6-8 hrs (overnight is what I did)\n5. Sous vide at 165F for 6-8 hours.\n6.

I feel it necessary to mention that I have not yet made noodles from scratch, frankly I'm still intimidated and haven't purchased a pasta roller/cutter. I use the always wonderful Sun Noodle ramen noodles and I've never had trouble finding a good one to pair with my bowl from the kits at the Asian market.\n\nFor about 6 months I've been hooked on the idea of combining 2 of my favorite flavors in ramen: wok-charred garlic miso and tantanmen with homemade mala chili oil. That's what I've done with this recipe. The intended (and in my mind achieved) result is a creamy texture and a funky, earthy, nutty, intensely umami flavor profile.\n\nSoup:    \n*2lbs chicken paws    \n*2 pork necks    \n*4 chicken leg quarters    \n*1.5lb fresh pork belly    \n*2lbs pork marrow bones    \n*1 chicken back    \n*1 large white onion    \n*2 bunches of scallion    \n*About 100g ginger    \n*2 bulbs of garlic    \n\nBoil meat items in a large stock pot. Start with a lot of water. I ended up cooking it down to about 3-4L of soup and it was somewhat concentrated which is desirable for this dish. Boil for 6-8 hrs, adding aromatics 1.5 hrs before completion. I recommend emulsifying the soup with an immersion blender after straining.\n\nTare per bowl:    \n*1/2 tbsp white miso wok charred with:    \n     *1 clove minced garlic    \n     *1/2tsp toasted sesame oil    \n     *1/2tsp vegetable oil    \n     *1/2tsp dark soy sauce    \n*40ml toasted sesame seed paste    \n*35ml mala Sichuan chili oil (rough recipe below)    \n*1 tbsp very finely minced whites of scallions    \n\nChashu:    \n*Boil pork belly for 90 mins with:\n     *1/4c light soy    \n     *2tbsp dark soy    \n     *50g ginger    \n     *1 bunch scallions, greens only (reserve whites)    \n     *1 bulb garlic, cut in half orbitally    \n     *2 tbsp mirin    \n     *1/4c white sugar    \n     *Add enough water to cover the meat by 1 inch    \n\nAfter boiling, bake chashu on a wire rack in an oven as hot as it will go for 8-10mins or until outside is deeply caramelized.\n\nOptional: place chashu back in the boiling liquid when you leave it in the fridge to cool for slicing. Preferably overnight but at least 90 minutes.\n\nNote: I considered pan searing my chashu slices before assembling the bowl, but decided not to this time. It would probably work with this dish nicely.\n\nMala Sichuan chili oil:    \n\nI don't have the exact measurements but it contains:    \n\n*Sichuan peppercorns, pan toasted and coarsely ground in a molcajete    \n*Vegetable oil    \n*Sesame oil    \n*Fried garlic    \n*Fried shallots\n*High quality ground chili flakes from the Asian market    \n*Salt    \n*Sugar    \n*Whole dried chilis, dry toasted and crushed    \n*Coarse ground black pepper    \n\nASSEMBLY NOTES:    \n*320ml soup.    \n*I recommend mixing the tare ingredients into a homogenous mixture. I just did it with a tiny whisk after adding them to the bowl.    \n*egg was boiled for 6:45 then immediate ice bath.    \n*noodles are from 1955 sun noodle miso ramen kit.    \n*noodles were cooked for 90sec.    \n*local in-store made kimchi from Asian market. Use a kimchi that has fish sauce.    \n*I recommend LOTS of scallion on top of this bowl.    \n\nTHANKS FOR LOOKING! :D arigato.", "The broth looks super rich and delicious.

The primary reason is how I'm treating the katsuo.\n\nMy hypothesis is that katsuobushi tastes 10x better right after steeping. So why not infuse it a la minute? And if you're doing that, why not infuse the *whole* broth with it? And if you're doing that, why not do it tableside with a little theatrics?\n\nSo I made the ramen without the katsuo I'd normally add to the tare. When it was time to eat, I portioned out just enough broth for my guests, infused 6g per serving of a mix of thickness of katsuo, and strained it in front of them right before making up the bowls. So satisfying.\n\nThe broth was made via a remouillage \u2013 two broths cooked from the same bones. I used 3/4 trotters and 1/4 pork backs, cooked a first broth, reserved the bones and made a second broth with them, reduced the second broth to 1/3, then combined the two. The first broth used garlic, ginger, cabbage, and onion as aromatics. The second broth used garlic and charred onion.\n\nIf it weren't for how the remouillage affects the clarify, I'd definitely do this more often... The second broth was delicious! Will skip this next time, but great to keep in my back pocket for a paitan in the future.\n\nThe tare was a dashi with kombu, niboshi, shitake, reduced white wine, and rice koji. The oil was lard with ginger, garlic, and yuzu zest. \n\nNoodles are 2% buckwheat and 35% hydration. 1.5g each salt and kansui per 140g.\n\nFor meat, I used a beautiful prosciutto cotto (hidden beneath the shiso leaf) and pork belly. Pork belly cooked sous vide at 158 for 16 hours in soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, and black garlic. Then cooked in oven after slicing.

To say this trip was long over due is probably an understatement; I have been making ramen in those 8 years since living in Sapporo, and have slowly lost my frame of reference for what is normal, acceptable, and what is trendy, in Japan. \n\nSo I went back. I had to.\n\nSapporo is, in a lot of ways, my second home. I understand the irony in this statement, as I\u2019m a white dude and not very culturally Japanese, apart from speaking the language decently. Still, this was an emotional trip, revisiting places I had loved, and also discovering new ones. I learned a lot. Ate a lot of amazing bowls of ramen. Some, not so amazing. \n\nRather than review every bowl here, since I did that already in the moment in my [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/ramenover), I thought it\u2019d be good, in typical Ramen_Lord fashion, to jot down what I learned from the trip. This isn\u2019t an essay, rather, a collection of observations and thoughts spurred by a glorious parade of 22 bowls of ramen, all shoved into my gross maw. Behold, a Ramen nerd\u2019s ramblings:\n\n1. Ramen is hotter in Japan. It just is. They often preheat the bowls, and the soup is served just off boil. Since shops are smaller, bowls rarely wait to get to the customers who ordered them, meaning they have even less time to cool off.\n2. Japanese people eat ramen fast... but not THAT fast. At least not in Hokkaido. And it\u2019s true that Sapporo is a little slower, a little more chill, than the dense metropolis that is Tokyo. But there is no loitering, no lingering over the soup, no intense, lingering conversation with friends. I think a lot of that is because you can often see the queue of people inside the shop, with seating or standing for waiting patrons just in eyesight as you eat, you feel pressure to leave. Building that into a business could reduce check time (as could making the space uncomfortable and making people order and pay right away, both of which are also common in ramen shops in Japan. \n3. Toppings on ramen are far more sparse. I think Americans have fetishized toppings in ramen because they are often the protein heavy components of the dish, the sort of obvious \u201cvalue\u201d area of the bowl. You want loads of pork, extra eggs, all the fixings. But at nearly every shop I visited, for my average 700-800 yen bowl, I was given only one small slice of chashu, and almost never had an egg included. The focus is, and always will be, on the soup and noodles. I think Americans\u2019 love of toppings has deemphasized the soup and noodles in the dish. Something I am sad about but understand. Is there a way to pivot?\n4. Ramen shops don\u2019t usually have extensive menus. I knew this from before, but you forget. Some shops I went to only had one type of ramen! There is a focus on deep specialization in Japan, and it benefits the restaurant, who is able to execute something marvelous.\n5. The bowls I had are thinner/weaker than they were 8 years ago. This feels like conspiracy, I know, but I photographed many bowls I ate 8 years ago, and even comparing the same bowls visually, it\u2019s quite apparent. When the gulf between comparison points is that long, the differences are stark: less bubbles, less viscosity, fewer toppings even. The reasoning is probably complex, but I can guess: food costs have increased every year for the last 8 years in Japan, but the prices of ramen have remained basically stable. To maintain profit, a reduction in meats, bones, and toppings is required. I don\u2019t necessarily think this is a bad thing, but the bowls are lighter for sure. Ramen is in an odd position in Japan, heavily charged with post-war era ideals about scarcity and nourishment under tight budgets, and so it\u2019s difficult to increase prices too rapidly without defeating much of the historical meaning behind the dish. \n6. Americans are obsessed with Tonkotsu way more than Japan is. I visited 22 shops and ate zero straight Tonkotsu bowls. Only a handful of pure Tonkotsu shops ever breach the top 50 list for a given city outside of Kyushu currently. Even in Sapporo, the birthplace of miso, has a host of options, and I ate a lot of shoyu. But pure Tonkotsu in this region just isn\u2019t what folks want usually. And spicy garlic Tonkotsu? That\u2019s not a thing at all. That\u2019s American ramen, like spicy tuna sushi rolls.\n7. The lists used by ramen nerds to rank the best bowls are just as fallible as Yelp or Trip Advisor. In Hokkaido, the 2nd most acclaimed shop on RamenDB is Jiro, and that bowl was borderline gross to me. Not only did it severely mess up my digestion tract, it was paltry, watery, and one dimensional. Hype and emotional nostalgia drives ratings for sure there.\n8. Service in Japan is excellent, but not unattainable by US standard. The key is to reduce the size of the space, so that cooks can pay attention to the guests, and to introduce self-reliance in ordering, via a ticketing system. In Japan, a machine where you place your order and take a ticket to the counter is standard. In America, we pay someone to do this, requiring tips, extra labor, and more time from complete bowl to service. There\u2019s huge cost savings in not doing this. Some POS systems already do this.\n9. Ramen will never be less than 10 dollars in the USA outside of massive chains like Santouka. Labor costs in major cities are way too high, as is the cost of insurance, rent, maintenance, and even sometimes food costs. Americans also want loads of toppings, multiple slices of pork belly, whole eggs. This makes things expensive!\n10. I don\u2019t think Ramen is doomed in the US. If anything, I think we\u2019re in an excellent position to make it our own in a way. But we have to be smart about it, identify what works in Japan, and what ingredients we can use locally versus importing. We also have to not fall into the American trap is extensive choice; specialization and fundamental technique. \n\nWhat can we learn from Japan\u2019s ramen landscape? And what is American ramen really? As I continue to make ramen I ask myself these two questions a lot. I\u2019m not sure I have an answer to either question that is conclusive, the waters are muddier than ever. But the trip gave me some guidance for sure. \n\nLooking forward to making more ramen. Feeling ready for new challenges. ", "I'd been waiting for this post - I followed along on Instagram and have been living vicariously through your updates.\n\nAside from the noodles, which have obvious regional variations, did you notice that any of the other mainstays (menma, egg, etc) were just generally done differently in Sapporo, or are they pretty consistent nation-wide?", "Simple question for you. Likely the toughest. Which of the 22 was your favorite?", "Following all week on Instagram I had to restrain myself from booking the next flight to Sapporo. Junren was your favorite, but would you say any of the other places were must-hit? 175Deno, Noodle Lab Q, Susuri and Iso no Kazuo in particular all looked spectacular.\n\n5. It's incredibly disappointing to hear that things are a bit more watered down now. FOMO is real. \n\n8. Do you have any idea why ramen shops in the US don't adopt Japanese ticketing machines? I know it might require a bit of customer education, but the savings on staff seem like it would be more than worth it. Hell, it would probably be unique enough at this point to provide some marketing buzz. \n\n9. To your points about pricing, funnily enough the Santouka near me is over $10, but there are a few quality bowls under $10 to be found at small shops around the city. It's not unheard of, but I agree that in general American expectations of eating out are not conducive to traditional ramen culture, and by extension pricing. \n\nThank you for your service and for subjecting your body to such a rigorous ramen regimen!

Some bowls seem they may have the \"little chunks of fat\", but it could also be onions or whatever else (little crispy bits or whatever)..

I was at Ramen Lab tonight, speaking to the woman who takes the orders, asking if I was familiar with tonkotsu ramen. \"Of course lady, I'm a white dude in NYC, it's like the only thing available for me!\" lol ", ">I think Americans have fetishized toppings in ramen because they are  often the protein heavy components of the dish, the sort of obvious  \u201cvalue\u201d area of the bowl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis, 100%.  I think it's really important to let the soup 'breathe'.  After all, the soup is the centerpiece of the ramen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Americans are obsessed with Tonkotsu way more than Japan is. I visited 22 shops and ate zero straight Tonkotsu bowls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously, in my city, \"tonkotsu\" ramen isn't even a thing, in the way that 'miso, shoyu, and shio, are.  Tonkotsu is only used to describe the soup.  It's not a \"style\" of ramen.  You can get tonkotsu shio, miso, shoyu, etc....but you don't just order \"tonkotsu\" ramen.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In Hokkaido, the 2nd most acclaimed shop on RamenDB is Jiro, and that bowl was borderline gross to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJiro is just obnoxious.  It's just a noodle-measuring contest with them.  \"How unnecessarily excessive can we make this bowl of ramen?\"  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Service in Japan is excellent, but not unattainable by US standard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a significant factor, here, is the expectations of the customer in the US versus the expectations of the customer in Japan.  The clientele is completely different, I think.  I've never heard someone make any sort of special order at a ramen restaurant.  I've never seen anything sent back.  I've never heard anyone ask in-depth questions about the contents of a bowl, etc.  I know this is all anecdotal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What can we learn from Japan\u2019s ramen landscape?\n\n \n\nI think \"less is more\" is the mantra in my area.  The best bowls are understated, they speak for themselves, unique but not gimmicky (I feel like Jiro is extremely gimmicky), etc.  I also think that using what's local and available/domestic is a significant factor, which is why I wonder if America can DO ramen, or whether we can do our best rendition, like a cover band playing its favorite band's music.\n\n&#x200B;", "Great write up.

I never really analyzed any of the bowls I ate, and if I could do it all over again I would go back and really try to learn the techniques. I actually met a guy at a club in Sapporo and it turns out he worked for one of the most highly regarded ramen shops in the city ([Shingen](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g298560-d1199674-Reviews-Ramen_Shingen_Minami_6joten-Sapporo_Hokkaido.html)).

The Takaida style of ramen is characterized by the usage of tamari shoyu, which is soy sauce made purely from soy beans, without any wheat. The soup is made with chicken and kombu (kelp). The Takaida-style is named after a station in Osaka which is surrounded by many ramen shops servings this particular style of ramen.\r  \n\r  \nThe tamari shoyu seasoning of the soup gives it a very deep and smoky flavor, very different to any other shoyu ramen I had before. The closest comparison I can give is something like a non-thick gravy or a demi-glace. Imagine your grandma dumped ramen noodles in her homemade demi-glace and served it to you. Seriously addicting and you will find yourself craving for just \"one more spoon\" until you reach the bottom of your ramen bowl.\r  \n\r  \nMenya Jouroku is situated quite centrally in Osaka, within 5 minutes of the famous Namba station. While Namba is famous for the late night fun that can be had there, please be aware that Menya Jouroku is only open for lunch.\n\nIf you would like to see more of this shop and ramen bowl, check out this short video: https://youtu.be/MrZkfVgg60c", "Does anyone know how to marinate an egg like that I'd like to try at home!", "Why does this turn me on??", "[deleted]", "[deleted]"]}

I\u2019m all for taking shortcuts when they\u2019re worth it, the somi stock is better than what I\u2019ve received at many restaurants.\n\n**Noodles** \\- they are a bit hard to find, but I use premium frozen ramen noodles from a Japanese grocery store. They are much better than my homemade ones (more ramen-y if that makes sense\u2026) and also better than any dried option I\u2019ve found by a long shot.\n\n**Meat** \\- I stray from tradition here and top my Tonkotsu with pork tenderloin rather than chashu. I\u2019m not a big fan of fatty meats, so chashu isn\u2019t my personal favorite. It\u2019s also very time consuming to prepare, compared to pork tenderloin which can cook as the other ingredients are prepared. You may worry that the lean pork tenderloin will over cook in the soup, but I\u2019ve never found that to be the case. The lean meat actually pairs really well with the rich soup in my opinion. I also like to load mine up with more meat than what you\u2019d typically get.\n\n**Eggs** \\- homemade, obviously.\n\n**Black garlic oil** \\- also homemade, it\u2019s pretty impossible to find prepared black garlic oil for sale and making it is very simple. It absolutely takes the bowl to the next level.\n\nI finish the bowl with a little green onion, sometimes a baby bok choy as well.", "Looks beautiful!", "Well now, it\u2019s time to take applications from participants for the taste testing. I respectfully submit mine first!! Lord, this looks delicious!! \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b", "Like a boss.

It's generally overkill, but nice for a presentation-dish or if you love eggs and are a perfectionist. \n\nI leave the eggs in warm/hot water for a while to help avoid cracking when put to the boil, then pierce the shell with a pin, lower gently, but promptly into slightly boiling water. It doesn't need to be bubbling much to cook. Then a 6:30m timer. After this, put them straight into cold water. (they will keep cooking in the shell when hot) I just fill the pot with cold tap water to handle the eggs, crack them a little and drop into ice water for a moment. (This should also help with peeling.) Then I put them in a sandwich bag with soy sauce, sweet soy and a few small drops of Sesame oil and leave in the fridge for a few hours, turning a few times throughout to ensure a somewhat even coating.\n\nThe sandwich bag is wasteful, but can conform to the eggs and use far less marinade than a solid container. Especially if only cooking 2 or so.\nThis is also a recipe where you can really appreciate the taste and texture of \"the pricey eggs\".\n\nI love to cook, but often have little food in the house, so this and some green onion from the garden, (just put the leftover roots from a bunch in some dirt or water and you don't have to buy a whole bunch whenever you want a garnish) then some freshly ground Sesame seeds and your favourite instant ramen. \n\nSo that's my relatively quick, tasty, poor-person, go-to fanciness, with some ingredients that are easy enough to keep on-hand.\n\nI have turned two ex girlfriends from egg-deniers to egg-fanciers.

Gently simmering garlic and green onions for a little while. This just most traditional method.\n- Heavy creams. Milk or nut milks are fine, you just want the thick kinds.\n- Cheese. Grated parm or something in the umami nutty range works great but need to mix in vigorously immediately to melt and incorporate evenly.\n- Mayo. Mayo is the ultimate cheat code. Full fat and thick. People will say it must be kewpie but in the US I have used Dukes and love that too.\n- Egg yolks. Yolks are great but need to mix immediately, but be careful, don\u2019t let your yolks scramble in the pan.\n\nYou can use individually or a combination, like carbonara.

Authentic Tonkotsu ramen will almost always be quite thick and it's not that it's fat but collagen and gelatin extracted from the 8+ hour boil. Hell, some places in Japan will even add fat onto the top of the ramen which is so delicious!\n\nRamen is made with 5 key ingredients: broth, noodles, tare, aromatic oil and toppings.\n\nFor lighter ramen, you want a lighter broth. One key term to be aware of is \"Paitan\" which translates to \"White Soup\" which is broth that is created by boiling any type of meat & bones long and MIGHT be fatty but sometimes it can be surprisingly light! Below is a quick list of the most common ramen broth types:\n\n* Shoyu -- Soy Sauce based, usually made with Chicken, Fish or Pork. Medium in fat content\n* Miso -- Miso based, usually made with Chicken or Pork stock. Medium to High in fat content\n* Shio -- Salt based, usually light and often made with fish stock. Light to medium in fat content\n* Tonkotsu -- Refer to above about a \"Paitan\" soup, Tonkotsu falls into that category. Medium to High in fat\n* Tantanmen -- Sesame based, VERY THICK RICH BROTH. It can be almost as thick as a curry. Medium to High fat\n* Tsukemen -- Broth is thick and concentrated, noodles are served separately and you dip them into the broth. Similar to soba\n\nDISCLAIMER -- The above can be used to describe the TARE of a ramen, not the BROTH. The tare is the small amount of concentrated seasoning that is added to a ramen. A Shio Tonkatsu ramen is NOT going to be a clear light soup, but it was seasoned with a Shio-based tare.\n\nAnd the sacrilegious thing to mention in r/ramen.... if you can, try Soba or Udon. Those broths are mostly light and clear broths similar to Pho but are more focused on being a clean flavor.\n\nHope this helped!\n\nRamen is joy!", "Try shoyu or shio ramen- clear broths, not as filling or fatty \u263a\ufe0f", "For people that eat ramen often it\u2019s common to eat just the noodles and toppings and not finish the broth, due to the fat/salt content.", "Like another commenter said, you might prefer a shio (salt) or shoyu (soy) broth.

Its basically hot Jello.", "Tonkotsu is famously rich.  It solidified because the bones are simmered for an extended period of time and tends to have even more gelatin than pho stock.  The fat is also intentionally emulsified into the stock, which is what gives tonkotsu soup its distinctive creamy appearance and rich flavor.", "There are two basic types of ramen: paitan and chintan. Tonkotsu is a paitan. If pho was ramen, it would be a chintan.\n\nPer googling \u201cpaitan vs chintan\u201d:\n\n\u201cPaitan and chintan are two distinct types of ramen broths, primarily distinguished by their appearance in cooking methods. Paitan broths are opaque and creamy, achieved through a high-temperature cooking process that emulsifies fats into the broth. Chintan broths, on the other hand, are clear and lighter, produced by simmering at sub-boiling temperatures, allowing the fats to separate from the soup.\u201d", "Was this from Umai?

It's Tonkatsu but instead of pork it's chicken so despite being creamy it wasn't as heavy.", "Tonkatsu is made with a concentrated pork bone broth, it has a good bit of fat and protein.

I know that\u2019s bizarre because I\u2019m a white American, but any time you live in a place for an extended period of time, you grow attached to it. Even as a foreigner, I always get nostalgic for this place. \n\nIn this trip, I had a lot more knowledge than last year. I had just come off the tail end 23 bowl ramen feast in Tokyo, hitting the big shoyu and tsukemen legends over there. But I crave miso, I am a miso lover, and Sapporo is miso ramen country. \n\nMost of my favorite bowls are what you would consider second wave. The timeline goes something like this:\n\nFirst wave: in 1956 Aji no Sanpei creates miso ramen, basically by accident. They\u2019re making a pork miso soup and a customer asks for them to put noodles in it. So the legend goes. This style is denoted by wok cooking vegetables before deglazing the wok with soup, a pork chintan. Miso tare in the bottom of the bowl, customers are asked to mix it. They also establish the noodle style, working with Nishiyama Seimen to develop a curly, dense noodle with egg that can handle the hot soup. I hated this 10 years ago, now I crave it. It\u2019s a salty fat bomb. \n\nSecond wave, 1964: Sumire is created. They invent the \u201clard cap style\u201d of miso, denoted for a thick layer of melted fat trapping the heat below. Sumire later reopens in 1989 after the brothers who ran it split, one brother creates Sumire as a new shop, the other later opens \u201cJunren\u201d, a misreading of the original shop\u2019s Kanji. \u7d14\u9023. These shops are similar, for darker miso profiles, and intense amounts of lard as mentioned. I LOVE this stuff. \n\n3rd wave, 2000: Menya Saimi opens, the chef having worked at Sumire for 10 years prior. His shop is critically acclaimed, the highest rated shop in Hokkaido. The miso profile is much more refined, the miso warmed in a ladle sitting in the hot wok, barely heated through, just enough to take off the pungent roughness. It\u2019s also much more mild in fat content. But the curly noodles are still there. \n\nYou also have hyper modern shops too. New methods for incorporating the miso, new base soups, new toppings. Many of these shops come from cooks having worked at Sumire/Saimi and spinning off to do their own thing, or new chefs tweaking 70 year techniques with modern elements. \n\nBut some elements are very common. The wok is borderline universal, almost all shops have this (even ones that don\u2019t make miso!). Beansprouts are almost required, sometimes cooked heavily into wilted strands, others barely kissed by flame, crisp and bright. The noodles are curly, chewy, and almost always bright yellow. The fat is ample. The chashu is usually forgettable, or non existent. \n\nThis trip also definitely made me question my own miso ramen methods, it did last year too, but this year even more so. I never heat the miso, a fan of its raw, unadulterated pungency. But I sometimes wonder if I should be more bold, to cook it if just for a bit in the wok to tame it, or to cook the whole batch of tare down a bit first before use.\n\nI also don\u2019t noodle fold in miso anymore. I used to, but you can\u2019t really see it, and most shops I went to didn\u2019t bother, often they put the noodles in first, then dump in the wok. \n\nThere\u2019s something in general less refined about ramen up here in the snowy frontier of Hokkaido. It feels a little more rough around the edges. That isn\u2019t to say they don\u2019t use high quality ingredients, or act in the kodawari way, but places with chef coats are rare. I kinda like that. I kinda like ramen that is a little more for the people. \n\nOne day I\u2019ll figure out where my ramen sits in this continuum. Part of me wonders what regional styles can exist for America\u2019s ramen while still feeling cohesive and part of the dish\u2019s lexicon. For now, it\u2019s fun to know the regional style.

Opened in 1947, their long history is proof that this concept had fans in the past, the long lines in front of the shop show its popularity today.\n\nThe ramen soup at Honke Daiichi Asahi is made only from pork bone broth without further additions and a soy sauce seasoning made with local soy sauce. The shop is very particular about the ingredients they use, sourcing only locally and high quality products.\r  \nWhen people think about tonkotsu or pork based ramen broths in general, the first mental image is a thick and creamy soup. At Honke Daiichi Asahi, the soup is mostly clear, falling into the \u201cchintan\u201d clear soup category, rather than into the \u201cpaitan\u201d thick or creamy soup category.\r  \nHowever you want to call it, the soup is full of umami and makes you want to empty the bowl as soon as the spoon hits your lips for the first time.\r  \n\r  \nThe chashu topping is as classic as can be, a lean juicy piece of pork chashu, with a nice soft bite to it and properly seasoned. In addition to the chashu, there is a heap of kujonegi, the typical local variety of green onion.\r  \n\r  \nLocation wise, you can find Honke Daiichi Asahi less than 5 minutes away from Kyoto station. Super easy access.\n\nIf you would like to know and see a bit more of this ramen bowl and this shop, I made a short video review about it: https://youtu.be/vvQVcvau4vo", "This looks insanely good. Really appreciate your high quality posts on this sub", "This place is really very good, the gyoza are very impressive too.", "Hey that's awesome  I've had the exact same bowl!

The old shop has since closed and the master went on a hiatus until 2016, when he reopened at the current location near Chikatetsu-Narimasu station.\r  \n\r  \nThe main items of the shop are their classic chukasoba style shoyu ramen and their tsukemen, which are close in style to the Higashi-Ikebukuro Taishoken style of tsukemen.\r  \nThe broth, which is used for both, ramen and tsukemen, is made with a mix of chicken, pork and various dried fish elements. Taking some sips of the soup, it has the distinct sweetness and vinegary sourness of the Taishoken style tsukemen, although I feel like this soup here had more body and a full aroma. The noodles were medium thick and I fully expected the typical soft noodles, but was pleasantly surprised when they had a good al dente bite to them. \r  \n\r  \nDon\u2019t miss out on the additional toppings at Benten. Their chashu and menma topping you see in the video in the soup is hard to pass up on, especially since both chashu and menma are delicious and worth every yen. You will see some people having those as \u201cotsumami\u201d, flanked with a beer, while they are waiting for the noodles to be prepared, even during lunch on a weekday. That\u2019s how good they are.\n\nIf you would like to see some more of this tsukemen and the shop, check out this short video: https://youtu.be/HjhTySAeKgw", "TFW I Haven't had breakfast yet and this is the first thing I see....", "looks so good \ud83d\ude0d", "I feel like there should be a best ramens in Tokyo guide sticky", "So delicious", "Omg look at all that menma"]}

However their menu is actually quite extensive and includes tsukemen, nodoguro fish based shoyu ramen and mazesoba. In this video, I would like to showcase their incredible mazesoba, which tends to be overlooked by most.\r  \n\r  \nCompared to their regular ramen, you get a minimal amount of broth at the bottom of the bowl, which is combined with a good amount of fragrant chicken fat and their soy sauce based tare. The result is a more rich and condensed soup which clings to the noodles like a pasta sauce. On the side, you will also get a very creamy egg yolk, sitting in some tare. I\u2019m guessing it is cured in the tare, because it wasn\u2019t completely raw. You also get a small slice of lemon. Once you receive you bowl, you also get some instructions from the staff for the recommended way to eat your meal. They recommend to add the egg after half of your noodles are gone and to add the lemon for the last couple of bites. Furthermore there is an option to get some very good white rice, which can be added at the end to soak up the leftover \u201csauce\u201d to polish the bowl. I recommend adding it when you still have a few noodles left and mix it all together.\n\nIf you would like to see a bit more of this bowl and the shop, check out this short video: https://youtu.be/WhxvJd-dyvI", "Excuse, mark this NSFW next time! \nThis looks so friggin good!!", "I can\u2019t really have egg yolks so this has me seeeeething in jealousy and hunger!!", "Out of curiosity do you yourself eat every bowl of ramen you post?

Knowing his vice and sphere of chicanery was in trucking and transport (he owned and ran a trucking company in Tokyo)\nthat the chances of him having a stake in Yatai money was slim, and if I was asking something I shouldn't,  he would be glad to set me straight.\n Not wanting having a jacked Yatai set up in my dining room ( although....if I ever go back, this would be MY fashion statement) with my nosey landlord, and some friends that MIGHT belong to the crews that DID make a little dough from the stands...we set it up for 1 night before my pack-out.\n It was a pretty good plan, after all....he had the trucks to load it into, and....knew the best locations in tokyo to do our shopping, I felt pretty jazzed and confident, that I WOULD have a Yatai dinning room someplace in North America.\nUntil his mom passed the day of the night we had set.\nSo, at least I have no worries of being on some Interpol list, or an L.A. based wing of the Yakuza and would probably recommend just building one.\nThis guy might be of help\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2Fp5kmeZlk4", "I know this Ojii-chan he is in Toranomon every Thursday's nights.

Wanna share some details on that one? Recipe/ingredients?", "A lot of requests for the recipe, here it is:\n\nEquipment:\n\n* A food suitable plastic container or similar\n* Weighting scales\n* Heavy duty aluminum foil\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngedients:\n\n* Pork belly, skinned\n* Sea salt\n* Garlic powder\n* Onion powder\n* White pepper (Edit: I forgot to add this earlier)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSteps:\n\n**Brining**\n\nPlace the container on a weighting scales and press the 'Tare' button to set it back to zero.\n\nPlace you meat in and enough water to cover it.\n\nCalculate 5% of the weight and this is the amount of salt you need to add. Remove the meat and add the amount of salt you calculate to the water. Mix it well so it all disolves.\n\nPut the meat back in, cover and set in the fridge for 10 hours.\n\n**Wrapping**\n\nI dont use the traditional method to trussing the meat with twine, you can if you want but with this method its unneccessary and actually much easier this way.\n\nTake your meat out of the brine solution and lay it fat side down. Add some white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and salt to the side facing up. I usually add about 2 tsp of each and rub it all in, its up to you how much you add, you could start with this though.\n\nYou are ready to roll. Roll up the pork belly into a roll as tight as you can and place it seem side down on some foil.\n\nI usually pull out a long piece of foil, but dont tear it of yet and set the losely roll meat, seam side down at the edge.\n\nThen you need to start rolling the meat with the foil, trying to keep it tucked in and as tight as possible. I do this until its has been wrapped with maybe 5/6 layers of foil. Remember it has to be super tight! It may take a few attempts, but its really important for this to be as tight as possible.\n\nYou should have some foil protruding from both sides, you need to fold this down. I use a chopping action with the side of my hand to try keep it as tight as possible to the side of the meat while push out as much air as i can. Once I've done this, i fold the side bits back upwards. You can wrap again with another sheet if you wish to make sure its all sealed in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cooking**\n\nThe easist bit. Just put it in a pre heated oven for 3 hours @ 150c.\n\nWhen its done, take it out of the oven, dont remove the foil, and let cool to room temp. Then place it in the fridge overnight, still wrapped in foil.\n\nThe next day you can remove the foil, scrape of any lumps of gelatin and fat that have solidified around the meat.\n\nYou can sear the meat in a very hot pan with some oil, turning it frequently, but the pan MUST be very hot with a good layer of oil before putting the meat it (It will splash a lot!). Its a very quick sear, you do not want the meat in the pan very long or it will heat up internally and continue cooking (drying it out)!\n\nOr my prefered method, sear it with a blow torch.", "WOW!

Usually knuckles and short rib, oxtail is also good too. You need some bones with connective tissue on them as these are collagen rich and will convert into gelatin giving the stocc body or mouth feel, less watery.\n\nBlanch the bones, discard the water and clean the bones and pot.\n\nRoast the bones with a little olive oil @ 230c until they turn golden brown.\n\nAdd the bones back to the pot and fill with fresh water. Make sure everything is covered by at least 1-2 inches of water.\n\nI use a ratio of 1:1 bones to water. Simmer them gently for 7-8 hours, never let it boil, it should just be bubbling slightly. Do not stir the contents at all, just leave it alone for the full cook time, checking to making it never boils only.\n\nWhen finished strain the liquids and refridgerate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tare**\n\nThis is almost the same as u/Ramen_Lord's Toyko shoyu tare recipe. You can find his in the link bar above.\n\n400ml kikkoman soy sauce\n\n100ml blend of several more high quality soy sauces from Japan\n\n100ml mirin\n\n100ml sake\n\n1 tbsp cane sugar\n\n50g kombu (use the best quality you can find, hidaka or ma-kombu for example)\n\n6 shiitake mushrooms\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoak the kombu and shiitakes in the soy overnight. The next day add the rest of the ingredients and bring the contents close to a boil and immediately take of the heat and let everything steep for 10-15 mins, then strain the tare and you are done.\n\nI used about 2.5 tbsp of this to 350-375ml of beef stock. Adjust it to your liking, its usually a good idea to make a test bowl first and start with a small amount of tare and gradually add more, keeping note of the amounts you add and final total.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Noodles**\n\nI would just go with u/Ramen_Lord's noodle recipe for his [Tokyo shoyu](https://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/2w6ubu/an_update_to_my_homemade_tokyostyle_shoyu_ramen/) ramen in the link bar above. Or if you have access to buy fresh noodles. Or if you dont feel like making any or dont have access to buy fresh ones, use some dried noodles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aroma oil**\n\nI used all the fat I skimmed from the beef and fried some red onion, sun dried tomatoes and garlic in it until things started turning golden. Again strain and reserve.\n\nThis should keep a long time in the refridgerator in a sealed container.  I used 1 tbsp per bowl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other / Toppings**\n\nI added 1/2 tsp black pepper to the bottom of each bowl along with some diced red onion and crush fresh garlic.\n\nTopped with Portobello mushrooms sous vide for 1.5 hours @ 55c with butter, salt and black pepper. Sliced & blow torched.\n\nSirloin sous vide for 1.5 hours @ 55c, blow torch and sliced.\n\nAlfafa sprouts, I think some roasted tender stem brocolli would also make a great topping in this bowl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think thats everything :)", "Recipe?", "My Kitchen you say?

It immediately hit all the ramen magazines and all the ramen heads flocked there to fill their Instagram feeds with their fancy looking bowls.\n\nKare to Men serves a fusion dish of curry and ramen. On the curry side, the spice and flavor combo can best be described as somewhere in between Japanese curry and Indian curry. The liquid for the curry is a ramen style broth, which gives a certain depth and umami to the curry soup, which some other curry shops miss, if they just use water as a base. Kare to Men also serves regular non-curry ramen from time to time, where you can give their soup a try without the added curry masala.\n\nI ordered their beef katsu special bowl, which is limited to 10 bowls a day. The bowl of noodles and curry ramen soup comes topped with a number of beautifully arranged veggies, a ajitama ramen egg, the limited edition fried beef, a bowl of turmeric rice on the side and some cheese, on the side as well. When you order your bowl, the shop staff will ask you, if you want your bowl spicy or not. I went for the spicy option, which had a nice spiciness to it, but nothing unbearable, so you don't have to be a spice head to be able to stomach the spicy bowl. The noodles that come in the bowl are thick, slurpy and stand up well to the rich curry soup.\n\nBeyond serving curry ramen, Kare to Men also serves curry with their fragrant yellow rice, so if you are not a fan of noodles, you can also try their great curry without them.\n\nKare to Men is located in the East of Tokyo, next to the not so well known Kiyosumi-shirakawa station (\u6e05\u6f84\u767d\u6cb3\u99c5), which is served by the Hanzomon and Oedo line, therefore it can easily be accessed from basically anywhere in Tokyo. From the station, the ramen shop can be found within a less than 5 minute walk.\n\nIf you would like to see more of this bowl and a short review, check out this short video: [https://youtu.be/ExS3OvDsOoE](https://youtu.be/ExS3OvDsOoE)", "Kind of reminds me of Soup Curry from Sapporo", "Mmmmm mud.

They specialize in light shio and shoyu ramen which are worth a spot on the ramen travel lists, if you are making a stop in Odawara.\n\nThe broth at this shop is made with mainly chicken and some dried fish elements. The pork chashu is also boiled in the soup until tender, so some porky elements are also present in the finished soup.\n\nI went for the shio ramen for which the shio ramen tare is made with sea salt from Vietnam. The resulting shio ramen soup is light and aromatic, but doesn\u2019t drag you down too much compared to other soups. It really feels like the owner went for the type of ramen that she wants to eat.\n\nThe noodles are very thin and fit well to the light soup. They almost reminded me of Western wedding soup style noodles.\n\nAnd of course, the ajitama egg is very much on the soft boiled side, but well seasoned. I quite liked it as a change of pace.\n\nIf you would like to see some more of this bowl of ramen and this ramen shop, check out this short video: https://youtu.be/YXvYQxb6HFM", "Soft boiled Ajitpai?", "I can't soft boil an egg correctly for the life of me istg", "I gasped and blushed\u2026shittttt", "[this reminds me of](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FZFZl0ZaFSU)", "Inside me please", "I do like to marinate mine in soy sauce, too, but this all looks fantastic.", "This needs a NSFW tag", "Cant stand when people dont marinate them at all.", "\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75", "Yes perfect egg", "*insert orgasm noises*", "It's me again. \n\nI challenge you to break it lengthwise!

Pork was succulent and tender with great flavor, the egg had the perfect consistency, and the spiciness was phenomenal. Noodles had great tooth to it and the right thickness. It's almost like they had two layers to them and they probably have the correct cooking time down to the second. Couldn't ask for a better bowl. \n\nComing in, I was expecting the ramen to be the spiciest thing ever because of stories I heard on the internet and thought it would be something straight out of Man vs. Food.\n\nI ordered the Oni or \"Devil Level\" with a bit of the numbing pepper. Wanted to experience the full, fiery inferno of the dish (or so I thought). The broth was spicy but not unbearably spicy to the point where I would be writhing in agony. I took a small sip, waited for the spiciness to kick in and it never did. Took another sip... still nothing. Then went ahead and ate like normal. Great depth, spicy, and I could still taste the amazing flavors of the soup. Low key, I wish it was spicier. \n\nBe right back, going to make a reminder to throw all my instant ramen packs in the trash when I get back to the states. \n\nPro Tip: If you want to tackle this challenge, but afraid of the spice messing up your digestive system, eat 1 or 2 bananas about 10 minutes beforehand.

To be more precise, they serve tonkotsu-gyokai tsukemen, which blends pork and fish into a thick gravy-like soup, which is then used as a dip for cold ramen noodles.\r  \n\r  \nHama Momiji has a couple of interesting features. First of all, it is one of the few female owned and run ramen shops in Japan. Still a rarity in Japan, this shop is run by a woman in her early 30s since 2017. But just being run by a woman won\u2019t make a shop survive for 5 years in the highly competitive ramen scene around Sakuragicho station.\r  \n\r  \nThe main draw of Hama Momiji are the in-house made noodles, which can be ordered in 5 different shapes, which range from thin and hand massaged to thick and flat, not unlike some Italian pasta styles. For convenience, all available noodle shapes are displayed next to the vending machine to make your decision easier. You will be asked about your preference when handing in your ramen ticket.\r  \n\r  \nThe noodles are served cold shocked on a separate plate next to the soup. The shocking with cold water is done to get the perfect texture for the noodles, slurpy and chewy at the same time. \r  \n\r  \nThe soup is a classic tonkotsu-gyokai with good notes of both pork and fish. Compared to others of the same style, the soup here is a bit on the sweeter side, but not overly. \n\nIf you would like to know a bit more about this shop and their tsukemen style ramen, check out this short video: https://youtu.be/J9iSvR5u6y4", "I have always thought Tsukemen could benefit from using broad, flat noodles.

Specifically, the necessity of blanching and soaking bones to make a Tonkotsu pristinely white, and to remove off flavors. I would say... maybe you don\u2019t need to?\n\nThe bones for this Tonkotsu have been roasted for an hour until browned thoroughly before being used in the soup making process. The rest of the method is basically my pressure cooker method in the menu, so it\u2019s FAST, maybe 4-5 hours, most of which is hands off. The resulting soup is pristine white and has no funky flavors. \n\nThis is a foundational challenge to a lot of lore in ramen. Predominantly, that the myoglobin and other scum that exits the bones as they initially boil creates off flavors and discolor the soup, and that browned/roasted products further impact the final color. Clearly it isn\u2019t as cut and dry as that; at no point did any skimming occur in the process, and the bones were VERY roasted. Everything in the roasting tray went into water after. No scum was removed. \n\nWhy this works I\u2019m not sure. The running hypothesis me and the nerds on the /r/ramen discord (y\u2019all should join if you can) is that by denaturing the scum in advance of submerging it in water, the myoglobin is less likely to dissolve into solution. This seems fair from a color perspective, but I don\u2019t think it answers everything. For one, what about the flavor? That scum is still sitting in water as it cooks. And what about the color from the bones themselves?\n\nThis also challenges the notion that a rapid boil to remove funky volatiles is required. An hour seems sufficient. \n\nAnyway, here\u2019s the full method for components\n\n*Soup*\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 lbs pork neck bones \n* 2 lbs femurs \n* 3 L water\n* 12 garlic cloves smashed\n* 10 grams ginger, sliced into coins\n* 1/2 an onion, cut into chunks\n* 2 green onions\n\nSteps:\n1. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees\n2. Roast the bones on a sheet tray for 40 minutes, roasting halfway through, until browned thoroughly. \n3. Add roasted bones and water to an instant pot (mine is 8 quarts). Deglaze the roasting tray, scraping up fond, and add to instant pot. \n4. Cover, bring to high pressure, cook 2 hours\n5. Fast release the pot to vent the pressure, then open the pot, add aromatics, and hit the \u201csautee\u201d setting to boil the soup. Do this for an hour, stirring and mashing to incorporate. At least once, find femurs and dig out the marrow within using a chopstick, letting it boil freely in the soup. \n6. Strain the soup\n7. Take about a quarter of the strained soup, and put into a blender. Blend on high for 30 seconds, until white, and then re-incorporate with the rest of the soup\n8. Allow to cool and Store in the fridge. Skim remaining fat when chilled, or re-emulsify with a blender for even milliner results. \n\n*Chashu:*\n\nThis is the new method for chashu I use. It\u2019s pretty tight. It combines braising with roasting to get the textural benefits of braising, with the flavor of roasting. The roasting also reduces the sweetness, by caramelizing the sugar during roasting.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* pork belly or shoulder (amount and thickness just change cooking time)\n* 1 cup water \n* 1/2 cup soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup mirin\n* 2 tbsp brown sugar\n* 2 garlic cloves, smashed \n\nSteps:\n1. Add all ingredients to a pot, making sure the pork is submerged (if it\u2019s not, turn occasionally during cooking). Cover the pot and Simmer for 90 minutes, or until the internal temp of pork is at least 195 F. Thicker cuts will take longer to cook. \n2. Remove the pork and place on a rack set in a baking sheet, reserving the braising liquid. \n3. Preheat the oven to 450 F  \n4. When the oven is heated, roast the pork for 8-9 min, or until deeply dark, caramelized and rust colored. \n5. Place the pork into a container, cover with boiling liquid, and chill in the fridge overnight. You can reuse the liquid to make more chashu, or add it to tare for soup. It\u2019s also great as a marinade for eggs\n\n*Tare*\n\nThis is just a tare that won\u2019t impact the flavor too much. Ample msg to balance. Pretty easy to make. \n\nIngredients:\n\n* 225 g water\n* 50 g mirin\n* 25 g sake\n* 7 g kombu\n* 6 g dried porcini\n* 6 g sababushi (feel free to use katsuo)\n* 225 g usukuchi soy sauce\n* 30 g salt\n* 10 g sugar\n* 15 g MSG\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Combine the water, mirin, sake, kombu, mushrooms, and sababushi in a small saucepan\n2. Bring to 140 F, cover, turn off the heat, and let steep for 30 minutes. \n3. Discard the kombu\n4. Bring the pot to a boil, boil for 5 minutes to remove residual alcohol\n5. Add the remaining ingredients, whisk to combine and dissolve, and bring to a boil again.\n6. Turn off the heat and allow to cool, another 30 minutes.\n7. Strain and reserve 6 months in the fridge", "I'm fairly new to this but I have a very basic question: when putting together a bowl what should the ratio of broth to tare be", "[deleted]", "I was reading your write up on insta on this one and saw the story.

Link to the discord?", "Trying your Pressure Cooker Recipe for the first time this weekend! Thanks for the write up \ud83c\udf5c \n\n1) I notice that you did not use the fatback (1h) and then blend technique here and instead just blended some broth. Do you recommend this version or the fatback technique?\n\n2) I see that you were able to use the Sautee function to boil. My Instantpot has this feature. Did you find this method worked similarly to transferring all contents to a large pot to get to a rolling boil?\n\n3) Seems like there was a couple hours less boiling at high pressure. Did the roasting facilitate that and allow the overall cook time to be less?\n\nThanks again!", "Think this would be a good method for chicken bones for a chintan or paitan soup?", "> 1/22 cup of soy sauce\n\nTypo? :]\n\nThis sounds awesome, and I'll have to join the ramen discord.

I did a lot of research beforehand and my main source are the recipes from serious eats. I did two mini versions of ramen and would like to hear your thoughts about my making process. Feel free to ask me anything and I tried to describe my making process.\n\n\nChintan Broth\n1 laying hens (Frozen).\n\n1 leek\n\n1 carrot peeled\n\nDozen shallots peeled\n\n4 broccoli stems peeled\n\n\nPre cook for 10mins to break up frozen chicken\n15min cooking under Soup setting to discard the scum.\n\nPressure Cooker for 40mins\n\nAfter finish cooking, I put the oil on top to the side for aroma oil.\n\nI did put the stock and chicken pieces in the fridge for 3 days because I was busy.\n\nAfter 3 days I reheated the stock with a slice of ginger for about 20mins. Boiled the whole pot and poured the broth into a bowl full of veggies for 30mins. I also put in some used Kombu from my dashi for roughly 5mins.\n\nAt the end I poured some pork belly stock from my Chashu attempt into the chicken stock because it was there.\n\n\nDashi\n\n15g of Kombu and 4 large Shitake in a pot overnight. \nAt the next day I heated it up right before it boils. Removed the shitake and Kombu into a bowl and put into the fridge.\n\nTook the cooled pre dashi and boiled it so I could put in around 20g of Katsuboshi. Let in seep for 3min and discard for the side.\n\n\nTori Paitan\n\nTake whole chicken pour in water and cook for 1h20 I also put in 4 pieces of used shitake, which gave a tons of Umami... Probably not the brightest idea. I'm addition to that I throw in some pork belly skin, from my braised Chashu.\n\nAfter cooking it for 80mins I saw that the chicken bones were still too hard so I cooked it for another 40min in the pressure cooker under high pressure. Once opening the pot I noticed that the bones were still too hard! However the broth looked very white and opaque just like how Tori Paitan or Tonkotsu should look like. After having a spoon for taste I noticed a very very creamy texture, which is pretty good. It was the same texture of the ramen spot in Berlin, which also serves Tori Paitan, but the flavour was not as rich chickeny. In addition to that the Shitake probably gave a little too much flavour to the broth after having it cooked in the broth for 2 hours.\nSo I tried to fish out all the hard bones such as wings and thigh and was left with the white broth and tons of meat.\n\nTook my blender and prayed that everything will be alright. I did read a lot about broken blender... But since I took out all the harder bones it should be fine. And YES it did, perfectly blended the meat and fatty skin.\n\nBrought over to a big strainer and sift this meaty mass to get my white broth.\nAfter that I poured the white broth over my veggie mixture, which I used in the Chintan recipe and let that sit there for 30min. \n\nIn addition to that I fished out the shitake from the broth and seeped in my Katsuboshi and some more used Kombu in it for 3min.\n\nTook everything out and done. Chilled in the fridge and on The next day I saw a thick layer of fat on top. Simply mixed with a spoon.\n\n\nGyufon\n\nKatsuboshi and Sichuan dried chilli\n\n\nChashu\n\nPorkbelly\n\n100ml~ Dashi left over\n\n100ml~ Pork broth\n\n80ml~ Soy sauce ( Yamasa (JP) and Sempio Soy Sauce Jin Gold (KR) 3 : 1)\n\n30ml~ Mirin\n\n35g Sugar\n\n4x Green part scallions\n\nGinger thumbsize\n\n\nI boiled roughly 1kg for 10min so it would be easier for me to cut the skin off and removing the scum\nAfter that I boiled in plain water for more than a hour until it gets tender but not super soft tender that the meat almost falls apart.\n\nMeanwhile I prepared some braising liquid. Transferred my pork belly to the braising liquid and cooked until very soft. Since I didn't roll it I had to flip it from time to time. What's left was something like a very fatty tare which I used for me eggs.\n\n\nAroma oil\n\n2 Scallions\n\n3 Shallots\n\n4 Ginger \n\nChicken fat and neutral canola oil\n\n\nTare\n\n500ml Dashi\n\n350ml soy sauce\n\n350ml sake\n\nWater\n\nMsg\n\nMushroom granular \n\n\nRamen noodles\n\n100g bread flour 12.8g protein per 100g\n\n40g soft water\n\n2g sodium carbonate from the laundry aile in my grocery store\n\n1g salt\n\n\nWas my first time working with such low hydration dough. Usually I work with these Chinese wheat dough with 50%+ hydration.\n\nWas a pain in the ass. Cooking time very short because these noodles were so thin. I liked the slimey ramen like texture but it was missing the chew. Probably because I didn't used potassium carbonate, which can be bought under the name potash. But still a great bite overall.\n\n\n\nOverall result\n\nSo my Shoyu Chintan was pretty much okayish. It came out well but didn't worked well together! For the mini ramen I did 150ml of broth, 5ml or teaspoon of aroma oil, 15ml Tare (had to put in more afterwards because not salty enough) and 75g of noodles. When you multiply it by 2 I would probably get a real serving but since I wanted to try them both I downscaled it. Since it was my first time making ramen I seriously don't know what could be made to improve it. Probably of the short time cooking the laying hen? Since I used scallions as topping and aroma oil with a high content of oniony flavour it might shift the balance aswell? Maybe some citrus aroma? \n\n\nAs for my Tori Paitan, yes that was amazing. Creamy, rich and concentrated chicken flavour. Although not as rich and chickeny from another ramen spot in town but solid. Unfortunately kinda dark because I used the tare for seasoning hence everything was a little bit brownish.\n\n\nChashu turnt out super well, like melt in your mouth amazing. Probably a little bit too brown for Chintan, which should be light.\n\n\nRamen egg, I used the broken one which I didn't peeled correctly. Is my assumption right by peeling eggs while they are hot is a lot of less messier and easier? Since I got a lot of stuff to do and didn't peeled them right away and let them cool down in ice water.", "You really put effort into this and it looks amazing. Congrats.", "Solid bowl, especially for a first time. Nice work", "You're pretty critical of your own work (I always am too), but I think this looks great. Noodles look especially good considering it's your first attempt, and you're absolutely right about adding potassium carbonate for more bite next time.\n\nWhen you say it didn't go well together, do you mean the broth flavors? You might find it helpful to pare down the number of ingredients in the chintan at first to see what you like. I had a few questions/comments:\n\n1) You used one hen, but how much water? The ratio will affect the intensity of chicken flavor, as well as the gelatinous mouthfeel. You also mention pressure cooking for 40 minutes, which like you acknowledged seems a bit short to extract everything you want. It's probably also why your paitan seemed to take longer to cook (but gave it extra chicken flavor!)\n\n2) You mention using broccoli stems in the broth. Most stock recipes advise against broccoli or other brassicas because they tend to add sulfurous flavors to the cooking liquid. Even though it looks like you just steeped them in the hot broth after pressure cooking, it could be the source of the off-flavor you didn't enjoy.\n\n3) You list the ingredients for your tare, but not much other explanation. Did you cook them together and reduce them down? You don't have to do that, but knowing if you did or not would explain the level of salt in the end product. The tare should be pretty darn salty, at least as salty as shoyu itself, so if you're adding other non-salty ingredients (dashi, sake), you'll want to reduce the liquid by cooking and/or add more salt to compensate. \n\nHope that helps. Keep making great ramen!", "Looks great!", "Anytime I hear or read Made in Berlin, I think it's a song that was just written lol", "I think that there is a huge opportunity for German ramen fusion. I made the tonkatsu base (broth?) one time and I found that when I reduced it with some mushrooms it was fantastic with a braised pork shank (I once had a braised pork shank at a German restaurant in chicago that was one of my favorite meals ever).

In my experience that is the best way, I find warm eggs much more troublesome to deal with. I shock them in cold running water immediately as it's the best way to nail the cooking time and helps with peeling. With the pin trick they should be quite easy to deal with.", "That looks like you killed it dude.

Inosinate, mostly from fish. And thirdly, guanylate from mushrooms. The easiest thing you can do, is boost Glutimate which is why MSG is recommend so often. Additionally, salting, smoking meats, etc. all enhance the intrinsic flavors of foodstuffs.

I would stick with Cojita or feta, as other cheeses that melt into soup end up condensing into one big block of cheese which doesn't work out in the end. I did not add corn, although I thought about it. Adding too many things to a ramen detracts from the end result.\n\nChopping up the Birria was better than serving it thinly sliced. The wasabi-lime sauce that I whipped up complimented the broth really well too. Lime serves great as a topping, but next time I think it would be even better as an addition to the birria tare instead along with a couple shavings of lime zest. A little acid makes everything better.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zysg8e9seye1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e8fc2a4c73d3e881054a0e396a0f56559b86dc\n\nThis was one of those times I just felt like ramen and kind of winged everything because I had some broth already going, but I'd be happy to lay out a rough recipe if anyone is interested."]}

Generally how it's made is glutumate coming from a plant (usually kombu) and the inosinate comes from the seafood (usually katsuoboshi).\n\nThe problem is that there are basically no natural plant-based sources of inosinate (dried shiitake mushrooms have a little but not much). So you can either skip the inosinate and get a simpler tasting but still delicious dashi (there's famously a three Michelin star restaurant whose basic dashi is just kombu soaked in cold water for 6 hours).\n\nOr you can buy an artificial source of the inosinate/guanylate, either as a pre-made vegetarian dashi or as [a powder like this](https://specialingredientseurope.com/products/flavour-enhancer-e621). You need a *tiny* amount (maybe 0.1g inosinate per 1kg of water), so you'll want an extremely accurate scale and to make a lot of dashi at once.\n\nIf you don't want to go the artificial route, I'd probably stick to just kombu and dried shiitake mushrooms. You could also add a little chicken to enhance it.

Being based in Kyushu, I can attest that the thinner noodles will cook crazy fast.   \nIf you keep it simple, I am sure you can manage to make all these people happy.", "You can possibly parboil noodles but the texture will be substantially different. Purists may not like it but what can you do? Some styles can benefit by it like Okinawa soba which is parboiled then coated with oil or even doing tsukemen which is a cold noodle dipped in hot soup. Otherwise, do a super thin noodles which can cook in about 90 seconds.  Definately change out the water or the alkaline flavor will get too strong. But parboilinf will help with that. Otherwise, use fresh noodles with fewer preservatives. \n\nHave a couple soups people can choose from that matches well with your noodles. Don't bother with doing tare and flavor oil separately as this is buffet style.  However, I would think about focusing on a variety of toppings and meets that people can help themselves to. Make sure to include some veggies (I think arugula and other salad greens are pretty awesome) and they can double as salads. The are multiple types of chashu you can do (pork belly, shoulder butt, ribs) and include things like chicken karaage, cheese, wood ear, Nori. \n\nThe other way to go is to have ramen as a noodle bar side offer to compliment the main buffet. Better quality can be achieved that way. I would lean on smaller portions. Typically they are 150g of fresh uncooked noodles. I make and sell frozen kits and I do 120g. In a buffet, I would go smaller so people who want more can come for seconds and try out another combination. Have rice available if you decide to do a string so and people can mix the rice into the soup. Include other doctoral ramen ship side dishes like gyoza, fried rice, beer, etc. \n\nRamen can get pretty expensive to make nowadays especially if you want decent quality and to make soup from scratch. Bones are one thing but even bonito flakes can get really expensive."]}

But their main draw is the combination of both, a bowl of curry ramen which is a mix of both their curry and their ramen broth. Describing it as watered down curry, does not do it justice, since it gets a lot of the richness and the umami of the broth, but keeps the spice and complexity of the curry. Per default, you also get a clove of garlic freshly pressed into the bowl, which really amps up the punch of the bowl and should not be skipped, when you get asked if you\u2019re ok with some garlic in your bowl. Absolutely yes.\n\nRamen and Curry Taigen feels like a must visit if you are exploring the ramen scene of Yokohama and Kanagawa.

The problem with it was that it didnt flavor my broth enough when I tested a small amount with it without completely changing the color of my tonkotsu broth and it also tasted too fishy, how flavor concentrated should tare be ? \n\nI wanted to resort to you guys to not make my broth go to waste.

At its simplest form, it\u2019s just soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar. If you don\u2019t have any of that it\u2019s better to just do soy sauce and sugar and very little vinegar. I like a 2:1:1 ratio for soy sauce, mirin, and sake while adding sugar to taste. A lot of tare for ramen recipes go way too light on the sweetness. I think 3:1:1 is perfectly fine", "If it's bland, there's probably not enough salt. Never heard of cabbage either usually it's just mostly pork bones, maybe chicken too, ginger, green onions really. If it taste's fatty you probably needed to skim off the excess fat during the cooking process. \n\nAnd lastly again, if it tastes bland then it needs salt or tare. If it tastes thin and watery then the stock needs to be reduced more.", "New Wave style tares are simply just shoyu (maybe some MSG), so you could try that. The issue you may be encountering is the ratio of broth to tare. I go 300mls stock: 30mls tare, but adjust as you see fit.", "Have a look at Ramen Lords Ebook", "As others have said, Ramen Lord's ebook is easily the best resource out there, and it's free! If you do take a look in there, I think choosing the easiest tare you see is the best you can do, which is maybe the \"Bare Bones Shio Tare\".\n\nTares can be extremely nuanced and complex, and it's so easy to get lost in the sauce (literally) by combining dried fishes, soy sauces and other umami components that are hard to find depending on where you live. Apart from that, these are all flavor bombs that layer over each other.\n\nThe bare bones shio tare is easy and it will season your soup as well as give you a free flavor boost with the MSG. It will also help you keep the pretty white color of your soup! \n\nBy going with simple things first you can develop your palate, build on that and begin adding layers with other umami components.\n\nMeasurements are ~30mL per bowl, as per the book.", "What even is this thread? First of all, with any cooking, you should probably not experiment on your first try. Pick a recipe, stick to it, and see what you like about it. Experimenting is adjusting to bring in more, and enhance flavors you enjoy. Second, ramen broth by itself is supposed to be bland. Salt brings out flavor, and without it, there isn't much to someone without a developed palate. One of the main tenants of ramen is combining broth and tare just before serving. It creates delicate flavor that dissipates over time. Next, shoyu tare will always color a broth. You could use lighter shoyu(s) to have a smaller effect, but in my opinion flavor trumps aesthetic. A shio tare is your best bet though. A tare shouldn't be horrifyingly salty, but definitely pack a punch. The general ratio is around 10 : 1 soup to tare. 20cc tare and 200cc soup is around standard but small adjustments are always needed if you want to make something special. Possibly lastly, cabbage is a fantastic addition to ramen broth because of its high glutamic acid content which creates umami. Your problem here is the type of soup you are making and when you introduced it to the soup. Tonkotsu is generally a pork only broth, and as a paitan broth you boil the crap out of it. In a chintan broth, it shouldn't boil and bring out all the cabbage flavor just release its umami. Some do it different, but I usually add it and most of my aromatics for the last hour of cooking. It should not ever be in the pressure cooker. Sorry if I come off as frustrated, but the comment section had me steaming. \"Read the e-book\" isn't why they asked for help, what a lazy comment. And all the people talking ill about using cabbage in a broth? I guess Sano-san couldn't make good ramen?! Take advice here with a grain of salt. You have a lot of work to do, but trying at all and having the interest is all that matters. Happy cooking!", "Do you by chance have a Walmart near you? Walmart has been a lot better about their Asian products, mine near me stocks Kombu and I\u2019m\nCurrently living in a pretty small city, it could be worth checking out and seeing if they have anything else you need. And check and see if you can find some Bonito flakes. I also don\u2019t know how you feel about MSG, but i like adding it to my broths and stocks I make", "Okay a few things to address. \n\nYour broth shouldn't taste like cabbage, I'm not sure who told you to use cabbage as an aromatic... It's a very strong flavor. That being said as long as the flavor of the Tonkotsu itself is still mild, it's fixable. \n\nSecond, the goal of food is to taste good. So don't worry about your tare changing the color of your broth.\n\nTare should be extremely concentrated, extremely flavorful, and unbearably salty on its own. \n\nI personally think a miso tare is just so much easier. \n\nUse 4tbsp miso, 1/2 cup soy, 1/2 cup mirin, 1/4 water, a large shallot, 5 cloves garlic, 1 inch ginger. \n\nHard Simmer soy sauce mirin water and aromatics for ~10 mins until completely soft.

You can use an allium (green onion, yellow onion, leek) and maybe a bit of ginger, garlic, mushrooms, but not cabbage. Use that as a topping.\n\nYou can get the saltiness from your tare and toppings.

That\u2019s what makes tonkotsu in Japan so tasty, so please don\u2019t listen to people telling you anything about msg-free recipes and throw any tare recipe that doesn\u2019t have msg into the trash for now.\n\nOn the most basic level you could simply dissolve some salt and msg in hondashi for a tare. You can get some idea of the measurements from my Shio tare recipe. At the bottom I\u2019m also saying something about msg: https://www.namajapan.tv/ramenblog/shio-tare-recipe", "I use a few aromatics at the end like shallots, green onions, garlic, and ginger. Only for the last 30-40 min. Cabbage isn\u2019t an aroma I want in that mix.\n\nMy usual tare starts with a fish base and builds from there. Dashi mix, anchovies, bonito and kombu. The rest of it is soy, sake, mirin, msg, and salt, cooked down with a little more ginger and garlic. If it tastes fishy the proportions are off. If it tastes anything besides extremely salty, the proportions are off.\n\nIf you want that white tonkotsu look you need to do a shio tare or use (expensive) white shoyu.", "You shouldn't eat cooked puke"]}

Stir to ensure the flavor is evenly mixed.\n5. **Simmer**: Let it simmer for another minute or two, and then it's ready to serve!\n\nYou can also enhance it by adding extra ingredients like vegetables, meat (especially lamb for authenticity), or herbs if you like!\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details or have any specific questions about it!\n\n\\*this is just a possible solution provided by a tool. i guess we can kind of confirm this is true if we open up the package."]}

Add the dashi to your chintan in increments until you get the flavor your like. Or don't do a double soup at all and stick to chintan. You can strain each separately and combine.", "Niboshi might be harder, but there are a few online sources of quality katsuobushi in the UK. Try [Clearspring](https://www.clearspring.co.uk/) or [Ichiba (Japan Centre)](https://www.japancentre.com/en), they might at least have something like niboshi stock base too.\n\n(As others have said, powdered dashi is not the worst thing in the world.)", "I would mix 100ml of dashi into 200ml of AP chintan, this is easy to do with each bowl. If you are struggling to get a hold of niboshi or katsuboshi, I can relate to this. Do you have a east-asian markeds in your area? They usually have dried sardines (and other small fish) as a sub for niboshi. Shitake or porchini (or any other dried mushroom) works fine for dashi. You can also use smoked mackerel as a katsuboshi sub. Dried shrimp works fine, better with shio tare imo. Molluscs are delish, but expensive, unfortunately for me I\u2019m allergic to them."]}

When the water has boiled, I add the noodles, turn the heat down, add the seasoning, before lowering the heat again and adding more garlic/onion. \n\nThe result looks a little more refined than standard ramen, and it tends to have a much richer flavor. Obviously breaking the noodles into rice sized bits makes it look different, but if you just do the normal half/quarter based break you can end up with something that looks a few steps above normal instant ramen. In terms of flavor, I tend to find that the garlic/onion almost magnifies the general flavor of the ramen itself, and it makes it a little richer.

Bring to 170 degrees over medium low heat, remove kombu, add niboshi, season with salt, sugar, and msg. Once it\u2019s been barely simmering for about thirty minutes, turn off heat, add bonito, let steep for 5 minutes and strain. \n\nFor aromatic oil, I rendered chicken fat from the skin I tore off the chicken backs used to make the stock.

I achieved what I wanted in terms of a chicken-y flavor, but the cannellini bean aquafaba is cloudier than say chickpea aquafaba.

Lock in and here\u2019s my breakdown. \n\nRamen Break Beats (First location) \n- Shoyu Ramen \n- Tablecheck reservations are done midnight JPT and will open 7 days in advance. So for example if you land today and wait till midnight to make reservations, it will be 7 days from now\n- Notes: I\u2019ve had it twice now and it\u2019s a solid bowl of ramen. Clean broth with the perfect accompaniments of different styles of pork. The seating inside the restaurant is small I think there\u2019s about 8 seats. Location is in the Meguro neighborhood. A bus will take you roughly 8 minutes walking from the Meguro station. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. I\u2019ll probably make a point to have it every time I\u2019m back in Tokyo. Or if I could manage to get a reservation. \n\nRamen Afro Beats (second location) \n- Tori Paitan Ramen \n- no reservations needed, I\u2019ve had three separate times now and just did walk ins. \n- Notes: Almost felt like a creamy chicken tonkatsu-like broth. He adds this spiced espuma to the broth which gives it a beautiful color. Feels like a heartier and richer bowl. Location is about 4 minutes walking from a Marunochi line station in Shinjuku so it\u2019s really easy to get to. \n\nRamen Jazzy Beats (third location) \n- Niboshi style ramen \n- table check reservations not as crazy as the first one but I still would check. Did not have to wait till midnight JPT time to make it. \n- Notes: this one is really unique since it had a stronger seafood flavor for the broth. This style adds a rich umami to the experience and it was a nice touch compared to the classic Shoyu or Hakata style ramen. Location is in Nakameguro. It was close by to the Starbucks reserve roastery so you can plan a morning trip around visiting the roastery and then making the trek to the restaurant. \n\nNotable Mention: \nUsagi \n- just go. The truffle ramen was the best I\u2019ve had my entire trip and just listening to Nujabes during my entire meal was a core memory for me. Nostalgia from hearing his music for the first time while I was a freshman in high school. Absolutely unforgettable. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re a lover of hip hop beats, I highly recommended adding Chef Yanase\u2019s three ramen shops to your rotation alongside with Usagi. Each of his three shops play music according to the name. Break beats to bring you back to the days of Bboying with your friends. Afro beats to give you that extra exciting flare.

{"title": "Ramen Adventures in Osaka & Fukuoka - Feb 2025", "selftext": "Just returned from a trip in Japan and managed to try four highly rated (on Tabelog) ramen shops in Osaka and one in Fukuoka. I solo dined at all of these.\n\nPictures appear in the order below:\n\n1) Moeyo Mensuke - Osaka\n\nMy favorite from this trip. Arrived at around 7pm on a weekday and had to queue for more than half an hour. Their special ramen was already sold out by the time I ordered, so I got the standard ramen with additional duck meat and pork bowl. This is duck ramen using a shoyu-base. Soup has a deep umami with slight sweetness. Not too heavy and very drinkable. Noodles are thin. I loved the duck meat which was cooked to medium and the semi-charred leeks. Pork bowl had a good charr, very satisfying. As a complete package, this had the most refined taste out of all the ramen I tried this trip. \n\n2) Kadoya Shokudo - Osaka \n\nThis is the highest rated shop in Osaka. Arrived right at opening time on a weekday and there was already a small line, but there was space at the counter for one diner so managed to skip the line. Ordered the signature tsukemen (upsized noodles) with recommended pork trotter topping and an egg. Cooking time was quite long and waited nearly 20 mins. This was a very satisfying bowl, I believe it is a shoyu-based dipping sauce but with a vinegary kick to it. Dipping sauce looks heavy but turn out to be quite light. Very easy to slurp with the noodles. Pork trotters (if that is your thing) were smooth and gelatinous. Price is quite steep - 3600 yen all in. Most expensive compared to all the other ramens I tried which were often around the 1500 yen range with add ons. \n\n3) Kirimen - Osaka\n\nA little far away from downtown Osaka. Arrived around 7pm on a weekday and queued for about 20 mins. I ordered the signature egg ramen, kaarage,  pork slices and egg toppings. Ramen comes with just a raw egg and you are supposed to mix well and add desired soy sauce and pepper to taste. Noodles were on the thicker side and paired well with the egg. Kaarage portions were generous (but not that crispy) and the pork and egg topping were ok. I regret not getting a rice bowl to not let the leftover egg sauce go to waste. While a satisfying bowl, I would stick with their tsukemen next time. Most patrons were eating it and it looked good. \n\n4) Chukasoba Kazura - Osaka\n\nSmall counter shop in a business area. I arrived at 1pm on a weekday and there was no queue. Had the shrimp and chicken paitan. Broth was super creamy and even foamy (no milk so I am not sure how they did it). Noodles are on thicker side. The broth was very interesting - it was like Singapore Laksa without the spicy heat. Felt like I was eating a fusion pasta due to how creamy the broth was. Also had the pork bowl that came with a pesto sauce, paired well with ramen. Delicious. \n\n5) Hakata Issou Main Store - Fukuoka \n\nSecond highest rated ramen shop in Fukuoka city at time of writing. Arrived about 15 mins before opening on a weekday and there was already a snaking queue outside the shop. Waited nearly 45 minutes to be seated. As you queue, you can smell the soup (which smells like wet socks lol). I ordered the signature ramen with all toppings. This is Hakata-style ramen (thin noodles, tonkotsu-based soup) and I will describe this as Ichiran on steroids. The broth was very porky, deeply umami and creamy. Pork was melt in your mouth. Super delicious and satisfying bowl. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ja3vn7", "created_utc": 1741839709.0, "score": 135, "author": "Single_Rutabaga_4776", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/ramen/comments/1ja3vn7/ramen_adventures_in_osaka_fukuoka_feb_2025/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I'll be in Osaka tomorow and Fukouka in a week and I've hot listed these lol ?", "Kazura uses a stick blender just before serving to make the foam, so heavy but so good.

You need some fat in the soup, some collagen, and a rolling boil for a while, usually even 1-2 hours are enough.\n\nI have done fish paitans in the past at home.

I have used madai and kinmedai in the past which have close to no \u201cfishiness\u201d which could be off putting.

I can\u2019t say if that\u2019s a good idea or required for salmon.\n\nBut I can recommend, if you have access to fish heads and other fish leftovers after filleting, they\u2019re usually super cheap, so just give it a go.

Both had whole chickens broken down, breast & legs removed. For the pork bones I just used plain old pork backs. I thought the first batch was a little too thin for my liking, so I did another and pressure cooked an extra hour in order to get better extraction, as well as boiled an extra 30 minutes to get a more concentrated soup. Blended both together and was happy with the results! Green onion, ginger, garlic cloves, and a whole onion quartered for aromatics at the end.\n* **Tare:** This tare is based on ramen lords spicy miso tare in his book, with a couple alterations.

Any tips?", "10 ajitama?  In **this** eggconomy?!\n\nSeriously though these look lovely.  Congrats on your amazing technique.  As a scientist I am impressed by your methodical approach and solid recordkeeping.", "Hi,\n\nin order to get eggs consistent:\n\nImportant is the size (Medium eggs in europe are around 63g), the temperature (out of fridge or room) AND shocking them in ice cold water. Those are the most important variants in order to get the perfect cooking time every single time.\n\nI also would go full blast on the boiling water, dont reduce to simmer BEFORE adding eggs.  \nSo depending on how much eggs you put in the pot the temp doesnt drop too much ---> one variable is always set to 100C, so one issue less to control. Same reason for the ice shocking-->ambient temp is not a variable anymore. This way you guarantee your eggs are cooked at 100\u00b0C and are shocked and cooled as fast as possible in ice water every time. Now if they come out of fridge you also have that temp stable. \n\nI think reducing to a simmer is ok for 2-3 eggs, once you add more eggs the temp will drop too much---> boiling water is cooler--> eggs take longer.\n\nGetting perfectly marinated eggs imo is much easier with an equilibrium brine and 48-72h (imo three day eggs are perfect). \n\n1:1 soy mirin is quite the harsh mix, thats around 8% of salt.  really hard to get the marinade all the way to to the yolk without having them go super salty, but that's a personal preference. I think you are on the right way with your approach to find \"your\" perfect egg :) \n\nMake sure to read Ramen Lord ebook for some extra infos on soup! :)", "Did a similar experiment a few months ago when I moved to a new place!    \nI was having such a hard time getting consistent jellied yolks and my peels were a crap shoot due to too-soft whites.   \nRan a dozen eggs in 30s increments 6:30-8:00 and did a few different temperature tests to find the sweet spot!  \n\n\n(For reference: I'm at 2,068m. I punch a pin hole in the large end, get the water boiling, put the eggs in and stir them for 2min as the water comes back to boiling, and let them cook for another 6m, for 8min total. They go straight into an ice bath for 20min. Peel and I usually do a 3parts Soy, 1part Mirin, 1part Rice Vinegar, and a few tbsp of \"garlic juice\" for 24-36hours. Come out perfect every time, yolks are mostly jelly with just a hint of runniness!)", "Looks great, 6 min 30 secs for serving over rice and 7 for ramen. Debate if you want but I know I\u2019m right", "I bet they taste good! Looks like you did get some decent curing despite removing them from the marinade.\n\nPersonally I do this:\n\n\\* hole in the bottom  \n\\* 6 minute boil full heat  \n\\* Into the ice bath  \n\\* Marinade in the fridge for 3 days\n\nTry this and take one out after the first day, cut it open, check it out. Do the same on the 2nd, and then the 3rd day. I think you'll be convinced that the 3rd day is the sweet spot for an absolutely perfectly textured curing of the yolk. And the even brown coloration you get from leaving them in longer is more pleasant visually and will give you the best possible presentation.", "Really nice work and thank you for sharing, I\u2019m definitely taking notes to continue perfecting mine. My biggest battle is the peel, I have recently found great success in making a tiny pin hole in the \u201cbottom\u201dof each egg to help it separate from membrane during boil, 2-3 weeks old helps too due to air penetrating. For what it\u2019s worth, here is my personal recipe:\n\n* (6) large eggs, 2-3w old, room temp, pin-hole bottoms\n* (1/3) cup light soy sauce\n* (1/3) cup mirin\n* (1/3) cup sake\n* (1) tsp sugar\n* Optional:\n   * (1-2) tsp/cube fresh grated ginger, and/or..\n   * (1) tbsp roasted sesame oil, or..\n   * (1) tbsp wasabi paste, or sriracha..\n* Salt & vinegar for egg boil\n* Bowl of ice water\n* Ziploc quart\n\n1. In sauce pan whisk soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, (+ optionals), bring to light simmer, set aside to cool.\n2. In small pot gently boil eggs with salt and vinegar, set timer to 8 minutes upon first egg added.\n3. Attempt to 1/2-roll each boiling egg \\~4\u2019 mark\n4. Shock eggs in ice water until cooled.\n5. Very carefully peel eggs (from \u201cbottom\u201d in tight, chipping spiral toward \u201ctop\u201d)\n6.

I\u2019m not a crazy fan of tomato in general but my goodness that tomato worked! Overall a fun experience and tasty ramen, I\u2019ll take the katsoboshi salt onto other Ramens. It\u2019s odd that the noodles are the star\u2026. I think noodles serve a purpose and ramen and it says something when the noodles are the legit star of the show of this ramen dish. That\u2019s not just my opinion but those of my friends.\n\nI served 7 bowls of this ramen and then 7 bowls of my own Shoyu Ramen called the smoke show! \n\nSmoke show entails a take on the kezo shoyu ramen and ramen lords lighter shoyu Tare but I added smoked shoyu and some other modifications in measurements as well.\n\nI used the new wave Tokyo style noodles, an applewood smoked chashu pork belly, and an egg yolk confit in the smoked chashu sauce. I also added my secret Tare and brown sugar saut\u00e9ed Shiitake mushrooms that I absolutely ADORE!\n\nBoth were a crazy hit! And both use the same double broth. Chicken Chintan and Dashi.

This will give you a light and clear chicken base for your tare, which provides all the salty flavor. You could use a miso, shio, or shoyu tare. If you want more like a paitan bone broth, you'll want to boil them hard and for a very long time. \n\nEdit: PAITAN not CHINTAN", "Don't over-think it. Broth is made by boiling things for a very long time. That's pretty much it. \n\nThe simplest broth with chicken wings is to just boil the wings until the meat falls off the bone and run it through a strainer. When I make broth this way I add chicken bullion while it's boiling to give it some extra flavor. Some people will run their broth through a cheesecloth to clarify the broth. My palate isn't that refined so I just strain the meat out using a fine metal strainer. \n\nWhen you boil meat there is usually a layer of dirty white scum that will start forming on he sides of the pan. Just skim it off with a spoon and get rid of it. \n\nIf you've never made broth, I would suggest experimenting with all those chicken wings. Use a small 2-3qt pot and try making different broths by varying the number of wings-to-cups of water. Try one with bullion. Try some with different vegetables added. Get creative. \n\nIt's a little more labor intensive but you have a better idea of finding what you personally like. You may also stumble onto a broth you want to use for other things.

You have to understand the cultural context to understand why this is a thing: in Japan, ramen is considered the working man's meal. So there's a mentality that it shouldn't exceed 1,000 yen. And it stayed under 1,000 yen for the longest time. They call it \"The Wall of 1,000 yen\", because ramen shop owners can't break that wall, or they'd be considered price gouging. However, as the cost of material and utilities go up, the ramen shop owners are caught in the middle. So in an attempt to keep the price TAG down, they are coming out with these 1,000 yen naked ramen. You are free to put the toppings back on for additional charge. But the baseline price TAG is at 1,000 yen.\n\nIt's not gonna be a thing outside of Japan because for example, in North America, ramen is considered gourmet, so people won't bat an eye if it's like $20. And the exchange rate is all different so there isn't a \"wall\" of any arbitrary price.\n\nPersonally I'm super sympathetic to the ramen shop owners. Customers expect a \"Wall of 1,000 yen\", but the ramen shop's landlord doesn't give him a \"Wall of (fixed rent)\" and the power company doesn't give him a \"Wall of (fixed kWH rate).

{"title": "Seasoning the soup X using tare in the bowl", "selftext": "I saw a post here asking about this matter, and the comments were basically saying to use tare, without any explanation, which is quite sad. Here is my opinion about this matter. Please leave a comment if you agree/disagree with my points.\n\nRestaurants use tare instead of seasoning the broth in advance for three key reasons:\n\n1. Versatility \u2013 The same broth can be used for shio, shoyu, miso, etc by simply changing the tare. Not seasoning in advance gives flexibility.\n\n2. Preserving Aromas \u2013 During service, restaurant broths are kept boiling or almost boiling for quite long time. If soy sauce or miso is boiled too long, it loses some of its delicate aromas.\n\n3. Consistency \u2013 As the soup evaporates over time, pre-seasoning would concentrate the saltiness, making it harder to maintain a consistent flavor.\n\nAt home, those last 2 points are not that relevant. Unless I\u2019m making a large batch for a party, I don\u2019t find it necessary to follow the restaurant method of adding tare directly to the bowl. Instead, I prefer making and adding the tare into the pan while reheating the soup on the stove.\n\nRestaurants tested their recipes hundreds of times, and have test bowls every single day of service ensuring the exact tare amount provides a balanced bowl. However, at home, where I\u2019m making batch of 6\u20138 portions, I don\u2019t want to waste 2\u20133 portions just to adjust the tare. Adding tare while reheating allows me to fine-tune the taste before serving. If 20ml of tare isn\u2019t enough, I can add a bit more. If the broth is too salty, I can adjust with more broth, dashi, or water\u2014something much harder to do if the tare was already in the bowl.\n\nI would personally recommend that if you are at home, making small batches of ramen, to make a tare and season only the portion you\u2019re serving directly on the pan. If you\u2019ve made 10 portions of broth but only need 2 now, just reheat those 2 portions with the tare, taking care of not letting your soup to boil to avoid any loss in aroma, while tasting and adjusting the flavor. While the soup reheats, you can reheat the bowl, cook the noodles and put the aroma oil in the bowl.\n\nTakuro Yanase, ramen chef of Ramen Break Beats, follows this method\u2014he reheats the soup together with the tare. Although I can\u2019t say for certain if he does this to taste every bowl before serving or if he has other reasons.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/0uhsdwdsizke1.png", "created_utc": 1740358313.0, "score": 104, "author": "FreshBook8963", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ramen/comments/1iwpifo/seasoning_the_soup_x_using_tare_in_the_bowl/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I don't think it's the end of the world to season in the pot, but I think you're overstating how devastating it is to just use a tare, which I'd much rather do because I can simply follow the same process whether I need one bowl or ten.\n\n\nI can't imagine why you would toss 3 bowls out of 6 just because you're using a tare. There's no seasoning in the broth, so the main variable is how salty the tare is, which if for some reason you're improvising every night, you can taste before combining it. I would just get it in the ballpark and serve.\n\n\nThe only scenario I can think of where this is important is if every bowl you serve is critically important to dial in perfectly, every night is a new unknown recipe, and you're doing all this in such high volume that the cost matters.", "I see your point, it is more efficient for home cooks to season the broth with tare beforehand, but I don't do so. I always calcualte the 1,5 salinity to a T so I basicially never have problem with adjusting and thsi ensures consistency and If I want to test i do 100 g soup to 10 ml tare. Plus I really like the way it feels to add the hot soup to the tare and have it change colours especially a shoyu. Kinda like flamb\u00e9eing you don't have to do it but it does feel cool.", "I feel there's good points for both approaches here, but I'll add my two cents, since I like salt or salinity better than my guests.\n\n'course, I could add the normal/expected tare amount to the soup and bump my portion up in the bowl, but by now I'm more used to just slightly adduction on the fly when I get to my bowl.\n\nAlso, sometimes I'd like some shoyu in my bowl, but my most frequent guest is a miso head, so.", "You mean V not X, right?", "Delicious \ud83d\ude0b"]}

If you boil soy sauce for too long, it loses some of its delicate aromas. Another reason is to maintain consistency\u2014since the soup evaporates over time, pre-seasoning would concentrate the saltiness. At home, you don\u2019t have those issues.\n\nTherefore, unless I\u2019m making a big batch for a party, I don\u2019t do it like restaurants, where they put the tare directly in the bowl. Instead, I add the tare to the soup while reheating it on the fire. Restaurants have tested their recipes thousands of times\u2014they know that using a precise amount of tare will balance the soup. At home, I don\u2019t want to waste 2\u20133 portions just to adjust my tare perfectly. I find it much easier to add the tare while reheating, so I can adjust the taste before pouring it into the bowl.\n\nSo, I would advise seasoning just the exact amount you are serving. If you made 10 portions of soup but will only eat 2 now, just reheat those 2 portions and season them (directly or with tare) just before plating.", "Tare", "Absolutely not.

It all depends.\nIf you are making the broth just for couple of servings,  it might not be worth it. \nOn the other hand, if you have them separately, you can season with absolute precision and experiment like crazy, w/o wasting the whole broth."]}

If I\u2019m going to spend a long time making a chintan I\u2019m gonna keep it chicken flavor focused so I can make a lot of it, freeze most of it, and then can use it for other recipes too.\n\n2. I find that when I put a room temp dashi in a hot bowl and then ladle the **super** hot chintan onto the Dashi, the super heating reactivates the aromatics in a unique way and the starches and fats of the dashi create a complexly bodied broth as they denature.\n\n3. If I really don\u2019t want to make a long soaked dashi from scratch though but still want a double soup - I\u2019ve found I can cheat the double soup method by creating a dashi inside my tare by hot quick simmering the kombu and katsuo in my tare as I\u2019m 10 minutes away from pulling my tare off the heat. The secret touch though is that when you are 2 minutes away from getting ready to pull the tare for straining (kombu and kastuo are in there), while it\u2019s still on the heat add a very heavy handed dose of Vietnamese Fish Sauce. (The fish sauces made in Phu Quoc and contain a minimum amount of wheat proteins are best). This replaces the niboshi and its quick, easy, and keeps for a long time.", "Here for comments & insight \n\n\nI add the elements at the end of my chintan cook, but only becasue I'm lazy lmao.", "At work I've started doing both? Sort of? Overnight dashi of kombu and bushi, the shift we finish the broth the dashi gets brought to 170, kombu taken out, then kezurikatsuo and dashi get added to broth for the last 30 minutes of boiling (tonkotsu broth).  Kind of annoying since you have to time it so the dashi volume doesn't cause the final volume to exceed our target batch yield, but it tastes a LOT cleaner than boiling the katsuo directly in it, is faster than steeping after the boil is done, and I personally like the additional bushi smokiness you get from boiling it for a bit. \n\nDISCLAIMER: this is relevant only to thick-cut katsuo, and paitan. Pretty much every chintan gets made with double soup OR a steep off the heat with hanakatsuo to minimize off flavors and reduce cloudiness.", "You pretty much summed it up perfectly. I usually do a fish based soup aka dashi and an animal based soup usually chicken. I find that making them separetely gives me more control over the taste, the amount I finally blend in, its flavours are extracted at a more optimal temeperature and lastly it reduces risk because I once ruined a batch of chintan because the niboshi got too bitter when I added it directly. So I feel I'm better off separating them.", "The main reason is purely because they are separate ingredients. In both a home cook and restaurant operation setting, your stock and dashi are two separate components that can be reused for dishes other than ramen. Dashi especially is foundational to all Japanese cuisine\n\nTare and braising liquids, and any other soup for example often can and does use dashi. If I just dumped all of that in the broth then I have no dashi\n\nEdit: Dashi also loses potency unlike broth the longer it sits so keeping it separate makes it a lot easier to debug your flavors"]}

Being completely honest, I did take other pictures, but my hand tremors were pretty bad that day, and most of my pictures are really shaky. Anyway, onto the review! \nFood 8/10. The ramen (I got the basic Tonkotsu bc there was no spicy miso at the time) was the star of the show, with a rich and oily broth that sits in your stomach like a warm hug. But the supporting cast was no slouch either, with the spicy tuna and crispy rice having a delightful hit of jalepeno, the gyoza having the perfect ratio of filling to wrapper, the salad being a refreshing reprieve from the more heavy items, and the curry being the best thing on the menu. If you\u2019re old enough to drink alcohol, I really enjoyed the yuzu margarita, which cut through the oiliness of the broth. \nService is where the score drops, with a 5/10. It was a Saturday night, and the location has only been open a couple of months at this point, so I\u2019m willing to give the benefit of the doubt and say it\u2019s probably not always this bad. But multiple things were missing/forgotten about by the kitchen staff, and stuff was generally chaotic. Our waiter was great, and explained everything perfectly. \nAs for ambiance, 7/10. It looks like every other \u2018hip and trendy\u2019 restaurant, with exposed brick, decor that is acceptably palatable, and low lighting. REALLY low lighting, to the point that I was struggling with reading the menu at points. Moving around the place was difficult, but I attribute that more to the place being packed to the gills. Still, be aware that it might not be the easiest place to move around if you\u2019re in a wheelchair or need to use a walker. \nOverall, I\u2019d give this place a 7.5/10, but I\u2019ll probably go back during spring break and test my theory that it would be much better on a weeknight.

In Sapporo, sometimes this involves searing miso in a wok before adding soup and boiling. If you\u2019re looking for a more rounded, muted flavor, this is a good option.\n\nUltimately it\u2019s just a preference thing.

Already did it, it works.\n\nThe globality of the debate between putting tare in the bowl or in the broth, I'll just say \"do what you want\". there is situation where it's important to put in the bowl first, and some where it's more usefull to put tare in the broth.\n\nat first, it's just a restaurant consideration. they put tare in the bowl because it's the best way they have to make different bowls. you can have 2 broth, but if you have 3 or 4 tare, at the end you can have 6 or 8 differents bowls. it's interesting because when you make broth, it take time and it consume space. so there is a usefull reason of \"putting tare in the bowl\". Once the tare is inside the broth, you can't change the taste of broth.\n\nBut at home, it's almost useless to think like that since you'll make the same bowl for your friend/family\n\nthere is some exceptions. For example, I scheduled a ramen party in two weeks, I'll put shoyu tare in the bowl. BUT for my friends at the end of the party, they will go home with enough material to make another bowl, but with miso tare, thus they can taste the difference between shoyu and miso. so I just can't put tare in the broth. Another example, I want to help a gaming association to schedule a \"manga night\" by making ramen for them. to help me serving 30+ bowls, since it will be the first time I'll make that much, I'll put tare in the broth because there will be only one type of bowl.", "I put my tare in the bowl, then aroma oil, then broth. If it's a thick tare like a miso I'll whisk it in the bowl to make sure it incorporates, but I'm starting to do more frequent ramen dinner parties for friends where different people are picking different tares, so this is just a lot smoother for me + I don't worry about holding miso mixed into broth over heat affecting the flavor at all.", "I put my miso tare into a hot bowl, with the aroma oil, and whisk it. Then I put my noodles in, fold them, add the broth and then add the toppings.", "I usually throw the miso paste in the bowl first and then the cooked noodles after I give them a rinse. I had the problem you mentioned with the paste not breaking down then I figured out I could stir the noodles into the paste and kind of spread it out.

{"title": "Ramen log through our first Japan trip! \ud83c\udf5c", "selftext": "Didn't have as much ramen as I wanted due to an unfortunate stomach ulcer development halfway through the trip (needless to say our preference for rich broths isn't compatible with that haha) but I wanted to share the places we did visit on our first trip!\n\n1. Hakata Furyu, Tokyo: The very last ramen spot we visited! Tonkotsu is my partners absolute favorite ramen and this hit all the marks for him; amazingly rich and flavored pork bone broth, & we loved the shop's policy of up to 2 free noodle refills/kaedama with the option to decide noodle doneness. (kata ftw) There also was a spicy mustard greens pickle that I added way too much of because it balances the fatty broth so well.\n\n2. Gion Duck Noodle, Kyoto: Definitely the most modern style and expensive ramen shop we went to, but that did not make it less delicious. The duck meat was so tender and the clear duck & dashi broth with the sansho pepper was exquisite. As someone with a sensitive stomach that prefers poultry, this was my favorite broth we tried. Also had the most brilliantly colored softboiled yolk, I wish I had a picture.\n\n3. Tenkaippin, Kyoto: We stumbled in here on one of those days where you're starving and looking around on the streets, and no regrets there. Chicken is definitely my preferred kotteri style, and the addition of vegetables to the broth made it not too rich for my palate! As a side note, in general I really enjoyed how much Kyoto cuisine celebrates their vegetables. :)\n\n4. Rokurinsha, Tokyo: We made it an objective to go here after we explored Tokyo Station our first day and saw a queue as early as 7 am. The dipping broth was an amazing pork & seafood flavor, and the thick noodles were SO unctuous and addicting. Each dip was perfectly coated, and converted me from a tsukemen skeptic to a lover since apparently I have only ever had shitty tsukemen til that point lol.\n\n5. Ginza Kagari, Tokyo: Funnily enough, despite being my preferred chicken paitan broth and the shop I was most looking forward to, it was the most disappointing of the bunch. I didn't care for the toppings and the broth had a buttery note beyond the usual richness I did not like much at all. The quality was evidently top notch, but I would not return.\n\n6. Hakata-Nagahama-Ramen Miyoshi, Kyoto: After a nightime hike up Fushimi Inari peak, we swung by this ramen bar since it was open til 1 am. It served the exact job it needed to do for us, and had an amazing spicy menma that added a kick that cut through the tonkotsu broth I don't often see in tonkotsu spots where I'm from. Between this and Furyu, I really wish more tonkotsu shops included complimentary spicy toppings!\n\nCouple end notes:\n\n1. I am now a firm believer in Japanese negi over standard green onions, I could eat SPOONFULS of it haha.\n\n2. Next time I want to try more styles with assari broth, like Tokyo style ramen.

I\u2019ve already noted what I could improve on. \nUnfortunately some ingredients are difficult to source here in Toronto for more complex ramens but I\u2019ll manage.\nLuckily I was smart enough to purchase some ingredients while in Japan & had been waiting to use them. \nOverall great experience making ramen at home, I\u2019ve never attempted anything like this before & my wife was impressed by my dedication spending the whole day making the stock, toppings, & sourcing everything.\n10/10 will definitely be making ramen again!
