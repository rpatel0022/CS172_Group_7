The result is a fall-apart tender, flavor-infused pork taco that your family will request again and again. \n\n## Ingredients\n\nServing12 \n\n* 3 pounds pork butt, cut into 2-inch cubes\n* 2 cups pineapple juice\n* \u00bc cup white vinegar\n* 1 orange, juiced\n* 1 lime, juiced \n* 1 cup chopped onion\n* 4 cloves garlic, chopped\n* 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce\n* 1 tablespoon chili powder\n* 1 teaspoon cumin \n* 1\u2009\u00bd teaspoons salt\n* \u00bd teaspoon ground black pepper \n* 1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning with achiote\n* vegetable oil as needed \n* 20 ounces pineapple chunks, drained\n* 12 (10 inch) flour tortillas\n* \u00bd cup chopped red onion\n* pico de gallo salsa\n* 1 avocado, diced (optional) \n* chopped cilantro (optional)\n* 1 lime, cut into wedges \n\n \n\n## Directions\n\n* **Step 1**Place pork in a large lidded container. Combine pineapple juice, vinegar, orange juice, lime juice, onion, garlic, chipotle peppers, chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, and sazon in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour sauce over the pork and make sure all chunks of meat are covered. Seal the container and marinate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.\n* **Step 2**Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot\u00ae) and select Saute function. Add vegetable oil and heat until hot. Add chunks of marinated pork and brown on all sides, reserving extra sauce, about 5 minutes. You may need to work in batches depending on the size of your Instant Pot\u00ae. Turn off Saute mode and pour reserved sauce over the pork. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 35 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.\n* **Step 3**Release pressure first using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure using the manufacturer's quick release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.\n* **Step 4**Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\n* **Step 5**Remove the pork chunks from the pot using tongs or a slotted spoon, and place them on the baking sheet. Reserve the sauce in the Instant Pot\u00ae for now.\n* **Step 6**Use forks to coarsely shred the pork, removing and discarding any excess fatty chunks. Spread meat out evenly on the prepared baking sheet. Add pineapple chunks to the baking sheet with the meat, then place the baking sheet under the broiler. Broil until the tips of the meat and pineapple are beginning to get a little brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven.\n* **Step 7**Use a spoon to drizzle the reserved sauce from the Instant Pot\u00ae over the meat to moisten it and add some more of the marinade flavor.\n* **Step 8**Create tacos by portioning the pork and pineapple chunks on flour tortillas. Add chopped red onion, pico de gallo salsa, avocado, and cilantro. Garnish with lime wedges.\n\n## Nutrition Facts\n\n**Per Serving:**431 calories; 14.1 g total fat; 43 mg cholesterol; 1338 mg sodium. 54.2 g carbohydrates; 21.5 g protein", "Just did in the IP this past Friday!  Slightly different recipe, but they were glorious!  I had 5 lbs of Porto shoulder.  It\u2019s just my wife and I, but this will feed us for many meals to come.  Shredded pork freezes very well by the way.  Especially if you have food saver.  But just with a ziplock is to very easy to get all the air out and freeze.  I recommend making a ton of this if you do and freeze in meal size portions."]}

I rarely ever buy fresh food as much as I\u2019d like to, it just ends up going bad- so I honestly just stick with canned or boxed or frozen food.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best thing to start out with? This should be pretty easy going forward now yes? lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/196tebi", "created_utc": 1705274198.0, "score": 63, "author": "KoleTownsend94", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/196tebi/new_to_the_instapot_world/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Buy dry beans, rice, pasta and canned tomatoes, and a few basic spices like oregano and chilli powder.

Mash the peppers up with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.\u00a0 \u00a0Add the minced garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, cumin, smoked paprika, lime juice and brown sugar (omit if following a low-carb diet.)\n\nStir the mixture, then add the chicken breasts. Turn and coat the chicken in the tomato mixture, then close and seal up the instant pot.\n\nSet the instant pot for 20 minutes of high-pressure cooking and set the steam release valve to \u201cSealing.\u201d\u00a0 After 10 minutes of pressure cooking, the chicken will be fully cooked, but won't necessarily be \u201cshreddable.\u201d\u00a0 At\u00a015 minutes, most of the chicken will shred.\u00a0 After 20 minutes, the chicken shreds easily and it\u2019s still nice and moist.\u00a0 (This is my personal recommendation).\u00a0\u00a0At 30 minutes, the chicken shreds effortlessly, but it could potentially be a bit dry.\n\nThe instant pot will actually take 10-15 minutes to pressurize, then it will cook the chicken for 20 minutes.\u00a0 Once the time has reached zero you can carefully release the pressure nozzle manually.\u00a0 Be careful of the escaping hot steam.\n\nRemove the lid and transfer the chicken to a large platter or cutting board.\n\nUse two forks to shred the chicken, leaving some of it in small chunks so it still has a little texture.\n\nUse a hand immersion blender to puree the tomato mixture left in the instant pot (or transfer to a regular blender). It should thicken up and yield a little over 2 cups of sauce. (Used magic bullet)\n\nPut chicken in a large mixing bowl and pour \u00bd the sauce over it.\n\nGently use a spatula to fold the sauce into the chicken.\u00a0 \u00a0Add more sauce if needed, or use it as a drizzle on each individual serving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/a6x2ye/shredded_mexican_chicken/", "created_utc": 1545026042.0, "score": 36, "author": "jongery", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/a6x2ye/shredded_mexican_chicken/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thanks for sharing!

Pressure cook for 8 to 10 minutes (fresh) or 10 to 12 minutes (frozen).  Use the higher times for thicker chicken breasts.  Experiment to see what you like.\n3. Do a hybrid release (5 minutes NPR then a QPR), then let it rest for another 5 minutes with the lid off or on a tray/plate\n\nYou can shred with forks, meat claws (my personal favorite), an electric stand mixer, an electric hand mixer, a food processor, etc.  For storage, I typically use:\n\n1. Ziploc gallon freezer bags (good to mix in a sauce & store in the fridge to use soon)\n2. Vac-seal bags (to freeze)\n3.

Quick, easy and consistently makes great rice. I always do 2 cups of jasmine rice, 2 1/4ish cups water. Cook on high pressure for 5 mins. It\u2019s also really easy to turn this into chicken fried rice by adding a bag of frozen peas/ carrots, soy sauce and some chicken. Or you can open up a can of beans, eat them up on the stove and you\u2019ve got rice and beans. (Just keep in mind that different varieties of rice will require different cook times and different amounts of water)\n\n*Lentils- Probably my favorite. 2 cups dried lentils (green or brown), 4ish cups of stock (Better than bouillon works). You can add any type of aromatics like onions/carrots/garlic you like. I typically add mushrooms as well. Season with salt, pepper and cumin. Cool on high pressure for 8 mins. \n               The 2:1 ratio of liquid to lentils typically gets you a risotto type consistency. If you want more of a soup like consistency just up the liquid. I always make extra of this, freeze individual portions in mason jars and BAM, instant microwaveable meal. \n               I also recently made lentil sloppy joes in my instant pot and they turned out pretty good. Might be good for your picky eater and way healthier!\n\n*Frozen chicken thighs- Not sure if this fits your criteria, but this has saved me numerous times. If your anything like me, you will occasionally go to cook dinner only to realize you have nothing to cook because you forgot to thaw out something. No worries. Put a couple frozen chicken thighs in your Instantpot with a cup of water, and cook on high pressure for 5 mins. This will thaw out your chicken and par cook it just a bit. Take out your thighs, place on a baking sheet, and bake at 425ish for 10-12 mins. You may need to play around with temps and times depending on your oven. \n\nJust to mention a few others: pot roast generally works well in a pressure cooker as does pulled pork.

Hope this helps.", "The reason there is no scum on the top of the stock in the IP is because it breaks down and  will disperse in the water as it is boiling under pressure.  This and any fat in the stock is what makes it cloudy and changes the color.  \n\nIf you want to remove the scum, bring the stock up to a real soft boil either using the sautee program or on a conventional stove.  As the water gets hot, you will see foam and fat start to rise to the top.  Skim that off along with any fat.  Wait another fifteen minutes and do skim again.  The more you skim, the more clear the stock will be.  You don't want the stock to come up to a hard boil during this process.  Then you can finish off in the IP.  The foam is denatured protein and is flavorless, so it isn't completely necessary to remove it.  But, if you want a nice clear stock, you'll need to skim all that out the old fashioned way.  If I am real concerned about the quality of the stock I need, I just do it on the stove top and skim it throughout the process to make sure that the quality and clarity are there.  But that process takes way longer than the IP.  I hope this clears it up for you."]}

An outstanding way to take advantage of bargains at the grocer, be it fruit, vegetables or meat.  You can use this instant pot for more than just canning; it also is an excellent rice cooker, steamer, soup pot, slow cooker... the list goes on.  \n\nI highly recommend that you purchase an extra gasket to go along with the purchase of the instant pot.  With 'normal' usage, the gasket will wear out in 12 to 18 months, leading to inconsistent cooking results; finding the right gasket when you buy the instant pot is easy, locating the right gasket a year or two down the road is a gamble.  It's a very inexpensive insurance policy that the machine will work as intended for many years to come.\n\n\\-----------\n\nThe Amazon unit is a smaller, light-weight version of instant pot designed to be safe to operate while sitting on a glass-top stove.  (It does not use the heating element of the glass-top stove, it's simply designed to not be so heavy that it cracks the glass).  \n\nThe JCPenny model is more hype for less power.

You see, the art of cooking is a complex and nuanced field that requires a deep understanding of the science behind it. So if you're looking for a \"golden ratio\" of rice to liquid to chicken, you've come to the right place.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the rice. There are dozens of different types of rice out there, each with their own unique properties and characteristics. Some rice requires more liquid to cook than others, while some require less. Then there's the issue of cooking time, which can vary depending on the type of rice you're using.\n\nAs for the chicken, well, the possibilities are endless. You say you're using boneless, skinless chicken? Well, that's a good start, but have you considered the different cuts of chicken? Thighs, breasts, drumsticks, wings, each with their own unique flavor and texture. And don't even get me started on the different methods of cooking chicken, from roasting to grilling to saut\u00e9ing.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the seasoning. Oh, the seasoning. The herbs, the spices, the oils, the vinegars. Each ingredient plays a crucial role in the final flavor profile of the dish.\n\nSo, is there a \"formula\" for making chicken and rice? The short answer is no. The long answer is that it depends on a multitude of factors, from the type of rice to the cut of chicken to the seasoning used. But with enough research, experimentation, and a keen sense of taste, you just might be able to create the perfect chicken and rice dish that will have your taste buds singing."]}

The IP requires a cup of liquid to cook (which can include the liquid in the food itself), meaning that the chicken will have to sit in the water, which results in 2 things:\n\n1. Some of the dry seasoning will fall off into the water\n2. There is a risk of the chicken fusing to bottom of the pot as a result of the metal pot & induction heating element, possibly causing a Burn notice on the IP display & also resulting in having to scrape the chicken off & scrape the fused-on parts off the bottom of the IP\n\nSometimes the water will do a good enough job for it not to be an issue.  Like when I make crack chicken, I usually just take a couple pounds of chicken breast, chop them up into 3 smaller pieces, dump half a cup of water in (the chicken also has liquid in the breasts), then dump the chunks in. Never had an issue that way:\n\n* [https://www.adventuresofanurse.com/instant-pot-crack-chicken/](https://www.adventuresofanurse.com/instant-pot-crack-chicken/)\n\nI also make easy-dump pasta in the Instapot like once a week.  My trick for that is to coat the bottom of the pot with a layer of oil, then to dump in the pasta, then I put the sauce on top so the sauce doesn't fuse & burn.  Some of the pasta gets a little crispy on the bottom, but not a big deal: (adds texture, lol)\n\n* [https://i.imgur.com/Of5iHq0.png](https://i.imgur.com/Of5iHq0.png)\n\nYou can also buy a silicone sling from Amazon for like ten bucks, just search for \"instant pot silicone sling\".  This raises the chicken up off the bottom & also has handles, so you can just lift it out easily.  This is really nice if you make a lot of chicken (I make a LOT of shredded chicken).", "I\u2019ve cooked chicken in my instapot without the trivet many times.

{"title": "Instant Pot Carrot Ginger Soup", "selftext": "**Ingredients:**\n\n* **3 pounds of carrots,** finely chopped using a mini chopper. Finely chopping helps break down the cell walls of the carrots, releasing their natural sugars and making them easier to cook down into a smooth texture.\n* **1 large onion,** chopped. Onions add depth of flavor and natural sweetness due to the Maillard reaction during saut\u00e9ing, where amino acids and sugars react to create complex flavors.\n* **3 cloves of garlic,** minced. Garlic adds a sharp, savory flavor that mellows as it cooks, enhancing the overall taste profile of the soup.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Ginger provides a warm, spicy note, and its main compound, gingerol, contributes to both the flavor and the health benefits of the soup.\n* **5 cups of vegetable broth.** The broth is the primary liquid, and it helps distribute the flavors evenly throughout the soup while also softening the vegetables.\n* **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Used for saut\u00e9ing, olive oil adds richness and helps in the heat transfer needed to cook the onions, garlic, and spices properly.\n* **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Cumin adds an earthy, warm flavor that complements the sweetness of the carrots and the spiciness of the ginger.\n* **Salt and pepper,** to taste. Salt enhances all the flavors in the soup by reducing bitterness and increasing the perception of sweetness.\n* **1 cup of coconut milk.** Coconut milk adds creaminess and a slight sweetness due to its fat content, which emulsifies when blended into the soup, giving it a smooth and luxurious texture.\n* **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Yogurt adds additional creaminess and a slight tang, thanks to its lactic acid content, which can brighten the flavors of the soup.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables:** Set your Instant Pot to the saut\u00e9 function and add **3 tablespoons of olive oil.** Heat the oil, then add **1 chopped large onion** and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes. Saut\u00e9ing causes the onions to undergo the Maillard reaction, enhancing their natural sweetness and depth of flavor.\n2. **Add Aromatics:** Add **3 cloves of minced garlic** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground ginger.** Saut\u00e9 for another minute until fragrant. This step helps to release the volatile oils in the garlic and ginger, intensifying their flavors.\n3. **Cook the Carrots and Spices:** Stir in the **3 pounds of finely chopped carrots** and **1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin.** Saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes to coat the carrots in the spices, which allows the flavors to meld. The heat also helps to soften the carrots slightly, making them easier to cook and blend later.\n4. **Add Broth and Pressure Cook:** Pour in **5 cups of vegetable broth** and season with **salt and pepper** to taste. Close and seal the Instant Pot, then set it to manual high pressure for 10-12 minutes. During pressure cooking, the high heat and pressure help break down the fibers in the carrots, allowing them to become very tender, which makes the soup easier to puree and provides a smooth consistency.\n5. **Release Pressure and Add Creamy Ingredients:** Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow for a natural pressure release for about 10 minutes, and then carefully quick-release any remaining pressure. Stir in **1 cup of coconut milk** and **1/2 cup of plain yogurt.** Adding these creamy components while the soup is still hot helps to evenly distribute their fat content, creating a rich, velvety texture without the need for heavy cream.\n6. **Final Seasoning and Serve:** Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper as needed. The combination of coconut milk and yogurt balances the sweetness of the carrots and the heat from the ginger, creating a well-rounded flavor profile.\n7. **Serve Hot:** Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs or a drizzle of coconut milk if desired. The final soup should be thick, creamy, and flavorful, with the natural sweetness of the carrots balanced by the warmth of the ginger and cumin, and the richness of the coconut milk and yogurt.\n\n\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "created_utc": 1738274289.0, "score": 8, "author": "Known_Milk_3953", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1idyr7g/instant_pot_carrot_ginger_soup/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

{"title": "Questions from a newbie", "selftext": "I've had my IP since Christmas and I love it, but I do have a couple questions. \n\nI find cooking times wildly inconsistent with regard to the doneness of meat. I think I would do better if I understood the process more. \n\nI mostly cook chicken. Both thighs and breasts. Granted thighs are easier to cook and not come out dry, but there has to be a way to cook breasts so they are not so dried out. I generally brown them first and then cook. \n\nUsually when I check the temp on most recipes, the meat ends up being well over 200 degrees, when we only need 165. But maybe I don't understand the cooking process.\n\nWhat is the benefit of allowing the meat to continue cooking on self-release? Is the actual cooking being done mostly in the pressure stage? Is the temp of the meat irrelevant when it cooks longer in a pressure cooker? Would the meat be better closer to the 165 temp, as it would normally with stove cooking?\n\nAlso with browning, I have a LOT of trouble with the meat sticking. I believe this is due to the convex surface, the oil runs to the edges. The pot is plenty hot, but the meat does not self release well, so I end up browning it too long.

Chiefly with extra protein. Most recipes out there do not have enough protein but roughly are what I want to make.\n\nI am also lazy and I want to make absolutely as much as I can in the pot.\n\nSo I took my 8 QT insta pot and added the following:\n\n* 1 Tbsp avocado oil\n* 1/2 Tbsp worcestershire sauce\n* Onions/Green pepper/Carrots\n* 3 lb ground turkey browned\n* Some spices\n* 15 oz kidney beans\n* 15 oz chili beans\n* 28 oz crushed tomatos\n* 2 Tbsp tomato paste\n* 1/2 Tbsp lime juice\n* 1.5 cups brown rice\n* 2 cups water\n\nThis filled the pot to right about its fill limit.

But not at the same time. It in the same pot, yes, but it has to cook in stages. For example, dry beans need to soak overnight, canned beans are already cooked anyway. The ground beef needs to be browned.\nConsult some recipes and note the stages of the cooking. It will all begin with \u201c Brown the meat\u201d using the saut\u00e9 setting. That\u2019s just using the Insta pot as a hot pot, no slow cooking and no pressure cooking, just like a skillet on a stove top. Personally, I\u2019ll just use a skillet on a stove top . \nNext is cooking the beans. If you prefer to use canned beans that are already cooked, that\u2019s fine too. I enjoy cooking dry beans because I\u2019ve never cooked anything the same way twice. Different spices, etc. They need to soak in water overnight. Plenty of recipes to be found for this, basically add equal parts beans and water and then More water. Having more bean liquid to go over rice or in soup is useful.\n\nThis is where the realization came to me about the instant pot. I have a crockpot that cooks just fine. I have stove top skillets to brown meat. But a pressure cooker is a very good choice for anything that involves boiling water, including steaming.\nNOTE:  investigate steaming foods using a pressure cooker. High food value, low calories, and cooks in minutes. In the summer it doesn\u2019t steam up an already humid kitchen.\n\nI\u2019m learning to use my instant pot to replace anything I boil. Pasta is a good example. Boiling several quarts of water just to boil a few cups of pasta is quite wasteful, plus it needs to be attended to or it will boil over. But in the pressure cooker Pasta can be boiled rapidly without any water waste or steaming up a kitchen during a hot summer. In winters, boiling water is welcome. It warms in eases the dry air.\n\nThis might be enough perspective for now. Consult some recipes and cook ingredients in stages. Only combining at the end for the final result. \n\nA pressure cooker does cook rapidly, but does not cook all the ingredients all at once."]}

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Instapot) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "So, the way that I understand it is that it would be very, very similar to the Dutch oven method. The liquid only boils at the beginning to create pressure. The pressure then causes the boiling point to rise, usually to about 240F, and therefore limits boiling (especially a full rolling boil) to the beginning of the process. Boiling occurs when the vapor pressure is equal to (or exceeds) the pressure in the environment, the ambient pressure. Since it\u2019s a sealed system, it cannot exceed that environmental pressure. When the valve is released, you are dropping that environmental pressure, so you may see some simmering by the time you take the lid of. \n\nThe way that the pressure cooker works is it takes that heat energy that would be released as boiling/steam, and converts it to pressure. That heat energy stored as pressure is forced into the food, causing it to cook significantly faster than the Dutch oven. So you\u2019re cooking at the same temp as a low and slow method, less than 250F, but much faster. \n\nThat being said, I can occasionally taste a difference between Instant Pot and Dutch oven meals - the Instant Pot sometimes lacks a... roastiness? Melding of flavors? That conventional methods extract. Cooking at pressure and then swapping to slow cooker mode is a good way to prep something quick for dinner with some even better leftovers. \n\nI hope that helps! And please, anyone feel free to correct me on any of this, I only have a cursory understanding of how it all works.", "I cooked beef stew using the insta pot button \u201cbeef stew\u201d which set the timer for 35 min and the meat and veggies were tender just like I made it in the Dutch oven.

BUT, if you plan to do a lot of air frying or want to be able to do bigger batches, a separate air fryer is probably a better option. \n\nI haven't had a chance to try the other functions, but I haven't heard good things about using the saut\u00e9 function as it may set off the burn warning. I would rather just use a pan on the stove if I need to saut\u00e9 onions/garlic/brown meat before putting it in the pot, but that's just my preference. I look forward to trying baking, sous vide (one function that really appealed to me) and dehydrate options, and think it would do well with steaming and slow cooking, but I don't see myself getting rid of my crock pot. \n\nSo for pressure cooking specifically, I don't think you can go wrong with the different models. Note that most recipes are for the 6qt, so jumping all the way up to a 10qt might take some adjusting. I think the 8qt is huge. I made rice for 2 yesterday and it looked ridiculous as a layer on the bottom of the huge pot. But it sounds like you need to decide if a separate air fryer makes more sense for what and how much you want to cook. \n\nSorry for rambling! I hope that helps with your decision."]}

Not a 100% replacement for a slow cooker. \n\n1. The recipe must contain water or broth or thin liquid. This is what conducts the heat.  For a 6qt it is 2 cups of water. You need enough liquid.\n\n2. The slow cooking settings on the pot are sometimes confusing. On some models less equals a looney tune setting for items meant to cook 10 plus hours and the item should be brought to a simmer first.  Normal equals less and more equals high.  On others like my  8qt pro is says \"preheating\" but this preheating isn't seeing the temperature in the pot but running for a preset time.  It also isn't really preheating either as it starts counting down the cook time the moment you press start. Basically the pot isn't giving any relevant information.\n\n3. The time is different. The instant pot is slower than a slow cooker.  For every hour on high add 15 mins, So a 6 hours on high in an slow cooker is 7 hours and 30 mins in the instant pot.  Slow cooking on low is closer to the low setting but still a bit longer. I usually cook on high unless I know 100% it can be cooked on low in the time given. Given the time it takes it is better to find a recipe almost done but on keep warm after 6 hours than to find it not done 8 hours latter.  Esp. as the carry over heat and the high setting of keep warm might finish it.  \n\n4.  The heat comes from the bottom.  Think of it as a pot simmering on the stove rather than a slow cooker where the heat is coming from the sides.  This is why a slow cooker can be a bit more even and in some cases handle more in the pot. \n\n5. Consider using the saut\u00e9 function to get things going esp. if there is a lot in the pot.  Don't boil it but use saut\u00e9 to knock the chill off or just barely take it to simmer. \n\n\n\nThere are a few advantages of an instant pot over a slow cooker:\n\n1.  If you have a plastic lid you might be able to fit the pot in the fridge with the ingredients the night before. \n\n2.  You can use saut\u00e9 or pressure cook to finish something.  Saut\u00e9 is also useful for melting frozen broth and reducing the liquid in the pot. \n\n3.  A skillet browns faster and better than the instant pot but saut\u00e9 is less clean up.  An useful trade sometimes. \n\n  \nI have slow cooked roast, soup/stew, greens, neckbones, and string(green) beans.

The water and veggies under the steamer basket make a delicious soup, chunky cut veggies are done just right at 25 minutes on the poultry setting.)

{"title": "Low temperature cooking for meat vs high pressure", "selftext": "I was considering buying an instapot mainly to speed up the cooking of meat stews.\nCurrently I make for example oxtail cuts in a standard pot and it takes even 4-5 hours for slow sub boiling to completely break down the meat and the connective tissue. But the result is excellent with the meat that melts in the mouth. The only problem is that I have to stay the entire afternoon at home, monitoring the pot.\n\nI have friends that said that with a pressure cooker things can be speeded up a lot. From what I remember from school, a high pressure environment increases the water boiling point so more energy will be given to the meat. \nHowever, I also remember from some cooking books that a high temperature is not recommended for stews because it just ends up making the meat dry and tough.\n\nWhat is your experience?\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1hf1epz/low_temperature_cooking_for_meat_vs_high_pressure/", "created_utc": 1734294155.0, "score": 1, "author": "Ordinary_Cat_01", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1hf1epz/low_temperature_cooking_for_meat_vs_high_pressure/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I use the Instapot on low pressure/natural release for these kinds of applications.  But, perhaps a crockpot would work better for you in this case, since you wouldn\u2019t have to babysit the pot?", "High temp does two things: make muscle fibers tough and melt connective tissue.\n\nWhat happens when you use high heat is that the meat cooks rather quickly, making muscle fibers tough, but not long enough to melt the connective tissue. Both are enough, therefore you get chewy meat. Have it run at a high temp for longer, it will become tender (more like just falling apart with a dry texture) as the collagen softens but your muscle fibers are now overcooked.\n\nThats why low and slow works - it doesn\u2019t activate the toughening of the muscle fibers and it also gives the connective tissue time to break down.\n\nPressure cookers work with super high heat. So while yes it also makes the muscle fibers tough, it also very quickly melts the collagen. And we mean quickly.\n\nNow it\u2019s not just all about heat.\n\nTake note of what kinds of meat are often cooked with pressure cookers. It would always be considered a \u201ctough cut\u201d.\n\nAnd all what tough cuts are is just meat with a lot of connective tissue.\n\nNow remember, high heat means melting connective tissue. But if you do that with a normal pot, you will have to cook for a long time, and your muscle fibers will just eventually detach in to small dry flakes and sort of dissolve into the water and not hold their shape.\n\nWith a pressure cooker, you can melt all the collagen quickly into a good edible texture that still holds the muscle fibers together. Tough cuts of meat suddenly become very tender in a short amount of time.\n\nLet\u2019s also look at what you want to make - oxtail. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty much all connective tissue. Using a pressure cooker would be highly beneficial for you, and it would take less than half the time to have edible and tender oxtail."]}

{"title": "Overcooked Beef Again", "selftext": "I put my brisket to cook for 1.5 hours. I know what you're thinking \"OMG, what's wrong with you!\"\n\nThe thing is, I like cheap cuts, but I also like tender meat. No, not tender. Super tender. I mean nearly Texture-less Tender.\n\nIn vein, I try to achieve this by cooking beef longer... But you know what that means- DRY AND STRINGY. I like that the meat falls apart, but the individual muscle strands are incredibly stringy and still quite tough.\n\nDo I cook even longer?\n\nWhat kind of meat preparation should I do before hand? I brined over night heavy salt, should I brine longer? I want to bite into the meat and have the same fall apart texture, but without the dryness and tough strings. I want to be able to cut it against the grain with a fork!\n\nEDIT: \nI found my perfect solution. Stop pressure cooking, and start using the Sous Vide option on my Instant Pot!\n\n1. Salt rub some Brisket and let it sit in the fridge for 1 to 24hours.\n2. Put about 1/2 inch of oil/grease into the Instant Pot, set it to Saut\u00e9, and after it comes to temperature, then sear each side of the meat for about a minute or two.\n3. Place the meat on a plate, and drain all oil from the pot. (The meat will be extremely tough)\n4. Put meat back the pot (mine nearly filled the entire bottom of the pot).\n5. Pour in water so the meat is 2/3 covered. \n6. Put generous amounts of your favorite seasonings on the meat tops.\n7. Add about 1 tspb salt to the water.\n8. Set the Instant Pot to Sous Vide at about 158F (70C) for 3 days. Every 6 to 12 hours, check the meat with a fork or knife to achieve your desired tenderness. For me, about 2 days is the sweet spot.\n9. Optionally, place the meat on a pan, then into a convection oven, and heat the meat at the highest temperature until the meat/fat outside is crispy.\n\nWow, moist, flavorful, and extremely tender! No dryness. No stringy muscle fibers. Best Brisket I ever ate in my life. Technically this is slow cooking (crockpot), but at a lower temperature than standard crockpots operate. Low and slow is the way to go for Amazing food. Lower temperature prevents the fat from being rendered out of the meat, which preserves meat moisture and flavor. Thankfully, I can achieve this in my Instant Pot without needing to buy another kitchen appliance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1csfww3/overcooked_beef_again/", "created_utc": 1715762143.0, "score": 0, "author": "ilikenuman", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1csfww3/overcooked_beef_again/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I think you would be better off using sous vide instead of pressure cooking.", "I've always cooked brisket in the oven - long and slow.

I\u2019ve tried all the cleaning hacks I can find but the only thing that works for me if to wash and air dry it then store it outside the Instapot. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why they added a slow cooker function when it takes 2-3 hours for the unit to preheat before switching to low slow cook.  I contacted the manufacturer and they said this was \u201cnormal\u201d and to add an extra 3 hours to the slow cook time.  THAT IS NIOT NORMAL!  Make it work right or don\u2019t include the feature.  For fear of poisoning us while it preheats for several hours I stopped using the Instapot for slowcooking and bought a slow cooker with a crock insert.\n\nThe sous vide works ok if you add really hot water (about 130 - 135 F) to the Instapot before hand.  It gets up to temperature fairly quickly. BUT the size of what you can sous vide is very limited by the shape of the vessel (think brisket).\n\nNow to the pressure cooker which is supposedly the forte of this thing. Previously I made a beef stew by other means.  I saved half of the browned beef, onion and garlic and other savouries, deglazed the pan and then froze it.  Today I placed the frozen beef and 2 cups of broth in the Instapot.  After 25 minutes on high and 10 minutes natural pressure release, then fast release I opened the lid and stirred to make sure the meat was separated.  I added carrots and potatoes cut in small pieces.  I set the pressure cooker for another 30 minutes.  First the pressure cooker had to preheat again. After the 30 minute cook time was up the message display said \u201cdo not open lid\u201d for over 30 minutes.  I got tired of waiting so I released the pressure so we could eat.  \nThe liquid had to be thickened.   I expected that.  Finally after almost 2 hours (using this wonderful time saving device) dinner was served.\nThe beef was tough. The potatoes were a little too done and the carrots were a little hard. The other half of the beef cooked by a different method was not tough.  \n\n\nHad I realized the issues with the Instapot I would not have bought it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Instapot/comments/1aucwv5/cannot_understand_why_instapot_is_popular/", "created_utc": 1708311833.0, "score": 0, "author": "slmcalg", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/Instapot/comments/1aucwv5/cannot_understand_why_instapot_is_popular/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["In the kindest way possible, I'm not sure you understand what you purchased. You said the pressure cooker had to preheat again after adding carrots and potatoes. This isn't the case.  It had to boil the liquid inside until there was sufficient steam built up to exert 8-11 psi of pressure (range due to different models and settings). Making that much steam doesn't happen at the snap of your fingers and does take time. No recipe will include this time because it varies based on many different factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would recommend trying some of the 'tried and true' websites such as This Old Gal or Amy & Jacky for recipes. And not every dish is going to taste best or have the best texture when cooked under pressure. But that's ok because not every dish tastes good using the same cooking methods.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally love my InstantPot because I could never master the stove pressure cooker and with this, it's as simple as a few buttons. I can also set it and walk away without having to babysit the gauge like I would on the stove top. We did a complete kitchen remodel a few years ago and all meals were done in the InstantPot for about 4 weeks because I had no kitchen - no stove or oven - InstantPot and airfryer were all I had.", "I mean \u2026an instapot is a pressure cooker. You bought a pressure cooker and are grading it on everything else except the pressure cooker? \n\nSlow cook time IS normal, a crock pot will take 4-8 hours on slow cook. \n\nIt takes 15-30 minutes to get up to pressure for any pressure cooker, and this time is not included in the cooking time of any recipe. \n\nIt\u2019s like you don\u2019t know what you bought.", "Sounds annoying, but I\u2019d try using it as intended using a recipe designed for pressure cooker before you hate on it completely. Mine had a weird metallic taste for my first few tries and I was ready to give up, but someone suggested Jacky and Amy\u2019s pressure cook recipes, and after trying a few I was won over.", "With the slow cooking feature, preheat it with saut\u00e9. I get a good bubble going then switch it over. Also high is high, medium is low, and low is keep warm. I usually just keep mine on high, use a glass lid I bought separately, and do the pre heat thing above. It\u2019s great.", "You sound like you have no idea what you\u2019re doing and you\u2019re blaming the instapot. Not all recipes are equal. I found that I only use the instapot for certain recipes.", "Well, I don't actually use all the functions. 1st, I prefer the texture of most meats pressure cooked rather than slow cook. And yes, you made good points regarding the smells the ring can take on, which is why I change the ring out when I make yogurt vs. savory. There is a learning curve. The first couple things I made was a pain in the butt as I set off the burn alert. I've learned what is great to make in an IP and what's better/ faster on the stove due to the function of a PC. My favorite things to make in my IP is dried beans,  such as pinto beans or split pea with ham shank soup. Also, I never thought I'd use the yogurt function, but I make amazing French yogurt.\nYou'll figure it out. I didn't like mine at first but I just bought my 2nd one.", "Regarding the rings...\n\nI just bought additional IP rings.  They're different colours to allow you to segregate them based on the food (for example red is meat, blue for sweet/desserts).", "Instant pots are not the greatest slow cookers, but they're great fast cookers :) I'd say to try some Jacky and Amy recipes! (also if the beef was tough it needed more time. trust me , pressure cookers will destroy anything if you leave it long enough, my go to for tough beef is 40 min-60 min, 25 minutes only if the beef had lots of fat/cartilage and with 20 minutes natural release).", "It\u2019s recommended to have multiple seals.", "A time saving space saving device. \nIf you are trying to sous vide a fuckin brisket you aren't looking to save space...... \nThink a little bit. If you have a nice giant suburban kitchen, there are definitely better options out there. That's why restaurants and high end devices exist. The instapot is what 100$..... I spent 4x that on a blender. I've spent 3x that on a pan. Don't even get me started on knives. \nIf you don't have much space but always wanted to do these things, here is a device that excels at one thing and can do 10 other things well enough if you follow a recipe or are patient enough to tweak your own til it's right\n\nEdit: also if your used to stovetop pressure cookers, electric ones get less pressure so need time adjustment.", "Instan Pot is garrbage. I will never buy another one. My first one was a 6 qt I believe and I got two years at most out of it. I bought an Instant Pot Pro and it just died after 1.5 years of use an nothing but issues with it. I will be spending my money elsewhere instead of on shit products.", "Slow cooking in an instapot is for dumdums", "Cannot understand why someone would go through the trouble of such a stupid post. GFY.", "Honestly kinda sucks. Not sure why I am subbed here", "I have never had a problem with odors in my Instapot because when I put it away, I set an opened box of baking soda in it. That absorbs any odor. Mine came with an extra seal since people complain about odors. I've had the pot for a few years now &, frankly, have no idea where the spare seal is. I don't need it."]}
