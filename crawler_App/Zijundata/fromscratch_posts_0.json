Season to taste. You likely don't need salt. Simmer 30+ minutes as you prepare the pasta. Stir occasionally, optionally add some white wine. \n\nFor pasta, it's egg noodles.

In the bowl with the three yolks, stir in flour until its too hard to continue, then knead in more flour for like 5 minutes.

Add some garlic powder and black pepper or whatever else you want.\n\nAfter dough has rested, roll out into a sausage that's about the thickness of a banana. Cut it into rondels like 7mm thick or so. Flour well, form into a small disk with your fingers, then roll the disk out. Keep well floured. Place blob of cheese mixture into the centre (you'll need less than you expect to need), and fold over, crimping the pasta down starting around the cheese, forming a pouch and pushing the air out. Make sure it's well crimped. Optionally cut the pasta into rectangles, but it's honestly just for the aesthetic, they're super delicious without any trimming and it's less wasteful.\n\nSauce should be reduced and good by now. Keep it at a low simmer still as the pasta cooks. Under cook the pasta a little, and salt the pasta water. These fresh noodles cook fast, so they shouldn't need long at all. Honestly a bit of chew is nice anyway. You don't want them undercooked, just barely perfectly cooked, really. Add them to pasta as well as some of the pasta water, a half cup to start, a bit more if the sauce doesn't thicken up.\n\nSimmer the sauce until reduced again with the pasta in it.

All I know that for me, it is not. They're already sweet enough, but even if I saw this, I added powdered sugar on top. I probably should have made some icing at least for the recipe but I will write the recipe for it anyway.\n\nAnd now, back to these things. We will make 2 different fillings for them. I personally call them poptarts, a friend of mine called them personal pies because they're kinda big, and 1 is enough for a person. So you decide if these are poptarts or not, what's important is the filling. \n\nSo ingredients :\n\nStore Bought Pie Dough. Use homemade if you really want to waste time making one. I personally don't find it necessary. It is better? Depends on what butter you use it can be better or not. But the time consumed, even if is not as much as making puff pastry, is still a NONO for me. \n\nIf you want to make it homemade I'm sure you can find recipes online for it, as they will be better than mine since I didn't made any in a long time. I refuse to make home-made pie dough and puff pastry.\n\nFirst is gonna be a nice Strawberry-Peach-Pineapple jam :\n\n350gr strawberries, 320gr peach, 150gr pineapple, 180gr sugar, 15gr vanilla sugar and vanilla essence, 20gr cornstarch.\n\nJust add all the fruits together in a pan, along with the sugar on low-medium heat and let them cook until they're super soft (between 10-20 minutes). Smash them with whatever you find at home, and add your cornstarch. I mixed mine with enough water to form a paste first. \n\nCook for another 5 minutes and you're set. I personally found this to be a little sweet (I used canned peach and pineapple) and those already had more sugar added to them.\n\nIf you used canned like mine, I think 100gr of sugar will be better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple pie filling. 470gr apples, 100gr sugar, 1 tbsp. cinnamon (you can use less), 10gr vanilla sugar, 25gr butter, 10gr cornstarch.\n\nNow I don't want to smash these. Cook them for around 15 minutes or so, add the cornstarch, cook for another 5 minute and that's it. I didn't smash these because I wanted to feel the apples when I bite into them.\n\nAfter you make these, let them cool down a bit, and cut your pie dough in the shapes you want. Add the filling in the middle, don't overfill, and let the sides empty so you can seal them. \n\nEgg wash, and cook at 190 degree Celsius for around 20 minutes. Just look after them after 15 minutes, because you only need to cook the pie crust. And when you get a nice brown color on them, they're done.\n\nNow Icing. If you want to put icing on them, you just mix fine powder sugar with very little water.\n\nTake like 100gr of fine powder sugar and mix with a teaspoon of water. If you don't get to the consistency that you want, add a little more. Mix like a maniac while doing it. Also you can use milk or lemon/orange juice instead of water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now, enjoy them. I hope you gonna like these, because I know they didn't last more than 1 hour in my kitchen.\n\nI took more time making photos than it took for my family to eat them.", "Those look amazing!!!!

So I made Kinder Milk Slice at home! I love that you have a nice cocoa cake layer on top, with a really nice honey cream in the middle that melts in your mouth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo recipe of course :\n\nIngredients for cake : 4 eggs, 120gr flour, 150gr sugar, 20gr cacao, 40ml oil, pinch of salt \n\nIngredients for cream : 250gr Condensed milk, 500ml Milk, 300ml heavy cream, 2tbsp full of honey, 20gr gelatin, 50gr cornstarch, vanilla extract/essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProcedure : \n\nSo we start by having our eggs + sugar in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer till is very fluffy. Put in cacao and mix again. Now add the oil, and some of the flour and fold using a spatula. Add the rest and continue to fold. Spread it into a baking pan (mine's around 34 by 36 cm) and cook it for around 20 minutes at 180\u00b0C, but not more than 20 minutes.\n\nOk, so now the cream. In a pan, add your milk, condensed milk, vanilla extract and the cornstarch. Put it on medium heat and mix this together. Until this gets hot, get 100ml of cold water and add your gelatin to it. Back to the cream, continue to mix, and at some point, it will suddenly thicken. That's great. Mix it a few seconds more and turn the heat off. Add your gelatin to it, mix it with the whisk really good, and transfer it to another bowl. Cover it with a plastic sheet right on the cream so you won't get that \"skin\". Is not gonna be ruined if you get it.\n\nNow let this cool down to room temp. When this gets to room temp, the cake should already be done and at room temp too or even colder.\n\nGet your whipping cream in a bowl, use a hand mixer, make it fluffy and add it to your cream along with the honey while folding. At this point, you can also add a little natural orange juice. The original kinder milk slice has a citrus taste to it, but is not lemon. Is mandarin or orange something around that. So if you want that, add like a tablespoon or two of that juice and fold it there. I personally didn't add any because I wanted to have more the vanilla honey taste in this.\n\nPut the cream in the fridge for around 10 minutes or more before using it on the cake. The cream should be easy to spread, but at the same time it should maintain shape. Now is time to cut your cake in 2 parts, add the cream on top of one part, and top it off with the other half of the cake.\n\nPress gently on top of it to even things out, and that's it. Leave it in the fridge for at least 4 hours, the best overnight, and the next day enjoy a really great slice kinder milk slice.\n\nI know finding condensed milk is not easy for everyone, but I'm pretty sure you can make it at home. There are plenty of recipes around of making it at home. It is a little time consuming but it is worth it if you can't really find it anywhere else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope you gonna enjoy this and have a good day!", "This is really cool!

Create a well in the center. Crack eggs into the well and add olive oil as well. Using a fork, start beating the eggs in the well, slowly incorporating the flour around it. Once it starts to combine, use clean hands to bring it together. Knead for ~5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky. Wrap in plastic and rest in the fridge for an hour to let the gluten rest. Once rested, cut the dough in half and use a pasta roller/extruder to roll out the dough into a thin sheet. I like to start by rolling the dough through the widest setting, doing a trifold, and rolling out again, then repeating this step once more before rolling the dough through the smaller settings. Make sure your dough is thin, as there will be parts in your ravioli that have overlapping dough and you don't want it too thick. \n\n\nRavioli filling:\n\n4oz ricotta cheese (I used Kite Hill for vegan ricotta but you don't have to)\n\n8oz white mushrooms, chopped \n\n2 tsp dried thyme\n\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 shallot, minced\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nA little olive oil\n\n\n\nOnce your mushrooms are chopped, heat a skillet with a little olive oil to medium heat. Add mushrooms to the pan, allowing them to saut\u00e9 for a minute or two. Add a splash of water to the pan and quickly cover with a lid, allowing the mushrooms to steam and soften. Once they have reduced in size and start to darken, you will notice the mushrooms releasing a lot of liquid. You can uncover the pan and continue cooking the mushrooms until all the moisture has evaporated. Once this happens and the mushrooms are much smaller, add them to a food processor with the ricotta and thyme. With a little more olive oil, add garlic and Shallots to the skillet. Saut\u00e9 for a few minutes until the Shallots become translucent and the mixture is fragrant. Add to the food processor and pulse into a smooth paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. \n\n\nOnce your pasta dough is rested and rolled out into thin sheets, scoop the ravioli filling (about 1 tsp each) onto the pasta dough, leaving room in between them. Flatten the filling a bit with wet fingertips, then cover with another sheet of dough. Cut out the ravioli shapes using a round cookie cutter, knife, or ravioli cutter. Make sure the edges are sealed with your fingers (I like to just pinch the dough together a bit around the edges. You can use a little water to seal the dough but this is optional. Water creates a better seal, but leaves less room for error and is messier). Make sure to remove as much air as possible from each ravioli before sealing. \n\n\nOptional breadcrumb topping:\n\n1/2 cup Breadcrumbs \n\n1/2 cup finely chopped Walnuts\n\nPinch of salt \n\n\nIn a pan set to medium heat, toast the Breadcrumbs, nuts, and salt until lightly brown, fragrant, and crispy. Set aside. \n\n\nSauce/toppings:\n\n1/4 lb pancetta, diced\n\nA handful of fresh Sage leaves\n\n4 tbsp unsalted butter (go for grass fed) \n\n\nIn a medium-high heat pan, cook the pancetta until it is crispy and has released a lot of its fat into the pan. Remove and drain the pancetta, set aside on a paper towel leaving the fat in the pan. \n\n\nCrisp up the sage leaves using the hot pancetta fat. This should only take a minute or so on each side, don't burn them. Set aside on a paper towel. \n\n\nRemove all but 2 tbsp of pancetta fat from the pan. Add the butter and begin to brown. At the same time, get a large pot of water boiling. Salt the water very generously (it should be SALTY). Once you see the butter starting to foam in the pan, add your ravioli to the boiling water and boil for about 2 minutes (no longer! Fresh pasta cooks quickly and your filling is already cooked). Once the raviolis are done, you should notice your butter turning brown and giving off a nutty aroma. Using a slotted spoon, transfer your ravioli into the pan with butter. Be sure to get some of the starchy boiling water into the pan as well, as it will help the butter sauce adhere to the pasta and add salt to the sauce. Saut\u00e9 together for about a minute until the sauce looks thick and is clinging to the pasta. Portion into bowls or plates and top with the pancetta, sage, and breadcrumb topping.", "What a gorgeous and delicious looking plate! Thank you for sharing!", "Incredible", "[removed]"]}

(Age doesn\u2019t matter here.)\n8 Lbs of meaty pork bones, I usually use some combination of shanks, back and neck bones. Whatever\u2019s freshest, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\n4 gallons of fresh or filtered, GOOD water. **\n1 whole onion\n2 heads of garlic\n1 6 oz piece of ginger\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nYou\u2019ll be using two pots to make this stock. One pot will be used to par-boil the meat to remove blood and impurities. The other will be used to cook the actual stock. fill the pre-boil stock pot 3/4 of the way full of water (enough to at least submerge all your meats in) and bring 4 gallons of good water in the actual soup stock pot to a simmer. \n\nWhile water is coming up to a boil, rinse all the bones and carcasses in water as hot as you can stand. If you have the forethought, let them soak in that hot water for as long as you have had forethought to pre-soak. It helps shorten the next step. \n\nPar boil all the chicken for 5 minutes. It will release blood, grease and other mystery \u201cimpurities\u201d into a nice disgusting scum on the top of the water. Get rid of the scum and pull the chicken out, transferring it to the other pot that should be barely simmering. Make sure you don\u2019t\u2019 take any of that nasty scum with you.\nNext, CAREFULLY PLACE the pork bones into that hard boiling water and boil them for around 10 minutes, or until you don\u2019t have to constantly skim all the grey scum off the top of the water. It is very important to \u201cclean\u201d the pork bones in this manner. \n\nYou\u2019re not losing any flavors you want, trust me. Boiled blood tastes like ass. Once you\u2019re confident you\u2019re not taking any lazy shortcuts, get those pork bones under some running water to get the last of any scum off them and toss them in the pot with the chicken.\n\nAdjust the heat until there\u2019s the barest bubble of a simmer and then Let. That. Stock. Sit. I mean, by all means skim off any extra scum that floats to the top because you shortcutted step 4, but for the love of God, if you want a nice, clear golden end result rather than a murky mess (which will still taste good, but looks gross) DON\u2019T DISTURB THE BONES. Just let them poach gently for literally ever, or at least 8 hours which will seem like forever.\n\nWhen your stock has reduced by about \u2154 remove it from the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes to settle. Now it\u2019s time to Disturb the Bones. With the care of a grave robber worried about a curse, gently, gently lift those bones and carcasses out of the bone broth and put them in a strainer set inside a bowl. Let them drain and then pour the amazing juices back into the broth. \n\nUse a fine mesh sieve with a piece of cheese cloth over it and ladle the hot broth into whatever plastic storage containers you want. I usually store them in meal-sized containers, but you do you. Just don\u2019t put them in glass, ok? Cause you\u2019re gonna freeze them, and they\u2019ll burst the glass.

If you make your own stock, make sure it's really flavorful, or reduce it down a bit. If you're stuck with boxed stock, reduce a LOT of it down until it's strong.\n\nThis time I used good, strong turkey stock, which is really the best call for this recipe. (We had a lot leftover from the holidays).\n\n**Ingredients for two:**\n\nTwo thick, bone-in pork rib chops. If you can get the \"frenched bone\" style, it looks nice. You really need good, thick chops for this.\n\nOlive oil and butter\n\nAbout a cup of diced yellow onion\n\nFlour\n\nAbout a half cup of dry white wine\n\nA cup of good stock\n\nDijon mustard\n\nCornichon pickles, about 1/3 cup in 1/4\" slices\n\nChopped parsley if you have it.\n\n**Steps:**\n\nPreheat oven to 375.\n\nSalt and pepper the chops; get them to room temp if possible.\n\nHeat the skillet on almost-high until very hot - add about 2 Tbs olive oil, and then about 2 Tbs butter - once the butter softens, add the chops. Brown until really nicely seared, maybe 4-5 minutes a side.\n\nPut the skillet in the hot oven; check the temp of the chops after 5 minutes - they may take 7-12 minutes to cook. Check a bit off-center towards the bone. If you like rare pork, go for 135\u00b0; I think 145 is about right, really-rare pork is still a turn off to many people.\n\nWhile the chops are in the oven, warm up a plate - I just use hot water from the sink. When the chops are done, put them on the warm plate - I keep it near the burner for the sauce to keep warm.\n\n(EDIT - we're back to the stovetop now!) Toss the onions into the skillet - the residual heat will get them starting to cook; set the burner to medium and toss and stir until the onions begin to brown. Sprinkle about a 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour over the onions - toss and stir for 3-4 minutes so the flour cooks.\n\nPour in the white wine and take a big whiff - this is one of the best smells in all of cooking. Stir and scrape with a wooden spoon or heat-proof spatula to get all the good bits mixed into the sauce.\n\nWhen the sauce thickens (just a minute or three), add the stock and continue stirring. Let the sauce thicken; pour in any juices from the chops-plate. Stir to combine.\n\nAdd about a tablespoon of dijon (to taste) - if you don't love dijon, a smaller amount will give the sauce some acidity. if you overdo it, it will overpower the other flavors.\n\nTurn off the heat and toss in the sliced cornichons and stir to integrate. Taste for salt, Sprinkle with chopped parsley if you have it (this time around, we discovered ours was shot so we skipped it).\n\nSpoon the sauce onto 2 plates and rest the chops in the sauce.\n\n**MAKING SIDES** \\- we did roasted fingerling potatoes this time, but roasted broccoli is great with this too.\n\nTo pan-roast a side, we'll look at the potatoes. Put one oven rack at the lowest position and a 2nd rack above it when you heat the oven. Put a cookie sheet/baking sheet on the lower rack to pre-heat it. You want it very hot.\n\nPrep the potatoes - slice fingerlings in half lengthwise; toss them in a bowl with salt and pepper and enough olive oil to coat. (when you roast potatoes like this, the world is yours as far as seasoning - garlic/onion powder, paprika, cumin, etc - but the sauce in this dish is delicate enough that you want it to really be the star when you slide those browned potatoes into it, so salt and pepper is all you need today).\n\nWhen the oven has heated, heat the skillet and start browning the chops. Once the chops hit the skillet, pull the hot baking sheet from the oven and dump the potatoes on it. using tongs, arrange the potatoes so each slice is cut-side down; return the sheet to the lower rack of the oven. You'll leave it there until the sauce is started.\n\nWhen you reach the step where the onions go in the skillet, leave the burner off and pull the potatoes - flip one over and make sure they're nicely browned - if not, return to the oven until the sauce is done. Then return to the skillet and turn the flame back on to complete the sauce.", "This looks bangin, is this a dish he served at his restaurant?"]}

This one's inspired loosely by Evan Funke's version in American Sfoglino, but i've omitted mortadella and egg in the filling in place of garlic chives to keep it vegetarian. \n\nHere's the recipe:\n\nFor the dough:\n1. Blanch 140g of spinach in boiling, salted water for 40 seconds and scoop out with a strainer. Run under cold water until cool to the touch, then ring out as much water as possible with a cheesecloth.\n2. Add spinach to a blender and add an egg. Blend til a smooth puree is formed\n3. Sift 250g 00 flour into a bowl or clean surface and make a well. Add 100-110g of spinach puree and discard the rest. Add 1 egg yolk.\n4. Slowly incorporate the flour into the liquid until a shaggy dough is formed.\n5. Knead the dough until a smooth, elastic ball is formed (this could take about 12 min, as spinach inhibits gluten development).\n6. Rest the dough up to 24 hours (as long as possible, with a minimum of 1 hour. This rest time allows gluten to develop further, as you will see is necessary during the roll out stage)\n\nFor the filling:\n1. Strain 500mL of ricotta for 15 min\n2. Add 3 tbsp garlic chives, 1 cup Parm and salt and pepper to taste. Transfer filling to a piping bag \n\nGarnish:\n1. Roast about 100g of walnuts. Roast for 15 min at 300F. Allow to cool then chop such that there are a variety of sizes of pieces.\n2. Crispy sage: melt butter and allow the solids and liquid to separate and brown slightly, over medium heat. Add about 1 bunch of sage, picked, and allow to crisp. This will take about 30 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel and salt assertively.\n\nTo shape:\n1. Roll the dough out according to your pasta machine's adjustments, or until you can see your hand through it. This dough will be resistant and tear, but fold it over itself and persist in rolling and it wjll come together.\n2. Cut dough into squares (use a ruler) of about 7cm\n3. Pipe about a marble's size of filling\n4. Bring the edges of the dough from north to south and press down firmly. You'll now have a triangle.\n5. Seal the edges around the filling.\n6. Fold the corners of the dough (east and west) and bring the tips together around your index finger. Press down firmly and seal\n\nI highly recommend watching a few videos for the shaping, but practice is equally important.\n\nTo serve:\n1. Bring a pot of heavily salted water to a boil\n2. Boil balanzoni for 4 min\n3. Finish the balanzoni in a pan with the butter you used for crisping sage earlier\n4. Plate and garnish with walnuts, sage and a little cheese or lemon zest if you like\n\nA little trivia: Balanzoni is from Bologna, and is named after a carnival mascot from there called Dr Balanzone, whose hat it represents", "[deleted]"]}

I don't know how popular this thing is in your area, but semolina pudding was a very popular desert for kids in my country many years ago. I still make myself from time to time because I just love it. It is super easy to customize with fresh fruits, jams, fruit sauce, cinnamon, peanut butter, caramel...and so on. You can eat it warm, cold, have a thicker texture or a smoother one, fried like this...is just a really great dessert.\n\n  \nAnyway recipe right?   \nFor the pudding :  \n\\- 220gr semolina  \n\\- 1L milk 3,5%fat (The fat percentage will only make the pudding to feel more \"rich\")  \n\\- 5gr vanilla extract  \n\\- 5ml almond extract (Be careful this is strong, you can avoid it)  \n\\- 65gr sugar  \nCoating  \n\\- Breadcrumbs, 2eggs, cornstarch or flour  \nFor the Sauce  \n\\- 350gr Strawberries   \n\\- 150gr sugar  \n\\- Squeeze of lemon  \nExtra  \n\\- Some fresh strawberries to eat this with  \nSo you need a pan, with a thicker bottom. Add the milk, vanilla, almond extract, sugar and semolina. Put it on medium heat and mix it well. You can use a wooden spoon or a whisk, it is up to you. I use a spoon because is easier to wash after. You will have to mix this to not stick to the bottom. I don't have an exact time of this to cook. The thing is, it will thicken and it will be harder and harder to mix. At the point where it sticks to the spoon it should be ready. But as I said it before you can eat it in many ways. But for fried pudding we need to have a thick texture. So when it starts to get thicker, put the heat on low and continue to mix 1 more minute. Transfer it to a pan that you spread some butter to it, so it would be easier to unstuck the pudding later.\n\n  \nWhen this thing gets cold it will harden enough. It doesn't matter the thickness when you poor it in the pan, you only need to cook the coating later. It is really up to you. Make it cubes and serve it for a small party, make it squares, sticks...whatever you feel. It is best to let it rest till the next day. Let it sit overnight in the fridge. Then cut it in the forms you want, and let them in the freezer 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile prepare your coating, Cornstarch > Eggs > Breadcrumbs. I use cornstarch because it sticks way better than flour in my opinion. Deep fry them in hot oil until you get the nice golden-golden brown color on them. You don't have to worry about cooking anything else but the coating.\n\n  \nPut them on a kitchen towel or something to drain the excess oil from them, and enjoy them warm or cold. I prefer them a little warm. Of course, now it gets to the customization part which is up to you.  \nI made a strawberry sauce for them. Put the strawberries in a pan with the sugar, and a squeeze of lemon (It really doesn't matter how little you put). I never measure that, I just cut like 25% of a lemon and squeeze that in. You can squeeze less or more. Have all this on low-medium heat and give them a small mix from time to time. When the strawberries get mushy, transfer them to a blender and make the sauce. Don't use it hot, let it cool down a little. \n\n  \nYou can avoid the sauce and use a jam. You can skip all these and use just fruits, peanut butter or other sweet dipping sauces. It is up to you, go and explore!  \nI hope you gonna enjoy this!", "Never even thought this was possible. Saved.", "This looks tasty!

After the cake its done, let it cool down to room temp. \n\nCaramel Ingredients: \n \n - 400gr Sugar\n - 100ml Water\n - 240ml Heavy Cream 20% fat\n - 120gr butter 80% fat\n\nAfter that, let's make the caramel.\nSugar+water in a sauce pan and put it on a medium heat. Let it cook there and don't touch it till it gets the color you want.\nMeanwhile get your heavy cream and put it on low heat to warm it up. The butter should also be at room temperature and not cold.\nWhen the sugar gets to that caramel color, put the heat on lowest possible, and add your warm heavy cream. \nMix with a wooden spoon, and remove it from the heat as soon as possible. Now its time to add your butter\nand mix till it melts. You should have the butter in smaller cubes so it melts faster. If any of these ingredients are cold you will give the caramel a temperature shock and risk crystallization.\n\nNow poke your cake using the back of a spatula, a straw or the back of a small honey spoon. I used the back of a small honey spoon.\nThis is more about preference. Have as many holes in there as you want. Add a thin layer of that warm caramel and fill the holes.\nPut it in the fridge for around 2 hours.\n\nMousse Ingredients:\n \n - 250ml coconut milk\n - 350ml whipping cream\n - 9gr gelatine\n - 30ml water\n - vanilla extract\n\nAfter those 2 hours, its time to make the mousse. Before removing it from the fridge, take a bowl, sweetened whipping cream and the rest of the coconut cream/milk.\nHave the coconut cream on low heat to warm it up. It should be warm but not hot to burn your finger.\nWhile that gets hot, take a glass with around 30ml of cold water and add your gelatin to it. Then place the glass into a bowl with boiling water. This will help that gelatin to melt.\nUse a hand mixer to mix the whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Add your gelatin to the coconut cream after removing it from the heat and mix.\nAdd a little whipping cream in there too and give it another mix. This will help to cool down the mixture even more and it will make it easier to incorporate.\nAdd the coconut cream mixture over the whipping cream and fold using a spatula. \n\nThat's the mousse. Add it over the cold cake. BUT after you remove the cake from the fridge, some of the holes \nmay be \"empty\" since the cake will absorb some of the caramel. Don't worry, add more caramel into the holes and THEN add your coconut mousse. That mouse really needs to set.\n\nI had on the cake some toasted coconut flakes, coconut chips and more caramel. \n\nSome TIPS:\n\nNow I know some people don't like gelatin. You can use agar-agar but I didn't so I don't know the amounts.\nYou can't make this mousse without because its too runny and it won't set. \nIt really needs to sit in the fridge as long as possible. 12hours will be the best, you could let it sit just around 6 hours, but do it at your own risk.\nJust don't use heavy cream or butter that its not warm or room temp in the caramel. You will most likely ruin it.\nWooden spoon also helps in there because the metal spoon or spatula are usually more cold.\nMake sure the sweetened whipping cream its not oversweet. The base cake its already sweet enough, the caramel its as sweet as it gets, and you don't want another super sweet mousse on top.\n\nNow I really hope you gonna enjoy this cake!"]}

Add the flour, yeast, baking powder, and sugar to a large mixing bowl\r\n2. Add the corn starch and 6 Tbsp of the water (90ml) to a smaller bowl, mix it around to evenly incorporate the starch and make a slurry\r\n3. Microwave the slurry in increments of 20 seconds, stirring it in between each increment, until it becomes a thick paste then set aside to cool for a bit\r\n4. Heat water to as hot as you can handle it with your hands, and add to the larger mixing bowl along with the starch paste\r\n5. Mix and knead the dough till it becomes smooth and no dry spots remain\r\n6. Cover and let rise in a warm area till it doubles in size\r\n7. While it\u2019s rising, slice the scallions into thin rounds, then set aside for later\r\n8. Once the dough has risen, press it down with the pads of your fingertips. Lightly flour a work surface and take the dough out of the bowl and turn it out onto the floured surface\r\n9. Begin to roll it out into a rectangle\r\n10. Drizzle sesame oil onto the rectangle and spread it all over the surface of the dough\r\n11. Sprinkle the sliced scallions on the dough\u2019s surface\r\n12. Take one edge of the dough and roll it towards the opposite end\r\n13. Slice the rolled up dough into rounds\r\n14. Take one round and stack it on top of another one\r\n15. Use a chopstick and press down the center line, lengthwise, of the rounds. This should expose the rolled up scallions and have them point towards the ceiling\r\n16. Put aside the chopstick and grab the 2 ends of the dough rounds, pulling them apart with gentle pressure\r\n17. While pinching the ends with your hands, twist the dough rounds, then take the two ends and join them together.\r\n18. Let the dough rest/proof in a warm area till it increases in size by 50%\r\n19. While it\u2019s resting/proofing, get the steamer ready. Make sure the surface on which the buns will steam is non-stick, covered with oiled parchment, or has napa cabbage leaves on it to ensure the buns don\u2019t stick when you try to take them out at the end.\r\n20. Once the dough has risen by 50%, and the water in the steamer is boiling, put the buns into the steamer and cook for 8 - 10 mins.\r\n21. Take them out and enjoy!\r  \n\r\n\nThese are a staple in many Chinese households. Akin to bread in the West. Let me know if you made it too!

Firstly, soak 1.5 cups of chickpeas with enough water for overnight.\r  \n2. Next day, drain off the water and transfer to a bowl or food processor.\r  \n3. Add all ingredients listed above.\r  \n4. Bend coarsely in a food processor without adding any water.\r  \n5. For bst results refrigerate for 1-2 hours/overnight. Cooking without resting works well and tastes good too!\r  \n6. Now wet your hands and prepare small sized balls. If the dough is sticking to hands then add a tbsp more of maida and mix well.\r  \n7. Deep fry the balls in hot oil.\r  \n8. Stir occasionally, keeping the flame on medium.\r  \n9. Once the falafel turns golden brown, drain off on to the kitchen paper.\r  \nFinally, serve falafel hot with hummus or sauce of your choice.\r  \n\r  \nTroubleshooting: If your falafel is too hard/too crunchy on the outside, there are two possible reasons-- 1) you didn't process the mixture enough-- return the chickpea mixture to the processor to make it more paste-like. 2) the chickpeas you used were old, or they didn't soak long enough. Try buying a fresher batch of dried chickpeas next time and make sure you soak them until they're doubled in size and slightly tender.\r  \n\r  \nNote: Some people like to add baking powder to the mix to lighten up the texture inside of the falafel balls. I don\u2019t usually add it, since the falafel is generally pretty fluffy on its own. If you would like to add it, stir 1 tsp of baking powder into the falafel mixture after it has been refrigerated.", "These look amazing!

Is there anyone who doesn't love garlic bread? Seriously! There are many ways to make your garlic bread, and I'm here to share my \"fancy\" garlic bread recipe. We're not gonna make bread from scratch for this, but you can totally do it if you want.\n\nThere are really simple ways to make garlic bread. Put the bread in the oven or in a hot pan to get some crisp and rub a garlic on it.\n\nOr just mix room temp butter + chopped garlic + parsley or other herbs and put it on a bread, put it in the oven to crisp and boom you have it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what about something fancier ?\n\nFor ingredients you gonna need enough butter to cover the garlic while cooking. Then onion powder, black pepper, dried basil, dried tomatoes. Bacon or smoked salty ham. This really depends on how much you wanna make. For 200grams of butter I used like 1 teaspoon for condiments.  \n\nGet some bacon or a smoked salty ham and cook it in the oven until crisp. We gonna use it as topping after the garlic bread is done.\n\nTake A LOT of butter and melt it on low flame. When it melts, add your garlic and let it on low flame until the garlic gets really, really soft. When that's done, remove the garlic from the butter, but don't discard the butter. You gonna need it a little later. Use a knife to smash the garlic, it should be very easy, chop it and press it to form a paste.\n\nTake some dried tomatoes. This is not the type that's crunchy. They're a little soft. I'm sure you can use the kind that's stored in oil. Anyway, take like 1 or 2 dried tomatoes, depending on how much garlic you gonna use. The dried tomatoes should be like a third of the garlic quantity. Chop it in very small pieces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, after that melted butter got to room temp, add like a table spoon of olive oil, put the garlic in, some onion powder, black pepper, dried basil, and the dried tomatoes. Mix it, and you should get a more paste like consistency. If you don't, let it cool a little more. Now spread this on your bread and cook it at 180 degree Celsius until crisp.\n\nYou can also use some shredded cheese on top of your choice. I had tried one with a mix of pecorino and a nice cheddar, but I didn't like it as much, because the cheese take a lot of space when it come to taste. When is done, get some of that crispy ham and smash it in little pieces to make a topping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sweetness of the dried tomatoes, with the saltiness of the ham, with the garlic taste and all those spices combined works REALLY really well. At least I like it, this is by far my favorite garlic bread recipe. \n\nI love this kind of garlic bread because is so versatile and you can never have too many recipes.", "It sounds delicious!  There\u2019s a cooking subreddit called something like 52 weeks that features a different technique or cuisine or ingredient each week.  Last week was confits. Your recipe is like a confit of garlic.  You could put the tomatoes right in with the garlic to stew in the butter.  Topping off with bacon, genius!", "Where is the line between bread and pizza?"]}

I know I do, especially combined with a tzatziki sauce.\n\nSo recipe right ? \n\nFor the fritters I used : 900gr zucchini, 65gr onion, 4 cloves of garlic, 60gr carrot, 80gr feta cheese or your choice of cow/sheep cheese, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, 150gr flour.\n\nFor Tzatziki I used : 8 cloves of garlic (You can use less of course), 165gr cucumber, some dill added to your taste, 300gr greek yogurt (0/2%fat), salt and pepper, juice from half of lemon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're making the tzatziki first, because it needs to sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour, so all those flavors can get to know each other better. Take the cucumber, cut it in half and remove the seeds. Optional you can remove the skin or at least a part of it. Use the big holes from a grater.\n\nSmash the garlic with the garlic smasher (or whatever it is called), chop some fresh dill (you can use dried), and add the rest of the ingredients. Mix them together, cover it and let it sit until you finish the fritters now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaking fritters, use the big holes of your grater again, and grate your zucchini. Put it in a strainer over a bowl and add salt to it. Let it 5-10 minutes to eliminate as much water as it can, and then use your hands and squish it, to remove even more water. Remove as much as you can. Of course you will end up with way less than 900grams now, but I measure it only when I started with the full zucchini. I think you can use a cheese cloth to remove even more water.\n\nThe less water it will have, the more crisp will be. I used a light-green zucchini, and if I'm correct, it has more water than the dark green zucchini. But I'm not totally sure. Anyway, until you wait for the zucchini to eliminate water, chop your onion as small or big as you want, use the garlic smasher for the garlic, grate your carrots on the big holes of the grater, and mix the cheese and the condiments with all of that. Add your zucchini, 2 eggs and mix everything together, and add the flour. Now you may not necessary need 150gr flour. Maybe you can use 100gr instead. It really depends on how much water is left in that zucchini, or how big are those eggs and so on. Start by adding 100grams and see if the composition stick together. You can even fry a little piece to be sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPut some oil in a hot pan, you can either cover the entire pan in oil, or have a few drops using a good non-stick pan. And fry them until golden brown on each side. You should flip them only once. Take care and make them as thin as you can. If you make them to thick, it won't cook enough in the middle. You can put a full spoon in your pan, and then press on it to form a circle or something and thin the composition in there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCool them on a cooling rack and it should remain more crispy than soggy. But again, the crispiness of these, really depends on how wet the whole composition is at the end. There's nothing wrong if yours are not crispy. Half of my batch was not crispy. Those who were really thin got more crisp surface. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I hope you gonna enjoy them with the tzatziki sauce and have a good day!", "Kolokithokeftedes! These are great!

Nice hallie, 27lbs, no worms. Had it vac-packed and flash frozen. The beans my wife and I grew in our new garden in the front yard. The chanterelles we collected last weekend on a camping trip\n\nHere's my how-to:\n\n**Pan-seared Halibut**\n\nIn a blazing hot pan dribble a some olive oil and let it heat up for a few seconds. Lay the fish in presentation side down and let sear on high for 60 seconds. There should be lots of sizzling and spattering--the oil should be pretty close to it's smoke point. Then into a pre-heated 400F oven it goes for just 3-5 minutes. When done, pull out the pan and drop a big knob of butter and a spritz of lemon juice in the pan, swirl it around, flip the fish and swirl it around some more to get good coverage. Season with salt and white pepper and serve with the remainder of the lemon butter dribbled on top.\n\n**Bacon Fried Beans**\n\nIn a med-hot pan fry a couple of strips of chopped bacon with a little oil to start them off. When the bacon is crispy (like 5 min) stir in half a pound of french beans and cover. Stir occasionally for another 5 minutes or so. Season with salt, pepper, a 1/4cup of apple cider vinegar and a tiny sprinkle of sugar. Delicious!\n\n**Sauteed Chanterelles**\n\nIn a blazing hot and totally dry pan, throw in your sliced chaterelles.\n\nTip: Chanterelles are a notoriously \"wet\" mushroom, and need to have some the water cooked out before sauteing--otherwise they get mushy and slimy.\n\nStir the chanterelles so they don't burn, until most of the water has evaporated away. Turn down the heat to medium, add a knob of butter, a bit of crushed garlic, some fresh thyme and your salt and pepper. Saute for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the chanterelles take on a nice tender texture. \n\nI made this the other night for my wife and me. With a few minutes of prep to set up my mise en place and three pans and a pre-heated oven on the go, the total time from start to finish was under 15 minutes.", "The browning on that halibut is absolutely gorgeous.", "This looks great - starting a garden to be ready in the spring, hope I can get some dinners like this ", "But did you raise the pig and cure the bacon yourself, slacker??\n\nLooks fine and tasty though. so, what kind of worms are you talking about on the halibut?\n\n*the slacker comment is absolutely a joke..."]}
{"title": "Why you shouldn't Crowd your Pan, and How to Always Get Golden Brown Food", "selftext": "Hi r/fromscratch. Here's a culinary quick tip write up on how to get that golden brown (Maillard Reactions) deliciousness on your food. Super helpful for any cut of meat, especially more economical ones like chicken thighs, beef round, pork loin chops, etc. Also made a vid to show what I'm talking about.\n\n[Take a look here if interested.](https://youtu.be/6tfvAVP480w)\n\nThe whole reason we want Maillard Reactions/Browning is because of the crust/crispy like texture it provides and because it\u2019s a series of Reactions that we find more flavorful than plain grey meat. It DOES NOT lock in the juices, that is a myth. You can get a perfect golden brown sear on any meat then let it sit for a bit. After 5 minutes the surface of it will be wet from the juices inside of it. Therefore we aren\u2019t sealing in anything. It\u2019s the texture and flavor compounds that we want.\n\nIn order to get that golden brown crust on any food, it needs to reach a certain temperature. Upwards of 310F/154C. If you crowd the pan with food, then the moisture released will be much greater from that increased amount of food. This causes water to pool in the pan because it cannot evaporate out fast enough. Water in liquid form cannot get above 212F/100C, which is far below the temperature we need for the Maillard Reaction (good browning). So instead of searing, we end up boiling/steaming the meat and while it does cook this way, it will not get that Maillard Reaction browning we\u2019re aiming for.\n\nIn a non crowded pan, the water can evaporate because there\u2019s less of it and thus we can get to those high temperatures we need to good Maillard Browning. Below is a side by side comparison, non crowded on the left and crowded on the right. Notice the difference in color between the two. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifbo3afd2b371.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5dc624d68fa1a87d10db07904095134a27152d8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/nse5dl/why_you_shouldnt_crowd_your_pan_and_how_to_always/", "created_utc": 1622837103.0, "score": 143, "author": "bakedbeans18", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/nse5dl/why_you_shouldnt_crowd_your_pan_and_how_to_always/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This was a great video and explanation.", "Can you explain why sometimes the first side down will get nice and crispy, but when I flip it the second side doesn\u2019t sear the same?", "Good video!", "Great video/write-up! \n\nI've found that the best way to get browning for chicken thighs is to very lightly cover the chicken breast in flour. It's feels a little cheaty but the results are always super pretty and tasty! \n\nHere's an example of my results with this method (along with everything you said in your post :) ).

And of course some butter to cook our things in it.\nThere's not really a measurement for these, you just add how much you want of each, but I used 4 eggs for 2 sandwiches.\n\n 1. Prep the veggies by cutting the spring onion as small as you can. For the carrot, you want medium-long thin stripes and same for the cabbage.\n 2. Mix the eggs, add your veggies to them and mix again to coat everything in egg. \n 3. Season it with salt and pepper and cook it as you'd cook your omelette in a little butter. The veggies don't need to cook, so when the eggs are ready to eat, you're done.\n 4. Toast your bread slices in a little butter until nice and crisp on both sides.\n 5. To make your sandwich, you need to add ketchup + mayo on the bread, then your omelette. \n 6. At this point add your favorite ham in the pan to cook it a little. I use 2 slices of ham. When you flip it, is time to also add your slice of cheese.\n 7. You top your omelette with that ham and cheese and top it with another slice of bread that should also be coated with ketchup + mayo.\n\nThe original recipe has sugar in it before you add your ham...but the ketchup is sweet enough so I'm personally not gonna add any sugar in this.\n\nAnd that's it! It may sound weird, or not that delicious, but believe me, it is a great recipe for a sandwich!\nHope you gonna enjoy it!", "that's my tomorrow's breakfast"]}

Lightly grease your hot skillet/non-stick pan, coating the surface with a thin layer of oil.\r  \n4. On medium flame, pour the eggs into the skillet.\r  \n5.

You can also use any long grain or medium grain like Jasmine rice, Sona masoori.\r  \n2. Meanwhile pour about 10 cups of water for 3 cups of rice to a large pot and bring it to a rolling boil on a medium high flame. When the water begins to boil add the rice\r  \n3. Add 1 tablespoon salt to the boiling water. Add rice.\r  \n4. Keep checking so you don\u2019t overcook. This only takes a few minutes. Cook the rice and not mushy. Grains must be separated yet fully cooked.\r  \n5. Quickly drain the rice to a colander. Cool it until all of the steam vanishes. Fluff it up with a fork. If the rice is perfect you can cover and set aside. This prevents the rice from drying & becoming hard.\r  \n6. When completely cooled add \u00bd tablespoon of Vinegar to rice. Mix well. Leave in the fridge for 10 mins. This is optional. Doing so will give rice a good texture that best suits for Chinese fried rice\r  \n\r  \nStep 3: Fried Rice\r  \n1. Heat oil in a wok or pan on the highest flame. Add green onion bulbs, carrots & green peas.\r  \n2. Saute for 2-3 mins.\r  \n3. Add the cooked rice. Mix well.\r  \n4. To it add, soy sauce & vinegar.

In a saucepan melt the butter.\n2. Add all the flour at once and cook for about 3 minutes.\n3. With a whisk in hand, add all of the milk at once and stir quickly and constantly until the flour mixture is dissolved. (The milk MUST be cold. If the milk is warm, you will create lumps in the sauce.)\n4. With a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, continue to stir the mixture until it thickens. This should take 2 - 4 minutes over medium heat.\n5. Add all of your minced vegetable and stir to incorporate.\n6. Add in any mix-ins you would like to incorporate.\n7. If you plan to bake, remove from heat and pour into a prepared tart shell and bake for 40 minutes at 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F.\n8. If you plan to serve without baking, continue to cook on the stove top for 5-10 minutes stirring constantly to \"cook\" the vegetable to your liking.\n9. However you prepare it, it will thicken as it cools to room temperature.\n10. Serve at room temperature or cold.Note: As a failsafe, you can prepare a mixture of tablespoon corn/potato starch dissolved in 3 tablespoons water. If your sauce is too liquid by the end of cooking (at the end of step 6) begin to add this solution to the mixture and stir vigorously to quickly thicken the sauce."]}

Whisk them together and move on to another bowl. We gonna add in it, melted butter, sugar, milk, oil, Greek yogurt, eggs, vanilla extract, lemon juice and zest. Yea yea I know, lots of ingredients! Whisk them together.\n\nNow you want to add the wet ingredients over the dry ones. Fold them together and try to brake the lumps. You need to NOT overwork this, but as much as you just fold around you'll be ok. One thing you'll probably do, is to take the spatula and try to brake the lumps over the sides of the bowl which is ok. This mixture should give you 12 muffins, if you have a standard muffin form. Anyway, you either use cupcake papers or poor the mixture directly into the form. If you put the mixture into the muffin form, use some butter to spread around it so they won't stick.\n\nCut your frozen strawberries in small pieces, and throw them in a little flour before adding them to the batter. You have to do this at the very end. The flour helps so the fruits won't sink to the bottom. Anyway fold your fruits in (And of course you can use fresh ones), and fill the muffin form completely. \n\nYou need to cook this at 200\u00b0C for around 15-20 minutes. It really depends on your oven. You should take a look after 15 minutes and see if they got a nice color on top. If not let them cook for 5 minutes more. Again depending on your oven, you may use 205\u00b0C for 15 minutes or 20 minutes. The best advice I can give you, is cook only one and experiment, but keep in mind that when you'll put all of them in the oven, the time may increase with 3-5 minutes over the single one.\n\nThese will be a little moist in texture.

I like to put a bit of salt as well, although it's not necessary.\n\nTake the cold butter and cut it into small pieces and add to the flour. At this point I use my hands to coat the butter chunks in flour and break it up by hand. I do this mostly because I'm lazy with dishes so I just do this whole recipe mixing with my hands. I've seen folks lightly freeze the butter and then use a cheese grater to add it in, which seems clever. I just keep it simple, the goal is simply to end up with small (maybe pea-sized) bits of still solid butter.\n\nAdd the cold milk a little bit at a time, mixing until a wet shaggy dough forms. Once again, I use my hands, but a spoon is probably the preferred method. What we want is a texture similar to an extra-thick flapjack batter, but a big thicker. It will be a bit sticky so don't worry about that. This is a fast and loose recipe, so don't worry about perfection.\n\nOnce a loose dough/batter is formed, it's time to drop those biscuits. Lightly oil a baking sheet and grab chunks of the dough and drop 'em on there. I go with slightly larger than golf ball sized, but this recipe ain't about being precise. Don't worry too much about shape, these are supposed to be tasty, not necessarily pretty.\n\nBake until golden brown at about 425 degrees. Usually this will take about 12-15 minutes, but just keep an eye on them and pull them when they look nice.\n\nTry to contain your excitement and give them a minute before devouring. Give in, take a bite while they are still really hot, then do that funny breathing thing to keep them from scalding your tongue ;)", "Drop biscuits are the bomb. Such an easy treat to make!", "Just put some into the oven.  Thanks!", "Yum! What did you drizzle on top?"]}

Because I don\u2019t see very much liquid, so it seem like delicious beef noodles", "# Recipe\n\nI would like to start this off by talking about that time back then when something happened about that thing. It occurred to me that that thing happened because of these other things which made me feel as if it's necessary to mention here in this miniature recipe. You see, on that day, this thing which happened felt as if it was the thing that happened to... you know the thing. As a result, I felt nothing about the thing and yet something, which inspired me to make this bow of Beef Noodle soup.\n\nFor the soup, I think you're better off looking for online recipes. It's really just a rich beef broth with carrots, onions, star anise, ginger, salt, and a little bit of soy sauce. Can't remember off the top of my head what else was in it. Just boil, then simmer until the beef is extremely tender. Not to the point where it breaks apart but right before then.\n\nAs for the noodles, it's a 50% hydration dough (IE 200g flour, 4g salt, 100g water). Mix until shaggy, rest for 30-40 mins, then knead until you see the gluten window. At this point, you can either stretch it out and do \"bian-bian\" noodles (pulled noodles slammed against the table). Or what I did, which was roll them out, flour them, fold them, then cut them into individual strands.\n\nThe noodles should only require 4 mins (or less, depending on your noodle size) in boiling water to cook. It will have a 'qq' texture (chewy).\n\nPlace the noodles in a bowl, and add sliced green onions, cilantro, and chilly oil.", "I want some of that too! Looks great"]}

{"title": "I recreated a Banh Mi from my favorite Vietnamese bakery in Chicago.", "selftext": "Colonization is not tight, however in the case of Vietnam, a food-history-curious guy, such as myself, cannot overlook the cross-cultural delicacies French occupation brought to the country. Without the co-mingling of the Vietnamese and French people, we likely wouldn\u2019t have pho or banh mi. Crazy.\n\nThere's the delicate crunch and ultimate fluffiness from the Vietnamese baguette (much different than the French variety), a super flavorful main filling (in our case gorgeous Lemongrass chicken), crunchy aromatic vegetables and tangy, semi-sweet pickles AND NOT TO MENTION the rich, depth from a well-made pate.\n\nAll of the ingredients and technique are listed below. I also posted a how-to video if you prefer visuals. Let me know if you have any questions!\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Ingredients:\n\n500g Bread Flour\n\n5g Instant Yeast\n\n4g Sugar\n\n8g Kosher Salt\n\n345g Cold Water\n\n## Vietnamese Baguette Technique:\n\n1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the bread flour, instant yeast, sugar and salt until homogenized. Pour in the cold water and mix with the paddle attachment for 1 minute. Replace the paddle attachment with the dough hook and knead for 10-20 minutes, until the dough passes the stretch test.\n2. Remove the dough from the mixer, shape it into a ball. Plop the dough into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let it rest until doubled in size for 30 minutes to an hour.\n3. Grease your hands, then dump the dough out of the bowl onto a lightly greased work surface. Shape the dough into a large, 1 inch thick puck. Cut the dough like a pizza into 4 equal wedge-shaped triangular pieces like a pizza (280g each).\n4. Flatten the dough by hand, then roll from the top point down to the base of the triangle. Roll and press the dough down by the ends making sure to keep the middle fatter than the ends. Pinch the ends to seal, then continue rolling until smooth.\n5. Transfer the shaped baguettes to a baking tray lined with parchment, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes to an hour until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 500F, make sure it\u2019s preheated for at least 30 minutes before baking.\n6. Spray the baguettes with water, then make a long, deep slash running the length of the baguette. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. At the 12 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water, then close the oven. At the 9 minute mark, open the oven and spray the baguettes with water again, rotate the baking sheets, then close the oven. At the 6 minute mark, spray again, then finally with 3 minutes remaining spray a final time. You will have baked a total of 15 minutes, and sprayed the baguettes 5 times. Be liberal with the water.\n7. Remove the baguettes from the oven and let cool completely on the baking sheets. The resulting loaf should be light, crispy, moist and cottony on the inside.\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Ingredients:\n\n1/2 pound Chicken Liver\n\n1/2 Yellow Onion, sliced thin\n\n1 Garlic clove, peeled and smashed\n\n1 tsp Chinese 5-Spice Powder\n\n1/2 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n1/2 cup Water\n\n1 1/2 sticks Unsalted Butter, room temperature and cut into 1/2 inch cubes.\n\n2 tsp Shaoxing Cooking Wine\n\nGround Black Pepper TT\n\n## 5-Spice Chicken Pate Technique:\n\n1. Add the chicken livers, onion, garlic, salt and water to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until the chicken livers are barely pink on the inside, 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool with the cover on for 5-10 minutes.\n2. Strain the mixture and add the chicken livers, onion and garlic to a food processor. Process the ingredients until pureed. Add the wine, 5 spice and a few cracks of black pepper and pur\u00e9e until smooth again. With the machine running, add the tempered butter one cube at a time until emulsified into the liver mixture.\n3. Transfer to ramekins or a sealable container and refrigerate until solid. Serve chilled and spread on Vietnamese baguettes.\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickles Ingredients:\n\n1 1/2 cups White Vinegar\n\n1 cup water\n\n1 tsp Salt\n\n1/2 cup Sugar\n\n1 pound Carrot, Ribbons\n\n1 pound Diakon, julienned\n\n## Daikon and Carrot Pickle Technique:\n\n1. Add the vinegar and water to a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the sugar and salt until dissolved. Remove from heat and pour over the carrot and daikon. Store covered in the fridge for 1-2 weeks.\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Ingredients:\n\n1 pound Boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\n1 stalk lemongrass, peeled and chopped fine\n\n2 Garlic cloves, minced\n\n2 Tbsp Lime Juice\n\n2 Tbsp Fish sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n\n2 Tbsp Dark Brown Sugar\n\n## Lemongrass Chicken Technique:\n\n1. Combine all the ingredients in a bag and let marinate in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n2. Remove chicken from the bag, pat dry, shake off veg chunks and sear in a pan with some oil on both sides. Add a dash of the marinade to the pan, cover and cook on the stovetop until finished.\n3. Let cool slightly, chop up into pieces, set aside for sandwich.\n\n## To build the final sandwich:\n\n1. Hollow out baguette, spread thin pate on top of baguette, then pile in some lemongrass chicken.\n2. Top with cucumber, daikon and carrot pickles, jalapeno and cilantro. Close sandwich and munch as is or cut it in half.\n\n## Example Workflow:\n\n1. Make bread, let rest 30 minutes to an hour or until doubled in size.\n2. While the bread rises, make marinade and let chicken marinate for at least an hour. Make chicken liver pate, let chill and solidify in fridge. Cut all vegetables (cucumber, jals, carrots, daikon), make pickling liquid for quick pickles and submerge carrots and daikon.\n3. Shape baguettes, let rest another 30 minutes to an hour on tray, or until doubled in size. Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30 minutes.\n4. While the shaped bread proofs and the oven preheats, cook the marinated chicken, chop into pieces and set aside.\n5. Bake baguettes, remove from oven and let rest for 20 minutes before opening. Ready all other prepped ingredients to build the sandwich.\n6. Build sandwich. Remove chunk of insides of dough, add lemongrass chicken, cucumber, pickles, jals and cilantro. Spread pate on top, then close the sandwich. Optionally cut in half and MUNCH HARD.\n\n## Additional Notes:\n\n* The baguette recipe makes enough for 4 medium (or 2 large) baguettes.\n* As usual, I\u2019ve provided grams for the bread component of the sandwich for accuracy.\n* French Baguettes and Vietnamese baguettes are different.\n* Chinese 5-spice powder consists of star anise, fennel, Szechuan peppercorns, cinnamon and cloves. If you\u2019d like, you can make your own blend, but the mixture is widely available in many American grocery stores.\n* \u201cBread Improver\u201d is a chemical dough relaxant that allows bread to stay malleable without having to rest it as long or at all. I spoke with a few professional bakers who said that Bread Improver is not necessary and only helpful when baking on a commercial scale. I did a side by side comparison and I couldn\u2019t tell a difference in taste with or without the improver so\u2026 leave it out. There\u2019s no reason to worry about it here.\n\n**Watch the video here -** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ\\_oIh4AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwa7154wBo&lc=UgwgHp6qVjs9ANZ_oIh4AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "created_utc": 1646841276.0, "score": 103, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/taasuk/i_recreated_a_banh_mi_from_my_favorite_vietnamese/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["What\u2019s your favorite Vietnamese bakery in Chicago out of curiosity?

So first of all I'm not a huge fan of dark chocolate desserts. But I don't know, I really like this one, especially the \nway I make it since is more sweet, but you can adjust things to make it to your taste.\n\nIngredients: \n\n - 50gr flour\n - 70gr sugar\n - 85gr butter\n - 4 eggs\n - 170gr chocolate (Half milk half 50% dark) \n - Vanilla extract\n\nFor the middle ganache we gonna use \n\n - 135ml heavy cream\n - 105gr chocolate again a mix.\n\nSo you can adjust your chocolate to your tasting. Use only dark chocolate and use whatever percentage of it you want. As I said I'm not a fan of dark chocolate so I used milk + 50% dark. \n\nAnyway I start with the ganache. Put the heavy cream in a pan, and put it on medium heat. When it starts to bubble or gets hot enough remove it from heat, and add your chocolate in smaller pieces to it.\nLet it sit for 20-30 seconds then start to mix around with a spatula and it should melt easy. I hate doing bain-marie and I think this is way easier. Transfer it to a bowl and in the freezer it goes for at least 2 hours.\n\nNow to make the cake part of the lava cakes, chop the chocolate in smaller pieces. \nMelt the butter in a pan, remove it form heat and add that chocolate to it. Let it sit a few seconds and mix with spatula to help it melt and combine.\nIn another bowl, have 4 eggs and use a hand mixer to beat them until fluffy. Around 2-3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, sugar and mix again.\nNow when the melted chocolate is not hot anymore, add the eggs over it and fold until it combines. \n\nUse ramekins to make the lava cake. I tried using muffin pans but it doesn't work really well because those are too small.\nThis mixture should give you like 4 lava cakes. I use butter to spread on the ramekins and parchment paper on the base.\nYou have to use half of the mixture you have to pour into 4 ramekins, then take your ganache out of the freezer and form some balls. \nThese should go right into the middle. Then use the rest of the mixture to cover them. So be careful of how big or small are the balls you make.\nI personally just used a teaspoon of chocolate in the middle and it was just very cold but not near to be frozen. \n\nCook them at 190 degree Celsius for 15 minutes. Let them sit 1 minute before removing them from ramekins, and make sure these don't have any stuck edges.\nI served mine with some ice-cream and powdered sugar.\n\nYou can server yours with cocoa powder, chocolate, caramel, strawberry/raspberry sauce and so on. Make the best out of it and enjoy!\nDon't forget to add the chocolate you love. \n\nI prefer this lava cake over the one that you have to underbake. I think it is easier to make and fool proof.", "\"ITS FUCKING MOLTEN!!\""]}

Also is really easy to make. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients :\n\nCake\n\n \\- 200gr sugar and 15gr vanilla sugar\n\n \\- 125ml milk\n\n \\- 150-160gr butter\n\n \\- 6gr baking powder\n\n \\- 180gr dark chocolate\n\n \\- 50gr cocoa powder\n\n \\- 160gr flour\n\n \\- 5-10ml vanilla essence\n\n \\- 1tsp instant coffee\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGanache \n\n \\- 200gr white chocolate\n\n \\- 100ml heavy cream\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProcedure : \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake a bowl and add the sugar in it along with the butter that should be at room temp.\n\nAdd some vanilla essence, the cocoa powder and the instant coffee. Use a mixer to mix this until combined. Scrap the sides if needed.\n\nNow add 3 eggs and mix again until combined and scrap the sides if needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdd the flour along with baking powder and milk. Mix a little by hand if you don't want the flour to dust all over, and then use a mixer to combine everything. Guess what? Scrap the sides if needed.\n\nCut dark chocolate in chunks of different sizes (not to big), and mix it in with a spatula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy baking pan was a loaf pan 25 cm long and 8 cm wide at the bottom. Put a baking paper and add your mixture in. Cook it at 175 degree Celsius for 50 minutes to 1 hour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the ganache, totally depends on you. I Wanted to try and exercise with a pipping bag that I hate to use, so I had to prepare it while the cake was cooking to have it cold. So cut the chocolate as small as you can, and add hot heavy cream on top.\n\nLet it sit for 30 seconds - 1 minute and then mix with a spatula. You can store this in the fridge and then transfer it to the pipping bag once the cake is at room temperature to decorate, or my advice would be that after your cake gets at room temp, and still in the baking pan, make the ganache and put everything on top. You will get more chocolate on top than I had. I kept a little of that ganache to put it on top of slices when I eat it.\n\nYou can use a strawberry sauce on top too. It works well but it depends on you.\n\nAlso you can change the white chocolate for the ganache to dark or milk chocolate. Heck even chocolate with caramel in it would work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yea, this is it. I really love this recipe and I'm gonna use it more and more. I hope you gonna enjoy it!"]}

Add the flour, yeast, and salt to the bowl of your KitchenAid stand mixer. Make a well in the center and attach the dough hook. Turn to speed two and slowly stream in the warm milk mixture. The dough should form into a ball and start hitting against the sides of the bowl. Turn your\u00a0KitchenAid\u00a0to speed 4 and let it run for 8 minutes. Once finished, form the dough into a rounded ball with your hands. It should be quite easy to form. Place the dough back into your\u00a0KitchenAid\u00a0bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest on the counter for at least an hour.\n2. **BOIL WATER.**\u00a0In a\u00a0large pot, bring 8 cups of water and a half-cup of Arm & Hammer baking soda to a boil.\n3. **ROLL, CUT, AND SOAK THE DOUGH.**\u00a0Divide the dough into four equal parts and (with your hands) roll each into a long rope shape. Using a\u00a0dough scraper\u00a0or knife, cut the dough into bite-sized pieces. Drop your soft pretzel bites into the boiling water in batches, approximately 20 at a time, and swish them around periodically; I use a\u00a0fine mesh strainer\u00a0to swish and to remove them from the water (after about a minute of soaking them). Transfer the soft pretzel bites to a\u00a0cooling rack\u00a0to allow them to air-dry for a minute or so, then onto an oiled baking sheet (you can line the baking sheet with\u00a0parchment paper,\u00a0then spray with oil if you prefer). These steps help the pretzels release from the pan a bit easier, as they tend to stick because of the baking soda.\n4. **PREHEAT THE OVEN, THEN\u00a0BUTTER, SALT, AND BAKE THE PRETZELS.**\u00a0Set your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius).\u00a0Melt the remaining two tablespoons of butter in the microwave, brush each pretzel bite with butter, then sprinkle with coarse Kosher salt. Bake in the preheated oven for 8-12 minutes. The cooking time will depend on the size you cut your pretzels. Also, every oven is different!

Add your light brown sugar + Vanilla extract + oil and mix with a whisk until they incorporated with the eggs.\n 4. Grate your carrots with the help of grater. Use the smaller holes, you don't want big chunks of carrot.\n 5. Add the carrots over the egg mixture, and mix with the whisk a little more.\n 6. Chop the walnuts in small different sizes with the help of your knife. You don't want them to be powder and you want to feel them when you bite.\n 7. Add the wet ingredients over the dry ones + walnuts.\n 8. Fold using a spatula until you don't see white flour anymore.\n 9. Take a muffin form and spread some butter on it or use cooking spray. I think with the butter you get some nice crisp on the edges.\n 10. Fill the muffin form completely without pressing into them, and cook at 175\u00b0C for 30-35 minutes fan OFF.\n 11. Let them cool to room temp before removing them from the pan and enjoy!\n\nInstead of walnuts you can use almonds or pecan nuts. \nI personally like to eat these with some vanilla icecream with caramelized walnuts.

Browning butter is essentially just cooking the butter until the milk solids (the white foamy stuff) turn brown, which gives the butter an irresistible toasty, nutty aroma. This usually takes 12-14 minutes. It's usually pretty easy to tell when butter is browned, mostly because of its distinctive aroma. You'll want to keep the heat low, monitor carefully, and stir frequently to prevent it from burning . Have a spoon handy to scoop up the butter to test if it's done - there's usually a thin later of foam on the top that can make it a bit difficult to see the butter. For a nice picture guide, check out [this](https://www.bakefromscratch.com/how-to-make-browned-butter/#:~:text=In%20a%20medium%20saucepan%2C%20melt,for%20up%20to%201%20week).\n\nStir the browned butter into the flour mixture until crumbly. The butter will cool as you mix, which will help it crumble nicely.\n\n**Muffins**\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n1 cup cake flour\n\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n\n1/4 cup light brown sugar, tightly packed\n\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n\n1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce\n\n1/4 cup buttermilk\n\n2 eggs\n\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\n2 medium apples, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch chunks\n\nPreheat oven to 425^(o)\n\nPrepare your muffin tin. This recipe will make 6 jumbo muffins, or about 8-10 standard muffins. You can either grease each muffin well with butter or oil, or use paper liners. \n\nCombine flours, sugars, baking powder, salt and spices into a medium bowl and stir to combine. Add the cubed butter and toss with a fork. Using a pastry blender, stiff wire whisk, or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture. Ultimately, you want the crumbles of butter to be no larger than a pea. (You can also do this using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment.)\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the applesauce, buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract until combined. Dump the flour mixture into the wet ingredients and fold together with a spatula until just combined. You don't want to over-mix, so stop once there are no pockets of dry ingredients remaining. Add in the chopped apples and fold until evenly distributed.\n\nPour the batter into the muffin tin. Fill each well about 3/4 full. Be careful not to overfill - best case your muffins will look a bit messy, worst case you'll have a mess in your oven. (To be on the safe side, you can always but a baking sheet on the rack below to catch any drips.) Sprinkle a tablespoon or so of the crumble on top of the batter.\n\nPlace the muffin tin in the oven and bake for 5 minutes. **After five minutes, turn the temperature down to 350****^(o)** and continue baking for another 20 minutes or so, or until a toothpick inserted in the muffin comes out clean, with a few crumbs clinging to it. Jumbo muffins usually take about 25 minutes, while standard muffins take closer to 18-20. Starting off at a higher temperature really helps the muffins rise and get a lovely dome.\n\nRemove muffins from the oven and allow to cool before gently removing from the muffin tin. If you did not use liners, use a butter knife to gently loosen the muffins from the tin.\n\nThey're tastiest when warm (with a smidge of butter), but will hold for a day or to if stored in an airtight container.", "I'm totally making these once my oven is fixed!", "Wow, that is the sweetest crumble mix I think I've ever seen.

{"title": "The sour cherry pie that science made", "selftext": "I made a sour cherry pie on Monday, and it may be the finest pie I have ever made, in my 30 years or so of pie making. Omg, it turned out so well!\n\nThis is the pie that science made, for sure. Tapioca starch is the best thickener for fruit pies, especially acidic fruits. But there is a very specific ratio of starch + sugar + water from the fruit that is then cooked to a specific temperature in order to achieve gelatinization. The resulting fruit has the perfect set, your pie slices hold together exactly so, but when you bite into it, you just get fruit, perfectly cooked. No starchy flavor, no gummy texture, just fruit, seemingly magically held together. Thanks, science!\n\nIn order to achieve those temps, this pie is baked for about an hour and fifteen minutes at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C), which is quite a long time for pie. The pastry gets browned sometime around 45 minutes for the crust to an hour for the lattice. This is where pie shields or foil come in handy. You just cover the top strategically to prevent further browning.\n\nI also use science for the pastry. I used to use a classic French method that yielded incredible, flaky dough\u2026 sometimes. I got so frustrated with the inconsistency, I stopped making pastry altogether, for years. Then I came back to it as if I knew nothing, followed the science, tried several methods, and ultimately landed on adding alcohol to the pastry in order to inhibit gluten production. This makes for a flaky crust every time. And when made in a food processor and then rested in the fridge, the resulting dough is workable enough to be used for all kinds of sweet and savory pies, including weaving lattice crusts, etc, for hand pies, for blind baked pie shells (where this recipe really gets a chance to show off), it is a one size fits all dough, which is what I needed.\n\nFood is one of my special interests.

Just take a pound or two of unsalted butter in a heavy bottom pan and heat it on low heat for about 30-40 minutes until it stops foaming and the ghee runs clear and you can see the bottom. Stir every few minutes. That's it. And ghee or clarified butter is awesome.

I love the original, traditional recipe, but sometimes I change things around depending on what I wanna eat in terms of flavors.\n\nSadly I don't have an exact quantity for this recipe, you will mostly have to eyeball it no matter what. Don't worry, you don't need the exact quantity for it anyway and you'll see why.\n\nSo I like to eat this chicken parm on a bed of nice boiled and baked potatoes with some cheese.\n\nFor that we gonna need some potatoes that you cut in cubes and let it boil until you can put your fork trough them but not too easy. You don't want to make them puree, you want them to maintain their shape. Add them to a small pan, add shredded smoked cheese and heavy cream. Make sure you have a nice cheese layer at the top so it melts nice. I also added salt, pepper and paprika (you can add as much or little as you want) You cook it at 180 degree C for around 10-15 minutes, and then broil them for another 5 minutes or so to get that crisp on top. \n\nNow the chicken. I think everyone knows how to make a schnitzel right ? As spices I added: a little of dried onion, and then like a teaspoon of each paprika, onion powder, salt, black pepper, dill and smoked paprika. You rub the chicken with some of this mixture.\n\nThen you need flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. For the flour I added salt and black pepper.\n\nFor bread crumbs I added some of the mixture from the chicken but a little more smoked paprika and onion powder. Also some smoked cheese. Don't put too much in it because it will fry fast and you risk to burn it. Also it helps if you shredded really small.\n\nNow you get your chicken trough flour, egg and then breadcrumbs. I personally think this is the best way to coat a schnitzel. Fry it until it gets a nice golden - golden brown color. \n\nNow the tomato sauce, we gonna keep it simple.\n\nTake a pan, a tablespoon or 2 of olive oil, and like 30-50 grams of butter.\n\nAdd some onion (I used yellow + red onion) that's cut in cubes (I cut it in cubes because I want to feel it in the sauce when I bite into it) and cook it until translucent on low-medium heat. Now add your garlic and cook that for like 1 minute or so. Add the tomato sauce, oregano, black pepper, salt and some sugar to balance that acidity in the sauce. I usually add like 1 tablespoon of sugar for around 600ml of tomato sauce.\n\nYou need this to simmer for around 15-20 minutes depending on how thick you want it to be. I personally like the sauce to get thicker.\n\nNow take a baking pan, put the schnitzel in it, top it with the sauce, add mozzarella, a little mixture of smoky + pecorino cheese and broil it until that cheese on top gets crispy.\n\nYou can always add tomato sauce later when you it.\n\nTo serve it, I took lots of potatoes and put a schnitzel on top of it with a little more oregano. \n\nI personally love this recipe, because of the smoky flavors. As I said, this is not the traditional recipe, but I personally really like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yea, I hope you gonna give it a try if you like how it sounds!"]}

{"title": "I analysed the recipes for Five Spice Powder, and this is what I found [x-post from /r/recipes]", "selftext": "*Was told you guys would enjoy this so I hope you do!*\n\nFive Spice Powder is as famous a foreign ingredient can get, while remaining a complete mystery. Most people know what it is, but if you ask them the ingredients, you\u2019ll be greeted with many blank stares, or incomplete answers. The reason is simple, there is no fixed recipe.\n\nIn a way, Five Spice is a lot like what Curry Powder is for Indians. Ask any Indian household what curry powder is, and you\u2019ll be quickly told that there are many kinds of different curry powders to suit individual curries. Recipes also vary from house to house, city to city, and state to state! In this regard, Five Spice is very similar. Recipes vary from household to household and province to province. **In some special cases, such as in Sichuan Province, entire ingredients are different** (they prefer to substitute Fennel Seeds / Ginger for Sichuan Peppercorns)!\n\nBut what goes of the household brands that sell the blend in supermarkets? How do they cater to the masses? Upon even just the most basic investigation, we find that there is no consensus at all. Not only do recipes vary tremendously, but **often the most unexpected ingredients such as Cardamom and even cornflour (!) make an appearance**, most likely to save on cost. We also noticed that certain staple ingredients such as Cloves are normally missing, due to their high price. These tend to be substituted with ordinary cumin seeds, pepper, liquorice or other odd items. To add to the curiousness, many supermarkets in our local market of Hong Kong, didn\u2019t sell the blend at all!\n\n(See link below for photos of labels from existing products)\n\nMy next goal was to reproduce the ideal recipe, assuming cost was no issue. Although some sources on the web pointed towards True Cinnamon being used for Five Spice, this we quickly dismissed \u2013 China hasn\u2019t consumed True Cinnamon in large quantities ever, as they much prefer to their local flavour of the spice, Cassia. We quickly found that Star Anise, Cassia, Fennel Seeds and Cloves were essential ingredients for all Five Spice blends, regardless of where you were in China. The last ingredient varies by province to province.\n\nIn the Southern parts of China, Ginger root and Mandarin Orange Peel are often preferred, probably due to the fact that this is where they originate from. Other parts of China use Sichuan Peppers, Chinese Black Cardamom, and even Galangal. But we were on the journey for the most preferred taste. After countless taste tests, and more research, we landed on our target: Chinese Ginger Roots. The reason turned out to be much simpler than expected: **Ginger is one of the most popular ingredients in Chinese cooking, and also contributes a key flavour to the blend, not found in the other ingredients. Citrus.** Ginger is also extremely popular in other regions where Five Spice is used: Vietnam, Indonesia, and other Asian countries all make heavy use of Ginger in regular cooking.\n\n\n**The final recipe**\n\n- Star Anise (1 star)\n- Cassia (1-2 grams)\n- Cloves (1-2 grams)\n- Fennel Seeds (1-2 grams)\n- Ginger (1-2 grams)\n\nInstructions: Grind them all together. Use around 0.5g per dish.\n\nI know it varies, but these proportions mimic the Five Spice philosophy perfectly: personalise it!\n\n[Link to blog for photos of other ingredients labels, one even openly admitted it mixed in flour.](http://regencyspices.hk/spicetrade/2014/08/05/five-spice-powder-whats-real-recipe/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "created_utc": 1407254518.0, "score": 73, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/2cp5ko/i_analysed_the_recipes_for_five_spice_powder_and/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Really interesting post.

Cheers! \n\nGnocchi al burro e parmigiano \n\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n2 pounds russet potatoes (or other baking potato), washed\n\n1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more as needed\n\n1 teaspoon table salt, plus more for cooking liquid\n\n2 teaspoons pepper\n\n1/2 teaspoon nutmeg\n\n1 cup butter (two sticks), clarified\n\n1 small bunch basil\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nBake potatoes at 400 degrees for 45 minutes or until a toothpick slides easily through them.\nPeal and rice the hot potatoes onto a large work surface. Cool about 15 minutes.\nClarify butter and add 1/2 of basil. Let basil steep in warm butter until ready to assemble.  The longer, the better.\nSprinkle 1 1/4 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt over warm potatoes. Using your hands, work mixture into a soft dough. If dough is sticky, add more flour up to 1 1/2 cups total. \nBring 4 quarts of water to low boil in large pot. Salt the water.\nRoll a small portion of dough into a rope and make several test gnocchi. It\u2019s best to test to make sure the gnocchi are perfect. If mushy add flour. It\u2019s best to use this method repeatedly rather than rick messing up the batch with too much or too little flour. \nWhen satisfied roll about one-quarter of dough into a long 3/4-inch-thick rope. If rope won\u2019t hold together, return it to bowl with remaining dough and work in more flour as needed.\nCut rope of dough into 3/4-inch lengths. Holding gnocchi paddle or fork in one hand, roll each piece of dough with your finger. \nContinue with the rest of the dough.\nAdd about one-third of the gnocchi and cook until they float, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Retrieve gnocchi with slotted spoon and transfer to warm, shallow dish. Repeat with remaining gnocchi in thirds.\nPour butter over gnocchi and top with thick layer of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Chiffonade the remaining basil and sprinkle over the top.  Put under a 500 degree broiler until cheese is crispy and brown.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "The baked gnocchi in particular looks fantastic.

Although even regular cream will turn into awesome butter.\n\nI'm sure I've got more to tell, but I gotta run for now.", "is making Italian red sauce that bad? you just buy tomatoes, throw some herbs in, let it simmer for an hr. tastes way better than store bought and the cans of tomatoes are shelf stable. you can decide to start a pot at lunch and have it ready for dinner", "[deleted]", "There's a great book on this, it's called \"make the bread, buy the butter\"", "Pizza is on par with bread making. You can make a pizza sauce with a can of tomatoes, some olive oil, salt, and a blender.\n\nSoups are cheap, easy, and a million times better homemade (vs. jarred or canned). You can make enough for a week with like an hour of work.\n\nGranola is almost certainly worth making at home.\n\nNut butters (almond, peanut, mixed) are quick and easy, though buying in bulk is going to save you money here vs a natural store bought butter. You will need to add some (neutral or nut) oil if you want it extra creamy.\n\nBuy jams, chutneys, and apple sauces at the store unless you're growing fruits at home. This is more of a price thing than a difficulty thing. You need a lot of berries to make a jam. Same probably goes for juice. I think vinegars and oils probably fall into this category too as \"just not worth it\"- though vinegar is fairly low effort (just takes a long time)\n\nMinimally processed meats are usually going to be the cheapest and freshest. Whole chicken (or at least bone, skin on). Whole fish. Whole shrimp. Etc.\n\nAlmost any grain or starch will be easier, cheaper, better prepared at home. Potatoes are the ones that have the most weird boxed versions, but those preseasoned rice things are low-key a scam too.\n\nBeans fall in the middle for me. Soaking beans isn't hard or anything, but requires a level of planning I don't normally put into making beans. I'm pretty sure dry beans are cheaper than canned (especially in bulk), but a good sale may level it out a bit.\n\nDesserts are something we make at home both as a means of limiting how much we eat and because they tend to taste better. This holds for boxed mixed, premade, or refrigerator doughs- and also extends to any premixed batters like pancake, cornbread, banana bread, pudding (you need gelatin for jello, which most people don't stock, so the box here is fine unless you're going to be making frequently enough to warrant a gelatin investment)\n\nOatmeal packs, small yogurt cups with fruit added, bags of popcorn- anything that presents a smaller serving size under the guise of convenience is probably not worth getting.\n\nCrushed herbs/spices/garlic- worth it", "Generally, Pickles.

Sometimes we roast the veggies (peppers, onions, tomatoes, garlic) sometimes we don\u2019t. If we roast, we never peel. Just hucknit all in the blender with some oregano, cilantro, salt and pepper, and it makes a TON that tastes so much better than the store bought stuff. Worth it.", "Make:\n\n* Beans. Way less packaging waste to buy a 10lb bag of beans than individual cans, it's cheaper, and I usually plan my meals far enough in advance to remember to soak beans overnight. If I don't, [quick-soaking](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-cook-dried-beans) takes an hour.\n* Most baked goods (cookies, muffins, etc.). They taste a lot better and are more cost-effective, too. I also like to bake, which makes this an easy call personally.\n* Spice blends and dry rubs. I have a stocked spice cabinet, so any time a recipe calls for \"taco seasoning\" or \"shawarma seasoning\" or whatever, I usually already have what I need to make the blend. Also last time I looked the small packet of Old El Paso taco seasoning was $1+!\n* Pie crust/pizza dough/biscuits/cornbread/etc. Cheaper and better end result. Plus with pie crust I can use whatever pie dish I want (even the deep dish ones).\n* Frosting. This is more of a taste thing, I really don't like the taste of premade frosting, and it's at least break-even on cost even with higher butter prices lately.\n* Soup\n\nBuy:\n\n* Any type of dairy product. I've had people argue I should make my own paneer, mozzarella, ricotta, yogurt, etc. but I will buy it every time. The time/effort/cost isn't worth it IMO.\n* Pasta. I make homemade pasta once in a blue moon if I'm feeling fancy, but otherwise it comes from the box.\n* Jam. Neither labor- or cost-effective IMO. If I was otherwise drowning in amazing-quality fresh fruit that I didn't know what to do with maybe I'd get into it, but not where I live.\n* Condiments like ketchup/mustard/etc.\n* Tortillas\n* Crackers, corn chips\n* Broth and stock. I used to regularly make and freeze broth and stock, but the cost/time mostly isn't worth it for me these days, especially with meat prices lately, and particularly since I often use broth in pretty everyday meals where I wouldn't notice the difference. I regularly use Better than Bouillon or boxed stock.\n* Croissants, puff pastry, anything requiring laminated pastry: I love to bake, but I have my limits.\n\nBoth:\n\n* BBQ sauce. I usually make it if I'm making a big pot of pulled pork or something, but I'll buy it to use on BBQ chicken pizza or quick weeknight chicken breast.\n* Tomato sauce/marinara/pizza sauce. It's nice to have a jar around for convenience, but I make it most of the time.\n* Bread. I mostly buy sandwich bread, but I make breads to eat with soup fairly regularly. If I ate more sandwiches maybe I'd make bread more, but it takes me a while to get through a loaf (I freeze it).\n* Roasted whole chicken. I make one once in a while for a nice meal, but if I'm making it to use in other recipes, the cost savings aren't huge (in fact often the raw chickens are MORE expensive than roasted, which I can't understand \u2014 maybe they're slightly smaller?). Especially now that my supermarket has started selling rotisserie chickens in lower-waste packaging, I often buy one for convenience on weeks when I know I won't have as much time to cook.", "I do my own bread items, granola and coffee creamer!", "I haven't seen anybody else say Mac and Cheese. For cost and time effectiveness, it's definitely worth it to buy the box mac. Cheese is ridiculous in my area.\n\nTo make myself, I vote most variants of canned soups. Things like chicken noodle soup, sausage gumbo... Healthier and cheaper if you can make in bulk with a stock you got from bones. Quick to reheat when needed. \n\n(And personally, gumbo is super fun)", "I actually find baking bread more trouble than it's worth. Also, canned spaghetti sauce is cheaper than its ingredients, so we buy those.\n\nI make my own tartar sauce. I learned this from my MIL. It tastes better than the jars and I don't have to worry about the jar going bad. I take 2 parts sour cream, one part mayo, and add dill pickle relish, dill weed, and garlic powder to taste.\n\nFor snacks, we have been making Chex mix a lot lately. Cereal is still cheaper per ounce than potato chips around here, and it's healthier too.", "For us, baking bread has been better than store bought. It\u2019s fresh, tastes better, less sugar and preservatives. But it does take time, and if my spouse wasn\u2019t staying at home idk it would be worth it just due to time constraints. \n\nThat\u2019s basically how I look at most of our cooking tbh. If we both worked full time I\u2019d probably sacrifice the nutritional benefits of doing more ourselves in order to spend more time together and have a few more minutes to decompress."]}

{"title": "Ketchup made from the ground up... (not too sweet)", "selftext": "Ketchup and I have a complicated relationship. While other kids slathered their hotdogs, burgers and french fries with ketchup, I much preferred hot sauce or... just plain fried I guess. I viewed ketchup as a neon red sugar paste that has no place on anything one intends to put in their mouth. That is, until my early 20s when I tried some homemade ketchup from a local burger spot that blew my mind; it was tangy, salty, and umami with just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the whole deal. Never before did I know that ketchup could... not suck. Trust me, it might sound contrary, but I'm not a food elitist, I pretty much eat anything so forgive me when I say that most store-bought ketchup is... subpar.\n\nThe recipe and technique listed below is my attempt at recreating the homemade ketchup that turned me onto ketchup. I've decided to use San Marzano tomatoes because they're high quality, widely available all over the place, and always stay \"in season.\" If using fresh tomatoes, wait until summer or the ketchup isn't going to be too good. I've also included a video to those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck and let me know if you have any questions in the comments!\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 (28oz) cans San Marzano tomatoes, crushed\n* 1 cup Water\n* 1 cup White Vinegar\n* \u2154 cup Sugar\n* 2 tsp salt + more TT\n* 1 tsp MSG\n* 1 tsp Worcestershire\n* 1/2 tsp onion powder\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n* 1 tsp Fish Sauce + more TT\n\n**Tomato Ketchup Technique:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 300F.\n2. Pour tomatoes, water, sugar, salt, onion powder and garlic powder into the dutch oven. Break the tomato up with a wooden spoon.\n3. Place the dutch oven in the oven for 3-4 hours, or until reduced by about 2/3 and almost dry. Sometime at the 1.5 hour mark, stir the mixture making sure to push down any toasty tomato stuck to the sides of the pot.\n4. Add all the ingredients to a blender, and puree until a smooth mixture forms. Pass the puree through a fine mesh sieve to catch any seeds. Transfer to a sealable container and cool.\n5. Once cool, adjust seasoning and add fish sauce. Fish sauce is SALTY, if the finished ketchup needs more salt, keep in mind that the fish sauce will help with that. You should add enough that you get a certain umami from the fish sauce, but cannot fully taste or smell it - if you can taste it, you\u2019ve added too much.\n\n\\* *A Note about Xanthan Gum (XG):* Xanthan Gum is a hydrocolloid meaning that it thickens, strengthens and can sometimes smooth out purees and emulsions. I chose not to add it into the ketchup in this video because it seemed like an extra step. If using, puree the ketchup, pass it through a strainer, then reintroduce the ketchup to the blender and when pureeing add a bump of XG to the mix. Not too much, only 1/8th of a tablespoon or so will get you where you need to be.\n\n\\*\\* Wait until the ketchup is cooled before seasoning with salt. Cold food needs more salt, and if you season it while still hot, you could under season the ketchup. \n\n**Umami-LOADED Ketchup From Scratch** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9uInA3ZDQ&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "created_utc": 1625061802.0, "score": 66, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/oaxza3/ketchup_made_from_the_ground_up_not_too_sweet/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I appreciate ketchup, but when I have followed recipes for it: Martha Stewart and all kinds of others, I have never liked it better than Heinz.

One day, in a rush to get food on the table to feed her small family, the woman added too much oil to the pan before frying her pre-rolled burritos. The burritos were deep-fried instead of shallow fried leaving her a crispy, crunchy, fully fried end result that would later be coined the \"chimichanga.\"\n\nIt may be a legend, sure. I mean there's no real historical proof that the discovery of the dish went down that way. Regardless of fact, it's a fun story that describes an awesome treat-of-a-dish. I started doing some research into the definition of American food by creating a video series on YouTube called \"Cooking the States.\" As you might imagine (and probably already know) the Southwestern states are HUGELY influenced by our neighbors down south; Mexico and the American Southwest have intimate cultural ties and food is no exception.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for Chimichangas aka Deep Fried Burritos.

Cheers!\n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n* 3-4 pound Beef Chuck Roast\n* 3 dried Guajillo Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Ancho Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 2 dried Chipotle Chiles, seeded and torn into pieces\n* 4 Garlic Cloves\n* 4 cups Beef Stock\n* 1/2 cup Tomato Puree\n* 1 tsp ground Allspice\n* 1 tsp dried Oregano\n* 3 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar\n* 2 tsp Kosher Salt\n* 1 stick of Cinnamon\n* 3 Bay Leaves\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n* 680g All-purpose Flour\n* 100g Lard\n* 7g Kosher Salt\n* 360g Water, warm (about 90F)\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n* Flour Tortillas (from recipe)\n* Beef Barbacoa (from recipe)\n* 8 ounces Colby Cheese, cut into batons\n* 8 ounces Monterey Jack Cheese, cut into batons\n* Neutral Oil for frying\n\n**To serve...**\n\n* Romaine Lettuce, shredded\n* Black olives, sliced thin\n* Tomato, seeded and diced\n* Avocado, sliced thin\n* Mexican Crema\n* Lime Wedges\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**Beef Barbacoa**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 250F.\n2. Bring the stock up to a boil then turn off the heat, and pour the stock into a blender. Add the torn chiles and garlic then cover. Let the mixture steep for 15-20 minutes, or until the chiles have softened.\n3. Add the red wine vinegar, dried oregano, cinnamon, allspice and tomato puree. Blitz into a thin puree. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt or vinegar if need be.\n4. In a large dutch oven over high heat, sear the beef chuck until richly brown and caramelized then pour over the chili braising liquid from the blender. Add the cinnamon stick and bay leaves then braise the beef.\n5. If using a regular pot or dutch oven braise with the lid on, for 2-3 hours, or until you can easily shred the meat with a fork. If using a pressure cooker, cover the braise and place over a burner over high heat. Allow the braise to rise up to full pressure, then lower the heat to medium and hold the braise at high pressure for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cut the heat and carefully release the pressure with a wooden spoon.\n6. Remove the beef from the pot and let cool slightly. Take the beef out of the braising liquid and shred it with a fork then set it aside. Optionally do this step ahead and let the beef rest in the braising liquid overnight for more flavor, but make sure the beef is drained before folding burritos.\n\n**Flour Tortillas**\n\n1. In a large bowl, work the fat into the flour with your fingers until incorporated like pie dough. Make a well in the center of the bowl. Dissolve salt into the water then pour it into the well and work it into the flour by hand. Work the dough until it comes together, then dump it onto the counter and knead until smooth.\n2. Divide the dough into 6 portions, set them covered on a plate and let rest for 30 minutes.\n3. With flour as needed, roll out the little balls to 14 inches with a rolling pin. Heat a large, wide, ungreased pan or tray over medium heat and cook the tortillas for 20-30 seconds, flip and repeat on the other side. Don\u2019t overcook the tortillas or they\u2019ll become crispy.\n\n**For Final Chimichangas**\n\n1. Lay a flour tortilla on a clean work surface and spoon in some beef strained barbacoa followed by a piece of Colby and Monterey cheese, top with more beef. Wrap the burrito tightly into a flat rectangular shape similar to a pizza pocket, secure with wooden toothpicks, then set it on a baking sheet while you roll the remaining burritos.\n2. Bring the oil to 375F and fry the burritos, two-three at a time, until crisp and golden brown. Remove from the oil, let rest while you fry the remaining burritos and fry a second time for an extra crispy Chimichanga. Drain the finished burritos on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n3. Serve with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, black olives and a zigzag of fresh Mexican crema.

Focus on Thanksgiving recipes for now. Feedback welcome. Click** [**here**](http://app.parsnip.ai/) **to check it out!**\n\n[I'm a NYC chef who closed my restaurant due to Covid](https://ny.eater.com/2018/1/31/16939072/zai-lai-beef-noodle-soup-nyc-review). To keep myself busy, I've been re-writing Thanksgiving recipes for my friends and me in an easy-to-learn way. I've done this by focusing on cooking\u00a0*skills progression.*\n\nA little background: As I was training my staff, I discovered a recipe format that made learning and executing so much quicker. I simply focused on labeling the\u00a0*underlying technique*\u00a0behind each step. This anchor point helped my cooks quickly connect what they already knew to what they were doing. By focusing on techniques that are shared across many different recipes, practicing a particular recipe meant they were getting better at making related recipes.\n\nI found this practice of breaking kitchen skills into small discrete units helped cooks quickly grasp what I was asking of them and greatly expedited the learning curve. Cooks knew whether they were trained in a specific skill or not. And if not, they could get up to speed quickly.\n\nMy friends and I ([deepakChopra707](https://www.reddit.com/user/deepakChopra707/)\u00a0&\u00a0[mizzao](https://www.reddit.com/user/mizzao/)) have recently created a mobile web app that encompasses all these ideas. If you\u2019re cooking for Thanksgiving, feel free to try it out and let us know if its helpful. Keep in mind, these recipes were chosen for flavor not health (meaning there's plenty of butter). The app is designed to be used on mobile devices.

By now there should be a heavy coating of fond on the bottom of the pot.  Add oil if necessary, sweat garlic in the dutch oven, and add tomato paste until aromatic.  Deglaze the pan with the red wine, making sure to scrape up all the brown bits at the bottom of the pot.  While wine is coming to a boil, pour the cans of tomatoes into a large bowl, and crush with your hands or a potato masher, until consistency is chunky.  Add to the pot, and bring to a bare simmer.  At this point you can either simmer on stovetop for a minimum of 4 hours, or place in a 300-degree oven for a minimum of 6 hours with lid slightly ajar.

Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.  Once rested, divide into four equal portions, and roll out into a rectangle.  Roll through pasta machine, dusting with flour after each pass, until desired thickness is reached (\"3\" on my crank-style pasta roller).

Made some dumplings using a recipe my Grandma and Dad gave me for authentic dumplings made exactly like they do in China. It takes awhile, but it makes A TON of dumplings that easily serves 6 - 8 people. Or you can freeze them and reheat when needed. \n\n[Step by Step Instructions Here](https://youtu.be/knVNnD4SqOs)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Dough:\n   * 6 Cups of Flour\n   * 1 \u2154 Cup Lukewarm Water\n* Filling:\n   * 2 lbs Ground Pork\n   * 4 - 5 Napa Cabbage Leaves\n   * 1 Tbsp Minced Ginger\n   * 4 Spring Onions, Minced\n   * 1 Tbsp Salt\n   * \u2153 Cup Water\n   * \u00bc Cup Soy Sauce\n   * 1 tsp Sesame Oil\n\n**Directions:**\n\n* Dough\n\n1. Add the Flour and lukewarm water in a bowl.\n2. Knead it into a shaggy dough\n3. Turn it out onto a lightly floured counter and knead for 5 - 10 mins or until not sticking to you or the table. The motion is to PUSH the dough, then pull back. Not just press into the dough\n4. Set it aside, covered, while preparing the filling\n\n* Filling\n\n1. Chop up the Napa cabbage leaves into a fine mince, then set in a bowl and salt it. Let it sit while the prep the rest\n2. Mince up the ginger and green onions then set aside\n3. Add ground pork to a bowl and add the salt, water, and soy sauce in small additions while stirring in one direction (I chose clockwise) - this will develop a better protein matrix that stays juicier as it cooks. \n4. Add the ginger, scallions, and sesame oil and stir again\n5. Wring the cabbage out dry - it should release a shocking amount of water. Then add the cabbage to the pork and stir\n\n* Assembly\n\n1. Rip a chunk of dough off and lightly knead it into a flat disk\n2. Then poke a hole in the center and working your hands around the doughnut shape, stretch out the circumference of the dough\n3. Rip the dough at a point, then roll it into a log about the diameter of an adult thumb\n4. Cut or rip pieces off the dough log the size of half and adult thumb\n5. Roll those pieces into balls, then smash flat to make small disks\n6. Using a rolling pin, roll from the edge of the disk to the center then slightly rotate and repeat, making sure to leave the center thicker than the edges. This will allow more filling to be put in the dumpling. Repeat this till the disk is \\~3in/7.5cm\n7. Put a Tbsp of the filling in the center of the dough\n8. Press it down to remove air pockets\n9. Take the opposite ends of the dough and fold them together, Pinch em to form a seem.\n10. Using your thumb and base of your index finger, crimp/seal the edges to form the dumpling.\n11. Repeat steps 1 - 6, THEN steps 7 - 10 in batches. Doing all the dough at once will dry it out before you can fill all the disks\n\n* Cooking\n\n1. Bring a pot of water to a boil\n2. Stir it to form a current/whirlpool \n3. Drop the dumplings into the whirlpool\n4. Cover and lower the heat to medium\n5. Once the water starts boiling again, add some cool water and gently stir to form another whirlpool\n6. Cover the repeat step 5 two more times, or until the meat registers 165F\n7. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked dumplings from the pot and plate em up\n\nThat's it! Again, it does take some time and is best done with others. But this recipe makes a truly staggering amount of dumplings that last for multiple meals. \n\nI hope you make it and let me know how it goes!"]}

It should be a little warm, but not melted.\n\nAfter you put the sugar with the water on medium-high flame, don't touch it at all. I had mine on medium flame, and when it starts to get the color you want, just remove it from the flame. Add the heavy cream and mix. After that mixed, add your butter and mix until it melts.\n\nAnd that should be it. I'm not sure you can get the caramel done 100% of the time, but I found out that this procedure gives me the best results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Apples\n\n220/250gr apples, 25gr butter, 1tbls sugar, cinnamon to taste. Cook them in a pan at low-medium heat. After they get soft while cooking, mix them with some caramel in another bowl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Cheesecake\n\n600gr fresh cow's cheese(soft cow cheese), 100gr semolina, 200gr sugar, 2 eggs, Vanilla and Pistachio essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor this, you mix the eggs, then add the sugar, essences and mix them again. Add the cheese, mix, and then add 50 grams of semolina at the time.\n\nI'm not 100% sure that you can skip it, because this will retain some of that moisture and help the cheesecake maintain its shape, and will add a nice fluffy texture.\n\nAnyway, you get your cupcake forms, add the biscuits base as thicc as you want them to be, and top it off with cheesecake mixture.\n\nCook them at 180\u00b0C for around 20 minutes with fan off, and the last 10 minutes with fan on or put your temp to 190\u00b0C if you don't have the fan option in the last 10 minutes.\n\nThese minutes are what it took to me, depending on how much cheesecake you put in, or how moist or not is your composition, it can take less, or more.\n\nThe point is to watch them, and when they start to crack on top a little they're 90-95% done. I prefer them to crack on top when\n\nI use a topping like caramel, because those cracks will keep the caramel better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOff so much of a wall text. I'm not that good at formatting so much text. I hope this will help or inspire someone to make try these.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy cooking, and if you have any questions...I'm here :)"]}

It comes in chunkier small diced form, or my personal favorite Giardiniera relish. Giardiniera is magical on pizza, sandwiches, burgers and, of course, absolutely crucial for any respectable Italian Beef sandwich.\n\nGiardiniera is a lifestyle here in Chicago and it took me until I was 12 years old to realize that it a Chicago thing. I was out of town and walked up to a server at a pizza restaurant asking for some and she looked at me crooked like a confused pooch. I was sad. But you don't have to be sad because no matter where you reside, you can make it at home. It takes a few days, but it's pretty easy and once you make a batch you'll be good for weeks, probably even months - yes, it keeps for a long time.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe, the technique and a video to go along with it all.

Cut the veg into similar sized pieces. Fill just to cover with water. Record the weight of the water and veg, and add 8% kosher salt by weight. Set out a room temperature for one day.\n2. The next day, place a large bowl on a scale and zero it out. Drain the salty brine into the bowl, record the weight then discard the salty brine. To a medium sauce pan, add 50% of the weight of the liquid in water and the other 50% in white distilled vinegar. Add the spices and garlic to the pickling liquid, bring to a light boil and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3. Pour the pickling liquid over the veg, let cool to room temperature, and refrigerate. Let sit for 3 days before using.\n4. On day 3, strain the pickling liquid. Add the veg to a food processor and pulse to make a minced, \u201crelish-like\u201d, consistency.

I chose it from recipes found in [this gallery](http://imgur.com/gallery/MDAV7). \n\n[Link to recipe](http://www.browneyedbaker.com/2014/01/22/black-forest-cheesecake-recipe/)\n\nThis cheesecake tastes great, but my presentation was obviously not the best. Who knew you needed an electric mixer to make whipped frosting? The chocolate flavor is very rich, you could consider reducing the amount of chocolate used, though I myself will probably not. Making your own cherry topping is easy and vital. Possibly use more sugar than called for in the topping.\n\nThough the recipe didn't call for it, I baked it with the pan immersed in a boiling water bath. There was absolutely no cracking. I baked it for over one hour, which was probably too long, but the taste and texture was still excellent. \n\nBy the way, as a baker still new to cheesecakes, I want to share how I prepare my pan and remove the cheesecake, since this caused me nervousness when I was researching the process. The below method has been working perfectly for me:\n\n1. Separate your springform pan. (I use [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000237FSA/).) Spray the bottom and the side pieces generously with PAM cooking spray. Use your fingers to evenly coat the pieces and remove excess.\n2. Take a handful of flour and sprinkle on the base of the pan. Shake/tap the pan to ensure it is coated. Then turn upside-down and ensure that all excess flour is removed.\n3. Put the pieces of the pan back together. There is no need to flour the sides of the pan, only the base.\n4. Bake your cheesecake.\n5. After removing your cheesecake from the oven, let it cool on the stovetop. Once it's cool enough, place it **uncovered** in your refrigerator. Allow it to cool overnight. If you are worried about it absorbing any smells from the other food in your fridge, you may cover it after a few hours. You want to ensure that the cheesecake is entirely cold before covering so that there is no condensation buildup.\n6. No sooner than the next day, remove the cheesecake from the fridge. Now it's time to remove the cheesecake from the pan. You should be able to release the springform mechanism (very slowly and gently) and the sides will come away from the cheesecake without any sticking. I have found that trying to run a knife along the inside edges is both unnecessary and can be counterproductive.\n7. If your crust is made with butter, I now suggest covering a gas stove burner with some aluminum foil and placing the cheesecake pan on top. Turn the burner on the the **lowest** setting and allow the cheesecake to sit there over the low heat for a few (3-5) minutes. This will make the cheesecake easier to maneuver off of the pan and onto a plate. Run a thin spatula under the outside edge of the entire cheesecake. Then tilt over a plate and use the spatula to coax the cheesecake to slide off of the pan.\n8. If everything went well, enjoy your cheesecake!\n\n\n", "You missed a spot. "]}

{"title": "Cassoulet - A simple guide to a not-so-simple dish...", "selftext": "Cassoulet is a complex meat and bean stew from the Southwest of France. Some believe Cassoulet to date back to the dark ages and others claim its actually ancient. Traditionally, it's made by loading a \"cassoul\" or clay casserole dish with many types of pork and duck, then topped with beans and cooked using a technique that leaves the upper beans crisp and the insides soft and unctuous. \n\nI spent the past week planning and gathering ingredients to make the famed French \"Cassoulet\" entirely from scratch. I wanted to challenge myself and indeed was it a challenge, but a fun one at that.\n\nI broke down a duck to confit the legs, I made fresh Toulouse sausage by hand, I simmered the beans with homemade ham that I brined and smoked and of course sourced the \"Tarbais\" beans from a specialty food website. All in all, a ton of work and effort went into making this cassoulet and I'm super amped to be able to share my recipe with you. Below you will find the ingredients for each component and it's technique. I also made a video on how to make the Cassoulet and all of its components if you'd rather watch than read. I hope this one finds you well and that, even if you cut some corners to save time, you give it a go!\n\n***FULL CASSOULET INGREDIENTS\u2026***\n\n**For the Beans...**\n\n* 2.5 pounds White Beans (1kg)\n* 1 Yellow Onion (375g)\n* 1 Carrot (56g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Tomato Paste (28g)\n* 3 medium Tomatoes (528g)\n* 5 Garlic cloves (15g)\n* 6-8 cups Chicken Stock (plus 2-3 cups more for later)\n* 2/ 3 lb Pork Belly (300g)\n* 1/ 2 lb Ham\n* 3 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Duck Fat (45ml)\n* 3 tbsp Salt (35g)\n\n**For the Herb Sachet in the Beans...**\n\n* Small Bundle Fresh thyme (5g)\n* Small Bundle Fresh Parsley (9g)\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 1 tsp Black Peppercorn (3g)\n* 1 tsp Juniper Berries(2g)\n* 4 cloves (.5g)\n\n**Additional Meat for the final Cassoulet\u2026**\n\n* 4-5 Pork Spare Ribs (400g)\n* 3 six inch Toulouse Sausage Links(400g)\n* Bundle of Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 2 tbsp Duck Fat (30ml)\n\n**Duck Confit\u2026** \n\n* 4-6 Duck Legs\n* Duck Fat to submerge legs\n* Thyme (fresh, picked and pressed in)\n* Zest from half an Orange\n* 6 Garlic Cloves (1 per leg)\n* Salt (about a half teaspoon per leg)\n* Cracked Black Pepper TT\n\n**Toulouse Sausage\u2026 (recipe yields 5 lb or 15-20 links)**\n\n* 3.5 pounds Pork Shoulder (1.6 kg)\n* 1.5 pounds Fatback (680g)\n* 3/4 cup White Wine (175ml)\n* 1/4 cup Brandy (60ml)\n* 3 tablespoons Kosher salt (40g)\n* 3 tablespoons minced garlic (50g, 15-20 cloves)\n* 1 tablespoons ground black pepper 8g\n* 1 tablespoon ground white pepper 8g\n* 1 teaspoon Nutmeg, freshly grated (optional)\n* 10-12 feet Natural Hog Casings (32-38mm)\n\n\\*serve with additional red wine vinegar and a nice bottle of light red wine.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nToulouse Sausage...\n\n1. Cut up pork belly and back fat into small-medium pieces manageable for the grinder. Toss the meat in the pepper, garlic, nutmeg and salt and place in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. Begin soaking the hog casings in a small bowl of cold water, set aside.\n2. Grind the mixture through a \u201cchunky\u201d (8mm) die and onto a sheet tray.\n3. Once all the meat is ground, add it to the bowl of the stand mixer and, with the paddle attachment on, mix the meat on low for a minute. After a minute, add the wine and brandy, then increase the speed to medium and mix for a minute or two longer. The liquid should be completely incorporated and the meat should look sticky.\n4. Optionally, fry up a bit of the meat and taste test it for seasoning.\n5. Set up the sausage stuffer on the stand mixer and stuff the ground meat into the hog casings.\n6. Tie off one end of the hog casing. Use one hand to help the casing off of the nozzle, and the other to guide the sausage onto the sheet tray.\n7. After stuffing, if forming links, poke holes in the sausage coil to make sure it doesn\u2019t burst while twisting. To form links, twist the sausage every 6-7 inches. If serving to a crowd, you can also leave the whole sausage in a coil and cook the sausage as is.\n8. Cook the sausage to an internal temperature of 160F, serve however you damn well please. Son. \n\nDuck Confit\u2026\n\n1. The day before cooking, season the duck legs liberally with salt and press the aromatics into the legs. Cover the tray with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, or up to 3 days.\n2. The next day, remove the duck legs from the tray and rinse under cold running water. Do your best to remove all the salt and aromatics, then pat dry.\n3. Place the duck legs in a container taller than it is wide, submerge the legs in the duck fat, cook on 200F (93c) for 6 hours, or until their tender.\n   1. At first the legs will float, but as they cook and release water and air, they will sink to the bottom.\n   2. At first the cooking fat will be cloudy, when the legs are nearly done the fat will be clear.\n   3. If cooking the confit sous vide, season the legs with salt (not too much compared to conventional confit), then pack in your aromatics and cook sous vide for 185F (85c) for 6-8 hours for a \u201cshreddy\u201d classic confit consistency. Then chill down, in the bag, in an ice bath. Store in the fridge before using.\n4. Remove the duck legs from the oven and let them cool to room temperature in the fat. Once cooled to room temperature, if you intend to keep them in the fridge for a while, keep them in the fat to let their flavor develop. If you plan to use sooner, you can store them in a plastic bag or air-tight container. \n5. To prepare the confit, pour some fat onto a sheet tray, place the legs on and roast, skin side up, on 350F for 10-15 minutes, or until warmed. The crisp under the broiler for a couple minutes.\n\nCassoulet Beans\u2026\n\n1. Cover Beans with a few inches of water, and set aside to soak overnight. The next day rinse and drain, then set aside.\n2. In a large dutch oven, pad the bottom of the pot with the pork belly and cured ham (prevents the beans from sticking) then cover with the chicken stock. The beans should be covered by at least an inch or two of stock.\n3. Add the onion, carrot, tomatoes, tomato paste, garlic cloves, red wine vinegar, duck fat, and the herb sachet (thyme, parsley, bay, cloves, peppercorns, juniper berries).\n4. Cook gently on medium heat for an hour to an hour and a half, or until the beans are just tender. You want the beans to stop cooking just as they begin turning tender to avoid overcooking into mush.\n5. Once the beans are tender, remove the pot from the heat. Remove and discard all of the aromatic vegetables and herb sachet. Set the pork belly and cured ham aside for later use. Cover the beans up and let them hang out in their juices until we need them later.\n\nTo assemble the Cassoulet\u2026\n\n1. Start by roasting the toulouse sausage and pork ribs. Place the ribs and sausage in a pan and brown with duck fat and thyme. Once browned, deglaze the pan with water and add the jus to the bean cooking liquid. Set the meat aside for later.Place the pork ribs and sausage in a large roasting tray. Add a branch of thyme, a bay leaf, and 5 garlic cloves, and a drizzle of duck fat and oil. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until the meat has some coloring.\n2. Place all the meats at the bottom of the pot.Optionally shred up a confit leg and add it to the mix. Use a slotted spoon, or something similar to spoon the beans, without the liquid, over the meat. Once the pot is layered and filled Use the bean cooking liquid to fill the dutch oven to the top of the beans.\n3. Bake in a 400F oven for 1 and a half hours. Check the beans twice, every 30 minutes to push the crust down and add a bit more bean cooking liquid (or chicken stock if you ran out). This remoistening process is going to allow the cassoulet to get very crispy without totally burning.\n4. During the last 15 minutes of cooking, about an hour and fifteen minutes into the process, put the confit duck on a sheet tray and add to the oven. With the cassoulet. Remove the cassoulet, then broil the duck confit until the skin is crispy then add it to the top of the finished cassoulet.\n5. Remove cassoulet from oven, serve with a bit of red wine vinegar (a condiment that helps cut through the richness and ease digestion.)\n\n*Example Workflow...*\n\nDay 1 - Break down duck, render fat, begin Cure for Duck Legs, Make Toulouse sausage.\n\nDay 2- Remove duck from cure, confit duck.

That crispiness and the fluffy layers in the middle, with the cheese...is just a pleasure when you bite into them.\n\nThis recipe wasn't really hard to make, especially as you don't need to wait for the dough to rise and nothing is sticky. \nI used this recipe : \n\nIngredients : \n - 5 Cups of Flour\n - 2 Tsp salt (or a little more if you want them salty)\n - 2 Cups of Almost boiling water\n\nFor the oil that you need to brush them before rolling\n\n - 6-7 Tblsp of vegatable oil + 1 tblsp of sesame oil\n - Salt and spices that you enjoy. Garlic, Onion powder. \n - 4 Tblsp of flour\n\nProcedure : \n\n - You start by adding the flour in a bowl along with the salt and then the hot/almost boiling water. Mix it at low speed with the mixer, or use a wooden spoon.\n - Mix until everything combies and is not sticky. When you put your finger on the dough it should come out clean.\n - Let it rest for 10-15 minutes to cooldown a little covered with a plastic sheet and prepare the oil.\n - Put everything in a sauce pan and mix it at a low heat constantly to not get lumps of flour. When it starts to boil, you're done. \n - Now, cut the dough in how many peices you would like. I cut mine in 8 smaller ones because is easier to fry them.\n - Roll them thin enough with a rolling pin, but not really thin. You should not be able to see trough it. You should have in mind 2 things. \n - Long ---- and wide |   You should make it longer than wider. But keep in mind that the wider it is, the more layers you will have and those are a pleasure when you eat it.\n - After you roll the dough, brush it with the oil, this will help keeping those layers to not stick. Add the fillings Cheese, Scallions but be sure to not overfill.\n - After that, roll it as tight as you can from the wide part with your hand. Now you should have a roll. Take 1 end and roll it to the other. Press everything with the palm of your hand, add a little flour, and use the rolling pin to thin and form the pancake. Don't press TOO hard on it, and it doesn't matter if it brakes a little here and there. \n - Fry in hot oil (don't deep fry), 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown.\n - You can enjoy it with some cream cheese!", "Makin' These Scallions"]}

Then tossed in flour and other seasonings. The tossed wings are refrigerated for a minimum of 2 hours(the longer the better) to allow flour to thicken and stick better. Then air fried until crispy.\n\nI made three sauces. Two from scratch buffalo sauces(Different heat levels) and one Lemon pepper, garlic, and vinegar dry rub.\n\nBasic recipe for buffalo sauce:\n\nPepper Butter:\nMelt butter in a pan. Add chopped peppers(I use habenero, cayenne, and ghost pepper) into butter. Let peppers simmer in butter for 1 to 3 hours. This allows for all of the spiciness to absorb into the butter and mixes into the sauce better giving a fuller flavor. If you want something milder, use only jalapeno and/or cayenne.\n\nMix the sauce:\nTake any cayenne pepper sauce (You could make your own, but I did not) and add it to a sauce pan. Hit the sauce. Add garlic, lemon pepper (Crucial), chilli powder(Optional) and a small amount of red vinegar(Optional, but brings out the flavor of the spices). Taste the sauce until you are happy with the blend. Pour in the pepper butter. Add lemon pepper, cayenne pepper, or chili powder to taste until satisfied. \n\nDry Rub:\nThrow garlic powder, lemon pepper, chili powder(Optional), and black pepper(optional) into a bowl. \nImportant: Before tossing the wings, lightly drizzle red vinegar on both sides of the wing. It is important to to not over do this step. This helps to do two things. First it allows the dry rub to stick and congeal into the breading once tossed. And secondly, the vinegar will bring out some of the spices. If you overdo this step, it'll taste to vinegary.  \n\nWings are tossed in respective sauce and put in the oven at 350 to allow sauce and breading to absorb and congeal together. This also ensures everything comes out hot and ready to eat (I normally have to air fry the wings in batches, so sometimes they cool down before everything is ready).\n\nWings come out looking and tasting fried with out being actually fried. Healthier(Although probably not healthy) alternative to fried chicken wings. People do not believe me when I tell them they are not fried.\n\nThe peppers and portebello mushrooms you see as a side where stuffed with a cheese mixture. Cream cheese, red vinegar, spices, and cheddar. Usually I add chopped onions, cilantro, and diced tomatoes underneath the cheese. But was too warn out to do that this time. I also normally use balsamic for this part, but didn't have any.\n\nIf you notice a trend with the vinegar, I use vinegar as a healthy way to reduce down on sodium.", "Is air fried another way of saying oven?"]}

Here's what I did for this one: \n\nIngredients are 1 red bell pepper, 8 dry habanero chilies, 1/2 onion, 1 clove of garlic, white vinegar, salt. Remove stems and as many seeds as you wish from chilies (seeds are hot but they have tons of flavor) and boil them for 20-30 minutes. In a blender put in the onion, garlic, and bell pepper along with the chilies. I try to go about 50/50 vinegar and the leftover chili water used for boiling. Amount of salt varies greatly on taste though so add in stages, start with about 2 tsp. Blend that for about 5 minutes. For this one I strained off most of the chunks (used those for a big pot of bean chili) so I was left with just liquid. This step is optional, sometimes I like it chunkier. Finally, simmer the liquid until it thickens up. What I did next was pour it into a bottle, covered it with a cheese cloth and let it sit out for a few days, stirring it up often. This lets the flavor develop and some will heat subside. Then I stuck it in the fridge and proceeded to put it on everything that I ate for the next week. \n\nThis sauce came out super hot but has tons of great flavor. You could probably get away with just a couple of habaneros if you wanted it a little more mild. I meant to get a picture sooner when the bottle was more full but I just kept eating it.. I'd be curious to see if anybody on /r/fromscratch has any of their own hot sauce making techniques they'd care to share? \n\nedit: As irrationalNumber has pointed out, be very careful when handling hot peppers, it can burn your skin.

And they aren't. But I carve tons of pumpkins for Halloween and this is essentially what we do with all of our pumpkins, except we change it up a bit. If you're only doing one, then this method is perfectly fine. Also, the lemon juice isn't really necessary, but it's not going to hurt anything. As long as your freezer is kept at the right temps and doesn't have any issues, freezer burned pumpkin is going to be the least of your worries. \n\nSince my husband and I usually carve well over 50 pumpkins each halloween, we only cook what we scrape out of the pumpkins, which is a lot, way more than you could possibly believe. After discarding the stringy bits, I cook it in a pasta pot on the stove top until it reduces to about half size, then puree, bag and freeze. It's much faster, and you don't have to deal with cutting up the whole pumpkin and putting it in/taking it out of the oven. Now, this is the method we use with tons of pumpkins. If we only had one, it wouldn't yield very much puree. When it's all said and done, I have an entire freezer that only has pumpkin in it, and I'd say we usually have around 70-80 cups of pumpkin puree, and normally we don't even cook everything we scrape. I just cook until I'm tired of it.\n\nAlso, the jack o lantern puree will be much more mild, but still retain the pumpkin flavor. It will also be quite a bit more wet. So when baking, remember to add a little bit more of both puree and flour to retain the right consistency and ensure a bolder pumpkin flavor out of your dish.\n\nI've been doing this for years, so I hope this is helpful. :)", "I once used a small carving pumpkin for pie....it was terrible! talked to my aunt (that owns a farm) about it. She explained to me that there is a difference between a pumpkin you carve and one you eat. The carving kind are made just for that....and have a very bitter taste."]}

{"title": "Baja-style Fish Tacos: Recipe and History", "selftext": "Southern California is next in my quest to cook the signature dish of every American state. Thought this dish is surely Mexican, it has become Americanized in some aspects (depending where you go, of course) and is a top-seller on many Mexican-American menus.\n\nLegend has it Japanese sailors traveling to the Baja peninsula taught locals how to fry the fish with a tempura-like batter (something they learned from the Portuguese years prior). Not before long the crispy fried fish took on some Mexican flare from the locals and fish tacos quickly became a common on-the-go meal for fisherman and market workers. It wasn't until sometime in the 1980s did a San Diego based Mexican-American restauranteur popularize the taco by putting it on his menu. \n\nThe fish taco truly is a story of the intimate cultural connection between Mexico and the United States. If we take it a step further, perhaps a story of mid 20th century globalization between East and West (being Japan and Mexico). The rest is history.\n\nBelow you'll find my recipe for all the components of a classic SoCal, Baja-style fish taco. From Pico to Crema, it's all there. Let me know if you have any questions. Let me know if you'd like a link to the recipe video and I can shoot it over to you. I hope you like it!  \n\n\n**Fish Batter:**\n\n*This batter is inspired by The Fat Duck outside of London. The water in the alcohol evaporates quickly leaving us with a super wispy, crispy and light coating.*\n\n* 1 1/2 cup Self Rising Flour\n* 2 cups Rice Flour\n* 2 tsp Baking Powder\n* 2 Tbsp Honey\n* 1.5 cups Vodka\n* 2 cups Beer\n\n1. Mix the flour and baking soda in a large bowl. Dissolve the honey into the vodka then pour it into the flour mix. Add the beer and whisk together. Keep the batter cold in the fridge until needed.\n\n**Chili de Arbol Salsa:**\n\n*This \u201cSalsa\u201d is probably more like a hot sauce to the American palate. It\u2019s thin, vibrant red and very spicy.*\n\n* 1 Garlic clove, smashed\n* 1 cup Dried Chili de Arbol, stemmed\n* \u2153 cup Water\n* 1 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* Kosher Salt, to taste\n\n1. Snap the stems off of the chilies. Dry roast the chilis in a hot skillet until aromatic then add to a blender, do the same to the garlic.\n2. Blend the chilis and garlic until pulverized completely, then add the water, salt and vinegar and process again until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning. Serve over fish tacos.\n\n**Avocado Crema:**\n\n*This creamy sauce is a much needed cooling element to the taco. It\u2019s also good on sandwiches, eggs, etc.*\n\n* 2 avocados, pitted and peeled\n* 1 Garlic clove\n* \u00bd cup Mexican Crema\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt, more to taste\n* 3-4 Tbsp Lime juice, more to taste\n\n1. Blend everything in a food processor. If the crema is too thick, thin it down with more lime juice or water.\n\n**Pico de Gallo:**\n\n*This is everyone's favorite mild, refreshing salsa and it couldn\u2019t be easier to make.*\n\n* 3 tomato, diced and seeded\n* 1 white onion, diced\n* 1 cup Cilantro, chopped\n* 1-2 Jalapenos, finely chopped\n* 2 Tbsp Lime Juice, more to taste\n* Kosher salt, to taste\n\n**To Build the Tacos\u2026**\n\n1. Double up the tortillas, lay in the fish followed by a drizzle of the arbol salsa, the slaw, the pico and the avocado crema. Serve with a cold, crisp cerveza and crush!\n\n**P.S.** Any white saltwater fish works great for fish tacos.

After making so many sweets these last weeks, I wanted to make something easier and healthier. So here's 2 version of some creamy soup! \n\nIngredients :\n \nSoup 1 \n\n - 60gr Parsnip\n - 100gr Carrot\n - 320gr Red Bell Pepper\n - 300gr Tomatoes\n - 205gr Onion\n - 6 cloves/20gr Garlic\n - 150ml Veggie Stock/Soup\n\n\nSoup 2 \n\n - 80gr Beets\n - 30gr Garlick / 9 gloves\n - 150gr Parsnip\n - 220gr Celery Root\n - 150gr Red Onion\n - 130gr Yellow Onion\n - 120gr Carrot\n - 500ml Veggie Stock/Soup\n\nProcedure : \n\nStart by washing and peeling your vegetables. Cut in small cubes/pieces. You want the rooty(hard) vegetables to be smaller than the softer ones (for example tomato, red bell pepper)\nbecause the harder ones will cook harder. Pop them in the oven at 180-200\u00b0C for around 20 minutes, for soup 2 around 25-30 minutes. You have to check on them to see when they start getting\nthat caramelization and they become soft.\n\nPut them into a strong blender and start adding veggie stock. You can replace a part of the veggie stock with cream. I personally don't like it with cream so I made it with veggie stock.\nYou can use chicken stock if you want that. Adjust the veggie stock/cream little by little until you get the consistence that you like.\n\nIn soup 2 I added a hot pepper, and it was super spicy, so take be careful about that."]}

I love making roast chicken, it's  such a quintessential dish in my opinion and versatile as well. That  being said I know there are many issues people run into when making a  roast chicken. First and foremost being how to ensure crispy skin on the  bird. There's a trick I use that anyone can do, and I decided to film  myself to show people. Video link is below:\n\n[https://youtu.be/4duJZ26a0jM](https://youtu.be/4duJZ26a0jM)\n\nI find that there's a few simple principles to follow if you want to ensure that crispy, crackly skin every time:\n\n* Hot Water Scalding\n   * I  know it seems weird, but this is a trick that cooks in China use for  peking duck to get that golden brown, crackling skin. They boil water,   and pour large spoonfuls of it over the bird.\n   * What   this does is render the collagen in the skin into gelatin. The problem   with collagen when roasting is that it hold onto moisture and fat,   leading to soggy skin. By cooking the skin a bit now, we accelerate the   process. When doing this the skin will visibly contract a bit, but   that's not a huge issue.\n* Dry Skin\n   * So after scalding the skin, we need to dry it out. Excess moisture will   not lead to crispiness, it'll have the opposite effect. We just poured   hot water onto the skin adding moisture to it. While this helps, we now   need to dry that hot water up after it partially cooks the skin.\n   * Either thoroughly dab the bird with paper towels, making sure to get all the   nooks and crannies that roast birds are infamous for. Or stick the bird   in the fridge overnight uncovered. The heating cycle in the fridge is   fantastic for drying out foods exposed to that air.\n   * Cold   air doesn't hold water as well as warm air; so when the air in the   fridge is warmed a bit (this happens in all fridges, air temp fluctuates   up and down) it absorbs moisture from the food. Once the fridge starts   to cool the air, that moisture in the air is lost to the outside. But   the air will heat up over time, once again pulling moisture from the   food - effectively drying out the bird\n* High Heat\n   * Maillard reactions, or browning start happening at 310F/154C. This means the   surface of the food needs to reach that temp, and because air is a poor   conductor of heat, the oven's temp must be much higher than 310C/154C.\n   * I recommend 400F/200C or higher, as this is hot enough to ensure the fat   renders out and maillard browning, aka crispiness in the skin, can   occur.\n   * Rubbing   the skin with oil can also help as oils are much better at heat   transfer than air, and a uniform coating of oil can help with even  browning.\n\nLet me know if any of you try these techniques out! Would love to hear how it went for you.", "Awesome tips! And one more is adding baking soda and salt to the skin. The rise in pH speeds the browning.", "I suggest using this recipe https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/perfect-pan-roasted-chicken-thighs"]}

Most takes on this type of pie don't have nearly enough fat in the dough but you seem good to go on that front! You might consider playing with the type of fat in the dough if you haven't yet as that can change the crust dramatically. From what I've been told by folks working to make some of the great pies in your city, Crisco is the fat of choice. Also, if you haven't yet, check out the America's test Kitchen take on Deep Dish.

Seinfeld? \nHey I'm George again, and today I'm making my first Calzones! And not only that, but I'm trying the fillings from Seinfeld. (In a way)\nI made pizza before but not Calzones. I think the hardest part was to seal them. \n\nRecipe for the dough : \n\n - 650g flour\n - 7g dried yeast\n - salt\n - 25-30ml olive oil\n -325 ml of warm water\n - pinch of sugar for the water and yeast.\n - I also added 25 ml more of water later after some kneading. \n - Cooked at 180 degree Celsius until golden brown\n - Butter to brush after is done\n\nFilling :\n\n - (For the Seinfeld one) Eggplant, Ricotta Cheese, Mozzarella, Pepperoni\nFor my own fillings (I made more than 1)\n - (Precooked) : Bacon, Onion, Kapia Peppers, Eggplant\n - Mushrooms, Salami, Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Smoked Cheese, Tomato Sauce with Basil.\n\nIf you have any questions..please ask. I'm more than happy to answer or talk about this recipe (Or any recipe tbh).\nIf you'd like to support me and see more, please visit my youtube channel where I post 1 new recipe per week.\n\nProcedure :\n\n - Add the flour into a bowl. Add the yeast into the warm water with a pinch of sugar and mix it together.\n - Let it sit for 5 minutes. \n - Cut the eggplant in slices, and salt both sides. Let it sit for 20-30 minutes to release the bitter water, that you will have to wipe off with a napkin.\n - Now put the water with the yeast into the flour. Mix with a wooden spoon or your dough mixer. I personally only used 1 bowl with 1 wooden spoon.\n - Mix until everything almost combine. Then use your hand. At this time it should not be super sticky and is gonna be easy to kneed.\n - After mixing with your hand for 2-5 minutes, if everything's too dry, add 25 ml of water more (I needed to add). \n - Now mix a little more, until the dough is not sticky anymore. Mine was not sticky at all. When you press it with your finger it should not stick to it.\n - Let it rest for at least 1 hour\nNow you can precook some of the ingredients. \n - After wiping the eggplant, put some oil on it, and put it in the oven at 180 degree celsius for 30-ish minutes.\n - Get the kapia/redbell pepper and an onion and cook it in a pan with a little oil + some butter until the onion is translucent and the kapia/bellpepper is soft. \n - Add salt and pepper\n - Bacon, you cook it in the oven on a cooking rack until crisp. \n\nNow the hardest part (at least for me) shaping the Calzone. I cut my dough in 8 small/medium calzone's. You can cut yours how you want.\nYou need to shape the dough in an oval shape. (For me shaping the dough is really hard)\nAfter that, don't overfill your Calzone, otherwise you will have problems sealing it. For the Seinfield one, you need to add Cheese, Pepperoni and Eggplant. \nFor the rest, fill them as you'd like. I suggest starting with a layer of Tomato Sauce or Ricotta Cheese. After that, use whatever your hearth tells you.\nYou need to cover the filling with a part of the dough, and shape it. To seal it, I did a twist in the back corners, and the rest I rotate it and pinch it. \nYou can mix some water with flour into a small bowl and use that as a \"glue\", but you still have to pinch it.\n\nNow cook it at 180 degree Celsius until golden brown. When you get them out of the oven, have some melted butter to brush on top of them.\n\nEnjoy! \n\nOof this is a huge wall of text.", "That crust is beautiful. Wow :0", "Calzones are pointless.

I wouldn't do more than double the amount of Sriracha on it as that would mess up the consistency.\ufeff\n\n    \n    Cock Sauce\n    1 1/2 lbs red jalalpeno or gochu peppers, \n    6 cloves garlic, peeled\n    1/4 cup of a dark sugar (brown sugar, demerara etc)\n    1 tbsp kosher/sea salt or 1/2 tbsp pickling salt\n    1/2 cup white vinegar\n    + remove and discard@ the stems from the peppers \n    + place them in a blender or food processor\n    + add everything except the vinegar\n    + blend until the pieces won't get smaller, scrape the sides as needed\n    + pour evenly into two sterilized two cup jars \n    + loosely fit the lids on (they need to breath)\n    + let them sit for 6 days at room temperature to ferment\n    + once they start bubbling stir the mix each day until they stop\n    + add mix to blender\n    + add the vinegar\n    + blend until smooth\n    + strain through a fine mesh strainer to remove seeds and skins\n    + transfer to a pot and bring to a boil\n    + reduce heat to simmer\n    + simmer until it thickens enough to hold onto a spoon (5-50 min)\n    + transfer to in sterilized jar and store in refrigerator for up to 6 months\n    @ you can save the stems if you are going to use them as a yogurt culture starter\n    \n    "]}

This is tough for me and I've been doing proper chef work for a long time. I think it is hard to give a top 10 traditional dishes just because there are so many different kinds of cuisine. I don't think there is any specific list of 10 dishes you should know because this is going to be so different by region. I think maybe focusing on techniques you should have down might be better, for example:\n\n* Egg cookery. Poached, fried, hard boiled, soft boiled, scrambled, omelets, whatever, the list goes on.\n* The mother sauces, and some variants.\n* Stock. Chicken, beef, fish, and more.\n* Knife skills and the different kinds of cut as well as rudimentary butchery and knife maintenance.\n* Some baking and candy knowledge. Quick breads, yeasted breads, biscuits, caramel, some pastry. \n* You should be able to adlib a balanced dressing. Fat, salt, acid. And an emulsion.\n* Know how and when to apply the different kind of heat. Wet vs. Dry.\n* Thorough understanding of meat doneness.\n* Thorough understanding of food safety, risk factors, and its effect on food. Food, acid, time, temperate, oxygen, moisture. As well as proper sanitation knowledge.\n* Thorough understanding and working knowledge of common kitchen tools and reactive metals and ingredients.\n* Pasta and grain cookery.\n* Salt layering.\n\nhm... what else. I think if you understand these things you should be able to make most anything that isn't very advanced in any one direction. Butchery & baking is a lot. Especially getting into seafood and pastry, but there are so many good people in any community that can take care of this for you.\n\nI think salt layering and heat application are maybe the most important. If you can layer salt well, understand how heat should be applied, most of your food will be pretty good if you are starting with good ingredients and a working knowledge of a recipe.\n\nRegarding recipes, yeah its cool to just riff and make it up as you go, but even when I'm doing menu development and starting from scratch, when doing proper creation, I always sit down with a pen and paper and write down what I'm going to do and what ingredients I'm going to use. I might not have proportions figured out, but I always go in with a plan. For example, chicken parm. If I needed to make this I could probably just wing it and it would come out fine, but typically what I would do is start by looking at a few recipes a know I can trust, and use that for inspo to do my own thing, writing down my ideas and process and I create, and using my best judgement to augment any recipe. Then, start cooking with that list.", "This also depends a lot on the country/culture you are from", "I agree that tradition is a loaded word, but I agree that everyone should have their go to dishes that they can pull out without a recipe. Here are mine:\n\n- whole chicken: I have a go to for oven roasting, slow cooking, and pressure cooking.\n\n- veggies: I have simple routines to stream, saute, and roast. It's amazing what garlic, salt, pepper and olive oil will do.\n\n-pasta: I have my go to mac and cheese and also a tomato sauce recipe.\n\n-lentils: I have my standard dal recipe that I love and can pull out whenever I want a meatless meal.\n\nI guess the take away for me is find a few simple things that you really like to eat and keep making them. The more you practice you can tweak it and make it your own.", "Not a chef, just a gal who rebelled against frozen trays of turkey and gravy being acceptable for dinner, and I'd personally focus less on specific dishes and more on how to build a dish in general. Then you're never stuck not knowing what to do because you're missing a critical ingredient for your dish. \n\n* Dressings for salads and grain bowls are acid + fat + seasonings + herbs. My go-to is 1 part balasamic + 2 parts olive oil + salt/pepper + oregano and garlic, but I also like mashing strawberries with avocado oil, rice vinegar, honey, and fresh basil if I'm doing something light with goat cheese. Other [examples here](https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/vinaigrette-recipes/). Knowing how to make dressings is a super versatile skillset because of their wide application use, and how impressive it is to people who can't cook when you whip it one up out of random ingredients in their pantry. \n* How to compose a salad or a grain bowl - My strategy is crunchy, juicey, sweet, protein, carb, color. A guide by one of my favorite chefs is [here.](https://food52.com/blog/26162-why-you-should-make-a-big-salad?utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_campaign=Editorial) \n* Risotto. You can put anything into a risotto, you just need know the base componenets that make it a risotto and how you put it together. I've made a chicken soup based risotto, a garlic shrimp risotto, and even a hamburger soup based risotto (hamburger soup is a midwest poverty classic). \n* Tomato Sauce. Learn the basic components of a tomato based pasta sauce and a pizza sauce and you're set for life on jarred marinara. San Marzano tomatoes, not san marzano style plum tomatoes, are a must. \n* How to roast meat and vegetables, just in general. \n* How to make a [pan sauce](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-an-easy-pan-sauce-in-minutes-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-211220).

So I got a \"kit\" at one point as a gift from Williams Sonoma   (pizza crust+ sauce),  did THAT on the weber and it was just freaking great.  As good a crust as I've ever had.  So I've gone down a hole trying to make a better pizza crust, and its just not working.  I can't get beyond 'meh'.\n\nI've tried '00' flour,  more expensive bread flour.

Changing the flour will change the texture - 00 flour made with soft wheat needs less water (because of the fine grind) and has high protein/low gluten which gives it that crispy tender texture.

WAAYhayHAYHAAAAAAY too much.  The result (with 600 grams flour) was basically sticky flour soup.  I had to add more flour.  I figured I added an additional 150 grams, aside from the floured surface  (which I had to flour a lot as this  dough kept sucking up all the flour I laid down when kneading).  All told.. lets call it at 165 additional grams of flour, so 765 grams of flour ended up being used.  even with all that extra flour, still pretty sticky.\n\nNote this was bread flour (\"Pillsbury's Best\")\n\nlet this rise for 2 hours or so...  it rose a LOT.  the 6g of yeast did its yeasty best.   I divided into 3 balls.  these put coated lightly with olive oil,  put in covered containers and let rise for 24 hours (not in the fridge).  They rose a LOT.\n\nNext day (today) .  preheated the oven with the pizza stone in it to 430 (I added 10 degrees.. hadn't planned on it but .. I live on the edge, no rules, doing 37mph in a 35mph zone, I'm a barbarian)  for about 45 minutes.  this is about 30 minutes longer than just taking out the stone when the 'pre heated' alarm goes off.\n\nI rolled one out one of the dough balls on the parchment.  put on the sauce and toppings.  Took out the pizza stone,  and slid the pizza onto the stone via parchment paper (I still nearly managed to dump everything on the floor)\n\ncooked for 14 minutes.\n\nthe result:\n\nnot too bad!   my primary complaint was that I ended up making the crust toward the middle far too thin, and it kinda flopped.  But I think this is purely bcause I just rolled it too thin .   The outer 2 thirds of the crust were pretty darn good!  the right amount of chewy (especially The \"pizza butt\").   The primary thing it was lacking was a little bit of crunch on the outside.   But i really got some improvement!\n\nSo... next steps\n\nnext week (pizza night is wednesdays) for the next batch I will (in keeping with my original recipe bas)\n\ndial back the water to only an additional  20-30ml water\n\ndial back the additional yeast (to maybe 4g, as 6g gave a LOT LOT  of rise to 765 g of flour, so probably don't need so much if I'm not adding so much flour)\n\ndon't roll it so thin.\n\nmaybe crank up the temp as well\n\nIf people are interested I will post results next week again.", "So here's a simple recipe I use, it's from a company that makes pizza ovens call forno bravo (sp?) anyways from what I can read In your post you should give this a try.\n\n400g double O flour\n325g warm water\n10 g salt\n3g instant yeast.\n\nMix dry ingredients in first then water.

{"title": "Home-Cured, Glazed and Smoked Whole Holiday Ham", "selftext": "Ham reminds me of cartoons from the 1950-60s. Those big ornate, steaming hams decorated with pineapple rings, cherries and cloves... definitely the food of yesterday. Then I got to thinking, why do I never see whole hams presented at the market or even at most well-stocked butchers? The fact is, people just don't make whole ham on the reg like they used to. Thus, marking the beginning of my quest to make a classic cured, glazed and smoked ham from scratch in my home kitchen.\n\nMy adventure started by researching all about curing and curing salts. I spoke with a handful of my chef friends and picked the mind of a great local butcher. Then I delved into making a yummy, holiday-y maple/dijon glaze and finally figured out how to turn my Weber kettle charcoal grill into a smoker.\n\nAfter a few weeks of planning and testing, I came up on some accurate brine/curing measurements and what I believe to be a sound technique and recipe to make a whole ham. I'm going to provide a picture, the technique and all of my measurements in the post below. I'm also going to provide a video for those of you who prefer something visual. We still have time before Christmas and New Years - this could be a fun project to undertake for the holidays! Good luck, let me know if you have any questions.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*My Cure/Brine Measurements\u2026*\n\n* *Total Ham Weight - 14.5lb (6578g)*\n* *Total Ham Weight (w/o bone) - 10.5lb (4762g)*\n* *Bone Weight - 3-4lb (1814g)*\n* *Water - 4qt (1 gallon) = 3800g \\* 3 = 11400g*\n* *5% Salt of water weight = 570g*\n* *3% Sugar of water weight = 342g*\n* Pink Salt (.25% of meat weight) - (4762g \\* .0025) = 11.92 \\~ 12g Pink Salt aka Prague Powder #1\n\n*\\*\\*\\*(Salt %* *x Water Weight = Total Kosher Salt weight)*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Use the same equation to calculate Total Sugar Weight*\n\n\\*\\*\\*I\u2019ve spoken to many amazing professional cooks and chefs, butchers about pink salt and everybody gave me a different answer in terms of how to use it. However one thing was constant - a little goes a long way. Too much of this stuff can be toxic, so take it easy. Less is more.\n\n*Maple-Dijon Ham Glaze\u2026*\n\n* 1 Cup Dark Brown Sugar\n* 1/ 2 Cup Dark Maple Syrup\n* 1/ 4 Cup Dijon Mustard\n* 1/ 4 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder\n* 1/ 2 Tsp Ground Clove\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n**Technique\u2026**\n\n1. Score ham.\n2. Weigh and record ham. Use weight of ham to then measure out .25% pink salt #1 and set aside.\n3. Take weight of large brining vessel and zero scale. Add the ham to the vessel and fill with water until the meat is submerged by a few inches. Remove the ham and record the weight of the water.\n4. Measure out 5% salt and 3% sugar by weight of the water.\n   1. This is a traditional gradient brine, not to be mistaken with an ultra precise equilibrium.\n5. Mix salt, sugar and pink salt into the cold water in the large vessel until dissolved.\n6. Place the ham on a large sheet tray and inject the meat a few times all over. Once injected, place the ham in the brine, cover and refrigerate.\n   1. The ham should brine at a rate of 2lb per day. So if you have a 15lb ham, keep it in the brine for about a week.\n7. Stir the brine on day 2, inject again on day 4, stir once more on day 5 then remove the ham from the brine on day 7.\n   1. Feel free to stir the brine every day if possible.\n8. Rinse the ham thoroughly under running water, then pat dry. Let the ham rest uncovered on a rack in the fridge for 12-24 hours.\n   1. This stage will allow something called a pellicle to form, which will allow an outer crust to form when cooked and help the smoke adhere to the ham.\n9. Smoke the ham in a 200F smoker until the internal temp reads 130-140F.\n10. Meanwhile, make the glaze by mixing together glaze ingredients and cooking down until viscous.\n11. After 2 hours, brush the ham with glaze, then cover.\n12. After another hour or so, glaze the ham again and smoke until the internal temp hits 130-140F. Bring the ham back inside, glaze again, and finish cooking in a 250F oven until the internal temp hits 155F.\n13. If serving immediately, let rest for at least 45 minutes before carving.\n14. If cooking ahead, chill down the ham. The next day, carve the ham then set it on a tray to warm it in a very low oven. Once warmed through, plate pieces on a presentation platter and serve immediately.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "created_utc": 1608136994.0, "score": 36, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kecnbm/homecured_glazed_and_smoked_whole_holiday_ham/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["**The Ultimate Holiday Ham** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msOiXmVXSDY&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msOiXmVXSDY&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)"]}

A pellicle is often transferred to culture new batches simply because it contains microbes on its surface or throughout, but you can also just innoculate it with the live vinegar and not include the pellicle. Typically people include the pellicle and some mother to help speed it up and let the pellicle help regulate oxygen.\n\nThe acetobacter themselves are going to impart their own flavors along with the acetic acid they produce, but the acetic acid will taste the same and only the liquid added from the vinegar culture source will add that particular flavor. If you innoculate a red wine with a fair amount of ACV then some of the ACV flavor obviously comes along, but everything produced thenceforth will not taste like ACV. The alcohol base being innoculated will provide the majority of the flavor (Distilled white vinegar is closest example of what acetic acid tastes like since its made with a neutral tasting spirit). Like, I made pineapple wine and then innoculated with Bragg's ACV and while there are tones of ACV the proportions used means its tastes more like pineapple vinegar than ACV.\n\nAny raw/unpasteurized/live vinegar from the store can be used; Bragg's is probably the most widely available, but any live vinegar will do. You can also make a fruit fly trap that can be used to source the acetobacter. You can also just do a wild harvest by placing wine exposed to oxygen with a cloth cover like you would otherwise. Inoculation is a means of getting a particular strain of acetobacter to take over (some wild strains can taste bad and some can taste good). Wine + oyxgen + time wants to become vinegar. Inoculation speeds things up a little and offers more control. \n\nThe biggest tip is to ensure proper oxygen absorption and ABV. ABV should be around 7-8% and lower than 10-11% conservatively speaking. Dilution for store bought wines and simply controlling sugars/cultures for homemade wines. For oxygen you want to have a container that is about as wide as it is deep to increase the surface area and thus oxygen absorption. You can use other methods, and sometimes with a more active culture you can have the surface area be smaller but its a good idea since more oxygen means faster process (there are industrial and home methods for pumping in oxygen to cut the time down significantly [tumble injection methods for distilled vinegars can drop the process to a few days where as simply letting it sit undisturbed can take a month or three]).\n\nThere is /r/fermentation but also most methods will work.", "/r/vinegar is a thing too."]}

When meat cubes are nice and firm, dump them into the bowl of a food processor. Don't overfill! Process in batches if necessary.\n\n3. Pulse cubes until meat is as finely ground as you like it. Beef and lamb usually require more pulsing than chicken and pork. \n\n4. If making burgers, form the meat into patties and season liberally with salt and pepper just before cooking.

{"title": "Making Tofu with Fresh Soybeans", "selftext": "I love tofu. I know plenty of people out there who like to hate on it, but the fact is - Tofu is what you make it. The sauce, cooking technique and a number of other factors is what determines if the tofu is good or bad. One largely overlooked factor, in modern times at least, is the quality of the actual soybeans used to make the tofu and the tofu itself. Like any other protein or vegetable, there is a noticeable difference between good and bad tofu. I've been lucky enough to live near a market that sells super great, homemade tofu that I buy regularly. However, as of recent fall is in full effect and my local farmer's markets are beginning to close for the season... so I decided to have a whack at making my own soybean tofu, from scratch, at home and it turned out GREAT!\n\nTofu making is a super fun, different cooking project that is surprisingly simple and fairly inexpensive to make. Plus, like eating homemade pasta, there's something about eating tofu made by your own hands that is mega satisfying. I'm going to leave the recipe, technique directions and a short explainer video for my visual people below. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments.\n\n*Tofu Ingredients:*\n\n* 310g Soaked Soybeans (2 cups)\n* 946ml Water (4 cups)\n* 15ml Liquid Nigari (1 tbsp), or other \"coagulant\"\n* 30ml Water for mixing Nigari (2 tbsp)\n\n*Tofu Technique:*\n\n1. Submerge 2 cups of soybeans in water and soak overnight. \\*This will yield more beans than you need for one portion from this recipe, but I like the \"insurance policy.\"\n2. Drain the soaked soybeans and add 2 cups of soaked soybeans to a blender along with 4 cups of water. Blend until smooth.\n3. Pour into sauce pan and bring up to a boil on medium heat, then reduce to simmer and simmer for 10 minutes. Skim the top foam.\n4. Pour the bean water mixture into a strainer lined with cheese cloth positioning a bowl underneath to catch the liquid. This liquid is our fresh soymilk.  \n\n   1. Squeeze the bean mash in the cheese cloth to fully drain it. Reserve this mash, it makes a great stew, but that's another recipe.\n5. Add 1 tbsp of liquid Nigari to 2 tbsp of water, mix and set aside.\n6. Pour the fresh soy milk in another sauce pan and over low-medium heat, bring it to 170F (76c).\n7. Once the tofu mixture hits 170F, cut the heat and gently add in half of the Nigari water mixture. Stir gently and pop the lid on. Let this sit for 5 minutes, then repeat the process with the remaining nigari mixture.\n8. By now the curd should be separated from the whey. Pour the mixture into a tofu mold lined with cheesecloth, put a weight on top, and let the press the tofu to your desired firmness. The longer the press, the firmer the tofu.  \n\n   1. A good starting place is 5 minutes for soft tofu, 7 for medium and 10+ minutes for anything firm.\n9. Store the pressed tofu in cold water and let chill for at least 30 minutes before eating. This will help tighten things up and give it a nice texture, even if you prefer your tofu on the softer side.\n10. Use immediately, or store in water, refrdgerated for 4 or 5 days.\n\n**Making Tofu from Scratch with Fresh Soybeans -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\\_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2\\_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_grQxw2H2Ds&lc=Ugwfcaq2_0RTotwNgq94AaABAg&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "created_utc": 1603294694.0, "score": 37, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/jff7fc/making_tofu_with_fresh_soybeans/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you!", "I JUST made tofu!

Then chucked all of it in the Ice Cream maker ( a big stirrer with a frozen floor).  \n\nThe cocolate mousse was more or less by-the-books. Melt about 8 ounces of dark chocolate with 1/3 cup of cream, add another 1/3 during and at the end of the melting process. I was too lazy to do it au bain marie but it really is recommended as chocolate can burn very easily.

Separate 4 or 5 eggs, get rid of the chalazee if you prefer (I do), gently stir in the yokes with the chocolate. You'll notice it takes on a more creamy texture, tasty!. Whip up the whites in a very clean bowl (I clean it with lemon juice right before use), sprinkle in some salt and the 1/2 cup of syrup you had from making the ice cream. This will help fluff up and solidify the whites. Now comes the tricky part:  \n\n Gently fold in a bit of the whipped whites into the chocolate until it is homogenous. Then gently fold in the rest. How lightly you've folded will determine how light and fluffed the mousse will become. Fold too hard or too long and you get a very solid & heavy mousse.

I work at a bakery so hopefully I can be of some help.  \n\n\nYou'll want to knead the pizza dough for quite a while. When you knead, you are developing the gluten. Gluten is a protein structure within the dough. The less you knead, the more dense and tight the air pockets are within the dough, creating that tough chewiness. You want to work the dough to elongate and stretch those gluten strands so they will become tender!  \n\n\nIf you are not sure when to stop kneading, a great thing to look for is the \"window pane test.\" Take a little piece of the dough and gently spread it apart. If the dough is not ready, it will rip and tear very easily. Just keep kneading! When the dough is ready, it will be very thin and you will be able to see through it. Here is a youtube video for reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYNj9FZAbzM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYNj9FZAbzM) \n\nAfter kneading, put the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a tea towel or plastic wrap. You can let it sit for an hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.  \n\n\nHappy baking!", "Not exactly a direct response to your question but you might check out these recipes:\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe.html\n\nThis one is essentially a noknead style pizza dough. Dump it all in a bowl, get it mixed together and wait 8 hours at room temp. Comes out great.\n\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/07/basic-new-york-style-pizza-dough.html\n\nThis one also comes out great if you have a food processor. You basically combine the ingredients in a food processor and knead it for 30 seconds. (It blew my mind what a nice dough this turns out with such a small amount of working.) Then it rises in the fridge overnight or up to 5 days. \n\nThe first one they designed to cook in a cast iron skillet as a deep dish and the second one I think they recommend a baking stone but they both come out good stretched thinner/sheet panned/whatever.", "I agree with the other poster. Kneading pizza dough by hand is a bit of a chore but I think gives you the best sense of when the dough shifts from sticky and shaggy to nice and springy. You do want a nice bouncy dough for pizza. I would also say that pizza dough should be a good amount softer/more slack than say a loaf bread or bagel. If you had a very tough dough it's possible it was a bit too dry/stiff (too much flour, low hydration) rather than overworked. Often if your pizza dough is still a bit sticky right after kneading the rise and shaping with flour can help get you the right texture. I really like the Mel's kitchen cafe recipe both for overnight dough and quick dough. I would say the overnight dough is more forgiving since a slow cold rise helps the gluten development even if you don't quite knead the right amount. https://www.melskitchencafe.com/whole-wheat-pizza-dough/\n\nI have made the recipe with all purpose and no wheat as well and it turns out very nicely", "This is a favorite of mine. Very easy, just need the lead time.\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/jim-laheys-no-knead-pizza-dough-recipe.html", "An overly chewy dough is an indication of over kneading. Per tony gemignani of the Pizza Bible and tons of pizza restaurants and awards, a pizza does not need to be kneaded as much as bread. For example, for his standard american pizza dough he only kneads the dough for 2-3 minutes.", "I've been chasing dough for years. Many different methods but a couple of things I noticed made a big difference.\n\n- autolyse: mix the flour and water first just until there's no more dry bits. Let it rest a half hour, then add the salt and other ingredients.\n- Cold fermentation.. 3 days in the fridge. It tastes so much better.\n- If I use premade doughs from a store or pizza shop, letting it rise a bit before baking helps the texture a lot.\n- Two stones/steels (I have a stone for top, steel for bottom) I start on the top stone until it's half cooked, cheese melted nicely, then move to the bottom to finish so the crust hits fresh heat.\n\nI recently got a book that has a pretty easy method that gave me outstanding results - The Pizza Bible by Tony Gemignani\n\nHis method is a little fussy but results are outstanding. Following his instructions yielded a crust that was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with nice hole structure.", "What recipe did you follow? What type of flour? How did you work the dough? Did you do a no-knead recipe?\n\nA perfect dough will spring back about 50% when it's proofed properly. Not stay indented but not bounce back completely either.\n\nFor beginners I'd say find a no-knead recipe, they're fairly fool proof, then make sure you have a proper proof time.\n\nIt's hard to tell you how to do it properly if we don't know what you did. And we can't tell you how to do it \"properly\" because there's multiple ways to make a pizza dough.", "I love this recipe!! From @bakingsteel on Instagram.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/--8vM2rxldI"]}

Make sure casings are the right size. Some come packed in salt, so rinse the casings with water if that\u2019s the case for you. Any good butcher should sell hog casings.\n2. Dice meat and fat into small cubes, place on metal sheet tray then transfer to the freezer for 20 minutes or so.\n   1. The meat is easier to work with and holds its texture when cold, easier on your stand mixer. Making sure everything that touches the meat is cold ensures a healthy saaaasage. That fat will separate from the meat if warm - Stella culinary \n3. Measure out the spices and herbs. Toast appropriate spices on stovetop, then transfer to grinder and blend. Work spices mixture into cubed meat until evenly coated. Set aside.\n   1. Don\u2019t toast the dried herbs, they burn easily.\n4. Remove the grinder components and chilled meat from the freezer. Set the grinder up on the stand mixer with a half pan underneath to catch the meat.\n5. Insert the coarse die (8mm) and run the machine on level 2 one time letting the ground meat fall into the pan.\n   1. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bowl is super cold. However, if you\u2019d like to run the meat through the grinder again for a finer grind, chill the ground meat and grinder for 10-20 mins, then have at it a second time.\n6. Pour cold water and vinegar into the bowl with the ground meat mixture and mix with paddle attachment until the meat and fat slightly emulsify, or with a food processor if you have one.\n7. Once mixed thoroughly, attach the appropriate sausage stuffer attachment. Load the grinder and hopper up with ground meat and run it on low speed until meat comes out the end. Once meat comes out the end, turn off the stuffer and slide on your pre-soaked hog casings.\n   1. Large stuffing tube for big casings, small for skinnier casings.\n8. Hog casing on the stuffer nozzle, and meat pushed to the end, tie off a knot on the casing and begin sausage stuffing process on low heat. Use one hand to plunge in the ground meat mixture and the other to finesse the sausage as it comes out the end.\n   1. We don\u2019t want any airholes in the sausage that could lead to bursting when tying or cooking.\n   2. Don\u2019t stuff the sausages too too much or they\u2019ll be hard to twist off.\n9. Once all meat has been sausage-ified, cut off any remaining hog casing. Use a needle or cake tester to prick small holes all over the sausage to release any air bubbles.\n   1. Save extra hog casing in a container packed with salt and refrigerate. They\u2019ll last for a long time. Up to 6 months I\u2019ve read.\n10. Cook right away, or leave uncovered in the fridge for casings to dry out and flavors to meld overnight. Your call.\n   1. Serve brats with a good bun, a bit of spicy mustard, and if feeling festive some homemade sauerkraut. Orrrrrr make beer braised brats by doing the following\u2026\n   2. Brats should last in the fridge for 4-5 days, or frozen for a couple months.\n\nTECHNIQUE FOR BEER BRAISED BRATS...\n\n1. Add a bit of oil to cast iron, brown brats and flip then remove from pan.\n2. Add sliced onions to pan. Season with salt. Cook onions over medium heat stirring until they\u2019re about 25% caramelized, 10 or so minutes minutes.\n3. Once caramelized add butter, garlic, black pepper, paprika, brown sugar. Stir until incorporated then add flour to the spiced onion mixture and stir in again. Cook for 1-2 more minutes. \n4. Once mixed, stir in dark beer (oktoberfest preferably). At this step you can also add optional mustard and sauerkraut. Mix the stock and beer into the seasoned onions and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes until slightly reduced.\n5. After 5 minutes the liquid should be slightly reduced, introduce brats back into the pan with the onion braising liquid and cook until the beer gravy is thick enough to your liking and brats are cooked to at least 165F or 74c. \n6. Optional parsley or fennel frond garnish\n7. Serve with more sauerkraut and mustard. Bun and mashed potatoes optional.\n\n**Easy Homemade Bratwurst & How to Cook Beer Brats**  \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dco0gNlXbS8&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "created_utc": 1600873436.0, "score": 34, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/iybtfq/wisconsin_style_bratwurst_braised_in_beer/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I love you.", "This looks amazing, thank you!", "This may be a dumb question but what do you mean by toasting the spices. \n\nAlso, i'm assuming you add the spices to the brine.

Line a baking sheet with foil and top it with a metal cooling rack.\n\nHasselback the hot dogs using a sharp knife: Lightly slice a sharp knife down into the hot dog, stopping short of cutting through to the cutting board. Make your slices around 1/4 inch thick. (google Hasselback to see an image if you don't know what that is, my description is lacking)\n\nCombine the syrup & mustard, and brush the sliced hot dogs with half of the mixture. Rub the marinade gently in with your hands to get into the score/slice marks.\n\nPlace the hot dogs on the cooling rack and cook for 20 minutes. Remove from oven. Cut 6 hot dogs in half for the 12 muffins, snack on the rest of the hot dogs or save for later.\n\nIncrease oven to 425F. Grease a normal-sized muffin pan for 12 muffins.\n\nCombine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl.\n\nBeat egg, milk, & oil in a separate bowl. Use a small blender to chop up the canned corn a little (still chunky, but not all whole kernels).\n\nCombine flour mixture with egg mix, corn, & chopped vegs, and stir until combined.\n\nSpoon into muffin pans. Top each muffin with a half-hot-dog. Baste hot dogs with reserved glaze.\n\nBake at 425F for 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nCombine peanut sauce ingredients, adding water last, as needed.\n\nPlate the slaw & muffindogs.

{"title": "Split Pea Soup with Home-Cured Ham", "selftext": "Split pea soup is a popular way to use leftover ham for a good reason. It's chunky, rich and tasty. The smoke lent from a good leftover ham bone or fresh ham hock lends a smokey, porky taste that's hard to find in other vegetable-based soups. Split pea begins its journey in a solid state, with hard split peas and other lone ingredients scattered about, then over the long simmering process things change and the soup turns into the creamy, puree we all know and love.\n\nI made a giant ham from scratch a few weeks back so I was sitting on a leftover femur, aiche and shank bone... what better way to utilize the bones and leftover stew meat than making Split Pea Soup!? I ended up making a big batch of soup, saving some to eat throughout the week and freezing the rest for a quick dinner later in the month.\n\nBelow you'll find the ingredients and technique for my Split Pea Soup recipe. As usual, I'll also include a link to a video to those of you who prefer something visual. Feel free to sub out yellow split peas for green, and to use a fresh smoked ham hock or something similar if you don't have leftover ham bones in your freezer (likely the majority of you.) I hope this helps!\n\n**Split Pea Soup INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter (30g)\n* 1 Yellow Onion, diced (320g)\n* 5 Celery Stalks, diced (140g)\n* 4 Medium Carrots, peeled + diced (205g)\n* 4 Garlic Cloves, minced (8g)\n* 1/ 2 cup Dry Sherry Wine (125ml) \\*see note\n* 1 lb Dried Split Peas (454g)\n* 8 cups Chicken Stock (1893ml)\n* 2 cups Ham, shredded or diced (260g) \\*see note\n* 5 sprigs Fresh Thyme\n* 2 Fresh Bay Leaves\n* Ham Bones - femur, shank and aiche \\*see note\n\n*Salt + Pepper TT*\n\n*TT= to taste*\n\n*\\*Feel free to use store-bought ham, or sub for fresh thick-cut bacon.*\n\n*\\*\\*Pork stock can be subbed for Chicken. Just make sure it\u2019s \u201creal\u201d stock and has plenty of collagen.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Sub Dry Sherry Wine for white wine, or Madeira wine.*\n\n*\\*\\*\\*\\*Whole ham bones are optional, but do make a big difference in the soups flavor. Ask your butcher for leftover bones, or sub out for a smoked ham hock.*\n\n**Split Pea Soup Technique:**\n\n1. Start the ham bone. Roast the ham bone in a 500F oven until charred and roasty. About 10-15 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.\n2. Add butter to dutch oven, season and sweat mirepoix and garlic until onions and celery are translucent. About 10 minutes.\n3. Deglaze dutch oven with wine, cook off the wine until the wine reduces by half. About 4 minutes.\n4. Add dried split peas to dutch oven along with thyme and bay leaves. Season with black pepper and mix.\n5. Add the chicken stock and roasted ham bones if using. Simmer the soup, uncovered for 1 hour and 45 mins.\n   1. Be careful when seasoning, the soup will reduce and the ham is already pretty salty.\n   2. Over time the split peas will fall apart giving the soup its classic, thick split pea look.\n6. Add the ham pieces and continue simmering for another 15 minutes.\n7. After two hours, remove the soup from the heat and let cool. Serve with creme fraiche, crusty bread, and more ham pieces if you\u2019re feeling like a big boy.\n8. Split pea soup can be kept in the fridge for 3 or 4 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.\n\n**Split Pea Soup (with Home-cured Ham) -** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlXGHJWKlYI&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "created_utc": 1610556244.0, "score": 34, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/kwk9uh/split_pea_soup_with_homecured_ham/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Great job!

{"title": "App to track you pantry / food inventory?", "selftext": "Hello /r/FromScratch ! I am a senior Computer Information Systems student and would love your help designing an app!  \n&nbsp;  \nThe basis of the app is to track the amount of food you have on hand and optionally, the price you paid for that food. I believe that this app could be extremely useful for making things from scratch because it would allow you to be at the store and know what you have already in the house. Potentially saving you money and allowing you to make more items from scratch. What I am looking for is your feedback in the form of a really quick survey about what you would like to see in an app like this. Or, if it even useful at all to you. (Any feedback is welcome!) I also encourage you to comment below, I will be very active with replying to any feedback, questions, etc. The survey is 100% anonymous, unless you enter your email for the mailing list.  \n&nbsp;  \n**If you're already interested, here is the survey:** https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvLGR6fAoJOo1FHG9v6hsXZjP4GBPTQ3liK3pibff9LpZwqQ/viewform  \nBelow is more information about the app and the philosophy behind it.  \n&nbsp;  \n**My philosophy for this apps progress:**\n\n&nbsp;  \n1) **Make your life better, not hinder it**. The first question that comes to people's mind is, \"How will I update my pantry of food?\" \n\nMy current ideas for this are:\n\n- Manually, as you eat the food subtract it from your inventory\n\n- As you add items to a shopping list the app prompts for an updated inventory quantity\n\n- When you scan a receipt in, it asks for updated quantities of matching receipts/inventory items\n\nIf you have an idea for this please feel free to comment here or add it to the survey!\n\n&nbsp;  \n2) **Design.** I will be sticking to the full slate of design standards for the operating system that the app is on. Whether that be Android, iOS, or desktop, my goal is to make this app look appealing and seamless ad well as efficient.\n\n&nbsp;  \n3) **No ads. No pay walls for main features**. I am not going into this app looking for money. I am trying to solve a problem that I have in my everyday life (more on that later.) I would rather have a beautifully designed app that everyone uses for free rather than a beautifully designed app that no one uses because it costs too much money. Now, this isn't a guarantee that there won't be some kind of payment in the future. Servers do cost money (if the app ever needed them) but the core features of this app, tracking food inventory, will always be free to use, and ad-free.\n\n&nbsp;  \nIf this is something you're interested in please fill the survey out where you can input your email to get more information as it becomes available!\n\nThanks for your time!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "created_utc": 1487867741.0, "score": 31, "author": "klutch2013", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/5vre57/app_to_track_you_pantry_food_inventory/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I work for a brewery and this kind of reminds me of the inventory management software we use called Orchestrated Beer.

It is really important to get thick layers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecipe :\n\nCookie layer :\n\n\\- 240gr choco chips\n\n\\- 420gr flour\n\n\\- 340gr butter\n\n\\- 3 eggs\n\n\\- 200gr brown sugar\n\n\\- 200gr white sugar\n\nMelt the butter and add it to a bowl. Add the white+brown sugar to it, give it a good mix, until combined nicely. Add some vanilla essence depending on your taste, 3 eggs and mix it again. Make sure the butter is not hot, we don't want to cook the eggs.\n\nAdd the flour, pinch of salt and mix it. Scrape the edges mix, add chocolate chips and mix it again with the hand mixer or spatula. Rest in the fridge for half an hour to 1 hour.\n\nOreos for Oreo layer.\n\nBrownie layer:\n\n\\- 225gr butter\n\n\\- 350gr melted chocolate\n\n\\- 4 eggs\n\n\\- 200gr white sugar\n\n\\- 200gr brown sugar\n\n\\- 90gr flour\n\n\\- 50gr cacao\n\nOn top of 4 eggs, add white and brown sugar give it a mix. Melt the butter, make sure is hot, and add the chocolate in it. Make sure you cut your chocolate as small as you can. After you put the chocolate in the hot butter, cover it with a plate for around 1 minute. Not more than 1 minute. Then take a spatula and mix slowly. It should melt pretty easy and combine nicely.\n\nAlso make sure to have the chocolate around room temp and not cold from the fridge. Now on that mixture of eggs + sugar, add some vanilla and pistachio or almond essence, and the melted chocolate with the butter. Give it a mix, add your flour and cocoa powder and mix it again.\n\nAlign a baking sheet on your baking pan that's already greased with the non stick spray or a little butter. You do this if you want nice edges, it helps the baking sheet to stick better to the pan. Add the cookie mixture first, use a spatula to even it out on the pan, add Oreos on top of it, and then add the brownie mixture.\n\nCook for around 50 minutes at 180 degree Celsius without fan. NO MORE THAN 50 minutes.\n\nYou can't do any test to be sure if this is cooked trough or not. At any time you gonna try to put a toothpick in it to check it is gonna come out with a lot of melted chocolate on it. If the top started to crack that means is cooked. And don't worry, the brownie layer will be fudgy and not cakey or overcooked. At least mine wasn't overcooked.\n\nThe most important thing is to let this rest overnight. I didn't and when I cut into it, I still had melted chocolate. But the next day, it was the most beautiful cake thingy that I made. Is really great if you eat it out of the fridge. Is way better when is cold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI topped mine with some vanilla ice cream with stracciatella, and caramel of course.

I tried about 10 different recipes people sent to me and they were helpful, but I felt like they never quite reached the texture I wanted.\n\nMy family got me modern cuisine at home for my birthday and I have used it off and on with great success. However, the best thing it's given me so far is the nicest pizza dough ever. It's perfect chewiness and amazing flavor.\n\nI've been reading a food science book as well that has helped me learn that certain brands and certain types of materials matter in cooking. \n\nHere is the recipe I used.

Rest for 10 minutes at room temp and mix 5 more minutes. Cut into 2,3,4 smaller sections. Stretch for about 30 seconds and roll into nice round ball. Use grape seed oil to lightly oil a bowl, put the dough inside and flip over so both sides are oiled. Put a plastic wrap overtop and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or best off do it for 1 day. \n\nMake sure to take out 1 hour ahead of time. Heat up oven to 500 degrees and heat up pizza stone inside. Transfer pizza and cook for 4-8 minutes depending on size.\n\nEnjoy! As a note I used olive oil on the crust (Partana extra virgin).

{"title": "Home-Cured Corned Beef (for St. Patrick's Day)", "selftext": "When I think of corned beef the first thing I think of is a corned beef deli sandwich. Rye bread stacked high with corned beef, some grainy mustard and melted cheese... it's a glorious thing. Not until this year did I ever question how corned beef was made, but I'm glad I did. It turns out that making corned beef at home is pretty easy, all it takes is a bit of simple math and some patience.\n\nAfter some testing, I've come up on what I believe to be a pretty decent spice blend, cure ratio and end result and I'm stoked to share it with you all. Below you'll find the measurements and technique to make your own corned beef, from the ground up. For my visual people, I've also included a link to a cook-along video. Let me know if you have any questions here in the comments, I'm happy to help if I can. Good luck.\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 8-10 lb Beef Brisket \u201cflat\u201d, trimmed\n* Curing Salts (see below)\n* Corned Beef Spice Blend:\n* 3/ 4 cup Coriander (60g)\n* 3/ 4 cup Black Pepper (100g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Caraway Seed (25g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Brown Mustard Seed (50g)\n* 1/ 3 cup Star Anise (30g)\n* 1/ 4 cup Whole Mace (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Clove (15g)\n* 2 tbsp Allspice Berries (10g)\n* 2 tbsp Juniper Berry (10g)\n* 1.5 tbsp Chili Flake (15g)\n* 5 Fresh Bay Leaves (2 dry)\n* 1 Cinnamon stick (2.5g)\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\n1. Weight out spices, toast over low heat, then transfer to a mortar and pestle to crush. Remove half of the spice blend and set aside until we\u2019re ready to cook.\n2. Fill large container with water, take the waters weight, then add 5% salt and 3% brown sugar to it. Then add half the spice blend and stir until mixed well. Finally, add brisket and submerge. Use a ceramic bowl or non-reactive, food-safe thing to weigh the brisket down. Cover and label. Let sit in the fridge for 7-10 days, flipping the meat and stirring once daily.\n3. After 7-10 days remove corned beef from brine, rinse under running water. Discard brine. \n4. Place the brisket in a large pot, and pour in enough water to cover by a couple inches. Blanch meat for 5-10 minutes and skim off the scum that rises to the top.\n5. Once most of the scum is gone, add the remaining spice mix, crushed garlic and ginger then bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook, covered for 3-4 hours or until the brisket is fork tender. \n6. Towards the end, around hour 3 of the cooking process, add in red potatoes, carrots and cabbage then cover and simmer until tender, about 30-45 minutes.\n7. If the veggies finish cooking before the brisket, remove them and set aside until ready to serve.\n8. Once the beef is easily pierce-able with a knife, remove it from the pot and set it out on a sheet tray to cool slightly. \n9. Slice corned beef against the grain, on the bias. Serve with grainy mustard or mustard vinaigrette, the boiled vegetables from earlier, and dark beer.\n\n**TO MEASURE SALTS AND SUGAR...**\n\n* 5% Kosher Salt (of water weight) =\n   * (.05) \\* Water Weight in grams = Kosher Salt needed\n* 3% Brown Sugar (of water weight) =\n   * (.03) \\* Water Weight in grams = Sugar needed\n* Pink Salt should equal .50% of the total weight of the meat\u2026\n   * My brisket = 8lb = 3624g\u2026\n   * ...pink salt (.005)\\*3624 = 18.12g\n\n***How to Make Home-Cured Corned Beef -*** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc\\_IVKvddPM&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc_IVKvddPM&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "created_utc": 1614795698.0, "score": 23, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/lx0mqw/homecured_corned_beef_for_st_patricks_day/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I'm an old timer at corned beef.  I want to pass on some tips for you and everyone.  \n\n I don't have room in my fridge for this.  So I dry-brine it.  The cherry on top is that dry-brining produces a better product than wet-brining. I've been doing it this way for ... um, almost 30 years, ever since Saint Julia taught it to  me in The Way To Cook.  I changed it up a little bit because her method used salt, no Prague powder (pink salt) in sight. You can totally cure with just salt but it  produces a very salty product, even after three days desalting in fresh water.   It also turns an unappetizing gray, none of that pink that you see in products cured with Prague powder.  \n\n\nI add the Prague powder to the salt and spice mix (you should try adding ground ginger to your mix!) then rub it into the beef.  Vacuum seal and into the fridge it goes.  If you don't have a vacuum sealer, put it in a zipper bag, and remove as much air as you can.  I was always able to pretty well suck it out using my mouth, or you can hold the corners and dunk it into a pot of water just up to the zipper. In either case, within a day you'll see the beef exuding juice. Once or twice a day give it a good massage (in the bag) and turn it over.  \n\nNote: the pink salt called for here is _not_ Himalayan pink salt (which is essentially regular old salt) but pink _curing_ salt.  It's also known as Prague Powder #1, tinted cure, pink curing salt, quick cure salt, curing salt #1, and Instacure #1.  \n\nYou can get a more tender product by cooking sous vide at 180&deg;F for 10 hours, or by doing it in a Dutch oven in the oven.  After rinsing off the spices,  preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F. Put the brisket in a large Dutch oven, cover  it with water by an inch or three, and bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from heat, cover with lid slightly ajar, place in oven, and cook until completely tender, about 10 hours.", "I\u2019ve made one every year for the past few. So much better. I did it with venison too. I highly recommend pressure cooking the corned beef. Fast and sooo tender. Nice recipe! Thanks for sharing the love of home made corned beef!", "That's a lot of pink salt, more than double what I generally use. You're also then mixing it into the water after, diluting the amount you've measured. You've got the opposite going on by measuring salt based on water weight then adding the meat.\n\nYou'll get a lot more consistent (and safe!) product if you measure based on wholes and not just parts. Dry brining, as someone mentioned already, is much easier for measuring salt contents and avoids the issue all together.", "ive been sharing this link ravenously the past few months given that home-curing meat seems to be all the rage lately. It takes a very scientific and exact approach to curing meat safely.\n\nMain takeaway   \n\"I like to say there should be no rules in the bedroom or kitchen. The exception is curing meats. The rules for this process are rigid.\"\n\nThere are a lot of variables that affect how much curing salt to use and how long meat needs to be cured. Mainly the weight, thickness, and shape of the cut of meat. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/salting-brining-curing-and-injecting/curing-meats-safely](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/salting-brining-curing-and-injecting/curing-meats-safely)"]}

I learned to cook as a skivvy in an Indian takeaway, and my approach to cookery generally goes \"some of that, a lot of this, a bit of the other\" so I can't give you precise quantities\n\n**Spices**\n\n*Garam massala* - this is a mixture of 8 to 15 spices depending on the specific blend (although there are a number of spices that are pretty much a given and I can't remember what they are), and traditionally is a family secret passed down mother to daughter. Presuming your mother hasn't taught you to make it (nor your ex-boss' wife) just buy some. You will want more of this than any other single spice - for three or four people I probably go with about a tablespoon of this and a teaspoon or so of most other things. \n\n*Turmeric* (aka Haldi) - bright yellow and stains *everything*! I seem to remember reading that it had one of the highest densities of natural pigment of any plant! Also supposedly antiseptic\n\n*Cumin* (aka Jeera) - long thin seeds. \n\n*Curry leaves* - surprisingly aromatic and tasty. Also very god for your digestion, apparently.\n\n*Ginger* - Fresh is best for flavour, dried has more heat. I have been known to use both. Generally good for what ails you. \n\n*Garlic* - my fianc\u00e9e is allergic to it so I don't generally use it. Good for your heart (but not the rest of you if you're allergic)\n\n*Chilli* - there are a myriad of types, all slightly different. I generally just used flaked or powdered dried ones because they keep better than fresh and I rarely want much heat. \n\n*Paprika* - tastes much like chilli but not hot\n\n*Black mustard seeds* - these are not the same as yellow or brown mustard seeds, and certainly not the same as prepared mustard! \n\n*Black pepper* - fresh ground, of course. I love the stuff. \n\nCinnamon, cloves, cardamom and just about anything else you have in the spice cupboard can be good too, depending on what you feel like.\n\nIn terms of **herbs** I generally go for coriander (aka cilantro) and/or fenugreek (aka methi)\n\nA friend of mine who spent a years in southern India said she was taught to use the first three, and then possibly others to taste, depending on what you are making. \n\n**Other ingredients**\n\nOnions (lots - about one small to medium per person depending on how hungry they are)\n\nTomato (fresh, tinned, or as passata. It's all good)\n\nRoot vegetables (carrot, potato, probably others too if you want)\n\nOther vegetables (capsicums, mushrooms, more onion or (fresh) tomato, whatever else is on hand) \n\nMeat (chicken is good - thighs are tasty and often cheaper than breasts. lamb. Beef or pork are less common but no reason you couldn't so long as you're not Hindu or Muslim. Never tried goat! Fish (various sorts) can be good). Obviously you will have to adjust the spices a bit to cater t the meat - lamb or pork would probably want something a bit sweeter, beef probably wants more robust flavours, fish probably wants some lemon - surprisingly most fish can take a lot of chilli before being drowned out. \n\n**Method**\n\nFinely chop your onions, and prepare everything else into bite-sized pieces. Set your rice soaking if it needs it. \n\nPut a little oil in a pan and chuck in whatever spices you are using. Cook until the cumin and/or black mustard seeds start to pop (usually a few seconds) then add all the chopped onion\n\nOnce the onion is translucent add the meat (unless it's fish or you're not using any)\n\nOnce the meat is looking a little less raw and the onions are maybe a little golden, add the tomato an the root vegetables. If using dried herbs add them now too. \n\nWhen they are almost tender add the other, quicker cooking vegetables (and probably any fish). Adjust seasoning to taste\n\nSimmer until everything is cooked. Serve with rice (I like it cooked with cardamom and bay leaf, maybe cloves), naan bread, and/or chappattis/parathas. Or smear it on your cat if you're weird, I suppose.\n\nThat's it. It usually takes me about an hour, all told. Sometimes I like to make it really mild and add cream, coconut and almonds and call it a korma because that's my fianc\u00e9e's favourite when we order in. Other times I coarsely chop the onion and add loads of capsicum and fresh chili and call it a jalfrezi (my spell checker wants me to call it Alfred. Alfred curry sounds nice). Not infrequently I will leave out most of the tomato then add rice and enough stock to cook the rice, and call it a pilaf. Experiment with it, have fun with it, make it your own. \n\nWow - that got a bit long! It's probably telling that the section on spices is about as long a the rest of the post put together, though!

Optional: Wrap up the whole spices (cardamom, bay leaves, cloves, peppercorns) in a piece of muslin or cheesecloth, and tie it securely with thread. Once the curry is done you can remove this.

Add 1 tbsp of yoghurt to the meat, stir, and cook it for a minute until it's incorporated. Repeat, adding the yoghurt 1 tbsp at a time, until it's all in.\n\n7. Cover the pot and turn the heat down very low. Simmer for 2-3 hours until the meat is tender, stirring every 30 minutes or so to prevent it from catching on the base and burning. When it's ready, you should be able to push a piece of meat against the inside of the pot with the spoon and have it start to break apart.\n\n8. Stir in the garam masala. Add the spinach and another 1 tsp of salt, and stir. Fresh spinach will take a couple of minutes of stirring to wilt down into the curry.

I've tried so many pasta recipes over the last couple of months and I always seem to get it wrong. The dough is too wet, the dough is too dry,the herbs I added weren't chopped finely enough so the pasta fell apart, I forgot about it after covering it and then remembered that the dough was still resting a day and a half later...  \n  \nSeveral little disasters that culminated in no confidence in my own pasta making ability.  \n  \nThis recipe calls for a food processor. Put in the flour and the egg and a bit and, to use the technical term, whizz it until it looks like fine breadcrumbs. But not dusty ones. I kinda wish I took pics here to illustrate this but give it a go and you'll hopefully see what I mean. (Let me know if you need to see pics to know what I mean though, I'm making this again this week for a birthday dinner for a friend) At this point you're supposed to pour said crumbs onto the counter, mush them together and knead with all of your might for a minute or two. The dough is really stiff so this is a difficult endeavour. I scooped the crumbs back into the processor and added a splash of olive oil, whizzed it again and then tried to knead this bad boy.  \n  \nKneading was hard.  \n  \nIf I'm being honest.... I might have wielded a rolling pin and hammered at the dough like it was something I was trying to kill. I'm usually a good kneader but with this I just folded and thumped a few times. (not unlike... http://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll43/myknsj/Movies/th_shaun.gif)   \n  \nLeave it to rest for an hour (after a beating like that, it was the least I could do for it.) Recipe advises a cling wrapping while resting, I treated it to a ziploc bag.  \n  \nSo an hour later I was on the other side of town, living it up, as one does. I got home too late to bother making pasta so I put my rested dough into the fridge overnight. and then over another night because I went to my friend's place last night to watch TV. Then today when I got home from my German lessons I decided to throw away the dough but something stopped me at the last minute. Mostly the desire to use my pasta machine. It's almost theraputic. Grown up, edible playdoh.  \n  \nThe dough is much softer after having a rest, though I would recommend the hour rather than a couple of days. It only needs a bit of a rest for the gluten to get all loose and ready to party.  \n  \n  \nThis pasta is surprisingly tasty given the level of abandonment applied. I'm having it with olive oil, lemon and loads of black pepper. Nyom. ", "If you can weigh the amount of egg you intend to use you will have better luck in the long term.

You want it to be hard-ish to knead before the rest. I usually don't do too much kneading and opt for a longer rest (it does the same thing, hydrating the flour and building the gluten chains), but more kneading means faster pasta. \n\nI've been working on hand pulled noodles recently too!

{"title": "Homemade Lasagna with Bolognese", "selftext": "Lasagna is a classic dish that can tell you a lot about a cook. There are dozens of ways to make the Italian classic... from utilizing different pasta types to adding all sorts of vegetables, or simply opting for a ragu of sorts and cheese. Making lasagna from scratch calls to a cooks ability to make a decent ragu (meat sauce), make homemade pasta sheets, and, if one opts for it, getting creative with the way the \"casserole\" is layered.\n\nBelow is my adaptation on a \"classic\" lasagna. If you want to have a whack at making it, I've left the technique and measurement list (in both weights and Imperial). I'll also go ahead and link to a video that I created for those of you who prefer something visual. I spent a lot of time on this, so I hope it helps you save some of your own! Let me know if you have any questions. Good luck!\n\n**RECIPE** (Serves 8...)\n\nFor Lasagna\u2026\n\n* 5.5 cups (200g) Parmigiano Reggiano\n* 1.5 cups (80g) Low-Moisture, full-fat Mozzarella\n* Fresh Basil and/or Parsley TT - garnish\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n* 4 cups (510g) Type \u201c00\u201d Flour\n* 4 (230g) Whole Eggs\n* 5 (90g) Egg Yolks\n\nBechamel (\u201cbesciamella\u201d)\u2026\n\n* 2 tbsp (30g) Butter\n* 3 tbsp (30g) Flour\n* 2 cups (474ml) Whole Milk\n* 1 cup (25g) Parmigiano Reggiano, grated\n* Ground Nutmeg TT\n* Salt & Pepper TT\n\nItalian Sausage Ragu \u201cBolognese\u201d...\n\n(Makes 10-12 servings)\n\n* 4 tbsp (60g) Butter\n* 1lb (454g) Italian Pork Sausage\n* 1lb (454g) Ground Beef Chuck\n* 1 large Onion/ 1.5 cups (320g)\n* 3 large Ribs Celery/ 1 cup (100g)\n* 2 large Carrots/ 1 cup (125g)\n* 5 cloves of garlic, minced (8g)\n* 28oz can San Marzano tomatoes (828ml)\n* 1.5 cups White Wine (355ml)\n* 2 cups Whole Milk (474ml)\n* 2 cups Veal or Beef Stock (474ml)\n* Herb Sachet - Fresh Thyme, Oregano, Bay leaf\n* Chili Flakes TT\n* Fish Sauce TT\n* (optional) Rinds from Parmigiano Reggiano TT\n\nTT= to taste\n\n\\*This recipe makes more Ragu than you\u2019re going to need for the lasagna. The ragu freezes well and will stay fresh for 3-5 months in the freezer.\n\n\\*\\*You could end up with extra pasta sheets, too. It\u2019s better to have some left over, then to be short on sheets. If you have leftover, cut the sheets into any shape you want and chill in an air-tight container. Boom. Fresh pasta for later in the week.\n\n**TECHNIQUE:**\n\nFresh Pasta Sheets\u2026\n\n1. Make a mound with the flour and use your fingers to create a well.\n2. Drop the whole eggs and egg yolks in the middle, whisk with a fork, and slowly begin collapsing in flour into the beaten egg and egg yolk mixture.\n3. Once the eggs have been worked into the flour, drop the fork and begin kneading by hand.\n4. Knead for 5-10 minutes, or until the dough is smoothed out.  \n\n   1. Add in a sprinkle or two of water if the dough is looking a bit dry.\n5. Wrap in plastic and set aside. Let rest for 30 minutes.  \n\n   1. Allowing the dough the time to rest will make it more supple, and easier to work with. If you don\u2019t let it rest, it will remain hard to roll out and pull back on you.\n6. Flour a sheet tray heavily and set it aside at the ready.\n7. After 30 minutes remove the plastic from the pasta and portion out into 4 quarters.\n8. Grab one quarter from the bunch, and cover the remaining pasta chunks with the plastic wrap so that they don\u2019t dry out.\n9. Form the pasta chunk into a 5-6 inch circle, dust with flour, then run the dough through the pasta machine starting at width 0.\n10. After the first pass, fold the two ends over each other, and run it through again. Repeat one or two more times.\n11. One the sheet is flat and even, increase the pasta machine width to setting 1, flour the dough again, then run the dough through. Repeat this process working your way up to setting 6.\n12. You should be able to see the silhouette of your hand through the dough.\n13. Skimping on flouring the pasta dough as you run it through the machine could lead you to torn pasta sheets. Flour is important.\n14. Place the WELL FLOURED pasta sheets back onto a sheet tray as you work.\n15. Once the pasta sheet are rolled out, portion the sheets into 13 inch long pieces (big enough to fit in your cooking vessel), flour, and set aside again.\n16. Cook the sheets in well-seasoned water for 30-45 seconds, or until just cooked but still al dente.\n17. As the sheets finish cooking, place them on the rack and sprinkle with oil to avoid sticking and overlap.\n18. Do this step lastly, right before you\u2019re ready to build the lasagne.\n\nRagu Bolognese\u2026\n\n1. Form ground meat into sausage patties, season with salt, and brown in a dutch oven, Once browned, reserve on a plate.\n2. Drain a bit of the excess fat from the dutch oven, melt the butter then add in your carrots, celery, onion and garlic. Cook the veg down for 5-10 minutes.\n3. Add the reserved browned ground meat back into the dutch oven and crumble using the back of a wooden spoon or something similar.\n4. Once the veg and meat mixture is crumbled, deglaze the bottom of the pan with the white wine, scraping all the brown bits off the bottom of the dutch oven. Cook the mixture on high heat until the wine reduces by nearly half. 7-8 minutes.\n5. Once the wine is reduced, add the milk. Again, cook over high heat until the milk is near fully reduced, another 10 minutes or so.\n6. Once the mixture is almost dry, pour in the San Marzano tomatoes and veal stock and stir until combined.\n7. Finally, add in the herb sachet, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2-4 hours.  \n\n   1. The longer its simmered, the more flavorful it will be.\n8. After time simmering, optionally pulse the bolognese with an immersion blender to get a smooth yet textured consistency.  \n\n   1. The bolognese will be significantly reduced after simmering for so long. Feel free to add in more stock or water for a looser consistency. I prefer to leave mine reduced for a chunkier sauce.\n   2. Control the finally consistency of your ragu by pulsing it as much or as little as you like with an immersion blender.\n   3. The immersion blender allows texture control, but also helps emulsify some of the fat in the sauce into the liquid giving a gorgeous light orangish-brown color to the ragu.\n9. Once the desired consistency is achieved, season the sauce with fish sauce, salt, and pepper TT, put the lid on the dutch oven, and set aside.\n\nBechamel...\n\n1. Add butter and flour to a medium saucepan and cook for 5 minutes, or until the roux smells like pie crust - Chef John.\n2. Slowly whisk in COLD milk (no lumps), then grate in nutmeg, salt and pepper TT. Optionally add a bit of parm to the bechamel (technically making it into a mornay sauce.)\n3. Bring the mixture up to a boil, then cut the heat. When the Roux begins to bubble is when it\u2019s at its maximum thickening power. If your roux looks too thin, start over.\n4. Let cool for a few minutes, then lay some plastic wrap over the top of the bechamel and cover with a lid so a skin doesn\u2019t form, set it aside.\n\nTo assemble Lasagne\u2026\n\n1. Lay down a bit of bolognese and bechamel then the first layer of pasta.\n2. Lay down another layer of bolognese, bechamel, AND parmesan cheese. Finish with more pasta sheets to cover. Rinse and repeat.  \n\n   1. You should still be able to see the bottom pasta sheet once the bolognese is ladeled in, don\u2019t overdo the sauces in each layer.\n3. Finish the lasagne by pulling over two of the sheets to form a \u201cbowl\u201d then lay on the remaining bechamel sauce, a dollop of red sauce (mostly for color) and a little more parm.\n4. Cover with parchment paper, then tin foil and bake at 400F for 35 minutes.\n5. After 35 minutes, remove the parchment and foil, sprinkle on the mozzarella cheese and broil for 5-10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and browned.\n6. Let rest for AT LEAST 30 minutes before slicing and serving.  \n\n   1. If you cut into the lasagne early, it\u2019ll still taste great\u2026 but you might get 3rd degree burns on the roof of your mouth and it could fall apart on you making all the layer work you just did worthless. Butttt it\u2019s your call, I won\u2019t get between a hungry human and a lasagne.\n7. Garnish with chopped parsley and basil.\n\n**A Guide to Homemade Lasagna (from scratch)** \\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab\\_channel=OmnivorousAdam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKEnChTVelQ&t=34s&ab_channel=OmnivorousAdam)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "created_utc": 1611166989.0, "score": 21, "author": "HoardingBotanist", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fromscratch/comments/l1f1fp/homemade_lasagna_with_bolognese/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Hi!

I guess the right place to start is - exactly what you're doing. Instead of automatically buying something that's pre-made, think \"can I make this myself?\" Some things you won't be able to, or won't want to, but most you can. Maybe do this before you go to the supermarket - write your shopping list and then think about which of the things you could make from scratch. Then look up recipes - if you have specific meals in mind I can suggest some better websites to get recipes from. Stocking your pantry can be expensive so it might be worth weaning yourself on - as in, not picking 7 meals that need drastically different ingredients.\n\n2. As mentioned in another comment, my husband and I cook probably 95% from scratch. E.g. I do ALL our baking, we both make bread, husband makes pasta. I make some cheeses. I think it would be pretty easy to get to 75%, then it gets a bit tricker to get up from there and you need more time on your hands.\n\n3. Tips - as mentioned above, every time you buy something just think \"can I make this from scratch?\". Learn some basic sauces - a good roux sauce will be useful in SO many means (e.g. macaronic and cheese, lasagne, vegetables bakes, etc). Get some nice knives and a wooden chopping board so chopping isn't a chore (if you're interested, I watched [this free Craftsy course on knife skills](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=565391&u=946228&m=29190&urllink=&afftrack=)* yesterday and really enjoyed it.

And there are some really easy, really delicious recipes in there (as well as more difficult ones) - for example try the [carnita's](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/07/no-waste-tacos-de-carnitas-with-salsa-verde-recipe.html).

With flour, water, and a bit of technique, you can make *so many* different things and homemade tortillas or dumplings or pierogis or pastas or whatever are all way better than the packaged equivalent. Start adding yeast and sugar or baking soda or eggs or different things like this and now you're talking buns, pizzas, pretzels, cakes, cookies, and so on. If you keep a bucket of AP around and know how to work it, you will never go hungry", "I was diagnosed with celiac disease when I was 11, so I've been cooking from scratch since then. I cook at least 75% from scratch without major efforts.  \n  \nWhere do you start? My advice is not to aim for 100% and make exceptions, as I believe that's a quick way to get burned out. Start instead at 0% and steadily increase to whatever point you're comfortable at. You got years to get this right, why try to fix it in weeks or months?  \n  \nI also recommend that you have specific reasons for why you choose to make something from scratch. Reasons can include cost, taste, nutritional value, allergens, complexity (or lack thereof), quality etc. Just because you can make something from scratch, doesn't mean you should, and I believe that focusing on items that have one or more significant improvements in categories like those I just listed will better give you a drive to continue and improve. The mashed potatoes you mentioned is a good example. Home made mashed potatoes can easily taste better, and have definitively a much more satisfying texture (unless you make potato puree), has probably a slightly lower cost, and while more advanced than microwave cooking, is still close to being as easy as it gets in the kitchen. Boil mealy potatoes, drain water, add deary, fat and salt, mash, rest, serve, and you've improved your dinner in a tangible way. And from there, the experimentation starts: For me, nutmeg is a requirement in mashed potatoes, and I like big chunks of potato in the mash. A bit cinnamon in the mash fits well with fired pork, a bit of coarse pepper gives it a bite, as do fresh chives. Adding a carrot, some rutabaga or sweet potato to the mash sweetens the flavor and adds some color, and doesn't otherwise change or complicate the recipe. On the other hand, there are items that **generally** (**generally!**) aren't worth making from scratch where the result is close to a store bought alternative in all the aforementioned categories. For me (and again, **generally**), something like orange juice can easily be placed in this category. The end product is basically identical (at least in my part of the word where \"juice\" is a legally defined word that requires 100% fruit), while increasing the cost, adding complexity, creating more discarded garbage etc.  \n  \nOnce you have control over the potatoes, pick some other part of a dish and master that. If something is too hard, too costly or too time consuming, go back to the store bought alternative and pick something else to replace. After a few months of cooking, retrying that failed dish might suddenly be a piece of cake.  \n  \n--  \n  \nI made butter chicken for breakfast this morning. I made it for the first time last Sunday and have now had it three times in eight days, and have made significant improvements in both ingredients, procedure and flavor/consistency on every iteration. From using almost two hours the first time, I'm now sure I can have it done with 20 minutes preparation and 30 minutes just sitting on the stove. Next up is a trip to a local Indian restaurant to compare my results to their. Perhaps I'll then modify my procedures or ingredients and make another iteration, or perhaps I'll conclude it's as good as it gets and move to some other dish.", "Everything we make is from the ground up. We dont eat anything processed. Yes it takes a bit longer and we have to keep a lot more ingredients around but it is very satisfying. I enjoy cooking as a hobby so the process gives me fulfillment as well. \n\nJust start cooking and anytime you come across something that you are buying in a package ask \"can I make this myself\" and hit the Google. For instance, let's make a pie. So the crust, got one of those rolled up things from the freezer section, wait this is just dough. Google some recipes and you will find it is just a couple ingredients. It takes some practice but it is not bad. Ok filling, got some cans, wait, let me get some fresh apples, and slice them up and get some fresh cinnamon and sugar etc. Just break everything down into parts and you will start to see how it could be made by you rather than a factory with a bunch of fillers and low quality ingredients. *Do not be afraid to fail!* You will not have 100% success rate. *That is OK!* just learn and try again. \n\nGenerally speaking you should be shopping from the perimeter of the super market. The fresh produce, meats, etc. Most of the isles are prepackaged food. Save for things like flour sugar and spices. Get the best ingredients you can. ", "I think a great place to start is with recipes from either of Gordon Ramsay's home cooking series - 'Ultimate Cookery Course' or 'Ultimate Home Cooking'. A lot of the recipes are on his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/gordonramsay). Everything he makes is from scratch and he makes it so easy to understand and enjoyable to watch. \nThe more you cook from scratch, the more you start to enjoy the actual process of cooking rather than the end result. It becomes a hobby so yes it's almost a natural progression that you could have 75% of your meals being made from scratch. Best of luck :)", "Every time you make a dish, make one extra component of it from scratch - like, say you're doing lasagne with garlic bread and a salad. Start with the simple things (pasta sauce, vinagrette,  even just shredding or mixing your own lettuce blend instead of buying premade packs, croutons) and then go more complex (ricotta, lasagne sheets, mozzarella, feta for salad.)\n\nAlso look for recipes that make multi-use foods you eat often (think granola,  stock, pasta sauce, soup mix, caramels, jam, crackers, even condiments) so that you eventually can wean yourself off buying them.\n\nThe only foods I've ever eaten that I think one couldn't create at home are Marmite and certain cereals (fruit loops, I'm looking at you.) The homemade version might taste different, but IMO it's almost always better :)\n\nHappy DIY-ing, and if you'd like a recipe on anything odd (marshmallows, condiments, and grenadine come to mind) do let me know!"]}

{"title": "Simple Brown Veal Stock (with How-to video)", "selftext": "What's up everyone,\n\nHave you ever wondered how to make homemade stock, or have you made your own in the past?\n\nHomemade stock is worlds better/cheaper than store-bought stuff. Keeping a freezer with homemade stock reserves on deck is a surefire way to elevate your cooking at home - think restaurant quality soups, braises, flavor-packed grain dishes or reduction sauces and more. \n\nStock making is a staple, straight-forward technique that every passionate cook should be familiar with (even if you're ballin' on a budget.) The written recipe and notes are listed below. However if you're more of a visual learner I recommend checking out the video here -[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql5ibIUYiWQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrown veal stock is simply a liquid made by slowly simmering ingredients in water and extracting flavors into liquid form. Stock is a powerful flavor base that has a load of different functions in the kitchen. I don\u2019t know many things\u2026 but one thing that I do know for sure is that preparing your own stock with vegetables, animal bones, and aromatics will not only teach you an important lesson in the kitchen, but it will also elevate whatever you usually cook with the store-bought stuff. \n\nThere are many different types of stocks from brown to white, fish to veal, but today we\u2019re going to focus in on, what I feel, is the most delicious and kitchen-life-changing: brown veal stock. To call a stock, \u201cbrown\u201d simply means that the animal bones and vegetables are roasted/charred in a hot oven before they are simmered; also a tomato product such as tomato paste is generally added for acidity, sweetness, and color (though not always.) A \u201cwhite\u201d stock simply means that the stock ingredients are not roasted before they are simmered - no color, in most cases, means less flavor. So for the sake of running through a stock-making technique, I wanted to focus on one that achieves deep flavor - brown veal stock. \n\nI\u2019m going to explain my method below. But be sure to read the extra \u201cImportant Notes\u201d at the bottom of the page. Whatever I didn\u2019t cover in the method or video will be listed down there. Let\u2019s get to it... \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 10 lbs veal bones (try and find knuckle bones)   \n \n* 3 oz (\u00bd cup) grapeseed oil (or any high-heat, neutral cooking oil)   \n \n* 1 lbs onions (4-5 medium), I like to use yellow but use what\u2019s on hand   \n \n* 8 oz carrots (1.5 large), chopped with skin on   \n \n* 8 oz celery (4-6 stalks), chopped   \n \n* Tomato paste, 1 small can10 black peppercorns   \n \n* \u00bd bunch of parsley   \n \n* \u00bd bunch thyme   \n \n* 2-3 bay leaves   \n \n* 2-3 garlic cloves   \n \n* fresh water, to cover   \n \n* \u00bd cup dry red wine   \n \n\n**Method:** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Start by rubbing the veal bones with grapeseed oil. Some people scoff at using oil, but I find that it helps the bones achieve solid browning. Plus if you do a good job skimming, it\u2019s easy to deal with.   \n \n2. Next, roast in a pre-heated 500\u00b0F/260\u00b0C oven for 1 hour, or until they turn deep golden brown in color. Make sure to rotate the bones half way through to make sure things char evenly.   \n \n3. Meanwhile, prepare your Mirepoix like you did the bones, by rubbing the vegetables with oil. I don\u2019t like to peel my carrots or onions - the skin has a ton of flavor locked inside.   \n \n4. Once the time has passed, check on your bones, they should have some beautiful color. Remove them from the oven and rub with the tomato paste until covered, but not plastered on. You probably don\u2019t have to use the entire can of paste. Place the tomato covered bones back in oven for another 20-25 minutes until the tomato paste starts to caramelize.   \n \n5. To be efficient with your time, start roasting off your mirepoix with your tomato-smeared bones on a separate tray. Though they likely won\u2019t be finished at the same time as your bones, it\u2019s good to get things rolling.   \n \n6. Place bones in a large, heavy bottomed stockpot.   \n \n7. Place the tray used to roast our bones over the stove and heat over medium-high. Deglaze the pan with the red wine, or water and use a wooden spoon to scrape the crispy bits stuck to the tray. Technically these crispies are known as \u201cfond.\u201d Pour the wine and fond mixture into the stockpot with the bones.   \n \n8. By now, your mirepoix should be getting there. Once finished and charred, add the mirepoix to the stockpot.   \n \n9. Fill the stockpot with enough cold water to cover the bones by at least 2-3 inches. Using cold water encourages a clearer stock. If you don\u2019t care about the clarity, use warm or hot water. Just make sure the water you\u2019re using is high-quality and clean.   \n \n10. Once hot, add the peppercorns, parsley, thyme, garlic and bay leaf. Some people like to wrap these aromatics in cheese cloth with twine known as a \u201csachet\u201d, but I don\u2019t see a need to do so. We\u2019re going to strain everything out at the end, so it seems redundant to me. But if you want to wrap things up in a cute lil\u2019 bundle, please, be my guest.   \n \n11. Heat stock over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to low and maintain a slow simmer. Do not allow the stock to boil or it will emulsify the remaining fat from the bones and make things clouded. \\*See note for \u201cthe oven trick.\u201d   \n \n12. Simmer for 8-12 hours, skimming with a ladle as necessary. Skimming is VERY important and you can\u2019t forget to do it or else your stock will be a foggy, fatty, sloppy mess. To skim, simply dip a ladle in the stock and remove any built up protein particles, fat and other scum. I like to do this every hour at least once, but I might be a little obsessive. A cool hack that allows for easier skimming is to pull the stockpot halfway off the heat. The fat and scum will collect to one side in a cycle, making things easier to skim.   \n \n13. After the stock is finished, strain through a course strainer (\u201cchina cap\u201d) and then through a fine mesh strainer (\u201cchinois.\u201d) \\*See YouTube video for links to purchase the same gear I use in the video.   \n \n\n\\*\\*\\* If you don\u2019t plan to use the stock immediately, store in fridge for up to 5 days or freeze any leftover stock - it\u2019ll stay good for up to 3 months. I like to keep them in labeled deli containers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Important Notes:* \n\nSTOCK IS A FLAVOR BASE; stock is used to make other dishes and is often reduced down to concentrate flavor. This means that you shouldn\u2019t season it with salt at any step during the cooking process; also, refrain from using any strong/overpowering ingredients. Keep the stock pure so that flavors can be added as needed to create specific dishes/sauces - shoutout to all my people with commitment issues. \n\nBROTH vs. STOCK: Simply put, broth is made of meat and stock is made from bones. Broth is generally lighter whereas stock is rich and has more body (a heavier mouthfeel) due to the collagen in the bones which, throughout the cooking process, breaks down into gelatin. \n\nBONES. Speaking of collagen\u2026 I like to use knuckle bones for veal stock. Generally, knuckle bones have much more collagen ready to be unlocked into gelatin from within. Though I\u2019m not afraid to throw in some marrow bones and/or meat scraps in my stock pot along with the knuckle bones. When making poultry stock look for backs, wings and necks as these all contain a buttload of collagen, too. \n\n\u201cTHE OVEN TRICK\u201d - One way to keep your stove range free of clutter is to simmer stock in the oven. Simply set your oven to 200F (93c) and place your stock pot inside once all of your ingredients and water have been added. I\u2019ve made stock this way a few times, but there are pros and cons. A couple pros are that your kitchen has less clutter and your stove is free to cook other things on and you can leave the oven on through the night and simmer the stock for the 8-12 hours while you sleep. The cons are that it\u2019s sort of a pain in the ass to continuously move the stock pot from the oven to the stovetop to skim off the protein aggregates, fat and other scum. I typically make my stock the traditional way, on the stove, but the oven trick works, too. Play around with both techniques and see which you prefer. \n\nWHAT IS \u201cMIREPOIX?\u201d Mirepoix is just a fancy French word for a flavor base of carrots/celery and onion. The classic ratio is 2 parts onion: 1 part celery: 1 part carrots. A good rule of thumb is for every 5 pounds of bones, use 1 pound of mirepoix. \n\nUSE QUALITY WATER! If you live in a spot with hard water, or just bad water in general, use store-bought stuff either bottled or in the jug. Make sure to use cold water to start your stock if you want it to be clearer and less foggy - this won\u2019t affect the taste, however. \n\nAROMATICS. The aromatics that I like to use in my veal/beef stock include bay leaf, parsley, thyme, black peppercorns and garlic. The amount in which you use is all preference based. \n\n\u201cREDUCTION,\u201d is a technique used to reinforce flavor. Veal stock isn\u2019t always used as is, but is generally reduced by half with the addition of mirepoix and aromatics. This is done to concentrate flavor and provide a more viscous mouth feel (give the stock \u201cbody\u201d). Check out my \u201cEasy Pan Sauce\u201d video to see how I reduce veal stock into a yummy, complex steak sauce. \n\nWHITE STOCK vs. BROWN STOCK. To make a white veal stock, simply rinse the veal bones with cold water. Place the rinsed bones in your stockpot with cold water and bring to a simmer. After this blanching phase, pour off the water and keep the veal bones in the stockpot. Doing this will allow any protein particles and other scum to detach from the bones giving you a cleaner, more delicate stock. Once your bones are blanched, simply follow the steps in this recipe but skip over the pre-simmer roasting process for the animal bones and mirepoix. This same method can be used for poultry stocks, as well. Though, as I mentioned, I highly recommend making brown stock as they are MUCH MORE FLAVORFUL. If you\u2019re going to spend your hard earned cash on quality ingredients, wouldn\u2019t you want to conjure the tastiest stock?

Make a week menu, and stock for that. See what you like, what keeps well, what's not worth the effort (for you). \nAt the end of the week, look at what's left, and plan on using up the perishables in your next week's menu.

But I'm not a fan of frozen veggies. Eventually the meat/fruit/veg you have will be what you've processed while it's in season. So you'll be putting berries and stone fruit away right now. Apples in the fall...\n\nAlternatively (my most common situation) if you are freezer-free, you'd have canned/smoked/dried things as they are in abundance. In the fall I can tuna, in the summer I can salmon, pickles, salsa, sauces. \n\nAgain, it's a progression, that is ultimately determined by your likes/needs/abilities. \n\nHave fun with it :)", "Definitely flour, sugar, yeast, baking soda and baking powder, and spices! The types of spices will differ depending on what you are making. \n\nAs far as utensils, I would definitely recommend a food processor and a mixer (either hand or stand). The food processor allows you to make so many other ingredients (think breadcrumbs, or oat flour) that you may otherwise have to purchase. ", "My best from scratch tip for budget reasons would be to buy your flour in bulk and buy plain/all purpose flour.

Almost anything that comes from the inside aisles of the supermarket can be made from the things on the outside ailes, except, of course, the baking supplies/bulk goods (like beans and rice) aisles.  I still buy my Heinz ketchup and dijon mustart in jars, though.  I've not completely committed!", "Start with the \"why\" and that can dictate your next steps. If you're looking to eat healthier, start with the least healthy processed thing you currently eat. If you're looking to save money, start with the most expensive things... etc.\n\nThis is also highly dependent on what you eat already. Making your own salad dressing and soaking dried beans are two easy starting points another commenter already mentioned. But suggestions like that aren't going to help if, say, you're not a salad fan and you don't like beans. You have to give us something to go on here.\n\nAlso consider this is a spectrum, with an investment/reward tradeoff. It's impossible to make everything from scratch. Some things are worth it to make and some aren't. Churning your own butter or making soy sauce are things on my personal \"not worth the effort\" list.", "Quick pickles are easy to make and last a long time.  Various infused oils are good, especially if you like chinese food make some chili oil and scallion oil.  Ginger and garlic paste freezes very well.  Tortillas are easy to make if you have a press, which is cheap, but it takes some time to get the hang of it.  Stocks are easy to make and freeze well, and getting a whole chicken and breaking it down is usually cheaper than just buying parts of a chicken.  Only issue is if you need a lot of one particular part for something.  Learn how to do canning, especially if you grow any of your own food.  Pasta is another easy thing to make if you have a pasta roller, however note that dried pasta is a completely different food than fresh pasta so the way that dried pasta works in recipes is fundamentally different than fresh pasta and you need to know when it's ok to use which type of pasta.  Don't just think that fresh pasta is always better because that's not true at all.  Almost all pasta sauces are relatively easy to make but some just take a really long time.\n\nThe other thing to learn is not just a particular recipe for a particular food, but instead learn how a whole category of recipes actually are constructed.  For example, chimichurri is great over steak and you can make it easily with olive oil, garlic, italian parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper, oregano, and thyme.  However, a chimichurri in general is composed of an oil, an acid, a fresh component such as herbs, and aromatics.  That means that you can take that same recipe and use red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice, or use avocado oil instead of olive oil.  Once you know the general structure of the recipe then you can make something with whatever ingredients you happen to have on hand.  I find that it's really common that I look at a recipe and I'm short at least one or two ingredients, but since I know how most of those recipes are generally composed then instead of checking the recipe I look at what I have on hand and then think about what can be made with that.  There are sort of general formulas like that for pan sauces, pasta sauces, quick pickles (specifically how you flavor the brining solution), and probably a shitload of other things that I can't even think of off the top of my head.  Really learn how to cook though instead of just learning recipes and you'll have a lot more success at making everything from scratch.  That's what I did and it's been great!", "Replying again because I love cooking from scratch: baking (sandwich) bread is great because, again, it freezes great. Slice it, put a square of wax paper between each slice, put in freezer. Individual slices go directly in the toaster: as good as fresh.  \nOn Sundays we often bake two big, basic cakes as a family activity: after-schools snacks for the whole week + a nice dessert for Sunday dinner.  \n\nSoups. Big batches of soup. Freeze in separate boxes/bags, either 6 portions, or individual portions if you don't eat at the same time.  \n\nI buy one chicken at the farmer's market: one meal roasted chicken, one meal pasta with a sauce made from cream, left-over meat, and shallots (or onions), then I break and boil the bones and skin to make a great chicken soup.

It's the _best_ stock I ever tasted. Just add to hot water, or use as a base for sauce.  \n\nSalad dressings are easy to make. Vinaigrette is oil, a dash of vinegar, a spoonful of mustard, salt, pepper. Make it in a big jar, shake, it keeps.  \nMayonnaise is egg yolk beaten with a splash of lemon juice, SLOWLY add oil while beating, then salt.

I drink a lot of stock with miso and use it in many of the things I make, having it on hand makes my life so much better. Instead of having leftovers from making large batches of things, I can half or more and then use the rest out of the fridge. I love soup and stew in the winter, I have a great variety of amazing canned soups and stews ready to go when I'm tired and don't want to cook. If organic green beans are plentiful, seasonal and on sale, I'll can them and now I have green beans when I want them. Home canned stuff is far superior in quality and taste to commercially canned goods. And now my freezer is a much more functional space! I keep my excess butter in there, home juiced lime, turmeric, ginger, juices, fresh herbs, paneer, homemade waffles, etc, not gross freezer burned leftovers that I know I'll end up throwing away.

I'm SUPER happy with the end result and the fluffy texture is just amazing. \n\nA written recipe as always:\n\n*  460gr flour + 10-15gr more for later\n*  280ml warm milk\n*  8gr instant yeast\n*  1 medium egg beaten\n*  50gr melted butter\n*  80gr sugar (Light brown + white)\n*  1/4tsp nutmeg, 1tsp cinnamon, 3-4 cloves, pinch of salt\n*  vanilla extract\n*  orange zest from 2 small-medium oranges and the juice from it\n*  rom essence or dark rum alcohol\n*  80-100gr raisins (Or other dried fruits)\n*  same amount of water + flour to make the cross shapes.\n\nOk so I start by having the raisins in a bowl and add a little rum essence + orange juice. Let them soak in for 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile have a bowl with warm milk and add the yeast to it. You can add some of the sugar in and a little flour but not necessary. After 5 minutes, add the mixture to the flour where you also gonna have the spices (I use a Mortar and pestle for cloves) the sugar, melted butter, the beaten egg, vanilla extract and the orange zest. \n\nI use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this, but of course you can kneed it by hand. You will have to kneed for 10-15 minutes or so if doing it by hand. Anyway you should kneed this until is VERY little sticky or not sticky at all. If for some reason your dough is too sticky, add 10-15gr of flour and continue to kneed. When you're almost done, you can add the raisins without the liquid. Probably there will still be a little liquid on them since they're gonna be wet, so you will probably need to add 10-15gr more of flour and continue to kneed for a little more. The dough should easily come off the dough hook and let the hook almost clean. \n\nSpread a little oil in a bowl and put your dough in it. Of course cover it with a plastic sheet. Let it rise for 1-2 hours. It should at least double in size. Make some round buns that are around 150gr, but not bigger than 155gr. Put them in a pan, cover them with plastic and let them rise a second time for 30 minutes or a little more. If is too cold in your house you will probably need more time, but you should let them rise until you can clearly see a difference that they grew.\n\nGive them an egg wash, and have the flour + water in another bowl. You can use a piping bag to add the cross shape of this mixture on top, but I used a teaspoon. The combination of water + flour should be somehow as a pancake batter. If is A LITTLE more liquid is ok, mine was since I added a little more water than flour. Anyway at this point you should have your oven preheated at 200\u00b0C and cook them with fan OFF for 16-17 minutes.\n\nFor a glaze, when you get them out of the oven, I used honey. You can use a simple syrup of water+sugar, honey+orange juice, a really fine jam+water. Is up to you.\n\nI love to eat mine with a sweet creamcheese. And they're best while warm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you gonna enjoy them!", "They look amazing! I can almost taste them \ud83d\ude0aThank you for the detailed recipe can't wait to try\ud83d\ude0b"]}

{"title": "Homemade Mustard from Scratch (3 Ways)", "selftext": "I never thought for a second to make homemade Dijon mustard, however now that I have a few pounds of corned beef on my hands I decided to do a deep dive into the world of mustards. What I came up on were dozens of recipes for dozens of different types of mustard. What was left after the mental distillation process were these 3 mustards: a refined and smooth \"Dijon-style\" mustard, a whole grain sweeter mustard made with beer, and a classic \"English\" style mustard made with yellow mustard powder. Each of these mustards has a time and place and I recommend giving them all a go! Below you'll find the recipes and techniques for each, plus a technique video for those of you who prefer visuals. Good luck!\n\n**French \u201cDijon\u201d Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 3/4 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/4 cup Dry White Wine\n* 2 tbsp White Wine Vinegar\n* 1-3 tbsp Water\n* 2 tsp Salt\n* 2 tsp Sugar\n\n1. Soak seeds overnight in enough water to cover.\n2. Drain seeds, place in mortar and pestle. Mash until the yellow seeds come out of the husks. This will take some time (about 10 mins.)\n3. Once you really begin to see the yellow seeds, slowly start incorporating the wine.\n4. Once all the wine is in, add the salt and sugar then slowly incorporate the vinegar. Grind until the mixture becomes fine.\n5. Once fine, adjust seasoning. Adding sweetness (sugar) will cut the bitterness, adding acid (vinegar/wine) will reduce the \u201cheat.\u201d\n6. Pass the mixture through a fine mesh sieve using the back of a spoon. Optionally, pass it through twice for a super smooth, yellow Dijon mustard.\n7. Store and refrigerate the mustard for a couple days before using. Doing so will allow the mustard to \u201cmature\u201d and reduce its heat.\n\n**English Style Mustard\u2026**\n\n* 1/2 cup Mustard Powder (Colman\u2019s Brand) \\*loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Water\n* 1 1/2 tbsp Sugar \n* 1/2 tsp Salt\n\n1.

Seal and refrigerate to store.\n\n**Whole Grain Mustard (Beer Mustard)...**\n\n* 1/4 cup Yellow Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Brown Mustard Seed\n* 1/2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 1 cup Beer, divided\n* 5 tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 tsp Salt\n\n1.

Then when it's time I put the mustard in a food processor, blend to desired consistency, adjust salt/spices/sweetness/acid and then strain thru a fine mesh strainer.

I know that moisture is a big issue with electric mills, so if that is a concern (even though you are drying in the oven) that may factor into your decision.  I would recommend reading through the reviews and ideas on the [Grains and Milling forum on The Fresh Loaf.](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/forums/gear/grains-and-milling-0)  \n\nAs for opinions on any single product: I have been baking bread for about 3 years and recently started milling my flour.  For a few months I used an old hand crank mill but recently purchased a [WonderMill](http://www.amazon.com/Wondermill-WonderMill-Grain-Mill/dp/B000CPJKWC) and absolutely love it.  I was looking for something not obscenely expensive and this has been great.  The issues people most reported were the noise level and that it has a tendency to spray flour during the milling process.  It's fairly loud, but it takes so little time to mill (maybe 10 seconds for 2 cups of wheat berries) that it hardly matters.  I have not had issues with it spraying flour, although it is kind of annoying to clean (flour just gets in every nook and cranny!).  "]}

Here's some really handy advice I recommend.\n\nGet a reliable, affordable chef's knife, a good paring knife, and a good bread knife. That will be enough for most beginner recipes.\n\nVictorinox Swiss Classic, Victorinox 3\u00bc-Inch Paring Knife are two great affordable choices. Get a large cutting board bigger than a chef's knife. Kitchen scales and meat thermometers are key for beginner chefs. As are measuring cups. I love a good bench scraper, but not necessary. Also, you'll need a really good non-stick pan as your gateway into good cooking.\n\nI always think of good cooking across these five central principles.\n\nIngredients, Recipe, Technique, Organization, Cleanliness.\n\n1) You don't have to break the bank for ingredients. Simple, fresh ingredients, ideally from your local farmer's market, used quickly, makes a world of difference. This is why I always recommend beginner chefs to start with Italian cuisine. The techniques take a backseat to just really good vegetables and meat. Ask your local butcher or fishmonger for what they recommend. \n\nRecipe: Now, these are tricky because of the internet, they're very hit or miss. It's hard to judge whether or not the techniques or ratios are right unless you have experience. So start simple! \n\nEpicurious 101 on youtube has lots of good tutorials.\n\nThink instead of pairings. \n\nIf you like fish, good pairings include soy sauce and honey. Or Garlic and Cumin. Fish typically need an acid, so fresh lemon or lime juice.\n\nIf you like chicken, start simple. Salt, pepper, lemon. Get practice at just using salt properly. \n\nIf you like beef, a simple marinade makes your life easy.\nIf you like veggies, stay simple and do things like roast them.\n\nThis leads to my next point. Technique. You could have the best recipe in the world, but if you way overcook/burn it, or leave it raw/unprocessed when it shouldn't be, it will be inedible. That just takes time. Watch these tutorials in their entirety first.\n\nSecond, prep every single ingredient beforehand, before you turn on any burners or the oven. This is called Mise en Place and it makes it so you aren't overwhelmed. Clean as you go. I'll get into this later.\n\nThird, pay attention to what you're doing. Experienced chefs can go by intuition, but newer chefs need to be attentive. Don't walk away. \n\nFourth, proper knife technique is so key. Having a sharp knife too. Honestly, one of the best ways to train knife skills is to just practice over and over, but slowly and safely. Curl those fingers in so you don't slice off your finger tips. Round is the enemy. Anything that can roll on a cutting board is dangerous. For example, onions and potatoes, just cut them in half, save yourself trouble.\n\nFifth, you'll get a hang out of how to salt your food properly, how to add fat through butter, animal fats, or oils. More is not always better, but don't skimp out either. Taste throughout the process! Not just at the end! You wouldn't monitor an important project by looking at the results, you'd attend to it throughout.\n\nNow we get into my next point - Organization. You want your fridge, spice cabinet (you'll build it up) and pantry totally and completely organized. When you cook, don't scramble for ingredients. Be very deliberate with what you take out, how long you leave it out, and when you are going to use it. Keep it simple. Any dish that has less ingredients is where you want to be.\n\nAlways have three large bowls in front of you when prepping. One bowl on the left is unprocessed ingredients. Middle one is processed ingredients. Right one is trimmings. You should only ever have one of whatever on your board. So if your recipe needs 4 onions, 3 need to stay in the left bowl, focus just on the one in front of you.\n\nFinally, cleanliness. This is linked with organization but is so important for new chefs and experienced chefs alike. Have your main trash can nearby. Have wet paper towels/kitchen rags nearby. Make sure your soap and sink are easily accessible. Keep your area neat and tidy. Clean AS you go, not after. If you spill flour, clean it up right away. If your sink gets full, rinse out a dish or two so it's less overwhelming at the end.\n\nFinally, enjoy cooking! You're going to have a lot of successes. Even more failures. You're going to burn yourself, probably nick a finger, and completely screw up a dish. That's ok. Keep it simple, keep it clean, and you'll do just great.", "I learned to cook from watching YouTube videos.  (And I only started cooking every day in March 2020, out of necessity).

Do not add oil or anything, just rice and heat. Toast until golden brown. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Roughly chop your lemongrass and galangal and tear your kaffir lime leaves in half. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Ground together your toasted rice and all of your herbs (lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves) with a masher until everything is nicely combined\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Now, head over to the stove and in a medium sized pot, add in a little bit of water and wait for that to come to an easy boil. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Add in all your chicken and cook that \n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Once chicken is cooked, add in the rice and herb mixture. Give that a good mix and turn the heat down to low. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Add in your chili flakes, red onion, cilantro, lime juice, fish sauce, sugar, and green onion \n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Give that all a really nice mix, let the flavors release, and turn off the heat and set aside\n&nbsp;\n\n\n- As for cabbage, slice the entire cabbage into fours and peal the layers off, creating a sort of wing to place your meat in. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n- Once you have enough cabbage wings, nicely place the larb (meat mixture) into the groove of the cabbage wing and plate! You don\u2019t have to serve it like that, you can also just place the meat on the side and place a few cabbage pieces next to it and self serve your portion. I just liked to have it prepared already so people can just pick it up and eat! \n&nbsp;\n\n\nThere you go guys! Actually quite a simple recipe\u2026 It\u2019s light and refreshing and oh so delicious. This recipe can also be altered very easily so if you like it more sour you can add more lime juice, more spicy add more chili, or a little sweeter then more sugar! It\u2019s really up to your own preference so when you make this dish, just give the meat mixture a try before taking it off the stove and alter it any way you want by adding anything else in. Enjoy! :) \n"]}

I know I do, especially when is kinda cold outside, I always like to have some soup every week.\n\nFor me there's the simple way of making soup of getting the vegetables cut in some cubes or shapes and put them in the water to boil with some spices, or put them in a pan with a little butter to brown them a little and then in the water.\n\nI prefer browning them in the pan most of the time for some extra flavors. And well I know there are more ways to make a soup, but these are my main 2 simple ways of making it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients : \n\n120gr parsnip, 260gr yellow/red bell pepper, 150gr carrots, 330gr potato, 220gr yellow onion, 10gr hot green pepper, 5 garlic cloves (or more).\n\nThen we have 1tsp of Dill, Basil, Pepper, Smoked Paprika (Or simple paprika, but the smoked flavor goes great in the soup), and 2-4 tsp of salt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor additional flavors I like to add instant soup cubes (Bouillon cubes veggie flavor) and even instant ramen flavor packs. I used a chicken and a hot chili instant ramen condiments. You can totally skip these if you just want a nice soup, but I really recommend playing with them as they're usually really cheap, and add a lot of flavor to your soup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I did for this soup. Cut everything in small bite size cubes or pieces, put some butter in a pan with a little oil, and add the vegetables to it. Let them cook at medium to high heat, mix occasionally and let them get little of that brown color. Put them in around 1L of water and let them cook there for another 20-30 minutes. Check on them, and when the carrot/potato is soft enough the soup is ready. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA small tip, don't have random sizes of vegetables, especially in parsnip, carrot or potato. These takes the most time to cook and you want them in equal pieces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nServe everything on some olive oil on top or skip that step, add some croutons maybe, or garlic bread :) and enjoy it!"]}

Give it a \"butter-wash\" with some melted butter, and add a mixture of sugar+cinnamon. After that, add your apples that are cut in small cubes.

For the last couple years, I've intensely avoided making pie crusts because I find them difficult and somehow always manage to mess them up.  I'm a little worried about making the crust because I don't have a food processor or a French-style rolling pin, both of which seem to be the preferred method of pie crust making.

Make sure not to add too much water, and chill the dough for two hours before rolling out. Good luck!", "This is going to sound strange, but keep trying with different pie recipes. I don't know how or why, but originally I had found a perfect pie recipe when I lived in Ohio and I made it for years. I moved to Oregon and even with using the same brand of ingredients, suddenly all my pie crusts were hard as a rock. I had to find a completely different recipe. \n\nPastry cutter should be fine, or even just using the paddle attachment for a stand mixer, that's all I use because I'm lazy. I use a French-style rolling pin myself but only because I like not having moving parts to gum up, any roundish object to roll the crust would be fine. Or skip a tool all together and pat it as flat as you can if you don't mind a bit of a rustic look!", "Thanks so much everyone!

I just use my fingers to mix the butter in, and I have never had any problems.", "Try using really cold butter (usually I just use it straight from the fridge, but if the weather is a bit warm, I might put it in the freezer for 15 minutes or so first) and grate it into the flour with a cheese grater. I stop every so often to  break up the clump of shreds and toss them in the flour. Then add your liquid ingredients and just stir until combined, then tip onto a floured bench and just quickly, roughly knead until it's a little smoother and can be patted into a flattish disc. Refrigerate for an hour or so, then roll out with something smooth and cylindrical. The butter will still be in small pieces, which is what gives flaky pastry its flakiness; the water in the butter steams while cooking and separates the layers of dough.\n\nI used to hate making pastry, but this changed everything!", "the dough needs to be cold. if it gets wonky, put it in the freezer for a bit and try again", "You can use a cheese grater with frozen butter :)\n\nI frequently use parchment paper to roll my crusts on. When my husband rearranged the kitchen (without my permission) the two rolling pins I owned went missing. A bottle of wine was my hero that evening. Also now I own 3 rolling pins after realizing that using a wine bottle is far more effort than it's worth.\n\nThe key is definitely to keep EVERYTHING COLD!!! I even put the wooden board in the freezer. Also after mixing everything together and making it nice and smooth put the dough in the fridge for 3 hours. Just ball it up and wrap it in plastic wrap. That in my opinion is when the magic happens", "I've tried sooooooo many pie crust recipes. There's only one recipe I use now, it's simply the best: http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2007/12/p-p-p-pie_crust_and_its_p-p-p-perfect/\n\nLots of helpful pictures and detailed descriptions too.", "I'm not pie crust expert, and it's been years since I made one with my father, but we used simple tools.

Don't work it any more than needed.\n\nHe, being a bit crude, used to say that it's the right consistency when if feels like a woman's breast (of course, in much more colorful language). \n\nI recall Alton Brown saying that using your finger tips rather than the whole hand is important -- the finger tips don't warm the butter and water as much as the whole hand. ", "It's not scary...just have ice water and COLD butter on hand. freeze your mixing bowl. Good luck!", "Here is my recipe and techniques.  It has worked perfectly every time for me. (Makes two crusts)\n\n3 cups all purpose flour\n1 1/2 tsp salt\n3 tbsp sugar \n1 cup shortening\n1 egg\n1 tsp white vinegar\n5 tbsp water\n\nCombine flour, salt and sugar. (Fork is fine if no pastry blender) Cut in shortening. \n\nIn another bowl, combine egg, vinegar and 4 tbsp water. \nWhisk together then gradually add to flour mixture mixing with fork until it forms a ball.\n\nAdd the last tbsp of water if needed, then wrap the ball in cling film and press (to make sure any flaky parts get pressed into the ball).\n\nChill in fridge for at least 10 minutes. 30 is better.\n\nFlour whatever you are rolling onto and something heavyish and round. Wine bottles are great. Then roll. If it splits a little just press it back together. (If it breaks up really bad just roll in into a ball and try again). \n\nGood luck\n\n\n\n"]}

Mike was nice enough to take a couple of my calls and let me pick his brain about the soup, noodles, toppings, and everything in between.\n\nRamen from scratch is no simple feat. It takes time, waiting and some know-how... but don't worry the last part comes with trial and error (I didn't know JACK before I started toying with the soup/noodle techniques.) What lays before you is my interpretation of a shoyu ramen. I did my best to make it easier for the home cook - using common kitchen measurements (cups, tbsp, tsp, etc.) when possible and distilling down some complicated techniques into simple step processes. Big shoutout to Ramen\\_Lord and Way of Ramen for all the dope free information you guys provide to the masses, you two are doing the Ramen Gods work (go peep them on Instagram and YouTube.)\n\n*Almost all ramen includes 5 components*. Below you'll find the recipe organized into categories - *the noodles, soup, tare (flavor base), aromatic oil, and additional toppings*. I hope this recipe inspires you to learn more about ramen, or at the very least builds more confidence in the kitchen. Let me know if you have any questions below and COOK AWN! \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc Adam\n\nNoodles: \"Easy Ramen Noodles\"\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 500g Bread Flour\n* 200g Water\n* 2g Sodium Carbonate\n* 5g Salt\n\n\\*This recipe requires a pasta machine. I use [this model](https://amzn.to/3kifsHK).\n\n\\*\\* Like most dough/bread recipes, this requires precision. I find that a [kitchen scale](https://amzn.to/3wyntgt) it necessary here to achieve consistent results.\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Stir salt and sodium carbonate into water until dissolved.\n2. Add the flour to a large bowl and incrementally, slowly pour the salted water over the flour while mixing. The mix should resemble a shaggy, crumbly mess that holds together when squeezed but falls apart when lightly massaged again. Add the dough to a ziplock bag and rest for 30 minutes.\n3. Put the ziplock bag filled with dough in another larger bag and step on the dough to create a flat sheet of dough about half an inch thick. Let the dough rest for 30 more minutes.\n4. Remove the dough from the bag, I use scissors to cut the bag as to not break the dough sheet, but I'm clumsy so you might not have to. Roll the dough sheet out until it\u2019s about 1/4 inch thick then slice it in half so it can be fed and rolled through the pasta machine.\n5. Feed one dough sheet through the \u201c0\u201d setting on the pasta machine a couple times, then fold it in half and feed it through the \u201c2\u201d setting open-end-side first. This lamination step will help align the gluten in one direction through the entire noodles which helps with texture and makes the eating experience more pleasurable.\n6. Roll the dough out one number at a time until you reach the \u201c5\u201d or \"6\" setting; 5 for thicker noodles, 6 for thinner. Once the dough is rolled out it will be long so cut the sheets into two sections. Attach the noodle cutter then feed in one sheet using your hand to keep the dough sheet flat and avoid any kinking. You may need to periodically hit the noodle sheets with a light dusting of corn or potato starch, but I've found it isn't always necessary with this dough.\n7. Lightly massage a bit of corn or potato starch into the finished noodles, portion out (100g portions), and store in a lightly starch-dusted lidded container in the fridge for 1 day before using. They'll last a couple days in the fridge, or up to 6 months in the freezer if wrapped tightly.\n8. Cook the noodles in boiling water for 2 minutes before immediately transferring to a bowl of piping hot ramen broth (see broth recipe below).\n\n\\* Optionally, dust the noodle portions in corn or potato starch and squeeze them in your hand to make wavy noodles.\n\n\\* Homemade Sodium Carbonate: Bake 100g Baking Soda on foiled baking sheet and bake at 250F for 1 hour. You\u2019ll lose about 1/3 the weight of your baking soda . Sodium carbonate gives the noodles a chewy, stretchy profile which is critical for making proper ramen noodles - don't skip it.\n\nSoup: \"Tonkotsu Soup\" by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4.5 lb Pork Neck Bones\n* 4.5 lb Pork Femur Bones or Ham Hocks\n* 25 Cups Water\n* 1 Onion, halved\n* 10 Garlic Cloves, peeled\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. The night before, or at least 6 hours before cooking, soak your neck bones and femurs in water in a cold, non-reactive vessel. I use a big Tupperware container. (Technically this is optional, but I find the resulting broth is whiter in appearance).\n2. When ready to cook, add your neck bones and femurs to a pot with fresh water. Bring to a boil, then down to a simmer, and skim the scum that rises to the top of the pot. Do this for 15-20 minutes, or until little scum is rising. The scum goes through several phases here, you\u2019ll know when the scum is pretty much done rising. This blanch is integral for a white broth, don\u2019t skip it, and don\u2019t end it prematurely.\n3. Strain the bones from the blanching liquid. Discard the liquid\\*.\\*\n4. Scrub and clean the bones under running water, removing any black or dirty looking particulate that may be on the outside of the bones or in crevices.\u00a0\n5. Add the now clean bones to a pot and add 6 L of water.\n6. Cook at a medium boil for 18 hours, stirring frequently.\n7. In the last hour, add aromatics to the broth and bump the heat up to medium-high.\n8. Strain the soup.\n9. To finalize the emulsion, add the soup to a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds, being careful to gradually bring the blender to high to avoid splashing yourself, as the soup will rapidly expand when it blends. You can also use a hand blender, blending for 5 minutes, though the emulsion won\u2019t be as strong.\u00a0\n10. Reserve the soup as needed.\n\nTare: \"Standard Shoyu Tare\" adapted from Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups Soy Sauce\n* 2 (4x3 inch) strips Kombu\n* 1/4 cup Mirin\n* 1/4 cup Sake\n* 7-8 medium Dried Anchovies (\"Niboshi\")\n* 2 cups Katsuobushi, loosely packed\n* 2 tbsp Brown Sugar\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, kombu, dried anchovies and sake in container then place in the fridge and let sit overnight.\n2. The next day, heat the mixture just until it\u2019s about to simmer. The tare should be steaming but not bubbling. Hold it at this stage for 10 minutes.\n3. Remove the kombu. Whisk in the brown sugar until it\u2019s dissolved then add the katsuabushi. Hold at just under a simmer for 10 more minutes.\n4. Strain the tare, store in the fridge as needed. It will last for 6 months in a covered container.\n\nAromatic Oil: Scallion \"Negi\" Oil by Ramen\\_Lord\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* One bunch scallion whites, trimmed to their ends\n* 1/2 cup Neutral Oil\n\n**Technique:**\n\n1. Add oil and scallions to a small saucepan.\n2. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 10-15 minutes or until the scallions cook to a golden brown.\n3. Remove from the heat, strain the oil into a heat-proof container and store until needed.\n\n\\* The crispy scallions also make a topping for a sandwich or eggs.\n\nAdditional Toppings: Soy Egg, Chashu Pork, Menma, Scallions\n\n**Chashu Pork Ingredients:**\n\n* Pork Shoulder or Pork Belly, tied if needed\n* 1/2 cup Shoyu\n* 1/2 cup Water\n* 1 cup Sake\n* 1 cup Mirin\n* 1/2 Tbsp Brown Sugar\n* 1 onion, halved\n* 4 garlic cloves, smashed\n* 3 inch knob ginger, sliced\n* 1 tsp salt\n* Pepper TT\n\nChashu Pork Technique:\n\n1. Add all ingredients to a large heavy bottomed bot with a lid. Braise on 300F (149c) for 2-3 hours, or until the pork is easily pierced with a fork.\n2. Let the pork cool in the cooking liquid overnight.\n3. The next day remove the pork from the pot and slice into portions. Optionally, broil the pork or torch it for color.\n\n**Marinated Egg Ingredients:**\n\n* 1/3 cup Water\n* 1/3 cup Mirin\n* 1/3 cup Soy Sauce\n\n**Marinated Egg Technique:**\n\n1. Mix all ingredients in a cup, add eggs. Let marinade for 6-8 hours, then remove from brine and store in covered container. Leaving the eggs in the brine too long makes them VERY salty, so be aware of that.\n\n**Scallions, sliced thin**\n\n* Grab a bunch of scallions, slice them as thin as you can, reserve for serving.\n\n**Menma**\n\n* This is marinated, fermented bamboo shoot. I buy these from my asian market, but you can order them online [here](https://amzn.to/3D3ZgB8).\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Remove toppings from the fridge to temper so they aren't cold, (soy eggs, menma, chashu, etc.)\n2. Bring the soup to a simmer and begin boiling water for the noodles to cook.\n3. When the noodle cooking water is boiling, drop the noodles.\n4. While the noodles cook add the tare, aroma oil and hot broth to a warm serving bowl.\n5.

Of course most foods we buy other than produce are \"processed\" (cheese, pickles, canned tomatoes, pasta), but there's an intuitive difference between something you can easily make at home and something you cannot.\n\nSo for me, canned tomatoes are fine when used \"from scratch\" but jarred marinara sauce is not.  Dried pasta is fine (unless it's a \"homemade pasta\" recipe) but Hamburger Helper is not.  Cheese, pickles, anything that's difficult or takes more than a few hours to make is fine as an ingredient.  Cook's Country has a recipe for Buttermilk Baked Chicken that uses a packed of dried ranch dressing salad mix in lieu of buttermilk powder.  That's not \"from scratch\" in my book.\n\nThe exception here is if the pre-prepared product is a main focus of the dish.  It's not \"baked tortellini from scratch\" if you buy supermarket tortellini.

Set to simmer down to a jus (de Canard), at this point I play with the salt and pepper to get the flavoring right\n* Meat gets pulled and put in a pan with the jus added, on low heat, so that plenty of the liquid in the jus is vaporised and all the flavors get absorbed into the pulled duck\n* Once there is next to no liquid forming if you lightly press a fork onto the meat take off heat, put into jars, add a tiny amount of goosefat from the confit, stir, and the coat the top with goosefat so that it will form a protective layer when cooled.\n\nMy philosophy is that less is more, but a tiny amount of flavoring really brings out the bright duck flavors while muting any gameyness. Using whiskey instead of wine will take away some sourness while adding some woodsy earthyness which I feel compliments the duck well. The sweet soy, carrot and onions give a slight sweetness that just warms up the entire taste.\n\nIs there a dark horse I left out like star anise that really puts the REEE in Rillette, or did I already overdo it, as I am wont to?\n\nLastly: I've seen several recipes throw out the bones and skin and the juices without making it into a jus. This seems like throwing away the very soul of the dish or am I missing something here? Also, I'd love to make this using entire ducks to lower my cost but I have found it extremely difficult to get a hold of duck for less than the price of just the legs (about 8 euros per kilo in NL, Europe).

I'd love some help!\n____________\n\nSo this really is completely from scratch - yogurt is homemade, jelly is homemade, granola is homemade.\n\n**Yogurt**\n\n* 4 cups milk (2% for me, but whatever)\n* 4 tbsp yogurt (2% for me, but whatever... make sure it has active cultures in it)\n\n1. Preheat oven by turning on oven light. Check in advance what temp your oven gets to. It needs to be in the range of 85-110F. Mine gets to about 90F, which apparently makes for a creamy yogurt so I've never bothered bringing it higher.\n2. Over a double boiler (I put one pan inside of another, as I don't have one), heat up the milk. Stir so you don't get scum on the bottom, and bring up to 200F.\n2. Keep at 200F for 5-10 minutes (helps yogurt with its texture), then turn off the heat. Don't move the double boiler. This will help the milk cool down slowly, keeping it at a higher temp for longer.\n3. Take out yogurt from fridge to bring to room temp.\n4. When milk is at the temperature of your oven (90F for me), add the 4 tbsp yogurt to 1 cup milk. Stir gently, and pour back into the big pan of milk.\n5. Put milk in the oven, wrapped in a towel. Let it sit for 4-8 hours depending on what the incubation temp is. I do 8 hours at 90F, but at 110F you may not need more than 4-5.\n6. Place in fridge and DO NOT stir yet! Let it sit overnight, and in the morning stir it and it will be nice and thick and creamy.\n\n**Strawberry Compote**\n\n* 1 lb strawberries, halved (or quartered if they're huge)\n* 2 tbsp brown sugar\n* Zest of 1/4 lemon\n* 1 tbsp mint leaves, finely chopped\n\n1. Combine strawberries and brown sugar in pan, and place over medium heat. Don't worry about a lack of water, the strawberries will let down juices. Just keep an eye on it until they do.\n2. After the strawberries start getting soft, begin mashing with potato masher. \n3. Add the zest and mint, and wait another 5-10 minutes or so.\n4. Finish mashing to the texture you like your compote (I hate chunks so I go at it with gusto).\n\nThis is basically the recipe from [this link](http://jenncuisine.com/2009/05/french-toast-with-strawberry-compote/).\n\n**Granola**\n\nI'm not going to give you a recipe of what I did, because I thoroughly bastardized the recipe from [this link](http://www.travelerslunchbox.com/journal/2007/6/9/the-lip-ladys-secret-granola.html), which is quite long and I don't want to retype it.

This cut has more surface area that the regular slice so it'll hold onto dressings and sauces better\n* Half Moon  \n\n   * Split the cucumber along its length, then slice normally.

I usually pour off my mix into another cup, add the egg to my blending cup and then pour the mix over a spoon back in there. \n\nI saw that someone suggested adding the vinegar later. I don't know about that. I've never tried it that way so I can't say it won't work, but I have heard a chef claiming that the acid in the vinegar helps the egg create an emulsion.

In a bowl mash your bananas. Having ripe ones is better, but as much as they're not green they're ok.\n\nIn another bowl have the butter at room temperature. Add the sugar on top of it, and use an electric mixer to mix it for around 2 minutes. Now add the eggs and do the same thing. Scrape the sides if necessary. Now add your greek yogurt, mashed bananas and the vanilla extract. Mix this together until incorporated.\n\nNow in another bowl of course, add the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and a little salt. Mix these with a tiny whisk or something.\n\nAdd them on top of your wet ingredients and mix it with the mixer until incorporated. Start with the mixer turned off if you don't want flour dust all over your face, and then start it at low speed. It shouldn't take more than half a minute or so. Add the chopped nuts in there, and fold them. You can also add some raisins or other dried fruits, but you will have to adjust the quantities.\n\nTake your baking pan, mine is 22 by 12, add a parchment paper to it and cook it at 180\u00b0C for around 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let it cool off before removing it from the pan to room temp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now, enjoy your beautiful banana bread! I know I did. This was eaten at the same day I made it by my family."]}

Remove the sausages and we gonna cook all vegetables in it with a little more butter until they start to get color. If you want you carrots to cook more, you can boil them a little before, or cook them for a little longer and then add the rest. The garlic goes in at the end.\n\nNow add the sausages back, and add the canned tomatoes, chicken stock and tomato sauce to cover everything. Add your condiments and mix.

Taste to see if you need more salt, and when you stop the heat add the baby spinach. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs canned tomatoes you can use whatever shape or form you want.

For Nana's Devil Cupcakes\n\nIn a bowl you put the flour with cocoa, salt, baking powder, soda. In another bowl you mix the eggs with the sugar, milk, coffee, oil and vanilla essence.\nYou put the dry ingredients in the wet ones. All at once. The recipe says to gently fold with a wooden spoon and not overmix. You will end up having lumps. \nI personally started to use a whisk because I had really big lumps, but I still didn't overmix and remained with some lumps. \nThe end result was still great.\n\nFill 2/3 of your cupcake paper, and bake it at 190 degree Celsius for 20-25 minutes. They're done when you put a toothpick in them and it comes out clean.\n\n-------------------------\n\nNow for Vanilla Cupcakes\n\nIn a bowl you put the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and mix it a little. In another bowl, you get milk, vegetable oil, vanilla essence, and eggs and combine of course.\nNow you add the wet ingredients to the dry ones and here, you can mix with a whisk as much as you want. Get rid of lumps.\n\nFill 2/3 of your cupcake paper, bake it at 175 degree Celsius for 35 minutes or until you do the toothpick test.\n\nBoth of these are cooked with no fan. When you pull them out of the oven, let them stay in the baking tray and paper for 5-10 minutes. Don't get them out of the paper until they're room temp.\n\n----------------------------\n\nSo Nana's Devil Cake/Cupcake. I did not really liked them, but that's mostly because I personally don't really enjoy cocoa sweets. \nDon't try to combine both batters into one. I did it, but I did not mix them, maybe if you mix them it will work better, but then you gonna lose all the vanilla if you mix it."]}

This time to be in theme with the season I made Mini Pumpkin Pies!\n\nIf you'd like to see some pictures : https://imgur.com/gallery/ZrDBwS2\n\nIf you don't make the pie crust at home, this is a very easy recipe, and anyone can make it.\nI personally chose to not make my pie crust because after researching a little, it takes a lot of time, and the one from the store is good enough.\n\nSo Recipe (You can make 1 whole big pie or 15-20 Smaller ones like mine)\n\n - 750gr Pumpkin Puree\n - 140gr Sugar\n - 10-15gr Vanilla Sugar\n - 175ml Milk\n - 2 Eggs\n - 25gr Butter\n - 1tsp Cinnamon\n - 1/2tsp Salt\n - 1/2tsp Nutmeg(or a little less since nutmeg is really strong)\n\nNow to make the pumpkin puree...that's easy. Cut your pumpkin in half, remove the seeds, brush it with a little vegetable oil, and cook it in the oven at 170 degree Celsius until your fork can go VERY easy trough them.\n\n - Now scoop out the puree from the pumpkin, mash it a little and when it gets to room temperature you can start making your filling.\n - Add the eggs to the pumpkin puree and mix until everything combines nicely.\n - Add the butter. Recommended here is melted butter, but I personally used one that was in shape but warm enough that it melts when you mix it with the filling. I got a great result. The point is to mix everything until you won't see the butter anymore if you want to do it like me.\n - Add the sugar, milk, cinnamon, salt and nutmeg. And mix until everything looks nice.\n\nAnd now how to prepare the rest:\n\n - Prepare your pie crust to not be super cold when you try to put it in the tart shapes, but it should be cold before putting it into the oven. Use non-stick spray or butter to coat your pie forms.\n - You have to precook the pie crust. Make some holes in the bottom with a fork after you put them in the shape and put some weight on them with a baking paper (Beans, Stones, Rice) and cook them at 170-180 degree Celsius until you spot the first color change. At this point you want them to cook JUST ENOUGH for the base to not get fluffy. This steps take like 5-10 minutes.\n - Now remove the weight from them and cook them like 5-8 more minutes so you won't have a moist base. You want it to be crispy! It should be done when the base is starting to get color. Don't make them golden brown all the way, because there's a chance to burn them when you cook the pumpkin.\n - Add the filling to your pie crust or mini pie crusts, and cook them for another 15-20 minutes at 170 degree celsius, or until you see the crust having a great golden brown color. You don't want to burn the crust.\n - Now add whip cream and decorate them as you want...and Enjoy them! \n\nMy SO made some little shapes with the remaining pie crust that we had. Some small pumpkins leaves and mushrooms. I don't know to tell you how to make them because I have no talent into shaping them. But, if you want to do it, all I know is that you need the pie crust to be cold when you shape them, and cold when you cook it.\n\nI was SUPER HAPPY with the end result, even though I had a weird tube of whip cream and the blob of whip cream was a little weird. Now, I would love to hear if any of you have different secrets or ingredients that goes into this kind of pie?\nWhat spices do use other than cinnamon or nutmeg ?"]}

{"title": "Make Your Own with price comparisons?", "selftext": "Hi all, I'm looking for your best \"make your own\" recipes with cost comparisons to box mixes. I recently found a recipe for make your own rice a roni but I was wondering how it breaks down compared to box mix for a dollar. Anyone have some copycat recipes with price comparisons? If no pricing I'd still like to see your best recipe, things I can prep ahead with dry ingredients and then just add wet ingredients when ready to make (kind of like jar cookie mixes but with real food sides or meal items). Thanks!\n\nEdited to add I already do a decent amount of scratch cooking - like pasta sauce, mac&cheese, homemade pizza...we also occasionally buy these things, too. Annie's mac & cheese (with coupons) is a great side dish or lunch option that tastes good and homemade mac & cheese is much tastier but that's something I would make as a dinner entree. My sister and I owned a bakery for a short time. We would cost out all of our recipes in order to figure out the prices. Homemade cookies (large size) of almost any variety (choc chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter) almost all worked out to between 15-22c per cookie. Homemade brownies worked out to be around 40c (for the large bakery size serving we made). Frosting - pennies compared to can frosting unless you get it on a really great sale. A bulk recipe for pizza dough = about 25c for a 16oz pizza dough. Our local stores sell it on average $2.39 and there's a monthly sale cycle at one store where you can get 10/$10. Even Walmart is $1.73 at rollback and I believe neither of these are a full 16oz dough. I think they are 13 oz. Anyway, yes I'm interested in replacing some of the processed stuff with homemade versions if possible as long as they are easy and not too expensive. Maybe this edit helps clarify what I'm looking for.

Well done. I will be making the cake this weekend.", "Chocoflan or Impossible Cake is a very popular dessert in Mexico.Is magically delicious and is not so hard to make as you can think.\nHope you like it.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n \n**For chocolate cake:** \n\n- 120gr Butter at Room temperature.\n \n- 1 Cup of sugar, \n\n- 2 Eggs at room temperature. \n\n- 1 3/4 Cup of flour. \n\n- 3/4 tsp. Baking powder. \n\n- 3/4 tsp. Baking soda. \n\n- 1/3 Cocoa powder. \n\n- 1 Cup of milk. \n\n- 1/3 Espresso or stron coffe. \n\n- 1/4 Cup of Pecan (Finely chopped and toasted)\n \n- 1 tsp Vanilla. \n\n**For the Flan:**\n \n- 100 gr. Cream Cheese or Mascarpone Cheese. \n\n- 339ml Evaporated Milk. (1 Lata). \n\n- 286ml Condensed Milk (1 Lata).\n \n- 5 Eggs. \n\n- 1 tsp. Vanilla. \n\n**To Cover:** \n\n- Pecan (Finely chopped and toasted) \n\n- Caramel.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- The baking mold I use is 24 Cm. \n\n- If you add Cajeta instead of caramel, before putting the caramel put a bit of butter. \n\n- Grease all the baking mold with a little, very little bit of butter. It will help to unmold with no problems, when flip cake. Flip cake with a fast movement.\n \n- The tray where I put the baking mold with chocoflan for Bain Marie was too big. If you can, use smaller one, but higher than the one that I use. If possible higher than the baking mold with the chocoflan. Is important that water you pour to make the bain marie is at half of the baking mold with the chocoflan. \n\n- The Chocoflan cake was in Oven at Bain Marie for 2 hours at 180 C. The time will take for you will depend of your oven. It can take from 1 to 2 Hours. In my case, after 2 hours I turn off the oven and open the door of the oven until cool down and then I remove. I let to cool down at room temperature for about 2 hours and then I unmold. To check if cake is ready after 1 hour inside oven, carefully open a bit the cake and try with a toothpick, If not ready, cover again perfectly and leave more time in oven. I prefer to leave it in oven without check for 2 hours.Because I knew my oven is not powerful. But I check the water to not be consumed. If you notice the water evaporated, just ad carefully more water without removing the cake from oven. \n\n- Before serve, I take to the Refrigerator.In mi case, 12 hours. But with 4 hours in refrigerator is enough.\n\n**Espanol:**\n\nSorprende a tus familiares con este Chocoflan o Pastel Imposible, un postre muy conocido y consumido en M\u00e9xico y que no puedes perderte por nada del mundo. \nYa que es m\u00e1gicamente delicioso y no tan complicado como parece.\n \n**Ingredientes:**\nPara el Pan de chocolate: \n\n- 120gr de Mantequilla a temperatura ambiente. \n\n- 1 Taza de azucar. \n\n- 2 Huevos a temperatura ambiente.\n \n- 1 3/4 de taza de Harina.\n \n- 3/4 Cdta. de polvo para hornear. \n\n- 3/4 Cdta. de Bicarbonato de sodio. \n\n- 1/3 de Taza de cocoa. \n\n- 1 Taza de leche. \n\n- 1/3 Taza de Cafe. \n\n- 1/4 Taza de nueces finamente picadas y tostadas. \n\n- 1 Cdta. de Vainilla. \n\n**Para el Flan:** \n\n- 100 gr. de Queso Crema o Queso Mascarpone. \n\n- 339ml de Leche evaporada. (1 Lata).\n \n- 286ml de Leche condensada (1 Lata). \n\n- 5 Huevos. \n\n- 1 Cdta. de Vainilla. \n\n**Para Cubrir:** \n\n- Nueces.\n \n- Caramelo.\n\n**Tips:** \n\n- El Molde que utilice es de 24Cm. de di\u00e1metro en forma de rosca.\n\n- Si a\u0144ades cajeta en el fondo en lugar de caramelo, antes de poner la cajeta pon un poco de mantequilla. \n\n- Engrasa todo el molde con un poquitito de mantequilla muy poquito. Te ayudara a desmoldar mejor. \n\n- El molde donde coloque el chocoflan estaba muy grande, utiliza uno mas peque\u00f1o pero si mas alto, incluso si puedes conseguir uno mas alto que el molde que contiene el chocoflan.\n \n- El Chocoflan estuvo en el horno a ba\u0144o mar\u00eda por 2 horas a 180 C. El tiempo que te lleve depender\u00e1 de tu horno puede llevarte de 1 hasta 2 horas. Pasando las dos horas deje abierto el horno apagado hasta que estuviera fri\u00f3 y retire. Lo deje enfriar completamente a temperatura ambiente por 2 horas y entonces desmolde. Puedes destapar con mucho cuidado pasando la hora y probar con un palillo, si no esta listo cubre perfectamente nuevamente sin sacar del horno. Yo prefer\u00ed dejarlo en el horno sin destapar por las dos horas, pues mi horno no es muy potente. Pero eso si, vigile que el agua no se consumiera. Si Ves que el agua se esta consumiendo, solo a\u0144ade con cuidado sin retirar del horno.\n \n- Antes de servir lo lleve al refrigerador, en mi caso, de un d\u00eda para otro.

{"title": "Why is my pizza dough so inconsistent?", "selftext": "I have been making pizza for several  years at home and I usually use a recipe from cooks illustrated.  For the first year or two I used a food processor but then somehow or another we moved and lost it.  The food processor always seemed to do pretty well.  \n\nSo we ended up getting a top of the line kitchenaid mixer and I've had very inconsistent success with it.  Due to my understanding of how to manipulate the dough I can usually salvage it but basically the dough rarely forms a nice ball in the mixer.  Every once in a while it will form a nice ball with the EXACT same measurement, and temperature water and everything, then other times it's just a complete mess.  I end up having to add a half cup or more of flour to get it to ball up a bit.  When I pull the dough out of the mixer then it's SUPER sticky.  It's like super glue in my hands.  I then kneed it for a min or two on the counter and fold it on itself to form a ball then let is rise for several hours.  When it starts out super sticky like that the dough is often very weak after rising.  Like if i tried to toss it in the air the dough would just blow apart.  I have to be very careful with it on the counter and finesse it other wise holes rip very easily.\n\nSo what am I doing wrong?  Am i over kneeding the dough in the mixer?  Am I under kneeding?  Something just isn't right.

Other competitive high gluten brands are: Gibralter, Remarkable, Magnifico and Eagle. 3) Proof the yeast with at least 3/4 tsp. of sugar. Knead the dough 4\u20135 minutes to develop the proteins into a strong gluten structure. At first the dough will have no elasticity. As it is worked it becomes stretchable and elastic. If kneading by hand this should take about 8-12 minutes. 4) I let my pizza dough rest in the refrigerator for 2 days to build flavor then toss it into pies.", "Might be worthwhile to stretch and fold a few times throughout the rising period, especially if it's sticky... find this helps get better development on doughs with a higher hydration.\n", "I've tried a few different pizza dough recipies and Paul Hollywoods is my favorite, I always get amazing dough from that. It sounds like you might not be kneading the dough for long enough, my dough always starts out super sticky but as you knead it will become easier to handle and form a smooth stretchy ball.

This sub (r/fromscratch) is for much more origins-oriented cooking. Meaning, in terms of your whole-wheat bread question, how do we produce home-made whole wheat flour, and how do we harvest wild yeast to make it rise, etc.  That is the original intent of this sub, anyway. It strays from time to time, but it would be good to try to keep it on that track. You'll have better luck in the other subs; they're just plain more popular, so you'll get more answers. Good luck!", "Since you appear to be new I'm going to reply here instead of expect you to cross post.\n \nFirst, you have to have the right wheat (in case you are grinding your own) Hard wheat is for bread and soft wheat is for pastries. \n\nWhole wheat by itself makes a good Irish type bread where you use baking soda/powder instead of yeast.\n\nThe best loaves are a mix of whole wheat flour and unbleached white flour.\n\nThat being said, when making 100% whole wheat bread you are looking for a banana bread type consistency. If you make a typical firm, kneadable loaf it will turn into a brick because the ww absorbs a lot of moisture.\n\nEasiest method is the following, not a specific recipe as much as guidelines. I make it by eye.\n\nMix a couple tsp of yeast with a TBSP or more sweetener (sugar, honey, molasses, agave nectar etc.) A beer bread uses 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sugar per loaf, banana bread can use up to a cup of sugar and artisnal breads like baguettes have zero sugar. Make it how you like it.\n \nAdd warm liquid or combination of your choice (water, milk, beer, juice, coffee, be creative if you want) \n \nAdd fat (optional) (Butter, oil, peanut butter etc.)\n\nAdd egg (optional)\n\nAdd flavor (optional) Salt, a little bit really makes a difference usually 1/2 to 1 tsp per loaf, even the sweet ones. Garlic and herbs for savory, cinnamon and vanilla for sweet etc.\n\nAdd flour of your choice (whole wheat, flax meal, coconut flour, almond meal, ground lentils, ground beans etc.)\n\nMix\n\nAdd extras of your choice (nuts, raisins, cheese, bacon crumbles, fruit, you name it you can add it just remember fruit adds moisture and account for it.)\n\nPour into greased pan of your choice. Loaf, muffin, cake whatever. Shape is a matter of preference and end use. \n\nBake.  Depending on ingredients usually between 350 to 375 for 45 to 60 min.  Do a toothpick test for doneness and cover with foil if top gets too dark.\n\nWill slice cleaner if cooled, which certainly ruins any dream of hot buttered bread.\n\nGood luck. "]}
