I'm not a historian nor a food expert but at one point, my father added fried chicken wings to the menu.

His answer was that his partners agreed that it should be added to the menu even though it was considered more of a takeout item because people asked if they sold it.

Is it the same as tahini?\n\n3: sometimes I see at some tables a spice mix or something, I don't know what it is but it looks like a blend of powdered spices to also dip into.

You can probably substitute it with tahini if that\u2019s all you have, but they are different. You usually add other things like soy sauce and other things to the sesame paste to make a dipping sauce of your liking. There is a lot of flexibility with dipping sauces, you can add minced garlic and other spices too, so just look some up and make one that you like.\n\nFor the broth, you can start out with any basic chicken broth and I would then go out and buy some hot pot broth seasoning that you and your daughter like, there are spicy ones and non spicy ones.", "That's great. Her hot pot birthday party will blow away the Benihana parties.", "For broth you can use any cuts of meats (pork or chicken is usually preferred, also vegetables). \nThe side sauces are used for dipping the cooked meats or vegetables, otherwise it\u2019ll be bland. \n\nThe sesame sauce is similar to tahini.\nYou can use peanut butter, soy sauce, vinegar, XO sauce along with chopped scallions, garlic, sesame seeds to create your own dipping sauce. Some diners use a raw chicken egg as part of their dipping sauce (I do it). It\u2019s endless.\n\nSuggest going to an Asian grocery store and scope out the pre-sliced meats to use for hot pot (also can use for BBQ).  Vegetables and mushrooms help with flavor and meat sweats. \n\nAs for hardware, a portable electric Wok or portable burner that use butane. Both allow you to control the heat/flame. Little strainers will help get food floating in the pot.", "You could use an old hen for sure! I would say use whatever you have available, in my opinion it won't make or break the broth. \n\nThe [sesame paste ](https://u.yamibuy.com/20688962) is different from tahini, in that it uses whole toasted sesame (rather than raw, hulled), so it's nuttier in flavor.\n\nThe spice powder you're looking for is probably [something like this](https://u.yamibuy.com/20542435). I make my own at home since I keep all of those ingredients on hand. I use a mix of dried facing heaven chilis and a hotter variety (not sure what they're called), but really any chili you enjoy will be fine if you decide to make it yourself.\n\nAs a fellow hot pot enthusiast, I think your daughter is very fortunate that you're willing to go to the effort to get it right! Good luck and enjoy!", "Asian market buy me has an entire isle of hot pot stuff. You can get all the bases and sauces etc. they even have those fun shaped hot pot starters like the bears and stuff.", "For the broth, if you want it simple, just use any broth you would be willing to eat...meaning, personally, I wouldn't buy grocery store chicken broth that is full of salt. If you want to make chicken broth/stock from scratch, either save the bones from other chicken meals or buy a rotissary chicken from the store, use up the meat, and save the bones and use that. Hot pot broth doesn't need to be some extravagant soup. If you daughter enjoy drinking the soup, then maybe put a little more effort into it, but honestly the broth will change flavor throughout the hot pot meal as you cook other foods in the broth. My grandmother used to just use water, but halfway into the meal, it was a nice tasting broth.\n\nThat said, if you really want to go to town on the broth, by all means go for it. In a self-serving way, I'd recommend this cookbook \"[Essential Chinese Hot Pot Cookbook](https://kneadandnosh.com/hotpot/)\" -- I published this in 2021. It's got lots of broth recipes.\n\nThe sesame paste is not tahini. While similar, the difference is that Chinese sesame paste is made from roasted sesame seeds whereas tahini is made from raw seeds. So, just as toasted sesame oil has a rich nutty aroma, Chinese sesame paste has that same aroma and it tastes richer. Tahini is blander in the same way plain sesame oil would taste that hadn't been roasted/toasted. If you are making the traditional sesame dipping sauce, you can fake it with tahini by substituting tahini plus some toasted sesame seed oil for the Chinese sesame paste. Try 1/4 cup tahini plus 1 tablespoon combined with 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil to make 1/2 cup of Chinese sesame paste.\n\nIn a hot pot restaurant, you'll typically see a sauce bar that is set up like an American salad bar. Lots of bins and containers with different things in them -- everything from sauces, oils, and vinegars to spices and aromatics like 5 spice powder, salt, sugar, ground Sichuan peppercorn, toasted sesame seeds, minced garlic, chopped cilantro, minced ginger, etc. The idea is that everyone can make their own dipping sauce. For your daughter, you might want to give her a couple options because she probably wants to show some autonomy, but I wouldn't go overboard because she may end up creating a whole bowl of some concoction that isn't palatable.\n\nSo, you could make the traditional sesame sauce (equal parts Chinese sesame paste and water, 1/3 part toasted sesame oil, a little sugar and a little sugar -- 1 tablespoon sesame paste, 1 tablespoon water, 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, 1/4 teaspoon sugar/brown sugar, pinch of salt). If you want to add a little red fermented bean curd, that's traditional too, but also an acquired taste. It's salty and has that fermented preserved funky-ness. \n\nThen, you could have some minced scallion, garlic, ginger, and toasted sesame seeds and let her add some tiny spoonfuls of some or all of these to it.\n\nOne common combo is some sesame sauce, chili oil, and Zhenjiang black vinegar, and perhaps some aromatics (garlic, ginger, scallion). The ratios vary by personal taste.", "i just wanna say, this is very sweet of you!", "ahh im jealous. im hundreds of miles from my parents so i miss hotpot with them.. we do it canto-style. its my favorite and i always ask for it when i go back during my birthday/christmas. enjoy your hotpot days with her :)", "Is very white different from regular white or just kinda white?", "I like eating mine with Chinese bbq sauce (kind from a can) with an egg yolk and tons of cilantro and scallions.", "This all depends on if you\u2019ve got a 99 ranch or H mart / some other big Asian grocer near you but if not mostly everything can be found online. \n\nBroth - you can do it from scratch but honestly nowadays hot pot is the meal you put together when you don\u2019t want to do a ton of prep work. You can just use some chicken bullion , garlic , ginger or look up either hidilao or little sheep - both are staple brands for broth - they can be quite salty tho so I\u2019d start with half the package in there and then add more if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s flavorful enough. \n\nMeat - you can find pre sliced meat at the Asian grocery store but here\u2019s the shocker - pre sliced meat is way marked up. You can buy a frozen meat slicer for cheap on Amazon too then head on over to Costco to get what ever , lamb , brisket  , steak up to you but doing it this way is a fourth of the cost in the long run especially if you\u2019re going to be doing it often. \n\nFish balls - most Asian grocers will have these in abundance. They\u2019re meat balls but made from seafood. Get what you think looks interesting. \n\nVegis - just chop up some water cress  or cabbage , bok choy , thin sheets of potato or sliced oyster mushrooms. I\u2019m a big fan of throwing enoki mushrooms in there. \n\nStarches - you can make some rice or go grab some noodles to throw in at the end when you\u2019re done with the meat and veggies - why at the end? Because the starch will come off the noodles when you cook it in the broth making it possibly too thick. So save it for when you\u2019re done with meat and vegis for the last round. \n\nThe pot - you can get one on Amazon - I\u2019m a fan of the ones where it\u2019s split in half so you can have two different broths. Some like it spicy , some don\u2019t. \n\nThe sauce - sauce is optional and everyone has their own way of doing it. Mine is a small spoon of sesame paste , tablespoon of soy sauce , garlic oil , chili oil and then topped with some cilantro and then thinned out a bit with what ever broth we\u2019re having for the night. \n\nActually making it - do all the prep work before , chop the veggies , make sure the meat is frozen so it slices cleanly on the meat cutter if you\u2019re doing it yourself and BE SAFE those blades are insanely sharp. Take the pot out put hot water in there and added your soup bases and just go at it. Remember you don\u2019t have to dump in everything all at once just cook what you want to eat for a few bites and then add more as needed - over cooked meat sucks and if sliced right a piece of lamb needs less than 10 seconds to cook to perfection in a rolling boil. \n\nThat\u2019s it - feel free to hit me up if you\u2019ve got any questions hot pot is how I survived the literal lockdowns in Wuhan China and still eating it now back here in Texas.", "What has her being white got to do with anything ?", "\u201cMy very white 8 year old daughter\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat a thing to say", "Thinly sliced hot pot meat can get very expensive, but I recently found thin cut meat at WalMart at a very good price.

We'd cook the meat first, which would add flavour to the water, then we'd cook veggies after we were done with meat. Noodles would be at the end and we'd eat them together with the soup. No rice because we already have noodles and we're northerners.\n\nChinese sesame paste is not the same as tahini. It has a more toasty and nutty flavour. We used to just use peanut butter and add sesame oil to it since it wasn't so easy to get Chinese products in shops here 30 years ago. We tried using tahini once and my parents hated it, but if that's all you can get I'd recommend adding toasted sesame oil to bump up the flavour. If you can find the Chinese sesame paste, you can put the jar in a bowl of hot water before opening to help loosen up the solids that settle in the bottom to make it easier to mix.\n\nI've never seen anyone use dry spices for dipping hot pot before.\n\nThe other essential condiment in my mind that nobody else has mentioned yet is garlic chive flower sauce \u97ed\u82b1\u9171.", "We bought a whole bunch of different asian hot pot broths including the Little Sheep ones. We couldn't really find one that we liked. Some were just pure chilli and oil. Others were so salty and fat laden with ingredients which weren't natural. One packet was so red and fat that the leftover broth just congealed in the sink. Pretty gross. I would make my own if I were you. The simplest one involves chicken broth and some umami flavoring like miso paste, a bit of soy sauce, sesame oil and green onions. You can make it saltier or spicier from that base. Personally I think the added flavor comes from the dips that accompany the food more than the broth. You can get cheap chicken bouillon paste from costco or get the cans from there. The rest of the stuff you can get from any asian supermarket including tons of hot pot ingredients like tofu, enoki mushrooms, fish balls, thin slices of meat etc", "Weird you reduced your 8 year old to her race instead of her love of cooking, which is an art and not reserved for any one race. :)", "As others have mentioned, a lot of broths would work for hotpot and there are some good prepackaged ones.

And there's not a fire extinguisher in sight.\n* You're seated on folding chairs around a card table and the entire menu is hand written in Chinese and pasted on the walls.  If you don't read Chinese, what you thought was chow mien might come back as braised duck feet in garlic sauce.\n\nThis was in the 70s/80s.

This brings me to point two - how elaborate or intentional their dishes are. I associate authentic Chinese food with medicine and expect to see balance of flavours, the use of many dried spices and herbs, and of course dried seafood and mushrooms. Also, foods that are described as \u201cnourishing\u201d or \u201ccooling\u201d or any of that kind of language are bonus for me. I don\u2019t often see Chinese fusion foods putting an emphasis on the body in their food.

I am not Chinese, but I love to order dishes with strong flavours and when a waiter tries to convince me to try a more \u201cWestern friendly\u201d dish, it\u2019s a good sign. I seldom order said dish, as the idea that this food wasn\u2019t made with my palate in mind says that the target audience is more native to that region. Sometimes I can\u2019t enjoy the dishes I order, but I always try them! Many times I discover flavours I really enjoy and the more I frequent, the more they know they can recommend dishes they would actually enjoy to me. There is a difference between dismissive and disbelief, as I don\u2019t like someone who is pushy.

In fact, you're much more likely to find standard chow meins like \u8c49\u6cb9\u7687\u7092\u9eb5 connected with Hong Kong.\n\nThis dish was absolutely standard in US Chinese restaurants by at least the 1910s.\n\nHere in Chan's [The Chinese Cook Book (published New York, 1917), on page 33](https://ia800100.us.archive.org/34/items/chinesecookbook00chan/chinesecookbook00chan.pdf), you can see a recipe for crispy/fried noodles with chicken gravy poured on top. It's called \"Chicken Fried Noodles\" in English and \u96de\u7092\u9eb5 in Chinese. The English name is random and not important. What's important is that the Chinese name is literally \"chicken chow mein.\" A few pages earlier, we get basic \"chow mein\" \u7092\u9eb5, which also has the noodles crispy fried. There is no stir-fried (literally chao/\u7092) noodles dish in the whole book.\n\nThis was, it appears therefore, the default \"chow mein\" in the Eastern US\u2014and, I would guess, in the neighboring Canada region (Ontario), at a time when \"Hong Kong\" had nothing to do with the Chinese immigrants and their food.\n\nThe takeaway is that not only is this not some \"Hong Kong\" thing but also that it was perfectly accepted as the referent of the term \"chow mein\" for the longest time. Soft/stir fried chow mein appears to have superseded it at some much later point, I guess from a newer trend in California, and weird names like \"Hong Kong-style\" came about to distinguish the two. Just like, in the northeastern US, \"lo mein\" was invented to distinguish soft/mixed/stir fried chow mein from this one.\n\nIn sum, in certain markets like Greater Toronto Area you might be forced to use regionally specific nicknames like \"Hong Kong-style chow mein\" since that's what evolved regionally, but since there is nothing inherently Hong Kong about it, that name won't necessarily be understood in *other* areas. If you see \u5169\u9762\u9ec3 on the menu then you've confirmed you've found it. But if the restaurant/menu chooses to indiscriminately call both stir-fried/mixed and deep-fried/crispy as \"chow mein\" then you have to ask or look for other hints. One hint is that if there is a seafood version, it is customary to make the seafood one with the crispy noodles and use the stir-fry/mix method for other meats.", "You have to find a Cantonese place, or HK place.

It almost reminds me of the sauce that comes with HK roast duck, although this is much thicker and not sweet.\n\nEDIT: I just looked through the [photos on Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/may-wah-fast-food-new-york-3) and it looks like they have a whole pot of this sauce:\n\n[[1]](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/may-wah-fast-food-new-york-3?select=357prVa5WPIOFYBXEuZcNA)\n\n[[2]](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/may-wah-fast-food-new-york-3?select=BAhVWNPZj8AHAOwiUXLT-Q)\n\nLooks like it is custom made, and is probably just their own brown sauce that doesn't have any particular name. But if anybody does happen to know the name of this sauce, I'd be happy to know. I'm also more interested in knowing what this sauce is made of.\n\nEDITEDIT: I see this is a very typical Taiwanese dish, either \u6ef7\u8089\u98ef (lu rou fan) or  \u8089\u71e5 (rou zao), dishes consisting of brined/marinated pork with preserved greens over rice, with the chicken leg actually as a side dish.

Then dessert or fruits after.", "My personal and unproven observation: Rice is the filler food that millions of people depended on when food was scarce. This meaning that it was never intended to be the main, but had to because it could be stored easily, was high in calories, and something something. Now that many countries and cities are better off than in the past, rice has become a reflection of the fact that it is not an entree. To use your examples, it isn\u2018t the hamburger bun because a hamburger isn\u2019t one without it (like how fried rice ain\u2019t the same thing without rice). Rather, is it the side salad you get in a meal or small bread basket you get before an entree is served. Excluding rice in your meal doesn\u2019t change the dish, it just changes your perception of what is a \u201cmeal\u201d. Korean BBQ when I was young (and poor) meant rice was always served first so that we would eat less meat. now that I can better afford more things, rice represents the fact that I couldn\u2018t eat what I really wanted when I went to Kbbq. That said..there are a lot of times when my soul doesn\u2019t feel full without rice", "[deleted]"]}

Sometimes it's too much, sometimes it's alright, and sometimes it's mild.\n\nBe wary of getting some frozen brands. Some of them turned the knob way up on the sweet aspect of it, so bad it tastes candy-like.

(To be clear, I don't think it's bad at all.)\n\nEthnic group is literally just a social group category that functions to distinguish said group from other such groups. Neither genetic heritage nor culture determine ethnicity. Only the recognition of the construct of such a group and who are members of the group is what makes it. The existence of the constructed group, yes, provides some association with genetics and culture\u2014due to the tendency for members of the ethnic group to interact/procreate more. But those things didn't create the group, which is why a person #1 belonging to Ethnic Group X can be hugely culturally different from a person #2 of Ethnic Group X.\n\nThat said, members of ethnic groups may select certain cultural products as representative symbols of their group, to make the perceived boundaries of the group appear mor coherent. That's why e.g. Chinese Americans, as a minority with greater concern for the visibility of their group, might hold onto certain symbols mor strongly, whereas Chinese in China, where it is not necessary to articulate the identity/existence of the group, are not/less concerned with those. Therefore, in a certain context, someone might think it's \"bad\" to signify in a way contrary to the ways that help to articulate their group.\n\nOn the other hand, culture is just signification and meaning, not at all limited to signifying social groupings. It is not co-terminous with sets of people. That is, it easily cuts across social/ethnic group boundaries.\n\nWhen people think ethnic group and genetics are absolutely co-terminous, and further conflate that genetic-ethnic group with culture, as if culture is rooted in biology, that's when we have a problem. (Basically, racism.) And I see that too often on these boards. \"Chinese food\" is a handy term to generalize a set of cultural tastes/preferences/asethetics. \n\nIn my opinion, orange chicken reasonably falls into that set, even if not at the center of it.

Mix the flour, yeast and oil together in a large bowl.\n2. Dissolve the sugar in the milk and pour into the flour mixture.\n3. Combine to form a rough ball with no dry flour left. Cover with a damp towel and leave to rest for 15 minutes.\n4. Finely chop the green onions (optional: mix with a pinch of baking powder to help them stay green during steaming).\n5. Knead the dough until the surface becomes smooth. Split into 2 and set one half aside covered with a damp towel. Knead the other until a shiny smooth ball forms. Switch, and repeat.\n6. Take the first ball and roll out into a 32x25cm rectangle.\n7. Use your hands or a brush to brush a very thin coating of oil onto the entire surface. Distribute chopped green onions evenly, sprinkle salt and (optional) Sichuan peppercorn powder.\n8. We're going to fold the 32 cm side into thirds. Fold one edge onto itself and then take the other edge and fold it onto the layer you just created. Like closing a brochure.\n9. Cut into 8 equal pieces. Cut each of the 8 pieces into 6 thin slices.\n10. Each bun uses 8 of these slices. Arrange the 8 slices in 2 layers: 4 on the bottom and 4 on top. Place them so that the 3 folded layers are facing the table and also facing you.\n11. Pinch the ends closed and gently stretch to to 1.5x the length. If you're right handed, twist clockwise and the dough will naturally curve inwards towards you into a circular shape and you should be able to align the 2 ends together. Pinch along where they meet and place downwards. Shape and pinch together any unattached areas. Repeat for all 6 buns. Leave to rest uncovered\n12. Repeat with the other half of the dough.\n13. Leave all 12 buns to proof uncovered until they've risen 1.5-2x in size (around 30 minutes). Prepare your steamer about 5 minutes before steaming so everything is preheated and the water is boiling.\n14. Steam on medium heat for 20 minutes. Close the heat and leave in the steamer for another 3 minutes.\n\nEnjoy! I like to eat it with fermented tofu but eat however you want :)\n\n\\*Notes on the ingredients:\n\n\\- Flour: if you want pale and super fluffy buns then you'll want to use a low gluten content flour. If you have access to Hong Kong flour (should be able to be found in asian grocery stores) then it's best. Cake flour also works well. All purpose/plain flour is absolutely fine to but if you want them fluffier then sub 2 tbsp of flour from the 375g with 2 tbsp of corn flour. I used 200g Hong Kong flour and 175g plain flour.\n\n\\- Baking powder: Some recipes use baking powder. This makes the texture more cake like and so I think it's great for sweet steamed buns but generally I don't add it for savoury ones. To me it's more 'home style' like this and has really nice slight chew which is how the ones made for me by family have always been. But it's completely up to you is you add a tsp or not.\n\n\\- Oil: Use a neutral oil, if you have duck fat/goose fat/lard that's also ok.\n\n\\- Milk: whole milk will make the fluffiest and best tasting buns that stay soft/re-steam the best. I generally just use whatever I have at home though. Water is fine and plant based milks works well to!\n\n\\- Filling: I didn't give measurements for the filling as usually for Chinese cooking its very much 'to taste' or however much you feel is good. But for a rough guide I would say about 1/3 cup green onions, 10g salt and 4g peppercorn powder :)", "Wow, forgot about those, I've had them a few times.  I love how this sub gives me random flashbacks of living in China.", "These are GORGEOUS! I loved watching you form the rolls. Definitely going to save this one to try myself :D", "What kind of yeast? Instant or active dry?", "Looks great", "Haven't had these in years and so glad I came across this.I'll be making these in a few days for the family.Thanks for the recipe!", "Wow these look amazing!

I always check if it's been in the fridge for a while", "I'll be honest, really good mapo tofu is supposed to be tart.  High quality sichuan peppercorns are both numbing and also quite sour (and floral), and the best mapo tofu dishes (in my opinion; shared with many others) are a perfect mix of sour, floral, salty, and umami/savoury flavours, as well as spicy.  If it is too sour and not salty, the balance is off, if it is too salty, and not tart enough - it is easy to hit flavour fatigue and you cannot eat very much before tiring.  The greatest interplay is between sour/salty/spicy to keep your palate engaged and to enjoy the dish to the last.  In fact when I make mapo tofu all of these flavour elements is dialled up to 11, and i enjoy extremely spicy, extremely sour/numbing, and a good balance of salty savouriness.  I am often very disappointed when ordering mapo tofu in restaurants as they often are just bland vaguely salty and boring dishes; they are missing the crucial element of tartness and numbing florality that high quality Sichuan peppercorns provide.", "The original posted recipe from them is WRONG - it calls for vinegar, which is not an ingredient in this dish.

The update also correctly calls for beef, not pork, and Chinese chili peppers, not powdered cayenne.  \n\nTo take things a step further, another major error in both recipes is failing to call for prepared chili oil.  Chinese chilis need *time* for their flavors to bloom in oil.  That means a couple weeks in contact with the oil before you use them to cook.  Putting dry chilis and plain oil into a wok and hoping their flavors will get to know each other by the time your stir-fry is done is a recipe for disappointment.  \n\n\n\nPeople on here are blaming pink Sichuan peppercorns for the \"tart\" flavor.

Right now the beef is sliced quite thick - aim for 2-3mm. Imagine your knife is, like, a deli slicer. This will seem quite difficult at first... try popping your beef in the freezer for 30-60 minutes beforehand before you slice.\n\n* Add a little salt to the marinade. This will not only improve the taste, but also the final texture (much in the same way a dry brine does).\n\n* There are other touches that I personally like to add to my marinade. Per ~200g, for specifically beef, my mix is something like 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp white or black pepper, 1/8 tsp Kan Sui lye water, 1/2 tsp oyster sauce, 1/4 tsp each light and dark soy sauce, 1/2 tsp Shaoxing wine, 1 tsp cornstarch, 1.5 tbsp water. The idea is to slap the water into the seasoned beef in order to completely saturate it, then everything can be coated with peanut oil.\n\nObviously you can find your own mix that you enjoy :) Happy cooking", "Looks pretty good to me id eat it for sure.

Way too soft", "Looks bomb i want some", "Beef looks dry and chewy son", "\ud83d\ude0b", "Delicious", "Looks restaurant quality!", "It looks fine for your first time, but here are some harsh tips if you want to improve on it\n\nDon\u2019t use sesame oil for a dish like this. Chinese cuisine does use sesame oil, but not as much as Korean cuisine as it is very pungent. Just use normal vegetable oil or canola. You can chicken powder/oyster sauce in the marinade for umami flavour\n\nI would also use egg whites in the marinade to help trap moisture in the beef\n\nConsider adding the vegetables only towards the end after blanching them since it looks too wet and overcooked. Too much cornstarch is coated onto the vegetables, they aren\u2019t meant to be this glossy\n\nOtherwise well done, happy cooking :)"]}

The dough will be a little bit sticky and should not be too dry.\n* Rest and chill for at least 1 hour before shaping.\n* Divide the dough into 10 equal portions \\~ 18-20gr (I prefer the thin crust, increase if you want the thick crust) => Round it into a ball\n* Dust the mooncake mold (Available on Amazon) with some flour to prevent sticking. Press the mold tightly 3 times, then place the cake on the baking paper, gently push the paste upwards to seal the filling tightly.\n* Coat the assembled ball with a thin layer of all-purpose flour.\n* Dust the mold with some flour to prevent sticking. Press the mold tightly 3 times, then place the cake in the baking paper.\n\n**Baking method:**\n\n1. Spray the cake with water evenly. Bake in preheated oven at 400F (200C) for 5 mins to harden the cake shape and sharpen the pattern on the surface.\n2. Take out, spray with water. Wait about 5 mins and brush with the egg wash a little bit (1 egg yolk + 1 tsp water). The tip is to use the pastry brush (not the silicone brush), so the egg wash won\u2019t ruin the delicate pattern.\n3. Bake at 330F (165C) for 5 mins. Take out, do the same above technique, spray-wait-brush egg wash.\n4. Bake at 300F (150C) for 10-12 mins or until the cake turns golden. The color will become more golden brown for 1-2 days later!\n5. Let it cool completely and store them in an air-tight container for 1-2 days.\n6. After 1-2 days, mooncakes become softer and gain a nice shiny appearance, It\u2019s called \u201cthe return of oil\u201d.\n7. Leftover mooncakes can be stored for up to 10 days in the fridge. Heat it up a little bit when serving.\n\n*(\\*) Adjust the temp and time depending on your oven*\n\n**My ratio of crust to filling for 50gr mooncake:**\n\n* Store-bought salted egg yolk - 12-15gr\n* Paste - 20gr\n* The (thin) crust - 15-18gr", "holy SHIT this looks so good. i love mooncakes. my boss\u2019s daughter loves them too, but she carves out the yolk and i die laughing every time", "I just can't understand why people actually use \"lye water\" in cooking or to drink.

This is the authentic Mapotofu recipe from Sichuan I think, the one with more oil and peppercorns. The step to make beef stock for example which takes 4-5 hours, I think that can be replaced by simply using ready made beef stock (or something like concentrated beef bone stock from wegmans).\n\nThe original recipe definitely calls for doubanjiang and Sichuan peppercorn as the key ingredients. However I usually replace doubanjiang with yellow soybean sauce and oyster sauce, they add a bit of sweetness to the dish. Most of the Chinese restaurants in the US make this version of Mapotofu instead unless you go to an authentic Sichuan restaurant, as people here like sweetness in their Chinese food. Sichuan people though usually don't like sweetness in their dishes."]}

Nearly everything that remains has that obnoxious \"Chinese restaurant font.\"  \n\n\nBut what better way to end a road trip than to scarf some old school American Chinese food, right? Only two restaurants remain, and one was considerably more interesting than the other.  \n\n\nThe inside brings one back to the comforting retro feel of those old places. Think: Red vinyl booths, fans, porcelain, dark corners and lanterns. I figured what the hey, the food probably wasn't great but it might bring some fun nostalgia.   \n\n\nNo Chinese on the menu. I go for the classic chow mein, and one can order the noodles \"soft,\" \"crispy,\" or \"Chinese style.\" Who knows what \"Chinese style\" is? I figure \"soft\" must be \"real\" chow mein (as is usually found in California), so \"crispy\" must mean the alternative \u5169\u9762\u9ec3 (pan fried) style. I could go for some fried noodles with a steaming pile of sauce on top.  \n\n\nThis is what I was given. To my shock, it had the hard La Choy fake noodle things on the bottom, which I thought was pretty much limited mostly to eastern parts of the US and Canada. What they threw on top was also a puzzle.

He looks to be in his 50s or 60s and *he's a takeaway delivery driver from Scotland who learned to cook by watching chefs cooking the food he was delivering.*\n\nThat's a classic movie trope; the student learning by watching the master.  Not being taught what to do, but *absorbing* the skill.\n\nHe had a friend make him a full-on wok burner with propane tank that he uses outside.  In his clips he seems to be wearing dark glasses, an overcoat and polished brown shoes.\n\nAll this is enough to like the channel, but the thing that sealed it is he has videos of *other people cooking.*  No commentary, just filming people cooking.  That shows a deep respect and interest, I think.\n\nI remember being shown the kitchen of a Chinese restauraunt here in London when was I was a kid.  We'd been going for years and I felt really *special* to be allowed to watch them.  It's stuck with me decades later.  I suspect he was struck by seeing the chefs in the same way I was, but he did something about it.\n\nHe even has a video of his local supermarket.   Not a tour, not an ingredient comparison video, just the shelves.

This recipe is dear to my heart because everytime I taste it, it reminds me of my Ma Ma. Chinese Cabbage Soup is very simple to put together and you'll only need a few ingredients, which is why it's perfect for a weeknight soup.\n\nYou can listen to the story and recipe [here](https://youtu.be/etO_yQ1EHis). You can also find the instructions with visuals [here](https://www.wokandkin.com/chinese-cabbage-soup/).\n\n**An Understated Yet Warm Experience**\n\nMum has always said that Grandma\u2019s soups were the best. After almost three decades of enjoying many full bowls (and often seconds) for dinner, I can say that she\u2019s 100% right.\n\nAll of my favorite soups (lotus root, chicken feet, fish maw and watercress) have a few things in common: they\u2019re humble, comforting and made with love. In my eyes, that makes a winning combo.\n\nBut there\u2019e just something about Grandma\u2019s Chinese Cabbage Soup that makes my body cheer with barely contained excitement whenever I see it brewing on the stove.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the silky leafy green that all but melts in your mouth as soon as it touches your tongue. Maybe it\u2019s the gentle savory undertones that have been unearthed from hours of slow simmering.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s the fact that such a simple soup will complement any dinner spread so that all you\u2019re left with are great conversations around the family table!\n\n**All About Chinese Cabbage (A.K.A. 'Siu Choy' In Cantonese)**\n\n**What Is It**\n\nChinese cabbage is a leafy vegetable that has a variety of names. In Australia, we sometimes call it \u2018wombok\u2019, but my Cantonese family has always referred to the green as siu choy (\u7d39\u83dc). You might also find it labelled as \u2018napa cabbage\u2019, which has Japanese origins.\n\nIt is often sold at Asian supermarkets in large bulbs or halved and wrapped in plastic. When uncooked, it\u2019s a firm pale vegetable with tender light green leaves. The leaves are connected by a firmer core which can also be eaten if cooked.\n\n**Taste**\n\nThere isn\u2019t much taste to siu choy but it\u2019s a popular culinary choice in Asian cuisine because when it\u2019s cooked with other ingredients, the leaves will absorb all the flavors.\n\nUnder a quick high heat they will also retain their crunch, much like when you stir fry water spinach or mustard greens.\n\nThe vegetable is great for soup stocks because of its natural sweetness. Mum always uses it to make a base stock for all her vegetarian recipes.\n\n**Health Benefits**\n\nYou\u2019ll be happy to know that wombok comes loaded with nutrients! For such a simple recipe, your family will enjoy the benefits of antioxidants and vitamins, including vitamins C and K.\n\nIt\u2019s also a natural source of potassium, iron, magnesium and calcium, which can assist with regulating bodily functions.\n\nMake these benefits a regular part of your family\u2019s diet with a delicious and nutritious Chinese Cabbage Soup!", "Thank you so much for sharing your Grandma's wonderful recipe!

Today I'm sharing Ma Ma's Steamed Chicken with Mushrooms and Dried Lily Flowers, a dish that I find absolute comfort in. I love how simple the flavor profile is and how easily it can pair with rice and other Cantonese side dishes!\n\nYou can listen to the story and recipe [here](https://youtu.be/SmqXfRaqK1c). You can also find the instructions with visuals [here](https://www.wokandkin.com/steamed-chicken-with-dried-lily-flowers/).\n\n**A Year-Round Favorite**\n\nDad\u2019s Steamed Chicken with Mushrooms and Dried Lily Flowers is a terrific weeknight favorite. It\u2019s one of those recipes you\u2019ll LOVE having in your back pocket because getting it on the dinner table is just so easy. First season, then steam and *voil\u00e0*.\n\nPlus, you\u2019ll only need a single dish so there\u2019s less washing up!\n\nIt\u2019s a year-round winner of a recipe for two reasons: (1) you get comforting flavors from the simple seasoning which is perfect for Winter and (2) the lily buds\u2019 light floral sweetness makes it a fantastic Spring meal.\n\nBut above all else, the chicken comes out silky smooth every time. It\u2019s reminiscent of eating velvet over rice.\n\nNo matter how many times we have this at home, it\u2019s a dish we always love!\n\n**The Recipe**\n\n* Prep Time: 15 minutes\n* Cook Time: 25 minutes\n* Rehydrating Time: 20 minutes\n* Total Time: 1 hour\n\n**Equipment**\n\n* Steamer\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 600 g / 1.3 lb chicken thigh\n* 20 g / 0.04 lb rehydrated shiitake mushrooms (sliced into 5mm/0.2\" slices)\n* 10 g / 0.02 rehydrated woodear mushrooms\n* 7 g / 0.015 lb rehydrated lily flowers (hard tips cut off)\n* 1/2 tsp sesame oil (or 1 tsp if you like a stronger sesame flavor)\n* 1 1/2 tbsp oil\n* 1 tsp salt (or to taste)\n* 1/2 tsp sugar (or to taste)\n* 1 1/4 tbsp oyster sauce\n* 1 tsp chicken bouillon powder\n\n**About The Ingredients**\n\nWe used chicken thigh for this recipe, but you can use whichever cut you like. Dad has used wings in the past and this dish will also work well with breast.\n\nYou can also lay slices of Chinese sausages on top to steam with everything.\n\nLook for all the ingredients in Asian supermarkets. As for the dehydrated ingredients, make sure that they\u2019re soaked in cool water for at least 20 minutes to soften.\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Mix all the ingredients together in a steam-safe dish, except for the flowers.\n2. Lay the dried lily flowers on top.\n3. Set up the steamer and place the dish in to steam for 25 minutes or until the chicken's just cooked. Note: Make sure the lid is on the whole time.\n4. When ready, serve hot as is!\n\n**Recipe FAQs**\n\n**How do I make this dish vegetarian?**\n\nYou can substitute the oyster sauce for a meatless option and replace the chicken with large mushrooms like king oyster or portobello.\n\n**Do I need to cover the dish with plastic wrap as it steams?**\n\nNo, just having a lid over the top will do. This also keeps the moisture circulating inside.\n\n**Can I make this in an instant pot?**\n\nYou sure can! I would suggest lowering the time to 3-4 minutes on the \u2018high pressure\u2019 setting, then a natural release for 10 minutes.\n\n**Tips For The Best Results**\n\n* **Keep the pieces uniform.** When cutting the meat, try to make them a similar size so they can cook evenly in the same amount of time.\n* **Opt for a fattier cut.** While breast meat is leaner, you\u2019ll get a juicer bite using thigh or wings.\n* **Use dehyrated rather than fresh mushrooms.** Being dehydrated means the flavor becomes quite concentrated, so rehydrating them will make that potent umami shine.", "Chicken & \u51ac\u83c7, a classic combo.

The scent of blossoming flowers, the warmth of a sun-kissed breeze, and the symphony of chirping birds remind us that we are part of a living, breathing world. In the balance between digital and physical realms, lies the key to harmonious existence. Democracy flourishes when human connection extends beyond screens and reaches out to touch souls. It is in the gentle embrace of a friend, the shared laughter over a cup of coffee, and the power of eye contact that the true essence of democracy is felt."]}

Like burgers. (The connection, besides the usual, is an association between Chinese restaurants in America and \"cheap\" food... which persists among people who always says \"takeout\" in the same breath as \"Chinese food,\" and even in the logo at the top left of this subreddit.) \n\nThis dumb \"joke\" originates in older times when, I suspect, more restaurants of all types actually did substitute non-standard meat. The racism is not totally about \"Chinese are weird and they eat weird things\" but partially about \"We think unscrupulous people do this and, by the way, we include Chinese among the people we consider unscrupulous.\" The joke is so old that yeah, it makes no sense in recent decades. It's lasted as a meme among people who know exactly ZERO Chinese people in their lives and, when the subject of anything Chinese comes up, they can only think of about 2-3 things to say. In other words, their repertoire of ethnic roasts is so small in the case of Chinese that's it's all they've got. *Polish are dumb, Irish are drunk, Chinese cook cats, har har. Please nod and give me affirmation that I have correctly voiced the stereotype.* Mostly the kind of humor you still see in Tyler Perry movies, which are themselves based in the old ethnic humor of blackface where a man dresses up like a fat old lady and \"hilarity ensues...\"\n\n2) A Chinese store near me (in USA) used to sell whole, frozen raccoons.

It is racism at play. Long history of the West being anti-Asian and trying to set themselves up as civilised and others as savage. Eating \u201cnormal\u201d foods like pork and chicken are fine, but because they view Asians as inhuman they can\u2019t fathom that they also eat these things, and highlight \u201cweird\u201d ingredients such as bugs and reptiles.\n\n2. Historically immigrants from China were not allowed to ascend in society beyond a certain point, therefore they were working class or poor. This led to the idea that \u201cnormal\u201d proteins were too expensive, and Chinese restaurant owners would cut costs by serving up rat and all kinds of mystery meat. I do know that there is a problem with fake foods manufactured in China for a Chinese market, but this is hardly the norm and to say that immigrants bring that practice over is racist.\n\n3. Unfamiliarity. As mentioned above, Westerners are afraid of \u201cweird\u201d foods and lack the interest in what they consider exotic cuisine. In many places, protein like duck or fish or bugs are totally mundane. But it\u2019s a bit of a novelty in the West. Obviously times have changed and people are much more varied in their perception of food, but this could be a lingering concept from times where Jello salads were all the rage. Cultures are different, and differences scare people.", "It\u2019s a racist trope that goes back more than a century.

If they cared so much they'd go vegan or something. \n\nBut the stereotype comes partially from lack of understanding of other cultures, and real shit a lot of cultural cuisines we eat here in restaurants in American are usually toned down/dumbed down versions of what the people of these cultures eat in their own countries. If you're from a big dirty city in America for example (New York, Baltimore, etc) your idea of a rats are rats on the street hiding out in dumpsters and in subways or whatever, if someone served you racid diseased filled rat or any other animal meat from a the streets you'd have way more problems to worry about than just food poisoning or at least an upset stomach. \n\nSpecifically the fear of rats in American culture comes from our perception of rats and where they come from. Do people eat rat in other cultures? Yes, but are they picking up dirty rats from city streets and cooking them up? No. I remember watching a documentary about China and how they would put traps out in fields to catch field rats or whatever. Also in China people should understand during the times of Moa and the communist revolution a lot of people in China were starving, they went through famine and had to scrape by on whatever. Until this day yes, there's advice that of you're ever in China be careful of where you eat at because things like gutter oil are very real, but that stuff comes from conditions you'll seldomly find in western countries. \n\nBut if you're American you probably find a lot of stuff from other cultures weird because lets be real, a lot of perceptions that Americans hold come from\nmedia, corporatized and not real culture, like the idea of a burger being an American thing and you have a ton of chain restaurants who's menus consist of nothing but chicken and beef. I remember working at a restaurant, now it was usual American fare, buffalo wings, burgers, chicken, you know the usual. But all of our cooks were hispanic guys and the rest of us were American born and bred. The cooks did not like to eat the food, they would bring in their own food and cook it, stuff they ate back in their home country (I think most of them were from Guatemala) nothing too weird, just stuff that you would find at any latino restaurant here. The weirdest thing I remember them making was like a fish stew where they kept the head on the fish, and of course everyone thought it was weird.\n\nIf you're American you probably find a lot of stuff that people eat weird, things that are also served up with no problem. For example if you go to an authentic Caribbean restaurant you can get curry goat usually, no one is coming in and telling those people that goat is bad to serve, but a lot of people here in America wouldn't touch goat. You're not going to find goat sitting between beef and chicken at your usual American supermarket. You go other places and certain birds that Americans would never touch are eaten, and they see nothing wrong about that. And yes some places they eat cat and dog but from the perspective of their culture that's not wrong. \n\nHell even here in America there are things that people eat by race, region, or whatever other factor that most people do not eat. Some people in certain parts of the country eat deer, turtle, alligator, parts of the animal that no one else eats. I'm black and my grandparents came from the south and grew up on farms. Older black people from the south eat things like chitterlings, pigs feet, ham hocks, chicken necks,  etc. Hell growing up, I remember my grandfather having a whole rabbit in the deep freezer for awhile, skinned and air tight packaged because in his time and how they came up that wasn't something that was nasty, it was something people who didn't have much (especially if you were black in America during my grandparents time) did, you got out and hunted or\nfarmer for your own.

Apparently, two of their chefs previously worked at Din Tai Fung, and it shows. The XLB was juicy and flavorful, comparable to DTF. Prices were cheaper, too.\n* **1st Dumpling & Noodle (Montclair, CA)** \\- Technically this is outside of the SGV, but close enough. Montclair isn't the first place you think of when it comes to Chinese food, but we were surprised by the quality of the handmade XLB here.\n* **P. P. Pop (Monterey Park, CA)** \\- This is the oldest restaurant on this list. The owner here also runs the popular Mr. Dragon Noodle House in Rosemead, CA, so we had high expectations. Unfortunately, the XLB fell flat for us (sometimes literally as the soup was leaking out).\n* **Thumbling (West Covina, CA)** \\- One of our favorites. The skin was thin like a balloon and there was enough soup to fill a spoonful. Highly recommend.\n\n[**Our channel may be found here**](https://www.youtube.com/@ShanonAndKevin) if you're interested in seeing more, including videos of each of the places listed above.

This project of means A LOT to me. I've been sharing my childhood memories in written form for a few years now, but it has been an exciting journey learning how to share my family's recipes through video.\n\nWhen I first learnt how to cook Grandma's Cantonese and Vietnamese recipes, she did all the cooking while I frantically scribbled down notes and learnt how to guesstimate her measurements because, as she always said, \"If you have a larger plate, use more. If you have a smaller plate, use less.\"\n\nBut these days, she doesn't cook anymore, so the footage of her helping me prep the ingredients while she's wearing her jade bracelet and gold ring really hits home every time I watch it.\n\nFast forward to 2022, I want to celebrate my memories of my 91yo Ma Ma's Braised Chicken Wings and Mushrooms. You can listen to the story and recipe [here](https://youtu.be/igVfGQZGDpw). You can also find the instructions with visuals [here](https://www.wokandkin.com/braised-chicken-wings-and-mushrooms-in-oyster-sauce/).\n\n**My Favorite Cantonese Side Dish**\n\nI\u2019ve never known a dish I\u2019ve loved more than Grandma\u2019s Braised Chicken Wings and Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce. The magic of this recipe doesn\u2019t just start when you taste it on steaming hot rice.\n\nIt starts when you lift the lid off the wok as the wings are gently braising in mushroom juices and you get that first waft\u2026its earthy aromas are just out of this world. And that\u2019s just the beginning!\n\nThe chicken is so silky it slides right off the bone then slowly melts in your mouth. The whole dish is cooked with oyster sauce, which gets infused in the mushrooms and transforms them into something spectacular. Think of a delicious thick, savoury glaze except it\u2019s inside the mushroom!\n\nOne bite and you\u2019ll fall in love.\n\nSeriously, just look at how the golden wings and mushrooms glow.\n\n**Which Chicken Cut Do I Use?**\n\nThe best part about this recipe is that you can use any cut of chicken you\u2019d like with oyster sauce and mushroom \u2013 breast, thigh, you name it.The reason why we choose wings above all the other cuts is because it has everything a tasty piece of chicken offers: a great meat to fat ratio and a way to cook straight from the bone.\n\nWe all know that anything cooked with the bone in tact tastes *so* much better.\n\nNow, if you prefer other chicken parts, this recipe will taste amazing with any of them!\n\n**How Can I Substitute Oyster Sauce?**\n\nI\u2019ll be completely honest\u2026you can\u2019t replicate the exquisite savoriness in a good oyster sauce. Luckily, they\u2019re fairly easy to come by in Asian supermarkets.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have oyster sauce handy in your pantry, don\u2019t panic! There are a few ways to get a flavor that resembles oyster sauce:\n\n* **Vegetarian oyster sauce.** Made exclusively from mushrooms, vegetarian flavoured mushroom sauce is a great alternative especially for vegetarians or anyone allergic to shellfish.\n* **Soy sauce.** While they\u2019re not exactly the same, you\u2019ll get the saltiness oyster sauce offers. Just use less than what you\u2019d normally add for oyster sauce and use some sugar to balance out the salt.\n* **Hoisin sauce.** The consistency of hoisin sauce is as thick as oyster sauce but has a sharp sweetness that can be adjusted with a little salt.", "Thank you for sharing.

{"title": "I recently bought 3 lbs of pork shoulder and made Char Siu for the first time. It turned out fantastic!", "selftext": "I\u2019ve always been a big fan of Char Siu and many Asian dishes in general, and with the holidays coming I decided to make it for the first time as my grocery store had pork shoulder on sale. I got 3lbs for $6 and then had to find a recipe that I trusted. I settled on two different recipes, from YouTubers whose other recipes I\u2019ve tried in the past and they\u2019ve been fantastic, Cooking With Lau and Souped Up Recipes, and since I couldn\u2019t decide which to make, I ended up making both, each with 1 \u00bdlbs of the pork shoulder. \n\nOne note, Souped Up Recipes recently updated her recipe as her initial recipe was one of her first videos and she recently changed it. I was also curious as the two recipes were really different and I wanted to know going forward which one gave me the results I was desiring. \n\nBoth were pretty easy to make, but just required wait time between the initial preparation and the cooking process. Cooking With Lau\u2019s was the easier of the two as the prep was basically mixing a marinade in a bowl, then pouring it into a ziploc bag and adding the meat, whereas Souped Up Recipes required mixing the marinade in a sauce pan and cooking it down before adding it to a ziploc bag with the meat. After that, the recipes were similar so I made them both at the same time. \n\nThe only noticeable difference for me from their recipes was that mine needed about 10-15 more minutes in the oven to reach my internal temperature goal of 170\u00b0F. Yes, pork is technically done before that temperature, but after doing some reading online, I desired that temperature so that the fat could render a bit more. \n\nEnd result was fantastic! Both were great, which made me happily frustrated as I was hoping one would be a clear cut winner, but it left me with 3lbs of pure Char Siu deliciousness for a fraction of the price that my local Chinese Food restaurants charge. \n\nIn the photos, Cooking With Lau on the left, Souped Up Recipes on the right\n\nRecipes:\nCooking With Lau:\nhttps://youtu.be/zkCoAKTbHpQ?si=etAvg5YGpzEYne7J\nSouped Up Recipes:\nhttps://youtu.be/umFzNSE194c?si=zvPc1yZk_felsa4K", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmrn6n", "created_utc": 1735229854.0, "score": 188, "author": "Drawing_The_Line", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1hmrn6n/i_recently_bought_3_lbs_of_pork_shoulder_and_made/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Looks fantastic - hope you're making some fried rice with them next!", "Love a bit of charsu", "[deleted]", "I don't live near a Chinatown so I make it myself, too.

Of course, chow mein is a recurring discussion (but one of the stupid things about Reddit is that threads get buried, and history is doomed to repeat).*\n\nSo\u2026 this is an admittedly not-quite-successful attempt I made to cook \u201cchow mein\u201d as per the directions in Shiu Wong Chan\u2019s historic 1917 *The Chinese Cook Book*\u2014the first cookbook written by a Chinese in America (in New York City, to be precise). It\u2019s a time capsule of what Chinese cooking was like way back before egg rolls were invented, before General Tso\u2019s was a thing, before Orange Chicken was a thing\u2026 before American-style Chinese restaurant food had standardized. What it contains is complicated: On one hand, there seems to be gestures clearly intended to cater to the means of (non-Chinese) American home cooks and the expectations of New York diners at contemporary Chinese restaurants, while on the other hand there are so many relatively obscure and China-style recipes, remarks, and language that suggest the author was either too fresh off the boat and oblivious to what we imagine American Chinese food was OR\u2014more interesting to think\u2014American Chinese restaurant food at that early date was quite different than we might imagine it.\n\n\u201cChop Suey,\u201d of course, was a thing at that time, if not THE thing. But rather than tie that name to the Chinese phrase \u96dc\u788e (zaap seoi in Cantonese), he names dishes like \u201cBeef Chop Suey\u201d \u7092\u725b\u8089\u7247 lit. \u201cstir fried beef slices\u201d and \u201cPlain Chop Suey\u201d or \u201cFARN CHOP\u201d ~~\u9999\u96dc lit. \u201cfragrant miscellaneous.\u201d\\*\\*~~\n\n\\[\\[EDIT: I misread. It says \u756a\u96dc so like \"faan zaap\" in Cantonese orthography and meaning something like \"Foreign miscellaneous\"\u2014which could be interesting again: Chan, in Chinese, may be calling out \"chop suey\" as a foreign dish.\\]\\]\n\nThat background aside, the interesting thing about the \u201cchow mein\u201d\u2014Chan calls it \u201cFried Noodles\u201d in English and \u7092\u9eb5 in Chinese\u2014is that it\u2019s always deep-fried/crispy. There is no mention among the 150 recipes of any chow mein in the most common form, i.e. stir-fried, mixed, soft noodles. (And no sort of \u201clo mein.\u201d)\n\nWe do know that \u201cboth\u201d versions of chow mein (the noodles deep- or pan-fried and crispy\u2014properly called \u5169\u9762\u9ec3\u2014and stir-fried soft\u2014the literal meaning of \u7092\u9eb5) were (?) in existence as China Chinese dishes, so this provokes the question of why (seemingly) all \u201cchow mein\u201d of New York 1910s had taken the form of the fried crispy noodles. For comparative reference: Jessie Louise Nolton\u2019s 1911 cookbook (Detroit) has chow mein also as pan-fried (pancake form) and Vernon Galster's 1917 cookbook (Illinois) had \u201cChow Mein (Fried Noodles Covered with Chop Suey).\u201d\n\nChan\u2019s recipe (2 pages) is included in the photos here.\n\n**I sought only to follow Chan\u2019s recipe** as a matter of interest while avoiding my own sense of what the dish should be. The knife work leaves much to be desired.\n\nThis is Chan\u2019s \u201cCHICKEN FRIED NOODLES\u201d or \u201cGuy Chow Min\u201d or \u96de\u7092\u9eb5.\n\n~~\\*\\*Maybe the spelling of \u201cfarn\u201d for \u9999 is a clue to Chan\u2019s native language? This would be xiang in Mandarin pinyin or heung in Cantonese. I suppose Chan would be part of the Toishan migration, but I don\u2019t know how that word sounds in Toishanese.~~", "It looks like the basis for liangmian huang or yellow on both sides crispy noodles, aka typical Cantonese/HK crispy noodles, just with whatever was available back then locally perhaps or what the author seemed to remember", "It's legit so cool that you recreated this. It looks good! Idk if I missed it somewhere in reading your comments, but how did it taste overall? The variation in texture seems like it would be interesting.\n\nEdit: I would also share this in r/oldrecipes, I bet they'd be interested", "Looks interesting! \n\nWhat is \u201cChinese sauce\u201d and \u201cprimary soup\u201d?", "I wish I could upvote this a million times", "Great post, and nice discussion!", "Looks good but more like \"\u714e\u9762\" than \u201c\u7092\u9762\u201d."]}

The little piece in the picture is probably more cooked than the thicc piece at the bottom.\n\nWhen I make char siu, I make it in a charcoal grill. I start of the meat on the indirect heat side and I glaze it every 5-7 mins. On the second glaze, i check the temp. I keep glazing and checking the temp until its about 5 degrees below my desired temp. Lastly, i move the meat to the direct heat side to give it a char. Usually takes only a min since there's so many layers of glaze. I usually target 135 degrees before i move the meat to the direct heat side. When I take it off the grill, its usually in the range of 140-143. Let it rest for 5-10 mins and serve."]}

So I started to do some research and found an article from the book: **Handbook of Plant-Based Fermented Food and Beverage Technology, Second Edition.**\n\nOn page 449-451 the process of the Chinese steamed buns is described:\n\n***32.5.2*** ***Yeast Chinese Steamed Buns***\n\n*There are two methods to prepare yeast CSB: one mixing step and two mixing steps. Both methods are described herein. The ingredient ratios in the formulas below may be adjusted as needed.*\n\n***32.5.2.1*** ***One Mixing Step***\n\n*Ingredients: Soft wheat flour 600 g, baking powder 10 g, sugar 80 g, active dry yeast 10 g, shortening 20 g, and warm water 300 g. Method: The yeast is activated by adding yeast into dissolved sugar solution. When the gas is produced and foam is formed, a mixture of wheat flour and baking powder is added and mixed. Then shortening is added and stirred until a stiff dough is formed. The dough is covered with a moistened cotton sheet and left to stand for 2 hours. After that, the dough is divided into 25\u201330 g each and rolled into a ball. Each ball is flattened into a 3-inch disc by hand or using a small wooden roller (Figure 32.14). For the sweet-type filling, it is necessary to shape the disc in a way that the center is thicker than the edges, while for savory type filling, the disc is shaped to give even thickness. Then the filling is added (Figure 32.15), and the edge is folded together in a sort of pleated style (Figures 32.16 and 32.17). Each bun is then placed on a square of white paper. For the savory type filling, the pleated surface is usually on top of the bun, whereas for the sweet type, the pleated surface is at the bottom. Thus, the sweet type bun will have a smooth and round top. Then, both types of buns are proofed at 30\u00b0C around 1 hour. Before consuming, the buns are steamed for 15\u201320 minutes in a steamer (Figure 32.18).*\n\nSource: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289247998\\_Chinese\\_Steamed\\_Buns](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289247998_Chinese_Steamed_Buns)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was first a bit skeptical because of the amount of sugar, yeast and baking powder. But in the end, they were really good. In my opinion, a bit too much baking powder which I would cut by half.\n\nThe flour I used was from Red Lotus, the special flour for steamed buns. But I made good experience with mixing cake flour and wheat starch, to bring down the protein content to about 8-8,5 g.\n\nI was really surprised by the skin. In my previous attempts, it was tougher. here it was really silky and super super thin. Just like I wanted.\n\nI also have to clean up with a myth here. In a lot of recipes, they tell you NOT to lift the lid of the bamboo steamer (for 5-10 minutes (it varies)), otherwise, they will collapse. Guess what, after steaming I do exactly this and they never ever collapsed. So, forgive me for my fool language but I call bullshit on this. If they collapse there was something else wrong.\n\nI steamed for 17 minutes, btw.", "I could have swore that you bought this at a restaurant. Looks so good.", "looks like there is a lot of meat in them. if it is, your baozi is way above baozi that you can buy on streets. i dont like baozi with very small amount of meat but ill buy yours haha", "They look perfect! Every time I make them 1/2 of them end up with wrinkled skin.  :(", "Omg yummmmmm", "Wow those looks incredible! What was your kneading process like? I know that red lotus flour is Thai and super white, but how did it fair against kneading being a flour with such low protein?

I actually think the fragrance and flavor of fresh bird's eye or other hot chilies would change the overall character of the dish, so flakes are the way I would go. You could either add roasted dried red Thai chili flakes to the dish itself or make your own chili oil using unroasted Thai chili flakes. \n\nIf it's too much trouble to make a sauce, [this](https://www.amazon.com/BUTTERFLY-Pepper-Sa-Te-Sauce-Chieu/dp/B09GXXKYV3) Butterfly brand Teo Chew style sa-te sauce is the hottest Chinese chili sauce I have ever tried.

It's just a self-fulfilling prophecy happening in recent decades. (Several other provinces along the Yangtze usually eat spicier).

Trim any fat off the skin, scrape both sides clean, and cut into 1-inch squares. Discard the water.\n\nPlace the pork skin cubes and 750g fresh water into a blender and blend on smoothie setting until the mixture achieves a creamy consistency. Transfer this mixture into a small nonstick pot and simmer on low with the lid on for 45 minutes.\n\nAllow the broth to cool to room temperature, then strain it through a large fine mesh strainer into a container. Press down the bits caught by the strainer with a spatula to get the most liquid out. Discard anything that\u2019s left in the strainer and store the broth in the fridge for at least 2 hours, until it sets like jello. *If you didn\u2019t use enough pork skin and the stock isn\u2019t firmly set, or if you\u2019re new to folding soup dumplings, add 2 packets of flavorless gelatin powder to the broth after you strain it, stir until well combined, and let it set in the fridge.*\n\n**WRAPPER INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\nAdd the salt to the bread flour and mix well. *You can use all-purpose flour here, but keep in mind the dough will be less sturdy and the dumplings will have a higher chance of leaking when steamed.*\n\nSlowly pour the water over the flour mixture while mixing with a non-stick spatula until clumps form and very little powdery flour is visible.\n\nKnead the dough with your hand until a smooth consistency is reached, for about 5 minutes.\n\nRoll the dough into a ball, cover with cling wrap, and let it rest for 25 minutes in room temperature.\n\n**FILLING INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\nCombine all the filling ingredients except the gelatin broth and mix with a spatula in one direction for 5 minutes, until the proteins from the ground pork are released and the mixture becomes sticky to itself.\n\nRoughly chop the 250g gelatin broth (after it\u2019s set) into quarter inch cubes, add them to the rest of the filling, and mix until well-incorporated. Place the filling in the freezer for 25 minutes.\n\n**ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\nPunch a hole at the center of the dough ball, and slowly stretch the dough out from all sides, working the dough into a large donut shape. Break the dough at one spot and continue working it into a rope.  \n\nDivide the dough into 10g portions, roll it into a tiny ball, and press down with your palm to form a small flat circle. Dust with extra flour as needed to prevent sticking.\n\nIf you\u2019re right-handed, work the rolling pin with your right hand and turn the small circle with your left hand after each roll. This way the wrapper has a slight cone shape and is thin along the edges. Finished wrappers should be 4 inches in diameter. For a visual guide, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltfMi1feSUs).\u00a0\n\n*As with all dumplings, it\u2019s nice if you have a helper so that one person can roll out the wrappers and another person can wrap. If you don\u2019t have that luxury, be sure to cover any dough you\u2019re not working on with cling wrap to prevent it from drying out. As a shortcut, you can skip the above assembly instructions all together, use a pasta maker to press the dough into a one-sixteenth-inch thin sheet, and cut using a cookie cutter 4 inches in diameter; however, just keep in mind the edges will be thicker than the hand-rolled version and you\u2019ll end up with more dough at the top of your soup dumplings.*\n\nTo fold the dumplings, hold a wrapper (cone facing up) with your left hand and spread approximately 2 teaspoons of filling into a 2-inch circle at the center of the wrapper. *It seems counterintuitive but spread-out filling is easier to wrap. To better portion the filling, I used a 1 \u00bc inch cookie-dough scoop with spring release and spread the filling out with the bottom of the scoop.*\n\nAs you\u2019re folding each dumpling, push the underside of the wrapper with your left index finger to create the fold, then use your right thumb and index finger to pinch the folds together. As you pinch, lift your left ring and middle finger to rotate the dumpling clockwise, so by the time you\u2019re done the dumpling should\u2019ve made a 360 degree turn in your left hand. *I prefer to close the eye at the end so that soup won\u2019t escape from the top. but it\u2019s up to you.* For a visual guide, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R98LqTH00ys). \n\nWith water in the steamer already boiling, steam the dumplings for 6 minutes on medium heat, then turn off the heat let them rest for 2 minutes with the lid still on. *Do not steam on high, as you risk popping the dumplings as the steam inside expands.*\n\nOnce steamed, these dumplings cannot be stored and must be consumed right away; however, you can freeze the uncooked ones for up to two weeks in the freezer. I like to dust a disposable mini-cupcakes container with some flour and place a dumpling in each spot. Since they\u2019re frozen, you\u2019ll need to steam them for 10 minutes on medium heat, and rest for 2 minutes with the lid on before serving."]}

Here are the instructions with [visuals](https://www.wokandkin.com/braised-chicken-with-mushrooms-black-fungus-and-lily-flowers/). \n\n**Cantonese Comfort Food at its Best**\n\nBraising and oyster sauce are the true magical wonders of Cantonese cuisine. Those two alone can turn ANY recipe into the most succulent eating experience known to mankind.\n\nThey\u2019re the reasons why this dish is every bit melt-in-your-mouth and lip-smackingly delicious.\n\nIt really is a thing of beauty because it\u2019s incredibly simple to make and not a single piece of meat is left dry.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll end up with deeply savory wings enveloped in a floral aroma that just falls off the bone as soon as they\u2019re in your mouth.\n\nNow *that\u2019s* true comfort food!\n\n**Time and Servings**\n\n* Prep Time: 30 minutes\n* Cook Time: 40 minutes\n* Rehydration Time: 20 minutes\n* Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes\n* Servings: 6\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 1/2 kg / 3.3 lb chicken wings\n* 6 cloves garlic (finely chopped)\n* 30 g / 0.06 lb rehydrated shiitake mushrooms\n* 10 g / 0.02 lb rehydrated black fungus mushroom (wood ear mushroom)\n* 20 g / 0.04 lb rehydrated dried lily flowers\n* 3/4 tbsp chicken bouillon powder\n* 1 tbsp sugar (or to taste)\n* 3/4 tsp salt (or to taste)\n* 3/4 US cup water (or chicken stock)\n* 1 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce\n* 4 tbsp oyster sauce\n* 3 tbsp cooking oil\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Marinate the wings with the salt, sugar, chicken bouillon powder and 3 tbsp oyster sauce for a minimum of 20 minutes.\n2. Squeeze the liquid out of the rehydrated mushrooms.\n3. Cut the hard ends off the lily buds.\n4. Pour the oil into a wok on medium heat and brown the garlic for 1 minute or until aromatic.\n5. Turn up the heat to high and add the wings in to cook for 3 minutes, stirring every minute to sear all sides.\n6. Pour the water in and season with dark soy sauce and 1 tbsp oyster sauce. Mix well and simmer on medium heat for 2 minutes.\n7. Add the dried lily flowers, mushrooms and black fungus in. Stir and cook on a low-medium heat.\n8. Simmer for 30 minutes or until the wings are soft.\n9. Serve hot with rice!\n\n**Recipe Notes**\n\n* **Keep the chicken close to room temperature.** This gives the chance for the muscles to relax so you don't end up with tough pieces of meat.\n* **Use a fattier cut.** The more fat, the juicier the dish will be! We also prefer using chicken on the bone for the best flavor.\n* **Marinate the meat overnight.** Not only will the seasoning be infused deeply, the oyster sauce will give it a wonderful gloss.\n* You can buy the black fungus, dried shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers from the dehydrated goods section in Asian supermarkets. For this recipe, they need to be rehydrated in warm water for 20 minutes.", "That looks amazing!! Thank you for sharing.", "Mmm...oh man.  My mom makes the best.  Miss it so much.", "Looks amazing!

The vast majority of Chinese takeout places (and eat in places) make their soup stock from three ingredients: bullion powder, corn starch, and water. Water goes into the wok and is heated, a ton of bullion powder is added with a wok spoon, then starch and cold water are mixed in that same spoon to make a slurry and then the slurry is mixed in. They aren't making bone broth, they aren't using gelatin (it's expensive), they aren't adding vegetables to the stock. The mouth feel is 100% from the starch. The flavor is 100% from pushing the limit on how much bullion powder can go in. \n\nEven in China this is how places with 120 items on the menu do it. Real stock is almost solely made in high end places or places that specialize in noodle soup dishes, and those places will have very large stock pots that are more or less always in the process of making more stock going, often in view of the customers, as Chinese people generally assume that anything they haven't had direct evidence of not being shortcutted has been shortcutted, and they do care about their food.\n\nDried seafood or dried mushrooms are often used in China to make certain broths, but they are not added to egg drop or wonton soups in US takeout places ever. Those items give a different flavor for particular soups, they aren't just used willy nilly in a restaurant. The most popular bullion brand is Knorr, by the way, but Knorr makes different bullion products for different regions and because chicken bullion is 100% a staple item on a Chinese takeout mis they generally find the Chinese version of Knorr and stock that.\n\nhttps://unidexmobile.com/img/products/U000400.jpg", "A cornstarch slurry will add thickness to the the broth just be careful not to add too much or it\u2019ll get too thick.

This is something that\u2019s been extensively researched and written about. Have you asked a librarian?", "If you don't do any actual research this is just going to be a bunch of shit. Sorry. People have tons of nonsense myths and many of them are in the comments here.\n\nTo me, the cause of those myths is just as interesting\u2014 non-Chinese Americans trying to look smart and ahead of the curve by lapping up any idea that suggests a Chinese style dish is a fake American invention, mixed with insecure Chinese-heritage Americans who want to distance themselves and sound exclusive. Add to that hipsters who do a \"Well, actually...\" and think they're being cooler than cool by shoehorning a narrative about something being secretly authentic that their square family members thought was inauthentic. Either it's \"America is so bad and bastardized things for dumb Americans and through hardship of poor Chinese\" or \"Yay, let's celebrate the wonderful diversity and adaptation!\" No facts.\n\nThere are academic books. Not 100% definitive, but they include primary source research from period documents to save you the work. You said your university library is closed but this stuff is online. The American Food Channel on YouTube by Kristy is not in academia but she does true research with such documents. One document is the earliest cookbook written by a Chinese in America, published by Chan in New York in 1917. I've cooked a couple dozen dishes from it and it's eye-opening\u2014especially when you compare the Chinese and English names of things.\n\nPeople tend to be narrowly focused on assumptions based on more modern cooking from central areas of Guangdong, and miss the influences from other regions of China. Bigger problem is making up assumptions about American Chinese food evolutions without actually knowing about the food in China.\n\nMy advice is to follow your plan to focus on one dish. Research the hell out of it with a narrow focus (for the sake of time) and avoid sticking it into any of the narratives.\n\nOne interesting thing is the advent of the idea of \"Szechuan\" food in America, a sort of bogus trend mediated by Cantonese restaurants. There was no actual Sichuan food in America until fairly recently but for some reason (for you to discover) all these restaurants thought it would be fashionable to throw around \"Szechuan\" and \"Hunan\" in their titles and on their menus.\n\n  \nAnother interesting story about so-called almond cookies. I once researched how an almond cookie was popularized at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. Visitors to the China-land part of the world's fair went away with the recipe and it was touted in newspapers, and you can see how it spread. And then see how the famous almond cookies of Macao are very different. You can see how the different cookbook writers varied the recipe to come closer to Chinese or Anglo aesthetics. And I tried cooking these various recipes as well as buying versions from stores.\n\nSo final thought: Since it sounds like you'll need to BS this project a little bit, you could consider cooking one of the dishes as part of the project and feeding it to your family members and getting their reaction. That could make up for what you lack in text-style research, and practical research is just as valid."]}

Massage the beef with your hands until all the liquid is absorbed. Mix in 1 \u00bd teaspoons cornstarch, 2 teaspoons oil, and 1 teaspoon oyster sauce, and set aside to marinate for at least 30 minutes.\nMake the sauce mixture by mixing together the chicken stock, sugar, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and white pepper. Set aside.\nBring 6 cups of water to a boil and blanch your broccoli for 30 to 60 seconds (depending on whether you like your broccoli crunchy or a little soft). Drain and set aside.\n\nHeat your wok over high heat until smoking. Add 2 tablespoons oil and sear the beef on both sides until browned (this should only take 2-3 minutes). Turn off the heat, remove the beef from the wok, and set aside.\n\nSet the wok over medium heat and add another tablespoon of oil along with the garlic and ginger (if using). Stir the garlic and ginger for 5 seconds and then pour the Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the wok.\n\nNext, add in the sauce mixture you made earlier. Stir the sauce around the sides of the wok to deglaze it (all those nice bits from stir-frying the beef should be absorbed into the sauce). Bring the sauce to a simmer. Stir the cornstarch and water into a slurry to ensure it\u2019s well combined, and drizzle the mixture into sauce while stirring constantly. Allow it to simmer and thicken for 20 seconds.\n\nToss in the blanched broccoli and seared beef (along with any juices). Mix everything together over medium heat until the sauce coats the beef and broccoli. If the sauce seems thin, turn up the heat and reduce it further, or add a bit more cornstarch slurry. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of chicken stock or water.

The oil should be at about 225-250\u00b0 F / 110-120\u00b0 C and causing small bubbles to slowly rise from the aromatics. If you notice the spices sizzling more vigorously than that or turning dark too quickly, reduce the heat to cool it down. If you are not achieving small bubbles, slowly increase the heat. Hovering around 200-225\u00b0 F is the safest way to prevent burning. Infuse the aromatics this way for a minimum of 30 minutes, or up to 1 hour for best results. Drain the oil and throw away the aromatics, although the garlic cloves and shallots are delicious spread on toast with a pinch of salt.\n\nHeat a heavy skillet over medium heat. You are going to toast the rest of the ingredients in batches, and it is important that you don't burn them. It is easy to toast chile flakes too long and ruin them, giving them a bitter, acrid flavor. You can toast the chile flakes or sesame seeds together or separately, the sesame seeds take a little longer to reach maximum flavor. Toast your chile flakes while stirring often often, 3 to 5 minutes. Be sure and sample them often and if they start to taste bitter at all, pour them on a plat to rapidly cool them.\n\nDo the same thing with the sesame seeds, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, put the rest of the ingredients in a coffee grinder or food processor and grind finely. When the sesame seeds are done, pour them on the plate with the chile flakes.\n\nAdd the rest of the dry ingredients to the pan and toast for a minute or two more, until fragrant. Combine the chile flakes, sesame seeds, and oil to the pan and keep it on the heat for a minute or two more to infuse, again sampling often to avoid burning. Remove from the heat and let cool in the pan. After it's cool, pour in a jar and seal. The flavor will continue to change and improve over the first few days of storage\n\nThe aromatic infusion step was taken from this recipe:\n\n[https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-chili-oil/](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-chili-oil/)\n\nHere is the version 1 recipe:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/lki8xq/chili\\_crisp\\_lao\\_gan\\_ma\\_copy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/lki8xq/chili_crisp_lao_gan_ma_copy/)", "This looks awesome!  I\u2019m almost through the gallon of copycat chili crisp w/ black bean I made a year ago.

It has *almost none* of the aromatics like yours does, so I can\u2019t wait to try making it your way and seeing how it compares!", "zhong xina's favorite meal"]}

Do you have a recipe you can share?", "For those interested, here's the recipe!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\- 2 cups flour \n\n\\- 1 cup water\n\n\\- 1 teaspoon yeast\n\n\\- 2 teaspoons sugar\n\n\\- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n\\- salt\n\n\\- five spice powder\n\n\\- green onions\n\n\\- sesame seeds\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Steps:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- Make yeast mixture --\n\n1. Get 1 cup of warm water.\n\n2. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and stir for a few seconds.\n\n3. Add 1 teaspoon of yeast and stir for a few seconds.\n\n4. Set aside and let water, sugar, yeast mixture rest for 10 minutes. You'll notice a thin layer of foam forming at the top. This is good!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- Make dough --\n\n5. Get a mixing bowl and add 2 cups of all-purpose flour.\n\n6. Add in 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder. Then pour in water, sugar, yeast mixture.\n\n7. Mix - use spatula to start so your hands don't get sticky.\n\n8. Knead dough for a few minutes. Periodically add flour if it starts getting too sticky. \n\n9. Once kneaded, cover and let rest for 30 minutes. Don't worry if the surface looks a little lumpy!\n\n(30 minutes later...)\n\n10. You'll notice it's gotten bigger. This is the yeast doing its work. Pour on some oil and start kneading again.\n\n11. Knead until oil's completely integrated with dough.\n\n12. Cover and let rest for 2 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- Prepare green onions --\n\n13. Chop up some green onions. We used 5 stalks as a happy medium. You can use more/less depending on your preference.\n\n14. Add oil to pan and turn to medium heat. Once hot, pour in green onions.\n\n15. Saute with 1/2 teaspoon of salt until it starts to brown. Green onion cooks very quickly! Once done, pour into bowl and set aside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- Assemble the bread --\n\n16. Uncover the rested dough and start punching out the air. Transfer to cutting board and roll into a strip.\n\n17. Cut evenly into 8 pieces.\n\n18. Knead each piece into a ball and set aside to rest for 15 minutes. Make sure it's covered while it's resting.\n\n(15 minutes later...)\n\n19. Take a dough and flatten into a rectangular shape using a rolling pin.\n\n20. Spread green onions over the whole thing.\n\n21. Add a pinch of salt - sprinkled evenly over the whole thing. Do the same with five spice. This makes a huge difference in flavor!\n\n22. Lift up the long side and start rolling it into a... roll. Once the roll is formed, roll it into a swirl (like a cinnamon roll). Keep the crease inside as you roll it to prevent green onions from leaking out later on when you flatten it.\n\n23. Flatten with rolling pin.\n\n24. Add sesame seeds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- Cook the bread --\n\n25. Heat pan over low heat and add oil. Very important that it's on low heat so the outside doesn't burn while the inside is still cooking.\n\n26. Place flattened breads into pan and cover lid (side by side, don't stack them).\n\n27. Cook each side for 4 minutes.\n\n28. Add some water then cover lid. This steams the inside and makes bread soft.\n\n29. Continue flipping to get your desired level of crispness. When surface is golden brown on both sides, it's ready.\n\n30. Remove from pan and you're done! They're extremely hot so let rest a few minutes before biting into one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Here's a video link for those who learn better by watching](https://youtu.be/TVErSvKp-bk)", "I had a go at this once.

Combine golden syrup and lye water in a large bowl and mix until emulsified.\n2. Add oil and mix well.\n3. Using a sieve, add all the flour at once to the mixture. Fold until combined. Rest for 30 minutes.\n4. Divide the dough into 20 equal portions. You can use the kitchen scale to make this easier. Roll each portion into a ball.\n5. Cover one ball with plastic wrap or dust with flour and roll it out into a thin circle. Flour might make the texture gritty, so try to use plastic wrap. You can reuse the same one for each dough ball. Preheat the oven to 180 \u00b0C (or 355 \u00b0F).\n6. For Salted Egg Yolk Filling Mooncake: Roll the lotus paste into as many balls as there are egg yolks (4 in this case). The paste balls should be smaller than the dough balls. Poke a hole in each one and insert a salted egg yolk (or 2 yolk halves). Seal the lotus paste in the dough disc.\n7. For White Lotus, Red Bean, Green Tea and Wu Ren Fillings: Roll the filling paste into a long tube. Cut it so that it matches the desired number of mooncakes. Roll each piece into a ball. Seal each ball in a dough disc.\n8. Oil and flour your mould. Place the filling-sealed-in-dough ball inside it. Press the handle lightly, then remove the pressed pastry. Place on a lined baking sheet.\n9. After moulding all 20 yue bing, mix the milk and egg yolks to make an egg wash. Brush each pastry with this mixture. If desired, brush them again delicately with a dry brush to remove excess and preserve the moulding.\n10. Bake for 10-12 minutes. After removing from the oven, let cool for 5 minutes and then brush again with remaining egg wash. Let cool on a wire rack and then store in an airtight container for 1-2 days before consuming.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n#"]}

If you don\u2019t have dark soy sauce, just use 3/4 light soy and 1/4 sugar.  \n\nI often use spaghetti or linguine instead of Chinese noodles because it\u2019s a bit cheaper.

Lay 3 green onions onto a chopping board and cut into thirds (white, green & dark green). Julienne all three sections and set aside.   \n3. Add 1 tbsp oil into a pan (a wok or cast iron pot is perfect).  Add sliced onion and the white and light green sections of green onions. Stir-fry until thinly onions have softened and add beansprouts to saut\u00e9.   \n4. Once the pasta is cooked slightly past al dente, add it to the cooking beansprouts and onions. Quickly add the sliced garlic and green parts of the green onion. Pour in 1 tbsp dark soy sauce and 0.5 tbsp of light soy sauce and mix while cooking at the same time.\u00a0  \n5. Combine until the pasta is coated in soy sauce and evenly colored. Serve.   \n\nRECIPE LINK: https://londonishungry.com/garlic-soy-sauce-pasta/", "So lo mein"]}

He wouldn't touch the money, people would drop their money in the white box, and make their own change. This picture was from 2013.\n\nBeijing-style jianbing has a crispy fried dough sheet (baocui \u8584\u8106 - I had to look this one up), which can be seen on the shelf. His batter had a hint of cinnamon which was a little different than the other ones I had. To make them, he would ladle on a batter, which seemed to be a mix of wheat and millet, and shape it into what resembles a crepe. Then, an egg would be cracked over the bing and spread around, and then he would flip it using long chopsticks (he has already flipped in in this picture. He would spread on lots of fermented red dofu (hongfuru \u7d05\u8150\u4e73) fermented bean paste, hot sauce, and leek flower sauce (the four paintbrushes), and then he would sprinkle on chopped green onions, which is the step this picture was taken, and then lots of cilantro. Finally, he would sprinkle a dark sesame seed mix from that plastic drink bottle, add the crispy dough sheet, and then fold it into a rectangle shape.

Even better was that his spot was where I would pass by on my bicycle practically every day.\n\nTianjin-style jianbing is also popular, and this style uses a chewier dough stick (youtiao \u6cb9\u6761) instead of the baocui. Some people like lettuce leaf on their jinbing, but I the heat would make them slimy and I had a way to go to work on my bike before I would eat it so I avoided the lettuce.

Sprinkle with chopped scallions at this stage.\n\t\u2022\tOptionally, you can also add chili sauce or fermented bean paste for extra flavor.\n\t\u2022\tKeep stir-frying until the noodles are evenly colored and there\u2019s no excess liquid in the wok; then turn off the heat and serve.\n\n\nWith these steps, you\u2019ll have a tempting and aromatic plate of stir-fried noodles.

The key to a great scallion pancakes lies in the multi-layered interior and the crispy exterior. There are a lot of instruction steps, but the recipe is actually really easy! The only part that may be confusing is how to roll the dough to get layers. For that, there are two videos in the blog post that will show you how!\n\nFind the full recipe with instruction images and videos here: [https://www.theminichef.com/scallion-pancakes-recipe/](https://www.theminichef.com/scallion-pancakes-recipe/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 3 cups flour\n* 1 1/4 cups water\n* 3/4 tbsp salt\n* 4 tbsp oil (2 tbsp for the pancake, 2 for cooking)\n* 2 scallions (chopped)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n* Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl. While mixing the flour with chopsticks or a whisk, slowly add the water 1/4 cup at a time. Stop when the dough has mostly started to come together\n* Knead the dough with your hands until it completely combines into a nice round shape. If it's too dry to come together, add more water 1 tbsp at a time, but be careful not to add too much! If it's too sticky, it'll be difficult to roll out the dough. If you accidentally add too much water, just use a bit more flour\n* Let the dough sit covered for about 15 minutes\n* Prepare a large cutting board, or thoroughly cleaned countertop, by covering it with flour. This will prevent the dough from sticking when you roll it out. Also rub some flour on top of the dough so your rolling pin doesn't stick\n* Roll the dough out as large as you can in a rectangular shape. The larger you roll the dough now, the more layers you'll get! Keep some flour on hand though, because as you roll the dough, it'll probably start sticking again and you'll need to add more flour underneath\n* Rub the salt evenly across the dough. Then rub the oil across the dough evenly as well. Finally, add the scallions\n* Now we start rolling! This is where all the layers will be made. Start by rolling the top long edge of the dough towards the center, then roll the bottom up so they meet in the middle (check out the video in the blog post if this is confusing)\n* Cut the dough in half since we'll be making two pancakes.\n* Set one half to the side. With the other half, gently pull on the ends while bouncing it to stretch it out. Roll the ends of the stretched out dough towards the center. When you reach the center, put one rolled up side on top of the other and press them together (again if this is confusing, check out the video in the blog post).\n* Roll the dough out again and let rest for a few minutes before cooking. The dough should be rolled out to about 1/3 inch thick.\n* Heat up 2 tbsp of cooking oil over medium heat. When the pan is hot, put the scallion pancake in. Cook until the dough starts turning golden brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the other side the same way.\n* Repeat steps 9-11 for the other half of the dough. Serve hot and enjoy!"]}

{"title": "Is Chinese Brown Sauce a 'thing' in China too? (the difficulty in translating sauces, plus two recipes)", "selftext": "[This post also exists in video form, if that\u2019s more your speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9dP-MmC25I).\n\nWithin the American Chinese takeout universe, there seems to be this thing called\u2026 \u201cbrown sauce\u201d. \n\nFor the unfamiliar, a quick google should fill you in. It\u2019s \u2013 apparently \u2013 that stuff that\u2019s smothered over your Egg Foo Young, the sauce that\u2019s fried in with your beef and broccoli. There\u2019s an absolute smorgasbord of English language recipes online for it, tons of blogs touting it as a \u2018universal stir fry sauce\u2019, the predictable cacophony of Redditors arguing over the most authentic preparations. The renowned Martin Yan refers to it as \u201cthe Chinese mother sauce\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s if you poke around in English, that is. \n\nThe same search in Chinese? This so-called \u201cbrown sauce\u201d is\u2026 nowhere to be found. No matter what permutation you try (\u68d5/\u8910 for brown, \u9171/\u6c41 for sauce, etc), pretty much the thing you\u2019ll be able to find will be centered around either British HP sauce or French Espagnole sauce. Digging through all our various Cantonese cookbooks \u2013 new ones, old ones, whatever \u2013 also yields a similar about of \u2018nada\u2019. \n\nFor something that\u2019s supposedly *so* universal, that\u2019s pretty weird, right? \n\nIn the past, my base assumption was that Brown Sauce was a sort of collective misnomer: white America goes to a Chinese restaurant, sees some brown saucy stuff in their stir fry, slapdashedly refers to it as \u2018brown sauce\u2019. A Chinese diner might not refer to things in the same way\u2026 but that\u2019s ok, right? Different cooking systems, different cultural touchstones.\n\nBut we can\u2019t so easily write off Brown Sauce off as this sort of collective hallucination of white America \u2013 it\u2019s not just newspapers and redditors that talk about the stuff, but American cooks and chefs as well. From [Martin Yan\u2019s Brown Sauce](https://www.food.com/recipe/all-purpose-stir-fry-sauce-brown-garlic-sauce-87748), to [The Art of Cooking\u2019s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsHAix_kBrg), to [Bill from the renowned Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-chicken-broccoli-brown-sauce/) \u2013 I mean, these are some absolutely first rate Chinese American sources. If they *all* seem to agree on the \u2018thing-ness\u2019 of this universal brown sauce, they\u2019re not wrong.\n\nAnd I mean, a lot of that classic takeout fare *does* tend to revolve around a certain set of Cantonese flavors. And if you took a peek back into one of those kitchens, at times you can see the chef reaching for something pre-made and\u2026 brown. It\u2019s a thing.\n\nSo then, the questions naturally follow: what is this brown sauce? How is it made? Does it exist in China too?\n\nTo answer these and find the in-China equivalent, we\u2019ll need to drill down and really think about what we mean when we\u2019re talking about \u2018sauce\u2019. And to do *that*, it\u2019s probably a little easier to start with what the internet seems to refer to as \u201cChinese white sauce\u201d \u2013 an easier translation puzzle.\n\n## The Conundrum of Translating \u201cSauce\u201d \n\nBelow is a picture of a Moo Goo Gai Pan, a dish that\u2019s famously supposed to contain a \u201cChinese white sauce\u201d.\nhttps://imagedelivery.net/9lr8zq_Jvl7h6OFWqEi9IA/df31121f-8717-4eb8-7e8f-688aea386800/public\n\nYou see chicken. You see mushrooms. You also see that everything\u2019s good and coated and saucy. And that sauce is kind of\u2026 white. So, \u201cwhite sauce\u201d, right? \n\n*Maybe* you could translate it that way, maybe not. \n\nForgive an ever so brief language lesson. At the risk of drastically simplifying things, in Chinese, you\u2019ve got:\n\n1.\t*Jiang* (\u9171). English, \u201csauce\u201d. Generally speaking, jiangs tend to be components, intermediate products. Ground bean sauce? Ground bean *jiang*. Ketchup? Tomato *jiang*.\n2.\t*Zhi* (\u6c41). English, \u201csauce\u201d. A similarly incredibly broad word, but the physical thing that\u2019s on your plate after stir frying would be called a zhi. For example, sweet and sour sauce is called tangcu*zhi*. If you take that aforementioned ketchup and fry it up with a bunch of other ingredients, it becomes qie*zhi*, and you can smother it over a pork chop at Chachaanteng.\n\nSo in a western context, most sauces are usually translated as \u2018zhi\u2019. \n\n*Bechemel: Baizhi\u767d\u6c41, \u2018White sauce\u2019. \n* Hollandaise: Helanzhi \u8377\u5170\u6c41, \u2018Holland sauce\u2019. \n* Gravy: Rouzhi \u8089\u6c41, \u2018Meat sauce\u2019\n\nThe trouble with our Moo Goo Gai Pan is that while that saucy white stuff is a zhi, that zhi doesn\u2019t *really* have a name. In an American context, it might be a little like talking about what goes in on the topping of a casserole \u2013 you can of course refer to the stuff as a \u201ctopping\u201d, but there\u2019s no one single casserole-topping recipe, and no American Escoffier has come about to create a structured system of casserole-toppings. It\u2019s just\u2026 a topping. More of a concept, more of a **technique** than a singular \u2018thing\u2019.\n\nLuckily however, the question of \u201cwhat goes in the white sauce in my Moo Goo Gai Pan\u201d *does* have a clear, relatively structured answer, and that\u2019s\u2026\n\n## The Qian Technique\n\nLast Chinese terminology I\u2019ll introduce, I swear \u2013 and I promise it\u2019s pretty straightforward. \n\n*Qian* (\u82a1) refers to a technique to thicken a liquid with a slurry \u2013 verb form, *gouqian* (\u52fe\u82a1). It\u2019s just as uncomplicated and straightforward as it sounds, pretty much exactly the same as what you\u2019d see, like, a western pan sauce. You make a stir fry with a bit of liquid inside, drizzle in your starch/water mixture, and stir til thick. Fin.\n\nFor our Moo Goo Gai Pan, there\u2019s a specific type of *qian* that it employs called a \u201cCrystal Qian\u201d (\u7409\u7483\u82a1). All *that* means is that the liquid that you thickened was a seasoned stock and\u2026 not too much else. Here\u2019s what that looks like in practice, via the excellent *Art of Cooking*:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6vCZSGtuCYM?si=JdgEJNCbaTCe7GUN&t=380\n\nSo \u201cChinese White Sauce\u201d could perhaps be thought of as a \u201cCrystal Qian\u201d\u2026 but it\u2019s important to note that unlike the word \u2018sauce\u2019, this is a **technique**. No diners in China are going around being like \u201cmmm I can\u2019t get me enough of this Crystal Qian\u201d \u2013 if anything, they might say \u201cthe chef is able to control the qian very well\u201d or more likely\u2026 not even really think about it much at all.\n\n## How to Make a \u201cWhite Sauce\u201d (i.e. employ a crystal qian)\n\nSo we\u2019ll cover how to make this \u2018white sauce\u2019, but definitely note that for the most part it exists **inseparable from the stir fry itself** (though sometimes it can coat steamed dishes). It\u2019s not something you can buy, it\u2019s not something that a restaurant would batch prep or store.\n\nNow, we\u2019ll start things off with a \u2018seasoned stock\u2019, but in practice things can sometimes get a little more\u2026 seasoning than stock: chicken bouillon powder and MSG do a good bit of the heavy lifting. So if you felt like getting super fancy, a [Cantonese superior stock](https://youtu.be/Y248pBTcflw?si=HumlDLuDHtMXyeLT&t=101) could obviously work, but that\u2019s far far from mandatory. You could use a simple whatever Chinese pork stock, some western-style chicken stock so long as it\u2019s unroasted and not too heavily seasoned with herbs and such (some stock bought stocks in the west can get really\u2026 thyme-y), or even just use water. \n\nSecond, for the starch most of you will likely be carrying cornstarch in your cupboard. If at all possible, swap that for either potato or tapioca starch \u2013 these starches thicken better, are quicker to act, and hold longer after cooking. Cornstarch can work in a pinch, but is generally thought of as the least-good option for this sort of thing (great for deep frying coatings however).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. *Seasoned stock: pork -or- chicken stock, \u00bd cup; water, \u00bd cup; chicken bouillon powder (\u9e21\u7c89), 1 tsp; sugar, \u00bd tsp; salt, \u00bc tsp; MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), \u00bc tsp.* Or, again, use all stock or all water.\n2. *Oil, lard preferably, 2 tbsp.*\n2. *Aromatics: ~1 large clove garlic, minced; ~1cm ginger, minced.*\n3. *Liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), 1 tbsp.*\n4. *Slurry: starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 1 tbsp; mixed with 2 tbsp water*\n\nMix all the ingredients for the \u2018seasoned stock\u2019 in a bowl. \n\nTo a wok, first longyau \u2013 get it piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil \u2013 and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Flame still off, add in the minced aromatics and tip the flame to medium-low. Fry until fragrant, ~30 seconds.\n\nUp the flame to high. Swirl in the wine and give everything a quick mix. Add in the seasoned stock. Bring it up to a rapid boil, then down to a simmer. In a thin stream, drizzle the slurry in while stirring constantly. You should be looking for something slightly before spoon-coating-consistency.\n\nAt this point, you\u2019d could add whatever pre-cooked ingredients you\u2019d be making for your specific stir fry. There\u2019s also flexibility \u2013 you can also swap up the order of operations a bit (more on that in the notes at the end of the post).\n\nSo to bring that all together, let\u2019s take a gander at one of my all time favorite Cantonese Banquet dishes, Broccoli and Shrimp.\n\n## Broccoli and Shrimp\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1.\t*Shrimp, shell-on, 800g*\n2.\t*Sodium Carbonate (\u78b1\u9762) -or- Kansui Lye Water (\u67a7\u6c34), \u00bd tsp*.\n3.\t*Marinade for the shrimp: salt, \u00bc tsp; white pepper powder, \u00bc tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), \u00bc tsp; starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 1 tsp*\n4.\t*Broccoli, 400g.*\n5.\t*For garnish (optional): red mild chili, 1 -or- red bell pepper, \u00bd; carrot, ~1 inch.*   \n6.\t*Aromatics: garlic, 1 large clove, minced; ginger, ~1cm, minced*\n7.\t*Liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing Wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), 1 tbsp*\n8.\t*Seasoned stock: pork -or- chicken stock, \u00bd cup; water, \u00bd cup; chicken bouillon powder (\u9e21\u7c89), 1 tsp; sugar, \u00bd tsp; salt, \u00bc tsp; MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), \u00bc tsp*. As discussed above.\n9.\t*Slurry: starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 2.5 tsp; mixed with 2.5 tbsp water*\n10.\t*Toasted sesame oil (\u9ebb\u6cb9), 1 tsp.*\n\n**Process:**\n\nCut the broccoli into florets, and the florets in half. Mince the garlic and the ginger. Slice the (optional) mild chili/bell pepper into roughly 1 inch diamonds, and the (optional) carrot into ~3mm sheets. \n\nTo prepare the shrimp, the general approach here was ala our [Shrimp: the Maximally Delicious Way](https://youtu.be/uq6ghFESDjA?si=rj5Dv1mME1Yy-JtT) video, if you\u2019d like a visual on that.\n\nRemove the shell and heads from the shrimp. Place in a bowl and mix in the \u00bd tsp sodium carbonate (or kan sui). Fill up with water right above the shrimp, let sit for 3-5 minutes. Then place the bowl in a sink under a thin stream of running water, and let it all rinse for 3-10 minutes. This process is to remove the slime of the shrimp and help it retain its pop when cooking.\n\nAfter that time, transfer the shrimp to a kitchen towel and thoroughly pat dry. Then, butterfly the shrimp by slicing in from the back and opening the shrimp like a book \u2013 I personally like to remove the vein once the shrimp are butterflied. Give the shrimp a quick pat dry again with a paper towel, then transfer to a bowl. Add the \u201cmarinade for the shrimp\u201d. Mix well.\n\nTo a wok (preferably), add in a few inches of oil \u2013 enough that you can submerge the shrimp (I use 1-1.5 cups, but you could theoretically work this with \u00bd cup). Over a high flame, heat the oil up until its rapidly bubbling around a pair of chopsticks, or about 165C. Dump the shrimp in and fry until they look visibly cooked, ~45 seconds. Add the pepper and the carrot and give everything a very brief mix. Remove it all, let the oil drain out, and set aside.\n\nFor the broccoli, fill a pot or wok up with water and bring to a boil. Add in ~1 tsp salt (to season) and ~1/2 tbsp oil (for sheen). Add the broccoli and cook until it\u2019s deepened in color, ~1 minute. Remove, and drain. Arrange the broccoli on a serving plate in a circle with the florets placed outwards.\n\nTo do the crystal qian, in a wok (preferably) first longyau \u2013 get it piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil \u2013 here, ~2 tbsp (I used lard) \u2013 and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface. Flame still off, add in the minced aromatics and tip the flame to medium-low. Fry until fragrant, ~30 seconds.\n\nUp the flame to high. Swirl in the wine and give everything a quick mix. Add in the \u201cLiquid for the Crystal Qian\u201d. Bring it up to a rapid boil, then down to a simmer. In a thin stream, drizzle the slurry in while stirring constantly. The goal is a shade before spoon-coating consistency \u2013 add more starch if you\u2019re not at that point.\n\nAdd the shrimp, carrot and peppers. Mix everything well with the sauce. Drizzle in the toasted sesame oil, mix, and toss on the broccoli.\n\n## Brown Sauce\n\nOkay. So then \u201cChinese white sauce\u201d is literally just stock that\u2019s seasoned and thickened with a slurry. So then\u2026 what about brown sauce?\n\nThere is, of course, plenty of \u2018brown-ish\u2019 stir-fries that\u2019re thickened in the same way \u2013 probably too many to count \u2013 cross crossing a whole smorgasbord of various flavor profiles. But that\u2019s not what Martin Yan or Woks of Life are referring to in their recipes: they\u2019re talking about this thing that restaurants mix in advance and use as \u2018mother sauce\u2019 for various dishes.\n\nWhich, of course, certainly exists in China too \u2013 it\u2019s called *tiaowei jiangyou* (\u8c03\u5473\u9171\u6cb9), i.e. \u201cseasoned soy sauce\u201d. \n\nYou see, if you cook Chinese food quite a bit, you\u2019ll often find yourself reaching for a bunch of ingredients over and over: soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, MSG, maybe oyster sauce, maybe stock\u2026 whatever. Chinese restaurants, meanwhile, are highly efficient operations built from the ground up to save **time** (the real primary purpose of those high output restaurant burners, as an aside). For dishes that have overlap or are common across your menu, one time-saving trick is to pre-mix those oft-repeated components. A very clear example of the practice is seasoned soy sauce for seafood (i.e. the stuff drizzled over a Cantonese steamed fish), which\u2019s almost always pre-mixed and [is actually that you can just buy](https://usa.lkk.com/en/products/seasoned-soy-sauce-for-seafood). \n\nSo a seasoned soy sauce *is* this so-called \u201cmother sauce\u201d that your takeout restaurant is reaching for. But different restaurants are different, and have different needs. A Sichuan noodle vendor\u2019s seasoned soy sauce could be steeped with spices. A Chuka restaurant in Japan might include gyofun and ketchup. \n\n## One possible Cantonese Seasoned Soy Sauce\n\nOf course, plenty of restaurants don\u2019t employ a seasoned soy sauce in their kitchen. And when it comes to home cooks in China, it\u2019d be extremely rare to see. \n\nWe don\u2019t use one, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that\u2019s *all* that relevant for most home cooks. But still, as the enduring popularity of pre-mixed \u201cstir fry sauces\u201d in the anglosphere proves, there\u2019s certainly a sub category of people that the mise makes sense for. So if you want? Go for it.\n\nQuick note that I designed this seasoned soy sauce in order to be used directly in the following recipe. If you were a restaurant, you\u2019d likely want to reduce this down to concentrate the flavors \u2013 if you\u2019d like to used this roughly akin to how you\u2019d season with soy sauce, let it boil and reduce by half.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. *Dried Shiitake (\u51ac\u83c7), 1*\n2. *Water, 1 cup.*\n3. *Ginger, 1 inch.* Smashed.\n4. *Scallion, 1 sprig* Tied in a knot.\n5. *Soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), 4 tsp*\n6. *Oyster sauce (\u869d\u6cb9), 1 tbsp*\n7. *Liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), 1 tbsp\n8. *Dry Seasoning: Sugar, 1 tsp; Chicken Bouillon Powder (\u9e21\u7c89), \u00bc tsp; Salt, 1/8 tsp; MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), 1/8 tsp.*\n\n**Process:**\n\nSoak the shiitake in cool water overnight (or alternatively, in hot boiled water for ~30 minutes). Squeeze the liquid from the shiitake, then strain the soaking liquid into a pot. Snip the shiitake with scissors into the pot, and then also toss in the ginger and scallion.\n\nBring everything up to a boil, then down to a simmer. Cover, and let everything infuse over a low flame for ~15 minutes.\n\nAfter that time, shut off the heat and remove the mushroom and the aromatics \u2013 placing them in a bowl to let them cool down. Add in all your other seasoning and mix. Once the mushroom and aromatics are cool enough to handle, squeeze every last drop into the pot of now-seasoned soy sauce and discard. Bring everything up to a boil once last time, and reserve.\n\nThis should yield you roughly \u00be cup of seasoned soy sauce. If using for the following recipe, supplement with water if it reduced beyond that point.\n\n## How to Make \u201cBrown Sauce\u201d \u2013 i.e. a seasoned soy sauce thickened with a Qian\n\nI do think that there might still be a miscommunication here. When I\u2019ve seen Martin Yan or Art of Cooking discuss \u2018brown sauce\u2019, what they\u2019re referring to is a seasoned soy sauce like the one above.\n\nWhen I see people on Reddit inquiring about brown sauce, they seem to be talking about the *final sauce* that\u2019s, say, smothered over their Egg Foo Young. \n\nThese are, again, two different things. \n\nLike, you can obviously use a seasoned soy sauce in plenty of dishes, beyond just stuff that has a \u2018gravy-like\u2019 consistency (e.g. the seasoned soy sauce for seafood like the one discussed above). And you also certainly don\u2019t need a pre-prepared seasoned soy sauce to make something like that \u2018gravy\u2019 for Egg Foo Young (plenty of restaurants will also opt for a step-by-step approach). \n\nSo it\u2019s a little hard to give a recipe for \u2018brown sauce\u2019 like we did for \u2018white sauce\u2019, because there\u2019s nothing universal here. That said, I can already here some echos \u201cshut up already Chris, enough with your prefacing, just give me something that I could use to hit the brown-sauce-sized hole in my gullet\u201d. And to that end, what you could do is: \n\n1. Fry up some aromatics (any combination of garlic/ginger/scallion whites that makes sense) \n2. Swirl in some Shaoxing wine \n3. Add in that seasoned soy sauce from above \n4. Thicken with a slurry, just like the crystal qian above.\n\nIf in the context of a stir fry, again, your order-of-operations is sort of up to you \u2013 you could add in your other ingredients pre-thickening, or post. As an example, you could take a look at Beef and Broccoli, which\u2019s probably the obvious choice:\n\n* [Our recipe on the topic](https://youtu.be/i-fU6MCPZ2M?si=MXUhkyQIYXLbFKgh&t=463)\n* [Art of Cooking\u2019s recipe](https://youtu.be/kjTcuBJz-zs?si=jYQiQ2xgYpSlfe-L&t=407)\n\nLet\u2019s change it up though and show you another possible application:\n\n## Beef and Straw mushrooms, served over rice noodles\n\nBeef and Straw mushrooms (\u8349\u83c7\u725b\u8089) is a classic Cantonese stir fry that can take on a few different forms. I wanted to show something saucier here, so I significantly increased the water quantity from what we\u2019d usually do (in order to get something a bit closer to what folks might imagine from a \u201cbrown sauce heavy\u201d dish). When things are *that* saucy though, they\u2019re just crying to be smothered over rice noodles, so that\u2019s the route I went with here.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. *Beef, 250g.* Loin, flank, or top round.\n2. *Marinade for the beef: salt, \u00bc tsp; sugar, \u00bd tsp; soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), \u00bc tsp; dark soy sauce (\u8001\u62bd), \u00bc tsp; liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u9152), \u00bd tsp; oyster sauce (\u869d\u6cb9), 1 tsp; white -or- black pepper, 1/8 tsp; sodium carbonate -or- Kan sui, \u00bc tsp (preferably) -or- baking soda, \u00bd tsp; starch (\u6dc0\u7c89), 1 tsp; water, 3 tbsp; egg white, \u00bd; oil, 1 tbsp.* The other half of the egg white will go with the eggs when frying the rice noodles.\n3. *Straw mushrooms (\u8349\u83c7) -or- Shiitake mushrooms (\u9999\u83c7) -or- whatever mushrooms, 250g.*\n4. *For the blanching liquid: salt; 1 tsp; oil, ~1 tbsp*\n5. *Fresh Pad See Ew noodles, 500g.* I used fresh Pad See Ew noodles because we live in Thailand \u2013 this was what I tested. Fresh Hor Fun would have been better, and preferred. If using Dried Hor Fun, use ~300g.\n6. *Egg, 2.* One full egg plus what was leftover from the marinade.\n7. *Beansprouts, ~50g.*\n8. *Seasoning for the rice noodles: soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), 1 tsp; salt, 1/8 tsp; sugar, 1/8 tsp; water, 2 tbsp.* Water-heavy because Pad See Ew noodles are difficult to coat evenly.\n9. *Ginger, ~1 inch.* Smashed.\n10. *Scallions, 2.* White and green portions separated, both cut into ~1.5 inch sections\n11. *Seasoned soy sauce from above.* See the note below if you don\u2019t want to make a separate seasoned soy sauce.\n12. *Slurry: 2.5 tsp starch mixed with 2 tbsp water.*\n13. *Toasted sesame oil (\u9ebb\u6cb9), ~1 tsp.* To finish.\n14. *White -or- black pepper powder, \u00bc tsp.* To finish. \n\nNote: if you don\u2019t feel like going through the whole song and dance of making a seasoned soy sauce, simply soak a shiitake as above. Once you get to the final stir fry, add the shiitake soaking liquid instead of the seasoned soy sauce. Add in all the ingredients from the seasoned soy sauce recipe minus the aromatics, and then continue on with this recipe.\n\n**Process:**\n\nSmash the ginger. Separate the scallions into the whites and greens, cutting each into ~1.5 inch sections. If your straw mushrooms are small, halve them; if they\u2019re large or you\u2019re using shiitakes, slice into ~1cm sheets.\n\nThinly slice the beef into 2-3mm sheets. Add all the ingredients for the marinade except the oil and mix very well, making sure the water is absorbed into the beef. Add the oil and mix to coat. Set aside for 10-15 minutes to allow the alkaline to tenderize the beef.\n  \nAdd the salt and oil to a pot of water. Boil the mushrooms until cooked, ~2 minutes. Reserve.\n\nTo a wok (preferably), add in a few inches of oil \u2013 enough that you can submerge the beef (I use 1-1.5 cups, but you could theoretically work this with \u00bd cup). Over a high flame, heat the oil up until its rapidly bubbling around a pair of chopsticks, or about 165C. Dump the beef in and fry until it looks visibly cooked, ~45 seconds. Remove, let the oil drain out, and set aside.\n\nNext, frying up some rice noodles. Do this however you\u2019re comfortable. But for me, first I loosened up the rice noodles and set them on a plate. Then, to a wok with the flame on maximum, after a quick longyau with ~2 tbsp oil, I tossed in the beaten eggs. Once they\u2019re good and scrambled, I went in with the Pad See Ew noodles. Pad See Ew noodles love to clump, so if you\u2019re going that route too be sure to continuously spread the noodles outward from the center of the wok. Once the noodles have just *barely* started to brown (1-2 minutes), flip and continue with the other side. Then swirl the liquid seasoning in, continuously mixing and spreading the noodles to avoid clumping. Add in the beansprouts, stir fry for ~30 seconds. Move over to a plate.\n\nScrape out the wok, and *longyau* again \u2013 again, ~2 tbsp oil. Over a high flame, fry the ginger and scallion until fragrant, ~15 seconds, then swirl in the wine. After a quick mix, go in with the seasoned soy sauce. Bring it up to a boil and then down to a simmer, then drizzle in the slurry while stirring constantly. Add in the beef and mushrooms, mix well. Finish with the toasted sesame oil and white (or black) pepper, and smother it all over the stir fried rice noodles.\n\n## Note on Order of Operations\n\nYou\u2019ve got three choices on when to add your pre-cooked ingredients *back* to the final stir fry:\n\n1.\t**After you fry the aromatics and swirl in the wine, before adding the liquid**. The advantage of adding the ingredients at this stage is that you can give the ingredients a brief stir fry \u2013 they\u2019ll take on the subsequent flavors a touch better. \n2.\t**After you add the liquid, before you thicken**. Less common, but will give the ingredients a change to mingle with the liquid before thickening. \n3.\t**After you thicken**. Allows you to most clearly see the stage of the sauce and how thick it is before mixing.\n\nIn almost all of our recipes, we opt for the first choice. In these recipes I went with the last one in order to most clearly show the qian technique.\n\nBut you can also add different ingredients at different times. Maybe you want to add the beef after the aromatics (to give it a bit of a stir fry, or perhaps a chance to mix with some sizzling soy sauce seared against the side of the wok), and the mushrooms at the very end (as mushrooms really love to leech water and mess up the final sauce consistency).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/170i505/is_chinese_brown_sauce_a_thing_in_china_too_the/", "created_utc": 1696512783.0, "score": 125, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/170i505/is_chinese_brown_sauce_a_thing_in_china_too_the/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Super interesting.

The dish is very easy to find in Chengdu, as it is a popular street food.\n\nIf you\u2019re a noodle lover and never tried this before you don\u2019t want to miss it. It\u2019s sweet, spicy, numby and full of aroma from the soy sauce we make earlier.\n\nSweet water noodles - recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* Flour, 300g\n* Water, 150ml\n* Aromatic soy sauce, 2tbsp ([recipe](https://youtu.be/fkStfet5rtM))\n* Chili oil, 2tbsp ([recipe](https://youtu.be/LfV33zvOYdg))\n* Brown sugar, 1tbsp\n* Crushed peanut/crunchy PB, can also use sesame paste, 1tbsp\n* Sesame seeds, 1tbsp\n* Crushed garlic, 2 cloves\n* Ground Sichuan peppercorn, 1/2 tsp\n* Salt, add into flour\n\nMake the noodles:\n\nCombine the flour with water, mix and form a rough dough. Let rest for 5min. Knead the dough the 1st time until slightly smooth. Let rest for 10min. Knead for 2nd time until the dough is very smooth. Rest for 10min.\n\nFlatten the dough to a rectangular shape to about chopstick thickness, about 0.5-0.7cm. cut the noodles into long strips and separate them. slightly stretch them a bit.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to make the noodles from scratch, you can use packet udon noodles or other fresh thick noodles.\n\nCook the noodles:\n\nBoiling water, cook the noodle until soft and slightly puffed up. Strain and put in a bowl.\n\nAdd all the spices and condiments onto the noodle directly, you don\u2019t need to premix the sauce.\n\nMix the noodles with the sauce well and enjoy.", "I am not familiar with these noodles but I'm totally inspired by the photos and recipe \ud83d\ude0a", "I\u2019ve never tried this.

Using a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix on high until the mixture becomes fluffy and pale yellow.\n\nSift the dry ingredients into the butter base and beat on low until everything is well-combined.\n\nThis mixture should be roughly 300g. Divide it into two equal portions of 150g. If there\u2019s a little extra, add it to the half set aside for matcha dough.\n\nFor the vanilla dough, add 30g cake flour to the mixture and beat on low to combine.\n\nFor the matcha dough, add 22g cake flour and 3 g matcha powder to the other half of the mixture and beat on low to combine. *Less dry ingredients are needed for the matcha dough because matcha is an extra fine powder that absorbs more moisture.*\n\nCover both dough with cling wrap and rest overnight in the fridge. This will help develop gluten and prevent the dough from cracking during baking.\n\n*For the pineapple filling, I recommend using a fresh pineapple because the pineapple core is crucial to providing additional fiber and texture to the filling.* First, remove the outer skin of the pineapple using either a pineapple corer or a knife. Then, chop the pineapple core into fine dices, and chop the flesh into quarter inch dices.\n\nAdd the diced pineapple and sugar to a 10 or 12-inch nonstick pan, and cook on high for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the mixture no longer bubbles, the pineapple turns light orange, and the mixture clumps together. Stir constantly during this process so that the pineapple won\u2019t burn.\n\nReduce the heat to medium, add maltose to this mixture and cook for another 5-10 minutes stirring constantly. The mixture is done when you leave the mixture unstirred for 5 seconds, flip it over, and see white blisters forming on the underside of the mixture in contact with the pan.\n\nOnce the filling is done, remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for 15 minutes, then transfer the filling into a container and store it in the fridge overnight. *This step is crucial, as the filling hardens when cooled and becomes easier to work with.*\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to assemble, take the two pieces of dough out of the fridge to bring them closer to room temperature.\n\nIn the meanwhile, divide the pineapple filling into 15g portions and roll them into balls with your palms. Store them in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes as you divide the dough.\n\nDivide the dough into 18g portions and roll them into balls as well. Cover with cling wrap so they don\u2019t dry out.\n\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper, you will need a 50g mooncake mold if you\u2019re using molds.\u00a0\n\nTake out a piece of the dough and gently press it into a circle 2 \u00bd inches in diameter with your fingers. Place a pineapple filling at the center and slowly pinch and push up the dough with your thumb and index until the dough covers the entire filling. Roll the filled dough with your palms to form a smooth ball.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7  \n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you\u2019re using a mold, dust the ball with additional flour to prevent sticking, and place it in the mold. Hold the mold firmly against the baking sheet and press down the spring press. Lift the mold half an inch off the baking sheet and press the top down again to release the pineapple cake. Repeat the steps above for all cakes, placing them an inch apart. *Do not wrap all the cakes at once, because while the cold filling is easier to work with, it will harden the dough and make it impossible to shape. Cover with finished pineapple cakes with cling wrap as you work on them, so the dough doesn\u2019t dry out.*\n\nIf you\u2019re not using a mold, simply form them into flat cylindrical shapes after you wrap the fillings.\n\nPlace the assembled pineapple cakes along with the baking sheet into the freezer for at least 30 minutes. *This step prevents the cakes from cracking by hardening the filling and preventing it from expanding before the outer shell bakes and hardens.*\n\n15 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Once the 30 minutes is up and the oven is preheated, remove the baking sheet from the freezer and place in the oven.\n\nReduce the oven to 345\u00b0F and bake for 16-18 minutes, until the edges are slightly golden.\n\nLet the pineapple cakes cool for 15 minutes before removing them from the baking sheet.\n\nThe cakes can be enjoyed fresh, but the convention is storing them in an airtight container overnight before consumption so that the crust will be more tender. Either way it\u2019s delicious!", "Would love to see the inside, when you are ready to eat one.\n\nThese are my favourite Chinese food :)", "These are beautiful!", "Omg those look amazing. Thank you!!", "These are so lovely <3\n\nI use a cheese grater for my pineapples. Saves my hands from the relentless chopping :)"]}

Cover and bring water to a boil at high heat. Once water is at a boil, simmer for 5 minutes. You should see lots of gray bits and foam coming to the top of the water. Remove beef and pour out the foamy water, rinsing the pot clean. Take your piece of beef and give it a rinse in cold water, washing away any scum or cooked blood. This step ensures a clear broth.\n\n**Step 2 (Make the Broth):** Put the beef back into the pot and add all of the ginger, garlic, scallions, chili if using, slab sugar, dark and light soy, salt, Shaoxing wine, Szechuan peppercorn, clove, nutmeg, fennel, licorice, star anise, cassia bark, cardamom, bay leaf. Optionally you can use a piece of cheesecloth to keep all your spices together and make straining the broth easier later on. Bring to a boil on high heat. Once the liquid is boiling, drop the heat to low until there are just barely bubbles simmering at the surface. If using brisket, cook for approximately 60 minutes. If using beef shank, cook for around 90 minutes. You want to cook each cut until its fork tender, but not falling apart. Remove from the pot and cool in the fridge (cooler meat makes it easier to slice thinly).\n\n**Step 3 (Seasoning the Broth):** Strain the broth into a new pot  or remove spice cheesecloth bag and remaining scallion and garlic pieces. The broth should be clear and mahogany in color. Add the tomato segments to your broth. They should cook down super soft and add sweetness to the broth. Add doubanjiang to taste, this adds fermented richness and salt to your broth. Cook for at least 20 minutes on medium heat for tomato to soften and break up. You can use a spoon to help break up the tomato a bit. Add salt or sugar to taste, adjusting if needed. Once the broth is seasoned to taste, keep on a low heat to keep hot.\n\n**Step 4 (Cook noodles):** Take your beef out of the fridge and using a sharp knife, slice very thinly against the grain. Boil water in a medium pot and once boiling, add the stalks of your green vegetable to cook for 1-2 minutes. Then add leafy segments, another 1-2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove them from the water and reserve. In the boiling water, add your noodles and cook according to instructions. They should be slightly softer than Italian al dente but not by much. Strain, and give them a rinse under running water to remove excess starch. I do this under cold water, then change the tap to hot water to rewarm the noodles a bit.\n\n**Step 5 (Assemble):**  Place a nest of noodles into each serving bowl and 3-4 thin slices of beef on top. Ladle your hot broth into the bowl, aiming the broth on top of the beef so it warms up gently without cooking further. Nestle in some of your green vegetables and if you have some chili oil on hand (I usually have Sichuan red oil in my fridge) add some to taste. Top with thinly sliced scallions if you like.", "Taiwanese beef noodle typically used broad white noodles instead of yellow noodles, and the meat is usually shank not brisket. And is usually served without chili oil.\n\nThis looks more similar to Lanzhou beef noodle, which is what Taiwanese beef noodle is based on.\n\nLooks delicious regardless.", "The light/color in this picture is super pretty"]}

The chicken fat adds that mouth fatty feel. Seasoned it to taste, drained and then added the gelatin to the stock, let cool and fridge until jelly, about 3-4 hours. \n\nFor the filling: \n\n- 1 pound of ground pork or any combination of ground meats that you like. Popular combos are pork and crab, pork and shrimp, etc, I'm using 80/20 lean ground pork, the fattier the better imo but this was pre-made. \n- 1-2 leaves of napa cabbage, finely chopped and put them into a bowl and season with 1/2 tbsp salt and stir around. Let sit for about 10-15 minutes or so to draw out the moisture and squeeze out the excess water before adding to the bowl\n- 4 pieces of fresh shiitake mushroom finely cut\n- 2-3 spring/green onions finely cut or chives \n- 1 tsp salt \n- 1 tbsp of shaoxing wine\n- 1/2 tbsp of sesame oil\n- pepper to taste\n- 1 tbsp of light soy sauce\n- 1 tbsp chicken essence \n- 4 cloves of garlic and equal parts ginger with a little water blended into a paste \n- 1/2 tsp sugar \n\nBlend the ingredients until smooth and meatball like texture. Refrigerate until ready to blend with jelly soup. \n\nOnce soup hardens up you can now dice them into very small pieces and blend together with the pork filling. \n\nThe dough: I like a ratio of 57% hydration \n\n- 140g all purpose flour \n- 1g of salt\n- 80 ml of warm/hot water. \n\nSlowly add the water to your flour and mix little at a time until you get a build up of flakes. \nKnead until you start forming that gluten structure but don't overdo it.

Then you fish out the things you put in and eat.  As the meal goes on, the soup base picks up more flavor from the things you've cooked in it.  The process isnt that dissimilar from fondue or korean bbq.\n\n**Ordering**\n\nSome places might have a yin-yang pot where you can have 2 soups separated by a divider in the same pot.  Some may even have 4 soups.  They'll bring you the soup and pot to your table where you have a central burner of some sort.  Some places you get up and self collect your ingredients you want to cook kinda like a salad bar.  More common is that you order off of a menu and they bring them to you.\n\n**Soup Bases**\n\nTheres a super wide range of different soup bases, from light and delicate to super rich and creamy to super robust.  some are mild some are spicy.  As a vegetarian, you should double check on whats in the soup bases.  Very commonly, they use things like beef tallow and bone broths as core components.  If i were avoiding animal products, I'd probably stick to the mushroom or tomato soup bases if they have them. But def ask.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nEverything generally cooks quickly and is more or less bite sized.  Less relevant to you, theres a wide range of meats you can order.  With the exception of meat balls, they are usually not seasoned but sliced super thin, intending to pick up flavor fro a quick cook in the soup.  There's also fish balls, fish, and shrimp commonly. You can also order various vegetables typically leafy greens again as they're quick to cook, spouts, aromatics like scallions, onions, etc. Shiitake, enoki, beech, wood ear, mushrooms... You can also order fresh tofu, tofu skins and tofu sticks, tofu puffs and the like.  Various noodles, gluten puffs, (quail) eggs, dumplings, and other random stuffs\n\n**Cooking**\n\nAfter Prometheus brings the heat (and the soup, you want to drop the ingredients that take longer to cook in first.  Similar to fondue, usually everyone has they're own ladle/spider strainer and eating chopsticks.  Some places also provide communal chopsticks.  The idea is that the communal ware + your personal strainer go into the pot but should NEVER touch your personal plate/bowl or your mouth.  Thats pretty much the only cardinal rule. Unless someone is quarterbacking the pot for the party, its good manners to to keep track of what you've dropped in and make sure to only collect that.\n\n**Eating**\n\nThere's usually a sauce station or you can order sauces.  Those sauce go into your personal bowl(s).  Common sauces are chinese bbq sauce (sha cha sauce). soy sauce, sesame oil or sesame paste, minced garlic.  Its ok to have more than 1 sauce bowl.  Dont go crazy, but also dont try and mix everything in one bowl either.  When you fish out your foods, maybe dip them into your sauce, and shove them in your mouth.  Repeat until you burst.\n\n**Random**\n\nOther things that are common.  Throughout the meal, your server might come by to top off your broths and sometimes that might just add water.  Some places have appetizers or side dishes that are meant to be stand alone and dont go in the hot pot. Remember no personal chopsticks in the pot and no communalware in your bowl.\n\nI think thats big things.  Enjoy!", "What kind of hotpot, and where?

If you have attic or unused space somewhere between the hood and the outside vent, you can consider an inline blower, also capable of a relatively high cfm. In both cases, it\u2019s quieter in the kitchen and you can actually hold a conversation. As far as makes and models, that\u2019s up to you and your aesthetics.\n\nETA: Baffle filters are great because you can pop them off and throw them in the dishwasher as needed.

My relatives back home in Shanghai would do this all the time and it gives it a slightly different flavour profile that's incredible in its own way. It pairs well with the small splash of sesame oil since it just brings out the aroma of the tomatoes and eggs.\n\nIt's also a really good way to boost the tomato flavor in general if you don't have particularly potent tomatoes lying around! Otherwise without either wine or ketchup, you'll probably want something like MSG make it more savory. But you do have to be a bit careful with the amount you put in since you said you don't like the dish overly sweet. You can try counteracting it with some more salt, but I'd probably guess that you'd want to avoid a sodium overdose. Then again, everyone's definitions of sweet is slightly different. I think a squirt would be fine.\n\nNeutral oil works best here like canola or peanut as with many Chinese dishes, but olive will work just fine too.

You might not need sugar if the tomatoes are sweet enough.\n\nLeaving the eggs in during the entire process would overcook them beyond how I like them.", "My process:\n\n1. Scramble the pre mixed egg and add a tiny pinch of salt(It helps with egg forming nice small chunk)\n\n2. Take solidified egg out \n\n3. put the tomato in and wait till it turn soft\n\n4. Add the egg back with, a few drip of vinegar(this brings out the flavor), sugar if you like the sweet version, add soy sauce for coloring and it also help with the seasoning/flavor. \n\n\n\nUse mid fire so that you dont burn the egg. You want nice yellow tender texture of the scrambled egg.\n\nThe reason that I take out the egg before adding in tomato is because tomatoes are very juicy. The egg would absorb the juice. As a result, the final dish would lose a bit distinction of flavor between the tomato and egg. The scrambled egg would absorb a lot of the sugar in this dish. I want my egg tastes different from the refreshing tomato. My mom would just add tomato directly into the egg.", "I think green onion for garnish and a little flavor at the end of the stir fry.", "In China, \u897f\u7ea2\u67ff\u7092\u9e21\u86cbhave two version. one is sweet another is salty.

This will break down the skin so its easier for bubbles to form. similar to how low and slow bbq works. low temps for longer time breaks down the skin and connective tissues. the skin after this step should be like a soft leather.\n\nstep 3: take the meat out, crank temp to 480-500 with convection on. rest the meat for 20 mins while oven is heating up.\n\nstep 4: roast until all the skin is puffed. make sure there are no valleys in the skin for the fat to dwell.\n\nThis method allowed me to create chinese roast pork with skin that stays light and crispy for hours! You might also experience the most juicy pork belly ever if you are using the pork belly cut as the tissues that hold the fat broke down to collagen in step 2.\n\nMy analysis on what youre doing:\n\nYou are using a regular oven correct, not a convection oven.  The key detail most people miss when doing this at home is if you want reliable results, you need a convection oven or an air fryer as you need air movement to keep the skin hot and dry. Chinese bbq places use vertical roasting ovens with the fire on the bottom allowing the hot air to flow up. Regular ovens keeps the ambient temp at whatever you set it to without airflow.  The salt layer and the holes do not matter. Ive had near 100% success for myself and the people who made chinese roast pork with the steps above. Use convection!  The baking with the salt layer is not reliable while it does pull moisture out, its also not allowing the air to flow over skin. Poking holes allow the fat to fry the skin, but that results in a hard crunch which works well with thin skin pork belly like suckling pig, but not thick skin pork belly.  what you want is as many air bubbles as possible. Hole poking reduces the ability for the skin to produce air bubbles as its been punctured.", "Baking soda?", "What's the goal of covering it with salt during baking? \n\nIf you want to make it salty, I would do a dry brine with the salt as you are doing the resting step, then just do step 2 and 3 as you do them now without the salt step. You might also be able to get away without the extra oil in step 3 unless the pork's really lean.\n\nI would personally also do steps 2 & 3 in the oven since you're already using that, but that shouldn't make a big difference either way."]}

Just trim the nails, blench and rinse, throw in a handful of Sichuan peppercorn and dry chilies, a few pieces of cinnamon stick, a few star anise and bay leaves. Add enough water to cover, add salt, sugar, soy sauce and simmer till soft.\n\n\nSecond one is...much more scary. Same with trimming the nails, blenching and rinsing, then pat them super dry and deep fry them. It gives you the texture like chicken feet in dim sum places and its puffy skin can soak up so many flavor in hot pot. Question is deep frying chicken feet is generally a bad idea, they pop like crazy in hot oil and since they tend to stick to eachother they have to be fried one by one. Not recommended but it's an option.\n\n\nOne final thing, three pounds chicken feet sounds like a lot, and if you have braised them with spices like method one but can't eat all at once in hot pot, try grilling them with cumin and chili flakes like Chinese BBQ. These are my favourite item at any Shaokao places and I really can't recommend more.", "chickens feet isnt really a hotpot ingredient.  typically you want things that are quick to cook.  and chickens feet take a pretty long time to cook so theyre more tender.   i guess if you're deadset on it, i would fully cook and braise them first. so you're more reheating / slightly flavoring in the hot bot base."]}

The dough is usually from scratch.", "Here is my rant/ramble on these. I\u2019ve have been hunting these down for years.  I suspect that they were an American invention.  Here\u2019s why.  Everything I\u2019ve read about dumplings says that the maker takes pride in the thinness of the wrapper. They are harder to make and harder to fold.  My interpretation of Chinese food history in the US goes, the old-school restaurants (think red every-where and lots of fish tanks, some holding decorative fish, and some holding supper) were adapted to the US Cantonese food with over-the-top decorations (again, to entertain the white people).  The reason I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the northern style, is they don\u2019t seem to be cooked the same way.  Anyway, that\u2019s the dumpling I grew up on.\n\nAt some point, in the 90s I think, that began to change.  The old school US places started to close as the owners aged, and new groups of immigrants started to come to the US.  We started to see restaurants, especially in NY and California, that were staying more loyal to the actual dishes of China.  At the same time, there was a rise of sketchy just-a-counter take-out places that bought frozen food they just reheated in the back (Ever wonder why they all have the *same* photos of the food?) Each of these types of places has motivations to keep their wrappers thin.  Authentic, because, that\u2019s what\u2019s authentic.  Restaurant kits get their food off site made in big factories.\n\nInterestingly, I\u2019ve found other sorts of dumpling like things in more authentic restaurants that totally have the vibe of what we\u2019re looking for.  The one I can remember off the top of my head is Everyday Noodles in Pittsburgh (yes there\u2019s a huge Chinese community due to the universities).  They call it the pan fried pork bun https://everydaynoodles.net/pittsburgh-everyday-noodles-food-menu. Unfortunately, their online menu does not contain the actual Chinese name that is on their paper menu, but it is roughly equivalent to the English.  The filling is what we remember and the wrapper is thick and chewy.\n\nThis is an incomplete, not thoroughly researched opinion of a 60 year old man who\u2019s mostly just been eating as much Chinese food he could since 1975.  u/mthmchris, can you help a Patron out?  What is the story of these dumplings?"]}

Instead, it has the consistency of actual ginger milk pudding. I just followed the youtube video's instructions step by step.\n\nTaste-wise, it was pretty good too! Though, I probably won't make this again because I much prefer the taste of cow milk in the pudding. I think I'll just stick to animal milk.\n\nThat and, I'm not a fan of the coloring. It's kinda.... yellowish. Very, *very* pale yellow. And there are bubbles at the edges that don't look very pretty. So, it's not as smooth as animal milk ginger pudding.\n\nBut still, thanks so much for the recipe! Because it made a yummy soy milky breakfast for me :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1i6ojsaov6se1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3c83b1f2343af00feeaf8d2fa2dd03ab3e6200c", "Thank you for sharing your findings.

You can put these things in a heat-proof bowl (preferably metal or ceramic) and pour very hot oil over them.\n\nNormally I would not do this in advance though. Make the dish, put a pile of these ingredients on top, pour hot oil directly on them.", "So this dish is one of a series of Sichuan dishes that were invented in the late 80's/early 90's based around Sichuan-style hot pot base.  It's not meant to be made from scratch per se but with that base as its foundational flavor.  Here's how I do it which is how they do it in the restaurants:\n\n1. Stir-fry your choice of base vegetables in some oil and a pinch of salt until just cooked.  I usually do bean sprouts, celtuce sliced on the diagonal, and reconstituted beancurd sticks but that's just what I like.  Place in a serving bowl.\n2. Clean and dry the wok.  Stir-fry a bit of minced garlic and ginger until fragrant.  Add in water (however much will fill your serving bowl with the vegetables in it) and bring to a boil.  Add in about a 4cm x 4cm chunk of the hot pot base (your favorite brand...be sure to buy the numbing spicy kind) and a tablespoon of light soy.  Once fully dissolved and at a rolling boil add about a teaspoon each of salt, sugar, and chicken powder.  Check for seasoning and adjust further the amount of each until it tastes right.\n3. Turn off the heat and add in your fish slices (premarinated for 20 min in 1 egg white, about a tablespoon of cornstarch, a pinch of salt and white pepper, and a splash of Shaoxing wine).  Cover the wok and let them poach for a minute or two until almost cooked.  Turn on the heat and bring up to a heavy simmer to finish the cooking and reheat the liquid, then pour everything over the cooked vegetables in your serving dish.\n4. At this point, the traditional way to finish is to top with Sichuan peppercorns/cut dried chili sections and then pour smoking hot oil over the whole thing.  What I like to do however is to heat up the oil in a small sauce pan and then add the Sichuan pepper and chili into that before pouring it over the fish.  It gives more time to infuse their flavors into the oil (no more than 10 seconds though or you risk burning them!).\n\n\\-----------  \nBefore people say this is a shortcut and 'inauthentic,' it's not.  The dish was literally based around pre-made hot pot base, just like when I was in America some casseroles were based around things like premade cream of mushroom soup concentrate.  Hot pot base is a common ingredient in Sichuan dishes and no need to obsess about making it from scratch just like people don't obsess about making their ketchup from scratch when they use it in a dish.\n\nNow, you absolutely can make your own hot pot base from scratch just like you can make ketchup or cream of mushroom soup if you wanted to, but most Sichuan restaurants aren't doing this unless they specialize in that sort of thing, and certainly not most Sichuan households.  Check out these videos for how to do it, and it'll also give you an idea of what kind of seasonings and spices are included in it:\n\n[Homemade Spicy Hot Pot Flavor Base Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HGsdOSnzss)\n\n[SPICY Sichuan Hot Pot Base Recipe (with Beef Tallow)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XbGCpeGfbw)", "What kind of dish was it?

It's also not actually that hard since you will essentially be marinating and spicing lamb and roasting it in the oven.\n\nHere's a simple recipe I found with the principle ingredient being a whole rack of lamb spare ribs:\n\n[https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/mongolian-roasted-lamb-breast](https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/mongolian-roasted-lamb-breast)\n\nThe only thing you'll have to search for is someone who will sell you a whole rack of lamb spare ribs. Since the seasoning and preparation methods are pretty straightforward here the cut of meat is going to be pretty important. You don't want to substitute shanks or leg of lamb unless you know what you're doing because the richness from the fat on the spareribs is key to this dish. Everything else you probably already have or get easily if you already cook canto-style dishes (Shaoxing wine, etc.)\n\nIf you want to cook other dishes or rake your girlfriend to other places she might light, I suggest looking for recipes and/or restaurants from Xinjiang or Central Asia since those areas have related culinary profiles.", "Twice Cooked Pork. This one is easy and even if you suck at cooking you can probably make this. \n\nOr\n\nMei Fun, which is just stir fry thin rice noodles with protein and veggies of choice. Obviously use Chinese veggies here. There are a lot of variations, one of which includes curry termed Singaporean stir fry noodles (not native to Singapore, Chinese folks made that part up but the name stuck) but the best mei funs I've had was always cooked by someone's momma using whatever meat and veg she could find and made with copious amounts of love. Sometimes it'd be gai lan, tofu and shitake with pork. Sometimes it's a vegetarian version of brocolli, carrots, cabbage, and bean sprouts. It sounds cheap but this is actually how a lot of Chinese people eat even in America because most people are poor but it is still delicious. If my gf made this for me it would definitely remind me of what my mom and grandma put together. Ah man when the temples used to dish these out on certain Chinese buddhist holidays cooked by a group of moms this was absolutely the fucking shit and I would always try to go back for thirds.\n\nBut would a person from Hong Kong be offended by your original comment? Maybe? They're definitely mainland China too before taken by the brits right?

Pork and chinese celery dumplings** \\- [Recipe here (without egg)](https://thewoksoflife.com/pork-and-celery-dumplings/#recipe). My family also adds 1 raw egg into the pork, celery and carrot mixture. It's also common to add chopped up shiitake mushrooms to these. There's a version of this recipe where the ingredients are minced pork (or chicken), chives, mushrooms and wood ear fungus (and 1 raw egg).\n\n**2. Pork and napa cabbage dumplings** \\- [Recipe here (without egg)](https://redhousespice.com/pork-cabbage-dumpling/#recipe). My family also adds 1 raw egg. The dried shrimp in the recipe is optional but it adds an extra shrimp-y, salty kick to the flavor. It's also common to add chopped up shiitake mushrooms to these. There's a version of this recipe where it's minced pork + shrimp, napa cabbage, mushroom and a lot of scallions. Meaning, minced shrimp (so finely minced until it's like a paste) is added to the minced pork and mix together with chopped up napa cabbage, mushrooms and a lot of scallions (and 1 raw egg).\n\n**3. Cantonese pork with mushroom, black wood ear fungus, and water chestnut dumplings** \\- Recipe [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ7bnhC_ryo). You can also replace the pork with minced chicken. There's a version of this dumpling where it's minced pork + shrimp, black wood ear fungus, shredded carrots and minced onions (but this version isn't Cantonese).\n\n**4.

Lamb and coriander dumplings** \\- [Recipe here](https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/moms-best-lamb-dumplings#wprm-recipe-container-15416). But instead of zucchini, my family puts in both coriander and scallions. Plus also 5 spice powder. We serve these lamb dumplings with the same hot and sour soup for beef dumplings above.\n\n**7. Shrimp, carrot, corn and broccoli dumplings**. This one was a viral recipe on China's internet space a couple of years back because kids love this one. Making these shrimp dumplings made me the favourite aunt among my nieces and nephews. How to make the filling:\n\nMarinate the raw shrimp with ginger juice for a couple of hours.\n\nFinely mince the raw shrimp until it looks like a paste. Make sure that the minced shrimp covers at least 1/3 of the ingredients (or slightly more), while the remaining 2/3 is made out of shredded carrot, corn, broccoli.\n\nBlanch the carrot, corn and broccoli before cutting them up. The carrots must be finely shredded. The corn must be in kernel form. The broccoli must be very finely chopped up. Also finely mince some onions, ginger and garlic until they look like a paste.\n\nMix everything with salt, white pepper, a teensy bit of sugar, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil like in the recipe for Pork and Chinese Celery Dumplings (but without Shaoxing wine).\n\n**8. Dried shrimps, eggs and chives dumplings.**\n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of this one but anyways... How to make the filling:\n\nScramble some eggs with salt, white pepper and finely minced garlic and set it aside. Once done, chop up the scrambled eggs into tiny pieces.\n\nSoak some dried shrimp in a water solution made out of water and some ginger juice for a few minutes (approximately 5-6 minutes) until the dried shrimp don't look so dry anymore. Take out the dried shrimp, and squeeze them to get rid of excess water. Then chop all of them up.\n\nMix the chopped up eggs and dried shrimp with chopped up chives, salt, white pepper, light soy sauce and sesame oil.\n\n**9. Minced chicken with shiitake mushroom and shredded carrot dumplings.** For instructions, refer to pork and chinese celery dumpling recipe at no. 1. There's a version of this dumpling where it's minced chicken + shrimp with shiitake mushrooms and shredded carrots. Sometimes, scallions are added too.\n\n**10. Minced pork, lotus root and corn dumplings.**\n\nHow to make the filling:\n\nMarinate the minced pork with salt, pepper, light soy sauce and hoisin sauce overnight.\n\nThrow some freshly cleaned chopped up lotus root into the blender and blend it until it looks finely minced.\n\nMix the marinated minced pork, blended lotus root, corn kernels evenly with 1 raw egg, finely minced garlic and ginger, white pepper, a teensy bit more light soy sauce (optional), a bit of Shaoxing wine and sesame oil.\n\nThere is a version of this dumpling where it is minced pork + chicken with lotus root and corn.\n\n**11. Minced pork and shrimp with corn, shredded carrot and scallions dumpling.**\n\nHow to make the filling:\n\nThe corn must be in kernel form.\n\nMarinate the raw pork and shrimp with ginger juice for a couple of hours before throwing both into a blender or chopping them up finely to make a pork and shrimp paste.\n\nAlso finely mince some onions, ginger and garlic until they look like a paste.\n\nMix everything with salt, white pepper, a teensy bit of sugar, light soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame oil and Shaoxing wine.\n\nThere is a version of this dumpling where finely sliced red chilli is also added.

That's the best combo. \n\nIf you want other options, I know a couple of cocktail and osmanthus wine recipes that you might be able to tweak to add sweet clover to. And uhm, all of the below are what me and my Chinese girlies jokingly call \"auntie\" cocktails or \"big sister\" (\u59d0\u59d0; jiejie) cocktails because they're all very \"uterus-friendly\". Meaning they're all good for a woman's reproductive system (or good for flawless skin) and thus, they are mostly enjoyed by women and not men. Whenever we girls party, 1 of us would make one of these for all of us to enjoy.\n\nNot saying that a man can't drink these. They can. They just don't really drink these. \n\nYou said you're Chinese so you might have already heard of some of the below: \n\n**\u6a59\u67da\u4e01\u9999\u5fae\u91ba\u70ed\u7ea2\u8336 (orange, pomelo and clove tipsy hot black tea)**\n\n1. Boil 1 juicy sweet orange, a couple of small pieces of pomelo flesh, a couple of slices of ginger and some cloves with your preferred Chinese black tea in a pot. You can replace the cloves with your sweet clover or you can just add your sweet clover to the tea on top of everything else. A friend once replaced the cloves in this recipe with a bit of sweet clover before. \n\n2. Add honey (or rock sugar) to sweeten the tea and let it boil.\n\n3. Once your tea has boiled, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for a couple of minutes.\n\n4. Once done, pour the tea through a fine mesh strainer into a jug and let it cool down a little until it's just slightly warm and not boiling hot. \n\n5. Just before you serve it, add orange liqueur (your preferred brand) and vodka. Or orange liqueur and Bacardi rum. Or if you want the alcohol part of this recipe to taste distinctly East Asian, then orange liqueur and your preferred brand of Chinese mijiu or Japanese sake. You can adjust the volume of both orange liqueur and vodka/Bacardi rum/mijiu/sake but we generally put 20ml of each (Estimated only because we tend to just eyeball it since none of us are bartenders... and we usually do the orange liqueur and vodka combo). \n\n6. You can also make it cold by adding ice or refrigerating the tea before putting in the alcohol (some bars in China do this). But, this cocktail is called \u70ed\u7ea2\u8336 (hot black tea) for a reason. \n\n**\u94f6\u8033\u9178\u5976\u9152 (White fungus/Silver tree-ear fungus yogurt wine)**\n\n1. Boil a small piece (or several small pieces) of silver tree-ear fungus, a couple of dried longans , 2 to 3 big Chinese red dates and some rock sugar with water to make sweet tea. You can add a little bit of sweet clover too. I have not tried adding sweet clover, but I have tried adding jasmine or osmanthus or chrysanthemum before. Still yummy!\n\n2. Once your tea has boiled, turn down the heat and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. \n\n3. Once done, let it cool down. You can throw away the red dates but keep the silver tree-ear fungus and the longan because you'll want to serve this cocktail with them. \n\n4. Pour the tea with a bit of silver tree-ear fungus and longan into a cocktail glass, add ice cubes, and then pour East Asian yogurt wine on top so that the white creamy yogurt wine creates cloudy white tendrils in the drink. \n\nYou are probably going to struggle finding Chinese yogurt wine in Canada (because afaik, they don't export Chinese yogurt wine overseas). But you are definitely going to find Korean or Japanese yogurt wine in Canada. Like Korean yogurt soju. But Korean yogurt soju is clear and not creamy white in colour so.... there'll be no cloudy white tendrils in your drink. The preferred end result of this drink should look like the pic below (Ignore the 1 single red date and shredded dried longan on top). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1pka07gs8pe1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3640e03b0d0c24675c052bb1ae19c42dab900e6a", "I would have a look at pu'er tea, and brew it with 70\u02daC water"]}

Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, and place a light weight on top for about 10 minutes to help press out excess moisture. Once pressed, slice it into cubes of roughly 2\u20133 cm. In a bowl, combine the chilli powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the tofu, stirring gently so each piece is coated. Allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\n\n   Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the ends, and cut it into wedges\u2014aim for around 6\u20138 wedges per onion, depending on its size. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers, then chop them into bite-sized chunks of about 2\u20133 cm. Set the vegetables aside while the tofu marinates.\n\n2. Warm 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. If using cumin seeds, add them first and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Tip in the tofu cubes (along with any remaining marinade) and fry for 5\u20136 minutes, turning occasionally, until they become lightly golden. Transfer the tofu to a plate.\n\n3. Add the onion wedges, green pepper, and red pepper to the same pan. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes, allowing the edges to caramelise lightly for extra depth of flavour. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Sprinkle in the ground coriander and garam masala, tossing the vegetables until they\u2019re well coated.

Let the sauce simmer for about 5\u20137 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\n\n5. Return the golden tofu cubes to the pan, folding them into the sauce so each piece is evenly coated. Add the chopped fresh coriander and stir. Cook for another 1\u20132 minutes to ensure the tofu absorbs all the flavours.\n\n6.

{"title": "A quick thought and curiosity on Chinese food and its many forms of flavour, as well as looking for culinary advice on sweet and umami recipes", "selftext": "To start out, I\u2019ve never been a big cook of Chinese food outside of literally 1 Chinese American staple (scallion noodles), but I have always been fascinated with Chinese food and learning how to cook it, from a casual love of American-Chinese when I was a kid to my growing curiosity in dishes outside the west.\nThe pitfall I come to is the latter category, where because of China\u2019s great culinary diversity, I just do not know where to start. Moreso, I realized the reason my search was failing for recipes I might like was because I didn\u2019t know how to articulate what sort of cooking I was looking for in the first place. There are many flavours in Chinese cuisine, and when someone looks for \u201cauthentic Chinese\u201d recipes and ideas, they\u2019re looking at a crazy amount of everything and anything, from the spiciness and stir fried of Sichuan cuisine to the seafood of Cantonese, and it seemed like none of it was quite what I was looking for in terms of flavour. However, I realize what I\u2019ve been looking for is healthy sweet and umami dishes with minimal ingredients, lots of veggies, less oil/stir fries, and hopefully noodle soup and dumpling dishes as well. Btw when I say sweet I mean with sweeter ingredients like certain sweet meats, sweeter tasting vegetables and fruits, lighter spices, not necessarily added cane/rock sugar. A far cry from my childhood orders of fried noodles and Mongolian beef but this is genuinely what I\u2019m really curious about. \n\nI\u2019m asking this question here not just for recipes (which are appreciated nonetheless) but for guidance. How do I narrow my search for Chinese dishes I might like? Are there regional cuisines that fit this profile? What should I cook to satisfy this craving? I hope this question isn\u2019t too vague, I am just very lost in this amazing world of Chinese cuisine.

Cantonese soups are often made by sacrificing the breast. Once the chicken breast has given its essence, it\u2019s often discarded. This is contrary to what most other cuisines do.\n\nAnother regional cuisine that has this profile is Shanghai cuisine. Again, lots of natural flavors from the ingredients.

Sure, store-bought plain chicken broth might lack some of the flavour complexity of a fancy homemade broth, but it's tasty enough to do the job.\n\nAn additional advantage is that this can all be cooked in one pot, either all-together or sequentially one at a time.

{"title": "PART 1: Grandma's Guangdong province style Cantonese roast duck recipe. Choosing and prepping the duck.", "selftext": "Okay, this one is a lot more complicated than I expected and I've tried my best to translate my grandma's recipe.\n\nHere's my grandma's Cantonese roast duck recipe as requested by a Redditor a few days ago. My grandma used to work as a chef in Cantonese restaurants in Guangzhou in her younger days and this is her sharing the recipe and all her duck roasting tips/hacks she learned throughout the years.\n\n**Choosing the right raw duck:**\n\nTechnically, any duck, frozen or freshly butchered will do but the perfect kind of duck are ones with the following criteria:\n\n* Regular white feathered meat ducks known as Pekin Duck or White Pekin Duck in English. De-feathered, cleaned and with all its innards removed.\n* Preferably between 2.5kg to 3.1kg, but we can also work with smaller or bigger ducks. Smaller ducks are easier to roast than bigger ones.\n* Plump (not too scrawny and not too fat)\n* Young female duck (softer meat/more tender) so that its skin is thinner, more delicate and firmer which is perfect for crispy duck skin\n* Preferably still has its neck and head but we can also work with ones that already had its head chopped off (headless raw ducks are more common in western countries)\n\n**Why a young, plump, female duck? Because...**\n\n1. Older ducks have tougher skin, with more visible fat layers right below the skin. Older ducks also have more sallow looking, flabby or looser skin. All of that affects the quality, taste and appearance of the skin when you roast it.\n2. Male ducks are bigger and leaner than female ducks, and bigger sizes are tricker to roast (Temperatures needed to be adjusted more than once while roasting). The meat of male ducks, being leaner than females also makes it less ideal to achieve that soft, tender and juicy Cantonese roast taste.\n3. Why the duck must be plump? Too scrawny and you don't get a lot of juicy meat. Plus you also get wrinkly duck skin (no fats to \"fill up\" the duck and smoothen skin creases). Scrawnier ducks with less fat also don't produce a lot of meat juices when roasted. But too fat and all the extra fat will make it all too greasy in a bad way.\n\n**\u203c\ufe0f From Google Images: You want a duck that looks like Pic 1** (Woks of Life) **and 2** (Viet Kitchen) **in this post and not like Pic 3** (Preciouscore.com)\n\nThe duck from Pic 3 is an older duck (loose, flabby, sallow and tough looking skin) and it is too fat. That yellow/sallow discoloration on most of the body except the limbs is actually the visible fat layers right under the skin and that's too much fat.\n\nIn Pic 1 and 2, you can see that the duck, while plump, is leaner than the duck in Pic 3. Also the skin of the duck in Pic 1 and 2 are thinner looking, more delicate, less visible fat layers and the outline of the duck's muscles are visible.\n\n**Prepping the raw duck:**\n\n* Open up the duck cavity and if there are globs of fat and leftover guts within, remove them.\n* Clean the duck again because there'll still be some bloody residue inside the duck and maybe even on some parts of its skin (despite having bought a duck that has already been cleaned). Rinse the insides of the duck cavity thoroughly. If you accidentally left any blood or bloody residue or leftover duck guts in the cavity, it'll ruin the taste of the roast.\n* Cut off the duck's legs at its \"knees\"\n* Cut off the duck's wings at the \"elbows\" / Cut off the wing tips.\n* Place the duck on a wire rack above a tray or use meat hooks to hang up the duck by its neck or its wings to air-dry for 1-2 hours. Or place a table fan near the duck to speed up the process. If you use a fan, then it only takes 1 hour\n\n[PART 2 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 3 OF THE RECIPE (END)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3s2tf0j88hne1.jpg?width=1300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31687445aabebaeaf1f0f6a7460443db9f9b0b0d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x949r9p98hne1.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfa3d5eb4780db8841340b3abdd979db6645324f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1abqdmta8hne1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=287b40be51bb32a2235747c833a574f885f7b6fd", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741443417.0, "score": 20, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thanks so much for posting this, I read all 3 parts and hope to try this soon.

If you can get ones from Zhejiang, China. That's even better.\n* 100ml of [Shaoxing Huadiao wine](https://www.malafood.com/en/the-ultimate-guide-to-chinese-cooking-wines)\n\n*If you don't have enough of the ingredients above (like if they are too expensive to buy in large amounts), see the list of instructions below for another way to baste/bathe the duck with less ingredients.*\n\n**How to baste/bathe the duck in maltose and red vinegar water? Instructions:**\n\n11. Fill a big stainless steel stock pot with water, enough to cover the entire duck. Put in all the ingredients from the list above. Stir the mixture and ensure that everything melts. Bring the water to a boil then turn off the heat.\n\n12. There are 2 methods to baste/bath the duck: 1.) [Lift the duck by the meat hook over the stock pot and then, one ladle at a time, pour the boiled watery mixture evenly over every inch of the duck a couple of times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AHD_ykPnDY). Or, 2.) Holding the top of the hook, dunk the entire duck up and down into the watery mixture a couple of times (like dunking a tea bag into hot water). **Do this for at least 10 minutes.**\n\n13. As you pour the watery mixture over the duck or as you dunk the duck into the water, you'll notice that the duck skin starts to shrink and tighten with every ladle/dunk. Keep ladling the hot watery mixture or keep dunking the duck until 1.) You are sure that every part of the duck has been covered by the mixture, and 2.) The duck's skin look tight all over. Every single nook and cranny.\n\n14. Discard the water.\n\nNow, if you don't have a big stock pot enough to dunk the entire duck in or you don't have enough of the ingredients to make a giant mixture of duck basting liquid, then:\n\n15. Just baste/bathe the duck in plain boiled hot water with a splash of white vinegar, and some green onions and ginger slices thrown in. Ladle the water over the duck or dunk the duck into the water repeatedly until the skin all over the duck looked tightened. **Do this for at least 10 minutes.**\n\n16. Then prepare a bowl of water mixed with the smaller amounts of the ingredients listed above for the duck bath and just pour the watery mixture over every inch of the duck. Make sure the liquid covers every single nook and cranny of the duck. Again, **do this for at least 10 minutes** to make sure that you thoroughly cover the duck skin with the maltose and red vinegar water. Once done, discard the water.\n\nFYI - This process of basting the duck or giving the duck a \"bath\" with maltose and red vinegar water helps in giving the duck a nice Chinese roast color during the roast later on.  Any missed areas (areas not covered by the maltose and red vinegar water) will not have a nice roast color so make sure you don't miss any spots.\n\nThe hot boiled water also helps remove any gamey duck smell and tighten up the duck skin so that when it's roasted, you'd have smooth crispy duck skin.\n\n**Air-dry the duck:**\n\n17. Hang up the duck to air-dry naturally for 12 to 24 hours or speed up the process by placing a table fan facing the duck and let the wind from the fan dry the duck for 8 to 10 hours (8 hours is fine).\n\n18. After the duck has been completely air-dried, then it's ready to be roasted. Touch the skin of the duck to make sure it is 100% dried. Make sure there are no damp spots like, in between skin creases or under the duck's \"armpits\" etc.\n\n19. If by the time your duck has dried and it's already late in the day, then refrigerate the duck and continue with the roast in the morning. Don't put it in the freezer, just put it in the regular side of the fridge so that it'll keep the duck chilled but not frozen.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n20. About 2-3 hours before roasting, take the duck out of the fridge and let it sit for 2 to 3 hours at room temperature. A cold duck won\u2019t roast evenly.\n\n21. Pre-heat the oven to 190\u00b0C. (My grandma said you can adjust the roasting temperature if you want to. The ideal temperature should be between 175\u00b0C to 195\u00b0C).\n\n22. Place the duck on a wire rack in the center of the oven. Place a large roasting pan at the bottom of the oven to collect any duck juices that may leak out while the duck roasts. Add half cup of hot water to the bottom of the pan to prevent any drippings from smoking as the duck roasts.\n\n23. Roast the duck for 45 to 50 minutes. Halfway through (about 20+ minutes), flip the duck so that both sides get roasted evenly.\n\n24. Once done, remove the duck from the oven, tent it with a piece of aluminum foil (large enough to cover the whole thing) and let it rest for approximately 20 to 25 minutes before serving.\n\n**Serve the duck:**\n\n25: When it is time to serve the duck, remove the skewer sealing the cavity and carefully pour all the fat and juices into a bowl. Remember to pour the juices through a fine-mesh strainer to catch any unwanted clumps.\n\n26. With a cleaver, cut the duck in half lengthwise from the top of the breast down through to one side of the backbone. Remove any aromatics in the cavity and discard.\n\n27. Cut off the stumpy wings. Also cut off the neck and the head. Discard these parts.\n\n28. Now, make a lengthwise cut along the backbone of one half of the duck (the half with the backbone attached) to remove the backbone.\n\n29. Cut everything up into bite-sized pieces. Cut the legs like you would drumsticks.\n\n30. Serve with duck meat with a dipping sauce. The duck juices can serve as a dipping sauce too.\n\nDipping sauce recipes [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j4hkab/comment/mgadjil/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j4hkab/comment/mgadkr3/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n[PART 1 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 2 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvfjbz0k8hne1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bf3780ecc51dea106a240c9d6cdbe9e3c2d198d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741444265.0, "score": 16, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Looks amazing!

{"title": "PART 2: Grandma's Guangdong province style Cantonese roast duck recipe. Seasoning, sealing the duck cavity and inflating the duck", "selftext": "**Ingredients for marinating the duck:**\n\n**Feel free to adjust the measurements according to your preference.**\n\n**Duck cavity - Ingredients for the dry rub:**\n\n* 2 teaspoons of [dried tangerine peel](https://thewoksoflife.com/make-dried-tangerine-peel/) powder: Take a couple of dried tangerine peel pieces and lightly roasted them by tossing the pieces into a pan or a wok without oil and roast them for a minute or two. Then, throw the lightly roasted dried tangerine peel into a blender and blend it into powder.\n* 4 teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder\n* 2 teaspoons of MSG (optional)\n* 30 grams of [\u5341\u4e09\u9999 (Chinese 13 spices)](https://adragonchef.com/the-five-spice/) \\--> with this ingredient, you don't need to add various aromatics individually like star anise, clove, Sichuan peppercorns etc.\n* 20 grams white sugar\n* 20 grams salt\n\nInstructions: Mix all of the above thoroughly in a small bowl and set aside.\n\n**Duck cavity - Ingredients for the wet rub:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon of Baijiu (but you can also use Shaoxing wine, especially [Shaoxing Huadiao](https://www.malafood.com/en/the-ultimate-guide-to-chinese-cooking-wines))\n* 15 grams of unsalted peanut butter (optional)\n* 15 grams of [\u829d\u9ebb\u9171 (sesame paste)](https://theplantbasedwok.com/chinese-sesame-paste/), also known as tahini but buy the Chinese version\n* 15 grams of [\u7d05\u8150\u4e73 (red fermented bean curd sauce)](https://zenzendream.com/product/haitian-classic-red-fermented-bean-curd-288g-%E6%B5%B7%E5%A4%A9%E8%85%90%E4%B9%B3%E7%BB%8F%E5%85%B8%E7%BA%A2%E6%96%B9/)\n* 25 grams of [\u8c46\u8c49\u9171 (Black bean sauce)](https://redhousespice.com/black-bean-sauce/). If I'm not mistaken [LKK has the regular black bean sauce](https://usa.lkk.com/en/products/black-bean-sauce) and another black bean and and garlic version. You can use either one. The original recipe calls for the regular one.\n* 25 grams of [\u8bf8\u4faf\u9171 (zhu hou sauce)](https://thewoksoflife.com/chee-hou-sauce/)\n* 25 grams of hoisin sauce\n* 25 grams of oyster sauce\n* 25 grams of light soy sauce\n* 35 to 40 grams of [fried minced garlic](https://www.seriouseats.com/crispy-fried-garlic-garlic-oil)\n\nInstructions: Mix all of the above thoroughly in a small bowl and set aside.\n\n**Duck cavity - Extra ingredients:**\n\n* A couple of green onions stalks\n* A couple of slices of ginger\n\n**Seasoning and sealing the duck cavity:**\n\n1. Rub the inside of the duck cavity thoroughly with the dry rub mixture from above. Make sure you cover every single nook and cranny inside the duck with the dry rub. Be generous with it. You don't have to use all the dry rub mixture on the duck because there'll definitely be excess. Just keep the extra unused powder to marinate something else.\n\n2. Do the same thing with the wet rub, as in, thoroughly coat the inside of the duck cavity with the sauce. Make sure you cover every single nook and cranny inside the duck with it. Be generous. Again, you don't have to use all the wet rub mixture on the duck because there'll definitely be excess. Just keep the extra unused sauce to marinate something else.\n\n3. Stuff the green onion stalks and ginger slices into the duck cavity as well.\n\n4. Stitch up the duck with a metal skewer like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_e4-3zQErM) to prevent the seasonings in the duck cavity from leaking out (and to prevent the duck juices from leaking out during the roast). Make sure you stitch up the flaps of the skin tightly. Lift the duck up to check to see if anything leaks out and redo if necessary (if you didn't do it tight enough).\n\n5. If you bought a duck without its neck and head (common thing if you're from a western country), then also stitch up the flap where the head should be with a metal skewer like in the [video link above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_e4-3zQErM).\n\n**Inflate the duck:**\n\n**FYI - You can also inflate the duck AFTER you have basted the duck/given the duck a maltose and red vinegar bath. See part 3 for instructions on how to baste the duck.** \n\nIt is **A LOT EASIER** to inflate the duck before basting the duck/before the maltose and red vinegar bath so my grandma recommends that you do it before the basting step. Since, most of you aren't trained Cantonese chefs with years of experience.\n\nSome Cantonese chefs inflate the duck after basting because they're skilled enough to tell which parts of the duck skin needed more \"help\" to look perfectly smooth even after the basting process (because sometimes, even after the duck skin tightens up from the basting, it still doesn't look smooth enough because of creases). So they know how to target those places on the skin that needed more \"help\" when it comes to inflating the duck. \n\n6. There should be a hole at the bottom of the duck head on the neck (where the duck was slaughtered). Insert a clean plastic tube attached to a small electric air pump (or you can use a [plastic handheld balloon pump](https://partymakersgreenville.com/shop/balloons/balloon-accessories/plastic-balloon-pump/)) into the hole on the neck. Hold the folds of the neck skin close around the tube to create a seal so that air won't leak out as you pump. [Like at 4:45 in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2qwqX3VQL4). If your duck does not have the neck still attached, then the opening at the neck is very large, seal a portion of the opening using skewers or butcher\u2019s twine before inserting the tube.\n\n7. Pump air in until you see the skin separating from the meat, all the way down to the leggy stumps. As the air is pumped under the skin, the duck will swell almost like a balloon.\n\n8. Flip the duck over and repeat this process because you need to inflate both sides of the duck.\n\n9. When the duck has been completely inflated on both sides, With the pump still attached, take a [6- to 8-inch/15-20cm length of butcher's twine](https://www.amazon.com/Vivifying-Cotton-Bakers-Cooking-Sausage/dp/B071V6VGG9/) and tie a knot around the neck of the duck, below where the pump is to seal in the air inside the duck. Then remove the pump.\n\n10. If you have a meat hook, then hook the duck up by its neck. <--- Preferred way. Or, if your duck does not have its neck and head attached, then hook the duck up by its \"armpits\".\n\nFYI - Inflating the duck will smoothen creases and wrinkles in the skin, it also separates the skin from the meat so it'll be easier to make the skin crispy during the roast.\n\nThis process is why my grandma advise against using older ducks for this recipe. Because older ducks have more skin creases and wrinkles so you'll have to do this process multiple times. Once after seasoning and sealing the duck cavity. Once after basing the duck in maltose liquid. Sometimes, one more time before the roast (if the duck is very old and big) and that is so inconvenient.\n\n[PART 1 OF THE RECIPE](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i2mc/part_1_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[PART 3 OF THE RECIPE (END)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6icjf/part_3_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "created_utc": 1741443696.0, "score": 9, "author": "Little_Orange2727", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j6i5vc/part_2_grandmas_guangdong_province_style/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

Lightly rinse the osmanthus flowers with clean water. Do not wet the osmanthus flowers too long or you'd also be rinsing away its floraly-y taste. After rinsing, put the osmanthus flowers into a sauce pot. fill it up with water (just enough to make sauce), add 2 tablespoons of rock sugar (the small pebbled ones) and 1 tablespoon of honey to the water and cook over medium heat\u00a0until the rock sugar dissolves. After the rock sugar dissolved, add a teaspoon of salt (preferably sea salt). Bring the heat down to low and let it simmer for another couple of minutes, approximately 10-15 minutes. Remember to stir until the sauce looks smooth. You can adjust the measurements of rock sugar, honey and salt to your taste. You can also skip the rock sugar and just use honey.\n\nOr.... you can buy osmanthus honey or osmanthus syrup/caramel from your nearest grocery store, put a couple of spoonfuls into a sauce pot with water and cook over medium heat until the syrup dissolves completely. Then add a teaspoon of salt into the mixture, bring the heat down to low and simmer for a couple of minutes. Done.\n\n2. **Peking sauce (in English), sweet bean duck sauce (in Chinese):**\n\nRecipe in English that is closest to the one my grandma was taught to make: [HERE](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/peking-sauce-duck-sauce/).\n\n3. **Northeastern Chinese-style sauce:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1/3 tablespoon of \u829d\u9ebb\u9171 (sesame paste), also known as tahini.

Recipe Included In The Comments", "selftext": "[Full recipe available here](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/vegan-dumplings-in-chilli-oil)\n\nIngredients: \n\nFor the Filling\n* 200 g firm tofu\n* 100 g mushrooms, finely chopped (shiitake or cremini work well)\n* 2 spring onions, finely sliced\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* \u00bd teaspoon salt\n* \u00bc teaspoon black pepper\n\nFor the Dumplings\n* 24 vegan dumpling wrappers \n\nFor the Chilli Oil Sauce\n* 3 tablespoons chilli oil (shop-bought or homemade)\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or tamari)\n* 1 tablespoon black vinegar (or rice vinegar)\n* 1 teaspoon sugar (or maple syrup)\n* 1 clove garlic, finely grated (optional)\n\nFor the Garnish\n* Chopped fresh coriander (cilantro) or microgreens\n* Toasted sesame seeds\n\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Place a heavy object (like a tofu press cast-iron pan or a few books) on top for about 10\u201315 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Once pressed, crumble it into small pieces\u2014aim for a texture similar to minced meat or small curds.\n2. Finely chop the mushrooms into small, even pieces so they cook quickly and distribute well in the filling. Thinly slice the spring onions, using both the white and green parts. Mince the garlic (or use a garlic press), and grate the ginger finely.\n3. In a\u00a0large mixing bowl, combine the crumbled tofu, chopped mushrooms, spring onions, minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and black pepper. Stir until everything is evenly incorporated. This forms your dumpling filling.\n4. Place a dumpling wrapper on a flat surface. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of filling into the centre. Dip your finger in water and run it along the edges of the wrapper. Fold and seal, pressing firmly to ensure no air pockets remain. You can pleat the edges or simply press them together\u2014choose whichever method you prefer, as long as the filling is fully enclosed.\n5. In a small bowl, whisk together the chilli oil, soy sauce, black vinegar, sugar, and grated garlic (if using). Set aside.\n6. Fill a steamer with water and bring it to a rolling boil. Line the steamer basket with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Place the dumplings inside, leaving a little space between them so they cook evenly. Steam for 6\u20138 minutes, or until the wrappers become translucent and the filling is cooked through. If you prefer a different cooking method, see the alternatives below for oven or grill, boiling, or air frying.\n7. While the dumplings are still hot, place them in a shallow bowl. Drizzle generously with the prepared chilli oil sauce, ensuring it seeps into every fold. Garnish with fresh coriander or microgreens and toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately and enjoy!\n\n\nAlternative cooking methods:\n\n* High-Heat Oven or Grill: Preheat your oven or grill to a very high setting (ideally around 370\u00b0C/700\u00b0F, if possible). Lightly brush or spray a tray with oil to prevent sticking. Arrange the dumplings on the tray and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the wrappers become lightly golden and crisp around the edges. The intense heat helps create a slightly charred flavour.\n\n* Boiling: Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil. Carefully drop in the dumplings and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain immediately, then serve with the chilli oil sauce.\n\n* Air Fryer:\u00a0Lightly coat the dumplings with oil. Air fry at 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F) for 8\u201310 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Toss or drizzle with the sauce right before serving.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ccfgl1fna9me1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1740912494.0, "score": 57, "author": "Whiterabbit2000", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1j1o8x8/you_have_to_try_these_delicious_flavour_packed/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Looks good!

If u can stomach it and rly after flavor u can try Haam Ha (fermented Chinese shrimp paste) or Foo Yee (fermented bean paste) these are more what we use (sesame oil/hoisin sauce are more for seasoning -or a bit in marinade-not used while cooking.)"]}

Recipes online always come out dry.", "selftext": "When I was eating in Hong Kong, the typical meal was served as a kind of soup you could say, with noodles, and then chicken breast or beef (often tender) in a sauce. The vegetables were a little fried sometimes, but often soft/boiled. The flavour profile came out in slices of thin ginger and aromatics like garlic, chilli. Maybe bean sprouts and others like peppers to spurce it up. It's too hot to drink at the start, but by the end delicious to drink or consume with a large plastic spoon. Let me share my love for this cusine: It was healthy, but not too strong that it sat in your stomache, and you could control the aromatics/chilli to avoid it affecting you (or your partner!). I enjoyed it and felt healthy. It really didn't feel like there was much soy sauce, frying, salt or oyster style going on.\n\nI found one place in the UK where they made something like this but they shut down. All the takeaways around me make very salty, dry, fried style food. Designed for chop sticks, not spoons.\n\nHere is the \"cooking problem\": I know about Sichuan style noodle soups. When I try to produce this in the UK, at least with ingredients I have found, the water never dissolves correctly. It's separate or the oil or flavour seperates, and comes to the top, etc. I am struggling to bring the taste into the water/infuse it well. I have tried boiling meats then using the water, or sauteeing vegetables, then putting water into that followed by salty meats fried seperately.\n\nAnd online, I cannot find much english speaking content showing how to cook this. People sauteeing vegetables and lightly frying chicken before putting soy sauce on at the end, forgive me if I am wrong, this feels like a westernised version.

While these adjustments improved the dish, I still haven\u2019t quite achieved the rich, complex taste found in restaurant versions.\n\nI don\u2019t think maltose is the missing ingredient since it\u2019s mainly used during blanching. There\u2019s something else that brings out that signature depth of flavor, and I\u2019m still figuring out what it is.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1iseatr/trying_to_perfect_chinese_restaurantstyle_chicken/", "created_utc": 1739890025.0, "score": 8, "author": "WarKingJames", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1iseatr/trying_to_perfect_chinese_restaurantstyle_chicken/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Use [this recipe](https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/chicken-feet) instead of Cici Lee's (because Cici Lee's version is the healthier version so it's uhm.... less flavorful). Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wny2mFInlqo).\n\nI learned to cook the Cantonese style dimsum chicken feet from my maternal grandmother who's from Guangzhou and I don't know if our chicken feet recipe is restaurant worthy but... my grandma used to work in a Cantonese restaurant in her younger years.\n\nIf you feel like the taste of your dish isn't as rich as ones you've ate in restaurants then one possible reason is that you might not have gotten rid of all the impurities in the chicken feet.\n\nWhen prepping the chicken feet, did you rub all of them down with plenty of salt? Follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2ZPYlTb8o8) on how to correctly prep chicken feet. But, do NOT cut off the claws while prepping them. If you cut off the claws too early, your chicken feet will shrink into skinny little things when you fry them, making them chewy and sometimes, rather tough instead of soft (soft is preferred).\n\nOnly cut off the claws AFTER you have blanched the chicken feet. So that the chicken feet retains its meaty shape during the frying process.\n\nAlso, please understand that a lot of Cantonese restaurants tweak the recipes to make them special so the ingredients they used might not be the same as the recipes you found online.\n\nThat said, when blanching, on top of the ingredients provided by the recipe link above, also add lemon peel or orange peel. Then also add either lemon juice or ginger juice. My grandma uses orange peel and ginger juice (she eyeballs it so I don't know the exact amount of ginger juice but I'm estimating it at about 3-4 tablespoons).\n\nAlso use COLD WATER (or room temperature water) to start when blanching and not warm water. This is important!\n\nWhen it comes to Chinese cooking wine, my grandma uses specifically [\u82b1\u96d5 wine](https://www.malafood.com/en/the-ultimate-guide-to-chinese-cooking-wines) (Huadiao). \u82b1\u96d5 wine is aged \u7ecd\u5174\u52a0\u996d wine. Basically Huadiao wine is a type of Shaoxing wine but personally, I think it's way more fragrant than regular Shaoxing. Huadiao also taste better in dishes. Restaurants don't all use the same type of Shaoxing wine in their cooking, it's possible that different Cantonese restaurants use different types of Shaoxing wine so it all depends on preference. Some restaurants even use baijiu or different types of baijiu. Or even beer. Several of my aunts in Foshan, Zhongshan and Shenzhen use beer when cooking this dish.\n\nDo not use canola oil. Use either corn oil or peanut oil. Canola oil is very mild (and healthy lol) when it comes to flavor and it isn't fragrant at all. I'd recommend corn oil. But I've been told that peanut oil will make the dish even more flavorful. Also don't put olive oil like in Cici's recipe.\n\nNext, when it comes to the ice bath after frying, don't soak the chicken feet in the ice bath for too long, 10-15 minutes would do. Post-ice bath, you can also use a fork or something sharp to poke holes in the chicken feet (especially the bottom pad of the feet, the \"sole\" of the feet so to speak) so that it'll absorb more flavor during the braising process.\n\nJust like the cooking wine, different Cantonese restaurants use different combinations of sauces when it comes to the second part of the recipe: the sauce for braising the chicken feet. Some would add XO sauce or replace the oyster sauce with scallop sauce or use both oyster sauce and scallop sauce or other sauces. My grandma uses scallop sauce instead of oyster sauce and she'd use [\u67f1\u4faf\u9171](https://thewoksoflife.com/chee-hou-sauce/) as well on top of hoisin to enhance the hoisin-like flavor.\n\nWhen braising, make sure that the water covers at least 3/4 of the chicken feet with only the top part exposed. Use HOT WATER. Not warm water. Not room temperature water. But HOT WATER.\n\nBraise the chicken feet in a smaller pot. View the video link above to understand why.\n\nYou can braise it slightly longer for up til 60 minutes. Some people believed this will make the dish more flavorful. My grandma only braised it for 45-50 minutes though.", "This recipe gets it closer in my opinion so maybe compare? \u00a0https://curatedkitchenware.com/blogs/soupeduprecipes/cantonese-dim-sum-chicken-feet-recipe\u00a0.

However, this is often at the expense of showcasing the extreme diversity of Chinese food - many of which cuisines are not exposed in the US, since the more regional niche cuisines and dishes won't sell to those unfamiliar with the niche cuisines.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/chinesefood/comments/1i8p3mg/would_there_ever_be_enough_financial_support_in/", "created_utc": 1737699477.0, "score": 6, "author": "5Pats", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/chinesefood/comments/1i8p3mg/would_there_ever_be_enough_financial_support_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I live in SF and off the top of my head I can name  restaurants devoted to Taishan food, chaozhou food, Hong Kong cafe food, Yunnan noodles, Guilin noodles and Muslim Chinese food.", "The main obstacle in SF area would be the operating costs and staying afloat.

Fujian is a notable gap in LA (1-2 places are arguably Fujian, but only the southwest side of the province)\u2014a gaping absence compared to NYC which is overrun with Fuzhou food.\n\nIf I'm being honest, Seattle kind of sucks in my opinion. So, that's not really in the mix. \n\nNYC, YVR, and LA are the kings of Chinese food at the moment, very followed closely by SF and Toronto. The reason those two very slightly\\*\\* follow is that they are *relatively* more Hong Kong/Cantonese saturated. \n\nSo, since the places you named are already well set up, I'd modify your question to ask whether *other* urban centers will go in that direction and under what circumstances.\n\nAnd I honestly don't think Hunan is well represented (i.e. outside of the top-tier areas). Sichuan, yes, but not Hunan. Fake places masquerading as Hunan, maybe.\n\nThree final points:  \n1) There is still much much more that could be represented even in the top-tier areas. You could even say people are a little bored. Locals can't get enough of new/different things. We lost Guizhou food in LA some years ago, and now I've just heard there's a new one opened and I'm so excited.  \n2) On the downside, some of the nominally regional cuisines become caricatures of themselves. (I have mentioned this before.) Mark my words: Lanzhou la mian is going to be *everywhere*. I ate it in Ottawa, for example, a place which generally sucks for Chinese food.

Similarly, \"Yunnan\" restaurants are going to spread, but I think they will be mostly \"crossing the bridge noodles.\" Jiangsu food is everywhere now...but only if you accept its token representation as soup dumplings.  Guangxi = \"Guilin rice noodles.\" These places feel less like outlets for the regional cuisines and more like stereotypical excerpts of the cuisines that you'd find in, say, Beijing.  \n3) There is other differentiation besides region. BBQ, hot pot, mao cai, deli, mala tang, and a bunch of other miscellaneous things I don't really have a category for. Like, chicken burgers (Chinese style) are a big thing. Or, congee-focus. Or \"Hey, come here and eat a bunch of...umm...crab things!\" \"Potato noodles.\" There's a place here that's like \"Stuff you remember eating back in your school days,\" lol.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*SF and Toronto people: Please don't have a cow.

And not only that, these cuisine styles have even completely displaced sweet and sour pork and HK-style Cantonese cuisine in the minds of Westerners when \"Chinese cuisine\" is mentioned.\n\nI was told that this is partly to do with food writers such as Fuchsia Dunlop, and also partly due to the huge number of China Chinese immigrants and overseas students who have moved to the West over the past 25 years.  They are not Cantonese and thus they have brought their home regions' cooking to the West.  Some people even now claim that Cantonese cuisine is obsolete in the West, while Sichuan/Hunan/Beijing/barbecue skewers are the \"hip\" thing,\n\nIs this correct, or does Cantonese cuisine still reign supreme?

Sichuan and Hunan food have always had a bit of a foothold in the US, but it\u2019s not true to those regions until recently with the third wave of Chinese immigrants from the mainland. Taiwanese food is also pretty popular. But things like Shanghainese and skewers are starting to pop up, at least in LA. There\u2019s a pretty famous Xian chain in NYC now as well. A lot of the regional cuisines popularity will match immigration patterns, so large cities like SF, LA, NYC will see quantity, authenticity and variety more widely. But that doesn\u2019t mean smaller cities aren\u2019t seeing these either. I\u2019ve had good Sichuan food in places like Tulsa, or Shaanxi food in Omaha. Universities are probably driving this, but also jobs. As more mainland immigrants come to the US and settle, you\u2019ll see less and less \u201cAmericanized\u201d Chinese restaurants. \n\nBut yah. The waves of Chinese immigrants, first from Guangzhou, then TW/HK and now mainland China does shape what we get here.", "So I\u2019m not the expert on this at all, but I have been studying the anthropology of Chinese food in America in school for the last few years.\n\nI do think that Cantonese cuisine is not as popular as it once was, I see two major reasons. 1. Like you said there\u2019s an influx of immigrants not just from Guangzhou. 2. There is a big cultural attitude in America for the last decade or so, about having \u201cauthentic\u201d foods and cuisines. For many this manifested as opposing Chinese-American food which is heavily derived from Cantonese cooking coming to California and then spreading outwards. Instead of having a dish that to many Americans seems \u201cunauthentic,\u201d why not try that spicy dish called mapo dofu or stop by a Lanzhou hand pulled noodle shop for a fun and \u201cauthentic\u201d experience. \n\nI also am not trying put any negativity on anyone by using quotation marks, this is just the way that food trends happen. There is also a much larger discussion about race and how non-Chinese people view Chinese people (and other cuisines that get co-opted or changed). But, again, this is how culture works with immigration, there\u2019s waves as things ebb and flow.", "Not around my area, which is one of the major Chinese suburbs of the Greater Toronto Area. Highly subjective, but seeing more westerners hit up the Cantonese places, and more so the HK-style Cha-Chaan-Tengs in the area, as well as the hot-food section of the T&T Supermarket chain (which still seems to serve mostly Cantonese-style options).\n\n  \nThat being said, the local Chinese fusion-style AYCE buffet still attracts a lot of western clientele because there's a bit of everything, but the flavor of the Chinese dishes are generally still Cantonese-leaning. But the line for the AYCE Peking Duck station is always crazy =P.", "In western Canada like Vancouver & Calgary/Edmonton, mass amounts of HK/Canto immigrants came much earlier on and became well established, also those of Vietnamese - Chinese backgrounds who fled the war, many of who were of Canto backgrounds. \n\nIn the last 10 years more mainland origin have come but legit HK has never left since the initial wave. The longstanding banquet/wedding style places and HK cafe style restaurants are still here. \n\nVancouver and adjoining cities like Burnaby and Richmond you almost can't find \"western Chinese\" restaurants vs the legit ones, Calgary and Edmonton you can still find many western Chinese places but if you want og legit Cantonese (or mainlander) food, you can also have that as an option.\n\nNon Chinese westerners here still will frequent the western Chinese places often but I see many become adventurous and try the legit stuff. They seem to frequent T&T as well out of curiosity but also get food at the deli.", "So Cantonese food definitely dominated early Chinese cuisine in the US, so for a lot of people, especially outside of major cities, their experience of Chinese food in the US was largely mediocre, sweet Americanized Cantonese food. In the past 30 years, that\u2019s started to change. You still see a lot of inexpensive \u201cChinese\u201d restaurants that are still selling that type of food. However, now there is a lot more Chinese regional restaurants available, again, more common in larger cities and getting less common in smaller and rural communities. Often though, you will see on the menu, they still have a section devoted to that older Americanized Cantonese food because some people still expect it.\u00a0", "Depends on where. I live in the northeast us  (Boston suburbs) and Sichuan food is popular. We still get plenty of Sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken, egg rolls, pork fried rice etc in takeout places. We used to have a restaurant that specialized in X\u2019ian noodles but they closed. I\u2019m hoping more regional cuisines will become available. I had Lanzhou noodle soup in Vancouver a few years ago and it was amazing", "Foodies to some extent are aware but the mass majority of the US population still thinks of Chinese as the takeout meal. Dunno how to break it down to people that trying to quantify the cuisine of a landmass with a history that goes back 5000 something years and among the countless regional styles that it\u2019s still being innovated on every single day is more than a life times work. \n\nI say this also while paying the upmost respect to Chinese American cuisine - folks need to divorce themselves from the idea that just because it didn\u2019t naturally spring up from the mainland that it isn\u2019t authentic. American Chinese still has its concepts rooted from Cantonese cuisine and reinforced by 170 something years now of history. To look down on American Chinese food as something less than just because you can get it at a Panda Express is a disrespect to the lived experiences of immigrants for over a hundred years. \n\nIt\u2019s not lesser than. It\u2019s just one of the more recent pages added to the book.", "Most people in the west definitely don't have access to many kinds of authentic Chinese food...even here in Seattle where there is large number of Chinese immigrants, drive north or south for 1 hr and you are back in Chop suey and egg foo yang land.", "I\u2019d suggest some mix of Americanized Szechuan / Hunan has well overtaken Cantonese and it\u2019s been that way for sometime.  \n\nThis shift has also seen more dim sum etc to \u201creplace\u201d Cantonese to a degree imo.", "We were eating Sichuan in New York in the 1980\u2019s.", "I love Sichuan.", "What I observe here in Europe is that a huge proportion of ingredients, fresh or dry are simply not available because of import law prevents it or lack of market, making it very challenging to cook authentic Chinese food. Of course, there are some possibilities like making wheat based food, noodles, bing,... which is loved by most people in the world, but in term of protein and vegetables choice, it's quite restricted. There is also the fact that westerners just can't accept some texture like cartilage , gooey stuff, alive ingredients, grinding bones, congee... You can't have an authentic \u767d\u5207\u96de that still is a bit bloody because of \"hygiene\" issues.\nAlso in Europe, even if you overlook the problem of ingredients availability and personal tastes, you can count the restaurants that serve Chinese food cooked with proper technique on your hands. The situation is probably better in North America I guess.", "Commenting after a lot of others have already chimed in...  \nThe first Xi'An food I ate was in Auckland in 2013!\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \nThere's a misconception that \"Americans\" \"Americanize\" food\u2014with the meaning that a cuisine is shamelessly altered to cater to \"local\" taste, and that this is intrinsically characteristic of \"America.\"   \n  \nTo be fair, this concept is not strictly reserved for USA, but there is also a habit of holding up the USA as if it represents the extremity and the model case. \n\nTo be critical, this phenomenon is not only common in virtually all parts of the world but also is probably not as pronounced in USA as in many other regions. I think India, for instance, \"Indianizes\" Chinese food to a far far greater degree than USA \"Americanized\" it. USA, specifically, is far less bent on assimilation than self-critical, no-passport Americans whine about it being. As much as assimilating to a society is a common part of immigration, USA offers freedom for immigrant cultures to continue in their own vein. I mean, an immigrant has to learn to us the Post Office or whatever, but mostly they can just go on with their cultural way of doing things. In *modern times,* there is not a great amount of bullying from natives to be a certain way. Americans are more like \"you don't bother us and we won't bother you.\" The theme of conformity tends to crop up in melodramatic and clich\u00e9 tales of kids who say \"I brought my Filipino mom's chicken adobo to school lunch and all the other kids said I was stinky!\" It's both an exaggeration and something that I think the tellers of these tales are basing on some old legend, and they fail to parse the evergreen dynamics of how school children interact from a specific \"pressure to assimilate\" ideology. \n\nPeople who sort of agree with what I've said so far might take objection to what I'm about to say. Which is that I think Canada and more so Britain are more assimilationist than USA *to some degree*. I don't mean those countries are bad, just that if there is a scale, on this metric, they are more than 0% more assimilationist. I think there is a greater sense in UK that \"this is the British way,\" that way being English backed up by a political nation. Whereas people in USA have less consensus on what is \"the American way\" and consequently there is less of a thing that can coherently be imposed. The \"Alabama Way\" and the \"California Way\" are divergent enough that an Alabama person relocating to California could legitimately feel as much pressure of assimilation as a an international immigrant. Remember, one half the US supports Republicans and the other half supports Democrats, making a unified \"American Way\" hard to come by and weak to impose.\n\nThe other shoe dropping: So if USA, Canada, UK (examples) are somewhere on the spectrum, other countries are elsewhere on the spectrum. My feeling of HK is it is, again somewhat more toward the assimilationist. There's a twinge of Britishness there, and the Cantonese are often chauvinistic. \n\nAll this means, to me, that \"mainland\" cuisines taken to HK are more subjected to \"shameless adaptation to local tastes\" than when taken to the wide open of capitalist America. Here comes a non-Canto family from China, wants to open a restaurant, and if they don't choose to go the route of joining the old \"takeout\" system, then they just make a restaurant with their cuisine. Canto cuisine is nowhere on their mind. Neither do they have much clue of what \"Americans\" expect. They just do it. If they're savvy, they do it near a university with Chinese students.", "Definitely a big change in the U.K. over the last decade or so.  It used to be rare to find restaurants serving anything other than a highly Westernised version of Cantonese food anywhere outside a few Chinatowns in big cities.  Nowadays, because of the huge numbers of Chinese students here, there are multiple restaurants in any University town serving pretty authentic non-Cantonese food with an emphasis on spicy dishes popular in modern Chinese cities.", "As a Brit who grew up eating mostly Cantonese style, I much prefer Sichuan food. I love Chinese food in general, but Sichuan is definitely my favourite :)", "I'm based out of NYC.  So Canto style food is basically HK cafes, Canto BBQ, Canto noodle houses, and Canto banquet style food.\n\nEverything else is from other provinces.  The chain Famous Xi'an, Lanzhou Pull noodles, Shanghai soup dumplings, etc.\n\nPlaces like Flushing basically thrive on food from other provinces.", "Speaking as a UK resident in a city with a lot of Chinese students and restaurants made to serve them that also became popular with locals:\n\nHK/Cantonese still reigns supreme (or at least the Brit flavour of it, I often don't recognise American dishes of the same lineage).  There are 5 takeaways/restaurants serving that to one Sichuan place, and three times that to other cuisines.  \n\nBut that's because HK/canto takeaways are so ubiquitous, especially in the suburbs. There's two of them on my street.  When it comes to sit down restaurants (which also serve the takeaway market) it's a lot more even.", "I don\u2019t think that the majority of white and black Americans can\u2019t even name a Chinese dish that isn\u2019t from the Cantonese cuisine.", "I'm in the Midwest U.S., and there are many more Sichuan and Hunan restaurants here.", "not in the US except within diaspora communities", "Sichuan has become quite popular in Italy in the past 8-10 years, with at least a couple restaurants in major cities with Florence having a larger than most number due to tourism and the biggest Chinese community in Italy just outside the city in nearby Prato.\n\nIn the city center of Turin there's a very popular takeaway restaurant offering Jianbing.\n\nMilan, having probably been the first chinese community in Italy has lots of different chinese restaurants, with via Paolo Sarpi being at the heart of it.\n\nBarbecue skewers are also not that difficult to find, as restaurants offering hotpot.\n\nIn Italy the classic \"bland westernized chinese restaurant\" has struggled since all you can eat sushi became popular, so most of the new Chinese restaurant are trying to offer a more authentic and varied offering to attract more trade.", "I\u2019m in North Carolina and the number of Szechuan and hot pot restaurants just keeps multiplying. And I\u2019m all for it! When I moved here in 2008, when you went to a Chinese restaurant you\u2019d have to ask for the \u201csecret\u201d menu. Not so anymore.", "I think it depends on the country a lot. I'm more accustomed to Sichuan and Xian food than Cantonese, and my HK dorm mate said that there aren't really any Cantonese food in Stockholm. There are a lot of \"Swedish-Chinese\" restaurants though, but I can't really discern the origin of those dishes. But it would be super interesting to know!", "I think it's so interesting to see these changes in western cities. You have old school American-Chinese (or British-Chinese, etc) places that have long met the needs of the local culture. And now you have the newer places that lean more towards the needs of Chinese students, tourists, expats, and new immigrants, coming from very different regions from earlier waves. They're completely different cuisines and styles feeding very different groups of people.\n\nBut they've also expanded how local populations think of Chinese restaurants and Chinese cuisine, including myself. It's also interesting to see the differences in a place like Paris, where you would have struggled to find any variety in regional Chinese food 10 years ago, and now can find plenty of options (though still lagging behind London).\n\nI think what's really driving it is the explosion in Chinese wealth, travelling, studying abroad, etc. throughout the 1990s-2010s. Writers like Fuschia Dunlop have helped move it along, but it's really a symptom of a huge economic and cultural shift.", "I can't speak for everyone here, but in my family we make \u9ebb\u5a46\u8c46\u8150 from Sichuan and \u6cb9\u6cfc\u626f\u9762 from Shaanxi at least 2 or 3 times a month at home.\n\n\n I should note that we are white as rice lol we just really like regional Chinese cuisine."]}
