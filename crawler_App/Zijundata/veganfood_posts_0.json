From the Herbivorous Butcher in Minneapolis, MN. Pastrami, capicola ham, pepperoni, mozzarella, arugula, cherry pepper relish, garlic mayo and red wine vinegar. I am visiting my BIL and his wife for the weekend and they are vegan. We always go to restaurants that offer options for them and also my wife & I who are not vegan. They love to share and I am never one to turn anything down. I don't think I havent had anything I didn't like except the green bean casserole at Thanksgiving but even they didnt like it due to using a v cream cheese they had never used before. \n\nAnyways, this was my first trip to a vegan butcher and it was amazing! So many different types of meats and cheeses, from korean short ribs & filet mignons to fresh mozzarella and an alfredo sauce. I decided to fully immerse myself since I LOVE Italian hoagies and i was glad i did! No it wasnt 1:1 but it was delicious standing on it's own and I would certainly get it again and keep my eye out to try new sandwiches. Just last night I had a bite of my BIL's mock duck po'boy which was also pretty tasty. \n\nhttps://www.theherbivorousbutcher.com/pages/butcher-shop", "Looks great"]}

Highly recommend. It helps you achieve a flakier, lighter crust, and the vodka prevents gluten development (where water would stimulate it, and give you a firmer crumb). I also used all unrefined coconut oil, and it worked out just fine and lent a nice coconut scent/flavor to the pastry.\n\nUsed School Night Vegan's frangipane recipe: https://schoolnightvegan.com/home/vegan-frangipane-tarts/\n\nI think whipping up the aquafaba really helps give you a glossier, non-grainy texture for the frangipane. Adding a small amount of baking powder helps it rise ever so slightly, to closely mimic how an egg-based frangipane would react in the oven.\n\nYou really can use practically any seasonal fruit. I had a craving for peaches, they're absolutely perfect this time of the year, and although I live in Chicago now I had a bunch of Georgia peaches and peach jam mailed to me (yes they're that good).\n\nThese were brought in to work with me, and my non-vegan coworkers absolutely loved them!", "Looks amazing", "Recipe please?", "Looks amazing", "Mouthwatering tart.

The 5 del pastor taco promo is great for when you\u2019re on a budget. My favorite was the Taco Big Beb\u00e9 and Big Beb\u00e9 torta. If you are a vegan cheese fanatic, try their costra de queso. They have a full restaurant and a street stand, the stand has less stuff but is just as great. \n\nGracias Madre taqueria Vegana: Their Gracias Madre torta is fucking amazing. \n\nAbasto Vegano: this place is a plant based mini market. You wont find cheapest cheese and other supplies which can be expensive \n\n31 Gatitos: This is a cat cafe. Their pastries like the Apple Strudel and tiramisu are brilliant. Also, cats. \n\nIf you go to Coyoacan, try Vege Taco. They make an amazing vegan variant of the Chile en Nogada. Their Mole Poblano taco was my favorite I tried in Mexico. It\u2019s an affordable vegetarian restaurant with solid vegan options. \n\nThose are all pretty budget friendly, there\u2019s also some more expensive options like vegamo, Goy\u2019s Burgers and Groovy\u2019s but yeah. I didn\u2019t go to those much. Just Vegamo and their green enchiladas are amazing.", "Is this from an app?"]}

Scrape down the sides and smooth the surface.  \n\u25a2  \nCover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 10 minutes (Let the arepa flour absorb the liquid and relax completely. Do not skip this step).  \n\u25a2  \nThe dough should be divided into four portions. Roll one portion into a ball. You will need to press the ball between your palms to form a disc 0.5 inches thick (see video for visual aid). You can adjust the thickness to your preference. Wet your fingers with water and gently pat along the edge if it cracks on the sides.  \n\u25a2  \nSpray a bit of oil in a large non-stick skillet and heat on medium heat. Pan fry each side for 3-4 minutes until lightly golden brown.  \n\u25a2  \nPlace on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake in the oven for 18-20 minutes (or in the air fryer) until slightly puffed and golden brown.

In the tofu, add the chopped jalapeno pepper, chili powder, cumin, salt, vinegar, and lemon juice - mix well to make sure all the tofu is evenly covered in the mixture. Be careful not to mix too harsh, you don't want to break the tofu - so be gentle. \n3. Add the gram flour and 2 tbsp water (a little at a time) to make a thin paste - this will help the tofu come out crispy\n4. If you're using food coloring, add it in last and give it a good mix. Remember to only add a small pinch, a little bit goes a long way. \n5. Transfer to a baking sheet and sprinkle on the curry leaves - bake in a preheated oven at 475\u00ba for 15 minutes\n6.

Preheat oven at 350\u00ba\n2. Curdle the milk by combining the unsweetened almond milk and 1 tbsp vinegar, set aside. \n3. Mix all the the dry ingredients into a large bowl and set aside\n4. Start on the wet ingredients by mashing the banana - I used my stand mixer with the whisk attachment to make sure it was completely smooth\n5. With the paddle attachment on, add in the syrup, applesauce, vanilla, and curdled milk to the banana. Mix well for about 1 minute\n6. Slowly add in the dry ingredients and mix until well combined (about halfway through, scrape down the sides to make sure you get all of the mixture)\n7. While the mixer is still on, add in the boiling water. This will make the batter runny and that's okay - that's what we want. \n8. Transfer to your nonstick bundt pan and bake for 50-55 minutes\n\nLet cake cool for about half hr before transferring to a cooling rack and another half hr before frosting your cake. \n\n**For the ganache frosting:** \n\nHeat up 2/3 cup of coconut milk and whisk in 1 1/2 cups of vegan chocolate chips - whisk until smooth. \n\n**How to frost your cake:** \n\nAgain, it's a personal preference. I chose to cover the entire cake with the ganache, but you can take a spoon and just lightly drizzle the ganache over.", "For anyone making this, I personally recommend valrhona cocoa powder (Amazon or Walmart or Whole Foods)!

Even the chocolate icing is dairy free and vegan friendly!\r  \n\r  \nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here, which includes a few additional tips! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw) \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r\\-----\r  \n**INGREDIENTS**\r  \n\r  \n**Chocolate Cake**\r  \n180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour\r  \n198g (1 cup) granulated sugar\r  \n6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda)\r  \n3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\r  \n40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder\r  \n80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil)\r  \n15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or other light vinegar such as white vinegar or rice vinegar)\r  \n5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\r  \n236ml (1 cup) water\r  \n\n\n**Chocolate Icing**\r  \n170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar)\r  \n30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder\r  \n45ml (3 tbsp.) water\r  \n5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\r  \n\r  \n\\-----\r  \n\r  \n\r**Method**\r  \n\r  \n1. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F and line an 8\u201d square pan with parchment paper.\r  \n\r  \n2. To a mixing bowl add 180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour, 198g (1 cup) granulated sugar, 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt, 6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda) and 40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder. Whisk this together until thoroughly combined and the mixture is uniform in colour.\r  \n\r  \n3. To 236ml (1 cup) water add 15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or alternative light vinegar) and 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract. Just give that a little stir!\r  \n\r  \n4. Add your water-vinegar liquid to the dry ingredients, along with 80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil). **Mix this quickly**. You want to get this batter into the oven as fast as possible in order to achieve the best rise! A few lumps in the batter is fine, but try to get as much of the flour mixture combined as possible.\r  \n\r  \n5. Pour your deliciously chocolate cake batter into your prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n6. Now onto the vegan chocolate icing! To a mixing bowl add 170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar) and 30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder. Mix these ingredients together and then add 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract.\r  \n\r  \n7. Add in water, one tablespoon at a time. I used 45ml (3 tbsp.) for the perfect consistency. Your icing should be thick enough to remain on your cake, but thin enough to spread easily.\r  \n\r  \n8. Remove your cake from the oven, let it cool to room temperature, spread your chocolate icing over the top and let the icing set. If you want to dress your cake up, feel free to add sprinkles, chocolate shavings or your favourite candy on top!\r  \n\r  \n9. Cut into equal squares with a sharp knife \u2013 and serve!!\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of the best vegan chocolate cakes I've ever baked. It's rich, chocolatey and really moist! It's also great a few days after baking and surprisingly, remains moist! I gave a few squares of this cake to my friends and none of them could tell it was a vegan recipe.

Preheat oven to 400\u00ba F\n2. Make the parmesan cheese - add the cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, and salt to a **food processor** and pulse until it reaches a fine powder like texture. Keep 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese aside for the recipe - store the rest in an air tight jar.\n3. Before you cut, you need to press your tofu - either use a **tofu press** or you can place your tofu brick in a thin kitchen towel and place a heavy object on top of it for 35-40 mins. \n4. Cut your tofu in your desired shape - I cut them in fillet shapes. I cut them horizontally in thirds and then with the tip of my knife, I cut out the 'fillet' shape. \n5. Add 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese we just made into the bread crumbs and mix well to incorporate. \n6. Have a **baking sheet** lined with **parchment paper** ready \n7. In 3 bowls add corn flour in the first bowl, almond milk in the second bowl, and the parmesan bread crumbs in the third bowl\n8. Take one tofu fillet and coat it in the corn flour, tap off any excess and then dip into the almond milk, finally coat it in the parmesan bread crumbs mixture. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and repeat for the remainder of the tofu\n9. Bake at 400\u00ba F for 25 minutes, flipping the tofu over about halfway \n10. In the meantime, heat up your marinara sauce and cook your spaghetti noodles according to the package instructions. \n11. When the tofu is done, it's time to assemble. Start by adding your spaghetti noodles with some marinara sauce to a **platter**, then add the parmesan tofu and pour some more marinara sauce over the tofu - sprinkle with some parmesan cheese and enjoy!"]}

Add the onion, garlic and mushrooms to a food processor and blend until no big chunks remain. Saut\u00e9 the blend in a bit of coconut oil for approximately 8 minutes until most of the water is evaporated.\n\n3. Now combine the saut\u00e9 and all the ingredients together. In a bowl mix the saut\u00e9ed mushroom, 2/3 of the flax eggs, crumbled tofu, oats, nutritional yeast, fresh or dried chives, black pepper, salt and if you like spicy, go ahead and add the chili flakes.\n\n4. Now make the Sausage Rolls.\n\nPlace some mix on a square puff pastry and fold it over. Seal it by pressing on the side with a fork.\n\nCut the long rolls into the sizes you want and space them out on a baking tray. \u00a0Brush the pastry with the rest of the flax egg and sprinkle some poppy seeds on top.\n\n5. Bake 20 minutes on 180C/350F in the middle of the oven and then 5 to 10 minutes on the floor of the oven, so it gets nice crispy and brown from below.\n\nDone \u2705\n\n\u2014\n\n[*\\*Like these recipes \ud83d\udc49 Get your FREE cookbook \ud83d\udcda\\**](https://thebgang.com/click-here/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=sausage_rolls)\n\n* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/thebgangcom/)\n* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCkYI-lOv3fOxTIpMYaioDg?sub_confirmation=1)\n* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/thebgangcom)\n* [Tiktok](https://tiktok.com/@thebgangcom)"]}

If the garlic is young  and fresh there may not be much to remove. If it's older garlic and  there's a green stem inside, ensure you remove it.\n* Next,  add the garlic cloves and salt to a high-speed blender or food  processor and pulse until the garlic is relatively smooth.

Stop and  scrape down the sides with a spatula occassionally.\n* After the first \u00bd cup of oil is added, mix in 1 tbsp lemon juice, then add the next \u00bd cup of oil.\n* Continue this process until no ingredients are left and you have a creamy, thick, mayo-like consistency.\n\n### Notes\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Optional ingredients are not reflected in the price or calories of this recipe.\n* Nutritional information is a rough estimate.\n* Recipe calculations are based on ingredients local to us and may vary from recipe-to-recipe.\n* All prices are in USD.", "i love toum", "My Lebanese mother in law freezes the garlic cloves first, so it turns out more mellow and less burn-your-nosehairs-off.

Cut the tofu lengthwise into 4 pieces and then cut in half - you should have 8 squares. \n5. Have your bowl of almond milk, bowl of bread crumbs, and bowl of corn flour ready to go - use a deep bowl to make it easier to dip the tofu. \n6. Add the paprika, garlic powder, and salt into the corn flour and combine\n7. Take a piece of tofu and dip it into the corn flour, then into the almond milk, and then into the bread crumbs - transfer to the baking sheet and repeat for the rest of the tofu. \n8. Bake at 400\u00ba for 20-25 minutes\n9. Remove from oven and in a deep baking dish add the HOT buffalo sauce. Submerge the baked tofu into the hot sauce and flip to make sure the tofu is completely covered with the buffalo sauce. \n10. Transfer back to the baking sheet and brush with some more buffalo sauce. \n11. Bake at 400\u00ba for another 20-25 minutes \n12. To assemble, toast the two ends of gf hamburger buns. Smear some buffalo sauce on the bottom piece, add some lettuce, add the tofu, and smear the homemade ranch on the top piece of the bun and close. \n13.

For the liquid portion, I blended up about 1/4 cup of cooked beet, sauteed garlic/onion, about 1/2 tsp molasses, a squirt of dijon mustard, a teaspoon of tomato paste, and some maple essence and topped that off after blending with some water and bouillon powder to make the 2 1/2 cups \"broth\"\n\nFor the seasonings I add a tsp msg and mushroom powder, a fuckton of fennel (like 3 tbsp or more), a 1/4-1/2 tsp anise seed, 1 tsp smoked paprika, basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, powdered bay leaf (I just add a pinch of each and if you don't have these I'm sure it would taste fine), chili flakes, and a pinch of nutmeg. These are so freaking good and the recipe makes a bunch.\n\nI found that if your TVP is in larger chunkier pieces, it helps to process it down a little, then blending it with the vital wheat gluten before adding your wet mix and that makes it easier to work with in the forming patties stage.\n\n\n**EGG ROUNDS**: \n\nI soak 1 cup of split yellow mung beans overnight, next day I drain, rinse and blend with: \n\n1 cup of coconut milk (you don't taste it in the end but use soy or oat milk if you want to substitute) \n\nabout 3 tbsp nutritional yeast \n\n1 tsp each garlic/onion powder\n\n1 generous tablespoon chickpea flour\n\n1 to 2 tsps potato starch\n\nsalt/pepper\n\na small drizzle of olive oil\n\nNow you can make \"rounds\" by dropping some of this batter (a couple tbsp at a time) in the pan and swirling it around until it's thin. You can add some liquid if it seems a little thick, sometimes I have to do this. They look like little pancakes but they're tasty! You can kind of scramble this mix a bit if you want, but I like to just make a whole bunch of little thin rounds and heat them up in my air fryer as I want them.", "If this is shitty, please also post your not shitty food, it must be off the charts! Nice use of mung beans, I use them to make vietnamese bahn xeo, it's like a bean omelet. Never thought to use as a straight up egg substitute, brilliant!"]}

I have plenty of nice ideas for my starters and main courses, but desserts are stumping me.\n\nThis is largely because I hate using substitutes for animal products. Not only do they taste weird but they're often a bit annoying to work with. This is fine for things that provide stability to a dish (i.e. gelatin substitutes or emulsifiers like lecithin) but when it comes to texture and flavour, I would prefer to use things that are *already* vegan, rather than vegan alternatives that throw off the flavour profile.\n\nSo with all that in mind, could you guys suggest some things you'd like to see as vegan dessert options on a fine dining menu, that don't use animal product substitutes but are just vegan \"as they are\" if you see what I mean?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks again for all the helpful comments so far. I posted this in multiple vegan subreddits and have been met with a lot of unwarranted hostility, so I appreciate the constructive feedback here, you guys have been great!\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks again guys.

These are usually what the options are for vegan people, and screams \"this is the first time I'm having to make vegan food\" (I don't mean that in a mean way it is just very common unfortunately).\n\nAquafaba (water from canned chickpeas) can be used as a natural alternative to egg whites (you can make vegan meringues using this in addition to cream of tartar/lemon juice and sugar). \n\nFlaxseed can be used as a natural alternative to full eggs. \n\nGeneral list of desserts I'd look into; \n\nVegan meringues \n\nMochi \n\nRice/chia pudding (can be made with coconut milk, almond milk, oat milk etc - you could even experiment with making your own plant milk blend; add different fruits or flavourings)\n\nCakes!! (Don't be afraid of them; you can use normal flour, sugar and oil (instead of butter) then swap the eggs for flaxseed or other natural vegan egg alternatives. You could experiment with nut flours too (think like a frangipane esque cake for a vegan bakewell tart or something!). \n\nIce creams; you have so many different milks that you can experiment with! If you're looking for something super creamy it's always best to stick with coconut milk though because of how high the fat content is! \n\nTarts; vegan pastry (use vegetable shortening - think trex - instead of butter) is really easy to make and the fillings that you could make are endless. Vegan chocolate tarts are very easy to make, especially if you want to make a really rich moorish dark chocolate tart. \n\nYou have so many options, good luck and wishing you all the best for success for this vegan meal, I just know you're gonna smash it!", "You\u2019ll probably run into things you might consider \u201csubstitutions\u201d while making desserts. While I understand your perspective, as a vegan I would rather eat a good dessert made with substitutions than a bowl of fruit with some balsamic reduction on top. That said, here\u2019s some desserts that you might find fit your style:\n\n* Panna cotta using coconut milk and agar agar with strawberry compote. Agar agar is used instead of gelatin in some cultures, so it\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d instead of a substitution\n* Olive oil rosemary-lemon cake\n* Pierogi filled with blueberries and sugar\n* Serviceberry crumble served with sunflower seed ice cream\u2014treat the sunflower seed ice cream as worthy in its own right instead of trying to be dairy. A nice vegan restaurant near me does something similar and it\u2019s amazing\n* Whacky cake is vegan\u2014maybe a dessert centered around a piece with some raspberries? I\u2019m sure you can come up with something interesting\n* Dark chocolate truffles", "Not a chef but a scout leader who\u2019s had to cater for huge groups with complex dietary restrictions:\n\nFruit crumbles (e.g apple, blackberries, rhubarb) were always made with olive spread in my house growing up and since the crumble is mostly for texture and isn\u2019t flavoured by the spread it\u2019s a safe option. It\u2019s also just a class pudding all round.\n\nThere are also depression era recipes from the US that don\u2019t contain butter milk or eggs since they were so expensive so that might be a good place to start too since they\u2019re already most of the way to being vegan if not already.", "This is great to hear! \nUsing \u201cflax eggs\u201d for cakes and oils for pastry and including them in puddings makes a huge difference, As a vegan I hate having only cold options for sweet. You can make lots of lovely desserts with dark chocolate especially nice with berries or citrus. Caramel, toffee, fudge and all kinds of jams and compotes can be delicious made vegan. I\u2019ve found the \u201calternatives to cream/butter\u201d taste really good if lacking slightly the richness but that\u2019s a price most are willing to pay. Try not to overcompensate with sugar, lots of vegan treats are overly sweet. Keep doing the good work chef \ud83d\ude01", "Using agar for gelling is traditional in Asian cuisine for Kanten type desserts but also works awesome for a coconut milk panna cotta. I wouldn\u2019t call it a sub cause it works the same, just has a different origin", "Chickpea water is used instead of egg white for meringues in some restaurants, I wouldn't have known the difference as a non-vegan if they hadn't have told me. Banana muffins, flapjacks, carrot cake, dark chocolate fridge cake", "hm, does silken tofu count as a substitute? many cremes or things like mousse au chocolate can be created with it. it has very little taste on its own.", "Sorbet\n\nAny kind of fruit pie (easy to use shortening instead of butter for the crust)\n\nMango sticky rice\n\nMochi\n\nChinese tofu pudding\n\nAlso consider things like cake, brownies, and other baked goods, which may have \"substitutes\" but don't necessarily have an altered flavor profile. I've had many delicious vegan baked goods that taste just as good as baked goods that contain eggs/butter.", "Banana katsu with salted caramel sauce is to die for", "Many traditional Japanese desserts (wagashi) are incredibly beautiful and naturally vegan. \n\nGranitas and sorbets. \n\nPoached fruits", "Any form of polenta cake, fruity crumble. I also make dessert tofu pots. Base of crumble/nuts/seeds and a topping of blended silken tofu + sweetener and either canned fruit, like peaches, mangoes or fresh fruit compote. \n\nSome silken tofu is just plain creamy jelly, others have very weird aftertaste, investigate making your own!", "I\u2019m not even kind of a vegan but reddit just showed me this post: vegan chocolate cakes absolutely bang.", "Oreos", "[https://www.waitrose.com/home/recipes/recipe_directory/c/coconut_rice_pudding_with_caramelised_pineapple.html](https://www.waitrose.com/home/recipes/recipe_directory/c/coconut_rice_pudding_with_caramelised_pineapple.html)\n\nThis is my favourite (with out the pineapple). Perhaps you could use it as a base and play with things to add to it", "Applesauce is a good alternative for eggs and pairs well with a lot of different desserts, heck that's a trick omni's even use to cut cholesterol. You can also try flax seed, I buy the powdered kind you just add water to. I can't taste anything \"off\" about them in cookies, muffins or cakes.\n\nI also make delicious custards with full fat coconut cream, my favorite is pumpkin(so like a pie without the crust), it looks gorgeous in little ramekins.\n\nReally just go for it and experiment, no recipe I've ever converted into a vegan version has ever ended in disaster(except a recipe that was also gluten free, my poor 8 tiered cake was too fragile).\n\nChocolate is not off limits, either. Several brands make chocolate with oat milk now and you honest to god can't taste oat in that chocolate, especially dark chocolate. I recommend you pick up a bar and try for yourself, then buy the chips for baking. My favorite is Endangered Species, my goodness their bars are fantastic and the brand can be found easily.", "I\u2019d love to see panna cotta or creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! Never seen them on a vegan menu.", "I know you said no substitutes, but if I were your client, I would be thrilled by [an opera cake.](https://projectveganbaking.com/vegan-opera-cake/) Of course, it calls for buttercream frosting, which suggests the use of butter substitute.

Other people have suggested wacky/depression came, and this is my go to basic cake recipe. It works well as cupcakes too and can be dressed up however you can imagine\n\nAnd my favorite dessert - pie. Some people think you can't make a good crust without butter, but I beg to differ. Shortening and some liquid oil work fine for me, and vodka in the crust in place of some of the water makes for a very flaky result\n\nEdited to fix my obnoxious swipe-text autocorrect", "You want a list of fruit then?", "\" Feed me vegan\" has the best lemon cake recipe I know of! The book is worth  for that recipe only. Yes it uses soy yoghurt and vegan butter, but it's just the best baked loaf.

Think chocolate fondue cake or a heavy mousse.", "Vegan Mango Lassi, is the only thing that springs to mind. And I just use powdered egg replacer/ aqua fava for everything that includes eggs. I personally remember egg whites being a pain in the ass to properly use without blending first.

You will have more experience than me but probably adding mint, raspberries in some form and maybe roasted pine nuts instead of pistachio might give it that fine-dine edge :) \n\nThe world is your pistachio.", "I\u2019ve made an amazing rice pudding with orange juice instead of milk and flavoured with cardamom. You make it like a risotto rather than baking. Hardly needs any extra sugar.", "You can often use either a silken tofu or soaked cashews to make a beautiful base for a cheesecake. A combination of both also works well, it holds it's structure nicely and is actually pretty nutritionally sound. Obviously flavour with whatever you choose and I also find a Lotus Biscoff base (which is vegan) works well, particularly with a lemon cheesecake", "Similarly I prefer to arrange vegan ingredients into something awesome; substitutes can make things taste weird and learning how to wrangle things like agar takes a lot of test and learn. \nFor this reason I was super impressed with the Nistisima cook book by Georgina Hayden who covers Greek orthodox fasting which is full of plant based fasting days. A lot of it is rustic but you can take the banging flavours and elevate the dish.\n\nI also think it's also impressive when you can turn out a vegan pudding that impresses the non vegans. \n\nIn the book:\nMilopita: apple , brown sugar and cinnamon cake\n\nSticky chocolate-orange pudding\n\nPhanouropita: the lost and found cake of st.

And I am not even vegan.", "Have you considered cooking for your clients instead of yourself?", "Mango, sticky rice is an amazing Asian desert.

Also sago pudding, mochi, halo halo, banana fritters etc. Where milk is sometimes suggested, swapping it out for soy milk or coconut milk often works just as well.", "Poached pears, either in red wine or chocolate sauce. \n\nPersian rice pudding, are interesting because the rice is crushed to a thin power and have a smooth texture and the flavours are endless.", "Mate, give it up.

I also noticed here that it does call for a bit of plant-based milk, but I\u2019d believe it\u2019s more for melding everything together while adding a slight taste. However, if you\u2019re looking for a good vegan cow-milk substitute, I\u2019d recommend using the [NotCo](https://notco.com) brand milks.

I'm going for a thick, cake-like texture so I add enough to cover the oats.\n\n- Microwave for about 3 minutes.\n\n- Once cooked, stir in 55g of the Vedge Protein.\n\n- Add a bit more water if needed before placing back into the microwave for another 90 seconds. Microwaving your oats again will create a thick, cake-like consistency.

If you\u2019d like to warm up the apple pie slices, place back into the microwave for another 30 seconds.  \n\n- Sprinkle some cinnamon and pretzel salt on top. The salt brings out a little extra sweetness.

This can lead to deficiencies and uncertainty about dietary choices.\n\n\u2022 **Pain Points:**\n\n1. Lack of tailored meal plans for specific dietary and fitness goals.\n\n2. Confusion about necessary supplements and nutrient sources.\n\n3.

Peel them and cut into slices about 4 or 5 mm thick. It is important that they are the same so that they cook at the same time and some of them do not remain raw. I recommend that you do it with a mandolin.\n\nWhen the onion begins to become transparent, add the potatoes and keep the heat medium or low so that the potatoes do not become brown but rather remain almost jammy. This way we will get a very tender and juicy tortilla on the inside. Move the potatoes from time to time so they don't stick, but do it carefully so they don't break.\n\nWhen the potatoes and onion are very tender, it is important that the onion does not crunch, place everything together in a colander and eliminate as much oil as you can, this will result in a softer tortilla.\n\nPrepare the chickpea flour mixture in a bowl, with the starch, salt and a pinch of baking powder. Mix with a whisk and add the water. Beat until you get a homogeneous and fine mixture, without lumps. Lastly, add the tablespoon of lemon juice, this will make the flavor of the chickpea flour softer and will help slightly gasify the mixture, so that the dough is more tender.\n\nAdd the well-drained potatoes and mix carefully to keep the potatoes whole, so that later we can see the sheets when cutting the tortilla.\n\nPrepare a frying pan about 25 centimeters in diameter and place 2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil, you can use what was left from draining the potatoes and onion.\n\nWhen it is hot, but not smoking, place the tortilla dough inside and cover with a lid. Keep over medium-low heat for 5 minutes without uncovering. This way the tortilla curdles inside and on top. Using another cold lid or a larger plate, turn the tortilla over and cook for another 5 minutes.\n\nWhen you see that the tortilla is golden on the outside and curdled on the inside, place it on a plate and let it cool so that it sets a little more.\n\nIt is very important that you use a non-stick pan and if it has a thick bottom it will help distribute the heat better without burning. But without a doubt, the best trick to making a good omelette is to use this pan exclusively for that, making good omelettes.", "Maravilla \u2764\ufe0f"]}

Now add the Toban Djan and the Black Bean paste, and saute until 30-60 seconds or until the paste completely mixed into the oil.\n6. Then add 3/4 cup of Water, and bring to a boil.\n7. Then add the Cornstarch slurry and stir until the sauce thickens.\n8. Now gently add the Tofu and stir it with the sauce careful not to break the Tofu.\n9. Once the Tofu is coated, take it off the heat.\n10. Garnish with Scallions or Green Onions and a drizzle of chili oil.\n11. Enjoy!!\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. Toasting the Sichuan Peppercorn over a low heat until fragrant before grinding them brings out the essential oils. \n2. Boiling the Tofu helps the Tofu have a silken texture, and firms it up to prevent crumbling in the wok."]}

I saw someone else said that the reason soy works to produce a skin when heated is due to protein content. The only other bean with 60+ grams of protein per cup that I can find is the lupin bean. I have not tried this, but I wonder if a lupin bean milk might produce a similar skin. Would definitely take some work though! But for something faster, maybe just try some wetted rice paper. Can be used for a skin on fake meats or even marinated and used in some recipes.", "Soy makes my throat close. But I always thought it looks tasty.", "I'm not sure there is such a thing. Soybean skins (Yuba) are made by skimming the congealed proteins from the top of boiling soymilk. Chickpeas have only about 2/3 the protein and 1/3 the fat of soy, and about three times more carbs. Given this, I suspect that the skin would not form as readily on cooking chickpea milk, if it forms at all.\n\nIs this for a specific recipe?", "Could you use the rice paper for spring rolls?", "How much work are you willing to put into this?\n\nMary's Test Kitchen has a series of videos and recipes for making tofu from beans other than soy.  She goes through a process where the fiber and starches from these beans are removed, leaving a milk that is much closer to the protein content of soy milk.   In theory you can follow this recipe to the point before she curdles the milk to make tofu.  Instead you would cook the milk at a temp just below simmering.

{"title": "Repurposing Takeout Leftovers/Remnants?", "selftext": "I'm broke as hell right now and trying to stretch things as much as I can. My partner surprised me with sesame tofu from my favorite place last night, and I hadn't had a decent meal in over a week, so I ate most of it last night and the rest this morning. \n\nWhenever I get takeout like this, I always have some of the sauce leftover. Depending on the place, the dish, and the sauce consistency, sometimes there are just a few tablespoons, and sometimes there's over half a cup. Not a ton, but it always seems wasteful, because the food can be expensive and because the sauce often makes the dish.\n\nThe other week, I went to my therapist's office for my appointment, only to find that it had been canceled. I couldn't get a ride home for over an hour, and I was upset and felt like crying, so I decided to take a walk. On the way, I had noticed there was an Asian market around the corner, so I decided to wander in that general direction. They had tofu cutlets and fried tofu in the refrigerated section, and both were reasonable, so I grabbed those in addition to the inari pockets I had originally come for. Hole-in-the-wall places like this one are where I've found some of the most interesting and inexpensive vegan things, so I fully recommend exploring those places if you have the option. There are definitely expensive things at Asian markets, too, but that's true of any store, and your average hole-in-the-wall market is often better than chain store alternatives. Definitely worth a trip. Much better selection than the \"international\" aisle at your local Walmart or Amazon, and those companies definitely don't need your money.\n\nI used the tofu cutlets a few days ago, and the texture was almost identical to what I get from the restaurants when I get sesame tofu. So, it got me thinking, and I know this is an oversimplification, but: tofu + sesame tofu sauce = sesame tofu. Has anyone tried something like this? Like repurposing sauce leftover from takeout or even something you made yourself?\n\nPart of my issue is that I have food problems that go beyond poverty, although as anyone who's dealt with both can tell you, they can't be fully uncoupled. I have a long history of anorexia and bulimia, and lately, it's been very difficult not to backslide into those things, because of stress and whatnot. My brain wants to be like, \"But you can have a \\*little\\* bulimia, as a treat!\" And I'm like, \"No, you're not fooling me with that again, brain. Nice try.\"\n\nBut that's not the only issue. I can't fully explain it, but it's like, I enjoy cooking in theory. In practice, though, it's like my senses get confused in the process, like I become less hungry if I'm cooking something, or I find that I can't eat at all. Or if my eating disorder shenanigans are flaring up, I often find ways to talk myself out of eating whatever comes to mind as an option. If it's cup noodles or something frozen that I don't have to interact with much as it's cooking, it usually works out better, because I don't have the opportunity to either talk myself out of it or get my sensory confusion thing, or whatever it is that causes that particular issue.\n\nIf it's something I can microwave, something I can just add boiling water to and wait, or something I can eat cold, I'm more likely to be able to deal with it. The point is, there's a whole constellation of issues at work here that I'm trying to navigate, and I'm frustrated beyond belief. I'm not su\\*icidal or anything, but mental illness can definitely get to a point where it's less \"I'm sad and want to hurt myself,\" and more \"I want this to fucking stop, just go away and stop bothering me.\" And the latter can become so excruciatingly exhausting sometimes that you do have moments where you're considering taking self-destructive actions, and it's like, \"Really? Again with this crap?\" And having to fight your own brain all the time is just... I have no words for it.\n\nI didn't know I was going to write all of this when I decided to post here, but I feel like I'm probably not the only one who feels this way, and also, the mental health thing is actually relevant to the problem I'm trying to solve that motivates the original question.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganFood/comments/17pa6he/repurposing_takeout_leftoversremnants/", "created_utc": 1699297298.0, "score": 3, "author": "nbvalkyrie", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/VeganFood/comments/17pa6he/repurposing_takeout_leftoversremnants/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I've worked in a lot of restaurants over the last 30years, and now my home pantry has secret hacks from the catering trade.

Let this simmer until the sugar in the sauce dissolves and the sauce slighty thickens.

I think naan should be quite sticky - like they literally stick it on the inside of the tandoor.", "If your naan bread did not puff up and ended up burning, there could be a few reasons for it. Here are some potential factors to consider:\r  \n\r  \nOven Temperature: The oven temperature might have been too high. When baking naan bread, it's best to preheat the oven to a high temperature, such as 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) or higher, to mimic the intense heat of a tandoor oven. However, if the temperature is too high, the naan can burn before it has a chance to properly cook and puff up. Try lowering the temperature slightly and keep an eye on the naan while it bakes.\r  \n\r  \nDough Thickness: If the naan dough was rolled out too thick, it may have prevented proper expansion and puffing. Aim for a thinner dough, around 1/4 inch (6 mm) in thickness, to allow the steam to create pockets and give the naan its characteristic puff.\r  \n\r  \nResting Time: Naan dough benefits from a sufficient resting time to allow the yeast to activate and the gluten to relax. If the dough didn't have enough time to rest and rise properly, it may not have had enough structure to puff up during baking. Ensure that you give the dough enough time to rest and proof before rolling it out and baking it.\r  \n\r  \nBaking Surface: The type of baking surface you used could also impact the outcome. Traditional tandoor ovens have clay or stone surfaces that retain and radiate heat, resulting in quick and even cooking. If you baked your naan on a regular baking sheet or a metal surface, it may have contributed to uneven cooking and burning. Consider using a pizza stone or a cast-iron griddle to provide a more conducive baking surface.\r  \n\r  \nBaking Time: Overcooking the naan can lead to burning. Keep a close eye on the naan while it bakes and adjust the baking time accordingly. The exact baking time may vary depending on your oven and the thickness of the naan, so it's important to monitor it closely.\r  \n\r  \nBy considering these factors and making adjustments, you should be able to achieve better results with your naan bread. Don't get discouraged, as baking takes practice, and with time, you'll be able to master the technique.", "Vegan.
