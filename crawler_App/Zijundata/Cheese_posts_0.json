I\u2019m using stock images but I am always on the lookout for new cheeses to try whenever I go to the store. Credit to Kraft for the cheese image and Kraft as well as my own observations for the cheese facts. If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Kraft American Cheese is a processed cheese product that is commonly used within the United States on burgers and various sandwiches. The main benefit that it has is great melting properties but it lacks in other areas such as the taste most of the time.  Some also find its \u201cplastic\u201d like consistency to be fake and off-putting. Despite all of this, American Cheese does have its place for when you need very quick, low effort, melted cheese for not much money. \n\nAlso as a note: I post my daily cheese here as well as in my r/dailycheese subreddit.\n\nAnother note: I\u2019m aware that American cheese technically isn\u2019t \u201ccheese\u201d by some definitions but thought it would be a fun one to do for day 666.", "You've been doing this for 2 years just to get ready for this day, haven't you?

If any of you know some cheeses that I haven\u2019t done yet I would love some input!\n\nHere is your daily cheese facts: Saint-Felicien is a soft, cow's milk cheese that originated from the farms in the Rhone-Alpes region of France. In France it is labelled a dauphinoise cheese, meaning it originates from the former French province of Dauphin\u00e9. The cheese is similar to Saint-Marcellin in flavour and texture, although it is almost twice in size and slightly rich and creamier. The French call this cheese Caille doux. Affinage for the cheese takes at least 2-6 weeks during which it develops a bloomy rind and a natural golden-beige colour. The taste, rind and texture are creamy, delicate and soft due to the use of soft curd in the cheesemaking process. In fact, the cheese is sometimes sold in a small ceramic or terra cotta pot since the pate can almost become runny. The optimal flavour of this very creamy, buttery and nutty cheese occurs between April and September. But it also consumed between March and December.\n\nAlso as a note, I gained control of r/dailycheese and now post my cheese there as well as in r/cheese", "You got about another 4 and a half years of this .
