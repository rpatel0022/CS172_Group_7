{"title": "After research I now know \"The Founder (2016)\" was COMPLETELY inaccurate in depicting Ray Kroc's takeover of McDonald's", "selftext": "For the record, I do not work at McDonald's, I am not a McDonald's diehard fan (I actually much prefer Chick Fil A), and I am not a member of the Kroc family. Let's dive in.\n\nI watched \"The Founder (2016)\" and I really enjoyed it. It was a great story that showed one of the largest brands/companies on Earth had to start somewhere and was once a mom and pop shop just like any local business. It was also a great case study for future entrepreneurs. When I reached the ending of the movie my heart sank. I really felt for the McDonald brothers and was sad that their business was stolen from them from a shrewd and conniving businessman. At least, that's what I thought at the time. I since read extensively about the history of McDonald's and that is COMPLETELY FALSE.\n\nMuch of the movie was more or less accurate up until a certain point (with some small details being off, such as McDonald's having already been franchising extensively in California and Kroc mostly wanted to expand it to the Midwest, but that's fine I get the change from a narrative standpoint). The part when the movie went into full-on misleading or even fiction was when it depicted Kroc's purchase of McDonald's.\n\nThe 0.5% share in the profits was not an agreement in the sale, that was how much Kroc pledged to give the McDonald brothers for all his future McDonald restaurants outside of California. When it came to selling McDonald's to Kroc he gave the brothers $1.7M each so they could have $1M each after taxes, a HUGE sum at the time, equal to almost $10M today. The movie made it seem like Kroc was already this rich and powerful CEO and just handed the money over like it was nothing. In reality, Kroc actually did not have $3.4M to give at the time, as he was still focusing on expanding McDonald's and had a lot of debts, so he borrowed extensively to raise the money. He actually stated in an interview once that that $3.4M wound up costing him $10M. After this happened, the McDonald brothers later claimed they had a handshake agreement with Kroc to continue receiving 0.5% of future profits. Besides the fact that this was never in writing so it's pointless to discuss hearsay claims like this without proof, the McDonald brothers were mostly upset because they never knew McDonald's would become THAT big. They knew it would become a big chain but they never knew it would have 10K+ restaurants around the world and just how obscenely wealthy that 0.5% would have made them. So after the sale they became bitter and felt they had been cheated into selling the company.\n\nThe movie gets one thing accurate: The McDonald Brothers were not as ambitious as Kroc about expanding their business. They were relatively old during Kroc's growth of the company and they were already very wealthy (from their original California locations and from the 0.5% profits from Kroc's locations). The movie makes it seem like they were these aw shucks can-do-no-wrong heart of gold country boys, but the truth is they just wanted to sit back and coast and rake in passive income while Kroc did all the work. The movie is also accurate that Kroc legally had to get their approval to make changes to the restaurants (not milkshake powder though which btw was completely made up). The McDonald brothers though were so passive at this point that they almost never got back to him, so Kroc's hands were tied. They just kept holding all the keys to the castle and were pretty much content with coasting and raking in passive income. For more context, at the time of their sale of McDonald's to Kroc they had already been retired for two years, not still hustling around a kitchen like the movie depicts. Kroc basically begged them to sell the company to him (the blank check scene in the movie was real) and their relationship took a nosedive when they responded with exorbitant demands.\n\nNow was Ray Kroc a sad helpless victim? Of course not. He was still a shrewd cunning businessman. Was he a good man who could do no wrong? No. It is true that after the sale of McDonald's he intentionally opened a McDonald's across the street from their original San Bernadino restaurant to put it out of business. It was a very petty sensitive boo boo act, as he was mad that they made him go a further $10M into debt and would not give him the original location. It is also true that Kroc would not credit the original McDonald brothers as the founders of McDonald's, which was also petty at best and dishonest and deceitful at worst. But the depiction in the movie of Ray Kroc as a this cartoonish villain and the McDonald brothers as these two gullible nice country guys is absolutely false and everyone who watches the movie should keep in mind that it is a drama and not a documentary.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/zef1ut/after_research_i_now_know_the_founder_2016_was/", "created_utc": 1670353642.0, "score": 800, "author": "nanika1111", "num_comments": 135, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/zef1ut/after_research_i_now_know_the_founder_2016_was/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I\u2019m surprised no one commented.

He was making them a lot of money, doing all the work, whilst they did nothing, no flexibility, had him trapped in an unethical contract, wouldn\u2019t help him either.\n\nThey also moaned about QC, never once did they, ya know, go out and help with QC. If they really had no intention of being even the least bit flexible, they should never have franchised, that is what franchising is essentially.\n\nAlso I didnt get the point of the film about how he always \u2018steals\u2019 other people\u2019s ideas (and women), everyone gets their idea from someone else, and improves upon it. That is how humans progress haha.\n\nThen I researched after and actually he was a much better person in real life.\n\nI also found it ironic that the film diminished June Morinto (or whatever her name was) to just a receptionist, she was majorly involved in McDonalds success from the beginning.\n\nClassic, soulless Hollywood that, Hollywood is a true evil of capitalism", "I just rewatched this movie tonight, I had seen it when it came out. Love it, love it. It went to read up on accuracy about a couple of things, and came across your post. it\u2019s funny both time I\u2019d watched this film, I somehow intuitively knew the McDonald\u2019s brothers were not perfect. I mean yes, it appeared that Ray Kroc was a bit zealous, but they knowingly gave him a very restrictive contract, we see how big it is and Ray just signing away with no attorney of his own, and in their faces each page they\u2019re relieved. Pretty quickly I saw that these two had Ray over a barrel much of the time and it\u2019s like, what did they expect? He was busting his tail feather and they\u2019re collecting checks and they don\u2019t want to throw him a bone? I\u2019m no Ray Kroc fan girl either, but it\u2019s nice to read my suspicions were correct.\u00a0", "So I just watched movie last night and was also curious. I\u2019m sad the brothers got weaseled out of it. \n\nIt\u2019s clear McDonalds wouldn\u2019t be McDonald\u2019s without Ray. He did bust his butt but it really bothered me that he immediately began referring to himself as the founder. Like as a business owner myself who\u2019s had people try to steal their ideas, it triggers me!\n\nI\u2019m really glad he got smart about buying land. That was genius. \n\nI would have liked to see the transition to drive up windows in the movie. That would have been really cool. \n\nI\u2019m glad ray had the decency to divorce his wife before acting out with Joan. Apparently they fell in love while both married but didn\u2019t act on it. Ray divorced ethel, but  joan chose to stay with her current husband (not the restaurant owner in real life), but she was convinced by her mother and her daughter to stay with her current husband for 8 more years. During that time ray ended up marring a different woman for 8 years until Joan got the guts to divorce her current husband. Which I thought was interesting. \n\nAnyways, the guy was a sleaze but he was a hard worker with some good ideas. It just bugs me he tried to take ownership for their idea. Again, clearly McDonald\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be what it is today without him, but it literally would never have existed without the McDonald\u2019s brothers and their innovation with the speedy system.", "Believe what you will but I think Ray along with his attorneys deliberately forgot to either include or have the contract made up stipulating the 0.5% share. Don\u2019t forget back then a handshake actually was supposed to mean something. Nowadays people are smart enough to know it doesn\u2019t mean crap. Him and his lawyers took advantage of the brothers. I think the brothers are to blame as far as being gullible and naive as well as Ray as he not only conned them thanks to his background as a salesman but was smart enough to buy the land right from underneath the brothers own fast food establishment to have complete control over them. Ray was a broke ass salesman who had to take out a mortgage on his house to buy into the franchise and damn near lost his house. He obviously was desperate and found a way to not only fix his financial woes but to take complete control over McDonald\u2019s. As far as the movie goes most of it was eyewitness accounts, family of the brothers and online research. I doubt the CEO of McDonalds contributed anything to tge making of the movie. So the question remains who do you believe? The Brothers side or Rays and the current CEO of the \u00a0franchises side with the 0.5% share. Nobody in their right mind would give up a successful \u00a0business that they love for next to nothing knowing full well of it\u2019s success. Ray was a dishonest man just like he was in his previous marriage cheating on his wife. Dishonest and untrustworthy is the type of character he clearly was. His wife could have bailed on him at anytime with his current financial situation at the time but chose to stay with him clearly through the hardships. He boots her to the curb after screwing the brothers over with his side piece and six months later marry\u2019s her, that speaks volumes about the type of person he was.", "A really solid post!  \nOne point I'd make though is that I interpreted the role of the brothers (in the film) a little differently. I didn't really see them as \"gullible nice country guys\" - I felt it conveyed that they were architects of their own destruction.\n\nAs Kroc says in the film \"is that not a check in your pocket for $1 million\" as he tells one of the brothers that they're not a \"push-over\".\n\nIt felt clear to me that Kroc is a petty and ruthless man in the film (something that I feel about him in real life) and that the brothers kind of overplayed their hand. Instead of sitting down and having an adult discussion with Kroc about how they could better implement his idea - or to find alternatives - they just said no at every stage.\n\nSo of course an ambitious man is going to find a way out of the contract.", "The movie was inaccurate from the start.

He  flew there, at a time when air travel was extremely expensive:", "None of this really changes the film. I've just finished watching it for the first time and it's clear that Croc didn't have that money and that it was extremely painful for him to give it up.

And just sit and watch Ray make them hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars, 729,000% since IPO.  Those characters were by no means \"screwed\" with just $1.3M each.

{"title": "What Was Beef Stroganoff Originally Served Over? (Commenting on locked post from r/AskCulinary", "selftext": "So the question was asked, and I started putting together an answer, only to find the comments locked when I tried to post. I assume that's because it's outside the scope of the sub, but haven't seen a mod confirm that yet. \n\nAt any rate, feel free to comment your findings and opinions, but darn it, I'm posting my original comment, because I think it's fun! Here it is: \n\nWhat was beef stroganoff originally served over? \n\n*very Gollum voice*\n\nPotato straws or nothing!!\n\n(Really, that's my understanding of the original or an early version of the dish. That it wasn't served *over* anything, because it was made for a man with no teeth, so was simply very tender beef in a creamy sauce, the end. But it was certainly served with potato straws in some early iterations, and this is still common in Russia)\n\nBut the iconic NYC Russian Tea Room served it over rice when they began serving the dish in the thirties. That is more provable than any of the origin stories, and probably was more influencial in the US than anything until Betty F-ing Crocker said, \"hit it, housewives.\" [Completely made up quote for dramatic effect, but we can assume it was one of the workhorse cookbooks ladies depended on from that era which popularized serving stroganoff over egg noodles]\n\n*Wide egg noodles.* An iconic food of the mid century dinner party. If you weren't moulding you an egg noodle ring while swilling a pre-dinner cocktail, you weren't living. I can't give you a date when the first recipe for a noodle ring made from pre-packaged wide egg noodles would've been published, but I've seen recipes for those as early as the forties. There's a Pennsylvania Dutch recipe for a homemade noodle version earlier than that, but I think that's about the earliest we saw mass produced egg noodles in the American kitchen. Correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nSo, in my 1950 first edition Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook, there are zero recipes for stroganoff. \n\nIn the 1965 edition of the Congressional Club Cookbook, there are no less than six. One makes no suggestion it should be served over anything at all. A few recommend fluffy rice. Two suggest wild rice. I was amused to read that one called for canned water chestnuts and asked that it be served over white rice with crispy Chinese noodles on top; horrified to find a \"Hawaiian\" version made of hamburger, a can of Chinese Chop Suey, and a can of pineapple chunks, which should all be cooked together (with no further seasoning) and served over Chinese Hard Noodles. Thanks, but no thanks, Mrs. La Vern R. Delwig.\n\nTo me, it seems likely that the two trends didn't manage to collide in the fifties - maybe not even till the later half of the sixties.\n\nMy dad, a late baby boomer born in '61, remembers my grandma using wide egg noodles in her Minnesota kitchen while cursing the Bolsheviks. It would likely have been from the '69 Betty Crocker. I take that as gospel, naturally.\n\nAll things considered, I think it went: nothing, potato straws, rice, egg noodles. But I can't prove that and I don't think anyone can. So I've just listed some touchstones for your edification.\n\nPlease enjoy this dish over whatever starch you like, but please, for the love of all that is good and holy, let's leave the canned pineapple in the cupboard for this one.

{"title": "Tim Walz's fast food campaign stop and the Volga Germans", "selftext": "Tim Walz stopped at a Nebraska fast food chain called Runza, and it's important enough to the campaign that they created a standalone video about it: [https://www.tiktok.com/@timwalz/video/7404541009268460843](https://www.tiktok.com/@timwalz/video/7404541009268460843)\n\nThe newsletter I run published an article last year that explains where this Runza sandwich comes from. (I edited the article but did not write it.) Posted here entirely, so as not to self-promote!  \n\n\"Whether you tuck into one at a Cornhusker football game or from one of 88 locations in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Colorado, the Runza sandwich, a savory stuffed bun from the fast-food chain of the same name, is pure Nebraska. To learn how it achieved its cult status, though, look to the 1700s. And Russia.\n\nIn\u00a0[1762 and 1763](https://www.volgagermans.org/history/manifesto), Catherine the Great invited foreign colonists to populate the expanding Russian empire. The offer especially tempted Germans,\u00a0[30,000](https://www.volgagermans.org/history/migration-russia)\u00a0of whom left their war-torn homes with the promise of military service exemption, the right to maintain their language and religion, and a 30-year tax exemption. Known as German Russians or Volga Germans, they farmed the expansive steppe along the Volga River. German Russians kept their food traditions, too, while incorporating techniques from their new climate.\u00a0\n\nOne of those foods became the foundation for Runza. Taking a cue from the Russian pirog, a savory, stuffed pie, German Russians created the pocket-sized bierock, known also as krautenruns, cabbage pies, kraut bierock, and Runzas. Russian savory pies abound, with the pirog \u2014 derived from the word pir, meaning feast \u2014 leading the pack. (Don\u2019t confuse pirogi \u2014 plural for pirog \u2014 with pierogi, the Polish dumplings, or pirozhki, the plural of pirozhok, the diminutive, handheld version of a pirog.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201cRunzas were made for the men to take out into the fields to eat, so they wouldn\u2019t have to come back into town for the meals,\u201d says Pam Wurst, a member of the\u00a0[American Historical Society of Germans from Russia](https://ahsgr.org/), based in Lincoln, Neb. \u201cThe Russian versions were filled with potatoes and onions, mostly,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe Germans added cabbage and meat to them. Most of the time they left the potatoes out.\u201d\u00a0\n\n100 years later, as Russian nationalism grew, new legislation reversed Catherine\u2019s promises. Many of the Volga Germans immigrated to\u00a0[the United States](https://www.norkarussia.info/deportation-1941.html), which was seeking to colonize land gained during its own bloody expansion. Several settled in Nebraska, including the family of Sarah \u201cSally\u201d (Brening) Everett, born in Sutton in 1912. She grew up making savory pies filled with beef, cabbage, onions, and spices, so in 1949, when it was hard to find jobs after World War II, Everett coined the final spelling and pronunciation of the sandwiches and trademarked the Runza name, opening her first restaurant \u2014 a car hop stand \u2014 with her brother and brother-in-law.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur best guess is there was a German word which was close, and she changed it enough to be able to be trademarked,\u201d says Becky Perrett, Runza\u2019s director of marketing. (Perhaps it was\u00a0[runsa](https://omaha.com/lifestyles/runza-the-story-of-one-of-nebraskas-most-treasured-foods/article_6e0b5a51-b017-5a23-b5cd-92f2c06a5d88.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRunza%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20version%20of,shape%20of%20a%20round%20belly), a low German word meaning \u201cbun shape.\u201d)\u00a0\n\n\u201cTo be a female entrepreneur in 1949,\u201d says Perrett, \u201cShe was ahead of her time.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe company is still run by the Everett family, with Sally\u2019s grandson, Donald Everett, Jr., serving as president. Menus include other typical fast-food fare \u2014 offerings for those who don\u2019t love the stuffed sandwiches \u2014 along with several Runza\u00a0[variations](https://www.runza.com/menu/section/runza-sandwiches)\u00a0and the good ol\u2019 original.

{"title": "Philadelphia Cream Cheese DID come from Philly!!!", "selftext": "Is Philadelphia cream cheese from really Philadelphia? If you do a basic Google search, plenty of reputable articles from Today to Newsweek even the Philadelphia Inquirer (sadly) will say no. Wikipedia says no. Even a viral Reddit thread says no.\n\nBut that\u2019s completely and utterly wrong. \n\nLet me start by giving credit where credit is due (considering that\u2019s my bone to pick in this entire situation) \u2014 American cream cheese was \u201cinvented\u201d in New York State by William Lawrence in 1875. He found success in the market as one of the first producers of cream cheese, and expanded his operation throughout the 1890s. He even tacked on the moniker \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d to his product to associate it with the established, flourishing dairy market in the Philadelphia and surrounding Pennsylvania areas. \n\nThe William Lawrence Company eventually became known as the Phenix Cheese Company, and was bought out by the Kraft Corporation in 1928. Tha t seems the be where the story stops right? Totally wrong. This is really a multi-pronged story in the saga of cream cheese.\n\nRemember how I said Philadelphia had a flourishing dairy market? Well, Philly was well known in the 1870s and onward for their butter, cream, and other dairy products. So much so, surrounding cities in the Mid-Atlantic area would seek out Philadelphia-made dairy products for their grocery stores. Places like Washington DC, Baltimore, and Atlantic City were all clambering to stock Philly dairy products.\n\nThe most popular butter in the 1880s (according to articles and advertisements in the Atlantic City Gazette-Review, the Daily Republican, Evening Star, the Philadelphia Times, Newport Daily News, the Evening Journal, Press of Atlantic City, etc.) was \u201cSharpless Gilt-Edge Butter\u201d or \u201cSharpless Philadelphia Butter\u201d(Philadelphia was added to the name in 1890). It came from a creamery on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and its reputation greatly preceded itself. According to the Philadelphia Times in 1888, Sharpless gilt-edge butter was \u201cthe most delicious addition to the feast of good things\u201d and consumers would \u201cnever put tongue to anything so toothsome.\u201d The butter was so popular, it was reportedly used at the White House, according to the Lancaster Examiner in 1902, where they write: \u201cThe Sharpless butter is In great demand in Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, and Washington. Butter used at the White House is made by Sharpless.\u201d \n\nThe Sharpless Creamery grew under the ownership of Pennock Edwards Sharpless, a native Pennsylvanian and son of a prominent local dairy farmer, William Sharpless. He moved his creamery to Ward Village, Concord Township, PA in 1893, where he produced many dairy products from butter, condensed milk, pimento cheese, and most importantly \u2014 cream cheese! The creamery burned down in June 1900 due to an arson attack, but was immediately rebuilt. In 1904, Sharpless Creamery was fully incorporated as a domestic business corporation (#326461) and mass producing dairy products for sale all around the mid-Atlantic region. In 1910, the New York Produce Review and American Creamery notes that \u201cJohn B. Fassler, head cheesemaker of the P.E. Sharpless Company plant at Ward, Delaware County reports daily receipts of 16,000 lbs. milk. Of this over half is made up into Neufchatel and Philadelphia cream cheese, the remaining goes into condensed milk.\u201d Sharpless used the moniker \u201cPhiladelphia cream cheese\u201d on his tinfoil packaged cream cheese cakes, and examples of advertisements can been seen in every major newspaper at the time in this region (Atlantic City Gazette-Review, Daily Republican, Evening Star, The Philadelphia Times, Newport Daily News, The Evening Journal, Press of Atlantic City, Delaware County Daily Times, Lancaster New Era, Denton Journal, Asbury Park Press, The Washington Post, Harrisburg Telegraph, The Virginian-Pilot, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Reading Times, etc.). The Sharpless Creamery also turned to the fluid milk business in 1922, when they consolidated with the Breyer Ice Cream Company to create the Breyer-Sharpless Milk Association. The Ice Cream Review of 1922 notes that \u201cThe Breyer Company confined itself to the manufacture of ice cream previous to the consolidation, while the Sharpless firm have long been known as manufacturers of fancy print butter and package cheese, as well as condensed and evaporated milk.\u201d So basically, the Sharpless Creamery had the Philadelphia dairy market cornered!\n\nThe reality of the cream cheese boom at the turn of the 20th century was that there were only 5 major creameries making and selling cream cheese: Phenix Company and F.X. Baumert Company in New York, Kraft Company and Blue Label Cream Cheese Company in Chicago, and the P.E. Sharpless Creamery in the Philadelphia area, according to the 1954 court case Kraft Foods Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It goes on to state that \u201cno other concerns, with the possible exception of one or two small ones, made and sold cream cheese commercially in the United States at that time.\u201d Out of the 5 companies, the P.E. Sharpless Creamery was the only geographically authentic Philadelphia cream cheese company!\n\nWilliam A. Lawrence & Son (aka Phenix) sued the Sharpless Creamery in 1913 over misleading advertising on their cream cheese packaging and won, which can be read in Lawrence et al. v. P.E. Sharpless Co. Sharpless was using a cow with blue lettering and tinfoil packaging on their products, the same as Lawrence/Phenix. This didn\u2019t slow Sharpless\u2019 role though.\n\nThe Sharpless Company went on to obtain three U.S. patents on their process of making soft cheese (patent # 1,258,438) and packaging (patent # 1,399,270 and 1,466,380) beginning in 1918, 1921, and 1923. Two patents in 1937 covering the manufacture of cream cheese (patent #2,098,764 and 2,098,765) were given to Pennock Edwards Sharpless\u2019 son, Caspar Sharpless, who became the general manager of the still-operating Sharpless plant in Ward after the sale to Kraft Company. \n\nIn 1924, Kraft Company purchased the P.E. Sharpless Creamery and all assets, including their patents. Kraft continued using the Sharpless name on their dairy products (likely for name recognition), until 1941 when Kraft trademarked the \u201cPhiladelphia Brand\u201d moniker (trademark registration #0392212). Kraft also purchased the Phenix Cheese Company in 1928, combining the two once-warring \u201cPhiladelphia cream cheese\u201d brands. Of course, Kraft Company is the business that makes and sells Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese today. So to say that Philadelphia brand cream cheese does NOT come from or have roots in the Philadelphia region is outright wrong. The P.E. Sharpless Company, now absorbed by the Kraft Company along with Phenix, was the only commercial creamery corporation in the Philadelphia area making tried and true, authentic Philadelphia cream cheese at the turn of the century. Any other business that used the moniker \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d cream cheese were doing so in association only. The Sharpless Creamery was the true Philadelphia cream cheese brand. \n\nThank you for attending my cream cheese lecture.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/12ug2ta/philadelphia_cream_cheese_did_come_from_philly/", "created_utc": 1682106700.0, "score": 8, "author": "UnusualAd7417", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/12ug2ta/philadelphia_cream_cheese_did_come_from_philly/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Having attended your cream cheese lecture, I am only now confused at its purpose. \n\nSo William Lawrence invented cream cheese in New York in 1875, calling it \"Philadelphia Cream Cheese\", but then 18yrs later in Philadelphia, Pennock Edwards Sharpless started manufacturing cream cheese in 1893?\n\nHow does this demonstrate your title thesis \"Philadelphia Cream Cheese DID come from Philly!!!\"?"]}

The histories of different maroon groups in South America suggests some truth to these stories and account for why rice remained an important food for Maroons in the Guianas. Over millennia of trial and error, the rice growers of West Africa had developed intercropping systems that maximized yields and minimized the risk of potential pests by planting several crops. An important element of those intercropping systems was a legume that has a center of origin that overlaps with African rice; vigna unguiculata, more commonly known as the cowpea. The most common cultivar of the cowpea is the black eyed pea, a historically important ingredient in the cuisine of the American south.\r  \n\r  \n[Hoppin\u2019 John](https://tastetrinbago.com/hoppin-john-for-new-years-with-max-miller-michael-twitty/) is a dish made with [black eyed peas and rice](https://tastetrinbago.com/new-years-eve-black-eyed-peas-and-rice/), flavored with onions and pork and typically eaten on the first day of January since it is said to bring prosperity in the New Year. Jessica B. Harris says that \u201cthe pea with the small black dot is considered especially lucky by many cultures in West Africa\u201d and that this view has persisted in the new world. John Egerton, the author of Southern Food says that these legumes have a \u201cmystical and mythical power to bring good luck\u201d and are commonly associated with money.\r  \n\r  \nThis dish is also popular on the Caribbean coast of Colombia where it is known as Arroz de Fr\u00edjol Cabecita Negra. It is uncertain how it became popular there, but it was likely introduced by slaves passing through Cartagena, which was once one of the largest slave ports in the new world. In Trinidad and Tobago, [black eyes peas and rice is a New Year\u2019s Day tradition](https://tastetrinbago.com/new-years-eve-black-eyed-peas-and-rice/) even though many people eating this dish on this day are unaware of the reason behind it. This tradition likely persisted locally in folk memory, but it was also reinforced by the presence of slaves known as \u201cMerikins\u201d who bought their freedom by fighting for the British against the Americans during the war of 1812.\r  \n\r  \nAt the end of this war, these slaves were paid with plots of land in south Trinidad where they could live as free men. In recent years, a variety of red rice thought to be extinct was found growing in the land that was given to these slaves indicating that they brought their crops and cuilinary culture with them. David S. Shields, the chairman of the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation described the rice growing in the hills of south Trinidad as \u201cthe most historically significant African diaspora grain in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d Shields and his foundation is partially responsible for bringing African rice back on the market as Carolina Gold Rice. They are also involved in promoting Sea Island Red Peas, a lesser known landrace of vigna unguiculata similar to the varietals used in the earliest recipes for black eyed peas and rice in America. In the south, these recipes were all passed on orally until Sarah Rutledge, the daughter of a prominent Charleston family included a recipe in her 1847 cookbook, The Carolina Housewife. While that is the first written recipe, it is impossible to ever know who actually invented Hoppin\u2019 John. The dish is virtually identical to some versions of Thieboudienne and Jollof Rice and likely developed over a long period of time in West Africa before crossing the ocean and being creolized as [Hoppin\u2019 John](https://tastetrinbago.com/hoppin-john-for-new-years-with-max-miller-michael-twitty/) and Carolina Red Rice."]}

The problem is that in most of the world's densaely populated areas, it was not very practical. Ice cellars and ice houses functioned by insulation, they weren't artificially refrigerated, so effectively the temperature inside only dropped much below freezing if it was there on the outside. And of course putting anything other than ice and insulation in there was going to raise that temperature. I know that people experimented with using cold to preserve things (anecdotally, Francis Bacon died from pneumonia contracted while trying to freeze a chicken), but it was not practical. On a lesser scale, it was widely used - cooked meats and fish sealed under fat, sauces or jellies and stored in cellars or airy cupboards abound in recipe sources. \n\nMeanwhile where cold preservation actually was practical, it was used widely. Inuit, for example, dug permafrost pits and deposited meat and fish in them. Siberian settlers stacked  fish from their winter catch frozen for salting later, or for more immediate use.

Cajanus cajan, better known as the pigeon pea, was also introduced along with lentils and chickpeas. The latter two influenced the cuisine of the region but they did not thrive as crops. Pigeon peas, on the other hand, became popular, and is arguably the most important introduced legume in the Caribbean.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s uncertain exactly how pigeon peas came to the Caribbean since the pea was well known in South East Asia and North East Africa. It might have come with slave ships or with the Portuguese and Spanish who used it as provisions on many of their vessels. In parts of the Caribbean, the name used for the pigeon pea bears some phonetic similarity to the original Bantu name. Examples of this include Gandule in Spanish, Guando in Portuguese, and Gungo in Jamaican English. The use of these names suggest that it was introduced by Bantu-speaking Africans living south of the Congo region, so it was likely slaves from that area that brought pigeon peas to the Caribbean. The popularity of this plant in the West Indies was due to its practicality; the plant was useful in multicropping systems, and the pea casing could be used as animal feed. In the eighteenth century, pigeon peas grew in popularity among subsistence farmers in the Caribbean and might have supplanted a local cultivar of the cowpea in culinary importance. Naturally, the pigeon pea can be found in several rice and legume dishes across the region.\r  \n\r  \nPelau is a one pot pigeon peas and rice dish from Trinidad and Tobago related to other one pot rice dishes like Paella from Spain, and Pulao from South India. What makes Pelau different from similar dishes is that sugar is first caramelized in the pot before other ingredients are added. These other ingredients might include items like pumpkin or poultry, both of which would have been present in the backyards of the enslaved.\r  \n\r  \nRice and Gungo Peas from Jamaica on the other hand could be considered to be rice and pigeon peas cooked in coconut milk that is seasoned with items like allspice berries, scallion, and thyme.\r  \n\r  \nArroz con Gandules from Puerto Rico is another variation of this dish that uses a base of olive oil and tomatoes sauteed into a spice blend called sofrito. Sofrito was possibly developed as a marinade that could be used to preserve meat, and often includes wild coriander, sweet pepper, and annatto.\r  \n\r  \nBahamian Peas n\u2019 Rice uses a similar sofrito as seasoning, but the finished dish is typically drier than the pigeon peas and rice made on the Hispanic islands while being more aromatic than versions from the rest of the English speaking Caribbean.\r  \nIt is important to recognize here that even within a single island, there is often strong debate about the proper way to make pigeon peas and rice, and across the entire Caribbean it becomes impossible to get any consensus."]}

I was able to find one recipe called [\"Duke of Windsor's Gingerbread\"](http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/dukeofwindsorsgingerbread.htm) from the 1953 cookbook '*Court Favorites*.' This might be the specific dessert in question, or one of several favored by Edward VIII. If you want to explore this direction, it sounds like Court Favorites is a good place to start. You could also try getting your hands on the 1942 book '*Some Favorite Southern Recipes of the Duchess of Windsor*.' Incidentally, there is a sandwich called The Duke of Windsor, containing cheddar, grilled pineapple, turkey, and chutney. But I certainly hope that was never a dessert option!\n\nAnd third, it could possibly be just a personal recipe this woman (or one of her friends) made up. Maybe it's just something elegant and fancy, so she named it after the former king. Unless she wrote it down in her own recipes you're reading through, the only other possible place it would be is in the personal recipe collections of her friends.

{"title": "How come people were willing to kill each other in the past over delicious foods? Even as far as mere condiments like food spices? Was food that terrible back than?", "selftext": "I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken, and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living. The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......\n\nA bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.\n\nIn addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which \"Ninja Chefs\" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. \n\nThe project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.\n\nThese two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.\n\nThe first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. \n\nAnd what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.\n\nHell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!\n\nIn addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:\n\n\"Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death\".\n\nHe explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.\n\nHell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.\n\nI am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?\n\nCan anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!\n\nWhat is the logic behind this? Why did historical peoples act this way?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/cbk3d1/how_come_people_were_willing_to_kill_each_other/", "created_utc": 1562781754.0, "score": 4, "author": "SaturnineSasuke", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/cbk3d1/how_come_people_were_willing_to_kill_each_other/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Old post but another thing you may interested in is salt.

It briefly explored the cultivation of the common bean by Native Americans, and it looked at popular versions of [red beans and rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/CaribbeanFood/comments/13n9dfb/red_beans_and_rice_across_the_caribbean/) within the region; This included dishes like Jamaican Peas and Rice, as well as Louisiana Red Beans and Rice.\n\nFinally, it looked at the popularity of red beans among the African diaspora of the West Indies and the American South compared to other varieties of the common bean. This seems to be due to a preference for red colored rice dishes from West Africa like Jollof Rice and Thieboudienne. Just as members of the African diaspora have a preference for red beans, it seems that the preference for black beans across most of Latin America is also due to a preference for food that resembles their ancestral dishes.\r  \n\r  \nMesoamericans used beans of many different colors, but their recipes often called for cacao paste, or blackened dried chili peppers, known in Mexico as chile ancho. This resulted in dishes that had a dark, or even black color. This is possibly a reason why Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean with a strong Mestizo culture prefer black beans over red beans in their food.\r  \nOne method of serving black beans and rice is to make Frijoles Negros by cooking the beans with cumin, tomato paste and other seasonings and then serving it alongside white rice or yellow rice. Very often this would be part of a larger meal with [fried plantains](https://tastetrinbago.com/tostones-twice-fried-plantains/), shredded pork or beef. Pabell\u00f3n Criollo from Venezuela, or Casado from Costa Rica are examples of this. Casado is a Spanish term for a married man, and the dish may have got this name from diners asking for the meal that a married man might expect to get from his wife at home.\n\nAnother common way to cook black beans and rice is in one pot. In Central America, this is known as Gallo Pinto. This dish is popular in both Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama and the name refers to the dish having the appearance of a speckled hen due to the look of the black beans mixed with white rice. The dish is similar across those countries, but Costa Ricans often use a condiment known as Lizano sauce when cooking theirs and in Nicaragua, red beans are sometimes used.\n\nIn Cuba, this dish has also acquired a nickname; Moros y Cristianos. This name is supposedly a reference to the color of the black beans and white rice being similar to black Moors and White Christians respectively. This explanation is likely more complicated than that since Moro de Guandules is a term used for pigeon peas and rice in the Dominican Republic. Moro as a descriptive term for these dishes might initially have been a reference to Africa and Moorish cuisine. References to Africa feature across the names of several rice and legume dishes in the Caribbean, especially in versions of [pigeon peas and rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/CaribbeanFood/comments/13j2my8/rice_and_pigeon_peas_across_the_caribbean/) since the legume used in such dishes originated in West Africa.\n\n[https://tastetrinbago.com/rice-and-legumes-across-the-caribbean/](https://tastetrinbago.com/rice-and-legumes-across-the-caribbean/)"]}

Italy's attempts to codify traditional dishes (ragu alla bolognese is another example) are noble in intention but also, to my mind, slightly disingenuous in their attempts to freeze them in time. You can be sure that at the same time as the original margherita was being made in Naples, someone else was making pizza differently within a few streets. You see the same thing with Italian architecture - they're obsessed with setting things in stone (pun intended, sorry): the benefits of this are that when you visit Italy, you get to see - and eat - their version of 'authentic Italy' which preserves culture but potentially stifles creativity. Massimo Bottura was days from shutting up his restaurant in Modena for good when he had a favourable review at the last minute - what a loss that would have been.  He dared to be different and reinvent classic dishes and no-one was interested.

Any possibility that this is an authentic recipe?\n\nMy husband gifted me with a 1952 issue of Gourmet magazine. I love it for so many reasons.

The recipe is for \"Turkey and Chayotes\" and it involves many steps as well as the ingredient butter.  I've no doubt it is an invention, but I thought you'd appreciate it.\n\nThe contributor claimed this was found in an ancient site in Tabasco:\n\nPlace 3 pared and quartered chayotes, or mango-squash, in a basin and pour 1 pint water mixed with 1 cup pear vinegar and some salt over them. Let them stand for 2 hours. Cut one wild hen turkey (choose a 6- to 8-pound hen if you are not lucky enough to get a wild turkey) into 8 parts, and saut\u00e9 the pieces with 1 onion, sliced, in 2 tablespoons butter for about 10 minutes. Now pour 1 cup soup stock into the pan and add 1 clove of garlic, minced, and 3 bay leaves, broken into tiny pieces. Stew all this gently until the turkey is tender and then add the drained chayotes. Cook the chayotes with the turkey until they are tender and slip off the fork. Serve with any green vegetable. You might like to simmer some bell peppers together with some baby Limas to keep this an all-American dinner.\n\nMR. CHET L.

{"title": "The story of the Mediterranean Diet - chapter one: The prehistoric man tastes the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and develops agriculture", "selftext": "\r\nLet's go back 13,000 years in time. \"Just\" before the Ice Age ended. Will you be shocked to learn that you are familiar with the local flora and fauna? For instance, you might be shocked to find bears and leopards in Andalusia or lions and crocodiles in the southern Levant, but these are familiar creatures. The environment, which included several trees, shrubs, and forage herbs, also bore a striking resemblance to the Mediterranean landscape that surrounds us now.\n\r\nIf we were to arrive at a settlement or cave of hunter-gatherers, we would discover that the food, even if it looks a bit different, is not far from what we know today: olives, figs, almonds, grapes, acorns, lentils, wheat and barley seeds \u2013 all were part of the diet of ancient humans. Sometimes, meat consumption was high \u2013 about 50% of the total food, and occasionally low \u2013 about 20% or even less.  \n\nFor instance, even though there was an abundance of game in their surroundings 16,000 years ago, the hunter-gatherer community that lived in northern Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria was nearly exclusively vegetarian. Or, for example, populations of Natufian culture in the southern Levant, some of which relied on a plant-rich diet, and others on a much more meat-based diet, with only a few dozen kilometers separating them.\n\r\nIn this ancient world, which botanically and zoologically resembled our world today, the seeds of the greatest change humanity would undergo on Earth are beginning to sprout. A change that occurred independently at least six times in human history: in the Fertile Crescent, in China, in the Indus Valley, in Central America, in South America, and the Sahel south of the Sahara \u2013 the development of agriculture.\n\r\nThe southern Levant, where generations of Natufian culture have been turning grain (wheat and barley) into flour, will be the first place to undergo change. The Natufians in the Levant, like their contemporaries in North Africa, stored cereal grains and replanted some of them to ensure food supply in the future. Despite the climatic changes during the transition from the Ice Age to the Neolithic period, there is no evidence of mass extinction or abandonment of habitats \u2013 neither of the Natufian culture, nor their distant relatives in North Africa, nor of the animals or the vegetation. Life continues. \n\r\nTherefore, it is still a mystery why in North Africa they did not advance to the domestication of plants and animals, while in the southern Levant, they did. What led the Natufians to invest in agriculture? Maybe one day we'll know. And maybe never. But one thing is clear:\r\nThe great drama, of the transition from hunting and gathering to the domestication of plants that will serve us, begins!\n\r\nWheat and barley were the first to be domesticated. By means of deliberate improvement and selective breeding, our prehistoric ancestors selected grain with large ears, easily cut stalks, and seeds that did not disperse when ripe. This is just the beginning of an extraordinary agricultural development \u2013 in the post-Ice Age Southern Levant, flax, peas, lentils, fava beans, chickpeas, and bitter vetch were also domesticated \u2013 completing the staple crops of the transition to agriculture.\n\r\nGrapes (probably with parallel domestication at the same time in the Caucasus) and olives were domesticated about 4000 years later, in the 6th millennium BCE. After them, figs and dates will also be domesticated in the southern Levant (with parallel domestication of dates in southern Mesopotamia (present-day southern Iraq) and the eastern Arabian Peninsula). \n\r\n\"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground...\" (Genesis 3:19). \n\r\nAccording to the Torah, the divine punishment for eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is the toil of the ground. When God expels Adam and Eve from Eden, He grants them the knowledge to till the land, but they (and we follow them) will work hard to grow bread from it.\n\r\nThis hard work will bring about a new era. The dedication to agricultural work will lead to the development of cities, the emergence of the royal class, the creation of bureaucracy, taxation, and control over trade, which in turn will lead to the invention of writing...And from here, everything is history.\n\r\nThe grain, along with other staple crops, will spread like wildfire throughout the Mediterranean. Immigrant populations from the Levant will bring the knowledge and technique of plant cultivation south to Egypt, east to the Fertile Crescent, north to Asia Minor, and from there west to Crete, the Peloponnese, and Macedonia, Italy, and the western shores of the Iberian Peninsula. From there, the grain will spread south to North Africa. \n\r\nIn total, 3000 years since the end of the Ice Age, wheat and barley have been growing all around the Mediterranean. From now until today, they will form the basis of the diet around the Mediterranean.\n\r\nLike grain, other crops also spread quickly through the same trade and migration routes along the southern coasts of Europe. The sea levels after the Ice Age were dozens of meters lower, allowing for island hopping. in this way, For example, wheat, barley, fava beans, and even livestock arrived in Crete 9,000 years ago. \n\r\nBut this flourishing comes to an end with the rise in sea levels at the end of the Neolithic period, about 7000 years before our time. The agriculture of the Mediterranean is almost lost, and the population around the Mediterranean will return to relying on hunting and gathering. \n\r\nBut the knowledge was not lost. Agriculture survived the catastrophe and returned to the starting line, ready for the race that would make it the leader of humanity.\n\r\nIn the next chapter: from a great crisis to a golden age \u2013 the collapse of ancient civilizations and the emergence of new ones, that will transform the Mediterranean into a huge agricultural unit.\r\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/1gnaqo3/the_story_of_the_mediterranean_diet_chapter_one/", "created_utc": 1731160912.0, "score": 2, "author": "oliveoilworldexpert", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/1gnaqo3/the_story_of_the_mediterranean_diet_chapter_one/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

American accent that speaks clearly and concisely with a nice flow.\n* *Townsends* - Suffers from the \"let's edit out pauses,\" but is less egregious than Max Miller.\n* *Historical Italian Cooking* - These guys are spot-on with their historical content, but - dang! - is their accent almost indiscernible. Thankfully, they provide links to their blogs to expand upon their content and recipes.  \n* *Max Miller* - He is well-loved, I get that.  And at least his content is accurate, but I still struggle with speed at which all the information is presented. It is a pet-peeve of mine with YouTubes/Tik-Toks in general that all the pauses are edited it out, so it is a constant influx of information without the opportunity to <ahem> digest what one just year. *English Heritage* doesn't have this problem.\n* *Foodie Eyes* - Provides some decent content on the anthropology of food and eating, however each vid starts with an advertisement of their channel, the French accent can occasionally be difficult to discern, and the music is always a bit too loud.\n* *Weird History Food* - Terrible. Isn't really about culinary history in the classic sense of researching a technique or ingredient as much as delving into popular culture (*Why Does Chipotle Keep Making Us Sick?)* Even vids on specific foods -- i.e., pasta -- I really despise quick editing and the fact they are content farming from other creators.\n\n  \nAll that said, there are a handful of one-off productions worth seeking out:\n\n* Clarissa Dickson Wright's *Cooking Medieval Food from England's Oldest Cookbook*. \n* *The Supersizers,* which have restaurant critic Giles Coren and comedian Sue Perkins recreating various British histories.", "I love the podcast Gastropod. They do food history and food science. They have BOTH English and British accent lol If they said they would make a tv documentary for a streaming service I would sign up right away. They do a lot of history and try not to be too biased."]}

{"title": "Why have bars become well-rounded relaxation places in contrast to other drinking and eating places like cafes and fine dining restaurants?", "selftext": "Not only are billiard tables and darts become industry requirements for running a bar, but plenty and plenty of bars have a karaoke system and coin operated jukebox in place as well as a small stage for a guest singer or band. Its also pretty common for many bars to have a few arcade cabinets, a dedicated table or two for playing recreational poker, perhaps a pinball machine and one of those punching score thingy. The larger bars may have a small section if not separate room for dancing and at least in bigger towns and within the city hookah pipes are also pretty common. Some of the more night time bars even feature clothed women doing lewd dances for money! On top of air hockey and foosball also becoming more common in North American bars (with foosball being as standard a feature as billiards and darts in Europe and Latin America). The more high class bars even have a separate lounge with couches and a couple of book shelves and magazine stacks. Perhaps a tennis table. Don't get me started on multiple TVs featuring sporting events and how many of them also offer regular food including actual cooked meals. Some might even have a DJ playing around with vinyls and CDs. Hell gambling machines have started being placed in bars too more and more frequently.\n\nSo I gotta ask. Why have bars become pretty well-rounded chilling places with a wide multiple different entertainment options? Why didn't other eating and drinking establishments like 5 star restaurants grow to become as well-rounded as fun places? In particular I ask about cafes since many of them frequently feature guest bands and singers just like bars do but almost never have karaoke systems unlike bars!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/1af3ylk/why_have_bars_become_wellrounded_relaxation/", "created_utc": 1706660220.0, "score": 2, "author": "YMCALegpress", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/1af3ylk/why_have_bars_become_wellrounded_relaxation/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

{"title": "I don't remember where I read this", "selftext": "In my culinary school education I dove deep into random awesome history facts that seem lost/forgotten/ never practiced.  But I remember reading about someone traveling through the southern coastal boarders of Asia and the South East Asian islands talking about the lush vegetation and the indigenous peoples love for nature's bounty.  One of which is citrus particularly lime.  Explorer writes how fantastic it is and describes how the natives eat it like a sauce on other foods, how for babies is used as a pacifier, and how they cut it.  Now what strikes me is that he describes the lime being cut on a bias that means if you find the lateral line (north south)  you tilt the lime 45 degrees left or right (not rolling it) and cut, that's how the natives cut them.  Now fast forward current day, I discovered that when you do so, you cut straight through the compartment membranes of the lime exposing the pulp.  You get twice as much juice when you squeeze it cause now there's no membrane holding the juices in.  I see chefs with Michelin stars, tv, and local dope restaurants that send out citrus with membrane (cutting vertical/lateral) and it's disheartening sometimes.  Kinda like being cursed with ocd about saying \"BEHIND\" or \"CORNER\" and thinking anyone who doesn't say it regardless of being in a kitchen is an asshole or an idiot.

{"title": "Punch", "selftext": "\"PUNCH is a beverage made of various spirituous liquors or wine, hot water, the acid juice of fruits, and sugar. It is considered to be very intoxicating; but this is probably because the spirit, being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the sugar, its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it really is. Punch, which was almost universally drunk among the middle classes about fifty or sixty years ago, has almost disappeared from our domestic tables, being superseded by wine. There are many different varieties of punch. It is sometimes kept cold in bottles, and makes a most agreeable summer drink. In Scotland, instead of the Madeira or sherry generally used in its manufacture, whiskey is substituted, and then its insidious properties are more than usually felt. Where fresh lemons cannot be had for punch or similar beverages, crystallized citric acid and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the same thing. In the composition of \"Regent's punch,\" champagne, brandy, and veritable Martinique are required; \"Norfolk punch\" requires Seville oranges; \"Milk punch\" may be extemporized by adding a little hot milk to lemonade, and then straining it through a jelly-bag. Then there are \"Wine punch,\" \"Tea punch,\" and \"French punch,\" made with lemons, spirits, and wine, in fantastic proportions. But of all the compounds of these materials, perhaps, for a summer drink, the North-American \"mint julep\" is the most inviting. Captain Marryat gives the following recipe for its preparation:\u2014\"Put into a tumbler about a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint; upon them put a spoonful of white sugar, and equal proportions of peach and common brandy, so as to fill up one third, or, perhaps, a little less; then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the tumbler. Epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh pineapple; and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted outside with stalactites of ice. As the ice melts, you drink.\" The Virginians, say Captain Marryat, claim the merit of having invented this superb compound; but, from a passage in the \"Comus\" of Milton, he claims it for his own country.\"\nThe Book of Household Management\nMrs. Isabella Beeton, published 1861", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/7qkm8r/punch/", "created_utc": 1516032513.0, "score": 2, "author": "Olivesplace", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/7qkm8r/punch/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

These are two variations of the common bean that were already present in the Caribbean region for thousands of years.\n\nThe final major legume and rice dish of major culinary importance is [dhal and rice](https://tastetrinbago.com/how-to-make-dhal/), a dish that uses a type of legume introduced from India.\n\nIn India, dhal is a term used for several flat legumes, some of which are lentils while others are peas that have been split into two pieces. These peas were split to facilitate faster cooking times, and better absorption of water. Food writer [Colleen Taylor Sen](https://books.google.tt/books/about/Feasts_and_Fasts.html?id=lICMBQAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) says that dhal \u201cmay be the closest India has to a national dish\u201d due to how prevalent it has always been in the cuisine of the sub-continent. Dhal came to the Caribbean as a food supply for the [Indian Indentured laborers](https://quadtt.com/indian-indentureship-in-the-caribbean/) who replaced the slaves in several parts of the West Indies. Ship logs indicate that rations for the Indians on their journey to the Caribbean included dhal, rice, onions, garlic, ghee, and turmeric; ingredients still used to make dhal and rice in Trinidad, Jamaica, and Guyana today. Several types of dhal were historically used in the Caribbean, including split urad bean, and split mung bean, but it has largely since settled on yellow dhal made from split pigeon peas. This dhal is used in a type of roti called a dhalpuri, as well as dishes like pholourie, and dhal and rice.\n\n[The dhal for dhal and rice is boiled, blended with a swizzle stick, and then cooked with cumin, turmeric, and garlic](https://tastetrinbago.com/how-to-make-dhal/). It is possible to find dhal and rice in restaurants in the English speaking Caribbean, but it is rarely cooked in homes except in places with a significant East Indian population. It has not become as widely accepted as other Indian dishes like dhalpuri roti or curry goat and likely never will, since it has to compete with so many other Caribbean rice and legume dishes that are more well established. Another way of cooking dhal and rice in the Caribbean is a dish called [kitchree or kitcharee](https://tastetrinbago.com/kitchree-recipe-dhal-cooked-up-rice/), which is a type of dhal and rice cooked up with turmeric, onions, garlic, and cumin. The popularity of this dish in India was described by the Macedonian general Seleucus I Nicator over two thousand years ago. The Caribbean version is typically made with less dhal than in India, and often consumed with [curried seafood](https://tastetrinbago.com/trini-curry-shrimp-recipe-by-chef-jeremy-lovell/) and coconut chutney.\n\nIn Trinidad, there are two dhal and rice dishes that are uncommon enough that many Trinidadians have never sampled either. One is a countryside tradition of cooking dhal with callaloo ingredients in the same pot. The resulting dish is a hearty and nutritious soup known as [dhalaloo](https://youtu.be/lZUoP2MCVoI). The other is a North Indian dish called rice and [karhi](https://youtu.be/9Zp77kz6UKM). Karhi is a creamy gravy made with split peas flour. Fritters made with split peas flour are added to this gravy, and then the mixture is poured over white rice. The former is rare because it is generally made by outdoorsmen during the hunting season, and the latter is rare because it is only made at ceremonies like Hindu Weddings and not available at roti shops."]}

{"title": "Is it true that food in an unopened container in a landfill (such as hotdogs sealed in the same package from its supermarket life) can survive over 20 years without decomposition? If so, why don't we have any historical foods surviving from centuries ago in air sealed containers?", "selftext": "Yesteday I helped my aunt prepare and store food to be used in my dad's promotion to Colonel in the National Guard Airforce (which took place today). As we were clearing the van before we stored food, my auntie found a bunch package of Chinese meatbuns (the white kind that with soft smooth texture that often comes with a paper sticker under them). My aunt was like \"I bought those 4 months ago and couldn't find it!\". We sadly had to throw it since its obviously now bad. But there was something peculiar about it. Despite being under the hot sun in a vehicle for the whole summer, it did not melt into a liquid pile of goo. Not only that, there was no sign of mould or discoloration and ohter associated things with food spoilage. From what I could smell of it from outside the sealed bag , it did not smell bad at all but had the smell so associated with that kind of white bread the Chinese use for their native cake and bread products. I could not smell the meat inside but the fact I couldn't detect anything typically like rotting meat amazed me so much.\n\nThis reminds me of a project I did in middle school where we had to research stuff related to trash and waste management. Is tumbled upon an article from a major news paper (can't remember the name but its a big brand name in the same league as say New York Times and People Magazine). It said something about unopened hot dog still in their plastic sealed containers being found in landfills from 20 years ago looking like in new considtion without discoloration nor did it have a strong scent that should have been apparent because of being refigerated so long even if its in a unopened package. The article emphasized that along with being in factory condition package, since it was in a garbage bag and hidden so long deep in over 50 feet high of a pile of trrash, it could not get oxygen and thus failed to decompose because no microbes were interating with the food.\n\nThe article was written around 1987 meaning that the aforementioned hotdogs and other trash it was commenting on would have been produced in the 1960s decade, To this day I still could not believe the article's claims despite being written by some big name professor or scientist (might have been both) who's in the field of evironmentalist and was doing some project for a university at the time the article was published..........\n\nBut seeing the Chinese meat buns not change at all despite being unrefigrated and outdoors during the hot summers (in even hotter temperature because it was stuck inside a car trunk the whole time) reminded me about that article.......\n\nNow the first major question since I cannot believe it. Is this all possible that sealed food thrown into the center of a bunch of garbage would not be able to composee due to lack of oxygen and in turn lack of germs and other invisible tiny living things especially if its been thrown inside a tied plastic bag ortrash bag or something similar? I still am having difficulty beleiving this is actually real. Now the second question, how long until the food getst ot the point of disappearing? 6 centuries? A thousand years? 3 milennias? A whole eon of a million years or more? Now last and most of all, if food can survive so long without decomposition for decades, how come we don't have easily perishable food from the mid 1800s or even from World War 1 in a surviving state? Sealing food in a cloth, paper, ardboard, wooden box, and even modern day plastic wrapper seal has been in eistence since the late 19th century. Furthermore landfills were already a thing after the Industrial Revolution with places like N the Northern states having problems with running out of space in some ities and towns because of the heaps of trash piling up already shortly after the American Civil War. Landfills just became more and more as technology advanced before World War 1 at the even of the 1900s. The existing amount of open lands being used to pile more and more trash has boosted up even further after WWII. So I'm wondering why don't we have surviving ground beef hidden in a trash pile in Germany thats been wrapped in a cylander plastic dated container dated from 1922 hidden in some landfill in operation for 90s years? Why aren't there some ancient sausage linked wrapped in paper cloth in early trashbags in a landfill thats been in operation since 1879? Since piels of trash limit oxygen and can cause hotdogs to survive so long for decades, not to mention the Chinese meatbuns in my Auntie's trunks surviving one whole hot summer without decaying into a different state, why don't we have surviving food especially whose in plastic air sealed wraps from the 19th and early 20th centuries in very old landfills?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/16ejzms/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "created_utc": 1694301246.0, "score": 0, "author": "CamelIllustrations", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/16ejzms/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

There is however, an interesting phenomenon, a dark beer associated with Ireland that is popular all across the English-speaking West Indies; Guinness.\r  \n\r  \nThe [history of Guinness in the Caribbean](https://tastetrinbago.com/the-history-of-guinness-in-the-caribbean/) is an examination in local drinking culture within the region, and also the story of how a small Dublin brewery grew into a global beverage giant.\n\nIn 1799, Arthur Guinness had four decades of brewing experience when he decided to end the production of ale and focus exclusively on a style of dark beer called porter.\r  \n\r  \nWithin Dublin, he sold Town Porter, while the slightly stronger and more hoppy Country Porter was available at pubs across all of Ireland along with Superior Porter which was stronger, and included some cask aged stock. He also brewed Keeping Porter, a flat beer that was slightly stale, and used for blending into other products to preserve them and ensure consistency.\r  \n\r  \nIn 1801, an entry in a brewery journal for West Indies Porter marked an addition to these four, and the earliest reference to Guinness brewing a beer specifically for the Caribbean market. Guinness West Indies Porter was brewed to be stronger, and fortified with extra hops and a small amount of sour beer. This beer was designed to survive the long journey across the Atlantic and the heat and humidity of the Caribbean.\r  \n\r  \nOver time, a stronger version of Superior Porter, first called Extra Superior Porter and eventually Guinness Extra Stout emerged. In a similar manner, West Indies Porter would be renamed Guinness Foreign Extra Stout. The recipe also changed with time. Instead of brown malt, a new type of dark malt called patent malt was increasingly used to provide the characteristic colour and flavour, so that pale malt could form the bulk of the beer. This resulted in a divergence in style between the drier Irish stouts and the sweet English stouts that still used brown malt.\r  \n\r  \nWhile the market for stout in the Caribbean kept growing, Guinness did not have a monopoly in the region since many drinkers did not understand the concept of a beer brand at that point. Only in 1862 did the company adopt the now iconic harp logo. Even so, export bottlers still used their own name and iconography on bottles and drinkers often asked for Guinness by the name of the image on the bottle. Very often, this was the image of an animal like a wolf, a pelican, or a flamingo. Bottles of Guinness in the West Indies would sometimes be sold under different names depending on the British company who bottled it and the importer who brought it in. In Malaysia, drinkers still request Guinness by asking for a \u201cblack dog\u201d due to the popularity of two bottlers who used a bulldog image on their labels.\r  \n\r  \nIn the early 1950s, the recipe for Guinness Foreign Extra Stout was modified. The principle of blending highly hopped young beer with long aged sour beer stayed the same, what changed was the proportions and properties of the beer blended to create Foreign Extra Stout. This decade also saw the release of the Guinness Book of World Records, one of the top-selling non-fiction books of all time that is arguably the most popular product from the company.\r  \n\r  \nThe next decade also saw significant strides for the company. They perfected the technology of pouring the perfect pint of Guinness, thus introducing nitrogen infused Guinness Draught to pubs across the United Kingdom and North America. They also built an enormous brewing complex in West Africa. By this time, more than half of the Guinness that was exported went to Africa, and Nigeria was now the third largest market behind Ireland and England. Like the rest of the British Commonwealth, Nigeria was seeking Independence and local politicians were promising to focus on indigenous manufacturing in order to reduce imports. Building a brewery in the country that was projected to one day drink the most Guinness made sense. It also came with challenges. The company had no experience making beer in a tropical climate, and the high temperature and humidity would have effects on both the fermentation and maturation of the beer. Suitable housing and social clubs for staff also had to be built and a program put in place to train Nigerian brewers.\r  \n\r  \nPerhaps the biggest issue was that as a new nation, Nigeria would likely face political challenges. Violent regime change could potentially lead to a government that was unfriendly to Western companies. Some of this would come to pass and the early years of Guinness being brewed in Africa were against the backdrop of political instability. Nigeria became independent in 1960. The brewery was built just north of Lagos two years later, and within another five years, there was a coup, a counter-coup, and a Civil War on the horizon. In some ways, the Biafra Conflict paralleled The Troubles that had recently started in Ireland. Both were longstanding disagreements turned violent between ethnic groups who may have seemed no different to outside observers. Ultimately, these political issues would have practically no effect on establishing the brewery and locally brewed Guinness would be on shelves in Africa within a year of completion.\r  \n\r  \nGuinness would also build a brewery in Jamaica to satisfy the demand of the Caribbean market, but its completion in the early 1970s would coincide with civil unrest and an economic downturn. At this time, local brewing company Desnoes and Geddes had recently acquired the rights to bottle Heineken locally and were expanding their distribution of Red Stripe Beer. Guinness was popular in Jamaica but in the face of stiff competition in an increasingly difficult market the operation was not profitable enough to justify the factory. They would eventually sell the brewing facility to Desnoes and Geddes who would bottle and distribute Guinness Foreign Extra under contract. A similar arrangement would be made in 1981 with the Carib Brewery in Trinidad and Tobago.\r  \n\r  \nNone of these breweries ever brewed the finished stout, they would make the young, heavily hopped component and blend it with a small amount of liquid shipped from Ireland. Referred to internally as Guinness Flavor Extract, this concentrated essence from Ireland contains the sour tang of aged beer, the bitterness of hops, and the trademark notes of heavily roasted barley. Combining these two beers represents an evolution of the original idea for West Indian Porter that offers certain advantages.
