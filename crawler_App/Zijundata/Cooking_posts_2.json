Served with rice.", "Coconut chicken curry served with rice and naan.", "Ziti or pot roast", ">I want something easy, tasty but to be presentable and look like I tried.\n\nThe key to \"easy\" is a good recipe. Number of ingredients and number of steps are not relevant. In a good recipe, each step is easy. Who cares if there are two steps, or twenty, or two hundred if each step is easy? \n\nPresentable is an aesthetic. You can make red beans and rice with Andouille sausage and dump the rice into the beans and have slop. You can use a small bowl as a rice form and make castles of rice in the middle of a plate surrounded by a moat of red beans and sausage dusted with cilantro or parsley and it will be lovely. Aesthetics matter. Same food - different result. \n\nWith any sort of knife skill and some minor knowledge you can carve a roast turkey in the kitchen, reassemble it to look like a turkey, and put it on the table so people can take (or be served) what they want without your table looking like a murder scene. \n\nI make five lasagnas to feed the freezer in about 45 minutes. You'll find social media full of people complaining about taking two or three hours to make one. This is about organization and *mise en place*, not ease. \n\nChicken pot pie is pretty easy. Again, you want some knife skills. If you use Pillsbury pie crust in a tube it's definitely easy. \n\nSpaghetti with home made sauce shows you tried. Nothing from a jar. \n\nCaesar salad with homemade dressing and homemade dressing is lovely and definitely shows you tried. \n\nChicken adobo sounds fancy but is super simple. Steam frozen peas and carrots. Salad. \n\nIf you have a barbecue grill, burgers, frozen fries into the oven, Grandma Linahan's macaroni salad, green salad is great. No smashburgers. Good cheese. No brioche. I have a rant on burgers I'll spare you. \n\nFor me, to answer your question, I'd do chicken pot pie made day before and held in the fridge. Caesar dressing and croutons made day before. Day of, pot pie in the oven, cut (30 seconds for one heart for four people) or tear (2 minutes for one heart for four people) the romaine, dress, wait for the pot pie to bubble through the vents. That's easy. \n\nPeople have suggested various sorts of \"bars.\" Not my choice. YMMV. Lots of prep work, mostly time sensitive (can't do so much ahead) and the clean up is significant. You can talk me into baked potatoes for burgers with bowls of yogurt, sour cream, chives, a couple of shredded cheeses (NEVER buy pre shredded cheeses), crumbled bacon (baked in oven and broken up, not a jar). Still a lot of clean up. Taco bars are a nightmare to clean up with either a ton of leftovers or a lot of waste. Much easier to have someone in (volunteer from your friend group?) to do assembly to order with less mess and less clean up and faster service.

I cooked the pizza in my oven at 500 degrees for like 12 mins. \n\nI\u2019ve done this to four pizzas already and this morning I threw up because of the presumed undercooked pizza dough. A lot of recipes on the internet also set their oven temp at 500 so I didn\u2019t think lowering the temp would be an issue. Should I maybe try putting it on a lower rack? \n\nAlso I used regular flour the first time and bread flour the second time.

If you have a gas oven you put the pizza stone on the floor of your oven, if electric on the lowest shelf. Preheat At 500 for 1 hour. You bake directly on the stone. You will need corn meal for your pizza peel. You want your dough to be thinner in the center and a little thicker on the edge. \n Now when making your dough mix it until it\u2019s a shaggy dough ( before kneading) then cover the bowl and let rest for 20 minutes. This allows the flour to hydrate. Then you knead it. This step is called autolyse and is an important step in a bread type dough.", "Ok so a few things - first pizza sauce is easy.  It\u2019s speed scratch, not store bought.  Get a glass jar of passata ($3-5) a tube of the fresh basil puree, and a tube of garlic puree.  After that you just mix half the jar of passata with a small squeeze of garlic and basil, and a pinch of salt and a few more shakes of black pepper than you think you need.  Depending what type of pizza I\u2019m making I might add a tablespoon or two of oil.  It\u2019s a jar, two tubes, salt pepper and maybe oil (yes for New York pizza, no for Neapolitan) This half jar will make 2-3 larger pizzas.  A 16 ounce dough is only going to need 4-6 ounces of sauce or so depending on your goals.\n\nNow for the dough, your recipe is fine.  You are not stretching it anywhere near thin enough, and probably fussing with it so much It won\u2019t thin out proper.  This is the importantly part, the heat of the oven needs to balance the speed of cooking the dough through with the speed of browning the outside.  A thicker pizza needs to cook at a lower temp for much longer.  500f is for cooking very well made thin pizzas. If it isn\u2019t thin enough, it\u2019ll go burnt before it gets cooked through.  400f is safer, it\u2019ll get dark brown and caramelize things but shouldn\u2019t burn and you can test how done it is.  350f will get medium brown and basically won\u2019t burn on you, but might dry out if you leave it in too long.

One thing to remember is that it hits your mouth and nose.  Most ingredients I see are about the mouth, but once I have it all in the pot I drop in sprigs of fresh basil to cook along with the tomatoes, olive oil, msg (optional), garlic, salt, and pepper.

So two tips on that, pizza stone, brick, or steel. Pre-heat for longer than you think you need. When I worked pizza our ovens were right around 800.  \n\nI will guess though that part of your problem is too much toppings.  It's nothing you said, just something I see many people do.  They throw a ton of raw mushrooms, 1/2 lb sausage,  onions and peppers, and 1/2 lb of cheap mozzarella  on a pie.  Speaking as a now engineer, the mass of the toppings should never exceed the mass of the dough. \n\nAs to the sauce, the answer is usually less is more.  Don't spread sauce, paint it on.

If you have a bottom heating element then you can control how close the pan is to that element. If your oven only has a top element then the heat has to get through all your toppings to get to cooking the dough.\n\nI have seen videos where the dough is parbaked either in the oven or the stovetop.

You basically wanna tuck all the bits into one spot repeatedly until you have a snowball like dough ball with one inward divet where you tucked it in. That's the dough key, and if you reduce them to a single one and then point it down, the dough will roll circular a lot more easily. And you wanna minimize rolling to preserve that yeast air. You'll hear it popping out like chewing gum if you roll to hard. You wanna push the dough, not flatten it.

I grew up KNOWING that the green part of my place was going to be fibrous, slimy, and devoid of really any nice flavor, and dreaded having to eat them.\n\nSince falling in love with cooking, holy shit, basic seasoning and the right cooking method can transform any veggie into something delicious.

Broccoli,asparagus and cauliflower had a hollandaise on it. Stuffed peppers and stuffed mushrooms had melted mozzarella on top. Eggplant parm was, well, eggplant parm. Corn was always on the cob, boiled and then browned on the grill for a little extra kiss. Jersey corn is naturally sweet and delicious. Carrots, my mom baked them until they started to brown and naturally carmelized. The main thing I do differently now is no sauces, cheeses or tricks to get kids to eat it. Broccoli is saut\u00e9ed/baked with garlic and onions. Cauliflower is baked with olive oil, salt and pepper. So I\u2019ve learned to enjoy vegetables in a more natural state instead of needing a \u201ckid friendly\u201d topping. The ONLY vegetable I absolutely despised was spinach because that is the only thing my mom boiled. Frozen chopped spinach. Barf. We had to eat it because of its benefits. Now I love spinach. Probably have a spinach salad 3x a week. I also love putting it in a pan with a little fresh garlic and olive oil. Saut\u00e9 It just enough that it wilts but not mushy. Really nice alongside a grilled chicken breast. My other favorite which we never had is Brussel sprouts. I\u2019m usually asked to bring them or make them at holiday dinners.

Don\u2019t put stuff in your hamburger. Put stuff in your meatloaf. There are volume to surface area ratio issues and structural integrity to pay attention to.\n\nRecently I made a half-size loaf. I rather like the size so in future when I make a full size recipe I'll divide the mix and make two small loaves. This will work particularly well on a quarter sheet pan with a rack for boat ovens.\n\nWhich leads to a comment. The problem with many meat loaves cooked in a loaf pan is that the bottom burns a bit, you have a bunch of soggy mess just above that, and end up with just half a loaf worth eating. I've had good experience just cooking on a rack. The loaf stays as a loaf just fine.\n\nFor this one I mixed all the wet (stock, Worcestershire sauce, eggs, ketchup) ingredients in a measuring cup and then stirred in the breadcrumbs. Meat, onions, garlic, and the wet all in a big bowl and mixed it by hand. If you are skeevy (<- technical cooking term) about putting your hands in raw meat wear disposable nitrile gloves or get someone else on the boat to do it. Too little mixing and the loaf won't stay together. Too much and it ends up gluey without the desired texture. Good news is it is pretty forgiving.\n\nYou definitely want a very fine dice to the onions and a very fine mince to the garlic.\n\nBake at 350\u00b0F for 60 to 90 minutes to an internal temperature of about 160\u00b0F. This small loaf took 80 minutes to reach 160\u00b0F internal. Try not to open the oven too much. You'll lose all the heat and burn a lot more propane.\n\nThe meatloaf was hot, somewhere between medium-rare and medium, moist, and really delicious.\n\n# Meatball option\n\nMeatballs are just small spherical meatloafs. I form meatballs with an ice cream scoop. Roast meatballs at 400\u00b0F for about 20 minutes and then simmer in your sauce for about five minutes. Pack them pretty densely so they don\u2019t fall apart. Smaller meatballs will cook faster.\n\n*Credit: Alton Brown (I think) and me*", "Years ago my then girlfriend had a recipe I wish I'd gotten ahold of, for a southwest style meatloaf.

This is mostly to bulk up the meal and add some more veg to it.\n\nWhen it's simmered in the broth for a few minutes and the noodles are ready, I'll kill the heat and add my tare, which is a good bit of soy sauce (there is no salt in this dish before this, so the soy sauce contains most of the salt for the whole recipe), then a smaller amount of fish sauce, and finally some sesame oil as a finishing oil.\n\nI'll put this into a bowl, and cut up some spring/green onions and chilli peppers over it and serve.\n\nI like this style of cooking which is mostly hands off, and VERY budget friendly, also the stock+chicken lasts me about a weeks worth of dinner with some lunches if I don't go in for lectures on that day. I don't mind eating the same thing for some days at a time although there is a limit and freezing half the stock and chicken for another time would also be a good idea if it isn't your thing.\n\nI was wondering whether people had go-to recipes for one which are similar in budget and simplicity, however maybe from a different part of the world, or just a different dish in general? As much as I do enjoy this meal and do adjust it from time to time (this recipe has been lazily cut down for about a year and a half, from swapping to cheaper noodles and removing eggs or chilli oil etc) I really want to have other meals that I can just work on for a bit, leave, come back and do some more.

Charcoal will give you better flavor, but takes time to heat up and needs to be kept going for longer cooks, and while they can be used for smoking it\u2019s a little fussy. Pellet grills split the difference - more flavor for both grilling and smoking, and while they take longer than gas to heat up, they are quicker and easier than charcoal. The downside is the price for both the machine and the fuel.\n\nPersonally I have a gas grill (with rotisserie that I use quite a bit!) and a smoker.", "> that can be used as a wok burner as well as a dedicated wok burner?\n\nOk, that bit has me puzzled.  But given you are talking about a wok burner, I'm guessing that you are thinking a gas grill.  There are so many options these days: gas, charcoal, gravity fed, pellet, not to mention offset, barrel or kettle.  So I'm going to put on my consultant hat.  Do you have access to the fuel, whether it be charcoal, gas, wood, or pellets?   What do you plan to use it for most often?  This will determine really what fuel is most appropriate. \n\nYou can't beat gas for convenience.  Sorry. Click, you got heat. You can't beat an offset stick burner for wood flavor and versatility (with most you can use both the smoking chamber and the firebox as grill area).  Gravity fed make long cooks on charcoal pretty easy.  Pellet grills are very convenient but imo are a bad compromise between a smoker and a grill. Not a great smoker (but ok) not a great grill (but can be ok). \n\nAll of that said, I will assume you mean a gas grill.  Look at Napoleon.  Even their entry level grills provide high heat, ease of use, and a 15 year warrantee.  I consider it better than Weber.  I bought one, and my neighbor helped me assemble it and then bought one the next week.  I have a cheaper one with no infrared searing gizmo, but it really doesn't need it. \n\nBut I'm kind of a freak on outdoor cooking.  I have a gas grill, a stick burner offset, and a pellet smoker.

It's the only appliance I have that can really get the BTUs for a real wok.  Kind of like I said with the pellet grill, you can get a grill that does both, but it wont do either well.   You can get one for under $50, and if you are spending the big money on a grill I would consider that an add-on cost. And you can do woks, fish boil, turkey fry, fish fry, and I use mine for paella.", "A REAL wok burner is a very specific type of burner.  While plenty of grills will have a side burner none will come close the the afterburner hell fire of a real wok burner.

{"title": "Another nitrite debate : what about flavour ?", "selftext": "Hi. I'm super new to charcuterie, in fact never made a single one yet. But I love fermentation and after reading Koji Alchemy chapter on charcuterie I wanted to deep dive on the subject.\n\nI was surprised to see how in the book they were very precautionous about having to use nitrite in charcuterie, as something you \\*must\\* do. And as an european millenial, I was taught that nitrite was evil.\n\nSo I started to dig, and started to read countless of debates, especially here in this subreddit. And I saw many, many contradictory informations. And honestly both sides were having good points. I do know that nitrites are only a problem when heated high temp and producing nitrosamines (and only if eaten very oftenly), I do know that contradictory to a lot of beliefs, people from ancient times actually used the nitrites inside saltpetres, that a lot used to cure their meat. I know that \"nitrite-free\" products are a marketing joke, and I know nitrites help preventing botulism. But frankly, I also know that it's actually \\*\\*extremely\\*\\* unlikely anyway and that a \\*ton\\* of people are doing it without them on a daily basis since generations and generations.\n\nThis morning, I bought a dried sausage. It was gorgeous with a lovely pink-hue and the flavour was excellent. But while I was enjoying my slices, I thought that flavour was very predictable. And I remembered that time I went to southern Corsica, and when an old folk gave me a chunk of his homemade charcuterie. And how I was blown away.  \nIt was not like something I ever tasted anywhere. First of all it was grey-ish, and it had an aroma complexity and funky flavours that was out of this world. The fat was kinda rancid-ish but not in a bad way, more in a Patanegra/Iberico ham fat way. I couldn't stop myself eating more and more and every bites seemed to develop new layers after new layers of very satisfying aromatic compounds. Umami kick that was way \\*waaaaay\\* over any other charcuterie I've ever tasted.\n\nSeeing who gave it to me and the color of the product, I'm 99% sure it was made without nitrites, using only salt. And after digging a bit more online, I want to adress the nitrite problem another way : I'm afraid it actually standardizes flavor profile, and restrain funky flavours to get in.\n\nThere is a company making \"properoni\", apparently crazy good pepperoni without nitrites and they have a very very solid reputation. If they can sell a nitrite-free product at a commercial scale, I guess they are acting safely and know what they are doing. There must be a way to make nitrite-free charcuterie that are 100% safe from botulism. And I wanted you guys insights about what that way could possibly be. Especially since I have ordered a brisket that is actually sitting in my freezer and I don't know if I should order #1 or not yet.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting a standardized, easy to scale product, that have a consistent flavor profile. And I love bacon and all kind of charcuteries with nitrates. But I adore wild fermentation because of unexpecting aromas kicking in and want to find a third way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kef4uw/another_nitrite_debate_what_about_flavour/", "created_utc": 1746347909.0, "score": 1, "author": "valzbeul", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kef4uw/another_nitrite_debate_what_about_flavour/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": []}

The problem is that it's quite expensive, often  more than twice the popular supermarket brands like Prego or Ragu. But it's still probably cheaper than a restaurant.\n\nIf you want to make a sauce on your own, the easiest and very highly rated sauce is by Marcella Hazan. It has 4 ingredients: canned tomatoes, onion, butter, and salt.

Then finish cooking the pasta in the sauce itself. This will help the pasta hold onto the sauce. Also, reserve some of the pasta water. If the sauce gets too thick, add some of the pasta water. This water will be salted and have starch from the pasta so you'll get a richer more flavorful sauce than if you just added water. Speaking of which, make sure the water that you boil the pasta in is well salted. They say the water should taste like the ocean.\n\nThis is what restaurants do.", "I\u2019d look up recipes on homemade pasta sauce, that probably is most of the restaurant feeling you are missing right there. \n\nIf possible I\u2019d mince some garlic instead of using garlic salt, but that isn\u2019t a huge deal. \n\nMore seasonings than salt will also help, but those will probably be in the sauce recipe already so don\u2019t double season!", "Probably butter.

Turn the spuds - they should be starting to show signs of cooking, but not yet browned.  Put the carrots in with them - about 15 minutes should have passed.   Put your meat in a separate baking dish ready for the oven.  Wash up.   Put your dinner plates in the warming shelf under the oven, if you have one. Check the spuds - they should be starting to brown and crisp on the bottom side.   Turn them and put on the lower shelf. Put the meat into the oven on the higher shelf, turn the temperature up to 200c.  Check the time or put on a timer.   Set the table, make packet gravy and set aside on the stove to keep warm. .  After about 15 minutes, turn the meat, and turn the veggies.   If the meat is getting too dark, and the potatoes are too pale, swap their oven positions.   \n\nAt the 25 minute mark your meat is nicely medium.   Leave it an extra 3-5 minutes if you prefer it done more.    Remove meat from oven, put on warm plate and cover with foil so it can rest.  Check roast veggies, and adjust oven temp if they aren\u2019t quite ready.   Put green veggies into microwave for 3 - 4 minutes or to taste.   Put gravy back on burner to heat up again.  \n\nWhen microwave pings, drain the greens, and put on plates if not serving straight from the dish.     Put potatoes and carrot on serving dish or on plates.  remove foil from meat, and cut into slices. Don\u2019t panic if you get some slightly pink juice - it will be very juicy and will look browner when the cut slices are on the plate.   Pour over gravy, or pour gravy into serving jug.   Enjoy.   \n\nLittle onions are nice as well - put them in at the same time as the carrots.    I usually put baking paper in the bottom of the roasting pans to make the cleanup easier."]}

The world is ending, enjoy your dinner.", "There are only three kinds of wine I use in 99% of cooking that requires wine, one white, and two reds.\n\nThe main function of white wine in cooking is to add subtle acidity. Basically, think of it as using a flavorful, very dilute white wine vinegar. It's dilute because you want the flavor : acid ratio to be very high so that, by the time you've got acid where you want it, you've added a lot of flavor.\n\nWhat are the flavors you don't want, then? Oak. Oak or any kind of wood is really not good flavor when it's concentrated down. There are probably specific exceptions to this where concentrated wood bitterness is desirable, but if you're not doing some kind of Michelin star dessert where you're trying to balance off some high level of sweetness with specific blah blah, just stick with whites fermented in stainless.\n\nWhat else to avoid? Roundness. Any wine that has undergone malolactic fermentation is probably not it. You are trying to bring acidity to the party, that means sharper notes, malic acid, not lactic acid. You can add roundness to your recipe by adding butter or cream or some other thing that will bring its own desirable flavors along, don't try to use white wine to do this.\n\nOther notes to avoid: floral or sweet notes. You want bright, acidic whites, don't go for floral notes because those either won't survive or will cook down into weird flavors, and sweetness is probably not a good thing in any dish you wouldn't add sugar to. (If you would add sugar, there may be better options, but you could at least consider this.)\n\nAll of this means that you're usually going to be looking at a Sauv Blanc or similar for white. You definitely want to stay away from butterballs.\n\nFor red, I find there are two basic types of wine, there's dry and there's fruity. Pick the one that goes best with your dish.\n\nA dry red is something that brings a good amount of acidity and has restrained but pleasant fruit, and not prominent wood. I associate this with Old World table wines, inexpensive Bordeaux. Burgundy is a little tougher to find that fits the bill, but possible. Chianti with little to no wood.\n\nThe other category of red is the bigger, lusher reds with bigger fruity notes, think New World Cab. These still need decent acidity and should stay away from big wood, and I like fruity notes that tend more toward berries than fleshy fruits, they tend to retain more character when cooked down than notes like \"plum\" do in my experience.\n\nAgain, there are exceptions, you can definitely find wines across the spectrum that do well in certain dishes that don't seem to follow any of these rules, but in general you want to stick with inexpensive wine because any nuance you'd pay for won't survive cooking, but it still has to be well made so that you avoid bitter notes, off notes, too much wood, they can't be flabby and have to have a decent backbone of acidity, and so wines that have any kind of adulteration applied are generally only going to concentrate into badness.\n\nIt's actually not that easy to find a good wine that meets all of these requirements, even if you ease up on the cost part of the equation that's not necessarily a guarantee of success either.\n\nAnother thing to take into account is how much wine the recipe calls for. If it's just a splash or even a cup for a decent sized stew, you can break some of these rules and it won't matter much. If you're doing burgundy beef that calls for an entire bottle, though, and you put in a New World fruity and intense Pinot instead of an inexpensive, restrained, and acidic Burgundy, it's not going to be a disaster, but it will not help the dish.\n\n(Obviously ignore everything here if you're talking about desserts or some other application.)", "Red and white wine *vinegar* instead. Same effect with less used and a longer shelf life\u00a0\n\n\nAt least in my opinion the same effect", "Not a common one anymore but for a white with dishes like seafood, making a garlic/wine butter, chicken etc I almost always use a Chablis. Especially seafood. I don't really like cooking with other Chardonnays. I'm also disappointed with 'almost' everything else (I have a few exceptions but only with certain chicken and veal dishes). It seems to compliment the food better and has a cleaner taste. FYI, I don't often cook heavy dishes.\n\nGive it a try with any lighter seafood dish.

Save them for where you want added sweetness. \n\nWhite and red both have their uses, I used ros\u00e9 once and didn\u2019t like the flavour, however. White is great with creamy dishes and works well with chicken and mushrooms. \n\nRed wine works well with beef and more hearty rich cuts of meat. It goes well with tomato based sauces and you can still use it with dairy, like you would in bolognese, adding it after the milk has evaporated out. \n\nWhen you add the wine, reducing it over a medium high heat with the food until reduced to almost nothing will help concentrate those flavours.", "Red: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir\n\nWhite: Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio\n\nFortified: sherry, port, marsala\n\nI\u2019ve heard that oaked wines like Chardonnay do not cook up well.

Fold vs mixing to keep cubes intact.  If dry or not mixing well, add a touch more oil.  Cubes break up a bit but the nooks and crannies are extra crunchy.", "I just made crispy tofu last night! Blanch them in heavily salted boiling water for about 10 minutes, then drain them very well and pat them dry. They\u2019ll crisp right up in the pan with just some oil. I\u2019ve had mixed results with cornstarch but this has never failed me. Kenji Lopez has a whole article on why this works!", "What are you trying to achieve, exactly?\n\nJust get some get some regular (not hard) tofu and fry a couple of pieces in plenty of oil, by themselves, at a fairly high temp, in a wok (use whatever, but a big flat bottom means more oil). It's gonna be crispy like a fried egg, not crispy like potato chips (french fries? pommes frites?), mind you. In fact, think of it like frying an egg. You wouldn't fry an egg in an air fryer, would you? Let it brown and crisp on one side and separate from the pan before turning. Then eat them with some salt and your spice of choice. Simples.\n\nThe tofu is already cooked when sold (just how it's made), so once you like the texture on the outside and the serving temp it is done. Overcooking will only dry it out. So it's a super-simple quick highish-temp fry. \n\nCorn starch or potato starch can work for a starchy, crispy coating, depending on how you are serving. There is a reason frozen chips (french fries?) come coasted in wheat/rice/corn/potato starch nowadays. But it will not stay crisp if put it into any sauce prior to serving. Great to serve salt-and-pepper tofu style, and super crispy served like that. The starch will stick together in the fryer a bit, which I find really annoying.\n\nI'd actually advise against drying out already firm/hard tofu by pressing it further unless you have a specific purpose in mind. I'm seeing people advocating this is this thread, but have personally had awful results with this approach. It becomes dry, rubbery, nasty. There can be reasons to freeze to affect texture, but 'hard' tofu sold in western market stores is too dry already for how people use it, and if you press it more you are making it worse. Trust the factories that actually make it to know better than you do. Overpressing your already overpressed tofu more will not hep you to fry it any crispier.", "I actually found my favourite way to prepare tofu last week. After I drained semi-firm fresh tofu, I dusted it with cornstarch, then fried in peanut oil, and it already got crispy this way, but the best was to just pour a mix of all purpose soy sauce, dark soy sauce, maple syrup and garlic on it, while it was still pretty hot, so the liquid vaporized mostly and it got super sticky with crispy parts.", "Buy tofu press and use paper towel to dry before frying", "Tofu is mostly water which is the enemy of crispy.

I switched from an excellent gas range to induction, mainly for environmental reasons. I would say that overall from a purely cooking perspective, I slightly prefer gas. I think the main area where there's a clear difference for me is wok cooking (I'm Asian). The experience of wok cooking on a powerful gas burner cannot be replicated. I even got a standalone wok induction unit with a curved base for round bottom woks. It's passable, but it's not the same as gas.\n\nThere are pros and cons to the \"digital\" nature of power levels on induction compared to the analog gas control. My range has 9 power levels, and if I'm trying to dial in a very precise simmer or a low temperature (like for onsen eggs) sometimes I find that I want to be in between power levels, so I have to keep alternating between like a 2 and a 3, for example. On the other hand, for specific dishes that I cook all the time, I might know that I specifically want it at a 6 or a 7, and I know there will be that consistency from one day to another. With gas, you have to kind of eyeball it and adjust as you go. \n\nInduction is \\*very\\* efficient, and nothing boils water as fast as induction. Unfortunately, due to the efficiency and physics of how it works, it will also warp your pans if you're not careful. This is especially noticeable with carbon steel pans, which are my favorite to use. I've actually switched over to more cast iron since going to induction. You also generally want to preheat for a longer period, starting low and gradually increasing power. Otherwise you get a very noticeable hot spot/ring. \n\nInduction is also very easy to clean. It's a glass top obviously, which I imagine is not too different from your current electric flat top, but because the surface doesn't get super hot you don't get food burning onto it. Response time is also much faster, honestly almost equal to gas. And when you turn it off, it's off immediately. Very helpful when something is boiling over.\n\nOverall, if I give the cooking experience on gas a 10, induction is like a 9. And assuming you give half a damn about the environment, I think it's totally worth going to induction in order to not be burning fossil fuels inside your home. Decades from now all homes will have induction stoves, and people will be like \"I can't believe people used to just burn gas in their kitchen to cook.\"", "When it was time to replace our coil top we went with a dual fuel gas/electric Miele. I do a lot of Asian cooking and also pressure canning (my canner is an All American made from aluminum) so the gas top had more advantages. We also put in a robust overhead ventilation system so factor that into costs if going with gas. Check if you need to replace your cookware if you choose induction.", "After attempting to price out propane for my all electric house someone pointed me at induction during our kitchen remodel. I was a big fan of gas but I am completely converted. I love cooking on induction, the control far surpasses gas.\n\nI was hesitant on the touch controls on my GE Profile but the price was right and it matched our other appliances so that's what I went with. It's very easy to get used to them, the only caveat is that they do not work well when your hands are wet. If you have ever picked up a hot cast iron from the oven with a towel and wet hands you will know that wet hands in the kitchen is a No No. One of the really big factors with induction is clean up. The glass really does not get that hot, so you can wipe it down in the middle of cooking. With touch controls I can lock the panel and wipe the entire top, burners and controls, and reenable in seconds. I am a crazy messy cook and it's so much better than either gas or electric for cleanup. I have had a couple of major spills that were not a problem.\n\nThe lack of excess heat coming off the sides of cookware makes the kitchen a lot cooler. It's a very significant difference from gas.\n\nMy latest addition has been this griddle. [Seasoned Carbon Steel Griddle - Made In](https://madeincookware.com/products/carbon-steel-griddle/griddle-nl)  It is the only griddle that has a perfectly flat bottom. It fits like a glove on the GE Profile and the Cafe. The burners can synch front and back. Let it heat up for just a bit and it got more heat coverage than you would expect. This griddle fits as an oven rack as well.\n\nMy last caveat is that you need to be aware of how much power induction can put into a pan in a short amount of time. My wife's son put my cast iron comal on the big burner to heat tortillas and cranked 3700W to high. That pan snapped in half in about 45 seconds. But, if you put a giant pot of water on there and crank it, a watched pot will boil. I love seeing the bubbles instantly appear at the bottom. Got rid of my electric kettle and got a nice steel one.\n\nI even got a portable induction that I take camping and hook up to a Jackery power station. Pretty much done with propane now.", "The GE Cafe is fantastic, I love ours so much. Pricey, but the knobs for the heating elements make it a joy to use. They have a single and double oven versions.\n\nIn the summer there is much less heat gain in the kitchen vs gas. We do a lot of canning, and being able to bring a large pots of water to a boil quickly saves us a ton of time. It's about 17 minutes to bring 15 quarts of water to a boil, which on my old electric flat top took more than 45 minutes.\n\nYou need compatible cookware (if a magnet sticks to the pan it will work). I had to buy a large stock pot because my aluminum pressure cooker does not work.\n\nLightweight stainless cookware can make a buzzing sound depending on the power level and what is in the pan but I don't find it annoying and most of the time the buzzing goes away after the pan heats up.", "Under normal circumstances (i.e. not cooking at 2AM in a Japanese house with paper walls you share with neighbours) I really don't think noise is a concern. Induction isn't that loud, and I've only cooked on cheaper stuff (that I assume is louder). It doesn't heat up the kitchen, unlike gas, so a bit of noise is a brilliant tradeoff.", "I grew up cooking on electric coil, then cooked on gas for thirty years, then got an induction cooktop a year or so ago. I would not go back! The only thing I miss about my gas range is that it worked during power outages, so it helped with household resiliency.", "Yes do it! I love my induction stove so much.\n\nIt can throttle itself sometimes if cooking in high heat for a prolonged time. But I just put a welding mat under my own and that seems to solve the issue. That's really been my only complaint. Oh and at least on mine (an entry level model from Samsung) the 4 burners are on 2 circuits, and they'll throttle themselves if you try to run both burners on the same circuit above around 60%power. Which can be annoying, but only rarely. \n\nIf budget were no constraint I'd go for one of the models with the the square or rectangular inductors so that I could use a double burner griddle or even just a square griddle and actually get the whole surface hot.", "My wife and I always used gas ranges and we bought an all electric home about 10 years ago. We bought an LG range, and it is fantastic. The quickly adjusting heat levels and the power are unbelievable, plus it is so easy to clean", "Induction is objectively the best kind of stove tops.\n\nI would buy Bosch or Miele.", "I put induction in my last house and when I sold that place and moved the new place had gas.  I really feel that for someone who is really into cooking, gas simply cannot be beat.  Your ability to adjust temperature is infinite, depending on what BTU you buy gas can get hotter, wok cooking is much better, etc...  I think for me though the biggest problem with inductions was that it only heats the bottom it the pan  you don't get any heat up the sides.  I also found it to warp any pan that was thin, like carbon steel or old cast iron.  The environmental concerns of gas are way over blown and mostly made up.  It is a concern if you leave it on unlit or have poor ventilation.  As long as you turn your fan on, you are good to go.", "I will never get induction, because all of my expensive cookware is copper \n or aluminum and it would cost more to replace than a new stove. \n\nI see why people like induction, I think, but gas is just so easy. Turn up the flame, it gets hotter, turn off the flame and it gets cool. You can see the flame and the level not a little led on a screen.  And of course gas can do ANY cookware, even make toast or char the skin on peppers or tomatoes.  And is less expensive.", "I have an older Miel 4 hob induction I\u2019ve been cooking on for 13 years and it\u2019s awesome and has been service free. Theres a few things it doesn\u2019t do really well\u2026 like wok cooking, but in general it\u2019s great.", "Get a portable one first. Try it out to see if you like it or not. I got a pair for $100 on an infomercial. They are nice but I rarely use it except for fondue.", "I have no experience with induction ranges outside of individual burners. But I have heard, and perhaps others on this thread can verify for me, that they do not work well for water bath and pressure canning, due to the weight of the canners and the potential to crack the surface.\n\nSo if you\u2018re the kind of cook who cans (I am), I\u2019d do a pile of research before selecting an induction stove over gas for that purpose.", "I have induction and absolutely love it.  We don't use gas for environmental reasons, and the fact that you need much better ventilation when you have a gas stove.\n\nIf you need to buy new cookware, be aware that not all induction compatible cookware is the same.  Some work way better on induction than others.  I love my enameled cast iron pots and pans.  I have some stainless steel as well, and I find that some heat faster than others (like taking 1 minute instead of 30 seconds to boil the same amount of water).  I have no idea which ones are good and which ones are not, but it's something to consider if you're going to purchase new stuff anyway."]}

The shrimp I add is already boiled on the stove.  To me, no shrimp is better than really large wild caught shrimp in the shells.  Shelled shrimp never taste as good, and it doesn't take long to shell them after cooking and rinsing in cold water.  Fill a big pot with water, add salt, add frozen shrimp once the water is boiling, wait until the water foams up to the top of the pot and take pot off heat. It's only like a few minutes.

When cleaning your shrimp use a paring knife or utility/petty knife to peel things at first. It\u2019ll be easier for you to clean it without just tearing things apart with your hands \n\n5. The beautiful thing about shrimp is they fully change color when they\u2019re cooked and they cook really fast. In most cases you\u2019re more likely to over cook the shrimp than undercook it. Take 1 piece out when you think they\u2019re done and cut it in half to check doneness. Much easier with shrimp cause you can plan for 1 to be \u201cunpretty\u201d while still keeping the others full if you\u2019d like. \n\nYou got this!"]}

Freeze leftovers, especially lasagna. But frozen dinners or freeze leftovers for quick lunch, to take to work. \n\nOur small one is only about 2 to 3 feet wide. A small one holds a surprising amount, but you'll be still able to get into the bottom pretty easily.\n\nUprights are great but they're hard to move and take up a lot of room.

A lot of the meals I like don't freeze well, so I wouldn't spend money on a freezer for the few things I'd use it for.

It paid for itself in a year from savings on bulk purchases. I kept track. \\*grin\\* Then COVID came along and I looked like a genius. \n\nThere are two of us.

I'd have gone another size bigger but we had a spot that the 10 cu ft just fit into that my wife liked so that's what I got. We've run out of room a few times. \n\nI also do home canning for shelf stable storage which provides some space relief as I can what many people freeze (sauce, soup, chili). I recently made three gallons of pasta sauce which would have chewed up a lot of freezer space. We'll make a few gallons of tomato basil soup in late summer which will go on the shelf also. I'll make a bunch of chili in the Fall. \n\nWe keep an inventory of what's in the chest freezer and have a basic organization so finding things is straightforward. Our basic chest freezer needs to be defrosted a couple of times each year and I use that as an opportunity to unload, defrost (I have a heat gun but a hair dryer will do), and reload with updated organization. I just did that two days ago and it took thirty minutes. We've tried all sorts of apps for inventory but paper works best for us. \n\nI happen to have a bunch of quilted moving blankets which I throw over the freezer when we lose power until I decide to run our generator. I keep an ice cube tray with dimes on top in the freezer. When the dimes start to sink it's time to run the generator. I have an IR thermometer but the dimes are easier.

Minor issues with chest freezer is organization, it's much harder to store things in a manner that is easy to look for them. They end up in a jumbled mess that you riffle through when you need something, things get forgotten in there and jostling them around can mess with your vacuum seals. It's still way better than not having extra freezer space, so if that's all you have space for then go for it.", "Do yourself a favor if you're getting a standalone freezer, and go for an upright one instead of a chest one. \n\nI've had both, and the upright freezers are so much more convenient and easy to clean. \n\nBut to answer your question, yes, they're well worth investing in. I paid $500 for my original one, and in the long run it probably saved me over $2000 in food costs because I could buy food when it was on sale and freeze it for later use.

It made sense to me, but in an abstract way since I only had pictures and lessons to learn from.

If the pH rises above 4.6, it may not be safe for long-term preservation, increasing the risk of bacterial growth like botulism. For safe reuse, test the pH (using pH strips) or add fresh vinegar to ensure sufficient acidity.\n2. **Dilution of Flavor:** The brine\u2019s flavor (salt, spices, etc.) can weaken after the first use, leading to less flavorful pickles. You may need to add more salt, spices, or fresh brine to boost the taste.\n3. **Contamination Risk:** If the original pickle juice was exposed to air, utensils, or hands, it could harbor bacteria or mold. Always ensure the brine is clean, and consider boiling it before reuse to kill potential contaminants.\n4. **Type of Pickles:** Reusing juice works best for quick refrigerator pickles, not for canning or long-term storage, unless you verify the acidity and follow proper canning procedures.\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n* Use the juice within a week or two for best flavor and safety.\n* Strain the juice to remove any debris or old spices.\n* Add fresh cucumbers or other veggies (like carrots or cauliflower) to the brine and refrigerate for 1\u20133 days for quick pickles.\n\nThere\u2019s no absolute reason you can\u2019t reuse pickle juice, but for safety and taste, take these precautions. If you\u2019re unsure about the brine\u2019s condition, it\u2019s better to start fresh. \n\n**Disclaimer:** Always prioritize food safety. If you\u2019re unsure about the brine\u2019s acidity or cleanliness, consult a trusted recipe or food safety guideline (e.g., USDA or NCHFP) to avoid health risks.", "Have you heard of urotherapy?

It will be expensive.\n\n\nThe night before you cook, cover the steak in a lot of salt, enough that it looks like a fresh coating of snow.

I usually put chopsticks or forks under the steak so juice can run out and it won't get soggy.\n\n\nTo cook, get a metal pan ripping hot. Highest heat your stove can do. Cast iron or steel. Leave it on high heat for a few minutes. Cast iron is ready when it starts smoking. Put two tablespoons of olive oil in the pan. Let it sit for a minute and it will start to smoke. Put the steak in.

That's the simplest way that will get you decent results. The next version is similar but flip the meat every 30 seconds to one minute for 8 minutes, which will reduce the grey band that you see when you cut into a steak. \n\nThe next more complicated version is reverse searing, which you'll need a meat thermometer for, preferably one you can leave in the meat. This involves roasting/baking the steak in the oven at a low temperature until it's a bit less than the desired temp (medium rare is 130, so cook to about 115-120), then finishing in a very hot pan to sear the outsides quickly.\n\nYou can add another step by dry brining, which is seasoning the steak hours (usually overnight) before cooking. The salt draws some of the moisture out, but then the meat slowly draws it back in, seasoning it from the inside, as well as tenderizing it and giving you a good sear. You can do this regardless of how you cook it.

It all started out something simple such as instant ramen noodles then later made more variety of dishes after learning some recipes from Youtube & Tiktok. It then became a passion of mine where I began making multicultural cuisines from all over the world as a project and also it gave me something to be interested in to learn about the culture, traditions, origins behind these cuisines. \n\nI made dishes such as Russian Borscht. Korean Jhapae, English Breakfast, French Onion Soup, Swedish Meatballs, Chinese Chicken Chow Mein, Swedish Meatballs, etc. \n\nFor the record, I grew up and was raised in Canada and my family immigrated here and ran a Chinese Takeout businiess \ud83e\udd61 so growing up, I never actually took advantage to help out nor did I ever cared about cooking/food since it was never my interest until now. I even had my first job working at Tim Hortons (which is culinary I suppose) but it only lasted about a week and another job which is Peri Peri chicken restaurant but failed miserably on that too. Only reason I had those jobs was because I used my family's name to catapult me an employment without actually having any experience in the kitchen at all and the one lesson I learned from that was back in High School my teacher taught us  \"There is NO shortcuts in life\". (And that statement can't be anymore true).\n\nNow that I have actually put in the amount of effort and the discipline over the years in learning and cooking \ud83c\udf73 I can confidently say that I am able to work in the restaurant industry, but I am also aware what I will be expecting and know that it will be a different environment than cooking at home since I be expecting pressure and fixing the food of customers complaints and even the hostility of some of the staff I may be working with.\n\nRegardless, I have the passion and the commitment to do this (even if I fail), because it's something that I discovered that actually compelled me to keep going in life and I felt like it gave me a sense of purpose instead of being it just a regular day job. It makes me feel alive and its like my personal therapy while doing it. Every morning I even go to the kitchen and make breakfast or even dinner from scratch because I have too much pride in ordering take out and wanted to craft my skills.

Did host/server/runner/expo/food\\_prep/togo. So, I feel I've got a decent understanding of the flow BOH (back of house). To answer your questions:\n\n1. Heat can be a problem and it can be worse/better depending on the restaurant. If they have proper AC, it'll still get warm and you're going to be sweating at times, but you shouldn't be dripping or anything. However, if they don't, it can get really hot unfortunately.\n   1. Your skin isn't going to melt off, but my bigger concern would be all the steam, grease, etc will clog up your pores and stuff (acne, rosacea could flare up, etc). Another thing is the hand washing since, if you're like super hygienic, your hands are gonna be red and dry.\n   2. If I were you, I would try to get an opening shift since it's generally less chaotic and also, far less hot in the back. By the end of the day, it's literally been filled up with heat, breathing, etc. Plus, you get to do food prep which is super relaxing! One of mi amigas would watch shows while doing it (btw, if you're in the US, expect to know some Spanish).\n   3. Closing has a LOT of cleanup. So, you're gonna be there at least 1-2 hours after closing time of the restaurant.\n2. Your body will get used to it, but you'll probably look exhausted at the beginning lol Avoid working doubles since it can be a lot and you'll likely pass out from exhaustion (not literally).\n3. They'll likely start you off with something simple at the beginning. You might have to handle salads, desserts, and food prep. Trust me when I say this, you'll get the hang of it quickly.\n\nAnd here are my biggest notes for you to consider:\n\n* The cooking environment can be **stressful.** If you're doing food prep/salads/desserts, it likely won't. However, depending on the kitchen expo (person directing the orders), it can be a nightmare. If they are a screamer, I'm sorry, just bail on the job. It ain't worth it for your mental health.\n* You're going to run into some incredibly stupid people in the BOH (specifically Americans). Just don't engage. Do your job. If they're really toxic, just leave.\n* A LOT of food gets wasted. Like, you're going to be concerned with how much gets thrown away for even trivial things (e.g. steak was overcooked). Sometimes they thankfully won't and will give it to the BOH. But that is not always the case :/\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!", "Since several replies already covered footwear and clothing, I'll just address they stress, keeping up with the pace and learning.  \n  \nWorking in a kitchen can involve many hours of not too stressful work, such as meal prep, especially if the restaurant uses fresh veg & meats.\n\nWhen the pace does pick up, just go with and try not to stress it.

Hardwoods like maple are fine-grained and can trap bacteria, which are eventually killed as the board dries after cleaning.\n However, wood boards are more porous and can develop grooves and cuts that may harbor bacteria if not properly cleaned.\n Despite this, research shows that wooden cutting boards are not a significant hazard to human health, and plastic boards may pose more risks due to their tendency to accumulate grooves and cuts where bacteria can hide.\n To ensure safety, it's important to clean and sanitize cutting boards properly, regardless of the material, and replace them when they become excessively worn.\n\nRegular cleaning with hot, soapy water and sanitizing with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water can help maintain hygiene.\n Additionally, using separate cutting boards for raw meat and other foods can prevent cross-contamination.", "always wood, if you maintain a wood cutting board properly there should be no worry for bacteria. glass and marble is a big no no, those will dull your knife.

I prefer Tenryo because of the heft of them and are slip resistant-  its what most high end Japanese restaurants use-  but HDPE ones are what we use in most Western professional kitchens and they can go in the dishwasher. Also cheap as hell at a restaurant supply store. Anyone saying glass, metal or marble is a hamster brain- those are great way to chip a blade and dull a knife in two seconds. Cheap plastic boards get torn up. Snd theres no earthly reason to get ones knickers in a twist over using the same board for chicken and vegetables unless one lack water sop and opposable thumbs. Disposable, peelable boards are great for people with mobility/disability challenges. HDPE and polyvinyl acetate boards minimise stress to the hand and wrist and have less impact on the blade, resulting in better edge retention. \n\n* Wood is good for cutting boards but requires more upkeep. Its a fight between convenience and 'looks pretty on my counter.' Wood isn't used in pro kitchens because the upkeep makes them a bitch to stay in the good graces of the health department. Also, depends on the type of wood. Boos maple is a well recommended one.\n\n* No one can tell you what is going to feel right in your hand. Knife selection is based on how and what you cook- weight, length, blade shape, push or rock chop, handle style- wa or Western, Japanese or German steel, carbon or stainless, plans for upkeep, etc etc etc. Not for nothing, its kind of like asking what kind of car should I buy or how long is a piece of string. You might prefer a traditional Western/gyuto shape vs. a flat bottomed push cut santoku vs. a boxy, flat bottomed Japanese nakiri because you love vegetables or prefer its Chinese cousin the cai dao. \n\n* As as an example about the Mariana Trench of knife brands I'm a chef so have played with a ton of brands over the years. I've never heard of Rada, Globals have the shittiest handle grip and if your hands have a lick of grease on them that thing can fly across the room, Cutco's are a pyramid scam and are mostly recommended by the knife rep equivalent of Mary Kay ladies, MACs and Misen are good bang for your buck, German knifes can be very heavy and the main brands have so many brand extensions ranging from shite to good value that its hard to tell them apart, Kiwis are cheap as dirt and can grab a good edge but don't stay that for long, same with Victorinox but they ain't cheap anymore, Dalstrong is crap disguised in fancy marketing materials as are all of those 'Damascus steel!' ads- its just decoration since the method of making actual Damascus steel as an art form is long lost to the sands of time like the recipe for Greek Fire.\n\n* If you can, go to an actual knife shop and test drive. If you're near NYC- Korin is great at pulling knives ahead of time based on your preferences and letting you whack at tomatoes in the store. Same goes for The Japanese Knife Company in London.\n\n* I have tiny toddler hands so I prefer a light Japanese carbon steel but I also work high volume so need a long blade to cover more territory on the board. My day to day is a 270mm Misono Swedish Carbon Steel gyuto. Its got a cool dragon on it. More advanced when it comes to maintaining the blade angle but gets hella sharp and stays that way. For heavy veg prep, Masakage Yuki nakiri carbon core, stainless clad, doubles as a shovel but needs to be thinned quite a bit. Serrated, paring, boning, filet, I still use Mercers I got in culinary school a million years ago. Better quality than Victorinox and I'm not breaking down \u00a320k tuna flown in from Japan so I don't need some stupidly expensive sujihiki that could be used for impromptu amputations.\n\n* This sub is pretty notorious for copy/pasting the same brand recommendation that they heard that professionals use without having experience with multiple brands and quality of steel. Aka the regurgitation of Victorinox over and over and over.  Take a gander at r/truechefknives where the experts live. Can be intimidating but if you want to know what knife nutjobs think about a particular brand, they are brutally honest.\n\n* I wouldn't buy an expensive knife and then use a pull through. Get a double sided whetstone 1000/3000 and watch some videos from Vincent the knife guy at Korin in NYC. Great tutorials. I have never used one but I hear good things about the Shapton sharpening system. Whatever you do, don't let anyone at Sur La Table touch anything you like. Bunch of hacks. Knife blocks are bad for blades, are rarely of any kind of quality and contain a bunch of knives that are redundant. Dump the block and buy a few saya covers and shove em in a drawer. Instant additional counter space and less thoughts of creepy crawlies in those knife slots.\n\n* Buy a steel and learn how to use it. Doesn't sharpen- its re-aligns the blade keeping it useful in between hitting them with the stones.\n\n* Do yourself another favour and grab a three pack of Kuhn Rikon Y peelers and kitchen shears that come apart for cleaning. No shame in using them to de-back bone a chicken instead of a knife.\n\nGood luck out there.", "Shun or kikuichi for blades\n\nWood or bamboo cutting board", "I can recommend you a really good brand, John Boos,  all my family including me, use it!", "Hasegawa board\nAnd takamura Hana gyuto", "What's your budget for each.

I don't think it's mandatory. A crockpot is one of the few ways of cooking that enables you to be totally lazy about it. I have unpredictable sleeping times and I love the slow cookers for this. If it's on the range or in the oven, I can forget it and things go wrong - boil dry, get burnt. In the crockpot food basically gets better the longer it goes.\n\nIt does depend what you're cooking though. I like to cook meat by itself for a long time, like 10-16 hours. Typically then I make broth with the bones, which cooks for 5-6 hours. Stuff like carrots and potatoes will turn to mush though, so I add them 1-2 hours before eating and they cook nicely.", "Does you\u2019re have any automated features? We have one that automatically turns to the warm setting when the set time is done. Come with a probe that you can use to program it to turn to warm when the meat hits a certain temp. Usually the timer is sufficient. Never ruined anything. The only time that happened was when we had one that wasn\u2019t a timer and my wife got stuck at work late so it was actively cooking (instead of being held warm) for an extra two hours. Even then, it was still edible, the chicken was just a little dry and the spices tasted a little burnt.\n\nSo I would say, best would be if you have a crock pot with someway where you don\u2019t have to worry about when you get back to the pot. It just finishes cooking and it\u2019s hot and ready for you when you get home. Opening a crock pot to check for doneness released heat and steam, two things you want to keep inside as much as possible got the crock pot to do its thing.

Great for meatballs in sauce, hot dogs (not all day tho) , cheese..  so they are good for keeping shit warm at parties too but the point is you don't mess with them and if you can't tell that meat is cooked just by knowing and observing then you need to either chill out or keep learning how to cook because you don't know how lol.", "I used to but found most of them get way too hot and dry the food out too much. I instead to save time by prepping things ahead of time and throw them in a dutch oven at the end of my workday.\u00a0", "There are a couple of things I make in a crock pot that require active checking. \n\nBoneless pork chops - there seems to be a barely-5-minute interval where they go from not quite at temp to dried out. My crock pot only has time settings at 30-minute intervals, so I usually start checking the temp with a meat thermometer at 1 hr 20 minutes (and more often than not, it's already done at that point, and if not, it's barely another 3-5 minutes).\n\nMac and cheese - I add cream cheese at 1 hour in, and then start checking at 1 hr 30 min to see if the noodles are fully cooked. The time tends to vary by 15-30 minutes depending on the kind of noodles used, and while overcooking isn't exactly a problem, you lose the nice creamy cheese sauce if too much liquid gets absorbed (there's no Velveeta or cream of cheddar in my recipe).\n\nSomething like pulled pork - I would absolutely not worry about overcooking it. Beef stew, brisket, carnitas, that stuff will not dry out, usually it's fatty enough that even if you don't initially add enough liquid, it'll make its own. Chicken doesn't usually take long enough to be gone all day, but I wouldn't be checking on it, I would just come back when the time is done.", "Your partner is completely wrong.

Here\u2019s what I have so far:\n\n* Pasta (usually bolognese, pesto, or sausage & fennel rigatoni)\n* Grain or pasta salad (I mostly make veggie quinoa salad and Italian pasta salad, but need more ideas)\n* Sheet pan meals (usually beef sausage with veggies and a grain, but I\u2019d love more options)\n* Rice with stir fry or meatballs (go-to is Asian-style meatballs or stir fry)\n* Tacos, enchiladas, or fajita bowls (I love slow-cooked meats like carnitas or barbacoa)\n* Variable ethnic dishes (we like trying new things, but I can only handle very mild spice)\n\nWe don\u2019t have dietary restrictions, but we\u2019re not into seafood (though I like fish tacos if the fishy flavor can be masked).\n\nMy priorities are meals that are flavorful, nutritious, and can be partially prepped ahead (chopping veggies, making sauces, etc.).

Garlic bread isn't really adding anything here (feels a bit out of place tbh). Instead, serve some Foccaccia bread with some extra virgin olive oil, cracked black pepper, and some parmesan.

Honestly, I would just settle with Foccaccia since, when homemade, it's simply an incredible delight to just munch on.\n* I'm gonna be honest, the cauliflower a la brasa doesn't look too good. Only top is getting coated with spices. It might sound nice and look fancy, but I can already tell it's gonna be bland as hell at the root. Instead, do a Cauliflower Steak (it looks amazing and it's properly seasoned). This can be cooked in advance.\n* I would add one more veggie to the mix since I feel you need a green. I would add asparagus which is incredibly easy to roast. Just some Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Salt, Cracked Black Pepper, some red pepper flakes, and garlic powder. Throw it in the oven and you'll have a tasty green on your table :) Again, you could cook this in advance.\n* Prep the sauce for the eggplant parm before your event. And the day of, get your eggplant prepped (egg wash, panko breading, etc). Do this 2-3 hours before guests arrive. Then, you just need to cook it! My concern with freezing is that it might turn out mushy, which is not a good thing with eggplant.\n* While you're cooking your eggplant parm, cook your bolognese. ~~It's gonna be difficult to cook the salmon at the same time, but if you have a decent sized oven, you can throw the salmon in there on 2 cooking sheets.

{"title": "How to tenderize dry shredded chicken", "selftext": "I made one of those casseroles with a can of creamed soup, rice, and chicken.

I separated the rice from the chicken and shredded the chicken, but it's quite tough/chewy. What's a good way to tenderize this? Should I use another can of condensed cream of chicken and make the actual soup with it, and simmer the chicken in some of the soup? How long should I simmer it? Any other suggestions? This is one of the reasons I rarely buy canned soup. Haven't bought it for years, because I find the recipes don't turn out as good as when I make everything from scratch.

So the eggs are cooked and then set aside. Veggies are cooked and then set aside. Meat is cooked and then set aside. Between each iteration, the most the wok gets is a cursory wipe down to remove large remnants of whatever was most recently cooked and a quick plop of whatever cooking oil you\u2019re using in anticipation of the next step. Only once the rice is cooked to your desired level do you add everything back in and give it an aggressive saut\u00e9 to make sure everything is heated evenly and give the rice a chance to soak up whatever flavors the other items have. \n\nAs far as veggies for fried rice, two of my go-to\u2019s are the ones you don\u2019t want lol but luckily there are several other options. Zucchini and summer squash diced are fantastic along with cabbage, shallots, green onions, yellow onions, green beans, edamame, corn, or even frozen mixed vegetables just to not have to do any of the prep work to them. Meat options are just as varied. I personally like chicken thighs over breasts just because the dark meat provides an extra layer of flavor with its fat content. I also use bacon, ground pork, and occasionally garlic soy pan fried tofu. Though you can also use ground turkey, ground beef, or even sausage if you ever felt so inclined. The best thing about fried rice is it\u2019s an excellent way to use random scraps of produce or leftovers to bulk up the dish. \n\nThe only other thing I would consider is how you cook or treat your rice prior to turning it into fried rice. I\u2019ve been told by my mom (who generally dislikes steamed rice) that she loves my rice over most restaurants\u2019 rice. My technique for that is to just wash the rice like normal, pop it into the rice cooker, add the necessary amount of water, and cook it exactly as is. An extra step if I have time is to soak it for anywhere from 10-30 minutes after washing the rice and before draining the water and popping it into the rice cooker. Then once it\u2019s done and has sat for an extra couple of minutes, I fluff it and then add a sprinkle of salt and a splash of rice vinegar (approximately 1-1.5 teaspoons per one cup of uncooked rice) before fluffing it again. It\u2019ll smell strongly of vinegar at first but if you let it sit and cook for another few minutes, about 5-10, the smell goes away and the flavor becomes pretty mild which balances out and compliments the flavors of everything else I\u2019m serving it with.", "Fry the rice, making sure every grain is coated with oil, then add sesame oil, soy sauce and msg, free the middle and add the whisked eggs, then add the other ingredients, then any additional sauces.\n\nOther than that, you're doing things right.

The alkaline water permeates the skins better, slightly breaking down the pectins making them watertight.  The salt also helps flavor the beans, but can help soften those skins through the process of the salt-water molecules passing through the skin.

America's Test Kitchen has a brining method to solve that.", "there's no magic to it. every dried bean, lentil, pea etc is different and you just have to research recommended cooking times for each variety specifically.\n\ntake into account your personal preference for finished texture and the fact that there can be variables (like how old the bean/lentil is) that will require slight adjustments in each batch. start by cooking the item to it's minimum recommended cook time and then taste it. adjust accordingly. \n\nthere is no real danger from taste-testing a small amount of undercooked beans, and i think it's really only red kidney beans that present a real risk of toxicity anyway.", "You can also test the beans by pulling 3 or 4 out and cutting them in half; beans are usually done when there isn't any white left in the flesh", "Don\u2019t add salt until finished cooking."]}

I will go on and assume it is a hot halsa (hot as in warm/cooked), therefore I will go with:  \n\\-char the veggies: tomatoes, onions, chiles that you will use, not just burn them nonsense, let them cook both inside and outside. Chiles are what will determine how hot you want your salsa, usually fresh chiles are hotter but you can go with rehydrated dried chiles (let em boil in water for a bit), my favorite non spicy are guajillo, chilaca, california chile, great for salsas. If you want to bring the heat you can go with chile de arbol, jalape\u00f1os, serranos or chipotle, even some habanero if you really love the spice, but it is all to taste.  \n\\-after everything is properly chared or cooked, even raw, you have to mix it in a blender or a food processor, depending again, the texture you wish   \n\\-you may use either water or a bit of vegetable oil to your preference depending on what you going for, keep in mind that oily salsas are usually spicier so think about the taste you want, but if you are blending it or processing it, any other that crushing it by hand (which may also be an option), you will need to add just a bit or a lot to your salsa  \n \\-Now, finishing you salsa: you have to heat it up with a little oil in a pan, let is simmer until you reach the desired texture eliminating extra water, but this is where you season with the spices you wish to use, spices give the taste. After simmering you can either use it hot or let it cool down, if your salsa cools down they usually feel milder so keep that in mind.  \nNOTE:   \nSpices, not only hot spices, all spices are important, may I suggest cumin, garlic, salt and pepper are key, you may try some others to taste but those 4 are basic for me.

{"title": "A Simple Way to Make Good Tomato Sauce with Bad Tomatoes", "selftext": "  \nGuys, I wanted to share with you a simple recipe that we use to make an above-average tomato sauce with run of the mill, grocery bought tomatoes in the middle of winter. If you have the means of course you can make canned tomatoes in the summer and store them in the fridge but we\u2019re not at that point in our lives so this is something we do and if you\u2019d like you can give it a try.\u00a0\n\n  \nFirst we roast the tomatoes. Leave the skin on, a little bit of olive oil but do not salt it yet. Roast it high and until the skin blackens a little bit. Remove the green stem as this will make it easier to peel off the skin later on. Roast them for about 20 minutes in a 450 oven. Or you can air fry if that\u2019s more convenient.\u00a0\n\n  \nThen, after you peel off the skin you smash it with a potato smasher, fork, or any other tool that you have. Do not use a blender as it will water the tomatoes as if they are not already pretty watery.\u00a0\n\n  \nIn a pot put a little bit of olive oil, a clove of garlic and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes. Remove the garlic, lower the temperature to medium low and add the tomatoes. Caution: be careful when adding the tomatoes since the olive oil will be hot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd half a teaspoon of sugar, and half a teaspoon of salt per 2 lbs of raw tomatoes. Lower the heat and simmer for half an hour to 45 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdjust salt to your liking, finish with a little bit of sherry vinegar. If not available any other vinegar will work except for distilled white vinegar. That leaves an aftertaste to the tomatoes that is not desirable.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. This even works with store bought canned tomatoes. Roasting them is a little tricky but we spread them to a baking sheet and roast them high for about 10-15 minutes.\u00a0\n\n  \nIf you have any other tricks to make good tomato sauce with less than ideal tomatoes please share it.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kazqfx/a_simple_way_to_make_good_tomato_sauce_with_bad/", "created_utc": 1745962663.0, "score": 21, "author": "sirberaferguson", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kazqfx/a_simple_way_to_make_good_tomato_sauce_with_bad/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Cut the tomatoes in half, slice a half an onion or a few shallots, drizzle generously with extra virgin olive oil, season with salt and pepper roast on a sheet pan in a 300 degree F oven for one hour.

Making it myself now costs less than $18 to feed a family of four (with leftovers), so it goes in regular rotation. We have an Asian market within three miles of where we live, so having access to the right ingredients has really helped. I also make Masaman Curry at home to save money (they sell an amazing paste at the market). All you need is the paste, coconut milk (maybe a little sugar to add some sweetness), protein of choice and we like ours with potatoes and add sliced avocado when it's finished cooking (a restaurant that closed 20 years ago made it this way and it's always been our favorite). Some jasmine rice in the rice cooker and maybe some cilantro to sprinkle over it. So easy, quick and delicious. \n\nI figured out how to make poke bowls the way we like them at home.

And I look for new recipes that use some of these ingredients so they don't go to waste. I have a big bottle of fish sauce that serves me well. I bought a huge container of flying fish roe and seaweed salad that I keep in the freezer until I need to make poke bowls. I stock up on fresh tuna and salmon and keep it frozen and ready to go when I want to make spicy tuna/salmon to go in the bowls. I usually only need to buy avocados, mangos and cucumber when we are planning on making it. With Kee Mao I only need to buy wide rice noodles, red onion, yellow bell pepper, Thai chili peppers, Thai basil and maybe chicken thighs if we run out in the freezer. I have everything else to make the sauce.\n\nThese all go in regular rotation because everyone loves them. Our meals consist mostly of multicultural recipes. Sure, we have traditional steak and potatoes, meatloaf, pot roasts, etc. But they go in rotation just as much as our international stuff. \n\nBut I have had more than a few that didn't go as planned.

{"title": "Is Offal Just Awful?", "selftext": "As the years have gone by, I've moved from someone who used to love meat, to someone who is largely flexitarian, and in the last couple of years actually about 90% lacto/ovo vegetarian.  But I watch a lot of cooking shows.  Recently, I especially enjoy watching the UK version of *MasterChef* (can't bear the US or Australian versions), and *MasterChef:  The Professionals* (also UK).\n\nOne thing I notice with these two shows in particular is the frequent use of offal - very much in line, of course, not only with French and some Italian traditions, but also the newer \"trendy\" \"snout to tail\" \"movement\" among chefs/restaurants.  And I've always been curious - how does this stuff actually *taste*?\n\nMy experience with offal (or, offal-adjacent) animal products has been limited.  I have had liver a few times - a couple of times (in decent restaurants) tasty enough, but most times off-putting (strong-tasting, grainy/mealy texture; really unpleasant, as I've always found any type of liver pate).  I've also had tripe twice, cooked different ways.  I found it disgusting.  Kidneys - couldn't get past the first bite.\n\nI don't think I have to skill to cook offal correctly, and TBH I have no idea where I'd even *find* most of it where I live.  But to those of you with culinary experience (cooks, chefs, diners):  how *does* this stuff taste?  Sweetbreads?  Tongue?  Heart?  Brain?  Lungs?  Prairie Oysters?  Do (m)any feel that, no matter how well-prepared, these types of meats will often largely be an acquired taste? Are there some that are viewed as more \"challenging\" than others - for the chef, for the diners' palates?  Are there any that taste like more widely-consumed proteins?  Are they healthy/unhealthy?\n\nCurious to hear people's opinions.

Some kinds of tripe can sometimes be off-putting, but I\u2019ve always really liked honeycomb tripe, which again is very mild-tasting but has a springy texture that I like- I usually get it in my pho, and I\u2019ve also enjoyed it at dim sum and Italian restaurants.

Old World cuisine like those in East Asia, Europe and S America have plenty of offal dishes as much of the animal was traditionally not wasted. It's only relatively recently where mainstream American diners have come to slowly be exposed to them.  Some folks used to sneer at these without even trying, but in this day and age that only reveals how limited their palate and insular their dining experiences are.\n\nEach part has different types of tastes but the most distinguishing element is probably texture.\n\nTripe, gizzards and intestines tend are more spring-y and hold the bite texture well whether stewed, grilled or fried. However they are prepared the focus is to limit the original gamey flavor but not totally eliminate them.  Love it in Chinese, SE Asian and Italian cooking.\n\nTongue is going to be that cut of meat which used to be throwaway cheap but is going to increase in price due to popularity just like oxtail is now. Obviously Jewish delis have been serving them forever as a sliced cuts for sandwiches but Mexican-style lengua in tacos or standalone is amazing. The texture has interesting as it has a bit of spring to it like tripe but still quite traditionally meat like.\n\nLiver is versatile too.  Whether as a form of pate or lightly fried in different form.  Has a bit more of a mushy bite than meat.  Great as a source of iron.  Easy to overcook which makes it tough though.

I agree with other commenters that it\u2019s what you\u2019re used to. It depends what kind of textures and flavours set you off. \n\nFor example, I can find pork belly a bit offputting because it\u2019s luscious and holds flavours amazingly well, but it\u2019s SO fatty that I usually end up a bit grossed out. On the other hand, there\u2019s a Filipino food truck in town that does a skewer of grilled intestine covered in a sweet/vinegary sauce, and it\u2019s fantastic.

If you cool it until it\u2019s meltingly tender, slice it and serve it to someone who\u2019s not had it, that might mistake it for pot roast. \n\nBeef cheeks - not sure if it\u2019s technically offal, but loved equally to tongue for the same reasons. \n\nSweetbreads - lovely tasting, mild.  No funky organ meat taste.   \n\nFois Gras and Duck Liver - great in pate.   Not too strong a flavor. \n\nHeart (venison) - can be very tough but has a nice meaty flavor.  Heavy on the iron flavor but not unpleasantly so.  \n\nChicken Heart - this is a popular item in Yakitori menus in Japan and I love them prepared that way.  Nice flavor, great texture.  \n\nTripe - the texture can be challenging but the flavor is fine.   I have had it in menudo.   I was served a Korean dish of tripe in miso sauce in Japan that was out of this world.  \n\nRaw Pork - I was served this once, raw, sashimi style in Japan, with soy sauce and wasabi.  I was surprised I liked it and ended up eating 5 or 6 pieces.  Texture was great.  Slight minerally flavor but not too bad.  Maybe I only hate liver that\u2019s been cooked\u2026see below.  \n\nBeef Liver  -  mom use to make this when I was a kid and I absolutely HATED it.  Terribly chalky texture and a strong taste I could not stand.  \n\nChicken Liver - hated for basically the same reasons at the Beef version.", "I haven't tried that much but, I'll run through my experience with the offal that I've had\n\n* Tongue- thin sliced and seared. savory, tender, intense beef flavor\n* Liver- I don't know how I've had it. but gritty and dry when prepared poorly, creamy and rich when prepared well\n* Sweetbreads- pan seared, the fattiest burger you could imagine\n* Tripe- stewed, nearly flavorless, with a pleasant crunch/chew\n* Tendon- stewed/braised, nearly flavorless, but with a smooth, sticky texture\n\nhave you had much pho? most vietnamese restaurants will offer an option with the tripe, tendons, etc in the soup which can be a nice way to get started eating those options", "I've had chicken heart skewers at a churrascaria that were absolutely delicious, and lengua tacos are solid.  \n\nBut almost all of the organ meats are, well, kinda gross; it seems an especially bad choice to eat the filters.", "\u00a0Offal has always been more popular in the UK than in the US. Steak and kidney pie etc.\nTongue can be delicious but a pain to cook.", "I just had some scrapple from a nose to tail butcher a few days ago. It was fine until certain bites where there was an intense animal taste, almost musky. Strong and gamy seems to be the norm for organs. I\u2019ve had tongue, that\u2019s a muscle so it just tastes like beef. Rocky Mountain Oysters tasted kind of bouncy and mild, like a vaguely funky squid. I\u2019ve heard sweetbreads can be nice, and the existence of chorizo and blood pudding reminds us that most offal goes down best when it\u2019s ground and cloaked with lots of other flavors.", "I have also moved away from eating meat in the past few years but agree that offal is interesting -- I would say you should consider recipes that present these cuts in more conventional ways. Things like fillings for ravioli, part of stews or ragus, grinding into sausage, that kind of thing -- you're not looking to hide the unusual flavors but you want to introduce them next to something familiar (pasta, tomatoes, potatoes) to figure out what you like before you move on to recipes that feature the recipes more directly.", "I'm fine with chicken livers, the heart and kidneys are almost crunchewy.", "Sweetbreads are the best of the lot, creamy and rich. Blood sausage is amazing. I like tripe, it's more about the spongy texture that soaks up sauces. Tendon has a fun gummy texture. Liver makes for amazing pates. Pig ears and chicken feet are fun in Chinese dishes. Lengua tacos are great when done right.\n\nThere are a few I've tried that don't really do it for me. Andouille is too pungent, brain is just kinda mushy, not a fan of the small intestine I've tried.", "All of it is particularly abhorrent to me, but brains has to be the absolute worst in terms of texture and stench.

Again, this might be due to what I use more and how well seasoned that makes it.\n\n  \nAluminium Sheet Pans for baking, with silicone baking mats. Basically, all purpose whenever I am using the oven.\n\n3-4 smaller pots that fit on my back burners - no idea where they're from, I think they are old ones from a costco set or something.

It's smaller than my daily driver cast iron, and, that cast iron is so well-seasoned now it beats the ceramic. I use it maybe once or twice a year during holidays more for the look.\n\n5.5 qt Le Creuset Dutch Oven - Haha again, beautiful, most expensive pot I own in the Kitchen....I just rarely have the need to use it vs. my stainless steel ones, and, psychologically, I just feel like I need to baby it more. Again, maybe during the holidays is the only time I use it.\n\n12\" Stainless Steel Sauce Pan - Again, not much lighter than my cast iron, and have to use it more carefully in case it sticks.

Don't add any salt until you taste the beef, because bouillon adds salt.  I suspect your spice blend needs tweaking, but without knowing what you are using I wouldn't know how to change it.  A little spoonful of Worcestershire sauce or fish sauce would help the taste.\n\nWhat kind of beef are you using?  Extra lean is just not as good.

You get a healthy carb + healthy fats and some protein, and actually handling time is a couple of minutes. \n\nI like to prep a batch of protein, like a pack of chicken drumsticks tossed with seasoned flour and baked. I have a lot of food intolerances, so right now I sometimes just have to be functional. My meal formula is 1 starch + 1 protein + 2 non-starchy vegetable. So I grab a drumstick and a couple of slices of sweet potato + last night's broccoli soup or a bowl of salad or whatever I have handy.", "Not a whole meal but chia seed pudding works well in a big batch (as long as you stir really well!) and can last for days.

Anything green, some carrot or zucchini, frozen peas. Mushrooms are good, even dried ones. Leftover protein, a hard boiled egg, or even some tofu. \n\nFrozen dumplings can be great too\n\nI find that I can get a whole balanced meal, and plenty of fluids without much effort.", "I'm in the same boat. Soups, sandwiches, ready-made rice and roasted veggies. Cereal. Seeds, nuts, fruit, and cheese as a snack. I am a Costco buyer (deliveries) and ready-made food that I can throw in the oven are a mainstay. They have good soups. Bagged salads. I don't have much to spend but every month I will buy a protein, dairy, bread, fruit (fresh, frozen, and/or jarred), veggie (fresh, frozen, and/or jarred), and a sweet treat.\n\nUsually try to get something that I can use in multiple ways. Say a rotisserie chicken (Costco's are large and better than supermarket IMO) for sandwiches or mixed with rice or to make chicken salad. Add some taco seasoning and make tacos with it.\n\nI get fatigued easily but will cook a burger by putting it on the skillet, set the timer for 4 minutes, sit down, timer goes off I go flip, set timer for 4 minutes, sit down. Then let it rest for 4 minutes, sit down. Or throw some veggies in the oven and roast for 20 minutes. Don't even need to cut them up much. Just slice in half. Throw in a bag with a little olive oil and seasonings, massage it around and throw in a baking sheet. I don't turn or anything. Just leave it alone.\n\nThe precooked rice is good from Costco. That is 90 seconds. That with roasted veggies is good.\n\nAnything between two slices of bread can be good.

In a wide pot (one wide enough to sear a side of the roast and deep enough to have the entire roast below the rim, and one with a good lid, and the pot and lid should be oven safe AKA a stock pot), put a bit of oil, just enough to coat the bottom edge to edge, sear each side of each steak (about 10 minutes per side).  Set each steak aside as it finishes being seared.\n\nAfter all steaks are seared, put them all back in into the pot, placing them so that they sit as low as possible in the pan.  Pour in the beer, hopefully it will cover the meat barely, but if it doesn't just move the pieces around every 30 minutes to get them all cooked at about the same time.\n\nPut the lid on the pot and place it in the oven.  Check it at about 1 hour, but it usually takes at least two hours for the meat to start to fall apart.  At that point, check it 30 minutes later and then every 15 until the meat falls apart.  Go watch TV, read, knit, chat, whatever you wish in between checks.\n\nOnce the meat is falling apart, pull the pot out of the oven and shred the meat.  It shouldn't take much effort, if it does, put it back in for another 15 minutes.  Once all the meat is shredded, add the taco seasoning packets and stir well.  Let sit for 10 minutes.\n\nAt this point, it's ready to eat.  Use it in tacos, burritos, put it on a salad, just eat it with a fork.

Pull all the meat off and shred it a bit.  Put the bones in another plastic back and tie it tightly before putting them in the trash if you don't use them to make a stock (I don't bother making my own stock)\n\nRoll the shredded chicken meat in tortillas and place the roll into a casserole dish with a bit of the enchilada sauce on the bottom.  Repeat until all the chicken is used up or the dish is full.\n\nPour the rest of the enchilada sauce over the rolls.  You want to cover them but only have less than a 1/4 later on the bottom.  Cover with your desired amount of shredded cheese.\n\nPlace the dish in the oven until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling a bit (they're usually about the same time).\n\nServe and enjoy.\n\nYou can top them with fresh salsa, a bit of lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.\n\nUse this as a reason to try the variety of canned enchilada sauces available at your local market.", "Make chicken noodle soup.

Leave it to cook when the water stops boiling up. \n\nAfter 15 minutes, start babysitting it again. You want to pull it off the heat while the bottom of the pan still looks wet, but there isn\u2019t any water left.

You will still see it watery but that\u2019s normal. \n- turn off the heat and leave it for 10-12 minutes more. The rice absorbs the water at this stage. \n\nThe point is to NEVER open the lid until it\u2019s completely done.

Set your timer for 15 minutes (this varies), and then turn off that burner and finish cooking the rest of your meal.\n\nYou need to learn how your own equipment behaves and get the temperature settings just right.  You want the rice to continue simmering slowly with the lid on, not violently boiling over.\n\nThe other variables to consider are ratio of water to rice, and time.  These will change depending on what rice variety you are using, and whether you are rinsing it or not.  For plain old long grain rice that you got out of a plastic bag off the shelf of a western style grocery store, read what it says on the back of the package and follow that first time.  It'll probably be somewhere between 1.5 - 2 cups of water to 1 cup of rice, and will ask you to cook it around 17-20 minutes.  Other kinds of rice will have different ratios.  Something like Jasmine or Basmati will be somewhat similar to this, but sushi rice will require less water, but a soaking and rinsing step to get it done properly.

If you are cooking basmati rice, you can lower the water amount by just a smidge.\n\nKeeping a hard boil for too long is what turns the rice to mush and also what makes it boil over.

The grains will noticeably turn slightly translucent, that's your good-to-go sign, but if you'd like to develop a bit more flavor you can keep cooking until lightly browned. It'll smell nutty if you go that route.\n\nI don't rinse the rice at all, the heat of toasting is enough to break down the surface starches. I suspect that part of your problem was that aggressively rinsing the rice was leading to too much moisture in the final product, resulting in the mush. Cooking and saturation are related but *separate* processes; you can fully saturate a starch without it being cooked at all. Extended rinsing is essentially soaking. Raw, soaked rice is going to still be too hard to eat, but will indeed go straight from raw to mush. And if you're introducing that much moisture during \"rinsing,\" it's going to be very hard to get the ratio right in the first place.\n\nIt's an extra step, but should take you less time than extended rinsing sessions.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and toasting the rice cuts down on total cook time, to boot.", "Not asian, but i have no problem cooking rice in a pan. 2 to 1 water to rice ratio for jasmine rice set it on med.

I practiced by making eggs every morning.\n\n2. Safe knife skills. It probably feels scary to use a chef's knife at first, but it's actually more like using big scissors in practice.\n\n3. How to prep ingredients, along with proper timing. This really just comes with practice as you figure out how YOU like to lay things out. I like challenging myself to lay out all my ingredients before I start cooking using as little dishes as possible.

Lodge is solid here but a bit out of budget if not on sale however some sort of ~5 qt\u00a0enameled dutch oven is usually going to be available at the ~$50 price point e.g.: https://www.amazon.com/Crock-69140-02-Artisan-Quart-Enameled/dp/B018FVO8SU\n~$50, total 245\n\n\nAdditional options:\n\n\nNon-stick pan, a small non-stick pan can be nice for eggs. Tramontina professional is a decent choice here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Tramontina-80114-535DS-Professional-Restaurant/dp/B009HBKQ16\n~$30\n\n\nCarbon steel Wok. Great for authentic stir-frying. Joyce chen is the good budget option here although you'd need to season it yourself:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/JOYCE-CHEN-Classic-14-Inch-Uncoated/dp/B002AQSWMU?th=1&psc=1\n~$40\n\n\nAll combined that would outfit your kitchen for pretty much anything for ~$245-$305 (admittedly before shipping assuming you can't get this stuff locally) with pieces that are very durable and should last you for decades\u00a0or until you feel like upgrading a given piece.

Lots of factors... \n\n* different steels retain edge differently.  *Typically* the trade off is that the steels that can get sharper dont hold their edge as well.  \n* what kind of cutting surface you use.  glass or ceramic or the weird trendy metal boards will wreck an edge.  Some woods are harder than others.  and synthetic boards are usually very easy on the edge\n* What foods you're cutting - harder foods dull edges faster.  think butter nut squash vs fish fillet\n* Handwash or (knifegodsforbid) the cardinal sin of dishwashers. \n* Do you hone between sharpening?  Lightly restoring your edge before you start cooking, will help you go longer between sharpenings.\n* Do you use your knife to scoop up cut foods from the board (dragging edge on surface).\n* Whats your tolerance for less sharp knives?  Pros need and enthusiasts always want their knives as sharp as possible.  Counterintuitively, sharper knives are less accident prone.  But also, sharper knives means less work is applied to cutting.\n\nLastly, if your knives to last longer, dont use electric sharpeners.  They take off too much metal.  If thats all you got, it is what it is.  But if you can take them to reputable knife sharpener or learn to sharpen your own, that'll help your knives last much much longer.", "I do main chefs and cleaver type knives every two months or so, however always give them a quick hit on the steel prior to each use. Mainly because I like the action and sound so much!", "Sharpen? Maybe monthly. Hone? Every time I get it out of the block.", "I've found regular honing to do the job well enough, and that'll be the way I keep things, at least until I buy a replacement strop for my belt grinder.", "FYI, electric sharpeners don't really sharpen your knife. You know those late night commercials where they sell Cutco knifes that have \"eversharp\" edges, and they're using them to cut cans and stuff? Those are super hard, very durable metal with serrations cut into the edge such that they act more as a saw than a blade. That's how they cut, they rely on you sawing back and forth, which is different from how a smooth edged blade works.\n\nWhen you use an electric sharpener, you are essentially putting milli-serrations on your knife edge, and it behaves the same way, just at a smaller scale. This isn't the best. A lot of people do it, and they're happy with it, and that's fine, but if you get used to an actual sharp blade it only seems subtle at first.\n\nThe problem is that it's more difficult to get a good cutting edge on a blade. It's not that hard to get a knife really sharp, and some sharpening systems make this part dead simple. Even with a simple whetstone and a little practice putting sharpie on the bevel, you can get very good at sharpening by hand (the way most chefs do it).\n\nThe problem is, this kind of edge doesn't maintain very long, even for really good quality knives, and the reason isn't the knife. No matter what system they use, 99% of non-pros (as well as a decent percentage of pros) don't fully remove the burr from their knife when they're done sharpening it.\n\nIf you learn to sharpen your knife AND you master fully removing the burr, you will have an incredibly sharp edge that lasts and lasts and lasts. A good knife will even maintain a sharp edge that passes the paper test even after a fair amount of rough usage. If the edge is well-supported by the bevel, it's actually not that easy to dull it.\n\nI learned all of this from the [OUTDOORS55 channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OUTDOORS55/videos), give it a look. Even with a relatively cheap knife, if you know how to put a solid edge on, it will outperform most people's super fancy Japanese knives.", "Butcher here.

This gets used for meat in your typical meat display packaging at the store (like the kind with plastic wrap on a styrofoam tray).  A lot of times if you lift up the top piece of meat, you'll see the meat under it has a grey-er color.  This is because these pieces didn't get sprayed.

It's weird, I know, but we built several grocery stores in the past and a couple different butchers told me this.\n\nSo, in your case, you could be looking at a piece of meat which wasn't on the top most part of the packaging, or just a piece of meat which has been exposed to oxygen.", "Exposed to air and bacteria after opening the seal I would assume.

The last two I know are pricier but I do like that fuzzy logic, and options for different types of rice. I do make sushi from time to time, but hate doing it in pot on the stove.  I eat enough rice with meals that I can justify spending like $60-80 on a good rice cooker, But how much of a difference is there between them all. I do also like the thought of cooking all in one pot too.

Don't bother with the breakfast/lunch option, it was dumb and not very helpful. Also, it was easy to cancel.

Leave a bit of wiggle room for things I didn't know about when I made the menu.  And the only stuff bought at the grocery is the actual stuff needed for those meals.  I'm always confused by the people that talk about making dinner out of whatever they have left in the fridge.  I don't have anything left in my fridge, it all has a purpose.\n\nNew recipes get found by ingredient or by region if I get inspired by something.  Last year was Mediterranean with a hint of African, this year so far I've discovered Mexican.  I just search the web in general.  When I find something I like I generally see what else that site has to offer.\n\nAs for picking something each night, I just flip through my recipe book until something sounds yummy.

I\u2019m not going to braise something for 3-4 hours in the height of summer. \n\nI also try to consider my schedule for the week, if the meals can use similar ingredients (if one dish calls for two stalks of celery, I try to make one or two other things that use celery), if leftovers from one meal can make another (if I make carnitas one day, I might use leftovers for nachos the next), and what we\u2019ve had recently. \n\nI really like Serious Eats, Smitten Kitchen, America\u2019s Test Kitchen, Alton Brown, Nigella Lawson, and Binging With Babish.

I try to keep in mind anything that didn't get used the week before and seasonality is important. For instance, I ended up not making an entire dish this past week so I will make it tomorrow, which means one less meal to plan and shop for this week. \n\nAs much as I love cooking, I don't have the energy to do it every day so I make meals that feed 4-6 that provide ample leftovers. Cook once, eat twice (or more than twice!) The most frustrating thing is actually doing the shopping. Sometimes the grocery store doesn't have something I need, so I either have to think of a substitute (I don't always know like for like) or completely pivot, which is hard since I'm such a planner. Also the crowds on Sunday are terrible, but if I leave grocery shopping to a weekday, I simply will not go. \n\nI keep a deep archive of recipes that I go through every week for meal planning. Saving links used to be my go-to, but I when I discovered a beloved recipe had been removed from the website where I got it, I realized all my favorites are ephemeral if I don't literally hold onto them. So anytime I come across an interesting recipe, I copy the ingredients and instructions into the Notes app. Doing it this way allows me to keep notes about any changes or substitutions. Everything is tagged by type of meal, season, source, etc. I break things down into recipes I have made before and recipes I want to try. If I make something I don't like it gets deleted. \n\nFor me, cooking is about learning a skill and an art. I only want to gain knowledge from experts, people who know more than me. So trusted sources are integral. I mostly avoid recipes from rando food bloggers because at best, they have the same knowledge I do. That means I stick to big media food sources (America's Test Kitchen, Bon App, Food & Wine, Serious Eats, NYTC.) But I also get food inspo from tv and youtube (from noted chefs and media channels.)\n\nHope that is helpful, good luck on your culinary journey :)", "On Sunday afternoon I pull out of the freezer a selection of protein options and make a mental note of what sides and vegetables I have on hand. By the time Monday afternoon rolls around I will choose a protein based on how quickly I expect it to go off. Then I choose a starch such as pasta, potatoes, or rice. Then I choose a side and ethnicity of the meal.

I picked up a VERY comprehensive AND TESTED ingredient substitution book called \"The Substitution Bible\" from the library - it changed how I think about food. Now when I look at one ingredient, I see I actually could have at least 3! Or 6!\n\nI also prep all my ingredients before-hand, so whatever texture/flavor/meal im in the mood for, i make. and usually it sparks new ideas of what to make! When I'm not in the mood to spend a lot time prepping ingredients, I get canned or sometimes food pouches.\n\nCooking tools I use: I CANNOT RECOMMEND THE PAPRIKA RECIPE MANAGER APP ENOUGH. OMG. Its everything you could want in a recipe app. I will buying a license soon for sure.\n\nLast meal I cooked: \"\"Deconstructed\" enchilada! I blended up some black beans I cooked in my pressure cooker until soft (so good), opened up some green enchilada sauce in a can and covered it in tahjin spider blend.

You should get a aluminum cookie sheet 18\" X 13\". Aluminum because it is much easier to clean and stays nice looking longer.

You will also need a turner for flipping eggs or meat in your skillet. You also need a food thermometer. Go with an electric one with a probe as they are much easier to use and keep in good working order.\n\nNow for storage of cooked foods you will need some sort of storage containers good ones are usually either glass with lids or heavier plastic ones as they will last longer. You can go with cheaper gladware containers if  you don't have the money for the high end stuff. They are very affordable and on drawbacks are they get stained easily but will come clean if you work at it. And they will wear out and will occasionally crack.  If you are going to do meal prep get sturdy containers as they will wear well and survive the cold and heating in microwaves.\n\nI would suggest one appliance. An immersion blender combination chopper. This will allow you to mix both dry and wet elements and with the chopper element you switch off the blender head and attach to the lid which has an adapter that will meld into the stem of the chopping blade inside the container.  You can also use the chopper to  deal down spices from whole to powders.\n\nYou should invest in some basic spices and seasonings. Cumin, thyme, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, Italian seasoning, oregano, and if course salt and pepper. Before buying a lot of spices learn about them and what they are used for. There are things on Pinterest that have lusting of spices and their uses. \n\nIf you want a cheap program for collecting and storing your recipes I would suggest \"Copy Me That\".\nYou can manually enter a recipe and then take a picture of you creation to add to the recipe. It also allows you to copy recipes from websites automatically. It allows you to group them into categories for easier searching.. it is free unless you want to pay for premium features.\n\nAnother good app is a grocery list app called \"Our Groceries\". You can make lists on your phone and add pictures of the exact item you want. Cause this anywhere you are to add to your list and as you get the item you swipe it right and it takes that item off your list.\n\nThat is enough for the next week or so.

No need to nuke everything on the highest. Heat control is so important. Even my microwave experience improved when i realized i can just turn it down\n\nHonestly i never had problems with cooking onions and garlic together, onions have enough juice to keep both for burning. You can also just add some water, it evaporates anyway\n\nBut seriously, i would actively need to try to actually burn garlic these days", "No. Allow the onions MUCH more time to cook and throw the garlic in when you are pretty much happy with how much the onions have cooked (personally, I like them pretty caramelized so it takes time). Depending on how high your heat is, Garlic is done in 30-90 sec - the key is to watch your heat", "I turn the heat lower and add the onions to cook and then when they are close to being done, I\u2019ll add the garlic so it becomes fragrant by the time the onions are finished cooking.", "That's a good question. The short answer is that the garlic will cook quickly, but it won't burn instantly. You have a window of time to work with. Also, you can bring down the skillet temperature a little bit if you want, and thus extend the time the garlic has before burning, by adding something else to the pan at the same time, like a pad of butter or a bit of wine, lemon juice, etc. Acidic liquids will also help with deglazing! Some leafy greens will also do the trick. Turning down the heat on the skillet (or turning it off completely if need be) will also help, of course.\n\nUsually, when a meat has finished cooking, if it was cooked properly and taken out of the skillet at the correct time, the actual temperature in the skillet when you take it out is not that high. It's more of a medium to medium-high. That's much more forgiving! Generally, you want to turn down the temperature on the stove as meat cooks and the skillet gets back up to its optimal frying temperature after recovering from the cold bomb of the raw meat. This will not only help the meat finish properly, but will help the garlic be able to cook for longer without burning when the time comes to add it in.\n\nBurning isn't actually a function of the temperature of the heat source. It's a function of the starting temperature, heat capacity, mass, and thermal conductivity of the thing being burned. This is why you can stick your hand in a 400 degree oven for a few seconds and be fine, or go outside in the snow in your underwear and be comfortable for a minute or two if you've soaked in a hot tub first and are really hot. The thing being burned (the garlic in this case) has to first pass through all of the non-burning temperatures in order to begin the burning process. Chopped garlic is small, so it has a low mass, so it will definitely burn quickly compared to something chopped coarsely, like big pieces of onion. But it has a lot of water in it, and thus a high heat capacity (i.e. water heats up slowly), so even if the garlic is chopped small it won't heat up as fast as a dry ingredient.\n\nOne more thing: The garlic may _look_ like it is burning instantly, by turning dark brown, but it's not. That's just the garlic picking up the bits of fond from the skillet.", "Gas stoves are wonderful, they react immediately.\u00a0\nNow I only habe an electric stove and have to wait for the pan to cool down a bit", "Lower the heat.

I\u2019m constantly stirring as well", "Turn down the heat. Garlic burns faster than the onion does. If burnt it can taste bitter.", "I usually add the garlic at the very end. Or at the very least after the onions.", "I always cook my onions first in olive oil then add the garlic, then cook the beef once the onions are cooked a little and just starting to brown.", "Low and slow, onions go in first, few minutes on their own, then add garlic,  also don't forget salt (I remember reading, it might be wrong,  that salt can inhibit burning).", "Here's what I do (electric coil): Turn it down, lift it (or slide it off) for a minute, add the garlic, stir constantly until it drops a bit. Sometimes even that doesn't work for me (i.e. I put it in too soon, lol), but I keep a spray bottle of water next to the stove, so if it's going too fast I spray a little water on it, which generally keeps it from burning. If the dish includes a quantity of something else (say a chopped onion, for example), I'll add that first, and add the garlic 30-ish seconds later.", "Drop the heat a bit, and add the onions first, which you usually have way more of.  That will cool the oil a fair bit. When they get sizzling, adjust the heat, and add the garlic.", "Garlic goes last and only for less than a minute  when you smell the garlic it's done, add your next ingredient after that or remove from pan or heat", "I have a stove that has a really slow esponse time to changing the heat (e.g., if I have it on medium high and turn it down to medium it can take minutes to cool down perceptibly). Because of this, what I do is anytime I need to cool things down to add a delicate item like garlic, I turn the element down, move the pan onto the counter for 2-3 seconds and then put the pan back on. Heat leaves the pan super rapidly when it contacts something room temperature, so just a couple seconds on the counter will cool it down enough. Essentially you're replicating putting enough of a new ingredient in to cool the pan down, but the problem is with garlic, it burns so easily that it can't sap enough heat out of the pan quickly enough before burning. Usually onions are a bit hardier--in my experience if you add an entire onion at once and cook it for a bit (necessary since onions take longer to cook anyway), it'll cool the pan down enough for garlic without this on-off process.\n\nThe on-off strategy works especially well if you have stone counters, which have a higher heat capacity than other materials. You may need only half a second or so, more than that and you suddenly have a pan too cold to cook anything. If you have counters that might scorch easily, I've gotten similarly effective results from laying a towel out on the counter or using a trivet.", "Sounds like you\u2019re cooking hot in a good thick pan. Just reduce the heat a little before you take the meat off", "It could be that you'd want to keep a large amount of drippings (relative to the amount of garlic) quite hot as you added the garlic.  It'd be quite unusual, but not unheard of.\n\nIn general, you should let the drippings cool to somewhere near to the temperature where you'd normally start cooking the garlic if you were using ordinary oil.  The drippings aren't supposed to cook especially intensely, they're instead supposed to infuse extra flavor while they cook relatively normally.", "lower the heat. add the onion first. once reduced and caramelized then add the garlic", "They ABSOLUTELY should not be added at the same time!\n\nOnions can take the medium heat since they have a ton of water in them but garlic has almost no water and a ton of oil that will burn quickly.

Once the onions are 90% done,  add the garlic for 1 additional minute until it\u2019s fragrant but not burnt.", "You should saut\u00e9 onions until nearly done and add garlic at the last 30 secs - 1 minute.", "Turn heat down, optionally cool the pan with water/stock/cold butter or cold fat, onions first - if you want them more than just translucent, add garlic only after onions are translucent.", "I cooked garlic in Butterfat  for a garlic noodle recipe today for 7 minutes. \n\nMedium-low and make sure there's enough fat, also make sure you stir it every minute or so.

This came after only a month or so of cooking, and was... frustrating to say the least. A few commenters scolded me for pushing her too hard, which she got a giggle at (for you see, it is I who is being tugged along in this escipade, and I have actually tried to pull her back to the basics many times). \n\nHer knife was dull, which made cubing the pork a nightmare. Her pie crust set incorrectly because the recipe was vague and annoying. The book told her itd take an hour and a half, but didnt account for prep work (ingredients listed called for everything to be pre-chopped), and she was in the kitchen for over 6hrs trying to make it work.\n\nI sat and watched the whole ordeal, and made myself busy by posting here to chat with others about her progress, and get some tips. She ended up giving up at around 3 in the morning, when her crust was clearly crumbled beyond repair. We had a small cry to let out some frustrations, talked it through, and made pasta instead.\n\nToday, however, she woke up with an unmatched vengeance. This woman is an unstoppable force. I, and many others in the comments, believed these pies to be far outside her skill set (and they are!) but today we marched our way over to the mall, dropped the bucks on a brand-new chefs knife, and griped about these damn pies.\n\nThe filling from last night was kept, but the crust was recreated tonight, as well as the quails eggs. Here, against all odds, are the pork pies that took 24 whole hours to create. They are misshapen lil devils with overcooked pork and uneven egg washes, and they are DELICIOUS.  \n\nIll never try to hold her back again, though she did promise to cool it on the complicated stuff from now on.\n\nThank you to everyone here who steered us in the right direction.

For fast warmup, cut portions while cold and warm each piece either on the counter or in your hands. Once filled, these buns don't really need to rise. They're ready for the steamer right away. I make small buns where at least 3 would fit in a basket steamer. To keep them from sticking, you can set them on small pieces of parchment.\n\nSome chopped water chestnuts are a good addition. Buy the canned sliced ones, drain well and hack them up a little smaller.\n\nBaked buns are a thing, but obviously they're a quite different texture. You would want to brush them with some oil before baking.

Your next step? Listen to some Europeans about how we use it. As an ex American myself, I get where you're coming from and I'll give you a couple of tips. \n\nFirst, try different European butters, you'll find your favorite and yes, you will go through it fast enough for it to be worth having different ones on hand. Second, have different types - standard inexpensive (if budget is a concern) American for cooking things, but a nice creamy *unsalted* European butter for tasting the butter itself. Beyond that, yes toast is great and warm melty butter on it is wonderful but what you guys call bread we here in Germany literally call \"toast\" or \"toast bread\" - get yourself a nice baguette, Kaiser roll, or otherwise crusty on the outside and fluffy but firm on the inside bread. Don't toast it, just eat it as is with a healthy layer of cold, good quality unsalted butter. I know in the US salted is standard, but there's a different flavor profile that comes up with unsalted and it'll give you more of a feel for what we eat here which, if I may say so, we eat for a reason - we've developed our combinations for hundreds of years over hundreds of millions of people. So, just a good quality bread with nice, cold butter is wonderful and then you can sprinkle some large grain salt on it, like sea salt or Himalayan pink or whatever other sort of salt. \n\nKick it up a notch though and try that good bread with butter *with a slice of cheese*. American deli style works, but try it with a nice or a European cheese, like Swiss or provolone even. *Kick it up another notch* and go for the classic French ham and cheese baguette, which is just sliced ham, a nice cheese, and butter. For best results, make the sandwich then wrap it and stick it in the fridge for an hour or two, then just chow. I can also tell you a simple slice of bologna (not Oscar Meyer... Get some wunderbar Bologna from the deli) on buttered (good) bread is delightful as well. \n\nStandard German breakfast (and dinner... It gets monotonous, I still often cook American) table spread is a basket of Br\u00f6tchen (crusty bread rolls, Google them), a plate with 2 or 3 kinds of cheese (maasdame, Tilsiter, Butterk\u00e4se, Gouda, if you want to Google for inspiration) 2 or 3 kinds of Wurstaufschnitt (sliced deli meats). We do a lot with bologna here, or what you would see as bologna, but we have a lot of different types like Mortadella with pistachio, Lyoner just on its own, Lyoner with paprika in it, Fleischwurst, too many to list but just to give you an idea. There's also a lot of ham, or the meats with different things in kind of a gelatin, or preserved meat like prosciutto. Then spreadable stuff like marmalade, Nutella, liverwurst, other spreadable meats, and then finally, butter. It's like a little breakfast buffet of cold cuts, and you do open faced sandwiches or rather, one half of your roll with butter and a cheese or a meat or a spread, making a multi ingredient sandwich is less common and that simplicity is the magic of it, you taste the butter and the topper and the bread better when you're not holding a 20 ingredient sandwich. Cheese really shines here with butter and it's not overpowering like eating alone nor a backstage guest like in a sandwich. Same principle for anything else you put on your bread. \n\nOh man, I remember when I first got here and the whole country was a buffet to me - I encourage you, friend, Google, read, get a pen pal, come to Europe, and try things this way. American food is great and as I said I often cook American, but European food is adding a whole other dimension to your culinary appreciation. Try to find ways to tease the majesty out of your ingredients through the simplicity of them - a cheese plate with bread and a little dish of olive oil, with grapes and melon and a bottle of wine, isn't just a romantic thing, it is beauty on the taste buds. \n\nEnjoy, and congratulations on your epiphany!", "I started reading and when I got to Kerrygold my first thought was \u2018what if he tasted salt crystal French butter\u2019.

If she asks to try something I let her, within reason. She got a minor burn on the toaster oven but nothing serious and it served as a reminder to be cautious (I had warned her, but..kids).\n\n\nAdmittedly it's a little stressful and takes way longer than if I just make it myself but it's totally worth it to see their faces when they succeed and try something they made themselves.

It's also not about quantity as much as it's about size and dispersion, because without that you're just gonna have some bits that are salty, some that are bland, and within that you may also end up with specific parts of one piece of lettuce being really salty. Use a fairly fine salt that will spread out nicely, then sprinkle it broadly over the greens in a large bowl. Then get in there and thoroughly toss the greens and whatever other veggies you're throwing in. After tossing, taste. Get brave, add some black pepper if it's not quite there, especially with things like romaine or butter lettuce. Adjust til it's perfect, and (this is important) balance it against the dressing.

I will say in advance that I don't think any of these ideas are perfect replacements for pasta. I've cut most traditional pasta for weight reasons, and have tried a lot of alternatives. \n\nDo you like pasta for the noodles or for the sauce? The first two ideas I have here are better if you like the noodles, the rest are more for sauce delivery vehicles that are kind of pasta-ish. \n\nI've heard that carbe diem pasta is supposed to be good, but I don't know if it would work for diabetics. I've heard the flavor and texture are pretty awesome for an alternative pasta, but I don't know much about it. \n\nChickpea pasta would be much higher fiber, so a bit better for diabetics than normal pasta, but still not something you could have on a regular basis, I am guessing. Texture/flavor are okay as long as you don't cook too long. (4 minutes is about right for the one I use)\n\nIf pasta is just a sauce delivery system (my opinion), you could try some non-pasta options. Spaghetti squash is an interesting one. Texture and flavor are rather different from pasta, and it's not my favorite, but it's easy to find in stores and not super expensive. Heart of palm pasta is a bit better texture, IMHO, and doesn't have much flavor on its own. It is a bit harder to find in stores and a bit more expensive. If you are willing to buy a spiralizer, you can make pasta out of other vegetables, too. Butternut squash pasta is pretty good. Every recipe I've seen for zucchini noodles says to cook them, but if you cook them, they turn to mush. If you just use them raw and add them to the hot sauce, I think they are passable. \n\nIf you like Asian noodles, you could try shirataki noodles. They are a bit \"controversial\" because some people love them and others hate them. I think they are similar in texture to rice noodles. They are practically no calories/carbs, *BUT* do NOT start out with a large serving the first time you try them. They are almost entirely indigestible fiber, so they will go through you. If you are used to having very large fiber loads, that may not be a problem for you. Some people find that their GI system doesn't like them at all. Other people don't have issues from them. If you want to try these, I recommend trying to find the ones that are shelf stable. The ones sold refrigerated smell funky to me until they are rinsed and cooked. The shelf stable ones dont bother me at all. I know my Kroger affiliate sells both -- the refrigerated ones near the tofu, and the shelf stable ones in the pasta aisle. \n\nAgain, I know this isn't what you are asking for, but maybe it at least gives some ideas...", "Try getting whole wheat, brown rice or chickpea pasta for whatever recipe you land on.

Some lessons just have to be learned by making mistakes - and everyone makes them. The important part is learning from them instead of getting discouraged by them.\n\nIt sounds like she's trying to cook off the cuff as well, I'd also encourage her to follow well-written recipes, at least for the first time. After the first time, encourage her to make adjustments of her own and make that dish hers. Cooking something off the cuff is always going to be tricky for someone who doesn't have the building blocks from cooking hundreds or thousands of other dishes.", "A lot of people take years to learn how to cook. If she really wants to learn fast, maybe sign her up for a class at a local culinary school.", "I was taught how to cook by mom, who worked in a professional kitchen when she was younger. One of the first things she told me is that cooking is a journey, and you have to be willing to put in time, effort, sweat, and tears if you want to be an amazing cook. The other thing she told me is that it's a skill. Like any other skill, if you want to be good, you have to practice a lot and often. Be prepared not to be great at it for a while. It sucks, sure, but when you do finally nail it, it's an amazing feeling.\n\nTips that have helped me over the years:\n\n 1. Practice mindfulness when you're cooking, especially when you're learning something new. That helps you see what went right so you can recreate it later and also what went wrong so you can avoid it. Adding on to this, learn organization techniques and time management. They're so important when it comes to cooking.\n\n 2. Learn food science! If you understand your ingredients and how they're affected using different techniques, you can use them more effectively. Learning how things work allows me to be flexible when things don't go according to plan as they tend to do when you cook under the influence of ADHD lol\n\n 3. Get to know your knives. Learn what materials are used for knives. This will help when it comes to picking out quality knives. Learn what they're meant for. Some knives are just better at certain tasks than others. Either learn how to or find someone who can sharpen them. It's soooo much harder to learn how to properly use a knife when it's not in good shape. On the same note, learn about your pots and pans. They're not all created equal.\n\n 4. Practice, practice, practice, and laugh a little when things come out less than perfect. I straight up served my mom undercooked eggs when I started cooking. I was embarrassed at the time, but it became something that we joked about later on. Also, most people I've cooked less than stellar food for were just happy to eat something homemade that they didn't cook themselves.\n\nDon't give up! It's a challenging journey, but it's so rewarding to be able to feed yourself and your loved ones a nice meal. Meal times are sacred and a vital part of maintaining culture and community. Because of this, I have a massive amount of respect for the person who cooked whatever meal is on the table. Regardless of whether it is perfect or not. Give yourself some grace and a pat on the back. Learning how to cook is not easy, so I enjoy knowing that there are others willing to dive into it.", "When I first got married the only things I knew how to cook were Tv dinners, frozen pizza and egg sandwiches.  A friend got us a Betty Crocker cook book as a wedding present, it helped because it even told me how to make iced tea.  Our first Thanksgiving I tried to make a turkey, thawed it in the fridge for 2 days. It was still frozen solid Thanksgiving morning.  I didn\u2019t know they put plastic inside the cavity with giblets and stuff so I just buttered and seasoned the outside figuring it would thaw as it cooked.  It ended up tasting like dried out melted plastic!  My husband stuck with me even if I was a horrendous cook, 41 years after that first turkey and I am still learning new things around the kitchen.   \n\nYou will be able to get it, It really just takes time and playing around with it. Watching people cook on the food network and you tube really upped my skills.  Try to have fun with it and give yourself a break.  No matter how things turn out at first they were made with love so how they taste really doesn\u2019t matter in the long run!", "Your anecdotes imply two different sets of challenges. \n\n1) is knowledge. \nThe how and why's of steps in the recipe. \nDifferent people learn and absorb info differently. \n\nYour example of this was omitting yeast in a dough. \nUnderstanding what is hydration why it matters, how it matters, how to feed your yeast etc all of this is like classroom learning. \nIt helps to be more structured in learning rather than jumping straight in and hoping for the best. \n\n2) The second example in your anecdote is skills. \nEveryone was slow at prep work. \nThis stuff is easier to learn it just comes with repetition and dealing with those ingredients more regularly. \n\nThe key here is slow is smooth and smooth is fast.\nFocus on doing good cuts not on speed. \n\nremember you guys are cooking as a hobby not as a vocation. \nYour paycheque isn't at risk. \n\nEnjoy the journey, distract yourselves with parallel education, things like how did this recipe evolve over time, its history, how it was presented. \n\nI find it helps to get some skin in the game (in terms of interest and knowledge) vs treating cooking a recipe as some masterchef challenge. \nIt removes some of the anxiety of getting it right the first time. \n\nAnd lastly but not least. ALWAYS celebrate the little wins. \nDid the final dish not turn out to expectation?  Ok then review the process and look at what she did well and those are the new skills learned which should be celebrated,  the rest can be improved over cooking that recipe again and again.", "A few classic cooking shows of things you both love to eat so she can get the visual and the actual amount of time necessary", "I first learned to cook while working outside the comfort of my country. I have to earn a living for my kid, but still, I shouldn't starve myself. Despite my mom giving me instructions and remembering how she does it while I'm at home, I find it challenging to get it right. I have no one with me to guide me properly except YouTube videos. I looked for simple and easy-to-follow clips with quick tips and rationale on the side. Also, I kept watching various videos for one dish. This way, I can fully understand the flow of cooking it and pick the most relatable for me. \n\nI started cooking the basic fried fish, sunny-side-up, and scrambled eggs, and felt a little confident when they turned out good and tasted edible, haha. Then, I attempted different recipes, like chicken curry, sweet and sour meatballs, beef broccoli, and more. Afterwards, I started whipping out anything I had in the fridge. \n\nToday, I'm more confident as I am the official chef in our household. Your wife will get a hold of it, little by little. Most importantly, it's not a must to follow every step in a recipe. Still, it depends on the taste preference of those who will eat.", "Sounds like your wife really wants to run a french restaurant in no time and this wasn't even her own plan to begin with. I'd tell her she's doing ok. If a recipe calls for chopping veggies it's up to her to decide if cubes or triangles or trapezoids or whatever shape she feels like that day. Usually if it fits on the spoon or the fork it's good to go and use. Take it easy. With so many things in life it's easier if you don't take yourself too seriously. She can do it", "I learned so much from the old Good Eats episodes by Alton Brown. He explains the science behind the methods in a comical way. The concepts are usually pretty simple and he considers himself a good cook rather than a chef so it's all down to earth cooking and baking.", "She just needs more experience. She needs to cook all the time, she needs encouragement but she also needs to discover and learn through failure. Give her space honesty and encourage research. Find good recipes written by experienced chefs that know how to write good recipes, have an open mind. The small wins will come. Chef John (food wishes) on YouTube has some fantastic recipes for everyone, his teaching style and recipes are efficient and fantastic. Good luck!", "Sometimes people like to find things out by themselves?\nSpeaking for myself, I don\u2019t really like it when someone is watching me do things, unless I\u2019ve asked them to.\nPerhaps you could suggest that they watch some online tutorials on knife skills? (In leisure time, not when the pressure to produce a meal is on?)\nMaybe help by making sure that the knife is sharp?", "Maybe a book on techniques for beginners with lots of pics might help.

Honestly it sounds like she's getting way too complicated too fast - is she subconsciously trying to keep up with your parents? Maybe try some of those \"just 5 ingredients\" type recipes. Even the most excellent home cooks don't make a full Thanksgiving dinner every night!\n\nEven though it's boring, make the same thing once a week until she's got it down really well. That's a good education in how making small changes affects results. And over time it gives her a repertoire of things she can make almost without thinking, leaving more energy to try new stuff.\n\nYou didn't mention this but another difficult thing, especially if she has trouble with distractions or multitasking, is making too many dishes at once. It's just fine to make salad or coleslaw way ahead, toss in a microwave in bag veggie, and give full attention to a single protein/carb dish rather than try to make a fancy vegetable dish plus homemade vinaigrette all while doing a meat and elaborate potatoes.\n\nDitch the crappy random recipes from the internet. If you must use online, go to ones like ATK or seriouseats. Or get a quality all purpose cookbook like Joy of Cooking. There are also books that are more science-focused if she'd like that. I just got Ratios by Ruhlman, looks promising. Master Recipes and the McGee book are along the same lines.", "Sometimes it's not a good idea for one spouse to teach the other spouse how to drive. Have you considered taking a beginner class together so she can see when a  slightly more relaxed approach might be appropriate?

Whether that takes the form of a youtube video or you guiding her by hand, the practice needs to be right for the skills to develop. Doing it wrong for 2 years is as bad as not practicing at all. \n\nShe will get there eventually.", "As someone that has \"inherited\" some skills with a certain hobby (not cooking) and moved far away from my familial  \"teachers\" and sought out other professional training as a youngster and young adult, then continued to teach this skill to others for over 4 decades....  all I have to say is - *** it's really hard to teach family.***\n\nKnowing how to do something and relaying that skill to people close to you in an encouraging way can easily fall on deaf (self defeating) ears.  Even you're own children.  Unless you're a whiz at intrapersonal skills and that's an accepted part of your relationship (the teacher, the guide, but even so, that calling isnt going to work for everything), it's prob not gonna work out great.  \n\nPersonal relationships are full of setting boundaries and giving criticism as well as accepting criticism (in sum).  \n\nSo like the last thing in life a person needs, is another person close to them trying to tell them how to do something right (or how they did it wrong), again, there are probably other fronts with family and work where they already feel overwhelmed.  \n\nIf you want your spouse to learn what you already know (are you getting the imbalance in this statement?), and they WANT to learn, then I suggest a basic cooking class for starters or some video suggestions...  and just step back and see where it goes... stay out of it...\n\nAfter they get some guidance from an impersonal source and they start to learn the language, then they may be more accepting of more familial help.  \n\nDicing onions and baking are 2 totally unrelated skills!  You should never expect a totally novice cook to be able to do either, much less both simultaneously with ease!!!  \n\nAnd you're talking about \"dough rising\" and professionally dicing onions in 6 weeks time here???  All under the guidance of YOU....\n\nThink about this.\n\n Do they even WANT to cook, or just trying to make you happy?  \n\nI was lucky, I learned how to use a knife somewhat from a beginning culinary student as his teacher recently explained to him that month in a short lesson.

I let the roux bake a bit longer, I prefer a slightly darker, almost-but-not-quite chocolate colored roux.  Use half salt, half soy sauce instead of just salt.  \n\nOther things to consider include choice of sausage.  Some andouille sausage is very spicy, some isn\u2019t.  If I\u2019m cooking for guests and I don\u2019t know their heat tolerance, I\u2019ll substitute a nice smoked kielbasa and go easy on the cayenne.  Do NOT omit the cayenne though, a little heat will usually go unnoticed, but the cayenne provides a key flavor component even if only in a smaller amount.  Also, if you prefer okra, fine, but do not \u201cdeslimify\u201d it.  It is bad form to use both okra and file powder though.  It\u2019s not a hard rule, but a real Cajun may give you the side eye if you do.  I prefer the file powder for the flavor, and because I dislike overly thick gumbo.  I love fried okra on the side though.\n\nFor fresh herbs, I usually throw in whatever is handy in addition to the thyme.

Maybe you can pick up an old used cookbook of his?", "You might post this question in r/CajunFood. \n\nI find making dark roux to be a complete PITA, so I usually just buy it in a jar. The Kroger close to me has a section for Cajun, Creole, and Caribbean products, and I buy it there. \n\nGumbo is a very simple recipe aside from the roux. People who live off the land typically used whatever meat was available, including squirrel, alligator, etc, but the general rule is not to mix seafood with animals that are on land (including gator, but people break this rule all the time). \n\nGenerally people do chicken and sausage or seafood gumbo. If you do chicken and sausage, brown those ingredients first. Usually chicken thighs are preferred. For seafood, you can add the raw shrimp, crawfish, crab, etc to the gumbo as it\u2019s cooking since those have faster cook times. \n\nBasically, just take the Cajun mirepoix (celery, onion, and bell pepper, and NOT CARROT, I\u2019m looking at you, Josh Weissman), brown it, add garlic (as much as you like, Cajun goes heavy on the garlic), then the roux, some chicken stock (or seafood stock if you\u2019re making seafood gumbo, though chicken stock is fine if you don\u2019t have seafood stock), maybe some beer, cook and stir till it comes together, then add the cooked chicken thighs cut into pieces and sliced sausage, or the raw seafood. Cook a little longer (until the seafood is done). Then either serve over rice, or with a scoop of rice put in the bowl on top of the gumbo.", "Gumbo is one of the easiest things to make.

You'll generally get better, longer use by handwashing your cookware\n\nI have a cast iron I use for high temp frying/searing, but I'm very happy with the Anolon cookware set we got from Macy's about a year ago.  The non stick works great, and stands up to my wife's abuse (she's pretty lazy about her cooking style and tools).  The shape took a bit of getting used to (they are deeper and less wide than I really like) but after about a year they still look and perform like new. I am in no way trying to claim they are the best, but I am happy with my purchase", "In a big fan of Tramontina.

I have the frying pan I mentioned, an Avacraft stainless large saucepan/pot that has a lid with water draining holes and measurements on the inside that was cheap, a cast iron pan I got at an antique store, an everyday pan that I need to replace because the nonstick is coming off, and a cheap Dutch oven that is new.\n\nI really like everyday pans.  Good for pasta or frying or one dish meals. I use it for most of my cooking. I'm planning on replacing mine with a higher quality one and I'd like a stock pot, but don't really need one.", "Good tools tend to cost more for whatever endeavor you pursue, cooking is no different. However, there are ways to save money by choosing and buying wisely. Forget buying at fancy retail stores and don't buy any crap advertised on a stupid TV ad or \"celebrity-endorsed\". \n\nNeither cast iron, stainless steel, or any other material is \"best\". They all have their pluses and minuses. Non-stick a must? IMO it makes sense to have one or two non-stick pans for eggs and such if you cook them frequently. It just makes life easier. \n\nDon't put any quality pan in a dishwasher even if they are \"dishwasher safe\". A good pan is not difficult to hand wash and that keeps it from being subjected to the potentially harsh ingredients of dishwasher cleaners. It will look better and last longer, especially non-stick PTFE. Cast iron or raw steel pans should NEVER go in a dishwasher. \n\nI own pans of several different types. There is no pan type that is \"best\" for all uses. Multi-ply stainless steel (having an aluminum core) is great for general purpose use giving you the smooth,hard surface of stainless combined with the better heat transfer of aluminum. Cast iron is affordable, traditional, and can last for generations. It is heavy and requires a bit of maintenance for best performance. Enameled cast iron is beautiful but expensive and heavy but it's great to have and I;m very fond of my Le Cruset Dutch Oven. \n\nFor stainless steel multi-layer pans All-Clad is a big name. Cuisinart and Tramontina also make good stuff that can often be less money. The All-Clad website (homeandcooksales.com) runs periodic sales on seconds at 40-50% savings. I've bought a number of pans through them and they've all been perfect. Other manufacturers may have something similar. Lodge is the best known brand of regular cast iron cookware. They also make enameled cast iron products that are less costly than the top of the line French names of Le Cruset and Staub. Basic aluminum and PTFE non-stick pans along with things like stockpots can be purchased very economically from restaurant supply stores. If you are in or close to any metropolitan area there will be some available to you. They are also a great place to buy basic kitchen tools from tongs, sheet pans, mixing bowls, thermometers, measuring cups, etc.", "Cast iron best for searing meat and cornbread. Not dishwasher-safe. Lodge is a good brand. Semi-non-stick. Will last for life is cared for.\n\nStainless is best for developing a fond for pan sauces & seeing if your butter is browning but not burning. Good shape for tossing a saut\u00e9. Maybe dishwasher-safe but I wouldn't. Semi-non-stick with a learning curve. Any fully-clad, tri-ply, aluminum-core brand will be at last decent. Will last for life if cared for.\n\nCarbon steel is a good general purpose compromise. Lighter than cast iron, more non-stick and cheaper than stainless. Requires some TLC; not dishwasher-safe. Most brands should be fine. Will last for life if cared for.\n\nI recommend you learn to do 99.9% of your cooking (maybe 100%) on one or more of the above.\n\nTrue non-stick (Teflon) is best (I consider it required) for eggs. Fragile, and short lived. Not dishwasher-safe. Whatever is cheap; you'll be throwing it away in a few years anyway.\n\nThis is controversial because other finishes have their fans, but I consider other non-stick finishes to be inferior to Teflon. Contrary to rumor, cooking on Teflon is perfectly safe if you keep it below about 450\u00b0F but it's manufacture is a potential source of toxic waste, so, there's that to consider. I have one small Teflon pan I use only for eggs and I baby it: no metal tools, gentle heat, gentle hand wash, not stacked with other pans... It's several years old and holding up well so far.", "Don't stress yourself out trying to get all your cookware in one go, or feeling like you need to buy the perfect 10-piece cookware set for all your cooking needs.  The cookware my household use for 80% of the cooking are:  (1) a 10\" stainless steel skillet with tall sides; (2) a 2.5 quart sauce pan, although I would love to replace it with a similarly sized saucier; and (3) a 5 quart enameled Dutch oven.  We have one non-stick skillet for making omelettes, but otherwise stick with cast iron, stainless steel, carbon steel, and enameled cast iron.  Tramontina, Cuisinart, and Lodge are relatively affordable and reliable brands.  We hand-wash our pots and pans, even if they claim to be dishwasher safe."]}

And I wanna grouse about it a little!! Prepared food is easier and less planning and OH MY GOD YOU HAVE TO CHEW SO MUCH WHEN YOU EAT NOTHING BUT SLIGHTLY-BETTER-FOR-YOU FOOD!!  I genuinely felt like all I did all day was chew when I changed to more fiber/more protein/less sugar and carbs. It\u2019s easier now that I\u2019m used to it. \n\nAlso, better fats are your friends!  I actually got a little sick of guacamole and hummus for like, one minute.  I was eating them on seeded crackers, veggies, nuts, all kinds of things.

Lite thousand island dressing (check the sugar), fresh lime squeezed, a dab of diet sour cream. BIIIIIIG salad, I love it.   You can skip the crumbles if you're too tired to deal with them.   You can also mix in a bunch of salsa if you like.   Chop in Jalapenos if you like spicy. \n\nI have taken to adding a large iceberg lettuce salad to every meal, also.  I usually dress it like this: lettuce, tomatoes (I mean, go to town, as much as you want!), then I add vegan blue cheese crumbles (I've had to cut back on meat & cheese bc of cholesterol, but bonus, they are so much lower in calories), I like Follow My Heart, but you can also use a teaspoon or two of regular blue cheese crumbles, then: a drizzle of a nice olive oil (treat yourself, it makes a difference), a bunch of balsamic vinegar (I like the Calolea brand of both), some fresh ground pepper.  This works for every meal.   \n\nInstead of the blue cheese, you can also do a can of tuna (in water, get a nice quality one, you'll be happier), and the oil-balsamic vinegar thing, it's delish, or a can of salmon.  I usually make one piece of sour dough toast because I have to have SOME CARBS but you could also nuke a small potato.  I use lite margarine on the toast.  \n\nCan you pick up a rotisserie chicken?  If you pick off the skin and kind of blot away the grease, it's a perfectly good meal, throw a salad together on the side, maybe a small potato in the oven. \n\nA potato can be very satisfying, too.  For a meal: a nice big russet, or two Yukon gold (Yummm), a bit of diet margarine, a bit of diet sour cream, a ton of chopped green onions or dried chives, you can add salsa if you like.  Nuke it in the microwave and there it is.  \n\nBaby steps are the BEST kind of steps.  Try to think about it as \"being kind to your body\" rather than anything else.  I had to really change my diet because my cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure were all getting way too high, and by framing it that way, and thinking of moving gently into new ways of eating.  \n\nhonestly, I found just cutting out red meat, whole fat dairy, and cutting way back on sugar really helped.   \n\nps I know they say \"oh it's just as bad\" but honestly if you're trying to eat fewer carbs it really helps: sugar free desserts.  I do sugar free chocolate pudding & sugar free vanilla pudding with sugar free Reddiwhip and it is so satisfying.  If you get the cups it's good portion control too.  Also See's candies makes great sugar-free chocolates, also Russell Stover.  Peanut butter powder is also a great add in.  Nonfat greek yogurt, berries, some regular oats (not quick-cooking) and sugar free maple syrup is GREAT and very filling. \n\nJoin us on r/loseit  and r/Volumeeating for a ton more tips!

My favorites to roast are Brussel sprouts (roast with garlic, toss in balsamic glaze), asparagus (toss in oil before, take out a couple mins early to sprinkle with parmesan cheese, continue to roast, and salt when done.)

I eat eggs and some dairy (I can\u2019t eat or drink most dairy as I am lactose intolerant). One of the things I do, is make sauces in bulk so that I can freeze the extra and then if my dinner is say pasta, I can just pull out the sauce and heat just enough for my dinner. Another one is make a bunch of homemade burritos and freeze them. I make mine with rice, refried beans, salsa, and pepper jack cheese or habanero cheese. I have one for my dinner, put one or two in the refrigerator, and the freeze the rest. You can then microwave them or take some kind of neutral oil like canola and brown up the outside in a pan as it heats up making essentially a chimichanga without needing to deep fry it. Or use your air fryer so that you need no oil. Your call. Of course you can add meat to any of these. If you are trying to get healthier and lose weight, (that is why I am a vegetarian) try using ground turkey or chicken instead. When I do occasionally allow myself to have some meat, I only eat chicken, turkey, or fish. All of these are low in fat and because they are less meaty tasting than say beef, they take on the taste of the char you put on them, and the taste of all the seasonings you use.

Start your carb.**  \nWhile the protein marinates, throw on some rice or your carb of choice. I love using a rice cooker\u2014set it and forget it.\n\n**3. Prep your veggies.**  \nUse fresh or frozen\u2014whatever\u2019s easiest and most appealing to you. I often saut\u00e9 zucchini, onions, and bell peppers, but frozen mixed veggies are a great time-saver too.\n\n**4. Cook the protein.**  \nStart heating your pan or preheat your air fryer. I use a small countertop oven/air fryer and cook the protein at 400\u00b0F for 10\u201315 minutes, flipping halfway through.  \nUse a thermometer if you\u2019re unsure\u2014nothing should take more than 20 minutes.\n\n**5. Cook the veggies.**  \nFinish cooking your vegetables however you prefer\u2014saut\u00e9, roast, steam\u2014whatever works for you.\n\n**6. Plate it up.**  \nFluff your rice, plate everything, and enjoy!  \n\nThis routine is all about using your time efficiently, keeping meals simple, and minimizing cleanup. It\u2019s always delicious and easy to repeat. Plus, I always make enough for dinner and lunch the next day.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this for 18 months now and swear by it.

{"title": "Fermented bean paste is criminally underrated (outside of Asia)", "selftext": "It goes without saying that the cuisines of East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, etc) are popular, and while such staple ingredients as Soy sauce, tofu, noodles, or sesame oil have long since gone mainstream, with soy sauce now as common a condiment in most homes as ketchup or mustard.\n\nBut one very common ingredient in all these cuisines I think remains tragically misunderstood and underused:fermented bean paste. Soy sauce's more pungent and muscular cousin, fermented bean paste packs a wallop of umami and flavour in very small quantities, and being fermented from beans, it's also healthy and nutritious. Just a tablespoon of the stuff is enough to completely change and enrich the flavour profile of a dish.\n\nIf you're not sure what fermented bean paste is, I can assure you that you've had it before, from dishes as diverse as Chinese Mapo Tofu, twice cooked pork, Zhajiangmian, black bean sauce, Japanese miso soup or sukiyaki to Korean doenjang jjigae. It's flavour is similar to soy sauce but more pungent and complex. \n\nFermented bean paste is highly flavourful, and very error tolerant (it's very difficult to undercook or overcook it), so it can easily be used in a wide variety of dishes (try adding some to a curry!).\n\nThere are hundreds of different kinds used in different regions, these are my favourites:\n\nPixian chili bean paste(doubanjiang): probably my favourite, made from broadbeans rather than soy, has a very complex earthy taste. A big part of the signature taste of sichuan food. Don't make the mistake of making Sichuan food with Cantonese chili bean paste (much less complex flavour).\n\nYellow bean paste: Sweeter and less complex, very smooth. Good for making chili bean paste sauces a bit less strong.\n\nFermented black beans: not technically a paste, but chopped up and fried has a similar function. If you've ever wondered where the signature flavour of black bean sauce comes from, this is it. Using these, it's not difficult to make a superior black bean sauce to what you get in most cheap restaurants. \n\nKorean/Japanese miso paste: in practice I find the difference between these 2 to be so small as to be indistinguishable. Very good in stews or soups, especially with beef. If you want to make Korean or Japanese food, have this stuff on hand. \n\nThese are just 5 of the most common. Please chime in if you're a fellow devotee!
