I gathered that Jiro entertains some of the most important people in Japan (it is said Shinto Abe was a frequent guest and hence him bringing Obama on an official state visit).\n\nAll in - $460 I thought it was worth every penny.\n\n\nPS: the secret to his success, as he tells it, is his incredible relationships with fishermen and fisheries where he knows the fish are living in ideal conditions and well cared for. That\u2019s according to him. \n\nPSS: seems crazy but the best thing I ate there was a Japanese honey dew melon that he served at the end of our meal. OMG I still dream about that melon.

That's why I won't enter without recommendation from friends.", "There is a place of legend that my friends took me in Kokubunji. We walked aimlessly through some neighborhood I didn\u2019t know. Then we walked straight through some random persons house, walked through the little backyard thing into the back of another house with an obachan smoking a cigarette who just gave a shooting motion towards a set of stairs where we went up 2 floors into an attic which served the best tempura of my fucking life. 3 of us and we racked up a 3800usd bill w drinks. Only 1 group of customers allowed per day or something like that. Friends had reserved it for my trip over there. Friend is in the restaurant industry with a Michelin star and had the connect. Can\u2019t divulge who my friend, their restaurant, or the random attic I went to lol. Not trying to flex, just trying to illustrate some of the underground culinary Tokyo scene. \n\nIt\u2019s not the only random house I\u2019ve ended up at that was a secret food haven.

The price for their omakase is roughly 950 USD before any supplements for extra rare ingredients.\n\n600 USD is a tad on the high side but still within the expected price range.\n\nLet\u2019s remember that people freak out about sushi but it\u2019s also in essence rice balls with toppings, with an egg omelette and a slice of orange at the end. Same pricing structure.", "Wow!

Courtesy?

Third choice: walked in and was informed it was a prix fix $250 (thank goodness they told me!) Nope!!! Ended up in a very lack luster establishment but by then it was 8:45 pm and it was what it was.

When the veggies get some color, pour in your water, potatoes and reintroduce the meat.  Boil 15-20min or until the potatoes are cooked through.\n\nThrow in the boxed curry roux and add some dark chocolate or a spoonful of baking chocolate.  Don't worry, your curry won't end up tasting like a candy bar.  Some other additions I like are a small spoon of Worcestershire (for umami), dark soy(for umami and color), and ketchup(for a little tang that also adds sweetness).\n\nI've been making boxed curry roux like this for years and don't really bother going out for curry anymore.

It is easier to make the roux in large batches, so I would make enough for like 20+ servings. You can freeze it.

Otherwise, any Japanese curry rue can mimic the flavor of Coco Ichi\u2019s curry, particularly the Jawa Curry brand pictured above.\nThe addition of chutney to your sauce will bring the flavor closer to that of Coco Ichibanya. However, if you are unable to find it in your local store, it is not a necessary ingredient.\n\n\nInstructions\n1. Finely chop your onion and carrot. Most curry houses mince their vegetables to the point of being indistinguishable in the rue, a trait shared with Coco Ichi.\n2. Add the oil and onions to a pot on the stove. Toss in the squares of pork and cook on medium heat.\n3. Once your pork changes color, add the carrots and 1 cup of water. Simmer on low heat for 15-20 minutes. (Note: Take care that the heat is not too high, or your ingredients will burn and stick to the bottom of the pot.)\n4. When you vegetables have all become soft, add the remaining 3 cups of water and increase the heat on your stove to medium. This is more water than is seen at most curry restaurants, but it is necessary to bring out the smooth flavor found at Coco Ichi.\n5. Once the pot comes to the boil, skim the oil from the top and turn off the heat entirely. Break apart the blocks of rue and add them to the pot.\n6. After the rue has melted, stir in the Worcester sauce, chutney, and salt for additional flavor. This is important to achieving the same taste found at Coco Ichi.\n6. After the rue has melted, stir in the Worcester sauce, chutney, and salt for additional flavor. This is important to achieving the same taste found at Coco Ichi.\n\nPlease understand that this recipe is a fun project intended to help you bring the taste of Coco Ichibanya to your home kitchen. We put a lot of time and effort into perfecting the process, but with so many brands of rue and levels of spice out there, we encourage to experiment on your own and let us know if you discover any brand new secrets to recreating the taste of the real Coco Ichi! Just, don\u2019t forget to grab a glass of water before digging deep into your plate.\n\n\n\nTo make it more aromatic, I stir fry some sesame oil and garlic before starting the recipe. I also tried working in some more worcester sauce and a bit of sesame oil at the end as well. Instead of water, I use chicken stock (I don\u2019t make my own stock, I use knorr, which I think is common enough). I keep the heat on high for a few minutes after the roux is incorporated to let it reduce and thicken a little, then when I turned off the heat, I mix in garam masala, cayenne, and chinese black soy sauce. The result is pretty amazing.", "There are a few ways to simulate this at home and get a dark, rich flavour pretty close to the proper thing:\n\n* Heat up brown or dark brown sugar and caramelise it, just before it burns. Mix that into the curry for colour and a slight complex bitterness and sweetness\n* Dark soy sauce for seasoning and mainly colour\n* Generous amounts of coffee, dark choc, or cocoa powder for colour and savouriness. If using cocoa powder, bloom it in boiling water first.\n* Cooking together onion, carrot, ginger, garlic, curry powder and blending to form the base before adding water + roux. Browning the veggies improves the flavour and adds colour.\n* Using a strong curry roux, I like Java or S&B Extra Hot\n* Simmering for much longer time on a very low heat, just barely bubbling.

SMH.", "Curry is Indian. Indian curries are thickened with yogurt or cream (northern India) or coconut milk (southern India). There are maaany other differences too. It's also very regional - different places will use different spices, different proteins, etc. Also there's no such thing as \"curry\" in India - it just means \"sauce.\"\n\nIndian and Bangladesh immigrants brought curry over to Britain. It's typically a restaurant dish. It is most similar to northern Indian curries, in that it's thickened with cream. Further, they typically use a base-stock for all their dishes, which leads to much less variety in flavor. To fit the British palate, it's also typically less spicy.\n\nJapanese curry was brought by British sailors during the Meiji period. Other than the spices, it's not really similar to curries you'd find in India or Britain. It's thickened with a roux, which is not done anywhere except Japan. It's also typically way less spicy, and typically sweeter. Also typically you'd eat it with Japanese rice, whereas in India or Britain it would be eaten with either a different type of rice or naan.\n\nAmerica doesn't really have a curry culture. If you were to get a curry in America, it would most likely be Indian (or sometimes British).\n\nI'm not really sure what European curry is (European curry = \u6b27\u98a8\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc, I'm guessing). To me it looks like regular Japanese curry with some western ingredients (like wine, usually) included. I would personally say that while it is European-style, it's still Japanese curry.\n\nFinally, as to why it's popular here (on this subreddit), I think there's several reasons. It's easy to cook, and most of the ingredients are readily available. Also it's really good.", "Not sure what American or European curry is supposed to be but I\u2019ve noticed in America it\u2019s usually veggies and meat slathered in some curry sauce.

In no particular order:\n\n1: My first round of sushi from Uogashi Nihon-Ichi, a standing bar sushi restaurant on the west side of Shinjuku.\u00a0\n\n2. The 4 curry sampler from Wakakusa Curry in Nara. It was all delicious, but the hot brown lamb curry was my favourite.  \n  \n3. The deep-fried beef cutlet set from GYUKATSU KYOTO KATSUGYU . I opted for one of the higher end cuts, but not the most premium set.\u00a0  \n  \n4. A Beef and Matsutake Mushroom Sukiyaki self-heating bento box meal I picked up in Kyoto Station for my Shinkansen ride. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted.\u00a0\n\n5. Shrimp Tempura Soba and a Sparkling Sake on Miyajima Island. Looked very simple, but had a wonderful depth of flavour.\u00a0\n\n6. Coffee soft serve, also on Miyajima Island.\u00a0\n\n7. Pork Tonkatsu from Katsukura Tonkatsu Sanjo in Kyoto.\u00a0\n\n8. A Wagyu Smash Burger with the best, lightest onion rings I\u2019ve ever had, and a very crispy coke from Henry\u2019s Burger in Jiyugaoka.\n\n9. Level 5 Spiced Ramen from Afuri in Shinjuku.\u00a0\n\n10. Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki from the Okonomi Village in Hiroshima. I opted for one with extra green onions and a fried egg.\u00a0\n\n11. Beef Sukiyaki set from Yakinuku Like in Tokyo.\n\n12. Donald Duck Shrimp Bun from DisneySea - tender, flavourful and moist.\u00a0\n\n13. Green onion dumplings and lemon dumplings, with the best fried chicken of my trip, from Gyozayaryu\u00a0in Hiroshima. \n\n14. Margarita pizza from Seirinkan in Tokyo - oily, chewy, salty and fresh!\u00a0\n\n15. A raspberry fois gras sandwich, one of the 8 courses from my French omakase dinner at L\u2019as in Tokyo.\u00a0\n\n16. Spicy beef curry udon with potato foam from Shodai. So creamy and comforting.\u00a0\n\n17. Oyakodon set from Toriyoshi Shoten in Asakusa - so incredibly cheap too - the set with an alcoholic drink came to less than $10 Canadian.\n\n18. A momiji manju that I randomly bought from the cafe at the Peace Memorial Museum Cafe. Probably my favourite sweet that I had in all of Japan, wish I had purchased more of them!\n\n19. A shrimp tempura tendon set, with an extra fried egg from Tendon Makino Kyoto Teramachi. Once I was mostly finished with the tempura, the staff gave me some broth to pour over the rice and make it into a soup.\u00a0\n\n20. Hiroshima-style Tsukemen from Bakudana in Hiroshima - This cold, yet spicy local dipping noodle dish was so refreshing on a very hot afternoon.\u00a0\n\nAs you might be able to tell, I really enjoyed the food scene in Hiroshima!\u00a0", "Looks like you had quite the wonderful culinary experience!

To be clear: virtually all surumi currently available for purchase is in fact a product of modern food fabrication. But any kind of philosophical objection to surumi because the food fabrication is \"modern\" and therefore not \"traditional\" or even \"natural\" misunderstands what this food is. This \"traditional\" food was first cultivated in the 12th century. It is as \"traditional\" as almost anything else that is currently consumed. The fabrication was a way of preserving and extending the food sources available at the time. Humans have always sought ways to preserve and utilize food product is any manner they could use.

What's not to like?\n\nWould be awesome if they were widely available in the US but the typical quality of our eggs isn't up to JP standards. Plus Big Food would find ways to inject each sando with excess fat, sugar and preservatives; JP konbinis toss their unsold ready to eat food at end of day.", "These went quick even in the konbini in the countryside when I was in Japan, and it's been years. So I'm skeptical that it's because of the post-COVID boom in tourism. Which seems like an awfully convenient explanation for everything these days.\n\nThey're not my favorite sandos, I prefer katsu. But they're far better than the egg salad sandwiches usually served in the States, that use hard-boiled eggs with a powdery texture to the yolks. The ones in Japan, it seemed like the yolk was just right when the eggs were paired with the mayo, lending a lot more flavor to the mixture. Not runny, but a little jammy, a word I only hear from British people but that describes the texture perfectly.", "To the people of Japan, I sincerely apologize for the 318 Egg Salad Sandwiches I bought each day while visiting your marvelous country.", "This is so interesting to me! I first went to Japan and got addicted to these almost 20 years ago. There were definitely no egg sando influencers back then lol, and I have never seen anything by Anthony Bourdain, so I was certainly not \u201cinfluenced\u201d. I just love boiled eggs, so I gave them a try.\u00a0\n\nI still pay no attention to influencers or anything like that so this is the first I\u2019m hearing about this.

The soft bread is what I go to, and it doesn\u2019t have any crust.", "Because as a foreigner/tourists that first gets to Japan, you walk into a conbini and everything looks foreign. You can't read the signs, you see salads that won't get you full, some meals that you'd need a microwave for, some fried chicken but you don't know if you just grab it or have to talk to someone (hell no), etc. but then, close to the front where you're about to give up and starve comes the holy sandwich. A perfect, wrapped two-piece sandwich with just ingredients you're familiar with. It has bread, eggs, and what looks like Mayo - you know all of those! So you buy four because you're hungry and you don't know when the next opportunity to eat without having an awkward interaction with a stranger happens. \n\nOnce you open the sandwiches and take a first bite, you realize how wronged you were in the past about egg sandwiches. THIS is what an egg sandwich should taste like. The bread is fluffy like a cloud, the mayo is thick (you have never heard of Kewpie at this point), the eggs are the perfect texture. It's pure heaven and so this becomes part of your regular diet while in Japan. An easy snack in between, a quick breakfast as the hotel breakfast for some reason offers more fish than what you've ever eaten before, and just a feel-good moment in a store that has a trash-can, a clean bathroom and AC (summertime) to get away from the craziness of the city for just a short, sweet minute.", "We bought a lot of these when we were in Japan. For us it was simple, so much Japanese food has pork in it, or the labelling is obscure and you can\u2019t tell whether it has pork product added, eg gelatin. We don\u2019t eat any pork. So if we wanted a quick convenience snack or meal, we knew the egg sandwich was a safe and tasty option.", "Because of Anthony Bourdain.

At 3am while we were waiting for Ubers on the curb after the bar closed he ranted until the cars came about how Japan has no good sandwiches. And he was comparing Tokyo options to the Seattle area that also objectively has no good sandwiches. (Paseo is fine but also we know the Seattle food scene sucks at this point) \n\nBack in Japan currently and bought one of those white bread eggy bad boys anyway. \n\nHappy new year.", "I wanted to add too, I think 7-11 makes the best ones. I actually don't like the Family Mart ones that much, the Lawson ones are pretty good.\n\nI think the ones from Daily Yamazaki are good.

I slap it on some nice rye or sourdough.been eating it my whole life. \n\nThe stuff you can get in US convenience stores is not on the same level, like at all, compared to konbini.\n\nThe Konbini egg sandwiches are just great junk food (to me it's junk food, a better version of it). It's that damn pillow bread. It's like crack. And the tasty savry egg salad.  It's just a great combo. I'm salivating thinking about it right now, lol.\n\nAlso on a side note, for me, the first time I had seen the egg sandwiches getting hype was from Anthony Bourdain.\n\nI think it's all good that tourists are eating them and it's a highlight for them. They are delicious.\n\nSide note, Wanna give a shout out to gas station food down South in the US. There is some delicious stuff. I've had some great pork chop sandwiches, boudin, fried chicken, boiled peanuts, hand pies, cracklin, etc. Delicious.", "It's a very safe & affordable pick and it's different enough from their egg salad sandwiches with the use of JP mayo which has been popularized with Kewpie and JP milk bread with a bit of sweetness. \n\nWhat's to not love about it?", "I'd say it's because of two or three factors.\n\n* First and most important, it tastes freaking good! \n* Second, social media influencers who make videos about Konbini stores. \n* Third, weak yen.", "All this while karepan just sits quietly in the back.", "Probably all the youtubers & insta influencers who make vids about them.", "They taste good and quite frankly, they have the most visually beautiful and tasty version of something that is kind of a gamble from American convenience stores or gas stations.

This was one a day though - not sure how further are cleaning then out, unless there are insane waves of tourists since I've been there. \n\nI ate at regular restaurants for dinner, or for a late afternoon snack once I was done sightseeing.

So listen up with all ears or read it with those creepy dead fish round eyes open wide   LoL \ud83e\udd23  My English ain't perfect .so if you are trying to humiliate me with your personal prejudice or ignorances then this is the time for you to gets f outta here.  Yeah, You may leave.  and take those big round dead fish eyes with you..  Good.  Lmfao \ud83d\ude02 \n\nMake sure you wear clothes that is comfortable to wear and toss them into laundry after cooking.  So you can clean it.  Coz, the scents of curry would stays with your clothes all day all night  .so make sure to have good ventilations and wear comfortable clothes and aprons.  \n \n First , cut potatoes, carrots into dice. Not finely chopped dice. Just cut it in blocks.  Potatoes into quarters, about same size pieces on carrots as well.  One bite size is what you want.  \n Beef or chicken, pork meat should be cut same size.  Uniform size is the key . \n  \nChop Onions very very fine.  Chop garlic whatever the amount you like but it's nice to add it.  But you can just cut into quarters too.  It's depends on personal taste & style. I ain't forcing that one.  \n\nHeat up the pot empty.  Flick  the splash of waters out  from your wetted fingers and if its start to sliding around and dancing around on a bottom of the pot surface then it's ready to rock n roll . \n\nAdd adequate butter or vegetable oil into the pot. \n\n The meat . \n If it's beef then chose one for stew.  \n Hit many times with back of the chefs knife . This softens the meat into tender.  \n\n Then bit of salt & pepper. Just Tiny bit.\n Massage meat . \n  Bit of salt tenders meat then dehydrates then reabsorb moisture back into the meat.  \n\nThen put it into four bowl and coat meat with flour.  Spank the meat with other hand to drop off excess flour.\n \nThen meat in .  ( I learned this word  from watching Chef Gorden Ramsey shows \ud83d\ude4f . Huge Respect to him . He is an British. So obviously He speaks real English. So don't complain what I said . LoL \ud83e\udd23 ) \n\nCook it thoroughly sheer all sides of meat to seal the meat but just surface cooked or half way cooked is just fine because you gonna boil it with curry sauce anyway.  For ...at least an hour so all the kind of meat will be cooked perfectly including pork meat if you prefer.  \n\nPut meat on a side but leave the meat  juices in a pot.  It's Umami.  The flavor !  Leave it ! \n \n\nThen Start caramelizing Both garlic & chopped onions into using the same pot.  Use more butter or vegetable oil if you want. \n\n Regular vegetable oil is fine but I prefer butter . Salted butter but unsalted is fine.  \n Ghee is fine,  too.  \n\n You can cut onion into quarters too if you want it .but I like very fine chopped onions & chopped garlic for the taste.  \nCaramelize onions & garlic . Garlic tends to cook faster and gets burned  so it's better to toss it into it a bit later on . \n\n\nThen put adequate amounts of cubes from package . Follow the directions.  \n \n Then, after This is the secret.... The Key . \n \n Start to stir with caramelized onions & garlic with cubes of curry power . Break it with spatula, melt it with remaining meat juices , oils or butter.   \n\nThis sizzling stir actions with dried curry powder cubes gives and releases its flavors and powerful fragrance.\n  Kinda close to roasting but not that harsh treatment.  \nWhen you break it down with a spatula with heat then it becames like a paste then that's enough.  \n\n  Then  carrots and potatoes in . \n\n you'll feel good after that .  LoL \ud83e\udd23 \nAdd directed amount of water from the package . Add couple of Bay leaves on a top .  When you put this bay leaves you feel like real professional chef so just do it. LoL \ud83e\udd23 \n\n All the curry powder should be dissolved by now . Then put back the meat into the pot which  was kepted on a side.  \n\nBoiling for at least an hour.  During that you should prepare for rice. \n\n Any rice can be used since it is curry but this is \"Japanese style curry\"  so I'd use Koshihikari brand rice.  Imported from Japan Made in Japan .  Yes.  What about California rice ? Is that okay too ? Ok.  but not for me.  Sorry to say but it tastes bit slightly different to me . \n \nThe curry taste overwhelmes everything so who cares ! They says .    Well,  I do  care. Just like some dumb people thinks supermarket packaged cold Sushi is called Sushi !  \n Nah, not for me . Not for educated smart foodie people . \n They all agrees with me .  \n\n  \nMake sure to stir the bottom of curry stew pot occasionally so it won't burn the bottom of inside of the pot . This should be done medium low heat or low heat.  Make sure it's bubbling slightly & occasionally . Not an angry boil .  Be kind & gentle to your curry.  It's your food don't slap it . Be gentle and kind . LoL \ud83d\ude06 \n\nAfter hour or 2 hrs it's done. Keep  reducing till you feel the right consistency of roux in a pot.  but for the best taste I would transfer entire curry into Pyrex container and let it cool for a little while.  store it into refrigerator until next day.  Curry does needs to take a nap . LoL \n\nRemember , about around  30 degree Celsius  it means around 86 F ... the all the bacterias \ud83e\udda0 going to start to have a Rave parties in your food containers .\n  So, don't just leave it and keep it in room temperatures.  Chill it.  \n\nA day later ,  The whole taste becomes milder and rounder than just freshly made curry.  That's your shiny Gold bullion curry right In front of you ..   \n\n Scoop needed amount of curry from that  Pyrex container into the pot,  reheat it with very low heat . \n \nPut rice over the plate nicely flattened the pour it over the curry on a side . \n\n Now, you've just made truly an authentic Japanese style curry !!  Dig in .\n  You deserve it. \n\n \n\nI don't know but I learned this when I was about 3rd grade in elementary school hiking trip .  We cooked in out door using mess tin cooker over the bon fire. \n\nIt was a good time. ...  Remembering my youth....  Long lost friends and teachers who are already dead.    I guess I'm getting old. LoL \n\n Have a wonderful day \ud83d\ude0a \n\n PS.

I would remove those onions to a separate bowl, add more oil, then add whatever vege you want.

How many cubes you use depends on how much liquid is in there. So just adjust to your desired consistency and flavour, adding more stock or curry cubes, and taste taste taste. If it's too salty, add more stock. If it's not salty enough, but thick enough, add some more salt.", "Onions, Potatoes, Carrots, and chickpeas, I also enjoy blistered shishitos when in season for a little extra kick. \n\nAlso soft boiled eggs(gooey middle) \n\nOptional: added grated apple and/or ginger paste to add a little extra bitterness/sweetness.", "First time, follow the directions.\n\nDon't remember if it says this in the directions, but chop up the blocks and melt/dissolve them in hot water first, *then* pour the sauce into your vegetables to cook some more.

It's all personal preference.", "My go to vegetables for Japanese curry are spinach, onions, and eggplants. The eggplants I like to pan fry and use as a topping, as opposed to throwing it into the curry. On occasion, I'll throw in kabocha or carrots. \n\nLike others have said, try the box as is first and make adjustments to suit your preferences. There's all sorts of mix ins you can try, from grated onions, fruit purees, and even to pieces of chocolate, but you should see what you're working with first.

Cremia - in the wild! This was actually one of the last bites of my trip. I had it at the Osaka KIX airport before going through domestic security. I loved the cone, but the soft ice cream seemed weak and watery compared to some of the other soft serve I had.\n2. Tori Paitan from Bokkoshi Ramen in Osaka - Comfort in a bowl. This was rich and creamy, perfect for a cool, rainy night after a long day at USJ.\n3. The Kobe beef tender steak lunch - from Steakland Kobe. I\u2019m the first to admit, I\u2019m not a steak connoisseur, as I rarely eat beef in my \u2018real\u2019 life, but I found this a little tougher than I anticipated.\n4. I found an elusive (for October, when it was 30 degrees) hot vending machine. And picked one at random for the lovely factor. The coffee was tepid at best, and I hate lukewarm coffee, so I up pouring most of this one out.\n5. A random selection of starters from the buffer at my Hakone hotel dinner, while I waited for the beef in the pot to finish cooking.\n6. Mitarashi dango, grilled up on a snack boat that pulled up along side our Hozugawa River Boat.\n7. A gyoza set from Chao Chao Gyoza in Kyoto. Yep, this place is a total tourist trap, but I loved it anyway.\n8. A triple-mint infused mojito from Bar Fishbowl in Kyoto. Jesse, the bartender is a hoot and a half, and makes fab cocktails and has a Spencer Reid-style eidetic memory.\n9. Cream cheese flavoured soft serve from Hakone Cheese Terrace - brought back memories of the summer I worked at Dairy Queen, where I would make a Blizzard with EXTRA cheesequake bites.\n10. A juicy, wagyu beef croquette from KOBE CROQUETTE\n11. Banana Milk from a conbini - as a Canadian kid when we we were sick as kids, we\u2019d be given banana-flavoured Amoxicillin. This tasted exactly like that!\n12. A selection of Izakaya bites from a pub-crawl I did my first night in Shinjuku.\n13. An incredible pain au chocolat from Boul\u2019ange in Tokyo. I\u2019m a die-hard French pastry gal, and this bakery had me swooning.\n14. Sake-pickled veggies from my sake tasting at Harushika Sake Brewery in Nara. Delicious!\n15. A meal cobbled together from a thankfully, pretty well-stocked Lawsons, in Hakone. Only breakfast was included in my stay, so I paid the $65\u00a0 for dinner the first night, but didn\u2019t feel up to it the second night, and dinner options in Gora are sparse and expensive.\n16. Matcha Tiramisu from Katsukura Tonkatsu Sanjo\u00a0Main Store.\n17. Yonakisoba from the Dormy Inn Premium Ginza in Tokyo - my hotel offered free late night noodles, so I tried them. It's a fun gimmick, but they were average at best and not worth the stomach space or calories, so I only had them once during my 4-night stay.\n18. A hojicha cashew nuts tea latte from the Starbucks Reserve Roastery.\n19. Shinkansen Snacks - Traveling from Hiroshima to Kyoto, and I had already had lunch, so I just picked up some snacks for the ride.\n20. A creamy chicken ramen, and craft cola from Ramen Katamuki in Kyoto.\u00a0", "I so want to get back to Japan, if only for the food!", "I had the best pain au chocolat at the tsukiji fish market", "Bakery and Hakone, you\u2019re doing it right.", "Bro (or Bro-ette), that's just mean!\nSo jelly", "That looks so delicious", "Man, every time I see these, my longing for Japan grows even more.

{"title": "[I made] Slipper Lobster Chawanmushi with Lobster Butter ", "selftext": "A while ago I tried this crab Chawanmushi at Chaco Bar in Potts Point Sydney Australia. Covered in a sweet crustacean butter it was insanely rich, indulgent and blew my mind. Ever since I\u2019d been thinking about trying to make it myself. Now I\u2019m no good at lobster diving but a good mate said he\u2019d take me out so I saw it as the perfect opportunity to try have a crack at making this dish. Slipper lobster are something we don\u2019t see as much as our local eastern Rock Lobster but when you get your eye in there\u2019s plenty around. \n\nFor the lobster butter I just roasted the shells, removed the gills crushed them up then melted butter in a double boiler with the shells for 20mins, fine strain all this and your left with a super rich, iconic crustacean orange lobster butter. \n\nI wanted to do the Chawanmushi justice and I made the dashi from scratch, the katsuobushi I used gave the broth this beautiful Smokey flavour and I feel really helped to elevate the whole thing. Mixing the dashi into the eggs at a 2.5:1 ratio I added a some beautiful white shoyu (I\u2019ve found light soy/white soy is best otherwise the flavour quickly becomes overpowering), a little sake and a little mirin. Finally fine straining the custard mix to remove egg white membrane and any lumps and then steaming over some super low temp water. I steamed the slipper lobster tail in there aswell but wrapped the tail in some twine to keep it curled. After 15mins both were cooked and I carefully pulled the tail meat out and placed it ontop of the custard. I finished it by pouring some of that butter all round the top to seal the custard. I love the presentation of the dish and it\u2019s what I always had in my mind. Practically though it\u2019s pretty hard to eat like that and combine all those flavours so shredding the meat definitely works the best. Some people have suggested slicing the tail also so I might try that next time but I\u2019m not sure if it would still have the same feel.

I wanted to see if I could cut this down to something more reasonable for making at home without sacrificing the flavor and texture of a good tsukemen broth. \n\nI think I've cracked the code. I started off by borrowing a technique from my quick curry which is to grate all the aromatics (onion, ginger, garlic, and carrot). This releases most of the water from the veggies while creating more surface area. Adding a pinch of baking soda raises the pH and further speeds up Maillard browning. I also add ground pork to this mixture and brown the heck out of it (this takes about 8 minutes). \n\nThen, chicken stock and gelatin go in and get cooked for 10 minutes to extract the flavor from the browned pork and aromatics. The gelatin creates the texture of dissolved collagen in a bone broth simmered for hours. \n\nThis gets strained and then emulsified with Saikyo miso, shiitake powder, and katsuobushi powder. \n\nThe resulting tsukemen broth is kinda ridiculous and this method should work for almost any style of ramen.

Phase 1 & 2 is to coat the bottom and top halves of the mold separately, and phase 3 is to stuff the mold with the filling of your choice along with more batter to get the two halves to stick together.

The thing is, a traditional Japanese breakfast isn\u2019t all that complicated and although there are a lot of components, none of them are difficult to make. Traditional Japanese meals follow the format of Ichiju Sansai (\u4e00\u6c41\u4e09\u83dc), which literally means \u201cone soup three sides.\u201d So aside from a bowl of rice, you need a bowl of soup (usually miso soup) and a few side dishes. \n\nThe protein in the meal usually comes from some form of grilled fish, and salt-cured salmon is one of the most popular ones. To make it cure faster (and ensure it\u2019s evenly salted), I usually like to use a 2-3% brine instead of applying the salt directly. I also add a splash of mirin which add umami while lending an almost imperceptible sweetness that balances out the harshness of the salt. Aside from being good for breakfast, having some of these cured salmon filets on hand is handy because they can be added to a bento box lunch, flaked and stuffed into onigiri, or used as a topping for ochzuk\u00e9.

Slice the onions and cut the meat into bite sized pieces roughly equal in size. You could also peel & cut the carrots and potatoes at this time or you can do it later, in step 5.\n\n2.

Pour water into the pot until it just covers all of the ingredients and let it boil.\n\n8. Once the water boils, turn down the heat and let everything simmer for at least 20 minutes.\n\n9. Add in the Japanese curry sauce (one pack at the store usually comes with two smaller packs and each small pack contains 4 cubes of curry. I use one small pack.)\n\n10. Stir the curry cubes with the rest of the ingredients and let them melt. Wait for the curry to boil.\n\n11. When the curry boils, turn down the heat and let it simmer for another 5-10 minutes.

I typically strongly disagree with eating based on numbers, but having said that, this type of food is def high in sodium which others have mentioned and sodium may or may not cause issues in your body. Excess sodium needs to be flushed and electrolytes need to be balanced, which I think is pretty clear biology stuff, so it's not \"free\" and will tax you in some sense.\n\nThe only other thing I'll add is that hydration seems to be the common denominator for what makes me feel good. :)", "that may be too much seaweed for daily consumption. it contains iodine which isn't bad in small amounts but on a daily basis could affect your thyroid negatively.", "Check the salt/sodium parts of your ingredients, maybe you have to reduce it a bit, like less wakame, or less of those roasted seaweed etc.\n\nI too sometimes make japanese breakfast, but I use way less stuff.

Or, some are great with a really quick saute. Pea sprouts may be the easiest thing I've ever cooked.\n\nLast thing, if you have a taste for a lot of salt & worry not having it will make for a flavorless meal, don't forget that the palate adjusts. Eating less salt eventually retrains your taste buds to once again become more sensitive to it. In the meantime, it's possible to amend a salt decrease by activating the spicy & sour parts of the palate. Tossing in some rings of fresh hot pepper or a squeeze of lemon can kick up the flavor without kicking up the salt.\n\nKnow this was a rant, but I'm just so mad at how packaged food absolutely destroyed the health of some of my family, and my own for a while. \n\nBest of luck finding the perfect breakfast OP.", "I love Natto!

Chop the pork belly in small pieces and, adding a little bit of oil to the pan, fry them until golden brown. The fat from the pork belly should render and you\u2019ll get a good amount of lard.\n\n2. Add the miso along with soy sauce and mirin. Add sugar.\n\n3.  Add hondashi and katsuo bushi and partially crushed black sesame seeds.\n\n4. Adjust salt/sweet by adding sugar or miso. It should be just salty enough that it\u2019s not sweet, but the sweetnes must definitely be there. Maybe not as sweet as teriyaki sauce but it's close.\n\n5. Just before turning the heat off squeeze the juice of about 1 tbsp of freshly grated ginger.\n\n6. Once the miso starts boiling again remove from heat and let cool.

Cut the meat in strips and marinate it in soy sauce and sake for at least 15min.\n\n3. Cut the konnyaku in strips 5cm long, and about 5mm thick. Boil it for about 5 minutes to remove any bitternes and set it aside.\n\n4. Discard the daikon water and boil it for about 5 minutes and set it aside.\n\n5. Slice the shitake in strips no more than 5mm thick. Reserve the shitake water.\n\n6. Stir fry the meat in plenty of oil for a minute or two, then add all the other ingredients along with the kombu and the shitake water. Add enough chicken stock to barely cover the ingredients.

Wasabi is generally used to stick the sushi to the rice and not as an ingredient in sushi rolls, which are much more common in the states. \n\n2. In upscale sushi restaurants they use actual wasabi. In the US you are usually getting colored horseradish with a touch of wasabi. Wasabi has a higher concentration of isothiocyanates resulting in a spicier experience - in Japan they often have to tone down how much they use for American tourists.  So if your American sushi with diluted horseradish seems like it needs a kick, you're correct.\n\nAs with the ginger - you do you, but I would highly recommend you try things as presented in more upscale spots as they have theoretically put effort into balancing the flavors.

You can also pre-mix furikake in the rice. I can tell you\u2019re using a mold though, I\u2019d suggest less rice and absolutely no vinegar! Onigiri is a very simple comfort dish! :)", "I'm just here looking for tips on how to get as good as you are.", "\nOnigiri (like Sushi) is a rice dish where the rice (not the fish) is the main, featured ingredient.   The fish, filling/flavoring is there to accompany/enhance/promote the rice.  As such, great care needs to be taken with the rice.  \n\nTo put things in perspective, it takes about 3 years for people who become disciples under famous sushi masters to learn just how to prepare the rice (selecting, washing, cooking, flavoring) and another 8 or so to learn how to properly shape/use the rice in a nigiri.    \n\nOf course that's not something the average home cook needs to dedicate their time to, but I only mention it to emphasize how important rice is in Japanese culture/cuisine.  \n\nWhen shaping the onigiri, you want to take special care to make sure that the shape of each grain is preserved.  So a \"fluffy\" onigiri with \"air pockets\" in between each rice grain is ideal.  \n\nShaping the onigiri with your hands is the preferred method as you have much more control of the shape and firmness.  Firm enough so that it holds it's form, gentle enough so that the integrity of each grain is preserved.  Same thing if you're using a device to shape the onigiri, though you won't have as much control in this case.  \n\nYou can wet your hands to prevent onigiri from sticking but you don't want your hands to be too  wet.  The rice comes out of the pot/rice cooker already in perfect condition so you don't want to add additional moisture to it if you can help it.  \n\nEither dip your finger tips in a bowl of water and transfer/rub the water to your palms as needed.  If you run your hands under the faucet or put your entire hand in the bowl, sharply clap your hands together and that will cause excess moisture to come off.  Using a wet kitchen towel is another alternative.", "They look a bit too tight in my opinion.\nTry hand molding! My mom (and I) use Saran wrap or plastic wrap to put in the rice and then shape it.

It\u2019s usually seasoned with a soy sauce-based marinade, but Shio Karaage is a variation that uses salt instead. This leaves enough room for the flavor of the chicken to really shine through, and I like to back the salt up with sake for umami, black pepper for a bit of spice, and garlic to compliment the savory chicken. Then I dust it in potato starch, which is the trick to creating a light and crispy shell, before frying it.

I wonder if you can share a recipe with me because I really want to try it at home.\n\nHonestly, I never understood why almost everyone loves japanese food until my friend and I accidentally went to the one of Japanese restaurants in New York. The cooking there was at the highest level and the food was simply amazing. Since then I've become the biggest fan of such food, which is considered by many to be one of the healthiest in the world. Don't know if that's the reason why the japanese live so long, but I've read an article on [https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/why-japanese-diet-so-healthy](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/why-japanese-diet-so-healthy)  that praises the diet with traditional japanese food.\n\nThe problem is that I don't have a lot of money to go to restaurants every day, so I decided to learn to cook various japanese food from rolls to simple rice. I knew that the majority of japanese food is not that hard to make but I wanted to do it perfectly. I've read a lot of articles dedicated to the art of cooking. For example, I found an extended guide by [https://www.justonecookbook.com/sushi-rolls/](https://www.justonecookbook.com/sushi-rolls/) that helped me to learn almost everything about sushi rolls. And yesterday, I finally made my first portions of sushi rolls (see the pic), which turned out to be as good as in the restaurant. I was pretty shocked because it was the very first time I made them!\n\nI've also discovered on [https://openthe.world/food/japanese-snacks/](https://openthe.world/food/japanese-snacks/) that there is such a thing as \u201cSenbei\u201d, which is basically a rice cracker, lol. That's another thing that I want to make very soon but haven't found a good recipe yet.

The main time savings comes from grating the vegetables and then using baking soda to raise their pH. This makes them caramelize in about 3 minutes rather than the usual 1 hour.

Opened in 2018 by the French-trained chef Osamu Matsumura, it fulfills all the expectations of a high quality and refined ramen experience.\n\nA couple of things stand out at Ginza Hachigo compared to other ramen restaurants. Immediately before and after entering, you notice the very modern, clean and elegant design of the shop. Exactly what you would expect of a high class restaurant in Ginza. It's easy to forget that you can get a bowl of ramen for under $10 here. There is really only one item on the menu with various toppings. If you went all the way here and stood in line, we recommend to go for the all topping tokusei (\u7279\u6027) bowl.\n\nThe other big difference here is that Matsumura-san does not follow the traditional broth plus tare approach of most other ramen stores. Instead, the very rich and deep chicken and duck broth gets refined with some French salt - that's it! Looking at the color it would be easy to think that there's soy sauce in the bowl, but it all comes from the broth and its ingredients. The wonders of refined cooking technique and great high quality ingredients!\n\nThe toppings are on a similar high level. Juicy pork belly, crunchy menma bamboo shoots, thinly sliced negi and an ajitama egg made to perfection.\n\nHard to beat, even in Ginza. Even the Michelin Guide recognized this and has given Ginza Hachigo their Bib Gourmand award.

If you want to do smaller Maki, fill the rice bedding with the stuff you want inside and leave a 1cm border between rice and nori paper. Wrap adound the filling and then wet that border and close the roll. Maybe difficult to explain but then the rolls will not have that spiral shape.

I personally cover a bit over half or 2/3rds of the sheet and then when you roll, dab a bit of water on the plain sheet and it sticks the roll down. The thickness of your rice layer looks good though. \n\nTry and be a bit more consistent with the amount of filling used across the roll as you can see that some pieces have very big pieces of avocado, some small etc. It's hard to cut all the pieces consistently at first, just takes a bit of practice. \n\nFinally the rolls look a little bit thin and odd sizes. After cutting I would normally end up with 8 pieces per roll. When you have finished rolling, cut the roll in half down the middle, then for each side cut that piece in half, then half again. It means each piece is consistent in size across the roll and looks more presentable. \n\nOther than that though good effort, a bit more practice and you'll be there!", "I learnt a tip from one of my friends in Japan once.

Unless you want to spend hours putting water on a knife not designed for the job and then cutting with some amazing amount of clarity just buy a single bevel knife. They're not that expensive and they free up lots of time.\n\n(you can probably pay for the knife by throwing away the probably stupidly expensive wasabi and just using the local version of horseradish, same damn thing unless you spent squillions on the wasabi and had it air freighted in).\n\nPut the horseradish in the roll, avoid the embarrassing tube of green overpriced crap. \n\nGood sushi is a lot about being fresh in my opinion.

It\u2019s fairly common for certain Kaiseki to open the meal with a platter that has 10-15 little bites on it.

Usually it's some type of protein.  \n\n- To the left of that in the container in the front might be anago / salt water eel or some type of fish.\n\n- To the left of that is shirahana mame which is a type of white bean.    \n\n- Behind the white bean looks like pork?\n\n- To the left of the pork might be something with a puffed rice coating? Paired with that looks like monaka wafers which is a crispy shell made out of mochi/glutenous rice.  \n\n- Behind the puffed rice looks like nasu / eggplant.  \n\n- Other than the strawberry, the fruit might be stewed apple and pineapple?  \n\nI would agree that the plating is somewhat unusual for kaiseki.

To prepare your noodles from frozen, soak them in hot water for about a minute, and use a pair of chopsticks to carefully loosen the noodles. Rinse with cold water, drain, and set aside.\n2. Heat butter over medium heat, until completely melted and bubbling. Add onion and garlic and cook for about 2 minutes, or until fragrant. Stir in the mushrooms.\n3. Add about 2-3 tbsp of water and oyster sauce to the pan and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes until the mushrooms are cooked through.\n4. Add heavy cream and miso paste, and mix to combine. Bring the sauce to a boil, add the noodles and toss until evenly coated. Season with salt and pepper to taste, garnish, and enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\nIf you prefer your dish to be more brothy: you can add about 1/4 cup of chicken stock (or more) along with the heavy cream to thin out the sauce. Please feel free to adjust the consistency to your liking!\n\nUsing frozen udon noodles is recommended for this recipe as they store for months in the freezer, and I found that the frozen kind is actually more ideal for stir-fries. Frozen udon noodles often have a nice chewy texture, and are less prone to getting mushy and overcooked when stir-frying. \n\nFor ingredient details and cooking tips, please refer to the original recipe above.", "How is this Japanese food?

It\u2019s fine if they stick a little.\n* Cook these ingredients for 2 mins each, in this order: onion, then carrot & garlic, and finally mushroom.\n* Add water. You can add 350ml first, and if the curry gets too thick later, add another 50ml or so.\n* Simmer for 15 mins, then add 2 servings of curry roux block. Stir well, simmer for another 15 mins, add extra water or season if needed and it\u2019s done! Reheat before serving.\n* (Optional) You can use some of these: Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, Japanese soy sauce, sugar, honey and grated apple to compose the right balance for your sauce. I used Java brand (hot), so I added 1tbs soy sauce, 1tbs Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbs ketchup and 1 tbs sugar to my sauce.\n\n**2.** **Tips**\n\n* Use a good non-stick 20cm frying pan\n* Use very fresh eggs, at room temperature. Old eggs are too watery\n* Practice using chopsticks to grab and rotate the imaginary eggs while moving the pan\n* Use chopsticks to grab at 45\u02da then raise to 90\u02da, right hand turns the eggs while left hand moves the pan slightly to left & right\n* Use a small burner with medium heat for small pan\n* Whisk 3 eggs well, then strain to smoothen. Spoon out smaller bubbles.\n* Be gentle but also pretty quick to turn the eggs, otherwise it will be hardened and impossible to turn.\n\n**3.** **Rice**\n\n* In a deep plate, shape hot rice like a volcano\n\n**4.** **Tornado Omelette**\n\n* Add 1 tbs of oil, brush the oil on the edge of the pan as well\n* Use medium heat, move pan and oil around to heat up evenly\n* When the pan gets to medium hot, pour the eggs mixture in, let it set for a few seconds\n* Once the edge of the eggs turns white, grab and turn gently. W the inner circle is formed, use the resistance in the cooked eggs to turn more rounds. The more layers you could make, the more beautiful it will look later.\n* Use the other hand to move the pan, also tilt to redistribute and cook the remaining runny eggs.\n* Keep the chopsticks in the eggs and use them to help placing the eggs nicely on top of the rice. Remove gently.\n* Add a lot of curry sauce around the eggs and enjoy!", "This is so beautiful and pleasing to look at.", "What a mouthwatering picture! I'm totally doing that.", "That's awesome.

Miso Glazed Eggplant has become pretty popular in Japanese izakayas around the world but did you know the dish was named after an ancient ritual dance that involves a dude dressed in a robe on a pogo stick? The original version was made with tofu that was skewered and grilled before being glazed with sweet miso. Apparently, this resembled the dance, which is where it got its name. These days, dengaku is usually made with a fat variety of eggplant. I like roasting mine in a scorching oven to get the interior tender and creamy while caramelizing the exterior. This gives it a texture that's similar to deep-frying it, except it's much less greasy. For the Dengaku glaze, I use a mixture of two types of miso with mirin and sugar and slather it onto the eggplant before popping it back into the oven for a few minutes to caramelize the glaze.

We arrived shortly after noon and had lunch at Kushi-tei of Tokyo, which was OK, but the service was a bit underwhelming. Most places didn't look too crowded. \n\nThe real revelation came later that evening when we had dinner at Soba-An, recommended in my topic not once, but twice. My cold soba with hot soup to dip it in had that awesome quality and taste I remember from eating in Japan; where the ingredients just click together. My kid had hot soba soup which was equally excellent, and we had tempura with it (very good!). Thank you u/RealArc and u/twilightninja for that recommendation. We were happy to have a reservation, because the place was packed, both inside and at the small outdoor seating area. We will surely eat there again when we're in the area.\n\nThen the shops. The first one we came across was Tains, which seemed fairly newly established. Large modern shop, which didn't seem much different from the large Asian supermarkets you can find at larger cities in The Netherlands (For you Dutchies: it's a lot like Amazing Oriental, only there's not many Indonesian or Surinamese products to be found), with plenty of Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Thai products, most from familiar producers.\n\nDae-Yang further down the road is a mixed Japanese/Korean shop with an small souvenir section, but again, food-wise, doesn't have much over the assortment that's offered in the Amsterdam/Amstelveen area back home. I did love the shop though, with its cramped paths and broader selection in brands and varieties of products.\n\nShochiku two doors down was the most Japanese of all, and there I found some products I've never seen in a shop here: fried tofu pouches to make inarizushi, a large selection of Japanese sesame oils, mirin-the-real-stuff and pickled aubergine with red shiso that I was really happy to find. I also liked the section with konbini food they have and next time we visit I'll bring a cooler to explore that some more. Both shops, but especially Shochiku also had a good selection of different kinds of rice. The price point of most products is the same as in The Netherlands.\n\nThere's only so many shops you can subject a teenager to, and all he wanted to bring home was Pocari Sweat and Pocky sticks. I would have loved to explore the non-food shops as well, but he'd been a good sport We spent the second half of the afternoon going to the large Chagall exhibition in the Kunstsammlung which, off-topic, is  highly recommended if you're in the area this summer.\n\nThe next day was May 1st, and in Germany that means that almost everything is really closed (as opposed to back home where some shops and most supermarkets are open on national holidays). But bakeries are open, and the Korean bakery was a nice place for breakfast, with its mix of traditional Korean products like fried rice balls with red bean filling and corndogs, bubble tea and slices of colourful cakes (I bought a large piece of rainbow cake to cheer up my niece who is down with mono, the poor thing). Most restaurants seemed to be opening for lunch as well.\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf is a 3-hour drive from Amsterdam on a day with normal traffic. We stopped over at the end of our holiday on our way home, and I would definitely do that again. The slightly broader selection (i.e. at Shochiku) doesn't warrant a full trip imho, but for Dutchies that live closer to the German border, I would recommend it.

I've got the book \"Gohan\" by Emiko Davies and it's got a delicious daikon and lemon pickle recipe that I like to have in the fridge. Of course there are lots for sale at Asian supermarkets too.", "This is a fantastic question (if I\u2019m understanding you right) and i don\u2019t know why it doesn\u2019t have more upvotes. Sure there\u2019s recipes for dishes out there, but what makes a meal?\n\nThe most basic Japanese meal is white rice, pickled vegetables, and miso soup. To make a more satisfying and nutritious meal, you would add a main dish and a side dish. That\u2019s basically what families have for dinner most of the time.\n\nHere\u2019s some examples of main dish and side dish combinations:\n- grilled fish and hiyayakko (tofu with toppings)\n- fried pork/chicken/fish and shredded cabbage\n- stewed chicken and ohitashi (soused greens)\n\nSome meals don\u2019t quite fit that mold:\n- curry and salad (omit miso soup and choose pickles that go well with curry like fukujinzuke or rakkyo)\n- pasta or doria and salad (omit rice and pickles, serve potage instead of miso soup)\n\nThere\u2019s also simpler meals that are more suitable for lunch, but can also be a light dinner, such as donburi, ramen, udon and soba. These meals usually do not include all of the normal meal components.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s nice to cook the rice with broth and vegetables, or even certain proteins. It\u2019s called \u201ctakikomi\u201d rice, but it is lighter than a risotto or biryani, more like a pilaf, and you still need all the other components to make a full meal.\n\nYou might see the term \u201cichiju sansai,\u201d that\u2019s the term that describes this standard meal. It means, one soup and three dishes (the rice is implied). Normally these components are served in their own dish, so each place setting will have 5 dishes in total.", "try buta shogayaki (ginger pork) and horenso gomaae (boiled spinach dressed with sesame)", "the broiler is your weapon if you don't have a grill", "I think for home cooking, grilled fish would be more popular than frying. Deep frying is for more special occasions and holidays. And during colder seasons, nabes and stewed dishes would be more popular.", "oyakodon", "Teriyaki(much less goopy/sweet than you see in the States) and stir-frys are popular mains for home cooking because they come together quickly. You could do teriyaki chicken/fish, shoga yaki (ginger pork), or a Chinese-influenced stir-fry with things like tofu, bean sprouts, cabbage, and protein of choice (usually super thin cut quick-cooking pieces).  On days she had more time, my mom would make something like [this](https://www.justonecookbook.com/carrot-beef-rolls/) with string beans too!\n\nI find the amount of protein in a meal is generally a bit more dispersed in a traditional Japanese meal - i.e. some tofu in soup, a bit of tamagoyaki, a small portion of grilled fish, etc. rather than the big steak main that we see in Western meals.", "Gyudon is one of the easier dinners to make. Any Japanese or Korean market, like HMart, will carry thinnly sliced beef.", "If it's not paired with raw fish, don't do sushi rice (rice with vinegar and sugar)", "* Karaage is an extremely fast and simple way to make fried chicken.\n* If you're going to deep fry karaage then you might as well make korokke too.\n* Tempura anything is another deep fried Japanese favorite.\n* Parboiling vegetables with a little salt in the water is fast, simple, and will give you wonderous variety.\n* Someone mentioned pickled vegetables. Most vegetables can be pickled using Japanese recipes.\n* Boiled shrimp takes about 2 minutes to prep and 3 minutes to cook.\n* Speaking of shrimp, I like a shrimp and celery soup that takes about 3 minutes to cook once the water is boiling.\n* Tamagoyaki only takes a few minutes to make once you learn the technique.\n* If you're going to learn how to make tamagoyaki then learn how to make egg crepes so you can make omurice.\n* With regular (non-sushi) rice it takes about 5 minutes to make the rice for omurice. So if you set some aside when you make your sushi rice you can have both.\n* If you're making sushi rice, take the time to make onigiri.\n* Japanese curry is a snap in a crock pot. Start it in the morning and let it cook all day. Then it's just a few minutes to mix in the roux.\n* Gyoza is another one like tamagoyaki. Learn a good technique unless you want to be all day at it.\n* Add some fresh, raw fruits and vegetables.\n\nUnless you're fixing a 1-dish meal like omurice, ramen, or curry the secret to a good Japanese meal is to serve a lot of dishes in small amounts. If you learn to cook in single and double servings then you can easily prepare 5-7 hot dishes and compliment them with a couple of cold pre-made dishes in a very short amount of time.\n\nYou might also want to take some time to learn about \"washoku\" (aka \"goshoku\"). On the more high-brow end of traditional Japanese cuisine the colors white, yellow, red, blue (green), and black are used in food to give visual balance to meals. I also recommend investing in a variety of sushi platters and 1 cup and 1/2 cup bowls so you can serve each dish on/in it's own platter or bowl. In Japanese cuisine presentation is important. Food that is visually beautiful and presented in a beautiful manner is believed to elevate the appetite. I don't know how far back that concept goes exactly, but it was written about in a book named In Praise Of Shadows by Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki in 1933. In it there is a wonderful description of miso soup shimmering in a lacquerware bowl in the glow of a paper lantern. These things are very important to Japanese cuisine and even the most simple dish is elevated when it's served correctly.", "Look up \u201ctraditional Japanese breakfast\u201d the options are limitless! \n\nrice (including rice balls/onigiri), grilled fish, soup (usually miso soup but there are many others), tsukemono, tamagoyaki, natto, japanese-style salad with wafu dressing, Japanese-style potato salad, and tea, Japanese teas are usually green, ranging from light green to dark (almost black) green", "Ohhhhhhhh god brother you\u2019re speaking my language\u2026.

Possibly a chain with other locations.\n\nGerman beer halls, serving imported beer and standards like brats and schnitzel, are easy to find. There's a Hofbrauhaus in Tokyo, for a start.

But I also wasn't seeking it out, as I was flying in *from* Korea. With the popularity of kimbap exploding internationally, it might be bringing some more attention to Korean food in Japan just like in the west.\n\nI'm really interested to go back and check out some of the authentic Mexican restaurants that I'm hearing are a thing now in parts of Japan.

Like all restaurants the chef will put their spin on it. I personally quite like that but each to their own. \nLastly in Tokyo, there are also big European culinary stars like Joel Robuchon if you\u2019re in need of a fix of butter from Normandy etc etc", "There is one Russian restaurant in Jinbocho, I regret never going in but the Russian woman standing outside advertising was very friendly.

What I usually do is take off the paper, using a knife to spin the strands around the paper to detach it without it getting everywhere (you can use chopsticks for this too but I usually eat this with fork and knife), then add the sauce packets to the natto and mixa-mixa-mixa very well.  Then I pour it onto a plate, which happens a lot more easily now that it's been mixed with the sauce, and microwave for 25 seconds.  By the way, natto should stay frozen until you're ready to eat it; it can stay out of the freezer for at most, like, a week.\n\nNow, typically, I like to eat natto with Korean banchan for breakfast.  I go to H-Mart and buy a bunch of prepared side dishes, get some interesting-looking package of natto (they come in different varieties, with different sauces, etc.), and for breakfast I make a plate consisting of one packet of natto, as mentioned above, and a little bit of each of a bunch of those side dishes.

The sushi one is nice, but I really didn't like it over tuna and over the yam or radish or whatever it was.  Turns out they weren't using the sauce.  At home, I use the sauce and it's a whole lot better!\n\nNext time you get natto, maybe also head over to the sushi counter and get some maguro or sake (the fish, not the drink) or whatever, and try to prepare the natto with the sauce, warm it, and put it over the fish.

After shredding the cabbage, soak the shreds in very cold or ice water for 10 minutes. Then drain the water well using a salad spinner.

Desserts and drinks were good though, I really enjoyed the matcha latte! Maybe get your main lunch somewhere else and just get a dessert/drink at the cafe? (you do have to order at least 1 item per person, so keep that in mind if you\u2019re bringing children or someone who might not eat a lot if they\u2019ve just had another meal)\n\nReservations are quite difficult. I didn\u2019t have any luck getting something 31 days ahead of time, like you\u2019re recommended. I also spent a week staying up until 2 am for it, so it was quite disappointing. However, I did have luck getting a cancellation the night before! You have to be a little more flexible with times and planning, but we made it work. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s easier to get tickets when you\u2019re in Japan, when I was able to get the cancellation compared to being in the US for the 31 days before, but idk.

Unagi restaurants typically use tare for eel served with rice, but they also have a salt option on the menu.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen:\n\nFor yakitori, tsukune (chicken meatballs) usually comes with tare, while sunagimo (gizzard) is often served with salt.\n\nFor yakiniku, beef tongue is typically served with salt and lemon. Horumon (offal) often gets tare, but some fattier cuts are also popular with salt and lemon, since they taste lighter that way.\n\nAlso, salt (and soy sauce) is often used for seafood.", "Basically, you can eat it with whatever flavor you like. I think the so-called salt flavor is suitable for cuts that don't have a strong flavor or odor.

On the other hand, soy sauce or miso flavored with garlic are often used with some innards that have a strong odor. You can also choose to soak the meat before or after grilling.

I sure hope you're freezing the curd before you add it in! Rolling the frozen ball in something like a light dusting of potato starch, superfine rice flour, or cornstarch would help it not stick as you're filling.\n\n\n2. The most \"authentic\" way to cap the ball would be to use what is usually used in most \"light\" fruit daifuku- white bean paste (shiroan). It's quite dry and very lightly flavored, and does a good job of keeping slightly gooey interior things contained. I've found it quite hard to find for sale in my neck of the woods (New England), but it's not too hard to make in large batches with practice, though it is time consuming. If I were looking to map out the whole thing, I think I'd almost certainly go frozen lemon curd wrapped with shiroan wrapped with mochi. \n\n\nGood luck!

This leaves behind a smooth surface on the fish with no pockets. Sushi places use this technique but other than that it's not widespread in the West. \n\nIt takes practice to learn to do it. The trick is to lightly rest your knife on the fish and not try to dig in. It's not a fast process and your first times attempting it will go even slower so make sure to give yourself plenty of additional time if you want dinner to be ready by a certain time. \n\nThere are other things you can do as well like soaking in sake/salt but these are not nearly as effective as sukibiki and they will affect the taste so you can't do it on every recipe (though some do call for it).", "Also look up ikejime.

I don't kill my fillets but I do a 15 minute soak in salt water (1:6 ratio) before patting dry for most fish, but for like mackerel or oilier ones, I will wash in the salt solution then do a 20 min rest of it with salt + sake (i just brush the sake on and liberally sprinkle salt) and then wash in the salt solution again before patting dry. .", "Well, briefly rinsing fillets with hot water or sake also helps remove the odor.

In the latter case the salting and drying will kill surface bacteria, but the damage is already done to some extent. In this case there is a trick which works well\u2014turmeric. This was shown to me by a friend from South Asia. Simply do the salting step as above but include a very light dusting of turmeric powder along with the salt. Of course this doesn\u2019t work with Sashimi but for cooked dishes it makes a noticeable difference without affecting the taste negatively. \n\nIf you\u2019re catching the fish you eat, heading, gutting, bleeding and rinsing as soon as possible is key. As is storing in or on ice quickly.", "Aren't you supposed to freeze fish intended for sushi to remove any parasites?", "in addition to what the others have said here, since you catch your own fish, maybe you can try ike jime?\n\n\nit's basically lobotomizing the fish so that there's less lactic acid buildup and other stress hormones are prevented from being released in the meat because the fish stops thrashing around due to being effectively brain dead.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XOaP8pojGZE?si=I37fEmXFm_Ey9vmE", "I would dry it first. Then put salt on and wrap it with paper towel. It helped get rid of a lot of the fishy smell.", "[removed]"]}

Either way, the dish had fragrant rice with vegetables and all kinds of delicious seasonings and it was almost sweet in A way and it was a wonderful contrast to the chef choice sushi. There was a lot of different types of sushi and it was just fabulous and delicious. Was my favorite dish ever. We tried to go back, but we just couldn\u2019t find it again. Since then, I\u2019ve gone to Japanese restaurants and they may have Chi Dashi But it doesn\u2019t come with a fragrant rice and it\u2019s not chef\u2019s choice sushi and normally the sushi pieces are cut up into little tiny tiny cubes as if it\u2019s just any kind of leftovers that they toss on top of the dish.

This would be similar to how many Americans are grossed out about the idea of deep fried candy bars.\n\n>...deep-fried sushi, which is a common part of Japanese cuisine\n\nThis however is not true. Deep fried sushi and rolls are not a common part of Japanese cuisine. It can be encountered here and there but it's definitely a novelty or otherwise a way to make sushi that ended up with stale rice more palatable. Things like the items you mentioned are much more commonly encountered on the internet than in real life.\n\nSushi rolls with fried ingredients as one component is more common however, with modern sushi restaurants sometimes serving hand rolls with tempura inside it, and of course the more traditional inarizushi which uses pockets of fried tofu.\n\n\\--\n\nOn a wider note, most of the social media depictions of Italian people being offended is a gross over-exaggeration of reality. Most italian people will not be so completely offended by the so called affronts to italian cuisine the way these depictions indicate. Some of them will again be weirded out, or sometimes go as far as, \"we don't do that in italy.\" Sure, there is a lot of pride among Italian people in their cuisine and how they or their family do things, but outward displays of intense offense and disgust is extremely rare unless their intent is to criticize and demean the other person or group of people.\n\nThis type of social media content is purposely exaggerating things to generate engagement and revenue for the content creator, and they do so by purposefully demeaning non-italian people.

I've made 2 allergies travel cards (both in english and japanese) and I wanted to know which is better and if the translation are accurate.\n\nI'm allergic to:\n\n- crabs shrimps crustaceans in general (I know imitation crab/surimi is made predominantly from white fish but I don't wanna risk it)\n\n- all kind of mushrooms and even food with mold like 'gorgonzola cheese''\n\n- spinach\n\n- kiwi fruit\n\n- chamomile (the flower and the infuse)\n\nI hope this is the tight thread.\nThanks you so much in advance!!!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jzdfdd", "created_utc": 1744673831.0, "score": 95, "author": "Discount-Practical", "num_comments": 53, "permalink": "/r/JapaneseFood/comments/1jzdfdd/food_allergy_card_for_japan_travel/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Most places will probably not accommodate your request to prepare food differently, it's just not common practice in Japan. Your message may sound more like a demand, that businesses may frown upon such request.\n\nYou should word it to say that you would like to be informed if it contains your allergens, otherwise you should reaearch what food you should be able to eat, or contact places ahead of time to check on menu items that don't contain your allergens.", "You are likely to be turned away from restaurants. You might want to have a serious backup plan to get your own food that you know is safe like raw fruit and bread from a grocery store. \n\nCrustaceans and mushrooms are especially difficult to avoid. It's best if you learn all the kanji you need to look out for on labels but that will be difficult if you don't know any Japanese at all. Especially all the different types of mushrooms have unique names and there's a lot. \n\nMy husband and I are both mixed Japanese and he has a mushroom allergy and I got celiac from my European side and I have to be the person to read ingredients in Japanese, ask questions, order for him, etc. because I speak the language some but he doesn't. \n\nEven some foods that may seem benign like tamagoyaki could potentially use a dashi that contains a shellfish ingredient. The only foods I can think of that would likely be safe for you are plain onigiri (the salt only kind, no filling), any sort of yogurt or cream based dessert, cake, mochi, coffee and green or oolong tea drinks, plain rice, fried chicken. Since regular soy sauce has wheat and it's in so many foods I'm in the same boat at times and have to survive off onigiri, chips, coffee drinks, etc. depending on what's around me. For you I worry that shellfish and mushrooms are so common even in things like flavoring powder on chips and broths. \n\nIf you are in Tokyo and will be staying in Japan for a little while like at least a week I recommend buying a cheap knife from Don Quijote or if you can find one at a place like Daiso so you can cut fresh fruits and vegetables yourself wherever you are staying. There are also some high end western friendly small grocery stores in towers places like Shibuya that will have some western friendly products like bread, jam, crackers, etc.", "I had a friend who had severe allergies to nuts, eggs, and soy who traveled to Japan to study abroad. He couldn\u2019t eat anywhere and didn\u2019t even trust buying from the grocery store cause cross contamination is common. He went home the next week and had to skip a semester. I\u2019m gonna be frank, I wouldn\u2019t advise going if your allergies are severe", "If your allergy to mold includes koji I would really advise not traveling to Japan - miso, soy sauce, sake etc etc all rely on that and with your other allergies too I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s much you can eat. You could bring food from home but you/your travel mates are really not gonna have a fun time.\nSmaller shops also tend to be lackadaisical on their understanding of allergens - they won\u2019t serve you shrimp tempura with this card but probably won\u2019t think to check about shrimp powder in a dish. It\u2019s going to be a really big risk on your life and if something happens, you will have to navigate medical terms in Japanese too.", "Be prepared to be turned away. Many places would rather not serve you than risk you having a health crisis.", "Simply put: they are not going to accommodate you in the way you request. They are not going to change their speciality recipes for you. Especially shellfish and mushroom because it's in everything. \n\nI advise renting and Airbnb and cooking at home. I also did that as a broke ass student and lived off microwave rice, eggs, tofu and cabbage lol. Other than that, mcdonald's and other chain restaurants have allergens listed on their websites. So look up chains like sukiya, nakao, yoshinoya, Coco curry house, matsunoya ,freshness, Mos burger, lotteria, etc.\n\nThis trip is gonna suck for you food wise. So many restaurants only have menus written across signs in Japanese across the wall, so you'll have to skip those entirely. Many restaurants on serve one thing, like ramen, and they can't change that for you. You will not be able to try what they recommend (\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081). Honestly, if I were you, I would not go at all. If you can't eat in Japan, I see no reason of traveling all the way there.", "I want to reiterate that mold is in almost everything in Japan in the form of [koji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_oryzae).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m also concerned about spinach. There are many green leaf vegetables not found in other countries, like komatsuna, mizuna and mibuna, and many more obscure ones like tsuruna. Whatever it is in spinach you\u2019re allergic to could be in any of these.\n\nEven if you show this card to restaurants and they want to accommodate, they will miss this and possibly other important allergens. I\u2019m shocked you would even attempt eating out in a foreign country with such an extensive and unusual set of allergies, where even shared equipment in the kitchen poses a danger to you. Crustacean is the only allergen here that most restaurants will have any experience with.", "I think the tone of the writing is a bit off for the cultural landscape you are going into.", "What do you usually eat? \nThis is going to be pretty difficult if you\u2019re walk in restaurants here", "I\u2019d bring foods from your home country that you know you can eat and prepare easily incase you find it hard to find foods to eat. I\u2019m thinking something along the lines of cereal or easy mac n cheese as a backup.", "I don't think travelling to Japan is worth risking your life though...", "I don't see the mold listed? If your life depends on this I'd seek a professional translator.", "I don't understand the motivation for wanting to travel to a country where you don't speak the language at the risk of a fatal allergic reaction like anaphylaxis.", "Crustaceans and mushrooms are going to hard to avoid. A lot restaurants wouldn't give proper information on what's included in the food because they themselves wouldn't wouldn't be sure if one of those things are added. So a lot of restaurants would maybe request you to not eat there if it's a serious allergy. I would suggest to look for restaurants which specialize in making food for people with allergies. It will be costly but you will get what you need without worrying.", "Surimi for sure has crab in it. The one I buy for home use does.", "As a long time resident of Japan, while I understand your dilemma, I'd just recommend against eating out while you travel here. 99% of the restaurants won't be able to cater to your allergies.\n\nEnjoy the scenery and experiences, but I wouldn't risk any restaurant food with such restrictions if I couldn't speak the language. \n\nEven if a restaurant is willing to accommodate you, the chance of cross-contamination is sky high.", "I have a life threatening allergy so I think I\u2019m going to go to Google translate & hope it\u2019s good enough to protect me. Sounds like you have more faith than me.", "The translation is fine. I think the way it's worded is direct but not rude. Avoiding the food itself doesn't seem like a huge issue to me. It's the seriousness of your allergy, requiring full sanitation of all tools to prevent cross contamination just for you, that sounds almost impossible to ensure in most restaurant, including in the US. \n\nIf you have a budget for it, it might be worth considering hiring a local guide or coordinator. They could handle communicating your allergy with restaurants and help you arrange what you need.", "Realistically, if a restaurant wants to meet your request, they will not offer all the seafood/freshwater products.  \nAny Japanese know that crustaceans are intermingled in the fishing.  \nThe mushrooms are same. if you go to a \u201cfully vegan\u201d Japanese restaurant, the broth will probably be shiitake mushroom or kombu kelp.\n\nOh, and a piece of advice from me, who used to work for a game development company.  \nThe **text is too long,** and no one reads it.\n\nIn a busy restaurant, they just look at the picture and say,   \n\"I love these ingredients! Please put a lot of it in more!\" and interpret that as you saying. perhaps.  \nalso, We have restaurants with foreign workers who Japanese and English aren't native languages.\n\nWrite \u201c\u26d4**CANNOT EAT / \u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\ud83c\ude32**\u201d in big letters and Emojis", "I have a friend who I travel regularly to Japan with. He has a whole bunch of bad allergies. And he\u2019s just resigned to the fact that McDonald\u2019s and Shake Shack are the only places he can really eat at when we\u2019re out. Otherwise he just cooks himself.", "Do you do this in your home country when you go out for dinner? Do restaurants give you 100% certainty the dishes won\u2019t trigger the allergy?\n\nUltimately, putting the responsibility on restaurants isn\u2019t great, particularly the way Japanese restaurants operate.", "I have a pretty bad intolerance to foods in the allium family (garlic, all types of onions, chives) and it was pretty difficult to eat out. I stayed with a friend so I mostly ate at their house  but I still got sick a couple times because I ate something with dried onion in it even though the staff tried really hard to accommodate me. It's got to be tough to travel with multiple allergies. I think getting an Airbnb with a kitchen and making your own food is the way to go. Have breakfast and dinner at home and make some snacks to munch on while you're out doing stuff.", "Big chains in Japan already have in-depth allergan information on their websites and menus. \n\nThe problem is cross-contamination. Shellfish is eatten all over there. You should definitely bring a epi-pen ( you may have to inform Japanese immigration before coming with one, I don't know the law, some medications are restricted or require prior approval ).\n\nMushrooms are big too. \n\nHonestly, these are two of the worst allergies to have on a trip there.", "My advices are:\n\n 1) Research ahead of time where it would be safe for you to eat so that it would be less necessary for you to use the card because restaurants are an extremely busy environment. They could accommodate your dietary needs but most are unlikely to deviate from their normal routine.\n\n2) If you have to use a card, use one that **asks** if they can accommodate your needs and use it before sitting down. If you have to use it after sitting down, it may ruin the experience for you and the restaurant. The restaurant might not tell you \"no\" out of obligation and feel forced to cater for your needs because you've already sat down and you now have a risk of consuming an allergen or they might say no and you will have to leave after sitting down, which can be embarrassing for the server or yourself.\n\nFrom what I see in your cards, they are made with the mindset that the restaurant have the ability to accommodate you and you are just **telling** them your needs. That's what you will need to change in the cards because it's better to assume they cannot accommodate, just to be safe, until you ask them first.", "Cute card though. You graphic designer?", "Is kiwifruit a common allergen? I used to add kiwi to my smoothies but it always gave me this instant tiny sharp sensation on my tongue, like mild tingles, like if you imagine the tiny spikes that are in your pineapple. I had no other symptoms aside from that and I assumed it was just how the flesh acts when it\u2019s blended up, like pineapple.", "Hi. I\u2019m not sure if it was on this sub or another one but you\u2019re actually not the first person to try to travel to Japan avoid fish and mushrooms. Try to search around and see if you can find that other post.\n\n\nAltering the dish isn\u2019t really the fundamental problem. You\u2019ll encounter a pretty wide sectrum of willingness to make alterations. It\u2019s more that many restaurants will turn you down because they don\u2019t have the right processes in the kitchen to combat cross contamination. It\u2019s for your safety.\n\nI know there\u2019s been some discussion of restaurants that are vegan / vegetarian and allergen friendly - primarily in urban areas. Might be worth seeking out those restaurants.", "You\u2019re better off cooking for yourself on a portable stove or checking the website of the restaurant you want to go to since they post the allergens and see if it\u2019s fine. Customization in Japan is nonexistent unless it\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, kfc and the like.  It\u2019s gonna be hard with the crustaceans cause the dashi most places use is mixed with shrimp as well.  Japanese \u307b\u308c\u3093\u305d\u3046(spinach) is also in a lot of dishes. I just went to joyfull (a Japanese family restaurant) and my side dishes were filled with mushrooms and spinach and even the miso soup had tofu and spinach.", "How many epi pens are you planning on taking ?\nAnd how long is your trip? What area of Japan are you going to? Is it big city like Tokyo or a more rural town?", "This is such an interesting post - i myself am allergic to rice and corn so as you can imagine i have been hesitant to many countries due to the food risks/restrictions. The card is at least a great idea but would not be 100% safe and you'd likely still need to trust your gut in many situations.", "Asking and explaining your allergic to some foods is entirely reasonable.  I found that most restaurants were able to tell me at least if ingredients were there. Protip: if you don't want to drink alcohol,  you can claim that you're allergic to alcohol without giving offence."]}

Not Katsu-don.", "I just came to say I have that same plate from Ikea", "\nWhat does the character \"donburi\" (bowl of rice) mean really ?\n\n Its origins date back to the Kanbun era (1661-1673) in the early Edo period.\n\nAt the time, there was a restaurant called \"Kendonya\" that sold meals in bowls, one serving at a time. The \"Kendonburi bowls\" served there were shortened to \"donburi,\" and eventually came to refer to all bowl-served food.\nThe kanji for \"don\" means Well and is the original character for \"well\". Well represents a frame and the dot in the middle represents a bucket or gushing water. it is said to come from the sound of water \"dobun ! \" when you  thrown a bucket with water  into a well , it me makes sounds like heavy \" Dong\" sound . Like A lots of food in a one bowl makes you feel like heavy sounding impression . \n\n In China this letter is pronounced as \" Ton or  Tan \" perhaps it's sound of empty bucket hitting on a surface of water of a well.  LoL \ud83e\udd23 \n\n When choosing the kanji for \"donburi\", the sound of water is similar to the pronunciation of donburi and the shape of the character was also a perfect fit, so the character \"don\" was adopted. \n\nThus, \"Kendonya,\" the restaurant where the bowl was invented, got its name from the restaurant's \"tsukkendon\" (absolutely greedy) ,  stingy attitude towards its customers. \n\n\"Ken\" means to be frugal and \"don\" means to covet, so \"kendon\" means to be stingy and greedy.  Now,  there are same sounding kanji or Chinese characters even it has same sounding it doesn't mean same thing.  so don't confuse with other kanji characters .  LoL \n\n  However, because it was so blatant, it seems that the character \"kendonya\" just a place to look and leave was sometimes used instead.\n \n  You would think that such a restaurant would soon go out of business, but its \"cheapness \" with no refills and no markup on prices was well received, and it is said to have been a huge hit in Edo until around the Kansei era (1789-1801) in the mid-Edo period.\n That's why Donburi food ... It's considered as fast food or cheap food . Like when  you look at modern humberger in a paper box or  yoshinoya beef bowl kind a nuance .", "bit sad for a don, even tho there are a few grains of rice under there"]}

From there I gently simmered the pork belly, crushed/sliced ginger root and the green parts of a bundle of green onion in sake and water for two hours topped with a drop lid. Every time I went to the kitchen for water I'd skim a little of the scum and fat off the top.\n\nAfter two hours I strained the broth and reserved it for another use. Removing the green onion and ginger, I cut the strips of pork belly into cubes and returned it to the pot with dashi, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar. Specifically, I used Okinawan black sugar. Because of that I guess, technically, this is a middle ground between kakuni and the Okinawan version, rafute.\n\nI gently simmered for another two hours with the drop lid on, letting the sauce reduce around the pork belly until somewhat thick and the cubes were extremely tender. I transferred the belly and sauce to a new bowl to cool down (it's important to leave the pork belly in the sauce to cool.)\n\n  \nOnce it was cooled, I warmed it back up and served with rice, the white part of the scallion, and some homemade togarashi (I know, a little redundant, but letting it cool together improves everything significantly.)\n\nEdit: \n\nApproximate amounts\n\nPork belly - ~2lbs\n\nSake - 3/4 cup [1/4 cup in first half, 1/2 cup in second]\n\nGinger - 3 inch knob [1/2 in each half] \n\nSoy sauce - 1/4 cup\n\nMirin - 1/4 cup\n\nDashi - ~2.5 cups\n\nScallion/green onion - 5-6 [if you have Tokyo negi/Welsh onion, I'd use two.]\n\nSugar - 1/4 cup\n\nWhen reducing the sauce, keep an eye on it, especially during the last hour or so. It can go from perfect to burned pretty quickly in the last bit.

So it doesn't need to store vegetables in house . \n \n The reason why they cut Chicken tigh into pieces ( you cut meat diagonally to create more surface area & cut in bite size  pieces almost small black of sushi meat ) is because before they sear it , they sprinkle little bit of a sea salt that's gonna give taste into its meat itself and the chicken meat gets dehydrated slightly.  Then the left out moistures gets back & absorbed into the meat again with a touch of  salt taste .  \n\nthat's gives tenderizing effect & taste into the meat . Just like almost same concept of brining  the meat to create odorless , juicy tender meat  in Western countries . \n\n  When you just sear the whole chicken leg then it's gonna take time to cook it completely and got to make sure it is cooked throughout but it needs to be done tender . \n So , by cutting into pieces by diagonally with creating greater surface areas ensures  absorbtion of taste , faster cooking time , easier to  control for finishing it as tender as possible but can make sure cooked thoroughly easily .\n \nI don't know why but there are some science to this thing.

DC fluffiness/low density allows you to cover more surface area of the food with the same mass of salt relative to a denser crystal salt like standard table salt.

If measuring by volume you just double it. 1 tablespoon salt becomes 2 tablespoons diamond crystal. If measuring by weight there\u2019s no difference. In my opinion diamond crystal kosher is mostly useful for seasoning meat before cooking because you can spread the salt more evenly over the whole meat, It kind of turns to a powder as you pinch it between your fingers. It\u2019s not necessary at all though. Find a cheap sea salt and you will be good.", "Back in the day, Japan Tobacco had a monopoly on salt in Japan and everyone was using ordinary table salt. You don't need special salt for Japanese cooking.", "For most recipes, regular table salt is fine. Cooks Illustrated did a double blind taste test of Kosher salt vs table salt and nobody could tell the difference when they were dissolved. \n\nWhich makes sense, since salt is a very powerful seasoning and the amount of additives to table salt are a very small percentage. When people know which batch of something has Kosher salt, they create the conclusion they want, but under truly blind conditions it's pure guesswork.\n\nOne key thing to note is this won't be true when salt has a textural element. If there's something where you're sprinkling salt and you want crunchy crystals for some reason, use a bigger salt crystal than table salt. There are a few other edge cases where it matters, but very few.\n\nAnother thing to note for general cooking - such as adding salt to a sauce - you need to use the same weight of table salt as kosher. As other people have noted, a teaspoon of Kosher salt is less dense than table salt, so you have to adjust.\n\nThis is not to say there's anything irrational about preferring Kosher salt. A lot of cooking has to do with efficiency in your processes, so it makes sense to use Kosher if that's what you're used to.", "Let me guess, you're getting your recipes from Just One Cookbook? You don't have to use Diamond Kosher salt just because she recommends it. I use both sea salt and pink Himalayan in my recipes.

It has no iodine and the large crystals are perfect for salting everything from cabbage to salmon fillets. Most kosher salt is slightly finer and often flaked a little. It works but I find you need to apply it more sparingly depending on the dish. As for finishing salt (after you finish cooking) nothing beats Maldon sea salt\u2014the flakey texture really amps up a dish. I use smoked salts and rarely truffle salt too depending on the dish, but for most of my Japanese dishes I stick to the picking salt (it\u2019s cheaper too).", "Maldon. Any flakey salt really."]}

When heated to 85\u201395\u00b0C (185\u2013203\u00b0F)(water boils at 100\u00b0C/212\u00b0F), the hydrogen bonds unalign themselves creating a liquid form and disperses throughout the water.

The top layer of film you're getting is caused by the rapid cooling on the surface of the water.\n\nOr alternatively, it's not hot enough and trying to gel before you are done. In which case just turn up the heat! Highly recommend getting an electric thermometer that can instantly read back what temperature you are at. \n\nHope this helps and please give us an update when you lock this down!\n\nEDIT: Looking at your picture again it appears you have it on the lowest setting, so I'm inclined to think your mixture isn't hot enough and is gelling before you are finished.", "are you adding the agar when the water is cold or hot?", "instead of cups/tbsp, use scale and weight it?\n\nStart at half of tbsp of agar and keep other variables identical, weight everything, and slowly adjust agar amount to the consistency of your liking.", "Ok wild take but try to reserve some water from the recipe and melt the agar in it.\n\nMelt the sugar in the rest of the water.

Use Potato or Rice starch here; corn-starch doesn't really suit this dish.\nI use about the same volumetric amount as the sauce-mix, so the same small bowl.

I\u2019m pretty sure the only fermented vegetable is the beni shoga, which you can buy. Here\u2019s how I would recreate it:\n\n- soba: looks like standard soba with some wheat flour, just buy and follow the package directions for kake soba\n- dashi: kansai style, so something like 350 mL dashi, 50 mL mirin, 25 koikichi, 25 usukuchi, with oigatsuo technique. I\u2019m sure you could also make it kanto style by starting with a tare and thinning it with dashi, but I think kansai style is easier and probably more authentic in this case.\n- eggplant: fried, blanched to remove oil, then marinated in seasoned dashi. You can see some drops of oil in the final dish, so getting rid of all the oil is not so important\n- kinshi tamago: beaten egg with a pinch of salt, cooked in thin sheets in a skillet, then shredded with a knife\n- nameko mushrooms: buy from a can or packet, empty into a strainer, rinse to remove most of the slime\n- greens: I can\u2019t really tell which green this is, but any cooking green ohitashi would do\n- benishoga: this can also be bought packaged. Might need to be rinsed to make it a little more mild.\n\nI think that\u2019s it. Looks like a good, satisfying, balanced lunch.\n\nEdit: looks like there\u2019s one other element, either tenkasu (bits of fried tempura batter) or bubuarare (tiny round rice crackers). Either of these can be bought.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not 100% confident about the benishoga. If that\u2019s not benishoga, then I don\u2019t know what it is. Did it taste like a strong sweet/sour pickled ginger?\n\nEdit 3: [this](http://news.sobayoshi.com/?eid=1160353) seems to imply that there\u2019s a high-quality sesame oil used as a garnish, if so then that would be an important part of the flavor\n\nEdit 4: after a little more digging, it looks like this soba shop is known for mixing ground sesame seed into their soba dough. They have several locations around Osaka, and even an online shop where you can order their soba. So, not as easy as i thought at first. You could order their soba, or try making your own with some ground sesame mixed in.", "I wonder if the eggplant is just steamed/ boiled?", "Looks like Japanese eggplant, choy sum, shimeji mushrooms."]}

{"title": "Can I use rice starch to make mochi?", "selftext": "I've been looking for mochiko flour or glutinous rice flour for a while now but they're simply not available in my area and buying them online would mean paying a very high shipping cost and a very high cost for a generic product that I don't even know if it's any good. \n\nIn the past I tried with regular rice flour (I had followed a recipe that simply asked for rice flour without specifying that a specific rice flour was needed) but it has a totally different consistency from mochi and I immediately understood that it wasn't the right way (an online search confirmed my suspicion). \n\nA few months ago I got rice starch to create yudane to add to my pandoro recipe (in modern recipes it is used to improve the result) and tonight I had an enlightenment: use rice starch to make mochi.\n\nI just tried to microwave it with water and sugar (10g of rice starch, 20g of water, 10g of sugar... I'm not even sure that's the right amount) and I covered the result in a layer of rice starch and... I think it was the right consistency and the right texture and the right flavor... but it's been years since I tasted mochi so I'm not really sure.\n\nThe only thing that made me turn up my nose is the fact that rice starch does not remain white but becomes transparent, but it is also true that mochi are often colored and in any case covered with a layer of starch. It was certainly workable and stretchable as in the videos I saw regarding the use of glutinous rice flour. \n\nHas anyone ever tried it? \n\nIf so, do you think it is a valid alternative or do you think I am wrong and that the texture is actually very different? \n\nKeep in mind that rice starch is very easy to find for me so even if it were not a perfect substitute I would still be happy with it but if you think there are better options that I could have access to in Italy let me know (I do not have access to tapioca flour). \n\nObviously if you think that rice starch is completely wrong let me know in that case too.\n\nI tried to do an online search but I didn't find any information about it (is rice starch something common only in Italy?

Adjust flavor to your liking (more salt? Add soy sauce! More sweetness? Add sugar! Too sweet? Add vinegar and maybe soy sauce!).\n\n\n5.

{"title": "Japan domestic market rice cooker vs. made for export cooker", "selftext": "Japanese rice is one of our staple meal ingredients. The rice cooker in our kitchen is used almost daily.\n\nI recently visited Japan after a long absence. It\u2019s been around 15 years since I bought my last rice cooker there, a 1-litre IH type Zojirushi which still works well but the pot is scratched and I don\u2019t like the idea of consuming the coating a little bit at a time.\n\nI decided it would be a good idea to get another cooker and keep the old one as a backup or give it to someone else. \n\nWhile visiting recently I saw plenty of options for those who live in Europe (where I currently live) where the voltage is 200 to 220. However, the pots were thin and light and the cookers were not as \u201cfeature-full\u201d (they had fewer options/features). \n\nI decided to buy a JP domestic model and I do not regret it. I have a transformer which I have been using with the old cooker for a number of years. In fact the old cooker was also used in Canada for about ten years where the voltage is 110 to 120 at 60Hz. It was completely fine. \n\nSo for those who might think that they should buy the made-for-export models, I suggest you\u2019ll have a longer lasting cooker if you get a not-for-export model. Just know that your warranty is not extended outside of Japan and your transformer\u2019s power spec should be more than the wattage of the cooker.

Most of the new ones have pressure induction heating for precise temperature controls for different styles of rice and fluffiness. Many will have copper pots for fluffier rice too. The most visible difference will be fully electronic displays rather that printed on buttons and labels, which is what makes your pictured one look a bit retro.

Easy to load it up with veggies like carrots & broccoli, and in Japan is very kid-friendly.", "I don't quite remember if I ate all of these when I was I was preschool aged but you can try the following 'vegetable friendly' dishes that my mom used to make for me as a kid.  \n\n- Curry rice - carrots, potatoes, onions and some type of protein are standard but you can add other vegetables too, though some might be better as a topping after first flash frying rather then stewing in the curry.  Curry can also be topped with other proteins (tonkatsu, ebi fry, weiners, egg, etc). \n\n- Gyoza - My mom used to stick a lot of vegetables in there.  Hakusai (boiled first, moisture squeezed out), cabbage (boiled first like the Hakusai), grated carrot, nira/chives, scallions, ginger, garlic are what I remember off hand but there might have been other stuff.   Having your child help wrap can be fun.   \n\n- Ramen - Ramen as a kid was topped with pork, egg, wakame, menma/bamboo shoots, and a big serving of stir fried vegetables on top.  If there were left over gyoza, I'd have that on the side.  \n\n- Tempura - I loved anything that was made into tempura.  Chicken fish, seafood, any vegetable (sweet potato, carrot, asparagus, green beans, gobo/burdock root, renkon/lotus root etc), mushrooms, kakiage.  Plus leftovers can be used in Udon.   \n\n- Udon - If there were left over curry or tempura, those would go in the udon.  Otherwise I'd have egg, fried tofu, wakame seaweed.  \n\n- Yakisoba / Yaki Udon - Stir fried noodles with a protein(s) and lots of vegetables were the norm.  \n\n- Spaghetti Napolitan - Yes, I loved and still love anything with a noodle.  It's a ketchup flavor based spaghetti that usually has peppers, onions, mushrooms, sausage/ham or other protein.  Plus cheese on top for the calcium.  Foreigners often balk at the idea of using ketchup but the sweet, sour taste is delicious in my opinion, especially for kids.  \n\n- Tonkatsu - Really anything breaded and fried like Ebi Fry, Kaki/oyster Fry, Aji/fish Fry.  You can also fry up vegetables the same way while you're at it (onion rings, carrot, zucchini though this can get watery, asparagus etc).  Put these on a skewer and you have kushikatsu / kushiage.  \n\n- Hamburg - Either an all beef or pork/beef blend.  I would get onion, grated carrot in mine.  \n\n- Miso Soup - Served at almost every evening meal if rice was served.  Miso soup can have anything in there.  Spinach, eggplant, cabbage,'Kenchin' which has a lot of root vegetables, 'butajiru' which has pork and lots of vegetables, etc.  Asari and shijimi/clam broth is also delicious.  \n\n- Harumaki - Spring Rolls.  A Chinese dish but you can put a ton of vegetables in it.  \n\n- Nabe / Hot pot - More of a winter food and honestly, not my favorite growing up (now I love it) but you can put any protein(s), mushrooms and vegetables in a nabe.  My favorite though was after everyone was done eating, you'd end up with a delicious broth which was used to make rice porridge or noodles.  \n\n- Okonomiyaki - We didn't have this often but you can put almost anything in it.\n\n- Potato Salad - Japanese potato salad often has things like carrots, ham, cucumbers, onions.   \n\n- Nimono - stewed/braised ingredients, usually with vegetables that hold up to the long cooking.  Pumpkin, root vegetables, hijiki etc.  Not my favorite growing up but maybe your child will be different.", "My 2 and 4 year olds fight over [ginger pork](https://www.justonecookbook.com/ginger-pork-shogayaki/) with side salad of green cabbage sliced paper thin on a mandolin and dressed with sesame oil and salt, served with rice (and a panoply of furikake flavors).\n\n\nNYT has a recipe for it (yamitsuke - addictive cabbage, not linking because of the shameless paywall), but one of my kids is sensitive to raw garlic, and IMO it\u2019s not necessary. \n\n\nIf your kids eat wings, [these wings are also top notch.](https://www.justonecookbook.com/teba-shio-salted-chicken-wings/) I serve this with steamed broccolini [gomaae](https://www.justonecookbook.com/spinach-with-sesame-sauce/) and rice. \n\n\nAnd both my kids love Japanese style egg and tuna salad sandos on white bread.

And Benihana.", "Words shift and change as they get borrowed into other languages.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a definitive answer to why the word *hibachi* replaced *teppanyaki* when referring to American style teppanyaki restaurants, but it appears likely that Benihana was indeed the originator of the usage. It seems likely that the Japanese founder of the restaurant decided to call the style of cooking \"hibachi-style\" because it would be easier to Americans to pronounce as opposed to teppanyaki.\n\nAs for the technicality of *hibachi* vs *teppanyaki*, sure it's important to be clear in the specific contexts you are using the words (for example, for clarity's sake, it'd be better to say *teppanyaki* if talking to a Japanese native who's not familiar with American hibachi restaurants), but usage of loanwords in many  languages is often very different from the originating language, and that doesn't make those usages any less correct in language they've been borrowed into, as long as a general consensus on that meaning has been established.\n\nLoanwords in Japanese that originate from English very frequently do this, perhaps even much more so than the other way around. For example, the word \u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 *manshon*, which is derived from the English word *mansion*, refers to a highrise apartment building, not a large western style wealthy house, which would instead be called a *seiy\u014dkan* \u897f\u6d0b\u9928 or *yashiki* \u5c4b\u6577\n\nFor a food-centric word, an amusing one is that in Japan, they often refer to buffets as \u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 baikingu, which is a loanword from the English *Viking*, i.e. the scandinavian seafaring peoples.\n\nThere are many many other examples of these sorts of [gairaigo and wasei-eigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gairaigo_and_wasei-eigo_terms) terms too.", "Same reason in Japanese cooler is used for AC or potato fry is chips or fries.

Unfortunately the name of the restaurant has situated itself into common vocabulary, in those communities with that restaurant, as \u2018Japanese food cooked at the table\u2019.  \n\nJapanese-speakers and people biased towards correctness will recognize the oddness because: \n\n* hibachi = a type of old style charcoal bbq grill.\n* teppanyaki = the actual name of the cooking style of grilling on a tabletop.", "It's an eponym!

I\u2019d love to make just the basic ones!", "Sure, I can teach you easy way to make this at home. We have a certain seasoning packet you can buy at any Japanese grocer (including online) called Chahan mix. Cook your sushi rice in a rice cooker and when it is done you put half of it on frying pan or wok with a tiny bit of sesame oil and the mix. Just for one or two minutes. You can add Aji mirin if you want, too. For flavor and added stickiness. Make your fried rice and add it to the half of non fried rice and mix, this will help sustain the stickiness needed for shaping your onigiri. Let your rice cool in a bowl or wooden oke. You then get a small clean bowl of water and make it salty. This is for your hands and for flavoring the onigiri as you shape it. Don\u2019t over due on the salt because you already use chahan mix to season the rice, only use more salt for when making shiso onigiri with umeboshi. Otherwise it will be too much. \n\nThe salty water keeps the rice from sticking to your hands and you can also use an onirigi mold to shape but I don\u2019t recommend those little plastic ones as the rice sticks inside and the flap to push the mold out tends to ruin it if not done carefully. Wooden mold doesn\u2019t have this problem. \n\nWhen you are first scooping the rice into your wet hands you form a ball and press your thumb to the center to create a groove to add your filling, then add a bit of rice on top to seal the filling as you continue to shape it into a triangle. If you are using a mold, just shove the rice into the mold and make an indent with your thumb, add your filling and then top it off with more rice and press down into the mold to keep it all together, then release from mold and gently but firmly press as you add the nori to seal it.\n\nFor making yaki onigiri, before the nori step, slightly coat one side of the onirigi with sesame oil and add to a fryer or pan. I\u2019ve successfully made these with an air fryer too. When it is golden brown, flip, add oil to the other side and repeat. Yaki onigiri is crispy so if you want nori with it, I find it easiest to cut the toasted nori into the size I need and coat one side with Aji mirin to allow it to adhere a bit better to the crispy onigiri, but don\u2019t soak it.", "you can try the takikomi gohan route instead of actually doing fried rice or just seasoning the rice before forming into onigiri", "You might also try Okinawa style onigiri.\nIt\u2019s like a toasted rice patty sandwich.

I think it's about consistency and convenience.  You just put in washed rice, fill to the line for the type of rice you're using, push a button, and the rice will come out perfect every time without any intervention.  Then afterwards the rice will be kept at the proper temperature to make sure it doesn't go mushy, doesn't grow bacteria, and remains at a good temperature to eat for a couple of days.\n\nSince rice is also eaten in the morning in Japan, the timer function of rice cookers is also a great way to ensure that you have freshly cooked rice the moment you wake up.  So for some families, they can load up the rice cooker the night before, then wake up to freshy cooked rice that they can eat throughout the day then repeat the cycle.\n\nIf you're just making Japanese food every once in a while, then making it in a pot is fine.  If you want to be fancier you can get a donabe which is a clay pot.  I would only get a rice cooker if you want to make rice a daily staple.", "Basmati rice is easier to cook in a pot than the usual Japanese rice varieties. The rice cooker makes it a lot simpler and is meant to keep rice warm for the whole day for convenience. Rice is a daily staple. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to get sticky rice if you use the wrong type of rice. Use short grain rice or a japonica variant. (If you are based in India, Calrose, an American-grown japonica, is less accessible, so find whatever japonica type is locally available.)\n\nThe rice package should come with directions. Follow those directions.", "I\u2019m Indian and my family has used a rice cooker for my entire life.", "I can\u2019t answer the \u201cwhy\u201d part of your question but thought you might appreciate [this deep dive](https://youtu.be/IjjdAheuNKs?si=ezLplXU9Yuuk94Fb) into rice cooking methods.", "a rice cooker is convenient; all u have to do is push the start button. cooking rice on the stove top means u have to pay attention to the pot, making sure the rice doesn't burn or the pot doesn't boil over.", "A Japanese rice cooker approximates the way that rice was traditionally made in a [kamodo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamado). In a kamodo, the heat surrounds the pot in a way boiling or steaming on top of the stove does not. Very few Japanese homes today have a kamodo. Some people do continue to make rice on the stovetop in a pot, or in a Japanese clay pot called a [donabe](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donabe), which also conveys heat differently than other types of pots on the stovetop. \n\nAlso, the types of rice used in Japan and India are different, and use different cooking techniques to bring out the characteristics valued by each culture. Rice in traditional Indian dishes is served differently than rice in traditional Japanese dishes, and the variety of rice and cooking techniques differ accordingly. \n\nOn top of the pot (edit: rice cooker) somewhat mimicking the kamodo, it\u2019s very convenient, as others have already mentioned. Not only is your rice ready as soon as you wake up, your rice will be kept warm to be sure that no matter what time members of the family eat breakfast or arrive home for dinner, they can have hot rice with their meal. \n\nFinally, Japanese stove tops generally have either two or three burners to cook on. Having an appliance that steams your rice the way you like it off to the side and unattended while you make other dishes keeps things less cluttered around your cooktop.\n\nEdited again to include a link with instructions for [cooking rice on the stovetop](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-cook-rice/), since you asked for tips :-). That site has lots of great information on making Japanese food, so poke around. It should be very helpful!", "To replicate a rice cooker on the stovetop, you need to... pay attention and be careful about temperatures and keep an eye on it and stir every so often but don't let the steam escape and blah blah blah.  To replicate a stovetop on the rice cooker, you need to... push a button.  If you're going to make rice multiple times a day, you're going to want to push the button, not spend half an hour hovering over the stove.  So I just made rice for lunch today.  I used American Japanese-style rice (because that's what I bought last time I was out of rice); I took a measuring cup and poured two half-cup-fuls into the rice cooker.  I added some sand ginger powder (it's a kind of unique flavor which I like) and a fresh bay leaf, poured in a little bit of Sichuan rapeseed oil (that stuff's delicious), poured in three half-cup-fuls of water (a bit too much but I wanted it mushier today), and I squeezed three calamansi limes into the rice for a bit of extra freshness (before the calamansis go bad without me having used them).  Can you tell I bought a bunch of stuff from the Asian grocery store recently?  I put the lid on, plugged the rice cooker in, and pushed the button, and I wiped the measuring cup and put it back in the drawer.  I only used it for rice and then water, so it's still clean.  Then I went to make my main dish, which was yesterday's leftover ground beef plus some mushrooms and cilantro to thin it out since I made it way too salty yesterday somehow.  That was really quick, so when it was done, I washed up the rest of the utensils I used while waiting for the rice to finish.  It finished, I plated, I ate, I put the rest of the rice in an airtight container in the fridge, I washed the rice cooker bowl and lid.  And that's why you use the rice cooker.  It's so simple!\n\nI learned to make rice on the stovetop about 20 years ago.  I was living in an apartment with a kitchen for the first time, so my dad taught me his Brazilian-style method.  I vaguely remember: olive oil in pot, fry half a white onion, diced (oh, I did *not* know how to dice an onion at that point, let's be clear), put in rice and toss in the oil, put in twice the amount of water as rice, boil the water, add salt and half a bouillon cube, lower the heat to simmer, cover, wait 20 minutes without touching it.  This is absolutely great for burning rice directly onto your pot where it will never come off again; I love it.  When I met my wife, I learned the blessings of the rice cooker.  Life is SO MUCH EASIER with a rice cooker if you make rice often.  I don't know about in India, but here in the US you can get a cheap one with a stainless steel bowl (my wife doesn't do nonstick) for, like, $30.  You don't need to shell out hundreds for a Zojirushi.  I don't know what's available in India, but I bet you can get something similarly cheap, especially if there's a Chinese store near you (I don't know how common those are there).  And I bet you greatly improve your usual Indian rice with it too!", "Convenience...there was NOT a single dinner (sometimes even lunch) we didn't have rice.  I'm Chinese, grew up in Hong Kong.  I now live in the US...never without a rice cooker.  \n\nYou can most certainly cook rice in a pot...and with practice you can get to the same kind of consistency as a rice cooker.  A rice cooker just takes out any \"skill\" as long as the water to rice ratio is correct.  \n\nJust about any rice will work with a rice cooker...it's a matter of how much liquid you use.  I just did a pot of basmati a couple of nights ago\ud83d\ude03", "Wait\u2026 once it\u2019s cooked it can stay at that temperature for days???", "Japanese (and Korean) people eat short grained rice which is different from long grain rice\n\nYou can cook short grain rice in a pot but if you do it right some of it will stick to the bottom which is kinda a hassle", "The difference is in the type of rice. Ask friends overseas to do an experiment for you (one Indian and one CJKV) and cook with the 4 combinations:\n- Indian rice in Indian cooking vessel\n- CJKV rice in rice cooker\n- The cross combination\n\nThis experiment matrix can be done in 4-8 hours\n\nI say overseas bc IIRC the East Asian rice is harder to find in India , and you may pick the wrong kind (since you didn\u2019t, prior to this thread, have awareness of the different rice types). While if you get an Indian person and a CJKV person to pick their respective rice there won\u2019t be a f- up unless they don\u2019t know how to cook", "Because rice cookers are consistent and work fine and you don\u2019t have to do all the messing around. I had been making sushi for years , at my favourite sushi joint, I really loved their rice . One day I asked if I could pay for a rice cooking class with their chef , because their rice was so good. The boss looked at me and said we use this Korean rice in a rice cooker 50/50 rice and water , rice rinsed 10 times. That\u2019s it . I was blown away! Now I have used rice cookers exclusively and would never go back", "Because it\u2019s easier. You press a button and voila. There are also different types and textures you can make and it keeps rice heated for long periods after it\u2019s done without losing moisture. In a word: convenience. Some people still make rice in a pot, but you\u2019re wasting time and resources.", "Cooking Indian Basmati, Chinese/South East Asian Long Grain, and Korean/Japanese Short Grain are indeed very different. I once saw an Indian literally boil Basmati Rice like boiling pasta, then drain it also like pasta. Japanese/Korean culture does not cook rice like that. It is boiled, then steamed slowly off until that gives it that \u201csticky\u201d character, although it is a more complex texture, that you are talking about. This steaming technique is very precise and complicated, it requires practice. It is much easier to use a machine controlled by fuzzy logic, early AI, that is easy and safe for even children to use.", "We use rice cooker (in our home we specifically use zojirushi rice cooker which is most popular in Japan ) because when we make rice we have a wide variety of rices we make and some that require infusions during the steaming, for example when we make chestnut rice ( kuri gohan ) sticky gluten rice, or multigrain rice like takikomi gohan. The steaming cooks the other ingredients without compromising the rice. Also the type of rice is more stickier than other Asian rices, but we still use the zojirushi for making basmati and jasmine rice. It is more convenient and more energy efficient to have a rice cooker. It also evenly cooks the rice to just the right way it is supposed to be. We rinse the rice a couple of times before cooking too. I am very picky about my rice, and bad rice is for me, it ruins the whole meal. \n\nI can taste the difference between quality rices and different species of rice easily. Rice cooker also usually comes with a paddle for cooling and serving, and the inner bowl is non stick and gives exact measurements so it is just easier to use one for a lot of reasons. I think mochi makers still boil the rice and steam it over open fire at festivals, and pound it with mallets to release the gluten. People don\u2019t do this at home though. We just buy the premade mochi and that type of mochi made from sticky gluten rice, is not the same kind of mochi we make daifuku from. That is generally made with sticky rice flour and is not pounded mochi. We use pounded mochi for things like zojirushi or yakimochi, or for like new years and other things but it\u2019s not the same. Oh also these days, zojirushi does have a mochi machine for home use too, so some people like to steam their own sticky rice and transfer it to the mochi making appliance. So as I\u2019ve explained there are several good reasons for why we use rice cooker. But for me, since I am a shufu (house wife) the best part of having a rice cooker is that I can ready the rice at 3 am and go back to bed. When my husband wakes up for work it is done and he can make his ochazuke for breakfast.", "Why would you make rice in a stove in a pot? It\u2019s not 1945! Do you bake your own bread, grind your own flour, or churn your own butter? Most people don\u2019t because it\u2019s too time-consuming in a busy world. Rice requires a hard boil, a long reduction in heat, then a final steaming period to be properly cooked so it is fluffy and not sticky. It\u2019s demanding. With an electric cooker you get consistent results every time and all you have to do is push a button. \n\nPlus, I\u2019ve seen the \u201crice\u201d my American SIL makes her American family: it\u2019s a solid quart of boiled white mush caked in the pan. It\u2019s the most disgusting thing I have seen in my life but my nephew loves it! \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBTW the rice cooker was started by a pair of Japanese inventors in the 1940s, then abandoned because executives \u201cdidn\u2019t want to encourage lazy housewives\u201d, then an engineer\u2019s wife found the prototype and invented the first electric rice cooker, saving millions of woman-hours slaving over a wood-fired stove steaming rice. She should have won a Nobel Prize, in my opinion!\n\nEdit: reread and OP is Indian. Indian rice is long grain or medium grain and many types are drier, less starchy, and more porous than short rice. That makes sense because Indian cuisine is heavy on sauces and butter that would soak into the rice. East Asian short grain rice is very starchy, which means it does not absorb as much fluid from other food and tends to retain its sweet flavor and chewiness in soups and curries. I tried making Indian rice in a cooker and it was very dry. Spanish long grain rice is also prepared by boiling and frying. Different types of rice require different types of cooking.", "First, you have to use the correct rice. You can buy sushi rice if you are making sushi but for regular eating, my personal favorite is to mix 50-50 Thai Jasmine and Korean or Japanese short-grain rice. Thai Jasmine for the fragrance, short grain for nuttiness.\n\nSecond, you must rinse a few times so that the rice is clean tasting and fluffy.\n\nWithout a rice cooker, you can get close with a pot. I think my ratio is 1:1.5 well-drained rice to water, which is less water than what basmati takes. Bring to boil with the rice in it and then reduce to a very small simmer. Lid the whole time, Preferably glass. The very gentle simmer is just the steam process, don't lift the lid, it will be ready when the rice looks cooked + no more water bubbles boiling up between the grains. After that you can stir the rice to fluff it - shouldn't need much though, I always skip this."]}
