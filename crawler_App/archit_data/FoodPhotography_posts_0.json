The place is known for its large windows and natural light, so she wanted the photos to reflect that. The day of the shoot was terribly snowy and cloudy, so luckily I had my strobe packed with me. The photos were all taken with my Fuji X-T1 and my Fujinon 60mm macro lens at roughly 1/180 and f16-f20. It's a great lens and pretty much never leaves my camera body. I also used my Neewer Vision 4 strobe at 1/1 power roughly 10 feet away from the \"set\" in order to capture those long hard shadows typically cast by the sun in this space. \n\nThanks for taking the time to look!", "Super nice, would only take down a bit those highlights \ud83d\udcaa", "Love some of the composition with the green background!", "Good job.
