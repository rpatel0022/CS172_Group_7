{"title": "Paneer of Pettiness", "selftext": "I've gotten so many requests for this. I'm touched. :)\n\nThis is the paneer I make when I want to eat paneer tikka masala or saag paneer. If I want to make Gulab Jamun I make a different paneer.\n\n**You will need:**\n\nFull cream/Whole milk (1 gallon)\n\nLemon juice (1/2 cup)\n\nIce cubes (optional)\n\nCheesecloth\n\nColander/Strainer\n\nYou can halve the ingredients if you like.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\nBoil milk in pot with lid on. Continuously check on it to ensure that the milk does not burn. As the milk starts to boil add the lemon juice and stir. It should start curdling immediately and don\u2019t worry if it changes colour slightly. Yellow/green discoloration is common. Keep stirring so it doesn\u2019t stick to the pot. After it is completely curdled, turn off the heat and allow the mixture to sit and cool for 5-10 minutes. You can add ice cubes to make the cooling process faster, but it isn't necessary.\n\nWhile it cools, take cheesecloth, line the strainer with it and place it over a large bowl. Pour the mixture into the cheesecloth. The whey (liquid) should strain into the bowl. The curds should remain in the cheesecloth.\n\nGather the cheesecloth in your hands and rinse under running cold water. Then gently squeeze to get rid of liquid from the curds. Knot the cheesecloth with the curds in it at the top and hang it from your faucet to let it drain into the sink further for 20-30 minutes. Then place it on a plate, untie the knot on the cheesecloth and lay it flat over the curd. Place another plate on top of the curd. Place another heavy object on the plate. I generally stack plates on the curd and put a small sack of rice/large bottle of oil on top to weigh it down. Let it be for an hour or so. Cut it up and use immediately or put it in the fridge. I recommend putting it into the fridge immediately. It really helps to firm it up. Done!\n\nThis is probably really similar to some of the recipes already on the internet. This is my first time writing a recipe so I hope it\u2019s clear enough! Don\u2019t get discouraged if your first time doesn\u2019t turn out as well as you want it to.

It is *delicious* and my go-to comfort food. I would kill to be able to adequately cook it at home, but unfortunately I don\u2019t have the magic (or the knowledge) so the local Indian spots receive my money quite often. \n\nYour MIL is *nuts* for passing up the chance to enjoy your cooking. I\u2019ll be trying out your recipe, but I almost hope I fail, because if I unlock the ability to make quality paneer at home, it is OVER for any weight loss plans I have."]}
{"title": "Irish stew with soda bread good enough to make my MIL mad at me.", "selftext": "Posted about this recipe quite a bit now, after it caused in-law related drama over on JustNoMIL, which has ended with MIL being on an indefinite time out. Enough people asked me about it that I thought I'd share here. I did some thinking and the woman who gave me this recipe, my Nanny Maureen, would be alright with me sharing her recipe here, but not her secret ingredient, so here's the recipe for a nearly perfect Irish stew, as I'm afraid Nanny Maureen would come back to life and kill me for sharing the secret.\n\nDisclaimer: Measurements aren't exact but I can take some guesses, and most is according to what your taste is. Carrots are used here but aren't necessary, and can be switched out with whatever veg you want, or no veg at all. I'm told you can just buy lamb stock so feel free, but the recipe includes making your own. I highly recommend the recipe as it is, though, but that's probably because I grew up with it.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* A few lamb necks and some lamb shoulder or rump (making friends with your local butcher is not necessary, but strongly encouraged). You can just make the whole thing with neck if you want, but I prefer to get a few different cuts. It depends on how much stew you're making, but you'll want around 1 neck per litre of water.\n* Bag of potatoes (I prefer red but Nanny always used King Edward)\n* Carrots and onions (when I asked how many she always said \"you'll know\" so it's however many feels right to you on a spiritual level).\n* Pinch of thyme, a bit of celery (I never use more than half a stick but I don't like celery), a bay leaf, a few sprigs of parsley and a dash of pepper. Chives to be used at your discretion.\n* Equal amounts of wholemeal and plain flour, and 1.5x buttermilk (when nan taught me it was about 200g of each flour and 300ml of buttermilk, although she measured it with a pint glass), sprinkle of salt, pinch of bicarbonate of soda.\n\nTo make the stock- Separate the bones from the neck and chuck them in a pot of water, along with 1 sliced carrot, 1 diced onion, and herbs and let it simmer on a low-ish heat for a few hours. For best results let it sit overnight, but this isn't necessary. Sieve it and chuck out the solid bits, so you just have the liquid left, then heat it to reduce it. (I always make more than I'll need because this can be freezed for a few months and saves me making it again)\n\nFor the stew - heat the stock until it's just shy of boiling, chop up what's left of the lamb meat (neck, shoulder, rump, whatever), and seal it off in a saucepan before putting it in the stock. Reduce heat, simmer and cover for about 15 mins. Chop up remaining potatoes, carrots, and onion, then add all that plus the seasonings to the stock. Just go for it with the seasoning, add all you want, but for the love of all that is Holy, taste as you go (I've seen too many people fuck up at this stage by bunging in too much to start off with). More simmering until the lamb is cooked through. Then take it off the heat and cover, don't stir again until serving. It lasts a couple days and if you keep it in the fridge you can reheat it, but be reasonable.\n\nFor the bread - put all the dry stuff in a bowl, gradually add buttermilk, stirring as you go with a fork until it looks like bread dough. If it's too sticky add either flour, too dry add a splash of normal cow milk, but if you need more than that then use the buttermilk, it just needs to look like dough. Knead it, but only a little (really easy to overdo it but you still need to knead it a bit). Roll into a ball-shaped loaf, cut a cross on the top, bake for half an hour on about 200C/400F. There's no yeast so there's no rising time, and you can make it while the stew is simmering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd there you go. It's not particularly difficult but there's a lot of technical stuff (especially the bread) and most of the cooking time is just waiting for it to simmer.\n\nSl\u00e1inte!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/justnorecipes/comments/cndbw0/irish_stew_with_soda_bread_good_enough_to_make_my/", "created_utc": 1565220079.0, "score": 687, "author": "None", "num_comments": 114, "permalink": "/r/justnorecipes/comments/cndbw0/irish_stew_with_soda_bread_good_enough_to_make_my/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Hope you didn't give the racist cuntbag anything.", "Thank you.

As soon as the sugar starts to melt, use a heat-proof spatula to move it constantly around the pan \u2014 you want it all to melt and caramelize easily. Cook until a deep amber, 3-5 minutes. Once the caramel is all melted, remove from heat and stir in the nuts. Immediately pour onto sheet pan and spread as thin as possible. Work quickly, as it will begin to set in less than a minute.  \n Let cool completely.\n\nBreak the brittle in a zip top plastic bag with a rolling pin or meat grinder or break into pieces and pulse in a food processor until the size of short-grain rice. Store in an air-tight container, and use remaining brittle from this recipe within a month.\n\n**Peanut Butter Cookies**\n\nIngredients:\n\n\u00b7 12 Tbsp (1.5 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n\n\u00b7 1 1/2 cups sugar\n\n\u00b7 1/4 cup glucose1 syrup (use 2 Tbsp corn syrup in a pinch, *but the consistency will be compromised*)\n\n\u00b7 1 cup creamy peanut butter\n\n\u00b7 2 eggs\n\n\u00b7 1/8 tsp vanilla extract\n\n\u00b7 1 1/3 cup or 225g **bread** flour \n\n\u00b7 1/2 tsp baking powder\n\n\u00b7 1/8 tsp baking soda\n\n\u00b7 2 1/4 tsp kosher salt\n\n\u00b7 1/2 recipe peanut brittle\n\n1. Cream together: \n\n\u00b7 butter \n\n\u00b7 sugar \n\n\u00b7 glucose \n\nin the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. \n\n2. Fold in:\n\n\u00b7 peanut butter\n\n\u00b7 eggs\n\n\u00b7 vanilla \n\nand beat for 30 seconds on medium-high speed. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and then paddle on medium-high speed for 3 minutes. During this time, the sugar granules will dissolve, and the creamed mixture will double in size.\n\n3. Separately, mix all dry ingredients:\n\n\u00b7 flour \n\n\u00b7 baking powder \n\n\u00b7 baking soda\n\n\u00b7 salt \n\nSlowly add the dry mix to the creamed mixture just until the dough comes together, and the dry ingredients have just combined into the wet; no longer than 1 minute.

Using a 1.5 oz ice cream scoop, portion out the dough onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Pat the tops of the cookie domes flat. Wrap the sheet pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 1 week. As with any butter-based cookie, do *not* bake your cookies from room temperature \u2013 they will not hold shape faster than they bake.\n\n6. Heat the oven to 375\u00b0. Arrange the chilled dough at least 4 inches apart on parchment or Silpat lined sheets. Bake for 18 minutes. The cookies will puff, crackle and spread. Bake until tan with auburn specks throughout. Cool completely on sheet pans before transferring to a plate or an airtight container for storage. At room temperature, cookies will keep fresh for 5 days, or 1 month if frozen.\n\n*Footnote:*\n\n*1* Glucose: Never used glucose before? You\u2019ve surely eaten it. It\u2019s in most commercially produced sweets as it\u2019s more shelf-stable and cheaper than most sweetening agents. \u2018Glucose\u2019 is typically pointing at glucose syrup from grapes, not corn syrup, so read the container before purchasing.

Adding butter *and* peanut butter makes all the difference!\nI won't go back to crumbly cookies after discovering this secret a few years ago!", "Commenting to save, thank you!", "Jeesus, no wonder they aren't dry, it's 2/3 sugar and Fat \ud83d\ude02\n\nLooks amazing.", "Oh making these asap", "May I ask, what is the difference between the two recipes?", "*Ball dough and dip into sugar*\n\nWhat does this mean?  Do we reserve some white sugar for rolling?", "I have all the ingredients, I am so going to make this!", "My mother used to make some like these from a cookbook series Calling All Cooks BellSouth put out an installment of each year from their customers favorite recipes if I remember correctly.

I'm going to send this to my son & daughter so they can have it to pass on too!", "I have had this saved foreeever, forgot about it because I rarely cook or bake, and just found it again. I'm debating making them this weekend for my father's birthday, but I don't know how many cookies they make and I'm nowhere near experienced enough to tell by ingredient amount. If you're still around.. how many cookies does this make?"]}
