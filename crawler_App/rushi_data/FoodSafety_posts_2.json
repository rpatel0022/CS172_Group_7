A lot of the answers that you were referring to are not exactly saying \"You will get X\" but are more geared towards \"You are at higher risk for X if you consume this\". The problem with food safety is you simply don't know all the factors, so you have to make rules which cover as much as possible. \n\nI've worked in restaurants and in food production on a large scale. A majority of places are actually doing it right and care about the safety of their customers, it's the exception typically that don't. One of the biggest factors I've found in those that don't is they simply **don't know what they don't know**. \n\nLet's take the berry example. \n\nSay I've gone my whole life buying berries from the store, and a friend invited me to go berry picking. We go, I get some excellent berries, then leave them out. A few days go by and my brain suddenly remembers every berry I've ever had in my life has been refrigerated or frozen. Are the berries I picked still safe? I don't know. I Google it, and I find a bunch of mommy blogs and recipe websites with conflicting information. It's like WebMD but everything has botulism and salmonella. \n\nSo that's where we come in. We try to help us best we can but ultimately we don't have a group of approved users to answer questions. Everyone is allowed to answer and we do our best to monitor the answers and try to boost the correct one.\n\nWe aren't here to scare anyone, we are here to give the dangers possible and the recommended rules. Outside of that, everyone is free to take our advice or leave it.\n\nEdit: I keep seeing comments that say we've removed the post, but we have not.", "Perhaps, but food safety systems are constructed that way.

Where I work currently, we produce maybe about 5 million saleable units a week - so if one of our processes has even a 1 in a million chance of causing illness, that's unacceptable. \n\nIt needs to be impossible, not low risk, for bacteria to grow when you're feeding that many people. This is the approach that I imagine a lot of people answering on here are used to taking.", "I don\u2019t think the sub itself is fear mongering.

And they compete just like plants and animals do. It's possible your tortilla stack has been colonized by two or more species, and the center mold is out-competing the ring mold. Fungi also engage in chemical warfare, producing toxic stews to kill competing species. It's how we got the first antibiotic, penicillin. It was invented by microbes, to kill other microbes. There may even be more than 2 species present, but not visible to the naked eye.\n\nIt might seem weird, but many bacteria and fungi like many of the same foods we do, for the same reasons: they are nutrient- and calorie-dense. They are literally eating your tortillas, just like you would. So you have a fat stack of free calories there (they don't have to go far to get more food), and any mold spores floating in the air that happened to land on them before they got sealed up pretty much hit the jackpot. Just about everything in your fridge is getting snacked on by microbes.

You might have gotten a big cluster of spores landing on them or they might have already had a colony growing when you bought them (more likely).\n\nYou can eat all of the tortillas. The question is how sick you will get. We eat mold every day, because almost everything you eat has some on it. It's just that most of it has such small numbers that your body doesn't even notice. So the \"clean\" tortillas also have mold and probably had mold since the day they were cooked. Will you get noticeable symptoms from eating them? That depends on how much mold, how strong your immune system is, and the exact composition of your gut microbiome. We don't know the answers to that and cannot possibly know with our current technology. The safe thing to do is to toss it all. If you are very desperate and hungry, you can roll the dice.

Especially for people who are immune compromised, or older, or younger. This increased risk is usually a result of some break in the cold chain, or other processes that we've created to make food more safe. Not every rule is designed to assume that the previous step was done perfectly. Some of the rules, at least the official ones, are designed with the possibility that something has failed. I remember in the early 2000s in Seattle I had to sign a waiver to get a rare burger. It blew my mind, but if memory service there was an outbreak of something going on.\n\nUltimately the recommendations and official guidelines give you what is safest, and going outside of that carries some inherent risk.

Vacuum sealing is most successful for freezing, not to prevent food from spoiling in the fridge for long periods of time. I think it\u2019s less than two weeks before most meats needs frozen! Smell will be the determining factor here. If it smells at all funky, cheesy, sour (I\u2019m accepting other descriptors) I would not eat it.", "You should ask a butcher, my local meat place says their vacuum sealed meat is good for months in the fridge like this. Personally I always freeze it anyways because thats just what makes me comfortable.", "Honestly that looks great for being so far out of date.  No gas production, no off-color, no extra liquid.  I suggest reading this article on bacterial growth in vacuum-sealed meats:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3768908/\n\nParticularly this part:\n\n>Vacuum-packaged meats are generally quite stable at low temperatures (43). While the shelf life of meat that is packaged with films that are highly permeable to oxygen is approximately one week, the shelf life of vacuum-packaged meat is around ***3 to 12 weeks***, when stored at 0 \u00b0C (29, 17). Low temperatures prolong the storage time of meat; however, the lowest temperature that can be used without the product freezing (\u22121.5\u00b0C) is higher than the minimum temperature for the growth of some psychrotrophic bacteria. Preventing growth of these organisms requires freezing (36). Despite the increased shelf life, fresh meat packed under vacuum will deteriorate after some time.\n\nThe consistent temperature of your fridge is what matters here.  The back tends to stay the most stable, and if it was forgotten about due to health issues, my guess is that the fridge wasn't getting opened much anyways?\n\nPeople here worried about botulism seem to have forgotten the part where it requires ***at least*** 38\u00b0F environmental temps.  If your fridge consistently stays where it should (between 33-36\u00b0F), the risk is infinitesimal.  In the article I posted above, clostridium botulinum was not present in any tested meat, all of which were deteriorated/bad.\n\nThis is a decision you'll have to make.  Not all bacteria off-gas, but those that don't tend to cause physical changes to the meat.  Personally, I would open it, smell it, touch it, etc.  A cut that expensive was ideally handled better than a regular roast, and given the specific conditions it was kept in, I'd say it would be worth the risk for me.", "EHO here - Vacuum packed goods are okay for 10 days max usually, unless the packaging specifically states otherwise. 2.5 months is far too long and you\u2019ll be playing with fire.

{"title": "7 days ago I made a post about my department managers brother contaminating a whole tub of ready to eat pico with shrimp. I reported them to the health department for that and the manager spraying pico tomatoes with Clorox and selling room temperature reduced salads. Here\u2019s the link to past post. ", "selftext": "\nILLINOIS: https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/s/mXTbbPgiKw\n\nThis past Thursday a health inspector showed up about 4 or 5 days after I filed the complaint and was questioning my department and putting the screws to him. I I heard my department head tell the guy \u201call this is lies\u201d. Guy was here for a while left to write a report and came back. Department heads brother(the one who contaminated pico) hid the room temperature salad cart. I went and grabbed it and he came up to me and was like hey my brother said to throw this away. I said no I\u2019m gonna go show the inspector and ask him. Department manager and inspector were talking when I walked up and showed him and asked him and told him what we do. He said it\u2019s a no go to leave it out for more than 4 hours. I proceeded to tell him we wheel it out at 7am or so and it sits till maybe 7:30-8 at night. Every day. The Inspector said how Incorrect it was and told my boss to throw it all away after he counted it. Cart has maybe 25-30 salads in there. Should of seen my department heads face. His eyes were bugging out he was so mad. I overheard him and the store manager saying it had to be me or my other coworker who called the health department.\n\nLater when he came back from his report my boss was on lunch and he asked me a few things about the shrimp and if I\u2019ve seen him pour bleach water into the cooler ventilation systems directly next to fresh fruit, I told him yes and he left again to add to his report lol. My boss isn\u2019t talking to me anymore and when he does he\u2019s aggressive in telling me what to do.\n\n\nToday my store manager looked troubled all day and pulled me into his office. He Told me the department head said he doesn\u2019t want to work with me and the owners said they\u2019re okay with that. He told me in the event the department head goes to him or them and wants me gone that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen unless I want to work deli. He told me the department manager blames me and my other co worker for the health department and store manager told me yeah we do some things wrong but it should have stayed within the store not the health department. I told him I can\u2019t confirm the health department showing up and that it wasn\u2019t me.\n\nAfter the meeting in the office another co worker(who was attacked by our department managers sister last summer off the clock In the employee parking lot in which I was the sole witness and we went to the police and got his sister let go and she was taken to court) told me the department manager has been saying a lot of bad things about me and calls me \u201cthe n*gger\u201d and \u201cthe negro\u201d aka the black in Spanish. I\u2019ve faced racial harassment from him before and his brother and went to the previous owner years ago about it and nothing happened.\n\nI explained to the store manager about the pico and shrimp and how it\u2019s wrong etc and that my GF is severely allergic to seafood and she could of been killed since my mom and her both shop here.. also how he bleached the pico and how that\u2019s felony poisoning and he agreed and said he\u2019ll stand up for me if he does it again. My co worker that told me today about the racial stuff said he can\u2019t get rid of me but may throw heavy jobs at me. The store manager told me I need to make amends with my department manager and I said what amends are there to make? He\u2019s in the wrong and both him and his brother should be disciplined not me. Told him I will continue to show up and do my job. I told the store manager that\u2019s wrongful termination but he said in Illinois businesses can terminate you without reason etc\n\nI will be documenting this and anything else that happens.

I know it was over night because we open an hour and 30 minutes before they do and I always come in early. At 8:45 this morning I saw the chicken left out and recorded it out of pure disgust. \n\nOther than the food issue the flies back there drive me nuts. I have to hold my breath because they detect movement and start flying/swarming everywhere, apparently they got in because someone from the pizzeria accidentally left the ally door open overnight\u2026 \n\nI just wanna know, what\u2019s the best way to report this without it tracing back to me?

He is a bit stubborn, saying he hasn't had a problem with it and has been doing it for years. I know that's true because I see the rice cooker with 60+ hours on the display very often. \n\nNow, the rice he ends up eating is often slightly yellow from sitting there for days. I tell him, you know, I think that yellow is a sign of bacteria. Straight up, light yellow color means bacteria and it's risky to consume that rice. He says it's fine. He always feels fine after eating it this way for years. I don't know how to convince him that the food poisoning he just had very likely came from the rice he had with his meal. I checked the rice cooker. It was at 62 hours. \n\nAm I going crazy, or isn't that like very dangerous? Is it possible for someone to go years without a problem doing this, then to get a problem so suddenly? How dangerous is this for his health? I'm concerned for the guy haha\n\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the comments. Now I'm wondering if it could be one of his other unsafe food habits. His soup was leftover, and I often notice he leaves his soup on the stove top for several hours at room temperature before putting it in the fridge. Would boiling this soup remove the risk?

He also doesn't seem that careful with preparing meat alongside veggies.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1i1qfaf/my_roommate_regularly_keeps_his_rice_in_a_rice/", "created_utc": 1736918438.0, "score": 163, "author": "someoctopus", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1i1qfaf/my_roommate_regularly_keeps_his_rice_in_a_rice/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["My rice cooker maintains a food-safe temperature indefinitely on its \"keep warm\" setting.\n\nBUT the only reason I know that is because I actually checked it.\n\nOtherwise, I wouldn't trust that the \"keep warm\" setting was hot enough.", "As long as the rice stays above 135\u00b0F, it is safe indefinitely.

The other thing is, if the timer maxes out and drops to an unsafe temperature and the bacteria have time to colonize, bringing it back up to 140f won't do anything because Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium botulinum all form spores that are heat-resistant and can survive higher temps.

E.g. it was tapioca balls or the starch that she had mixed with some other ingredient and it saw a chemical change under heat. \n\nAnother option is something like a high-tannin apple caused this, ~~though I believe the balls would have to be brown for that to be the case.  Since extracted taninn powder is usually brown... though it's not extracted from apples when sold wholesale, so there's a small chance that brown color we are used to is due to the grape skins itself.~~ Actually I just learned in some research that Tanninn Resin can be white and looks like beads. https://www.lanlangcorp.com/Content/uploads/2020415081/202003251939184646393.jpg\n\nThis one is hard to figure out, but I hope some of my thinking helps.\n\nI'd love to know if she actually stocks tanninn resin, as that would be a bit odd for an ingredient to just have laying around.", "These look like garden snail eggs. \ud83d\ude10\n\nhttps://www.trifectanatural.com/problem-identifier/how-to-get-rid-of-garden-snails/", "Cornstarch or flour that likely wasn\u2019t incorporated all the way is my guess", "def cornstarch.

Cause it's just too sticky. If an insect was going to approach this pie and lay eggs, it would have to do it on the *outside* of the pie.\n\n\nSo that would only leave us with the option that the eggs were in the filling pre-baking.\n\nInsect eggs (even frog and fish eggs,) unlike the chicken/bird eggs were used to seeing, don't have a hard outer shell. Think about what something like caviar might do if mixed into pie filling and cooked at a high temp. I'd bet 99% of them would pop open. You wouldn't have a bunch of little cooked balls of eggs. You'd have a bunch of empty egg sacks, that would probably mostly dissolve within the filling.\n\n\nAs other's have pointed out, tapioca balls seem like the most logical answer. (Google \"small pearl tapioca\" it looks identical to your pics.)\n\n\nThere's some people [Here](https://www.google.com/amp/ask.metafilter.com/363252/Tapioca-to-tapioca-flour-starch/amp) talking about using tapioca pearls in fruit pies. \n\n\nSome things they said that could be relevant:\n\n\n\"Pearls are definitely called for in some berry pie recipes.

With plastic jars you also have to worry about the shelf life of the jar, plastic containers do not last forever, but 2 years is not that bad. \n\nQuality on the other hand is a different story. Mayo is almost entirely fat (oil), this will go rancid fairly quickly, which is why the shelf life on these are so short, they don't want you eating rancid mayo and complaining. The rancid mayo is not dangerous, but it taste gross, I've accidentally cooked with a 5 year old canola oil, it smelled and tasted like a mixture of wet cardboard, playdough and soap. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, if something is shelf stable and only requires refrigeration after opening, it has been designed in a way that ensures no pathogen growth, and could theoretically last forever.

From the looks of the corner piece that is actually cooked, seems like it was frozen and didn\u2019t fully thaw yet so still very cold in the center which is probably why it didn\u2019t cook. You should add a bit of water and cover it and let it steam to cook inside slowly. Also high heat will cook only the outside because it takes a while for the heat to travel through the meat. You\u2019ll burn the outside before the inside cooks so you need to use medium heat or if it is still frozen even cook it on low heat for a longer time.", "[removed]", "Start skin side down then flip it carefully.

Your cooking the fuck out of the surface of it before the heat has a chance to cook the inside.  I made this mistake with steak.", "As others have said, oven is much easier way to cook this, however I quite often do it in a frying pan as follows. \n\nFirstly remove from the fridge half an hour before cooking. This allows the fish to come up to room temperature, and basically gives you a small head start on cooking, as the internal temperature of the fish is now higher before it goes in the pan. Secondly, get your pan on about 50% heat, with plenty of oil. I probably would have at least 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan. My electric hob has a dial from 1 to 9 and I\u2019d select 5 for this job. Any higher and you\u2019re going to burn it before it cools through. \n\nStart cooking the fish skin side UP. As fish cooks it falls apart, but you have a window when you can cook on the fleshy side before the fillet starts to disintegrate. Flip after 3-4 minutes so it\u2019s skin side down. You should have some nice brown colour on the flesh side opposite the skin. You want to cook on the skin side for much longer as the fish skin is much more robust than the flesh. At this point, just leave it skin side down for 8-9 minutes, and you should find it cooks through. If you start to smell burning, you may have the pan slightly too hot. Make sure there\u2019s plenty of oil, oil is basically a cheat code as it allows you to transfer more heat to your food without burning/damaging as were it not there. As you get better and more experienced, you can reduce the amount of oil you have to use. \n\nAnd that should be that, the skin should go brown but still edible if you enjoy eating crispy fish skin.", "Was this frozen?

{"title": "WTF is r/foodsafety and why is it showing up for me?", "selftext": "Maybe it was the spiked gelatin, maybe it was the dented can, or maybe it was one of the super gross posts.\n\nWhatever it was, you found yourself here at r/foodsafety. \n\nI know, I know. Your first impression is off-putting. Who are these people? Why don't they know a steak that is still mooing and walking is bad? \n\nWell, allow me to explain what you've stumbled onto.\n\nThis is a place for people to post any food safety related question and, preferably, receive little to no judgement and an answer. The users who respond come from a variety of backgrounds including: Auditors, Farmers, vet techs, bakers, fishermen, gardeners, chefs, and many many more. Do we have a group that answers every question? Absolutely not. We leave that up to the users. A lot of times we might have somebody hop in who has direct experience with manufacturing of the product somebody is asking about. For most answers we do ask for some external source, or at least a pretty sound explanation. There are enough users here that do know what they're doing that a bad answer will usually get put down pretty quick.\n\n**Some more questions you may have:**\n\n*Ok, but like, don't people know what's good and bad?*\n\nNot really. Sometimes people never have a hand in preparing their own food, and so when they begin to live on their own they just don't know. Sometimes people are low on funds and they have to start making tough decisions about what they could eat. Sometimes someone is just using an ingredient that is entirely new to them or exotic and all the information they can find online is conflicting.\n\n*Is everyone who posts here a troll?*\n\nI'd guess it's about 5 to 15%. We catch it decent amount of them.\n\n*Are the mods power hungry monsters?*\n\nIt's a food safety sub, everyone here is hungry. Us specifically? Don't really need more power. I actually took over the sub several years ago from an account that just created it to try to sell software. It had a few thousand users, then a few months ago we exploded. I give it my time and energy because I think it's interesting. Sometimes we delete comments that are outright rude or mean because we want the conversation to stay focused on food safety, and not the potato version of Pickle Rick. It's not a power trip. \n\n*Do we really need food safety? Weren't my ancestors fine?*\n\nNo, they understood the risks of food. Food safety has been around for thousands of years. Egyptians boiled water to prevent disease, in the middle age there were bread laws and the first documented case of a foodborne illness causing death is from 323 BCE.\n\n*It feels like everyone here always gives the worst case scenario, why?*\n\nBecause we'd rather the person asking the question get the full view of what could happen than be under some delusion it's perfectly safe. The can **could** contain botulism. The chicken **might** be an unholy mutation. Stealing the last cookie at Christmas **may** cause your siblings to murder you. If we tell the worst then they can make a choice.\n\n*Are people with food anxieties welcome here?*\n\nAre you kidding me? We love you all. Bring those worries and share them with us.\n\n*What's with all the misinformation?*\n\nWe are trying to cut down on it, but we are a small mod team. We cannot check every comment as this is not our full-time job. If we notice the top comment or comments are wrong we will lock the post. Please keep in mind we are human. \n\n*Why do you keep locking posts?*\n\nWhen a question has been answered and the conversation starts devolving into vulgarity or insults we shut it down so we don't have to monitor it anymore. \n\n*My comment was deleted, what do I do?*\n\nMessage the mods, sometimes things are taken down by automod for wording, sometimes we do it and didn't see all the details or assume you were a troll.\n\n*Why did I get banned for saying this sub is stupid?*\n\nIf you don't want to be here, we don't want you here. It's that simple. We ban people because this is not a sub designed around talking about how stupid food safety is, or how stupid people are.\n\n*Are we fear mongering?*\n\nSee the above answer about worst case scenarios. Seriously though, we aren't trying to scare people, and we aren't being overly dramatic. We give what the rules say. If they sound restrictive, well, they can be at times. They aren't ours, they are typically best practices.\n\n*The mods are deleting posts, right?*\n\nNo. Typically we do not delete posts even when they go off the rails. We delete some of we are confident it's a troll.

It's fantastic. I've got OCD (clinically diagnosed, not the 'zomgzzz i'M sOooo OcD teHe' kind). Food safety related OCD is one of the things I really struggle with. \n\nOn the plus side, if you eat food I make, you're gonna be a-ok, from safe unexpired, un-botulized food, cooked to the proper temperature for long enough, with every possible safety protocol...  unless idk lettuce is contaminated with something that couldn't be washed off and there was no recall yet. \ud83d\ude2d\n\n On the negative side, it can lead to some gnarly anxiety, restrictive eating, and shamefully, some food waste.

There's a simple reason for this; it's much safer to tell someone their food is unsafe than it is to tell them their food is fine. We can't smell or really see the food, so posts are just guessing with very little information. That means every post is going to come to the conclusion that it's not safe to eat and probably pile on each poster's personal anxieties about food to boot.\n\nYesterday I saw a post with someone asking about some fresh (picked by them) broccoli they had steamed then left out. Almost every post was deleted by mods, and a mod had locked the thread and left a pinned comment stating categorically that this fresh steamed vegetable was \"not safe to eat\".

I understand you're not preaching that someone should play fast and loose with the danger zone recommendations (at least I hope you arent), and that food safety is a tool that people should use to determine what level of risk they find acceptable.

{"title": "Why didn't everybody become ill?", "selftext": "I have been a big follower in the 2 hour rule for left out food for some while now. Most of my adult life. I've thrown away so much food because of it. \n\nI know though that not everybody is so strict. \n\nLast week my company had a friendsgiving feast. People from around the company brought in food and it was a nice time. But when people brought the food in in the morning there were 30-40 foods that sat on the counter from 9-10am to 4pm when the event started getting ready. So that means food like mac and cheese, stuffing, cranberry sauce, fried chicken, spanakopita, yams, cakes, pies, muffins, puddings, etc all were left out for 6-7+ hours and then reheated. We have to then understand that everybody needed to commute (train, bus, cab) with the food so that's an hour plus too. I'm sure some things like pudding and cheese cake were refridgerated though.\n\nBut so many people ate this food. Around 60 people and nobody got sick. \n\nI'm not writing to challenge this sub or the recomemndations. But instead to find balance with my anxiety for the topic.

First there\u2019s the food itself. Was it exposed to potentially harmful pathogens in the first place? Does it have other qualities that make it particularly friendly to their growth, or mildly unfriendly? \n\nThen there is the variation within people. We have so much individual variation that\u2019ll influence how susceptible we are. Our general immune system robustness, the acidity of our stomachs, our particular gut flora etc. \n\nIn sum there is SO much individual variation. \n\nYou\u2019ve been thinking of the two hour rule as \u201cyou will absolutely get sick after this\u201d. It\u2019s actually much more like \u201cvirtually no one with any food will get sick with food left out for under this long\u201d.  It\u2019s the guaranteed safety window. With how much variance there is, many things will/may stay safe after that. But the likelihood that they aren\u2019t goes up exponentially with time. It does mean though that it\u2019s very possible to get lucky. \n\nYour brother is sort of correct. Professional food handlers HAVE to follow the two hour rule because of regulations. Those regulations are designed to protect everyone, including those who are most susceptible to food poisoning - young kids, elderly folks, otherwise immune compromised. Home kitchens are not regulated, so we are not OBLIGATED to follow any specific rules. And many home cooks might be more lax, because they\u2019ve gotten used to what they can generally get away with. \n\nTL;DR - the two hour rule is the guaranteed safe window, not the guaranteed bad after window", "You're not guaranteed to get sick every single time you eat something that's been out for two hours, that's not how it works. It's just that over two hours is where the likelihood of it happening increases.", "A good way to think about this is to remember that food safety isn't binary safe/dangerous options. Rather it is a continuum ranging from less safe to more safe.\n\nThe longer you leave a TCS food outside of temperature control, the less safe it becomes. Eventually, the food reaches a point when it can make you sick. Unfortunately, we can't predict exactly how long is too long, because foods don't give and observable signs (smell or taste) to let us know when illness is imminent. \n\nEating that food wasn't guaranteed to make you sick, but it's a gamble. Maybe you are lucky and are absolutely fine, or maybe you wind up heaving your guts out. Nothing is ever 100% safe,  but we can do our best to stay at the safer end of the spectrum by not taking needless risks like leaving those foods out all day.", "Not all foods present the same amount of risk, but if you start trying to do the math on what ingredients go bad after how much time and trying to figure out how that works with foods wtfh different recipes and combinations of ingredients, that's impossible to adhere to responsibly.

Your tomatoes, and your balsamic vin; lots of liquid on the outside.

Better quality ham sticks with the most appropriate meat (which is unsurprisingly enough actual fresh ham meat) but lower end stuff incorporates other less desirable cuts like shank and sirloin, both of which are substantially darker than the relatively light ham meat.

If you do a little googling, you'll find a video of some people microwaving a chocolate bar where the melted/solid chocolate actually show these areas.

{"title": "Botulism FAQ", "selftext": "Any given day on any given food sub, at least one person will inevitably post the frantic question:\u00a0\n\n\u201cI ate some freaky food. Do I have BOTULISM?\u201d\n\nAnd, inevitably, the answer is \u201cno, you don\u2019t.\u201d Frequently, the answer is \u201cthat\u2019s not even remotely how botulism works.\u201d\n\nI get it. I really do. **Botulism is legitimately scary.** It can fuck you up in horrifying ways for life, or kill you in a particularly slow and gruesome manner. But here\u2019s the thing: foodborne botulism is [*exceedingly rare*](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/php/national-botulism-surveillance/2019.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20health%20departments%20reported,as%20probably%20adult%20intestinal%20colonization) in the developed world.\u00a0\n\n>In 2019, health departments reported 215 cases of botulism to CDC \u2026 The cases were of the following types: 152 (71%) infant, 41 (19%) wound, **21 (10%) foodborne,** and 1 (<1%) other, diagnosed as probably adult intestinal colonization.\n\nSo to reiterate: in the **entire year** of 2019, in the **entire country** of the United Sates of America (pop. 345 million), there were a whopping **twenty one** cases of botulism that people got from eating food.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established how rare it is, let\u2019s answer some frequently asked questions to further establish why you probably don't have botulism.\n\n**What the heck is botulism, anyway?**\n\nBotulism is a disease caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by the bacterium *Clostridium botulinum. C. botulinum* is a spore-former, meaning it creates protective spores to in order to survive in unfavorable environments. The spores themselves are largely harmless, and are found everywhere in the environment. Ingesting *C. bot* spores won't hurt you (unless you're an infant, possibly) \u2014 in order to develop the toxin, you need live (\u201cvegetative\u201d) bacteria and the right conditions.\n\n**So** ***C. bot*** **can grow basically anywhere, right?**\n\nOh, hell no. While the *spores* are found commonly in many environments, it takes **very specific conditions** in order for the vegetative cells to emerge from the spores, multiply, and produce the toxin:\n\n* NO OXYGEN: *C. bot* is anaerobic, meaning it can\u2019t grow in the presence of oxygen.\u00a0\n* LOTS OF MOISTURE: *C. bot* requires high water activity (aw > 0.92) to grow. It can't grow in dry foods, or foods that don't have enough available water.\n* LOW ACIDITY: acid inhibits *C. bot* growth. A pH below 4.6 will prevent it from growing\n* WARMTH: *C. bot* thrives in warm conditions. Below 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) it would take the most cold-tolerant types of C bot a week or more to grow and produce toxin. Below 37.9\u00b0F (3.3\u00b0C), it will not grow at all. Other types of C. bot can\u2019t grow below 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C).\u00a0\n\n**Is it true that eating food from dented cans can give you botulism?**\n\nPossible? Yes. Likely? No.\n\nIt's my personal and professional opinion that the risk of botulism from dented cans is VASTLY overstated in consumer food safety discourse.\u00a0\n\n**By all means**, you should **always** throw away cans with deep, sharp dents, major damage to a seam, heavy rust, or cans that are bulging or bloated or that spurt when you open them. **If** ***C. bot*** **were going to be present in any canned food situation, these are it.**\n\nCommercially canned food is thermally processed to extremely high temperatures in order to destroy *Clostridium botulinum* spores. **There are** **no** **viable spores inside any undamaged can of commercial food produced in the developed world.** However, the concern with dented cans is that a severe dent could compromise the hermetic seal, which could allow microorganisms from the environment to enter the can. Most of the time these would be organisms that cause spoilage that you can see or smell. But there is a *remote* chance that *C. bot* spores could get inside and work their way into a part of the can that is still anaerobic enough (despite the hole) for them to grow and produce toxin.\n\nAgain, this is pretty unlikely. The idea that \u201cdented cans = botulism\u201d is extremely pervasive, but it is **nowhere close** to the most common causes of botulism. Possible? Yes. Likely? No.\n\n**What's the deal with garlic in oil?**\n\nOil creates an anaerobic environment. Oil by itself doesn\u2019t have high enough water activity to support pathogen growth, but if you introduce something wet, it can create a pocket of higher water activity inside the oil. Garlic and fresh herbs are especially good at this because they also tend to carry botulinum spores. As a result, unrefrigerated garlic-in-oil infusions are a common source of botulism. Fortunately, you can solve this problem by storing it in the fridge. And store-bought garlic in oil products are generally acidified to make them shelf stable and inhibit botulinum growth, so it's typically only the homemade stuff you need to worry about.\n\n**I stored my leftovers in a sealed Tupperware or ziplock bag. That\u2019s anaerobic, right?**\n\nNope. When you put on the lid or zipped the seal, you closed air inside with the food. Unless you used a vacuum sealer, that air is still in there. Not anaerobic.\u00a0\n\n**Okay, I get it, it\u2019s rare. But where did those 21 people get botulism then?**\n\nThere are a few very reliable ways to give yourself botulism, and none of them have to do with commercially manufactured food. The majority of cases are due to **improper home canning and preservation techniques**. Things like people hot filling their cans with low-acid food and skipping the processing step. Or sketchy, unrefrigerated homemade garlic infusions. Or inadequately preserved fish or marine mammal meat (this is a big one - a huge % of US botulism cases happen in Alaska Native communities).\n\n**In summary, it's pretty easy not to get botulism. Conversely, it is pretty damn hard to get botulism. I hope folks find this informative!**\n\nEdit: as u/Ippus_21 pointed out, botulism is only one specific kind of foodborne illness.

So even if your turkey remains frozen, if you\u2019re thawing in a 70F room, for over a day your turkey is at 70F on the surface. \n\nDon\u2019t trust the old people\u2019s ways, just because something was done that way doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the right way.", "Brining at room temperature doesn't guarantee that you'll get sick, but it's definitely not advised and here's why.\n\nSalmonella can be found deeper in the muscle tissue, but the brine will typically only penetrate a few millimeters. So even if the brine had a salinity sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth (which has **not** been established here), it's likely the it wouldn't be able to reach as deep as it would need to.\n\nA common counter argument is that the turkey is going to be baked and that would kill any bacteria present. \n\nIn theory, yes. But there are some factors that could work against this idea. Was the turkey cooked to an internal temperature that was hot enough? Do they own a food thermometer? Has it ever been calibrated to verify its accuracy? Was the temperature checked in multiple locations? Was the cavity filled with stuffing that can soak up that bacterial goodness? \n\nBrining the bird outside of the fridge will result in greater numbers of bacteria present, which makes the answers to those questions much more important. One tenet we like to share during inspections is that it's not a good idea to do something that increases how much bacteria you need to worry about.\n\nAnd finally for everyone who has a relative who fiercely clings to the idea that they have always done this an no one has ever gotten sick.

{"title": "Just had my power restored after a 3 day outage. Here's how I handled the food safety aspect.", "selftext": "It's not uncommon to see questions in this sub regarding the safety of food during power failures.  I just got my power back after an ice stormed knocked out power for 3 days, so I wanted to share how I navigated those waters.  \n\nThe first thing I can say, as I have many times in many threads, is if you don't already have a food thermometer, **get one**.  Get one probe style thermometer that is capable of reading both cold and hot temps (in other words, don't get a \"meat\" thermometer), and then get a hanging one to put in your fridge.  None of what I'm about to advise is going to be feasible unless you can take accurate temps.  You don't need fancy digital ones (although those are fun), and you can get dial-type ones for under $10.\n\nI have 2 fridges with small freezer compartments, and 1 freezer chest.  Once it became obvious that this wasn't going to be a short outage, I grabbed everything from the freezer compartments and (working quickly to minimize the time the door was open) threw everything into the chest.  \n\nThe basic premise here is that a tightly packed freezer (regardless of whether its a chest or compartment) will stay frozen longer than one that is half full.  Just for grins, I threw the thermometer I use to monitor how hot my smoker is on top of the food in the chest.  It has a wire that leads to a panel so I could monitor the temps without opening the chest.  When the power came back on, the warmest it got in there was 26F.\n\nIf you encounter this situation, when the power comes back on, check your freezer.  If it still feels hard, then you know you're fine.  Ice crystals are also a good sign.  If it thaws, then this is the point you will need your thermometer.  Start taking temps of the food near the surface where it will be the warmest (the center may still be frozen).  If the temp is 41F or below, then you can keep the food.  At this point it's just like being refrigerated instead of frozen.  You *can* refreeze at this point, just understand that there may be a loss of quality.  But the main point is the food is still safe.\n\nIf it's over 41F, then the question is how long was it over that threshold.  Be aware that even when the power comes back on, it will still take a few hours for your appliances to cool back down.  Anyone who frequents this sub knows this song:  under 2 hours and you can cool it back down again and under 4 hours you can cook and eat it right away.  \n\nThe refrigerator compartments are a bit trickier, since they are starting from a warmer temperature.  In my case, I know that my fridges both run about 37F \u2013 38F, so I have at least a few hours to work with before things go south.  That first day of the outage, the temp outside was in the mid to high 40\u2019s.  But once the sun went down, so did the temp and it wasn\u2019t going to be above the 30\u2019s for the next few days.  So I loaded everything I wanted to keep and wasn\u2019t just refrigerated for quality and moved it to the detached garage.  I threw another thermometer in the box and it never got into the danger zone.\n\nHere's a final point.  Being over 41F for over 4 hours does **not** guarantee that you will get sick.  But for every hour and every degree over those levels increases the **risk** of illness.  At this point you need to ask yourself if the potential risk of serious illness is worth the cost of the food you are discarding.  That is a decision that you need to make for yourself, but if you ask anyone who has been hit with any of the major bugs\u2026 well, you know.  If you made it through this entire wall of text, go get yourself a nice bowl of ice cream or some other treat.

The front of it was just above the safe 40ish range and a package of ground beef near the front was definitely defrosted (and making quite a smell).

Please be careful, as it may not affect you as severely as it will for vulnerable demographics (namely pregnant, children, immunocompromised individuals).", "Dumb luck, but also it depends on what type of food you\u2019re leaving out overnight. Pizza? You\u2019ll probably be fine though I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Pasta or rice? You\u2019re taking a huge risk. People have died from bacillus cereus poisoning because they left rice or pasta out too long. And there are plenty of other foods that are super risky to consume if left out", "The way I\u2019ve been taught to think about it is there are two components of getting sick or not getting sick: the hazard and the risk. The hazard is the thing that could happen; in this case, food poisoning. The risk is the likelihood the food poisoning will happen. I don\u2019t know how the risk is measured by the scientists, but consider this (made up) example: although a 10% risk of food poisoning sounds low, that\u2019s 1 out of every 10 people who eat something left out for 4+ hours getting sick. Multiplied over a city\u2019s population the number of people getting sick (and in some smaller number of cases needing hospitalization or actually dying) really starts be noticeable. You have been on the winning end of these probabilities. Every time you eat something against food safety advice you are gambling. No one can say if or when your luck will run out, but you should weigh that unknown\u2014and the possibility of sickness and death\u2014against throwing the food out and eating something else.", "Sometimes there is confusion as to what getting sick from a foodborne illness looks like. Have you *ever* thrown up (aside from something like drinking too much)? Or have you ever had a day where you had a raging case of the lava shits? \n\nIf the answer is no, then you my friend ought to get to a casino because you are one lucky person. If the answer is yes, then you have to ask what caused it. Your body doesn't reject food for no good reason. The answer might have been you caught yourself a mild case of food poisoning. I've heard some people who believe that it isn't \"real\" food poisoning unless you get hospitalized. But mild symptoms are possible. \n\nAnd if you truly never have spent a minute being sick from something you ate, you also need to remember that luck doesn't last forever. The point I keep coming back to is that if you know something is risky and there is no upside, even if you haven't had something bad happen (yet), why would you keep doing it?", "Luck.", "You're young and pure luck. It'll catch up with you eventually.", "I am actually like this too, I rarely gets sick from leftover food. I\u2019m asian and I\u2019ve been doing this for a while and it\u2019s like a norm. We just sometimes leave the food overnight and just heat it up in the morning.\n\nI just joined this sub a few weeks ago and while checking this sub I\u2019m now I\u2019m re-thinking if I\u2019m doing it right.", "It's all about reducing risk.\n\nAfter 4 hours in the danger zone, the risk often gets significantly higher.\n\nNow, I sometimes eat food that I should have thrown out and I haven't suffered any terrible fate yet.\n\nCertain foods like rice, chicken or fish also get riskier quicker than say, bread or cake. (or the yummy yummy overnight pizza)", "A friend of mine leaves food out constantly. It\u2019s a long term habit. She and her family never admit to food poisoning but have episodes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea off and on to the point they keep medication for all of the above amply stocked. No one has ever connected leaving food out to their GI symptoms.\n\nPoint is, food poisoning isn\u2019t always severe vomiting and diarrhea. It can be more subtle.\n\nAlso, I never had severe food poisoning myself until I was in my mid 30s or so, mostly due to dumb luck. It\u2019s a crapshoot, but regardless it can make you very sick. Just depends on what you\u2019re willing to risk. To me, it\u2019s so easy to refrigerate food properly, why wouldn\u2019t you?", "I always remind people that food safety is to mitigate risk, like some other are saying. Also, folks that are immune compromised, elderly or young children have the real possibility of being hospitalized and dying from a food borne illness. \n\nYou\u2019ve also might have had minor symptoms and just associated them with regular life symptom( GI stuff) and not abused food. \n\nSo while abusing time and temperature may not make some generally healthy people significantly sick, it still has the risk of causing serious illness or death and is not something to take lightly.", "Imagine you left an open glass of water on your nightstand every night, and people told you it wasn't safe, but you'd been doing it for years. One night, a bug falls in your water and you end up drinking it. Gross.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFood poisoning is kind of like that. You can be resistant to the toxins/bacteria so you may personally not be as prone to getting sick, and/or the proverbial bug may not have fallen into your water. The issue with bacteria is, you can't see them. One day they'll be there and you won't know it. Also food poisoning can be deadly, especially for people who are at risk.", "Have you ever had the stomach flu? Or a mild case of diarrhea? Or just felt queasy one day?\n\nThese are all almost always caused by eating food with an overgrowth of bad bacteria.\n\nFood poisoning can be deeply unpleasant, dangerous, and even deadly. It's not something people should take lightly. But most of the time, it's so mild people don't even know they have it. We have lots of built-in defences against food-borne illnesses. If we didn't, we'd have died out as a species long ago.", "How come no one is asking what food he had?", "Complete luck and honestly it's not worth pushing it.", "Temperature controlled food should not be in the danger zone (40f to 140f) for more than two hours if storing or 4 hours if consuming and tossing.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/foodsafety) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Because the rules presented here are very generalized and they are there to mitigate even the slightest risk on a personal level. Let's say you're consuming a food after 4 hours for which the chances of getting ill are one in a million - it may never affect you but for a generalized population it's enough for institutions to care. And remember that basically everyone eats several times a day, it's stacking up.", "Is it possible that some people have a stronger gut than others? My husband has never had food poisoning, but in the 12 years we've been together, I've had it probably 6 times to varying degrees.", "I used to be really strict with food handling but living with others who aren't I've gotten a bit more relaxed about it. I've eaten stuff that's been out all night and been fine. Only time I've had food poisoning was from a service station burger king and that was the worst few days of my life", "I've been doing the same for 20 years and never had an issue. Alot of people on this sub seem to be actually genuinely afraid of food", "My whole life my mom used to leave left overs out and we\u2019d just eat it the next day. Now that I know about food safety I can\u2019t do it.\n\nIt\u2019s most likely to do with your immune system. You got used to it. I never got sick from it\nEither \n\nSometimes people just get lucky with food safety. And our immune systems get used to a lot of stuff. \n\nGoing forward all that\u2019s really best to do is follow food safety rules to prevent anything happening in the future, and  consider yourself lucky nothing has happened yet.", "So you\u2019ve NEVER had diarrhea? Like at all? Food poisoning isn\u2019t always \u2018violently ill\u2019, sometimes it\u2019s just a tummy rumble or the squirts.", "It depends on the food. High salt content food or high acid food you might not have a problem. But raw food or partially cooked food might be more problematic.  4 hr is probably a rule of thumb because you probably don't want to be doing a forensic analysis in your head to decide if that piece of food has been sitting out too long.  As for cooking, if you incinerate the food for 4 min in the microwave will everything be dead, Yes.   A few pathogens that are alive live in food, it is not their aliveness that is dangerous but their byproducts are. (i.e. Botulinum toxin) that are resistant.  So you are just rolling the dice."]}

I assumed she would let it cool & then put it in the fridge, but as the title suggests the unplugged crockpot has been sitting on the counter lid clamped since around noon yesterday. \n\nShe can be sort of temperamental about these types of things, so no one has asked about it yet, but we\u2019re all looking at each other and the chili wondering what\u2019s going on\u2026 it\u2019s definitely not safe to eat right?!?!\n\nUpdate: Finally it got to the point where one of us had to say something. When asked if the covered, unplugged crockpot had been out since midday yesterday, she said \u2018yes because the crockpot is too big to fit into the fridge\u2026..\u2019 We brought up that it\u2019s not safe to leave meat at room temperature for more than a few hours, to which then my FIL piped up and said that its fine & this is how they always make it. \n\nWife & I pretended to be too tired from the day and went to bed at 6pm before dinner. We\u2019ll see how FIL & MIL feel in the AM! \n\nUpdate 2: Wife & I got up before everyone to get breakfast (because we went to bed dinnerless at 6pm), crockpot is on the counter, still full of chili, unplugged\u2026 will report back once everyone is awake\n\nUpdate 3 (probably final one): MIL, FIL, & BIL all ate the chili last night (BIL in law said he put so much cheese & crackers in the bowl that it was more of a cereal than chili \ud83d\ude02). Everyone feels fine this morning, so i guess toss this one up as a lucky chance that nothing happened. We all survived & no one is vomiting this morning. \n\nMy MIL left the chili in the crockpot again last night after reheating it for dinner. It\u2019s been unplugged since 9pm last night.

I want to respect her past and culture differences from me, US born and raised, but me and my boyfriend are living with her again. And he worries because he grew up with food safety, his mom taught him everything from freezing to reheating leftovers.\n\nMy Mexican mom has always left out food overnight. She cooks it in the big pots and pans and then will cover it with a lid, aluminum foil, or sometimes nothing and leave it overnight on the counter. Sometimes she does try to plastic-bag things more when I ask, and she does refrigerate some things.

Maybe the tomatoes for the tacos, cilantro and onion. Maybe fried zucchini. stir fry so any extra veggies mixed with rice, left in a big pan. \n\nThis is a majority of things she often leaves overnight out.

I\u2019m a young adult so forgive my ignorance. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are any of these foods allowed to be left out? I am familiar now that she shouldn\u2019t leave meat out but.. she always leaves it out lol. \n\n2. Crema / sour cream: she will use it way past the expiration date for enchiladas. I try to understand sometimes her English is poor so I figured I should know the max days the sour cream can stay in fridge before I toss it for her? \n\n3. Ketchup: she keeps leaving it outside. I put it in the fridge and then it happens again. Is ketchup outside or inside the fridge? How many times can she keep leaving it out before I have to toss it. \n\n4. Is there any \u201cOK\u201d or green light where she can justify why we won\u2019t get sick or why she\u2019ll keep putting the food in the counter. Maybe because of the cultural differences? \n\n5.

It can look like that from the outside, but let me give you some examples of what people are dealing with when they come here. These are taken from real posts:\n\n-A person recently had food poisoning and now has crippling anxiety whenever they get a stomach ache. They came here asking for tips to keep their kitchen clean and what resources they could read. \n\n-A parent was concerned about their child after they ate some expired candy. We were able to explain the difference between shelf stable foods, best by, consume by, etc. We saved them a multi hour drive to a hospital and a world of worry.\n\n-Someones elderly father insisted on doing the cooking when everyone visited, but had some very unsafe behavior that had made the family sick before. We gave them suggestions on how to talk to their father and help them adjust the unsafe behavior. \n\n**Consider this a warning:**\n\nWe will be aggressively monitoring posts and comments.

If it is a small piece of chicken you can safely thaw it at room temperature as long as you are controlling the time (making sure it gets back in the fridge or cooked within 2 hours). \n\nBut it is actually more complicated than that, as the meat itself stays cold for quite a while while it is thawing. The risk is the surface of the meat reaching unsafe temperatures before the interior of the meat thaws. Theoretically you could safely thaw a whole turkey on the counter if it is wrapped in something insulating and the surface is not allowed to get to unsafe temperatures while it defrosts (you would also need to put a thermometer on the surface reading constantly to ensure safety). \n\nThe main risk with ambient thawing is when the food is close to thawing, then the surface will warm up much quicker. So, it is very possible that thawing a whole chicken on the counter could be safe, it's possible that the surface of the chicken stays cool enough, but again the only way to ensure that is to have a thermometer on it and placing it back in the fridge the moment that meat gets close to 41F. But, it is clear that this care is not being taken, so this is not safe, but not nearly as risky as people make it seem like. \n\nIt is absolutely risky, but the reason why the USDA and other government agencies have such strict guidelines (2 and 4 hour rule in the US), is to make these rules simple and easy to understand for people that don't understand food safety. This simplification is important, but does not mean that thawing at room temperature is unsafe. \n\nPersonally, I thaw my turkey at room temperature every year, and I do not believe it is risky. I tape a temperature probe to the outside of the turkey package, then wrap the whole thing in a few layers of newspaper, this keeps it insulated so the surface does not get warm. I keep track of the temperature and put it in the fridge well before it gets warm (although it never has). It thaws much faster than in the fridge, but requires some work to ensure it is done safely. I do not recommend this, unless you know what you are doing, but my point is that you can safely thaw meat at room temperature. \n\n\n\nThis is a little different, but here is a great short (26 min) podcast with 2 well known food safety professors talking about cold water thawing turkey.

I got 20 bucks that says the answer is no. \n\nIf it's below 135F, would the food be discarded after 4 hours? I think we know the answer there.\n\nHow is the food cooled?

That would be another point where temps should be checked, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for that to happen.\n\nHow is the food being reheated? Is it quickly being brought back to at least 165F before hot holding or are they just putting the food back on the steam table?

You can take them on your hike as long as you want to, but once you open them, the safe option is to consume within 2 hours.", "In general there is a couple different reasons things are \"refrigerated after opening\".\n\nThe most important for food safety are items that are aseptically produced and packaged. Think canned foods, or hot packed processed cheese products, anything that is free of bacteria, but does not necessarily have 'hurdles' to prevent spoilage or pathogen growth. These have to refrigerated for safety after you break the seal, and introduce bacteria into it. These items absolutely need to be refrigerated within 2 hours of opening. The snack sticks do not fall under this category.\n\nSome items are not produced aseptically, but have hurdles to prevent pathogen growth, such as low pH (Acidic), preservatives, curing, low moisture content, and various others, usually a mix of quite a few of these. They might require refrigeration after opening because the oxygen presence will allow mold growth, or other quality issues (like fat going rancid, or drying out), some will require it for food safety reasons although this is rarer. These meat sticks almost certainly fall under this category, although I don't know if they need to be refrigerated for food safety or food quality reasons. \n\nThese meat sticks are cured (contain nitrates), are fermented (contain starter culture), and are smoked (based on the color of the sticks). They are shelf stable before opening which means that they likely also have a lower moisture content. Based on the information provided, it is likely that these would be safe to store at room temperature, but would go moldy much quicker, and potentially dry out. Again, without more information we cannot know for sure if they need to be refrigerated for food safety or quality reasons, but most likely allowing these to sit in the danger zone (41-141\u00b0F) for longer than 4 hours is not likely to be dangerous.", "these are literally my favorite snack. i down these all the time. have never refrigerated them. i think you will probably be okay but i am just a stranger on the internet", "You can try placing them in a bag with a couple of ice packs.

These rules are meant to be applicable to restaurants, caterers, hospital cafeterias, and other areas where a lot of food is being prepared, handled, and served. These rules, if followed correctly, ensure that the food is safe to eat for anyone who's not allergic to it basically.\n\nThe reasoning behind these rules is why families at home can get away with lax versions, like the 24 hour rice rule. Once the rice is cooked, and hot, it's safe to eat. Presumably you use a clean utensil to portion the rice and then replace the lid. The rice cooker is turned off and the rice cools; since the lid is on, the amount of mold/bacteria that can land on the food is drastically reduced as opposed to no lid. However, the yuck that's in there does eventually start to multiply at an exponential rate.  An otherwise healthy individual eating the rice 12 hours later is unlikely to notice any stomach discomfort, especially if they have been following this routine for many years (not that they have immunity to the germs, but they are used to the discomfort such that it feels normal). It's likely still unhealthy but it's better than starving.\n\nthe 2 or 4 hour rule i think varies by region. or if you're going to store it for later. i was always taught 4 hours in the danger zone (40-140F) means it must be tossed. At this point, bacteria have multiplied extensively and people are more likely to become seriously ill from eating it. I've been reading that 2 hours in the danger zone is maximum allowed for something that will be refrigerated and served at a later date/time. This gives the food time to cool in the fridge without staying in the danger zone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhen i make rice in the cooker at home, i leave the warm setting on long enough to get seconds, then turn it off so it can start cooling. then in 60-90 minutes ideally, i'll move it to a tupperware or whatever, lid, put it in the fridge. The general rule I use at home is wait a bit for the food to cool, give it a stir - if no steam comes up, put it in a container, lid, fridge. This is basically the same as cooling food from hot and then refrigerating within 2 hours, except i don't watch the clock so precisely and i don't use a thermometer. i have a lot of experience working with food so i can rely on that to make judgment calls for myself at home. Meats and dairy products definitely get put away promptly - plant based foods im more likely to be lax about.\n\nIf you're a generally healthy and hygienic person, I imagine taking the cold container out of the fridge and putting it in your insulated lunch box will keep rice safe until it's time to eat/reheat. If you're taking meats or dairy along with it, an ice pack is likely essential - those tend to spoil faster. An ice pack and insulated storage is a good idea for transporting refrigerated food, so might as well do that every time.\n\nbasically, keep a clean kitchen and dont let non-pantry foods sit at room temperature, and you'll be okay. whoever told you it's unsafe to eat reheated rice is wrong.", "Just popping in to say that the whole \"don't put hot foods in the refrigerator, b/c it raises the temperature of all the other food\" is not true.

Unfortunately a lot of subs are echo chambers for misinformation. \n\nThankfully the mods do a great job here", "You would like the canning subreddit. They do not mess around.", "The comment I was trying to respond to was deleted, but you can get the gist of it from what I wrote here:\n\nAdmittedly, the accepted recommendations are conservative, and that is by design to account for those who are more susceptible to illness. \n\nIt probably also has something to do with the notion that whatever limits are recommended, people are likely to push it a little farther (like the way people react to whatever the speed limit is). So yes, the world is full of examples of people who went beyond what is considered to be \"safe\" and lived to tell the tale.\n\nBut there are 2 points to consider. First, remember that it's all about risk. The more risks you take (even if they're small), the greater the chances that eventually you'll have a bad outcome. And many of the risks that are described here are completely unnecessary. You know... like putting your leftovers in the fridge *before* you fall asleep.  If these rules didn't matter, we wouldn't see as many people spending the entire day in the bathroom. \n\nSecond, let's refer to this statement:\n\n>I\u2019ve eaten my fair share of foods that this sub would tell me to throw away and I\u2019ve only ever had food poisoning twice in my life, both from professional restaurants, never from myself. \n\nAsk yourself, how do you **know** that. Many of the more commonly seen foodborne illnesses can take days to show symptoms. But our instinct is to blame the last thing we ate. So if we eat lunch at a restaurant and are throwing up by 1:00, we assume it was something we ate there when it's just as (if not more) likely that it was something we ate days earlier. \n\nIn other words, unless we have a group of people who ate the same meal and all get sick, it's hard to identify the cause with any degree of confidence. \n\nI'm not saying we should use the Food Code as gospel. There certainly is some wiggle room in those numbers. But I would suggest that both the people who automatically say, \"It's been 2 hours, throw it out,\" and those who say, \"I've eat things left out all the time and never get sick\" need to understand that food safety is not a binary safe/dangerous scenario. Risk exists on a less risky/more risky continuum, and the purpose of the rules (and this sub) are to try and push the needle towards the less risky end.", "I was just thinking this the other day. Someone in another sub asked if something was safe to eat after sitting out 12 hours. And the comments all said, \"You'll be fine. I do this all the time and  never get sick.\" I mean, how daft can they be? They're still putting themselves at considerable risk. Just because they haven't gotten sick before, doesn't mean that it will never happen.", "I can't remember what sub it was, but I remember reading a post once where someone asked if they could eat a pizza that had been left out in the box all night and the comments were full of people saying \"I do it all the time and never get sick.

No. But it does *not* mean milk is no longer being tested or regulated.\n\nAlso, worth noting: **the FDA isn\u2019t the primary authority on milk safety.** That responsibility mainly falls to the **USDA and state-level agencies**, and those programs are still active.\n\nYes, losing the oversight lab and proficiency program is a step back, and it\u2019s fair to be concerned about that. But this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re suddenly flooding the market with unsafe milk. Food manufacturers aren\u2019t going to throw out core safety practices like pasteurization just because of a regulatory change\u2014these are foundational to their operations, and consumer trust matters a lot.\n\nSo yes, this is worth watching, but it\u2019s not the milk apocalypse.", "Companies in general don't want the social consequences of poisoning people so they still aim for a safe product.\n\nLocal brands or small farmers in rural areas who become lazy with their testing and processes are the most likely ones to cause issues (reference: many Mennonite ice cream companies in my area have had listeries and salmonella in their milk products).\n\nAs for non-food-safety advice, I don't think there's a reliable way to avoid this issue completely but it's very unlikely to happen to any single person.", "You seem to be asking if something is safe to consume.

The food in question was diced tomatoes with tofu and ground turkey. Of course it\u2019s like a stew type of dish most commonly known in Vietnam. Anyways, so we cooked a lot of it so that it could be eaten over the next couple days (for lunch and dinner etc). So we let it cool down for an hour after cooking and then we put it in the fridge overnight.\n\nFast forward to today during lunch\u2026\n\nI had my Mother on FaceTime for our daily chats and she saw me take out the large pot out of the fridge and put it on the stove to heat up. She freaks out at me and tells me that I should not do this and that I should put leftover food in a ceramic container instead. She also stated that if I do what I\u2019m doing right now that it\u2019s not safe because of the metal and the food and whatever (I also had no idea what the she was talking about) would make me have food poisoning. She then told me about relatives that did something similar like this, and that put them in the hospital and made them really sick. (Mind you these relatives don\u2019t eat the best and healthy foods and are t super hygienic). And then just kind of just shook my head and while trying to discuss this with my mother I ended up burning the food so I had to dump it all out\u2026what a waste. \n\nANYWAYS:\nIs this anywhere near true what she claims??

You can arguably do whatever you want if you are making something just for yourself, because, well the risk is only to you - but I digress. \n\n  \nI'd be hesitant to use the more industrial looking bike pumps. Like, the stand-up ones that you pump like a TnT blaster. Those I'd imagine would have quite a bit of lube or non-food safe *things.* I found one website that showed using one of those yoga ball air pumps, that are pretty cheapy-plasticy things but are simplistic enough to be cleanable (like, run dish soap through it). I'd also imagine one of those cheaper hand-held plastic-y ball pumps to be *relatively* safe because they are so simplistic. \n\nI don't know how comfortable I feel using any of those things, but if you can clean it then I'd imagine the risk is relatively low. This is NOT any kind of official health or food safety advice - just my personal thoughts. And no, a lot of people don't even think once about food safety, so I'm not all that surprised that there's not many articles discussing it."]}

If I make it to the other side, have I proved that running blindly across roads is a sensible strategy, or have I been lucky?\n\nAs for learning what to look for, IMO a very key aspect of this is learning that you can't see/smell/taste everything that causes problems. Leaving rice out all night might be ok some of the time, but it is very obviously massively increasing the risk of food poisoning from *B. cereus* (aka Fried Rice Syndrome) compared to cooling and storing it properly.

Properly cooled and stored food will last a lot longer than something that was left out for hours after a party, or put away hot and covered. Time in the danger zone is cumulative as well. If you reheat something multiple times or leave it out for a few hours over the course of several days, bacteria is going to grow faster than something kept consistently refrigerated. \n\nFood safety rules also tend to err on the side of extreme caution. Can you eat 10 day old meat loaf? Probably, but why risk it over $3 of ground beef?", "Food safety is microbiology, essentially. Your food provides a certain environment, and bacteria and fungi that like that environment, if present, will grow in it.\n\nIf bacteria and fungi are to grow, you need:\n\n1. An appropriate environment, in terms of temperature and the chemicals present.\n\n2. An appropriate food source that can be accessed by the organisms.\n\n3. The organisms themselves.\n\nYou can preserve food by making the temperature inhospitable (heating and refrigeration), sterilizing and sealing it up so nothing can get in (canning), by changing the chemistry to make it hostile to life (pickling, salting), or even by fermenting--that is, deliberately introducing organisms that will grow in the food and create a hostile environment for any other species (yogurt, beer, kimchi). Salt will preserve food because bacteria can't live if there's too much of it; drying preserves food because bacteria need water.\n\nFungi have their own preferences, which like with bacteria, differ by species. Mold likes moisture--that's why using a dehumidifier helps keep mold from growing in your basement. But it doesn't take that much moisture; bread mold will grow happily in pretty low humidity.\n\nSo... bottom line? Every type of food presents a different environment to the little critters that could grow in it. And that means that each type of food spoils differently, at different speeds, and this varies by environment and by sheer luck--that dust mote carrying mold spores may or may not land on your food, and if it doesn't, the mold can't magically appear there.\n\nThree to five days is all right as a safety rule of thumb, and will work for anything beyond the absolutely most dangerous foods possible (raw fish? Three days, max). But some foods, in some circumstances, last for weeks or even months without risk of growing anything that could harm someone eating them.

I had to reach out to Wulf's directly to get the correct answer. To clarify, the term \"sushi grade\" is primarily used by restaurants to indicate that the fish has been frozen and thawed to eliminate the risk of parasites. For snapper, there is no legal requirement for freezing before service, and many of our partner restaurants confidently use our snapper for sushi.What we can assure you of is that both Wulfs and Savenor's take great care in handling our snapper to ensure it meets high standards for quality consumption. However, once it leaves our store, it\u2019s up to you, the consumer, to ensure it\u2019s properly maintained if you intend to consume it [raw.In](http://raw.In) short, our snapper is not frozen before we receive it, but we take the proper steps in handling it for safe consumption. We trust this helps clarify, and we're always happy to answer any further questions!\n\nSo she totally misunderstood my question, but now I'm wondering if I should just get something else that has been super frozen?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1jux3h2/how_risky_is_eating_good_quality_red_snapper_that/", "created_utc": 1744171692.0, "score": 0, "author": "Not_instant_ramen17", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1jux3h2/how_risky_is_eating_good_quality_red_snapper_that/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I\u2019m concerned about that response. \n\nThe FDA food code requires sushi grade fish to be frozen to kill the parasites.

But there are two reasons I can think of that they'd be selling them at room temperature, and one would mean you could store them that way too, while the other would mean you'd still need to refrigerate them.\n\n**Reason 1: they're not actually TCS foods.** Factors including pH, water activity, and preservatives can be controlled to make a food inhospitable enough to pathogens that it would be considered non-TCS. A bakery or restaurant could sell cream-filled pastries unrefrigerated IF they could demonstrate to the regulatory authority that they are non-TCS due to the formulation.\n\n**Reason 2: time as a public health control.**  TCS foods can generally be put out for sale unrefrigerated as long as the establishment throws away anything left over after four hours. In this case, they'd technically be safe to eat immediately but not to take home and refrigerate for later (if they'd been out for less than two hours, you *could* take them home and refrigerate for later).\n\n(I can actually think of a third reason, which is that the bakery is selling them unrefrigerated in violation of the regulations. This is less likely, but not unheard of.)\n\nAnyway, you might start by asking the bakery if it's something that needs to be refrigerated or not."]}

It has to have an anaerobic environment, be at a specific temperature range, and within a certain acidity level for example.\n\n\nThe FDA knows the 'rules' of how botulism can be formed, as well as ecoli and listeria and salmonella and etc.etc. and they ensure that whatever you can buy, cannot support any of these growths within the entire food making process of that product. It's a big deal!\n\n\n\nSo, if you want to ease your brain, I suggest just one thing:\n\n\nLook up the things that scare or concern you, and become an internet expert on them. Know at what pH level certain bacteria forms at. Know how long food can sit out from the fridge before it is no longer foodsafe.\n\n\nHeck, take a ServSafe test and pass with above an 80%. Can you do 100%?\n\n\nKNOW how stuff works, how your favorite foods are packaged, and understand the processes involved. Google everything and, using your knowledge about how these bacterium form, you can know that things are.. actually really safe.", "The US is ranked 3rd overall worldwide on food safety. Many of the things wellness influencers will tell you is poison are not actually poison, and a good chunk of the things that Europe \u201cbanned\u201d isn\u2019t actually banned (red 40, for example, is still extremely common there under a different name)\n\nThe reason it looks like other countries have more food rules than the US does is because other countries will ban things based on a rule called Abundance of Caution. Meaning that if there\u2019s no definitive proof something ISN\u2019T harmful, they may ban it as a whole- even if said thing is actually perfectly safe with the average amount\n\nThe US instead investigates the substance, determines at what dosage it becomes harmful, and sets maximum legal limits for the substance. \n\nA good example of this is BHA; there was a major scare about it a while ago because it\u2019s a potential carcinogen.  BHA can indeed be carcinogenic; at thousands of times the dose you could consume in one sitting. It also caused cancer in the fore-stomachs of rats, an organ we/our dogs don\u2019t have. \n\nIn order for your dog to run the *risk* of getting cancer from BHA, they would have to eat several hundred, if not thousand pounds of treats like milk bone in a single sitting.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like how bananas are slightly radioactive, but you\u2019d have to eat tons of bananas at once to run the risk of radiation poisoning. Overconsumption would kill you well before radiation ever became a concern\n\nTLDR: food in the US is actually pretty safe and is, on average, MORE regulated than food in other countries. We don\u2019t have a problem with toxic ingredients, we have a problem with overconsumption", "You seem to be concerned about botulism.

{"title": "Will my DIY item be food safe?", "selftext": "I am working on making some DIY mallorn leaf food wraps. As I would like to sell them if I can get it to work right, I want them to be as food safe as possible.  \nThe inside that will touch the food is a beeswax wrap (homemade using cotton fabric, beeswax, pine resin and olive oil). And I know that is completely food safe. However, I want the outside to look like a real leaf and this is where it gets tricky.  \nThe leaf will be made out a sheet of EVA foam (heat carved to look like a leaf) and painted with flexible acrylic paint. This is on the outside, but I have found a way to coat the entire thing with a variation on my wrap wax so that the outside would be food safe as well if it comes into contact.  \nThe tricky part is a glue that is food safe and will glue the wax wrap to the foam. My tests with the glue I had onhand, the only one that worked definitely is not food safe. Someone suggested a food safe silicone glue, and the only one I can find is a sealant that says it adheres to things, so I'm going to give it a go. But it's contact food safe. (The one I'm looking for is CRC brand).  \nIf it does work, would it be safe enough to use as a food wrap considering that it will be seperated from the food by a thin layer of wrap wax?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1jjwgke/will_my_diy_item_be_food_safe/", "created_utc": 1742942014.0, "score": 2, "author": "KylasKhaos", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1jjwgke/will_my_diy_item_be_food_safe/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity", "top_comments": ["You seem to be asking if something is safe to consume.

{"title": "Does this Pizza Look Freezerburned or is my Freezer having a problem?", "selftext": "So, I was going through my freezer the other day, and I noticed there was one of these french bread pizzas (the Stouffers ones) tucked away in the door of the freezer (it must have fell down there somehow), and you can see where it was with the red circle on one of the images.\n\nThe pizza looked really funky, and it had this layer of ice over it. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this, and I couldn't tell if it was getting moldy or something.\n\nIs this some kind of issue with the freezer, or is this just run-of-the-mill freezer burn and this thing has probably been down there and forgotten about?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjudkg", "created_utc": 1742936824.0, "score": 2, "author": "TheGoodApolloIV", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1jjudkg/does_this_pizza_look_freezerburned_or_is_my/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity", "top_comments": []}
