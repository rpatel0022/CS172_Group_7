I thought others might benefit from having this information compiled in one place.\n\nSo far, I've only managed to cover Singapore and Melbourne; where I've personally visited some of these spots and the rest mostly from various online sources, with information about:\n\n* Restaurant details (location, cuisine type, price range)\n* Certification status (where available)\n* Signature dishes worth trying\n\nThis is very much a work-in-progress and based on my past experiences and lots of online research. I'm really just testing if this is something our ummah would find useful before investing more time expanding it.\n\nIf you have a moment to check it out, I'd genuinely appreciate any feedback:\n\n* Is this actually helpful?\n* What would make it more useful for you?\n* Which cities should I focus on adding next?\n* Any suggestions for improving the current information?\n\nI'd particularly love recommendations for additional restaurants in Singapore or Melbourne if you know of great spots I've missed!\n\nJazakAllah khair for any input.

When I was planning my trip, I couldn\u2019t find much info, so hopefully, this helps others searching for the same!\n\n\nHALAL FOOD IN BUCHAREST:\n\nI was surprised to find that there wasn\u2019t just 1 or 2 halal places \u2013 there were quite a few, especially in the Old Town Center. I found most of them just by searching \u201chalal\u201d on Google Maps. The food was really fresh and tasty, honestly better quality, portions than a lot of places in the UK.\n\nThere was a place called Efendi I remember going to, other from that I searched \u2018halal\u2019 on google maps, searched the area I was in, and went to one of those restaurants. But mainly they are donner kebabs. If you need more help with this let me know i\u2019ll reply quick. \n\nIf you\u2019re staying further out, there are also a few halal spots outside the centre as I saw on google maps.\n\nMY MUSLIM FRIENDLY EXPERIENCE IN BUCHAREST:\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but the city felt very welcoming. We were a group of men, and none of us wore headscarves, but overall, there was no judgment or weird looks. It was actually more relaxed than I expected, and I\u2019d say Muslim travelers shouldn\u2019t have any concerns visiting. It is obviously a Christian country, so don\u2019t expect shops to have prayer rooms, any mosques nearby or anything like that. You have to make your own efforts to find places to pray etc\u2026 There are mosques which may be a bit further out \n\nFinal Tips:\n\t\u2022\tUSE GOOGLE MAPS!!

When I checked online, a brand named \"Calnort\" had both requirements, but it seems based in Spain and I cannot seem to order it online??\n\nDoes anyone, by any chance, have any suggestions?\n\nThank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HalalFood/comments/1h9b6wt/gluten_free_halal/", "created_utc": 1733633385.0, "score": 2, "author": "monkeydlou", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/HalalFood/comments/1h9b6wt/gluten_free_halal/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The chaos surrounding coming home after a busy day can feel overwhelming.  Most of the time, the last thing on your mind is getting a meal on the table. Instead you find yourself inching towards your phone to order something in, even when you *know* eating fast food isn\u2019t healthy, or cheap!  But there are a few tips you can follow to make cooking at home easier and fun\u2026\n\n**1.** **Make it simple**\n\nOne of the best ways to keep you and your family motivated to cook is to start simply. Decide on something that won\u2019t take too long to prepare, because a complicated recipe and a long waiting time is the last thing you need once you get home!  Why not make things even easier with [Haloodies](http://www.haloodies.com/) amazing range of pre-cooked meats such as the halal hot and spicy chicken fillet, Southern fried chicken mini fillet and the battered chicken bites? They are perfect for hassle-free meals at home and guaranteed to be firm favourites with all. Serve with crunchy, nutrient rich salads, getting the kids to help with the chopping and adding of herbs. \n\n**2.** **Get everyone involved**\n\nMake sure to designate a job to each member of your family. Working together to prepare your meals feels less like a chore and a lot more like fun family time! Don\u2019t believe in \u2018too many cooks\u2026\u2019 The older kids can do the mixing and basic cutting and chopping while the younger ones can help wash the veggies and to lay the table.  Great conversations will ensue, and you won\u2019t feel the time you spend in the kitchen as a task. Plus, many hands make light work!\n\n**3.** **Decorate your kitchen**\n\nDon\u2019t worry, this is not a suggestion to completely overhaul your d\u00e9cor! Instead, add a few touches here and there. Add some colour and some kitchenware that jazzes things up a bit. If there are any areas that look cluttered, de-clutter and free up your counter space. You will be surprised how a few little details can make all the difference to how you feel in your kitchen. So, put out those pretty dishcloths and crockery and make your kitchen a special place that inspires you.\n\n**4.** **Plan ahead**\n\nDuring the weekend, get everyone together and plan your meals for the week. Sort out recipes that require fresher ingredients for Monday and Tuesday, and for the rest of the week go for meals that won\u2019t require many stops at the supermarket. When you stock up on groceries you will feel more inclined to come home and cook, the process being faster, easier.\n\nYou\u2019ll be surprised how soon cooking at home becomes an enjoyable routine that no longer feels like a chore!

When I was planning my trip, I couldn\u2019t find much info, so hopefully, this helps others searching for the same!\n\n\nHALAL FOOD IN BUCHAREST:\n\nI was surprised to find that there wasn\u2019t just 1 or 2 halal places \u2013 there were quite a few, especially in the Old Town Center. I found most of them just by searching \u201chalal\u201d on Google Maps. The food was really fresh and tasty, honestly better quality, portions than a lot of places in the UK.\n\nThere was a place called Efendi I remember going to, other from that I searched \u2018halal\u2019 on google maps, searched the area I was in, and went to one of those restaurants. But mainly they are donner kebabs. If you need more help with this let me know i\u2019ll reply quick. \n\nIf you\u2019re staying further out, there are also a few halal spots outside the centre as I saw on google maps.\n\nMY MUSLIM FRIENDLY EXPERIENCE IN BUCHAREST:\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but the city felt very welcoming. We were a group of men, and none of us wore headscarves, but overall, there was no judgment or weird looks. It was actually more relaxed than I expected, and I\u2019d say Muslim travelers shouldn\u2019t have any concerns visiting. It is obviously a Christian country, so don\u2019t expect shops to have prayer rooms, any mosques nearby or anything like that. You have to make your own efforts to find places to pray etc\u2026 There are mosques which may be a bit further out \n\nFinal Tips:\n\t\u2022\tUSE GOOGLE MAPS!!

The chaos surrounding coming home after a busy day can feel overwhelming.  Most of the time, the last thing on your mind is getting a meal on the table. Instead you find yourself inching towards your phone to order something in, even when you *know* eating fast food isn\u2019t healthy, or cheap!  But there are a few tips you can follow to make cooking at home easier and fun\u2026\n\n**1.** **Make it simple**\n\nOne of the best ways to keep you and your family motivated to cook is to start simply. Decide on something that won\u2019t take too long to prepare, because a complicated recipe and a long waiting time is the last thing you need once you get home!  Why not make things even easier with [Haloodies](http://www.haloodies.com/) amazing range of pre-cooked meats such as the halal hot and spicy chicken fillet, Southern fried chicken mini fillet and the battered chicken bites? They are perfect for hassle-free meals at home and guaranteed to be firm favourites with all. Serve with crunchy, nutrient rich salads, getting the kids to help with the chopping and adding of herbs. \n\n**2.** **Get everyone involved**\n\nMake sure to designate a job to each member of your family. Working together to prepare your meals feels less like a chore and a lot more like fun family time! Don\u2019t believe in \u2018too many cooks\u2026\u2019 The older kids can do the mixing and basic cutting and chopping while the younger ones can help wash the veggies and to lay the table.  Great conversations will ensue, and you won\u2019t feel the time you spend in the kitchen as a task. Plus, many hands make light work!\n\n**3.** **Decorate your kitchen**\n\nDon\u2019t worry, this is not a suggestion to completely overhaul your d\u00e9cor! Instead, add a few touches here and there. Add some colour and some kitchenware that jazzes things up a bit. If there are any areas that look cluttered, de-clutter and free up your counter space. You will be surprised how a few little details can make all the difference to how you feel in your kitchen. So, put out those pretty dishcloths and crockery and make your kitchen a special place that inspires you.\n\n**4.** **Plan ahead**\n\nDuring the weekend, get everyone together and plan your meals for the week. Sort out recipes that require fresher ingredients for Monday and Tuesday, and for the rest of the week go for meals that won\u2019t require many stops at the supermarket. When you stock up on groceries you will feel more inclined to come home and cook, the process being faster, easier.\n\nYou\u2019ll be surprised how soon cooking at home becomes an enjoyable routine that no longer feels like a chore!

When I was planning my trip, I couldn\u2019t find much info, so hopefully, this helps others searching for the same!\n\n\nHALAL FOOD IN BUCHAREST:\n\nI was surprised to find that there wasn\u2019t just 1 or 2 halal places \u2013 there were quite a few, especially in the Old Town Center. I found most of them just by searching \u201chalal\u201d on Google Maps. The food was really fresh and tasty, honestly better quality, portions than a lot of places in the UK.\n\nThere was a place called Efendi I remember going to, other from that I searched \u2018halal\u2019 on google maps, searched the area I was in, and went to one of those restaurants. But mainly they are donner kebabs. If you need more help with this let me know i\u2019ll reply quick. \n\nIf you\u2019re staying further out, there are also a few halal spots outside the centre as I saw on google maps.\n\nMY MUSLIM FRIENDLY EXPERIENCE IN BUCHAREST:\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but the city felt very welcoming. We were a group of men, and none of us wore headscarves, but overall, there was no judgment or weird looks. It was actually more relaxed than I expected, and I\u2019d say Muslim travelers shouldn\u2019t have any concerns visiting. It is obviously a Christian country, so don\u2019t expect shops to have prayer rooms, any mosques nearby or anything like that. You have to make your own efforts to find places to pray etc\u2026 There are mosques which may be a bit further out \n\nFinal Tips:\n\t\u2022\tUSE GOOGLE MAPS!!

I struggled finding soy sauce that was both alcohol-free and gluten-free, but I found a Japanese brand that checked both marks.\n\nNow here is my issue. For the life of me, I cannot find any chicken bouillon cubes that are both halal and gluten-free. When I checked online, a brand named \"Calnort\" had both requirements, but it seems based in Spain and I cannot seem to order it online??\n\nDoes anyone, by any chance, have any suggestions?\n\nThank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HalalFood/comments/1h9b6wt/gluten_free_halal/", "created_utc": 1733633385.0, "score": 2, "author": "monkeydlou", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/HalalFood/comments/1h9b6wt/gluten_free_halal/", "html_title": ""}

The chaos surrounding coming home after a busy day can feel overwhelming.  Most of the time, the last thing on your mind is getting a meal on the table. Instead you find yourself inching towards your phone to order something in, even when you *know* eating fast food isn\u2019t healthy, or cheap!  But there are a few tips you can follow to make cooking at home easier and fun\u2026\n\n**1.** **Make it simple**\n\nOne of the best ways to keep you and your family motivated to cook is to start simply. Decide on something that won\u2019t take too long to prepare, because a complicated recipe and a long waiting time is the last thing you need once you get home!  Why not make things even easier with [Haloodies](http://www.haloodies.com/) amazing range of pre-cooked meats such as the halal hot and spicy chicken fillet, Southern fried chicken mini fillet and the battered chicken bites? They are perfect for hassle-free meals at home and guaranteed to be firm favourites with all. Serve with crunchy, nutrient rich salads, getting the kids to help with the chopping and adding of herbs. \n\n**2.** **Get everyone involved**\n\nMake sure to designate a job to each member of your family. Working together to prepare your meals feels less like a chore and a lot more like fun family time! Don\u2019t believe in \u2018too many cooks\u2026\u2019 The older kids can do the mixing and basic cutting and chopping while the younger ones can help wash the veggies and to lay the table.  Great conversations will ensue, and you won\u2019t feel the time you spend in the kitchen as a task. Plus, many hands make light work!\n\n**3.** **Decorate your kitchen**\n\nDon\u2019t worry, this is not a suggestion to completely overhaul your d\u00e9cor! Instead, add a few touches here and there. Add some colour and some kitchenware that jazzes things up a bit. If there are any areas that look cluttered, de-clutter and free up your counter space. You will be surprised how a few little details can make all the difference to how you feel in your kitchen. So, put out those pretty dishcloths and crockery and make your kitchen a special place that inspires you.\n\n**4.** **Plan ahead**\n\nDuring the weekend, get everyone together and plan your meals for the week. Sort out recipes that require fresher ingredients for Monday and Tuesday, and for the rest of the week go for meals that won\u2019t require many stops at the supermarket. When you stock up on groceries you will feel more inclined to come home and cook, the process being faster, easier.\n\nYou\u2019ll be surprised how soon cooking at home becomes an enjoyable routine that no longer feels like a chore!
