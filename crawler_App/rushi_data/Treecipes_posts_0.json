{"title": "EUREKA!  I have perfected my \"ten drop\" tincture.", "selftext": "I have been trying to create a concentrate that travels well for discrete use and I think I have succeeded!    Here's my process.\n\nGrind up your herb as fine as possible (one ounce), I use a coffee grinder that I bought just for this process.  Decarboxilate by spreading it on a cookie sheet and baking for twenty minutes in a preheated 225 degree oven.  You'll know it's done when it's dry, slightly brown, and just starting to give off a cooked odor.  Put this in a canning jar and add two cups of grain alcohol, I keep my in the freezer but I'm not sure you need to.  Store the jar in the freezer for two days, shaking it every time you feel like it.  (I'm not sure the freezer storage is needed but that's what worked for this batch)  Poor through a coffee filter into a baking dish.  Place the dish in a food dehydrator (if you don't have one use a gentle heat source, like a heating pad, and a fan) When all the liquid is gone you should have a thin layer of the darkest, stickiest, concentrate you've ever seen.  Scrape this up with a razor blade and put it in a small glass jar.  If you can't get it all out of the corners use an ounce of grain alcohol to re-hydrate the rest.  Add this ounce of alcohol to the small glass jar with your sticky concentrate, seal tightly and shake frequently to dissolve.  If after a day there is still concentrate at the bottom of your jar you have saturated your alcohol, add a bit more and continue to shake occasionally, repeat this until everything is liquid.\n\nYou now have a high potency tincture.  I tried ten drops in my coffee (with cream) this morning and it gave me a pleasant high.  \n\nNOTE:  I scrape and then re-hydrate rather than re-hydrate in the baking dish because re-hydrating in the dish exposes a large surface area of your alcohol to the air and 190 proof grain alcohol evaporates quickly.  If you can perfect a tightly covered baking dish that should work too.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\nEDIT:  I almost forgot, you can soak your herb again to get a second batch but it'll be milder.  Also, once you have the sticky concentrate you can use butter or food grade glycerin or even bacon fat instead of alcohol.  This lets you make a huge variety of edibles from your trees.

I put both the ABV and liquor in a container and sealed the lid. I shook the mixture together for about 10 minutes, strained it through cheese cloth and mixed it with some soda and ice. If I were to do it again I would recommend fruit juice to mask the harshness of the alcohol. It tasted like high proof alcohol and baked weed, so, it wasn't great tasting and it looked like pond scum water. \n\nI drank the dank drank at around 9:45pm. At about 10:30pm I started to feel high.

There's no real recipe, add as much vaped remains as you have and can stand (they taste like shit, fyi) and then that's how much you need :-)\n\nThe second easiest method is cannabutter.  mix 2 cups of butter, with 1 cup of water and at least 10 grams of vaped remains.  Put them in a bowl and put the bowl in a slow cooker on low.  After 24 hours, strain it into a second bowl with cheesecloth as a filter.  Let it settle (you want the stuff that rises to the top and hardens, the liquid can be tossed it's worthless.\n\nThe third easiest is to make tincture or mix it with alcohol.  Please do not ever make tincture over an open flame.  Use a glass or ceramic covered stove and please keep a very close eye.  I can't give instructions that I feel comfortable with here.  The way I make it is inadvisable for safety concerns.  \n\nPlease remember anything with 50% or more alcohol in it, is generally flameable.  Alcohol burns clear, there are no visible flames, and it burns hot and fast.  Butane is the same way.  Please be beyond careful when dealing with volatile chemicals.  \n\nPeanut butter and cannabutter will get you extremely fucked up, you shouldn't venture further unless you are allergic to both!  Or if you have someone with experience to help lend a hand.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmqh2/vaped_herb_remains_avb_into_edibles/", "created_utc": 1286218886.0, "score": 26, "author": "superdug", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmqh2/vaped_herb_remains_avb_into_edibles/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I already posted this on another pizza post, but I figured out that this won't probably hurt anybody.. Let me give you the recipe for THE CHEAP AND NUTRITIOUS PIZZA.", "selftext": "Home made pizzas are really nutritious and cheap if you do them correctly. Perhaps the unhealthiest part is the crust, which is full of simple carbohydrates. This is the pizza I did yesterday. I do a ton of pizzas, they're cheap, nutritious, tasty, easy and fun to make, and easy to warm after a long day of work.\n\n    * 350g of normal flour\n    * 350g of rye flour\n    * 2 baggies of dry east (they're sold in 11g baggies over here)\n    * 2 teaspoons of salt\n    * 4 tablespoons of olive oil\n    * ~ 4-4,5dl of warm water (a bit warmer than your body's temperature so that the yeast will activate)\n\nMix the dry ingredients together. Mix the olive oil and water in another bowl. Pour the liquids over the dry's slowly and in small portions and do some kung fu. Pound the dough man. You don't necessarily need the whole amount of water, use it as much as needed to get a nice firm ball of dough. Then cover your bowl with a damp cloth and put it in some place warm. Let it rise for a hour or so, it should double its size.\n\nNow put your oven on. I like to warm it to 250C. Put the baking tray inside so that it will have time to warm up. This is necessary for a thin, crunchy crust.\n\nThen prepare your toppings. I use grounded meat + textured vegetable protein (that stuff which looks like ground meat when prepared) because it's cheap and pretty tasty. Tuna is good, as are pineapples and olives. Go apeshit!\n\nI like to buy some cheap marinara sauce from the market, they're only like 0,6e for a 400g pack. I usually mix some really spicy chopped dried chilies and some garlic in it for shits and giggles.\n\nAt the time when you have prepared the toppings and sauces the dough should be ready. I can do four really really thin pizzas from this amount. This way I can get the minimal amount of carbs in comparison to the amount of tastiness. After you have done the bases for your pizzas, put a ton of marinara sauce, a ton of toppings and a ton of cheese. Throw them to the oven. Bake for ten minutes or so.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nThe ingredients are really cheap. I can afford this and I live in a place where food is expensive as hell.\n\nSorry for my shitty English, I just woke up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dngf2/i_already_posted_this_on_another_pizza_post_but_i/", "created_utc": 1286346043.0, "score": 21, "author": "chillsmoke", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dngf2/i_already_posted_this_on_another_pizza_post_but_i/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I decided to have a go at the Green Dragon, in the name of SCIENCE! These are my findings.", "selftext": "Upon learning about green dragon tincture a couple days ago, I realized I had all the necessary supplies:\n\n* Extra kiefy shake and frosty nuggies, 6 g total. 4.5 g. shake, 1.5 g nuggies.\n* Everclear in the freeze (leftover from party, I don't drink that shit) \n* Thermometers, jars, parchment paper, my own kitchen to stink up, ect.\n\n**The Science:**I heated the oven to 300, and left it in for 4 mins (until I started smelling it. It was still green, but crispy.) I slid it off the parchment paper into 3 oz of everclear (95%), stirred it, and added it to the water bath. I boiled it for 25 minutes. I found that 165 degrees was the best temperature for the alcohol, and tried to keep it there where I had bubbles but it wasn't violent. After straining and french pressing it, my result was almost exactly 1.5 oz. The resulting liquid was dark green, and smelt like weed/grass. I covered it and allowed it to cool slowly before placing it into the fridge.\n\n**Results:** Without being previously high but having a high tolerance, I tried 5 ml (one common eyedropper, as recommended in the Wu article) at 10 o'clock and after 45 mins felt nothing. I added 2.5 ml at 11 pm. Again nothing. At 11:30pm I took another 5 ml, nothing. And at 12 I still felt nothing so I drank another 7.5 ml. (total 20 ml) At 12:30 I got frustrated and wanted to know if this was going to work or not, so I drank the whole lot of it (~25 ml) so total of about 45 ml in 2.5 hours. Nothing.\nI should note that I tried it straight, mixed with OJ (not bad), Lipton Bottled Green Tea (not bad), water (just dec. alcohol flavour, but more to drink), and gatorade (really bad). I also was on an empty stomach.\n\n**Analysis (TL;DR):** Well I didn't feel anything. I did get hungry, but I hadn't eaten before the experiment either. It had a powdery taste to it, as well as the dark green color (chlorophyll) I'm sure stains your teeth-tongue. It's scent is pungent, and too pleasant-thought NOT terrible. Smells like grass/weed.\nI know people swear they have had success, and I have friends that have. If I were to guess where I went wrong, I'd say I didn't bake it long enough. Some people say when they pull it out of the oven, it's turned to bronze. If I knew this worked, I'd probably just make it with kief. \n\n**My Errors:**So any seasoned green dragon riders know where I went wrong? I'll probably try one more time at least with everything the same, but increasing the oven time until the bronze stage is reached (figured that'd be too far, I guess not. I know the heat should help release the chlorophyll which has a huge effect on taste.) So.... Science?\n\n**EDIT:** Formatting, sorry about that. Thanks for the responses and suggestions, I posted this on r/trees but didn't get much back. I'm definitely still interested in Green Dragon and it's potential applications if I can get a solid recipe. I did all of this based on the fact most people said it worked and a lot still said it didn't (had to know what's up behind the mystery.) Sounds like it's worked for some of you all, so I'll be trying/refining other methods and posting my results in the future, for science!\n\n**EDIT 2:** Found my [source](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLsyYxGBFgw) and [source 2](http://boards.cannabis.com/concentrates/82380-definitive-green-dragon-revised-updated-combined.html) for the original Master Wu's recipe.

{"title": "How to determine dosage of your homemade edibles BEFORE you eat them", "selftext": "This is posted in multiple subs, sorry to those that had to spend more eyeball time on this than necessary. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed several posts asking \u201cHow many of these brownies do I have to eat?\u201d or \u201cHow strong do you think these gummies are?\u201d For harm reduction purposes, this is how you figure it out. Be prepared, you\u2019re gonna have to do math.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how much cannabis you used to make your edibles. If you bought it from a dispensary or you\u2019ve paid to have yours tested, that\u2019s great you know exactly the THC %. If you don\u2019t know how much the THC % is in your cannabis, you can make some assumptions. An assumption is a guess, and your guess is as good as mine or anyone else\u2019s. Dank 20%, Mid\u2019s 15%, Schwag 10%\n\nWe need to determine the total THC content you are working with. To do that, we will convert your total weight of cannabis used to milligrams then multiply that by the THC percentage. Let\u2019s say you have 7 grams of cannabis that tested at 20% THC.\n\n7 grams = 7000mg\n\n7000mg (cannabis) x 20% (THC percentage)= 1400mg of THC\n\nSo, in a perfect world (perfect extraction, accurate testing, God blowing the wind in the right direction, etc\u2026) you would end up with 1400mg of THC. Now divide 1400mg by the number of pieces you ended up with and you have an approximate dosage. Let\u2019s say you made gummies and ended up with 40 pieces.\n\n1400mg / 40 pieces = 35mg each\n\nWhat about 60 pieces?\n\n1400mg / 60 pieces = 23.33mg each\n\nWhat about if you want to make particular dosages BEFORE you divide everything up? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026\n\nI want 10mg doses\n\n1400mg / 10mg = 140 pieces\n\nTo make 10mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 140 equal units\n\nI want 70mg doses\n\n1400mg / 70mg = 20 pieces\n\nTo make 70mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 20 equal units\n\nHope this helps those that would have eaten too much otherwise. Sucks when that happens, but it happens. Most important is knowing that you\u2019re not gonna die. You just have to wait it out and hopefully know how much you took so you don\u2019t make that mistake again. However, once you know your upper dosage limit and you are willing to do the math, you\u2019ll never have to go through that again.\n\nCPT, Cannabis Pro Tips: \n\n1. Nothing good happens without a scale\n\n2. Assuming that testing results applies equally to every gram in the tested batch makes you a fool\n\n3. Home extractions will never be perfect. You\u2019ll never get 100% return unless you use the right tools in a perfect environment which most people (myself included) could never accomplish at home. Feel accomplishment with ever step forward knowing it\u2019ll never be perfect.\n\n4. Eating more edibles than your buddy DOES NOT make you a cooler person\n\n5. When you\u2019re friend doesn\u2019t want anymore, they don\u2019t want anymore. Quit asking.\n\n6. If in doubt, don\u2019t start with the whole thing or even 1/2, go with a 1/4.

{"title": "The Official How To Make 'Cannabutter' Guide", "selftext": "**Things you will need:**\r\n\r\n- Butter (or ghee - the less water content, the better)\r\n- Cannabis (trim, bud or shake). Use DRY!\r\n- Water\r\n- A crockpot/stovepot\r\n- A strainer (grape press, french press, cheesecloth or pantyhose)\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. **Combine Water w/ Butter over Heat.** Stir constantly and bring to a simmer (not boiling).\r\n\r\n2. **Add Your Cannabis.** You will need more trim than shake and more shake than bud. \r\n\r\n3. **Bring to a Simmer.** Keep heating the mixture and stir for anywhere between 1 to 8 hours - depending on the amount and potency of your cannabis (vs. butter). Stir at least every 30m - 1hr.\r\n\r\n3. **Strain Mixture.** Do this while still hot/warm. The more viscous the mixture remains, the more butter will come through in the straining process. If you are using cheesecloth - use multiple layers & secure over pot.\r\n\r\n4. **Squeeze!** Get every last bit of the butter out.\r\n\r\n5. **Refrigerate Overnight.** You should end up with a clean mixture of cannabis butter and water. \r\n\r\n6. **Separate.** The butter/fat will solidify on top. Slice around the side of the butter layer and push through & pull out your slice of cannabis butter :)\r\n\r\n**F.A.Q.**\r\n\r\n- **How much cannabis should I use?** There is no 'de-facto' butter:cannabis ratio. Do it by eye and improve over time. Some people say an 'oz of bud per cup of butter' - but each batch has a different potency and there will always be water loss if you're using butter.\r\n\r\n- **How hot should the pot be?** Cannabis boils off at around 365F (like in a vaporizer). The boiling point of water is 212F. You pot should never go over a rolling boil. Since the cannabis you're using is already dry, it will quickly dissolve into the fat at a simmering temperature.\r\n\r\n- **What should I do with the excess water/cannabis?** DUMP the water!! It's gross!! You will see all of the dirt and sediment at the bottom that comes from the cannabis.  As for the cannabis, if your butter is *super* green - and you think more potency might be left - boil it through another cup of butter to be sure.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use fresh trim?** Yes - but I don't recommend it. I've used buds straight from the plant and the trichomes will take MUCH longer to melt. The end product also tastes a little iffy.\r\n\r\n- **How do I know when it's done cooking?** Look for the trichomes. You should see them shrink as the cooking process goes on.  If you have no trichomes for reference - cook it until the plant matter is soggy and your pot is easier to stir. It should lose its green color eventually as well.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use stems??** Stems have very little THC content... and they will break your strainer. Best to keep stems out of the pot - unless they've been blended down.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmq0a/the_official_how_to_make_cannabutter_guide/", "created_utc": 1286217025.0, "score": 17, "author": "growthh", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmq0a/the_official_how_to_make_cannabutter_guide/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "[RECIPE] Medicated Hard Candy & Everclear Tincture", "selftext": "I was looking for things to do with the trim from my harvest and after a lot of searching hard candy seemed like the perfect option. I made an [Everclear tincture](http://i.imgur.com/mlU9E.jpg) and then used that to make my [first batch of hard candy](http://i.imgur.com/k5nZH.jpg). Two pieces had me feeling pretty damn good for hours and then knocked me out. \n\n**Everclear Tincture**\n\nWARNING: You will be working with a VERY flammable substance. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use an electric stove. If a gas stove is your only option, proceed at your own risk. I would recommend extensive ventilation around your stove to prevent alcohol vapor buildup.\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 1/4 oz. trees (I used 5-6g of some old bud, .5g kief, and all my trim from two plants.)\n\n* 1/2 cup Everclear or equivalent 190 proof grain alcohol (Your trees should completely submerged. If they are not, use more until they are)\n\n* 2 pint mason jars with lids\n\n* Cheese cloth or 2 cloth reusable tea bags\n\n* Grinder\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* 1 qt. saucepan\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F. (*See update at bottom of post*)\n\n2. While your oven is heating up, grind up all your trees and trim. It's important that the trim is properly dried.\n\n3. Put everything you ground up into one of the mason jars and place it on the middle rack in the oven for 5 minutes. This process is called decarboxylation and you can read up on why it's important. If you skip this step or heat it too high, it's worthless.\n\n4. Heat up 1 1/2 cups of water in your saucepan over medium-low heat. Put your candy thermometer in and get it as much into the water as you can without touching the bottom of the pan. This is BAD and will throw off your reading. Get the water to 190\u00b0F. You'll need to keep adjusting your burner to get it stable. Once it is steady at 190\u00b0F for 5 minutes without adjusting the heat, you are ready to proceed.\n\n5. Once your jar is cool to the touch, mix your everclear in. If your trees are not completely submerged, use enough to cover them. Place the jar in the pot for 30 minutes. The everclear will simmer but the water will not. Stir every few minutes with a fork so it doesn't burn.\n\n6. Strain the mixture through your cheesecloth or tea bag into your other jar. Squeeze as much as you can out of this. You can filter it once more if you still see floating bits. \n\n7. Store this in a cool, dark place until ready to use in your candy. Exposure to light can degrade the THC.\n\n---\n\n**Medicated Hard Candy (credit to /u/captaintrips420)**\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 3 qt. pot\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* Everclear tincture recipe from above (original recipe calls for 3g BHO)\n\n* Non-stick cooking spray\n\n* Newspaper or aluminum foil\n\n* Gloves\n\n* Plastic containers\n\n* Non-stick wooden or silicone spoon\n\n* [Candy molds](https://www.lorannoils.com/p-8611-sheet-mold-rectangle-breakup.aspx) (The recipe makes 2 to 2.5 sheets)\n\n* [Flavoring](https://www.lorannoils.com/c-6-super-strength-flavors.aspx) (BHO recipe calls for 1 dram, I would have used 1.5-2 for the Everclear tincture)\n\n* Food coloring\n\n* 1/4 cup powdered sugar\n\n* 2 cups sugar\n\n* 3/4 cup light corn syrup\n\n* 1/4 cup water\n\nPrep your work area. Lay down newspaper or aluminum foil on your counter to make clean-up a breeze.\n\n1. Mix your sugar (not powdered), corn syrup, and water in the pot and add your candy thermometer (do not let it touch the bottom of the pan) \n\n2. Heat using medium high heat. When it reaches 200\u00b0F, put in your BHO or tincture. (The original recipe didn't call for any stirring during the cooking process, but I would recommend stirring occasionally)\n\n3. When the candy reaches 320\u00b0F, turn off the burner and remove the pot from heat.\n\n4. Stir the mixture, add in 5-7 drops of your food coloring. Add 1-2 drams of your flavor oil and mix the shit out of the mixture (rather quickly, we don't want this to cool)\n\n5. Lightly spray your molds with non-stick cooking spray (have them done beforehand). Pour the mixture into the molds, spreading it out as best you can. Use a spoon to spread if needed. You don't want them so full that the divider between candies is covered. This will make them hard to break up later.\n\n6. Let cool for 15 minutes. Then put in the freezer for 5. \n\n7. Take the molds out of the freezer and, with gloves on, turn the molds upside and SLOWLY work the candy out of the molds. The molds can break if you are not gentle. Once the candy is out of the molds, break them apart. \n\n8. Put the candies in a plastic container with your powdered sugar. This will keep them from sticking together. Once they are evenly coated, place them into a clean plastic container to shake off the extra.\n\n9. Store these candies in a cool, dark place such as your fridge. Exposure to light can degrade the THC. 1-2 candies should give you a very nice body high depending on the potency of your tincture. Remember that these can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to kick in, so don't overdo it.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nThere were some varying opinions on the best way to decarboxylate so I went looking for facts. I found [this study](http://www.marijuanagrowershq.com/decarboxylating-cannabis-turning-thca-into-thc) that suggests 240\u00b0F for 60 minutes should be used.

{"title": "Looking for assistance with advanced THC extraction techniques", "selftext": "I have been using the green dragon everclear extraction with seemingly good results, but because of the flammibility of the entire setup and setting my kitchen on fire last night I would really like to move away from this process. I use the tincture extraction and then use the tinc for cooking, mainly lollipops, thus I do not want to use a butter/oil extraction as I dont like the taste of the butter/oil based lollipops. I have been reading about using glycerin for the extraction and would really like to start using that. What looks to be the best method for a glycerin extraction involves sealing the glycerin and chopped buds in a pharmaceutical grade beaker, and then cooking it for 36 hours at 311 degrees F. So i guess I just really want to know how I would go about doing this method safely, as this method sounds to be a little dangerous as well, any real chemists out there have some opinions as to the usefulness of this extraction, or any opinions would be greatly appreciated, relevant recipe included below.\n\n\n~~~Autoclave\n\nIf you have an autoclave, or a pharmaceutical grade glass beaker with threadlock top, than this next method is for you!\n\nTake 1oz of primo bud, not crushed but de-stemmed and totally and completely dried out. Toss them into a screw seal boiling beaker. Then, you must absolutely ABSOLUTELY use thread lock on the beaker. If you don\u2019t do this, its totally pointless to even try this method. \n\nPut the bud in the beaker with 1 cup glycerine; boil in your oven or on an autoclave at 155C or 311F; leave for 36 hours. It should be boiling for most of this time, but air should not be escaping the beaker. Remove and let cool. Upon cooling it should have separated into a green oily substance (which you want to keep) and a black thick tar, which in this case tested at 12% THC. The green oily substance in this case tested at 88% THC. \n\nThe bud should have completely and totally dissolved into the glycerine. That black tar stuff is all the plant material. It can be tossed if you like\u2026 or you could try drying it and smoking it, its up to you. (Thanks to Quanium for testing this for us!)\n\nOnce you have your drops, you can soak some of your normal bud in it to give it an extra little kick. Or you can put a few drops in a joint, or just on the top of a bowl in a bong. But by far the single best way to do this is to put just a few drops under your tongue and hold it there for about 2-3 minutes. Will make you go absolutely mad.

{"title": "Bac-n-cheese. Aw yeeeeeeee", "selftext": "I like this with macaroni and other bite-size pasta, but you could do it with any pasta you like; noodles, cut-up sheet pasta like lasagna, whatever. Pasta is pasta.\n\nFirst, the roux.\nA roux is basically equal parts fat (butter, oil, whatever) and flour, melted together in a pot and used to thicken sauces or soups or whatever.\n \n* Cut up some butter into little bitty dice, about two or three tablespoons per person, and melt it down on the stove like the fucking Terminator. Whatever that amount is, remember the number.\n \n* Whisk in the same amount of flour, a little bit at a time so it doesn't lump together. Good cheese-sauce is *smooth.*\n \n* Keep the roux warm, add the same amount of milk straight from the fridge - you want your roux hot and your milk cold, so they even out in the middle and make a nice warm sauce that gets that sort of shimmery-fatty shine on it. If you want thinner sauce, less shine - add more milk.\n \n* Keep whisking like hell, until it goes from yellowish thick stuff to pale-shiny-yellow-swirly-white thinner stuff that smells a lot better.\n \n* Season it if you want, salt, pepper, diced onion bits, cloves, bay leaf, whatever.\n \n* Turn the heat down on that shit, simmer it for about twenty minutes more so it doesn't taste floury all over your pasta.\n\nWait a second, the pasta!\n \n* Get a niiice big stockpot. Flatten out your hand on the inside wall of it, all your fingers straight vertical and touching the bottom. See where your wrist starts? Fill it with that much water **at least.**\n \n* Boil that shit until its bubbles look mad enough to leap out of that pan and fuck your mother. Add the pasta. Stir it all around if it gets frothy - that's the starch in the pasta reacting to being soaked in hot water, it'll make your pot boil over, *stir it* like hell so it doesn't. You don't always need to \"add a fat (oil, butter, etc.) to your water so the pasta doesn't stick together\" like Mom says, but it does help.\n \n* Add your pasta. Pick out a piece after three minutes, and bite through it. Do that every half a minute, until you're happy with how it feels. \"Al dente\" is about halfway done. For pasta with fillings, cook it all the way, you don't want raw meat and shit like that with your fucking awesome cheese sauce.\n \nWait a second, the cheese!\n \n* American and Cheddar. That just goes without saying. Add Gruyere or Gouda if you're rich and picky, mozzarella doesn't melt very well - better shredded on top, if you like - and stay away from bleu unless you actually like that on pasta. Weirdo.\n \n* Shred it, dice it, chop it up all to hell, doesn't matter, *more surface area is better.* Melts faster, easier, more evenly. It's the difference between a single huge block of ice in your cup of Coke, or a bunch of little cubes. Which one feels colder? The cubes one. Same principle.\n \n* Once your milk-and-roux sauce is done, is off the stove, *then* add the cheese. If it's not melting just from the heat of the sauce, put it back on the stove to simmer but watch it like a preteen pyromaniac. Bubbling is okay, a little. Smoking or burning is NOT. There will be CONSEQUENCES, young man. That's IT, you're grounded for a week, and NO BACON.\n\nWait a second, the bacon!\n \nYES. This is what will take your ordinary snoozefest shit-ass-boring mac-n-cheese and make it FUCKING AMBROSIA FROM HEAVEN, MY SON. Read carefully:\n \n* What's better than eating bacon while baked?\n \n* BAKING BACON WHILE BAKED.\n \n* Preheat your *so fucking lucky OMG you guys guess what my user put in me the other day* oven to 400 Fahrenheit, 200 Celsius, or gas mark 6.\n \n* Using any baking sheet or pan with an edge (even a cake pan, you can be resourceful! ^^) lay bacon out to cover the entire pan right up to the edges.\n \n* BAKE IT for 15-20 minutes, until it is FUCKING AWESOME.\n \n* Drain with paper towels on a separate plate.\n \n* Chop that shit the fuck up, and toss it into your newly-melted-cheese sauce.\n \n* Pour your steaming-hot saucepan of cheese-and-bacon-flavored love *all* over those innocent little pasta, the poor things.\n \n* WIN.

{"title": "Just found you. Here's my improvement to candied bacon.", "selftext": "There was a huge party going down. We even had tincture that had been waiting in a closet for months. I wanted to make sure the food was also suitably epic:\n\nFirst, you candy the bacon in whatever manner you find appropriate. (I suggest thick-cut in oven at 325 for 20 total minutes.) You put it in the oven covered in brown sugar or syrup or honey or a mixture, whatever. You bake it, flip half-way through and recoat, bake some more and then you have candied bacon. Use whatever recipe you like, but with one exception - **Undercook the bacon** (*unless you like it really crispy.*) I think the best way to go about this might be to cook at higher heat for less time, but I'm not sure. I just got lucky. Anyways, set the bacon to the side.\n\nMake some batter. I mixed guinness and flour so that it was thick and gooey. Two ingredients. That was enough for me. There are better and more advanced batters, but whatever. (You see where this is going.) There are multiple techniques for applying the batter to the bacon, but before you do that - \n\nGet out some oil and pour it into a wide pot. ^(You probably should not do this recipe high, but tincture usually takes awhile to hit me and it was the morning and I had only just dosed.) Heat that baby up. ^(Oil burns, yay!) For my stove, the right setting is medium. You can tell by checking if a wooden spoon or bamboo skewer or whatever bubbles.\n\n**Do not touch anything that has gone into the oil with your hands.** (unless it has cooled)\n\n*Optional, but recommended:* Put some plain batter in the oil and pull it out when it's a little brown. Let it get cool. Try it. See if it's overdone, underdone, etc. Use that time as a metric for the cooking time of the bacon.\n\nAlright, now that your oil is ready, apply the batter to the bacon. I had a medium to large width bowl that was very flat and not very tall, so I dragged the strip through, then dragged the other side through the other direction, like sweeping with a broom, but bacon and batter. (Whatever.) Put that bacon in the oil.\n\nYou want to set out some paper plates with paper on top to absorb oil/grease.\n\nI don't know what to tell you about how you can tell whether or not a deep-fried thing is done other than google some before and after pictures or videos of battered shit getting deep fried. I don't know. But, when it's done, place the bacon on the paper plates (or grates or whatever you set up). Do not stack.\n\nNow, you're still not done. You have all this wonderful deep-fried candied bacon. Now, you make a candied bacon funnel cake. Shake powdered sugar over this mess. It will be glorious. Do it. *It's like I have taste flashbacks.*\n\nTry one and only one. Only one. It's good, right? Now, GET HIGH. Eat the rest like God intended.\n\nOne of my friends was at roughly an 8, stuffed this down, and I saw her eyes tear up and open wide in delight.\n\n**TL;DR: Candied-bacon funnel cake**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/1mdwu7/just_found_you_heres_my_improvement_to_candied/", "created_utc": 1379180779.0, "score": 13, "author": "unampho", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/1mdwu7/just_found_you_heres_my_improvement_to_candied/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How to Hide the Taste of Weed in Edibles", "selftext": "Each cannabis strain has its unique taste, aroma, and effects. But, the most common flavour profiles notes in cannabis strains include words like:\n\n. Earthy\n\n\n. Smoky\n\n\n. Citrusy\n\n\nThough some of these flavours may pair well with edibles (citrus flavours and chocolate can be a winning combination), others do not, leaving people with a disappointing tasting edible.\n\n\nThe taste of each strain is determined by its terpene profile. With over 100 different terpenes possible, there are seemingly endless different flavour combinations created and found in plants.\n\n\nSo, how can you ensure your edibles don\u2019t taste too much like weed? There are some tricks you can use.\n\n\n1. Use concentrates or oils. Though you certainly can use cannabis flowers to make your edibles, concentrates are a great alternative. They are potent, so you won\u2019t need to use as much concentrate as you would a bud. Because less is used, their flavour will likely be fainter and easier to mask, but this would not sacrifice the effects that you expect.\n\n\n2. Make strong cannabutter and canna-oil. The majority of edibles are made using cannabis butter and cannabis-infused oil. These are often made in advance so people can use them as they want. To help temper the taste of weed in your creation, make your cannabis butter and oil potent so you can use less in your recipes. Many people half the amount of cannabis butter a recipe calls for and sub in traditional butter to make up the difference, leaving you with a great product that doesn\u2019t taste too much like weed.\n\n\n3. Go for the chocolate. Cannabis chocolate is an excellent edible option for those with a sweet tooth. It is also a perfect option for homemade edibles. Because chocolate itself can be a bit bitter and complex, this is considered a benefit when fusing it with cannabis. This bitterness can often overpower the weed taste more easily than other edibles.  \n\n\n4. Branch out from sweets. Though edibles most often refer to sweets and candies, there are tons of recipes out there on cooking with cannabis. Mixing cannabis products with heartier dishes that may contain other herbs can help temper the taste of weed.\n\n\n5. Match your flavours. Whether you are planning to cook using cannabis oil or a cannabis flower, you can do a lot to improve the taste of your edibles by ensuring the flavours complement each other. For example, if you are making chocolate, don\u2019t choose a CBD oil that is cotton candy flavoured. A vanilla or chocolate flavoured oil would likely work better. By ensuring your flavours all work together, you can create a more flavourful and delicious product.\n\n\nDid you try this before? If you can add more detail.\n\n\nSource : [BMWO](https://buymyweedonline.com/edibles/how-to-hide-the-taste-of-weed-in-edibles/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "created_utc": 1619190942.0, "score": 10, "author": "LessieDerrico", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I used a regular mug and covered it in foil, but I think anything would work.\n* Take the cannabis out of the oven and break/grind it up. This should be easier after it has been in the oven, and I used a combination of rolling it between my hands and using an actual mortar and pestle, which worked wonderfully. Simmer ground cannabis in oil for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. After 10 minutes, take off heat and let it cool for a few minutes. I didn't bother to strain the cannabis out.\n* Follow directions on brownie mix box. After mixing the ingredients, we just put them in an 8x8 greased glass pan and baked it for ~45 mins at 325 F.\n\nWe cut the pan into 9 squares and my girlfriend and I both had two. After about 20 minutes we both were feeling a pretty intense high, her more so because she doesn't smoke as much as I do.

{"title": "Horseshoe burgers, these things will hit the spot...", "selftext": "It seems these burgers are popular in the North, I learned how to make them in Illinois. Ingredients:\n\n1 lbs. of ground beef i prefer 90/10 but whatever you can get\nclove of finely minced garlic\n1/4 cup worchestershire sauce\nsalt and pepper\n1 medium sized pkge. thin sliced french fries\n1/2 stick butter\n1/4 cup flour\n1 to 2 cups milk\na package of sharp cheddar cheese\nassorted toppings such as bacon, grilled onion, mushrooms\n\nin a medium sized bowl mix ground beef, sauce, seasonings, and garlic together and mix by hand and form 4 patties. While these guys are sitting soaking up flavor you can start making the cheese sauce. In a medium sized sauce pan melt a half stick of butter over low heat, whisk in flour and continue whisking until it forms a paste-like consistency that is called a reux. slowly whisk in part of the milk and keep the heat on low reducing the mixture until it coats the back of a spoon. While this is going on you can heat up your fryer and your grill at which point you can start grilling your patties, just drop them in and let them go, excessive flipping and squishing with the spatula leads to moisture loss, cook them to desired level of doneness and then reserve, coving with aluminum foil. Fries are to be cooked normally and laid out on old newspaper or paper towel to soak up excess oil. They can be seasoned however you like them I prefer sea salt. Now you can finish the cheese sauce by adding in cheese bit by bit and whisking until the cheese is incorporated taste test and whenever it reaches your preferred level of cheesyness, add salt and pepper to taste and then have all the rest of you stoner friends too lazy to help come and start assembling the burgers. Start by laying down a hamburger bun/slice of bread then butting down your condiment of choice such as mustard, mayo, pesto, bbq sauce what have you, put your patty down on top of that then top with whatever your heart desires. I like this recipe because it helps to clear your fridge of leftovers. Top with a healthy handful or two of fries and then a large ladle of the cheese sauce. grab a bib and a fork and dig in!\n\nP.S.

Then I'd put it in the toaster and let it toast for like 10 minutes, basically as much as I can so that the toast does not burn. I'm also gonna put a sheet of baking parchment paper in the toaster to make cleaning easier. \n\nBut I have a question about this. First, is the time enough to release THC into the fats in cheese and bacon? Second, is there enough fat to absorb all the THC, assuming I want to put 0,5 g in one sandwich? \n\nMy other thought was to toast just the bacon + weed first, and then put it in the sandwich along with cheese and toast again. This way, the weed would be heated more, and maybe that would help.\n\nAnyways, does this plan sound like it would work?

{"title": "Bake yourself a present before you bake yourself. ", "selftext": "This is my apple cinnamon caramel roll recipe. I've got it started and I'm hoping to time it so that they will be hot out of the oven when my dude gets home. It's a bit of an involved process, you should probably do this before you smoke. If you do, your stoned self will get a super awesome crush on your not-stoned self.\n\nFirst, I start with this [dough recipe](http://baking.about.com/od/sweetrolls/r/brdmachcinnroll.htm). If you don't have a bread machine you can find recipes for regular cinnamon roll dough or you can buy frozen dough. \n\nWhile your dough is rising, peel and shred 2 apples into a bowl and put aside.\n\nFor the cinnamon sugar I do 1/2 cup sugar and about 1 tablespoon spices, it seems to be a pretty good ratio. You can do a full tablespoon of cinnamon or you can cut back on the cinnamon and mix in ground ginger, cardamom (my favorite), nutmeg or allspice. \n\nThe caramel part is optional. In a small fry pan (or sauce pan, you are the boss of your pans) toast a goodly handful of pecans (half cuppish), then add 1/2 stick butter and let that melt. To that add 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tbl water and 1 tsp cinnamon. Stir and cook until gets gooey bubbly. Pour this mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 pan. \n\nIf you do not make the caramel, then just generously butter a 9x13 pan and go forward.\n\nOnce your dough is ready, roll it out. The recipe I linked to recommends rolling it to a 10x15 rectangle. Personally, I prefer to roll it bigger and thinner which gives me more layers in my rolls and more layers means MORE DELICIOUSNESS! Melt a half stick of butter, then drizzle and brush it evenly over the dough leaving about an inch or so space around the edges.\n\nSprinkle your sugar mixture over the butter. Then grab up the shredded apple and SQUEEEEEEZE the excess moisture out and sprinkle the apple shreds over the dough.\n\nRoll that all up into a log and use some unwaxed dental floss to cut that log into rolls and put the rolls in the pan. Cover that up and let it rise about an hour.

Use DRY!\n* Water\n* A crockpot/stovepot\n* A strainer (We use an old T-Shirt stretched out, works pretty well)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Bring water to simmer\n\n2. Add Your Cannabis.\n\n3. Keep heating the mixture and stir for anywhere between 2 to 4 hours - Add water as needed\n\n4. When the water is less than a knuckles depth from the base of the pot, add the butter\n\n5. Lower heat slightly and bring butter to simmer\n\n6. Stir Regularly for 30-40 minutes\n\n7. Strain Mixture. Do this while still hot/warm. The more viscous the mixture remains, the more butter will come through in the straining process. If you are using cheesecloth - use multiple layers & secure over pot.\n\n8. Squeeze! Get every last bit of the butter out.\n\n9. Refrigerate Overnight. You should end up with a clean mixture of cannabis butter and a minimal amount water.\n\n10. Separate. The butter/fat will solidify on top. Poke a couple of holes in the butter and let the water drain (This is usually less than a quarter of a cup.)\n\nEDIT:Formatting", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmw3z/alternate_cannabutter_recipe/", "created_utc": 1286243844.0, "score": 1, "author": "Joelsomethingorother", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmw3z/alternate_cannabutter_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to Hide the Taste of Weed in Edibles", "selftext": "Each cannabis strain has its unique taste, aroma, and effects. But, the most common flavour profiles notes in cannabis strains include words like:\n\n. Earthy\n\n\n. Smoky\n\n\n. Citrusy\n\n\nThough some of these flavours may pair well with edibles (citrus flavours and chocolate can be a winning combination), others do not, leaving people with a disappointing tasting edible.\n\n\nThe taste of each strain is determined by its terpene profile. With over 100 different terpenes possible, there are seemingly endless different flavour combinations created and found in plants.\n\n\nSo, how can you ensure your edibles don\u2019t taste too much like weed? There are some tricks you can use.\n\n\n1. Use concentrates or oils. Though you certainly can use cannabis flowers to make your edibles, concentrates are a great alternative. They are potent, so you won\u2019t need to use as much concentrate as you would a bud. Because less is used, their flavour will likely be fainter and easier to mask, but this would not sacrifice the effects that you expect.\n\n\n2. Make strong cannabutter and canna-oil. The majority of edibles are made using cannabis butter and cannabis-infused oil. These are often made in advance so people can use them as they want. To help temper the taste of weed in your creation, make your cannabis butter and oil potent so you can use less in your recipes. Many people half the amount of cannabis butter a recipe calls for and sub in traditional butter to make up the difference, leaving you with a great product that doesn\u2019t taste too much like weed.\n\n\n3. Go for the chocolate. Cannabis chocolate is an excellent edible option for those with a sweet tooth. It is also a perfect option for homemade edibles. Because chocolate itself can be a bit bitter and complex, this is considered a benefit when fusing it with cannabis. This bitterness can often overpower the weed taste more easily than other edibles.  \n\n\n4. Branch out from sweets. Though edibles most often refer to sweets and candies, there are tons of recipes out there on cooking with cannabis. Mixing cannabis products with heartier dishes that may contain other herbs can help temper the taste of weed.\n\n\n5. Match your flavours. Whether you are planning to cook using cannabis oil or a cannabis flower, you can do a lot to improve the taste of your edibles by ensuring the flavours complement each other. For example, if you are making chocolate, don\u2019t choose a CBD oil that is cotton candy flavoured. A vanilla or chocolate flavoured oil would likely work better. By ensuring your flavours all work together, you can create a more flavourful and delicious product.\n\n\nDid you try this before? If you can add more detail.\n\n\nSource : [BMWO](https://buymyweedonline.com/edibles/how-to-hide-the-taste-of-weed-in-edibles/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "created_utc": 1619190942.0, "score": 10, "author": "LessieDerrico", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "html_title": ""}

Be prepared, you\u2019re gonna have to do math.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how much cannabis you used to make your edibles. If you bought it from a dispensary or you\u2019ve paid to have yours tested, that\u2019s great you know exactly the THC %. If you don\u2019t know how much the THC % is in your cannabis, you can make some assumptions. An assumption is a guess, and your guess is as good as mine or anyone else\u2019s. Dank 20%, Mid\u2019s 15%, Schwag 10%\n\nWe need to determine the total THC content you are working with. To do that, we will convert your total weight of cannabis used to milligrams then multiply that by the THC percentage. Let\u2019s say you have 7 grams of cannabis that tested at 20% THC.\n\n7 grams = 7000mg\n\n7000mg (cannabis) x 20% (THC percentage)= 1400mg of THC\n\nSo, in a perfect world (perfect extraction, accurate testing, God blowing the wind in the right direction, etc\u2026) you would end up with 1400mg of THC. Now divide 1400mg by the number of pieces you ended up with and you have an approximate dosage. Let\u2019s say you made gummies and ended up with 40 pieces.\n\n1400mg / 40 pieces = 35mg each\n\nWhat about 60 pieces?\n\n1400mg / 60 pieces = 23.33mg each\n\nWhat about if you want to make particular dosages BEFORE you divide everything up? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026\n\nI want 10mg doses\n\n1400mg / 10mg = 140 pieces\n\nTo make 10mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 140 equal units\n\nI want 70mg doses\n\n1400mg / 70mg = 20 pieces\n\nTo make 70mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 20 equal units\n\nHope this helps those that would have eaten too much otherwise. Sucks when that happens, but it happens. Most important is knowing that you\u2019re not gonna die. You just have to wait it out and hopefully know how much you took so you don\u2019t make that mistake again. However, once you know your upper dosage limit and you are willing to do the math, you\u2019ll never have to go through that again.\n\nCPT, Cannabis Pro Tips: \n\n1. Nothing good happens without a scale\n\n2. Assuming that testing results applies equally to every gram in the tested batch makes you a fool\n\n3. Home extractions will never be perfect. You\u2019ll never get 100% return unless you use the right tools in a perfect environment which most people (myself included) could never accomplish at home. Feel accomplishment with ever step forward knowing it\u2019ll never be perfect.\n\n4. Eating more edibles than your buddy DOES NOT make you a cooler person\n\n5. When you\u2019re friend doesn\u2019t want anymore, they don\u2019t want anymore. Quit asking.\n\n6. If in doubt, don\u2019t start with the whole thing or even 1/2, go with a 1/4.

Then I'd put it in the toaster and let it toast for like 10 minutes, basically as much as I can so that the toast does not burn. I'm also gonna put a sheet of baking parchment paper in the toaster to make cleaning easier. \n\nBut I have a question about this. First, is the time enough to release THC into the fats in cheese and bacon? Second, is there enough fat to absorb all the THC, assuming I want to put 0,5 g in one sandwich? \n\nMy other thought was to toast just the bacon + weed first, and then put it in the sandwich along with cheese and toast again. This way, the weed would be heated more, and maybe that would help.\n\nAnyways, does this plan sound like it would work?

Blisscuits, as I call them:\n\n[Picture Guide](http://imgur.com/RbuOdAQ)\n \nYou'll need:\n- 1 to 1.5g of cannabis bud per blisscuit\n- Peanut Butter (Smooth or crunchy but get the highest fat content you can find)\n- Nutella\n- Cookies / Sweet biscuits e.g. Arnott's Choc Ripple, YoYos, etc, 2 per blisscuit\n- Aluminium foil\n- An oven\n \n1. Preheat oven to 120*C (248*F)\n2. Make a small tray from aluminum foil\n3. Put your buds in the tray but DO NOT grind them as greater surface area increases the chance of burning\n4. Once the oven is preheated, bake the tray of buds for 15 minutes.\n5. While it's baking, spread the flat side of one bisscuit with peanut butter and then another with nutella, both about 0.5cm thick.\n6. Take the buds out of the oven and grind them up into a small bowl or something.\n7. Crank the oven up to 150*C (302*F)\n7. Use your hands to put even pinches of ground bud on to the peanut butter side of each biscuit, and press down gently so it gets stuck in.\n8. Sandwich each biscuit with its corresponding Nutella one, spread-to-spread, so the bud is in the middle.\n9. Wrap each sandwiched pair in aluminium foil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.\n10. Remove from oven and either leave to cool or put them in your freezer for 10 minutes.\n11. Consume and enjoy! I recommend trying one and waiting AT LEAST two hours, especially if you're new to edibles.\n \nHope you get as much fun out of them as I do :) Shameless plug: My liquid funk drum & bass mixes are especially good after eating a Blisscuit, and can be found at mixcloud.com/djmeow\n\nBon apetit!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/46dkyn/easy_45min_blisscuitfirecracker_recipe_no_butter/", "created_utc": 1455779604.0, "score": 8, "author": "B1-66-ER", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/46dkyn/easy_45min_blisscuitfirecracker_recipe_no_butter/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Just found you. Here's my improvement to candied bacon.", "selftext": "There was a huge party going down. We even had tincture that had been waiting in a closet for months. I wanted to make sure the food was also suitably epic:\n\nFirst, you candy the bacon in whatever manner you find appropriate. (I suggest thick-cut in oven at 325 for 20 total minutes.) You put it in the oven covered in brown sugar or syrup or honey or a mixture, whatever. You bake it, flip half-way through and recoat, bake some more and then you have candied bacon. Use whatever recipe you like, but with one exception - **Undercook the bacon** (*unless you like it really crispy.*) I think the best way to go about this might be to cook at higher heat for less time, but I'm not sure. I just got lucky. Anyways, set the bacon to the side.\n\nMake some batter. I mixed guinness and flour so that it was thick and gooey. Two ingredients. That was enough for me. There are better and more advanced batters, but whatever. (You see where this is going.) There are multiple techniques for applying the batter to the bacon, but before you do that - \n\nGet out some oil and pour it into a wide pot. ^(You probably should not do this recipe high, but tincture usually takes awhile to hit me and it was the morning and I had only just dosed.) Heat that baby up. ^(Oil burns, yay!) For my stove, the right setting is medium. You can tell by checking if a wooden spoon or bamboo skewer or whatever bubbles.\n\n**Do not touch anything that has gone into the oil with your hands.** (unless it has cooled)\n\n*Optional, but recommended:* Put some plain batter in the oil and pull it out when it's a little brown. Let it get cool. Try it. See if it's overdone, underdone, etc. Use that time as a metric for the cooking time of the bacon.\n\nAlright, now that your oil is ready, apply the batter to the bacon. I had a medium to large width bowl that was very flat and not very tall, so I dragged the strip through, then dragged the other side through the other direction, like sweeping with a broom, but bacon and batter. (Whatever.) Put that bacon in the oil.\n\nYou want to set out some paper plates with paper on top to absorb oil/grease.\n\nI don't know what to tell you about how you can tell whether or not a deep-fried thing is done other than google some before and after pictures or videos of battered shit getting deep fried. I don't know. But, when it's done, place the bacon on the paper plates (or grates or whatever you set up). Do not stack.\n\nNow, you're still not done. You have all this wonderful deep-fried candied bacon. Now, you make a candied bacon funnel cake. Shake powdered sugar over this mess. It will be glorious. Do it. *It's like I have taste flashbacks.*\n\nTry one and only one. Only one. It's good, right? Now, GET HIGH. Eat the rest like God intended.\n\nOne of my friends was at roughly an 8, stuffed this down, and I saw her eyes tear up and open wide in delight.\n\n**TL;DR: Candied-bacon funnel cake**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/1mdwu7/just_found_you_heres_my_improvement_to_candied/", "created_utc": 1379180779.0, "score": 11, "author": "unampho", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/1mdwu7/just_found_you_heres_my_improvement_to_candied/", "html_title": ""}

So our goal was to keep it between those temperatures.\n\nMy friend ate his first brownie right out of the oven, felt nothing for an hour and a half, so he took another. His gf, who has a bit of a lower tolerance than us did the same thing and felt nothing as well. I waited till the next  day to eat mine, so I ate them within 15 minutes of each other.

{"title": "[RECIPE] Medicated Hard Candy & Everclear Tincture", "selftext": "I was looking for things to do with the trim from my harvest and after a lot of searching hard candy seemed like the perfect option. I made an [Everclear tincture](http://i.imgur.com/mlU9E.jpg) and then used that to make my [first batch of hard candy](http://i.imgur.com/k5nZH.jpg). Two pieces had me feeling pretty damn good for hours and then knocked me out. \n\n**Everclear Tincture**\n\nWARNING: You will be working with a VERY flammable substance. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use an electric stove. If a gas stove is your only option, proceed at your own risk. I would recommend extensive ventilation around your stove to prevent alcohol vapor buildup.\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 1/4 oz. trees (I used 5-6g of some old bud, .5g kief, and all my trim from two plants.)\n\n* 1/2 cup Everclear or equivalent 190 proof grain alcohol (Your trees should completely submerged. If they are not, use more until they are)\n\n* 2 pint mason jars with lids\n\n* Cheese cloth or 2 cloth reusable tea bags\n\n* Grinder\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* 1 qt. saucepan\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F. (*See update at bottom of post*)\n\n2. While your oven is heating up, grind up all your trees and trim. It's important that the trim is properly dried.\n\n3. Put everything you ground up into one of the mason jars and place it on the middle rack in the oven for 5 minutes. This process is called decarboxylation and you can read up on why it's important. If you skip this step or heat it too high, it's worthless.\n\n4. Heat up 1 1/2 cups of water in your saucepan over medium-low heat. Put your candy thermometer in and get it as much into the water as you can without touching the bottom of the pan. This is BAD and will throw off your reading. Get the water to 190\u00b0F. You'll need to keep adjusting your burner to get it stable. Once it is steady at 190\u00b0F for 5 minutes without adjusting the heat, you are ready to proceed.\n\n5. Once your jar is cool to the touch, mix your everclear in. If your trees are not completely submerged, use enough to cover them. Place the jar in the pot for 30 minutes. The everclear will simmer but the water will not. Stir every few minutes with a fork so it doesn't burn.\n\n6. Strain the mixture through your cheesecloth or tea bag into your other jar. Squeeze as much as you can out of this. You can filter it once more if you still see floating bits. \n\n7. Store this in a cool, dark place until ready to use in your candy. Exposure to light can degrade the THC.\n\n---\n\n**Medicated Hard Candy (credit to /u/captaintrips420)**\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 3 qt. pot\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* Everclear tincture recipe from above (original recipe calls for 3g BHO)\n\n* Non-stick cooking spray\n\n* Newspaper or aluminum foil\n\n* Gloves\n\n* Plastic containers\n\n* Non-stick wooden or silicone spoon\n\n* [Candy molds](https://www.lorannoils.com/p-8611-sheet-mold-rectangle-breakup.aspx) (The recipe makes 2 to 2.5 sheets)\n\n* [Flavoring](https://www.lorannoils.com/c-6-super-strength-flavors.aspx) (BHO recipe calls for 1 dram, I would have used 1.5-2 for the Everclear tincture)\n\n* Food coloring\n\n* 1/4 cup powdered sugar\n\n* 2 cups sugar\n\n* 3/4 cup light corn syrup\n\n* 1/4 cup water\n\nPrep your work area. Lay down newspaper or aluminum foil on your counter to make clean-up a breeze.\n\n1. Mix your sugar (not powdered), corn syrup, and water in the pot and add your candy thermometer (do not let it touch the bottom of the pan) \n\n2. Heat using medium high heat. When it reaches 200\u00b0F, put in your BHO or tincture. (The original recipe didn't call for any stirring during the cooking process, but I would recommend stirring occasionally)\n\n3. When the candy reaches 320\u00b0F, turn off the burner and remove the pot from heat.\n\n4. Stir the mixture, add in 5-7 drops of your food coloring. Add 1-2 drams of your flavor oil and mix the shit out of the mixture (rather quickly, we don't want this to cool)\n\n5. Lightly spray your molds with non-stick cooking spray (have them done beforehand). Pour the mixture into the molds, spreading it out as best you can. Use a spoon to spread if needed. You don't want them so full that the divider between candies is covered. This will make them hard to break up later.\n\n6. Let cool for 15 minutes. Then put in the freezer for 5. \n\n7. Take the molds out of the freezer and, with gloves on, turn the molds upside and SLOWLY work the candy out of the molds. The molds can break if you are not gentle. Once the candy is out of the molds, break them apart. \n\n8. Put the candies in a plastic container with your powdered sugar. This will keep them from sticking together. Once they are evenly coated, place them into a clean plastic container to shake off the extra.\n\n9. Store these candies in a cool, dark place such as your fridge. Exposure to light can degrade the THC. 1-2 candies should give you a very nice body high depending on the potency of your tincture. Remember that these can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to kick in, so don't overdo it.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nThere were some varying opinions on the best way to decarboxylate so I went looking for facts. I found [this study](http://www.marijuanagrowershq.com/decarboxylating-cannabis-turning-thca-into-thc) that suggests 240\u00b0F for 60 minutes should be used.

{"title": "I decided to have a go at the Green Dragon, in the name of SCIENCE! These are my findings.", "selftext": "Upon learning about green dragon tincture a couple days ago, I realized I had all the necessary supplies:\n\n* Extra kiefy shake and frosty nuggies, 6 g total. 4.5 g. shake, 1.5 g nuggies.\n* Everclear in the freeze (leftover from party, I don't drink that shit) \n* Thermometers, jars, parchment paper, my own kitchen to stink up, ect.\n\n**The Science:**I heated the oven to 300, and left it in for 4 mins (until I started smelling it. It was still green, but crispy.) I slid it off the parchment paper into 3 oz of everclear (95%), stirred it, and added it to the water bath. I boiled it for 25 minutes. I found that 165 degrees was the best temperature for the alcohol, and tried to keep it there where I had bubbles but it wasn't violent. After straining and french pressing it, my result was almost exactly 1.5 oz. The resulting liquid was dark green, and smelt like weed/grass. I covered it and allowed it to cool slowly before placing it into the fridge.\n\n**Results:** Without being previously high but having a high tolerance, I tried 5 ml (one common eyedropper, as recommended in the Wu article) at 10 o'clock and after 45 mins felt nothing. I added 2.5 ml at 11 pm. Again nothing. At 11:30pm I took another 5 ml, nothing. And at 12 I still felt nothing so I drank another 7.5 ml. (total 20 ml) At 12:30 I got frustrated and wanted to know if this was going to work or not, so I drank the whole lot of it (~25 ml) so total of about 45 ml in 2.5 hours. Nothing.\nI should note that I tried it straight, mixed with OJ (not bad), Lipton Bottled Green Tea (not bad), water (just dec. alcohol flavour, but more to drink), and gatorade (really bad). I also was on an empty stomach.\n\n**Analysis (TL;DR):** Well I didn't feel anything. I did get hungry, but I hadn't eaten before the experiment either. It had a powdery taste to it, as well as the dark green color (chlorophyll) I'm sure stains your teeth-tongue. It's scent is pungent, and too pleasant-thought NOT terrible. Smells like grass/weed.\nI know people swear they have had success, and I have friends that have. If I were to guess where I went wrong, I'd say I didn't bake it long enough. Some people say when they pull it out of the oven, it's turned to bronze. If I knew this worked, I'd probably just make it with kief. \n\n**My Errors:**So any seasoned green dragon riders know where I went wrong? I'll probably try one more time at least with everything the same, but increasing the oven time until the bronze stage is reached (figured that'd be too far, I guess not. I know the heat should help release the chlorophyll which has a huge effect on taste.) So.... Science?\n\n**EDIT:** Formatting, sorry about that. Thanks for the responses and suggestions, I posted this on r/trees but didn't get much back. I'm definitely still interested in Green Dragon and it's potential applications if I can get a solid recipe. I did all of this based on the fact most people said it worked and a lot still said it didn't (had to know what's up behind the mystery.) Sounds like it's worked for some of you all, so I'll be trying/refining other methods and posting my results in the future, for science!\n\n**EDIT 2:** Found my [source](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLsyYxGBFgw) and [source 2](http://boards.cannabis.com/concentrates/82380-definitive-green-dragon-revised-updated-combined.html) for the original Master Wu's recipe.

{"title": "EUREKA!  I have perfected my \"ten drop\" tincture.", "selftext": "I have been trying to create a concentrate that travels well for discrete use and I think I have succeeded!    Here's my process.\n\nGrind up your herb as fine as possible (one ounce), I use a coffee grinder that I bought just for this process.  Decarboxilate by spreading it on a cookie sheet and baking for twenty minutes in a preheated 225 degree oven.  You'll know it's done when it's dry, slightly brown, and just starting to give off a cooked odor.  Put this in a canning jar and add two cups of grain alcohol, I keep my in the freezer but I'm not sure you need to.  Store the jar in the freezer for two days, shaking it every time you feel like it.  (I'm not sure the freezer storage is needed but that's what worked for this batch)  Poor through a coffee filter into a baking dish.  Place the dish in a food dehydrator (if you don't have one use a gentle heat source, like a heating pad, and a fan) When all the liquid is gone you should have a thin layer of the darkest, stickiest, concentrate you've ever seen.  Scrape this up with a razor blade and put it in a small glass jar.  If you can't get it all out of the corners use an ounce of grain alcohol to re-hydrate the rest.  Add this ounce of alcohol to the small glass jar with your sticky concentrate, seal tightly and shake frequently to dissolve.  If after a day there is still concentrate at the bottom of your jar you have saturated your alcohol, add a bit more and continue to shake occasionally, repeat this until everything is liquid.\n\nYou now have a high potency tincture.  I tried ten drops in my coffee (with cream) this morning and it gave me a pleasant high.  \n\nNOTE:  I scrape and then re-hydrate rather than re-hydrate in the baking dish because re-hydrating in the dish exposes a large surface area of your alcohol to the air and 190 proof grain alcohol evaporates quickly.  If you can perfect a tightly covered baking dish that should work too.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\nEDIT:  I almost forgot, you can soak your herb again to get a second batch but it'll be milder.  Also, once you have the sticky concentrate you can use butter or food grade glycerin or even bacon fat instead of alcohol.  This lets you make a huge variety of edibles from your trees.

I'm not trying to get karma I'm just trying to spread this because it works and its hard to find any info on it anywhere else.\n\n\nI mixed one tablespoon of ABV and 2 shots of grain alcohol(153 proof). I put both the ABV and liquor in a container and sealed the lid. I shook the mixture together for about 10 minutes, strained it through cheese cloth and mixed it with some soda and ice. If I were to do it again I would recommend fruit juice to mask the harshness of the alcohol. It tasted like high proof alcohol and baked weed, so, it wasn't great tasting and it looked like pond scum water. \n\nI drank the dank drank at around 9:45pm. At about 10:30pm I started to feel high. By 11:00pm I was at [6] and climbing. By 11:45pm I was a [9] and I decided to hit the ol' MFLB to get me to a [10]. I watched Osmosis Jones and by 12:35am I was still very high, probably around a [8]. I went to bed around then and woke up at 8:10am and was still high at about a [2].\nI would definitely recommend trying this if you have some abv laying around. The alcohol buzz transitions very nicely to your high, and the high was a very happy one. I had a smile on face until I went to bed and I laughed like crazy at the movie. I smoke(vape) everyday so my tolerance is pretty high. If I were to smoke the same amount(tbsp) of abv I would be high for a little more than an hour.

{"title": "Looking for assistance with advanced THC extraction techniques", "selftext": "I have been using the green dragon everclear extraction with seemingly good results, but because of the flammibility of the entire setup and setting my kitchen on fire last night I would really like to move away from this process. I use the tincture extraction and then use the tinc for cooking, mainly lollipops, thus I do not want to use a butter/oil extraction as I dont like the taste of the butter/oil based lollipops. I have been reading about using glycerin for the extraction and would really like to start using that. What looks to be the best method for a glycerin extraction involves sealing the glycerin and chopped buds in a pharmaceutical grade beaker, and then cooking it for 36 hours at 311 degrees F. So i guess I just really want to know how I would go about doing this method safely, as this method sounds to be a little dangerous as well, any real chemists out there have some opinions as to the usefulness of this extraction, or any opinions would be greatly appreciated, relevant recipe included below.\n\n\n~~~Autoclave\n\nIf you have an autoclave, or a pharmaceutical grade glass beaker with threadlock top, than this next method is for you!\n\nTake 1oz of primo bud, not crushed but de-stemmed and totally and completely dried out. Toss them into a screw seal boiling beaker. Then, you must absolutely ABSOLUTELY use thread lock on the beaker. If you don\u2019t do this, its totally pointless to even try this method. \n\nPut the bud in the beaker with 1 cup glycerine; boil in your oven or on an autoclave at 155C or 311F; leave for 36 hours. It should be boiling for most of this time, but air should not be escaping the beaker. Remove and let cool. Upon cooling it should have separated into a green oily substance (which you want to keep) and a black thick tar, which in this case tested at 12% THC. The green oily substance in this case tested at 88% THC. \n\nThe bud should have completely and totally dissolved into the glycerine. That black tar stuff is all the plant material. It can be tossed if you like\u2026 or you could try drying it and smoking it, its up to you. (Thanks to Quanium for testing this for us!)\n\nOnce you have your drops, you can soak some of your normal bud in it to give it an extra little kick. Or you can put a few drops in a joint, or just on the top of a bowl in a bong. But by far the single best way to do this is to put just a few drops under your tongue and hold it there for about 2-3 minutes. Will make you go absolutely mad.

{"title": "Bake yourself a present before you bake yourself. ", "selftext": "This is my apple cinnamon caramel roll recipe. I've got it started and I'm hoping to time it so that they will be hot out of the oven when my dude gets home. It's a bit of an involved process, you should probably do this before you smoke. If you do, your stoned self will get a super awesome crush on your not-stoned self.\n\nFirst, I start with this [dough recipe](http://baking.about.com/od/sweetrolls/r/brdmachcinnroll.htm). If you don't have a bread machine you can find recipes for regular cinnamon roll dough or you can buy frozen dough. \n\nWhile your dough is rising, peel and shred 2 apples into a bowl and put aside.\n\nFor the cinnamon sugar I do 1/2 cup sugar and about 1 tablespoon spices, it seems to be a pretty good ratio. You can do a full tablespoon of cinnamon or you can cut back on the cinnamon and mix in ground ginger, cardamom (my favorite), nutmeg or allspice. \n\nThe caramel part is optional. In a small fry pan (or sauce pan, you are the boss of your pans) toast a goodly handful of pecans (half cuppish), then add 1/2 stick butter and let that melt. To that add 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tbl water and 1 tsp cinnamon. Stir and cook until gets gooey bubbly. Pour this mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 pan. \n\nIf you do not make the caramel, then just generously butter a 9x13 pan and go forward.\n\nOnce your dough is ready, roll it out. The recipe I linked to recommends rolling it to a 10x15 rectangle. Personally, I prefer to roll it bigger and thinner which gives me more layers in my rolls and more layers means MORE DELICIOUSNESS! Melt a half stick of butter, then drizzle and brush it evenly over the dough leaving about an inch or so space around the edges.\n\nSprinkle your sugar mixture over the butter. Then grab up the shredded apple and SQUEEEEEEZE the excess moisture out and sprinkle the apple shreds over the dough.\n\nRoll that all up into a log and use some unwaxed dental floss to cut that log into rolls and put the rolls in the pan. Cover that up and let it rise about an hour.  Then bake at 375 for 25-30 minutes.\n\nIf you made the caramel sauce it's pretty important to pop these babies out of the pan before the sauce cools and hardens. Just put a cutting board over the pan and flip that right over. \n\nI'm off to roll them out.

Perhaps there should be a common pizza recipe thread for easy reference?\n I've been making the dough from scratch about two years, here's my unrequited advice.\nsome people say to mix yeast in with the flour, I've had the best results fermenting(proofing) the yeast in 60-70 degree water with dissolved molasses. Honey and brown sugar are good feedstock also.  I set the yeast to grow while i measure and mix the dry ingredients.  the basic water/flour ratio is 1:3, with wiggle room depending on the type of flour.  More coarse flour requires more water.  The best benefit to making your own dough is that you can spice it to suit the other ingredients.  I generally use cumin, turmeric, paprika, black pepper, chili flakes, and garlic powder.  Powdered garlic has a simpler flavor, but it's easier to disperse into the dough.  Let the dough rise about 6 hours, or a few days if you want beer bread.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dxfp9/pizza_recipes_thread/", "created_utc": 1288221910.0, "score": 6, "author": "None", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dxfp9/pizza_recipes_thread/", "html_title": ""}

Perhaps the unhealthiest part is the crust, which is full of simple carbohydrates. This is the pizza I did yesterday. I do a ton of pizzas, they're cheap, nutritious, tasty, easy and fun to make, and easy to warm after a long day of work.\n\n    * 350g of normal flour\n    * 350g of rye flour\n    * 2 baggies of dry east (they're sold in 11g baggies over here)\n    * 2 teaspoons of salt\n    * 4 tablespoons of olive oil\n    * ~ 4-4,5dl of warm water (a bit warmer than your body's temperature so that the yeast will activate)\n\nMix the dry ingredients together. Mix the olive oil and water in another bowl. Pour the liquids over the dry's slowly and in small portions and do some kung fu. Pound the dough man. You don't necessarily need the whole amount of water, use it as much as needed to get a nice firm ball of dough. Then cover your bowl with a damp cloth and put it in some place warm. Let it rise for a hour or so, it should double its size.\n\nNow put your oven on. I like to warm it to 250C. Put the baking tray inside so that it will have time to warm up. This is necessary for a thin, crunchy crust.\n\nThen prepare your toppings. I use grounded meat + textured vegetable protein (that stuff which looks like ground meat when prepared) because it's cheap and pretty tasty. Tuna is good, as are pineapples and olives. Go apeshit!\n\nI like to buy some cheap marinara sauce from the market, they're only like 0,6e for a 400g pack. I usually mix some really spicy chopped dried chilies and some garlic in it for shits and giggles.\n\nAt the time when you have prepared the toppings and sauces the dough should be ready. I can do four really really thin pizzas from this amount. This way I can get the minimal amount of carbs in comparison to the amount of tastiness. After you have done the bases for your pizzas, put a ton of marinara sauce, a ton of toppings and a ton of cheese. Throw them to the oven. Bake for ten minutes or so.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nThe ingredients are really cheap.

{"title": "Bac-n-cheese. Aw yeeeeeeee", "selftext": "I like this with macaroni and other bite-size pasta, but you could do it with any pasta you like; noodles, cut-up sheet pasta like lasagna, whatever. Pasta is pasta.\n\nFirst, the roux.\nA roux is basically equal parts fat (butter, oil, whatever) and flour, melted together in a pot and used to thicken sauces or soups or whatever.\n \n* Cut up some butter into little bitty dice, about two or three tablespoons per person, and melt it down on the stove like the fucking Terminator. Whatever that amount is, remember the number.\n \n* Whisk in the same amount of flour, a little bit at a time so it doesn't lump together. Good cheese-sauce is *smooth.*\n \n* Keep the roux warm, add the same amount of milk straight from the fridge - you want your roux hot and your milk cold, so they even out in the middle and make a nice warm sauce that gets that sort of shimmery-fatty shine on it. If you want thinner sauce, less shine - add more milk.\n \n* Keep whisking like hell, until it goes from yellowish thick stuff to pale-shiny-yellow-swirly-white thinner stuff that smells a lot better.\n \n* Season it if you want, salt, pepper, diced onion bits, cloves, bay leaf, whatever.\n \n* Turn the heat down on that shit, simmer it for about twenty minutes more so it doesn't taste floury all over your pasta.\n\nWait a second, the pasta!\n \n* Get a niiice big stockpot. Flatten out your hand on the inside wall of it, all your fingers straight vertical and touching the bottom. See where your wrist starts? Fill it with that much water **at least.**\n \n* Boil that shit until its bubbles look mad enough to leap out of that pan and fuck your mother. Add the pasta. Stir it all around if it gets frothy - that's the starch in the pasta reacting to being soaked in hot water, it'll make your pot boil over, *stir it* like hell so it doesn't. You don't always need to \"add a fat (oil, butter, etc.) to your water so the pasta doesn't stick together\" like Mom says, but it does help.\n \n* Add your pasta. Pick out a piece after three minutes, and bite through it. Do that every half a minute, until you're happy with how it feels. \"Al dente\" is about halfway done. For pasta with fillings, cook it all the way, you don't want raw meat and shit like that with your fucking awesome cheese sauce.\n \nWait a second, the cheese!\n \n* American and Cheddar. That just goes without saying. Add Gruyere or Gouda if you're rich and picky, mozzarella doesn't melt very well - better shredded on top, if you like - and stay away from bleu unless you actually like that on pasta. Weirdo.\n \n* Shred it, dice it, chop it up all to hell, doesn't matter, *more surface area is better.* Melts faster, easier, more evenly. It's the difference between a single huge block of ice in your cup of Coke, or a bunch of little cubes. Which one feels colder? The cubes one. Same principle.\n \n* Once your milk-and-roux sauce is done, is off the stove, *then* add the cheese. If it's not melting just from the heat of the sauce, put it back on the stove to simmer but watch it like a preteen pyromaniac. Bubbling is okay, a little. Smoking or burning is NOT. There will be CONSEQUENCES, young man. That's IT, you're grounded for a week, and NO BACON.\n\nWait a second, the bacon!\n \nYES. This is what will take your ordinary snoozefest shit-ass-boring mac-n-cheese and make it FUCKING AMBROSIA FROM HEAVEN, MY SON. Read carefully:\n \n* What's better than eating bacon while baked?\n \n* BAKING BACON WHILE BAKED.\n \n* Preheat your *so fucking lucky OMG you guys guess what my user put in me the other day* oven to 400 Fahrenheit, 200 Celsius, or gas mark 6.\n \n* Using any baking sheet or pan with an edge (even a cake pan, you can be resourceful! ^^) lay bacon out to cover the entire pan right up to the edges.\n \n* BAKE IT for 15-20 minutes, until it is FUCKING AWESOME.\n \n* Drain with paper towels on a separate plate.\n \n* Chop that shit the fuck up, and toss it into your newly-melted-cheese sauce.\n \n* Pour your steaming-hot saucepan of cheese-and-bacon-flavored love *all* over those innocent little pasta, the poor things.\n \n* WIN.

This gives you optimal surface area!\n\nGenerally most vaped remains are almost entirely decarbolaxed (sp?) so you don't have to take into account some of the recipes that tell you to heat up your edibles.\n\nThe easiest way to get high off of edibles made from vaped remains is to grind them into a powder, mix with peanut butter, microwave until its soupy, stir, then let it cool down.\n\nYou can make cookies, sandwhiches, etc. with it.  There's no real recipe, add as much vaped remains as you have and can stand (they taste like shit, fyi) and then that's how much you need :-)\n\nThe second easiest method is cannabutter.  mix 2 cups of butter, with 1 cup of water and at least 10 grams of vaped remains.  Put them in a bowl and put the bowl in a slow cooker on low.  After 24 hours, strain it into a second bowl with cheesecloth as a filter.  Let it settle (you want the stuff that rises to the top and hardens, the liquid can be tossed it's worthless.\n\nThe third easiest is to make tincture or mix it with alcohol.  Please do not ever make tincture over an open flame.  Use a glass or ceramic covered stove and please keep a very close eye.  I can't give instructions that I feel comfortable with here.  The way I make it is inadvisable for safety concerns.  \n\nPlease remember anything with 50% or more alcohol in it, is generally flameable.  Alcohol burns clear, there are no visible flames, and it burns hot and fast.  Butane is the same way.

{"title": "The Official How To Make 'Cannabutter' Guide", "selftext": "**Things you will need:**\r\n\r\n- Butter (or ghee - the less water content, the better)\r\n- Cannabis (trim, bud or shake). Use DRY!\r\n- Water\r\n- A crockpot/stovepot\r\n- A strainer (grape press, french press, cheesecloth or pantyhose)\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. **Combine Water w/ Butter over Heat.** Stir constantly and bring to a simmer (not boiling).\r\n\r\n2. **Add Your Cannabis.** You will need more trim than shake and more shake than bud. \r\n\r\n3. **Bring to a Simmer.** Keep heating the mixture and stir for anywhere between 1 to 8 hours - depending on the amount and potency of your cannabis (vs. butter). Stir at least every 30m - 1hr.\r\n\r\n3. **Strain Mixture.** Do this while still hot/warm. The more viscous the mixture remains, the more butter will come through in the straining process. If you are using cheesecloth - use multiple layers & secure over pot.\r\n\r\n4. **Squeeze!** Get every last bit of the butter out.\r\n\r\n5. **Refrigerate Overnight.** You should end up with a clean mixture of cannabis butter and water. \r\n\r\n6. **Separate.** The butter/fat will solidify on top. Slice around the side of the butter layer and push through & pull out your slice of cannabis butter :)\r\n\r\n**F.A.Q.**\r\n\r\n- **How much cannabis should I use?** There is no 'de-facto' butter:cannabis ratio. Do it by eye and improve over time. Some people say an 'oz of bud per cup of butter' - but each batch has a different potency and there will always be water loss if you're using butter.\r\n\r\n- **How hot should the pot be?** Cannabis boils off at around 365F (like in a vaporizer). The boiling point of water is 212F. You pot should never go over a rolling boil. Since the cannabis you're using is already dry, it will quickly dissolve into the fat at a simmering temperature.\r\n\r\n- **What should I do with the excess water/cannabis?** DUMP the water!! It's gross!! You will see all of the dirt and sediment at the bottom that comes from the cannabis.  As for the cannabis, if your butter is *super* green - and you think more potency might be left - boil it through another cup of butter to be sure.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use fresh trim?** Yes - but I don't recommend it. I've used buds straight from the plant and the trichomes will take MUCH longer to melt. The end product also tastes a little iffy.\r\n\r\n- **How do I know when it's done cooking?** Look for the trichomes. You should see them shrink as the cooking process goes on.  If you have no trichomes for reference - cook it until the plant matter is soggy and your pot is easier to stir. It should lose its green color eventually as well.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use stems??** Stems have very little THC content... and they will break your strainer. Best to keep stems out of the pot - unless they've been blended down.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmq0a/the_official_how_to_make_cannabutter_guide/", "created_utc": 1286217025.0, "score": 18, "author": "growthh", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmq0a/the_official_how_to_make_cannabutter_guide/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Horseshoe burgers, these things will hit the spot...", "selftext": "It seems these burgers are popular in the North, I learned how to make them in Illinois. Ingredients:\n\n1 lbs. of ground beef i prefer 90/10 but whatever you can get\nclove of finely minced garlic\n1/4 cup worchestershire sauce\nsalt and pepper\n1 medium sized pkge. thin sliced french fries\n1/2 stick butter\n1/4 cup flour\n1 to 2 cups milk\na package of sharp cheddar cheese\nassorted toppings such as bacon, grilled onion, mushrooms\n\nin a medium sized bowl mix ground beef, sauce, seasonings, and garlic together and mix by hand and form 4 patties. While these guys are sitting soaking up flavor you can start making the cheese sauce. In a medium sized sauce pan melt a half stick of butter over low heat, whisk in flour and continue whisking until it forms a paste-like consistency that is called a reux. slowly whisk in part of the milk and keep the heat on low reducing the mixture until it coats the back of a spoon. While this is going on you can heat up your fryer and your grill at which point you can start grilling your patties, just drop them in and let them go, excessive flipping and squishing with the spatula leads to moisture loss, cook them to desired level of doneness and then reserve, coving with aluminum foil. Fries are to be cooked normally and laid out on old newspaper or paper towel to soak up excess oil. They can be seasoned however you like them I prefer sea salt. Now you can finish the cheese sauce by adding in cheese bit by bit and whisking until the cheese is incorporated taste test and whenever it reaches your preferred level of cheesyness, add salt and pepper to taste and then have all the rest of you stoner friends too lazy to help come and start assembling the burgers. Start by laying down a hamburger bun/slice of bread then butting down your condiment of choice such as mustard, mayo, pesto, bbq sauce what have you, put your patty down on top of that then top with whatever your heart desires. I like this recipe because it helps to clear your fridge of leftovers. Top with a healthy handful or two of fries and then a large ladle of the cheese sauce. grab a bib and a fork and dig in!\n\nP.S.

{"title": "Alternate Cannabutter recipe", "selftext": "So i noted two cannabutter recipes both of which involved melting the butter at the start, my mates and I do this slightly differently so I thought I'd chuck it up here for posterity.\n\n\n\nFor consistency I'll steal [growthh's formatting from the \"Official how to make cannabutter Guide\" (and the wording where the recipe is the same.)](http://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmq0a/the_official_how_to_make_cannabutter_guide/)\n\n\n\nWe use around 375gm:1/4oz Butter to bud ratio.\n\n\n\n**Things you will need:**\n\n* Butter \n* Cannabis (trim, bud or shake). Use DRY!\n* Water\n* A crockpot/stovepot\n* A strainer (We use an old T-Shirt stretched out, works pretty well)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Bring water to simmer\n\n2. Add Your Cannabis.\n\n3. Keep heating the mixture and stir for anywhere between 2 to 4 hours - Add water as needed\n\n4. When the water is less than a knuckles depth from the base of the pot, add the butter\n\n5. Lower heat slightly and bring butter to simmer\n\n6. Stir Regularly for 30-40 minutes\n\n7. Strain Mixture. Do this while still hot/warm. The more viscous the mixture remains, the more butter will come through in the straining process. If you are using cheesecloth - use multiple layers & secure over pot.\n\n8. Squeeze! Get every last bit of the butter out.\n\n9. Refrigerate Overnight. You should end up with a clean mixture of cannabis butter and a minimal amount water.\n\n10. Separate. The butter/fat will solidify on top. Poke a couple of holes in the butter and let the water drain (This is usually less than a quarter of a cup.)\n\nEDIT:Formatting", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmw3z/alternate_cannabutter_recipe/", "created_utc": 1286243844.0, "score": 1, "author": "Joelsomethingorother", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmw3z/alternate_cannabutter_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

When onions are done, remove them from the frying pan or push them to a corner and put tortilla on pan.\n\n\nSpoon the caramelized onions on top of the eggplant spread (which is on the tortilla), then put the shredded mexican blend, several thin slices of pepperjack, and several crumbles of the feta cheese evenly on top of it all. Evenly drip a small amount of salsa in various places on top of the cheeses. Powder it all lightly with ground sage.  Then fold other half of tortilla (or put second tortilla on top of first) on top of the side full of the ingredients. \n\n\nPress tortilla sandwich softly with spatula to help mush everything together, then flip every 3 minutes or so to evenly brown the sides till desired crispiness.\n\n\nEnjoy. \n\n*P.S.  When I say thin layer/thin slice/small amount I do mean pretty thin, maybe 1 mm thin slices and like...dime sized drops of salsa.  It's tempting to make a loaded, exploding quesadilla when you're high, but with all the ingredients in this one the key is subtlety in order to get the most flavor out of everything. The mexican blend is the thickest of the layers, and in the end no quesadilla should ever be thicker than 1-1.5 cm, even with chicken.* \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmyib/fusion_quesadilla/", "created_utc": 1286255939.0, "score": 0, "author": "minimalist_reply", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmyib/fusion_quesadilla/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How to Hide the Taste of Weed in Edibles", "selftext": "Each cannabis strain has its unique taste, aroma, and effects. But, the most common flavour profiles notes in cannabis strains include words like:\n\n. Earthy\n\n\n. Smoky\n\n\n. Citrusy\n\n\nThough some of these flavours may pair well with edibles (citrus flavours and chocolate can be a winning combination), others do not, leaving people with a disappointing tasting edible.\n\n\nThe taste of each strain is determined by its terpene profile. With over 100 different terpenes possible, there are seemingly endless different flavour combinations created and found in plants.\n\n\nSo, how can you ensure your edibles don\u2019t taste too much like weed? There are some tricks you can use.\n\n\n1. Use concentrates or oils. Though you certainly can use cannabis flowers to make your edibles, concentrates are a great alternative. They are potent, so you won\u2019t need to use as much concentrate as you would a bud. Because less is used, their flavour will likely be fainter and easier to mask, but this would not sacrifice the effects that you expect.\n\n\n2. Make strong cannabutter and canna-oil. The majority of edibles are made using cannabis butter and cannabis-infused oil. These are often made in advance so people can use them as they want. To help temper the taste of weed in your creation, make your cannabis butter and oil potent so you can use less in your recipes. Many people half the amount of cannabis butter a recipe calls for and sub in traditional butter to make up the difference, leaving you with a great product that doesn\u2019t taste too much like weed.\n\n\n3. Go for the chocolate. Cannabis chocolate is an excellent edible option for those with a sweet tooth. It is also a perfect option for homemade edibles. Because chocolate itself can be a bit bitter and complex, this is considered a benefit when fusing it with cannabis. This bitterness can often overpower the weed taste more easily than other edibles.  \n\n\n4. Branch out from sweets. Though edibles most often refer to sweets and candies, there are tons of recipes out there on cooking with cannabis. Mixing cannabis products with heartier dishes that may contain other herbs can help temper the taste of weed.\n\n\n5. Match your flavours. Whether you are planning to cook using cannabis oil or a cannabis flower, you can do a lot to improve the taste of your edibles by ensuring the flavours complement each other. For example, if you are making chocolate, don\u2019t choose a CBD oil that is cotton candy flavoured. A vanilla or chocolate flavoured oil would likely work better. By ensuring your flavours all work together, you can create a more flavourful and delicious product.\n\n\nDid you try this before? If you can add more detail.\n\n\nSource : [BMWO](https://buymyweedonline.com/edibles/how-to-hide-the-taste-of-weed-in-edibles/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "created_utc": 1619190942.0, "score": 10, "author": "LessieDerrico", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/mwxjdv/how_to_hide_the_taste_of_weed_in_edibles/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How to determine dosage of your homemade edibles BEFORE you eat them", "selftext": "This is posted in multiple subs, sorry to those that had to spend more eyeball time on this than necessary. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed several posts asking \u201cHow many of these brownies do I have to eat?\u201d or \u201cHow strong do you think these gummies are?\u201d For harm reduction purposes, this is how you figure it out. Be prepared, you\u2019re gonna have to do math.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how much cannabis you used to make your edibles. If you bought it from a dispensary or you\u2019ve paid to have yours tested, that\u2019s great you know exactly the THC %. If you don\u2019t know how much the THC % is in your cannabis, you can make some assumptions. An assumption is a guess, and your guess is as good as mine or anyone else\u2019s. Dank 20%, Mid\u2019s 15%, Schwag 10%\n\nWe need to determine the total THC content you are working with. To do that, we will convert your total weight of cannabis used to milligrams then multiply that by the THC percentage. Let\u2019s say you have 7 grams of cannabis that tested at 20% THC.\n\n7 grams = 7000mg\n\n7000mg (cannabis) x 20% (THC percentage)= 1400mg of THC\n\nSo, in a perfect world (perfect extraction, accurate testing, God blowing the wind in the right direction, etc\u2026) you would end up with 1400mg of THC. Now divide 1400mg by the number of pieces you ended up with and you have an approximate dosage. Let\u2019s say you made gummies and ended up with 40 pieces.\n\n1400mg / 40 pieces = 35mg each\n\nWhat about 60 pieces?\n\n1400mg / 60 pieces = 23.33mg each\n\nWhat about if you want to make particular dosages BEFORE you divide everything up? Let\u2019s take a look\u2026\n\nI want 10mg doses\n\n1400mg / 10mg = 140 pieces\n\nTo make 10mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 140 equal units\n\nI want 70mg doses\n\n1400mg / 70mg = 20 pieces\n\nTo make 70mg doses, you would need to divide your batch into 20 equal units\n\nHope this helps those that would have eaten too much otherwise. Sucks when that happens, but it happens. Most important is knowing that you\u2019re not gonna die. You just have to wait it out and hopefully know how much you took so you don\u2019t make that mistake again. However, once you know your upper dosage limit and you are willing to do the math, you\u2019ll never have to go through that again.\n\nCPT, Cannabis Pro Tips: \n\n1. Nothing good happens without a scale\n\n2. Assuming that testing results applies equally to every gram in the tested batch makes you a fool\n\n3. Home extractions will never be perfect. You\u2019ll never get 100% return unless you use the right tools in a perfect environment which most people (myself included) could never accomplish at home. Feel accomplishment with ever step forward knowing it\u2019ll never be perfect.\n\n4. Eating more edibles than your buddy DOES NOT make you a cooler person\n\n5. When you\u2019re friend doesn\u2019t want anymore, they don\u2019t want anymore. Quit asking.\n\n6. If in doubt, don\u2019t start with the whole thing or even 1/2, go with a 1/4.

Blisscuits, as I call them:\n\n[Picture Guide](http://imgur.com/RbuOdAQ)\n \nYou'll need:\n- 1 to 1.5g of cannabis bud per blisscuit\n- Peanut Butter (Smooth or crunchy but get the highest fat content you can find)\n- Nutella\n- Cookies / Sweet biscuits e.g. Arnott's Choc Ripple, YoYos, etc, 2 per blisscuit\n- Aluminium foil\n- An oven\n \n1. Preheat oven to 120*C (248*F)\n2. Make a small tray from aluminum foil\n3. Put your buds in the tray but DO NOT grind them as greater surface area increases the chance of burning\n4. Once the oven is preheated, bake the tray of buds for 15 minutes.\n5. While it's baking, spread the flat side of one bisscuit with peanut butter and then another with nutella, both about 0.5cm thick.\n6. Take the buds out of the oven and grind them up into a small bowl or something.\n7. Crank the oven up to 150*C (302*F)\n7. Use your hands to put even pinches of ground bud on to the peanut butter side of each biscuit, and press down gently so it gets stuck in.\n8. Sandwich each biscuit with its corresponding Nutella one, spread-to-spread, so the bud is in the middle.\n9. Wrap each sandwiched pair in aluminium foil and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.\n10. Remove from oven and either leave to cool or put them in your freezer for 10 minutes.\n11. Consume and enjoy!

{"title": "Just found you. Here's my improvement to candied bacon.", "selftext": "There was a huge party going down. We even had tincture that had been waiting in a closet for months. I wanted to make sure the food was also suitably epic:\n\nFirst, you candy the bacon in whatever manner you find appropriate. (I suggest thick-cut in oven at 325 for 20 total minutes.) You put it in the oven covered in brown sugar or syrup or honey or a mixture, whatever. You bake it, flip half-way through and recoat, bake some more and then you have candied bacon. Use whatever recipe you like, but with one exception - **Undercook the bacon** (*unless you like it really crispy.*) I think the best way to go about this might be to cook at higher heat for less time, but I'm not sure. I just got lucky. Anyways, set the bacon to the side.\n\nMake some batter. I mixed guinness and flour so that it was thick and gooey. Two ingredients. That was enough for me. There are better and more advanced batters, but whatever. (You see where this is going.) There are multiple techniques for applying the batter to the bacon, but before you do that - \n\nGet out some oil and pour it into a wide pot. ^(You probably should not do this recipe high, but tincture usually takes awhile to hit me and it was the morning and I had only just dosed.) Heat that baby up. ^(Oil burns, yay!) For my stove, the right setting is medium. You can tell by checking if a wooden spoon or bamboo skewer or whatever bubbles.\n\n**Do not touch anything that has gone into the oil with your hands.** (unless it has cooled)\n\n*Optional, but recommended:* Put some plain batter in the oil and pull it out when it's a little brown. Let it get cool. Try it. See if it's overdone, underdone, etc. Use that time as a metric for the cooking time of the bacon.\n\nAlright, now that your oil is ready, apply the batter to the bacon. I had a medium to large width bowl that was very flat and not very tall, so I dragged the strip through, then dragged the other side through the other direction, like sweeping with a broom, but bacon and batter. (Whatever.) Put that bacon in the oil.\n\nYou want to set out some paper plates with paper on top to absorb oil/grease.\n\nI don't know what to tell you about how you can tell whether or not a deep-fried thing is done other than google some before and after pictures or videos of battered shit getting deep fried. I don't know. But, when it's done, place the bacon on the paper plates (or grates or whatever you set up). Do not stack.\n\nNow, you're still not done. You have all this wonderful deep-fried candied bacon. Now, you make a candied bacon funnel cake. Shake powdered sugar over this mess. It will be glorious. Do it. *It's like I have taste flashbacks.*\n\nTry one and only one. Only one. It's good, right? Now, GET HIGH. Eat the rest like God intended.\n\nOne of my friends was at roughly an 8, stuffed this down, and I saw her eyes tear up and open wide in delight.\n\n**TL;DR: Candied-bacon funnel cake**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/1mdwu7/just_found_you_heres_my_improvement_to_candied/", "created_utc": 1379180779.0, "score": 10, "author": "unampho", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/1mdwu7/just_found_you_heres_my_improvement_to_candied/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "[RECIPE] Medicated Hard Candy & Everclear Tincture", "selftext": "I was looking for things to do with the trim from my harvest and after a lot of searching hard candy seemed like the perfect option. I made an [Everclear tincture](http://i.imgur.com/mlU9E.jpg) and then used that to make my [first batch of hard candy](http://i.imgur.com/k5nZH.jpg). Two pieces had me feeling pretty damn good for hours and then knocked me out. \n\n**Everclear Tincture**\n\nWARNING: You will be working with a VERY flammable substance. It is HIGHLY recommended that you use an electric stove. If a gas stove is your only option, proceed at your own risk. I would recommend extensive ventilation around your stove to prevent alcohol vapor buildup.\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 1/4 oz. trees (I used 5-6g of some old bud, .5g kief, and all my trim from two plants.)\n\n* 1/2 cup Everclear or equivalent 190 proof grain alcohol (Your trees should completely submerged. If they are not, use more until they are)\n\n* 2 pint mason jars with lids\n\n* Cheese cloth or 2 cloth reusable tea bags\n\n* Grinder\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* 1 qt. saucepan\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 325\u00b0F. (*See update at bottom of post*)\n\n2. While your oven is heating up, grind up all your trees and trim. It's important that the trim is properly dried.\n\n3. Put everything you ground up into one of the mason jars and place it on the middle rack in the oven for 5 minutes. This process is called decarboxylation and you can read up on why it's important. If you skip this step or heat it too high, it's worthless.\n\n4. Heat up 1 1/2 cups of water in your saucepan over medium-low heat. Put your candy thermometer in and get it as much into the water as you can without touching the bottom of the pan. This is BAD and will throw off your reading. Get the water to 190\u00b0F. You'll need to keep adjusting your burner to get it stable. Once it is steady at 190\u00b0F for 5 minutes without adjusting the heat, you are ready to proceed.\n\n5. Once your jar is cool to the touch, mix your everclear in. If your trees are not completely submerged, use enough to cover them. Place the jar in the pot for 30 minutes. The everclear will simmer but the water will not. Stir every few minutes with a fork so it doesn't burn.\n\n6. Strain the mixture through your cheesecloth or tea bag into your other jar. Squeeze as much as you can out of this. You can filter it once more if you still see floating bits. \n\n7. Store this in a cool, dark place until ready to use in your candy. Exposure to light can degrade the THC.\n\n---\n\n**Medicated Hard Candy (credit to /u/captaintrips420)**\n\nNeeded:\n\n* 3 qt. pot\n\n* Candy thermometer\n\n* Everclear tincture recipe from above (original recipe calls for 3g BHO)\n\n* Non-stick cooking spray\n\n* Newspaper or aluminum foil\n\n* Gloves\n\n* Plastic containers\n\n* Non-stick wooden or silicone spoon\n\n* [Candy molds](https://www.lorannoils.com/p-8611-sheet-mold-rectangle-breakup.aspx) (The recipe makes 2 to 2.5 sheets)\n\n* [Flavoring](https://www.lorannoils.com/c-6-super-strength-flavors.aspx) (BHO recipe calls for 1 dram, I would have used 1.5-2 for the Everclear tincture)\n\n* Food coloring\n\n* 1/4 cup powdered sugar\n\n* 2 cups sugar\n\n* 3/4 cup light corn syrup\n\n* 1/4 cup water\n\nPrep your work area. Lay down newspaper or aluminum foil on your counter to make clean-up a breeze.\n\n1. Mix your sugar (not powdered), corn syrup, and water in the pot and add your candy thermometer (do not let it touch the bottom of the pan) \n\n2. Heat using medium high heat. When it reaches 200\u00b0F, put in your BHO or tincture. (The original recipe didn't call for any stirring during the cooking process, but I would recommend stirring occasionally)\n\n3. When the candy reaches 320\u00b0F, turn off the burner and remove the pot from heat.\n\n4. Stir the mixture, add in 5-7 drops of your food coloring. Add 1-2 drams of your flavor oil and mix the shit out of the mixture (rather quickly, we don't want this to cool)\n\n5. Lightly spray your molds with non-stick cooking spray (have them done beforehand). Pour the mixture into the molds, spreading it out as best you can. Use a spoon to spread if needed. You don't want them so full that the divider between candies is covered. This will make them hard to break up later.\n\n6. Let cool for 15 minutes. Then put in the freezer for 5. \n\n7. Take the molds out of the freezer and, with gloves on, turn the molds upside and SLOWLY work the candy out of the molds. The molds can break if you are not gentle. Once the candy is out of the molds, break them apart. \n\n8. Put the candies in a plastic container with your powdered sugar. This will keep them from sticking together. Once they are evenly coated, place them into a clean plastic container to shake off the extra.\n\n9. Store these candies in a cool, dark place such as your fridge. Exposure to light can degrade the THC. 1-2 candies should give you a very nice body high depending on the potency of your tincture.

Be prepared Ents! Don't end up eating Cheetos or some other junk.\n\nWell, actually, I rather enjoy Cheetos - but they get old after awhile and make your hands orange.\n\nNOTE: CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE. If you\u2019re easily offended, get a life.\n\nEverything is better with trees. Ents revel in it. Music is moving. Movies; majestic. Inwards, outwards, things become enhanced.\n\nBut, unfortunately, Ents have a tendency to focus on sights and sounds, but leave out two other very important senses that are enhanced by Tress as well.\n\nNamely, smell and taste.\n\nTrees make food incredible.\n\nBut, tress can also make you lazy. And not prone to tackling large kitchen projects.\n\nNo worries there. After trying dozens and dozens of recipes, I have whittled them down to these easy to follow recipes that can be accomplished with little fuss while still tasting and smelling awesome.\n\nThey are:\n\n* Quick Fancy Grilled Cheese\n\n* Oven Baked Sweet Potato Fries\n\n* White Trash\n\n* Guacamole\n\n* Moist Banana Nut Bread\n\n* Sweet Chicken Bacon Wraps\n\n* Microwave Chocolate Peanut Butter Mouth Orgasms\n\n* Mini Pigs-In-A-Blanket\n\n* Pretzel Turtles\n\n* Peanut Butter Corn Flake Shake\n\n* Toasted Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich\n\n* Fruit Crisp \"Dump\"\n\n* Stovetop Popcorn\n\n* Homemade Cookies n\u2019 Creme Ice Cream Pie\n\n* A Fruit\u2019s Fool\n\n* Peanut Butter Cup Cookies\n\n* NOM NOM Grilled Cheese\n\n* Lemon Pudding Cake Bites\n\n* Bacardi Rum Cake\n\n* Pineapple Strawberry Sorbet\n\nYeah, yeah. It\u2019s only 20 recipes. That\u2019s a good thing. Most recipe books are full of fluff. You only end up using 10-20 recipes out of them anyway. I\u2019ve already gone and whittled it down for you. Plus, it\u2019s only $2.99 (or rather FREE at the moment). AND it\u2019s hilarious.\n\nSeriously, it\u2019s really funny.\n\nWell of course, I think it\u2019s funny because I wrote it.

{"title": "I decided to have a go at the Green Dragon, in the name of SCIENCE! These are my findings.", "selftext": "Upon learning about green dragon tincture a couple days ago, I realized I had all the necessary supplies:\n\n* Extra kiefy shake and frosty nuggies, 6 g total. 4.5 g. shake, 1.5 g nuggies.\n* Everclear in the freeze (leftover from party, I don't drink that shit) \n* Thermometers, jars, parchment paper, my own kitchen to stink up, ect.\n\n**The Science:**I heated the oven to 300, and left it in for 4 mins (until I started smelling it. It was still green, but crispy.) I slid it off the parchment paper into 3 oz of everclear (95%), stirred it, and added it to the water bath. I boiled it for 25 minutes. I found that 165 degrees was the best temperature for the alcohol, and tried to keep it there where I had bubbles but it wasn't violent. After straining and french pressing it, my result was almost exactly 1.5 oz. The resulting liquid was dark green, and smelt like weed/grass. I covered it and allowed it to cool slowly before placing it into the fridge.\n\n**Results:** Without being previously high but having a high tolerance, I tried 5 ml (one common eyedropper, as recommended in the Wu article) at 10 o'clock and after 45 mins felt nothing. I added 2.5 ml at 11 pm. Again nothing. At 11:30pm I took another 5 ml, nothing. And at 12 I still felt nothing so I drank another 7.5 ml. (total 20 ml) At 12:30 I got frustrated and wanted to know if this was going to work or not, so I drank the whole lot of it (~25 ml) so total of about 45 ml in 2.5 hours. Nothing.\nI should note that I tried it straight, mixed with OJ (not bad), Lipton Bottled Green Tea (not bad), water (just dec. alcohol flavour, but more to drink), and gatorade (really bad). I also was on an empty stomach.\n\n**Analysis (TL;DR):** Well I didn't feel anything. I did get hungry, but I hadn't eaten before the experiment either. It had a powdery taste to it, as well as the dark green color (chlorophyll) I'm sure stains your teeth-tongue. It's scent is pungent, and too pleasant-thought NOT terrible. Smells like grass/weed.\nI know people swear they have had success, and I have friends that have. If I were to guess where I went wrong, I'd say I didn't bake it long enough. Some people say when they pull it out of the oven, it's turned to bronze. If I knew this worked, I'd probably just make it with kief. \n\n**My Errors:**So any seasoned green dragon riders know where I went wrong? I'll probably try one more time at least with everything the same, but increasing the oven time until the bronze stage is reached (figured that'd be too far, I guess not. I know the heat should help release the chlorophyll which has a huge effect on taste.) So.... Science?\n\n**EDIT:** Formatting, sorry about that. Thanks for the responses and suggestions, I posted this on r/trees but didn't get much back. I'm definitely still interested in Green Dragon and it's potential applications if I can get a solid recipe. I did all of this based on the fact most people said it worked and a lot still said it didn't (had to know what's up behind the mystery.) Sounds like it's worked for some of you all, so I'll be trying/refining other methods and posting my results in the future, for science!\n\n**EDIT 2:** Found my [source](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLsyYxGBFgw) and [source 2](http://boards.cannabis.com/concentrates/82380-definitive-green-dragon-revised-updated-combined.html) for the original Master Wu's recipe.

Place the dish in a food dehydrator (if you don't have one use a gentle heat source, like a heating pad, and a fan) When all the liquid is gone you should have a thin layer of the darkest, stickiest, concentrate you've ever seen.  Scrape this up with a razor blade and put it in a small glass jar.  If you can't get it all out of the corners use an ounce of grain alcohol to re-hydrate the rest.  Add this ounce of alcohol to the small glass jar with your sticky concentrate, seal tightly and shake frequently to dissolve.  If after a day there is still concentrate at the bottom of your jar you have saturated your alcohol, add a bit more and continue to shake occasionally, repeat this until everything is liquid.\n\nYou now have a high potency tincture.  I tried ten drops in my coffee (with cream) this morning and it gave me a pleasant high.  \n\nNOTE:  I scrape and then re-hydrate rather than re-hydrate in the baking dish because re-hydrating in the dish exposes a large surface area of your alcohol to the air and 190 proof grain alcohol evaporates quickly.  If you can perfect a tightly covered baking dish that should work too.\n\nHappy cooking!\n\nEDIT:  I almost forgot, you can soak your herb again to get a second batch but it'll be milder.  Also, once you have the sticky concentrate you can use butter or food grade glycerin or even bacon fat instead of alcohol.  This lets you make a huge variety of edibles from your trees.

I'm not trying to get karma I'm just trying to spread this because it works and its hard to find any info on it anywhere else.\n\n\nI mixed one tablespoon of ABV and 2 shots of grain alcohol(153 proof). I put both the ABV and liquor in a container and sealed the lid. I shook the mixture together for about 10 minutes, strained it through cheese cloth and mixed it with some soda and ice. If I were to do it again I would recommend fruit juice to mask the harshness of the alcohol. It tasted like high proof alcohol and baked weed, so, it wasn't great tasting and it looked like pond scum water. \n\nI drank the dank drank at around 9:45pm. At about 10:30pm I started to feel high. By 11:00pm I was at [6] and climbing. By 11:45pm I was a [9] and I decided to hit the ol' MFLB to get me to a [10]. I watched Osmosis Jones and by 12:35am I was still very high, probably around a [8]. I went to bed around then and woke up at 8:10am and was still high at about a [2].\nI would definitely recommend trying this if you have some abv laying around. The alcohol buzz transitions very nicely to your high, and the high was a very happy one. I had a smile on face until I went to bed and I laughed like crazy at the movie. I smoke(vape) everyday so my tolerance is pretty high. If I were to smoke the same amount(tbsp) of abv I would be high for a little more than an hour.

{"title": "Looking for assistance with advanced THC extraction techniques", "selftext": "I have been using the green dragon everclear extraction with seemingly good results, but because of the flammibility of the entire setup and setting my kitchen on fire last night I would really like to move away from this process. I use the tincture extraction and then use the tinc for cooking, mainly lollipops, thus I do not want to use a butter/oil extraction as I dont like the taste of the butter/oil based lollipops. I have been reading about using glycerin for the extraction and would really like to start using that. What looks to be the best method for a glycerin extraction involves sealing the glycerin and chopped buds in a pharmaceutical grade beaker, and then cooking it for 36 hours at 311 degrees F. So i guess I just really want to know how I would go about doing this method safely, as this method sounds to be a little dangerous as well, any real chemists out there have some opinions as to the usefulness of this extraction, or any opinions would be greatly appreciated, relevant recipe included below.\n\n\n~~~Autoclave\n\nIf you have an autoclave, or a pharmaceutical grade glass beaker with threadlock top, than this next method is for you!\n\nTake 1oz of primo bud, not crushed but de-stemmed and totally and completely dried out. Toss them into a screw seal boiling beaker. Then, you must absolutely ABSOLUTELY use thread lock on the beaker. If you don\u2019t do this, its totally pointless to even try this method. \n\nPut the bud in the beaker with 1 cup glycerine; boil in your oven or on an autoclave at 155C or 311F; leave for 36 hours. It should be boiling for most of this time, but air should not be escaping the beaker. Remove and let cool. Upon cooling it should have separated into a green oily substance (which you want to keep) and a black thick tar, which in this case tested at 12% THC. The green oily substance in this case tested at 88% THC. \n\nThe bud should have completely and totally dissolved into the glycerine. That black tar stuff is all the plant material. It can be tossed if you like\u2026 or you could try drying it and smoking it, its up to you. (Thanks to Quanium for testing this for us!)\n\nOnce you have your drops, you can soak some of your normal bud in it to give it an extra little kick. Or you can put a few drops in a joint, or just on the top of a bowl in a bong. But by far the single best way to do this is to put just a few drops under your tongue and hold it there for about 2-3 minutes. Will make you go absolutely mad.

However it doesnt seem to be the most popular idea on the web, with most recipes failing to mention this method at all.  \n\nAnyways I hear that I should presoak the weed in warm water (cold water causes the trichomes to become brittle and fall off) for a period of 20 minutes to a few hours, until the water becomes green.  Then gently strain the water away and cook with the bud.  In doing this method I will impart less mj flavor into the food while retaining its potency since thc is not water soluble, at least that is what I heard.

{"title": "Bake yourself a present before you bake yourself. ", "selftext": "This is my apple cinnamon caramel roll recipe. I've got it started and I'm hoping to time it so that they will be hot out of the oven when my dude gets home. It's a bit of an involved process, you should probably do this before you smoke. If you do, your stoned self will get a super awesome crush on your not-stoned self.\n\nFirst, I start with this [dough recipe](http://baking.about.com/od/sweetrolls/r/brdmachcinnroll.htm). If you don't have a bread machine you can find recipes for regular cinnamon roll dough or you can buy frozen dough. \n\nWhile your dough is rising, peel and shred 2 apples into a bowl and put aside.\n\nFor the cinnamon sugar I do 1/2 cup sugar and about 1 tablespoon spices, it seems to be a pretty good ratio. You can do a full tablespoon of cinnamon or you can cut back on the cinnamon and mix in ground ginger, cardamom (my favorite), nutmeg or allspice. \n\nThe caramel part is optional. In a small fry pan (or sauce pan, you are the boss of your pans) toast a goodly handful of pecans (half cuppish), then add 1/2 stick butter and let that melt. To that add 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tbl water and 1 tsp cinnamon. Stir and cook until gets gooey bubbly. Pour this mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 pan. \n\nIf you do not make the caramel, then just generously butter a 9x13 pan and go forward.\n\nOnce your dough is ready, roll it out. The recipe I linked to recommends rolling it to a 10x15 rectangle. Personally, I prefer to roll it bigger and thinner which gives me more layers in my rolls and more layers means MORE DELICIOUSNESS! Melt a half stick of butter, then drizzle and brush it evenly over the dough leaving about an inch or so space around the edges.\n\nSprinkle your sugar mixture over the butter. Then grab up the shredded apple and SQUEEEEEEZE the excess moisture out and sprinkle the apple shreds over the dough.\n\nRoll that all up into a log and use some unwaxed dental floss to cut that log into rolls and put the rolls in the pan. Cover that up and let it rise about an hour.  Then bake at 375 for 25-30 minutes.\n\nIf you made the caramel sauce it's pretty important to pop these babies out of the pan before the sauce cools and hardens. Just put a cutting board over the pan and flip that right over. \n\nI'm off to roll them out.

Perhaps there should be a common pizza recipe thread for easy reference?\n I've been making the dough from scratch about two years, here's my unrequited advice.\nsome people say to mix yeast in with the flour, I've had the best results fermenting(proofing) the yeast in 60-70 degree water with dissolved molasses. Honey and brown sugar are good feedstock also.  I set the yeast to grow while i measure and mix the dry ingredients.  the basic water/flour ratio is 1:3, with wiggle room depending on the type of flour.  More coarse flour requires more water.  The best benefit to making your own dough is that you can spice it to suit the other ingredients.  I generally use cumin, turmeric, paprika, black pepper, chili flakes, and garlic powder.  Powdered garlic has a simpler flavor, but it's easier to disperse into the dough.  Let the dough rise about 6 hours, or a few days if you want beer bread.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dxfp9/pizza_recipes_thread/", "created_utc": 1288221910.0, "score": 6, "author": "None", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dxfp9/pizza_recipes_thread/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Perhaps the unhealthiest part is the crust, which is full of simple carbohydrates. This is the pizza I did yesterday. I do a ton of pizzas, they're cheap, nutritious, tasty, easy and fun to make, and easy to warm after a long day of work.\n\n    * 350g of normal flour\n    * 350g of rye flour\n    * 2 baggies of dry east (they're sold in 11g baggies over here)\n    * 2 teaspoons of salt\n    * 4 tablespoons of olive oil\n    * ~ 4-4,5dl of warm water (a bit warmer than your body's temperature so that the yeast will activate)\n\nMix the dry ingredients together. Mix the olive oil and water in another bowl. Pour the liquids over the dry's slowly and in small portions and do some kung fu. Pound the dough man. You don't necessarily need the whole amount of water, use it as much as needed to get a nice firm ball of dough. Then cover your bowl with a damp cloth and put it in some place warm. Let it rise for a hour or so, it should double its size.\n\nNow put your oven on. I like to warm it to 250C. Put the baking tray inside so that it will have time to warm up. This is necessary for a thin, crunchy crust.\n\nThen prepare your toppings. I use grounded meat + textured vegetable protein (that stuff which looks like ground meat when prepared) because it's cheap and pretty tasty. Tuna is good, as are pineapples and olives. Go apeshit!\n\nI like to buy some cheap marinara sauce from the market, they're only like 0,6e for a 400g pack. I usually mix some really spicy chopped dried chilies and some garlic in it for shits and giggles.\n\nAt the time when you have prepared the toppings and sauces the dough should be ready. I can do four really really thin pizzas from this amount. This way I can get the minimal amount of carbs in comparison to the amount of tastiness. After you have done the bases for your pizzas, put a ton of marinara sauce, a ton of toppings and a ton of cheese. Throw them to the oven. Bake for ten minutes or so.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nThe ingredients are really cheap.

{"title": "Bac-n-cheese. Aw yeeeeeeee", "selftext": "I like this with macaroni and other bite-size pasta, but you could do it with any pasta you like; noodles, cut-up sheet pasta like lasagna, whatever. Pasta is pasta.\n\nFirst, the roux.\nA roux is basically equal parts fat (butter, oil, whatever) and flour, melted together in a pot and used to thicken sauces or soups or whatever.\n \n* Cut up some butter into little bitty dice, about two or three tablespoons per person, and melt it down on the stove like the fucking Terminator. Whatever that amount is, remember the number.\n \n* Whisk in the same amount of flour, a little bit at a time so it doesn't lump together. Good cheese-sauce is *smooth.*\n \n* Keep the roux warm, add the same amount of milk straight from the fridge - you want your roux hot and your milk cold, so they even out in the middle and make a nice warm sauce that gets that sort of shimmery-fatty shine on it. If you want thinner sauce, less shine - add more milk.\n \n* Keep whisking like hell, until it goes from yellowish thick stuff to pale-shiny-yellow-swirly-white thinner stuff that smells a lot better.\n \n* Season it if you want, salt, pepper, diced onion bits, cloves, bay leaf, whatever.\n \n* Turn the heat down on that shit, simmer it for about twenty minutes more so it doesn't taste floury all over your pasta.\n\nWait a second, the pasta!\n \n* Get a niiice big stockpot. Flatten out your hand on the inside wall of it, all your fingers straight vertical and touching the bottom. See where your wrist starts? Fill it with that much water **at least.**\n \n* Boil that shit until its bubbles look mad enough to leap out of that pan and fuck your mother. Add the pasta. Stir it all around if it gets frothy - that's the starch in the pasta reacting to being soaked in hot water, it'll make your pot boil over, *stir it* like hell so it doesn't. You don't always need to \"add a fat (oil, butter, etc.) to your water so the pasta doesn't stick together\" like Mom says, but it does help.\n \n* Add your pasta. Pick out a piece after three minutes, and bite through it. Do that every half a minute, until you're happy with how it feels. \"Al dente\" is about halfway done. For pasta with fillings, cook it all the way, you don't want raw meat and shit like that with your fucking awesome cheese sauce.\n \nWait a second, the cheese!\n \n* American and Cheddar. That just goes without saying. Add Gruyere or Gouda if you're rich and picky, mozzarella doesn't melt very well - better shredded on top, if you like - and stay away from bleu unless you actually like that on pasta. Weirdo.\n \n* Shred it, dice it, chop it up all to hell, doesn't matter, *more surface area is better.* Melts faster, easier, more evenly. It's the difference between a single huge block of ice in your cup of Coke, or a bunch of little cubes. Which one feels colder? The cubes one. Same principle.\n \n* Once your milk-and-roux sauce is done, is off the stove, *then* add the cheese. If it's not melting just from the heat of the sauce, put it back on the stove to simmer but watch it like a preteen pyromaniac. Bubbling is okay, a little. Smoking or burning is NOT. There will be CONSEQUENCES, young man. That's IT, you're grounded for a week, and NO BACON.\n\nWait a second, the bacon!\n \nYES. This is what will take your ordinary snoozefest shit-ass-boring mac-n-cheese and make it FUCKING AMBROSIA FROM HEAVEN, MY SON. Read carefully:\n \n* What's better than eating bacon while baked?\n \n* BAKING BACON WHILE BAKED.\n \n* Preheat your *so fucking lucky OMG you guys guess what my user put in me the other day* oven to 400 Fahrenheit, 200 Celsius, or gas mark 6.\n \n* Using any baking sheet or pan with an edge (even a cake pan, you can be resourceful! ^^) lay bacon out to cover the entire pan right up to the edges.\n \n* BAKE IT for 15-20 minutes, until it is FUCKING AWESOME.\n \n* Drain with paper towels on a separate plate.\n \n* Chop that shit the fuck up, and toss it into your newly-melted-cheese sauce.\n \n* Pour your steaming-hot saucepan of cheese-and-bacon-flavored love *all* over those innocent little pasta, the poor things.\n \n* WIN.

This gives you optimal surface area!\n\nGenerally most vaped remains are almost entirely decarbolaxed (sp?) so you don't have to take into account some of the recipes that tell you to heat up your edibles.\n\nThe easiest way to get high off of edibles made from vaped remains is to grind them into a powder, mix with peanut butter, microwave until its soupy, stir, then let it cool down.\n\nYou can make cookies, sandwhiches, etc. with it.  There's no real recipe, add as much vaped remains as you have and can stand (they taste like shit, fyi) and then that's how much you need :-)\n\nThe second easiest method is cannabutter.  mix 2 cups of butter, with 1 cup of water and at least 10 grams of vaped remains.

{"title": "The Official How To Make 'Cannabutter' Guide", "selftext": "**Things you will need:**\r\n\r\n- Butter (or ghee - the less water content, the better)\r\n- Cannabis (trim, bud or shake). Use DRY!\r\n- Water\r\n- A crockpot/stovepot\r\n- A strainer (grape press, french press, cheesecloth or pantyhose)\r\n\r\n**Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. **Combine Water w/ Butter over Heat.** Stir constantly and bring to a simmer (not boiling).\r\n\r\n2. **Add Your Cannabis.** You will need more trim than shake and more shake than bud. \r\n\r\n3. **Bring to a Simmer.** Keep heating the mixture and stir for anywhere between 1 to 8 hours - depending on the amount and potency of your cannabis (vs. butter). Stir at least every 30m - 1hr.\r\n\r\n3. **Strain Mixture.** Do this while still hot/warm. The more viscous the mixture remains, the more butter will come through in the straining process. If you are using cheesecloth - use multiple layers & secure over pot.\r\n\r\n4. **Squeeze!** Get every last bit of the butter out.\r\n\r\n5. **Refrigerate Overnight.** You should end up with a clean mixture of cannabis butter and water. \r\n\r\n6. **Separate.** The butter/fat will solidify on top. Slice around the side of the butter layer and push through & pull out your slice of cannabis butter :)\r\n\r\n**F.A.Q.**\r\n\r\n- **How much cannabis should I use?** There is no 'de-facto' butter:cannabis ratio. Do it by eye and improve over time. Some people say an 'oz of bud per cup of butter' - but each batch has a different potency and there will always be water loss if you're using butter.\r\n\r\n- **How hot should the pot be?** Cannabis boils off at around 365F (like in a vaporizer). The boiling point of water is 212F. You pot should never go over a rolling boil. Since the cannabis you're using is already dry, it will quickly dissolve into the fat at a simmering temperature.\r\n\r\n- **What should I do with the excess water/cannabis?** DUMP the water!! It's gross!! You will see all of the dirt and sediment at the bottom that comes from the cannabis.  As for the cannabis, if your butter is *super* green - and you think more potency might be left - boil it through another cup of butter to be sure.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use fresh trim?** Yes - but I don't recommend it. I've used buds straight from the plant and the trichomes will take MUCH longer to melt. The end product also tastes a little iffy.\r\n\r\n- **How do I know when it's done cooking?** Look for the trichomes. You should see them shrink as the cooking process goes on.  If you have no trichomes for reference - cook it until the plant matter is soggy and your pot is easier to stir. It should lose its green color eventually as well.\r\n\r\n- **Can I use stems??** Stems have very little THC content... and they will break your strainer. Best to keep stems out of the pot - unless they've been blended down.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/treecipes/comments/dmq0a/the_official_how_to_make_cannabutter_guide/", "created_utc": 1286217025.0, "score": 18, "author": "growthh", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/treecipes/comments/dmq0a/the_official_how_to_make_cannabutter_guide/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Horseshoe burgers, these things will hit the spot...", "selftext": "It seems these burgers are popular in the North, I learned how to make them in Illinois. Ingredients:\n\n1 lbs. of ground beef i prefer 90/10 but whatever you can get\nclove of finely minced garlic\n1/4 cup worchestershire sauce\nsalt and pepper\n1 medium sized pkge. thin sliced french fries\n1/2 stick butter\n1/4 cup flour\n1 to 2 cups milk\na package of sharp cheddar cheese\nassorted toppings such as bacon, grilled onion, mushrooms\n\nin a medium sized bowl mix ground beef, sauce, seasonings, and garlic together and mix by hand and form 4 patties. While these guys are sitting soaking up flavor you can start making the cheese sauce. In a medium sized sauce pan melt a half stick of butter over low heat, whisk in flour and continue whisking until it forms a paste-like consistency that is called a reux. slowly whisk in part of the milk and keep the heat on low reducing the mixture until it coats the back of a spoon. While this is going on you can heat up your fryer and your grill at which point you can start grilling your patties, just drop them in and let them go, excessive flipping and squishing with the spatula leads to moisture loss, cook them to desired level of doneness and then reserve, coving with aluminum foil. Fries are to be cooked normally and laid out on old newspaper or paper towel to soak up excess oil. They can be seasoned however you like them I prefer sea salt. Now you can finish the cheese sauce by adding in cheese bit by bit and whisking until the cheese is incorporated taste test and whenever it reaches your preferred level of cheesyness, add salt and pepper to taste and then have all the rest of you stoner friends too lazy to help come and start assembling the burgers. Start by laying down a hamburger bun/slice of bread then butting down your condiment of choice such as mustard, mayo, pesto, bbq sauce what have you, put your patty down on top of that then top with whatever your heart desires. I like this recipe because it helps to clear your fridge of leftovers. Top with a healthy handful or two of fries and then a large ladle of the cheese sauce. grab a bib and a fork and dig in!\n\nP.S.
