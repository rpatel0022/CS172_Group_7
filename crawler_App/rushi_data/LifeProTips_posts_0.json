I laugh with my kid, not at him. We do it when we're on our own or in safe groups. If he tells me something funny he did, I laugh with him and I'll tell him stupid things I do so we can laugh together.\n\nI don't humiliate him with personal and embarrassing stories around Christmas dinner or whatever.

The problem is that once you start engaging with \"rage bait\" content (politics, culture war, news, etc) the social media algorithms, which aren't that bright yet, assume this is ALL you want to see.\n\nYou feeds begin filling up with content that contributes to a few things.  First your anger obviously.  But secondly you begin to get a sense that the issues/viewpoints you are seeing are MUCH more prevalent and you are more \"correct\" than they/you actually are.  You start to fall into the trap of \"echo chambers\", where you become insulated from opposing views, which makes you less informed and less able to intelligently develop your opinions.\n\nFor example:  If you engage with content showing that your political side is correct to the point of all other points being wrong (or worse, evil), that is what the algorithms will drop into your home screens and suggestions.  This causes the following\n\n* You begin to believe your opinions represent the majority\n* You begin to see those who disagree with you as, at best stupid and uniformed, at worst inhuman monsters\n* You begin to lose empathy for anyone who holds an opposing  view\n* You miss out on the opposing side, which may provide valuable context and information to truly understanding the issue (you get dumber)\n\nMake a conscious decision to engage with the internet positively.  Your feeds will begin believing this is what you want.  You will be happier, your feeds will be uplifting instead of angering, and you will incentivize the algorithms to make you happy instead of rage farming you.

Lucky, us Aussies have been surviving through all that and much worse for at least a couple centuries, and I'm here to give you guys the inside info on how to survive. \n\n\n\n1 - If you live on an upslope, ridge, or narrow forested road, get the fuck out early - no help will come. \n\n\nPeople here who stayed then changed their minds later, and couldn't escape because trees fell within minutes and blocked exit routes.\n\n\nFirefighters were either unable to get in, or were forbidden due to extreme risk of being cut off themselves - 1200 litres of water in a Cat7 is like pissing into a hurricane, especially if you're up on a ridge.\n\n\n\n\n2 - if actually caught and unable to escape. dig in and cover with  DRY WOOLEN BLANKETS!\n\nPlease fill your bathtub before it hits - water tanks will melt real fast and you'll have no water - the thing that MIGHT make the difference between life and death could be as simple as layers of wool blankets,  a low sheltered concrete corner, some sheets of tin, some DRY wool blankets, and one moist towel to protect from radiant heat.\n\nWet clothing or sheets are inferior to a wool blanket and you will boil alive. Do not cover any yourself in anything wet!\n\n\n\n\n3 - If defending your house - wool or cotton long sleeves and leather boots, and wear LEATHER GLOVES if possible. You can throw burning stuff back but without gloves, no way.\n\n\n\n\n4 - Remember that the only safe area to run to is often INTO an area already burnt - you can also survive by having a shallow grave and laying in that under dry blankets, a layer of wet stuff and tin, and breathe through a wet cloth to avoid suffocation. You'll collapse real fucking fast without oxygen and remember also, many houses are made with plastics and toxic gas-causing materials so.... yeah.... stay safe out there and honestly, if you live on a ridge or uphill slope... run now.  Your life is worth more than stuff.\n\n\n\n5 - If you think you can defend, don't forget to protect your water tank and exposed poly lines - if that goes, you're fucked. \n\n\nPeople on gravity feed systems, this is your weak point. We were lucky enough to have a small Honda pump and Cat7, but our tank was on fire several times - if that had gone, we'd be gone.  Remember this, especially if on a bush block with some tank uphill off in the scrub. If you're not gonna be able to save that tank, forget about it.  You're going to lose your house, get out now.\n\n\n\n\n6 - Remember, fire can move up to 400km (250miles) per hour uphill. If you change your mind and live on a ridge, you are quite likely fucked.  Don't die for stuff.  Escape, and we can hunt down the corrupt fucks who made this happen later. Channel that anger to the ones who sold us out and gave away our water and our future to line their own pockets.\n\nStay safe America!\n\n: EDIT :\n\n\nI had no idea this'd blow up so much, and it's great to see so many people invested in keeping fire safe, you're all fuckin legends \ud83d\udcaa and thanks to everyone who's put forward awards. I'm not sure what they do, but I appreciate y'all care so much.\n\n: POINTS WORTH CLARIFYING :\n\nA Cat7 is a type of firefighting engine available in Australia. Not sure what your American equivalent would be.\n\nNEVER use water to cover your blankets or yourself, EVER. Use it as an external barrier to embers on the outermost towels.\n\nActually I'm a chick \u270c\ufe0f\n\nLarge bodies of water are good to venture out into if necessary, but keep in mind you need a decent level of physical fitness to maintain treading water whilst also inhaling smoke at the same time.\n\nNEVER use synthetics or anything with a synthetic blend. Wool is best on a budget, duvetyne is probably the best material available, 100% cotton towels will also work in a pinch. Never synthetic .\n\n: EDIT 2 :\n\nWow this really blew up. I'm fucking honoured, and I'm glad to see so many people out there really giving a shit about fire safety. \n\nAll your suggestions, feedback, and positive discussion really reignite (haha) my faith in humanity.

My grandmother went and saw that our laundry baskets were full so she just grabbed that as she wanted to get us out of there ASAP. Her logic, all the dirty clothes are things we chose to wore, and cleaning them would take a few hours, but in this moment it takes a minute to just grab them. If we were to try and pack our clothes, it would just extend the amount of time we would be in that toxic situation of crying, yelling, and screaming. Luckily my brother was a stickler for laundry and had gotten each of us our own basket. Older siblings, and grandparents are the best.\n\nI've remembered that ever since, and every time I've needed to leave in an immediate hurry and didn't have time to pack for whatever reason but would have time to clean the clothes later, laundry basket. I've told this story for 18 years to people, and I can count on both hands off the top of my head the amount of times someone told me this actually came in handy. I've been told of abusive relationships, emergency evacuation situations, and several other random situations that required the gathering of clothes immediately.\n\nI happened to remember this due to having a dream about that incident, and don't recall anyone sharing this tip.

{"title": "LPT: Some tips for buying a used car for people that know nothing about cars", "selftext": "EDIT - 2-24-2025 - Hey all, after getting so much continued feedback from this post, I've decided to make an app to help people when purchasing vehicles. I know some of the things on here, especially the OBD2 data, may be a bit daunting, so I'm hoping to put something together that gives you tips, tricks, and helps pull the OBD2 data in an easy to interpret way. If it takes off, it could even turn into something that can help budding driveway mechanics fix their vehicles.\n\nIf you're interested, head over to https://carprocheck.com/waiting-list and let me know!\n\n\nI\u2019m a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I\u2019d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn\u2019t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don\u2019t know how many people I\u2019ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it\u2026.ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that\u2019s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:\n\n1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot, as they\u2019ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don\u2019t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.\n\nSo when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there\u2019s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it\u2019s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they\u2019re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn\u2019t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!\n\nUse the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven\u2019t passed, then it\u2019s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there\u2019s a problem that isn\u2019t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign.  Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.\n\n2. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what\u2019s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don\u2019t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You\u2019ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it\u2019s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s what a normal cranking sound should be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h\\_Ygqox0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0)\n\nHere\u2019s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It\u2019s at about :55 secs :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng)\n\nIf you listen closely, you\u2019ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.\n\nIf the car you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don\u2019t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you\u2019re looking at with something like \u201cYYYY Make Model clear flood\u201d or  \u201cYYYY Make Model disable fuel pump\u201d and see if there\u2019s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.\n\nPractice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.\n\n3. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don\u2019t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you\u2019re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it\u2019s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it\u2019s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford\u2019s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That\u2019s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven\u2019t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That\u2019s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that\u2019s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That\u2019s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don\u2019t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you\u2019re SOL there.\n\n4. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it\u2019s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.\n\n5. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they\u2019ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It\u2019s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that\u2019s better. Indy\u2019s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that\u2019s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that\u2019s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don\u2019t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn\u2019t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.\n\n6. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?\n\n7. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can\u2019t see?\n\n8. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.\n\n9. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they\u2019re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.\n\n10. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn\u2019t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They\u2019ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They\u2019ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you\u2019re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.\n\n11. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you\u2019re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it\u2019s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you\u2019re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it\u2019s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.\n\n12. This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It\u2019s also pretty important. You\u2019ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it\u2019s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that\u2019s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it\u2019s adding, but sometimes it\u2019s subtracting). I don\u2019t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.\n\nSo what you\u2019re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it\u2019s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You\u2019re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find \u201cshort term fuel trim\u201d and \u201clong term fuel trim\u201d. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.\n\nShort term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%\n\nLong term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%\n\nLet\u2019s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You\u2019re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the \u201cbank\u201d or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one \u201cside\u201d so you\u2019ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you\u2019ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you\u2019re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn\u2019t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.\n\nWhen looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you\u2019ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let\u2019s take a look at some examples on a V8:\n\nSTFT1 : 3 ...  STFT2 : 6\n\nLTFT1 : 2 ...  LTFT2  : 1\n\nSo the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That\u2019s pretty good.\n\nSTFT1 : -5 ...  STFT2  : 3\n\nLTFT1 : 3 ...   LTFT2  : 1\n\nBank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that\u2019s good.\n\nSTFT1 :  6 ...  STFT2 :  7\n\nLTFT1  : 10  ... LTFT2  :15\n\nBank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That\u2019s not good. Walk away from this one.\n\nHere's one more that's a littlte different:\n\nSTFT1  : -20 ...  STFT2  : -20\n\nLTFT1  :  22 ...  LTFT2  : 20\n\nHey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking  a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.\n\nCheck these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.\n\nPractice this on a car you have access to beforehand.\n\n13. Last and not least, don\u2019t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don\u2019t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you\u2019re worried about is no big deal, it\u2019s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it\u2019s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn\u2019t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don\u2019t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.\n\nI would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents\u2019 cars, friends\u2019 cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you\u2019re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won\u2019t forget anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/fcc67tp/?context=3) talking about it, and a few other good things as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something  soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2 - Fixed some formatting\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT3 - Thanks for all the replies and awards. I'm glad people found this useful. But seriously, no more awards. Save your money for gas to return all those Christmas presents you don't want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT4 - There are lots of comments and questions. I'll try to answer what I can but there are so many. I'll get back to most of you eventually. Gotta get some work done....working on a Saturday (sucks)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT5 - I'm back from the dead!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT6 - added some good info brought up in comments, expanded on a few things, laymanized it a little more, explained some technical stuff. Still can't get the STFT and LTFT examples to format the way I wanted. Best I can do\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 8 - Good night everyone. Thanks for all the awards and comments and conversations. I replied to all the PMs and chats. Tried to reply to as many comments as I could, but holy cow there were just too many.

{"title": "LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.", "selftext": "The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.\n\nIf, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.\n\n**To high school juniors and seniors:** \n\nYour parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.\n\n**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**\n\nThese jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. \n\n**Is there any money in it?**\n\nThere definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. \n\nThat's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.\n\n**What are my options?**\n\nThere are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.\n\n**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. \n\nA recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)\n\nThe federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.\n\n**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. \n\nTraining doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, \"boot camp\" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.\n\n**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. \n\nRegarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.\n\nRegarding training, if you win the \"job lottery\" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.\n\nRegarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.\n\nI know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIf you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.\n\n\n\n\n**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an \"open\" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. \"No thanks\" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist \"open general\", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. \n\nAlso about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying \"DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!\" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.\n\nRegarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.\n\nStill relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but \"Go to college if you want a good life!\" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT.

Between the flight time, airport wait time, and time to get to the airport, it could easily be eight hours since they last had a proper meal, even with a direct flight.\n\nTo those that are hostile towards the idea that you might consider doing an additional nice thing for someone on top of an initial nice thing: You don't have to do it, and the person isn't obligated to eat it.

Falsifying a police statement is illegal, and they will not only be caught red handed scamming someone, but their charges will be more severe for falsifying a statement. Plus if they are in a vehicle when they tried to scam you, their insurance premiums will probably go through the roof. Remember, if they tried to scam you, they have tried to scam someone else, and are likely going to continue trying to scam others in the future.

If an accident occurs, your pull the memory card and plug into your computer to save the video you want. The dashcam plugs into your vehicles cigarette lighter.

Hopefully this helps to address some of the questions I have seen.\n\nUpdate #2: someone says  dash cams that record multiple angles at once do exist. I didn\u2019t know this, but great info!

{"title": "LPT: Overwatering kills more houseplants than underwatering, and its symptoms are very similar. When in doubt, don't water. Other beginner tips in the post.", "selftext": "Many people enthusiastically bring home a pretty houseplant for the first time, and proceed to water it every day to keep it happy. While understandable, you're setting yourself for heartbreak and frustration.  It is natural to assume that the one thing we know we have to do to plants should be done often, and the more often the better, but root rot is usually not fixable and will slowly kill your lovely plant. Underwatering, on the other hand, can be fixed very easily. As a rule of a thumb, once a week is perfect for most plants. \n\n\nMissing the outdoors and ending up with about 60 houseplants through a year of lockdown, I have learned that majority of them prefer to be left to their own devices. Here is a rather conclusive guide working for vast majority of widely available plants:\n\n\n\n\n- give them a sunny spot. Seems obvious, but we might be tempted to place them for aesthetics out of sun. There are plants that don't mind (ferns are the best example), but most do. Give them sun or grow light. Remember that more sun makes them dry up more often (so on a sunny window sill, water once every 5 days, in a shadowy corner, once every week)\n\n\n\n- once every 2 weeks, take a soft cloth, slightly wet, and clean the leaves. Dust sets on them as well, and it makes it harder for them to undertake photosynthesis properly. It is also a rather soothing activity. Everyone wins. \n\n\n\n\n- get a plant food. They are usually cheap and you can also make your own, and they can make your plant grow like crazy. Don't overfertilise tho - about once every 3 months enough. Too much fertiliser is a thing, and it can burn them. Don't fertilise in the winter. \n\n\n\n- \u26a0\ufe0f on the topic of eating, many houseplants are toxic to pets if ingested. If you have pets, particularly playful ones, make sure to research ahead to avoid trouble! \n\n\n\n- Don't rush to repot. I know you want to put them in these cute pots you got, but keep them in nursery pots for at least a month. Many plants experience environmental change shock between you taking them from the store and bringing them home, so don't make it harder for them, they will thank you with many happy years in those sweet pots of yours. \n\n\n\n- speaking of pots, always have drainage. Try not to put plants straight into a decorative pot without drainage - get a bigger planter and put it in with nursery pot and tray.\n\n\n\n\n- chop of leaves that go yellow - they won't go green again, and the plant is wasting resources on it. \n\n\n\n\n- if cactuses or succulents, you still have to water them, albeit rarely. Many people recommend cactuses as the most beginner houseplants, but you can absolutely kill both cactuses and succulents, and not only as a beginner (I'll be the first one to admit I've killed a few). But even if they do not die on you, they will not look as lush as when bought in few months unless quite a lot of care is given. If you really want an unkillable plant, get a pothos or peace lily. They both droop when thirsty (so they give you a clear indication as to when to water them), have a lovely chunky foliage, are quite cheap and very sturdy. Another great ones are snake plants. Most cactuses and succulents would go on 4th and 5th place on the \"hardest to kill\" list. \n\n\n\n\n\n- your plant may experience a bit of a shock after about half a year since you bought it, as the fertiliser given in store usually runs out around that time. Don't panic, it is not dying, just give it a little love and plant food and it will be happy again. \n\n\n\nFollow these and you should be just fine for the majority of plants.\n\n\n\nHouseplanrs are awesome decorations that can light up any place, and more than you think are extremely low maintenance. It is a nice hobby for the soul, and don't stress if you kill one, happens to everyone every now and then. Some species are drama queens, and some specimen of no-fuss plants are ungrateful bastards. That being said, most will comply, because they want to be alive just as much as you want them alive. [Here](https://youtu.be/l6huWZZaZek) is a little guide on what to expect from common low maintenance species.

I usually can spot a scam. Today, I didn't. \n \nSo I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought. \n \nWithin a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period. \n \nThe one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.\n \nEdit: This has gained a massive amount of traction. I would like to thank this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ejq9oy/ysk_to_never_trust_a_call_from_your_bank_always/fczynoa?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for the idea to post it here.

Either way, it has been a nice topic of discussion. \n \nIf nothing else, I hope this post saves at least one other person from going through what I went through. \n \nEdit2: It seems in my slightly frazzled, yet still very amused, state last night, that I missed a few proof reading spots. I appreciate the red pen marks fellow redditors. Keep up the good work.\n .\n \n.\n \n.\n \n**************Update*************************\n \n. \n \n.\n \n2 week edit. As it sits right now, the money has been refunded (minus an overdraft fee incurred during the event), new account has been made, new card has been received. \n \n\n \nTo clear up some misconceptions, here's is some added info. \n \n1. BBT called me. It was not an unknown number. It was BBT's main contact number you can find on the back of your card. I usually do not answer the phone for anyone that isn't family. What led me to answer it that morning was that I had already received a fraud alert text from BBT about 5 mins before. Turns out, that was fake as well. BBT only uses one short code messaging system. \n \n2. I didn't give them any personal info. My SSN was not shared. My account number, routing number, or debit card number was not given out by me. They already had (almost) all the info they needed. My address, my telephone number on file, the email used for my account, the debit card \"that was hacked\". They used the info they had to tie my card to Google Pay. They only thing they needed was the code that got sent to my phone. Actually 2 codes. One to reset my password for the app, and one to add the card to Google Pay. He played it off that the first code had expired and had to send another one. He said the code was to \"lock\" the online account so that the fraud could be looked into. \n \n3. This LPT, like many others on here, is not accurate 100% of the time. They can and might call you. They should never make you verify your info. If you read the comments though, it is definitely a great practice if you get suspicious. Hang up and call from a different land line number or a cell phone. Read the comments for more info on the different land line stuff. \n \n4. The amount of money that was taken is kinda irrelevant. $1000 to me, is different then $1000 to you. Or to the guy living paycheck to paycheck. The part that matters is that it was everything I had at the moment. The spending money for a weekend date. Junk food for the kids while we are out on our date. Running money for 2 weeks. You get the idea. All gone. (Luckily, we had gift cards from Xmas and still got our date night.)\n \n5. Lastly, thank you all for all the kind words and reassurances.

U.S. healthcare really shouldn\u2019t be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge. \n\nThey make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I\u2019ve mentioned, they\u2019ll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement.\n \nSome bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.\n\nIf you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!\n\nYou can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.\n\nIf you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren\u2019t even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!\n\nYou can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more. \n\nAnother thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.\n\nEDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there\u2019s some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don\u2019t think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no \u201cpropaganda\u201d or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation.

We went to see Deadpool about a dozen times.\n\nLast summer Joe, in his early 40s, had been having some stomach issues for a few weeks, then passed out at work. They did tests.

Did you just move to a new state and are considering reporting abuse by your parents but don't know what the foster care system looks like in you new state? They do! Can you open a bank account without a parent, etc. - they likely know! They also take calls from siblings, parents, extended family, kinship placements, child welfare workers, etc.\n\n**There are 5 very important services funded by the RHY program.**\n\n**Basic Center Program:** Shelter program which includes counseling, trauma-informed care, life skills, and other help. Usually for kids under 18, depends on the state.\n\n**Maternity Group Home Program:** Shelter for youth with kids, must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, child development, parenting help, budgeting, nutrition, etc.\n\n**Transitional Living Program:**  Must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, job help, nutrition, budgeting ,etc.\n\n**Street Outreach Program:** My favorite program. Outreach workers meet youth where they are at on the streets, in parks, etc. These outreach workers adjust to whatever level of support you need- they could just drop off food and warm clothes or they could help you access emergency shelter and sign up for health insurance.\n\n**National Runaway Safeline:**  1-800-RUNAWAY or [http://www.1800runaway.org/](http://www.1800runaway.org/). They were an actual switchboard back in the day that would allow kids to contact their families if they ran away. Now they have forums on their website where thousands of kids ask a ton of questions FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD about how to be safe. They work with Greyhound to provide bus trips home for runaway youth and also do a lot of outreach around issues concerning runaway and homeless youth.  \n\n\n \n\nIn lieu of awards, please google your local youth/adult/domestic violence shelter and donate to them!

Let me add a few things, since a lot of my fellow healthcare workers have chimed in. \n\n1. CD Players: YES PLEASE. Plus your loved one's favorite CDs. \n2. So many photos. All of them. You can't go overboard. I will sit there and go through every photo with them every day, if you want me to. I really don't mind. \n3. Clothes, one size larger. Please label them. I will do it myself if you can't but don't be upset when/if you see Mom wearing roommate's clothes. Maybe you didn\u2019t send enough, maybe the washer is broken. Maybe you didn\u2019t label correctly. Kindly point it out and someone will explain or rectify the problem. \n4. Food gifts are almost always allowed, just be sure to check with nursing staff first. If your loved one is on a low-sodium diet and you keep bringing them McDonald's, that's a yikes. Also be careful about sharing with other residents. Your loved one's roommate might be on a special diet and you keep giving them french fries and we can't figure out why they're not feeling good. \n\nAdditional points:\nOH MY GOD YOU ARE NOT A BAD PERSON FOR PUTTING YOUR LOVED ONE IN A COMMUNITY. CARING FOR SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA IS A FULL TIME JOB, LITERALLY I HAVE TWO DEGREES TO HELP ME DO IT. IF YOU ARE 90 YEARS OLD AND YOUR SPOUSE HAS AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DEMENTIA AND THEY HIT YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO? Keep your judgement out of my inbox. I have now worked in a geriatric psychiatric ward too- and these 90 year old women who have literally been assaulted by their once-loving husbands at 2am have to hear your fucking bullshit about how they can\u2019t care for their spouse and what the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus Christ use your brain. Maybe your grandma insists that she needs to get to the bus stop at 4pm, right when you\u2019re getting home from work every day- do you want to quit your job because she can\u2019t stop wandering into the street? Can you afford a loving, caring facility that provides a lock on the door and 3 square meals every day with 24/7 nursing care? THEN BY ALL MEANS, GO TAKE A FUCKING TOUR OF IT AND SEE IF IT\u2019S A GOOD FIT! THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE ALL FIT FOR DEMENTIA CARE. This is a full-family journey and the focus has to be on the DIGNITY, SAFETY, AND EDUCATION of all involved.  \n\nI. Love. My. Job. Mind. Your Business.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm enjoying the hell out of everyone's energy on this post. Keep your questions and DM's coming, it's 1am EST but I'll be up for a bit longer if I can help support you either emotionally or with advice if this journey is relevant to you.\n\nEDIT 3: Big shoutout to the guy who wants to know if I have two degrees in \"wiping ass\" because this job takes \"no brains\". Foolish question, everyone knows that WIPASS-201 is only an undergrad course.\n\nIn all seriousness- both of my degrees are psychology based but geriatric specific. I am NOT clinical- I am the program director. Basically the cruise ship captain.\n\nEDIT 4: I keep getting this question of what the hell a program director is, so I'll post my response here too:\n\nAs the program director, I am in charge of scheduling, coordinating, and facilitating the activities. I either lead the activity or I delegate it to an aide who works in the afternoon. I interact with and update the families as necessary or on a schedule. I come up with creative solutions to behavioral problems and advise/inform staff and management on layouts of how to address concerns resulting from cognitive impairment. I work closely with the nursing staff to coordinate the best care with behavioral interventions paired with the pharmacological interventions. It's a huge team effort.

They will for instance put them on a so-called [performance improvement plan](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/exreq/pages/details.aspx?erid=586), or start micromanaging them to death, documenting anything that can be perceived as failures or mistakes using brand new standards. It can also be implemented as part of a [vitality curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve), where bottom performers are regularly purged from the organization, regardless of the company's results.\n\nIt's also sometimes implemented in perverse manners when a company is looking to lay off a percentage of their workforce, and managers are instructed to meet a number within their reports. Some employees, identified as financial liabilities because they might work in a support quality but not directly generate revenues, suddenly see their performance reviews peppered with what were in fact minor issues, but that were inflated to turn them into causes for firing.\n\nAnd if the employee is fired for cause, they might not be eligible for unemployment insurance, reducing the unemployment insurance tax the employer will have to pay in the future.\n\nBottomline is this: if an employer suddenly starts playing this trick on you, where you were performing just fine but are now having to jump through hoops, it means your ass has been put on the chopping block.

Not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. And that's ok. But for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. All I did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* Some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look. \n\nSecond, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda.

While strengthening your abs and core is important, your future self will thank you for strengthening your foundation. \n\nI\u2019m about to be graduate from medical school and I can\u2019t even begin to describe how important it is to have a stable spine, hips, and knees. People in their 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s, and up all complain of having constant back pain. Most of this isn\u2019t caused by things are degenerative disorders (while that can most certainly be the case) but mostly due to a sedentary lifestyles leading weak muscles which further causes joint instability and increased disc and cartilage stress in those joints. \n\nI\u2019ve seen so many elderly people come in with backs that look like question marks and people in wheelchairs due to severe osteoarthritis in their knees and hips. The best way to prevent this down the road is to strengthen the muscles around joints to give them stability and strengthen the bones themselves through weight lifting.  \n\nThe key is to just stay active and try to incorporate exercises or stretches that strengthen your back, hip, and knees. You don\u2019t have to go out and try to deadlift or squat 350lbs. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will your muscles and joints. Sedentary? Start with a walk and gradually build from there. Kind of active? Hit the gym and train these muscles. Start slow and light and get used to the movement. Then slowly increase weights. FOCUS ON FORM NOT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT.  Don\u2019t have a workout partner to check your form? Ask one of those jacked dudes at the gym. They have been some of the nicest people I\u2019ve met and are always helpful.

HR and finance will almost never sign off hiring a new employee without a budget being in place.", "selftext": "As a first point, you should always push back on discussing salary as close to an offer being made as possible. The more they are imagining you being a part of their team, the better the negotiating position you have.\n\nOnce you're at that point, ask them what their range is. Your goal is to understand where you fit within the range. The more of the essential and desirable points in the job spec you meet, the higher up the range you'll be able to negotiate.\n\nHowever \u2013 and this is the important bit \u2013 if they come back and say 'they don't have a range', then it's almost always a lie (I'll come back to when it isn't in a minute). As someone who has either directly hired, or been involved in hiring over 40 employees across different industries, there's one constant. If you don't have sign off from HR and finance (potentially via a senior manager), then there isn't a position to hire for.\n\nTo get sign off from those two crucial departments, you need a budget (the range) so the company can ensure that they will be able to afford the new hire, and that the salary is less than the ROI they will bring to the company.\n\n(It's also good to know that it can sometimes be worth pushing for a little over the defined range. I once had a company come back with a \u00a36k offer above the top end of their budget because they hadn't expected to find someone at my level. They'd under budgeted and were competing against three other solid offers \u2013 all above the original top end of their budget).\n\nNow the only time that this might not apply is if they are hiring for a highly specialised position (either technical, or executive/c-suite level) where they need to pay whatever the market is demanding. But the chances are with those positions, you'll have a recruiter handling the negotiations who knows standard market rates and will be pushing for as high a salary as possible without going over what's reasonable, because their commission is usually a percentage of the accepted offer.\n\nIf the job you're interviewing for doesn't fall into those above categories, then be very careful \u2013 especially when there's a deliverable involved in the interview process.

{"title": "LPT: If you ever find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask a stranger to help you.", "selftext": "Edit: So glad that this can be useful to some of you. Westfield is a chain of shopping centres in the UK, AU, & US. In the moment of panic, I went to the bathroom, I realise too it probably wasn\u2019t the best space to go.\n\nI was at Westfield pretty late writing my thesis paper \\~23:00, and after I got up to leave, I noticed the only other guy in the area leave as well. Typically I'm the only left because I stay back past dinner and had thought he would naturally just leave when all the restaurants closed (Westfield closed at midnight, and all shops were closed.) I got some creepy vibes from him so I walked some loops from L3 to L1 and he was still following me. I went to the bathroom to calm myself, spent about 20mins there and called an uber (normally I walk home because it's pretty safe at night, but I felt if I left the centre where there were no cameras it would be safer to catch a ride). When I came out, I thought I must've spent long enough in there, and he had left but he was sitting on a bench obscured by the elevators ahead. I walked past him as discreetly as possible, towards the parking lot but he got up and followed me too. So I went back round to the supermarket, the only place I knew would still be open and walked around aimlessly until I saw a couple walk in for some late-night grocery shopping. I was afraid to inconvenience them but ended up asking if they could accompany me whilst I waited. I explained I'd been followed and didn't feel safe, and if they could walk with me to the car park where my uber would arrive. They agreed, and once it came, I thanked them and yeeted out of there.\n\nIf I had walked home alone maybe something bad could have happened to me, maybe not. All I know is that I didn't feel safe. I don't know who needs to hear this but don't let politeness or fear of inconveniencing someone - it could be stranger, adult, or friend, to stop you from seeking help.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for your awards, advice and sharing your stories, I\u2019m really overwhelmed how many of you have found this useful. Of course, equally amazed and grateful to know how many of you wouldn\u2019t hesitate to help someone out.\n\nAddressing some comments: Some have mentioned they've encountered similar situations and received no help from the person they asked, I understand the embarrassment that may be felt, but it's alright to ask another person. You know you are more likely to be in danger than you are a danger to others.\n\nNot American, so I wouldn't have protective equipment as it's not legal for the general public to carry them; I didn\u2019t confront them because I didn\u2019t know how they would react and could possibly incite them to harm me; no crime happened so I didn\u2019t think of calling the police, but now I know if the police are willing to escort, it\u2019s valid to be escorted.

I've been a filmmaker, a game developer, a therapist, a business systems programmer, a game tester, a customer service representative for god knows how many companies, a bartender, a chef, and currently, a university lecturer.

Sounds like that person could use my therapy skills XD)\n\nEdit 2: There seems to be a lot of fussing and feuding in the comments, so I'll address that. A university lecturer here in the UK is simply someone who teaches at a university. I know in some other places we are called \"professors\", but that's kind of an inaccurate term, since we are rarely professors in terms of our qualifications. A professorship in terms of the qualification comes after a doctorate. I personally have a doctorate, and thus my title is \"doctor\", but that's entirely different to a MEDICAL doctor (M.D), which I am very much not. At any rate, you don't even need to be a doctor to teach at a university here in the UK, just someone experienced in the field you're teaching in (my doctorate isn't even remotely related to games development, which is what I teach, for example). I wonder whether people are thinking I'm claiming to be a medical doctor or something? My doctorate is in a subject related to medicine, but I am not qualified as a literal MEDICAL DOCTOR, as in someone who can treat you in a hospital and prescribe medication etc. Do I sound that intelligent to you?? Trust me, I'm not XD\n\nMaybe people are confused because a doctorate simply means you've completed a doctorate (often called an \"academic/research degree\") in the UK? Anyone can apply to do one, and universities frequently publish requests for people to apply to undertake them. In my case, I was required to take an MPhil (Master of Philosophy) course before I began the doctorate. That's pretty standard since I didn't have one yet, and someone else was funding my doctorate application.\n\nIf you want more information, shoot me a message and I'll provide proof of this all.

{"title": "LPT TIPS: What you should never to bring to a dry cleaners", "selftext": "I owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. I know the whole process. I'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.\n\nEDIT: Disclaimer: My experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of ALL dry cleaners so take that into consideration.\n\nDOWN JACKETS -  Down items are expensive. It could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. Down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. Down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. Down items are not pressed. You could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing\n\nCOMFORTERS - Never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says \"dry-clean only.\"  Dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. Comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. Comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. If your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. You're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.\n\nSPOT-CLEAN ONLY DRESSES - Many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. Some formal dresses are \"spot-clean only\", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  It might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. Dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. Dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. They may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. Again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.\n\nWEDDING DRESSES - Wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, NEVER opt for the preservation box. Dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners DO NOT press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. By the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  So you're paying more money for the dress WITHOUT the pressing. You get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.\n\nLEATHER: Leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. So you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. Also, there is no special Leather dry cleaning method. Leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. You're essentially just paying for the labor charge. To save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with Dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWORTH IT:\n\nMEN'S BUTTON-UP SHIRTS - Men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, They're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. Dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.\n\nWOOL PEACOATS - Wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. Counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.\n\nD/C Only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.\n\nOil/grease spill - Dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. If you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. It's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.\n\nAlso want to add the benefit of opting for\"press only.\"  Baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. They are laundered. However they do look nice when pressed. So you could save money by washing items like jerseys and Polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for \"press only\" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.\n\nBottom-line: To get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  If your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e0eqyz/lpt_tips_what_you_should_never_to_bring_to_a_dry/", "created_utc": 1574494349.0, "score": 47226, "author": "BleedBluePunk", "num_comments": 1318, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/e0eqyz/lpt_tips_what_you_should_never_to_bring_to_a_dry/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

After having about $5k worth of damage repaired, I filed a diminished value claim. Progressive Insurance (the insurance of the person who was at fault) offered me $400. I said no. They then offered $600. I said no. The body shop who fixed the car recommended an independent appraiser who they said almost always gets you more money. I paid him $300 for an appraisal report that showed that the value based on auctions etc is between 2-3k. I sent that report to Progressive. They reviewed it and then had their appraiser do their own research and then contacted my appraiser to negotiate a \u201csettlement\u201d. We agreed on $2100. \n\nThe independent appraiser told me not enough people know about diminished value claims. He said if you have a later model car with under X miles (varies by state), it\u2019s a no brainer claim but never accept the insurance company\u2019s offer because they will low ball you a lot until you bring them evidence otherwise. All this cost me was $300 and 45 min of my time to have the appraiser see and take photos of the vehicle.\n\n\nEDIT 1: As someone posted below, the ability to get a claim does depend on the make and model of your car and it's value. I should add that the independent adjuster I talked to gave me a ballpark value of what he thought the claim should be before I ever paid him a penny. He did say in some cases, it may not be worth it but knowing the details of my car (age, mileage, condition), I was getting low balled. You mileage may vary.\n\nEDIT 2: As many have stated, Diminished Value laws vary by state so please check state laws before filing as to not waste your time (or money). Every state may have different time frames for when you can file. \n\nEDIT 3: This is based on my experience in America. I have no idea how this works globally outside the US, if at all.\n\nEDIT 4: wow. Did not expect this to blow up like it did.

Some key excerpts are:\n- \u201cThe most common way to \u2018\u2018catch a cold\u2019\u2019 is to pick up a rhinovirus with the fingertip and introduce it into the eye or nose.\u201d\n- \u201cIt is possible to avoid catching a new cold by paying close attention to the hands. Not touching the eyes or nose with the fingers will decrease the risk of infection.\u201d\n\nHence, this LPT. It\u2019s based on the well documented phenomenon of self-inoculation. Washing one\u2019s hands is still the gold standard. However, the vast majority of people are not washing their hands especially often. Conversely, people are constantly touching their faces, essentially subconsciously. Therefore, to reduce the risk of transmission/self-inoculation, stop touching your face (particularly around your eyes). \n\nThe study \"Protective Effect of Hand-Washing and Good Hygienic Habits Against Seasonal Influenza: A Case-Control Study.\" specifically concludes that \"infrequent touching [of] the eyes, nose, or mouth with ones hands\" led to a \"substantially lower risk of community-acquired influenza infection\" (frequent hand washing and getting the flu vaccine were also associated with substantially lower risk). \n\nIn the article \"Medical myth busting: Separating fact from fiction about colds and flu\" from the Fred Hutch, Dr. Steve Pergam (member of the Vaccine an Infectious Disease Division there) says things like:\n- \"To infect someone, these particles don\u2019t have to be breathed in, they just have to get into any mucosal surface \u2014 eyes, mouth or nose. . . Stop touching your face!\"\n- \"Your hands touch elevator buttons, public transport rails, all the different places you go on a daily basis, then you touch your face hundreds of times a day. I have a bottle of hand gel with me at all times.  You can\u2019t stop yourself all the time, but be more aware of whether your hands are clean before you start rubbing your eyes.\"\n\nA 1982 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology titled \"TRANSMISSION OF EXPERIMENTAL RHINOVIRUS INFECTION BY CONTAMINATED SURFACES\" found that in a controlled setting, when healthy adults touched a surface contaminated with rhinovirus and then touched their face, up to 56% of them became infected. \n\nThe 2015 study \"Survival of rhinoviruses on human fingers\" states \"person-to-person transmission is most likely due to the contamination of hands by the nasal secretions of the infected person passed to a susceptible individual, either directly to the fingers or via an environmental intermediary; infection then follows from self-inoculation to the upper nasal airways or eyes.\" and subsequently cites four more studies as supporting evidence.\n\nI could go on and on but I think at this point it's on the Redditor to do their own reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e5iz4j/lpt_teach_yourself_to_not_touch_your_face/", "created_utc": 1575388133.0, "score": 46387, "author": "starbuilt", "num_comments": 1675, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/e5iz4j/lpt_teach_yourself_to_not_touch_your_face/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This made me realize what I would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.\n\n\n**Warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- Hospital HVACS systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. I was told they could only bump it up or down here at my VA hospital. Also, this was the first time I received an IV treatment and let me tell you they are cold... Had an IV in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and I am pretty convinced I could put a fan on it to air condition the room.\n\n\n**Warm, comfortable socks**- Reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. Maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *Credit*: /u/Getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so I followed up and asked my nurse about this.  Turns out, the VA hospital does have socks available and my new RN was shocked that no one had offered them to me \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n\n**Condiments** - I believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. This problem might be compounded by medication. May have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **EDIT** I recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  Generally, it would be wiser to consult with the RN or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  \n\n\n**Open toe slippers**- Luckily I had flip flops on when I was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. Making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if I only had tennis shoes. Probably would of went barefoot in that case.  \n\n\n**Long, braided phone charger** - My wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. I can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. I recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. Also, I am using a 5ft USB hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.\n\n\n**Entertainment**: A book, eReader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   The TV service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. Another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. If they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. The gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *EDIT* /u/stjernDale recommended audiobooks.  Great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! \n\n\n**Gift Cards**: *Credit: /u/1900grs, /u/HalftimeHeaters.*  Gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  \n\n\n*Bonus LPT*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  They take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  This bonus LPT is intended for *adult patients.*\n\n\nEdit 1\n\n**Power Bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  This was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.\n\n\nEdit 2\n\n**Eye Mask & Ear plugs** - /u/Ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/SuedeVeil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  Especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.\n\n**Moisturizers & Chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/FatJennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  I will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/60baw1/lpt_got_a_friend_or_family_in_the_hospital/", "created_utc": 1489945503.0, "score": 45497, "author": "genechem", "num_comments": 1301, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/60baw1/lpt_got_a_friend_or_family_in_the_hospital/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the subject, please read about it on specialised websites.\n\nPeople often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm.

{"title": "LPTs: Chrome extensions I wish I knew of back when I started college.", "selftext": "As I am about to enter my grad school I have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. As a result, I recently started exploring Chrome extensions, and man I wish I had done this earlier. Some will no longer be of use to me but I hope it can help others. \n\n[**Cite This For Me: Web Citer**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)\nThis one hurts me a bit as my days with MLA, APA, Harvard, and Chicago are coming to an end. The extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. From my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as EasyBib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.\n\n[**Google Dictionary**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)\nIf you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). It's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. I imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. \n\n[**Grammarly for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)\nI often use bad grammar and I know it. This extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. It highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. \n\n[**Readability**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)\nThis extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. I would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article I'd give this a shot. \n\n[**SpeakIt!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-US)\n\nI know I can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. This app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. Or I guess you could take notes as you listen too...\n\nIt works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand German-English accents over the default one). You can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. I could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but I would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. \n\n[**Block & Focus**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)\n\nType in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. Manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. There are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. \n\n[**MolView**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)\n\nI haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in O-Chem or higher. It allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. I was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what I'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.\n\n**Bonus Tips That I Learned**\n\n\n***Make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** Leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. It will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. \n\n***Use [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** It's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. I cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as I stayed up too late studying. \n\n***Use [RainyMood](https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** I'm sure many of you know about it but I love this one.\n\nI'm sure I have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. Feel free to tell me any I should try out! \n\n**Use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your PC screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -Credit to KreekyBonez for that one!\n\nGood luck in your studies my friends!\n_________________________________________________________________________\nEDIT: Cleaned up the post and added the links to the extensions. Also added Flu.x per KreekyBonez as it is one I think people should be aware of. \n_________________________________________________________________________\nEDIT: Thanks for the love guys, this blew up way more than I expected! Glad to help. Wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments.\n\nI hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. It isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **Always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. But if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. Just wanted to throw that out there as many Redditors have been commenting on those two extensions.

{"title": "LPT: There are other search engines than Google's. You can choose to protect your privacy or plant trees while you search.", "selftext": "Some of my personal choices in alphabetical order:\n\n[Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) doesn't track you, simple as that. Downside is that it doesn't know you, your preferences and so on. But that's kind of the point.\n\n[Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) plants trees. Based on Bing. Has been my personal choice for years. Sometimes when I'm not satisfied by the search results I type in #g to be redirected to Google, which in my experience is very seldom more fruitful.\n\n[Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is quite useful in academics. If you're not sure how to cite a source in e.g. APA-style, Google scholar helps you out.\n\n[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is supposed to be really good for answering (numerical) questions. Plots functions which is nice. Haven't used it much for some reason.\n\nThere are many other alternatives, so if you know some specific search engines that you find helpful, please let us know in the comments!\nWikipedia also has a great [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines).\n\nAnother matter is Google translate. Depending on your language it can be less than perfect. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) does neural machine translation and has much better results. It only translates Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. It's pretty good at translating English to German and vice versa. I don't have a clue how the performance is in other languages though. Let me know if there has been some kind of breakthrough in translating Finnish.\n\nShouldn't forget maps. Google has great satellite images and street view. [Bing](https://www.bing.com/maps/) often has better aerial views. Check out if there are better local resources that have e.g. topographic maps which are just on another level, especially if you hike or are prone to getting lost in the woods. Get a compass while you're at it. I love maps in general btw. So [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) has to be mentioned. It's collaborative and non-commercial. Check it out and help to make it more precise locally!\n\nEnglish isn't my first language, and I'm also a grammarnazi, so please point out any mistakes that I made. +Shoutout to the Ask Jeeves crew! Yes, you are old, but maybe a bit wiser too. :)\n\nEDIT: Oh my, over a thousand comments now, can't interact with everyone anymore. Thanks to everybody that has joined this discussion! To address a few concerns about me basically advertising for Ecosia. That's a valid critique, and now I feel a bit naive about well, kind of advertising for them. Commenters have come to my rescue in a way by confirming (with sources) that it is indeed a legitimate enterprise that uses the money they make to fund others that plant trees. Don't believe me, check it out yourself. I'm not their freaking spokesperson. I genuinely like to use it, and that crept into my post and maybe it shouldn't have. We have to live with that now. Oh, and their tree count is approximate. Go and count the trees at their different projects and update the database if that bothers you so much.\n\nNext! Basically every online translator engine uses neural machine translation. WolframAlpha is not a search engine, but a computational knowledge engine, which understandably is a bit different to the former concept. What else? Oh, I actually was about to include bing/videos (for your preferred sexual practices), but left it out because I wasn't sure if it is still relevant. According to some commenters it is. So happy masturbating to everyone! Anyway, there haven't been many comments about alternatives, in search engines is what I mean.

{"title": "LPT: if you call a suicide hotline and get put on hold, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care about you! We also don\u2019t read off of scripts. Other misconceptions below.", "selftext": "I have worked at a suicide hotline for about 2 years now and I have found that there are many misconceptions about suicide and crisis hotline workers and volunteers.  I can\u2019t speak for every organization, but I hope that I can address a few of the general concerns that I see now so that you feel more comfortable calling.\n\n1.  \u201cWhy did I get put in a queue? Do they not care that I\u2019m about to kill/hurt myself?\u201d  We absolutely DO CARE! Please, please stay on the line.  At my organization, when you call you first talk to a \u201ccrisis screener\u201d who\u2019s job it is to take down whatever information you want to give them and then send you to one of two queues.  One queue is for people actively wanting to commit suicide and the other is for people in general crisis but not suicidal.  This is where some people get stuck on hold for a while because we are actively taking calls from the queue as they come in.  Every night is different and every shift is different. Sometimes I\u2019ll get 3 calls in 4 hours and I can really take my time with each person.  Other times, we have 10 people waiting in the queue but I still want to give each person their respective time to de-escalate.  We can also see if someone has dropped from the queue and it always makes me sad to see that someone hung up.  I want to talk to you. We all want to help.\n\n2. \u201cWorkers just talk from a script so there\u2019s no point in calling\u201d.  This is absolutely not true.  When you talk to me, I\u2019m given a blank notepad and that\u2019s it.  Through extensive training, we learn about ways to help you de-escalate your thoughts, open up and feel comfortable, and help you specifically identify what you are feeling in a crisis moment.  Our onboarding teachers really focused on how every caller is different and every situation is case-dependent. I would never boil down your experiences to a script. \n\n3. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call again tonight because I\u2019ve already called once and I\u2019m going to bother them\u201d.  Please feel comfortable calling as many times as you need if you are in active crisis.  Most likely you won\u2019t even be talking to the same phone worker as everyone goes into the same queue.  I would say about 50% of my calls are people who I regularly hear from every day/week - they say their name or I recognize their voices.  20% are likely callers who have already called once in the night and need to talk again.  This is perfectly fine and I\u2019m happy to explore what worked for you last time you called and what can work again this time.\n\n4. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hang up on me\u201d.  We are not allowed to hang up on anyone (and I wouldn\u2019t want to) unless they are being abusive to us or won\u2019t let us speak.  We get a surprising amount of prank calls and people who call just to scream at us.  THAT BEING SAID - I have accidentally hung up on people before.  I feel absolutely horrible when this happens but I hope that everyone knows that they should call back.  If I am actively talking to you or you are telling a story and we get disconnected, know that I didn\u2019t get bored and hang up. Something definitely happened on the worker\u2019s line.\n\n5. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call because they will record what I\u2019m saying and it will be used against me later.\u201d  From my knowledge, most privately and gov owned phone lines do not record phone calls.  Some that I am unaware of may have different standards but at least with the ones I\u2019m aware of in my state and National level, we all make it very clear before your call that we are 100% anonymous.  We don\u2019t record conversations or calls - I don\u2019t even think our phones can do that.  Most times I take notes so that I can remember your name and specific hardships that you mention but we have shredders all around the office to discard those after we hang up.  You are also welcomed to not disclose your name if you have something really personal that you feel scared to let out.  If you are ever unsure about what is being recorded, please ask your phone worker and they will tell you what your organization allows. \n\n6. \u201cMy problems are too big for them to handle\u201d.  We have heard everything, trust me.  Everything from teens wanting to shoot up their schools to people who are having affairs to people calling us so that they can masterbate.  Nothing you say will surprise us or be too much for us to talk you through.  \n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any more questions in the comments if you have additional things that you are curious or unsure about.  I greatly recommend that you print out your local crisis line\u2019s number and hang it on your fridge and enter it to your phone.  You have no idea how many calls we get from children/teens who got our number from their parents/friend\u2019s parents either directly or indirectly.\n\nIf you are looking to find a hotline in your country, please refer to this link: https://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html.  I recommend if you are in the United States that you look up a free, 24 hour hotline in your city or state (rather than the National hotline) as they will be more likely to have a smaller queue and can also give you strong resources within your zip code or area.  You can save this number for if you are having an emergency.  Never hesitate to call the National hotline either, though which can be found at that link.\n\nPlease call us.  We are ready and eager to help.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit:  concerning mandated reporting to 911 because many people are asking about it, every organization is different.  For mine, we are mandated reporters in cases where people are in active suicide or planning to hurt someone else.  We don\u2019t call the police but we do call 911 and we have no control over what they decide is best in that situation (whether they should get cops involved or just emergency services.). However people saying that they feel suicidal is far from being in active suicide.  Even people that have access to suicidal methods, like if someone has a gun or pills in their home, we will not call unless they are actively trying to use them to kill themselves.  De-escalation is our main priority.\n\nThat being said, if we do need to call the 911, my call center and certain others have no way of knowing where the caller is since we are a 100% anonymous call center.  Some organizations may have trackers or can give your number away but we either have to convince people to call 911 themselves so that their location can be shared or we have to talk it out of them.\n\nFor example, I got a call one time from a lady who had just taken a bunch of sleeping pills and just wanted someone talk to while she died.  Through about 20 minutes of conversation I was able to get her to tell me where she was located and so emergency services were sent.  This is pretty rare and it only is required maybe once every couple of months.  Many people are sharing stories of themselves getting hurt by police and thrown into mental wards. I know that this is common and this is why my organization really doesn\u2019t call 911 much.  Again, I cannot control if the 911 operator decides if the police should be involve or not and if this does happen if you get taken to a psych evaluation at a hospital.  My job in that moment is to save your life and remember, it\u2019s not a choice - I\u2019m a mandated reporter to 911 which means I\u2019m required to call.  I try HARD AS HELL to prevent this from happening though but some situations are dire.  I really recommend asking whatever hotline you are calling what their mandated reporting requirements are or looking on their website under terms and conditions where it is laid out in writing.  \n\nMost times if people are in very bad mental crisis that we cannot completely de escalate in a 30 min call, we can offer to send a mobile crisis team to your location. This involves sending two trained mental health professionals to an address that you give us and consent to them coming out to.  This is fairly common and probably happens around once every two hours on the line but it still not the most preferred conclusion.  We work very hard to help you on that phone anonymously and quickly.  I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to be turned away from getting help because they\u2019re scared about what me as a phone worker is going to do.\n\nIf you are ever concerned about what is reported, being recorded, etc... please ask your phone worker.  We are legally required to be transparent to you.  Thank you!\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit #2:  here are some additional answers to questions I\u2019ve been getting in the comments:\n\n1.  \u201cShould I still call the line if I am just depressed and not suicidal?\u201d  There are two different types of lines that I wish were spread around more clearly.  One is a suicide-only hotline.  These workers will only answer and respond to people who are actively suicidal or having suicide ideation right now.  Many of the negative stories in the comments have people saying that they were hung up on because they weren\u2019t \u201cthat depressed\u201d.  I can\u2019t diminish your experience and I\u2019m sorry that it happened.  In the future, if you know that you are not actively suicidal but still need someone to call, call a \u201ccrisis hotline\u201d.  These are also trained volunteers and workers who deal with general crises.  Things like if you are depressed, having anxiety, want to vent, need to cry, need to get resources for drug addiction or domestic abuse etc... this is the place to call.  It\u2019s also okay if you call the crisis line and later end up talking about suicidal thoughts, it happens more than you know.\n\n2. \u201cHow do I get a job as a phone worker or volunteer?\u201d  The way I did it was that I went on my local hotline\u2019s page by searching ones near me on google.  There was a tab that said volunteer and I filled out my email and a small application on there.  Within a week, a supervisor reached out to me and asked me to fill out more information involving sending them my resume, filling out a 4 page document on why I want to work there, and undergoing a background check.  Another week or so later, I got instructions on how to join an orientation where they told me more about the work and we could choose if we were still interested or not.  After a year of being a volunteer, I applied to a bachelors-level paid position at my hotline in which I oversee other volunteers if they have questions or concerns about calls.  My organization has bachelors and masters level positions.  I got my B.S. in physiology.\n\n3. I want to say thank you to everyone who is sharing their bad experiences here as well as their good ones.  It\u2019s important that organizations learn from people\u2019s shitty experiences so that we can all get better as a whole.  I\u2019ve been suicidal and have attempted in my lifetime.  I\u2019ve called a suicide hotline and had a bad experience where I felt like I was wasting their time. I also called a couple times after that and was connected to the best people I have ever had the experience talking to.  They saved my life.  I applied to help because I want to make sure that everyone has a good, or atleast fair, experience when they are speaking to me as a phone worker.  \n\nThere are a couple of things that I recommend if you want to get the best chance at having good experience calling a phone line.  For one, I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again, National phones lines have longer queues and they are likely rushed as phone workers.  They\u2019re not a bad resource at all but if you are of sound mind, I recommend searching and saving a smaller hotline\u2019s number around your area that deals with suicide or crisis that way you can have them in your phone when you need them.  Next, if you are concerned about if giving away your information will be tracked or reported... ASK.  Always ask so you never feel like you were duped into having the cops called on you or your address taken.  Ask if your call is recorded, ask if your number is recorded, and ask if you can even remain anonymous.  I don\u2019t care what information you give me about yourself, I care about helping you get through tonight.  Many of this information can be found on your hotline\u2019s website under the terms and conditions. Read through these if you don\u2019t want to ask.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nI have taken a break from this account indefinitely.  I don\u2019t know what some of you want from me. I made an informational post based on MY experiences as a phone line worker and told you all of my knowledge on how to have the best chances at a good experience because often people have bad ones.  I\u2019ve called 911 on probably about 5 people in my whole career because they already took active measures to end their life or were planning on ending someone else\u2019s soon.  They also knew that I was going to call and GAVE ME THEIR INFORMATION AND LOCATION because they realized that they needed in-person and immediate help that we cannot give them.  I didn\u2019t \u201cswat them\u201d or \u201csend police to their door for no reason\u201d.  I understand that this may be a rosey organization that I work at but the advice I gave to ask questions, call smaller hotlines, and read the terms and conditions still stand for any hotline you are calling.  Take a look at their website and understand their protocol. \n\nPeople have been messaging me that I should kill myself, that they hope I get cancer, that I\u2019m the reason their father/mother died, I\u2019m the reason they got sent a 20,000 dollar medical bill, I\u2019m the reason they were trapped in a mental health facility for 7 months, I\u2019m the reason they got beaten up by cops, etc... How can you say these things to another human being and then complain about how your own mental health was treated?  I\u2019ve been blamed for the actions of a huge line of decision-making people that I don\u2019t even come in contact with at my job.  I\u2019ve been blamed for the actions of people at other organizations who I will never meet or talk to in my life.  I have a history of depression and suicidal ideation as stated in my post, and frankly, the comments attacking me have brought up a lot of that which is why I need to go.  I\u2019m not upset that people have had bad experiences and are sharing them, that is inevitable and encouraged as I have also had bad experiences and we need to learn from them. I\u2019m upset that people are messaging me really horrific things and attacking me.\n\nI still want people to know that there are good organizations out there filled with people who want to help.  I know the comments here seem overwhelmingly negative but, often people who have had good or life saving experiences will not comment.  Not all hotlines are good but I hope, if you need it, you will still try to find one based on my advice above.  I wish I could bring all of you who have had bad experiences to my line and let you listen to the constant stream of people that we help for 8 hours a day, but I can\u2019t and I realize that asking you to trust me after your personal, horrific experiences is too much to ask.  I hope that you all have found a therapist, psychiatrist, support group, or other healthcare professional or service and are working to heal from your mental health issues.  I\u2019m still doing so myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kaj4ff/lpt_if_you_call_a_suicide_hotline_and_get_put_on/", "created_utc": 1607619764.0, "score": 43495, "author": "wheresyourpickle", "num_comments": 1343, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/kaj4ff/lpt_if_you_call_a_suicide_hotline_and_get_put_on/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "LPT: If a loved one passes away, make them proud instead of throwing your life away.", "selftext": "Hi!\n\nSo when i was 10 years old (13 now) my dad passed away of a stroke.\n\nIt was a rough 3 weeks and school was a total mess. I finished my year (year 6) and we decided to move to another city. So during year 7 I was still pretty messed up. My grades went from pretty good to really bad. I finished the year with 18 pts (pretty bad-ish for Switzerland) the next school year is a big year academically. You need to get 20 pts to get into VP (Voie Pr\u00e9gymnasiale) basically sends you automatically to college/HS (idk lol) once you finish 11th grade. \n\nAnyways I realized that nothing that I ever did or say would bring my father back. So after grieving for what seemed like and eternity I decided to make him proud instead of failing.\n\nHere\u2019s how I did it.\n\nAfter my worst year in school ever I went back in and started to put in some effort. I paid attention, I studied hard at home. When exams where approaching I studied like never before. (4+ hours every day) I got very good results from this. Finished the year with 21 /24 pts and got into VP.\n\nI also had to deal with a new school and I had to try and make new friends which was not easy.\n\nIn summary:\n\nIn the beginning it will hurt. A lot. But overtime you will learn that it\u2019s more important to shoot for the sky\u2019s rather than fall to the ground. I kept my motivation and dignity to help myself and make my father proud.\n\nIn the end it paid off.\n\n\nEdit: Wow! I did NOT expect that to do so well. Words could not express how grateful I am to see the response in general let alone the awards. I\u2019ll try my best to respond to all of you but no promises. Thank you so much.\n\nEdit 2: so apparently my message didn\u2019t really come across the full way. Yes a dead person can not feel pride, my point is:\n\nMake yourself proud and do what you think is best for you and do what you *think* would make a deceased loved one proud. This (in my case) worked for me but every person has their different way of grieving and their different way of going about things going forward. Also try your best to pull yourself up no matter how hard life throws you down. I know some people just can\u2019t because of their own guilt or sorrow but at least try.\n\nIf you fail I wish you can one day succeed in all of your endeavors and dreams.\n\nOh and to all of you people that live to downvote comments that make me feel *actually* better\n\nSeriously, fuck you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/i81pg9/lpt_if_a_loved_one_passes_away_make_them_proud/", "created_utc": 1597185066.0, "score": 42256, "author": "None", "num_comments": 787, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/i81pg9/lpt_if_a_loved_one_passes_away_make_them_proud/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

End of year is fast approaching and it\u2019s time for performance reviews & raises.\n\nThe inflation rate this year is 5.6%. This is very important for those of you working in corporations that like to put out flat 2% raises or cap raises at 3-4%. Companies adjust their prices regularly to account for inflation and should adjust pay as well but it\u2019s not in their interest to do so. Many will try to use excuses that \u201cbe happy you got a whole 3% that\u2019s more than most/I even got\u201d or even \u201cyou got a whole 4% RAISE. That\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nBut the fact is 5.4% is just to maintain. If you get less than a 5.4% raise you are getting a pay CUT and if you get a 5.4% \u201craise\u201d they are just paying you the same as before. Your company may be struggling or needing to cut back and unable to give you more. But you do need to be aware that even if they are giving you a token \u201craise\u201d it is a pay cut.\n\nThe practice of giving/accepting 2% flat raises is why people find coworkers getting hired for more than them after a few years. It\u2019s because you have been accepting pay cuts every year.\n\nEdit: my apologies the data I looked at didn\u2019t was a month out of date the inflation rate is actually 6.2% as of October.\n\nThis is for US.

{"title": "LPT: Bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike", "selftext": "**TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**\n\nShort hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.\n\nThe recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, \"fun\" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.\n\nShe survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*\n\nI myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.\n\nAnd now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.\n\nSo: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.\n\nThe things I have in mine include:\n\n\\- Survival heating blanket\n\n\\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter\n\n\\- Whistle\n\n\\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries\n\n\\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)\n\n\\- Critical meds and bandages\n\n\\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)\n\n\\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)\n\n\\- Compass (if you're able to use it)\n\n\\- Paracord\n\n\\- Knife\n\n\\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)\n\n\\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).\n\n\\- Iodine tabs for water\n\n\\- Beef jerky\n\n\\- Energy gel\n\n**Edit:** Because it may be of interest: I just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that I don't mention in the list. For reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.\n\n**Edit 2:** I wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. The kit I describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. \n\nThe kit I mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.\n\nFor people wanting to see the kit I made, or skeptical it can be done - just google Nalgene survival kit. Lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than I have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. \n\nDefinitely tailor your kit to your area, too.\n\nFinally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *This kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/btqqyk/lpt_bring_a_24hour_survival_kit_on_even_the/", "created_utc": 1558987947.0, "score": 40044, "author": "None", "num_comments": 1663, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/btqqyk/lpt_bring_a_24hour_survival_kit_on_even_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Know where your emergency exit is and how to use it. My kids learned how to open and unlock a car door as soon as they were old enough to understand they should only do that when the engine is off.\n\nAs they get older - I will teach them that this extends much wider than just locations and physical objects. It extends to religions (any religion you can join but not physically leave safely is a cult), relationships (my kids know - you always need a bank account in YOUR NAME ONLY with enough money to live on for at least a month; possessive relationships are a HUGE red flag; you NEVER stay in a relationship where someone even loosely implies they will kill you or themselves if you leave - having the conversation early in the relationship about how, if it doesn't work out, you will respectfully go your separate ways is really important), jobs (never sign a contract with a non-compete clause that would ruin you or prevent you from earning a living wage), etc.\n\nThe only thing in your life that (I would argue) shouldn't have an emergency exit is your relationship with your kids. As they grow, they obviously need to become independent, and Once they reach adulthood, they need to be able to pull away from you entirely if they choose to - but you need to be there as a safe and stable base for them if you possibly can be.\n\nEdit: RIP my inbox!

Some look like new owners with new puppies.\n\nNot everyone likes dogs. Some are allergic. Some are deathly scared. Dogs can also react to sudden unexpected movements in surprising ways.

For everyone's safety, including your and other dogs.\n\nEdit: lots of great comments below. Some awful stories about off leash dogs.

Your dog is more predictable to you but you have no idea how other dogs or people will react. With a leash you can get them out of any dangerous situation.\n\nA leash is not a replacement for training or socialization, it's more like a safety. Train and socialize your dog. And that never stops. If your dog can't walk on a loose leash it's because it wasn't trained to do so.\n\nExercise for high energy breeds. There's a reason high energy breeds are only recommended for people with high energy lifestyle people. Use 30ft or 50ft leads to train recall. Train your dog to run along side you. Go out to remote hiking trails. Running around in your local public park isn't nearly enough.\n\nAnd retractable leashes are terrible. They teach the dog to pull, and you can get some nasty injuries if they get caught in your dog or your leg.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/gp1gnv/lpt_keep_your_dog_leashed_in_public_at_all_times/", "created_utc": 1590222545.0, "score": 37901, "author": "jucromesti", "num_comments": 3478, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/gp1gnv/lpt_keep_your_dog_leashed_in_public_at_all_times/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

A vegan diet is an easy adjustment, you monster.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe thing is, it doesn't matter how objectively awesome and beneficial a thing is, everyone has limited pools of time, money, interest, and willpower. It's great that you bike to work, champ! But try to remember it's not just \"10 minutes on a bike\" it's\n\n* Getting a good bike and a place to store it\n* Having good gear\n* Learning the rules and regulations involved in using it in your area\n* Having the energy to get up early enough for the extra time to prepare for a bike trip\n* Having a shower or place to change at work (and having to actually change at work)\n* Having a place to keep your bike\n* Having to take the bike home no matter how late in the day, how the weather has changed in that time, or how exhausted and awful work was that day.\n\nBasically, people vastly oversimplify what THEY like or do because the downsides either don't matter to them or they forgot they existed due to their lifestyle. As another example, I saw a former marine judging people for being \"lazy\" because they didn't regularly exercise. Meanwhile, I know people who are struggling to have enough energy to cook dinner instead of microwave foods at the end of the day due to kids, physical issues, emotional issues (depression for example). And what if someone just hates exercise while you personally don't mind that much (or love it) ? Doing a thing is much easier when you naturally enjoy it (or had some kind of life event that let you overcome your dislike or motivated you more than average to overcome it).\n\nThe point is that something that you can easily slot into YOUR lifestyle may not work so easily for someone else. Don't judge someone who's struggling with crippling debt and money management for not being charitable like you. Don't look down on someone who has computer trouble just because you like computers and it's easy for you to learn the ins and outs of computer security.

It creates an akward pause at a time when you really just want to get on with the show and will ultimately end up with you getting a piping hot beverage which you have no chance of finishing during a 20 minute interview, where you do most of the talking. So what happens instead is that you burn your hands and mouth and leave most of the cup behind for them to clean up after you leave.\n\nWater is a different story however! you \\*do\\* want to get a glas (or bottle) of water as it will generally be much faster for them to handle (it will most likely already be in the room) and it has a few practical uses during a job interview: water will refresh you, immediately clear up a dry mouth and give you a natural excuse to take a sip and win a few extra seconds to think about a difficult question.\n\nYou came here for a job, not a free dink.

Most of what you produce you don\u2019t see (surplus labor value) and the good job you do; It\u2019s not uncommon to see that just taken credit for by people above you - so don\u2019t be exploited.

{"title": "LPT: Beware - Peak hunting time for work bullies is when you are starting a new job. Naturally on day 1 you won't be as good as your colleagues or as you were in the last job and they will exploit this vulnerability to target your confidence.

Work bullies might prey in these initial weeks. They will try to tarnish your image in the team and destroy your self-esteem to enable them in exploiting you. It is also more common for senior co-workers who exploit their positions of power to show such behavior.\n\nHow to tackle this:\n\n1. Best way is to show confidence when you are sensing such a behavior. DO NOT APOLOGIZE unnecessarily. Instead try saying \"Oh so this is how it's done, no one told me this. Thanks for highlighting it, is there anything I should keep in mind?\n2. Ask questions from start, be vocal. Do not let the bully think they can talk over you and shut you down.\n3. These are hard things to do, some bullies are too manipulative and will corner you down. Seek mentors/colleagues at work who believe in you and build you up.\n\nIf you are someone actively being bullied:-\n\n1. I am so sorry you are going through this. It is really hard when someone exploits you at your weakest.\n2. Seek out your friends and tell them what is happening and how you feel. Sharing helps.\n3. You might have to work on building your confidence for long term, but the best immediate option is to start over or a new job. Such toxic work cultures are not worth your time. If you are still stuck there and cannot because of monetary or other reasons, remember to remind yourself of your achievements and how far you have come, do not let these bullies make a dent on your self-worth, because that's what they prey upon.\n\nThere are people out there who are proud of you seek them. But the proudest has to be you :)\n\n**Edit1**. I see a lot of people commenting how this is a school thing and are surprised by the term work bully. I know bullying is a big topic in schools in USA, but anyone can turn into a bully. It's the sudden access to a position of power that makes them a bully and corrupts their basic decision making skills. **Example**: A Supreme leader of a country in asia, just cause he is a president he believes that whatever thought that comes to his mind is truth by the god, but anyone can be a president(at least a lot of people) it does not make you special, or messiah of god himself and you should not exploit this position of power. I hope these insights helps you in understand this issue better.\n\n**Edit2**. I also want to highlight if you feel baffled on how this still happens, maybe you are part of privileged group where people respect you just cause you look a certain way or are from a certain gender(Hint: most of the industries are male dominated with gender biases). Not everyone is blessed with a safe upbringing where they build up a rock solid confidence and have an amazing support structure.

I'm sure there are more.\n\nDesktop:\n\n* Right-click an image & select \"Search Google for this image\" (maybe this only words in certain browsers, not entirely sure)\n\n* Or you can use [images.google.com](http://www.images.google.com) & click the camera icon to upload a pic or paste the URL of the image\n\n\nMobile:\n\n* Use Chrome and hold down on an image & select \"Search Google for This Image\"\n* Use the Google app & open Google Lens\n* Use [tineye.com](http://www.tineye.com)\n\n---\n\nEdit 2: Added the current prices for that lamp since prices will change in the future.\n\nAlso a couple more notes:\n\n* Some commenters let me know this practice is called \"white labeling.\" I'm assuming it's legal because the suppliers agree for Wayfair to do it when they agree to sell on Wayfair.\n\n* This doesn't always work; sometimes Wayfair has it cheapest. So you can also try this tip the opposite way if you're about to buy something at Target/Home Depot/Macy's/etc, you can reverse image search to see if Wayfair has it cheaper under a fake name.\n\n* Wayfair creates their own photos/renderings sometimes, so you may need to try a few photos.\n\n* Since Wayfair, Joss & Main, AllModern, & Birch Lane are all owned by the same company, they often offer the same product on multiple sites with different prices. Sometimes the names are the same, sometimes different. So be sure to check their other sites too before purchasing.\n\n    For example, this 5' x 8' rug is on all four sister sites:\n\n    *  Wayfair: [Handmad Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug by Wade Logan](https://www.wayfair.com/rugs/pdp/wade-logan-handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-w002904453.html?piid=836378768)  - $143.99\n    * Joss & Main: [Handmade Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug](https://www.jossandmain.com/rugs/pdp/handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-wdln2358.html?piid=23573723) - $158.39\n    * Birch Lane: [Handmade Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug](https://www.birchlane.com/rugs/pdp/handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-wdln2358.html?piid=23573723) - $144\n    * AllModern: [Walmsley Gray Area Rug](https://www.allmodern.com/rugs/pdp/walmsley-gray-area-rug-a000204971.html?piid=2002933957) - $150\n\n    So you may think you're getting the best deal at Wayfair, but reverse image search helps you find that it's really called the \"Lefebvre\" rug made by a company called \"nuLOOM\" & you can easily find out it's sold at [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/nuLOOM-Lefebvre-Casual-Braided-Salt-Pepper-5-ft-x-8-ft-Indoor-Outdoor-Area-Rug-HJFV01C-508/206984584), [Target](https://www.target.com/p/braided-lefebvre-rug-nuloom/-/A-51692002?preselect=51529119#lnk=sametab), [Kohl's](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2851085/nuloom-festival-lefebvre-terra-solid-rug.jsp?skuid=63960126), [Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/pd/nuLOOM-Salt-and-Pepper-Indoor-Outdoor-Coastal-Area-Rug-Common-5-x-8-Actual-5-ft-W-x-8-ft-L/1001110766), [JCPenney](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/nuloom-braided-lefebvre-salt-and-pepper-rug/ppr5007334058), [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/nuloom-festival-braided-lefebvre-area-rug?ID=10572683), & [Bed Bath & Beyond](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/nuloom-festival-lefebvre-braided-rug-in-black-white/3321002?skuId=77145577) for anywhere from $111.92 (Home Depot) to $367.20 (Macy's) - in which case you'd obviously go with Home Depot.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/g9szg9/lpt_reverse_image_search_before_purchasing_from/", "created_utc": 1588099676.0, "score": 37440, "author": "refusestopoop", "num_comments": 1141, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/g9szg9/lpt_reverse_image_search_before_purchasing_from/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Let me be clear, you should call 911 for their advice and on which hospital you should go to, and if the person can't walk, obviously they need an ambulance.  But in my specific case, my parents live in the country so we would have been waiting AT LEAST 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, precious time to assess and load my dad into the ambulance, and then drive back into the city. In my case, it made sense to just load up and go, but we probably should have had 911 on the line while we were driving.\n\n-----\n\nAdditional symptoms:\n\n\nSudden Numbness\n\nSudden Confusion\n\nSudden Trouble-Seeing\n\nSudden Trouble-Walking\n\nSudden Severe Headache\n\n-----\n\nPrologue:  I worked at a hospital that is a stroke center from 2010-2014 as a grunt.  Dad is a retired doctor.\n\nI went to my parent's early on Christmas Eve 2020, was helping dad put heavy stuff in the attic.  Afterward, he said he needed to vacuum but could not say the word \"vacuum\", and then said \"am I having a stroke?\"   I thought, \"fuck\".  Then he said vacuum, and walked to his bedroom, and I hoped it was just a brain fart and he was fine.  Nope, he comes into living room and sits down in chair, and he can't speak.  At all.  He points to his mouth. No facial drooping.  I later learned he meant he was drooling.  I thought, \"fuck, fuck, fuck\".  I knew he was having a stroke.  Mom walked by, I said \"dad is having a stroke\".  She said \"no no no,\", and gave him an aspirin.  I said we can't wait,  we gotta go to the hospital now.  Got dad into the car and had mom drive to the stroke hospital I used to work at, in about 30ish minutes from onset of stroke.  They gave him the TPA protocal.  They said he most likely had the stroke due to him being in Atrial Fibrillation, which fired off a clot to his head.  He went up to the ICU that night, Christmas Eve.  He was able to speak that night.  The next day, Christmas Day, even better.  He was released on 12.26.20, able to speak very understandably with only a slight defect that should go away, because the neurologist said he should recover fully.    \n    \n\nIf they can walk, don't wait on an ambulance, throw them in a vehicle and get them to a major hospital ASAP.  It would probably have been at least an hour longer wait if we had waited on an ambulance.  Ideally, know what your local medical facilities are known for (heart, stroke/neurological, children, etc) and where they are so you can make an educated choice about which you should drive to.\n\n-----\n\nEDIT 1:  Woke up so grateful to see that many people are seeing this info.  My dad told me once he was able, \"you saved my ass\", so hopefully this info will allow you save someone else's ass.    \n\nEDIT 2:  Per u/SquiddlyGiggly, giving aspirin is a no-no because it can make the stroke worse.  Good to know, I'll pass that info along.  I think my mom gave him aspirin because my dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64 and she probably thought he might be having a heart attack and just couldn't speak due to being out of breath.  Which leads me to...    \n\nEDIT 3:  My dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64.  He said his blood pressure has been fine even without medications, so he stopped taking his medications for his heart awhile ago.  And apparently he was right about not having heart blockages or high blood pressure, but those aren't the only heart worries it seems.  I thought he was still getting checkups, but I learned after this that he has been refusing to go see his doctor.  If he had, perhaps they would have caught the Atrial Fibrillation (A Fib) and treated it before this happened.  My mom thinks this was a blessing because hopefully it will be a wake up call for him to take ongoing checkups seriously.    \n    \n\nSo one more thing to add to this LifeProTip, show your family members this story and the importance of getting checked out and addressing issues before they become worse.  Dad said another stroke patient came in while he was there, and the guy was basically a vegetable.  Remind family that they may be ready to die, but are they ready to live with permanent handicaps like not being able to speak or use half their body.    \n\nEDIT 4:  I just remembered a stroke patient I had when I worked at the hospital.  Guy was late 40s, maybe early 50s, looked like he was in great shape (thin body type) and like he worked a manual job.  He was laying there with his eyes closed and not able to speak, just grunt.  I \"think\" that was his 2nd or 3rd stroke, progressively getting worse I think.  Anyway, my point is, do not judge their age or outer appearance as to whether they can have a stroke.    \n\n-----\n\nEDIT 5:  Credit to u/RetardedinRetrospect for linking this video that shows a Stroke as it happens:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kgmqPahsSE&feature=youtu.be    \n\nAlso, an informative TEDtalk on the subject:    \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYD7Y9CXeUw", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kkyl76/lpt_know_the_signs_of_stroke_my_dad_had_stroke_on/", "created_utc": 1609049384.0, "score": 36856, "author": "MinMaxRex", "num_comments": 1040, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/kkyl76/lpt_know_the_signs_of_stroke_my_dad_had_stroke_on/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

God help anyone who gave him any homophobic crap because they probably can't talk.\n\nThe trades represent a different kind of economic power, and a lot of respect.

So just call them from time to time, weeks and even months after the fact. Show you think about them, don't make them call you out of despair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: before I go to bed, I just want to clarify a couple of things that induce misunderstandings that keep coming to my mailbox:\n\nThis is not a rant. I do not resent people that did the things I listed. As I stated in my first paragraph, I experienced the effect they had on me, I think I have learned things from this, I would like to share. I thought I was clear about this, but every support message I got was comforting. Some were just much more useful than others. \n\nThe \"Do not, in any case\" intro is clearly horribly worded. Yes. My bad. What I mean is, when you say something so vague, it doesn't have any more effect than a simple \"sorry for your loss\". If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.\n\nThe FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how \"anything\" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere. Starting from something completely reasonable, finishing with something I thought everybody would consider unreasonable in this context. Three of these five examples are completely made up.

Gambling addiction is a serious issue that doesn't garner as much attention as it should. Many addicts wear adult diapers or pull ups so they can continue to play without needing to get up to go to the bathroom. Their addictions are so severe that they are willing to put themselves through what most of us would consider one of our worst nightmares. The workers at the Casino are not even allowed to confront someone defecating right in front of them (at least not where I worked).\n\nSometimes, If you take a good look at the stain, it becomes obvious that it is human waste. There will be two butt cheek marks on the chair with the waste forming around where the person was sitting. There will also be a stain right up the middle of the butt cheeks.\n\nThis is an issue in the poker room because they use regular non leather office chairs in these areas. Typically, slot machine chairs are protected with a material that repels liquids. This is because the chairs are attached to the machines and can't be removed. I worked for a few months as a custodian at a Casino and one of my daily tasks was pulling 5-10 stained chairs from the Poker floor  and using a carpet extractor with a handheld extracting attachment to remove the waste from the chairs. We then dried them out over night and returned them the next day to replace newly stained chairs. The Casino I worked at is a lower populated area. If it happened at my Casino, it happens at yours...\n\nUpdate: apparently not an issue at all casinos. Maybe just lower income areas?

List.\n\nNow it's [non-denominational winter holiday] and while everyone else is scrambling for a present, I can rest easy because I can just consult the list and get everyone something that they will both love and never see coming.\n\nI've learned that the real power of the list comes after it has accumulated entries. Once this happens you can combine gift ideas in a way that the other person could never expect. While going through an art mueseum 8 months ago with my (now ex) girlfriend, she casually mentions that she really likes this painting. I look at the title and author, take a picture, and add it to the list. She also really likes jigsaw puzzles. Once I noticed that I added it to the list. For her last birthday I was looking through the list to see if I could think of anything and I decided to get her a custom jigsaw puzzle of this one painting that she loved and has since never seen again. She was stoked when she opened it and it's been her favorite puzzle since (even after the breakup).\n\nI went from being a terrible gift giver to being incredible at it. People are genuinely excited to recoece a gift from me now.

Like, so hot that even being clothesless with three fans pointed at you on max doesn\u2019t help. Without AC, these days or nights are so brutal... So some might take a cold shower, go for a drive, or put a cold damp cloth on their forehead.\n\nI want to share with you what my mom did for me during super hot summer nights when I was a kid. It\u2019s a freaking miracle and a lifesaver. Best of all it's cheap, easy, and fast.\n\n1. Grab a large towel (preferably a bath towel \u2014 like the big ones you use for your body after showering, or one that covers\u00a0*at least*\u00a0half your body).\n2. Turn on shower to max cold water (can be done in a large sink, it\u2019s just easier using the shower).\n3. Fully wet the entire towel. Make sure to hold it for a bit so the cold water soaks into the fibres well. Fingers might get a bit cold here but it\u2019s worth it.\n4. Turn off shower.\n5. Wring out towel until it\u2019s not dripping anymore. Don\u2019t wring too much though, it should be wetter than damp.\n6. Lay in your bed, and slowly drape the towel over you like you would a blanket. It\u2019ll feel shocking at first, like going into a cold lake, but it\u2019s over quick.\n\nThat\u2019s it. The wet towel is now your blanket for the night. Take some deep breaths and enjoy that sweet, sweet relief. Sleep tight\u00a0\u2661\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n* This only works if it\u2019s\u00a0*so brutally hot*\u00a0that you can barely sleep and are starting to question your sanity \u2014 not just a little hot. Otherwise it\u2019s just an unpleasant, clammy mess.\n* Sleep in just your bra/underwear, or clothesless\u2014 not in pyjamas.\n* Keep your normal blankets within reach on your bed. This works so well that you might actually get too cold during the night and need to grab or switch to a normal blanket.\n* Don't keep any fans pointing directly at you on max, it'll dry out the towel faster. Keep the fan on a lower setting. Air circulation is good though.\n* If you need to do this often, put a waterproof layer between your mattress and your fitted sheet. Don\u2019t want mold growing in your mattress. Anything from a tarp to a waterproof mattress protector works. If done only a few times the whole summer, then don\u2019t worry about it.\n* Try to keep the towel on you as much as possible \u2014 not draped on your bed \u2014 if you don't have that waterproof layer. It\u2019ll work better, and again we don\u2019t want that mold.\n* Put a dry bath towel under you while you sleep if you prefer, I just don't like the scratchiness of laying on a dry towel.\n* Depending on how insanely hot it is, you might need to re-wet the towel again in the middle of the night.\n* I learned recently that this is apparently called the \"*Egyptian Method*\" of sleeping.\n\nSleep well beautiful soul \u2661", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1kergu6/lpt_if_its_so_hot_you_cant_sleep_use_a_cold_wet/", "created_utc": 1746385180.0, "score": 0, "author": "alannah214", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/1kergu6/lpt_if_its_so_hot_you_cant_sleep_use_a_cold_wet/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "LPT Request: How do I get through 12 hour shifts at my assembly line job, when finding other work seems impossible?", "selftext": "I work 12 hour shifts on an assembly line, and getting through the shifts is brutal. Most of the common suggestions don't work in my case. I can't talk to anyone there as nobody is talkative; many of them don't want to speak at all, regardless of language or experiences or anything. There's often a 3-hour period where not a word of conversation is uttered by anyone on the entire factory floor (including two assembly lines and a testing area). There were only two people who wanted to hold a conversation there, and they both quit two weeks ago.\n\nWe're highly micromanaged and don't get to choose our own break times or spots to sit in, we can't have any food on the factory floor (no snacks) or even refill water/coffee/tea until our breaktimes. We can take bathroom breaks if they're short, but other than that we are not allowed to move from our stations until the end of the night.\n\nWe can't look at our phones during the shift except on breaks, wear headphones or earbuds, or play music through our phone speakers. Bringing a portable radio *might* be possible (I'll ask next week).\n\nThe most I can do is choose whether I stand or sit (although most of the work requires sitting), push my chair from one side of my table to the other, sip water (has to last me 3 hours per refill, so slowly), and go to the bathroom.\n\nTo top it all off, the work comes at an agonizing pace that is too slow to get into a flow and too fast to zone out and take mental breaks. Generally, I'll get something that takes 15 seconds to do every 30 seconds. Also if one of the production lines finishes their daily quota before the day's out, there is an endless supply of \"prepwork\" and other busywork to keep us occupied as the manager does not want anyone to be \"idling\". So even if we finish our work early, there's endless fake work waiting. Last week I spent an hour manually checking parts that I had already confirmed were good before, they just handed me a box of 500 pieces that had already been checked and I checked it again.\n\nI'm seriously at my wit's end here. This job is crushing my soul. I don't even have the energy to apply to anything else on my off days because I'm so burnt out.\n\nThis isn't even mentioning the physical issues; my feet are soaking in their own sweat in my steeltoes which causes a ton of skin issues despite trying to wear moisture-wicking socks, and I don't have enough room to even wiggle my toes which gets oppressive. My shoulders are killing me from repetitive strain, and I have to spend half of both my breaks going to the very back of the building (by the loading docks) where my locker is to get some hand lotion so my skin stops cracking. We have to wear these cheap ESD straps that need to be pulled so tight they dig in and irritate. The air in there is full of dust that makes my nose just that little bit irritated, and because there's irritants used in the production process it's very hard to get the chance to scratch your face or anything.\n\nThe management/supervision is also nasty. Not a big deal, but when there's already so many annoyances going on, it starts to upset me.\n\nAny help? I'm seriously dying out here. I've been here a few weeks already, seen all the good conversationalists quit, but I have nowhere to go back to other than this (coming from a highly abusive home environment in a city where rent is prohibitively high). I don't see myself getting used to this at all; the tedium and discomfort is *killing me.* The pay here isn't even that good (1.3x minimum wage) but the job market is so bad right now there's not anything else I can do. I have an associates and a bachelors, both in STEM, and have sent over 350 applications out just since mid-November yet have gotten nothing. I've hired private career coaches and used my university's career services, gone to job fairs and networking events, reached out to everyone I know in industry, and there's just nothing. The market is bone dry unless you're an experienced professional wanting to work for below-newcomer rates - like literally taking what new grads are historically supposed to make, slashing it by 20%, and then only accepting people whose experience should be earning them double that.\n\nAny advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1k7rx5h/lpt_request_how_do_i_get_through_12_hour_shifts/", "created_utc": 1745605104.0, "score": 938, "author": "RealZiobbe", "num_comments": 273, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/1k7rx5h/lpt_request_how_do_i_get_through_12_hour_shifts/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "LPT: It's fledgling season! Here are a few tips in case you come across a baby bird on the ground.", "selftext": "Ecologist here! It's that time of year again when the ground is covered in baby birds, some should be there and some should not. So here are a few tips so you know when to intervene and when to leave them alone.\n\nIf you find a baby bird on the ground the first thing to do is check for injuries. Baby birds can look pretty weak, but if you don't see any blood or obvious damage then it's fine. If it is injured do not try to take it home and nurse it back to health, birds require specific diets and handling and even most of them don't make it when cared for by their parents let alone an unequipped human. Please call a wildlife rehabber.\n\nThe second thing to check for is age:\n\nIf it hasn't opened its eyes yet and is mostly pink and featherless it's a hatchling (0-3 days old). Hatchlings should not be out of the nest. If you see a hatchling and the nest it fell out of you can try to put it back in (that old wive's tale about birds not taking care of chicks touched by humans is false). If you can't see the nest you can make your own out of a small container lined with soft material then attach it to a tree or bush as high as you can. If it looks like the parents are not caring for it after an hour or so call a local wildlife rehabber to come get the hatchling. If the bird is invasive, a starling or house sparrow for example (invasive in the Americas and other parts of the world, they are native to Europe and important parts of ecosystems in their native range), a lot of rehabbers euthenize them.\n\nIf its eyes are open and it's got a few spikey (pin) feathers it's a nestling (3-13 days old) and also not ready to leave the nest. Please adhere to the advice above about hatchlings.\n\nIf its eyes are open and its fully feathered, hopping around, maybe a little fluffy, short tail, its a fledgling (13+ days old). Leave these cuties alone! They are working on flying and probably exhausted and in need of rest before they take off again. Their parents are around, even if you cannot locate them, and are feeding this little guy or gal. No need to call anyone or do anything unless it is injured. If it is in the street and might get hit by a car you can herd them to the side of the road or under a bush. The parents will find it.\n\nI know everyone means well and it's hard to look at a baby bird and not want to do anything. But you only need to worry about the hatchlings and nestlings or an injured fledgling.\n\nQuick Note - Some birds are ground nesters so they will be on the ground no matter what, but the chances of you finding a ground nesting bird is not very high. If you're in the U.S. Killdeer, ovenbirds, bobolinks, swans, ducks, geese, etc. all nest on the ground and their chicks will be there in all their forms. Shorebirds also nest on the ground, so if you're at the beach you'll see plover, sanderlings, and other wading birds. This post is really for folks finding non-ground nesting birds in urban and suburban areas.\n\nIf you have an outdoor cat or dog, please stop trying to change the wild bird behavior. Take your pet, which is an invasive species, into your home until the bird leaves the area. Monitor your dog or cat while outside, keep them in if you can't supervise while chicks are out. It's only a few weeks you have to pay attention.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1k6fhwi/lpt_its_fledgling_season_here_are_a_few_tips_in/", "created_utc": 1745456245.0, "score": 2532, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "num_comments": 55, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/1k6fhwi/lpt_its_fledgling_season_here_are_a_few_tips_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "LPT \"Driving\" on virtual calls is a good skill to have to get noticed and become part of higher level meetings in an office job setting.", "selftext": "If you're in an office job, there may be times when there is live collaboration over a zoom/teams call: Talking about changes to a presentation and editing it live, working on a shared document, brainstorming ideas, testing new code. In these settings, being the \"driver\" (the person who shares their screen and often makes edits offered by the other callers) can be a great way to facilitate the meeting in a way that's noticed and sought out by management. Often managers have split attention and little time to work on things directly so being able to help realize their vision live on a call is very valuable. \n\nTo be a good driver you should:\n\n-Be fast. Learn as many shortcuts, hot keys, formulas and \"hacks\" for the relevant softwares that you use. There's a point where if you cannot drive as fast as the meeting moves, the meeting becomes inefficient and it's better to just schedule a follow-up and do the work off the call. This is fine, but the skill is being able to drive fast enough that you can finalize a lot in one meeting with managers who are hard to pin down for working sessions. Even if you're good at PowerPoint, excel, coding, writing, drawing; doing it quickly can be a different skill altogether.\n\n-Prioritize the \"version 1\". When ideas are being thrown around it's better to just create rough versions and leave polish for when you are working on it independently. The most important thing to do on a call, especially with managers, is understand what they're looking for, give them a rough draft, confirm that you understood them, and then come back later with a finished product.\n\n-Learn driving language. \"So we're good with this part as is?\", \"What do we think about this?\", \"What I'm hearing is that you want me to ___, is that right?\", \"I can fix the formatting off the call, but is this basically what we're looking for?\". You want to encourage feedback, but also gently encourage participants to confirm verbally their approval as you go. If they don't like it, get them to say what and why.\n\n-Do as much pre work as you can. If you have multiple versions or a rough outline ready to go ahead of time, editing live becomes easier.\n\n-When no editing or document is involved, good driving can just be taking good notes that you can distribute after a call. Many times I share screen with my notes just so people on the call have something to look at. Managers who spend lots of time in meetings appreciate notes like these and will often clarify their own thoughts more when they see them written out. Emphasize action items if there are any and who is responsible for each one.\n\n-A second screen is important as a driver if there are things you want to do that you don't want to show up on your shared screen. \n\nIf you are a good driver you may find yourself getting invited onto calls with bosses above your direct boss. Boomers especially love having someone just create what they say verbally. It lets them work as fast as they can think which they might not be able to do on their own. You also get to be a part of more of the idea generation process and offer your own insights where appropriate. \n\nA lot of this advice is geared towards project based work, but any job that has collaborative virtual calls can benefit from a skilled driver.\n\nETA: \"Driving\" is what people in my office call being the person to share their screen. Probably goes by other names elsewhere, but when we pass the screen share off some one will usually say something to the effect \"I'll start driving\".\n\nPeople made the excellent point that being the driver can be a slippery slope to getting pigeon holed into admin work or note taking. I'll just say there are different levels of driving in my mind:\n\n1. Taking dictation: You are simply there to type out or draft the ideas of the other call participants. You are not given the opportunity to contribute and therefore your involvement is literally the key strokes on the screen. This is bad, and you don't want to get stuck in this especially if your job description does not specifically call for it. If you fill this role you might want to create a boundary that this is outside your scope of work or it should at least not fall solely on your shoulders.\n\n2. Facilitating: You are interpreting ideas, creating consensus and encouraging feedback from the most important stakeholders. Here you are not only taking in ideas from participants but also offering your own perspective. The keystrokes and drafting are more incidental to taking an active role in the call and this is a synthesis of soft social skills and being proficient in software to create work product live. \n\n3. Leading: This is what a driver further into their career will do. You are the one ideating and distributing action items and defining requirements. Where the driving skillset is still relevant is in soliciting questions, creating mock ups that subordinates can use as starting points to create finished work, and fostering a collaborative environment. You can also model how to drive a collaborative call and maybe foster the skills in others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1k45b8j/lpt_driving_on_virtual_calls_is_a_good_skill_to/", "created_utc": 1745210581.0, "score": 5479, "author": "seansman15", "num_comments": 133, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/1k45b8j/lpt_driving_on_virtual_calls_is_a_good_skill_to/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Don't do this.\n\nBefore you leave an angry reply to someone, click on their name and look at their post history to see if it is worth your time.\n\nA bot will often post the same thing across multiple subreddits, you'll notice they do it at all hours regularly 24/7 (EG look for times when most people would be sleeping/or look to see if they don't seem to take breaks etc).\n\nAnother sign of a bot is someone who 2/3 years ago had a very normal account, took a break and now only posts political comments. One account I've seen started 3 years ago, the person was really into knitting, didn't post for 2 years and now spam posts maga nonsense at all times of the day and night. This is often when someone has bought/hacked or taken over an old genuine account.\n\nLook at the username - is it Randomly_generated88 (could well be a bot or a sock puppet account).\n\nHow old is the account? Was it created last week? Less likely to be a genuine person, more likely to be a bot or troll/sock puppet.\n\nWhat's their karma? -100 is a troll, ignore them.\n\nLook at their post history - is it literally all the same edgy troll comments, history of only posting politics? It'sikely a bot or a troll.\n\nLook at their language. Lotta bots on reddit Ireland stating they are Irish but then use American spellings and American phrases not used here - EG we spell criticise with an S. They also post at times when most of the country will be in bed. \n\nOn their own these signs might not mean it's a bot but if you see several it may well be.

{"title": "LPT-Be okay with missing out", "selftext": "Nowadays, a lot of people feel pressured to have the same lifestyle and opportunities as their peers on social media or in their environment. The media have glamorized certain lifestyles, and some individuals have been led to believe that they should have many friends, date frequently in college, or own a big house by their 30s. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and societal expectations about what one should accomplish by a certain age can lead to anxiety and guilt. Additionally, we may not be prepared or ready to undertake certain tasks at that time. Many people who marry young have a higher chance of divorce. Regret is a natural part of life, even for those you perceive to have it all, if you get close to them.\n\nThe truth is that we all have different life experiences, and everyone will miss out on something. It\u2019s more important to focus on your individual goals at a pace that suits you than to rush. You can always revisit things you haven\u2019t experienced before, and sometimes those experiences can be even better. Life becomes easier when you focus on your own individual goals and experiences rather than trying to meet every milestone or invisible expectation. You should accept that you\u2019ll miss out on something and start building your own experiences in the present. Do what fits you personally, and stop trying to copy your peers or beating yourself up for not achieving milestones by a specific age.

{"title": "LPT: The Art of Serving: How to Nail the Job Without Annoying the Customers\u201d", "selftext": "This is the thoughts that I\u2019ve come up from my experience from being a server bartender in my early days. \n\nBeing a good server isn\u2019t rocket science, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the way some people mess it up. It\u2019s not about memorizing the specials or balancing eight plates on one art, it\u2019s about knowing how to read people and not being annoying.\n\nFirst off, listen. Really listen. If someone says they have a food allergy, don\u2019t just nod while you\u2019re already thinking about the next table. You don\u2019t want to be the reason someone\u2019s night ends with a trip to the ER. And while you\u2019re at it, keep the talking to a minimum. Customers came to eat, not hear your life story. Unless they ask, and even then, keep it under a minute.\n\nTiming is everything. Don\u2019t hover like a nervous parent at prom, but don\u2019t disappear like a deadbeat dad either. If they\u2019re mid-bite, maybe wait to ask how everything tastes. Let them chew first. And read the table, if they\u2019re laughing and relaxed, you can lighten up. If they look like they just survived a funeral, maybe skip the joke about the two-for-one margaritas.\n\nHumor\u2019s a tool, not a weapon. A quick line about the size of the dessert or how the drink could fuel a lawnmower? Great. But if it doesn\u2019t land, just smile and back away. Don\u2019t double down, that\u2019s how you end up on Yelp. And when you ask questions, make them count. \u201cHow\u2019s the food?\u201d is lazy. Try, \u201cWas the steak cooked how you like it?\u201d or \u201cWould you like another round?\u201d It makes people feel like you actually care, even if you don\u2019t.\n\nAnd watch the body language. If they\u2019re closing their menus and making eye contact, they\u2019re ready to order. If they\u2019re scrolling on their phones, they\u2019re either not ready or avoiding each other. Either way, don\u2019t push it.\n\nBottom line? Make them feel taken care of without making them feel suffocated. If they leave full and not annoyed, you\u2019ve done your job. And if they tip well? That\u2019s just gravy.\n\nKeep in mind if you are down voting this? You might not have what it takes to be a server?

For example, \u201cTell me about yourself\u201d, \u201cwhy are you the best candidate for this position?\u201d, \u201cDo you have any questions for us?\u201d\n\nFinally, have a strong closing statement on why you should be hired. And ask for the job !\n\nKeep practicing and recording yourself until you feel good about your answers. Good luck on the job market !\n\nEdit: I think there might be some confusion based on some initial replies. I am not suggesting that you memorize potential answers, but to keep practicing common questions and record yourself until you are able to answer a typical interview question in a concise, thoughtful and structured way. Once you are able to structure your answers in an effective way, you can apply it to most questions that come your way in a natural manner. Your answers should be concise and structured. \nFor example, for situational questions like \u201cTell me about a time when\u2026\u201d, it is most effective to use the STAR method.\nS: Explain the Situation\nT: talk about the Task or problem\nA: describe the Actions you took to address the problem\nR: Explain the positive Results you were able to achieve\n\nSource: Experience as a hiring manager.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1j6jklq/lpt_when_preparing_for_a_job_interview_record/", "created_utc": 1741447888.0, "score": 249, "author": "hasen2016", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/1j6jklq/lpt_when_preparing_for_a_job_interview_record/", "html_title": ""}

The answer is: \"Don't worry about it; a 'convenience fee.'\" If you consider how many people live in my building not knowing this, and then every building in the rental network, it adds up quite a bit of money that goes absolutely no one knows where, except of course them fellas receiving the fees. \n\n\nBut there is a way entirely around it, and some $300 that we had to pay living here so far did not have to be paid. \n\n\n**On the website where rent is paid, there is a way to select payment; if you make payments directly from your bank account, the fee is either substantially reduced or completely removed.** A realistic guess as to why is that they like having your bank info more than your card info; companies love private data. \n\n\nAnyhow, I tested it: it worked exactly like the card, only without the convenience fee.

This is going to remove any and all old marker and markings. It may take some elbow grease and a whole lot of paper towels, but it will get you back to a clean board.\n\n2. Get a damp towel and wipe up all the toothpaste residue. Make sure you do it really thoroughly and get everything off! After wiping everything up, leave the board and let it air dry for about 30 minutes to make sure its truly dry. \n\n3. Get some WD-40 and spray it all over the board (or wherever the finish is ruined and you cleaned off with toothpaste). Get some paper towels and spread it around the board, evenly distributing on the area. Then, leave the board alone for another 30 minutes, up to 3 hours. This is going to fill in those \"empty\" pores I mentioned earlier and help restore the finish. \n\n4. After 30min - 3hrs, take more paper towels and start wiping up the excess WD-40. This again, is going to take up a lot of paper towels. Keep doing this until you no longer see WD-40 on the paper towels.\n\n5. Stand back and admire your hard work and useable whiteboard! \n\nGoing forward, especially if your board is really old or used/wiped a lot, you may have to repeat this every 6months - 1 year. I did mine a few months ago, and is still erasing normally so I don't for see having to do it again soon. \n\nI recommend staying away from abrasive cleaners on your whiteboard. I see a lot of people using hand sanitizer or alcohol wipes on their board, and yes it works, but overtime the finish is going to get ruined a lot faster. If you have adhesive on it from tape or stickers, goo-gone is the only way to go (again no alcohol or acetone...acetone will quite literally melt the surface) Your best bet is going to be using the expo brand cleaner in the blue bottle...it works and is worth it. \n\nHope this helps!!

{"title": "LPT: If it\u2019s so hot you can\u2019t sleep, use a cold wet bath towel as a blanket", "selftext": "With summer coming up, I want to share this tip for super hot weather because I often hear how so many people sadly can\u2019t get a good night\u2019s sleep when it\u2019s unbearably hot. Like, so hot that even being clothesless with three fans pointed at you on max doesn\u2019t help. Without AC, these days or nights are so brutal... So some might take a cold shower, go for a drive, or put a cold damp cloth on their forehead.\n\nI want to share with you what my mom did for me during super hot summer nights when I was a kid. It\u2019s a freaking miracle and a lifesaver. Best of all it's cheap, easy, and fast.\n\n1. Grab a large towel (preferably a bath towel \u2014 like the big ones you use for your body after showering, or one that covers\u00a0*at least*\u00a0half your body).\n2. Turn on shower to max cold water (can be done in a large sink, it\u2019s just easier using the shower).\n3. Fully wet the entire towel. Make sure to hold it for a bit so the cold water soaks into the fibres well. Fingers might get a bit cold here but it\u2019s worth it.\n4. Turn off shower.\n5. Wring out towel until it\u2019s not dripping anymore. Don\u2019t wring too much though, it should be wetter than damp.\n6. Lay in your bed, and slowly drape the towel over you like you would a blanket. It\u2019ll feel shocking at first, like going into a cold lake, but it\u2019s over quick.\n\nThat\u2019s it. The wet towel is now your blanket for the night. Take some deep breaths and enjoy that sweet, sweet relief. Sleep tight\u00a0\u2661\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n\n* This only works if it\u2019s\u00a0*so brutally hot*\u00a0that you can barely sleep and are starting to question your sanity \u2014 not just a little hot. Otherwise it\u2019s just an unpleasant, clammy mess.\n* Sleep in just your bra/underwear, or clothesless\u2014 not in pyjamas.\n* Keep your normal blankets within reach on your bed. This works so well that you might actually get too cold during the night and need to grab or switch to a normal blanket.\n* Don't keep any fans pointing directly at you on max, it'll dry out the towel faster. Keep the fan on a lower setting. Air circulation is good though.\n* If you need to do this often, put a waterproof layer between your mattress and your fitted sheet. Don\u2019t want mold growing in your mattress. Anything from a tarp to a waterproof mattress protector works. If done only a few times the whole summer, then don\u2019t worry about it.\n* Try to keep the towel on you as much as possible \u2014 not draped on your bed \u2014 if you don't have that waterproof layer. It\u2019ll work better, and again we don\u2019t want that mold.\n* Put a dry bath towel under you while you sleep if you prefer, I just don't like the scratchiness of laying on a dry towel.\n* Depending on how insanely hot it is, you might need to re-wet the towel again in the middle of the night.\n* I learned recently that this is apparently called the \"*Egyptian Method*\" of sleeping.\n\nSleep well beautiful soul \u2661", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1kergu6/lpt_if_its_so_hot_you_cant_sleep_use_a_cold_wet/", "created_utc": 1746385180.0, "score": 0, "author": "alannah214", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/LifeProTips/comments/1kergu6/lpt_if_its_so_hot_you_cant_sleep_use_a_cold_wet/", "html_title": ""}
