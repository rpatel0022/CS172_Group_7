{"title": "Finally starting our bakery", "selftext": "After a combined 20 or so years in the baking industry my partner and I are finally in the position where we can open up the bakery we have spent years dreaming about!\n\nWe are called Flag Leaf Bakery. \n\nThe flag leaf is the final leaf to emerge on the cereal grain plant. Where the previous leaves have been responsible for gathering the energy from the sun to enable and promote vegetative growth, the flag leaf is responsible for gathering the majority of the energy used to develop the most noticeable and highly sought after part of the stalk, the head of wheat. In essence, turning the sun's energy into fats and sugars, either to be harvested to grow the next generation of plant, or in our case, to become food.\n\u200b\nThe story of the flag leaf, and the growth of a stalk of wheat in total, is a somewhat apt metaphor for the grain chain that anyone who has had a hand in the creation, sale, or consumption of a grain or grain product participates in.\n\u200b\nWith the understanding that the flag leaf is the last leaf on a stalk of wheat before the grain head, and a bakery is the last link on the grain chain before the consumer, it is important to remember that the flag leaf could not have gotten up there without the leaves before it gathering the energy for the plant to mature. In our case, we are being held up by the grain breeders, wheat farmers and flour millers that have allowed us to do the last bit of work to share the fruits of all our labors.\n\nIf you like photos and feel like following along as we work on opening a small bakery you can follow us on Instagram I'm on Instagram as flagleafbakery. Install the app to follow my photos and videos. https://www.instagram.com/invites/contact/?i=du0gbckvn0yr&utm_content=nktjmxa\n\nIf you live in southern New Hampshire swing by when we are doing a pop up at the actual shop or find us at a farmers market.

Weighing 150gr strands and shaping. Proofing for approx 1h30 (20-22\u00baC in my flat). 28 hours cold rest in the fridge (uncovered for the last 4 hours). I let them 1 hour at room temperature before boiling them with barley malt syrup (10 seconds on each side). I baked them on a perforated metallic pastry tray lined with parchment paper, in a 250\u00b0C static oven for approx 20 minutes (I poured hot water in a tray placed in the bottom of the oven, to create steam). \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how the dough improver makes the dough feel wetter and so much more workable (despite the drop in hydration).\n\nI think I improved my shaping too, the hole isn\u2019t massive like it used to. Better twist, better lock, thanks to the dough texture being less stiff/dense. \n\nThe crust and the crumb are perfect I am SO happy right now. The bagels are so good I can\u2019t believe I just made those. I think the dough improver made the crumb lighter while still being dense and chewy. I will not change a thing to this recipe, it\u2019s on point now !! \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1giwkwo", "created_utc": 1730666191.0, "score": 4140, "author": "Good-Ad-5320", "num_comments": 55, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1giwkwo/finally_achieved_the_perfect_bagels/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Finally able to deliver the honey butter roll recipe \ud83c\udf6f\ud83e\uddc8", "selftext": "I posted my honey butter rolls here a little over a month ago but didn\u2019t record the recipe as I made them. I promised I\u2019d come back with a recipe when I finally got it figured out. Life got in the way with health issues, hectic work schedule, etc so I took a break from baking but I did want to get this figured out in case anybody wanted to make these for the holidays. I am very very new to writing recipes so please forgive me for any issues with clarity, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions! I\u2019m sorry for the delay but I do hope somebody can enjoy this recipe as I have \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n\nDough ingredients:\n500g whole milk\n14g yeast\n115g egg (usually 2 extra large eggs will equal this)\n112g unsalted butter\n750g bread flour\n40g whole wheat flour\n16g salt\n80g honey\n\n\n\nHoney butter ingredients:\n170g salted butter\n80g honey\nSalt to taste (I add an extra 5-10g salt but that may be a lot for some)\n\n\n\nHoney butter:\n1. Microwave butter for about 30 seconds or until soft\n2. Stir butter\n3. Add honey and mix\n4. Microwave in 5second intervals and mix as much as needed to make the butter a smooth paste\n\n\n\nFor dough\n1. Warm up milk to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, don\u2019t make it too hot or it\u2019ll kill the yeast\n2. Add the honey to the milk and whisk for a minute (I stir, mix, knead by hand for this whole recipe but feel free to use a mixer and dough hook if that\u2019s what you\u2019re comfy with)\n3. Add yeast to the mixture and whisk for a minute and then let the mixture sit for a few minutes\n4. Add flour and salt and stir just to roughly combine\n5. Add eggs and stir for about a minute or two, it should look like a rough dough at this point\n6. Add softened butter to dough and fold in with hands. I like to flatten the dough a bit in the bowl and then dimple the butter into the dough with my fingers, fold the dough, dimple it again, and keep repeating this until there aren\u2019t clumps of butter.\n7. Fold dough in the bowl for a few minutes, I punch/massage the dough down, fold it, punch/massage it down again, quarter turn the bowl and keep repeating\n8. When dough lifts relatively cleanly from the bowl, start kneading on the counter. I typically spend about half an hour kneading by hand\n9. When dough meets the window pane test (or comes close, don\u2019t worry about it too much) put back into a large bowl and cover. Leave to rise for 1-3 hours. My kitchen was 73 degrees Fahrenheit and it took about 2 hours. It should double in size and be puffy.\n10. After rising, turn the bowl onto the counter for shaping. Shape however you like your rolls best but the following is my preference and is what is shown in the pictures of this post. I divide the dough into four sections, then roll out the four pieces of dough until they\u2019re about 9x12inch rectangles. I cut each rectangle in three strips that are 4 inches in width, then brush the honey butter mixture onto each strip and roll it. At the end of the process, you\u2019ll have 12 rolls that are about 4inches in width.\n11. Place rolls into oven safe dish, they should have about a 1/2 inch of space between them. I use a 12x8 and a 9x6. I put 9 rolls in the 12x8 and 3 rolls in the 9x6.\n12. Cover the dish with a towel and let the rolls rest for about an hour for their final rise. They should be puffy and not have space between them by the time the hour is over\n13. Preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit (I preheat during the final rise) and bake for 25 minutes, or until done. Cover with tin foil if the rolls are getting too dark\n14. Once out of the oven, brush the honey butter mixture over the tops of the rolls. Let them sit for a couple minutes and brush another coat on. Use the remaining honey butter for extra coats or to put on the rolls while eating.\n15. EAT!!!\n\n\nNotes: you may need to use more or less flour, depending on your environment and flour. I would measure out about 20g of AP to use during the kneading process if the dough really is too sticky. You can substitute the flour with AP or all bread flour or whatever you like best but I\u2019d keep in mind it may change consistency and you might have to adjust ratios a bit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hk13dh", "created_utc": 1734882563.0, "score": 3071, "author": "lucky-stump", "num_comments": 44, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1hk13dh/finally_able_to_deliver_the_honey_butter_roll/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Knead until it passes windowpane test, approx 20 minutes (very important, a very strong gluten network is the key to get a stringy crumb !). Then, gradually add the soft butter diced into cubes, while kneading. Add another 15-20 minutes of kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic. \n\nPut the dough in a oiled container for 30 minutes at room temperature. Make a fold, turn the dough inside out and tuck the edges underneath. Place in the fridge (4\u00b0C / 39,2\u00b0F) for at least 10 hours or more. \n\nPerform the shaping according to this video (too long to explain) : \nhttps://youtu.be/HeAx9arUfcQ?si=PlgZ3E073uDHCuZQ\n\nLet it proof for 1-2 hours in a warm place.

The luck helped me in the timing as all the family gathered just on time for the oven and dough ready to be prepared\nI expected to be finished in about one hour or so but it took me more than two hours to cook all of them, realizing how much effort i had to do to finish them.\n\nMain issue of all is that i didnt expected the oven to lose so much heat in short time, after just 5 pizzas i had to stop because the oven was not hot enough to cook, so after some more wood and patience the oven was ready to go for other 3 or 4 pizzas, than heat it up again to finish.\nThis was the second time i did it, first time i just struggle with the process of putting the raw pizza in the oven because every time i stretched and cause holes everywhere, this time the disc was fine and i didnt have any problem.\nI just wanted to share my experience hoping that can be helpful for any of you if needed\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kcidve", "created_utc": 1746130339.0, "score": 110, "author": "Limp_Care1961", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1kcidve/oven_wood_fire_pizza_are_not_easy/", "html_title": ""}

Mine look a little rough, not tight and smooth like I see in videos.\n\nThe dough stays very pale white even after fermenting. A lot of online examples look a bit creamy or slightly yellowish. Is it normal for my dough to stay really white?\n\nWhen kneading, the dough gets sticky after just a few seconds. Am I supposed to keep adding more flour every time it sticks? Or should I just work through it even if it\u2019s sticky?\n\nAfter kneading, my dough isn\u2019t very sticky anymore (probably because I keep dusting it with flour). Should properly kneaded dough still be a little sticky at the end?\n\nAfter fermenting in the fridge, the dough doesn\u2019t feel very stretchy. If I pinch a piece off, it almost tears away immediately without much resistance or stretch. Is this a sign of something wrong with my kneading, flour, resting time, or something else?\n\nI\u2019m really struggling to shape the dough into a round pizza \u2014 it keeps wanting to turn into a weird square or a rough rectangle, and it\u2019s hard to keep the middle from tearing.

{"title": "The Final Proof", "selftext": "I've been thinking a lot about the final proofing stage and trying to really nail down its purpose and how to get the timing just right. I wanted to share my current understanding and approach, and I'd love to hear your thoughts, corrections, and insights!\n\nHere's how I'm currently thinking about the final proof:\n\n* Main Purpose = Gluten Relaxation? My primary thought is that the final proof is crucial for letting the gluten network relax after shaping. This relaxation allows the dough to expand freely in the oven, giving good oven spring without being held back by a tight structure. Is this the most important aspect?\n\n* Secondary Purpose = Flavor Development? I also understand that, especially during colder/longer proofs (retarding), this stage is important for developing deeper flavors, potentially through different acid production (like more acetic acid, sourdough...). I see this as important, but maybe secondary to the structural aspect for room-temperature proofs?\n\n* Tertiary Purpose = CO2 Production? Of course, the yeast is still producing CO2, which inflates the dough. However, I've been wondering how critical this specific CO2 production during the final proof is. My reasoning is that the intense heat of the oven accelerates gas production and expansion so rapidly (oven spring). Does the CO2 built up before the oven really matter as much as the potential for expansion once it hits the heat?\n\nI know that if the final proof goes too long, the gluten structure weakens, and the bread can't hold its shape, resulting in a flatter loaf.\n\nMy Current Strategy for Duration: Based on the idea that gluten relaxation is key, I've been focusing on proofing just long enough for the dough to feel relaxed after the tension created during shaping. I often judge this by feel, and it seems like this relaxation happens relatively quickly, maybe around 30 minutes or so at room temperature. Once it feels less tense, I figure it's ready.\n\nMy Questions:\n* Is my understanding of the main purposes (relaxation vs. flavor vs. CO2) accurate? Am I perhaps underestimating the importance of the CO2 buildup during the final proof?\n* Flavour development aside, is judging the end of the final proof primarily by gluten relaxation (aiming for ~30 mins) a sound strategy, or am I likely underproofing by not focusing enough on gas development?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1k8e362/the_final_proof/", "created_utc": 1745677331.0, "score": 0, "author": "FroyoAbject", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k8e362/the_final_proof/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

But now I can't help but feel like a lot of the ways people diagnose issues with the bread at my work is nonsense. For example people make adjustments to water without considering hydration percentage or comparing like breads. Or they will adjust water to make the dough work better with the machinery rather than adjusting the machinery to accommodate the consistency of the dough. Or blaming the amount of sugar as the reason that bread isn't browning properly rather than making sure that the oven is set and holding temperature correctly. There is an assumption that a dough will not be good when it's been sitting in the refrigerated mixer for an hour and just needs to be thrown away at that point. A lot of this doesn't make sense to me from my experience baking at home. In my experience you should not have to change hydration levels once you've decided upon them except maybe if the moisture content of your flour changes. If your breads not browning it's because there's not enough direct heat hitting the crust to brown it. Dough is good for like a week when it's refrigerated and can rise over and over again. I'm just curious to discuss these things with an experienced baker to see if I'm thinking about this correctly.

But no rise at all after over a week.\n\nThe way I\u2019ve always started my starters is\u2026\n\n**Day 1**\n\nMix 100g of water and 100g of flour\n\n**Day 2**\n\nDo not discard, add another 100g of water and 100g of flour\n\nAnd then starting on day 3, just feed it once a day, and I use a 1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut yeah, just not working this time. Temperature is fine. I\u2019ve tried swapping out my jar cover for a paper towel with a rubber band. I\u2019ve tried changing the feeding ratio both with using more starter to fresh flour and water, and I\u2019ve also tried using less.\n\nThe ONLY thing I can think of, is the first few days I didn\u2019t have bottled water on hand, and so I used filtered tap water, which I\u2019ve never done before. So I wonder if there\u2019s anything there that was inhibiting yeast growth? But I also switched to using bottled water only two days in and it\u2019s been about a week since then, so I would\u2019ve thought that by now, if the filtered tap water was the issue, it would\u2019ve resolved.\n\nAny thoughts or things to try would be much appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1k6t8m6/sourdough_starter_troubleshooting/", "created_utc": 1745503939.0, "score": 1, "author": "DALTT", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k6t8m6/sourdough_starter_troubleshooting/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I am trying my best on baking sourdough bread for ~1 year (on and off) and I started baking it again 3 weeks ago. \nMy problem is now, more than ever, that the bread I get has a weird, hard and kinda gummy like exterior. Especially the bottom was very hard to cut and way too thick for my taste. Kinda hard to bite trough. I use a black dutch oven for baking and spray the loaf with some water before putting it in. \nFor the bottom part I started putting some aluminum foil under the dutch oven to radiate away some heat and it helped a bit. But for the gummy like texture of the crust I dont know what to do. \nI usually dont wrap my bread in a towel afterwards and I tried that once. The bread is then way more fluffy but the crust kinda stays the same.\n\nIs this a problem with my gluten structure or smthn?

{"title": "I started leaving bread bags in front of my neighbors' doors", "selftext": "I bake every day, and I have for the last year straight as a bit of therapy after a traumatic divorce and moving across the country. I'm not new to bread baking, but I was new to \"getting it right.\" I'm not a pro today - just happy with what I bake, now.\n\nI recently bought a grain mill. Somehow my daily bakes have turned into twice daily. I used to bake 1kg per day, and now I am closer to 2kg. I regularly eat one 500g loaf a day. I love fresh bread with jam - my partner does, too. When I make two 500g loaves, we might eat both each day and have no waste.\n\nI now have an extra kilo of baked bread that we can't eat fast enough. I might eventually change my baking schedule back to 1kg per day, but I'm enjoying myself. I don't really want to stop - I'm home all day, I am not able to work, and this is my only real hobby or activity to do since I can easily nap between proofing.\n\nI have decided to start giving my neighbors bread. I know there are no gluten or yeast issues with the neighbors I'm gifting bread to - no worries there. But they may not necessarily be expecting free bread.\n\nI left notes on their doors this morning to let them know they can ask me for free, fresh bread any time, and just to leave a note on my door with their (free) order of what they want (sourdough included!). One neighbors left a request an hour ago, and it's a nice feeling. Now my bread baking has a bit more purpose.\n\nMy region has comfortable cottage bakery laws. I'm not sure I'm interested in that. I am food handler certified, regardless. I just don't know if I want to be in that business. I have a software and hosting business, now - bread might not be my gig, professionally.\n\nIt sure is nice to be able to share fresh bread with my neighbors.\n\n...\n\nUpdate: The neighbor next door received the batch of bread I was baking for today, said they were delicious, and he's very thankful I'm doing this. While we were chatting, the other two neighbors came outside to say thanks and ask for a few bread things. It's really cool to see how happy they were when we talked about it - two out of three are very stoic, not commonly chatty people. The smile on their faces was very bright. I have two orders for tomorrow, one neighbor who's going to try to pay me even if I say no, and another neighbor who might ask for some bread after her laundry is done.\n\nWon't cost me any more money than I already spend on the hobby.\n\nHappy Easter everyone, this was a great day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1k3tsdn/i_started_leaving_bread_bags_in_front_of_my/", "created_utc": 1745175503.0, "score": 738, "author": "necromanticpotato", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k3tsdn/i_started_leaving_bread_bags_in_front_of_my/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

So do you think you are still reaping the benefits of the nutrients from the bran and germ or does toasting it negate the nutritional benefits? \n\nI attached a photo of what the crust looks like after baking with the bran and germ.

I only got 1 little problem, I used too much icing so on the colomba it detached a little bit during the upside down resting (you can notice it in the final photo the one from inside the colomba), it need to break evenly so that there is not too much heavy icing but it only expanded at the sides and set on top in one piece, it still did not break completely so at the end of the day it was still good looking. Also unlike last year the crumb inside is even, I did not get a large bubble on the center. I paid a lot of attention to avoid to create it when doing the cross (made to shape it like a \"dove\").\n\nUnlike Barbato I still used my current lievito madre (a stiff sourdough starter) so I needed a lot more time, but the taste is amazing.\n\nI had to wait one week to share the photo since you need to wait for it this much to get the best aroma, and yesterday I finally made a lot of photo of the inside.\n\nI actually only kept the tree shaped colomba (not a traditional shape but I got only one proper colomba mold so I decided to use another strange mold that was available thanks to my mother that got it at christmas and did not use it) I gifted the colomba to my nonna so I only got 1 photo of the inside of the colomba but the dough is the same for both.\n\nLike you can see from the recipe ingredients it require a lot of egg yolks, butter, sugar and you need to incorporate them in two stages, it will need a really strong gluten network and a really strong flour to keep it together, pay a lot of attention to temperature control and, if you, like me, used lievito madre (a stiff sourdough starter) remember that it need to be a lot sweeter than when used for bread, it will need a lot of hours of fermentations so it will acidify little by little and if it start at a 4.5 ph it will be too acidic, while a 5 ph should be good (if you don't have a ph meter just taste it). If this is your first grande lievitato start making it with regular yeast, it will be easier, faster and if you make any mistakes you will learn a lot, once you master it using sourdough starter is only a matter of waiting more time and refresh it about 3 times before starting the recipe.\n\nIf you never tasted it homemade/artisianal it's an experience that you need.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4hy3l", "created_utc": 1745253576.0, "score": 2, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k4hy3l/colomba_panettonelike_sourdough_sweet_bread_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Instant yeast for starter conversion", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI recently started baking bread using instant yeast. I'm still practicing the basics: mixing, BF, shaping, proofing, etc. I'm not using a starter yet, because I want to focus on other core skills.\n\nI'm very interested in the work of Tom at 'The Sourdough Journey', and the focus on temperature, time, and using the available variables to bake around a busy schedule. That said, I'd like to use certain of his methods with instant yeast, which poses a challenge in matching the bulk fermentation times. Luckily I work from home so it doesn't need to be perfect.\n\nI've found several articles about moving from yeast recipes to sourdough, suggesting to use about 100g of starter for 6g of active dry yeast (or 4.5 of instant). But I'm assuming that if I go from 100g of starter to 4.5 of instant, the fermentation will occur significantly more quickly. I've used the Jim Lahey no knead recipe to do a 12-18 hour BF with 430g flour and 1g of instant yeast, so I think that's a reasonable starting point, although I believe the volume increase was greater than what Tom recommends.\n\nThanks for any insight!\n\n\\* Note - I know I'll need to add flour and water when switching to yeast (i.e. if the recipe calls for 100g of starter, add 50g of flour and 50g of water when using yeast).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1k3s30z/instant_yeast_for_starter_conversion/", "created_utc": 1745170960.0, "score": 1, "author": "TransplantPilot", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k3s30z/instant_yeast_for_starter_conversion/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Beagles!!", "selftext": "This is my favorite beagle recipe from Sally\u2019s Baking Addiction, I made mine cinnamon sugar but you can make yours plain if you want! \n\nIngredients\n1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water (between 100-110\u00b0F, 38-43\u00b0C)\n2 and 3/4 teaspoons instant or active dry yeast*\n4 cups (520g) bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for work surface and hands (except I didn\u2019t have bread flour so I used all purpose)\n1 Tablespoon granulated sugar or packed light or dark brown sugar (or barley malt syrup)\n2 teaspoons salt\ncoating the bowl: nonstick spray or 2 teaspoons olive oil\negg wash: 1 egg white beaten with 1 Tablespoon water\nFor Boiling\n2 quarts water\n1/4 cup (60g) honey (or barley malt syrup)\n\nInstructions\nPrepare the dough: Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. *If you don\u2019t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step.\nAdd the flour, brown sugar, and salt. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough is very stiff and will look somewhat dry.\nKnead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 6-7 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6-7 full minutes. If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a \u201cwindowpane test\u201d to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it\u2019s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test.\n\nLightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.  Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.\nLine two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nShape the bagels: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it\u2014doesn\u2019t need to be perfect!) Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index finger through the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5 \u2013 2 inches in diameter. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with kitchen towel and rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C).\nWater bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. Whisk in the honey. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop bagels in, 2-4 at a time, making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels for 1 minute on each side.\nUsing a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. If you want to add toppings like everything beagle seasoning, cheese, cinnamon, this is the time. Place 4 bagels onto each lined baking sheet.\nBake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. You want the bagels to be a dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nSlice, toast, top, whatever you want! Cover leftover bagels tightly and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1e5lu", "created_utc": 1744900046.0, "score": 17, "author": "Appropriate-Cell-662", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k1e5lu/beagles/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Browned butter maple oat cinnamon sourdough bread\u2014incredibly delicious!", "selftext": "My wife (a lifelong bread eater due to her Portuguese background) said this was the best bread she has ever eaten!\n\nThe oatmeal that was cooked with browned butter, milk, maple syrup and cinnamon powder made such a great inclusion. The resulting loaf smells faintly of cinnamon and the oatmeal is just so tasty, and it adds some nice texture to the chew.\n\nI also baked with the lid on for 35 minutes as opposed to my usual 20 minutes for a really thin, flaky crust that's easy on the gum especially after toasting.\n\nI highly recommend trying this recipe!\n\n# Ingredients\n\nFor the loaf, you would want a high hydration dough (>75%), and I will explain why in the instructions.\n\n* 325g flours (I used 260g bread flour + 65g Canadian whole wheat red fife flour from [Arva Flour Mills](https://arvaflourmills.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqEj1fZlVNKhzXOhJyjIMqtQHhCjdfHa0J4jZbwe6VuzivjjCd5))\n* 250g water (adjust hydration as per your comfort level)\n* 7g salt\n* 65g active starter\n* 14g olive oil (optional)\n\n**Inclusion**\n\n* 30g rolled oats\n* 20g salted butter\n* 50g milk\n* Cinnamon powder\n* 1 tbsp maple syrup\n\n# Instructions\n\n**Cook the oatmeal**\n\n1. In a small saucepan, melt and cook butter until slightly browned. I have electric ranges and I cooked it at a 4/10 power. Be careful to not burn the butter.\n2. Add in the oats and cook until they look a bit brown\n3. Add in the milk, maple syrup, and cinnamon powder (I just eyeballed this)\n4. Cook until the oatmeal is very thick under low heat. This is important because you don't want the oatmeal to release a lot of moisture into the dough.\n5. Let it cool.\n\n**Make the dough**\n\n1. Mix flours, water, salt, starter and olive oil until they are well incorporated. Rest for 15 minutes.\n2. Do a set of S+F, and rest for 15 minutes\n3. Do another S+F, and rest for 30 minutes\n4. Do coil folds. When you do this, fold in half of the oatmeal. Note that the oatmeal will be extremely thick once it cools, so break them into small pieces and fold them in bit by bit, until most of the oatmeal is inside the dough.\n5. Rest for 30 minutes\n6. Do step 4 again. This is why I recommend a high hydration dough\u2014you need to do many folds to get the oatmeal pieces into the dough.

{"title": "Should i make a career switch to baker?", "selftext": "Sorry for the stupid question, but... lately I've been feeling I am in dire need of a career switch. I have been working in IT for 25 years, and I can't sit behind a computer screen for over 8 hours a day anymore. I would like to make something of my last 25 years of working (I'm 43) and was thinking maybe baking would suit me. But I am not sure what the reality of it is. I don't think I would mind occasionally getting up early or maybe in shifts, but I wonder, do all bakers get up at 3 in the night? What are some of the lesser known realities of being a baker? And how feasible is it to make enough money with a home baker or something a tad more professional than that. I am not in it for the money; then I would stay in IT, but I would love to eat :D (other than bread).\n\nAre there any career-switchers here who have some advice for me?\n\np.s. I love baking, but I'm not very good at it yet. I have started baking breads from a book I bought. I do love cooking in general, and I would say I'm fairly good at that, but working in a restaurant doesn't much appeal to me. I am more an early bird than a night owl. I am thinking of doing some courses in my vicinity, but I don't have the time to invest in full-time study.\n\nWould love to hear some advice.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the great insights and advice! I think for the coming years I will perfect the craft by doing some courses and maybe doing some internships or apprenticeships at local bakeries without fully switching to becoming a full time baker. I will stay in IT and look for a job in which I will have less of the things that crush me. I will probably look into starting a home bakery after a few years where I have control over the amounts of work and hours I need to put in, so I won't lose it as a passion, and on the side I will try to bring down the hours I put into IT work and make sure I don't get financially dependent on becoming a baker. After all I have amassed a great set of skills in IT that are worth quite a bit of money, and as someone here pointed out, it would be less than ideal to make my (future) family suffer because of that. I don't think it's a good idea for me now and in the foreseeable future to fully switch to becoming a baker because of the hours and the physical tax. My lungs arent that healthy to begin with so it might not be a good idea to do that.\n\nHopefully at some point me and my girlfriend can run a home bakery for a few days in the week where we have decent equipment and a small network of people who we feed.\n\nThanks yall for taking the time!

I caramelized some pearl onions (purchased frozen and pre-peeled) and added herbs to olive oil (fresh rosemary, thyme, and parsley, dried basil) and dimpled them into the dough before the final proof. Added some maldon salt flakes just before baking. The pearl onions are almost like grapes in texture, sweet and soft! \n\nStarted the dough around noon (not including the mixing of the poolish the night before), and the bread went in the oven around 7pm. Most of that time was fermentation, as I used my stand mixer to mix the ingredients before the first stretch and fold. My kitchen is usually very cold (under 65\u00b0F until summer begins) so fermentation takes a long time; I usually add an extra pinch of yeast when I\u2019m in a time crunch.\n\nI definitely ignore the book\u2019s suggestion to use as much as 2 cups of the herbed oil - not making that mistake again! instead I do kind of decide the amount of herb oil to add before the dimpling and the last proof based on vibes and how oily the whole dough looks before it goes in the oven. I can\u2019t give you a measured amount of how much I added, because I didn\u2019t measure, just scooped oil onto the dough until it looked good.

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I finally ventured into the world of enriched doughs with these mini chocolate cinnamon rolls made in my air fryer. They're not as picture-perfect as some of the amazing creations I see here, but for a first attempt, I'm pretty happy with how they turned out!\n\nThe crumb was surprisingly tender and the chocolate chips melted perfectly into the swirls. The best part was definitely the contrast between the slightly crisp exterior from the air fryer and that soft, pillowy interior. \n\nMini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Style)\nMakes 9-12 rolls\n\nDough:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 2 tbsp sugar\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- \u00be cup warm milk (38-40\u00b0C)\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted\n- 1 egg (room temperature)\n\nFilling:\n- 2 tbsp softened butter\n- 2 tbsp brown sugar\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\n- \u00bc cup mini chocolate chips/chopped chocolate\n\nOptional Glaze:\n- \u00bc cup cream cheese, softened\n- 2 tbsp powdered sugar\n- 1 tbsp butter, soft\n- Splash of milk or vanilla\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.\n\n2. Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough and roll into a rectangle about 10x12 inches. Spread softened butter, sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. Roll tightly from the short side and slice into 9-12 mini rolls.\n\n3. Second rise: Place rolls in a parchment-lined air fryer tray, spaced slightly apart. Cover lightly and let rise for 30-40 minutes until puffed up.\n\n4. Air fry: Preheat air fryer at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for 3 minutes. Air fry rolls at 160\u00b0C for 8-10 minutes until golden on top and soft inside. You may need to do this in 2 batches.\n\n5. Glaze: Mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth. Spread over warm rolls.\n\nAny tips from the bread experts here? I found the dough needed quite a bit of bench flour when rolling out - is that normal or did I do something wrong with my hydration? Also, I'm curious whether anyone else has experimented with yeasted doughs in an air fryer!\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/x4s9ecoj91ve1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744737899.0, "score": 27, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1jzxo4x/mini_chocolate_cinnamon_rolls_in_the_air_fryer/", "html_title": ""}

Even the knives I keep for cooking are all dull. I know it's more dangerous, but it's a better alternative for harming myself 100% against potentially hurting myself. I have been clean for a while now, but i still don't trust myself to be safe with a blade.\n\nSo I was wondering if there was any way to score a bread without a blade?

{"title": "first sourdough ciabatta!", "selftext": "Recipe from Maurizio Leo :))\n\nIngredients:\n\nLevain:\n68g high-protein white bread flour (King Arthur Bread Flour)\n\n68g water\n\n68g ripe sourdough starter (100% hydration)\n\nAutolyse:\n876g high-protein white bread flour\n\n105g freshly milled Khorasan or hard red whole wheat\n\n686g water\n\nMain Dough\n\n84g water\n\n21g extra-virgin olive oil\n\n20g fine sea salt\n\n204g ripe levain\n\nInstructions:\nPrepare the levain \u2013 9:00 a.m.\n\nMix the levain ingredients in a jar and leave them covered at 74-76\u00b0F (23-24\u00b0C) to ripen for 3 to 4 hours.\n\nAutolyse \u2013 11:30 a.m.\nPlace the flour and autolyse water in your mixer bowl or a large bowl (if mixing by hand). Turn the mixer on to low speed and mix for 2 minutes until no dry bits remain; the dough will be shaggy and loose. Use a bowl scraper to scrape down the sides of the bowl to keep all the dough in one area at the bottom. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nMix \u2013 12:00 p.m.\nTo the mixer, add the levain, salt, and a splash of the reserved water. Mix on speed one until everything is incorporated, about 30 seconds. Then, switch the mixer to speed 2 and mix for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes, start adding the rest of the reserved water, a little bit at a time, throughout an additional 4 minutes for a total of 8 minutes mix time. Turn the mixer to speed 1 and slowly stream in the olive oil. Continue to mix until the oil is absorbed and the dough is cohesive and shiny about 2 minutes.\n\nBulk Fermentation \u2013 12:15 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. (3 hours 30 minutes)\nDuring this phase (of the two-step bulk fermentation phase), give the dough 3 sets of vigorous stretch and folds separated by 30 minutes each. The first set happens 30 minutes after the beginning of bulk. The dough will be very slack and wet. Use wet hands and perform the folds quickly. After the last set of stretch and folds, let the dough rest the remainder of bulk fermentation, covered.\n\nDivide \u2013 3:45 p.m.\nHeavily dust the top of your dough with white flour. Loosen the dough from the sides using a bench scraper, then invert the container to let the dough fall onto your work surface. Flour the new top of the dough, cut it into four rectangles, and separate them. Lay out a floured couche (or kitchen towel) on your work surface. Transfer each dough rectangle to the couche, keeping the bottom side down. Gently stretch the dough to your desired length. If you prefer, leave them in smaller rectangles. Make a crease in the couche and flour it before placing the next piece.\n\nProof \u2013 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.\nCover your dough with the end of the couche or a food-safe plastic bag (be sure not to let the plastic touch the dough). Let your dough proof for around 2 hours. At the end of this time, the dough will look significantly fermented and bubbly all over, and when poked for the poke test, it will almost have little to no spring back.\n\nBake \u2013 6:00 p.m.\nPreheat your oven with a baking stone or steel at 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) for 30 minutes. Flour the dough and flip each piece onto a large cutting board, then slide them onto parchment paper. Transfer two pieces to the fridge for later. Use a pizza peel to slide the parchment and dough onto the baking surface. Steam the oven and bake for 20 minutes, then remove steam pans, vent the oven, and reduce heat to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Bake for another 20-25 minutes until fully done to avoid a gummy interior.\n\nFind it online: https://www.theperfectloaf.com/ciabatta-bread-recipe/", "url": "https://v.redd.it/pxwoftty6kue1", "created_utc": 1744531214.0, "score": 37, "author": "Ranchu_craft", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1jy2n7j/first_sourdough_ciabatta/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Instead of making a starter capable of making a recipe calling for 100-200g, can I just take my yeast recipe and use some small amount of starter instead... same recipe otherwise.\n\nRoughly, how much starter would this take?  (I know there's wide variation, depending on how eager my starter is; just looking for a vague number... weight, volume, whatever.)

I have recently tried my hand at making my first ever loaf or roll with a test recipe that failed badly before stumbling onto a basic youtube recipe (with basically same ratio but higher volumes and longer cooking time) \n\nBackground info: \n- 4 weeks old starter\n- fed bread flour for 2.5 weeks before transitioning to rye: bread feeding of 1:2 \n- fed every 24 hours for 3 weeks but I think I underfed it accidentally, so it was smelling alcoholic almost every other day but still doubling within 12 hours \n- currently being fed 1:6:6 (rye, bread flour) \n\nI did my first test loaf while it was starving so it eneded up being quite miserable and definitely not bread and definitely poisonous. \n\n2nd time around was just the starter taken 12 hours later, once it was at the peak. \n\nThe starter was mixed immediately with the ingrdients and left to bulk ferment, and stretch & folds 2-3 times. Definitely very watery and not holding any shape, so I decided to leave it 24 hours in the fridge to hopefully ferment. \n\nIt then looked suspiciously like the first attempt, so I decided to add 1g instant yeast for every 100g flour - dissolved in water only and mixed into flour, left to bulk ferment for 2h with 2 stretch and fold before it went into the fridge to cold ferment only 1h and went into the oven for 35+20 mins at 220C. \n\nSomehow it has given me edible rye bread (or so my partner says) but it tastes super sour?

{"title": "The Final Proof", "selftext": "I've been thinking a lot about the final proofing stage and trying to really nail down its purpose and how to get the timing just right. I wanted to share my current understanding and approach, and I'd love to hear your thoughts, corrections, and insights!\n\nHere's how I'm currently thinking about the final proof:\n\n* Main Purpose = Gluten Relaxation? My primary thought is that the final proof is crucial for letting the gluten network relax after shaping. This relaxation allows the dough to expand freely in the oven, giving good oven spring without being held back by a tight structure. Is this the most important aspect?\n\n* Secondary Purpose = Flavor Development? I also understand that, especially during colder/longer proofs (retarding), this stage is important for developing deeper flavors, potentially through different acid production (like more acetic acid, sourdough...). I see this as important, but maybe secondary to the structural aspect for room-temperature proofs?\n\n* Tertiary Purpose = CO2 Production? Of course, the yeast is still producing CO2, which inflates the dough. However, I've been wondering how critical this specific CO2 production during the final proof is. My reasoning is that the intense heat of the oven accelerates gas production and expansion so rapidly (oven spring). Does the CO2 built up before the oven really matter as much as the potential for expansion once it hits the heat?\n\nI know that if the final proof goes too long, the gluten structure weakens, and the bread can't hold its shape, resulting in a flatter loaf.\n\nMy Current Strategy for Duration: Based on the idea that gluten relaxation is key, I've been focusing on proofing just long enough for the dough to feel relaxed after the tension created during shaping. I often judge this by feel, and it seems like this relaxation happens relatively quickly, maybe around 30 minutes or so at room temperature. Once it feels less tense, I figure it's ready.\n\nMy Questions:\n* Is my understanding of the main purposes (relaxation vs. flavor vs. CO2) accurate? Am I perhaps underestimating the importance of the CO2 buildup during the final proof?\n* Flavour development aside, is judging the end of the final proof primarily by gluten relaxation (aiming for ~30 mins) a sound strategy, or am I likely underproofing by not focusing enough on gas development?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1k8e362/the_final_proof/", "created_utc": 1745677331.0, "score": 0, "author": "FroyoAbject", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k8e362/the_final_proof/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Mine look a little rough, not tight and smooth like I see in videos.\n\nThe dough stays very pale white even after fermenting. A lot of online examples look a bit creamy or slightly yellowish. Is it normal for my dough to stay really white?\n\nWhen kneading, the dough gets sticky after just a few seconds. Am I supposed to keep adding more flour every time it sticks? Or should I just work through it even if it\u2019s sticky?\n\nAfter kneading, my dough isn\u2019t very sticky anymore (probably because I keep dusting it with flour). Should properly kneaded dough still be a little sticky at the end?\n\nAfter fermenting in the fridge, the dough doesn\u2019t feel very stretchy.

Is this a sign of something wrong with my kneading, flour, resting time, or something else?\n\nI\u2019m really struggling to shape the dough into a round pizza \u2014 it keeps wanting to turn into a weird square or a rough rectangle, and it\u2019s hard to keep the middle from tearing.

I only got 1 little problem, I used too much icing so on the colomba it detached a little bit during the upside down resting (you can notice it in the final photo the one from inside the colomba), it need to break evenly so that there is not too much heavy icing but it only expanded at the sides and set on top in one piece, it still did not break completely so at the end of the day it was still good looking. Also unlike last year the crumb inside is even, I did not get a large bubble on the center. I paid a lot of attention to avoid to create it when doing the cross (made to shape it like a \"dove\").\n\nUnlike Barbato I still used my current lievito madre (a stiff sourdough starter) so I needed a lot more time, but the taste is amazing.\n\nI had to wait one week to share the photo since you need to wait for it this much to get the best aroma, and yesterday I finally made a lot of photo of the inside.\n\nI actually only kept the tree shaped colomba (not a traditional shape but I got only one proper colomba mold so I decided to use another strange mold that was available thanks to my mother that got it at christmas and did not use it) I gifted the colomba to my nonna so I only got 1 photo of the inside of the colomba but the dough is the same for both.\n\nLike you can see from the recipe ingredients it require a lot of egg yolks, butter, sugar and you need to incorporate them in two stages, it will need a really strong gluten network and a really strong flour to keep it together, pay a lot of attention to temperature control and, if you, like me, used lievito madre (a stiff sourdough starter) remember that it need to be a lot sweeter than when used for bread, it will need a lot of hours of fermentations so it will acidify little by little and if it start at a 4.5 ph it will be too acidic, while a 5 ph should be good (if you don't have a ph meter just taste it). If this is your first grande lievitato start making it with regular yeast, it will be easier, faster and if you make any mistakes you will learn a lot, once you master it using sourdough starter is only a matter of waiting more time and refresh it about 3 times before starting the recipe.\n\nIf you never tasted it homemade/artisianal it's an experience that you need.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4hy3l", "created_utc": 1745253576.0, "score": 2, "author": "LiefLayer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k4hy3l/colomba_panettonelike_sourdough_sweet_bread_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I'm not new to bread baking, but I was new to \"getting it right.\" I'm not a pro today - just happy with what I bake, now.\n\nI recently bought a grain mill. Somehow my daily bakes have turned into twice daily. I used to bake 1kg per day, and now I am closer to 2kg. I regularly eat one 500g loaf a day. I love fresh bread with jam - my partner does, too. When I make two 500g loaves, we might eat both each day and have no waste.\n\nI now have an extra kilo of baked bread that we can't eat fast enough. I might eventually change my baking schedule back to 1kg per day, but I'm enjoying myself. I don't really want to stop - I'm home all day, I am not able to work, and this is my only real hobby or activity to do since I can easily nap between proofing.\n\nI have decided to start giving my neighbors bread. I know there are no gluten or yeast issues with the neighbors I'm gifting bread to - no worries there. But they may not necessarily be expecting free bread.\n\nI left notes on their doors this morning to let them know they can ask me for free, fresh bread any time, and just to leave a note on my door with their (free) order of what they want (sourdough included!). One neighbors left a request an hour ago, and it's a nice feeling. Now my bread baking has a bit more purpose.\n\nMy region has comfortable cottage bakery laws. I'm not sure I'm interested in that. I am food handler certified, regardless. I just don't know if I want to be in that business. I have a software and hosting business, now - bread might not be my gig, professionally.\n\nIt sure is nice to be able to share fresh bread with my neighbors.\n\n...\n\nUpdate: The neighbor next door received the batch of bread I was baking for today, said they were delicious, and he's very thankful I'm doing this. While we were chatting, the other two neighbors came outside to say thanks and ask for a few bread things. It's really cool to see how happy they were when we talked about it - two out of three are very stoic, not commonly chatty people. The smile on their faces was very bright. I have two orders for tomorrow, one neighbor who's going to try to pay me even if I say no, and another neighbor who might ask for some bread after her laundry is done.\n\nWon't cost me any more money than I already spend on the hobby.\n\nHappy Easter everyone, this was a great day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1k3tsdn/i_started_leaving_bread_bags_in_front_of_my/", "created_utc": 1745175503.0, "score": 739, "author": "necromanticpotato", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k3tsdn/i_started_leaving_bread_bags_in_front_of_my/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Instant yeast for starter conversion", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI recently started baking bread using instant yeast. I'm still practicing the basics: mixing, BF, shaping, proofing, etc. I'm not using a starter yet, because I want to focus on other core skills.\n\nI'm very interested in the work of Tom at 'The Sourdough Journey', and the focus on temperature, time, and using the available variables to bake around a busy schedule. That said, I'd like to use certain of his methods with instant yeast, which poses a challenge in matching the bulk fermentation times. Luckily I work from home so it doesn't need to be perfect.\n\nI've found several articles about moving from yeast recipes to sourdough, suggesting to use about 100g of starter for 6g of active dry yeast (or 4.5 of instant). But I'm assuming that if I go from 100g of starter to 4.5 of instant, the fermentation will occur significantly more quickly. I've used the Jim Lahey no knead recipe to do a 12-18 hour BF with 430g flour and 1g of instant yeast, so I think that's a reasonable starting point, although I believe the volume increase was greater than what Tom recommends.\n\nThanks for any insight!\n\n\\* Note - I know I'll need to add flour and water when switching to yeast (i.e. if the recipe calls for 100g of starter, add 50g of flour and 50g of water when using yeast).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1k3s30z/instant_yeast_for_starter_conversion/", "created_utc": 1745170960.0, "score": 1, "author": "TransplantPilot", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k3s30z/instant_yeast_for_starter_conversion/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. *If you don\u2019t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step.\nAdd the flour, brown sugar, and salt. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough is very stiff and will look somewhat dry.\nKnead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 6-7 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6-7 full minutes. If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a \u201cwindowpane test\u201d to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it\u2019s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test.\n\nLightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.  Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.\nLine two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nShape the bagels: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it\u2014doesn\u2019t need to be perfect!) Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index finger through the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5 \u2013 2 inches in diameter. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with kitchen towel and rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C).\nWater bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. Whisk in the honey. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop bagels in, 2-4 at a time, making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels for 1 minute on each side.\nUsing a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. If you want to add toppings like everything beagle seasoning, cheese, cinnamon, this is the time. Place 4 bagels onto each lined baking sheet.\nBake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. You want the bagels to be a dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\nSlice, toast, top, whatever you want!

{"title": "Browned butter maple oat cinnamon sourdough bread\u2014incredibly delicious!", "selftext": "My wife (a lifelong bread eater due to her Portuguese background) said this was the best bread she has ever eaten!\n\nThe oatmeal that was cooked with browned butter, milk, maple syrup and cinnamon powder made such a great inclusion. The resulting loaf smells faintly of cinnamon and the oatmeal is just so tasty, and it adds some nice texture to the chew.\n\nI also baked with the lid on for 35 minutes as opposed to my usual 20 minutes for a really thin, flaky crust that's easy on the gum especially after toasting.\n\nI highly recommend trying this recipe!\n\n# Ingredients\n\nFor the loaf, you would want a high hydration dough (>75%), and I will explain why in the instructions.\n\n* 325g flours (I used 260g bread flour + 65g Canadian whole wheat red fife flour from [Arva Flour Mills](https://arvaflourmills.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqEj1fZlVNKhzXOhJyjIMqtQHhCjdfHa0J4jZbwe6VuzivjjCd5))\n* 250g water (adjust hydration as per your comfort level)\n* 7g salt\n* 65g active starter\n* 14g olive oil (optional)\n\n**Inclusion**\n\n* 30g rolled oats\n* 20g salted butter\n* 50g milk\n* Cinnamon powder\n* 1 tbsp maple syrup\n\n# Instructions\n\n**Cook the oatmeal**\n\n1. In a small saucepan, melt and cook butter until slightly browned. I have electric ranges and I cooked it at a 4/10 power. Be careful to not burn the butter.\n2. Add in the oats and cook until they look a bit brown\n3. Add in the milk, maple syrup, and cinnamon powder (I just eyeballed this)\n4. Cook until the oatmeal is very thick under low heat. This is important because you don't want the oatmeal to release a lot of moisture into the dough.\n5. Let it cool.\n\n**Make the dough**\n\n1. Mix flours, water, salt, starter and olive oil until they are well incorporated. Rest for 15 minutes.\n2. Do a set of S+F, and rest for 15 minutes\n3. Do another S+F, and rest for 30 minutes\n4. Do coil folds. When you do this, fold in half of the oatmeal. Note that the oatmeal will be extremely thick once it cools, so break them into small pieces and fold them in bit by bit, until most of the oatmeal is inside the dough.\n5. Rest for 30 minutes\n6. Do step 4 again. This is why I recommend a high hydration dough\u2014you need to do many folds to get the oatmeal pieces into the dough. A lower hydration dough won't let you fold so many times.\n   1. However, if you want to use a lower hydration dough, add in the oatmeal via lamination.\n7. Bulk ferment in a straight-sided container until the dough rises 25-50%\u2014the optimal rise level will depend on many factors, so you will have to use your own judgement.\n8. Shape, and do the final proof.\n9. Bake in the over with steam or covered in a dutch oven for 30 minutes for a thinner crust, or 20 minutes for a thicker crust.\n10. Bake without steam/uncovered until the crust is browned to your liking.\n\nRecipe modified from: [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB9EsNcNQat/?igsh=MXFqeW1kZzF3ODJnbw==](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DB9EsNcNQat/?igsh=MXFqeW1kZzF3ODJnbw==)\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/mbo2eki219ve1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744831983.0, "score": 55, "author": "theSourdoughNeighbor", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1k0t86y/browned_butter_maple_oat_cinnamon_sourdough/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Should i make a career switch to baker?", "selftext": "Sorry for the stupid question, but... lately I've been feeling I am in dire need of a career switch. I have been working in IT for 25 years, and I can't sit behind a computer screen for over 8 hours a day anymore. I would like to make something of my last 25 years of working (I'm 43) and was thinking maybe baking would suit me. But I am not sure what the reality of it is. I don't think I would mind occasionally getting up early or maybe in shifts, but I wonder, do all bakers get up at 3 in the night? What are some of the lesser known realities of being a baker? And how feasible is it to make enough money with a home baker or something a tad more professional than that. I am not in it for the money; then I would stay in IT, but I would love to eat :D (other than bread).\n\nAre there any career-switchers here who have some advice for me?\n\np.s. I love baking, but I'm not very good at it yet. I have started baking breads from a book I bought. I do love cooking in general, and I would say I'm fairly good at that, but working in a restaurant doesn't much appeal to me. I am more an early bird than a night owl. I am thinking of doing some courses in my vicinity, but I don't have the time to invest in full-time study.\n\nWould love to hear some advice.\n\nCheers!\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the great insights and advice! I think for the coming years I will perfect the craft by doing some courses and maybe doing some internships or apprenticeships at local bakeries without fully switching to becoming a full time baker. I will stay in IT and look for a job in which I will have less of the things that crush me. I will probably look into starting a home bakery after a few years where I have control over the amounts of work and hours I need to put in, so I won't lose it as a passion, and on the side I will try to bring down the hours I put into IT work and make sure I don't get financially dependent on becoming a baker. After all I have amassed a great set of skills in IT that are worth quite a bit of money, and as someone here pointed out, it would be less than ideal to make my (future) family suffer because of that. I don't think it's a good idea for me now and in the foreseeable future to fully switch to becoming a baker because of the hours and the physical tax. My lungs arent that healthy to begin with so it might not be a good idea to do that.\n\nHopefully at some point me and my girlfriend can run a home bakery for a few days in the week where we have decent equipment and a small network of people who we feed.\n\nThanks yall for taking the time!

I caramelized some pearl onions (purchased frozen and pre-peeled) and added herbs to olive oil (fresh rosemary, thyme, and parsley, dried basil) and dimpled them into the dough before the final proof. Added some maldon salt flakes just before baking. The pearl onions are almost like grapes in texture, sweet and soft! \n\nStarted the dough around noon (not including the mixing of the poolish the night before), and the bread went in the oven around 7pm. Most of that time was fermentation, as I used my stand mixer to mix the ingredients before the first stretch and fold. My kitchen is usually very cold (under 65\u00b0F until summer begins) so fermentation takes a long time; I usually add an extra pinch of yeast when I\u2019m in a time crunch.\n\nI definitely ignore the book\u2019s suggestion to use as much as 2 cups of the herbed oil - not making that mistake again! instead I do kind of decide the amount of herb oil to add before the dimpling and the last proof based on vibes and how oily the whole dough looks before it goes in the oven. I can\u2019t give you a measured amount of how much I added, because I didn\u2019t measure, just scooped oil onto the dough until it looked good.

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I finally ventured into the world of enriched doughs with these mini chocolate cinnamon rolls made in my air fryer. They're not as picture-perfect as some of the amazing creations I see here, but for a first attempt, I'm pretty happy with how they turned out!\n\nThe crumb was surprisingly tender and the chocolate chips melted perfectly into the swirls. The best part was definitely the contrast between the slightly crisp exterior from the air fryer and that soft, pillowy interior. \n\nMini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Style)\nMakes 9-12 rolls\n\nDough:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 2 tbsp sugar\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- \u00be cup warm milk (38-40\u00b0C)\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted\n- 1 egg (room temperature)\n\nFilling:\n- 2 tbsp softened butter\n- 2 tbsp brown sugar\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\n- \u00bc cup mini chocolate chips/chopped chocolate\n\nOptional Glaze:\n- \u00bc cup cream cheese, softened\n- 2 tbsp powdered sugar\n- 1 tbsp butter, soft\n- Splash of milk or vanilla\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.\n\n2. Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough and roll into a rectangle about 10x12 inches. Spread softened butter, sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. Roll tightly from the short side and slice into 9-12 mini rolls.\n\n3. Second rise: Place rolls in a parchment-lined air fryer tray, spaced slightly apart. Cover lightly and let rise for 30-40 minutes until puffed up.\n\n4. Air fry: Preheat air fryer at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for 3 minutes. Air fry rolls at 160\u00b0C for 8-10 minutes until golden on top and soft inside. You may need to do this in 2 batches.\n\n5. Glaze: Mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth. Spread over warm rolls.\n\nAny tips from the bread experts here? I found the dough needed quite a bit of bench flour when rolling out - is that normal or did I do something wrong with my hydration? Also, I'm curious whether anyone else has experimented with yeasted doughs in an air fryer!\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/x4s9ecoj91ve1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744737899.0, "score": 27, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1jzxo4x/mini_chocolate_cinnamon_rolls_in_the_air_fryer/", "html_title": ""}

For the current roman pizza recipe I've been developing, this happened very quickly and every time.  Some hand kneading and a pinch of flour \"fixed\" the issue but it's obviously not perfect or ideal.\n\nRecipe is:\n300g of 60% biga (bread flour 1% yeast)\n312g 00 flour\n287g cold water\n5.5g instant yeast\n5g salt\n8g EVOO\n50g grated pecorino as inclusion\n\nTechnique I'm working on for this is 100% bassinage, so biga, flour, yeast into the bowl, slowly incorporate, 50% of the water on low, the rest on med-high. Then pecorino, evoo, salt at the end just to incorporate.\n\nBasically as soon as I speed up the mixer the dough collapses and any more water sloshes around.  Dough temperature doesn't seem to be an issue, could this be an issue of not enough dough for my capacity or something else? 5.5quart kitchenaid bowl-lift.\n\nI've had luck with the quick foccacia recipe posted here awhile ago at this hydration, but that technique is where you just dump it all into the bowl, rip on maximum for a minute, and then sit at room temp for 2 hours.

{"title": "How much starter (roughly) to use in lieu of 1/4t yeast in an overnight room-temp rise?", "selftext": "I'm interested in giving sourdough a try, but the requirement to create a lot of starter, and discard on the days I don't need to bake, but do need to feed, is a problem... one can only make so many crackers, pancakes, waffles, etc. (And needing to wait a while to \"wake up\" a refrigerated starter before it can be used is no picnic either.)\n\nIt dawned on me that my primary go-to recipe is just 1/4t of yeast (roughly 0.75g, according to the Internet) with an overnight room-temp rise.  Instead of making a starter capable of making a recipe calling for 100-200g, can I just take my yeast recipe and use some small amount of starter instead... same recipe otherwise.\n\nRoughly, how much starter would this take?  (I know there's wide variation, depending on how eager my starter is; just looking for a vague number... weight, volume, whatever.)  This would mean my daily discard-or-bake would be a just some trivial amount, instead of potentially shoveling a significant pile of smelly goo into the trash.\n\nEDIT: Perhaps I'm not being clear.  I use 1/4t yeast to kick off an overnight room-temp rise.  I want to swap out the yeast for the amount of starter that will take about the same amount of time. I want to otherwise leave the process untouched.  (The process being: decide at lunch that I need more bread for lunch tomorrow, mix in the evening, some stretch-and-folds if I have the time, overnight room-temp rise, shape when I get up, bake 2-3 hours later.)\n\nPretty much \"Lahey-style no-knead bread, but with a little bit sourdough starter instead of a little bit of yeast\" can I make this change without otherwise modifying the recipe?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1jyipbs/how_much_starter_roughly_to_use_in_lieu_of_14t/", "created_utc": 1744580098.0, "score": 1, "author": "Sirwired", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/Breadit/comments/1jyipbs/how_much_starter_roughly_to_use_in_lieu_of_14t/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
