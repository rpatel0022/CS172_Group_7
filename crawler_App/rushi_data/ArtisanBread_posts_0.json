{"title": "Troubleshooting dense loaves/no rise", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nPlease help!!\n\nI've recently started baking with starter, and have run in to some troubles in my first pure starter loaves (hybrid ones worked well). I've built a starter following Ken Forkish's instructions in FWSY (scaled down to reduce waste), and it is 3 or so weeks old. The last two loaves I've baked were the overnight country blonde from FWSY, both of which did not rise much during bulk fermentation (with the second loaf rising the most and growing ~1.5x). Forkish calls for an overnight bulk ferment, and waiting until the dough grows 2-3x in size, which I am not achieving. By the time I try to shape the rounds the next morning, they remain sticky and don't hold their shape. When they go in the dutch oven, they simply spread out as much as they can, and get little to no oven spring, leaving me with a dense round with a tacky, almost sticky crumb that looks as though it's cooked through. I pull it when the outside is golden, and just before the bottom burns.

Because of the lack of upvotes, every post in this subreddit is sensitive to downvotes and tends to vanish from the front page if it is downvoted, even just once. \n\nI kindly request each member to not downvote a post in this subreddit. Rather, if you do not like a post, please comment *why* you do not like it. This is far better than simply downvoting a post. It promotes discussion and offers an opportunity to educate members of our community.\n\nLastly, if you have the time, please click the \"new\" tab to view the downvoted posts that have disappeared from the front page.\n\nThank you and have a happy baking. :)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1am6hw/rartisanbread_why_posts_cannot_be_downvoted_in/", "created_utc": 1363725218.0, "score": 24, "author": "bakingbadly", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1am6hw/rartisanbread_why_posts_cannot_be_downvoted_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "100% Sprouted Whole Grain Pulp Bread", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been developing a recipe for sprouted whole grain pulp bread, based on a recipe in Peter Reinhart\u2019s\u00a0**Bread Revolution**. A pulp bread uses no flour\u2014instead, sprouted grain kernels are ground or mashed into a paste, which forms the basis of the dough. A common commercially available bread produced with this method is Food for Life\u2019s Ezekiel Bread. Replicating that product in a home environment was the primary inspiration for this recipe.\n\n**The Results:**\n\nThe bread is very flavorful with a texture comparable to a supermarket multigrain bread. The sprouting process creates a complex flavor profile, so the bread tastes great despite the very short fermentation. The crumb is very slightly moist (think wonderbread), despite temping at 210 F. The crust is well done and crispy. The little bits of mashed grains give textural variety. The slices stand up well to peanut butter, sandwiches, etc and make great toast.\n\n**The Pulping Process**:\n\nI start by sprouting 50% hard red spring wheat and 50% spelt kernels. I won\u2019t detail the sprouting process since there are numerous guides on that all around the internet, though I will mention that I stop the sprouting process before the shoots are longer than the grain kernel itself. Based on pre- and post- sprout weight, the grain absorbs 75% of its dry mass in water, so the grain pulp can be thought of as a 75% hydration dough.\n\nI use a LEM Big Bite #32 1.5 HP meat grinder to create the pulp. I feed the sprouted grain through three times\u2014first through a coarse plate (10mm), then a fine plate (4.5mm), then finish on an extra fine plate (1/8 inch). At this point the pulp is an extremely sticky cohesive mass. Gluten development is great and the strands are very evident to the naked eye.\n\nI believe the pulp can be used immediately to make a dough, but I generally put it into the refrigerator to use later in the day or the next day. The pulp can also be frozen with no ill effects\u2014the bread in the pictures was baked with pulp that had been frozen in vacuum bags for several days and thawed in the refrigerator for another day before use.\n\n**The Recipe:**\n\nMy recipe, as well as the recipe from Reinhart\u2019s book, is given in the following table. I\u2019ll discuss the reasons for the deviations further below. The loaf in the pictures is based on 1kg dough weight, reflected below.\n\n|Ingredient|Reinhart Recipe|My Recipe|Grams|Oz|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Wheat/Spelt Pulp|100%|100%|768.64|26.97|\n|Water|12%|12%|92.24|3.24|\n|VWG|9.4%|9.4%|72.25|2.54|\n|Yeast|2.1%|2.1%|16.14|0.57|\n|Salt|1.5%|1.5%|11.53|0.40|\n|Sugar|3.1%|3.1%|23.83|0.84|\n|Honey|3.1%|0%|0.00|0.00|\n|Molasses|3.1%|0%|0.00|0.00|\n|Vegetable Oil|2%|2%|15.37|0.54|\n|Soaker|23%|0%|0.00|0.00|\n|Total||130.1%|1000.00|35.09|\n\n\\*\\*Vital Wheat Gluten\n\n*\\*\\*Cracked grain mix at 59% hydration*\n\nThe ingredients are put into a mixing bowl in the order presented, and mixed for about 5 minutes until a shaggy mass is formed. The dough then rests uncovered for 10 minutes. The dough is then kneaded for 5-10 minutes, or until the gluten is well developed. The dough will be quite sticky, and if kneading by hand I\u2019d recommend rubbing your hands/kneading surface with a small amount of oil. I find that the gluten tends to be very well developed by the pulping process, and will sometimes stop kneading early if the dough begins to feel very tight. Target dough temp is 75 F.\n\nRest in an oiled mixing bowl, covered, for 15 minutes. Knead/fold a few more times, then form into a ball and back into the mixing bowl. Rest 20 minutes, covered. Form the ball into a pan loaf, and then place into a greased loaf pan (I used a 1lb aluminized steel USA pan). Cover with greased plastic wrap.\n\nProof for 30-45 minutes. I proof my loaves in a microwave alongside a coffee cup full of freshly boiled water.\u00a0**The key is to not overproof!**\u00a0Poke test at 30 minutes, and keep a close eye on the dough thereafter if not yet ready to bake. This dough proofs extremely quickly, and overproofing will result in a miserably dense and wet crumb. The pictured loaf proofed for about 35 minutes, and was not quite doubled in volume.\n\nSlash diagonally across the loaf, holding the lame perpendicular to the surface of the dough. The slashes should be fairly deep.\n\nBake in a preheated 350 F oven for thirty minutes. A good amount of oven spring should occur. Rotate the pan and bake for a further thirty minutes. I place my pan directly on a half inch baking steel which was preheated in the oven, which I believe helps to firm/set/brown the bottom crust. The bread will temp close to 210 F. There is very little risk of drying out the crumb, so you can take the crust quite dark.\n\nI would also recommend letting the bread cool outside of the pan on a wire rack in the oven with the door cracked to let moisture escape. This will help crisp up the sides and bottom crust and avoid pooched out sides. Let the loaf cool down all of the way to room temperature before slicing.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The primary deviations from the Reinhart recipe are the omission of the molasses, honey, and soaker, and baking at a lower temperature of 350 F instead of Reinhart\u2019s 380 F. The added molasses and sugar contributed good flavor and aided browning, but resulted in a more tacky/sticky crumb that my taste testers did not prefer. I think the soaker is fine to add\u2014I just omitted in an attempt to simplify the recipe and remove variables as I perfected the process and bake. In my experience, baking at the lower temperature resulted in better and more even browning, particularly on the sides and bottom crust.\n* The biggest pitfall in this recipe is overproofing the dough. Reinhart recommends proofing 1 to 1.5 hours and doubling in volume, but I found that every loaf I proofed in that manner fell in the oven and resulted in a very dense, gummy, wet crumb reminiscent of not-very-good brownies. The major breakthrough in this recipe for me was proofing a shorter amount of time in the warm, humid microwave as described above.\n* Work to generate as much tension as possible in the gluten sheath when forming the dough ball into a pan loaf.\n* Sprouting the grains improves the nutritional content and digestibility of the bread.\n* A loaf can finish baking less than three hours from the point that you measure the ingredients, and the grain pulp may be frozen and thawed. This recipe is a good weeknight bake since it can easily be finished between dinner and bedtime.\n* Ezekiel Bread includes additional sprouted grains and beans in the pulp. My recipe focuses on wheat for the sake of simplicity, but future experiments will focus on these additional ingredients.\n* It might be possible to eliminate (or reduce) the vital wheat gluten and the sugar in the recipe. Because the sprouting process converts some starch in the grain into sugar, there is more sugar in the pulp than would be present in a flour-based dough. Eliminating the added sugar might require a longer proofing period if the yeast are less active. Reinhart discusses the necessity of adding the vital wheat gluten to compensate for diminished gluten quality resulting from the sprouting process. However, my experience has been that gluten development is excellent in the pulp, and I suspect supplementing with vital wheat gluten might be unnecessary. Future experiments will focus on reducing these ingredients.\n\nVery happy to answer any questions or hear any feedback. There is\u00a0**very**\u00a0little information on pulp breads available, so I would welcome anyone willing to try the recipe and help advance our collective knowledge!

{"title": "Wood Fired Oven Build Part1 : The Foundation", "selftext": "So here goes.\nI've put the photos in a gallery and for those with a passing interest this will probably suffice as \"Part1\". I'll write in detail below how things went for those looking to learn more and laugh at my cock-ups.\n[Gallery](http://imgur.com/a/5MKGf)\n\nSo a little back story to set the mood:\nMy wife and I started keeping honeybees in Vancouver (Canada) 4 years ago and we recently decided to take a huge gamble and sell up in the city and move to the country. I left a good job doing sound design for video games and figured I'd try my hand at the country life. We've been [here](http://www.honeygrove.ca) for the last 2 years and things couldn't be better. Through a friend of a friend I landed a job at a wood fired bakery in the local town where I've been able to explore my lifelong obsession with bread. We bake in an Alan Scott oven 7.5' deep by 5.5' wide. 40 loaves at a time. Typically 3 loads a day. We have 4 staples (multigrain, 100% wholewheat, rye and white). All 100% organic freestanding sourdough. \nThrough working there I've been inspired to build my own oven on our property. [BreadBuilders](http://www.amazon.com/Bread-Builders-Hearth-Loaves-Masonry/dp/1890132055) has been my guide throughout. Wonderful book for those interested in building ovens, and artisan bread in general.\nDue to the fact I work with a big oven everyday, I found the plans in the book to be too small for what I wanted so I set about enlarging. My oven is going to be another 25-30% bigger than the plans in the book. \nI ended up doing a somewhat detailed drawing in Adobe Illustrator to help get things straight in my head. It helped, but I'm sure it's not necessary. \nHaving decided on the size of the foundation slab and the oven location, both of which seemed to take ages, I set about digging. I cut and screwed the form together with cross pieces in the corners to keep the whole thing square. \nMy form ended up being 100\"x92\"x5.5\" which turns out to be almost exactly 1 square yard. I lined the hole with 6mil poly to stop water seeping up into the concrete and set in 2 rows of re-bar, one 3 inches from the edge and the other 12\" in. I pounded in rebar at the points the lateral re-bar met to set it into the centre of the form. Re-enforcing mesh finished the form off ready for concrete. \nBreadbuilders suggests purchasing and mixing concrete yourself! One yard of concrete was going to take 75 bags of concrete at a price of over $500. Not to mention the time and effort it would take to mix it. I could get a yard delivered for less than half that price and have the job finished in 30 minutes instead of 3 days. Made sense to me.\nI ended up getting a yard of 3/8 stamp mix at 35 MPA with added Fibermesh for strength. For an extra $20 I added some colour to make things a little fancier.\nWe picked a nice sunny day to pour and the whole process (with the truck at least) lasted no more than 30 minutes. Smoothing and edging another hour. Like so many jobs, having the right tools makes things sooooo much easier.\nHaving smoothed and edged we used some rubber matting forms to make a faux stone look into the wet concrete. Once the surface had dried (3 hours on a nice sunny day) we sprayed the top with concrete sealer. 4 hours later I applied a second coat with a paint roller. This keeps moisture in and stops the concrete drying out too quickly. The next day it was dry enough to walk on, though I'll wait another 2 or 3 days before building the walls. That'll be Part2........\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1d1h5c/wood_fired_oven_build_part1_the_foundation/", "created_utc": 1366841894.0, "score": 18, "author": "theullulator", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1d1h5c/wood_fired_oven_build_part1_the_foundation/", "html_title": ""}

It's basically an extension or accompaniment of /r/ArtisanBread, where the educational aspect of sourdough baking is emphasized. \n\nPersonally speaking, the [video](http://www.sourdoughlibrary.org/how-to-videos/) section of the Sourdough Library is the most useful, which contains a list of the best instructive how-to videos I can find on the Internet (to date).\n\nIdeally, I'd like to keep the website free from ads and any solicitations. However, I do have a donation page where funds will go towards website maintenance or funding to open a not-for-profit sourdough \"micro\" bakery in Cambodia, Southeast Asia (where I live now), to support the less fortunate (orphans, disabled, abused women, etc). \n\nHaving said that, I'm not asking any of you to donate. It's absolutely not required or expected. Either way, I will continue to pursue my dream of opening such a bakery. (Wish me luck!)\n\nAnyway, I hope you find the Sourdough Library helpful. If there's anything you think we can do to improve it, please contact me or post below. Thank you! :)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1mph1y/my_hobby_and_ongoing_project_the_sourdough_library/", "created_utc": 1379595105.0, "score": 13, "author": "bakingbadly", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1mph1y/my_hobby_and_ongoing_project_the_sourdough_library/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I live in Florida a few blocks from the ocean, and I'm pretty new to baking sourdough (1 year experience).  I've been trying to dial in my sourdough recipe but its always, always, way too wet.\n\nMy starter is 100% hydration using unbleached white bread flour.  My original starter is from Carl's sourdough, from 1847.  \n\nI have followed several different recipes to the letter and my dough is always way too wet.  It bakes up really well most of the time, with excellent flavor and crumb.  But the rise isn't as high as what is described or what I see on the YouTubes.  And its near impossible to do proper tension pulls because the dough is too wet.  Sometimes I have to use my bench scrapers only to do tension pulls else it'd stick to my hands much too much.  \n\nI dont use Iodized salt and I don't  add the salt first thing either.  I tested my starter before using it and it was good.\n\nThis cant be right, is it?  I mean, even after bulk fermentation and proofing its still really wet.  \n\nI was thinking it maybe has something to do with the high humidity here?  Should I adjust my recipes to use less water?  If so, what % should I lower it by?\n\nAny advice you have would be greatly appreciated.  I know I can be really good at this someday.  I'm just tripping over this one thing right now and it's really frustrating.\n\nThanks fellow bread heads.

Prior to that, they were created as individual posts, which can only be edited by the original poster. Wiki pages, on the other hand, can be edited by all moderators and permitted members.\n\nUpcoming plans:\n\n- create wiki page for submission guidelines;\n- create wiki page for monthly theme challenges;\n- create wiki page called \"Academic Library\"; it will contain a list of scientific reports and articles in portable document format (PDF) related to bread baking, with a link to download all PDFs.\n\nPlease feel free to check out our wiki [index](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/wiki/index) page.

{"title": "What you should know about wheat and flour (X-Post from /r/breadit)", "selftext": "I used to teach a bread baker's crash course, which was a one day class that introduced the basics of bread baking to people that wanted to learn. I created a handout for people to take home and included in it was some information on wheat and flour. This information was taken from certain sources (as noted) and I thought I would share. It's not a comprehensive guide, but hopefully can give some insight\n\n**Wheat Flour**\n\t\n*The Wheat Kernel* \u2013 courtesy of the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee\n\n* Bran - About 14% of the kernel weight. The bran is included in whole wheat flour and is also available separately. The bran contains a small amount of protein, large quantities of the three major B vitamins, trace minerals and dietary fiber -- primarily insoluble. \n* Endosperm - About 83% of the kernel weight and the source of white flour. The endosperm contains the greatest share of protein, carbohydrates and iron, as well as the major B-vitamins such as riboflavin, niacin, thiamin and iron. It is also a source of soluble fiber.\n* Germ - About 2.5% of the kernel weight. The germ is the embryo or sprouting section of the seed, often separated from flour in milling because the fat content (10 percent) limits shelf life. The germ contains minimal quantities of high quality protein and a greater share of B-complex vitamins and trace minerals. Wheat germ can be purchased separately and is included in whole wheat flour.\n\n*Wheat Classes*\n\n* Hard Red Winter Wheat -  The dominant class in U.S. exports and the largest class produced each year. Produced in the Great Plains states, extending from the Mississippi River west to the Rocky Mountains and from Canada to Mexico. Wide range of protein content, good milling and baking characteristics. Used to produce bread, rolls and, to a lesser extent, sweet goods and all-purpose flour. Major foreign buyers include Russia, China, Japan, Morocco and Poland.\n* Hard Red Spring Wheat -  Contains the highest percentage of protein, making it an excellent bread wheat with superior milling and baking characteristics. Majority of crop is grown in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. Exported largely to Central America, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Russia.\n* Soft Red Winter Wheat -  Grown primarily east of the Mississippi River. High yielding, but relatively low protein. Used for flat breads, cakes, pastries, and crackers. Largest customers are China, Egypt and Morocco.\n* Hard White Wheat -  The newest class of wheat to be grown in the United States. Closely related to red wheats (except for color genes), this wheat has a milder, sweeter flavor, equal fiber and similar milling and baking properties. Used mainly in yeast breads, hard rolls, bulgur, tortillas and oriental noodles. Used primarily in domestic markets, although it is exported in limited quantities.\n* Soft White Wheat -  Used in much the same way as Soft Red Winter (for bakery products other than bread). Grown mainly in the Pacific Northwest and to a lesser extent in California, Michigan, Wisconsin and New York. Low protein, but high yielding. Produces flour for baking cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, quick breads, muffins and snack foods. Exported to Far East Asian region.\n* Durum -  The hardest of all U.S. wheat and consistently the class with the lowest export volume, accounting for less than 5 percent of all U.S. wheat exports. Grown in the same northern states as Hard Red Spring, although 70 to 80 percent of the U.S. annual production comes from North Dakota. Used to make semolina flour for pasta production. The largest importer is Algeria.\n\n*Milling Process* \u2013 courtesy of How Baking Works, Paula Figoni\n\nMilling wheat has two purposes. One is to separate the endosperm from the bran and germ. The second is to grind the endosperm as finely as possible without damaging the starch granule. Once the endosperm is finely ground, it is classified in three different ways.\n\n* Straight Flour \u2013 Combines all usable parts of the endosperm including trace amounts of bran and germ. This flour is not often used in the American baking industry, though some bakeries in France use it in breads.\n* Clear Flour \u2013 The lowest grade of flour from the endosperm. Very high in protein content and ash content, though not high in gluten forming proteins. Has a gray color and is often used to strengthen whole grain or rye breads.\n* Patent Flour \u2013 Most common of flours on the market. Uses the inner most part of the endosperm resulting in the highest quality. Contains very little bran and ash content. The following flours are considered patent flours:\n\n1. Bread Flour \u2013 Made from hard red spring or winter wheats. Contains 11-13% protein content, most suitable for high volume bread production.\n2. Hi-gluten Flour \u2013 Generally comes from hard red winter wheats. Contains 13-15% protein, often used to strengthen breads lacking gluten forming proteins.\n3. Artisan Bread Flour \u2013 Relatively new on the market, made from hard red spring wheats, has a lower protein content than bread flour, and is often blended to resemble French wheat flours, which are typically not as strong as American flour. Less protein results in crisper crusts, and large, irregular holes. Although it contains less protein, the protein is of higher quality (produces more gluten).\n4. All-Purpose Flour \u2013 AP flour varies from brand to brand. Often made with a blend of hard and soft wheats, and containing a protein content between 9 - 13%, AP flour can be used for a variety of products. \n5. Pastry Flour \u2013 Made from soft red winter wheat. Has a low protein content between 7-9%, and a high starch content. Higher starch means a more tender product, which is necessary for cookies, muffins, scones, etc.\n6. Cake Flour \u2013 Treated with chlorine and hydrogen peroxide to change the physical make up of the flour. This is essential to break down starches so they are able to absorb more moisture, which is necessary in hi-ratio cakes.\n\n*Aging Process* - courtesy of How Baking Works, Paula Figoni\n\nAfter Flour is milled, it is considered \u201cgreen\u201d flour. Green flour needs to age so that the proteins can oxidize. This helps to create a stronger gluten structure, and makes the dough less sticky and fragile when mixing. There are two ways to age flour:\n\n* Natural Aging \u2013 The flour sits around for a few weeks to a month. Pretty easy. However, it takes up space, can be inconsistent, and can be susceptible to pests. \n* Chemical Aging - \u201cMaturing agents\u201d are used to speed up the aging process. Some maturing agents strengthen, and others weaken the protein structure. Weakening is necessary for pastry and cake flours. Common maturing agents include chlorine, potassium bromate, and hydrogen peroxide. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1b8lxc/what_you_should_know_about_wheat_and_flour_xpost/", "created_utc": 1364561406.0, "score": 9, "author": "None", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1b8lxc/what_you_should_know_about_wheat_and_flour_xpost/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "In need of funding for sourdough bakery in Cambodia", "selftext": "Hello fellow bakers,\n\nI've personally taken on an immense project and need help.\n\nMy name is Zita and I currently live in Cambodia, Southeast Asia. I have been here for nearly 4 years, performing office jobs, and within the last year I have developed a strong interest in sourdough baking.\n\nNow I'm taking the plunge. I'm passionate (crazy) enough to start a sourdough bakery in Cambodia. Thankfully, where I live, we have many foreign residents and tourists that pass through the country. This, I believe, opens the market for sourdough bread. \n\nI've no formal training in a bakery but the executive chef at a 4-star hotel, [Raffles Grand Hotel d'Angkor](http://www.raffles.com/siem-reap/), has kindly offered to train me on bread baking. They are only one of the few hotels in Cambodia that makes their own bread on a daily basis.\n\nMoreover, I have a likely client and perhaps future partner, Chef Michael, who owns and operates [Siem Reap Sandwiches](http://www.siemreapsandwiches.com/chef-michael.html), plus a food catering company, with his wife. Without him and his expertise, I cannot succeed. Thankfully, he has agreed to assist me, free of charge.\n\nHowever, I simply do not have enough funds. With the help of family and relatives, I can pay for the cost of ingredients, water, rent, electricity, and other utilities for several months but fall short on costly pieces of equipment. Multiple trips to Thailand will also be necessary for certain items. Consequently, I've set up a donation page which you can find below:\n\nhttp://www.gofundme.com/sourdough-cambodia\n\nIf you have the time, please visit the link above, share it, and contribute whatever you like. I'm even happy with words of encouragement. It helps me tremendously and is highly appreciated.\n\nFurther, my objective is to open a bakery that provides exceptional bread and aids the less fortunate. I will donate surplus profits to various good causes such as [EGBOK Mission](http://egbokmission.org/projects/). (I know the Country Director of that organization---a man who truly cares about the welfare of the impoverished.)\n\nTo increase public awareness of sourdough and further contribute to the community, I will launch an ongoing \"sourdough campaign\", where I'll bake certain bread products (specialty breads) for a brief period and donate all proceeds of that product to a good cause.\n\nThank you for reading my post. If you have any questions, feedback, or words of support, I'd be much obliged to hear them. Thanks again. :)\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1ok60e/in_need_of_funding_for_sourdough_bakery_in/", "created_utc": 1381907482.0, "score": 10, "author": "bakingbadly", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1ok60e/in_need_of_funding_for_sourdough_bakery_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It didn't even need to be toasted. I'm excited to see how the Saturday Bread is going to do.

{"title": "Tartine Country Loaf Attempt #1 (x-post from r/breadit)", "selftext": "Hey friends,\n\nI'm on a quest for deep flavored sourdough. \n\nI've been growing my own starter for 3 weeks.\n\n2 days ago I used it in the classic Tartine Country loaf recipe that I first found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/1bqr0q/breadit_challenge_country_style_loaves/):\n\n**Recipe**\n\n1kg flour\n\n800g water\n\n200 g levain\n\n15g salt\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1) mix levain, water, flour. 20 min autolyse. \n\n2) Add salt + 70g water. 4hr bulk fermentation with a turn every 40-80 min. \n\n3) Pour onto work surface. Roughly shape into boule. 30 min bench rest. \n\n4) Final shape. Put into well floured bowl or basket. 8hr refrigerated final rise.\n\n5) Bake at 500F. 20 min cover on, 30 min cover off.\n\nand [this](http://imgur.com/a/7NGbs) was the result. \n\n\n**My Thoughts**\n\n* Flavor: The flavor was...meh...okay. The crumb at the edges of the loaf tasted like plain white bread. The crumb towards the center of the loaf had just a *hint* of sour. I suspect my starter isn't old enough yet. And just today I learned about the float test (facepalm), so I\"ll be sure to try that next time around. It didn't taste anything like store-bought sourdough. \n\n* Crumb: very chewy, very dense. It had the proper 'mouth feel' that I was hoping for (almost *gummy*, if that makes sense...). Not as open crumb structure as I would have thought to have had at such a high hydration level. \n\n* Crust: bang-on crackle and toughness. Very pleasant. Need to work on my scoring technique (just ordered a true lame today, so I'll get some practice there.\n\n* Next time: Test starter, score differently, proof in a banneton, perhaps try smaller loaf?\n\nAny feedback or suggestions?\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1c2w1x/tartine_country_loaf_attempt_1_xpost_from_rbreadit/", "created_utc": 1365619546.0, "score": 10, "author": "benbernards", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1c2w1x/tartine_country_loaf_attempt_1_xpost_from_rbreadit/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

That level of hydration for me would barely be solid. I can't really even get 70% hydration to have any structure so far and I'm actively trying to build the gluten network up. Her pictures and video, that looks to me more like somewhere between 65 and 70%, especially considering she lists this as a no-knead dough and really doesn't do anything to the dough in the video. She's got a semi-sold ball when she covers her dough to rest- if I use those measures, it'd fill out the bottom of the bowl in an oobleck-like substance.\n\nSo...what should I adjust here? Should I change the quantities? It's often mentioned that your environment may cause you to need to make adjustments.

Basically you need to feed your starter 2 or 3 times per day for 2 or 3 days in room temperature around 69\u00b0F - 72\u00b0F as soon as your starter becomes extremely active, you have to put it in your fridge 41.0 \u00b0F.\n\nWhen you want to make bread pull out certain amount of your starter and mix with equal parts of water and flour, as soon as become active you can start making bread by keeping the dough at 78 \u00b0F it will ferment faster, you don\u2019t even have to do the folds every 30 / 40 minutes like French dough. \n\nThe dough becomes elastic within minutes when you are mixing; obviously we made the whole process in a professional kitchen with the proper equipment, but I was wondering if you guys tried this.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/346zmt/pain_a_l_ancienne_have_any_of_you_tried_this/", "created_utc": 1430252153.0, "score": 8, "author": "jgustavo85", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/346zmt/pain_a_l_ancienne_have_any_of_you_tried_this/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Finally got some marketing material done", "selftext": "[Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/iOWKq)\n\nI have been procrastinating like a bastard for months with regards to these. I used the laser cutter at the local makerspace to engrave some linoleum tile I found behind an abandoned house. Well, the engraving sort of worked, sort of didn't. By the time I got around to increasing the depth in the stamps, the laser cutter was out of commission (someone cut the wrong kind of composite...) so I had to hand carve to the depth I needed. \n\nIt also took me a long time to find someone who could supply the bags. You can sort of see that they have the window on the other side. They're very nice bags. :) The idea is that I can fold the end lip, then fold the logo, then tape the bag shut. The loaves then sit on the shelf/in the basket/whatever with the window forward and the logo on the top.\nI will see how they work. If I really don't like it, I will just hand carve some new stamps because I've had enough practice at this point (6 varieties) that I feel confident I can print off a template and do it that way. If I get a good response from people, then I will just hold off until the laser cutter gets fixed and I can prototype a few other designs before settling one that's a little better fit for the bags. I'm thinking I might put the logo on one side of the window with the bread name and ingredients on the other side. We'll see.\nI'll try to remember to update this with some pictures of the bread in the bags tomorrow.\n\nWhen I started this business, I never had the intention of selling retail.

It seems to happen mostly when the other guy at work bakes it, I just want to figure out why. It could be that he isn't giving it enough steam at the beginning of the bake, maybe? He slashes it with a blade, I use a bread knife, maybe he isn't cutting at an angle or not deep enough?\n\nSometimes it splits as shown in the picture, but more often it splits at the bottom, creating ugly protrusions from the sides. \n\nI also wonder if it has something to do with the temperature of the dough, I tend to let it sit out of the fridge in the morning for half an hour or so before I bake it but I have no idea what temperature it should be.

Either way the loaf comes out great.  If I don't knead it right away, but instead let it autolyse overnight covered on the counter, the next day it's turned into an extremely liquidy mess.  When poured onto the counter to attempt kneading it almost spills out like liquid.  No matter what amount of attempted kneading occurs from this point on will fix it.

I took some advice from a few from both communities and wanted to share. Here are the steps that I did:\n\n* Scaled ingredients\n* Autolysed water, starter, and flour for 10 minutes\n* Combined salt, sugar, and oil together and incorporated this into the autolysed dough. The salt and sugar really helped the oil incorporate into the dough without the dough just sliding around in the mixer.\n* Developed on high speed for 5 minutes.\n* Bulk ferment for 3 hours, performing a stretch and fold after the first and second hour.\n* Divided into two, rolled into boule shapes, and retarded overnight.\n* Made pizza the following day.\n\nThe improvements were drastic. The dough was still a bit sticky because of its high hydration, but it didn't feel as gummy. Dough had a great balance of elasticity and extensibility and held it's shape during the bulk ferment. Last but not least, it had great flavor. I even made a [baby focaccia](http://imgur.com/a/yNien) with extra dough.\n\nAnd, of course, I posted the final results to /r/pizza [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pizza/comments/1agcjt/sourdough_pizza_looks_much_better_this_time/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1agdo7/success_with_sourdough_pizza_formula_thanks_to/", "created_utc": 1363504005.0, "score": 6, "author": "None", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1agdo7/success_with_sourdough_pizza_formula_thanks_to/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Where many designs have wood storage beneath the oven chamber, that is instead where you would make the fire. The fire would be towards the front and beneath the oven chamber. Heat would carry across the bottom of the oven chamber/cooking surface, up behind the cooking surface, over the top of the chamber, then vent through a chimney above and at the front of the cooking chamber. Here is a mockup I quickly sketched: https://imgur.com/gallery/XKkQL\n\nBenefits I can think of are: easier to keep clean, more radiant heat for people sitting around the oven, better viewability of fire, easily tend to the fire.\n\nDisadvantages might be: less even heat inside oven chamber, oven chamber will not get as hot (by how much I have no idea), not as much \"top\" heat but definitely more \"bottom\" heat (good or bad? may be minimized by modification of the rear heat-transfer gap and a smaller oven chamber or varying the insulation in different parts of the oven)\n\nAnyone have input on this?

It\u2019s no longer available and such a shame because it was so good! It was just called \u201cWood Oven Bread\u201d. \nI\u2019m using my *limited* bread making knowledge to narrow down the ingredients and method to get me something as close to it as possible. \nThis bread was a large white boule, with a super thick, chewy crust and bottom (blackened from the wood oven\ud83d\ude0d) and very big, glossy looking bubbles. The crumb was chewy (not fluffy or soft) and had very delicious flavour but not a sourdough, I\u2019m pretty sure it was yeasted! It was the kind of bread that you had to dig your teeth into and tear, so good. \nThe only bread making I usually do is our weekly no knead sourdough and an occasional pizza, focaccia or ciabatta, so this is a challenge for me. \nI know without my own wood oven my results might not ever be just right, but here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried so far:\n\nI\u2019ve been doing an overnight ferment in the fridge because that seems to get the flavour closer to what I remember. \nI started out using a 12.6% protein flour, but found it didn\u2019t have the chew I remember.\nNow I\u2019ve switched to a 14% protein flour, and that definitely has the chew I remember (and the crust was yummy and thick) but I kneaded it in the stand mixer rather than going stretch and folds and found it was really sticky, I just couldn\u2019t make it workable and ended up adding more flour. The flavour and chew of that loaf was good, but the crumb was extremely tight with no medium or large bubbles.\nMy suspicion is that the loaf will need to be a higher hydration than my last attempt, maybe I just need to up my bread handling game?\nI\u2019ve been doing them in the Dutch oven, but maybe they would benefit from a dry heat?\nI have at my disposal: a good oven, a stand mixer, a pizza stone, a Dutch oven, and the basic bread making tools! \nIf you\u2019ve read all of that I\u2019m so grateful, I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019d suggest trying!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1jik55h/please_help_me_recreate_my_favourite_childhood/", "created_utc": 1742796601.0, "score": 1, "author": "lilly_sim", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/1jik55h/please_help_me_recreate_my_favourite_childhood/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Feedback on easy-artisan bread product", "selftext": "Dear fellow bakers, \n\nFor last few months I have been working on a product to make artisan baking at home easier for everyone. No-knead bread needs no introduction in this forum, but with our product LoafNest, we take it further to no-shaping and no-cleanup. You just pour the dough into the perforated silicone liner that sits inside an uniquely shaped cast iron casserole. Perforated glass reinforced silicone (similar to Silpat, but with holes) offers low thermal insulation and allows equal browning on all sides. Of course, it eliminates the need of using cornmeal or other release agents.\n\nWe hope that people who are currently buying premium bread or people who currently use bread machines will like our product. We are trying to lower the barrier to enter home bread making.\n\nWe plan to launch a Kickstarter campaign in a few weeks but before that, I thought it may be a good idea to present it to baking enthusiasts for feedback. You can find more details on http://trfl.nl/LoafNest and see images on http://trfl.nl/loafnest-gallery [yes, there is a crumb picture :) ] \n\n* What do you think of the general idea of this product? \n* What do you think of the way the story is explained? Any suggestions to change/improve the message? \n* What are your thoughts about pricing? This will not be an ultra-cheap product since perforated silicone is quite high-tech and expensive.\n\nI will be grateful to your feedback as a fellow bread making enthusiast.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/7nlhcw/feedback_on_easyartisan_bread_product/", "created_utc": 1514886078.0, "score": 0, "author": "trfl_nl", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/7nlhcw/feedback_on_easyartisan_bread_product/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I know a picture isn't much to go by but hopefully it can be some help... I can say right off the bat that the shape is bad. I tried to make it into a boule shape as best I could but one little crack kept appearing (slightly visible in the top left corner) that I couldn't seem to seal without excessive handling that would have made even more cracks. The dough cracked on other places too while it was cooking. Maybe from how I handled the dough shortly before baking (I had to transfer it from the flat pan I was handling it in to my hot la cloche that had been cooking in the oven by itself at 450 degrees, as I've seen people recommend, so I sorta scooped up the dough and just plopped it in as best I could without touching the cloche). Haven't tasted it yet (waiting for some friends to come over and try it with me), but it sure smells good! The internal temperature registered a little high. My thermometer clocked it at an even 200 degrees, instead of the 190 that the recipe said it should be at...though I might not have stuck the thermometer exactly in the center.

Once per week, I'm going to bake loaves in a CSA-style program. Ideally, I would have them come to pick up their items within a few hours of baking. But that's not realistic. \n\nI would like to keep them crusty for as long as possible for my customers. My idea was to place them in a semi-warm oven to minimize the humidity around them, until they are sold. Of course, the issue with this is that my oven's lowest temperature is 170F, and I don't want to turn my loaves into rocks. Another idea was to run a dehumidifier in the kitchen. \n\nAny ideas are welcome!\n\nAlso, how do brick and mortar bakeries do it in high humid areas? Does running the ovens all day simply dry out the air for them, or is there some other trick they are using?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanBread/comments/2s3k0g/how_to_store_bread_before_selling/", "created_utc": 1421013204.0, "score": 2, "author": "None", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/ArtisanBread/comments/2s3k0g/how_to_store_bread_before_selling/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
