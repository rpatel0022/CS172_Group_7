{"title": "One of Kenji\u2019s recipes may have saved my mom\u2019s life", "selftext": "In December 2021, my mom began acting strange. She was forgetful. She kept falling over. She got lost a lot. One thing lead to another and she had an MRI on a Friday afternoon. On Monday morning, we were told she had a golf ball sized brain tumor right smack in the middle of her fourth ventricle of her brain. We were sent home to wait for a call for a neurosurgeon and were told to go to the hospital if \u201cshe gets worse\u201d although \u201cworse\u201d wasn\u2019t quite clear. It turns out sitting around with a known brain tumor frankly sucks, so I was trying to think of literally anything to take my mom\u2019s mind off stuff. \n\nBefore the tumor, she loved to try my cooking. I was self-taught, primarily from Serious Eats and Kenji\u2019s videos, and she always loved picking out a new Kenji recipe for me to make. That day she picked the Peruvian chicken but of course I didn\u2019t have any fresh cilantro so I loaded her in my car (couldn\u2019t leave the lady with the giant brain tumor home alone) and off we went to the grocery store. As we\u2019re wandering through the store getting cilantro and the mayo I\u2019d forgotten we were out of, I started noticing her strange walk. At home as she was moving from room to room it wasn\u2019t as obvious but here in the store she was walking on her toes and pitching forwards. It was very clear in the herb section of the grocery store that something was very not right. \n\nLong story short, my mom\u2019s love for Kenji\u2019s recipes made her choose the Peruvian chicken instead of letting us just get takeout which would have been the normal response following a surprise brain tumor diagnosis. This led us to the grocery store for cilantro where I noticed the change in her walking. This led to a call to her doctor, a 2-hour drive to Stanford hospital, and then an emergency craniotomy with brain tumor resection which, after some complications, was a total of 3 weeks in the hospital. It turned out her CSF flow in her brain was blocked by the tumor and led to the dangerously high pressures in her brain. If we hadn\u2019t noticed her walking at the grocery store, her outcome would have been very very different. \n\nAs it worked out, she survived. She made a full recovery. She loves to remind us that Kenji saved her life. And now she\u2019s got a taste for the recipes from The Wok so it\u2019s Kung Pao Chicken this week :)\n\n(Also the Peruvian chicken is amazing and unless there\u2019s an emergent need for brain surgery I would 100% recommend making it)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/12091i6/one_of_kenjis_recipes_may_have_saved_my_moms_life/", "created_utc": 1679632153.0, "score": 2944, "author": "BeautifulLetterhead", "num_comments": 67, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/12091i6/one_of_kenjis_recipes_may_have_saved_my_moms_life/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I'd suffered from anorexia most of my life, and it was especially bad when I was in my late teens-early twenties. What helped me get better was discovering a love of cooking mostly based on Kenji's recipes on Serious Eats. I developed skills and knowledge in the kitchen and came to be known among my friends and family as a very good cook. It made me very proud! I also reached a healthy weight.\n\nThen, about four years ago I got divorced and began living by myself. And the pandemic happened. And depression settled in. Once I was only cooking for myself, I just didn't have much motivation anymore. The ED came roaring back and for the past year or so, I've been struggling to get myself to eat. \n\nA few days ago, I was talking to my therapist and mentioned I enjoyed the involved, informed nature of his recipes, how I would feel so relaxed when cooking, and how it made me realize the joy of food. So I pulled out my copy of *The Food Lab* and decided to make biscuits and gravy, one of my favorite recipes from the book. For the first time in a very long time, I actually ate a whole portion of food. Then I made the easy weeknight chili and have been eating it for lunches at work (which I usually skip). Tonight, I'm tackling the meatballs and red sauce. \n\nI'm feeling so much better already and just more excited about life in general. Cooking is pulling me out of my ED and deep depression. I'm so thankful.\n\nI plan to get *The Wok* maybe next month when I have the money to do so.

{"title": "When plagiarism and copyright violation leads to a $30k charity donation.", "selftext": "Just a quick story I want to share that starts with plagiarism and copyright violation and ends with $30,000 donated to help fight hunger in America.\n\nA few weeks ago, a Twitter user brought to my attention that a book sold on Amazon, The Essential Sous Vide Cookbook, contained recipes that were copied directly from articles I'd written for Serious Eats. As it turns out, I wasn't the only one ripped off. The book also contained recipes and directly copied passages from [Meathead](http://www.AmazingRibs.com), [Chefsteps](http://www.chefsteps.com), and [Andrew Zimmern](http://andrewzimmern.com/). It had been sold on Amazon for about a year and was the number one book on Sous Vide cooking at the time.\n\nI contacted the publisher, Callisto Media, to let them know about this problem. They seemed as surprised as we were about it, claiming that they use software to vet books for plagiarism or copyright violations, but this one had somehow slipped through. In the interest of resolving this as amicably as possible, I suggested that they simply pull the book from Amazon and that they donate 100% of the profits they'd earned on the book thus far to a charity of our choice.\n\nThankfully, they agreed.\n\nThe publishers were 100% transparent with their accounting and sales numbers. Less their publishing and marketing expenses, the book had earned around $27k, which they rounded up to $30k. Just last week that money was donated to [No Kid Hungry](http://www.nokidhungry.org/), an amazing organization dedicated to working to ensure that no child in the U.S. goes hungry. So far they've served 775 million meals to children across the country.\n\nMeathead, the team at Chefsteps, Andrew, and I could not be happier with how this all turned out and I want to thank the folks at Callisto Media for not just acknowledging the problem, but for dealing with it swiftly and transparently.\n\nAnd if you are looking for a great organization to donate to (before tax season!), please take a look at No Kid Hungry and what they do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/7utxku/when_plagiarism_and_copyright_violation_leads_to/", "created_utc": 1517600666.0, "score": 1526, "author": "J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt", "num_comments": 78, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/7utxku/when_plagiarism_and_copyright_violation_leads_to/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

My kids complain every time we do delivery and only want the Serious Eats Deep Dish Pizza. They are deeply disappointed if we do delivery and I don't cook \"Kenji Pizza\".\n\nKenji has become a household name and the vast majority of recipes I cook are from Serious Eats. The kids know they like those recipes and if I make something new, they want to know if its a \"Kenji recipe\". I recently made something from a different web site that they absolutely loved. They were floored and a bit dismayed when I explained it was NOT a \"Kenji recipe\".\n\nRecently the topic of the James Beard Award came up and I explained to them what it was. My daughter immediately suggested I \"enter the contest\" and felt very confident I would win. Serious Eats has made me a culinary hero to my kids which is no small feat. I'm a big fish in a very, very, small pond but I'll take it.\n\nAll I can say is thank you. Cooking for a family can be tough but Serious Eats helps me deliver restaurant quality food to my family that they are always happy with. If they challenge me on new food I can simply tell them it is a \"Kenji recipe\" and they will embrace it, try it, and almost always like it. \n\nTo me its so cool that my kids love my cooking so much. In reality they love Kenji's cooking and the recipes and things I have learned have gone a long way in making my life easier.

{"title": "My trove of lower calorie Serious Eats Recipes!", "selftext": "Hey everyone! I was inspired to post this by the thread requesting healthier recipes. I log all my food though a calorie counting app and have entered in tons of Serious Eats recipes over the last year. Here are some of my favorites that are filling and relatively light! I hope this helps someone - I\u2019ve been successfully losing weight for the last four months without compromising flavor or satisfying foods. My goal is 1750 a day as a 5\u20197\u201d active woman in her late 20s. \n\nTo any recipe writers who see this and disagree with the reduced sugar/oil, with all due respect, tough titties! I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t as good, but I\u2019m just out here doing my best. \n\nThis all assumes whole wheat pasta.\n\nPeruvian chicken with green sauce - just go light on the green sauce. I treat the sauce recipe as 16 servings at 54 cal each if you use light Mayo. It is amazing with saut\u00e9ed bell peppers and onions and a corn tortilla on the side!\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/peruvian-style-grilled-chicken-with-green-sauce-recipe\n\nEsquites is 120 cal for one of six servings. I love it on romaine with chicken or steak and extra lime juice! Avocado for an even more delicious meal. https://www.seriouseats.com/esquites-mexican-street-corn-salad-recipe\n\nShakshuka is only 216 cal for each delicious serving (if 6 servings). Add a hearty slice of crusty bread and you\u2019re to about 350. https://www.seriouseats.com/shakshuka-north-african-shirred-eggs-tomato-pepper-recipe\n\nFood Lab Pasta alla norma is about 500 cal for each of 6 servings. Cut the EVOO at your own risk - it will make the eggplant significantly less tasty, and life is short! https://www.seriouseats.com/sicilian-style-pasta-with-eggplant-tomatoes-ricotta-salata-pasta-alla-norma-recipe\n\nKenji\u2019s Takeout style kung pao chicken is less than 300 cal for each serving if you call it 6 servings and cut the oil to 1T. Throw it on 100g of brown rice and that\u2019s 410. https://www.seriouseats.com/takeout-style-kung-pao-chicken-diced-chicken-peppers-peanuts-recipe\n\nSpicy Stir Fry Beef with Leeks and Onion is under 350 a serving and very filling if you double the meat and halve the oil and sugar. https://www.seriouseats.com/easy-stir-fried-beef-leeks-onions-recipe\n\nThai Style Marinated Flank Steak Salad is 475 cal for each of 6 servings if you halve the sugar (I promise it still tastes good!) https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-style-marinated-flank-steak-and-herb-sal\n\nFood Lab Puttanesca is 477 cal for each of 6 servings: https://www.seriouseats.com/spaghetti-puttanesca-pasta-week-capers-olives-anchovies-recipe\n\nSpicy Peanut Noodle Salad with veggies is 499 cal for each of four servings: https://www.seriouseats.com/spicy-peanut-noodle-salad-with-cucumbers-red-peppers-recipe\n\nTriple Garlic Pasta with Tomatoes, Olives and Breadcrumbs is 573 cal for each of 6 servings, and could easily be less by cutting some EVOO https://www.seriouseats.com/pasta-oven-dried-tomato-olive-bread-crumb-recipe\n\nSkillet Pasta with Mushrooms Pancetta and Greens is 457 cal for each of 6 servings https://www.seriouseats.com/pasta-pancetta-shiitake-mushrooms-parmesan-recipe\n\nShoutout to u/Acceptable_Ad3732 for the inspiration!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/xf533c/my_trove_of_lower_calorie_serious_eats_recipes/", "created_utc": 1663268987.0, "score": 752, "author": "knitlikedefarge", "num_comments": 60, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/xf533c/my_trove_of_lower_calorie_serious_eats_recipes/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Help with Stella's jelly roll", "selftext": "I made Stella's jelly roll yesterday to bring to a picnic today. I've made her yule log in the past so was fairly comfortable with the foil-cooling method and the rolling. It was a success after rolling and when I had a test slice, it was light, tender, fluffy - just wonderful. \n\nHowever, this morning when I checked on it, it had absorbed the jam and turned soggy, wet and dense. What happened? The recipe said to wrap the cake in plastic so I did, but maybe I shouldn't have? The only other thing I can think of is maybe the foil took off too much of the outer \"skin\" of the cake, allowing it to absorb too much moisture? When I peeled off the foil once the cake had cooled, almost all of the brown skin came off on the foil, leaving the pale yellow open crumb exposed to the jam. Could this be the issue?\n\nI made the cranberry jam according to her recipe and it didn't seem runny to me, it was pretty thick and chunky.\n\nWould appreciate any suggestions/insight on how to prevent this from happening in the future, as this was a delicious and easy cake and I'd love to make it again!\n\nPictured - my swiss roll in its brief moment of beauty \n\n[https://www.seriouseats.com/old-fashioned-jelly-roll](https://www.seriouseats.com/old-fashioned-jelly-roll)", "url": "https://i.redd.it/oljjdmfqymve1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745001040.0, "score": 15, "author": "GallantBluebird", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1k2c1e9/help_with_stellas_jelly_roll/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Leftover ribeye and kimchi fried rice", "selftext": "Inspired by The Wok p287. \n\nMy toxic trait is that in a fried rice, I never cook ingredients separately, set them aside and recombine at the end. For me, fried rice is about dumping a bunch of leftovers in a pan over high heat. I'm sure I'm burning the garlic as a result, but I just don't want to be that precious with fried rice.\n\nThat said, I did follow the technique from The Wok of pressing all the juice out of the kimchi and dicing it up. Then the diced dry-pressed kimchi gets added with the other veggies, and the reserved kimchi juice gets added later with the sauce.\n\nI really liked it: getting a sear on the kimchi really helped, and so did coating everything in steaming kimchi juice later on.\n\nSo, order of operations roughly:\n\n1. Fry diced garlic, diced ginger, couple diced shallots, 3 diced Thai bird chiles that I had been pickling in the fridge. \n\n2. Add the diced dry-pressed kimchi. \n\n3. Once the above has gotten a sear: Add most of a carton of leftover rice from Indian takeout.\n\n4. Once the rice is cooked: Add in four slices of leftover ribeye from a steakhouse, diced up. This is at the end because I really just wanted to heat it up, not cook it further. The tradeoff is you don't really render the fat on the steak. I guess you could cut off the fatty bits and start them earlier, but again: Not precious. \n\n4.5. At this point, added a bit of salt and a good amount of black pepper. There's a line in The Wok about sesame oil and black pepper going together like Bert and Ernie (or something?). I see what he means.\n\n5. (Pretty much right away) Pour in the reserved kimchi juice\n\n6. Then 2 tsp fish sauce, 1 tsp toasted sesame oil. I picked these because it's the sauce from The Wok's spam+kimchi fried rice and I was worried about sauces clashing with the kimchi juice. This worked great.\n\n7. Cut the heat and add a few chopped cilantro leaves.\n\n8. Serve with fried egg on top. I think the crispy egg fried in olive oil would be more thematically appropriate. But I really like a sunny side up egg lightly fried in butter with fried rice because it's easier to cut into little pieces with a fork and get a little egg in every bite.\n\nSo this turned out great.

I think so, but curious if there's a reason not to.\n- Then should I deglaze the searing pan with a bit of the wine to pick up the frond?\n- For the wine and chicken stock -- should I combine the wine + chicken stock + gelatin first, and then [reduce by half as Kenji mentioned in this Pressure-Cooker adapted version](https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/97wy7w/adapting_the_all_american_pot_roast_recipe_to_a/e4c1l9v/)? I guess the idea would just be to pour this mixture over the beef/veggies in the CrockPot, before I leave for the day? Is it necessary to reduce the liquids by half, if they're gonna be in the slow cooker all day anyway?\n- For the umami bombs (soy sauce/tomato paste/anchovies/marmite) -- should I throw these in the CrockPot at the beginning too, or wait till the end of the process?\n\nI would also plan on adding the potato chunks at the end of the process too, and cranking the heat up to \"High\" for the final 30~45 minutes until the potatoes are fork tender. Or I would just make mashed potatoes on the side, or something.

{"title": "Has Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt gotten coarser or are my measuring spoons wildly inaccurate?", "selftext": "I think general consensus on the internet is that DCK weighs about 2.8g (2.85g is what I read somewhere) and some round it up to 3g - I presume for simplicity's sake, and then a tablespoon weighs 8.4-8.5g.\n\nI've seen Serious Eats' initial testing on measuring spoons, and being all about accuracy, I bought the RSVP International Set a few years back and had them shipped to me in the UK. A pretty penny for some spoons, but I thought \"What the hell - it'll be worth it in the long haul\". \n\nI haven't bought DCK in ages because the price seemed extortionate here for what is, basically, a box of a salt (albeit one with a nice crystal size). However, I have up fighting the urge and bought a box a few weeks back. I know of the whole rebranding and reenvisioning of the salt over in the US, and sure enough, this box arrived using the new design.\n\nNow, maybe I'm imagining incorrectly, but I've used these spoons for ages now, and I swear I remember my DCK measurements being spot on to the amounts as mentioned on the internet - 0.7g for a \u00bc teaspoon/2.8g for a teaspoon. However, this new box has thrown me. \n\nI'm aware that the RSVP set has now been found to be a bit inaccurate on the teaspoon, and there's some other inaccuracies a bit on the other spoons, but not massively enough for SE to not reccomend it (unfortunately, Sur La Table and Cusipro sets are either not available here or \u00a332 ($40-ish? I'm not paying that, thanks Amazon). However, my DCK measurements on a gram scale are consistently throwing up 2.6 grams for a teaspoon, 7.2-7.4g for a tablespoon, and like 0.5g for a \u00bc teaspoon. Pointing specifically at the \u00bc teaspoon and tablespoon, they are massive discrepancies that can mount up. \n\nSo I'm wondering - do I need a new set of spoons or is it the salt? It does seem to feel coarser, but that might be me imagining it - I've been using fine sea salt for ages because it's over half the price for 25% more salt per box - it feels massively different to pick up and sprinkle. \n\nIf it's the spoons, has anyone done any personal testing on the accuracy of European spoons (preferably UK, if there's also anyone in the sub-reddit from here).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1ioz064/has_diamond_crystal_kosher_salt_gotten_coarser_or/", "created_utc": 1739495938.0, "score": 33, "author": "Top-Hat-608", "num_comments": 65, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1ioz064/has_diamond_crystal_kosher_salt_gotten_coarser_or/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Here's a detailed breakdown of what I've done and the challenges I'm facing:\n\n1. Followed the recipe exactly and used a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. The dough seemed crumbly at first, so I added a couple of teaspoons of water and mixed it on low for about 45 minutes total (checking periodically). I also tried using the dough hook at one point, but it didn\u2019t seem to help, so I switched back to the paddle.\n2. Eventually, I was able to knead it by hand in the bowl and got it to form a relatively smooth ball. It felt like it had come together, although it was still slightly crumbly at the edges.\n3. Divided the dough into two disks, wrapped them, and chilled them overnight as per the instructions.\n4. The next morning, I let the dough sit out for about 30 minutes before trying to roll it out to the specified 15 x 15-inch size. When I rolled it out, it kept crumbling and falling apart once I got close to the edges or reached the desired size. It felt like it just wasn't holding together well enough to handle the rolling process.\n5. Out of frustration, I gathered the dough back together into a ball, rewrapped it, and put it back in the fridge.\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering:\n\n* Did I undermix or overmix the dough?\n* Was the water addition a mistake, or should I have added more?\n* Could the issue be with the flour-to-fat ratio, or is this normal for this type of pastry dough?\n* Any tips for getting this dough to roll out properly without crumbling apart?\n\nI\u2019ve had great success with other *BraveTart* recipes, but this one has me stumped.

In my experience, it can be downright hostile being a party of one seated at a table. Yesterday was a prime example: I was in the area of a diner I really like around lunchtime, so I stopped in. It was crowded, with no spots at the counter, but I stood in line to put my name in. The couple in front of me were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. Me? 45 minutes. When I politely declined, saying I'd try again later, she acted like I was unreasonable, \"A spot might open at the counter sooner.\" Could there have been a legitimate reason why a there was a gap of a half hour between two available tables? Sure. Was I made to feel like I was a burden for asking for a table for one? Absolutely.\n\nAnd this happens all the time, even when it's not busy. What made me stop even asking for a table for one was in 2019 I went to a restaurant and the host grabbed a few menus and started to walk to the backroom and asked how many. \"One.\" He looked at me, looked at the open seats behind him, looked back at me, put the menus away, and said \"It'll be another 90 minutes.\" He did not take me name, and immediately sat the couple that was behind me with me still waiting there in disbelief.\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences? To those involved with in the restaurant industry, how much do you hate solo diners taking up a table?

{"title": "Attempts at Baked Mac in The Food Lab by Kenji Lopez-Alt keeps breaking", "selftext": "I make a killer stovetop mac. I can't make a baked mac without it breaking/its never creamy or gooey. My roommate got Kenji-Lopez-Alt's The Food Lab. I tried his recipe (fourthed) and it still broke.\n\nThis is basically the same recipe as the book, except it looks like she changed his 45/15 minute cook time to 30/10 minute.\n\n[https://thefeedfeed.com/danielagerson/the-best-baked-mac-and-cheese](https://thefeedfeed.com/danielagerson/the-best-baked-mac-and-cheese)\n\n I have a few ideas of what I can change, but they all seem like a reach.\n\n1. I fourthed his recipe, but did the full bake time (45 mins with tin foil cover, 15 mins without at 375). Edit\\* Really starting to think this is the most likely reason. Gonna try 20 covered, 5 broiled.\n2. I used the reccommended amount of velvetta (which I hate doing but I use it for the sodium citrate) but his recipe also calls for sharp cheddar and I've been using smoked cheddar and smoked gouda. Both cheeses are not aged and don't seem like dry cheeses, but maybe there is something about smoking cheeses that makes them break easier?\n3. Maybe I just suck at making a roux/bechamel/mornay. I melt butter, whisk in flour slowly before the butter browns, then whisked in a combination of evaporated milk and whole milk (the recipe does say to do evaoporated milk first now that I look at it), slowly, maybe not slowly enough, but feel like it was...,turned up the burner so the bechamel bubbled a little bit (definitely not a hard boil), turned it off and added the cheeses (valvetta first). The mixture looked like a good thick, well incorporated mornay when it was finished.\n\nI think the cook time/temp is the most likely calprit, heating up the sauce to the degree where it breaks. Or should mac n cheese sauces be able to be 375 degrees without breaking? What does baking a backed mac n cheese do? What's the difference between baking a mac vs just making a stovetop mac, pouring it into a baking dish, sprinkling some breadcrumbs and shredded cheese on top and putting it under the broiler for a couple minutes?\n\nDoes anyone do the full 45/15 at 375 and have results where its not breaking?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1ht4lx4/attempts_at_baked_mac_in_the_food_lab_by_kenji/", "created_utc": 1735959215.0, "score": 44, "author": "hetnkik1", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1ht4lx4/attempts_at_baked_mac_in_the_food_lab_by_kenji/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Update: Do you really need to marinate sauerbraten?", "selftext": "Follow-up to the original post, linked here, in which I asked the community if, given what we know about marinades, the traditional 3-14 day marinade in a vinegar-rich liquid was a truly necessary step when creating German pickled beef, aka Sauerbraten. \n\nThe general consensus at the time was a resounding yes, but reasons given were varied.  Some claimed it would increase tenderness, others said the vinegar flavor would penetrate the meat, while others claimed it would change the texture or taste in various other ways. Crucially, it was claimed, none of these changes would occur during the final braising process itself, which is why the marinade was essential in the first place. \n\nFor those that have never eaten Sauerbraten, it\u2019s a traditional dish made by marinating (some say pickling) a cheap, tough, lean cut of beef such as top or bottom round for several days in a vinegar-rich liquid that\u2019s often flavored with aromatics such as onions, herbs, and spices. Then the meat is braised in the marinade, either before or after some or all of the aromatics are discarded, until tender throughout.  Finally it is sliced, and ginger snaps, pumpernickel, or other thickeners are added to the marinade-turned-braising liquid as it is reduced to a rich and sharply-flavored gravy. \n\nBecause marinade flavors are not said to penetrate deeper than a millimeter or two into meat, and vinegar is typically claimed to turn meat either too mushy or to tough (depending on your source) if it remains in contact for more than a couple hours, I wondered if the marinade step was really that important, perhaps even detrimental. Because the final dish would be served in a gravy made from the marinade itself, I knew flavor wouldn\u2019t be lost overall, but did it perform some other function to the final dish that was essential to the experience?\n\nThis is my family\u2019s go-to Christmas meal, and this year I volunteered to cook it since my German uncle, who usually does it, was unable to join us. I braised two roasts in the same Dutch oven, except one spent three days in the marinade beforehand while the other was dropped in fresh. Cutting to the chase, the texture and flavor of each roast were indistinguishable from one another, even to my father, who was born and raised in Germany and has been enjoying this meal every Christmas since his mom, our Oma, used to make it. \n\nThis was not a scientific experiment, and there were a few elements which very well could have skewed the outcome in my favor. The unmarinated roast was slightly the thinner of the two, possibly allowing deeper penetration in less time. I also cooled both roasts in the braising liquid overnight before slicing, reheating, and serving, which effectively allowed the unmarinated roast to sit in the marinade for several hours after it had been cooked, which could have allowed for extra flavor transfer or acid-enhanced tenderization. \n\nThe marinated roast had a slightly darker color on the outside, and I tasted a sample from the very outside edge of both cuts immediately after removing them from the brine. I expected the outside of the marinated beef to have a stronger vinegar flavor, which it did, but not by a huge margin in my opinion. When adding a dash of braising liquid to each sample, they were impossible to tell apart. \n\nUltimately, if I were to make this dish again and couldn\u2019t marinate for more than three days, especially if I felt confident that everyone would partake of the vinegary gravy, I\u2019d be reasonably confident that no one would be able to tell if I skipped the marination step altogether.\n\nBut we\u2019re talking about big, round cuts of beef, and I\u2019m still very curious whether or not a more lengthy marination - up to two weeks or so - would indeed produce a final product that\u2019s noticeably different to one that skipped the marination step entirely. Even if the marinade didn\u2019t fully penetrate the meat after all that time, I wonder if the antimicrobial, preservative effects of the vinegar on the outside of the beef would actually give the interior enough time for its own enzymes to start breaking itself down, similar to what starts to happen after 2-3 weeks of dry aging. I\u2019m really interested in this possibility. \n\nI\u2019m exhausted from Christmas and won\u2019t have the energy to do any of these tests myself for some time, especially if I\u2019m going to take pains reducing more variables, and document the process in notes and photographs in an attempt to convince everyone here that I\u2019m not just making all this up.\n\nThanks for reading anyway, and I hope someone out there found this mildly interesting, and that everyone else\u2019s holiday meals were a success as well!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/s/BJNCi2yzOE", "created_utc": 1735230358.0, "score": 32, "author": "PrtzAltoid", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1hmrtu6/update_do_you_really_need_to_marinate_sauerbraten/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Prime Rib Roast 911!!!", "selftext": "I came across J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's Serious Eats standing prime rib roast recipe and tried it out yesterday with a 2-rib 5.5 lb roast. The internal starting temp was 29 degrees. After 8+ hours in a 150 degree oven it was only up to 109. I panicked and increased the oven temp to 250, after which the internal temp rose to 123 in 30 min. I should have increased the oven temp sooner but I kept thinking (hoping!) the internal temp would start to rise more quickly than it did, and I wanted to avoid the \"gray ring\". I pulled it at 123, tented with foil and after an hour the internal temp had risen to 137 - I was shooting for 135 for med-rare. By this time it was just too late, so I quick-cooled in an ice bath in a large zip-lock bag and refrigerated. \n\nSo, here we are at day 2. I've read to reheat in a 250 degree oven until it's about 7-10 degrees below the desired temp, then sear at 550. Per J. Kenji's directions, at 250 it should take 3.5 to 4 hrs. My big question is at what internal temp should I pull? 120? I assume I should again rest for at least 30 min? And how much will the internal temp rise during the final blast at 550? I was shooting for a finished temp of 135 and it has already risen 2 degrees above. This thing was expensive and I sure don't want to ruin it! \n\nNOTE: I cooked a prior smaller 2-bone 3+lb rib roast in a 250 degree oven. After 1.5 hours the internal temp was 125 and I pulled but after resting it was too rare/raw. Put it back in for a bit, rested again, seared and it came out nicely, although it did have the \"gray ring\".

{"title": "Do you really need to marinate sauerbraten?", "selftext": "I\u2019d like to make my family a traditional German sauerbraten for Christmas this year, and every recipe online mandates a lengthy vinegar-heavy marinade anywhere from 3 days up to 2 weeks. \n\nHowever Tim Chin\u2019s article on marinades, and Daniel Gritzer\u2019s piece on marinating beef before stewing both claim that while the salt in a marinade will act like a brine, little else will penetrate the meat - leaving me to wonder, what\u2019s the point?  Would a dry-brine followed by a vinegar-rich braise not accomplish the same thing while freeing up space in my fridge for several days?\n\nLiterally every source online claims the marinade is crucial for sauerbraten, but the science suggests otherwise. Has anyone attempted a dish like this without the marination step and, if so, what were the results?\n\nLook forward to hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m receiving several comments about how the marinate is more for tenderizing the meat rather than flavoring it. However, sauerbraten is a big roast, and I can\u2019t find any resources which state that acids penetrate further into the meat than any of the flavoring components. \n\nFurthermore, all sauerbraten recipes I\u2019ve seen will instruct you to braise the roast for several hours. Surely a long braise will tenderize the meat more thoroughly, obviating the need for a week-long acid bath if that\u2019s just supposed to do the same thing?\n\nAnd even if the marinade was about infusing flavor, the marinade becomes the braising liquid, and then gets reduced to a gravy, which should overpower and mask any flavor that makes it into the top surface of the meat. \n\nIf I\u2019m missing anything, I\u2019d love to hear about it, and I\u2019ll try to keep an open mind.

{"title": "Food lab chocolate chip cookie question", "selftext": "So I\u2019ve made the food lab chocolate chip cookie recipe probably a dozen times at least. They always taste delicious (browned butter is amazing). The texture is always great (crunch with some softness inside in the middle).\n\nBut they have never, ever looked like the pictures - the pictures always show this beautiful kind of fat-ish cookie with a cross section of a flattened oval with rounded edges, whereas mine are always thin and shaped more like a contact lens (very thin edges). I don\u2019t mind it exactly as the thin edges are very crunchy. \n\nFurthermore, the pictures show lots of craggy cracks and a rough texture - looks like a dried riverbed I guess. And the instructions specifically mention to take the dough balls and tear them in half and to smash them together again with the a torn side facing up to help achieve that final texture, but\u2026 while I do that step it seems pretty pointless, since several minutes into baking my cookies are always just completely melted puddles - literally zero original shape or texture would be retained.\n\nWas wondering if other people have had this happen consistently and what the fix is. \n\nAs far as I know I\u2019m following the instructions 100% accurately - I\u2019m not doing any \u201cI didn\u2019t have eggs so I substituted buttermilk\u201d shenanigans.

In addition, I've heard that you can infuse the flavor into oils or buy seasonings/spices that are close replications for the flavor. That's all great.

How do I replace what the onions are doing here?\n\nIf anyone has explored this, would love to know. I am planning to try Fennel Bulbs (if they agree with the IBS), non-green bell peppers, carrots (for blended sauces), and/or celery.

{"title": "Looking for some advice....", "selftext": "Okay, so hear me out, because this one gets tricky quick.  I am looking for ideas that do not fit my normal cooking style in order to meal prep for my wife.  I'm a pro-level chef; I can cook anything, so all thoughts are welcome.  But there are rules, and it's just beyond my brain to parse them out.  Hoping someone here with similar tastes can assist.  This is to take to school, and I am just at a loss:\n\n\n1: processed foods are widely preferred, unless it's chicken, and then that should be fresh.  Beans from a tin beat beans from a bag.  Store sauce is better than homemade.  That sort of thing.  \"Tastes too fresh.\"\n\n\n2: vegetables are pretty yucky in general, but definitely yucky if cooked and cold. \n\n\n3: it has to be cold, there is no microwave or other oven available.  See above for why this is starting to drive me insane. \n\n\n4: it's five days a week, I don't want to prep five entirely different things, so I want to be able to kind of play the street hustler \"cup game\" with ingredients. \n\n\n5: rice is yucky, but yellow rice is okay.  She has also eaten basmati and jasmine, but only while hot.\n\n\n6: cured and smoked meats are yucky except for pepperoni (because I haven't had the heart to tell her).\n\n\n7: there must be meat.  Dishes without meat are edible, but they are \"not food\".\n\n\n8: after all this nonsense, it's actually fine if different things touch. \n\n\n9: unless touching makes something wet that shouldn't be.  Our containers have three parts, though.\n\n\n10: meat preference is chicken.  All other meats are yucky cold and \"become too fatty\" (I don't know exactly what this means).  Meats that will never be okay include pork, turkey, salume, pastrami; pretty much just chicken.  Tofu is not a meat but also not okay, and fish and shrimp are a no go as well, except tinned tuna.\n\n\n11: there are more rules, but I won't put you guys any further through the wringer.  If you can give me any ideas, even if it's a little off, I can adjust it I'm sure.  I'm losing my mind trying to adjust to such a specific palate with the added detail of wanting something different each day.

So I was very excited when a store that is all about corn, MAiiZ Nixtamal, opened up in downtown Victoria (https://maiiz.ca/about/). One of the things they sell is locally made nixtamal, the undried, unground, corn kernels that come right out of the nixtamalizatoin process.

Recipe link below\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/tacos-al-pastor-recipe\n\nHello!

{"title": "2nd Place Win at the Chili Cookoff! (Best Chili Recipe success report)", "selftext": "Hey folks! I asked a bit ago about advice on the Best Chili Ever recipe, including my idea of swapping out the Vinegar for some roasted Tomatillos from my garden as well as serving it beanless (or beans on the side), and I wanted to say it came out really nicely. What a wild ride that recipe is!\n\nPeople were right, you can't \"taste and modify\" as you go along with this one, and it really needs to come together. I let it rest overnight before the competition and it was perfect the next day.\n\nI got second place in the competition, which was a pretty great showing for over 20 entrants and mine was the only 'spicy' chili and the only one not using ground beef. The winning one, just a bit ahead, was sweeter and more generic, but third place and below were more than 10 votes behind us, so this was absolutely a winner. It was also the only one that was totally emptied out.\n\n[https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chili-recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chili-recipe)\n\n-- Alterations:\n\n**Swapped Vinegar for Garden Tomatillos:** The fresh picked tomatillos worked wonderfully to add the necessary acidic zing without tasting vinegary, and I think my calculations were correct that about 3 large ripe tomatillos provide the same PH shift as the 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar while keeping the flavor less vinegary. I do not like a vinegar flavor to my chili. I cut them in half and broiled them to slightly to soften them up. Blackening their tops does not impart a \"smoke\" flavor but does make them more interesting.\n\n**Swapped Ghost Pepper for Pequin:** I could not find any of the small \"just for hotness\" peppers listed anywhere, which was very disappointing, but I do grow a lot of spicy peppers. I picked a nice red Ghost Pepper and used that. After toasting it slightly under the broiler (creating home-made pepper spray) I added it to the blender and mixed it all up together.\n\nI chose the Ghosts because of the flavor. I had the choice between Caribbean Red Habaneros and Ghost Peppers and chose the Ghost because it has a much fruitier flavor (as opposed to a citrus tang of a Habanero or the smoky, nutty flavor of arbol) that I thought would go well, and I think it did. I wanted to follow Kenji's advice and avoid the \"smoke\" flavored peppers and balance the flavor profiles of my various peppers, onions, and spices as best I could.\n\n**Swapped Dried New Mex for Fresh Hatch Chiles:** I wanted to use New Mexico chiles but didn't find any dried ones that looked decent. Since I grow my own Red Hatch varieties I used a bunch of those. De-seeded and blackened in the broiler to soften them, then cooked in the broth pot with my Ancho peppers. Worked well.\n\n-- Notes:\n\n**Got to use my fancy spices!** I really enjoyed a chance to use some fancy spices. Star Anise is always fun to use, and I also had some \"Afghan Mountain Wild Cumin\" which was awesome to grind up for this, very cool and complex cumin. For the chocolate I used some Mexican stone-ground chocolate which worked *very very well* and for the coffee I just used one of my nice espressos, which also worked well.\n\n**Marmite, seriously?** I was very 'lucky' to have some marmite around from a flight where I nearly starved to death and had to pay the airline for food, but the only thing available were jars of marmite. I get why it's used in the recipe but holy smokes, you have to be a dedicated cook to keep marmite around just for one teaspoon for chili. I'd love to find an alternative!\n\n-- Recommendations:\n\nLike other folks say, you can use chuck roast for this. Short Ribs are just *too expensive* to be realistic for a 'production model' of the Best Chili recipe.\n\nI would also recommend increasing the number of peppers used, but keep the proportions similar because it's a really great balance he struck. This way you can top off your pot without needing to use water and you get that *chile con carne* vibe of beef swimming in pepper broth. I ended up cooking and boiling like an extra 12 red Hatch chiles and the rest of my bag of dried Ancho. I did not add an extra Ghost Pepper though.\n\nI also recommend ditching the Buffalo sauce. I did a taste test in a side bowl and I don't think that stuff adds anything, at least not to mine, it just tastes so commercial and fake. Maybe it adds some heat if you were using a less spicy pepper base, but I would rather let people add their preferred hot sauce to the bowl than adulterate such a nice chili with Buffalo sauce.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1ftt8wk/2nd_place_win_at_the_chili_cookoff_best_chili/", "created_utc": 1727802372.0, "score": 92, "author": "LunarGiantNeil", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1ftt8wk/2nd_place_win_at_the_chili_cookoff_best_chili/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The next year it happened again, he got a fine, and fixed the \u201cproblem\u201d permanently. My friend got 2 \u201cham\u2019s\u201d and gave me one (along with a bunch of deer steaks). I accepted because i\u2019ve never tried either before, and at this point i believe it\u2019s better to eat it (use it) then throw it away.  Would have been better to find a different solution.

Caviar, truffle & uni may constitute one course, but the just wine can cost more than the entire meal. \n\nWhy is wine the alcohol of choice for all fine dining experiences ?\n\nI recognize that a well developed palate can differentiate between types of wines and each type of wine has its place. But, does wine really age finely ? Once you reach the point of 'good wines' around the $50 bottle mark (might even be lower), I struggle to identify 'improvement' in wines. Differences sure, but it feels more like an examination than enjoyment. I have my preferences for what style of wine pairs with one type of food. But, past modest price point, the quality seems related to how fancy the wine is.\n\nA vast number of people & chefs whose tastes I respect, are obsessed with wines. So, I don't want to be dismissive. What are they looking for ? At the top of their craft, the food items are some of the most experimental and finely constructed contraptions, but the drinks are just...wine ? The idea that drink pairings should belong from this narrow family of grape-based alcohols seems so limited. \n\nOn an honest note, there's plenty of alcohols I prefer more than wine, straight out of the bottle or after creative efforts of a mixologist.

{"title": "I made a mushroom variant of the Black Bean Burgers", "selftext": "I didn't have any feta or peppers on hand, but felt like making the black bean burgers tonight anyway.\n\nAs someone who usually orders any burger with mushrooms on it, I figured I'd try taking it in a different direction. It worked out great!\n\nFrom the [original recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-black-bean-burger-recipe), I made the following changes:\n\n- no peppers at all (poblano or chipotle), no adobo, no cheese in the patties\n- sub in shallots for onions. Shallots and mushroom are just a staple pairing.\n- I rehydrated a 0.5oz package of dehydrated shiitake and tossed them in whole with the beans in the food processor\n- I also added some truffle salt someone gifted me to the mix because why not. I don't put truffle in much these days but I think it added something. Either way the mix needs more seasoning to make up for the loss of the peppers and feta.\n\nMy version of the recipe: https://recipes.gnocchi.biscuits.club/cl7caqkjo0005ixi7yhe5jojq/0533d0b\n\nThe resulting patties have a more versatile flavor than the original, with a recognizeable note of mushroom coming through as the main flavor next to the beans themselves. Minimal change in texture, maybe slightly drier but still great and hold together well.\n\nHaving gotten that far I realized I would probably need to also tweak the toppings. I tossed together a haphazard attempt at a Parmesan aoili which served well enough, plus cheese and lettuce. If I had more time I might have caramelized some onions. Brie would have been nice, I'll have to plan ahead next time.\n\nOverall, I recommend trying it if you're not big on the southwestern bias of the original. Part of the appeal of this recipe for me is it's reliance on pantry staples, and dehydrated mushrooms fit in nicely with that ethos.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1e7l23w/i_made_a_mushroom_variant_of_the_black_bean/", "created_utc": 1721442031.0, "score": 24, "author": "A-Type", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1e7l23w/i_made_a_mushroom_variant_of_the_black_bean/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Leftover ribeye and kimchi fried rice", "selftext": "Inspired by The Wok p287. \n\nMy toxic trait is that in a fried rice, I never cook ingredients separately, set them aside and recombine at the end. For me, fried rice is about dumping a bunch of leftovers in a pan over high heat. I'm sure I'm burning the garlic as a result, but I just don't want to be that precious with fried rice.\n\nThat said, I did follow the technique from The Wok of pressing all the juice out of the kimchi and dicing it up. Then the diced dry-pressed kimchi gets added with the other veggies, and the reserved kimchi juice gets added later with the sauce.\n\nI really liked it: getting a sear on the kimchi really helped, and so did coating everything in steaming kimchi juice later on.\n\nSo, order of operations roughly:\n\n1. Fry diced garlic, diced ginger, couple diced shallots, 3 diced Thai bird chiles that I had been pickling in the fridge. \n\n2. Add the diced dry-pressed kimchi. \n\n3. Once the above has gotten a sear: Add most of a carton of leftover rice from Indian takeout.\n\n4. Once the rice is cooked: Add in four slices of leftover ribeye from a steakhouse, diced up. This is at the end because I really just wanted to heat it up, not cook it further. The tradeoff is you don't really render the fat on the steak. I guess you could cut off the fatty bits and start them earlier, but again: Not precious. \n\n4.5. At this point, added a bit of salt and a good amount of black pepper. There's a line in The Wok about sesame oil and black pepper going together like Bert and Ernie (or something?). I see what he means.\n\n5. (Pretty much right away) Pour in the reserved kimchi juice\n\n6. Then 2 tsp fish sauce, 1 tsp toasted sesame oil. I picked these because it's the sauce from The Wok's spam+kimchi fried rice and I was worried about sauces clashing with the kimchi juice. This worked great.\n\n7. Cut the heat and add a few chopped cilantro leaves.\n\n8. Serve with fried egg on top. I think the crispy egg fried in olive oil would be more thematically appropriate. But I really like a sunny side up egg lightly fried in butter with fried rice because it's easier to cut into little pieces with a fork and get a little egg in every bite.\n\nSo this turned out great.

The texture of the meat will almost certainly end up different, but hopefully still satisfying. My biggest questions are about the liquids used, and when/how to add specific ingredients.\n\nI would still plan on searing the chuck roast in the morning, to get that Maillard flavor.... But:\n\n- Should I also brown the carrots/onions/celery a bit too? I think so, but curious if there's a reason not to.\n- Then should I deglaze the searing pan with a bit of the wine to pick up the frond?\n- For the wine and chicken stock -- should I combine the wine + chicken stock + gelatin first, and then [reduce by half as Kenji mentioned in this Pressure-Cooker adapted version](https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/97wy7w/adapting_the_all_american_pot_roast_recipe_to_a/e4c1l9v/)? I guess the idea would just be to pour this mixture over the beef/veggies in the CrockPot, before I leave for the day? Is it necessary to reduce the liquids by half, if they're gonna be in the slow cooker all day anyway?\n- For the umami bombs (soy sauce/tomato paste/anchovies/marmite) -- should I throw these in the CrockPot at the beginning too, or wait till the end of the process?\n\nI would also plan on adding the potato chunks at the end of the process too, and cranking the heat up to \"High\" for the final 30~45 minutes until the potatoes are fork tender. Or I would just make mashed potatoes on the side, or something. From previous experience: putting the potatoes in with the other ingredients for 8+ hours results in a very soupy potato slurry, which is not really what I'm going for.\n\nThanks in advance for any tips/advice!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1j9nr5g/adapting_the_allamerican_pot_roast_recipe_for_a/", "created_utc": 1741796095.0, "score": 29, "author": "oatmealfoot", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1j9nr5g/adapting_the_allamerican_pot_roast_recipe_for_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Has Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt gotten coarser or are my measuring spoons wildly inaccurate?", "selftext": "I think general consensus on the internet is that DCK weighs about 2.8g (2.85g is what I read somewhere) and some round it up to 3g - I presume for simplicity's sake, and then a tablespoon weighs 8.4-8.5g.\n\nI've seen Serious Eats' initial testing on measuring spoons, and being all about accuracy, I bought the RSVP International Set a few years back and had them shipped to me in the UK. A pretty penny for some spoons, but I thought \"What the hell - it'll be worth it in the long haul\". \n\nI haven't bought DCK in ages because the price seemed extortionate here for what is, basically, a box of a salt (albeit one with a nice crystal size). However, I have up fighting the urge and bought a box a few weeks back. I know of the whole rebranding and reenvisioning of the salt over in the US, and sure enough, this box arrived using the new design.\n\nNow, maybe I'm imagining incorrectly, but I've used these spoons for ages now, and I swear I remember my DCK measurements being spot on to the amounts as mentioned on the internet - 0.7g for a \u00bc teaspoon/2.8g for a teaspoon. However, this new box has thrown me. \n\nI'm aware that the RSVP set has now been found to be a bit inaccurate on the teaspoon, and there's some other inaccuracies a bit on the other spoons, but not massively enough for SE to not reccomend it (unfortunately, Sur La Table and Cusipro sets are either not available here or \u00a332 ($40-ish? I'm not paying that, thanks Amazon). However, my DCK measurements on a gram scale are consistently throwing up 2.6 grams for a teaspoon, 7.2-7.4g for a tablespoon, and like 0.5g for a \u00bc teaspoon. Pointing specifically at the \u00bc teaspoon and tablespoon, they are massive discrepancies that can mount up. \n\nSo I'm wondering - do I need a new set of spoons or is it the salt? It does seem to feel coarser, but that might be me imagining it - I've been using fine sea salt for ages because it's over half the price for 25% more salt per box - it feels massively different to pick up and sprinkle. \n\nIf it's the spoons, has anyone done any personal testing on the accuracy of European spoons (preferably UK, if there's also anyone in the sub-reddit from here).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1ioz064/has_diamond_crystal_kosher_salt_gotten_coarser_or/", "created_utc": 1739495938.0, "score": 26, "author": "Top-Hat-608", "num_comments": 65, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1ioz064/has_diamond_crystal_kosher_salt_gotten_coarser_or/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Here's a detailed breakdown of what I've done and the challenges I'm facing:\n\n1. Followed the recipe exactly and used a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. The dough seemed crumbly at first, so I added a couple of teaspoons of water and mixed it on low for about 45 minutes total (checking periodically). I also tried using the dough hook at one point, but it didn\u2019t seem to help, so I switched back to the paddle.\n2. Eventually, I was able to knead it by hand in the bowl and got it to form a relatively smooth ball. It felt like it had come together, although it was still slightly crumbly at the edges.\n3. Divided the dough into two disks, wrapped them, and chilled them overnight as per the instructions.\n4. The next morning, I let the dough sit out for about 30 minutes before trying to roll it out to the specified 15 x 15-inch size. When I rolled it out, it kept crumbling and falling apart once I got close to the edges or reached the desired size. It felt like it just wasn't holding together well enough to handle the rolling process.\n5. Out of frustration, I gathered the dough back together into a ball, rewrapped it, and put it back in the fridge.\n\nAt this point, I'm wondering:\n\n* Did I undermix or overmix the dough?\n* Was the water addition a mistake, or should I have added more?\n* Could the issue be with the flour-to-fat ratio, or is this normal for this type of pastry dough?\n* Any tips for getting this dough to roll out properly without crumbling apart?\n\nI\u2019ve had great success with other *BraveTart* recipes, but this one has me stumped.

In my experience, it can be downright hostile being a party of one seated at a table. Yesterday was a prime example: I was in the area of a diner I really like around lunchtime, so I stopped in. It was crowded, with no spots at the counter, but I stood in line to put my name in. The couple in front of me were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. Me? 45 minutes. When I politely declined, saying I'd try again later, she acted like I was unreasonable, \"A spot might open at the counter sooner.\" Could there have been a legitimate reason why a there was a gap of a half hour between two available tables? Sure. Was I made to feel like I was a burden for asking for a table for one? Absolutely.\n\nAnd this happens all the time, even when it's not busy. What made me stop even asking for a table for one was in 2019 I went to a restaurant and the host grabbed a few menus and started to walk to the backroom and asked how many. \"One.\" He looked at me, looked at the open seats behind him, looked back at me, put the menus away, and said \"It'll be another 90 minutes.\" He did not take me name, and immediately sat the couple that was behind me with me still waiting there in disbelief.\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences? To those involved with in the restaurant industry, how much do you hate solo diners taking up a table?

{"title": "Attempts at Baked Mac in The Food Lab by Kenji Lopez-Alt keeps breaking", "selftext": "I make a killer stovetop mac. I can't make a baked mac without it breaking/its never creamy or gooey. My roommate got Kenji-Lopez-Alt's The Food Lab. I tried his recipe (fourthed) and it still broke.\n\nThis is basically the same recipe as the book, except it looks like she changed his 45/15 minute cook time to 30/10 minute.\n\n[https://thefeedfeed.com/danielagerson/the-best-baked-mac-and-cheese](https://thefeedfeed.com/danielagerson/the-best-baked-mac-and-cheese)\n\n I have a few ideas of what I can change, but they all seem like a reach.\n\n1. I fourthed his recipe, but did the full bake time (45 mins with tin foil cover, 15 mins without at 375). Edit\\* Really starting to think this is the most likely reason. Gonna try 20 covered, 5 broiled.\n2. I used the reccommended amount of velvetta (which I hate doing but I use it for the sodium citrate) but his recipe also calls for sharp cheddar and I've been using smoked cheddar and smoked gouda. Both cheeses are not aged and don't seem like dry cheeses, but maybe there is something about smoking cheeses that makes them break easier?\n3. Maybe I just suck at making a roux/bechamel/mornay. I melt butter, whisk in flour slowly before the butter browns, then whisked in a combination of evaporated milk and whole milk (the recipe does say to do evaoporated milk first now that I look at it), slowly, maybe not slowly enough, but feel like it was...,turned up the burner so the bechamel bubbled a little bit (definitely not a hard boil), turned it off and added the cheeses (valvetta first). The mixture looked like a good thick, well incorporated mornay when it was finished.\n\nI think the cook time/temp is the most likely calprit, heating up the sauce to the degree where it breaks. Or should mac n cheese sauces be able to be 375 degrees without breaking? What does baking a backed mac n cheese do? What's the difference between baking a mac vs just making a stovetop mac, pouring it into a baking dish, sprinkling some breadcrumbs and shredded cheese on top and putting it under the broiler for a couple minutes?\n\nDoes anyone do the full 45/15 at 375 and have results where its not breaking?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1ht4lx4/attempts_at_baked_mac_in_the_food_lab_by_kenji/", "created_utc": 1735959215.0, "score": 47, "author": "hetnkik1", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1ht4lx4/attempts_at_baked_mac_in_the_food_lab_by_kenji/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Update: Do you really need to marinate sauerbraten?", "selftext": "Follow-up to the original post, linked here, in which I asked the community if, given what we know about marinades, the traditional 3-14 day marinade in a vinegar-rich liquid was a truly necessary step when creating German pickled beef, aka Sauerbraten. \n\nThe general consensus at the time was a resounding yes, but reasons given were varied.  Some claimed it would increase tenderness, others said the vinegar flavor would penetrate the meat, while others claimed it would change the texture or taste in various other ways. Crucially, it was claimed, none of these changes would occur during the final braising process itself, which is why the marinade was essential in the first place. \n\nFor those that have never eaten Sauerbraten, it\u2019s a traditional dish made by marinating (some say pickling) a cheap, tough, lean cut of beef such as top or bottom round for several days in a vinegar-rich liquid that\u2019s often flavored with aromatics such as onions, herbs, and spices. Then the meat is braised in the marinade, either before or after some or all of the aromatics are discarded, until tender throughout.  Finally it is sliced, and ginger snaps, pumpernickel, or other thickeners are added to the marinade-turned-braising liquid as it is reduced to a rich and sharply-flavored gravy. \n\nBecause marinade flavors are not said to penetrate deeper than a millimeter or two into meat, and vinegar is typically claimed to turn meat either too mushy or to tough (depending on your source) if it remains in contact for more than a couple hours, I wondered if the marinade step was really that important, perhaps even detrimental. Because the final dish would be served in a gravy made from the marinade itself, I knew flavor wouldn\u2019t be lost overall, but did it perform some other function to the final dish that was essential to the experience?\n\nThis is my family\u2019s go-to Christmas meal, and this year I volunteered to cook it since my German uncle, who usually does it, was unable to join us. I braised two roasts in the same Dutch oven, except one spent three days in the marinade beforehand while the other was dropped in fresh. Cutting to the chase, the texture and flavor of each roast were indistinguishable from one another, even to my father, who was born and raised in Germany and has been enjoying this meal every Christmas since his mom, our Oma, used to make it. \n\nThis was not a scientific experiment, and there were a few elements which very well could have skewed the outcome in my favor. The unmarinated roast was slightly the thinner of the two, possibly allowing deeper penetration in less time. I also cooled both roasts in the braising liquid overnight before slicing, reheating, and serving, which effectively allowed the unmarinated roast to sit in the marinade for several hours after it had been cooked, which could have allowed for extra flavor transfer or acid-enhanced tenderization. \n\nThe marinated roast had a slightly darker color on the outside, and I tasted a sample from the very outside edge of both cuts immediately after removing them from the brine. I expected the outside of the marinated beef to have a stronger vinegar flavor, which it did, but not by a huge margin in my opinion. When adding a dash of braising liquid to each sample, they were impossible to tell apart. \n\nUltimately, if I were to make this dish again and couldn\u2019t marinate for more than three days, especially if I felt confident that everyone would partake of the vinegary gravy, I\u2019d be reasonably confident that no one would be able to tell if I skipped the marination step altogether.\n\nBut we\u2019re talking about big, round cuts of beef, and I\u2019m still very curious whether or not a more lengthy marination - up to two weeks or so - would indeed produce a final product that\u2019s noticeably different to one that skipped the marination step entirely. Even if the marinade didn\u2019t fully penetrate the meat after all that time, I wonder if the antimicrobial, preservative effects of the vinegar on the outside of the beef would actually give the interior enough time for its own enzymes to start breaking itself down, similar to what starts to happen after 2-3 weeks of dry aging. I\u2019m really interested in this possibility. \n\nI\u2019m exhausted from Christmas and won\u2019t have the energy to do any of these tests myself for some time, especially if I\u2019m going to take pains reducing more variables, and document the process in notes and photographs in an attempt to convince everyone here that I\u2019m not just making all this up.\n\nThanks for reading anyway, and I hope someone out there found this mildly interesting, and that everyone else\u2019s holiday meals were a success as well!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/s/BJNCi2yzOE", "created_utc": 1735230358.0, "score": 36, "author": "PrtzAltoid", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1hmrtu6/update_do_you_really_need_to_marinate_sauerbraten/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Prime Rib Roast 911!!!", "selftext": "I came across J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's Serious Eats standing prime rib roast recipe and tried it out yesterday with a 2-rib 5.5 lb roast. The internal starting temp was 29 degrees. After 8+ hours in a 150 degree oven it was only up to 109. I panicked and increased the oven temp to 250, after which the internal temp rose to 123 in 30 min. I should have increased the oven temp sooner but I kept thinking (hoping!) the internal temp would start to rise more quickly than it did, and I wanted to avoid the \"gray ring\". I pulled it at 123, tented with foil and after an hour the internal temp had risen to 137 - I was shooting for 135 for med-rare. By this time it was just too late, so I quick-cooled in an ice bath in a large zip-lock bag and refrigerated. \n\nSo, here we are at day 2. I've read to reheat in a 250 degree oven until it's about 7-10 degrees below the desired temp, then sear at 550. Per J. Kenji's directions, at 250 it should take 3.5 to 4 hrs. My big question is at what internal temp should I pull? 120? I assume I should again rest for at least 30 min? And how much will the internal temp rise during the final blast at 550? I was shooting for a finished temp of 135 and it has already risen 2 degrees above. This thing was expensive and I sure don't want to ruin it! \n\nNOTE: I cooked a prior smaller 2-bone 3+lb rib roast in a 250 degree oven. After 1.5 hours the internal temp was 125 and I pulled but after resting it was too rare/raw. Put it back in for a bit, rested again, seared and it came out nicely, although it did have the \"gray ring\". But I'll stick to this in the future, as apparently my oven is one of those that cannot properly hold a 150 temp. \n\nTIA for any thoughts/suggestions!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1hmp99l/prime_rib_roast_911/", "created_utc": 1735222808.0, "score": 0, "author": "IleneW", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1hmp99l/prime_rib_roast_911/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Would a dry-brine followed by a vinegar-rich braise not accomplish the same thing while freeing up space in my fridge for several days?\n\nLiterally every source online claims the marinade is crucial for sauerbraten, but the science suggests otherwise. Has anyone attempted a dish like this without the marination step and, if so, what were the results?\n\nLook forward to hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m receiving several comments about how the marinate is more for tenderizing the meat rather than flavoring it. However, sauerbraten is a big roast, and I can\u2019t find any resources which state that acids penetrate further into the meat than any of the flavoring components. \n\nFurthermore, all sauerbraten recipes I\u2019ve seen will instruct you to braise the roast for several hours. Surely a long braise will tenderize the meat more thoroughly, obviating the need for a week-long acid bath if that\u2019s just supposed to do the same thing?\n\nAnd even if the marinade was about infusing flavor, the marinade becomes the braising liquid, and then gets reduced to a gravy, which should overpower and mask any flavor that makes it into the top surface of the meat. \n\nIf I\u2019m missing anything, I\u2019d love to hear about it, and I\u2019ll try to keep an open mind.

They always taste delicious (browned butter is amazing). The texture is always great (crunch with some softness inside in the middle).\n\nBut they have never, ever looked like the pictures - the pictures always show this beautiful kind of fat-ish cookie with a cross section of a flattened oval with rounded edges, whereas mine are always thin and shaped more like a contact lens (very thin edges). I don\u2019t mind it exactly as the thin edges are very crunchy. \n\nFurthermore, the pictures show lots of craggy cracks and a rough texture - looks like a dried riverbed I guess. And the instructions specifically mention to take the dough balls and tear them in half and to smash them together again with the a torn side facing up to help achieve that final texture, but\u2026 while I do that step it seems pretty pointless, since several minutes into baking my cookies are always just completely melted puddles - literally zero original shape or texture would be retained.\n\nWas wondering if other people have had this happen consistently and what the fix is. \n\nAs far as I know I\u2019m following the instructions 100% accurately - I\u2019m not doing any \u201cI didn\u2019t have eggs so I substituted buttermilk\u201d shenanigans.

Too much liquid - the recipe calls for 1 cup of white wine and 3 cups of chicken stock, all of which makes the dish into more like a broth or soup than a chicken with a sauce. A lot of people have commented that there is way too much liquid at the end and I found that to be the case also for me. I would reduce the amount of liquid used to 1-2 cups only, or alternatively, use canned tomato instead of stock to produce a more viscous and flavorful sauce. \n\n2.

Recently, my household has been hit with a slew of dietary restrictions due to Celiacs disease (me) and IBS diagnosis (my partner).   \n  \nOnions (and garlic to a lesser extent) just destroy my partner's stomach. I have googled a bunch, and have learned that the green parts of most aromatics might be good alternatives. In addition, I've heard that you can infuse the flavor into oils or buy seasonings/spices that are close replications for the flavor. That's all great. However, I keep thinking about how onions, in particular, add a lot of texture to the dishes that they are in.  \nI am planning to experiment, but when I am making a thick sauce, like in a serious eats butter chicken recipe, what would be a good onion substitute? I have tried making the butter chicken recipe without onions/garlic. Besides the taste/acidity being off, even with added cashews, I could not get the consistency right.\n\nThen, I think of dishes like Chicken Tinga where blackened, quick-seared onion ribbons make up a substantial body of the dish as well. How do I replace what the onions are doing here?\n\nIf anyone has explored this, would love to know. I am planning to try Fennel Bulbs (if they agree with the IBS), non-green bell peppers, carrots (for blended sauces), and/or celery.

{"title": "Looking for some advice....", "selftext": "Okay, so hear me out, because this one gets tricky quick.  I am looking for ideas that do not fit my normal cooking style in order to meal prep for my wife.  I'm a pro-level chef; I can cook anything, so all thoughts are welcome.  But there are rules, and it's just beyond my brain to parse them out.  Hoping someone here with similar tastes can assist.  This is to take to school, and I am just at a loss:\n\n\n1: processed foods are widely preferred, unless it's chicken, and then that should be fresh.  Beans from a tin beat beans from a bag.  Store sauce is better than homemade.  That sort of thing.  \"Tastes too fresh.\"\n\n\n2: vegetables are pretty yucky in general, but definitely yucky if cooked and cold. \n\n\n3: it has to be cold, there is no microwave or other oven available.  See above for why this is starting to drive me insane. \n\n\n4: it's five days a week, I don't want to prep five entirely different things, so I want to be able to kind of play the street hustler \"cup game\" with ingredients. \n\n\n5: rice is yucky, but yellow rice is okay.  She has also eaten basmati and jasmine, but only while hot.\n\n\n6: cured and smoked meats are yucky except for pepperoni (because I haven't had the heart to tell her).\n\n\n7: there must be meat.  Dishes without meat are edible, but they are \"not food\".\n\n\n8: after all this nonsense, it's actually fine if different things touch. \n\n\n9: unless touching makes something wet that shouldn't be.  Our containers have three parts, though.\n\n\n10: meat preference is chicken.  All other meats are yucky cold and \"become too fatty\" (I don't know exactly what this means).  Meats that will never be okay include pork, turkey, salume, pastrami; pretty much just chicken.  Tofu is not a meat but also not okay, and fish and shrimp are a no go as well, except tinned tuna.\n\n\n11: there are more rules, but I won't put you guys any further through the wringer.  If you can give me any ideas, even if it's a little off, I can adjust it I'm sure.  I'm losing my mind trying to adjust to such a specific palate with the added detail of wanting something different each day.

Recipe link below\n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/tacos-al-pastor-recipe\n\nHello! I am in charge of Saturday night dinner for a ladies weekend for 9 omnivores and 5 variations of vegetarians/vegans, and I immediately thought of doing a taco bar as an easy way to accommodate a group with a lot of food preferences/allergies, with the added benefit of using condiments for breakfasts etc. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve made the tacos al pastor recipe, but I remember it being pretty damn phenomenal.

{"title": "2nd Place Win at the Chili Cookoff! (Best Chili Recipe success report)", "selftext": "Hey folks! I asked a bit ago about advice on the Best Chili Ever recipe, including my idea of swapping out the Vinegar for some roasted Tomatillos from my garden as well as serving it beanless (or beans on the side), and I wanted to say it came out really nicely. What a wild ride that recipe is!\n\nPeople were right, you can't \"taste and modify\" as you go along with this one, and it really needs to come together. I let it rest overnight before the competition and it was perfect the next day.\n\nI got second place in the competition, which was a pretty great showing for over 20 entrants and mine was the only 'spicy' chili and the only one not using ground beef. The winning one, just a bit ahead, was sweeter and more generic, but third place and below were more than 10 votes behind us, so this was absolutely a winner. It was also the only one that was totally emptied out.\n\n[https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chili-recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chili-recipe)\n\n-- Alterations:\n\n**Swapped Vinegar for Garden Tomatillos:** The fresh picked tomatillos worked wonderfully to add the necessary acidic zing without tasting vinegary, and I think my calculations were correct that about 3 large ripe tomatillos provide the same PH shift as the 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar while keeping the flavor less vinegary. I do not like a vinegar flavor to my chili. I cut them in half and broiled them to slightly to soften them up. Blackening their tops does not impart a \"smoke\" flavor but does make them more interesting.\n\n**Swapped Ghost Pepper for Pequin:** I could not find any of the small \"just for hotness\" peppers listed anywhere, which was very disappointing, but I do grow a lot of spicy peppers. I picked a nice red Ghost Pepper and used that. After toasting it slightly under the broiler (creating home-made pepper spray) I added it to the blender and mixed it all up together.\n\nI chose the Ghosts because of the flavor. I had the choice between Caribbean Red Habaneros and Ghost Peppers and chose the Ghost because it has a much fruitier flavor (as opposed to a citrus tang of a Habanero or the smoky, nutty flavor of arbol) that I thought would go well, and I think it did. I wanted to follow Kenji's advice and avoid the \"smoke\" flavored peppers and balance the flavor profiles of my various peppers, onions, and spices as best I could.\n\n**Swapped Dried New Mex for Fresh Hatch Chiles:** I wanted to use New Mexico chiles but didn't find any dried ones that looked decent. Since I grow my own Red Hatch varieties I used a bunch of those. De-seeded and blackened in the broiler to soften them, then cooked in the broth pot with my Ancho peppers. Worked well.\n\n-- Notes:\n\n**Got to use my fancy spices!** I really enjoyed a chance to use some fancy spices. Star Anise is always fun to use, and I also had some \"Afghan Mountain Wild Cumin\" which was awesome to grind up for this, very cool and complex cumin. For the chocolate I used some Mexican stone-ground chocolate which worked *very very well* and for the coffee I just used one of my nice espressos, which also worked well.\n\n**Marmite, seriously?** I was very 'lucky' to have some marmite around from a flight where I nearly starved to death and had to pay the airline for food, but the only thing available were jars of marmite. I get why it's used in the recipe but holy smokes, you have to be a dedicated cook to keep marmite around just for one teaspoon for chili. I'd love to find an alternative!\n\n-- Recommendations:\n\nLike other folks say, you can use chuck roast for this. Short Ribs are just *too expensive* to be realistic for a 'production model' of the Best Chili recipe.\n\nI would also recommend increasing the number of peppers used, but keep the proportions similar because it's a really great balance he struck. This way you can top off your pot without needing to use water and you get that *chile con carne* vibe of beef swimming in pepper broth. I ended up cooking and boiling like an extra 12 red Hatch chiles and the rest of my bag of dried Ancho. I did not add an extra Ghost Pepper though.\n\nI also recommend ditching the Buffalo sauce. I did a taste test in a side bowl and I don't think that stuff adds anything, at least not to mine, it just tastes so commercial and fake. Maybe it adds some heat if you were using a less spicy pepper base, but I would rather let people add their preferred hot sauce to the bowl than adulterate such a nice chili with Buffalo sauce.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1ftt8wk/2nd_place_win_at_the_chili_cookoff_best_chili/", "created_utc": 1727802372.0, "score": 90, "author": "LunarGiantNeil", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1ftt8wk/2nd_place_win_at_the_chili_cookoff_best_chili/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I think it might add a nice bright flavor, a bit of tang, and some fruity brightness that I think a lot of chili kinda lacks.

But, does wine really age finely ? Once you reach the point of 'good wines' around the $50 bottle mark (might even be lower), I struggle to identify 'improvement' in wines. Differences sure, but it feels more like an examination than enjoyment. I have my preferences for what style of wine pairs with one type of food. But, past modest price point, the quality seems related to how fancy the wine is.\n\nA vast number of people & chefs whose tastes I respect, are obsessed with wines. So, I don't want to be dismissive. What are they looking for ? At the top of their craft, the food items are some of the most experimental and finely constructed contraptions, but the drinks are just...wine ? The idea that drink pairings should belong from this narrow family of grape-based alcohols seems so limited. \n\nOn an honest note, there's plenty of alcohols I prefer more than wine, straight out of the bottle or after creative efforts of a mixologist.

{"title": "I made a mushroom variant of the Black Bean Burgers", "selftext": "I didn't have any feta or peppers on hand, but felt like making the black bean burgers tonight anyway.\n\nAs someone who usually orders any burger with mushrooms on it, I figured I'd try taking it in a different direction. It worked out great!\n\nFrom the [original recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-black-bean-burger-recipe), I made the following changes:\n\n- no peppers at all (poblano or chipotle), no adobo, no cheese in the patties\n- sub in shallots for onions. Shallots and mushroom are just a staple pairing.\n- I rehydrated a 0.5oz package of dehydrated shiitake and tossed them in whole with the beans in the food processor\n- I also added some truffle salt someone gifted me to the mix because why not. I don't put truffle in much these days but I think it added something. Either way the mix needs more seasoning to make up for the loss of the peppers and feta.\n\nMy version of the recipe: https://recipes.gnocchi.biscuits.club/cl7caqkjo0005ixi7yhe5jojq/0533d0b\n\nThe resulting patties have a more versatile flavor than the original, with a recognizeable note of mushroom coming through as the main flavor next to the beans themselves. Minimal change in texture, maybe slightly drier but still great and hold together well.\n\nHaving gotten that far I realized I would probably need to also tweak the toppings. I tossed together a haphazard attempt at a Parmesan aoili which served well enough, plus cheese and lettuce. If I had more time I might have caramelized some onions. Brie would have been nice, I'll have to plan ahead next time.\n\nOverall, I recommend trying it if you're not big on the southwestern bias of the original. Part of the appeal of this recipe for me is it's reliance on pantry staples, and dehydrated mushrooms fit in nicely with that ethos.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1e7l23w/i_made_a_mushroom_variant_of_the_black_bean/", "created_utc": 1721442031.0, "score": 24, "author": "A-Type", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1e7l23w/i_made_a_mushroom_variant_of_the_black_bean/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I even compared it to three other store-bought versions, and this was definitely superior.\n\nHere are the variant ingredients I used:\n\n* Chiles: 40g chile japon\u00e9s (or \u00e1rbol? Or...Thai? Unclear), 10g guajillo, 10g \u00e1rbol\n\n* Oil: Sunflower (caiziyou eludes me)\n\n* I did not have extra ground chiles so I omitted them when infusing the chiles with the aromatic-infused oil\n\n#Sidebar issue\nIs it expected that trimming and deseeding the chiles before toasting is extremely labor-intensive? This step alone took me like 45 minutes. Was I being too meticulous? Should I have just trimmed them in half, shake the loose seeds out, and move on?\n\n#Main issue!\nI toasted the trimmed chiles (about 1/2 inch chunks like the instructions) and sichuan peppercorns in my wok, but... doing so pretty much nuked my entire house with a lung-burning smell that lasted for hours into the night. Had to put on an n95 mask, open windows, fans, etc. Is this expected? What caused it, the chiles or the sichuan peppercorns? The moment I leaned in to smell if they were ready to go off the heat (a mere minute and a half into it) I was attacked by an intense coughing fit. My throat is still tingling the next day. I only had the flame at a medium, the contents were not smoking. Again I ask, was this expected?\n\nIn any case, this experience has motivated me to upgrade to an outdoor wok setup if this is just how it is. \ud83d\ude43", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/1dmznzs/did_something_go_wrong_when_making_kenjis_m\u00e1l\u00e0/", "created_utc": 1719186213.0, "score": 40, "author": "GetoutofhereNebulon", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/seriouseats/comments/1dmznzs/did_something_go_wrong_when_making_kenjis_m\u00e1l\u00e0/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

You promise him dinner at 7, he needs dinner at 7pm. Not 7:05, not 7:10, just 7:00 pm.
