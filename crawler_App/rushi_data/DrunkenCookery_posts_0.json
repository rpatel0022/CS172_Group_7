Remove the outer ring carefully without breaking it and a couple smaller inner rings for the middle. You could also use one medium sized ring to stuff between and maintain the ring shape but I don't mind extra filling.\n\nChop some bacon and mix it with the chicken and start stuffing, leave a little space for cheese. Press the cheese in to compact the inside, flip and repeat, let it chill in the freezer to firm up while you heat some oil.\n\nCoat with flour, then egg, then add some leftover egg to the leftover flour and mix it until it starts to get chunky, flour again, then fry until crispy.\n\nDrizzle with ranch and sprinkle of scallions then enjoy!\n\nAs for my dogs, they got some plain chicken since they already ate dinner and this was a night snack \ud83e\udd23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1guhgpe", "created_utc": 1731968717.0, "score": 619, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 33, "permalink": "/r/drunkencookery/comments/1guhgpe/buffalo_chicken_onion_ring/", "html_title": ""}

Use round cookie cutters to cut out circles then using a smaller cutter cut half again to make a rim. Egg wash the circle, put the hollow circle on top, egg wash again, and bake at 400\u00b0 until they're browned and puffy. Let them cool then pop the middle down with a spoon so you can fill them later.\n\nCrisp some bacon then brown the marinaded chicken in the bacon fat, turn down the heat, add a little chicken stock, and simmer until it shreds apart. After shredding add butter, hot sauce (I like Stevo-O's Hot Sauce for Your Butthole \ud83d\ude02), mix, then fill some pastry cups. Cover with shredded cheddar and broil until melted, top w/ bacon bits, a drizzle of ranch, and some scallions.\n\nThe tofu was shaken in cornstartch w/ rotisserie chicken seasoning then browned in olive oil. These are pretty straight forward \ud83d\ude05 lettuce, croutons, tofu, and caesar dressing.\n\nThe dog one's I just used some of their regularly prepped food which is chicken and rice w/ veggies and tumeric \ud83d\ude06 idk if they know or not but they still enjoyed it \ud83d\ude01\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1js9q2s", "created_utc": 1743876775.0, "score": 19, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/drunkencookery/comments/1js9q2s/buffalo_chicken_tofu_caesar_volauvents/", "html_title": ""}

Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar dissolves, let it cool, then pour it into a container w/ thin sliced red onions. I also added garlic and a chili pepper. Usually I add peppercorns too but I didn't have enough without emptying my grinder so I skipped them. Let them chill in the fridge with the potatoes and chicken \ud83d\ude06\n\nMake the kbbq sauce and a few strips of crispy bacon and set it all aside. \n\nUse the bacon fat to make a roux, add milk, bring to a simmer, and start adding cheese. I used a mix of oaxaca and cheddar. Once the cheese is melted and the sauce starts to get smooth, season it with SPPOG, cumin, chili powder, and gochujang to taste. If it starts to get too thick, add milk as needed, too thin and let it reduce or add more cheese.\n\nSet up your fry station w/ flour, egg, and bread crumbs all seasoned with SPPOG + dried oregano & thyme.\n\nDrain the water from the fries, pat dry, then press into the flour to get a good coat and rack them so they dry a bit before frying. The chicken and onion were both done with the regular flour, egg, bread, fry.\n\nOnce everything is nice and crispy, it's time to assemble this mess on a lightly toasted onion bun. Bacon, chicken dipped in sauce, and a stack of onions. Fill the onion ramekin w/ gochujang queso, sprinkle some bacon and scallions on top, then enjoy with fries! Don't forget to eat the onion ramekin at the end \ud83e\udd23\n\nSince my dogs can't have any of this \ud83d\ude05 they got some plain fries and a chicken sandwich on my girlfriends homemade bread \ud83d\ude06\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5qrhb", "created_utc": 1741360984.0, "score": 22, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/drunkencookery/comments/1j5qrhb/kbbq_chicken_sandwich_w_gochujang_queso_fries/", "html_title": ""}

Add broth as necessary to keep it from drying out.\n\nCook a few strips of bacon until extra crispy then set aside. In the bacon fat, add garlic & onion, when it gets soft and smells good toss in some shredded chicken. Season it with SPPOG + chili powder then mix in some chipotle adobo sauce, taste test and add more if you want it spicier.\n\nLet it cool down a bit before mixing it with the potatoes. Shape some balls and chill in the freezer until you have some nice, firm balls \ud83d\ude05\n\nWhile your balls are chillin, make a bacon fat roux. Stir in cream until it gets smooth and start adding cheese. I used oaxaca and shredded cheddar. Add as needed until it reaches your desired consistency, some people like it extra thick on their balls \ud83d\ude02 season w/ garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cumin, chili powder, & oregano.\n\nOnce your balls are set..flour, egg, panko, and let em drop \ud83e\udd23 fry until golden brown & crispy.

Deglaze w/ white wine and add minced chicken, I seasoned it with SPPOG + chili powder & cumin. Brown, add chipotles in adobo sauce and chicken stock then mix and let it simmer until the stock is gone. Taste test and if you want more of a kick, add some more chipotle adobo sauce.\n\nFor the non-meat eaters \ud83e\udd23 skip the bacon and use olive oil for the garlic & onion. Once soft, add the fake beef (I seasoned it the same as the chicken + oregano) cook until browned, then mix in cooked rice and diced tomatoes. Add vegetable broth as needed to keep it from drying out.\n\nWhile the fillings are cooling, cut a hole in the peppers and remove the insides. Stuff as much as you can in each one, I used the round handle end of a wooden spoon to get stuff into the tips. Cover with cheese, I used cheddar on the chicken and mozzarella on the meatless, then bake at 400\u00b0 until the cheese starts to brown. Add bacon bits on the chicken ones and put back in the oven, turned off, to crisp up the bacon a tad.\n\nSprinkle w/ parsley & scallions then enjoy!\n\nI didn't forget about my dogs, but they can't have this so I made them plain chicken breast browned in olive oil, used a ramekin to mold some plain rice, then garnished it with a celery leaf and carrots \ud83d\ude06", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i7f0xs", "created_utc": 1737563147.0, "score": 197, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/drunkencookery/comments/1i7f0xs/chipotle_chicken_impossible_beef_poppers/", "html_title": ""}

Use round cookie cutters to cut out circles then using a smaller cutter cut half again to make a rim. Egg wash the circle, put the hollow circle on top, egg wash again, and bake at 400\u00b0 until they're browned and puffy. Let them cool then pop the middle down with a spoon so you can fill them later.\n\nCrisp some bacon then brown the marinaded chicken in the bacon fat, turn down the heat, add a little chicken stock, and simmer until it shreds apart.

Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar dissolves, let it cool, then pour it into a container w/ thin sliced red onions. I also added garlic and a chili pepper. Usually I add peppercorns too but I didn't have enough without emptying my grinder so I skipped them. Let them chill in the fridge with the potatoes and chicken \ud83d\ude06\n\nMake the kbbq sauce and a few strips of crispy bacon and set it all aside. \n\nUse the bacon fat to make a roux, add milk, bring to a simmer, and start adding cheese. I used a mix of oaxaca and cheddar. Once the cheese is melted and the sauce starts to get smooth, season it with SPPOG, cumin, chili powder, and gochujang to taste. If it starts to get too thick, add milk as needed, too thin and let it reduce or add more cheese.\n\nSet up your fry station w/ flour, egg, and bread crumbs all seasoned with SPPOG + dried oregano & thyme.\n\nDrain the water from the fries, pat dry, then press into the flour to get a good coat and rack them so they dry a bit before frying. The chicken and onion were both done with the regular flour, egg, bread, fry.\n\nOnce everything is nice and crispy, it's time to assemble this mess on a lightly toasted onion bun. Bacon, chicken dipped in sauce, and a stack of onions. Fill the onion ramekin w/ gochujang queso, sprinkle some bacon and scallions on top, then enjoy with fries! Don't forget to eat the onion ramekin at the end \ud83e\udd23\n\nSince my dogs can't have any of this \ud83d\ude05 they got some plain fries and a chicken sandwich on my girlfriends homemade bread \ud83d\ude06\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5qrhb", "created_utc": 1741360984.0, "score": 21, "author": "XRPcook", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/drunkencookery/comments/1j5qrhb/kbbq_chicken_sandwich_w_gochujang_queso_fries/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
