{"title": "I ate at 8 bbq joints between Austin and Dallas in 72 hours. This was my experience. ", "selftext": "Just ate at 8 bbq spots between Dallas and Austin in 72 hours. Here are my thoughts. \n\nWent to, in order, to Goldee\u2019s, Salt Lick, Snow\u2019s, Interstellar, KG\u2019s, Franklin, Distant Relatives, and Slow Bone.\n\nGoldee\u2019s was my favorite overall due to the quality of every meat we got there. The sides were outstanding too. Standouts were the turkey, sausage, and pork belly. Brisket was probably second place. I will dream for a long time about the pork hash. \n\nFranklin still has the best brisket anywhere, both on texture and seasoning - he takes it right to the edge of almost too much seasoning without going over. It\u2019s truly perfect. Ruby\u2019s Dang Pie is so good to. We were there on Sunday and also got the beef rib, which is really just their brisket on a stick. Sides are meh, their turkey was all out bad. \n\nSnow\u2019s is hard to define. The line was so much fun and Tootsie is an icon, but I didn\u2019t find the food particularly notable. It wasn\u2019t bad at all, the chicken and pork steak were standouts, but the brisket and sausage were sadly mid tier. \n\nThis was my 3rd time at Salt Lick and every time it has been significantly worse than the time before. The location is great and that pit is beautiful, but the food isn\u2019t good. \n\nKG\u2019s was outstanding. It\u2019s not traditional Texas bbq by any stretch, but that flavor was unreal. Their Kafta sausage was probably my favorite sausage anywhere. I really loved the unique take on bbq. \n\nInterstellar we got to late in the day and a lot was sold out, but we got chopped brisket, pulled lamb, frito pie sausage, and peach tea pork belly. Loved the lamb, I wish more places would do it. The brisket was hard to judge because you don\u2019t get as much solid bark in chopped brisket, but from what I had, it was tasty. The belly was the star of the show. A little overly sweet for me but overall a delicious and interesting take. \n\nDistant Relatives was top tier. The brisket had a really interesting seasoning blend - in a good way. A little sweet and a little spicy. The chicken wasn\u2019t special, just very very good. The black eyed peas were my favorite beans of the weekend by far. \n\nSlow Bone\u2026I honestly can\u2019t think of much good to say. The sausage had good flavor but the meat was overstuffed and really thick. Brisket had no crust to speak of and was completely dry. The fried okra was decent. \n\nAll in all a great weekend and kind of fun to be able to compare the places back to back. On the bad side now my entire digestive track is screaming in agony and desperately wants me to eat something green. \n\n(Reposted for formatting)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gfds4n", "created_utc": 1730259878.0, "score": 1188, "author": "mancatmancat", "num_comments": 257, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1gfds4n/i_ate_at_8_bbq_joints_between_austin_and_dallas/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "First time visiting Texas. BBQ crawl. We ate six joints in five days.", "selftext": "We came down to support family at the Houston Iron Man. I talked my wife into going down early for BBQ. Here is our Itinerary, line size, and wait times. \n\nUnfortunately, we only had one day in Austin due to other commitments: \n\nArrived in Austin at 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday/Wednesday (late arrival due to airline delays). \n\nWednesday: \nFranklin\u2019s: (7:45 arrival, three groups of people ahead of us in line; first group arrived at 6am).\n\nLeroy and Lewis: (11:50 arrival, 20-30 people ahead of us in line, 40 min wait). \n\nAfter a 30 min. Gander in the Mill-scale retail store.\n\nKreuz (2:15 arrival, walked right up to the meat counter) \n\n*Bonus (not BBQ, but tasty)- drive to Houston through Brenham. Stopped at the Blue Bell Creamery. $1.00 ice cream scoops!, as someone from out of state, this was the best ice cream I ever had.*\n\nThursday:\nNo BBQ :( - Iron man things and sightseeing day. \n\nFriday:\nBar-A-BBQ (10:10 arrival, No line until open at 10:45). \n\nSaturday:\nCorkscrew: (10:30 arrival, 60-75 people in line, 2 hours). \n\nSunday \nTruth: (10:45 arrival, the first and second group in line arrived just as we did). \n\nRankings. Although I feel I have to say something about rank. Honestly, most of this is splitting hairs and up for debate. We loved certain aspects of all. \n\nPersonal overall Top three: \n1.) Bar A BBQ. \n2.) Franklin \n3.) Truth \n\nBest Brisket: \n1.) Leroy and Lewis: Foil Boat Brisket Bark is good. \n2.) Bar A: Perfect seasoning; juicy, fat render was perfect.  \n3.) Corkscrew: solid bite, excellent cook and seasoning.\n\nBest sausage Link:\n\n*Disclaimer. These are Unofficial results. I choked under pressure and forgot to order sausage at Truth*\n\n1.) Franklin (jalape\u00f1o cheddar): Snapped like a pickle, flavor was on point, spicy but not too spicy. \n2.) Bar-A (House and Jalape\u00f1o cheddar): excellent sausage. Jalape\u00f1o cheddar was my favorite out of the two. \n3.) Corkscrew (Garlic): solid link, also very good. \n\nSides/Dessert:\nWe didn\u2019t get a wide range of sides at a lot of the joints, so take this with a grain of salt, but our favorites:\n\n1.) Truth: The Brussels sprouts were amazing (and that\u2019s saying something coming from me), the Mac' n cheese was excellent, and the Beans were solid. \n2.) Bar A: Do not skip the cornbread pudding (I'm still thinking about it). The cucumber salad was refreshing with fatty meat and solid beans, and dirty rice was taken or left.\n3.) Corkscrew: Potato salad is the best I have ever had. I'm still thinking about how I can replicate it at home. \n\nBest atmosphere/Vibes:\n1.) Bar-A-BBQ: Small-town family-run vibes are high. I feel we had a very personal experience here. The owners, Shelby, had her 2-and-a-half-year-old son (in a Spider-Man suit and cowboy boots) with her as they were preparing for service. At open, Cooper talked to me for 20 minutes, and gave me a free hat. Old-school country music was fire. After eating, we spoke with employees working pits who answered questions and let us take pictures of the smokehouse and such. Overall, the environment was a small town/family-owned country BBQ.\n2.) Franklin: It was my first time waiting in a BBQ line. I love Aaron\u2019s style and decorating, and his merch is super cool (I spent more coin than I want to admit). The anticipation of smelling the post-oak smoke and waiting for the BBQ was great\u2014like a kid on Christmas. \n3.) Truth: The interior decor/atmosphere was fantastic, the table-side service was top-notch, Jerry and staff are amazing! very friendly. When I mentioned BBQ and Smoking meats as a hobby, I was instantly offered a Pit tour. The pit masters talked to us for 15-20 minutes, let us take pictures, and answered all our questions. \n\nSpecial Mentions/Extras: \n- The L&L Burger at Leroy and Lewis is the best burger I have ever had; it was amazing! The beef cheek at L&L is also amazing. If you go here, these items are must-orders. \n- Kreuz/Lockhart: Although not my favorite food, it\u2019s a super cool place. It's iconic, and there is a lot of Q history. It was a close fourth for atmosphere. It is a must-visit for any BBQ enthusiast. When I have more time, I want to return on a weekend and go to Barbs-B-Q, Blacks, and Smitty\u2019s\u2026Maybe one day, when I drive down and pick up a mill scale pit (one can dream).\n\nCritique(s): \n- I\u2019m easy to please so I loved every meal. The only thing I did not enjoy was the Hop sausage at L&L. I think I may have caught it on a bad day. It tasted like dirty smoke and the bind was crumbly, over cooked Maybe? I don\u2019t drink Alcohol, so, flavor profile could be an acquired taste for me personally.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9kfdy", "created_utc": 1745805389.0, "score": 738, "author": "Illustrious-Log-6783", "num_comments": 130, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1k9kfdy/first_time_visiting_texas_bbq_crawl_we_ate_six/", "html_title": ""}

I have been asked 1 zillion times\u00a0what pit is the best?\u00a0 \u00a0 My answer is always, learn to cook.  The pit won't help you if you can't cook, but if you can cook and manage a fire, then all of the above mentioned pits can deliver Texas Monthly #1 BBQ.\u00a0 \n\nToo many people are interested in the wrong questions like wood consumption, or not wanting to babysit the smoker.\u00a0 Babysit the hell out of it.\u00a0 Bad bbq can come off a gorgeous \"work of art\" smoker and great bbq can come off an ugly duck.   If a pit builder says \"oh, you won't have to put a split in but once an hour because our firebox is a bank vault\". \u00a0 Run, this isn't an efficiency contest and you need wood to burn to form bark and give depth of flavor. \u00a0 All cookers will have hot spots. \u00a0 Just learn your cooker and learn to cook and you'll be fine.

I'm not sure if that worked well as the vent looked [a little smoked](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/8206/Ppc8ex.jpg) - I've cooked a lot on this kettle, and never noticed that before.

{"title": "First time visiting Texas. BBQ crawl. We ate six joints in five days.", "selftext": "We came down to support family at the Houston Iron Man. I talked my wife into going down early for BBQ. Here is our Itinerary, line size, and wait times. \n\nUnfortunately, we only had one day in Austin due to other commitments: \n\nArrived in Austin at 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday/Wednesday (late arrival due to airline delays). \n\nWednesday: \nFranklin\u2019s: (7:45 arrival, three groups of people ahead of us in line; first group arrived at 6am).\n\nLeroy and Lewis: (11:50 arrival, 20-30 people ahead of us in line, 40 min wait). \n\nAfter a 30 min. Gander in the Mill-scale retail store.\n\nKreuz (2:15 arrival, walked right up to the meat counter) \n\n*Bonus (not BBQ, but tasty)- drive to Houston through Brenham. Stopped at the Blue Bell Creamery. $1.00 ice cream scoops!, as someone from out of state, this was the best ice cream I ever had.*\n\nThursday:\nNo BBQ :( - Iron man things and sightseeing day. \n\nFriday:\nBar-A-BBQ (10:10 arrival, No line until open at 10:45). \n\nSaturday:\nCorkscrew: (10:30 arrival, 60-75 people in line, 2 hours). \n\nSunday \nTruth: (10:45 arrival, the first and second group in line arrived just as we did). \n\nRankings. Although I feel I have to say something about rank. Honestly, most of this is splitting hairs and up for debate. We loved certain aspects of all. \n\nPersonal overall Top three: \n1.) Bar A BBQ. \n2.) Franklin \n3.) Truth \n\nBest Brisket: \n1.) Leroy and Lewis: Foil Boat Brisket Bark is good. \n2.) Bar A: Perfect seasoning; juicy, fat render was perfect.  \n3.) Corkscrew: solid bite, excellent cook and seasoning.\n\nBest sausage Link:\n\n*Disclaimer. These are Unofficial results. I choked under pressure and forgot to order sausage at Truth*\n\n1.) Franklin (jalape\u00f1o cheddar): Snapped like a pickle, flavor was on point, spicy but not too spicy. \n2.) Bar-A (House and Jalape\u00f1o cheddar): excellent sausage. Jalape\u00f1o cheddar was my favorite out of the two. \n3.) Corkscrew (Garlic): solid link, also very good. \n\nSides/Dessert:\nWe didn\u2019t get a wide range of sides at a lot of the joints, so take this with a grain of salt, but our favorites:\n\n1.) Truth: The Brussels sprouts were amazing (and that\u2019s saying something coming from me), the Mac' n cheese was excellent, and the Beans were solid. \n2.) Bar A: Do not skip the cornbread pudding (I'm still thinking about it). The cucumber salad was refreshing with fatty meat and solid beans, and dirty rice was taken or left.\n3.) Corkscrew: Potato salad is the best I have ever had. I'm still thinking about how I can replicate it at home. \n\nBest atmosphere/Vibes:\n1.) Bar-A-BBQ: Small-town family-run vibes are high. I feel we had a very personal experience here. The owners, Shelby, had her 2-and-a-half-year-old son (in a Spider-Man suit and cowboy boots) with her as they were preparing for service. At open, Cooper talked to me for 20 minutes, and gave me a free hat. Old-school country music was fire. After eating, we spoke with employees working pits who answered questions and let us take pictures of the smokehouse and such. Overall, the environment was a small town/family-owned country BBQ.\n2.) Franklin: It was my first time waiting in a BBQ line. I love Aaron\u2019s style and decorating, and his merch is super cool (I spent more coin than I want to admit). The anticipation of smelling the post-oak smoke and waiting for the BBQ was great\u2014like a kid on Christmas. \n3.) Truth: The interior decor/atmosphere was fantastic, the table-side service was top-notch, Jerry and staff are amazing! very friendly. When I mentioned BBQ and Smoking meats as a hobby, I was instantly offered a Pit tour. The pit masters talked to us for 15-20 minutes, let us take pictures, and answered all our questions. \n\nSpecial Mentions/Extras: \n- The L&L Burger at Leroy and Lewis is the best burger I have ever had; it was amazing! The beef cheek at L&L is also amazing. If you go here, these items are must-orders. \n- Kreuz/Lockhart: Although not my favorite food, it\u2019s a super cool place. It's iconic, and there is a lot of Q history. It was a close fourth for atmosphere. It is a must-visit for any BBQ enthusiast.

Well, decided to cook al three racks tomorrow, freeze the leftovers and eat off that for couple weeks. But, instead doing all three the exact same wanted to try out different things. \n\nFirst and foremost, use both grills -- one rack on the kettle and one rack on the Genesis. Kettle has advantage for smoke, Genesis has advantage constant temp control. I do have one those wood chips box things for the Genesis...thinking add some splits off my chunk wood to the box hopefully get more than 30 minutes of smoke out the thing. I do have a second box thing can load up and cycle in so get smoke over time on the Genni. \n\nSo, both those racks will use mustard binder and whatever rub I got, think I'm Meat Church right now.

For the rub was thinking rule is not use pre-made, but make something out of only what I've got on hand in the pantry.

Then I used for the binder worchestershire and franks. \n\nRibs rub - laid down in order black pepper, iodized salt (my kosher is too course didn't want to grind) msg, and garlic powder. \n\nSmoke - 200 on super smoke for about 2 hours, bumped to 225 while I smoked some hot dogs for an hour then dropped temp again for about 2 more hours then bumped back to 225 and threw a bit at 275 to get some evaporation to finish and get some crunchier bark. \n\nRest - Wrapped in foil and a glaze made roughly of (I had to doctor it after last week so it isn't super accurate) about 3 cups ketchup 1 cup Apple CIder VInegar, 1 cup White VInegar, 1/4 cup Worchester, a tablespoon of sriracha and salt, pepper, garlic and cumin. TSP each. \n\nThoughts - These were the ribs I want. GReat texture, bites off the bone clean but doesn't fall off the bone.

{"title": "Chuck roast first timer", "selftext": "TLDR: I smoked a 5.5\u2010lb bone-in chuck roast for the first time ever today, and it turned out great!\n\nMy neighbor got a bunch of cuts from a rancher friend, but didn't know what to do with this 5.5 lb bone-in chuck. With Easter approaching and all the kids in the cul-de-sac now being friends, she commissioned me to cook it as part of a small block party and Easter egg hunt. I don't get to do true BBQ much, so I was a bit nervous cooking a new-to-me cut for others.\n\nThe raw roast was already kinda coming apart along some tissue in the middle, so I just cut along the tissue, making roughly halves. I dry-brined it overnight, then whipped up a Texas beef rub (paprika, chili powder, ancho chile powder, garlic powder, white pepper, white sugar, sage, thyme, black pepper) right before putting it on the Weber.\n\nI struggled with the grill temp at first; kept it too high at 350F, so I got a bark pretty quick. Surprisingly, the internal temp went up pretty quick too, I guess thanks to splitting the cut. I dialed in the temp to 230-250 after about 90 mins, then relaxed with a beer or two while the internal temp went up. Both cuts hit a stall at 150-155, so I wrapped em in paper in an open foil pan and brought the grill temp up to 290F for another couple hours. I threw the occasional apple wood chunk on the coals throughout the cook to put some smoke on it. Both halves got up to 200F internal temp after 5 total hours of cooking, then I pulled them off and rested them for an hour.\n\nThen I shredded them by hand and was quite surprised with how moist and tender the meat was! Initially I was convinced I'd invented a new tire retreading method! Now, if I do this again, which I should, I will cook until the internal temp is at or over 200F for at least 30 mins.

{"title": "Introduction \ud83d\udc4b", "selftext": "So here's my story, how I stumbled ass-backwards into this glorious, smoky, sometimes heartbreaking world of barbecue.\n\n\nIt starts, like a lot of questionable life choices, back in college. End of semester, Houston in the rearview, heading for Austin. Class of '05, if you must know. The reward? The only reward that mattered after weeks of academic drudgery? Central Texas barbecue. The real, unadulterated, no-bullshit stuff. My first real taste, the one that burned itself into my brain, was from a trailer. A humble operation run by a guy named John Mueller. God rest his soul. That first bite of brisket... smoky, peppery, meltingly tender... it was a goddamn revelation. Right then, right there, that was the benchmark. Everything else would be judged against Mueller's brisket. Never, not in a million years, did I picture myself on the other side of the smoker, slinging meat instead of just eating it.\n\n\nFast forward. The world goes sideways. Pandemic. Remember that? My job, my cushy little number, was getting shipped off to Budapest. The economy? In the toilet. Suddenly, I had time. Too much time. And a gnawing feeling I needed to learn something. Something real. Something I'd always romanticized from afar. Barbecue. It had to be.\n\n\nSo, I find this local joint. New manager, new pitmaster. I walk in there, mid-pandemic chaos, and basically offer myself up as free labor. \"Look,\" I said, \"I'll sweep, I'll haul wood, whatever. Just let me hang around, learn the craft.\" No ambition, not really. Just wanted to understand the fire, the smoke, the magic. Spent eight months there, learning the rhythm of an Oyler rotisserie, wrestling logs into massive 500-gallon Moberg offsets I installed. Fire management \u2013 that's the dark art, the real heart of it. Picked up tips, absorbed what I could.\n\n\nThen, sausage. Had to know about sausage. Went to learn from the master, Bill Dumas. The Sausage Sensei. Fantastic class. Even better dude. Respect the craft, respect the people who've mastered it.\n\n\nAbout a year of soaking it all in, felt like time. Time to build my own beast. Got my hands on a 250-gallon propane tank, gave it a new life as an offset smoker. Insulated firebox, modeled after those Mobergs I knew. Learned to weld \u2013 well, learned enough to stick metal together. Two weeks of sweat, sparks, and some welds that are frankly, embarrassingly ugly. Named her Frida. Like Kahlo. She ain't pretty, but she\u2019s got soul, and she puts out food that makes people stop and take notice.\n\n\nPandemic's still humming along. I'm tweaking Frida, trying to get her dialed in. Start offering free brisket sandwiches on that neighborhood app, Nextdoor. More for practice than anything. Then this neighbor calls. Tells me it's the best damn brisket he's ever had. Asks if I'd cater for one of his clients. \"Sure,\" I say, thinking, what, 20, 30 people? He laughs. \"Nah, closer to 150.\"\n\n\n150? I was stunned. Terrified. But you don't back down from a challenge like that, right? Took the gig. And just like that, from one crazy leap of faith fueled by a neighbor's compliment, I was busy. Slammed for the rest of the year. People calling, texting, wanting brisket, ribs... it snowballed. That gig led to another, bigger one. 300 people.\n\n\nYeah, 300. Frida, bless her heart, wasn't gonna cut it. Needed a bigger rig. Got a 500-gallon monster on a trailer, another Moberg-inspired design.\n\n\nAnd... well, the rest is just smoke, sweat, and long hours. Now, people are ordering my barbecue for their family gatherings. The hope, the real hope, is that maybe, just maybe, I'm giving someone that same feeling I got from that first bite of John Mueller's brisket all those years ago. That moment of pure, unadulterated, delicious truth. Trying to pass on the obsession, I guess.\n\n\nAlright, that's my story. Now let's talk about what really matters: the meat.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxbwlv", "created_utc": 1744443191.0, "score": 218, "author": "RamirezBackyardBBQ", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1jxbwlv/introduction/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I\u2019m very frugal and want to keep things simple.\n\nMy usual setup:\n- Temp set to 225F\n- SS Smoke Tube filled w/pellets at the very bottom. I prop it up with some foil.\n- Top vent fully open\n- Modified wood chip feeder tube (I drilled a bunch of large holes through so it can let air in for the smoke tube)\n- 1st rack has giant foil pan at the bottom filled with water(mainly as a drip pan but I also figured the water would help maintain heat too).\n- 2nd rack is where I put the Pork Shoulder (Picnic cut) or brisket with Fat Cap Up. My reason is because it\u2019s so close to the giant water pan below and that the heat would sort of be redirected due to the water pan.  \n\nThoughts: \n- Fat Cap Up: I can never get the fat cap to fully render down. I\u2019m usually left with a large portion of soft fat with a thin bark. Then I peel it off and broil it in the oven to crisp it up.  \n- Fat Cap Down: I haven\u2019t tried yet. Does it even make a huge difference in my current setup?\n- 2nd Rack: should I try to move the meat to the highest rack? If I do, should I also move the giant drip pan with it or leave it on the bottom rack?\n- Giant Water Pan: keep using it filled with water or leave it empty as a pure drip catch?

{"title": "BBQ Advice appreciated", "selftext": "Hi\nI\u2019d really appreciate some advice. I currently have a small Webber kettle bbq. I have had it around 8 years. It\u2019s been well used.

I have found with the kettle grill that I\u2019m not that into all of the technical side of cooking with charcoal. I have managed to not kill my family with food poisoning, that\u2019s a win :). I like to heat it up and cook with as little faff as possible. Maybe after I\u2019ll try long smoking cooks and a pizza now and then. \nI have done some research into the various options available. It seems that a pellet grill ticks all the boxes. Smokey taste, ease of use and flexibility for different styles of cooking. \nThe Webber searwood seems to be a good solid option. As it\u2019s over a grand I wanted to ask if you\u2019d recommend an alternative before I pull the trigger. \nI have done quite a bit of reading and people seem to be very happy with theirs. \nHowever, I would feel better about getting one having asked you guys your thoughts before taking the leap. \nAm I missing something?

Someone replied that the only people who soak their chips are those who haven't learned that they shouldn't.\n\nThat sounded sensible, and I felt kind of dumb for having been soaking for years. Surely the smoker is going to dry out the chips before they can produce smoke, I've been wasting time and energy and water.\n\nThis past weekend, I put on some ribs and did not soak the wood chips. All was well for a while, then I saw the temperature had reached 300F. That's weird, the smoker was set to 225 and its highest available setting is 275.\n\nI'll skip the details of my troubleshooting, the problem was that the wood chips were combusting a bit. They weren't just producing smoke but also heat. I reset things and tried again, again it went to 300.\n\nI put a little water in the chip tray and soaked the rest of the chips, and all was well for the remainder of the cook.\n\nIn conclusion, you may very well need to soak your wood chips.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/1jwsruw/soaking_wood_chips/", "created_utc": 1744385681.0, "score": 3, "author": "jonathanhoag1942", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1jwsruw/soaking_wood_chips/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Overnight Iberico Pork Ribs", "selftext": "The goal was to make lightly seasoned, high quality(nutritionally), rack of ribs.\n\nThis rack weighed 2.2 lbs and was $32. I know the price was steep but I wanted to eat pasture raised meat with optimal micronutrients.\n\nIt was my second time using a smoker and my first time cooking ribs. The recipe was inspired by both Goldees hot hold method and sous vide temperatures.\n\nTHE RECIPE:\n\nFrom frozen I let the st louis cut ribs thaw out in lukewarm water. Rinsed them off with filtered water, then did minor trim work to get loose bits that were hanging off.\n\nI lightly seasoned with chili powder, paprika, KINDERS \u201cThe Blend\u201d(sea salt, dehydrated garlic, black pepper, sunflower oil, garlic oil.)\n\nIt was a super light amount of seasoning, just enough to give some interesting flavor.\\\n\nI threw it in the electric smoker at 225(ramping up) for 1 hour 15 minutes before it stalled around 160 degrees internal food temp.\\\n\n(Smoker had less than a handful of hickory chips placed over the heating element, and had a cup of water inside to maintain the humidity)\n\nSo I bumped it up to 270 degrees for half an hour before it brushed 196 internal temps.\\\n\nSet the temp to basically off (180 degrees), the smoker temps slowly decreased to about 240, and I watched the meat temperature, it was dropping pretty quickly to 187 internal so I assumed the probe wasn\u2019t positioned in the best location, I cycled it up to 270 two more times and lowered it to off (180 degrees) until I was satisfied with the speed the internal meat temperature was decreasing.\n\n3 hours into the cook I pulled it out and double wrapped it in foil, meat side down. I added all the tallow that dripped into the pan back on top of the ribs.\n\nSUPER CONTROVERSIAL TRIGGER WARNING AHEAD: I poured >!a quarter cup of water!< over the ribs instead of bbq sauce.\n\nMy reasoning is that I don\u2019t like to cook meat mixed with sugar because it feels like it\u2019s altering the taste of it too much, but still wanted there to be moisture and steam inside. sugar sauces should be applied after cooking is done. It\u2019s a hill I am willing to die on \ud83d\ude01.\n\nI then let it slow cook at 153 degrees for 11 hours to nicely break down any tough collagen. Afterwards I lowered it to 142 degrees to hot hold for 2 hours before I was ready to eat.\n\nIf I had to make some improvements, I\u2019d say it could use slightly more cook time as there was some small fatty spots that didn\u2019t melt down.

{"title": "Some questions about deflector plate and heat zones on Kamado", "selftext": "Up until a week ago my one and only BBQ was a most basic version of Weber kettle on which I did lots of  slow cooking and smoking. Classic technique I used e.g. for chicken wings or pork ribs was after the main smoking is done, I would move the meat over the hot coals for some crispiness.\n\nNow I got Weber Summit Kamado, and so far I am absolutely in love. However, I have couple of questions:\n\n1. If I use deflector plate, then how would I do this last step of crisping the meat over high direct heat at the very end? Is the idea that I would have to preparate a new set of coals and add them on the upper level?\n2. If I don't need much space on the upper grill, when smoking/slow cooking, are there any adantages of putting coals on the lowest level with deflector plate compared to simple having everything on the highest level in the charcoal baskets on multiple zones? I feel like having all on the same level on multiple zones is nice since I can easily move my stuff over high heat at the end.\n3. I read that the best way to clean a grill grate is by heating up the BBQ. But what if my next cook is supposed to be relatively low temp slow cook, do I need to prepare bunch of coals on upper level for the sole purpose of cleaning the grate?

I wanted to ask the pros how you like to smoke your pork?  What is your prep time line look like for the pork? Do you like it dry in the fridge a day or so beforehand like you do with ribs? How long do you let it sit for it to get to room temp before putting the rub on. \n I\u2019m planning to do a dry rub but no injections or wet brine.

Also, for a binder, do most people prefer mustard, or does olive oil work just as well? For those who\u2019ve perfected pulled pork, what\u2019s your go-to temp and time?

While a pellet smoker would be above my current pay-grade right now, it's unlikely that one would be offered even to the highest pay grade. \n\nBut seeing as how most of the commercial parts are fairly universal, even between brands,  over the past 3 months I've manged to collect all the major parts of a pellet smoker: \n\n- Digital PID controller\n- Auger (just came today)\n- Auger motor + coupling (controlled by PID controller)\n- Circulation fan (for controller) \n- Burn pot + Igniter\n- 2 Ambient thermometers (one for controller) \n- 2 internal probes for controller  (for meat or <gasp> vegetables)\n- Large SS drip tray/baffle \n- Burn pot baffle\n- A couple adjustable elbowed chimneys \n- Igniter for burn pot \n- Some really hefty grates (in 3 pieces)\n- Several shapes/styles of adjustable vents\n\nStill missing is the tube for the 19\" auger. Is this 1.5\" inner diameter?  (It's hard to measure the circumference of a spiral). \n\nSo what's left is the actual housing of the pit itself and a hopper which I will have to build myself ... someway, somehow.  The hopper is easy- The rest not so much.\n\nHas anybody seen any sites or links  that approach this feat of constructing a shell for pellet smoker?   55 gallon drums or a file cabinet come to mind as an easy approach, but the commercial upright pellet smokers get universally shitty reviews.  \n\nHas anybody here done anything similar?\n\nI don't do any metal working (yet) nor have any welding equip or experience.  But I do have some tools and supplies to be able to rivet and rivnut, angle grinder, metal sheers,  and I do have access to a brake that can probably do at least 12 gauge sheet metal. \n\nCan anybody throw me a meaty bone I can chew on?

{"title": "First time visiting Texas. BBQ crawl. We ate six joints in five days.", "selftext": "We came down to support family at the Houston Iron Man. I talked my wife into going down early for BBQ. Here is our Itinerary, line size, and wait times. \n\nUnfortunately, we only had one day in Austin due to other commitments: \n\nArrived in Austin at 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday/Wednesday (late arrival due to airline delays). \n\nWednesday: \nFranklin\u2019s: (7:45 arrival, three groups of people ahead of us in line; first group arrived at 6am).\n\nLeroy and Lewis: (11:50 arrival, 20-30 people ahead of us in line, 40 min wait). \n\nAfter a 30 min. Gander in the Mill-scale retail store.\n\nKreuz (2:15 arrival, walked right up to the meat counter) \n\n*Bonus (not BBQ, but tasty)- drive to Houston through Brenham. Stopped at the Blue Bell Creamery. $1.00 ice cream scoops!, as someone from out of state, this was the best ice cream I ever had.*\n\nThursday:\nNo BBQ :( - Iron man things and sightseeing day. \n\nFriday:\nBar-A-BBQ (10:10 arrival, No line until open at 10:45). \n\nSaturday:\nCorkscrew: (10:30 arrival, 60-75 people in line, 2 hours). \n\nSunday \nTruth: (10:45 arrival, the first and second group in line arrived just as we did). \n\nRankings. Although I feel I have to say something about rank. Honestly, most of this is splitting hairs and up for debate. We loved certain aspects of all. \n\nPersonal overall Top three: \n1.) Bar A BBQ. \n2.) Franklin \n3.) Truth \n\nBest Brisket: \n1.) Leroy and Lewis: Foil Boat Brisket Bark is good. \n2.) Bar A: Perfect seasoning; juicy, fat render was perfect.  \n3.) Corkscrew: solid bite, excellent cook and seasoning.\n\nBest sausage Link:\n\n*Disclaimer. These are Unofficial results. I choked under pressure and forgot to order sausage at Truth*\n\n1.) Franklin (jalape\u00f1o cheddar): Snapped like a pickle, flavor was on point, spicy but not too spicy. \n2.) Bar-A (House and Jalape\u00f1o cheddar): excellent sausage. Jalape\u00f1o cheddar was my favorite out of the two. \n3.) Corkscrew (Garlic): solid link, also very good. \n\nSides/Dessert:\nWe didn\u2019t get a wide range of sides at a lot of the joints, so take this with a grain of salt, but our favorites:\n\n1.) Truth: The Brussels sprouts were amazing (and that\u2019s saying something coming from me), the Mac' n cheese was excellent, and the Beans were solid. \n2.) Bar A: Do not skip the cornbread pudding (I'm still thinking about it). The cucumber salad was refreshing with fatty meat and solid beans, and dirty rice was taken or left.\n3.) Corkscrew: Potato salad is the best I have ever had. I'm still thinking about how I can replicate it at home. \n\nBest atmosphere/Vibes:\n1.) Bar-A-BBQ: Small-town family-run vibes are high. I feel we had a very personal experience here. The owners, Shelby, had her 2-and-a-half-year-old son (in a Spider-Man suit and cowboy boots) with her as they were preparing for service. At open, Cooper talked to me for 20 minutes, and gave me a free hat. Old-school country music was fire. After eating, we spoke with employees working pits who answered questions and let us take pictures of the smokehouse and such. Overall, the environment was a small town/family-owned country BBQ.\n2.) Franklin: It was my first time waiting in a BBQ line. I love Aaron\u2019s style and decorating, and his merch is super cool (I spent more coin than I want to admit). The anticipation of smelling the post-oak smoke and waiting for the BBQ was great\u2014like a kid on Christmas. \n3.) Truth: The interior decor/atmosphere was fantastic, the table-side service was top-notch, Jerry and staff are amazing! very friendly. When I mentioned BBQ and Smoking meats as a hobby, I was instantly offered a Pit tour. The pit masters talked to us for 15-20 minutes, let us take pictures, and answered all our questions. \n\nSpecial Mentions/Extras: \n- The L&L Burger at Leroy and Lewis is the best burger I have ever had; it was amazing! The beef cheek at L&L is also amazing. If you go here, these items are must-orders. \n- Kreuz/Lockhart: Although not my favorite food, it\u2019s a super cool place. It's iconic, and there is a lot of Q history. It was a close fourth for atmosphere. It is a must-visit for any BBQ enthusiast. When I have more time, I want to return on a weekend and go to Barbs-B-Q, Blacks, and Smitty\u2019s\u2026Maybe one day, when I drive down and pick up a mill scale pit (one can dream).\n\nCritique(s): \n- I\u2019m easy to please so I loved every meal. The only thing I did not enjoy was the Hop sausage at L&L. I think I may have caught it on a bad day. It tasted like dirty smoke and the bind was crumbly, over cooked Maybe? I don\u2019t drink Alcohol, so, flavor profile could be an acquired taste for me personally.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9kfdy", "created_utc": 1745805389.0, "score": 734, "author": "Illustrious-Log-6783", "num_comments": 130, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1k9kfdy/first_time_visiting_texas_bbq_crawl_we_ate_six/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Yes, I saw this when was at the store--haha. Was thinking cook two and freeze one but I have no way of wrapping a rack and freezing properly...do not have a vac seal so option was wrap in parchment then a shit ton of Saran Wrap. Well, decided to cook al three racks tomorrow, freeze the leftovers and eat off that for couple weeks. But, instead doing all three the exact same wanted to try out different things. \n\nFirst and foremost, use both grills -- one rack on the kettle and one rack on the Genesis. Kettle has advantage for smoke, Genesis has advantage constant temp control. I do have one those wood chips box things for the Genesis...thinking add some splits off my chunk wood to the box hopefully get more than 30 minutes of smoke out the thing. I do have a second box thing can load up and cycle in so get smoke over time on the Genni. \n\nSo, both those racks will use mustard binder and whatever rub I got, think I'm Meat Church right now. Smoke flavor be better from the kettle obviously, but, what I want to see here is result of temp control -- does it really matter holding a precise constant temp or is it okay the fluctuations on kettle using 'Lazy Man' Snake method? \n\nBrings us to the third rack. Want to do something Not approved by BBQ MD's, right? What is the weirdest treatment or goofiest mix of binder / rub you've seen and wanted to try? \n\nFor me, I been seeing comments about using a mixture of Frank's and Wooster as binder. Interesting. For the rub was thinking rule is not use pre-made, but make something out of only what I've got on hand in the pantry. Then, thought was cut third rack in half and cook one half each grill. \n\nMy guess is overall none of this will matter and will have a giant pile of tasty ribs, but, these are the things I think about--haha!

Then stuffed it with herb butter.  Then applied a butter coat to it and covered it with a piece of cheese cloth soaked in the butter coat.  Then smoked it for 10 hours at 225.

But when all of the food is already cooked and you\u2019re just waiting on people to cut it, it should not take this long. \n\nI believe Terry blacks had multiple meat cutters which is probably why the line moves so quickly if there ever is a line.

With Easter approaching and all the kids in the cul-de-sac now being friends, she commissioned me to cook it as part of a small block party and Easter egg hunt. I don't get to do true BBQ much, so I was a bit nervous cooking a new-to-me cut for others.\n\nThe raw roast was already kinda coming apart along some tissue in the middle, so I just cut along the tissue, making roughly halves. I dry-brined it overnight, then whipped up a Texas beef rub (paprika, chili powder, ancho chile powder, garlic powder, white pepper, white sugar, sage, thyme, black pepper) right before putting it on the Weber.\n\nI struggled with the grill temp at first; kept it too high at 350F, so I got a bark pretty quick. Surprisingly, the internal temp went up pretty quick too, I guess thanks to splitting the cut. I dialed in the temp to 230-250 after about 90 mins, then relaxed with a beer or two while the internal temp went up. Both cuts hit a stall at 150-155, so I wrapped em in paper in an open foil pan and brought the grill temp up to 290F for another couple hours. I threw the occasional apple wood chunk on the coals throughout the cook to put some smoke on it. Both halves got up to 200F internal temp after 5 total hours of cooking, then I pulled them off and rested them for an hour.\n\nThen I shredded them by hand and was quite surprised with how moist and tender the meat was! Initially I was convinced I'd invented a new tire retreading method! Now, if I do this again, which I should, I will cook until the internal temp is at or over 200F for at least 30 mins.

General tips on usage, cleaning, temp control, etc.\n\nAbout temperatures:\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, this is what I\u2019ve gathered so far (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong!):\n\t\u2022\tPulled pork, ribs, pork belly, brisket: around 250\u00b0F\n\t\u2022\tChicken and poultry: better at 300\u2013350\u00b0F?\n\nRegarding the stall:\nI\u2019ve seen many different approaches, but I\u2019m leaning towards using butcher paper as the best option. I\u2019m also curious about using a water pan to help avoid dry spots\u2014what do you think?\n\nThanks so much, everyone!\nCan\u2019t wait to keep learning and sharing with this awesome \n\n\n\n\u201cI leave you a recipe from a book whose name I don\u2019t remember right now, but I have it in my notebook. It\u2019s quite good as a thank you.

I\u2019m very frugal and want to keep things simple.\n\nMy usual setup:\n- Temp set to 225F\n- SS Smoke Tube filled w/pellets at the very bottom. I prop it up with some foil.\n- Top vent fully open\n- Modified wood chip feeder tube (I drilled a bunch of large holes through so it can let air in for the smoke tube)\n- 1st rack has giant foil pan at the bottom filled with water(mainly as a drip pan but I also figured the water would help maintain heat too).\n- 2nd rack is where I put the Pork Shoulder (Picnic cut) or brisket with Fat Cap Up. My reason is because it\u2019s so close to the giant water pan below and that the heat would sort of be redirected due to the water pan.  \n\nThoughts: \n- Fat Cap Up: I can never get the fat cap to fully render down. I\u2019m usually left with a large portion of soft fat with a thin bark. Then I peel it off and broil it in the oven to crisp it up.  \n- Fat Cap Down: I haven\u2019t tried yet. Does it even make a huge difference in my current setup?\n- 2nd Rack: should I try to move the meat to the highest rack? If I do, should I also move the giant drip pan with it or leave it on the bottom rack?\n- Giant Water Pan: keep using it filled with water or leave it empty as a pure drip catch? I worry it\u2019ll be \u201ctoo dry\u201d in the smoker. \n\nOverall: my cooks usually turn out really good but I\u2019m looking to see if I need to change something to make it even better.

I like to heat it up and cook with as little faff as possible. Maybe after I\u2019ll try long smoking cooks and a pizza now and then. \nI have done some research into the various options available. It seems that a pellet grill ticks all the boxes. Smokey taste, ease of use and flexibility for different styles of cooking. \nThe Webber searwood seems to be a good solid option.

{"title": "Introduction \ud83d\udc4b", "selftext": "So here's my story, how I stumbled ass-backwards into this glorious, smoky, sometimes heartbreaking world of barbecue.\n\n\nIt starts, like a lot of questionable life choices, back in college. End of semester, Houston in the rearview, heading for Austin. Class of '05, if you must know. The reward? The only reward that mattered after weeks of academic drudgery? Central Texas barbecue. The real, unadulterated, no-bullshit stuff. My first real taste, the one that burned itself into my brain, was from a trailer. A humble operation run by a guy named John Mueller. God rest his soul. That first bite of brisket... smoky, peppery, meltingly tender... it was a goddamn revelation. Right then, right there, that was the benchmark. Everything else would be judged against Mueller's brisket. Never, not in a million years, did I picture myself on the other side of the smoker, slinging meat instead of just eating it.\n\n\nFast forward. The world goes sideways. Pandemic. Remember that? My job, my cushy little number, was getting shipped off to Budapest. The economy? In the toilet. Suddenly, I had time. Too much time. And a gnawing feeling I needed to learn something. Something real. Something I'd always romanticized from afar. Barbecue. It had to be.\n\n\nSo, I find this local joint. New manager, new pitmaster. I walk in there, mid-pandemic chaos, and basically offer myself up as free labor. \"Look,\" I said, \"I'll sweep, I'll haul wood, whatever. Just let me hang around, learn the craft.\" No ambition, not really. Just wanted to understand the fire, the smoke, the magic. Spent eight months there, learning the rhythm of an Oyler rotisserie, wrestling logs into massive 500-gallon Moberg offsets I installed. Fire management \u2013 that's the dark art, the real heart of it. Picked up tips, absorbed what I could.\n\n\nThen, sausage. Had to know about sausage. Went to learn from the master, Bill Dumas. The Sausage Sensei. Fantastic class. Even better dude. Respect the craft, respect the people who've mastered it.\n\n\nAbout a year of soaking it all in, felt like time. Time to build my own beast. Got my hands on a 250-gallon propane tank, gave it a new life as an offset smoker. Insulated firebox, modeled after those Mobergs I knew. Learned to weld \u2013 well, learned enough to stick metal together. Two weeks of sweat, sparks, and some welds that are frankly, embarrassingly ugly. Named her Frida. Like Kahlo. She ain't pretty, but she\u2019s got soul, and she puts out food that makes people stop and take notice.\n\n\nPandemic's still humming along. I'm tweaking Frida, trying to get her dialed in. Start offering free brisket sandwiches on that neighborhood app, Nextdoor. More for practice than anything. Then this neighbor calls. Tells me it's the best damn brisket he's ever had. Asks if I'd cater for one of his clients. \"Sure,\" I say, thinking, what, 20, 30 people? He laughs. \"Nah, closer to 150.\"\n\n\n150? I was stunned. Terrified. But you don't back down from a challenge like that, right? Took the gig. And just like that, from one crazy leap of faith fueled by a neighbor's compliment, I was busy. Slammed for the rest of the year. People calling, texting, wanting brisket, ribs... it snowballed. That gig led to another, bigger one. 300 people.\n\n\nYeah, 300. Frida, bless her heart, wasn't gonna cut it. Needed a bigger rig. Got a 500-gallon monster on a trailer, another Moberg-inspired design.\n\n\nAnd... well, the rest is just smoke, sweat, and long hours. Now, people are ordering my barbecue for their family gatherings. The hope, the real hope, is that maybe, just maybe, I'm giving someone that same feeling I got from that first bite of John Mueller's brisket all those years ago. That moment of pure, unadulterated, delicious truth. Trying to pass on the obsession, I guess.\n\n\nAlright, that's my story. Now let's talk about what really matters: the meat.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxbwlv", "created_utc": 1744443191.0, "score": 219, "author": "RamirezBackyardBBQ", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1jxbwlv/introduction/", "html_title": ""}

That's weird, the smoker was set to 225 and its highest available setting is 275.\n\nI'll skip the details of my troubleshooting, the problem was that the wood chips were combusting a bit. They weren't just producing smoke but also heat. I reset things and tried again, again it went to 300.\n\nI put a little water in the chip tray and soaked the rest of the chips, and all was well for the remainder of the cook.\n\nIn conclusion, you may very well need to soak your wood chips.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/1jwsruw/soaking_wood_chips/", "created_utc": 1744385681.0, "score": 3, "author": "jonathanhoag1942", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1jwsruw/soaking_wood_chips/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Overnight Iberico Pork Ribs", "selftext": "The goal was to make lightly seasoned, high quality(nutritionally), rack of ribs.\n\nThis rack weighed 2.2 lbs and was $32. I know the price was steep but I wanted to eat pasture raised meat with optimal micronutrients.\n\nIt was my second time using a smoker and my first time cooking ribs. The recipe was inspired by both Goldees hot hold method and sous vide temperatures.\n\nTHE RECIPE:\n\nFrom frozen I let the st louis cut ribs thaw out in lukewarm water. Rinsed them off with filtered water, then did minor trim work to get loose bits that were hanging off.\n\nI lightly seasoned with chili powder, paprika, KINDERS \u201cThe Blend\u201d(sea salt, dehydrated garlic, black pepper, sunflower oil, garlic oil.)\n\nIt was a super light amount of seasoning, just enough to give some interesting flavor.\\\n\nI threw it in the electric smoker at 225(ramping up) for 1 hour 15 minutes before it stalled around 160 degrees internal food temp.\\\n\n(Smoker had less than a handful of hickory chips placed over the heating element, and had a cup of water inside to maintain the humidity)\n\nSo I bumped it up to 270 degrees for half an hour before it brushed 196 internal temps.\\\n\nSet the temp to basically off (180 degrees), the smoker temps slowly decreased to about 240, and I watched the meat temperature, it was dropping pretty quickly to 187 internal so I assumed the probe wasn\u2019t positioned in the best location, I cycled it up to 270 two more times and lowered it to off (180 degrees) until I was satisfied with the speed the internal meat temperature was decreasing.\n\n3 hours into the cook I pulled it out and double wrapped it in foil, meat side down. I added all the tallow that dripped into the pan back on top of the ribs.\n\nSUPER CONTROVERSIAL TRIGGER WARNING AHEAD: I poured >!a quarter cup of water!< over the ribs instead of bbq sauce.\n\nMy reasoning is that I don\u2019t like to cook meat mixed with sugar because it feels like it\u2019s altering the taste of it too much, but still wanted there to be moisture and steam inside. sugar sauces should be applied after cooking is done. It\u2019s a hill I am willing to die on \ud83d\ude01.\n\nI then let it slow cook at 153 degrees for 11 hours to nicely break down any tough collagen. Afterwards I lowered it to 142 degrees to hot hold for 2 hours before I was ready to eat.\n\nIf I had to make some improvements, I\u2019d say it could use slightly more cook time as there was some small fatty spots that didn\u2019t melt down. I\u2019ll either bump the slow cook temperature up to 154-155 or let it slow cook longer at the original temperature.\n\nIt turned out super good. Meat was not fall off the bone, it had just the right amount of bite to it. However the cut was lean, not enough meat on the bones. Which lowers my rating from S tier to A tier. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jt44sy", "created_utc": 1743972536.0, "score": 25, "author": "XayahOneTrick", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/BBQ/comments/1jt44sy/overnight_iberico_pork_ribs/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Some questions about deflector plate and heat zones on Kamado", "selftext": "Up until a week ago my one and only BBQ was a most basic version of Weber kettle on which I did lots of  slow cooking and smoking. Classic technique I used e.g. for chicken wings or pork ribs was after the main smoking is done, I would move the meat over the hot coals for some crispiness.\n\nNow I got Weber Summit Kamado, and so far I am absolutely in love. However, I have couple of questions:\n\n1. If I use deflector plate, then how would I do this last step of crisping the meat over high direct heat at the very end? Is the idea that I would have to preparate a new set of coals and add them on the upper level?\n2. If I don't need much space on the upper grill, when smoking/slow cooking, are there any adantages of putting coals on the lowest level with deflector plate compared to simple having everything on the highest level in the charcoal baskets on multiple zones? I feel like having all on the same level on multiple zones is nice since I can easily move my stuff over high heat at the end.\n3. I read that the best way to clean a grill grate is by heating up the BBQ. But what if my next cook is supposed to be relatively low temp slow cook, do I need to prepare bunch of coals on upper level for the sole purpose of cleaning the grate?

I wanted to ask the pros how you like to smoke your pork?  What is your prep time line look like for the pork? Do you like it dry in the fridge a day or so beforehand like you do with ribs? How long do you let it sit for it to get to room temp before putting the rub on. \n I\u2019m planning to do a dry rub but no injections or wet brine. I\u2019ve done pulled pork before, but the process took forever, and I had to spray the meat every 45 minutes all night long.

Also, for a binder, do most people prefer mustard, or does olive oil work just as well? For those who\u2019ve perfected pulled pork, what\u2019s your go-to temp and time? Do you stick to 225\u00b0F the whole way, or do you crank it up at some point? What internal temp do you take it off at or turn up the temp on, when do you wrap (if at all), and how long do you usually let it rest before pulling?
