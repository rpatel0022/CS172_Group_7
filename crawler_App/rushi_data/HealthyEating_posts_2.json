{"title": "How I accidently became a healthy eater and why it's been so easy to keep doing it", "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: This post got removed from r/HealthyFood and I got permanently banned for questioning it. I am willing to risk to be banned here too. I just thought I'd share my experience. No ill will intended.   \n\\---  \n \n\nIt must have been around 3 years ago,  when I saw my girlfriend pour something like 300g of sugar into a  mixing bowl to bake a cake (that we would typically finish in one or two  days). She was following the recipe and didn't really think about it. I  don't bake much at all, so I just casually said \"whoa that's a lot of  sugar\". This was probably the first time she started questioning her  (and my) sugar intake and over the following months she started  following this health-food-movement that's been popping up all over  social media in her home country.The principles are easy: Reduce sugar,  read the labels, try to avoid processed foods. We kind of tried to do  that here and there, and she already started feeling much better both  physically and mentally. I still hadn't really bought in, because it  seemed like too much effort and I wasn't really overweight or  experiencing any health problems anyway.\n\nFast  forward to March 2020 and opportunity struck. Suddenly I am working  from home, saving 90 minutes a day on commute. Time which I can invest  to cook my own meals instead of eating Chinese take-out or hot dogs or  some supermarket-junk at work. No more coke machine in the hallway. No  more chocolate treats at the front desk when entering the office. No  after-work beers or weekends out drinking.\n\nWhen  my country first went into lockdown in March, we started making  shopping lists for the week so we'd only have to leave the house once a  week. We came up with fully planned out meal plans for the next 10 days  or so, and we started getting more and more creative. We were getting  recipes off the internet, sharing pictures with friends and family, it  even got to a competitive level when sharing our home-made food-porn.\n\nIt's also a fact that, if you're cooking from scratch, healthy recipes are way easier to make than junk food.\n\nSo  at this point we're thinking more about our eating habits and we're  checking the ingredients of all the stuff we buy at the supermarket. We  follow two simple principles: What's the sugar content per 100 grams?  Can we pronounce all of the ingredients that are listed?\n\nHere are some random facts:\n\n* The store-brand product often has less sugar and fewer artificial preservatives than the trusted brand name product.\n* \"light\" or \"diet\" products often have higher sugar content than the full-fat stuff (e.g. yoghurt)\n* soft drinks and fruit juices are basically poison\n* you  can eat as much chocolate as you like, as long as you stick to high  cocoa percentage. (50 g sugar per 100 g in your classic milk-chocolate,  13 g sugar per 100 g in our favourite store-brand 85% dark chocolate)\n* you can't eat (or drink) what you don't buy\n* your mom's christmas cookie recipe? Cut the sugar in half and try if you notice a difference. We certainly didn't!\n\nI'll  still have a can of coke here or there, but I am aware that coke has 11  g of sugar per 100 ml. For a 330 ml can that's 36 g or roughly 100% of  the WHO recommended free sugar intake per day. I won't buy more than one  can at a time, so I don't have the opportunity to consume more.\n\nAll  in all, cooking from scratch has been really fun and we have come up  with so many recipes, that we're now collecting them in our own cookbook  that we'll give away as christmas presents to our families. Our meat  consumption is down, but who doesn't love bacon... and we'll have  something like home-made wings twice a month and of course fish once or  twice a week.\n\nSince quarantine  started I lost 6 kilos without ever feeling hungry or even trying to  lose weight. The last time I had a BMI of 21 must have been probably  around age 20 (I am now in my mid-30s). I have never been someone who  works out, this hasn't changed with Covid either. I've been working from  home since March and it's really been a revelation for my physical  well-being.\n\nTLDR: Reduce sugar, read labels, profit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/k8j9d3/how_i_accidently_became_a_healthy_eater_and_why/", "created_utc": 1607356848.0, "score": 293, "author": "klaymens", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/k8j9d3/how_i_accidently_became_a_healthy_eater_and_why/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

At the time I didn't feel like my drinking was out of control, but was noticing the effects of alcohol more in the form of bad nights of sleep, feelings on low energy and lost productivity, and beer belly that was becoming harder and harder to keep off.\n\nHere's how my drinks and dry days have trended since:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3igbu8twh8c51.jpg?width=1074&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=622693cdff2d29be4a5b416c3b35af8e0cbb3a52\n\nTo keep me on top of the tracking habit, I built Cutback Coach ([https://cutbackcoach.com](https://cutbackcoach.com/)), a simple text message system to track each drink. In the first few weeks, I was surprised to find that my starting intake was over 30 drinks a week, with just 1-2 dry days. Here's what my stats looked like in the first week of tracking:\n\n**Starting stats (week of 2/24/20)**\n\n* Total weekly drinks: 31\n* Total weekly dry days: 2\n* Alcohol calories per week: 4,650\n* Poor nights of sleep from drinking: 5\n* Money spent on alcohol: \\~$155/week\n\nThe calories and sleep metrics are the ones that really stood out to me. I was effectively adding 2 extra days of eating to my week in the form of alcohol, and costing myself less optimal sleep most nights of the week. Just this awareness served as great motivation to cutback.\n\n5 months of daily tracking later, I've been able to make a huge impact on my overall consumption, and I'm feeling the health benefits. Here's what a typical week looks for me now:\n\n**Last week's stats (week of 7/13/20)**\n\n* Total weekly drinks: 14\n* Total weekly dry days: 4\n* Alcohol calories per week: 2,100\n* Poor nights of sleep from drinking: 3\n* Money spent on alcohol: \\~$70/week\n\nTaking my first week as a baseline, the health improvements from this small behavior change have been massive.\n\n**What this means for my health (and wallet)**\n\n* I've cut calories from alcohol by 2,550 per week (basically a full day of eating)\n* I've added 2 extra nights of uninterrupted sleep to my week each week\n* I'm saving almost $100 a week that previously went to booze\n\nI still enjoy drinking, and as you can see from my trend chart above I do have heavier drinking weeks here and there.

This isn't about how my body looks anymore, this is about owing it to myself to have my brain thriving every day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - was unhealthy for a whole year. Now I'm much healthier.

The problem is.. \n\nI don't know how to cook for one, and two I don't know how to combine these properly. At all. I seem to only find info about what individual items to eat but not when/how and in what combination if that makes sense.

{"title": "My eating habits are all messed up...need someone to knock some sense into me", "selftext": "Heads up this will probably be long.  I don't think I've ever written about this in detail so I'll probably ramble.\n\nAbout me: mid 30s female.  I became aware of my weight for the first time about age 6.  My mom was heavy and spoke about it openly...so I guess that's how it got into my head.  I was average weight as a kid but got chubby in 3rd grade.  Got teased for it and kind of started to hate my body.  I also matured early so started developing around that time...got my first period at age 10 in 4th grade.  Bad acne and started getting anxiety attacks (gosh isn't puberty fun!).  My body sort of felt like the enemy.  But I was really into dancing back in those days so I had a strange dichotomy of hating my body and enjoying it at the same time.  The \"chubby\" phase didn't last too long...I was a little overweight but as I became a teenager no one seemed to be bothered by that.  I also was dealing with anxiety issues.  Those issues sometimes made it difficult for me to eat...this helped keep my weight in check but also made it so that no one wanted to mention anything about my eating habits bc they k re it was a sensitive subject for me.  In high school I always wanted to lose like 5 lbs.  I was about 5'5\" and about 140.  I think I wore like a size 8 or 10...so quite average.  I never had much in the way of boobs but carried most of my weight in my hips/thighs/butt (which probably made me look thinner than I was).  I started to feel a little more comfortable in my body during these years.... especially when I got a boyfriend and saw how attracted he was to my body.\n\nOk, so, fast forward.  I was in my 20s and my weight fluctuates a lot. My highest is probably 170 lowest is probably 130.  The low points always seem to come during periods of anxiety or heartbreak.  I'm working an office job so I don't get much exercise that way.  I try some hardcore diets like paleo and have good success but when I attempt to go back to more moderate ways of eating, I always backslide and undo everything.  I try to consistently work out but don't have much success with that.  Basically I can do hard core perfection in terms of diet and exercise for like a month at a time but after that I seem to go off the rails.\n\nSo now I'm in my 30s and things are different.  The lowest my weight has been in the last several years has been like 155.  This was after a breakup where I lost some weight.  Unfortunately I have gained all of that back plus some.  I'm now hovering around 180.  I'm still only five foot five so this is not ideal.  I've started working out more consistently and eating healthier overall... But nothing seems to be changing.  I think I'm finally facing the facts that my body has just changed, my metabolism has slowed down, and making small changes are just not enough anymore to get me where I want to be.\n\nSo where does that leave me?  I need to make some larger changes and they need to be long-term.  I have the memories of hardcore diets from years past and I don't want to go that route again.  I'd like to find a way that I can eat healthier the majority of the time and with smaller portion sizes overall.  But I also know myself well enough that, if I try to restrict myself too much, when I do take a break or a cheat or whatever you want to call it...my tendency is to go overboard and have a hard time getting back on the healthy bandwagon.  So how do I moderate that tendency.\n\nFor me I think tracking is key.  I don't really want to track calories or macros or anything... But I do think tracking certain things might be helpful.  For example, I know some people do a cheat day once a week...while I like the idea of building some flexibility into the diet from the start, one day a week doesn't sound ideal.  I'd rather just give myself 3 cheat meals a week (or something similar) that I can use when I want.  So I don't feel that binge feeling of wanting to go nuts on the cheat day. \n\n I've tried this method before and had some limited success.  But here is what happened that didn't work:\n\n1) I think there is a piece of my brain that is a little bit obsessive and a bit of a perfectionist (I'd imagine it's probably the same part of my brain that's prone to anxiety).  So there were times in the past when I had planned for a cheat meal and when the time came my brain sort of stopped wanting it...I sort of thought to myself \"let me hold off on this for now and see how much longer I can go without a cheat\".  Not a big deal in theory but I think that when I do this too much it pushes me in the direction of trying to be too perfect with my eating... Which then can lead to a binge when I make a \"mistake\".  \n\n2) I start to play games in my head about what constitutes a \"cheat\".  When I'm thinking about it logically it seems pretty obvious.  But in the moment, especially if I'm super hungry, I start to blur the lines of what I'm \"allowed\".  An example would be something like \"there were cookies at work and I had two of them... Does that constitute a cheat?  It was only a couple of cookies...no big deal\".  Or it might be something like \"I really want the salad with fried chicken but I should eat grilled chicken instead... Surely doing the fried chicken instead of the grilled doesn't necessitate using a cheat meal...it's a salad afterall\".  these are just a couple of examples but it can lead to a slippery slope or the lines between healthy and cheat are blurred.\n\nAnd that's Ultimately what fucks me up so much.  I don't like the idea that certain foods are inherently bad or good.  Food is food and my goal should just be to focus on eating healthy MOST of the time.  But my brain wants what it wants and I've learned that I just don't do moderation very well.  So if I don't do moderation well and extreme diets also aren't my thing what else is there?  \n\nI know I've been rambling for awhile now.  And I feel like overall I'm getting a little obsessed with food.  Which is completely the opposite of the goal.  Yesterday my partner and I we're talking about wanting to lose weight in the new year... And we started talking about different diet options we could do.  We started making rules for this new diet...and my first questions were about what \"cheats\" we had built in.  It seems so counterintuitive because I should be focusing on all the healthy things I'm going to do not all of the few instances where I won't do those healthy things.  But that is the way my brain goes every time I try to make these changes \n\nAnyway...enough rambling.

No more hiccups and heartburn to be seen. Also besides that I avoid drinking any liquids immediately after as well. Only a tiny sip if my mouth be feeling really dry, but other than that no liquids two hours after finishing the meals. I recommend this method to anyone who\u2019s suffering of heartburn and any other stomach issues. \nScience behind it is simple. Drinking water together with ur food dilutes the digestive juices and you end up having too much acidity in ur stomach. This is when things get bad. So do this trick to let the digestive system do it\u2019s job and you\u2019re good to go.

I began eating more fruit as a healthy source of sugar, but my silver bullet is dark chocolate. I eat 4 blocks of it most days, always 70%, and combined with fruit I no longer require pop but I still drink it occasionally if I need a boost. I mostly drink water, peppermint tea, and flavored sparkling water such as Bubbly. It has no sugar or sugar substitutes, just carbonated water and \"natural flavor\". These drinks combined with dark chocolate and fruit have changed my diet for the better. I'm 6'1\" and I went from 240 pounds down to about 205 and I look and feel a lot better.

And just letting myself get so hungry that I make bad decisions later in the day I think has been a contributing factor to my weight gain.\n\nI bought a small whiteboard which I stuck to the inside of my front door at home... And it just has a little note to myself to make sure I take my gym clothes, bottle of water, and healthy snacks with me to work.  That way I always have something healthy to snack on, water to drink so that I more easily avoid soda, and clothes to make sure I have no excuse for not going to the gym after work.\n\nToday I leveled up even further though. I went to the grocery store during the work day and stocked up on healthy snacks that I can keep in the office.  Most of it is stuff that won't go bad quickly... Some Lean cuisine individual pizzas, rice cakes, peanut butter, 100 calorie fruit and nut packages, cheese sticks, and raisins.  I'll probably also get in the habit of buying things like apples each week and keep those in the office too...but I didn't want to do that today considering it's a Friday and I won't be there all weekend.  \n\nOf course, sometimes when I have food on hand it's not appealing...but just having something so I don't get famished I think will be very helpful.

A recent study of more than [22,000 people](https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070688) found that people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had a 19 percent higher likelihood of early death and a 32 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease compared with people who ate few ultra-processed foods.\n\nSo how do we break our dependence on ultra-processed foods? You can start by learning which foods in your diet count as ultra-processed. You don\u2019t necessarily have to give them up. But once you know how to spot an ultra-processed food, it\u2019s easy to find a less-processed substitute.\n\nAt their core, they are industrial concoctions containing a multitude of additives: salt, sugar and oils combined with artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, stabilizers and preservatives. Typically they\u2019re subjected to multiple processing methods that transform their taste, texture and appearance into something not found in nature. Think Frosted Flakes, Hot Pockets, doughnuts, hot dogs, cheese crackers and boxed macaroni & cheese.\n\nResearch shows that our bodies seem to react differently to ultra-processed foods compared with similar foods that are not so highly processed.\"\n\n*You can read the full story* [*here*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/27/ultraprocessed-foods/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=aviva)  \n*There's no paywall, although you may be asked to register for a free account.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/xpl65o/ultraprocessed_foods_are_linked_with_chronic/", "created_utc": 1664295471.0, "score": 45, "author": "AvivaLoeb", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/xpl65o/ultraprocessed_foods_are_linked_with_chronic/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

A slice of spinach and swiss quiche or a veggie frittata with some kind of fruit on the side (usually an apple, grapes, or pineapple) Sometimes I'll do tuna or egg salad made with avocado instead of mayo with salt and vinegar kale chips (made with apple cider vinegar)\n\nDinner: a quinoa bowl with roasted brussel sprouts, sweet potato, and sauteed mushrooms, onion, and garlic. A few nights a week I'll do a tuna/salmon filet in the place of mushrooms\n\nBedtime Snack: pistachios, dried cherries/blueberries, grapes, and a few slices of red pepper cheddar that I get from a local smokehouse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much the gist of it, with a little variation. A few night a week I also make \"golden milk\" which is basically coconut milk with tumeric, ginger, and cinnamon with organic maple syrup to sweeten. I also eat sourdough toast with olive oil and za'atar occasionally but try not to too often because I'm doing my best to avoid gluten/wheat (I'm sensitive to it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcome!!

{"title": "Down a dress size 15 days after Quitting Sugar", "selftext": " Last week I weighed myself and found I had lost 5 pounds after quitting the absolutely ridiculous amount of added sugar I was consuming every day. I have been looking at the sugar content of all the food and drink I'm consuming recently, and my old sugar habit was even worse than I thought. I am so embarrassed to even admit this, but on average I was ingesting OVER 200 GRAMS of sugar each day!!!!! That's 780 calories a day, or 5500 a week. I always knew, somewhere in the back of my mind that I really do not eat very much, volume wise. I also knew the food I eat is fairly healthy. I knew that being borderline obese was SOLEY down to the sugary drinks I existed on. But I didn't expect the weight/inch loss to be this immediate.\n\nAs I have mentioned before, I do not trust the scales much. But I couldn't find my tape measure. Well earlier on, I tried on this beautiful silk designer maxi skirt that I bought from a thrift store a while ago but have only worn a couple of times due to it being so small, it's size 14 AUS (18 USA). When I bought it, it went on, but I had to wear the band very high up so the zip would close. But now it fits just right and stops the perfect length just 3cms from the ground now it isn't hoiked up.\n\nI immediately searched all my drawers and cupboards, found my tape measure and was delighted to find that my hips now measure 41.3 inches, instead of the 43 they were just two weeks ago! Omg!!!! This is in just TWO WEEKS!!!! :O Crazy! I am officially a size 14 again (in most stores), and I will be able to shop anywhere without worrying if they will have my size available. I am so happy I have done this. It's very easy to not eat sugar any more, but I have just given up smoking as well, so of course I am worried that might make me gain. I will just stick to my old motto of 'if you don't buy it, you won't try it', and maybe start going to the gym if absolutely necessary.

So now that I've quit smoking, I've decided the next step is to eat healthy.  \n\nWhat I've Done  : I'm soda free and Junk food free as of 2 weeks ago. I've been eating a lot of protein.

Or chicken and brown rice. For dinner sometimes its eggs, wheat toast and a protein shake, sometimes its the healthy choice meals i can get from the grocery store with a banana and a protein shake. \n\nMy question: I'm wondering what other advice people would give someone who has no idea how to eat healthy and burn stomach fat.

{"title": "Can\u2019t maintain diet and it sucks. Is it worth it eating healthy??only live once", "selftext": "So for about a year or so now I\u2019ve had somewhat of an unhealthy relationship with food. 20 yrs old college student and Let me start by saying growing up , I ate tons and tons of fast food, McDonald\u2019s about a few times a week at least along with sweets.  This still weighs on my brain today and is  one of my theories as to why I\u2019m an overall anxious person and have been- I sometimes feel I have OCD and can\u2019t fathom the damage I just have done to my body for all this years. \nThis continued until I was about 16 and I started working out and eating healthy(healthier). I never overanalyzed during these few years but I did make it a point to avoid eating any sweet but I still usually ate 1 meal a day outside(healthy-ish fast food) the house while eliminating certain fast food while incorporating more homemade meats, fruits and lots of veggies. I also ate till I was 100 percent full- not like those fist sized portion size. \n      This worked out  fine for  a while until COVID hit and it was during the beginning of this that I really started to become paranoid about my health and in general. I began to feel sluggish, probably as a result of my overeating- I admit I\u2019m an emotional eater- and unintentional restriction of healthy carbs and excess protein. Among  other things I became paranoid about my  elevated heart rate and became depressed, a ton of bad stuff. \n    I then became inspired after watching that vegan documentary and became vegan for about a year- later I realized there\u2019s no evidence a vegan diet is any better- and it was at this point that I instantly began having insomnia and it\u2019s never resolved. I eventually switched back to a healthy Whole Foods diet and while I physically felt at my best, the constant feelings of deprivation really began to weigh on me.   Tried cooking for myself in my apartment but food never came out tasty or satisfying. It came to a point where eating 100 percent  healthy came at the expense of truly enjoying life  and a way to boost my self esteem- as a way to feel superior, in a way similar to how I started taking up basketball and working out from what I saw in high school with those really popular athletic kids.  You can quickly begin to see how my entire character is defined by this. \n         At what point is eating completely healthy not worth it. I feel so guilty at time seeing  how ignorant my family and friends are to this while my bum Ass sits  at home eating healthy , thinking all day about it, unable to sleeep. I know for a fact I won\u2019t feel as good if I go back to my old healthy-ish diet , knowing what I know now. But if it comes with  the improved mental health aspect, how worthwhile is it really to adopt a healthy diet??

But my favorite soup, French Onion soup, is made with beef broth. I figured if I do a vegetarian version of this, it would encourage me to consume less meat / meat products while also being delicious. Hope it's a decent idea for you guys too, and I'll post a recipe because I believe it can be a good first step, and an encouraging one at that, for someone to make their own vegetarian recipe that tastes incredible:\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 5 Large Yellow or Sweet Onions Thinly chopped      into half moons\n* 3 Tbsp Butter\n* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 5 Cloves of Garlic Minced\n* 3 Tbsp Flour Optional\n* \u00bd Cup Balsamic Vinegar or Dry Red or White      Wine Can also use Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 2 Tsp Worcestershire\n* 6 Cups Beef or Vegetable Broth/Stock\n* 1\u00bd Cup Lentils Green or Brown\n* 1 Bay Leaf\n* 2 tsp Dried Thyme Can also use Fresh\n* Salt & Pepper to Taste\n* Gruyere Cheese Or Swiss, Gouda, Fontina\n* French Bread Or any crusty Bread\n* 1-3 tbsp of Butter and 1 tsp of fresh minced garlic for      garlic butter ( for bread)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Slice your onions in half. Next cut into thin \"half moon\" slices.\n\n2. Add butter to pan and melt. Now add olive oil and onions and stir. Cook down/caramelize onions for about 30-40 minutes over medium/medium low heat until golden brown. Monitor the onions and be sure to slightly stir for the last 5 minutes to prevent burning.\n\n3. When your onions are about 5 minutes away from being caramelized, add your minced garlic and stir. If you would like to thicken your soup at this point (optional) add 3 tbsp of flour and stir.\n\n4. If you also would like to deglaze pan, add your vinegar or wine to the pan and stir ( making sure to scrape up all the goodies on the bottom of the pan). I highly recommend this step as it helps develop extra flavor for the soup.\n\n5. Now add your stock of choice, Worcestershire, dried thyme, bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste. Be sure to look at how much sodium your stock has before adding extra salt to your soup. Add lentils and bring to a boil.\n\n6. Turn heat down to medium low and cover pot. Cook for 20-30 minutes until lentils have softened.\n\n7. Mix minced garlic and slightly softened butter together in a small bowl. Add to your bread slices. If you do not have oven safe bowls, add bread with garlic butter and sliced cheese onto a baking dish and broil until cheese has melted. Place sliced bread on top of soup in your bowl. If you have oven safe bowls, add bread directly to top of soup in bowl with cheese and add bowl to broiler. Broil until slightly golden and melted. Top with fresh or dried thyme and enjoy!

{"title": "Health Benefits of Kiwi Fruit", "selftext": " \n\nKnowing about the nutrients present in Kiwi doesn't give you enough proof to convince you of the everyday intake of Kiwi. To make you think about why you are still not eating Kiwi, let's jump into the unbelievable facts and incredible health benefits of kiwi fruits.\u00a0\n\n### 1. A Robust Antioxidants\n\nThis fruit is infused with a massive amount of antioxidants. These antioxidants can neutralize the free radicals and make it a shield that helps you protect yourself from any bodily damage.\u00a0\n\n### 2. Helps in Weight Loss\n\nAhh!! This is a critical point. Almost 9 out of 10 people are searching for a healthy solution to this problem. Let me tell you that incorporating Kiwi in your diet helps you lose weight as they are deficient in energy density and calories.\u00a0\n\n### 3. Helps to reduce Nervousness and Stress\n\nKiwi is an excellent solution for the reduction of nervousness and stress. Anxiety attacks can sometimes worsen; the vitamin C present in Kiwi will prevent your body from anxiety attacks and nervousness. Now don't forget to enumerate Kiwi into your fruit lists.\u00a0\n\n### 4. Fights Anemia\n\nLow hemoglobin? Suffering from anemia? Fed up of medicines? Switch to the natural medicine of anemia \u2013 Kiwi! Thanks to the Vitamin C present in Kiwi, the absorption power of iron from food is enhanced.\n\n### 5. Is Cardio-Protective\n\nIf you want to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, start taking Kiwi fruits from today. This small, fuzzy-skinned, juicy fruit can decrease the platelet aggregation level as well as blood triglycerides, the two most common risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.\u00a0\n\n### 6. Treats Asthma\n\nNothing can be more painful than not being able to breathe. Isn't it! Most people say that Asthma doesn't have a particular medicine that can cure the patient 100%. But Kiwi has magical features that can certainly help you to treat Asthma. The reason behind the magic is Vitamin C. Kiwi built a protective cover against the germs that cause respiratory diseases.\n\n### 7. Prevents Constipation\n\nConstipation may seem like a common thing to you, but it harms the body. To those who have constipation problems, Kiwi can help you to get rid of this problem. You might still be a stranger because Kiwi is rich in dietary fibers, which will help you maintain regular bowel movements. The inclusion of Kiwi fruits in the breakfast will undoubtedly help you to improve the production of stool. Moreover, the fuzzy skin of the Kiwi helps to get rid of toxins out of the body and the intestinal tract.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n### 8. Controlling Blood Pressure\n\nIf you are a hypotension patient and want to control your BP, Kiwi can become your best friend. Kiwi has unique characteristics that help in controlling the sodium in the blood. You will also need potassium which will balance the minerals in the blood. But excessive intake of potassium can cause hypertension. Hence Kiwi should be taken by the person with hypotension and avoided by high blood pressure or hypertension.\n\n### 9. Beneficial During Pregnancy\n\nPregnancy is a critical time for a lady. They have to be very cautious about how they live and what they are eating, as, during pregnancy, they are not the only person who is eating; a tiny life is also taking the food. Hence they have to plan their diet carefully. According to the nutritionist, Kiwi plays an essential role in the balanced diet of pregnant women. We can find folic acid in Kiwi, which is very important for pregnant women because it helps develop the fetus's essential organs inside the womb. Folic acid also defends against congenital disabilities. Hence if you are a pregnant lady, you know what you need to start consuming!\n\n### 10. Strengthens the Immune System\n\nTo be healthy, one needs to strengthen the immune system. Kiwi knows the secret to enhancing the immune system. As we all know, vitamin C is essential to enhance the immune system, and Kiwi is the best example of a fruit with maximum vitamin C, just like an orange. According to RDA for Indians (2020), a sedentary adult man requires 80 mg of vitamin C every day. A sedentary adult female requires 65 mg/day of vitamin C. Therefore, eating one kiwi fruit in the whole day can quickly fulfill the vitamin C requirement as it has 92.7 mg/100 gm of vitamin C. In this way, Kiwi helps increase the immune system and help you defend against harmful germs.\n\n## Benefits of Kiwi fruit for Weight Loss and Skin\n\nMost people are curious about knowing more about how Kiwi fruit help in losing body weight and makes the skin look young and healthy. Let's take a look at them.\n\n### Benefits of Kiwi fruit for Weight Loss\n\n* Kiwis are nutrient-dense and are an excellent source of vitamin C, folate, vitamin K, and fiber, and have powerful health benefits.\n* A study conducted on 41 people with prediabetes who ate two golden kiwis per day for 12 weeks found that they experienced higher vitamin C levels, changes in blood pressure, and weight loss.\n* Additional studies found that Kiwis provide additional weight loss benefits like controlling blood sugar, improving cholesterol, and supporting gut health.\n* Moreover, Kiwis have a low GI resulting in smaller blood sugar spikes. Diets high in fiber from fruits and vegetables have been shown to promote weight loss, increase fullness, and improve gut health. Kiwis are rich in dietary fiber. One small, peeled fruit or 69 g has over 2 g of fiber, while the peel alone provides 1 g of additional fiber.\n\n### Benefits of Kiwi fruit for Skin\n\n* The benefits of Kiwi fruit for skin comes from the polyphenols and antioxidant vitamins present in the Kiwi fruit.\n* Kiwi contains a polyphenol called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG can protect your skin from oxidative stress and possibly even skin cancer.\n* Studies show that vitamin C may limit skin damage from UV radiation. The vitamin also boosts collagen formation and may prevent skin discoloration. Vitamin E protect your skin from damage caused by UV radiation and oxidative stress.\n* Lutein and zeaxanthin can reduce dark spots on your skin, especially when combined. They also increase the levels of carotenoids, which protect skin from the harmful effects of sunlight.\n* The peel, or \u201cskin,\u201d of kiwifruit is rich in these nutrients than the soft, sweet interior. To get the most nutrients present in Kiwi, try eating it next time you enjoy a kiwi fruit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/123kyvf/health_benefits_of_kiwi_fruit/", "created_utc": 1679918521.0, "score": 19, "author": "rockz3r", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/123kyvf/health_benefits_of_kiwi_fruit/", "html_title": ""}

YEAH, I'm going in insane, and it definitely taking a tole on my mental health. \n\nAnd before anyone tells me, yes, I'm aware that it's all supposed to be healthy for me and that I shouldn't whine. BUT I've also been used to eating junk food my whole life, so I'm not used to eating healthy for longer than I have before. This is all new to me. \n\nSo I guess I'm a bit fragile right now? And if anyone has any recipes to give me, I'm totally down for them. And if this isn't the sub for it, please tell me where else I can put this in.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/ocuax3/anyone_have_recipes_for_someone_whos_on_a/", "created_utc": 1625302132.0, "score": 17, "author": "SeparateKey0", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/ocuax3/anyone_have_recipes_for_someone_whos_on_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Meals", "selftext": "Sorry in advance if I sound too demanding, or if I'm doing this wrong, but this problem is really worrying me.\n\nHello, I'm a 13y.o. F, and due to me trying to lose some weight on my own, I messed up my eating habits completely. The way I now eat, I eat two meals a day, an apple and a little something else for breakfast, and dinner, which stops when I manage to get myself to stop eating. Now I want to go back to eating normally, and not just shoving everything in front of me in my mouth, but it's hard. I get the urge to eat, and I just keep on going. I honestly feel like the only way not to eat too much is by not eating in the first place. That leads me to the next problem, because I don't know how much to eat, the way I see if I ate too much is by weighing myself, and if I go on eating unbothered, I can gain up to half a kg a day. To solve this problem, I ask my Mom (Single parent) if I'm eating too much, but she thinks that I don't eat that much (Most likely me eating my main meal at dinner), and even if I gain half a kg a day, she says it's normal, because I'm still growing. But honestly, I just have no idea. I don't know if the weight I'm gaining weight is normal, because when we eat meals, the food isn't portioned out, we just take food from dishes until we're full. This has led to arguments about me being angry for her not taking it seriously, because she thinks it's normal. But I really think otherwise. If I go eating fully intuitive at the moment with my current eating habits, I'll end up overweight by the end of the month. So my two main questions are how much should I eat at each meal? And is gaining this weight at my age normal? For more context, I'm pretty much a couch potato (Though I'm looking for things I can apply to), and I think around 164cm in height. Any advice is appreciated, thank you in advance, and sorry for anything I might have done wrong.\n\nEdit: Hello, thank you for all the advice. While the problem isn't going to fix itself within a day, I'm getting the idea that Mom is right, gaining the weight is normal. Maybe sometime I'll get the book mentioned in one of the comments.

Today I sat down and wrote about what seems to trigger me to give up and over indulge, and how I might take steps to address these. \n\nOne thing that I could not really create a solution for was a psychological issue relating to how I perceive me-time. I live alone, and have no commitments aside from work, so after work and on weekends I totally relax and just like to do whatever I want. One side effect of this, is that I really struggle to then re-impose restrictions on myself to not eat junk and actually cook a healthy meal. \n\nWhen I do choose to eat healthy/cook dinner during these times, I feel kind of peeved off like I've not been allowed to properly de-stress or relax.

{"title": "Stomach/digestion issues with latest attempt at healthy eating", "selftext": "Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, please advise if it's not. I couldn't think of anywhere else. Also this is long, thanks to anyone for reading.\n\nA bit over two years ago I (33M) made some permanent changes to my diet and lost quite a lot of weight. In the time since I fell off a bit on the healthy eating, while not going back to anything like the way I was eating before, and maintained my weight. About two months ago I decided to get back into it in a serious way in order to lose more weight. It's going well on that front, but I'm running into some problems this time that I didn't have last time.\n\nI won't go into all the details because it's gross, but the main issues have been a lot of constipation and bloating, plus some indigestion which is unusual for me. Not like wind bloating, but feeling like everything from my esophogus down is actually swollen. I'm finding myself eating small amounts of food even when hungry, or even foregoing eating for long periods, because it feels like I'm still stuffed up from the last time I ate. A lot of the time it almost feels like everything down there is \"paralyzed\", like there's just nothing moving.\n\nI've been prone to constipation my whole life, but this is another level. It all started off after my latest push towards healthy eating 2+ months ago and has been getting worse steadily; going back to eating less healthy food seems to alleviate it, but obviously that wouldn't be my preferred solution.\n\nMy old unhealthy diet caused a lot of digestive problems of its own (shovelling huge amounts of carbs into your body constantly will do that, who could guess), which the big change alleviated, so it's been frustrating to now run into these new issues. I have an appointment with a gastroentorologist coming up for unrelated reasons, so I'll be sure to tell him about what's been going on, but I suspect the problem is in my diet given that the issues are so tied to what I'm eating. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong, specifically.\n\nI eat mostly steamed vegetables, rice, salmon, apples, chicken breasts, sometimes chicken burgers, homemade beef stew, occassionally pasta, and of course a takeaway or other \"cheat\" meal every few weeks. This is the same diet that I was on religiously back during my initial weight loss, and I didn't have any of the issues I'm currently experiencing--the opposite, in fact.\n\nThe only two changes I've made this time are giving up bannanas (I have chronic migraines and the sugar was setting them off) and having sugar free greek yoghurt and low-sugar muesli for breakfast, but it doesn't seem like such minor changes could be having such dramatic impacts. I've also been eating a lot less bread, is it possible that's involved? Bread has typically caused bloating and cramps forme, which is partially why I stopped eating it to begin with.\n\nAnyway, thanks to anyone who read this far and who might be able to give me some tips. I probably need to sit down with a dietician, and of course the gastroentorologist will hopefully rule out any medical problems at play, but I thought I'd ask here in the meantime.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/nj7i5r/stomachdigestion_issues_with_latest_attempt_at/", "created_utc": 1621775601.0, "score": 14, "author": "Grace_Omega", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/nj7i5r/stomachdigestion_issues_with_latest_attempt_at/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What are some easy, no brain, and healthy meals that I could eat every single day?", "selftext": "I've tried different fad diets over the years such as keto or intermittent fasting. Never been good at keeping track like calories or what I eat. They usually work for a little bit, but then eventually Temptation goes over my head and I give in to cravings and binge. I want to get out of that cycle and I'm something sustainable that I can stick to.\n\nOne idea I have would be to eat the same thing every single day. So I would always keep the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This would make things super easy for me because I would know exactly what I am supposed to eat and when. I could make sure that I get all the necessary nutrients and stuff I need for the day in those meals.\n\nI have a few problems with that though. First is that I work in a restaurant that has literally one healthy option that I am sick to death of. I do get free meals when I work, which is definitely a Temptation that I've been trying to overcome. I tried doing some meal prep to take food to work, but it just takes up too much time and energy. At my core, I am incredibly lazy. I would rather do the thing that takes the least amount of effort, and that usually involves eating free food at work or stopping at some fast food on my way home.\n\nI'm always home in the morning to make breakfast, and that's probably what I enjoy cooking the most. I'm a big fan of avocado toast and eggs. The rest of the meals I'm not sure about. Ideally it would be something that I can meal prep to take with me to work. My goal is to eventually lose weight, so I have no idea what kind of diet I would need to have.

{"title": "Healthy Eating Protocol", "selftext": " \n\n* **I'm not a doctor, this list is purely educational and my own opinion, always consult medical professionals before trying the below eating lifestyle.**\n* **Grocery List! (What and What Not to Buy!)**  \n\n   * Note, Certified Organic food (look for the organic label) is always better in both taste and quality, but do the best you can with your budget and available stores\n   * **Meat**  \n\n      * **Approved**: (Note, the below meats are to be bought in their natural state, AKA a portion of uncooked meat that needs to be refrigerated or frozen, so that you know you are getting just meat when you eat.)\n      * Chicken\n      * Beef/Steak\n      * Eggs\n      * Fish\n      * Turkey\n      * Shrimp\n      * Pork\n      * Anything else that used to be a living animal\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Deli meats, like sliced ham, sliced turkey, AKA the sandwich meats you put on your sandwich as a kid\n      * Bacon, Bologna, Ham, pepperoni - These contain Pork (which is fine), but then add a bunch of other random fake food stuff or refined sugar and other chemicals.\n      * Any meat that has some kind of chemical formula added on the ingredients, AKA polysorbate or something to \u201cpreserve freshness\u201d. The ingredients should just be meat (and possibly salt if there is a second ingredient)\n   * **Fats**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Walnuts, Almonds, pecans, any kind of seed or nut (including cashew or peanut) - just read the ingredients to ensure that the only thing added to the nuts is salt, if anything.\n      * Avocados\n      * Olives\n      * Olive Oil, Avocado oil, Macadamia Oil (attempt to get all of these in a glass container, or else the oil will spoil and get rancid)\n      * Butter (only thing added is salt)\n      * Cheese - read the label and ensure it is just milk, salt, and enzymes, and no random other stuff added like carrageenan.\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Peanut, vegetable, canola oil. Essentially if it isn\u2019t the above good oils, don\u2019t get it.\n      * Again, read all ingredients of all packages, since the above bad oils sneak into many products, especially nuts.\n      * Nearly every dressing on earth has some of the above bad oils in it, read the label before you buy.\n      * Margarine - this is basically made up of the above bad oils\n   * **Vegetables and fruits**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Could you go to a farm and find it in the state you are buying it? If so, then it is good. Prechopped veggies/fruits are fine as well.\n      * Some easy ones for my wife and I are spinach, cucumber, celery, cherry tomatoes, onions, sweet potatoes, normal potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, squash, cauliflower, broccoli.\n      * For fruits, apples, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, blueberries, bananas are all good.\n      * Frozen Veggies are OK, if you read the ingredients and ensure that there are NO foreign chemicals added to preserve food.\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Canned Veggies, veggies with random chemicals added.\n      * Canned Fruits, dehydrated fruits (these should only be used as a \u201ctreat\u201d since they are super sugary but without as many nutrients),\n   * **Drinks**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Water. Get a water filter for your tap or get a water filter jug. You\u2019ll notice the difference in water taste. Purchase spring water from the store if you want bottled water, not purified water. Reverse Osmosis water is the best from what I've researched, consider it an investment into your health, and always drink from glass bottles, not plastic or metal, due to how metal and plastic \"leeches\" chemicals into the water.\n      * Milk - Research for yourself (maybe on DuckDuckGo or something not as heavily censored as Google) the risks and rewards of raw, unpasteurized milk\n      * Coffee - No added sugar allowed, only milk or cream (again, the cream must be milk based and not made up of hydrogenated oils). Use sparingly.\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Soda, fruit juices (orange/apple) this will cause you to drink excess calories and sugar.\n      * No diet sodas either, these have artificial sweeteners which are NOT food and cause harm to your body.\n      * Alcohol - From a health perspective, alcohol is not needed (if you are tanking up on veggies and fruits), and it often has a ton of added sugar and random other stuff, and it actually negatively affects your sleep quality when taken too close to bedtime, even if it initially makes you feel relaxed. Use at your discretion.\n   * **Complex Carbs**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Any Kind of potato, rice (read packages if you are going to get the microwavable kinds), oatmeal, quinoa, other grains, and beans. The beans can be canned, just ensure that there is no added sugar or random chemicals to them, AKA baked beans or refried beans.\n      * Sometimes bread, again read the label and see what is added to the bread. If it sweetened by honey or stevia, then its fine, but generally most bread has a lot of chemical additives and refined sugar added. Use sparingly.\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * White bread (including tortillas), most types of bread (due to above reasons), pasta (same reasons as bread).\n   * **Sweeteners**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Honey, Stevia, agave, fruit based sweeteners\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Refined sugar (brown or white), Splenda, any \u201cno calorie\u201d sweetener like aspartame or sucralose or other \u201cdiet\u201d sweeteners found in sodas.\n      * Sugar is added to nearly EVERY packaged good and frozen good (from pizza to bread to ice cream), so read the labels of what you buy if you want to buy something prepackaged instead of the raw ingredients above.\n   * **Seasonings**  \n\n      * Salt (it can be iodized), but I prefer the grinder salt.\n      * As for other seasonings, just ensure it doesn\u2019t have \u201cspices\u201d in the ingredients since that is probably MSG. Pretty much any spices are fair game then, read the label and ensure it doesn\u2019t have any man-made chemical in the name (polysorbate, glutamate, etc.), and you should be fine.\n* **Healthy Eating Lifestyle Tips and Tricks**  \n\n   * Eat meat with each meal, and throw in a veggie or a fruit as well. Meat increases feelings of fullness, as well as builds/preserves muscle mass. Try a fist full of meat and however many veggies or fruits you can fit on your plate. Veggies and fruits are God\u2019s vitamins!\n   * Meal prep lots of cooked meat, so you don't have to constantly be cooking throughout the week, I use Blue Diamond pans from Walmart to cook up large amounts of chicken thighs, ground beef, or fish, for the week.\n   * Fruit is often demonized since it contains sugar, however, it is quickly absorbed into the body and doesn\u2019t contribute to weight gain as much as complex carbs, see below for explanation.\n   * Calories are either going to come from complex carbs (rice/potatoes/oatmeal/bread) or from fats (like nuts or seeds or avocado).\n   * Fats are a good source of calorie, since they don\u2019t spike blood sugar and therefore won\u2019t lead to you holding onto excess body fat as easily. Try to eat fats at each meal or as a snack until you feel full. Try half a handful of seeds or nuts at first, to see how full you feel after.\n   * Complex carbs are best saved either before exercise, or at the last meal of the day. Complex carbs raise blood sugar and serotonin levels (which makes you feel happy and relaxed), both of which are good to have before exercise, or to have before bed, so that you go to bed with a happy mind. Excess carbs throughout the day will lead to the body to only burn carbs as fuel, and excess bodyweight will start to occur, since the body won\u2019t burn fat as fuel if it has carbs as an available source. Experiment with how **little** complex carbs you can eat before exercise or at the end of the day, to get the desired effect of a good workout or a happy sleep. More strenuous exercise is going to need more complex and simple carbs (oatmeal and honey, white rice and grapes, etc.) in order for your body to be primed to perform.\n   * Try to eat mostly 3 \u2013 4 meals a day, as opposed to constantly grazing. The body won\u2019t burn bodyfat if it is constantly having a full or half full stomach, since the blood sugar is continually spiking. This is why intermittent fasting is so effective, or why your stomach sometimes growls when you wake up as well as you look leaner, since your body is ready for food and is burning fat. Space out your meals, and try to combine snacks into the next meal, to give your stomach time to empty and your blood sugar to stabilize.\n   * Constantly drink water throughout day, add a pinch of salt here and there to ensure your body is actually absorbing water as opposed to it just flowing through you. You could attempt to drink \u00bd your bodyweight in ounces of water (i.e. a 200 lb man will drink 100 oz of water), but I find it more effective to just get a glass water bottle and drink from it every hour or so. Experiment and find an easy water-drinking-routine for yourself.\n   * **If you're trying to lose weight:**  \n\n      * Sleep is king in all things health, especially with losing weight, see my post on sleep here: [How to Get Good Sleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/11ijzho/my_sleep_protocol_wish_i_knew_how_to_sleep_earlier/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n      * Commit to a pain-free, sustainable, exercise routine, I recommend this: [https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/). Try it for at least a month.\n      * Focus on eating quality, organic delicious meals that you'll actually eat, from the above list. Search for FB groups of healthy recipes. Throw out any disapproved foods from the house, to make it harder to cheat.\n      * Start out with baby steps, like drinking water instead of soda, and cooking at home more.\n      * Really challenge yourself to get most of your calories from fat, if not entirely for a few weeks. You will drop pounds quickly with this method, but will eventually get carb cravings. Add in carbs as prescribed above (before training, at dinner), in moderation.\n* **Sample Eating Day** \\*\\*\\* I am extremely boring when it comes to what I eat, feel free to experiment and get creative with your healthy diet!\\*\\*\\*  \n\n   * **Breakfast**  \n\n      * Drink 16 oz of water, add a dash of salt to it.\n      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top\n      * 4 stick of organic celery\n      * \u00bd handful of almonds\n   * **Lunch**  \n\n      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top\n      * 4 stick of organic celery\n      * \u00bd handful of almonds\n   * **Dinner**  \n\n      * Whatever wifey makes me \ud83d\ude0a\n   * **Preworkout**  \n\n      * 1 \u2013 1.5 cups of oatmeal, drizzle honey on it (this is if training is going to be strenuous, like all out sprints or heavy lifting)\n   * **Postworkout**  \n\n      * Honey (otherwise I will feel dizzy or weak or foggy after training)\n   * **Dessert**  \n\n      * If I have a craving, it usually is satisfied with an apple and some walnuts.\n* End Goal - To be happy, healthy, lean, strong, and be able to nurture and nourish and build up the amazing Body God has given us!\n* PS - This is about physical food, but God gives the true food - [The Gospel!](https://youtu.be/t1BWSOVNm4A)\n\n**Feel free to private message me with any questions or comments, as everyone has a different situation, and may need some guidance in taking the right next step.

{"title": "What do you wish your parents did differently?", "selftext": "tl;dr Trying to figure out how to help my 8-year-old after I had my own eating issues growing up partially due to how my parents handled food. **It's about her relationship with food NOT her weight or body type.** \n\n**The beginning:** I have a very poor relationship with food. I went on a diet for the first time in 4th grade after realizing my body was different than other kids my age. (Although, looking at pics, I was still healthy.) I watched my mom diet on and off my entire childhood, and she encouraged me to do the same. There were a ton of conversations about weight, BMI, calories, etc.\n\nI developed a binge eating problem because I felt like I was closely monitored. Plus, food made me feel good!\n\n**The recent past:** I have an 8-year-old daughter in 3rd grade. She has always been super healthy, incredibly active, and often chose veggies/fruit over chips or sweets. She has always been \"bigger\" than other kids, but that's really because she was all muscle due her active lifestyle, plus maybe genetics. \n\n**The now:** In the past 6 months or so, I have noticed her eating habits have changed. She eats snacks all day long (yes, we keep snacks in the house), large portions at meals, and is constantly saying she's hungry. We still have the same healthy snacks we had before.\n\nShe has developed a little bit of a belly and has stopped wanting to wear the shirts that show off her stomach\u2014which she recently LOVED to do. Maybe she notices? I don't want her to feel bad about her body. I also want her to feel healthy.\n\nAt her latest doctor's appointment, we were told she's 50% height and 94% weight. The doctor was about to say it out loud, but I made sure to cut her off because I don't want my daughter to have an unhealthy relationship with the scale like I do. I also don't think it's a growth spurt because her eating habits have changed, not in a \"more hungry\" way but wanting to eat more way.\n\nI can't imagine anyone would look at her and think she's unhealthy or obese. She does still have a ton of muscle! I just know it's *different* now than it was before, as is her relationship with food. \n\n**The question:** What do you wish your parents did differently when you were a kid? \n\nI know my parents tried their hardest (at least that's what I tell myself). And I'm sure I'll do something to send her to therapy some day lol. I just don't want her to have to deal with the same feelings I have about food for the rest of her life. \n\n*Hopefully this is the right forum!

At the same time, potatoes can replace flour in order to avoid all those chemicals and \"enrichments\".\n\nChard: it has high amount of Vitamins A, C, E, K, fiber and mineral traces with little calories.\n\nEggs: they're cheaper than meat and cheese, and their organic version is cheaper than organic meat too, while they provide B12, nice fat and nice sterols (HDL), and enough protein. It's actually the perfect protein. They have only 155 calories per 100 grams. Having into account that they provide B12, it's nice. Plus: it doesn't necessarily include animal suffering.\n\nFlax seeds: They provide Omega 3, omega 6, and lots of fiber. It's a good, cheap seasoning.\n\nSupplements: Magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium chloride. They are all cheap.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/zm9m46/what_are_some_of_the_most_nutrient_dense_foods/", "created_utc": 1671071115.0, "score": 10, "author": "LemonBlut", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/zm9m46/what_are_some_of_the_most_nutrient_dense_foods/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What to know about protein", "selftext": "I'm an editor at The Washington Post and we recently wrote about protein. You can read the full story here: [https://wapo.st/3BXsJhw](https://wapo.st/3BXsJhw) (this is a gift link and doesn't have a paywall)  \n\n\nHere's an excerpt from Gretchen Reynold's story:  \n\n\n**Active people need more protein than couch potatoes**  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re sedentary, you officially need about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, according to the recommended daily allowance set by the government\u2019s Food and Nutrition Board. This translates to somewhere between 45 to 60 grams of daily protein for most people who rarely exercise \u2014 or approximately two chicken breasts (about 30 grams of protein each) or a 6-ounce can of tuna (about 40 grams) and a quarter-cup of almonds (about 8 grams).But this amount is almost certainly too low for many of us. The recommendation \u201cfor protein might be enough to keep us alive, but it is too low for physically active people,\u201d said Eric Rawson, a professor of nutrition and exercise at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pa.\n\nFor active people, a better recommendation would be \u201c1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram\u201d of body weight each day, Phillips said, or higher, \u201cup to a level of 1.6 grams per kilogram\u201d of body weight daily if you\u2019re physically active. In simple terms, if you weigh 160 pounds, or 72.5 kilograms, then 1 gram per kilogram of your weight is 72.5 grams of daily protein, which you could get by eating, over the course of your day, a 6-ounce steak (about 42 grams), a cup of Greek yogurt (about 17 grams) and a half-cup of tofu (about 20 grams).\n\nSome researchers advocate for more, though, especially for athletes in the middle of heavy training, when their muscles are under constant strain. For them, the \u201coptimal\u201d amount of protein may be as high as 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight every day or approximately a gram of protein for every pound of body weight, said Shawn Arent, the chairman of the department of exercise science at the University of South Carolina and a longtime sports nutrition researcher.  \n\n\n**You don\u2019t need that whey shake.**  \n\n\nStill concerned about getting enough protein? Supplements, like shakes and bars \u201care convenient,\u201d Phillips said. But so is a hard-boiled egg, which contains about 6 grams of protein, or a chicken breast. \u201cI eat a lot of Greek yogurt and chicken,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence that certain proteins are more nutritious than others, although some people swear by whey powder. Derived from milk, whey is a good source of leucine, an amino acid that helps jump-start muscle building. \u201cBut so is Greek-style yogurt,\u201d Phillips said, or salmon, which is packed with leucine.\n\n\u201cWhey protein has falsely been put on a pedestal as superior due to aggressive sports marketing campaigns,\u201d Burd said.\n\nMost people, including athletes, can get sufficient protein without needing powdered whey, even if they don\u2019t eat meat.\n\n\u201cVegetarian and vegan athletes can easily meet protein needs on a plant-based diet,\u201d said Enette Larson-Meyer, the director of the Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism Laboratory at Virginia Tech and co-author of Plant-Based Sports Nutrition.\n\nPlant proteins may not be complete, she said, meaning they don\u2019t contain all the amino acids we need, but \u201cconsuming a combination of different plant-based protein sources, such as beans and grain, will provide a balanced protein profile.\u201d If your diet is plant forward, but not fully vegetarian, add an egg or some cheese to improve a mostly vegetarian dish\u2019s \u201camino-acid profile,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/13rosie/what_to_know_about_protein/", "created_utc": 1685038021.0, "score": 8, "author": "AvivaLoeb", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/13rosie/what_to_know_about_protein/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

He would essentially live off meat, pasta, and potatoes, corn and other non healthy foods if he could. It's even hard for him to eat salads without a bunch of dressing because he doesn't like the taste of lettuce. We both don't like sea food. He can do shrimp and tuna. I can do tilapia tuna and maybe salmon pattys but thats it. He's asking me for help with our food habits but I feel at such a loss with knowing how to help him. He also detests mushrooms and doesn't like avocado. Doesn't like garlic. He also is not a breakfast food fan and doesnt like eggs. He's done keto before and although he did lose weight on it, he gained it all back and doesn't actually believe its a good diet/lifestyle for you and isnt interested in doing it again. I want him to be able to enjoy foods he eats but there's just so much he doesn't enjoy and eating potatoes and corn just isn't great every single day. Especially since he gets tired of the same things and need variety.

Preserving food by drying it in the sun or natural dry air is practiced since prehistoric times. This process, these days, is replaced by *Electric* *Dehydrators.* The following four easy steps will help you to produce the best-dehydrated food at home with the help of dehydrators.\n\n1. **Preparation:** Choose the season\u2019s best, high quality and ripe food to dehydrate and rinse properly. Cut evenly sized thin slices of food. For food that can not be sliced like grapes, it is recommended to choose a uniform size of grains. \n2. **Pretreatment:** In the case of fruits, dip the slices in Food Grade Ascorbic Acid or Citrus juice made of lime or oranges.

I clearly have an emotional attachment to being woken up and  it makes zero difference that I am now arising from my deathly slumber as fresh as the prince of Bel-Air. Part of me cannot help but think that I would be even more zingy if I had sugar, even though logically I know that blood sugar fluctuations is what caused the problem in the first place. But if I say yes to sugar in just the morning, I will be keeping the door just the tiniest bit propped open to future re-addiction. If it's never an option, no matter what the circumstances,I will be less likely to start consuming it on a regular basis again.\n\nBut saying that I must admit to having a late afternoon can of coke yesterday, it was so intensely sweet I could barely drink it. It's a shame really because I was so good at lunch and just had some water. I was truly exhausted after an entire day walking around the mall with three kids after just 4 hours sleep. Tiredness is definitely my danger zone.\n\nI have already lost 5 pounds in weight, I cannot find my tape measure to check if I've lost any inches. Ideally I want to lose 12 more pounds and a couple more inches, then I'll be happy with my weight.

{"title": "On Day Two of Quitting Sugar", "selftext": "I couldn't find any detailed sugar diaries out there, and am in need of reading something like this, so I thought I would share my experience.\n\nLast night I slept for 11.5 hours. Luckily I am just working part time at the moment while I start my own business on the side, because I was completely shocked when I looked at the time this morning. I had been expecting to wake up early after going to bed at 8pm. I have absolutely no idea scientifically why this is, so any explanations will be welcomed. I didn't do any physical activity yesterday, except from to walk to the shop and back which is 15 minutes. The only thing that was different was no sugar. Towards the end of the day I got a gripping headache, and extremely strong cravings for the sweet stuff. I had been drinking around ten sugary coffees a day, and at least 500mls of coca-cola, sometimes as much as 2 litres.\n\nThis morning my headache is actually gone, which surprised me. I feel a bit spacey from oversleeping, but not as bad as I usually do if I have slept for over 11 hours. The cotton wool feeling that I have noticed in my brain for the past month  has lifted, and I feel like I can think, it's almost a sense of hyper alertness, my legs are bouncing up and down fast and mentally I feel pumped with energy; almost dizzy with it, like my brain is buzzing fast with the feeling, but conversely my body feels extra heavy and sluggish.\n\nI don't know how I will make it through the day without my dose, the worst thing right now is the mental cravings. It's for sweetened coffee and fresh white bread, and strangely also gummy bears, which I never eat, I've had them about twice in my life. It would be so easy to just go to the store and get some now. I'm already bargaining with myself about eating some sugar tomorrow if I don't feel okay by then, as I have work. I am worried that I will be exhausted tomorrow if I cannot sleep tonight. And sugar will fix it, at least temporarily. But nobody will be happier than my boss if I quit the sweet stuff, she will be okay with me potentially being exhausted as it's for the greater good. She is very healthy, and concerned that I am living on a sugar roller-coaster, as anyone would be if somebody brought in huge bottles of coca-cola to work every day and drunk it all up. I can see from the outside that I am making up excuses, and justifying and rationalizing potential future sugar use. I need to focus on the reasons why I can't, what the benefit will be to me if I do not quit quitting...\n\nI have an exam next month and I want to do my best, this is the reason I need to do this. I am going to use visualisation (aka psycho-cybernetics and law of attraction) and focus on my goal, imagining myself putting down my pen and being really pleased with how I have performed, then opening up the results that will come through the post a couple of weeks later, and being really pleased that I realized my full potential. I feel the grin spreading over my face at the thought of it now. I know I just need to get through the next five days, and then I will regain equilibrium, and find my new, more alert normal with steady energy throughout the day rather than it diving and rocketing. I should also use the number on the scales as motivation, I am almost obese, and it will be great to get down to a healthy weight again, with 40 inch hips rather than the 43 they currently are. I will imagine myself in the Topshop changing rooms, in a really cool outfit that I have chosen purely because I like it, not because it's the only okay choice that flatters my stomach. Even though I am not quitting sugar for this reason, it will still be nice to have this side effect of a better figure.\n\nAnd right now I have the urge to go running, which I didn't anticipate, as I haven't wanted to run in years, in fact nothing fills me with dread like the thought of puffing my way down the streets. This has the potential to further benefit my health and appearance. I think my deep need to run has been caused by both my restless legs, and my fast mind... I want my body to be as equally fast as my thoughts. The same way that music with a pounding beat makes you want to dance faster. It's quite hard to put into words. I have no trainers at the moment, so I doubt I will actually go out and do it, but I could do some labor intensive housework. However I feel like I need to break through the barrier of my slow and sluggish body to actually do this.\n\nEDIT----Wow, the headache hit me at 5:30, I feel very fogged up and terrible again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/dl1agr/on_day_two_of_quitting_sugar/", "created_utc": 1571667854.0, "score": 8, "author": "__Hmm_", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/dl1agr/on_day_two_of_quitting_sugar/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How to Eat Healthy When Your Partner Does Not", "selftext": "Before I started dating my partner, I was committed to healthy eating. I ate a plant based, exercised often, and prepared meals using the \u201cbatch\u201d cooking method. In the beginning of our relationship, my partner and I ate out often and our dinner dates included multiple courses, dessert, and wine pairings (so hard to resist) and I quickly found myself retreating to my old, unhealthy eating habits. And, because my partner has a sweet tooth and poor eating habits, when we started dating, I found myself slowly falling in love with chocolate and gummy bears and chips and french fries again. I fell off the proverbial wagon of healthy eating and found I had completely abandoned my wellness goals. Too often I hear people blame their inability to stick to a healthy lifestyle on their partners. Sure, committing to a healthy lifestyle is challenging when your partner has poor eating habits, but you alone are responsible for your healthy lifestyle. So, what are the best ways to eat healthy when your partner does not? Read below for tips to help you stay focused.\n\nTip #1 Set Goals\n\nNot only will setting clear health and nutrition goals help you stay focused, it will also help you communicate your goals and healthy lifestyle choices to your partner. Tell your partner exactly what your goals are and why you are setting them. Maybe you want to lose 10 pounds so you can fit into that dress you wore in college or maybe you just want to have more energy. Whatever the reason, share with your partner the importance of maintaining a healthily lifestyle and challenge them to join you. But, there\u2019s a chance your partner will be reluctant to share in your healthy lifestyle journey. \n\nTip #2 Lunch Time it is the Right Time\n\nIf you find it too hard to eat well at home, try incorporating healthy eating habits slowly by starting with lunch. Eating a healthy lunch is the easiest way to transition into a healthy lifestyle. Think about it \u2013 during the week, lunch is when you are least likely to eat with your partner. Use lunch as an opportunity to develop healthy, balanced eating habits. Start by planning all your meals for the week and \u201cbatch\u201d cook your lunches for the week. \n\nTip #3 Snacks on snacks on snacks on snacks\n\nMy philosophy on snacking is simple \u2013 do it! Snacking is the best way to stay on track with healthy eating. One of the biggest reasons people struggle with eating healthy is because they often feel hungry throughout the day and resort to eating whatever is readily available, including junk food. To avoid the hunger pitfall, always carry fruit or nuts to help stave off hunger. Listen, you don\u2019t want to be hungry when your coworker walks in the office with a donut. Having a healthy snack on hand will help you resist temptation and stick to your goals.  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/75p8ti/how_to_eat_healthy_when_your_partner_does_not/", "created_utc": 1507730535.0, "score": 9, "author": "zero2healthy", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/75p8ti/how_to_eat_healthy_when_your_partner_does_not/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019m pretty physically active so I need to eat a lot to feel satisfied but there aren\u2019t so many options.

Keep your skin looking vibrant and clear by generously tossing sweet and tart berries on top of your yogurt or morning cereal.\n\n**Tomatoes** are rich in the antioxidant Lycopene, a carotenoid pigment that gives them their rosy red color. Studies have shown that a diet rich in lycopene can help protect the skin by as much as 33 percent - reason enough to plop a big juicy tomato slice or two on your next burger or sandwich!\n\n**Kale** is a hot super food rich in Vitamin A, Vitamin C and calcium. Kale\u2019s high content of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, makes it an especially good food for fighting premature aging due to UV damage. Plus, there are 45 different flavonoids in kale, all of which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.  A great way to enjoy kale: DIY kale chips baked with a bit of oil and freshly ground pepper.  \n\n**Artichokes** are delicious all kinds of ways - steamed and saut\u00e9ed, eaten whole, chopped into salads, blended as a dip, and more. Artichokes contain several antioxidants including quercetin, anthocyanin and silymarin, which have been shown to help reduce the proliferation of cancer cells.

{"title": "I'm overweight and strength training - how to eat to build muscle instead of store fat?", "selftext": "Hi everyone! So, quick background: I (28F) used to be quite physically fit with little active effort. But a long illness, poor eating habits, and meds to manage said illness have caused me to gain a TON of weight and lose most of the muscle in my hips, back, and arms. (I'm 5'3 and about 230 pounds at the moment.)\n\nMy doctor is not concerned with active weight loss right now -- she and my physical therapist both want me to focus on building up muscle before anything else. (If she thinks weight loss will be best for my health later, I will 100% follow whatever recommendations she has then.)\n\nI've been doing PT for a few months and have gained back an enormous amount of strength compared to where I was before. I'm nowhere NEAR able-bodied yet, but I'm getting there -- no more need to wear braces on my legs or lie down suddenly in public places!! :D\n\nI exercise for 1 to 2 hours per day, excluding occasional illness flares. Half of the exercise is strength training through my PT exercises, the other half is walking around my neighborhood for cardio/endurance purposes.\n\nMy two main problems are these:\n\n1) I am DESPERATELY hungry literally all the time, which I know is sort of expected when you're strength training, but does stress both me and my household budget. What kind of protein & carb content should I be aiming for to help with hunger?\n\n2) I grew up food insecure with parents who didn't cook -- I am learning to cook now, but very very very slowly, as I don't find it super intuitive yet. (My parents considered a family-sized bag of Doritos to be a nutritionally complete meal.) All this is to say: what ingredients would you recommend I keep on hand, and what simple meals should I learn to make to help with all this? I'd like to make a list of priorities.\n\nMany thanks for any and all help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1da4av4/im_overweight_and_strength_training_how_to_eat_to/", "created_utc": 1717742724.0, "score": 5, "author": "pleaseletmesleepz", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1da4av4/im_overweight_and_strength_training_how_to_eat_to/", "html_title": ""}

After the surgery i wasn't allowed to eat at all for a few hours, and later was encouraged to try eating some yogurt. I did but it really hurt so i ended up only eating very little. \nside note I'm very used to pain and assumed no amount of medication would get rid of it completely until i heeled, just got home, took my normal dosage of pain killers for when i get headaches (the high but safe option on the pack, it says one or two and i always take two because one isn't enough) turns out i was wrong and you can be mostly pain free after surgery if you just take the right amount of pain meds for your pain. Anyways I'm mentioning this because evidently i ate very little even when i was allowed to eat because it really hurt to swallow.\nAnyway, two days after the surgery i had a bleed and was no longer allowed to eat or drink for two days, and when i started, once again i ate very very little and drank very little too. \nBasically I've had two days where i ate probably twenty grams of food overall, two days of fasting with IV, and two days where i ate maybe 200-300 grams of food. \nI got home today and took my pain medication, as mentioned the amount i usually take, and it didn't hurt to swallow, at least not to much. I stuck to what the doctor said and only ate soft, mushed food in room temperature or colder, but i ate much much more that i did the previous six day. Still not close to the normal amount i eat usually or anyone does. (I ate a single pack of ramen noodles that i turned into mush and a piece of bread that i chewed thoroughly). \nMy stomach has been gurgling for the past week non stop, so i thought that being able to eat more would help, but i guess i over did it because i got really bad acid reflux and a bit came up. So obviously i need to slow down about making my diet normal again, but at the same time im still super hungry.\nIf i dont eat my stomach hurts, and if i do it does too. I dont know what to do. Any tips on how to slowly get used to eating normal amounts of food without starving in the meantime? \n\nTLDR: couldn't eat for a week, now can, ate a small amount but it was still to much for my stomach to handle after basically fasting for a week, so i cant eat more, but im still super hungry and my stomach hurts, looking for advice or tips.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/wfhxqc/recovering_from_tonsillectomy_and_havent_eaten_in/", "created_utc": 1659560469.0, "score": 6, "author": "gayfucker666", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/wfhxqc/recovering_from_tonsillectomy_and_havent_eaten_in/", "html_title": ""}

So it is really \"easy\" to gain weight with.\n\n- It is healthy\n\n- It is inexpensive (the one I got was about $14 for a massive bottle of EDIT: 136 servings)\n\n- If is shelf stable (it is not perishable and incredibly temperature resistant. It does not need to be refrigerated, simply keep it in a dry dark place. It also lasts for about 2 years.)\n\n- You can find it pretty much anywhere.\n\n**Here's the useful information I've learned about oil, that might prove useful if you want to try this for yourself:**\n\n- Not all oils are equally healthy. Olive oil and Avocado oil are two of the healthiest oils. Do NOT start adding copious amounts of regular vegetable oil, sunflower oil, etc. to your meals - these are high in saturated fats and unhealthy for you. Olive and avocado oil are healthy options.\n\n- Extra virgin olive oil is healthier than regular olive oil as it is less processed.\n\n- If you try this method, **get an olive oil that is light in flavor**. This is really important! Regular olive oil could be very strong in flavor and difficult to stomach if you are not used to it. Lighter tasting one will be easier.\n\n- **START SLOWLY.** Do you not add spoons and spoons of olive oil to your food, without having done it before. Start slowly and make sure you tolerate it. The first day - I added only1 tsp to my oatmeal, and I found it a little difficult to stomach because I was not used to it. However, I kept with it, and after 2 days, I completely adapted and stopped noticing it at all. Now, I add 2 tbsp to each oatmeal and I do not notice it. I could add more even, but I am trying to save money.\n\n- Avocado oil is naturally lighter in taste than olive oil, so it is probably an even better option, but it is much more expensive. (that's why I'm personally using olive oil.)\n\n- Apparently the olive oil industry is rampant with corruption? So maybe make sure you are actually getting a decent olive oil.\n\nCurrently, I make two meals of plain oatmeal daily. In each one I add cinnamon, natural peanut butter (100% peanuts, no salt and no sugar added), and 2 tbsp of oil. Finally I am gaining weight. (I also drink ensure.)\n\nAs with anything, everyone is different. Please read a little bit about oil before you try this, to make sure it won't be a problem for you.\n\n**I hope this helps someone as much as it has helped me.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/por09o/an_easy_idea_for_gaining_weight_healthily/", "created_utc": 1631715460.0, "score": 5, "author": "borj5960", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/por09o/an_easy_idea_for_gaining_weight_healthily/", "html_title": ""}

Just some backgrounds to understand my questions a bit more clearly. I am 29, quite tall (190/6'3) a bit above of average in weight (100-105kg)compared my height, have some muscle and physically kind of active, as walk a lot and train weekly 3-4 times. When I was 18 I was pretty fat, I came down from 165(kgs) to 90(kgs) and since then my blood sugar, cholesteryn and a lot of my similar stats have changed in the good way. \n\n\r  \nLately I have just noticed my energy level (especially on the morning) is pretty low, even though use to sleep good. And btw, never smoked, since I dont like alcohol I dont drink at all (except cola), and (that is probably the weirdest) I do not drink coffee at all. But here is my questions. \n\n\r  \n1, What does actually mean to eat healthy? - I tried to look up on the internet but site by site recommended different food with some mutuals (like Kale, Quinoa, fish). I grew up on near to the Balkan and people said and believed like vegetables, fruits and meat as healthy. But for example a lot of sites on the internet don't even recommend red meat, while some body builder influencers only eat red meat to get healthy(carnivore diet for example). So for these reasons I am a bit confused. I started to eat Apple and orange every breakfast, instead of sandwiches and bacon. And try to eat more fish and lean meat with steamed vegetables instead of rice.\n\n\r  \n2, Why some sites only recommend water as the only one drink I can pote? - This is my worst habit, I barely find the water potable. If i drink it, it is some mineral water (but as far as I know European companies they probably sell tap water with label). My favorite drink is a type of cola, that contains absolute zero sugar, but for exchange it has ASPARTAME in it. I have the same problem as I have in the previous question. Some sites says it is worse than sugar, some says it is good for a certain daily limit. \n\n\r  \n3, What does absolutely recommended to cut out/avoid from my diet? - For example for years I ate sandwiches for breakfast, and nowadays when I started to read healthy eating articles and white bread is not recommended at all. \n\n\r  \nThank you for your help in advance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1c4i04n/where_can_i_start_eating_healthychanging_lifestyle/", "created_utc": 1713173549.0, "score": 5, "author": "HetvenOt", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1c4i04n/where_can_i_start_eating_healthychanging_lifestyle/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

With a little bit of time and patience, you can dish up delicious and exciting meals that will keep your heart and your taste buds happy!\n\nAlso, of particular importance, is the way in which the food is cooked. Methods like steaming, pressure-cooking, and stir-frying are very good techniques of cooking food, since they involve the use of little or no fat. Boiling vegetables and lean meat preserves the texture, color, and the flavor exceedingly well, and does not utilize any fat at all. Avoid boiling for long periods of time though. Likewise, pressure-cooking reduces the cooking time, and thus prevents the loss of valuable nutrients. Stir-frying utilizes very little medium. Opting for olive oil as the cooking medium, is prudent and significantly beneficial.\n\nIf you choose the right ingredients and the optimum method of cooking, you could enjoy an array of dishes, without feeling guilty or inflicting harm on yourself. So, go ahead, indulge yourself in some wholesome, low cal cooking.

{"title": "Day Four of Quitting Sugar", "selftext": "I feel AMAZING, my mind is so clear and sharp that I am afraid I might cut myself on it. Feeling functional has been a distant memory; although tbf everything seems to be a distant memory to me, due to my forgetfulness (which will hopefully improve now). I have always taken my hyper-focus somewhat for granted throughout my life, the only thing that historically interfered with it (barring the past month)  was severe emotional stress. A certain amount of stress makes me feel alive and banishes the apathy away... But if trauma was introduced into the mix everything fell apart. But the borderline suicidal way I have been feeling recently is different to the other times of depression in my life because no particular event has affected me emotionally. I didn't understand it and recently booked myself some psychotherapy. But today it has gone. I feel absolutely amazing beyond anything I could have expected! The purpose of mentioning my mental health is to investigate a possible link between sugar consumption and feelings of depression, has anyone else experienced this knock-on effect when their diet improves?\n\nPreviously I have only felt this diet-induced alertness when I've been in Ketosis. However I doubt I am in this state as I ate 3/4 of a loaf of bread last night.  But some of the effects are the same, most notably my lack of hunger; I haven't eaten today and its 6pm. Sometimes I forget to eat on busy days, but around 4pm I become ravenous.. So my lack of appetite now is almost disturbing. I have smoked ten cigarettes and had about 6 cups of sugar-free coffee, maybe the appetite suppressant properties of both is coming into full force without the sugar roller-coaster to counteract their effects?\n\nAnother great thing about today is that my skin looks incredible. My skin has always been good, but right now I am actually glowing. My face looks a lot pinker, and I am radiating health. My eyes are glittering with life. The look suits me, and I am sure that tomorrow it will be commented on.\n\nRight now I am just kicking myself for procrastinating my decision to cut out sugar. Will update every now and then with details of how I'm getting along.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/dm2elm/day_four_of_quitting_sugar/", "created_utc": 1571850918.0, "score": 3, "author": "__Hmm_", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/dm2elm/day_four_of_quitting_sugar/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Day Three of Quitting Sugar", "selftext": "I woke up in the morning not feeling too bad, all things considered. I thought that if I'd known it would be this easy, I would have done it ages ago. The thought that I really must give up sugar has been semi-dormant in my mind for well over a year. I've always recoiled from the idea though, like any proper addict would.\n\nWhen I did my morning wee I was shocked at how dehydrated I was, but it shouldn't have been surprising because I don't like the taste of any drinks that are sugar-free. I really didn't drink much at all on day 2 because of this. I did, however, resolve to hydrate myself adequately today, and bought a big bottle of Coke Zero. I also had a healthy lunch of salmon and a green salad. I found myself having to force myself to reach for the Cola 'substitute' and make myself drink it, rather than naturally being drawn to drinking it. I had huge great big fuck-off cravings for 'The Real Thing'.\n\nI kind of failed slightly in the evening. I must quickly mention that before I ate my headache had returned, it seems to be a pattern that I will get them only in the evening, which suits me. There's an app for 75% off food that is left at restaurants and bakeries at the end of the day. I work in and around a posh area with lots of incredible food places, so I gave it a go. I got a loaf artisan bread, an individual lemon meringue pie and a big tub of a roasted butternut squash salad. The carbs from the bread turn to sugar in your body, the pie is obviously very sweet, and the 'salad' tasted like parsnips, very sweet and salty. I wondered if I had eaten the same salad last week whether it would have tasted quite so sweet to me. There was a time where nothing tasted salty, as I ate so much salt (I cut out added salts a month or two ago; please forgive my awful memory). So in a way it was nice that my taste buds already seem to have readjusted to sugar. I do not usually eat like a pig but I found myself wolfing down this high sugar content meal. I feel guilty. I like feeling food guilt, I only ever feel it when I am eating super-well. My diet isn't too bad in general though, I get enough fruit and veg, I eat quality home-made food, and no dairy except from the odd bit of cheese and butter. I enjoy healthy food, but I also enjoy unhealthy stuff alongside it too.\n\nI didn't notice until the end of the day that the huge feeling of overwhelm that has become pretty much standard with me was no longer present, which is great. I am (have been?) putting a hideous amount of pressure on myself, and was advised by my lovely life coach to just give myself permission to do nothing... Because when I am 'relaxing' I feel so guilty. A rest was enforced by emergency surgery, but even throughout my pain and recovery there was still a low-level constant overwhelm that I am behind on \\*everything\\*, that there is SO MUCH that I need to do, the thoughts were almost paralyzing, and although I have been trying to give myself some time off, it was still there. But yesterday  the feeling disappeared, which is fantastic. I'm surprised that I didn't notice that it was gone at the time. Another added bonus is that my productivity shot through the roof, which make sense as the overwhelm makes me feel so stuck.\n\nMy restless legs from day two calmed down on the night of day three, this could possibly be due to the meal I ate, but maybe because my body is adapting to less sugar. I found it quite odd when somebody mentioned that their Aunt gets restless legs when they eat too much sugar or has alcohol. So why is it that when I am doing the opposite of what the Aunt was doing am I having the same symptoms?

{"title": "To Whole30 or not to Whole30, that is the question", "selftext": "Hi all, sorry about the novel:\nI'm a 22 y/o female, relatively healthy (in terms of both weight and diet), but have been dealing with on and off GI issues over the past year. Stomach sensitivity, occassional bloating, cramping, and heartburn - which almost feels like gas pains since it travels to my stomach. This was very confusing to me and I don't even remember the onset of it, since I have always had a \"stomach of steel\" - could put siracha on anything, have spicy food, citrus, 3 cups of coffee/day, and feel fine! After blood tests came back normal, my doctor chalked it up to anxiety-induced gastritis. I have a history of extreme anxiety, so this made sense. I took pepcid when I really needed it, but other than that, tried to stray away from medication.\nThe symptoms went away for several months, but have recently resurfaced. Definitely milder than last year, but noticeably there. I rarely eat acidic foods and am down to 1 cup of coffee/day diluted with almond milk. My diet consists of little to no dairy (besides greek yogurt), little red meat, and is rich in fruits, veggies, whole grains, and beans/chickpeas. I rarely crave sweets as it is, and am not big into refined carbs. As for alcohol, I drink 2-3 small glasses of wine per week, no liquor.\nI visited a new physician about my GI issues since I just moved to a new area, and this physician recommended a Whole30 diet. I'm very wary about this - it's tough to do, especially because I'm starting a consulting job and will be on the road most weeks. I also get hypoglycemic, and while I'll have a slow-digesting carb and protein, am afraid I won't do well with fruit/starchy vegetables as my only carb source. I also feel as if the probiotic qualities of Greek yogurt could be especially helpful.\nDo you think Whole30 is necessary, or that a modified version/some other sort of diet plan could work for me? I love my oatmeal, brown rice, chickpea pasta and quinoa, and am sick of sweet potatoes since I used to eat them so much (I had a history of restrictive eating). I made some coconut flour pancakes this morning and had a tough time choking them down.\nI was thinking of a modified Whole30, where I would be 80% Whole30 compliant, and make one meal a day Compliant + 1 (add a beloved brown rice in a smaller amount than usual, for example), or have my Greek yogurt in the morning.\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/6wr91f/to_whole30_or_not_to_whole30_that_is_the_question/", "created_utc": 1504013718.0, "score": 4, "author": "RR0203", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/6wr91f/to_whole30_or_not_to_whole30_that_is_the_question/", "html_title": ""}

I've been enjoying eating oatcakes recently, but the Sainsbury's brand has sugar and wheat flour listed as ingredients, which just seems a little unnecessary.

Why have I been buying expensive crackers all these many years?

Once it's pretty thoroughly mixed and crumbly, add about 1/8th of a cup of water, and mix- this part's fine with a spoon- until it holds together easily, but isn't too wet.\n\nRoll this out onto a piece of parchment paper and score.  If you really want you can try to make shapes etc., but it is a little fragile and I couldn't be bothered.  Once the oven's ready, put the parchment paper on the baking tray and bake for about 10-15 minutes or until slightly browned around the edges.\n\nI think I may try adding some herbs etc. next time and upping the goat's cheese content, as its taste was very very subtle, but it still added a certain something.

I gym 2-3 times a week, run around with my 11 month baby, and i also have a relatively healthy diet. (Especially if i compare it to what I've been eating) i used to eat so much chocolate in a day, soda drinks every other day, white rice, fatty foods like burgers, etc. Now I very rarely eat chocolates, no soda drinks for over a year, switched to quinoa and bulgur instead of white rice, etc. I used to hear people around me say 'once you hit 30, you'll have random areas in your body hurting' Similarly, I have been hearing a lot about how our food is artificial and has additives and preservatives. Our grandparents were so strong physically, even if they were not in good financial conditions or if they were 'struggling' with no time to exercise or so. And it's probably because the god they ate was natural and fresh. Butter, milk, vegetables. Now, whenever I'm eating healthy things, I keep wondering if it's even natural or real. Our vegetables come in plastic wraps in stores, every product you buy has some sort of agents in them, is the milk in milk cartons even real? Why are some fruits unusually big? Why are chickens bigger? Are they adding growth hormones? I live in Scandinavia and I thought things were healthy here, but now I'm not sure.\n\nAnd then every other day, I have some pains, sometimes leg, sometimes hands, etc. I've had health anxiety as well the past 2 years, so i kind of dont know if it's because of that or because I'm actually weaker now.\n\nBut I fear about the foods we eat. Sometimes in a hurry if we're going out somewhere, i get storebought baby food for my baby and i feel so guilty about it because i feel like there are additives in it as well.\n\nI keep worrying what the future will be like health wise.

Essentially if it isn\u2019t the above good oils, don\u2019t get it.\n      * Again, read all ingredients of all packages, since the above bad oils sneak into many products, especially nuts.\n      * Nearly every dressing on earth has some of the above bad oils in it, read the label before you buy.\n      * Margarine - this is basically made up of the above bad oils\n   * **Vegetables and fruits**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Could you go to a farm and find it in the state you are buying it? If so, then it is good. Prechopped veggies/fruits are fine as well.\n      * Some easy ones for my wife and I are spinach, cucumber, celery, cherry tomatoes, onions, sweet potatoes, normal potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, squash, cauliflower, broccoli.\n      * For fruits, apples, oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, blueberries, bananas are all good.\n      * Frozen Veggies are OK, if you read the ingredients and ensure that there are NO foreign chemicals added to preserve food.\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Canned Veggies, veggies with random chemicals added.\n      * Canned Fruits, dehydrated fruits (these should only be used as a \u201ctreat\u201d since they are super sugary but without as many nutrients),\n   * **Drinks**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Water. Get a water filter for your tap or get a water filter jug. You\u2019ll notice the difference in water taste. Purchase spring water from the store if you want bottled water, not purified water. Reverse Osmosis water is the best from what I've researched, consider it an investment into your health, and always drink from glass bottles, not plastic or metal, due to how metal and plastic \"leeches\" chemicals into the water.\n      * Milk - Research for yourself (maybe on DuckDuckGo or something not as heavily censored as Google) the risks and rewards of raw, unpasteurized milk\n      * Coffee - No added sugar allowed, only milk or cream (again, the cream must be milk based and not made up of hydrogenated oils). Use sparingly.\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Soda, fruit juices (orange/apple) this will cause you to drink excess calories and sugar.\n      * No diet sodas either, these have artificial sweeteners which are NOT food and cause harm to your body.\n      * Alcohol - From a health perspective, alcohol is not needed (if you are tanking up on veggies and fruits), and it often has a ton of added sugar and random other stuff, and it actually negatively affects your sleep quality when taken too close to bedtime, even if it initially makes you feel relaxed. Use at your discretion.\n   * **Complex Carbs**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Any Kind of potato, rice (read packages if you are going to get the microwavable kinds), oatmeal, quinoa, other grains, and beans. The beans can be canned, just ensure that there is no added sugar or random chemicals to them, AKA baked beans or refried beans.\n      * Sometimes bread, again read the label and see what is added to the bread. If it sweetened by honey or stevia, then its fine, but generally most bread has a lot of chemical additives and refined sugar added. Use sparingly.\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * White bread (including tortillas), most types of bread (due to above reasons), pasta (same reasons as bread).\n   * **Sweeteners**  \n\n      * **Approved**\n      * Honey, Stevia, agave, fruit based sweeteners\n      * **Disapproved**\n      * Refined sugar (brown or white), Splenda, any \u201cno calorie\u201d sweetener like aspartame or sucralose or other \u201cdiet\u201d sweeteners found in sodas.\n      * Sugar is added to nearly EVERY packaged good and frozen good (from pizza to bread to ice cream), so read the labels of what you buy if you want to buy something prepackaged instead of the raw ingredients above.\n   * **Seasonings**  \n\n      * Salt (it can be iodized), but I prefer the grinder salt.\n      * As for other seasonings, just ensure it doesn\u2019t have \u201cspices\u201d in the ingredients since that is probably MSG. Pretty much any spices are fair game then, read the label and ensure it doesn\u2019t have any man-made chemical in the name (polysorbate, glutamate, etc.), and you should be fine.\n* **Healthy Eating Lifestyle Tips and Tricks**  \n\n   * Eat meat with each meal, and throw in a veggie or a fruit as well. Meat increases feelings of fullness, as well as builds/preserves muscle mass. Try a fist full of meat and however many veggies or fruits you can fit on your plate. Veggies and fruits are God\u2019s vitamins!\n   * Meal prep lots of cooked meat, so you don't have to constantly be cooking throughout the week, I use Blue Diamond pans from Walmart to cook up large amounts of chicken thighs, ground beef, or fish, for the week.\n   * Fruit is often demonized since it contains sugar, however, it is quickly absorbed into the body and doesn\u2019t contribute to weight gain as much as complex carbs, see below for explanation.\n   * Calories are either going to come from complex carbs (rice/potatoes/oatmeal/bread) or from fats (like nuts or seeds or avocado).\n   * Fats are a good source of calorie, since they don\u2019t spike blood sugar and therefore won\u2019t lead to you holding onto excess body fat as easily. Try to eat fats at each meal or as a snack until you feel full. Try half a handful of seeds or nuts at first, to see how full you feel after.\n   * Complex carbs are best saved either before exercise, or at the last meal of the day. Complex carbs raise blood sugar and serotonin levels (which makes you feel happy and relaxed), both of which are good to have before exercise, or to have before bed, so that you go to bed with a happy mind. Excess carbs throughout the day will lead to the body to only burn carbs as fuel, and excess bodyweight will start to occur, since the body won\u2019t burn fat as fuel if it has carbs as an available source. Experiment with how **little** complex carbs you can eat before exercise or at the end of the day, to get the desired effect of a good workout or a happy sleep. More strenuous exercise is going to need more complex and simple carbs (oatmeal and honey, white rice and grapes, etc.) in order for your body to be primed to perform.\n   * Try to eat mostly 3 \u2013 4 meals a day, as opposed to constantly grazing. The body won\u2019t burn bodyfat if it is constantly having a full or half full stomach, since the blood sugar is continually spiking. This is why intermittent fasting is so effective, or why your stomach sometimes growls when you wake up as well as you look leaner, since your body is ready for food and is burning fat. Space out your meals, and try to combine snacks into the next meal, to give your stomach time to empty and your blood sugar to stabilize.\n   * Constantly drink water throughout day, add a pinch of salt here and there to ensure your body is actually absorbing water as opposed to it just flowing through you. You could attempt to drink \u00bd your bodyweight in ounces of water (i.e. a 200 lb man will drink 100 oz of water), but I find it more effective to just get a glass water bottle and drink from it every hour or so. Experiment and find an easy water-drinking-routine for yourself.\n   * **If you're trying to lose weight:**  \n\n      * Sleep is king in all things health, especially with losing weight, see my post on sleep here: [How to Get Good Sleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/11ijzho/my_sleep_protocol_wish_i_knew_how_to_sleep_earlier/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n      * Commit to a pain-free, sustainable, exercise routine, I recommend this: [https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/](https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/). Try it for at least a month.\n      * Focus on eating quality, organic delicious meals that you'll actually eat, from the above list. Search for FB groups of healthy recipes. Throw out any disapproved foods from the house, to make it harder to cheat.\n      * Start out with baby steps, like drinking water instead of soda, and cooking at home more.\n      * Really challenge yourself to get most of your calories from fat, if not entirely for a few weeks. You will drop pounds quickly with this method, but will eventually get carb cravings. Add in carbs as prescribed above (before training, at dinner), in moderation.\n* **Sample Eating Day** \\*\\*\\* I am extremely boring when it comes to what I eat, feel free to experiment and get creative with your healthy diet!\\*\\*\\*  \n\n   * **Breakfast**  \n\n      * Drink 16 oz of water, add a dash of salt to it.\n      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top\n      * 4 stick of organic celery\n      * \u00bd handful of almonds\n   * **Lunch**  \n\n      * 1.5 fists of organic ground turkey, Pace salsa on top\n      * 4 stick of organic celery\n      * \u00bd handful of almonds\n   * **Dinner**  \n\n      * Whatever wifey makes me \ud83d\ude0a\n   * **Preworkout**  \n\n      * 1 \u2013 1.5 cups of oatmeal, drizzle honey on it (this is if training is going to be strenuous, like all out sprints or heavy lifting)\n   * **Postworkout**  \n\n      * Honey (otherwise I will feel dizzy or weak or foggy after training)\n   * **Dessert**  \n\n      * If I have a craving, it usually is satisfied with an apple and some walnuts.\n* End Goal - To be happy, healthy, lean, strong, and be able to nurture and nourish and build up the amazing Body God has given us!\n* PS - This is about physical food, but God gives the true food - [The Gospel!](https://youtu.be/t1BWSOVNm4A)\n\n**Feel free to private message me with any questions or comments, as everyone has a different situation, and may need some guidance in taking the right next step.

{"title": "Understanding Nutritional Facts", "selftext": "Forgive me if this isn't the right place for such a topic, but I recently learned that food labels are often wrong. Especially in calorie content. Apparently a discrepancy of up to 20% one way or another is no big deal to the FDA.\n\nPlus the serving sizes are off half the time too, so if you think you're getting 100 calories from a 95g bagel but the one you actually eat is 107g, that's an extra 13 calories (if the 100 calories was even right to begin with) you weren't expecting.\n\nAnyway, I learned how to check the math (adding up the calories from protein, fat, and carbs) myself and have been doing so for things I eat regularly and found most things are off by only few calories more or less, but some are 10, 20, and even 30 calories off. My peanut butter was 15 calories off. My supposed 100 calorie English muffins were 130 calories. And my favorite dried beans which claimed to be 90 calories per serving were actually 125 calories. That's more than 20%.\n\nMost all my dry beans were off. It made me wonder if there's something in the way beans are cooked that changes how the calories are absorbed that might account for the difference. Or is it just companies lying to us to make things appear lower calorie again?\n\nI'm trying not to obsess but I really want to understand.

{"title": "We always talk about weight loss, but what really matters are lifestyles that can sustain a healthy weight for a lifetime. Research suggests consuming less of certain nutrients, independent of calories, may significantly help prevent obesity and weight regain.", "selftext": "Obviously losing weight is important, but what does it matter if you just end up regaining it and becoming unhealthy again? Sure you can count calories and get down to a healthy BMI, but once you've reached goal weight, it's not practical to constantly count calories and control your portions for the remainder of your life. It's a big part of why so many people who've lost weight just can't keep it off. However, Research suggests some nutrients have a higher tendency to store more bodyfat than others, even when calories are equated. The kinds of food that show the biggest tendency to store fat appear to be saturated fats, added fructose, trans fat, and food cooked in deep fried oils. Oils cooked at high temperature for long periods tend to increase their saturated fat and trans fat content. It's also a good idea to opt for unrefined carbohydrates.\n\nI will say that saturated fats on a ketogenic diet may not cause the same degree of body fat increase, due to keto's nature of metabolizing more fat than normal. The harm more so applies to saturated fats on diets that are also carb rich.\n\nHere's all the research I've gathered:\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561422002941](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561422002941)\n\n**Longitudinal association of dietary carbohydrate quality with visceral fat deposition and other adiposity indicators**\n\n>Results After controlling for potential confounding factors, a 3-point increment in CQI over 12-month follow-up was associated with a decrease in visceral fat (\u03b2 \u22120.067 z-score, 95% CI -0.088; \u22120.046, p < 0.001), android-to-gynoid fat ratio (\u22120.038, \u22120.059; \u22120.017, p < 0.001), and total fat (\u22120.064, \u22120.080; \u22120.047, p < 0.001). Fibre intake and the ratio of wholegrain/total grain showed the strongest inverse associations with all adiposity indicators.\n\n>Conclusions In this prospective cohort of older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS, we found that improvements in dietary carbohydrate quality over a year were associated with concurrent favorable changes in visceral and overall fat deposition. These associations were mostly driven by dietary fibre and the wholegrain/total grain ratio.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550191/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550191/)\n\n**Overfeeding polyunsaturated and saturated fat causes distinct effects on liver and visceral fat accumulation in humans**\n\n>Both groups gained similar weight. SFA (satyrated fatty acids) however, markedly increased liver fat compared with PUFAs (polyunsatured fatty acids);and caused a twofold larger increase in VAT (visceral fat) than PUFAs. Conversely, PUFAs caused a nearly threefold larger increase in lean tissue than SFAs. Increase in liver fat directly correlated with changes in plasma SFAs and inversely with PUFAs. Genes involved in regulating energy dissipation, insulin resistance, body composition, and fat-cell differentiation in SAT were differentially regulated between diets, and associated with increased PUFAs in SAT. In conclusion, overeating SFAs promotes hepatic and visceral fat storage, whereas excess energy from PUFAs may instead promote lean tissue in healthy humans.\n\n[https://iadns.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh3.12056](https://iadns.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh3.12056)\n\n**Deep-frying impact on food and oil chemical composition: Strategies to reduce oil absorption in the final product**\n\n>The authors observed an increase in SFA content (from 13.6% to 21.6%) mainly of lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), and arachidic (C20:0). At the same time, there was a decrease in unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid (OA; C18:1), linoleic acid (LA; C18:2 n\u20133) and ALA from 80.8% to 71.2% from the first to the sixth cycle. Moreover, the TFA content progressively increased (from 1.1% to 6.5%) (Sohu et al., 2020). These studies indicate that repetitive frying deteriorates the oil's fatty acid profile toward a higher content of SFA and TFA to the detriment of MUFA and PUFA (Cui et al., 2017; Flores et al., 2018; Sohu et al., 2020).\n\n[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2024.2341903](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2024.2341903)\n\n**Common questions and misconceptions about protein supplementation: what does the scientific evidence really show?**\n\n>A follow-up study compared two different dietary protein intakes (i.e. 2.3 vs. 3.4\u2009g/kg/d) in resistance-trained males and females who underwent a traditional bodybuilding training program \\[Citation64\\]. Both groups experienced a similar increase in lean body mass; however, the higher-protein group (3.4\u2009g/kg/d) experienced a greater reduction in fat mass. Furthermore, in an 8-week crossover study in resistance-trained males \\[Citation28\\], a high-protein group consumed significantly more protein (3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009g/kg/day) and calories than the control group (2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u2009g/kg/day), yet there was no change in fat mass. These studies dispute the notion that excess energy from protein alone promotes gains in fat mass; however, diets high in fats and/or carbohydrates and low in protein tend to promote greater increases in fat mass as well as body mass \\[Citation66\u201370\\].\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916523188642](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916523188642)\n\n**Fat and carbohydrate overfeeding in humans: different effects on energy storage**\n\n>Carbohydrate overfeeding produced progressive increases in carbohydrate oxidation and total energy expenditure resulting in 75-85% of excess energy being stored. Alternatively, fat overfeeding had minimal effects on fat oxidation and total energy expenditure, leading to storage of 90-95% of excess energy. Excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate, and the difference was greatest early in the overfeeding period.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318831064\\_Conversion\\_of\\_Sugar\\_to\\_Fat\\_Is\\_Hepatic\\_de\\_Novo\\_Lipogenesis\\_Leading\\_to\\_Metabolic\\_Syndrome\\_and\\_Associated\\_Chronic\\_Diseases](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318831064_Conversion_of_Sugar_to_Fat_Is_Hepatic_de_Novo_Lipogenesis_Leading_to_Metabolic_Syndrome_and_Associated_Chronic_Diseases)\n\n**Conversion of Sugar to Fat: Is Hepatic de Novo Lipogenesis Leading to Metabolic Syndrome and Associated Chronic Diseases?**\n\n>Likewise, in the fed state, de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is also determined by the type of simple sugar consumed. Fructose, but not glucose, increased hepatic DNL in 6 healthy lean parti-cipants (Figure 3). During 6 hours of fructose inges-tion, DNL increased 20-fold, and 25% of circulating VLDL-TG was derived from DNL. In contrast, when the study was repeated in the same participants using glucose levels, rates of DNL were unaffected, and only 1% to 2% of VLDL-TG was synthesized de novo.

{"title": "Thoughts/Feedback?", "selftext": "So I F(22) live on my own with my sister F(16). I work fulltime, plus a small part time job on the weekends, and she of course is in school. I've been trying to come up with ways to add more veggies in meals without it being a whole lot of extra work, and so far the favorite has been a tomato-based sauce. I make a big batch of it every now and then and can it (I store it in the fridge, as I'm still not fully confident in it not spoiling). Essentially, the recipe is:\n\n* A few pounds of tomatoes. I think last time I did about ten pounds? It was 25 of those small tomatoes. \n* Three bell peppers\n* A whole small bag of carrots\n* A handful of mushrooms\n* About a half cup of red wine\n* One onion\n* Whatever seasoning I have on hand. I put in a small bit of salt and pepper, too, but I don't add sugar \u2014 mostly because I forget most people add sugar, and it's not the first thing I think of going in the sauce\n*A small can of tomato paste\n* A couple cloves of garlic, if I remember (amazing how often I forget this one)\n\nAbout 4 tomatoes are set aside, the rest are pureed with most of the carrots and two of the bell peppers. While I prep the tomatoes (peeling and squeezing the seeds out), I'll have the onion cooking in a little  bit of the butter,  as well as the mushrooms,  the remaining bell pepper, and about three or four chopped up carrots. Generally, by the time I'm finished blending everything, the onions are transparent, so I'll add the tomato/carrot/bell pepper mix in there, as well as the wine and seasoning, chop up the remaining four tomatoes and throw it in there, then let it simmer for about 2 hours, add the tomato paste, let it cook for another 2 - 3 hours. \n\nWhen I make spaghetti, a pound of ground beef or turkey is used, along with a standard box of spaghetti noodles. The only issue I have so far is that the sauce isn't all that thick, so I've been testing it with corn startch with mixed  results.  Anyways, I felt it was a pretty decent way to get veggies in there. Is there anything I'm missing, here? I try to do a bit of research on these things, but I always feel like I'm missing something.

In the past I've had my (incredible and lovely, and financially well off) foster parents buy me protein powder and that's worked quite well for me, however I can't afford to buy it myself because it's like $60 for the smallest/cheapest ones in my local grocery stores.

My motto is that eating the things I like despite their nutrition is better than not eating at all.

The egg shells break so easily.  They are super thin.   I researched why, and it looks like it's because the chickens are malnourished, even though they are eating \"organic\".  They are eating organic grain etc.... rather than insects in the grass.\n2. The egg itself is watery to the point where it pours out of the egg shell fast.   With pasture raised, the clear part of the egg is so thick that I have to shake the egg shell to get it all out\n3.

Too much, you get heart issues, swelling, whole other tonne of health issues. \n\nThere are many different Types of electrolytes as well, salt, potassium, etc. \nI personally notice, tap water would never, & does not do it for me. I get headaches, stomach aches, go to the bathroom more often. But distilled does the same, tastes better, but not nessecarily better for me. Also in the meantime I found out I was allergic to fluoride, body aches, feeling ill, etc\n\nI always thought bottled water was stupid, you pay so much for ...water ..until I had some of a specific kind someone got, all my issues went away, well water also did the same if I was anywhere that had it. I would bottle that sht like it was the last drop. \n\nJust, regular non fluoride spring water.. spring water usually has some sort of electrolytes naturally, but each spring would have its different type, depending where it was from ..some do better with me, some don't but it was Amazing the difference.

{"title": "How to live a healthy life ", "selftext": "Hi, I am a 28 year old female. I would say I have an active lifestyle. I gym 2-3 times a week, run around with my 11 month baby, and i also have a relatively healthy diet. (Especially if i compare it to what I've been eating) i used to eat so much chocolate in a day, soda drinks every other day, white rice, fatty foods like burgers, etc. Now I very rarely eat chocolates, no soda drinks for over a year, switched to quinoa and bulgur instead of white rice, etc. I used to hear people around me say 'once you hit 30, you'll have random areas in your body hurting' Similarly, I have been hearing a lot about how our food is artificial and has additives and preservatives. Our grandparents were so strong physically, even if they were not in good financial conditions or if they were 'struggling' with no time to exercise or so. And it's probably because the god they ate was natural and fresh. Butter, milk, vegetables. Now, whenever I'm eating healthy things, I keep wondering if it's even natural or real. Our vegetables come in plastic wraps in stores, every product you buy has some sort of agents in them, is the milk in milk cartons even real? Why are some fruits unusually big? Why are chickens bigger? Are they adding growth hormones? I live in Scandinavia and I thought things were healthy here, but now I'm not sure.\n\nAnd then every other day, I have some pains, sometimes leg, sometimes hands, etc. I've had health anxiety as well the past 2 years, so i kind of dont know if it's because of that or because I'm actually weaker now.\n\nBut I fear about the foods we eat. Sometimes in a hurry if we're going out somewhere, i get storebought baby food for my baby and i feel so guilty about it because i feel like there are additives in it as well.\n\nI keep worrying what the future will be like health wise.

So our egg intake has pretty much quadrupled if not, more.\n\nDoing some reading on\u00a0Store Bought vs Farm Fresh eggs, I'm still not quite sure how high the cholesterol levels are in my neighbors eggs. Yes, they are treated more humanely than store bought chicken eggs (according to that document). And we get a mixture of different colors and sizes due to the different kinds of chickens he has. Redish brown, Blue, White, also sizes vary as well from tiny to larger ones. He's got these cute little chicklets I call them. They look like baby chickens but they're not. They lay the tiny eggs but those are SOOOOOO GOOOD!!! He's also got a few ducks as well and those suckers make some LARGE Eggs! We've had them all!\n\nSo, these birds roam the yard all day long so they get plenty of sunlight and they pick the bugs out of the ground and all that. They're very well taken care of and are definitely living a happy life. From what I read in that document, if they are living happy lives then they should produce healthy eggs. But I saw nothing about cholesterol in those eggs being any lower than store bought eggs which kind of worries me. We eat more eggs now than we ever did! I love to hard boil them and I'll have 4-8 of them all day as a snack a couple at a time.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm a bit concerned about how healthy these eggs are for the heart.

And we've had about 15 dozen eggs in that time. Now, I'm not the only one eating them obviously. My wife and daughter and son-in-law eat them as well. I'll have a couple scrambled every now and then for breakfast but the hard boiled are more of a quick snack.\n\nI'm posting this because I can't find any answers online about the cholesterol levels of farm fresh eggs.

{"title": "Soaking Oats. Who knew.", "selftext": "The anti-nutrient phytic acid in oats can reduce the absorption of minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium. Cooking or soaking oats can decrease phytic acid levels by about 40-50%. The extent to which phytic acid inhibits mineral absorption depends on the overall diet and mineral intake, but it can significantly reduce mineral absorption if consumed in large quantities without proper preparation. However, typical oat consumption is unlikely to cause nutrient deficiencies due to these anti-nutrients, especially when oats are prepared properly.\n\n\"Prepared properly\" in the context of oats generally means using methods that help reduce the levels of anti-nutrients like phytic acid, thereby enhancing nutrient absorption. Here are some common preparation techniques:\n\nSoaking: Soaking oats in water overnight can help break down phytic acid and make nutrients more bioavailable. Adding a small amount of an acidic medium like lemon juice or yogurt can further aid this process.\n\nFermentation: Allowing oats to ferment slightly by soaking them with a starter culture or yogurt can also reduce phytic acid content.\n\nCooking: Simply cooking oats can reduce some of the phytic acid, though soaking before cooking is often more effective.\n\n:)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1gmyli2/soaking_oats_who_knew/", "created_utc": 1731115178.0, "score": 2, "author": "FondantMoist3528", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1gmyli2/soaking_oats_who_knew/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Psyllium husk powder is amazing", "selftext": "I'm into taking supplements and vitamins. I take stuff like liposomal vitamin C, black seed oil, fish oil (Nordic Naturals brand), b-complex, NAC, Zinc carnosine and etc every day. I've wasted too much money on supplements that don't work and too much each month on the ones that do. I've also started eating a healthy salad each day as well. Romaine lettuce, broccoli sprouts, microgreens, feta cheese, berries, and sometimes a little bit of organic chicken if I am making that salad a meal. Oh and I use balsamic vinaigrette as my dressing as I read its the healthiest dressing you can use. I also added 1 tablespoon of black sesame seeds per day, I just dumb the tablespoon of them in my mouth and chew em up and swallow. They actually taste really good. So anyways. \n\n\nI just started taking psyllum husk powder (fiber) about 5 days ago and just after 2-3 days of taking 1 to 2 teaspoons daily I feel so much better. Just taking this extra fiber has given me better benefits then all those supplements above I mentioned combined. Its amazing that taking just some extra fiber has given me such great results, plus its cheap. My bowel movements are now way better. Ever sense I started every #2 I have is ghost #2, meaning when I wipe there is nothing on toilet paper. I have much more energy as well. I know its the psyllium husk powder doing this because that is the only thing I added to my supplement stack. Just saying sometimes the most effective supplement is the most simple one. In my case it was just extra fiber. \n\n\nHave any of you guys noticed these effects after taking psyllium husk powder daily?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1eb43a4/psyllium_husk_powder_is_amazing/", "created_utc": 1721834380.0, "score": 1, "author": "jt2424", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1eb43a4/psyllium_husk_powder_is_amazing/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Boosting Fiber Tips & Tricks", "selftext": "My husband and I are in our early 50's and recently been on a mission to up our fiber intake. While also trying to watch our sodium and saturated fat too.\n\nIt's been harder than I thought it'd be. I have learned a few tricks and thought I'd share.\n\nBeans are a powerhouse for amping fiber in a meal. I try to make a couple bean forward meals a week, but my husband gets burnt out on them quick. Last night, I added a bean puree to sauce that I served over veggies, potatoes, and chicken. I also found a recipe for adding bean puree to bread. Can't wait to try that.   \n  \nNuts and seeds added to sauces and salads can add a nice fiber boost.   \n  \nI've switched to making whole wheat croutons for soups and salads. Toasted oats or barley work as well. Also great for casserole toppings or in meatballs or patties instead of breadcrumbs. In some cases, oat bran (which is usually ground finer) can work and has more even fiber. \n\nFor the most part I just try to start any meal with a fiber-rich base. Potatoes. Whole wheat pasta. Farro. Etc ... We've started using high fiber tortillas for tacos and wraps. I'm working on making higher fiber breads for sandwiches and such. \n\nOf course, I'm trying to prioritize more veggies too. \n\nIn a pinch I will just sprinkle wheat germ, nutritional yeast, flax meal, chia seeds, or inulin powder (the ladder two being higher fiber sources) on anything overly lacking in fiber. \n\nAnyone else got any fiber tips and tricks to share?

So, quick background: I (28F) used to be quite physically fit with little active effort. But a long illness, poor eating habits, and meds to manage said illness have caused me to gain a TON of weight and lose most of the muscle in my hips, back, and arms. (I'm 5'3 and about 230 pounds at the moment.)\n\nMy doctor is not concerned with active weight loss right now -- she and my physical therapist both want me to focus on building up muscle before anything else. (If she thinks weight loss will be best for my health later, I will 100% follow whatever recommendations she has then.)\n\nI've been doing PT for a few months and have gained back an enormous amount of strength compared to where I was before. I'm nowhere NEAR able-bodied yet, but I'm getting there -- no more need to wear braces on my legs or lie down suddenly in public places!! :D\n\nI exercise for 1 to 2 hours per day, excluding occasional illness flares. Half of the exercise is strength training through my PT exercises, the other half is walking around my neighborhood for cardio/endurance purposes.\n\nMy two main problems are these:\n\n1) I am DESPERATELY hungry literally all the time, which I know is sort of expected when you're strength training, but does stress both me and my household budget. What kind of protein & carb content should I be aiming for to help with hunger?\n\n2) I grew up food insecure with parents who didn't cook -- I am learning to cook now, but very very very slowly, as I don't find it super intuitive yet.

{"title": "Making chipotle chicken bowls at home was\u2026exhausting.", "selftext": "I started at 5:30 PM by adding one cup of rice to my rice cooker with 1 1/4 cups of water and rice vinegar.  \n\nMy GF came over at 6:30 with all of the ingredients from the store.  Everything we needed ran about $40.  This didn\u2019t include the rice, tomatoes, or seasonings that I had at home.\n\nThe chicken took the longest to cook.  I split three breasts into six strips, seasoned with garlic powder, and cooked them in two cast iron pans on the stove.  Once they were finished, I diced them into cubes, dumped them back into the pans, and simmered them in water with taco seasoning until the water was gone.  After the water was done boiling off, I scooped all of the chicken into a meal prep container.  This took a while.  I hate cooking chicken, especially when there is an extra step involved with the taco seasoning.  \n\nWhile the chicken was cooking, I diced two tomatoes.  I decided against making pico de gallo since there are just so many more ingredients involved in making it correctly.  I also diced an onion and an avocado to put on top.  It\u2019s annoying since I had to keep flipping the chicken while dicing everything.  \n\nI also grated some cheddar cheese, opened up a can of refried beans, and chopped up a head of Romain lettuce.  Once that was done, I took everything that was chopped and put them into bowls to serve.  Each bowl required its own serving spoon so not to cross contaminate.\n\nI used two meal prep containers to load the ingredients into.  Standard kitchen bowls are just too small.  I scooped in a layer of rice, chicken, beans, tomatoes, avocado, salsa, sour cream, onions, lettuce, and finished with a sprinkling of cheddar cheese.  \n\nBy the time we sat down to eat, I was honestly exhausted.  The bowls were good.  Not quite as good as Chipotle, for reasons I don\u2019t entirely understand. The kitchen was completely destroyed, and I have yet to arise from my food coma to clean everything up.  \n\nMy GF and I agreed that for the amount of work that went into these chicken bowls, we probably would have been better off just going to Chipotle. $10 per bowl honestly isn\u2019t that bad. \n\nMaking your own food can be healthy and rewarding, but it\u2019s far from easy, and it can be quite exhausting.   Cooking is just really labor-intensive, especially if you want to make something that\u2019s really good.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that we didn't sit down to eat until about 8 PM.  I didn't have the kitchen cleaned up until about 9 PM.  None of what I described even took into consideration the time my GF had to spent shopping for all of the ingredients.

{"title": "Rate my diet (18M, 178cm, need to bulk)", "selftext": "When I was little I always had a very low appetite and there were days where I was \"able\" to eat a single moderate meal+when I started working out I had a chaotic workout program, not having a single pause between sets (chest->back->legs, repeat), that insane cardio and that low calorie intake (they surely were days where I had under 1000kcal per day) led to me having very little mass. October 2023 I had only 54kg, I tried donating blood but wasn't able to, I had already tried bulking for the past year to some extend, but that event really hit a spark in me.\n\nFast forward, I really ate a lot per day, not necessarily a good, diverse diet, but it still was lot, so much that there were several days when I was feeling like vomiting, and I currently have 59kg, although at the beggining of 58kg the progress got really, really slowed. Point is, things with a lot of calories from simple sugars REALLY affected my overall mood and thinking for certain periods, for that reason, I limited my simple sugars to strictly natural sources, occasionally honey. I also remarked that junk food which contained MSG, unhealthy fat and others additives made me crave them into more, temporary impairing my thinking and clearance of mind.\n\nApart from sugar and addictive additives which I already know created cravings, therefore impairing my clearance of mind and mood, I started feeling in a lot of horrible ways, and I suspected it was from some kind of vitamin deficiency. I started taking a lot of supplements (feeling that especially Omega-3 and Ashwaganda helped the most) and concentrated more on taking protein after work-outs and having a good amount of protein per day.\n\nMy \"plan\" was this, please critique it as much as there is to critique:  \nSo, apart from high-calorie junk-food, eating to gain weight would also mean getting more body-fat, which isn't what I really wanted since I barely made out of the skinny-fat problem two years ago, plus I run, a lot, so more body fat wouldn't benefit me too much. I researched about what happens with extra-protein and when would it be considered \"extra\", and I drawed the conclusion that while my first interest was to gain weight, I would rather like not gaining useless body fat while feeling horrible and then do a cut, but just increase the muscle mass. Muscle density is higher than body fat density, therefore my overall volume can be the same, but with more mass. Therefore there are several days where I take 100g+ of protein per day, usually the days when I work out, even though it can be just 2 sets.\n\nCurrently, I am happy with my diet of 2000kcal+ per day, 80g of protein+ per day, no junk food and no added sugar, also no feeling horrible for whatever reason, but is it enough, is it too much, and can it potentially lead me to any long-term problems?\n\nDiet:  \n-daily  \n2-3 eggs in the breakfast with varying type of bread, alternating the cooking oil with EV Coconut oil, EV Olive Oil and animal fat if available (sometimes with dill, parsley and tomatoes)  \n50-100g of nuts per day (either pure nut butter from almonds, cashews and hazelnuts, either simple nuts as snacks, including pumpkin and sunflower seeds)  \n600ml-800ml of milk per day/kefir  \n50g of whey protein/casein (with added bromelain and digestive enzymes)  \n50-100g of sorghum porridge  \n2g of grounded cinnamon (in the protein shake)\n\n-some times per week  \nmeat, mostly poultry, rarely red meat  \nfruits, especially bananas and citrus  \nteas, mostly white tea and other real teas, occasionally herbal  \ncereals and wholegrains other than sorghumchia seeds  \nany kind of cheese  \nhoney in coffee or tea\n\n-some times per month  \npotatoes (in any way)  \nchicken soup, usually with organs  \nif in need of flour to cook something, chickpea flour  \nmac and cheese with a personalized mix which includes nutritional yeast  \nmung beans  \nwhite rice  \nwhatever my parents make me, usually meat with some kind of side dish with legumes or pasta\n\nSupplements:  \nOmega-3 (daily)  \nVitamin D (daily)  \nMultivitamin (C, E, B1,2,3,5,6,7,9,12 , Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, Selenium) (sometimes per week)  \nAshwaganda (daily)  \nChlorella (I take 1-3 times per week, to detox the possible heavy metals from the diet or supplementation)\n\nI drink a lot of water daily, also I have no digestive problems, the digestive enzymes, kefir and sorghum porridge takes care of the hardship of digesting fats.\n\nIs there something I am missing in my diet?

When I was 18 I was pretty fat, I came down from 165(kgs) to 90(kgs) and since then my blood sugar, cholesteryn and a lot of my similar stats have changed in the good way. \n\n\r  \nLately I have just noticed my energy level (especially on the morning) is pretty low, even though use to sleep good. And btw, never smoked, since I dont like alcohol I dont drink at all (except cola), and (that is probably the weirdest) I do not drink coffee at all. But here is my questions. \n\n\r  \n1, What does actually mean to eat healthy? - I tried to look up on the internet but site by site recommended different food with some mutuals (like Kale, Quinoa, fish). I grew up on near to the Balkan and people said and believed like vegetables, fruits and meat as healthy. But for example a lot of sites on the internet don't even recommend red meat, while some body builder influencers only eat red meat to get healthy(carnivore diet for example). So for these reasons I am a bit confused. I started to eat Apple and orange every breakfast, instead of sandwiches and bacon. And try to eat more fish and lean meat with steamed vegetables instead of rice.\n\n\r  \n2, Why some sites only recommend water as the only one drink I can pote? - This is my worst habit, I barely find the water potable. If i drink it, it is some mineral water (but as far as I know European companies they probably sell tap water with label). My favorite drink is a type of cola, that contains absolute zero sugar, but for exchange it has ASPARTAME in it. I have the same problem as I have in the previous question. Some sites says it is worse than sugar, some says it is good for a certain daily limit. \n\n\r  \n3, What does absolutely recommended to cut out/avoid from my diet? - For example for years I ate sandwiches for breakfast, and nowadays when I started to read healthy eating articles and white bread is not recommended at all. \n\n\r  \nThank you for your help in advance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1c4i04n/where_can_i_start_eating_healthychanging_lifestyle/", "created_utc": 1713173549.0, "score": 4, "author": "HetvenOt", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1c4i04n/where_can_i_start_eating_healthychanging_lifestyle/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Quitting soda ", "selftext": "Curious as to how everyone whose been through this addiction has managed it. I grew up in a huge soda addict household. I remember so clearly from my childhood how my mother would go through the McDonald\u2019s drive thru for soda day in and out sometimes more than once a day. \n\nSo needless to say I never really learned just how bad soda was for you. Especially not as a relatively active teen that didn\u2019t see the consequences. Now as an adult it\u2019s affected my teeth and my weight severely. \n\nI\u2019ve quit several times cold Turkey and found that when I go that way I never stay off it long term. This time I\u2019m trying to slowly cut it out. Currently I allow myself 1 soda day for every 2 non-soda days. In two weeks I plan to make that 1 soda for every 4 non-soda days and then another 2 weeks down to 1 soda day per week. Then 1 soda one day a week and then nothing. \n\nI know I\u2019ve read about \u201cfinding a substitute\u201d to replace what I like about soda. Here\u2019s the problem for me. I\u2019ve found a substitute for the carbonation and caffeine. One that\u2019s low calories, no sugar, no corn syrup, etc etc etc. but I turn to soda as a stress reaction. I\u2019ve read that drinking soda releases the feel good chemicals in our brain. So whenever I\u2019m feeling stressed out, I automatically want a soda even if I\u2019m not craving it for any other reason. My substitute doesn\u2019t give me that feel good reaction. As far as limiting stressors. I just moved half way cross the country, switched job, and am in a rental while trying to buy a house. So probably not going to happen until I\u2019m settled.

{"title": "Balanced Meals/Fat Loss Help", "selftext": "Hello! I\u2019m relatively new to reddit, and thought i should probably give somewhat of a background before explaining what i\u2019m asking- I\u2019m 19 and have struggled with an ED in the past (doing much better now). Although I\u2019m looking to \u201close weight\u201d (more so lose fat than the actual number on the scale) and gain muscle, I don\u2019t want to be restrictive, for obvious reasons. I want to focus on a LIFESTYLE change. This will not be a diet for me, I want to work towards my forever eating habits- if that makes sense. I know a fair amount of info on nutrition and the basics of what and what not to do when it comes to eating/fitness, but I definitely need some help. Okay, let me stop running on and on and actually explain where your help is needed:)\n\nI\u2019ve been vegetarian for about 7.5 years now, recently going pescatarian (i\u2019m not interested in ethical debates so please do not comment on that, it\u2019s a difficult personal decision I made recently and don\u2019t want to explain myself). So it\u2019s certainly been easier to get more protein in. Anywho, I struggle with knowing the correct nutrition intake for MYSELF. I do use Lifesum, but after doing a little more research, I\u2019ve realized their recommendations based off of my weigh/age/height is slightly off. So, I figured i\u2019d lay it all out here and see what y\u2019all have to say. \n\nAge: 19\nWeight: 137lb\nHeight: 5\u2019 5\u201d\n\nCurrent Split:\n\n3x12/progressive overload \n\nMonday/Tuesday/Saturday- strength training\nWednesday/Thursday- pilates\n\nI FREQUENTLY surpass my fat intake on Lifesum (recommended at 54g/day) and never hit my protein goal, usually hitting or sitting at slightly below my calories deficit goal. With that being said, what are your recommendations for my nutritional intake based off of the info i\u2019ve provided? If you need anything else i\u2019d be more than happy to provide it! Thank you and i\u2019m so sorry for the novel of a post!!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1bgznwy/balanced_mealsfat_loss_help/", "created_utc": 1710687791.0, "score": 2, "author": "spritualstoner", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1bgznwy/balanced_mealsfat_loss_help/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Any advice on maintaining a low-risk lifestyle to excel in the Rice Purity Test?", "selftext": "  \n\nThe Rice Purity Test has become a popular online quiz designed to assess an individual's level of innocence or purity based on a series of questions about their past experiences. While it may be seen as a lighthearted activity, many individuals take it seriously and strive to achieve a low score, indicating a higher level of perceived purity. To excel in the [**Rice Purity Test**](https://ricepuritytestsscore.com/), one must adopt a low-risk lifestyle. In this article, we will explore various pieces of advice to help you maintain a low-risk lifestyle and achieve optimal results on the Rice Purity Test.\n\n## Understanding the Rice Purity Test\n\nBefore delving into advice on maintaining a low-risk lifestyle, it's crucial to understand the nature of the Rice Purity Test. The test consists of a set of questions that cover a wide range of experiences, from romantic and sexual activities to substance use and illegal behaviors. Respondents answer each question honestly, and based on their responses, a score is generated, with lower scores reflecting a higher level of perceived purity.\n\nThe desire to achieve a low score on the Rice Purity Test often stems from personal values, cultural influences, or a desire to conform to societal expectations. It's important to note that the test is not a definitive measure of a person's character or morality but rather a reflection of their past experiences.\n\n## Tips for Maintaining a Low-Risk Lifestyle\n\n### Communication and Boundaries\n\nEstablishing clear communication and setting personal boundaries are essential aspects of maintaining a low-risk lifestyle. Communicate openly with friends, partners, and acquaintances about your comfort levels and establish boundaries that align with your values. Being assertive about your limits can help prevent situations that may lead to higher scores on the Rice Purity Test.\n\n### Educate Yourself\n\nKnowledge is a powerful tool in making informed decisions. Take the time to educate yourself about the potential risks associated with certain activities, substances, or behaviors. Understanding the consequences can empower you to make choices that align with your goal of achieving a low score on the Rice Purity Test.\n\n### Peer Influence and Peer Pressure\n\nPeer influence can play a significant role in shaping behavior. Surround yourself with friends who respect your values and support your decision to maintain a low-risk lifestyle. Be aware of peer pressure and have the courage to say no to activities that may compromise your goals on the Rice Purity Test.\n\n### Choose Healthy Relationships\n\nHealthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and shared values. When it comes to romantic and sexual experiences, choose partners who align with your desire for a low-risk lifestyle. Open communication and mutual understanding are key components of a healthy relationship.\n\n### Practice Safe Behaviors\n\nWhether engaging in sexual activities or experimenting with substances, prioritize safety. Use protection during intimate encounters, get regular health check-ups, and be aware of the potential risks associated with substance use. Practicing safe behaviors is not only responsible but also contributes to a low-risk lifestyle.\n\n### Avoid Peer Pressure\n\nThe pressure to conform to societal norms or peer expectations can be intense. However, maintaining a low-risk lifestyle requires the ability to resist such pressures. Develop a strong sense of self-confidence and self-worth, allowing you to make decisions based on your values rather than external influences.\n\n### Mindful Socializing\n\nWhen attending social events, be mindful of the environment and activities taking place. Avoid situations that may lead to compromising your low-risk lifestyle goals. Choose social activities that align with your values and provide a supportive, positive atmosphere.\n\n### Self-Reflection\n\nRegular self-reflection is crucial in assessing your actions and decisions. Take the time to reflect on your experiences, values, and goals. This self-awareness can help you stay focused on maintaining a low-risk lifestyle and making choices that contribute to a lower score on the Rice Purity Test.\n\n## Seek Support\n\nIt's important to recognize that maintaining a low-risk lifestyle may come with challenges. Seek support from friends, family, or mentors who understand and respect your goals. Having a support system can provide encouragement and guidance during moments of uncertainty.\n\n### Respect Personal Choices\n\nEveryone has different values and comfort levels. It's essential to respect the choices of others, even if they differ from your own. Cultivate an environment of understanding and tolerance, recognizing that individuals may have diverse reasons for their lifestyle choices.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMaintaining a low-risk lifestyle to excel in the Rice Purity Test involves a combination of self-awareness, communication, and informed decision-making. It's important to approach the test with a mindset of personal growth rather than judgment, understanding that everyone has unique experiences and values. By following the tips outlined in this article, you can navigate social situations, relationships, and personal choices in a way that aligns with your goal of achieving a low score on the [**Rice Purity Test**](https://ricepuritytestsscore.com/).

{"title": "Why Low Acid Coffee Is Your Gentle Brew Companion", "selftext": "**Hello Everyone**  \n\n\n**Did You know what is benefit of drinking  Low-Acid Coffee** \n\n Low-acid coffee, also known as \"smooth\" or \"mellow\" coffee, offers a multitude of benefits that can be quite appealing to coffee lovers. Let's delve into the world of low-acid coffee and explore its advantages.  \n**Why Choose Low-Acid Coffee?**  \nImagine this: You wake up in the morning, craving a cup of coffee, but you're prone to acid reflux, heartburn, or a sensitive stomach. The usual acidic brew can wreak havoc on your digestive system, leaving you uncomfortable and with a bitter taste in your mouth. This is where low-acid coffee steps in to save the day.  \nLow-acid coffee is a game-changer for those who experience digestive discomfort or want a smoother, gentler coffee experience. Here's why it's worth considering:  \n**1. Reduced Gastrointestinal Distress**  \nLow-acid coffee contains significantly less acid than regular coffee. The reduced acidity can help alleviate common digestive issues, making it a great choice for individuals with acid reflux, gastritis, or sensitive stomachs. By reducing the chances of stomach discomfort, it allows you to enjoy your morning ritual without worrying about unpleasant side effects.  \n**2. Protecting Your Tooth Enamel**  \nAcidic drinks, such as traditional coffee, can erode tooth enamel over time. Low-acid coffee is less damaging to your dental health. You can savor the rich flavors of coffee without the guilt of potentially harming your teeth.  \n**3. A Smooth and Mild Flavor**  \nLow-acid coffee is often praised for its smooth and mellow taste. It's not just about the reduced acidity; it's about the delightful flavor profile that can be appreciated by coffee connoisseurs. With its balanced and gentle taste, it offers a unique coffee experience.  \n4. Better for Your Overall Health  \nThe health benefits of low-acid coffee go beyond just digestion and dental care. It is also rich in antioxidants, which can help protect your body against free radicals and oxidative stress. Antioxidants contribute to overall well-being and may help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.  \n**5. Less Bitterness, More Enjoyment**  \nLow-acid coffee tends to be less bitter than its high-acid counterparts. The bitterness in coffee can be an acquired taste, and many people prefer a smoother, more pleasant cup. Low-acid coffee satisfies that preference without compromising on the coffee's inherent charm.  \nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a coffee that is easy on your stomach, teeth, and taste buds, low-acid coffee is a fantastic choice. It offers a well-rounded coffee experience with a plethora of health benefits. So, go ahead and explore the world of low-acid coffee; your body and your taste buds will thank you.  \nFor more information on health and wellness, including tips on choosing the right coffee for your needs, you can visit [WellnessUniverse.fit](https://wellnessuniverse.fit/low-acid-coffee-benefits/).

I used the canned stuff instead.\n\nFor point of reference, I tend to eat things piecemeal rather than mixing ingredients. I just never learned to cook that way.\n\nI also don't know what snacks to eat that aren't insanely expensive or that I actually like. I don't like yogurt or baby carrots that much and I can't stand celery. Nuts are insanely expensive. But that's usually what people say to eat. I want things I don't have to *make*. I want to grab a snack and go.\n\nFood preferences to avoid the inevitable someone giving me something I don't like:\nI don't like cooking chicken, it's annoying to cook. I like chicken, I just don't like cooking it.\nI usually don't like meat unless it's grilled because with pork and chicken it makes this like gelatinous fat goo on the bottom and with steak it's just not the same.\nSeafood of any kind is the absolute best but it's expensive.\nVegetables cooked and fruit raw is a general rule of thumb with me. Tomatoes raw and carrots cooked. Subjective based on definitions.\nI love potatoes but I'm not supposed to eat them. Sweet potatoes are not the same.\nFlavorwise think Japanese steakhouse. Friggin love that stuff. Like hibachi and sushi and that rice with the eggs! I know that's probably the American version but I do generally like Asian foods the most.\nI've been told I should do Mediterranean for health reasons but I'm a bit texture-picky when it comes to mixing stuff together. I'm sure my palate will adjust from sugar addict to actual food eventually, but it has to be something I will like in order for me to actually make it.\nTofu is weird. I don't really know how to cook it and the flavor is weird. I know it depends on the brand though.\nI want to use beans, but I don't really know how to use them and it seems dumb to just eat straight beans.\nOatmeal is okay. I don't love the texture, but I like it with just chocolate chips in it.\nI generally just don't like gelatinous or liquid things.

These fibers may help to lower LDL cholesterol and slow down digestion, which can prevent blood sugar spikes after eating a meal and promote a feeling of fullness.\n\n*https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/chia-seeds/*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/14g6dwb/is_chia_seed_soluble_or_insoluble_fiber/", "created_utc": 1687447311.0, "score": 3, "author": "curiousotter69", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/14g6dwb/is_chia_seed_soluble_or_insoluble_fiber/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What to know about protein", "selftext": "I'm an editor at The Washington Post and we recently wrote about protein. You can read the full story here: [https://wapo.st/3BXsJhw](https://wapo.st/3BXsJhw) (this is a gift link and doesn't have a paywall)  \n\n\nHere's an excerpt from Gretchen Reynold's story:  \n\n\n**Active people need more protein than couch potatoes**  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re sedentary, you officially need about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, according to the recommended daily allowance set by the government\u2019s Food and Nutrition Board. This translates to somewhere between 45 to 60 grams of daily protein for most people who rarely exercise \u2014 or approximately two chicken breasts (about 30 grams of protein each) or a 6-ounce can of tuna (about 40 grams) and a quarter-cup of almonds (about 8 grams).But this amount is almost certainly too low for many of us. The recommendation \u201cfor protein might be enough to keep us alive, but it is too low for physically active people,\u201d said Eric Rawson, a professor of nutrition and exercise at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pa.\n\nFor active people, a better recommendation would be \u201c1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram\u201d of body weight each day, Phillips said, or higher, \u201cup to a level of 1.6 grams per kilogram\u201d of body weight daily if you\u2019re physically active. In simple terms, if you weigh 160 pounds, or 72.5 kilograms, then 1 gram per kilogram of your weight is 72.5 grams of daily protein, which you could get by eating, over the course of your day, a 6-ounce steak (about 42 grams), a cup of Greek yogurt (about 17 grams) and a half-cup of tofu (about 20 grams).\n\nSome researchers advocate for more, though, especially for athletes in the middle of heavy training, when their muscles are under constant strain. For them, the \u201coptimal\u201d amount of protein may be as high as 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight every day or approximately a gram of protein for every pound of body weight, said Shawn Arent, the chairman of the department of exercise science at the University of South Carolina and a longtime sports nutrition researcher.  \n\n\n**You don\u2019t need that whey shake.**  \n\n\nStill concerned about getting enough protein? Supplements, like shakes and bars \u201care convenient,\u201d Phillips said. But so is a hard-boiled egg, which contains about 6 grams of protein, or a chicken breast. \u201cI eat a lot of Greek yogurt and chicken,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s little evidence that certain proteins are more nutritious than others, although some people swear by whey powder. Derived from milk, whey is a good source of leucine, an amino acid that helps jump-start muscle building. \u201cBut so is Greek-style yogurt,\u201d Phillips said, or salmon, which is packed with leucine.\n\n\u201cWhey protein has falsely been put on a pedestal as superior due to aggressive sports marketing campaigns,\u201d Burd said.\n\nMost people, including athletes, can get sufficient protein without needing powdered whey, even if they don\u2019t eat meat.\n\n\u201cVegetarian and vegan athletes can easily meet protein needs on a plant-based diet,\u201d said Enette Larson-Meyer, the director of the Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism Laboratory at Virginia Tech and co-author of Plant-Based Sports Nutrition.\n\nPlant proteins may not be complete, she said, meaning they don\u2019t contain all the amino acids we need, but \u201cconsuming a combination of different plant-based protein sources, such as beans and grain, will provide a balanced protein profile.\u201d If your diet is plant forward, but not fully vegetarian, add an egg or some cheese to improve a mostly vegetarian dish\u2019s \u201camino-acid profile,\u201d she said.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/13rosie/what_to_know_about_protein/", "created_utc": 1685038021.0, "score": 9, "author": "AvivaLoeb", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/13rosie/what_to_know_about_protein/", "html_title": ""}

Here we are in May and I have yet to go to the gym. The past year and a half I\u2019ve never been so depressed. Every time I get home from work I\u2019m absolutely drained and all I want to do is lay down. I used to be a really athletic kid. I did sports. Wasn\u2019t even bad at them and started varsity in football. I am around 5\u20198. I used to weigh 160 and I\u2019ve jumped up to 235. That\u2019s a huge jump. I used to lift everyday and workout but now that I don\u2019t have workouts and coaching I find it hard to find programs and continue to stay focused on the main goal. The reason I\u2019m coming here today is because I\u2019d like to change how I am. I\u2019m tired of being out of shape. I\u2019m tired of looking in the mirror and seeing who I used to be deep within the image of who I am today. I am tired of being lonely and insecure, not having the confidence to talk to girls, not having the confidence to workout with friends, not even having the confidence to go out to the bars. It\u2019s time I do something and make my self suffer a little bit to become something great l. I feel like I\u2019ve just wasted the last year and a half away and that these are the best days of my life to be wasted away. I\u2019d like to get on a clean eating diet and portion recommendation that would help me slim down. I also would like to know what times are the best times to eat to avoid bloating and weight gain. \nI seriously don\u2019t know which foods are good for fat burning and muscle growth. Along with that I\u2019d also like to know how I should go about working out. My main goal is to cut my fat and get comfortable in my skin and then hit the weight hard again to bulk on top of my frame. I\u2019m just wondering what is the best way to go about this? Should I burn the fat first then put on the muscle? Or should I do both at once? I feel really uneducated and Misinformed when it comes to fitness. I\u2019m hoping I could have someone guide me through the process of fat loss and muscle gains from when to workout and how much to what to eat and what exercises to do. I hope someone can relate to me and help me with my comeback story. This means the world to me and I really feel like this could affect my long term health if I don\u2019t act quick. If you read through all of this god bless you and thank you so much. Anything helps I\u2019m just looking to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks Reddit I\u2019m advance!

Protein for weight loss & weight gain", "selftext": "\n\nI got to know exactly about the protein, how exactly it works & it is beneficial for both weight loss and weight gain. This is not a advertisement, it\u2019s just I\u2019m sharing my knowledge which was beneficial for me hope it will be helpful for you guys\u2026.\n\nProtein is a macronutrient that is essential for building muscle mass. Protein is commonly found in animal products, though it is also present in other sources, such as nuts and legumes. There are a total of three macronutrients: Protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Macronutrients provide calories or energy to the human body.\n\nProtein Benefits\n\n1. Protein for your body\n\nYour body needs protein to stay healthy and work the way it should. More than 10,000 types are found in everything from your organs to your muscles and tissues to your bones, skin, and hair. \n\n2. Protein for good & healthy skin\n\nProtein is essential for generating healthy skin and nails. The collagen and amino acids found in whey protein help maintain skin elasticity and firmness.\n\n3. Protein for weight loss\n\nBy replacing carbs and fat with protein, you reduce the hunger hormone and boost several satiety hormones. This leads to a major reduction in hunger and is the main reason protein helps you lose weight. It can make you eat fewer calories automatically.\nThat\u2019s how protein helps for weight loss in a healthy way!\n\n4. Adding Protein to your daily diet is amazing\n\nProteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. Proteins do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body\u2019s tissues and organs.\n\n\u201cIt is important for individuals to consume protein every day.\n\n5. Protein for your sexual lifestyle\n\nEating meats, or other foods that contain specific amino acids, could help improve your sex life.

{"title": "Health Benefits of Kiwi Fruit", "selftext": " \n\nKnowing about the nutrients present in Kiwi doesn't give you enough proof to convince you of the everyday intake of Kiwi. To make you think about why you are still not eating Kiwi, let's jump into the unbelievable facts and incredible health benefits of kiwi fruits.\u00a0\n\n### 1. A Robust Antioxidants\n\nThis fruit is infused with a massive amount of antioxidants. These antioxidants can neutralize the free radicals and make it a shield that helps you protect yourself from any bodily damage.\u00a0\n\n### 2. Helps in Weight Loss\n\nAhh!! This is a critical point. Almost 9 out of 10 people are searching for a healthy solution to this problem. Let me tell you that incorporating Kiwi in your diet helps you lose weight as they are deficient in energy density and calories.\u00a0\n\n### 3. Helps to reduce Nervousness and Stress\n\nKiwi is an excellent solution for the reduction of nervousness and stress. Anxiety attacks can sometimes worsen; the vitamin C present in Kiwi will prevent your body from anxiety attacks and nervousness. Now don't forget to enumerate Kiwi into your fruit lists.\u00a0\n\n### 4. Fights Anemia\n\nLow hemoglobin? Suffering from anemia? Fed up of medicines? Switch to the natural medicine of anemia \u2013 Kiwi! Thanks to the Vitamin C present in Kiwi, the absorption power of iron from food is enhanced.\n\n### 5. Is Cardio-Protective\n\nIf you want to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, start taking Kiwi fruits from today. This small, fuzzy-skinned, juicy fruit can decrease the platelet aggregation level as well as blood triglycerides, the two most common risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.\u00a0\n\n### 6. Treats Asthma\n\nNothing can be more painful than not being able to breathe. Isn't it! Most people say that Asthma doesn't have a particular medicine that can cure the patient 100%. But Kiwi has magical features that can certainly help you to treat Asthma. The reason behind the magic is Vitamin C. Kiwi built a protective cover against the germs that cause respiratory diseases.\n\n### 7. Prevents Constipation\n\nConstipation may seem like a common thing to you, but it harms the body. To those who have constipation problems, Kiwi can help you to get rid of this problem. You might still be a stranger because Kiwi is rich in dietary fibers, which will help you maintain regular bowel movements. The inclusion of Kiwi fruits in the breakfast will undoubtedly help you to improve the production of stool. Moreover, the fuzzy skin of the Kiwi helps to get rid of toxins out of the body and the intestinal tract.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n### 8. Controlling Blood Pressure\n\nIf you are a hypotension patient and want to control your BP, Kiwi can become your best friend. Kiwi has unique characteristics that help in controlling the sodium in the blood. You will also need potassium which will balance the minerals in the blood. But excessive intake of potassium can cause hypertension. Hence Kiwi should be taken by the person with hypotension and avoided by high blood pressure or hypertension.\n\n### 9. Beneficial During Pregnancy\n\nPregnancy is a critical time for a lady. They have to be very cautious about how they live and what they are eating, as, during pregnancy, they are not the only person who is eating; a tiny life is also taking the food. Hence they have to plan their diet carefully. According to the nutritionist, Kiwi plays an essential role in the balanced diet of pregnant women. We can find folic acid in Kiwi, which is very important for pregnant women because it helps develop the fetus's essential organs inside the womb. Folic acid also defends against congenital disabilities. Hence if you are a pregnant lady, you know what you need to start consuming!\n\n### 10. Strengthens the Immune System\n\nTo be healthy, one needs to strengthen the immune system. Kiwi knows the secret to enhancing the immune system. As we all know, vitamin C is essential to enhance the immune system, and Kiwi is the best example of a fruit with maximum vitamin C, just like an orange. According to RDA for Indians (2020), a sedentary adult man requires 80 mg of vitamin C every day. A sedentary adult female requires 65 mg/day of vitamin C. Therefore, eating one kiwi fruit in the whole day can quickly fulfill the vitamin C requirement as it has 92.7 mg/100 gm of vitamin C. In this way, Kiwi helps increase the immune system and help you defend against harmful germs.\n\n## Benefits of Kiwi fruit for Weight Loss and Skin\n\nMost people are curious about knowing more about how Kiwi fruit help in losing body weight and makes the skin look young and healthy. Let's take a look at them.\n\n### Benefits of Kiwi fruit for Weight Loss\n\n* Kiwis are nutrient-dense and are an excellent source of vitamin C, folate, vitamin K, and fiber, and have powerful health benefits.\n* A study conducted on 41 people with prediabetes who ate two golden kiwis per day for 12 weeks found that they experienced higher vitamin C levels, changes in blood pressure, and weight loss.\n* Additional studies found that Kiwis provide additional weight loss benefits like controlling blood sugar, improving cholesterol, and supporting gut health.\n* Moreover, Kiwis have a low GI resulting in smaller blood sugar spikes. Diets high in fiber from fruits and vegetables have been shown to promote weight loss, increase fullness, and improve gut health. Kiwis are rich in dietary fiber. One small, peeled fruit or 69 g has over 2 g of fiber, while the peel alone provides 1 g of additional fiber.\n\n### Benefits of Kiwi fruit for Skin\n\n* The benefits of Kiwi fruit for skin comes from the polyphenols and antioxidant vitamins present in the Kiwi fruit.\n* Kiwi contains a polyphenol called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). EGCG can protect your skin from oxidative stress and possibly even skin cancer.\n* Studies show that vitamin C may limit skin damage from UV radiation. The vitamin also boosts collagen formation and may prevent skin discoloration. Vitamin E protect your skin from damage caused by UV radiation and oxidative stress.\n* Lutein and zeaxanthin can reduce dark spots on your skin, especially when combined. They also increase the levels of carotenoids, which protect skin from the harmful effects of sunlight.\n* The peel, or \u201cskin,\u201d of kiwifruit is rich in these nutrients than the soft, sweet interior. To get the most nutrients present in Kiwi, try eating it next time you enjoy a kiwi fruit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/123kyvf/health_benefits_of_kiwi_fruit/", "created_utc": 1679918521.0, "score": 17, "author": "rockz3r", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/123kyvf/health_benefits_of_kiwi_fruit/", "html_title": ""}

When you\u2019re ready to make the smoothie, simply blend the ingredients together.\n4. Keep it cool: If you\u2019re taking your tropical smoothie on the go, it\u2019s important to keep it cool.

But it's even harder to help because he's an extremely picky eater. I could eat vegetables all day in all different forms. Him not so much. He's tried and hated ALL vegetables. Only ones he really tolerates is green beans, peas, carrots. But even those he still doesn't like very much but tolerable. He really would only eat corn if he had the choice. I've even tried putting some of these vegetables that he tolerates in other foods like pastas or other dishes and he doesnt like that because it take away from the original meal flavors and doesn't like the vegetable flavors. He would essentially live off meat, pasta, and potatoes, corn and other non healthy foods if he could. It's even hard for him to eat salads without a bunch of dressing because he doesn't like the taste of lettuce. We both don't like sea food. He can do shrimp and tuna. I can do tilapia tuna and maybe salmon pattys but thats it. He's asking me for help with our food habits but I feel at such a loss with knowing how to help him.

{"title": "Love me some turmeric, here are some benefits.", "selftext": " \n\nTurmeric is a spice that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. It is a member of the ginger family and is commonly used in South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine. Turmeric has a distinctive bright yellow color and a slightly bitter taste. In recent years, turmeric has gained popularity in the Western world due to its many health benefits. In this article, we will explore the benefits of turmeric.\n\n1. Turmeric is a [natural anti-inflammatory](https://liquidaurora.com/)\n\nTurmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation is believed to be a contributing factor in many chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. By reducing inflammation in the body, turmeric may help reduce the risk of these diseases.\n\n1. Turmeric may help reduce the risk of heart disease\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Studies have shown that turmeric may help reduce the risk of heart disease by improving the function of the endothelium, which is the lining of the blood vessels. Turmeric may also help lower levels of LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and reduce the risk of blood clots.\n\n1. Turmeric may help prevent and treat cancer\n\nSeveral studies have shown that curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, may help prevent and treat cancer. Curcumin has been shown to have anti-cancer properties and may help prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells. Some studies have also shown that turmeric may help improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\n1. Turmeric may help improve brain function\n\nCurcumin may help improve brain function by increasing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is a type of growth hormone that is essential for the growth and survival of neurons. Low levels of BDNF have been linked to depression and Alzheimer's disease. By increasing levels of BDNF, turmeric may help improve mood and cognitive function.\n\n1. Turmeric may help[ reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/risk-factors-and-prevention/turmeric-and-dementia#:~:text=Another%20chemical%20in%20turmeric%20that,neurodegenerative%20conditions%20like%20Alzheimer's%20disease.)\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Studies have shown that curcumin may help reduce the accumulation of these plaques and reduce inflammation in the brain. Curcumin may also help improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n1. Turmeric may help improve digestion\n\nTurmeric has been used in traditional medicine to treat digestive problems such as indigestion, bloating, and gas. Studies have shown that turmeric may help improve digestion by increasing the production of bile, which is necessary for the digestion of fats. Turmeric may also help reduce inflammation in the digestive tract and improve the symptoms of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Crohn's disease.\n\n1. Turmeric may help relieve pain and inflammation\n\nTurmeric has been shown to have analgesic properties, which means it may help relieve pain. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory molecules in the body, which may help reduce pain and inflammation associated with conditions such as arthritis.\n\n1. Turmeric may help improve skin health\n\nCurcumin may help improve skin health by reducing inflammation and protecting the skin from the damaging effects of free radicals. Studies have shown that curcumin may help reduce the risk of skin cancer and improve the symptoms of skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema.\n\n1. Turmeric may help improve liver function\n\nThe liver is responsible for detoxifying the body and producing bile, which is necessary for the digestion of fats. Curcumin may help improve liver function by increasing the production of bile and reducing inflammation in the liver. Turmeric may also help protect the liver from damage caused by toxins and alcohol.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1153dn5/love_me_some_turmeric_here_are_some_benefits/", "created_utc": 1676683610.0, "score": 2, "author": "thefourthinitiate", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1153dn5/love_me_some_turmeric_here_are_some_benefits/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to gain weight?", "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is the right sub but I've tried everywhere else and they say no medical issues allowed so I'm hoping I'm allowed to post this here.\n\nI'm a 17f and this summer holiday, I've lost 2-3kgs. Not intentionally and it's getting unhealthy. I'm getting dizzy easily and I don't even have the strength to pull down the handbrake with one hand (even with two hands, I struggle). \n\nI am not purposely trying to lose weight but food just doesn't interest me. It's not tasty or fun or whatever people like to say about it. \n\nMy biggest problems seem to be:\n\n- chewing too slowly so I get full quicker (takes me 20 minutes to finish chewing meat and fibres sometimes)\n- because of this, I instinctively drink a lot of water when I'm starving, making me bloated and giving the illusion of fullness.\n- I lose any and all interest in my food after a few bites. If I'm hungry, I'll devour it but the moment I need to stop stuffing my mouth and start chewing, I've lost all interest in the texture and taste of the food. I just stop finding the food delicious after already having tried it. I know what it tastes like now, I find no reason to continue (and physically impossible sometimes).\n- my poor executive function makes it near impossible to cook meals so I resort to instant ramen for 80% of my meals. I can't finish a single serving of ramen if it isn't insanely spicy.\n\nI've tried eliminating distractions during my meal, I've tried talking with family during my meal, my eating continues as the same. It doesn't help that I'm insanely picky and refuse to try new foods, resulting in me eating what I already know which then results in me stopping sooner.\n\nAnd I'm not stopping or leaving food because I'm full, I could be starving but I'll still stop eating just because the food isn't appealing anymore. I physically won't be able to force myself to continue eating after this point. \n\nI also wake up extremely later in the day and skip breakfast because breakfast makes my stomach hurt like a bitch. This leads to my first meal being at around 12-1pm which means I don't get hungry until 5pm and by that point, I just wait until 7pm for dinner. No snacks in between because I don't like snacks. Breakfast is usually ramen and dinner is usually rice with korean stew and side dishes but I almost always only eat half the bowl of rice. Sometimes when I do eat at 10am, I forget to eat lunch/forget that I'm hungry (I just get used to the feeling of being hungry and don't register it as me needing food) until 3, 5pm. I'll usually have an early dinner then because the moment I recognise the hunger, it gets unbearable. \n\nFor context, I'm 165-7cm and 45kg and I look like a skeleton. My parents' friends comment on it whenever I see them and many people have told me to gain weight. I get lightheaded if I stand up after sitting down for a long time and apparently my blood pressure is on the lower side. I bruise easily so exercise scares me but I want to be healthy instead of being a borderline walking skeleton. I get exhausted after 20 minutes of walking which is insane. I volunteered to participate in a school festival in a dance group but the members told me to gain weight because my moves looked awkward and powerless without fat in my arms. I went to a job interview and the interviewer said I weighed more than I looked so I'm guessing I look really bad from stranger's eyes :( \n\nI have had an eating disorder in the past (not diagnosed) but this has nothing to do with that. All the effects that the disorder had on my body are gone now and I just want the strength to pull my car keys out of the ignition ;-;\n\nI apologise if this post sounds like I'm boasting about my weight. I've tried to talk to some friends about it and they've all told me that I sound like an asshole when I say this stuff so I'm really hoping I don't come off like that. \n\nTl;dr: I lose all interest in food after a few bites and stop eating even if I'm hungry. I have two meals a day 99% of the time and no snacks in between. My meals are usually instant ramen and a korean meal. I want to start gaining weight in a healthy way because everybody around me is telling me I'm too skinny and I've noticed my weight is impacting my daily life but I can't get myself to eat more after I lose interest in the food. I usually can't finish 1 serving of instant ramen or 1 bowl of rice. I don't have money for the gym but it's one of the first things I'll invest in once I start part time again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/10qa0tn/how_to_gain_weight/", "created_utc": 1675198112.0, "score": 3, "author": "None", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/10qa0tn/how_to_gain_weight/", "html_title": ""}

It's actually the perfect protein. They have only 155 calories per 100 grams. Having into account that they provide B12, it's nice.

{"title": "Top 10 sports supplements: what, who, and for what", "selftext": "The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) stresses that the basis of a good training and high-performance program is a healthy, nutrient-rich diet.\n\nWhat role does sports nutrition play in this and is it really necessary? Analysis by MedAboutMe.\n\n## What is sports nutrition?\n\nSports supplements are now a multi-million dollar industry. Athletes and people with active lifestyles come after attractive advertising from marketers. They promise high performance, increased strength and stamina, increased muscle mass, an endless source of energy, and help with weight loss.\n\nExperts estimate that between 39% and 89% of the international sports supplement market is used by elite and older fitness athletes. At the same time, the lack of quality control of nutritional supplements, as well as clear requirements for their composition, leads some people to take ineffective products.\n\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only a small fraction of nutritional supplements that promise benefits in sports are confirmed in clinical studies. Many supplements, despite their high price, do not guarantee safety and are ineffective in improving sports performance.\n\n## How should an athlete eat?\n\nPeople who participate in sports must have a balanced diet containing sufficient quantities of all the nutrients necessary for health. At the same time, scientific studies show that a balanced diet cannot always meet the needs of a person who engages in intense physical activity.\n\n\"The study of the diet of athletes of both sexes has shown a deficiency of one to several essential vitamins and minerals in the diet,\" explains Daniel Gastelou, physical trainer and expert in nutritional supplements.\n\nThe important thing is that the athlete's daily menu is a variable component that changes according to the energy needs of the individual and the goals he or she sets at the time.\n\n* Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for an athlete. The amount of carbohydrates in the diet is determined by the intensity of training and can vary from 45-65% of the total calories entering the body.\n* Protein is responsible for the growth and recovery of an athlete's muscles. The body's protein requirements can range from 2 to 8 grams per kilogram of an athlete's body weight per day.\n* Fat helps maintain the body's energy balance, regulate hormones, and restore muscle tissue. A 2018 study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends that athletes consume about 30% of their total calories from healthy fats.\n\n## Most popular sports supplements\n\nHere are several types of sports supplements. Some of them help to gain muscle mass, others help with weight loss and body fat \"burning\", and still others help with recovery after intense exercise.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that a single intake of a nutritional supplement does not change anything in terms of health, sports nutrition is taken daily in short or long courses. How does it work? How not to get confused when choosing it?\n\n### 1. Protein\n\nHelp fitness athletes to gain muscle mass and increase the relief of the body. They contain from 70 to 95% protein. There are several types of protein: whey, casein, egg, meat, and soy. All of them complement each other.\n\nExperts believe that taking one type of protein will not give the same significant result as a mixture of several supplements at once. Usually, proteins are taken 2 to 4 times a day.\n\n### 2. BCAA Complex\n\nCombines 3 amino acids - isoleucine, valine and leucine. This \"troika\" represents about 40% of all essential amino acids present in the body's muscle tissue. During intense loads, their intake is consumed first, which explains the need for their intake. In addition to the fact that they contribute to the increase in muscle mass, they are involved in various biochemical processes.\n\nYou can take them in the morning after waking up, as well as before, during, and after training.\n\n### 3. Winners\n\nThis name hides a mixture of protein (most often whey) with a carbohydrate complex. The ratio of carbohydrates to protein may vary depending on the manufacturer of the product. For some players, carbohydrates represent 1/2 of the weight of the product, for others, proteins represent 1/3 of the weight. Vitamins, enzymes, and other useful substances are often used as additional components.\n\nPlayers usually take it once a day. Their main goal is a total body weight package (i.e. fat content as well as muscular mass).\n\n### 4. Creatine\n\nThis is a natural substance found naturally in fish and meat: tuna, herring, salmon, and beef. It helps support muscle growth, promotes faster recovery after workouts, and improves strength performance.\n\nCreatine is available in powder or capsule form for a single dose. The products are usually dissolved in sweetened fruit juice and drunk after training. After 4 weeks of use, advanced athletes recommend a 2-3 week break.\n\n### 5. Amino acid complexes\n\nThese are commercially available in tablet, liquid, and capsule form. Unlike BCAAs, complex amino acids contain their full set of both essential and non-essential. These supplements help build muscle mass and increase strength. They are usually taken several times a day, such as in the morning, before and after training.\n\nFrom the point of view of the advisability of taking amino acids, there are many opinions. But many experts are convinced that if an athlete consumes protein and gainers, amino acids cannot be taken. Otherwise, amino acids in the diet are highly desirable.\n\n### 6. L-carnitine\n\nThis is a non-essential acid that in the body is found mainly in the liver and muscle tissue. Athletes are primarily interested in it as a fat-burning catalyst, as L-carnitine transports fatty acids to the cellular mitochondria. Another important quality of this supplement is that it provides extra energy for training.\n\nIt is usually taken twice a day - immediately after waking up and before training.\n\n### 7. Omega-3\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids have a range of health benefits. They stimulate muscle growth, protect joints and ligaments from overload, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and increase endurance. There is also evidence that they have a positive effect on testosterone synthesis.\n\nA common source of omega-3 is fish oil, familiar to many from childhood. However, essential fatty acids can also be purchased in their pure form - as sports nutrition or pharmaceutical preparations. Take supplements 2 to 3 times a day with meals.\n\n### 8. Fat burners\n\nThis is one of the most controversial sports supplements, and the timeliness of taking it is still controversial among experts in the field. Marketers are convinced that such supplements \"burn\" the fat layer while leaving the muscle mass intact. The mechanism of their action is based on the stimulation of metabolic processes, a decrease in appetite, the elimination of fluids from the body, and an obstacle to the synthesis of fat.\n\nFat burners come in several forms: thermogenic (increase body temperature and metabolic rate), lipotropic (promote the breakdown of fat), blockers (prevent the absorption of fat and carbohydrates from food), and appetite suppressants.\n\n### 9. Vitamin and mineral complexes\n\nTheir reception for athletes has long been the norm. They help meet the body's needs for essential nutrients. It is especially important to consume them during the cold season when the diet is depleted of vitamins and minerals.\n\nSuch supplements increase the general tone of the body and strengthen the immune system, contributing to rapid recovery after training. Take these with food once or twice per day.\n\n### 10. Energy\n\nThis is the fastest way to generate a burst of strength and energy at the right time. Energy drinks relieve fatigue and increase concentration and focus. They usually contain guarana extract, caffeine, and other natural stimulants.\n\nEnergy drinks are produced in the form of powder to make drink, gel, and ready-to-drink versions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/yn2n4v/top_10_sports_supplements_what_who_and_for_what/", "created_utc": 1667674136.0, "score": 1, "author": "simo30072012", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/yn2n4v/top_10_sports_supplements_what_who_and_for_what/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019m pretty physically active so I need to eat a lot to feel satisfied but there aren\u2019t so many options.

{"title": "Motivation to eat healthy", "selftext": "So every Friday night, I go out to dinner with my friends. This is the only time I ever go out to eat, I have set a personal rule that I'm not allowed to eat out unless it's Friday and I'm with my friends. In order to have enough room left in my calorie budget to enjoy myself and not feel guilty when I'm with my friends on Friday, I severely limit myself throughout the rest of the day Friday so that I can have a huge calorie-dense fried restaurant meal and a big dessert while still reaching my calorie goal or only going a little bit over it. I am always hungry all day Friday because I eat a lot less, but I am able to deal with the hunger feeling because I know I'll be able to eat as much as I want later and I want to save for that time. For instance, today it's 4:30 on Friday and I've eaten 500 calories. On a typical day, I would've eaten 1500 calories by 4:30 and I would use the remaining 500 kcal for two small snacks later in the day. My question is, I know I'm capable of eating a lot less than usual when I want to, but how can I get this motivation on other days when I don't have anything like this to look forward to. I am quite happy with my typical intake of 2000 calories per day, it's way down from my old average of 3000+ and I am able to maintain a deficit because I work out 7-9 times a week. However, I still have a lot of weight to lose so I'd like to try to get even more of a deficit if possible, although I don't want to push things too far too quickly and cause myself to get worse.\n\nTLDR: On Fridays I am very good at limiting myself because I have something to look forward to.

These are:\n\n- A couple of breadsticks with cream cheese\n\n- Some rice crackers or seeded flatbread\n\n- A salami stick\n\n- Babybel mini cheese wheel\n\n- A small bag of crisps (chips)\n\n- A tangerine\n\nThis adds up to around 500-550 calories.\n\nDinner: For dinner I've been having either a pizza or just chicken and chips (fries).\n\nAside from the foods mentioned above, I'm also okay with yoghurts, raspberries, strawberries, most breakfast cereals. The only vegetable I've found that I'm okay with is spinach. \n\nAny ideas on what I could do?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/wvqmif/trying_to_improve_my_diet_as_a_picky_eater/", "created_utc": 1661265759.0, "score": 5, "author": "Sea_shanty_2", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/wvqmif/trying_to_improve_my_diet_as_a_picky_eater/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

After the surgery i wasn't allowed to eat at all for a few hours, and later was encouraged to try eating some yogurt. I did but it really hurt so i ended up only eating very little. \nside note I'm very used to pain and assumed no amount of medication would get rid of it completely until i heeled, just got home, took my normal dosage of pain killers for when i get headaches (the high but safe option on the pack, it says one or two and i always take two because one isn't enough) turns out i was wrong and you can be mostly pain free after surgery if you just take the right amount of pain meds for your pain. Anyways I'm mentioning this because evidently i ate very little even when i was allowed to eat because it really hurt to swallow.\nAnyway, two days after the surgery i had a bleed and was no longer allowed to eat or drink for two days, and when i started, once again i ate very very little and drank very little too. \nBasically I've had two days where i ate probably twenty grams of food overall, two days of fasting with IV, and two days where i ate maybe 200-300 grams of food. \nI got home today and took my pain medication, as mentioned the amount i usually take, and it didn't hurt to swallow, at least not to much. I stuck to what the doctor said and only ate soft, mushed food in room temperature or colder, but i ate much much more that i did the previous six day. Still not close to the normal amount i eat usually or anyone does. (I ate a single pack of ramen noodles that i turned into mush and a piece of bread that i chewed thoroughly). \nMy stomach has been gurgling for the past week non stop, so i thought that being able to eat more would help, but i guess i over did it because i got really bad acid reflux and a bit came up. So obviously i need to slow down about making my diet normal again, but at the same time im still super hungry.\nIf i dont eat my stomach hurts, and if i do it does too. I dont know what to do.

{"title": "Low Cholesterol Diet For Your Heart", "selftext": " The food that we eat and the way we cook it, affects our bodies in more ways than one. Consuming high fat and high cholesterol foods, result in the development of atherosclerosis (thickening of the arteries), hypertension (elevated blood pressure levels), and cardiac diseases.\n\nThe case is further worsened if the individual has a sedentary lifestyle and is constantly bombarded with stress and emotional upheavals.\n\nEating correctly goes a long way in keeping the cholesterol levels in check and thus contributing to a healthy and strong heart.\n\nLow fat and low cal recipes do not mean tasteless, unsavory, and bland food. With a little bit of time and patience, you can dish up delicious and exciting meals that will keep your heart and your taste buds happy!\n\nAlso, of particular importance, is the way in which the food is cooked. Methods like steaming, pressure-cooking, and stir-frying are very good techniques of cooking food, since they involve the use of little or no fat. Boiling vegetables and lean meat preserves the texture, color, and the flavor exceedingly well, and does not utilize any fat at all. Avoid boiling for long periods of time though. Likewise, pressure-cooking reduces the cooking time, and thus prevents the loss of valuable nutrients. Stir-frying utilizes very little medium. Opting for olive oil as the cooking medium, is prudent and significantly beneficial.\n\nIf you choose the right ingredients and the optimum method of cooking, you could enjoy an array of dishes, without feeling guilty or inflicting harm on yourself.

{"title": "Vitamin D supplements and their supporting role in bone health Has the pandemic had a negative effect on your outdoor life style?", "selftext": "Millions of people have spent more time indoors these past two years than ever. Due to spending more time indoors than in the past, people are lacking Vitamin D. The lack of vitamin D has been shown to cause bone weakness which can lead to osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and bone density decrease. Vitamin D, along with calcium, absorbs into the bones to promote strength and protection. Not getting enough vitamin D puts you at risk for many other diseases such as heart disease and high blood sugar as well. Finding a solution to this problem is of utmost priority, as bone density loss is a growing problem across the world.   Vitamin D is a hormone essential for calcium absorption and bone mineralization. A Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia in adults. Osteomalacia is softening of one\u2019s bones, this is most commonly caused by low levels of vitamin D. Osteomalacia is also considered the adult form of Rickets. Rickets takes place in children. This occurs when the child has a Vitamin D deficiency. Their bones are softened, distorted, and most of the time, bow inwards. They need medications, increase in Vitamin D in their diets, and in some cases, surgery. Another condition, like osteomalacia, is osteoporosis, which stops your bones from creating more bone mineral since some is lost. This causes your bones to become brittle and puts you at risk of fractures from things as simple as bending over. Bone density is gradually lost after peak bone mass is reached. This usually happens around ages 50-70. These conditions are most commonly diagnosed using a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The DEXA scan works by sending two low dose X-rays, these two X-rays are absorbed differently by bone and tissue. The density profiles that are a result of this test, can then be used to calculate bone mineral density. There are also less common conditions, such as rickets in children.  There is also an increase in bone fractures when there is a Vitamin D deficiency.   A large group of 379 adults from northeast England that were aged 70 years or older, were randomly assigned to three groups of different doses of vitamin D. One group received 12,000 IU, The second group received 24,000 IU, and the last group received 48,000 IU. Each dose was given once a month for 12 months. A dual energy X-Ray absorptiometry was used to measure the bone mass density at the participants hip. They measured each participant\u2019s hip BMD before the experiment for a baseline and at the end of the experiment. The participants had to be 70 years of age or older, from northeast England. The participants could not have had an antiresorptive or anabolic treatment for osteoporosis in the previous three years. They could not have been taking a current supplementary vitamin D of greater than 10 micrograms or a calcium dose of greater than 500 mg/d. The participants could not have experienced a fragility fracture in the past 6 months. Each participant could not have a history of renal stones, previous bilateral hip replacements, or primary hyperthyroidism. The participants could not have a past or present history of hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml. There was no change in bone density after the 12 months of taking the vitamin D supplement. But there was also no decrease in the participants bone density, which may also be seen as a positive. The benefits outweigh the downsides because at the end of the experiment researchers found that the participants had an increase in plasma. Since there was no change then this study shows no association.   One of the studies shortcomings is that the study was done in Northeast England, which has different amounts of sunlight that the U.S., so the results are hard to compare to Americans\u2019 different amounts. Another flaw in the study design is that they allowed patients who already take a daily vitamin D supplement to continue to take that daily vitamin throughout the experiment along with their dose each month. Having the patients take a daily vitamin D supplement along with a higher dose monthly vitamin D supplement could possibly skew the results.   Another shortcoming was that this study shows no association between a higher or lower dose and amount of bone mass density in the different spots on the recipients. Along with this, it does not have a large group of participants in the study. There could have been a wider variety of ethnic groups and cultures. Different ethnic groups would probably have a different outcome as some may have more or less Vitamin D in their lifestyle coming into this study.    Vitamin D is absorbed orally from food and supplements and/or from the sun. We absorb Vitamin D from the sun through the skin. Our skin absorbs UV B radiation, which is then converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is created through the UV rays interacting with our skin\u2019s protein, 7-DHC. Vitamin D through food and supplements is absorbed through the small intestine, with the help of simple diffusion. Vitamin D has many imperative rolls in your body such as regulation of calcium absorption, immune system function, and growth of bones. All of these rolls help improve blood sugar levels, lower risk of certain cancers, and decrease risk of depression. About 42% of Americans are Vitamin D deficient, So you are probably wondering, is this curable? Luckily, it is! Doctors treat this condition by prescribing vitamin D supplements, and an increase in sunlight. For more severe cases like osteoporosis and osteomalacia are usually cured with a weekly pill and diet modification. Because these conditions are more serious, they take more time to cure. Sadly, osteoporosis can never be fully reversed, just managed and one can build up some bone strength, but it can never fully go away. Osteomalacia, however, can be healed in 6 months, but sometimes longer.   Peak bone mass is reached by age 25. The years leading up to this time are very important, because if you do not reach your peak then you are putting yourself at risk for osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and vitamin D deficiency later in life. The greater the peak bone mass, the greater protection from these dangerous conditions you have. As these conditions are seeing an increase across the world, as adults we should see this as a warning. This is also why children are more susceptible to breaking bones, along with being clumsy and foolish. While we do need to spend time in the sun and exercise, we should also take the precautions to not make dumb mistakes or accidents that put us at risk of damaging our bones, especially at the ends of each, as those are still growing. You may have heard of breaking at the bone plate, which can stunt growth. As one grows, the vitamin D is extremely helpful to continue to grow bones at the bone plates, which continue to develop until 16-18 years of age. While bones stop growing, the density continues until middle/late 20s, typically around year 25.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/vt29ri/vitamin_d_supplements_and_their_supporting_role/", "created_utc": 1657145932.0, "score": 1, "author": "Londonmiller6", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/vt29ri/vitamin_d_supplements_and_their_supporting_role/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "We always talk about weight loss, but what really matters are lifestyles that can sustain a healthy weight for a lifetime. Research suggests consuming less of certain nutrients, independent of calories, may significantly help prevent obesity and weight regain.", "selftext": "Obviously losing weight is important, but what does it matter if you just end up regaining it and becoming unhealthy again? Sure you can count calories and get down to a healthy BMI, but once you've reached goal weight, it's not practical to constantly count calories and control your portions for the remainder of your life. It's a big part of why so many people who've lost weight just can't keep it off. However, Research suggests some nutrients have a higher tendency to store more bodyfat than others, even when calories are equated. The kinds of food that show the biggest tendency to store fat appear to be saturated fats, added fructose, trans fat, and food cooked in deep fried oils. Oils cooked at high temperature for long periods tend to increase their saturated fat and trans fat content. It's also a good idea to opt for unrefined carbohydrates.\n\nI will say that saturated fats on a ketogenic diet may not cause the same degree of body fat increase, due to keto's nature of metabolizing more fat than normal. The harm more so applies to saturated fats on diets that are also carb rich.\n\nHere's all the research I've gathered:\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561422002941](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561422002941)\n\n**Longitudinal association of dietary carbohydrate quality with visceral fat deposition and other adiposity indicators**\n\n>Results After controlling for potential confounding factors, a 3-point increment in CQI over 12-month follow-up was associated with a decrease in visceral fat (\u03b2 \u22120.067 z-score, 95% CI -0.088; \u22120.046, p < 0.001), android-to-gynoid fat ratio (\u22120.038, \u22120.059; \u22120.017, p < 0.001), and total fat (\u22120.064, \u22120.080; \u22120.047, p < 0.001). Fibre intake and the ratio of wholegrain/total grain showed the strongest inverse associations with all adiposity indicators.\n\n>Conclusions In this prospective cohort of older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS, we found that improvements in dietary carbohydrate quality over a year were associated with concurrent favorable changes in visceral and overall fat deposition. These associations were mostly driven by dietary fibre and the wholegrain/total grain ratio.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550191/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550191/)\n\n**Overfeeding polyunsaturated and saturated fat causes distinct effects on liver and visceral fat accumulation in humans**\n\n>Both groups gained similar weight. SFA (satyrated fatty acids) however, markedly increased liver fat compared with PUFAs (polyunsatured fatty acids);and caused a twofold larger increase in VAT (visceral fat) than PUFAs. Conversely, PUFAs caused a nearly threefold larger increase in lean tissue than SFAs. Increase in liver fat directly correlated with changes in plasma SFAs and inversely with PUFAs. Genes involved in regulating energy dissipation, insulin resistance, body composition, and fat-cell differentiation in SAT were differentially regulated between diets, and associated with increased PUFAs in SAT. In conclusion, overeating SFAs promotes hepatic and visceral fat storage, whereas excess energy from PUFAs may instead promote lean tissue in healthy humans.\n\n[https://iadns.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh3.12056](https://iadns.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsh3.12056)\n\n**Deep-frying impact on food and oil chemical composition: Strategies to reduce oil absorption in the final product**\n\n>The authors observed an increase in SFA content (from 13.6% to 21.6%) mainly of lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), and arachidic (C20:0). At the same time, there was a decrease in unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid (OA; C18:1), linoleic acid (LA; C18:2 n\u20133) and ALA from 80.8% to 71.2% from the first to the sixth cycle. Moreover, the TFA content progressively increased (from 1.1% to 6.5%) (Sohu et al., 2020). These studies indicate that repetitive frying deteriorates the oil's fatty acid profile toward a higher content of SFA and TFA to the detriment of MUFA and PUFA (Cui et al., 2017; Flores et al., 2018; Sohu et al., 2020).\n\n[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2024.2341903](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2024.2341903)\n\n**Common questions and misconceptions about protein supplementation: what does the scientific evidence really show?**\n\n>A follow-up study compared two different dietary protein intakes (i.e. 2.3 vs. 3.4\u2009g/kg/d) in resistance-trained males and females who underwent a traditional bodybuilding training program \\[Citation64\\]. Both groups experienced a similar increase in lean body mass; however, the higher-protein group (3.4\u2009g/kg/d) experienced a greater reduction in fat mass. Furthermore, in an 8-week crossover study in resistance-trained males \\[Citation28\\], a high-protein group consumed significantly more protein (3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009g/kg/day) and calories than the control group (2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u2009g/kg/day), yet there was no change in fat mass. These studies dispute the notion that excess energy from protein alone promotes gains in fat mass; however, diets high in fats and/or carbohydrates and low in protein tend to promote greater increases in fat mass as well as body mass \\[Citation66\u201370\\].\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916523188642](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916523188642)\n\n**Fat and carbohydrate overfeeding in humans: different effects on energy storage**\n\n>Carbohydrate overfeeding produced progressive increases in carbohydrate oxidation and total energy expenditure resulting in 75-85% of excess energy being stored. Alternatively, fat overfeeding had minimal effects on fat oxidation and total energy expenditure, leading to storage of 90-95% of excess energy. Excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate, and the difference was greatest early in the overfeeding period.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318831064\\_Conversion\\_of\\_Sugar\\_to\\_Fat\\_Is\\_Hepatic\\_de\\_Novo\\_Lipogenesis\\_Leading\\_to\\_Metabolic\\_Syndrome\\_and\\_Associated\\_Chronic\\_Diseases](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318831064_Conversion_of_Sugar_to_Fat_Is_Hepatic_de_Novo_Lipogenesis_Leading_to_Metabolic_Syndrome_and_Associated_Chronic_Diseases)\n\n**Conversion of Sugar to Fat: Is Hepatic de Novo Lipogenesis Leading to Metabolic Syndrome and Associated Chronic Diseases?**\n\n>Likewise, in the fed state, de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is also determined by the type of simple sugar consumed. Fructose, but not glucose, increased hepatic DNL in 6 healthy lean parti-cipants (Figure 3). During 6 hours of fructose inges-tion, DNL increased 20-fold, and 25% of circulating VLDL-TG was derived from DNL. In contrast, when the study was repeated in the same participants using glucose levels, rates of DNL were unaffected, and only 1% to 2% of VLDL-TG was synthesized de novo. These data dem-onstrate that fructose is a potent stimulus to lipogenesis.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1jx64ip/we_always_talk_about_weight_loss_but_what_really/", "created_utc": 1744421665.0, "score": 1, "author": "Heavy-Society-4984", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1jx64ip/we_always_talk_about_weight_loss_but_what_really/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Thoughts/Feedback?", "selftext": "So I F(22) live on my own with my sister F(16). I work fulltime, plus a small part time job on the weekends, and she of course is in school. I've been trying to come up with ways to add more veggies in meals without it being a whole lot of extra work, and so far the favorite has been a tomato-based sauce. I make a big batch of it every now and then and can it (I store it in the fridge, as I'm still not fully confident in it not spoiling). Essentially, the recipe is:\n\n* A few pounds of tomatoes. I think last time I did about ten pounds? It was 25 of those small tomatoes. \n* Three bell peppers\n* A whole small bag of carrots\n* A handful of mushrooms\n* About a half cup of red wine\n* One onion\n* Whatever seasoning I have on hand. I put in a small bit of salt and pepper, too, but I don't add sugar \u2014 mostly because I forget most people add sugar, and it's not the first thing I think of going in the sauce\n*A small can of tomato paste\n* A couple cloves of garlic, if I remember (amazing how often I forget this one)\n\nAbout 4 tomatoes are set aside, the rest are pureed with most of the carrots and two of the bell peppers. While I prep the tomatoes (peeling and squeezing the seeds out), I'll have the onion cooking in a little  bit of the butter,  as well as the mushrooms,  the remaining bell pepper, and about three or four chopped up carrots. Generally, by the time I'm finished blending everything, the onions are transparent, so I'll add the tomato/carrot/bell pepper mix in there, as well as the wine and seasoning, chop up the remaining four tomatoes and throw it in there, then let it simmer for about 2 hours, add the tomato paste, let it cook for another 2 - 3 hours. \n\nWhen I make spaghetti, a pound of ground beef or turkey is used, along with a standard box of spaghetti noodles. The only issue I have so far is that the sauce isn't all that thick, so I've been testing it with corn startch with mixed  results.  Anyways, I felt it was a pretty decent way to get veggies in there. Is there anything I'm missing, here? I try to do a bit of research on these things, but I always feel like I'm missing something.

{"title": "Cheap ways to eat more protein with sensory issues?", "selftext": "Hi, I'm going to try to keep this short (sorry if it ends up long, I struggle with over-explaining myself haha).\n\nBasically, I'm an 18 y/o girl and, like most girls my age, don't get much protien in at all. I'm autistic as well, so I struggle with a lot of sensory sensitivities around food. I can't stand most meats, legumes, and nuts. The only protein sources that I can actually stand (off the top of my head) is chicken breast, most fish, tofu, and almond milk.\n\nI don't currently have a job and my family is somewhat poor, so it's not exactly an option for me to ask for those foods regularly/buy them myself (my family eats quite unhealthy themselves). In the past I've had my (incredible and lovely, and financially well off) foster parents buy me protein powder and that's worked quite well for me, however I can't afford to buy it myself because it's like $60 for the smallest/cheapest ones in my local grocery stores. I'm sure if I asked my foster parents they would buy it for me again, but I feel awful asking them to help out with groceries, especially expensive things, despite them making it very clear that they're happy to help with whatever I need.\n\nI know I'm making it difficult, but is there any way I could get in more protien? I typically don't care about my nutrient intake because if I can't eat my safe foods/hyperfixation foods then I just won't eat at all for days on end. My motto is that eating the things I like despite their nutrition is better than not eating at all. I already have difficulty eating for that very reason as my family can't afford to buy the foods I like all the time/enough to sustain me, so I typically spend all my money on snacks.\n\nI love most vegetables and fruits if that helps at all. I don't track my nutrient intake (again because I already struggle with food so if I stress myself out about what I'm eating then I just won't eat at all) so I have no clue what my protein intake is actually like, but I know for a fact it's practically nonexistent. I don't work out at all outside of daily(ish) walks, so I usually couldn't care less about my protien intake, however I have a somewhat severe wound on my leg that is currently healing my my doctors have made it very clear that protien is super important for healing it.\n\nAny advice would help a ton, thanks!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/1j7u6s7/cheap_ways_to_eat_more_protein_with_sensory_issues/", "created_utc": 1741596392.0, "score": 3, "author": "SnakeBones-", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/1j7u6s7/cheap_ways_to_eat_more_protein_with_sensory_issues/", "html_title": ""}

Seed oils are everywhere, gluten is polluted with glyphosate, tea bags has billion of micro plastics on it, and so on\u2026 it\u2019s ridiculous. \nI\u2019m now underweight, I\u2019m going to the gym in vain-since I can\u2019t grow my muscles with so little food, I\u2019m always starving and feeling weak, my appetite is destroyed cause I\u2019m always eating the same things. I feel so limited and even stressed of all the supposed crap that is in our food. It\u2019s been more than a year feeling like this. Today I ate frozen French fries, and oh my god I felt so liberated for the first time in a long time\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude06 im thinking into going back to eating whatever I want- I was way more happy & looking more healthy back then. how can I get more inspired into healthy eating?
