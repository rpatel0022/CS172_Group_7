I have not flushed the sediment from my hot water heater since I bought the house in 2022, so today\u2019s the day. \nI turned off the power (it\u2019s electric - boogie-woogie-woogie), hooked up the hose, put the other end of the hose in the floor drain, turned off the cold water feed, opened the hot water faucet in the nearby utility sink. Once the sink ran cold, I opened the drain valve. It drained nicely. I saw a little discoloration, but nothing major Major. Once it was done draining, I got adventurous and decided to check the anode rod.\nI pried open the plastic cap and dug out the foam insulation with a screwdriver. Once I got down to the rod, I checked the fit of the 11/16\u201d socket it said to use in the manual. It wouldn\u2019t fit. I looked down in the hole, and saw it was definitely bigger than 11/16\u201d. I Googled, and it said many anodes are 1-1/16\u201d. So I went to Home Depot and bought a 1-1/16\u201d socket. It wasn\u2019t until I got home that I realized it wouldn\u2019t fit on my 3/8\u201d socket wrench. Back to Home Depot and bought a $30 1/2\u201d socket wrench. Got home and tried to turn the rod, but the socket wasn\u2019t quite long enough to get enough leverage to turn it. Decided the rod was probably fine. Put the cover back on and cracked a beer.

In the basement are the guts of the house (water heater etc) washer and dryer. I wouldn't do anything fancy.

I'm wondering if anyone here has ideas on how to do this, because I've searched the internet and can't seem to find what I'm looking for.

There are a million of these you can buy from home depot, costco, and a ton of other online retailers, and these would be great for the summer.\n\nHowever, I would love to be able to extend how much of the year we can be outside by being able to convert it into a sunroom as it starts to get cooler in the fall (or starts to barely warm up in the spring), by having big window panels that I could put up on all four walls and then have a space heater inside, etc. It wouldn't need to be fully sealed\u2014I don't expect to be able to use it in the dead of winter and still be warm in there\u2014but I would like to be able to use it on a chillier fall or spring day and be outdoors more often, without being boiled to death and having it be unusable when it's 100 degrees outside in the summer.\n\nThere are also lots of sunroooms available for purchase that can be assembled in just a day or two, but from what I can tell from my online research, they seem to be designed to not be taken apart once they're built\u2014everything is screwed together pretty permanently and it would be a multi-person, multi-day operation to remove the walls, and possibly would result in damage to the structure.\n\nIs there a product I'm missing, and/or something that we could cobble together?

The home was a rental so it wasn't maintained as well as it should have been.  The squirrels chewed some holes in the fascia boards in multiple places/eaves of the house to get inside.  **We set up a squirrel trap** with peanutbutter & birdseed bait (my grandpa swears by this combo) in the attic **but have not caught any squirrels** in the three years that we have tried to bait them to remove them.  **We do hear the squirrels sometimes** scurrying up there so we know they're still semi-active, but we can't seem to trap (or shoot) the darned things.  The areas where the holes are chewed through are impossible for us to reach in the attic so we don't have much visibility.\n\n  \nWe have a contractor coming to fix the holes in the fascia boards while he does some other work here and **we're wondering if we need to hire an exterminator first** to ensure all the squirrels/nest debris are out of the attic before they just chew another hole to try and get back inside.  The exterminators are wanting $200 just to come out - our contractor mentioned that they might just put more traps up there and considering we already have a trap up there that hasn't caught anything it may be pointless.\n\n  \nDoes anyone have experience with removing squirrels and making fascia repairs and if so, can you share about your experience?

{"title": "Asphalt to Concrete wall sealing", "selftext": "1). I rent. Major renovations are not possible. Lets just get that out of the way first.\n\nThere is an asphalt pad under and next to our deck in the back yard. It has sunk about 2\" and now the basement is leaking, just from beside the water spigot to the edge of the asphalt. The area was previously sealed by a company building a 45\\* angle of small rocks and sealing the resulting face with some kind of rubberized pavement/asphalt seal. The sinking has opened a crack that ranges from 1/4\" to over 1.5\" in the small rocks. I did my best to clear out the rocks/dirt/etc from this area and could see about 1.5\" of dirt between the house wall and the edge of the asphalt, about 2\" below the top of the asphalt. I could also see the edge of a plastic sheeting material, pulled away from the wall by at least 1\" with dirt on all sides. I stuffed some heat-activated asphalt sealant into the cracks and melted as directed. It appeared to work for the lighter rains (less than 1/2\" total) but when we then had a heavier ran (over an inch in about 12 hours) it leaked again. I suspect that the product did not actually fill all of the crack, this was my first time using anything like this.\n\nOn the INSIDE of the basement, it's semi-finished, with the only fully built out area being the closet that appears to be the location of the leak. The walls have thick stucco coating, so i can't see what the concrete looks like under them, there is a 2 foot or so area that has spalling of the stucco, so I know that some moisture is coming in there. At the floor level, I can't see the joint/bottom of the wall due to the combination of wood edging, 2x4 framing members and that d\\*mn stucco. I can tell that the water is coming in at the bottom, and being \"sucked\" along the 2x4s that frame the closet and laundry room into the rest of the basement, with a limited amount passing under the tiles in the laundry room to the drain. There is no french drain, sump pump, or other internal water directing system. \n\nI'm willing to put enough work into this to keep my stuff from being destroyed (already lost two particle board bookcases, but those things suck anyway), but I'm not going to do thousands in work, and the owner has already indicated that he is not in a position to fix anything right now (plus the deck is only 2 years old...he's not ripping it out to get the asphalt along the wall....). \n\nStandard items like fixing the downspouts (already directing away from the house, no blockages, etc) and ensuring the grade is right (despite the sinking in the asphalt, water still runs away from the wall if you poor it on the ground) have already been done.\n\nShould I dig out what I tried to fix the wall with, put in a new angled small rock connection point, and reseal with something similar to what was used previously? It lasted about 5 years before the leaking returned. Or do you have another suggestion for sealing such a small surface area? (pictures will be added this evening, I'm at work currently)\n\nIs it worth removing the stucco and painting the interior wall with waterproofing? \n\nShould I rip out the damn framing and edging so I can at least see the bottom of the wall/joint? \n\nOther notes: We have a dehumidifier that is always set up, usually it is 40-50% humidity and runs intermittently. I keep fans and a heavy duty vacuum handy for any water removal that might be needed, dry everything as fast as possible once leakage does occur, treat for mold after it's dry, etc. We have been here for about 9 years, and I would be fine with never moving, my spouse wants to find a new place in the next 2 years for reasons entirely unrelated to the quality of the rental (which is actually quite nice and reasonably priced). \n\nI'm only interested in the best DIY repairs for this crack and leakage, that won't cost thousands.

{"title": "Asphalt to Concrete wall sealing", "selftext": "1). I rent. Major renovations are not possible. Lets just get that out of the way first.\n\nThere is an asphalt pad under and next to our deck in the back yard. It has sunk about 2\" and now the basement is leaking, just from beside the water spigot to the edge of the asphalt. The area was previously sealed by a company building a 45\\* angle of small rocks and sealing the resulting face with some kind of rubberized pavement/asphalt seal. The sinking has opened a crack that ranges from 1/4\" to over 1.5\" in the small rocks. I did my best to clear out the rocks/dirt/etc from this area and could see about 1.5\" of dirt between the house wall and the edge of the asphalt, about 2\" below the top of the asphalt. I could also see the edge of a plastic sheeting material, pulled away from the wall by at least 1\" with dirt on all sides. I stuffed some heat-activated asphalt sealant into the cracks and melted as directed. It appeared to work for the lighter rains (less than 1/2\" total) but when we then had a heavier ran (over an inch in about 12 hours) it leaked again. I suspect that the product did not actually fill all of the crack, this was my first time using anything like this.\n\nOn the INSIDE of the basement, it's semi-finished, with the only fully built out area being the closet that appears to be the location of the leak. The walls have thick stucco coating, so i can't see what the concrete looks like under them, there is a 2 foot or so area that has spalling of the stucco, so I know that some moisture is coming in there. At the floor level, I can't see the joint/bottom of the wall due to the combination of wood edging, 2x4 framing members and that d\\*mn stucco. I can tell that the water is coming in at the bottom, and being \"sucked\" along the 2x4s that frame the closet and laundry room into the rest of the basement, with a limited amount passing under the tiles in the laundry room to the drain. There is no french drain, sump pump, or other internal water directing system. \n\nI'm willing to put enough work into this to keep my stuff from being destroyed (already lost two particle board bookcases, but those things suck anyway), but I'm not going to do thousands in work, and the owner has already indicated that he is not in a position to fix anything right now (plus the deck is only 2 years old...he's not ripping it out to get the asphalt along the wall....). \n\nStandard items like fixing the downspouts (already directing away from the house, no blockages, etc) and ensuring the grade is right (despite the sinking in the asphalt, water still runs away from the wall if you poor it on the ground) have already been done.\n\nShould I dig out what I tried to fix the wall with, put in a new angled small rock connection point, and reseal with something similar to what was used previously? It lasted about 5 years before the leaking returned. Or do you have another suggestion for sealing such a small surface area? (pictures will be added this evening, I'm at work currently)\n\nIs it worth removing the stucco and painting the interior wall with waterproofing? \n\nShould I rip out the damn framing and edging so I can at least see the bottom of the wall/joint? \n\nOther notes: We have a dehumidifier that is always set up, usually it is 40-50% humidity and runs intermittently.

{"title": "Need help with ground level deck and drainage", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been neglecting my backyard for long enough. The stones have been slowly sinking more and more each year. The water pools in the center. So I was thinking of popping up a few and grading it slope away from the house. But once I really took a good look I realized I\u2019d probably end up removing and regarding most of them.\n\nSo I decided to do a ground level wood deck instead and raise the height to about 6 inches and make it level with the step I have there. Those vents are for the crawl space which has been completely encapsulated since I moved in anyway so I\u2019m not worried about covering that up.\n\nI want to remove all the stones and reuse them as a fire pit further back in the property. My yard slopes toward my house so I\u2019m concerned about proper water drainage.\n\nI just want to know the proper steps. Remove stones, compact dirt and gravel on top of that? Any specific type of gravel? Obviously make sure it\u2019s pitched away from the house. Since my yard is on a slope what should I do about where the deck would meet the yard? I can dig it level and make a small retaining wall to help keep the dirt from blowing onto the deck which is what happens now. Or I can just surround the perimeter of the deck with gravel instead.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best footing I should use?\n\nI\u2019m obviously not a pro. I can figure out the actual build of the deck with enough research. My specific situation with the yard grading toward the deck is why I\u2019m here.

We are DIY'ing renovations to our garage, which was damaged during the last hurricane. This home was built in 1949 and is wood-framed. The garage seemed to have been added after the house was built but not sure at which point.\n\nMy dad has been in construction for years, and knows a lot about electrical work and structural work but does not know much about the permit process.  \nWe are doing the permit application ourselves and it is very confusing. We were told but the city department that we need to submit a building permit application.   \nI tried doing that and figured out that before we do that we need to get a site plan review application approved first. I started the application and saw that we need to submit a \"building plan\".  \nIf this is a sitemap review why are we submitting a building plan already? I have drawn up the site map and floor plan already.\n\nWhat else do I need to include in this \"Building Plan\"? So confused. \n\nRefer to the project description used in the application.\n\n***The scope of work involves the partial structural renovation and partial reconstruction of an attached residential garage located on a single-family residential property. This renovation is necessary due to significant water intrusion and deterioration of two existing wood-framed exterior walls, caused by damage sustained during Hurricane Helene. The proposed work includes the demolition and replacement of the north-facing and east-facing exterior wood-framed walls with 8-inch concrete masonry unit (CMU) block walls. The east wall will be extended laterally by 8 inches, and both walls will be extended vertically by 9 inches to align with the updated roof elevation and structural design. As part of the wall expansion, the existing concrete slab foundation will be cut, filled, and leveled to accommodate the additional 8-inch extension of the garage footprint along the east side. This will ensure a continuous and structurally sound surface consistent with the new wall layout. The project includes the demolition of an existing wood-framed shed structure currently attached to the exterior of the north wall. Following its removal, a new exterior pedestrian door will be installed in the same location to maintain access. Additionally, the garage door opening will be enlarged to 9 feet wide to accommodate the installation of a new 9-foot overhead sectional garage door that meets current wind load and clearance requirements. A new window unit will also be installed on the east CMU wall to provide natural light and ventilation. The scope further includes re-roofing of the garage structure, with framing modifications as needed, and upgrades to the electrical system within the garage. This will involve removal and replacement of the existing electrical load center (main panel), which is located on the interior side of the exterior walls undergoing renovation.***", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfbjot/help_diy_building_permit_process_in_tampa/", "created_utc": 1746451492.0, "score": 1, "author": "Budget-Sea-386", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfbjot/help_diy_building_permit_process_in_tampa/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The driveway leading to that is asphalt and while not pretty, it's not the problem - the problem is the section that was added later, which runs to a separate house on the plot, but which is surfaced with 3/4 and topcoat crusher run. That section gets rutted/channeled out during very heavy rains (it's fine in light rain but usually once a year or 2 we see heavy flash floods that rut it).\n\nThe solution through the years has been to simply regravel and pack it and wait till next time.\n\nTo complicate matters, there's a subdivision uphill whose runoff seems to either pool up, or maybe even has an outflow uphill of this driveway section, and comes out of this sort of berm.\n\nThe berm also unfortunately makes an indirect path for the stormwater runoff where it doesn't go the most direct path and instead will slowly carve out channels along the side of the gravel too.\n\nBelow the gravel layers, there looks to be old asphalt and concrete, and possibly brick substrate.\n\nWe just had a major rain, and it's rutted to hell now.\n\nMy question is...would it be conceivable to simply regrade the gravel, sloping it from a high point on the inside of the turn and down to where the berm meets the driveway-- likely installing a retaining wall and/or drainage channel/ditch there to collect the runoff and channel it to that runoff basin. And then can I lay concrete on top of the gravel, as though it was normal gravel substrate?\n\nI get the concern on if the underlying old concrete and asphalt is prone to movement/upheaval but I've seen no indication of that being the case, and I think it was just not a great driveway and has had years of piled on temporary gravel solutions and I'm looking for something more lasting.\n\nHere's an album of the situation.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/egAwrEA", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kf1lu8/is_this_the_right_place_to_ask_about/", "created_utc": 1746414145.0, "score": 3, "author": "GermanBeerYum", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kf1lu8/is_this_the_right_place_to_ask_about/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "What\u2019s Wrong with this Shower Valve?", "selftext": "This is a shared house in an area where it\u2019s hard to find good contractors. Last fall we had an issue where water was visible in a downstairs room. We called a plumber who traced it to this upstairs shower valve. The shower is a single fiberglass moulded unit (the back can be seen in all the pictures). The plumber accessed the valve by opening the sheetrock in an adjoining closet and installing an access panel - that\u2019s where I\u2019m looking from now. I turned on the water to the house and discovered water spraying around the valve and trim. I have to replace the shower cartridge (plastic component broke through wear and tear) and when disassembling the unit realized the entire thing was just hanging loosely without a single point of anchor (possibly contributing to the cartridge breaking as it took all the force of many uses).\n\nThere\u2019s a stud visible in the first pic but it\u2019s too far to the right from the valve. On the left there\u2019s about 28\u201d to the corner stud and what looks like cement board. There is no waterproofing elements on the wall I am looking through. That\u2019s 1/2\u201d pex running to the valve and from the valve to the shower head. There are no emergency shutoffs on any of the lines (why didn\u2019t the plumber add them). There\u2019s no faucets - this is a standing shower unit - which likely explains why the tub drop is sealed off (so wrong valve then). I believe it\u2019s a Delta R10000-PFT-MF.\n\nThis looks like a total shit show and one that the plumber who repaired the leak should have identified. That said, I need to get this operational and turn on the water to the whole house. In the short-term: install the new valve cartridge and put the trim back in place. In the long-term: do I open the wall up more and add some bracing between the studs and blocking so we can securely mount the existing or replacement valve? While we\u2019re at it, severe the pex, add shutoffs, and reconnect? Is running pex into the valve and from valve to shower head legit or prime for another failure? I\u2019d call a plumber but there\u2019s not one for a hundred miles except for the lunatic who left this mess. This is likely going to be a DIY job between me and a brother-in-law. We\u2019re both handy but \u2026 water!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oFGmY84\n\nBTW the dampness that is visible is caused by water spray from the leaky cartridge that needs to be replaced.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1keyly6/whats_wrong_with_this_shower_valve/", "created_utc": 1746404526.0, "score": 2, "author": "LightsOnSomebodyHome", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1keyly6/whats_wrong_with_this_shower_valve/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Not sure if that\u2019s just morning dew staining or something else. \n\nAlso, at this stage should I just rip and replace the siding on the entire house or get some more years of life? I have a company lined up to replace the siding in the first 2 photos once the remediation is done. Insurance is covering drywall, paint, and insulation costs I\u2019m responsible for everything else. \n\nAnother photo of another side of my house that has some cracked siding from the install in 2004 when the house was built here https://imgur.com/a/MNDaceJ\n\nThese photos are in what seems to be a less affected area of the attic. My inspector has suggested repainting this year and having the paint recaulk the joints and get a bit more life out of them. \n\nI imagine if I do siding, painting, and remediation I\u2019m probably looking at 100k \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m estimating the mold remediation between $5000 and $10000 alone. Siding probably 50k, and painting 15k. House is 2200 square feet. \n\nTime for a HELOC I guess. \n\nI\u2019m in PNW.  \n\nThis comes at a really crappy time in life as I was just diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, someone rear ended my car in March, I have diagnosed autism and I just started a new job so I\u2019m super anxiety ridden and stressed since DYI would be impossible \ud83d\ude23 I\u2019m a walking wreck apparently lol. Life seems to be throwing one thing after another at me and I can\u2019t catch a break I haven\u2019t even told you everything else that\u2019s happening\n\nEdit: also, mold remediation company said they checked soffits and they were all clear. They said bathroom vents are also connected properly. \n\nEdit 2: also if anyone knows anyone in Washington who does good work at a reasonable price let me know in PMs. ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1ketjng/siding_question/", "created_utc": 1746390464.0, "score": 1, "author": "sonofalando", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1ketjng/siding_question/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Water damage from hidden pipe leak \u2014 first-time homeowner looking for advice on insurance, repair costs, and next steps", "selftext": "\nHi all,\n\nI\u2019m a first-time homeowner and recently ran into a major issue. After using a backyard hose (that we rarely use) to water plants for about 10 minutes, we discovered water all over our living room floor. A few days earlier, we used the hose for 30 minutes with no visible problems.\n\nThe leak only happens when the backyard hose is running, which leads us to believe it\u2019s coming from the pipe or joint connected to that outdoor spigot.\n\nWe called a local plumbing and water damage company, and here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned so far:\n\n- The plumber suspects the leak is inside the drywall, likely from a pipe joint connected to the outdoor hose bib. It only leaks when the hose is in use.\n\n- He quoted ~$900 to open the drywall and fix the plumbing, but he won\u2019t patch or restore the drywall afterward.\n\n- The water damage inspector used moisture sensors and confirmed the drywall is soaked and there\u2019s trapped water under our vinyl flooring. He also said the crawl space might be impacted.\n\n- Mitigation alone (drying, cleanup, etc.) is estimated at $5K\u2013$10K.\n\n- Full repairs (plumbing + mitigation + restoration) could run $10K to $50K, depending on how much hidden damage is uncovered.\n\n- They said accurate restoration quotes aren\u2019t possible until walls and floors are opened up.\n\n- The inspector mentioned this might qualify under homeowners insurance, since it was sudden and accidental, but I should file a claim within a week of the incident.\n\nAdditional context:\n\n- This is a Toll Brothers home built 3 years ago, and the 1-year builder warranty has expired. Still, I reached out to the builder to check for any extended coverage or goodwill options, especially since this particular hose bib has been rarely used.\n\n- We\u2019re expecting a new baby within a week, so DIY isn\u2019t an option for us. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to get this resolved quickly and responsibly \u2014 but without overspending unnecessarily.\n\n\nHere\u2019s where I need advice:\n\n1) Should I file an insurance claim now, or wait?\n\n- I\u2019ve already contacted the plumber and water damage inspector on my own (not through insurance). Will insurance still accept their reports, or should I have called insurance first to send their own vendors?\n\n- If I file a claim now, will insurance send their own adjuster before approving any work?\n\n2) Will filing a homeowners insurance claim hurt me later?\n\n- I\u2019ve read mixed things online \u2014 some people say it could make selling the home harder, or raise premiums. Should I be concerned?\n\n3) Are the quoted costs reasonable?\n\n- $900 for plumbing\n\n- $5K\u2013$10K for water mitigation\n\n- $10K\u2013$50K total for everything depending on what\u2019s uncovered (like plumbing, water mitigation, and restoration)\n\n4) Can I break this into phases to reduce upfront cost?\n\n- For example: fix the leak first, then dry things out, and do cosmetic restoration later when we can afford it.\n\n- Or will delaying anything (besides the leak fix) risk mold or make insurance less likely to cover it?\n\n5) Anything else I should know as a first-time homeowner dealing with this?\n\n- I want to avoid rookie mistakes \u2014 especially when dealing with insurance or contractors.\n\nAny advice or insights from people who\u2019ve been through this would be hugely appreciated.

Inspector said nothing to worry about and was just cosmetic and the drywall could be cut-out and replaced. However it has gotten progressively worse over the last several months and there is now similar pattern on the opposite wall.\n\nBecause of this I have started to wonder if there is a bigger issue like with the foundation of the house. This led me to take a look at the foundation under the location of this drywall \"buckling\", and have concerns with what I am seeing (again not raised or mentioned on home inspection):\n\n1. foundation in this area is uneven, with noticeable small lumps & bulges if you were to run your hand up and down.\n2. there are several horizontal / \"stair\" cracks present.\n3.

It\u2019s a 400ish year old granary building converted to flats, so structurally has stone walls. If it\u2019s of any help, I\u2019m in Scotland.\n\nWhen they converted it back I think roughly 50 years ago, they put board on studs on the interior walls, I guess for dual purpose of giving a smooth finish, and probably helping a bit with damp.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole range of things I\u2019d like to mount to the walls, from lighter objects like my skis, to heavier things like bikes and a TV on an arm.\n\nPoking around and testing with magnets I can find the studs. Fairly typical spacing. Pushing a rod into an existing hole in the wall, it seems like the board is about 1cm thick, but the distance until I hit anything solid ranges from around 4cm (including board thickness) up to nearly 30cm.\n\nWhat\u2019s the reason for such a large gap, and can anything useful be done with it? The flat doesn\u2019t have the best energy rating, so if that gap could be used for insulation at all, that would be great. The thing I worry about though is mounting heavier things to such walls. Is there any way of judging how strong it might be?\n\nI\u2019m assuming where there\u2019s a larger gap I just want to make sure I\u2019m mounting to the studs, but what about smaller gaps.

We truly had no knowledge of this kind of siding when we bought it and nothing was said to us during the sale as it was a foreclosure. When we started renovations, one of the things we did was put a window in the bathroom which meant we had to saw an opening in the asbestos siding for the window. My father in law was outside on the ladder with the saw as my husband was standing in the bathroom cleaning up anything that fell inside \ud83d\ude14\n\nMy kids and myself weren't there during this but came down later that day to see how it looked with the window put in. Again, we did NOT know the dangers. Actually, I only learned the dangers from this type of siding from an old house fb group after the fact!! We weren't living here at the time as the whole house needed renovated before moving in but I'm terrified we are doomed and are going to get mesothelioma. We're a young couple with young kids. I usually research everything when we are doing any kind of project. How did I not research the siding?! \ud83d\ude29 I'm losing sleep over this and stressed beyond belief over our stupidity even though what's done is done. \n\nAnother project we did was bust out old, cracked plaster walls down to the studs and added new drywall which I now know could have had asbestos in as well given the age of the home (1900). So 2 accidental exposures that I'm aware of! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI HATE this home that we worked so hard on now! I regret buying it and feel so guilty ESPECIALLY having children living here! I worry there could still be asbestos in the air inside our home even though our house is completely finished inside. I'm scared to even work on the outside which is due for a painting because of this stupid toxic siding!! Not to mention there's a few cracks that need repared/caulked which are probably just blowing asbestos particles everywhere at the moment! \ud83e\udd2c ughhhh! Please, someone give me some (kind) advice. I'd even take some horror stories of your own if you ever did something as dumb as us \ud83d\ude25 I'm scared for our health especially my kids..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kdyhc1/asbestos_help/", "created_utc": 1746293810.0, "score": 0, "author": "lpod86", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kdyhc1/asbestos_help/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Siding Panel Rot\u2026", "selftext": "I noticed a small hole in the bottom of this 4x8 siding panel last night and realized that much of the bottom few inches above the \u201cL\u201d lip has swollen and rotted. It seems like the most damaged area was under a window which also had some cracking in the sill, so I assume moisture was getting in at the sill, traveling down the inside of the siding panel, and getting trapped on the L bracket which is pretty rusted and was caulked to the bottom of the siding board. Behind the panel is just a foam insulated panel with no waterproof membrane (at least in the section I uncovered). The windows were replaced in the early ~2000s and the siding is original from the 80\u2019s.\n\nI realize after some research that there should be an air gap at the bottom of the siding, and there should be a \u201cZ\u201d channel and a membrane behind the wall. \n\nMy plan was to cut out the bottom ~6\u201d inches of siding/trim, seal between the top of the L bracket and the foam board to prevent moisture getting behind it, and to add a new horizontal trim piece across the entire front section with a 1/2 gap between thee board and the L bracket. \n\nIs that a good plan?

I made up a rough plan showing the drainage lines in red and possible catch basins as the red circles, gray area is a proposed patio [Image link](https://imgur.com/a/1FvBb0P)\n\n1.

I am in an area that has freezing temperatures in the winter and the plan left piping will be going below a brick patio. My plan was to get a PVC cleanout wye where the downspout meets the piping, then some 90 degree elbows, but using corrugated would eliminate that need?  \n2. At the end of the piping should I use two catch basins, one for each side, something like [this](https://www.homedepot.com/p/NDS-24-in-x-24-in-x-29-in-50-Gal-Plastic-Flo-Well-Stormwater-Dry-Well-System-Catch-Basin-Kit-3-Side-Panels-and-1-Cover-FWAS24/100377387) shown as the red circles in the plan or would you just let it drain into the ground or possibly some washed stone. I'm assuming it would need some void to hold the water? I have seen those pop up drains but they would just flood the yard/grass then? Also, would a stormtech or cultec be overkill for this size? The downpouts serve the back of the house and is about 1,100 SF of asphalt shingles.\n3.

{"title": "Asbestos!!", "selftext": "Please help!!! I'm worried sick and losing sleep!\n\nWe bought a home with asbestos siding a couple years ago (Ohio, USA). We truly had no knowledge of this kind of siding when we bought it and nothing was said to us during the sale as it was a foreclosure. When we started renovations, one of the things we did was put a window in the bathroom which meant we had to saw an opening in the asbestos siding for the window. My father in law was outside on the ladder with the saw as my husband was standing in the bathroom cleaning up anything that fell inside \ud83d\ude14\n\nMy kids and myself weren't there during this but came down later that day to see how it looked with the window put in. Again, we did NOT know the dangers. Actually, I only learned the dangers from this type of siding from an old house fb group after the fact!! We weren't living here at the time as the whole house needed renovated before moving in but I'm terrified we are doomed and are going to get mesothelioma. We're a young couple with young kids. I usually research everything when we are doing any kind of project. How did I not research the siding?! \ud83d\ude29 I'm losing sleep over this and stressed beyond belief over our stupidity even though what's done is done. \n\nAnother project we did was bust out old, cracked plaster walls down to the studs and added new drywall which I now know could have had asbestos in as well given the age of the home (1900). So 2 accidental exposures that I'm aware of! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI HATE this home that we worked so hard on now! I regret buying it and feel so guilty ESPECIALLY having children living here! I worry there could still be asbestos in the air inside our home even though our house is completely finished inside. I'm scared to even work on the outside which is due for a painting because of this stupid toxic siding!! Not to mention there's a few cracks that need repared/caulked which are probably just blowing asbestos particles everywhere at the moment! \ud83e\udd2c ughhhh!

The areas where the holes are chewed through are impossible for us to reach in the attic so we don't have much visibility.\n\n  \nWe have a contractor coming to fix the holes in the fascia boards while he does some other work here and **we're wondering if we need to hire an exterminator first** to ensure all the squirrels/nest debris are out of the attic before they just chew another hole to try and get back inside.  The exterminators are wanting $200 just to come out - our contractor mentioned that they might just put more traps up there and considering we already have a trap up there that hasn't caught anything it may be pointless.\n\n  \nDoes anyone have experience with removing squirrels and making fascia repairs and if so, can you share about your experience?  Did you use an exterminator, was it worth it?\n\n  \nAlternative ideas that have come up in conversation with family/friends:\n\n* Someone suggested offering the bait somewhere away from the house to see if they'll just be content with that - we haven't tried the trap outside in the yard so we might try that and see what happens.  We have a new birdfeeder so maybe we'll leverage that.\n* Our in-laws' cat (used to be our cat) is a good mouser and sometimes they stick him up in their own attic for an hour or two about every month to see if he'll catch any mice.  He's caught at least 1 mouse every single time he's been up there, so we wonder if he could scout out any squirrel activity in our own attic.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfiaof/do_i_need_an_exterminator_if_i_havent_caught_any/", "created_utc": 1746468040.0, "score": 1, "author": "StatueofLiterby", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfiaof/do_i_need_an_exterminator_if_i_havent_caught_any/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Asphalt to Concrete wall sealing", "selftext": "1). I rent. Major renovations are not possible. Lets just get that out of the way first.\n\nThere is an asphalt pad under and next to our deck in the back yard. It has sunk about 2\" and now the basement is leaking, just from beside the water spigot to the edge of the asphalt. The area was previously sealed by a company building a 45\\* angle of small rocks and sealing the resulting face with some kind of rubberized pavement/asphalt seal. The sinking has opened a crack that ranges from 1/4\" to over 1.5\" in the small rocks. I did my best to clear out the rocks/dirt/etc from this area and could see about 1.5\" of dirt between the house wall and the edge of the asphalt, about 2\" below the top of the asphalt. I could also see the edge of a plastic sheeting material, pulled away from the wall by at least 1\" with dirt on all sides. I stuffed some heat-activated asphalt sealant into the cracks and melted as directed. It appeared to work for the lighter rains (less than 1/2\" total) but when we then had a heavier ran (over an inch in about 12 hours) it leaked again. I suspect that the product did not actually fill all of the crack, this was my first time using anything like this.\n\nOn the INSIDE of the basement, it's semi-finished, with the only fully built out area being the closet that appears to be the location of the leak. The walls have thick stucco coating, so i can't see what the concrete looks like under them, there is a 2 foot or so area that has spalling of the stucco, so I know that some moisture is coming in there. At the floor level, I can't see the joint/bottom of the wall due to the combination of wood edging, 2x4 framing members and that d\\*mn stucco. I can tell that the water is coming in at the bottom, and being \"sucked\" along the 2x4s that frame the closet and laundry room into the rest of the basement, with a limited amount passing under the tiles in the laundry room to the drain. There is no french drain, sump pump, or other internal water directing system. \n\nI'm willing to put enough work into this to keep my stuff from being destroyed (already lost two particle board bookcases, but those things suck anyway), but I'm not going to do thousands in work, and the owner has already indicated that he is not in a position to fix anything right now (plus the deck is only 2 years old...he's not ripping it out to get the asphalt along the wall....). \n\nStandard items like fixing the downspouts (already directing away from the house, no blockages, etc) and ensuring the grade is right (despite the sinking in the asphalt, water still runs away from the wall if you poor it on the ground) have already been done.\n\nShould I dig out what I tried to fix the wall with, put in a new angled small rock connection point, and reseal with something similar to what was used previously? It lasted about 5 years before the leaking returned. Or do you have another suggestion for sealing such a small surface area? (pictures will be added this evening, I'm at work currently)\n\nIs it worth removing the stucco and painting the interior wall with waterproofing? \n\nShould I rip out the damn framing and edging so I can at least see the bottom of the wall/joint? \n\nOther notes: We have a dehumidifier that is always set up, usually it is 40-50% humidity and runs intermittently. I keep fans and a heavy duty vacuum handy for any water removal that might be needed, dry everything as fast as possible once leakage does occur, treat for mold after it's dry, etc. We have been here for about 9 years, and I would be fine with never moving, my spouse wants to find a new place in the next 2 years for reasons entirely unrelated to the quality of the rental (which is actually quite nice and reasonably priced). \n\nI'm only interested in the best DIY repairs for this crack and leakage, that won't cost thousands.

As part of the wall expansion, the existing concrete slab foundation will be cut, filled, and leveled to accommodate the additional 8-inch extension of the garage footprint along the east side. This will ensure a continuous and structurally sound surface consistent with the new wall layout. The project includes the demolition of an existing wood-framed shed structure currently attached to the exterior of the north wall. Following its removal, a new exterior pedestrian door will be installed in the same location to maintain access. Additionally, the garage door opening will be enlarged to 9 feet wide to accommodate the installation of a new 9-foot overhead sectional garage door that meets current wind load and clearance requirements. A new window unit will also be installed on the east CMU wall to provide natural light and ventilation. The scope further includes re-roofing of the garage structure, with framing modifications as needed, and upgrades to the electrical system within the garage. This will involve removal and replacement of the existing electrical load center (main panel), which is located on the interior side of the exterior walls undergoing renovation.***", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfbjot/help_diy_building_permit_process_in_tampa/", "created_utc": 1746451492.0, "score": 1, "author": "Budget-Sea-386", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfbjot/help_diy_building_permit_process_in_tampa/", "html_title": ""}

The driveway leading to that is asphalt and while not pretty, it's not the problem - the problem is the section that was added later, which runs to a separate house on the plot, but which is surfaced with 3/4 and topcoat crusher run. That section gets rutted/channeled out during very heavy rains (it's fine in light rain but usually once a year or 2 we see heavy flash floods that rut it).\n\nThe solution through the years has been to simply regravel and pack it and wait till next time.\n\nTo complicate matters, there's a subdivision uphill whose runoff seems to either pool up, or maybe even has an outflow uphill of this driveway section, and comes out of this sort of berm.\n\nThe berm also unfortunately makes an indirect path for the stormwater runoff where it doesn't go the most direct path and instead will slowly carve out channels along the side of the gravel too.\n\nBelow the gravel layers, there looks to be old asphalt and concrete, and possibly brick substrate.\n\nWe just had a major rain, and it's rutted to hell now.\n\nMy question is...would it be conceivable to simply regrade the gravel, sloping it from a high point on the inside of the turn and down to where the berm meets the driveway-- likely installing a retaining wall and/or drainage channel/ditch there to collect the runoff and channel it to that runoff basin. And then can I lay concrete on top of the gravel, as though it was normal gravel substrate?\n\nI get the concern on if the underlying old concrete and asphalt is prone to movement/upheaval but I've seen no indication of that being the case, and I think it was just not a great driveway and has had years of piled on temporary gravel solutions and I'm looking for something more lasting.\n\nHere's an album of the situation.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/egAwrEA", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kf1lu8/is_this_the_right_place_to_ask_about/", "created_utc": 1746414145.0, "score": 3, "author": "GermanBeerYum", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kf1lu8/is_this_the_right_place_to_ask_about/", "html_title": ""}

Last fall we had an issue where water was visible in a downstairs room. We called a plumber who traced it to this upstairs shower valve. The shower is a single fiberglass moulded unit (the back can be seen in all the pictures). The plumber accessed the valve by opening the sheetrock in an adjoining closet and installing an access panel - that\u2019s where I\u2019m looking from now. I turned on the water to the house and discovered water spraying around the valve and trim. I have to replace the shower cartridge (plastic component broke through wear and tear) and when disassembling the unit realized the entire thing was just hanging loosely without a single point of anchor (possibly contributing to the cartridge breaking as it took all the force of many uses).\n\nThere\u2019s a stud visible in the first pic but it\u2019s too far to the right from the valve. On the left there\u2019s about 28\u201d to the corner stud and what looks like cement board. There is no waterproofing elements on the wall I am looking through. That\u2019s 1/2\u201d pex running to the valve and from the valve to the shower head. There are no emergency shutoffs on any of the lines (why didn\u2019t the plumber add them). There\u2019s no faucets - this is a standing shower unit - which likely explains why the tub drop is sealed off (so wrong valve then). I believe it\u2019s a Delta R10000-PFT-MF.\n\nThis looks like a total shit show and one that the plumber who repaired the leak should have identified. That said, I need to get this operational and turn on the water to the whole house. In the short-term: install the new valve cartridge and put the trim back in place. In the long-term: do I open the wall up more and add some bracing between the studs and blocking so we can securely mount the existing or replacement valve? While we\u2019re at it, severe the pex, add shutoffs, and reconnect? Is running pex into the valve and from valve to shower head legit or prime for another failure?
