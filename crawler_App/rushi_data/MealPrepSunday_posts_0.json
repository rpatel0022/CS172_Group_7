I decided to be efficient and blend the cashew cream needed for both this + the below soup recipe together\u2026and then proceeded to pour the entirety of the cream into the butter chicken, i.e. double what I needed. So, whoops.\n\nHad to add a bunch more salt, some more spices, another tablespoon of tomato paste as well as half a cup of tomato sauce, and the rest of the can of chickpeas in, before reducing it for a while via saute setting on my IP to get it back to roughly into the same shape it was before\u2026 I was just kinda tired and juggling too many things at once, so it was inevitable things would go wrong.\n\nStill really like it, at least and I left it overnight in the fridge to give it a better chance of the flavours developing before I freeze it.\n\nFinally, [lasagna soup]( https://elavegan.com/vegan-lasagna-soup/). I left out the lasagna sheets and will break them up & pop them in when reheating the soup on the stove. I added a pretty big handful of Violife mozzarella to make it extra creamy & gooey & cheesy, and what a good choice. Really delicious, will be especially great with some defrosted focaccia I have from a while back, I reckon.\n\nNot pictured is the absolutely huge jar (2+ cups worth) of cashew cream I ended up with because in rectifying my butter \u201cchicken\u201d mistake, I then decided to blend up a bunch and lost my mind somewhat. I have no plans for the cream rn, so will have to look into what to make with that.\n\nThis was all yesterday. Today, I might take a rest day, but it'll depend on how wisely I use my time before I need to head out this evening. If nothing else, today will be a pre-prep day for stuff I want to get done tomorrow.

[Day 1 is here](https://old.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1k5rdni/day_1_of_my_meal_prep_marathon/).\n\nIn the muffin tin + baggie is [congee](https://evergreenkitchen.ca/vegan-congee/)! I\u2019m a pretty dedicated basmati person, but went with jasmine here and wow how much quicker and better it breaks down! I usually put red lentils into my congee for extra protein and to bulk it up, but fully forgot this time so\u2026 Whoops! Anyway, I\u2019m boring, so my usual topping is either chopped scallions or (store bought) fried onions, with crispy chilli crisp.\n\nI was gonna make the congee in my Instant Pot, but I didn\u2019t realise how much this recipe made when planning + I only have a mini IP. Making it on the stove messed up my timing & planning for the day a bit, esp. after this boiled over and I had to clean my stove mid-way through.\n\nSo, after the congee was done and my big pot was free again, I got on with [aubergine curry](https://old.reddit.com/r/MeatlessMealPrep/comments/gv88uj/eggplant_curry_in_coconut_milk_with_recipe/) from a recipe I found on Reddit a while back! It's in the two tupperware here, each holds about 2 servings. Unfortunately, I started meal prepping at around 5pmish, so by the time this was finished, it was almost 10pm and I was sort of sick of cooking and have no idea how it turned out. Does anyone else get that, where food just becomes unappealing after lots of cooking and you can\u2019t really taste it properly?? I will have to assess properly when I defrost it, I guess! It def didn\u2019t come out as beautifully rich-coloured as the photo in the recipe, but ain\u2019t that always the way.\n\nBecause my instant pot was now free for the day, I made an [Ethiopian lentil stew](https://www.cookwithmanali.com/instant-pot-ethiopian-lentil-stew/), which is in the ziplock bags in the pic. This was SO delicious, holy crap, and so so unctuous. Shoutout to the woman on my local Buy Nothing FB group who gave me a baggie of berbere spice so I could make this without buying yet another jar of spices. I\u2019ll likely will pair it with a citrusy couscous as a nice contrast.\n\nThe kebabs are my mum\u2019s speciality, though mine are made with Beyond mince instead of lamb ;) No recipe, seasoned from the heart. Mostly allspice, cumin, turmeric, ground coriander, paprika and salt. I added a tiny pinch of mint too. Then mixed in parsley & red onion. I have never gotten them to taste this good before?? It was actually perfect.\n\nI didn\u2019t cook the kebabs before freezing. They can go straight from frozen into the air fryer, paired with either rice + salad, or even just fries.\n\nIn the 4 little jars are pre-made mix for [my favourite mug cake recipe](https://www.noracooks.com/vegan-mug-cake/).

{"title": "Day 1 of my Meal Prep Marathon", "selftext": "I am starting a new job in a couple of weeks after a very long period of unemployment, so I think it\u2019s going to absolutely flatten me for the first month or so. As such, I decided to do a mini Meal Prep Marathon (w/ a couple break days) to make life easier for myself and reduce the amount of decision fatigue I\u2019ll run up against\u2014especially for lunch, which is my least favourite meal of the day to think about.\n\nI have tried to plan each day where different appliances & parts of my kitchen are utilised intelligently. i.e. today I did one Instant Pot meal, 2 oven meals at the same temp, 2 food processor \u201cmeals\u201d (rinsing between each without a full clean), and then using the processor to then prep for tomorrow so I can now put that away and not get it dirty again later. I don\u2019t have a dishwasher, so I also just want to minimise washing up as much as possible. Having said that, please don\u2019t ask me about what my sink looks like right now.\n\n**DAY 1**\n\nI used this [pizza dough recipe](https://sugarspunrun.com/the-best-pizza-dough-recipe/) & doubled it to make into [Costco chicken bake dupes](https://www.thekitchn.com/copycat-costco-chicken-bake-258344#post-recipe-12692), but veganised. I planned for homemade seitan but couldn\u2019t be bothered to add another thing to my plate in the end, so instead, I used Gardein \u201cchicken\u201d strips and a shop-bought Caesar dressing. There\u2019s Violife\u2019s smoked provolone on the inside (since it\u2019s quite melty) and Violife mozzarella on the top. Violife is my fave brand for cheese, hands down. Two of these came out too brown because I\u2019m still working out the oven in my new place.\n\nThey are waaay bigger than I expected when planning, and a little softer. I like the concept though, and may make mini versions of these in the future if I end up liking them.\n\nNote: I have never even been in a Costco, much less had one of these bakes, so I have no idea of accuracy.\n\nI doubled this [Instant Pot quinoa recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/instant-pot-quinoa-fluffy-perfect-no-soaking/) to switch up from rice occasionally. Cooked with Better than Bouillon No-Chicken stock. Still a tiny bit bitter, but much less than I\u2019ve had with quinoa in the past. I froze one baggie with 2-cups worth, the rest 1-cup.\n\n[Creamy curried lentil casserole](https://www.veganricha.com/lentil-curry-casserole/) chosen, besides looking pretty tasty, because it bakes at the same temp as the \u201cchicken\u201d bakes! EFFICIENCY. I used French lentils as that's what I had. The cashew butter adds a nice body, with bonus extra protein!\n\nI portioned this (around 2x servings per box) into some tupperware from Dollarama, but only 1 of the 2 lids actually click on, so I\u2019ve had to put an elastic band over the other. I\u2019ll eat that one first, to minimise potential freezer burn. The third portion was eaten for dinner w/ rice and it was delicious.\n\n[Kale pesto](https://www.loveandlemons.com/kale-pesto/#wprm-recipe-container-54611) and [cilantro pesto](https://www.simplywhisked.com/cilantro-pesto/). The store had sales on both of these, and since I\u2019ve recently kinda gone off basil pesto, I wanted to experiment. I put the kale one in the ice cube trays to make it easy to portion, and was planning to put the cilantro pesto in too once the kale was frozen, but have now found the pucks impossible to remove despite the silicone bottom on this tray... Gonna soak them in warm water for a couple minutes tomorrow and see if I can pop them out that way.\n\nFinally, I also prepped the parsley + red onion I\u2019m gonna need for one of tomorrow\u2019s recipe by using the food processor to chop them.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/mb07z2qydhwe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745385486.0, "score": 46, "author": "neoazayii", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1k5rdni/day_1_of_my_meal_prep_marathon/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Meal Preparus Update", "selftext": "One week ago, my husband and I meal prepped over 600 meals. I had a few ingredients left and made some jalape\u00f1o basil pickles, pickled red onions, and pickled jalape\u00f1os. I also made garlic confit and mashed potatoes. I gave the remaining produce to my neighbor, as he loves to cook, plus some paneer, red wine shallot puree, and garlic confit. I also included a photo of my refrigerator since a lot of people were concerned my upright freezer was just a fridge. As well as a picture of my kitchen. I\u2019ve listed below some info and answers.  \n\\*This is a super long post\n\n\n\nHow much did I spend?\n\nTotal (Includes packaging): $1,833.76 - Averages out to just over $3 per meal. This does not take into account the sauces or sides I am able to do.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDrop the recipes.\n\nI\u2019ve linked a version of my Google Sheet that includes most of the recipes. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12eDUCKXM4wtdEKlpMoPNV-\\_CowO4W\\_8fGQsA9cP1BMk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12eDUCKXM4wtdEKlpMoPNV-_CowO4W_8fGQsA9cP1BMk/edit?usp=sharing) I am a bit of a chronic improviser when it comes to some of the recipes, from adding different seasoning to just making up dishes on the fly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWon\u2019t it all go bad/taste like freezer burn by the time you get to it?\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve been doing this for a few years now. We have ever lost one meal to freezer burn. We make sure our food is wrapped well and check our freezers basically anytime we go into the garage.\n\n\n\nWhy do you have so many freezers? What a waste.\n\nI used to have a cheesecake business. I bought the two chest freezers for the business. Would it be less of a waste if they sat in my garage unused?\n\n\n\nNo one asked, but these are not the only things in my freezer.\n\nThe whole bottom shelf of the upright freezer has portioned cookie dough, brownies, and homemade candy bars. I also have various sauces for desserts - chocolate fudge, strawberry margarita, mojito lime curd, lemon curd. There\u2019s chili, red sauce, homemade bacon, homemade breakfast sausage, breakfast sandwiches, pork chops, Birria taco meat, and 1/8th wheel of parmigiano regreggiano that has been grated.I also have bouillon cubes that are great for stocks/broth. And homemade German soft pretzels.\n\n\n\nHow do you stay so organized?\n\nThis was the smoothest it has gone in the two years we\u2019ve been doing this. I was shocked when it was day two and we needed to start editing dow our list because we were filling up space. I start by thinking through what went well from the last time. We talk about our goals for what we want to eat the next few months. This go around, we really wanted to focus on incorporating more vegetables into the main dishes. We also each pick a dish that may not fit the brief but we just love. This round was beef bourguignon and brisket. I then research recipes and look for recipes specifically with an overlap of ingredients, I then create a shopping list. My husband does the shopping. I create a day by day schedule, and then we knock it out in a weekend.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAren\u2019t you worried about a power outage/do you have a generator?\n\nObviously I have a generator. Aside from the freezer stashes, I live in Florida and it\u2019s just good to have a generator. I also live in a duplex, so if the power goes out while we are away, our neighbor would let us know and can go turn on the generator.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhy would you do so much for just 2-3 people?? Do you even like cooking??\n\nI love cooking. I would love to be able to cook meals from scratch every night. But I work in the food industry. It\u2019s physically and mentally exhausting. If you work in the industry, you get it. You spend all day cooking for other people that you don\u2019t have enough in the tank to do the same for yourself. Plus my commute is pretty long. My husband\u2019s job is from home and a lot less demanding. He\u2019s able to cook and prepare food, but I am just better at cooking. This was our solution to having really good meals that have the convenience of grocery store freezer meals. Also, we are about to gut and renovate our kitchen, so we needed meals that don\u2019t require the use of the kitchen.\n\n\n\nYou should go into business/sell these.\n\nThat\u2019s something I\u2019m definitely thinking about doing in the future. I really love my job and am learning a lot still. Ultimately what I think it would look like for me is a mix of meal prepped meals such as this, with pop up tasting meds. I love doing multi course meals when my friends come over. I\u2019ve done beef Wellington, smoked ribeye, wagyu tasting night (obviously we love beef). I would also do occasional classes. We just want to be in a better financial place and have some goals we would like to achieve before jumping into that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat about the waste? That\u2019s a lot of disposable containers.\n\nYes it is. Is it a perfect solution? No. I Willa continue to research better packaging/cooking containers. HOWEVER, when we have been busy and did not have meals on hand. We ate out a lot. The waste produced by fast food/takeout is way more than two aluminum containers a day. It\u2019s just jarring to see it all together like that. We reuse the deli containers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI could never know what I\u2019m going to eat for x months. You must have a miserable life.\u00a0\n\nThis works for myself ad my family. I try to do foods that can be changed up on the backend. I have chicken with peppers and onions - that can be stir fry/fajitas. The salmon and tilapia can be dressed up with different sauces. For the meatballs, they are seasoned very basically. On the backend, we can put them in red sauce, buffalo sauce, miso sauce, etc. This does not kill creativity, but doesn\u2019t require staring at a blank canvas every time I go to make something. And there is flexibility to have other things. We still go on dates, go over to friends\u2019 houses, and invite people over for special dinners.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI think you forgot the second part of meal prepping - eATinG iT.\n\nNo shit. Being one week out, we\u2019ve eaten about one week\u2019s worth of food.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k40dl8", "created_utc": 1745194411.0, "score": 73, "author": "Educational-Month-63", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1k40dl8/meal_preparus_update/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Already used half when I bought it which is why there\u2019s only 1 bag of it left.\n\n***Total: About $55***\n\nI am in no way saying I got the best deals, as I don\u2019t have time to scope out what is cheapest in my area, but I wanted to share what we realistically spend each month for the two of us to eat mostly home cooked meals.\n\nI hope these inspire someone!

That way it is more time efficient. \n\nAll the steps: \n\nFirst, wash, peel and chop the vegetables. No need for perfection, just chop them to chunks the size of your thumb. Melt some Butter or Margarine in a big pot and put the veggies in.\n\n Then with 800g of flour, 8 table Spoons of Olive Oil, 400ml of Mineralwater, all the dried yeast and 2 table spoons of Salt, make the Pizza dough. Let it rest for 45 Minutes.\n \nStir the pot occasionally while making the dough. \n\nWhen the dough is ready and resting, pour the tomato Purree in the pot and put in all the spices.

{"title": "How we meal prep as a family of 5", "selftext": "I know, 5 isn't nearly as exciting as those family of 12 meal preps, but it is more realistic for most people. We started meal prepping when my girlfriend went back to teaching full time in the classroom. We have 3 kids, all in different schools, and she teaches at one. I work from home, so take all that with what caveats you will.\n\nOur meal prep really starts on the Monday after we shop and do our actual food prep. We have a menu on the fridge that lists the days, and the dinners for those days. We plan what dinners we want around what the weather is going to be, what we have going on after school, what needs to be used up, etc. On that same board is a \"grocery list\" section that we use for suggestions. If one of us thinks of something we want for dinner in the coming weeks, it gets written down. This is how we come up with 90% of our dinners for the weeks.\n\nWe do our shopping and prepping every 2 weeks. The weekends the kids spend with their other parent are our shopping weeks. On the Friday before, we gather up the meals from the list, add in any more we need to bulk it up to 11 meals, then start the list. We try to duplicate ingredients, so if we're doing chicken breast one night, we might switch pulled pork to pulled chicken so we aren't buying extras. Then, we shop our pantry and freezer. Whatever we already have gets crossed off the list. Our list is divided up by the 3 stores we shop at most, just to make sure nothing gets forgotten.\n\nThe next day, Saturday, we do our shopping. We start around 8am and are home and done by about 12:30pm. This includes breakfast at a local diner, it's important to treat yourself. Once our shopping is done and things are pur away, we are done for the day and enjoy our Saturday.\n\nSunday, the real work gets done. Once we are up and caffinated, we set to work. Sandwiches for the kids, including lunch meat sandwiches, and homemade uncrustables. Then the Mrs. will take leftovers, snack trays, pasta salads, and occasionally sandwiches. We don't usually prep for me as I can cook for myself or eat up leftovers at home. We also make breakfast burritos, mini muffins, and mini pancakes for grab and go breakfasts on school days.\n\nWhere the most of our prep time goes through, is snacks. We prep baggies of berries and grapes, and we slice apples and toss them in a lemonade drink mix to stop them from browning. We cut up blocks of cheese and sticks of salami and pepperoni, and break down bags of chips, pretzels, and trail mix into individual servings. We have two teenage boys and entire bags *will* vanish if we don't. Also, working from home lends itself to voracious snacking, I am not innocent.\n\nThe most prep we do for dinners is breaking down and freezing big bags of peppers and onions, garlic, and some other occasional veg. Otherwise, dinners are made fresh every night.\n\nWe just finished our Sunday prep and I thought I'd share our process because it's a lot of work and I'm proud \ud83d\ude02", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1jsut2g/how_we_meal_prep_as_a_family_of_5/", "created_utc": 1743948144.0, "score": 118, "author": "Hour-Watercress-3865", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1jsut2g/how_we_meal_prep_as_a_family_of_5/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

You can also add any other veggies you want to this recipe, I like to add zucchini sometimes but only for smaller batches because the zucchini gets very soggy after sitting for a couple days.

Do you prep however many meals you want to eat in a single day, multiplied by 7? Sometimes, I see people\u2019s prep and it looks confusing and I can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re doing. Some include snacks. Some don\u2019t. Some have more containers. Some have fewer. Also, some things don\u2019t keep for a week. So, do you freeze some? If you\u2019re eating more than 3 meals in a day and include snacks, that all seems like a lot of food and prep. Sorry if my questions are silly and this post is long. Any advice or education would be appreciated.

After the bottoms turned golden-brown, I poured about a 1/3 of water in the pan and covered the pan with a lid. If you put a cornstarch slurry, after the water evaporates, it creates more of the crispy goodness \ud83d\ude0b \n\nI cooked the rice paper ones in the air fryer.

Adobo was probably around 1-2 tbsp, garic, onion, paprika may have been 2-3 tbsp each\n\nChicken\n1000 g raw chicken breast. \n1 tbsp oil (grapeseed)\nAdobo\nGarlic powder\nOnion powder\nPaprika. \nChicken was previously cut up into cubes, and i trimmed the fat off. I mixed the chicken in the seasonings. I let it sit for probably an hour. You can prep it the night before if needed.\n\nI own a very, very large pan so i can cook the chicken in one batch. I heat it up on medium high heat. I pour 1 tbsp of oil. Swirl the pan so its all coated in oil and cook the chicken, probably around 5 minutes and flip when its golden. Total time around 10-15 minutes\n\nNow for the bulgur! I used Duru extra exta course bulgur. (Yes, 2 extras) bought off amazon. \n \n225 g bulgur -5 servings\n2 whole large onions -chopped (~650 g)\nWhite mushrooms - chopped (large bjs pack ~680 g)\n1 can of hunt's tomato paste\n~2-3 tbsp of chicken bullion\n5-7 cloves of garlic\n\nI cleaned the mushrooms, peeled the onions and used a food chopper to cut them. I added 1 tbsp on oil to a large pot. I threw the onions in, let it sweat, turn a little translusent. Then i threw the mushrooms in. I covered it with a lid stirring occasionally. The veggies lost soooo much water that i didn't even need to add water for the bulgur! But you may need too, It's a 2:1 ratio. I added the chicken bullion and the chopped garlic. Stirred everything. Next I added the bulgur and the can of tomato paste, stirred and let it simmer for 20 minutes on low heat with a lid. After the bulgur was cooked through and tender. I raised the heat stiring often to sort of caramilize the tomato paste, otherwise it tastes a little raw. Cooked for maybe an extra 10 minutes. It turns a darker more rustic red color. \n\nI know it looks very 1 color red, but its just so good \ud83e\udd24\n\nIf you don't have bulgur you can use any grain, rice, farro, etc. \nEnjoy! \n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jcrpkb", "created_utc": 1742148714.0, "score": 9, "author": "Mint4Chip1", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1jcrpkb/chicken_with_bulgur/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Preparation (about 2 hours)\n\t\u2022\tFirst, I soak all my glass containers because I don\u2019t wash them during the week.\n\t\u2022\tThen, I go grocery shopping (1\u20131.5 hrs), without a fixed list\u2014I just buy whatever I feel like.\n\n2. Cleaning & Setup (1 hour)\n\t\u2022\tI wash all the containers, put away my groceries, and take a short break.\n\n3. Cooking (about 6\u20137 hours)\n\t\u2022\tI have a small student kitchen with a small air fryer, an Instant Pot, and a stove, but no dishwasher or much counter space.\n\t\u2022\tI usually start by chopping vegetables for a soup or curry or trying out a new recipe.\n\t\u2022\tThe first dish takes me about an hour, and then I start another, which also takes an hour.\n\t\u2022\tI constantly have to put ingredients back in the fridge and take them out again to prevent spoilage.\n\t\u2022\tI make three main meals:\n\t\u2022\tA curry or soup\n\t\u2022\tA large salad (which makes multiple portions)\n\t\u2022\tAnother dish, depending on what I feel like\n\t\u2022\tI also prepare a muesli mix for the week, which takes around 30\u201345 minutes.\n\t\u2022\tI feel like a lot of small in-between steps (like moving things in and out of the fridge) take up unnecessary time.\n\n4. Cleanup (2 hours)\n\t\u2022\tAfter a break (30\u201360 min), I wipe down all surfaces, wash the dishes, and store the meals in the fridge or freezer.\n\nDo you have any tips on making this process more efficient?

Cover with a neutral oil, and put on the lowest setting your stovetop allows - then wait. You let it go, stirring occasionally (though nothing should stick) until the cloves are golden brown and mushy. \nUnfortunately I only took videos of this not photos so I can't share here \n\nKeep both the garlic and the oil!! That oil is what we're making the aioli with! \nThese garlic cloves are soft and smooth and delicious and are excellent just smeared on bread by themselves but also added to.. anything! \n\nAioli:\nI do mine a little different - as you can just make one in a blender/food processor/with stick blender but I don't like it, and I whisk it by hand. But still use a blender haha. \n\nIn a blender I added stone ground honey Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, Cholula hot sauce, white vinegar, fresh parsley, salt, black pepper, onion powder, white sugar, dried parsley, and that garlic infused oil. \n\nI blended this together and set aside \n\nIn a bowl I added 3 egg yolks and a splash of lemon, started whisking, then slowly poured the blended oil mix in - whisking constantly. You want a nice steady stream of the oil going in but make sure you are whisking fast enough to incorporate/emulsify it as it's coming in! \n\nKeep going, past the point where your forearm wants to give out hahah. Once you've poured it all in and you've got a thick sauce you're done! Almost. Now add in a bunch of those confit garlic cloves (I ended up using all of them in the end despite intending to save some haha.) the garlic is soft enough that it'll whisk right in but still give you little bits of texture!\nAdjust seasoning one last time and that's it.\n\nI left mine a little loose, pourable. Like a thicker Caesar dressing consistency - but you can add more oil and take it all the way to a full mayonnaise consistency no problem! \n\nI slathered it on some chicken and rice for lunches this week, added some crispy fried onions, some gochugang sauce (not pictured), and ate two portions for dinner because after the first I was craving more LOL. \n\nAnyway, long write-up sorry! But if you make this, you'll see. It's bomb and you'll be inventing ways to eat more of it on stuff!

Cheat - use an envelope of Cream of Leek soup, not really leeks as they can be $$$.\n\nhttps://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/potato_leek_soup/ \n\nThai Coconut Squash Soup - cheat use 2 750g bags of frozen butternut squash. Defrost in a metal seive/collander for an hour before using. Saves so much time.\n\nhttps://www.saltandlavender.com/thai-coconut-squash-soup/ \n\nCornmeal muffins - to have something a bit different with chili and lasagna instead of plain toast. \n\nChocolate Chip Banana Bread - cooled, sliced, wax paper between slices and frozen.\n\nhttps://natashaskitchen.com/chocolate-chip-banana-bread/ \n\nRaspberry Bread - I use one bag of frozen raspberries because fresh berries out of season are $$$. Cool, slice, waxed paper layers.\n\nhttps://www.averiecooks.com/the-best-raspberry-bread/ \n\nAnd then there is always \"tart day.\" If nothing else I must make these tarts or Dad will disown me.

Today, I used carrots and broccoli. It's an amazing meal.\n\nRecipe:\n\n- 1200g cooked extra lean ground beef\n- 750g cooked organic quinoa\n- 500g carrots\n- 1500g broccoli \n- 250g cooked red kidney beans\n\nSpice mix:\n\n- 4 tablespoons chili powder\n- 2 tablespoons ground cumin\n- 4 teaspoons sea salt\n- 4 teaspoons ground black pepper\n- 2 teaspoons ground paprika\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n\nIn a large pan, I cooked the ground beef. When it was almost done, I added the spices in. I do this so I can ensure the beef is fully cooked, as the paprika makes it a little harder to see the pink beef.\n\nIn a separate large pot, I cooked 2 cups of quinoa with 4 cups of water. Afterward, I added the red kidney beans.\n\nFinally, I steamed the veggies until the color had just changed but still had a little crunch.\n\nAfter everything was done, I weighed and portioned it out.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe.

{"title": "Starting out, looking for specific app", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nas my title says I am starting out on my meal prep journey but I want to keep it flexible as in just making big batches of food but not assigning specific days or meal times to each portion so that I can still eat what I want from my prepared foods at a given time (with limits based on nutritional values of course). I am struggling with a relatively small fridge but also forgetting to eat specific ingredients before they spoil. \n\nSo I am looking for an app with which I can log what meal prepped foods I already cooked (plus the raw ingredients I still have in my fridge). It needs to be able to show the nutritional values for each portion (I don\u2019t mind typing it in manually), when it was made and till when it should be good. It would be great if you could copy the nutritional values or export them into a food tracking app (or to have that function in app). \n\nWhen I looked it up I only found calorie counting apps with which you could pre-track meals days ahead. But since I don\u2019t know when I want to eat it ahead that wouldn\u2019t work. Or apps for recipes based on fridge content, I haven\u2019t seen one there where you could log finished meals though. \n\nI know you could also use a marker to just write the made and due dates on the containers but I have a pretty tight fridge and will be jamming those in there so always getting them out to read the individual letterings would be a bit of a hassle. \n\nI hope you have a tip or just a general advice for beginners :) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1iw63ib/starting_out_looking_for_specific_app/", "created_utc": 1740301554.0, "score": 0, "author": "Kassena_Chernova", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1iw63ib/starting_out_looking_for_specific_app/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Made with Barilla protein pasta instead of regular pasta.\n\n**Stealth Health: Harissa Lemon Pasta**\n\n* This is from the [Slow Cooker Recipe Book](https://stealthhealthcookbook.com/). No publicly available link.\n* **Rating:** 4/5\n* **My macros:** 524 cals | 48.3g protein | 59.5g carbs | 13.1g fat\n* **Notes:** I made this after his french onion pasta, which set the bar high. It was good\u2026 but just not as good as that. It was easier to make, though! The yogurt tzatziki sauce you\u2019re supposed to put on top didn\u2019t freeze well. I had to go to a specialty supermarket to get harissa paste. It's good, but I probably won\u2019t make this again.\n\n[**JalalSamFit: Halal Cart Chicken & Rice**](https://www.instagram.com/jalalsamfit/reel/CvaZFAXoLzI/?hl=en)\n\n* **Rating:** 5/5. This SLAPPED.\n* **My macros:** 458 cals | 49.3g protein | 42.5g carbs | 9.9g fat\n* **Notes:** I never tried to freeze this, just ate it from the fridge 4 days in a row. It was delicious even on day 4.\n\n**FairFitEats** [**Honey Garlic Chicken Fried Rice**](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4YidLFvB4D/) **&** [**Sweet and Sour Chicken Rice Bowl**](https://www.instagram.com/fairfiteats/reel/C5TuQKarIvB/?hl=en)\n\n* Rating: 3/5 for both. Wouldn\u2019t recommend, unfortunately!\n* At least his macro estimations were fairly close to my calculations? \ud83e\udd37\n* I was pretty disappointed with both recipes. My chicken didn\u2019t come out remotely crispy like his did with the amount of cornstarch listed in the recipe (and I have the exact same airfryer as him). The sauce flavors were good but didn\u2019t wow me, like the other recipes I made. Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be trying more of his recipes... unless anyone has done one that really wowed them!\n\n# Other Meal Prep Musings\n\n* **Air fryer:** I got the [Instant Pot\u00ae Vortex\u00ae Pro 10QT Air Fryer](https://instantpot.com/products/instant-vortex-pro-10-quart-air-fryer-oven) because that\u2019s what Stealth Health uses. I thought having space for 2 trays in the air fryer would be a good thing. It\u2019s horrible. Food cooks so unevenly between the two trays. I\u2019m probably only going to cook one tray at a time moving forward.\n* **Food Containers:** After scouring many Reddit threads, I went with [IKEA 365+ 34 oz rectangular containers](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ikea-365-food-container-with-lid-rectangular-glass-plastic-s89567061/#content). I like that they're microwave safe, freezer safe, dishwasher safe, made of glass, and stack easily in the fridge/freezer. They\u2019re definitely a little large for the portions I usually end up with from these recipes though.\n* **Freezer Space:** Apparently I have a tiny freezer, because I can only fit about 12 of those glass containers in mine. I think my new plan moving forward is to do more of the 4 portion recipes and freeze a few different ones, rather than freeze 10 portions of the same thing... because man, I am getting sick of that harissa chicken pasta, haha.\n* **Burrito Wraps:** I used regular 10\" Mission Flour Burrito Tortillas for the burritos above. In the future, I'm going to try switching to the Mission Carb Balance Burrito Tortillas to try to shave 100 calories off every burrito.\n\nHope that was helpful!

Saut\u00e9ed onion and garlic until soft, then added coconut milk and curry paste. Next was the fish sauce and brown sugar. You can also add stuff to make it spicy but we had cajun chicken last week so no spice for us this week. Let that cook and thicken and then I added my chicken (being careful not to boil.

I picked up some souper cubes and stocked the freezer with a bunch of healthy mains and mix-and-matches, but have mostly been cooking new stuff rather than eating the freezer since while it has indeed been a total chaos show, cooking has been weirdly cathartic. \n\nFast forward to today, when I wake up with the beginnings of a classic spring cold. Normally this would lead to a lot of snack-meals where I don't feel good enough to cook anything complicated, so I just graze on whatever can be eaten from the packaging or ask my partner if we can just order something. NOT TODAY! In about six minutes I had a fabulous egg roll bowl with a two-ingredient spicy mayo I made real quick in the interim. It had protein. It had vegetables. It was spicy and tasted great even to my sick palate. This is exactly what I was hoping for when I started prepping.\n\nAppreciate this sub. <3 I had a good dinner because of y'all. \n\n(Recipe for those curious, not that I can find it or remember the details: veggie ground or pork, thinly sliced cabbage and I think spring onions, grated carrots, ginger, garlic, sauteed in a wok until the rough texture of the inside of an egg roll. Topped with a drizzle of equal parts mayo and chili garlic paste.

Add in 300g of washed basmati rice followed by 600mL of chicken stock, 1 tsp of smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp chilli powder and 1 tsp of dried oregano. Bring up to a boil, turn the heat to low, give it a mix, pop on a lid and let it go for 12 minutes undisturbed. After 12 minutes take it off the heat and let it sit for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes take the lid off, add in frozen peas and coriander (cilantro) and fluff and mix with together. \n\nThis isn\u2019t in the recipe but I took a can of corn, drained it and charred it in the pan that the chicken was cooked in. \n\nCan serve with extra peri peri sauce which is not pictured but I did portion them out to add on after reheating.

Day 3 was the blender day, so every recipe involved some blended cashews in some way.\n\nFirstly, this [tempeh mango curry](https://www.veganricha.com/mango-curry-tempeh-restaurant-curries/). I used red pepper tempeh \u2018cause it was on sale and unfortunately had to sub fenugreek seeds for fennel as it turned out that I was out of the latter! Very different tastes, but we make do. I also doubled the recipe & didn\u2019t bother steaming the tempeh. It turned out really well, despite almost burning it at one point (okay I def did burn parts of it, but hey ho). This\u2019ll go great with either rice or a flatbread. The mango tang from the chutney is fun.\n\nThe pucks are [alfredo sauce](https://minimalistbaker.com/30-minute-cashew-alfredo/), frozen in a muffin tin & then popped out for easier storage. Made this before, so I already knew I liked it. I had no vegan \u201cparmesan\u201d so I ended up throwing in some Violife mozzarella. Might throw frozen broccoli in with the pasta when I\u2019m cooking it, for extra bulk.\n\n[Butter \u201cchicken\u201d](https://www.veganricha.com/instant-pot-vegan-butter-chicken) is where it went a bit wrong. I decided to be efficient and blend the cashew cream needed for both this + the below soup recipe together\u2026and then proceeded to pour the entirety of the cream into the butter chicken, i.e. double what I needed. So, whoops.\n\nHad to add a bunch more salt, some more spices, another tablespoon of tomato paste as well as half a cup of tomato sauce, and the rest of the can of chickpeas in, before reducing it for a while via saute setting on my IP to get it back to roughly into the same shape it was before\u2026 I was just kinda tired and juggling too many things at once, so it was inevitable things would go wrong.\n\nStill really like it, at least and I left it overnight in the fridge to give it a better chance of the flavours developing before I freeze it.\n\nFinally, [lasagna soup]( https://elavegan.com/vegan-lasagna-soup/). I left out the lasagna sheets and will break them up & pop them in when reheating the soup on the stove. I added a pretty big handful of Violife mozzarella to make it extra creamy & gooey & cheesy, and what a good choice. Really delicious, will be especially great with some defrosted focaccia I have from a while back, I reckon.\n\nNot pictured is the absolutely huge jar (2+ cups worth) of cashew cream I ended up with because in rectifying my butter \u201cchicken\u201d mistake, I then decided to blend up a bunch and lost my mind somewhat. I have no plans for the cream rn, so will have to look into what to make with that.\n\nThis was all yesterday. Today, I might take a rest day, but it'll depend on how wisely I use my time before I need to head out this evening.

I\u2019m a pretty dedicated basmati person, but went with jasmine here and wow how much quicker and better it breaks down! I usually put red lentils into my congee for extra protein and to bulk it up, but fully forgot this time so\u2026 Whoops! Anyway, I\u2019m boring, so my usual topping is either chopped scallions or (store bought) fried onions, with crispy chilli crisp.\n\nI was gonna make the congee in my Instant Pot, but I didn\u2019t realise how much this recipe made when planning + I only have a mini IP. Making it on the stove messed up my timing & planning for the day a bit, esp. after this boiled over and I had to clean my stove mid-way through.\n\nSo, after the congee was done and my big pot was free again, I got on with [aubergine curry](https://old.reddit.com/r/MeatlessMealPrep/comments/gv88uj/eggplant_curry_in_coconut_milk_with_recipe/) from a recipe I found on Reddit a while back! It's in the two tupperware here, each holds about 2 servings. Unfortunately, I started meal prepping at around 5pmish, so by the time this was finished, it was almost 10pm and I was sort of sick of cooking and have no idea how it turned out. Does anyone else get that, where food just becomes unappealing after lots of cooking and you can\u2019t really taste it properly?? I will have to assess properly when I defrost it, I guess! It def didn\u2019t come out as beautifully rich-coloured as the photo in the recipe, but ain\u2019t that always the way.\n\nBecause my instant pot was now free for the day, I made an [Ethiopian lentil stew](https://www.cookwithmanali.com/instant-pot-ethiopian-lentil-stew/), which is in the ziplock bags in the pic. This was SO delicious, holy crap, and so so unctuous. Shoutout to the woman on my local Buy Nothing FB group who gave me a baggie of berbere spice so I could make this without buying yet another jar of spices. I\u2019ll likely will pair it with a citrusy couscous as a nice contrast.\n\nThe kebabs are my mum\u2019s speciality, though mine are made with Beyond mince instead of lamb ;) No recipe, seasoned from the heart. Mostly allspice, cumin, turmeric, ground coriander, paprika and salt. I added a tiny pinch of mint too. Then mixed in parsley & red onion. I have never gotten them to taste this good before??

This helps it brown better in the pan.\n\t\u2022\tSeason lightly with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n\n2.

Add the Chicken\n\t\u2022\tTurn the heat up to medium-high.\n\t\u2022\tAdd the diced chicken to the pan.\n\t\u2022\tCook for 6\u20138 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken pieces are lightly browned and almost cooked through (no pink in the center).\n\n4. Add Seasonings\n\t\u2022\tSprinkle in 2 tbsp curry powder, 1 tbsp paprika, and a little more salt and pepper.\n\t\u2022\tStir to coat the chicken evenly.

{"title": "Day 1 of my Meal Prep Marathon", "selftext": "I am starting a new job in a couple of weeks after a very long period of unemployment, so I think it\u2019s going to absolutely flatten me for the first month or so. As such, I decided to do a mini Meal Prep Marathon (w/ a couple break days) to make life easier for myself and reduce the amount of decision fatigue I\u2019ll run up against\u2014especially for lunch, which is my least favourite meal of the day to think about.\n\nI have tried to plan each day where different appliances & parts of my kitchen are utilised intelligently. i.e. today I did one Instant Pot meal, 2 oven meals at the same temp, 2 food processor \u201cmeals\u201d (rinsing between each without a full clean), and then using the processor to then prep for tomorrow so I can now put that away and not get it dirty again later. I don\u2019t have a dishwasher, so I also just want to minimise washing up as much as possible. Having said that, please don\u2019t ask me about what my sink looks like right now.\n\n**DAY 1**\n\nI used this [pizza dough recipe](https://sugarspunrun.com/the-best-pizza-dough-recipe/) & doubled it to make into [Costco chicken bake dupes](https://www.thekitchn.com/copycat-costco-chicken-bake-258344#post-recipe-12692), but veganised. I planned for homemade seitan but couldn\u2019t be bothered to add another thing to my plate in the end, so instead, I used Gardein \u201cchicken\u201d strips and a shop-bought Caesar dressing. There\u2019s Violife\u2019s smoked provolone on the inside (since it\u2019s quite melty) and Violife mozzarella on the top. Violife is my fave brand for cheese, hands down. Two of these came out too brown because I\u2019m still working out the oven in my new place.\n\nThey are waaay bigger than I expected when planning, and a little softer. I like the concept though, and may make mini versions of these in the future if I end up liking them.\n\nNote: I have never even been in a Costco, much less had one of these bakes, so I have no idea of accuracy.\n\nI doubled this [Instant Pot quinoa recipe](https://minimalistbaker.com/instant-pot-quinoa-fluffy-perfect-no-soaking/) to switch up from rice occasionally. Cooked with Better than Bouillon No-Chicken stock. Still a tiny bit bitter, but much less than I\u2019ve had with quinoa in the past. I froze one baggie with 2-cups worth, the rest 1-cup.\n\n[Creamy curried lentil casserole](https://www.veganricha.com/lentil-curry-casserole/) chosen, besides looking pretty tasty, because it bakes at the same temp as the \u201cchicken\u201d bakes! EFFICIENCY. I used French lentils as that's what I had. The cashew butter adds a nice body, with bonus extra protein!\n\nI portioned this (around 2x servings per box) into some tupperware from Dollarama, but only 1 of the 2 lids actually click on, so I\u2019ve had to put an elastic band over the other. I\u2019ll eat that one first, to minimise potential freezer burn. The third portion was eaten for dinner w/ rice and it was delicious.\n\n[Kale pesto](https://www.loveandlemons.com/kale-pesto/#wprm-recipe-container-54611) and [cilantro pesto](https://www.simplywhisked.com/cilantro-pesto/). The store had sales on both of these, and since I\u2019ve recently kinda gone off basil pesto, I wanted to experiment.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12eDUCKXM4wtdEKlpMoPNV-\\_CowO4W\\_8fGQsA9cP1BMk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12eDUCKXM4wtdEKlpMoPNV-_CowO4W_8fGQsA9cP1BMk/edit?usp=sharing) I am a bit of a chronic improviser when it comes to some of the recipes, from adding different seasoning to just making up dishes on the fly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWon\u2019t it all go bad/taste like freezer burn by the time you get to it?\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve been doing this for a few years now. We have ever lost one meal to freezer burn. We make sure our food is wrapped well and check our freezers basically anytime we go into the garage.\n\n\n\nWhy do you have so many freezers? What a waste.\n\nI used to have a cheesecake business. I bought the two chest freezers for the business. Would it be less of a waste if they sat in my garage unused?\n\n\n\nNo one asked, but these are not the only things in my freezer.\n\nThe whole bottom shelf of the upright freezer has portioned cookie dough, brownies, and homemade candy bars. I also have various sauces for desserts - chocolate fudge, strawberry margarita, mojito lime curd, lemon curd. There\u2019s chili, red sauce, homemade bacon, homemade breakfast sausage, breakfast sandwiches, pork chops, Birria taco meat, and 1/8th wheel of parmigiano regreggiano that has been grated.I also have bouillon cubes that are great for stocks/broth. And homemade German soft pretzels.\n\n\n\nHow do you stay so organized?\n\nThis was the smoothest it has gone in the two years we\u2019ve been doing this. I was shocked when it was day two and we needed to start editing dow our list because we were filling up space. I start by thinking through what went well from the last time. We talk about our goals for what we want to eat the next few months. This go around, we really wanted to focus on incorporating more vegetables into the main dishes. We also each pick a dish that may not fit the brief but we just love. This round was beef bourguignon and brisket. I then research recipes and look for recipes specifically with an overlap of ingredients, I then create a shopping list. My husband does the shopping. I create a day by day schedule, and then we knock it out in a weekend.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAren\u2019t you worried about a power outage/do you have a generator?\n\nObviously I have a generator. Aside from the freezer stashes, I live in Florida and it\u2019s just good to have a generator. I also live in a duplex, so if the power goes out while we are away, our neighbor would let us know and can go turn on the generator.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhy would you do so much for just 2-3 people?? Do you even like cooking??\n\nI love cooking. I would love to be able to cook meals from scratch every night. But I work in the food industry. It\u2019s physically and mentally exhausting. If you work in the industry, you get it. You spend all day cooking for other people that you don\u2019t have enough in the tank to do the same for yourself. Plus my commute is pretty long. My husband\u2019s job is from home and a lot less demanding. He\u2019s able to cook and prepare food, but I am just better at cooking. This was our solution to having really good meals that have the convenience of grocery store freezer meals. Also, we are about to gut and renovate our kitchen, so we needed meals that don\u2019t require the use of the kitchen.\n\n\n\nYou should go into business/sell these.\n\nThat\u2019s something I\u2019m definitely thinking about doing in the future. I really love my job and am learning a lot still. Ultimately what I think it would look like for me is a mix of meal prepped meals such as this, with pop up tasting meds. I love doing multi course meals when my friends come over. I\u2019ve done beef Wellington, smoked ribeye, wagyu tasting night (obviously we love beef). I would also do occasional classes. We just want to be in a better financial place and have some goals we would like to achieve before jumping into that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat about the waste? That\u2019s a lot of disposable containers.\n\nYes it is. Is it a perfect solution? No. I Willa continue to research better packaging/cooking containers. HOWEVER, when we have been busy and did not have meals on hand. We ate out a lot. The waste produced by fast food/takeout is way more than two aluminum containers a day. It\u2019s just jarring to see it all together like that. We reuse the deli containers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI could never know what I\u2019m going to eat for x months. You must have a miserable life.\u00a0\n\nThis works for myself ad my family. I try to do foods that can be changed up on the backend. I have chicken with peppers and onions - that can be stir fry/fajitas. The salmon and tilapia can be dressed up with different sauces. For the meatballs, they are seasoned very basically. On the backend, we can put them in red sauce, buffalo sauce, miso sauce, etc. This does not kill creativity, but doesn\u2019t require staring at a blank canvas every time I go to make something. And there is flexibility to have other things. We still go on dates, go over to friends\u2019 houses, and invite people over for special dinners.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI think you forgot the second part of meal prepping - eATinG iT.\n\nNo shit. Being one week out, we\u2019ve eaten about one week\u2019s worth of food.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k40dl8", "created_utc": 1745194411.0, "score": 71, "author": "Educational-Month-63", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1k40dl8/meal_preparus_update/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

And also there will be cake, because I like cake. (But there is no tomato sauce in the cake.)\n\nYou could swap out the Lentils for minced meat or another protein. The veggies in the sauce are variable as well, just dump in what you have and like. \n\nI usually freeze half the Pizzas and Pizza Pockets raw.

That way it is more time efficient. \n\nAll the steps: \n\nFirst, wash, peel and chop the vegetables. No need for perfection, just chop them to chunks the size of your thumb. Melt some Butter or Margarine in a big pot and put the veggies in.\n\n Then with 800g of flour, 8 table Spoons of Olive Oil, 400ml of Mineralwater, all the dried yeast and 2 table spoons of Salt, make the Pizza dough. Let it rest for 45 Minutes.\n \nStir the pot occasionally while making the dough. \n\nWhen the dough is ready and resting, pour the tomato Purree in the pot and put in all the spices. Let the pot simmer until the veggies are soft. \n\nNow while the sauce is cooking make a cake dough with 500g of flour, baking powder, eggs, milk, sugar, Margarine and chocolate chips. \nPut the cake in the oven for 45-50 Minutes at 180 Celsius. \n\nWhen the veggies are soft, purree the Sauce. \n\nDivide the Pizza dough in 8 pieces, roll them out. Cut all the Mozzarella into slices. Now put tomato sauce, Mozzarella Cheese and shredded Cheese on your pizzas. Bake them right away or freeze them. \n\nNow for the Pizza Pockets. Wash and purree the Lentils (or prepare another protein of your liking). Put some of the tomato sauce into the lentil Purree. Cut the puffed pastry dough into rectangles and fill your Pizza Pockets with lentils and all the leftover Cheese from the Pizza. Bake them for 10-15 Minutes or freeze them.\n\nThe leftover sauce can go in the fridge and will make a nice pasta dinner.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtjt58", "created_utc": 1744028186.0, "score": 10, "author": "fraulish21", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1jtjt58/tomato_sauce_prep_plus_cake/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "How we meal prep as a family of 5", "selftext": "I know, 5 isn't nearly as exciting as those family of 12 meal preps, but it is more realistic for most people. We started meal prepping when my girlfriend went back to teaching full time in the classroom. We have 3 kids, all in different schools, and she teaches at one. I work from home, so take all that with what caveats you will.\n\nOur meal prep really starts on the Monday after we shop and do our actual food prep. We have a menu on the fridge that lists the days, and the dinners for those days. We plan what dinners we want around what the weather is going to be, what we have going on after school, what needs to be used up, etc. On that same board is a \"grocery list\" section that we use for suggestions. If one of us thinks of something we want for dinner in the coming weeks, it gets written down. This is how we come up with 90% of our dinners for the weeks.\n\nWe do our shopping and prepping every 2 weeks. The weekends the kids spend with their other parent are our shopping weeks. On the Friday before, we gather up the meals from the list, add in any more we need to bulk it up to 11 meals, then start the list. We try to duplicate ingredients, so if we're doing chicken breast one night, we might switch pulled pork to pulled chicken so we aren't buying extras. Then, we shop our pantry and freezer. Whatever we already have gets crossed off the list. Our list is divided up by the 3 stores we shop at most, just to make sure nothing gets forgotten.\n\nThe next day, Saturday, we do our shopping. We start around 8am and are home and done by about 12:30pm. This includes breakfast at a local diner, it's important to treat yourself. Once our shopping is done and things are pur away, we are done for the day and enjoy our Saturday.\n\nSunday, the real work gets done. Once we are up and caffinated, we set to work. Sandwiches for the kids, including lunch meat sandwiches, and homemade uncrustables. Then the Mrs. will take leftovers, snack trays, pasta salads, and occasionally sandwiches. We don't usually prep for me as I can cook for myself or eat up leftovers at home. We also make breakfast burritos, mini muffins, and mini pancakes for grab and go breakfasts on school days.\n\nWhere the most of our prep time goes through, is snacks. We prep baggies of berries and grapes, and we slice apples and toss them in a lemonade drink mix to stop them from browning. We cut up blocks of cheese and sticks of salami and pepperoni, and break down bags of chips, pretzels, and trail mix into individual servings. We have two teenage boys and entire bags *will* vanish if we don't. Also, working from home lends itself to voracious snacking, I am not innocent.\n\nThe most prep we do for dinners is breaking down and freezing big bags of peppers and onions, garlic, and some other occasional veg. Otherwise, dinners are made fresh every night.\n\nWe just finished our Sunday prep and I thought I'd share our process because it's a lot of work and I'm proud \ud83d\ude02", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1jsut2g/how_we_meal_prep_as_a_family_of_5/", "created_utc": 1743948144.0, "score": 123, "author": "Hour-Watercress-3865", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1jsut2g/how_we_meal_prep_as_a_family_of_5/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I\u2019ve worked out over the years with good results, and though I\u2019ve always wanted and intended to meal prep, I\u2019ve actually never done it for fitness. I would just make food as I went.

You can also add any other veggies you want to this recipe, I like to add zucchini sometimes but only for smaller batches because the zucchini gets very soggy after sitting for a couple days.

I cook with my heart. The following is 5 servings. Almost all ingredients are measured raw with the exception of spices, and garlic. Those are measured by my heart. Adobo was probably around 1-2 tbsp, garic, onion, paprika may have been 2-3 tbsp each\n\nChicken\n1000 g raw chicken breast. \n1 tbsp oil (grapeseed)\nAdobo\nGarlic powder\nOnion powder\nPaprika. \nChicken was previously cut up into cubes, and i trimmed the fat off. I mixed the chicken in the seasonings. I let it sit for probably an hour. You can prep it the night before if needed.\n\nI own a very, very large pan so i can cook the chicken in one batch. I heat it up on medium high heat. I pour 1 tbsp of oil. Swirl the pan so its all coated in oil and cook the chicken, probably around 5 minutes and flip when its golden. Total time around 10-15 minutes\n\nNow for the bulgur! I used Duru extra exta course bulgur. (Yes, 2 extras) bought off amazon. \n \n225 g bulgur -5 servings\n2 whole large onions -chopped (~650 g)\nWhite mushrooms - chopped (large bjs pack ~680 g)\n1 can of hunt's tomato paste\n~2-3 tbsp of chicken bullion\n5-7 cloves of garlic\n\nI cleaned the mushrooms, peeled the onions and used a food chopper to cut them. I added 1 tbsp on oil to a large pot. I threw the onions in, let it sweat, turn a little translusent. Then i threw the mushrooms in. I covered it with a lid stirring occasionally. The veggies lost soooo much water that i didn't even need to add water for the bulgur! But you may need too, It's a 2:1 ratio. I added the chicken bullion and the chopped garlic. Stirred everything. Next I added the bulgur and the can of tomato paste, stirred and let it simmer for 20 minutes on low heat with a lid. After the bulgur was cooked through and tender. I raised the heat stiring often to sort of caramilize the tomato paste, otherwise it tastes a little raw. Cooked for maybe an extra 10 minutes. It turns a darker more rustic red color. \n\nI know it looks very 1 color red, but its just so good \ud83e\udd24\n\nIf you don't have bulgur you can use any grain, rice, farro, etc. \nEnjoy! \n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jcrpkb", "created_utc": 1742148714.0, "score": 10, "author": "Mint4Chip1", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1jcrpkb/chicken_with_bulgur/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019d love to make it more efficient, but I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m losing time. Here\u2019s my current process:\n\n1. Preparation (about 2 hours)\n\t\u2022\tFirst, I soak all my glass containers because I don\u2019t wash them during the week.\n\t\u2022\tThen, I go grocery shopping (1\u20131.5 hrs), without a fixed list\u2014I just buy whatever I feel like.\n\n2. Cleaning & Setup (1 hour)\n\t\u2022\tI wash all the containers, put away my groceries, and take a short break.\n\n3. Cooking (about 6\u20137 hours)\n\t\u2022\tI have a small student kitchen with a small air fryer, an Instant Pot, and a stove, but no dishwasher or much counter space.\n\t\u2022\tI usually start by chopping vegetables for a soup or curry or trying out a new recipe.\n\t\u2022\tThe first dish takes me about an hour, and then I start another, which also takes an hour.\n\t\u2022\tI constantly have to put ingredients back in the fridge and take them out again to prevent spoilage.\n\t\u2022\tI make three main meals:\n\t\u2022\tA curry or soup\n\t\u2022\tA large salad (which makes multiple portions)\n\t\u2022\tAnother dish, depending on what I feel like\n\t\u2022\tI also prepare a muesli mix for the week, which takes around 30\u201345 minutes.\n\t\u2022\tI feel like a lot of small in-between steps (like moving things in and out of the fridge) take up unnecessary time.\n\n4. Cleanup (2 hours)\n\t\u2022\tAfter a break (30\u201360 min), I wipe down all surfaces, wash the dishes, and store the meals in the fridge or freezer.\n\nDo you have any tips on making this process more efficient? Maybe better workflows, parallel steps, or different approaches?

Cover with a neutral oil, and put on the lowest setting your stovetop allows - then wait. You let it go, stirring occasionally (though nothing should stick) until the cloves are golden brown and mushy. \nUnfortunately I only took videos of this not photos so I can't share here \n\nKeep both the garlic and the oil!! That oil is what we're making the aioli with! \nThese garlic cloves are soft and smooth and delicious and are excellent just smeared on bread by themselves but also added to.. anything! \n\nAioli:\nI do mine a little different - as you can just make one in a blender/food processor/with stick blender but I don't like it, and I whisk it by hand. But still use a blender haha. \n\nIn a blender I added stone ground honey Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, Cholula hot sauce, white vinegar, fresh parsley, salt, black pepper, onion powder, white sugar, dried parsley, and that garlic infused oil. \n\nI blended this together and set aside \n\nIn a bowl I added 3 egg yolks and a splash of lemon, started whisking, then slowly poured the blended oil mix in - whisking constantly.

Like a thicker Caesar dressing consistency - but you can add more oil and take it all the way to a full mayonnaise consistency no problem! \n\nI slathered it on some chicken and rice for lunches this week, added some crispy fried onions, some gochugang sauce (not pictured), and ate two portions for dinner because after the first I was craving more LOL. \n\nAnyway, long write-up sorry!

I go down every 3-4 months and do meal prep/freezer cooking for him. I'm looking to \"expand\" my meals for him. I make a ton right now but change is good. NOTE: recipes *must* be fully cooked and subject to reheating on stove-top or in microwave. He rarely uses his 40-inch wide gas oven as it is too much for him. I've tried to get him to invest in a toaster oven or air fryer. No go. \n\nSo, I normally spend 7 days \"with\" Dad. Day one & day 7 are travel day so little cooking is done. But Day one is shopping day. I can normally get meals for 3-4 months for under $500 CDN. Because some items are expensive \ud83e\udd23 as you'll see below. I'm going to list what I always make, and what I might make depending upon time and prices. So here we go ...\n\nMeatloaf 6lbs makes 27 individual mini-loaves (special pan bought by Mum).\n\nMeatloaf twist - 2lbs ground pork & 2lbs loose sausage meat. Makes 18 individual mini-loaves.\n\nChili - I use the following recipe, make a double batch. It's supposed to be a dump meals. But I cook it all the way then cool and portion.\n\nhttps://freezermeals101.com/the-best-freezer-chili/ \n\nLasagna - twist on the horizontal layering. Place 2 cooled portions in a foil container with lids. \n\nhttps://natashaskitchen.com/lasagna-roll-ups/ \n\nChicken & Sausage Jambalaya - the recipe says it 8 portions but they are HUGE portions. I get 8 portions of it *after* Dad and I have it for supper!\n\nhttps://www.southernliving.com/recipes/chicken-and-sausage-jambalaya-recipe \n\nSausage, Bean, and Rice Casserole - Mum's recipe willing to share. \n\nBeef Stroganoff Casserole - Mum's recipe willing to share. \n\nPotato Leek Soup - original recipe below. Cheat - use an envelope of Cream of Leek soup, not really leeks as they can be $$$.\n\nhttps://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/potato_leek_soup/ \n\nThai Coconut Squash Soup - cheat use 2 750g bags of frozen butternut squash. Defrost in a metal seive/collander for an hour before using. Saves so much time.\n\nhttps://www.saltandlavender.com/thai-coconut-squash-soup/ \n\nCornmeal muffins - to have something a bit different with chili and lasagna instead of plain toast. \n\nChocolate Chip Banana Bread - cooled, sliced, wax paper between slices and frozen.\n\nhttps://natashaskitchen.com/chocolate-chip-banana-bread/ \n\nRaspberry Bread - I use one bag of frozen raspberries because fresh berries out of season are $$$. Cool, slice, waxed paper layers.\n\nhttps://www.averiecooks.com/the-best-raspberry-bread/ \n\nAnd then there is always \"tart day.\" If nothing else I must make these tarts or Dad will disown me. I use pre-made 3 inch tart shells. Take from the freezer, prepare fillings and bake. Never had a problem that wasn't oven heat regulator issue.\n\nHam and Cheese Quiche - Mum's recipe willing to share.\n\nBroccoli Cheese Quiche - ditto \n\nMushroom Tartlets - ditto\n\nRoast Beef, Asiago Quiche - ditto\n\nIF I have time and it's not too expensive:\n\nPulled pork\n\nRoast Beef/Sunday Dinner (freezing sliced beef)\n\nHungarian \"liver dumpling\" soup - tastes better than it sounds. Uses chicken liver. Willing to share recipe.\n\nBeef Barley Soup\n\nPrep 4kg box of chicken breasts - whole, sliced for stir fry, and shredded\n\nPrep pork chops - sliced for stir fry\n\nGround beef - browned and frozen for Dad's version of taco salad\n\nWalnut filling for Hungarian Pastry called Kifli.

It's an amazing meal.\n\nRecipe:\n\n- 1200g cooked extra lean ground beef\n- 750g cooked organic quinoa\n- 500g carrots\n- 1500g broccoli \n- 250g cooked red kidney beans\n\nSpice mix:\n\n- 4 tablespoons chili powder\n- 2 tablespoons ground cumin\n- 4 teaspoons sea salt\n- 4 teaspoons ground black pepper\n- 2 teaspoons ground paprika\n- 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n\nIn a large pan, I cooked the ground beef. When it was almost done, I added the spices in. I do this so I can ensure the beef is fully cooked, as the paprika makes it a little harder to see the pink beef.\n\nIn a separate large pot, I cooked 2 cups of quinoa with 4 cups of water. Afterward, I added the red kidney beans.\n\nFinally, I steamed the veggies until the color had just changed but still had a little crunch.\n\nAfter everything was done, I weighed and portioned it out.\n\nI hope you enjoy this recipe. It's quick and delicious, packed full of nutrients.\n\n**Macros:**\n\nExtra Lean Ground Beef:\n- **Calories**: 312\n- **Protein**: 53 grams\n- **Fat**: 11 grams\n- **Carbohydrates**: 0 grams\n- **Fiber**: 0 grams\n\nQuinoa and Beans:\n- **Calories**: ~248\n- **Protein**: ~11g\n- **Carbohydrates**: ~43g\n- **Fiber**: ~9g\n- **Fat**: ~3.2g\n\nBroccoli and Carrots:\n- **Calories**: ~146\n- **Protein**: ~9.4g\n- **Carbohydrates**: ~30g\n- **Fiber**: ~11g\n- **Fat**: ~1.4g\n\n**Meal Total:**\n- **Calories**: 706\n- **Protein**: 73.4g\n- **Carbohydrates**: 73g\n- **Fiber**: 20g\n- **Fat**: 15.6g", "url": "https://i.redd.it/wedt87r6d0le1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1740368535.0, "score": 33, "author": "bigboss-91", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/MealPrepSunday/comments/1iwstsn/perfect_lunch_plate/", "html_title": ""}

I do not care about taste or texture I just simply need the calories. For background I have a chronic illness that can quickly become severe so I need to have meals ready for then.\n\nMy plan:\n1. Boil the chicken in one pot\n2. Make the rice in another pot\n3. Once both are done shred the chicken, fluff the rice, and let both cool\n4. Freeze in decent sized portions, maybe 2 servings of each per bag/container. Dont mix the chicken and rice together.\n5. When I want to eat some, be able to have it ready within 30 minutes.\n\nIm struggling with a few things:\n1. Ideally I would like to just microwave the food from frozen, so what kind of container/bag should I use?\n2. If microwaving isnt a good option, I suppose I could maybe bring a pot of water to a boil and place the container/bag in the water to let it thaw.
