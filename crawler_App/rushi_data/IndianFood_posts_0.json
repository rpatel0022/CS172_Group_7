I diced my onions against the grain, made sure the oil was hot before adding them, and just kept saut\u00e9ing until they turned that perfect golden brown. Then I added the tomatoes and patiently cooked them until I saw the oil separate (\"bhuno\").\n\nOnce the masala was ready, I added chicken breasts, and honestly, it turned out amazing! The curry was smooth, thick, and just how I wanted it to be.\n\nBut (of course, there\u2019s a but), I ran into a new problem. Toward the end of cooking, I noticed some water separating from the curry. That\u2019s when it hit me\u2014I had added way too much water after putting in the chicken. I didn\u2019t realize chicken breasts release water on their own, so the extra water wasn\u2019t even necessary. Totally my bad!\n\nStill, I\u2019m so happy with the progress.

The video will still be a valuable guide for anyone who wants it, but it should be possible to cook the dish just from the text recipe.\n\n\nThe rule only applies to recipe videos; Indian-food related videos that are not recipes are still welcome (e.g. a video on the street food scene in Mumbai would be perfectly fine), but should include some text about what the video is, and perhaps why you liked it, rather than just dumping a link into the text box and pasting in the video title from youtube.\n\n\nExample:\n--\nSee [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/gyvd6z/how_to_make_madras_british_indian_restaurant_bir/) for an example.

Rather than forcing them to submit another 9 links just for the sake of maintaining a ratio, I would like to try something different, and ask people to:\n\n* limit posting your own stuff to once a week\n* don't just treat the subreddit as a place to promote your stuff; read and interact with commenters in both your posts and other posts as well.\n\nIn other words, we will assume people are posting here in good faith and not just looking to spam the subreddit, and make it clear what \"not spamming\" looks like.\n\nReporting:\n--\nAs a further experiment, we will configure the automod to automatically remove posts that receive a high number of reports. The mods will manually monitor this and reapprove false positives.

{"title": "Guide to Generic meat and special curries - Indian spices, curry bases, herbs.", "selftext": "I finally am writing a long post to give you an idea of generic Indian curries, this can apply to meat curries or paneer / potato / other vegetable curries. This is mostly for meats.\n\nBest utensil to cook in - woks.\n\n1. **Indian spices family A** \\- garam masala -\n\nCardamom, Cinnamon, Cloves, bay leaf and black pepper. They added whole and/or as powdered spice. They are usually added together. Bay leaf is added whole.\n\nFor every 1lb - 1.5 lb meat / 2 cup rice / 3 cup veggies - add whole 1 inch cinnamon, 4-5 cloves, 4-5 cardamom pods, 4-5 whole black pepper, 1 tsp cumin.\n\n**Or** dry roast these spices and grind them to a paste, use 1-2 tsp for every dish.\n\n2. **Indian spices family B** \\- regular powdered spices -\n\nturmeric, cumin, coriander : These are usually added as ready made powders. 1/2-1 tsp each for any dish. You can make taste variations by adding only cumin to make a cumin based curry or only coriander for a coriander based curry.\n\n3. **Indian spices family C** \\- special /regional -\n\nmace, nutmeg, star anise, aamchur, saffron, asafoetida, ajwain, nigella seeds, fennel, methi seeds (fenugreek). These are added sparingly and will vary from dish to dish.\n\n**4. Main ingredients for curry base-**\n\na. most common - onions, ginger, (tomatoes are used nowadays not traditionally), sometimes root turmeric,  yogurt/hung yogurt. Chillies are common too, add based on the spice level you can eat.\n\nOnion, ginger, garlic, tomatoes can be used sliced/chopped and/or as paste. In most dishes both are used.\n\nb. for thickening curry bases - Nuts (almond/cashew), poppy seed paste, sometimes besan/ paste of split chana daal is used.. all healthy ingredients.\n\nc. Tamarind paste is used to add sour taste. Palm sugar used to add sweetness.\n\nd. Coconut grated/ milk.\n\ne. We don't usually use stocks for Indian curries, these are restaurant twists and unnecessary.\n\n5. **Herbs** \\- Coriander- all over India. North Indian dishes - mint, fenugreek leaves fresh or dried. Some eastern indian food - turmeric leaf, gondhoraj lime leaves ( can be substituted with kaffir lime leaves) South india - curry leaves.\n\n6. **Ready made masala** \\- best avoided, they are often not traditional and the taste is strange. subjective, like I have used 'bihari kebab masala' and Shaan's 'biriyani masala' successfully. 'bihari kebab masala' is good for kebabs and tikka masala curry. I have also used Sambar masala readymade and Shaan's chola masala but I use it along with fresh spices.\n\nRemember curry leaf and turmeric leaves aren't used as garnish, they are used during cooking or tempering.\n\n**Process** \\-\n\n1. You need to start with marinating the meat. usually turmeric + ginger + garlic + onion paste + yogurt + any spice of your choice. Marinate overnight for sharp taste, tender meat. total marinade should be 2-3 tbsp.\n2. If making tikka masala then use kebab/tikka additional spices and grill marinated meat. Then add the meat back to curry at step 7.. you need less cooking time after step 7.\n3. You can make curry paste using curry base common ingredients 4a. and add anything from thickening ingredients 4b.\n4. 1/4 onion, 1/2 tomato, 2 cloves of garlic and 1-2 inch ginger, 2 tbsp nuts, 2-3 tbsp yogurt is enough for 1 -1.5 lb marinated meat. Use another 1/4 onion as sliced.\n5. Heat oil, ( 1 tbsp oil is enough for 1 kg meat, any extra is as per your level of richness) add garam masala whole, cumin whole add sliced onions, fry till golden add salt and sugar. For any south Indian dish (like restaurants call it madras curry, add curry leaves and whole mustard seeds at this point.\n6. Now add your curry paste of choice from listed ingredients. fry till color darkens. keep adding splashes of water so the paste doesn't burn and remain porridgy in consistency.\n7. Add meat and fry, braise till meat incorporates all flavours.\n8. From here on you can add other powder spices and your choice of special spices like mace/nutmeg etc. and keep adding water. For simple curries just add water, cover and cook for 20-40 mins or till meat is tender, for special dishes and for rich flavour add only splashes of water / yogurt and keep stirring/ cook under supervision.\n9. Garnish with herbs of your choice.\n10. **Editing to add** \\- some of us add extra dollop of ghee/butter while serving. I personally don't do that for health. If serving to guests, I follow my mother who adds few drops (**yes drops**) of ghee directly to the hot curry along with a pinch of home made garam masala sprinkled for enhanced flavour. Restaurants often add second tempering - i.e. heat oil/butter/ghee and add spices and stirred for 2-3 minutes and added to the dish. You can do this if feeling fancy. ( Ghee in India is more flavourful and one needs to use less )\n\nYou can create your own curry from here like all Indians do at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome well known curries\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Rogan josh is kashmiri and known for it's fiery red color.  The pandit style has no garlic, no onion .. main ingredients - **hing (asafoetida), kashmiri red chillies, ratanjot, fennel powder** (a must), **ginger powder and yogurt** based curry. The muslin version adds onion garlic.\n2. Madras curry - It is a made up name, basically this dish has all Indian spices + **curry leaves + coconut** and probably tamarind too. It is a representative of the different meat dishes made in southern India.\n3. Vindaloo - **Vinegar** based curry sauce, origin Portugese-Indian hybrid from Goa.\n4. Tikka Masala - This dish is again invented by restaurants. Basically the meat is grilled like **kebabs** then cooked in a thick **yogurt-cashew** rich curry.\n5. Korma - Meat fried and braised in spices  and ghee\n6. Saag gosht - **Saag means leafy green**, the dish is a Restaurant hybrid. Meat with paste of leafy greens ( should ideally be mustard greens but they add spinach)\n7. Karahi - A North western/ Northern/ Pakistani dish - meat braised with all sorts of spices, lots of oil and lot of tomatoes\n8. Regular chicken curry - The one I wrote.\n9. Goalondo steamer curry -rustic dish, Chicken marinated for 20min- 1 hr with coarsly pounded sliced onion + ginger + chillies + garlic + mustard oil. Cover and cook in the same pot till done. dry Shrimp paste can be added, boiled eggs can be added,\n10. Indian chicken stew -  with butter, garam masala, little milk and veggies\n11. Kerala chicken stew - butter/ coconut oil, garam masala, coconut milk, curry leaves and veggies.. served with appam.\n\nIn restaurants I am often disappointed by the dishes, there is hardly any difference of one from the other. Specially outside India.\n\nNote : Since someone pointed out, this is an idea about generic curries, the state/ regional,/ family level granularity is huge and beyond the scope of this post.  Even a guide to different variations in Bengali meat curries which I am well versed with, will need a huge post, rather a book. I am afraid I am not even qualified to include regional variations because I don't have granular knowledge of all regions and variations.. it's so immense scope.\n\nThis is a generic guide to (meat curries) with some regional references. I am not claiming that I have been able to include the rich and diverse variety in a single post !! Refer to my Bengali recipes for an idea about vegetarian Bengali food. And I have limited knowledge of other regions.\n\nEdited to add a note about mutton and lamb: mutton acts very differently compared to chicken. You will have to dial up oil, spices, marination and curry base as well as frying and cooking time. Mutton has a strong smell so you need twice the amount of onion, ginger and garlic. You may add some tamarind for additional kick. It would call for more garam masala, cumin and coriander.\n\n\n\nNote - I am so sorry I was writing the proportion for 1lb - 1.5 lb of meat. Not kg. Some blame goes to jetlag after 20+ hours of flying. But no excuses, I corrected it. The proportions I use at home are somewhat lower, onion when ground to paste is quite strong so you can adjust the amount you want to use as per your taste. I kept thinking I used lower proportion so why is there an issue then finally I figured there was a mix-up between lb and kg. We buy meat in lb in USA and I use as such, usually 1-1.5 lb every time for us and more where there are guests.\n\n\nAlso I add potatoes to my meat. 1 chunky piece for every 2 pieces.

{"title": "A guideline for cooking 13+ different types of lentil dishes. (Indian/Bengali)", "selftext": "I am listing a process for cooking 13+ variations of bengali daals, actually 15+ since I edited and added a few more.\n\n**When is it eaten and how is it served ? -** Lentils are boiled, tempered with spice either once or twice. There are some rare bengali recipes where no tempering is used. It is served with carbs - rice/ roti/phulka/ parantha/ luchi / bhatura / dosa / idli. Usually daals are part of every major meal.\n\nBengalis Thali - Daal is eaten in first course - daal, shaak (cooked leafy greens), bhaja (fritters), teto (bitter vegetables like karela or bitter gourd/ bitter leafy greens like geema/ neem shaak etc),  usually eaten first then the second course veggies (sobji or posto or dalna ) with daal followed by non veg dishes, chatni, desserts. A bengali thali is served with rice (bhaat), handmade whole wheat breads (ruti) and on special occassions with fried refined handmade bread (luchi) or triangular shallow fried bread ( tinkona porota)\n\n**Some of the Different Lentils used in Indian cuisine**\n\nWhole - Whole Moong, Masoor (whole red lentils), Chana (chickpeas/garbanzo), Yellow peas (Matar), black gram, Moat, whole Urad, kidney beans, black eyed pea,\n\nSplit - moong, urad, masoor, chana, toor/arhar, moat mogar, urad chilka, split yellow peas (Matar)\n\nAnother helpful link - [https://indiaphile.info/guide-indian-lentils/](https://indiaphile.info/guide-indian-lentils/)\n\n**Basic process**\n\na. soaking\n\n1. Soak lentils overnight for whole lentils. Soak lentils for 1-3 hours for split lentils, split chana may need more soaking upto 6 hrs.\n2. Note that soaked lentils will increase in volume, so soak in a large enough container.\n3. You can soak whole whole lentils till they sprout and use the sprouted lentil to make daal.\n\nb. Boiling\n\n1. For every cup of dry lentils, add 4-5 cups water and more if required. Boil off in case you need thicker daal. \n2. Different lentils need different time to be tender enough, split soaked daals need least time followed by soaked whole daals. Unsoaked lentils can take upto 5 times the time.\n3. In my pressure cooker it takes 2-3 whistles for soaked split lentils to be ready. For whole lentils it may take another whistle or two. In a pan it may take 20-30 minutes for split daals and another 10-20 minutes for whole soaked lentils, will depend on type of lentil, soaking time, type of water (hard/soft). Adding 1/2 tsp baking soda helps in boiling whole daals and recommended.\n4. Split Masoor/red lentils cook fastest.\n5. Suppose you haven't pre-soaked daal - boiling in a pressure cooker will definitely save your time, adding a pinch of baking soda will also help.\n6. Boil lentils with salt and turmeric.\n\nc. Tempering ( **tadka** in hindi, **phoron** in bengali) and finishing the daal\n\n1. Heat oil/ghee in a small pan, add tempering spices one by one. Common ingredients used for tempering are cumin/ nigella seeds/ mustard / curry leaves / ginger / garlic/ tomato / onion/ hing and dry spices. Not all of these are used together. The tables will give an idea of what goes with what.\n2. You may add the tempering to your boiled daal for everyday cooking **OR follow (3)**\n3. Do step c1 in a large pan and pour your hot boiled lentils into this pan and cook further.\n4. The process for cooking non veg daal is more complex not addressed here in details though I have touched upon some recipes (lamb daal/ fish-head daal, keema daal, egg-curry daal etc.)\n5. If adding veggies, then veggies are fried and bloomed with spices in c1 and then cooked in c3.\n\nd. Garnish - ghee,/coriander/kasuri methi / chillies etc. Different combinations for different dishes.\n\n**Variety of Regional daals in India**\\- Immense, there are 29 states and every state is divided into different districts and every district has some variation, every family has their own twist. I am trying to show a simplified picture of the variance.\n\nIn north India, Himalayan states - usually cumin is used along with tomato+onion+garlic and finished with kasoori methi+Coriander leaves. Some pahari (nothern India himalayan states) dishes call for yogurt in their lentils. There is a lot of use of **whole lentils, kidney beans, kabuli chana or chickpeas**, sometimes milk and/or malai is added.\n\n(Edited) West - Marwadi daals often use a mix of different lentils (5) and are spicy. Gujarati daals use mustard, curry leaves, coriander powder as basic ingredients and are sweet. Maharashtrian aamti daal is tangy, spicy.\n\nSouth - Lentil dishes from southern India use different kind of masala powders /sambar masala, curry leaves, tamarind, mustard seeds and often vegetables and shallots are added. South India means 4 different states and sharp differences from coastal and non-coastal cuisines so there are many variations, if someone knows more about it please add in the comments !\n\nEast and North East - Bengali daals are light, have very limited use of onion-garlic, sometimes tomatoes are used but not widely, we sometimes add fish-heads and in summer bitter vegetables/raw mango, in winter- winter veggies. Sometimes also cooked with Koi fish/ smelt type of small fish / boiled fried eggs. Mutton is used in some versions of whole yellow split pea curries. There are assamese daals with similarity with bengali dal but different vegetables like Jackfruits are added in different versions. Khashi daals have use of black seasame [https://aahaaramonline.com/dai-nei-iong-udad-dal-meghalaya/](https://aahaaramonline.com/dai-nei-iong-udad-dal-meghalaya/), **kinema** or fermented soy bean curry is eaten in some parts.\n\nMughlai and cuisines of different muslim communities- Cooked with minced meat or chunky meat and are rich in spices, ghee. Mughlai recipes are not homogenous, they differ from region to region / city to city.\n\nParsi - Food of the Zoroastrian/ Parsi community in IndiaCombines traditional Iranian recipes with food of western India, lentils cooked with meat and/or veggies - *Dhanshak* is a signature dish.\n\nJain recipes are made without onion garlic. Though begalis don't add onion-garlic to many of their everyday dal their food isn't jain recipe.\n\nCooking style, ingredients and recipes also differ by caste/ deeksha / sub groups in religion, and as expected by geography - coast / mountain etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bengali Daals.\n\n# medium -White oil/mustard oil.\n\nAll tomatoes are fresh and chopped roughly or cubed (not paste).\n\n***The basic tempering is Bay leaf+chillies so I am not repeating at every step, mentioned in the first row.***\n\nproportions - For every cup of dry lentils, add 4-5 cups water and more if required. Boil off in case you need thicker daal. Many Bengalis prefer thinner dal. 1 tsp of each spice and a pinch of asafoetida is enough if otherwise not mentioned, sometimes turmeric needs to be checked what amount will give you your desired color..\n\nYou can add a range of shaak to any of the daals apart from the festive versions.\n\n(**Quick fix daal in pressure cooker**\\- Temper the oil first with spices, fry for few minutes then add soaked/unsoaked dal, fry for a few minutes, cook upto 2-5 whistles depending on you daal. )\n\nNote : Adding tomato, sugar, any souring agents increases cooking time. If you add them before the lentils are tender it will increase cooking time.\n\n|**Daal (for every 1 cup dry lentil)**|Tempering - 1 Bay leaf+ 2 red chillies + 2 green chillies|optional veggies/ non-veg additions|Dry Spices and other ingredeints -turmeric is must.|Garnish|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Cholar dal** (Split Chana dal )- **It is a festive dish**.

{"title": "Indian food beyond restaurant curries ( and some guidelines and resources to make them) - Indian/Bengali/ other regional", "selftext": "I noticed a few of posts where people are wondering what's there beyond the food served in restaurants specially in the west. This post is an attempt to give an idea of the versatility and width of the Indian fare - introducing different cooking techniques, non-curry dishes and less known curry dishes. Being born and brought up in India helps but of course there's handicap of not being exposed to all cuisines as extensively as I am to my own regional cuisine (Bengali), so Indian foodies please feel free to fill in more details in your comments !\n\n**About restaurant food** \\-\n\nWhat is served depends on a lot of factors like the immigration pattern, where I live I see communities from Andhra (Southern Indian state), so the dishes are often made with typical South Indian ingredients like mustard, curry leaves. Thought the menu is heavy in North Indian dishes, they are cooked in south style :)\n\n*Ingredients* \\- very limited ingredients are used, sometimes no discernible difference from curry to curry. Some of the improvisations are to be able to court a cosmopolitan palette, some due to difficulty in procuring ingredients. Use of boneless meat is another issue, Indian food isn't made with boneless meat or boneless fish. There is a loss in texture and flavour due to smoothening out of the 'curry sauce', a traditional version is coarser and doesn't quite look like the smooth sauce.\n\nAlso there is issue with how curry is defined 'veggies/meat floating in a pool of thick sauce' is the standard Indian 'curry' while many of our dishes at home don't look like that. But this is true for even restaurants in India.\n\n**You would hardly see these vegetables** \\- Parwal/potol (pointed gourd), Ridge gourd, Bottle gourd, Pumpkin, variety of leafy greens (apart from spinach and maybe methi nothing else is served), moringa blossom, kundru, limited use of eggplant, radish to name a few. Same with spices and same with cooking techniques.\n\nActually, with due respect to Indian restaurant who are doing their bit making Indian food accessible to everyone, I must say that 'Indian-food-served-in-restaurant' is a parallel cuisine :) I do appreciate how they have given a convenient and marketable twist to traditional cuisines, toning down or dialling up where required and taking essence from at least some regional cuisines in the process.\n\n**So now getting to what lies beyond these, what about** ***non-curry style*** **Indian dishes and snacks ?**\n\n1. **Stir fried dishes** \\- Many of the side dishes in our main courses aren't 'curried', i.e, no thick gravy-sauce thing, They go by different names in different places - like bhaja/bhaji. The basic structure is - heat oil, put the tempering whole spices, fry briefly to relase flavour, then toss your raw veggie or semi-boiled and braise/ fry / saute depending on the desired outcome and type of veggie. Sometimes powdered spices are added, sometimes not. The dish can be finished off with a garnish of herbs/ grated coconut / ghee or served just right off the work without those. V**eggies used - bhindi (okra), thinly spiced pumpkin (like - fried with nigella seeds), potato, barbati, pointed gourds, sprouted lentils, cauliflower, kundru/kundri, moringa blossom** to name some.\n2. Stir fried snacks - Very closely related to the (1) family - poha, bhurjis, bhurji wrapped in flat breads. Basic **egg bhurji** \\- heat oil, temper with spices, oinions and garlic (tomatoes if you like them) - add beaten eggs, stir and fry, add your choice of powder spices, serve with garnish. Same with **Paneer bhurji** \\- instead of adding egg, add crumbled paneer and you are sorted. These are SOS meals.\n\n**Poha** \\- Poha needs a separate post may be there are so many variations. It's basically stir fried flattened rice. [https://www.archanaskitchen.com/indori-poha-recipe](https://www.archanaskitchen.com/indori-poha-recipe) is Indori variety of Poha.\n\n1. **Roll/ paratha roll** \\- This suits people who make flatbreads on a daily basis OR buy Malaysian Paratha from local south Asian /Asian store - [https://www.bongeats.com/recipe/kolkata-egg-roll](https://www.bongeats.com/recipe/kolkata-egg-roll) They are versatile and you can fill in any kind of meats, kebabs thought this is the most iconic - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34I\\_PRyaVGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34I_PRyaVGo)\n2. **Halwa** \\- Semolia cooked in a savoury or sweet style. Sweet - [https://www.cookwithmanali.com/sooji-halwa/](https://www.cookwithmanali.com/sooji-halwa/) and savoury (upma) - [https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/upma-savoury-south-indian-breakfast-recipe-made-with-semolina/](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/upma-savoury-south-indian-breakfast-recipe-made-with-semolina/). There are also other types of Halwa though - mostly sweet (carrot, pumpkin)\n3. **Rice dishes** \\- People may have had some kind of biriyani and pulao but the options are actually unlimited. Like the bengali **basonti polao** is yellow and sweet rice pulao made with short grained aromatic rice. **Jadoh** is a dish made with another aromatic short grained rice variety, pork, ginger and bay leaf. There are many varieties of biriyani not usually served in restaurants - like Kolkata style biriyani which is light and aromatic or moti biriyani (meatball biriyani) etc.\n4. **Chokha and Bharta** \\- Basically boil or roast the veggie. Then mash it with spices or mash and fry with spices. Potatoes, eggplant, bhindi, kankrol, Sheem etc. are used. Also - banana stem, banana blossom.\n5. **Steamed dishes** \\- **Dhokla/** khaman dhokla, **khandvi** are steamed chickpea four dumpling like dishes which are later drizzled with sweet or savoury condiments. Then there's idli from south and momos from Tibetan communities in India.\n6. **Pancakes** \\- Dosa is the most popular one. But there is the everyday **Cheela** which can be made with different veggies and spices of your choice, or Dosa's cousin **Uthhapam, Parasattu, Appam, Idiyappam** (more like steamed noodles though), there are sweet ones - **malpua, pooda, patishapta** and neutral ones like **Soru chakli**\n7. **Stuffed breads, fried breads** \\- Aloo/ mooli / gobi / methi etc. **parathas**, keema or minced meat parathas. **Kachauris (** green pea kochuri/ lentil kachauri) There is **luchi** (with Flour and nigella seed dough)\n8. **Chaats and puffed rice snacks** \\- There are 'wet' chaats like **Vel puri, aloo chaat, ghoogni chat, dahi vada, churmur, aloo kabli, papdi chat** etc. or dry ones like puffed rice with nuts (**muri makha / jhal muri**) and chanachur and cucumber-onion and spices.\n9. **Batter fried** \\- (**Pakodas and pakodis/ vada / bora** ) Usually a chickpea batter with spices, prepare your veggie/meat, dip it and deep fry. The consistency of batter is key, in fancier versions, the veggie/met is stuffed. Chillies, Cabbage, eggplant, potatoes, pumpkin, different leafy greens like jute leaf are batter fried.\n10. **Dry traditional snacks like Indian style trail mix** \\- C**hivda, Chanachur, murukku gathiya, nimki** \\- mainly doughs of chickpea flor/ rice flour / plain flour and other different types of flour spiced and fried.\n11. **Envelope and filling then deep fried** \\- **Samoma/Singara** (wide variety of filling- Potato, cauliflower, peas, lentils), **Chop** and **cutlets** are anglo Indian fusion dishes - fish, meat, egg, jackfruit, mixed veg, banana blossom there are many different types. ([mochar chop](https://saffronstreaks.com/recipes/mochar-chop-banana-blossom-appetizer/), [echorer chop,](https://recipebook.io/home/recipedetails/rbk_5ce824d304f4a/echorer-chop-jackfruit-cutlet-chop-are-one-of-the-famous-snacks-for-bengali-earlier-chop-are-regularly-served-as-a-starter-in-bengali-occasions) [dim er devil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOKFdGDbzCI) )\n12. **Noodles and dumplings** \\- Covered under tibetan/ North East Indian cuisine.\n13. **Stews** \\- **shorba, Rasam, Kerala style chicken stew, Kolkata style chicken stew, Nihari (marrow and red meat stew), Kadhi (chickpea flour and yogurt), raw mango stew** Stews are different from daal/ lentils in cooking style and consistency - these are light, sometimes clear soups.\n14. Drinks - aam panna, jal-jeera, tender coconut water, lassi and channch (spiced buttermilk), thandai, kokum water.\n15. Desserts and chutney - not covering here, the list would be endless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Indian Curries which are regularly made in homes but not seen in restaurants**\n\nLike I mentioned, this has to do with cooking styles not used, or ingredients which aren't used or about regional food overlooked.\n\n1. **Non veg Steamed curries** \\- Fish mixed with spice pastes, oil, chillies and container sealed and steamed. Usually a mix of poppy seed paste, freshly ground mustard and a bit of grated coconut, mustard oil, green chillies and coriander leaves. .. knocking off any one and using any two would also do. Mustard is for the kick, poppy seed as a soothing nutty mild-sweet base and coconut for the coconut-y flavour and sweetness.\n2. **Variety in lentils** \\- I made a separate post actually. Restaurants serve 3-4 types of daal where there are hundreds. [https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ky1nvr/a\\_guideline\\_for\\_cooking\\_13\\_different\\_types\\_of/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ky1nvr/a_guideline_for_cooking_13_different_types_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n3. **Leaf wrapped dishes** \\- fish wrapped in leaf then steamed or fried, can also be made with banana blossoms, paneer. **Pora or burnt** \\- leaf wrapped and semi burnt, or stuffed inside bamboo and burnt. You can use the same spice pastes as used in (1).\n4. **Fish cooking techniques not used in restaurants** \\- kancha jhol ( light gravy little to no curry base, raw fish stewed in gravy and drizzled in mustard oil) Hara-gouri - Fish one side sweet other side tangy / one side spicy the other tangy etc., leaf wrapped and fried / burnt / steamed, bharta or mashed - like Bombay duck fish. Fish cooked in ground mustard gravy, fish cooked with turmeric leaf. Also in bengali cuisine, many of our veggies and lentils are cooked with crushed bone in fried fish / fish head something not served in restaurants.\n5. **Stuffed veggie dishes** \\- Veggies hollowed out and stuffed with veg/non veg fillings. Stuffed eggplant (**Bharli vangi)**, **stuffed potato curry**, Pointed gourd [potol er dolm](https://notoutofthebox.in/2016/05/niramish-potol-er-dolma-stuffed-pointed-gourds-with-paneer/)**a**  stuffed with spiced lentils/ minced meat / [minced fish](https://foodfoodonlyfood.wordpress.com/2017/09/25/potoler-dolma-stuffed-pointed-gourd/) / chena / nuts or crumbled paneer). There are tangy spicy dishes like  bharwan Karela (stuffed bitter gourd), [bharwan bhindi](https://www.cookwithmanali.com/bharwa-bhindi/)(stuffed okra), bharwan mirch (peppers)\n6. **kofta curry /dumpling curry** \\- Restaurants only serve veg malai kofta while there are many different kofta dishes from [Nargisi](https://www.archanaskitchen.com/nargisi-kofta-curry-recipe-spicy-scotched-egg-curry) (egg wrapped in minced meat and curried) to [green banana kofta](https://www.bongeats.com/recipe/kachkola-kofta-dalna) to **Chitol er muitha** (chitol fish dumplings curried).\n7. **Bata technique** ( making paste of veggies) - Khosha bata (green veggie peels are crushed and fried/ ground) like parwal peel bata. [Kochu bata - raw mankochu](https://www.rumkisgoldenspoon.com/2020/08/maan-kochu-bata.html) (taro root) lightly steamed or raw ground to paste with spices and chillies.\n8. **Dried fish** \\- these are bengali dishes - Dried shrimp, hilsa, bombay duck etc. cooked in different styles - bharta (dry curry intensely fried), cooked with veggies or cooked in gravy with potatoes or boiled eggs. They are also many other dishes from coastal south India, Goa etc. which used dried fish.\n9. **Leafy green**s - Restaurants never use anything apart from palak/spinach, that even the tender variety and maybe some methi and mustard (?). Also restaurants grind them to paste like in palak paneer or sarson ka saag. But majority of recipes beyond punjabi recipes don't grind the leafy greens to paste. Leafy greens are called **Saag/ saak/ xak** in different regions. Variety - **Mature spinach, Mustard greens, Poi/Pui (Malabar spinach), Kalmi (Water spinach), different varieties of Amaranth - green (notey),** [red (laal notey)](https://kitchenofdebjani.com/2015/11/laal-shag-bhaja/)**, gima, jute leaves, Neem (Margo plant), dheki (fiddlehead fern)** \\- to name a few. They are usually cooked without any curry base, with potato or some other veggies or just the leaves, (not mashed), with some spices. ***A generic recipe - heat oil, add nigella seeds, chillies and minced garlic, fry and then add the chopped greens and salt, fry and cover till water evaporates and leaves are tender.***\n\nThis one has quite a few leafy green recipes - [https://nianscookingdiary.com/%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F-%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%95-%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE-pat-shak-bhaji-jute-leaves-recipe/](https://nianscookingdiary.com/%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F-%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%95-%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE-pat-shak-bhaji-jute-leaves-recipe/)\n\n1. **Veggies less used in restaurants but widely used at home** \\- What I use - **pointed gourd, bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, snake gourd, pumpkin, cabbage, drumsticks, Banana blossoms, Banana stems, young jackfruit, oyster mushroom, taro root, sweet potato, pumpkin, green banana, sheem, borboti/barbati, pyaz koli, Tinda, moringa blossoms** (not found in USA at least I haven't) **cucumber and dhudhul.**\n2. **Khichdi** \\- From different regions - from [bisibele bhat](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/bisi-bele-bath/) to bengali [bhuni khichudi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/kraii7/bengali_bhuni_khichuri_veg_no_onion_no_garlic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) these are boiled rice-lentil concoctions cooked with spices.\n3. **Modern twists** \\- [Omlette curr](https://kitchenofdebjani.com/2018/03/omelette-er-torkari-mamlette-er-torkari/)y, Soya chunk curries, mushrooms\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverlooked dishes from different regional cuisines\n\n1.

Bengali/Kolkata - [https://www.bongeats.com/](https://www.bongeats.com/) : Close to my heart and IDK where to start ! This is a delicate light cuisine based on less known flavours - nigella seed, poppy seed paste , panch phoron etc. with many less known festive dishes. Then there's hilsa and range of fish dishes. Labra, shukto, chechki, ghonto, jhal, dalna etc. are the different dishes\n4.

Tibetan - Beyond momos not much is known, but there's thukpa (noodle soups), tingmo (steamed buns), shapta, phalay to name a few.\n6. 7 North East Indian states and Sikkim - Another cuisine not recognised enough even in India, I have traveled quite a bit in these regions and the range is so wide. Sikkimese food has tibetan and Nepali influence with use of items like fermented soy beans. North Eastern states - Assamese cuisine has some similarity with bengali Khashi - tripura Arunachal pradesh has distinct traditional cuisine. Notable dishes - Jadoh, a pork-rice dish, chicken with seasame seed paste, boiled chicken etc.\n7.

Yesterday, tried something on a whim and it **worked**. It has less to do with the recipe and more with the technique.\n\nThe idea, as trivial as it is in retrospect, is to fry the dough first on a super hot skillet and then finish it under the broiler. The end result looks like this - [https://imgur.com/a/JR3q98Y](https://imgur.com/a/JR3q98Y).\n\nWent a bit too happy with the butter brush, so excuse that, but in general - crisp-ish at the bottom, bulbous in shape, pillowy-soft on the inside with a slightly scorched/browned top.\n\nThe recipe is for 8 naans, about A5-sized:\n\n* 230 ml water \n* 80 ml milk\n* 2 Tbsp yogurt\n* 3 Tbsp oil\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 0.5 Tbsp sugar\n* 2.5 tsp dry yeast\n\nMix it up, then add 470 g flour, knead for \\~10 min in the machine. The dough will be sticky. Put it into an oiled bowl and let it double in size. Oil your hands, split dough into 8 pieces, about 105-110 g each, shape them into 2 cm thick disks and put on an oiled oven tray. Each peace should end up covered in oil. Let rest for \\~ 30 min.\n\nHeat up large heavy skillet really hot. Heat up broiler in the oven and put a wire rack next to it.\n\nGently take a piece of dough and, while carrying it to the skillet, sort of rotate around and let the gravity pull it a bit into a desired shape. Fry for \\~ 1-2 min, checking the underside. Once starting to crisp up, move under the broiler. It will be firm enough to sit on the wire rack without sagging. Then just eyeball when its ready, about 1 min more or so.\n\nTake out, brush with the garlic butter.\n\n---\n\nEdit #1 - fixed the liquids.

{"title": "Week 1 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Andhra Pradesh", "selftext": "I wanted to see just how differen the cuisines are within India so I have decided to make 2 dishes from from each Indian state and territory. I though it would be fun to share my experiences of cooking them with reddit (and maybe get tips from those who cooked it before?).\n\nThe first week is Andhra Pradesh, and the dishes are mirchi ka salan and pulusu pindi. (For those wondering, I have chosen Hydrabadi biryani for Telengana.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Mirchi ka salan** is a thin peanut and coconut based curry with whole chillies that is usually served with biriyani. It was easy to make and tasted nice. I had mine with lentil rice. It looked like the pictures I saw on google, so I am counting this as a win. Though it gave me acid reflux and I had to sleep upright during the night, so I'll likely not make it again but would still have it if ever served to me. [This is what my mirchi ka salan looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/EPiNSJP.jpg)\n* **Pulusu pindi** (also called tamarind upma) is a mix of ground rice and tamarind cooked with tempered spices. I had to cooked this twice because I added too much water the first time and it became mushy. The second time looked like the pictures on google (and therefore, a win) and it also tasted nice, I had mine with a fried egg. This was my favourite out of the two dishes I made and I think I'll add this to my regular meal rotation. [This is what my pulusu pindi looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/ZyxeO6S.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy recipes were a combination of the first several links you get when you google these recipes. The mirchi ka salan doesn't change much but the pulusu pindi varied. My pulusu pindi grinded coconut with the rice, no onion or garlic. I think I'll add onion to the grind when I make it next time. This is going to take me a very long time to get through all the dishes but I am excitied!\n\nHave you tried these dishes before?

{"title": "Why is restaurant Chicken Tikka Masala better than homemade?", "selftext": "I've been working on an in-depth series on  Chicken Tikka Masala in order to make the best homemade version.  This episode is [\"Why is restaurant Chicken Tikka Masala better than homemade?\"](https://youtu.be/UA-5gkSGhB8) I hope you all can check it out and tell me what you think.  Here's what I learned:\n\nRestaurants make base gravies to develop flavor and cut curry making time from an hour to less than 5 minutes.  In the previous episode I went around London trying different restaurants Chicken Tikka Masala and came across the best one in Southall.  I asked to go to the back and see how they cook it and they let me film.  The chef, Gurjit, used two base gravies when she made Chicken Tikka Masala.  A Tomato Onion Masala and Makhani Gravy.  So I grabbed two recipes.  One from [GlebeKitchen.com](https://GlebeKitchen.com) (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) with his hotel style curry gravy aka Tomato Onion Masala, and the Makhani Gravy from Dishoom's cookbook.  What was cool about these is that I was able to make a BUNCH of recipes all week with leftover chicken tikka (Next weeks episode) and other grilled veggies I had.  I'm not going to go into the recipes of either of these as they are in the episode and can be found on the Glebe Kitchen blog if you want to go down the rabbit hole.  \n\nI did find that a great Chicken Tikka Masala has a few key ingredients.  Carmelized onions and tomatoes, fresh green chili flavor, lots of cream.  I did find that the best cream comes from nuts(cashews in my case), whipping cream (I used Mexican crema because I live in Mexico), and butter or ghee to create a sauce that is creamy but not too heavy.\n\nI'm relatively new to YouTube so if you have any suggestions in terms of the production please let me know.

{"title": "My No-Blender Butter Chicken Recipe that I've refined over several years", "selftext": "Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgItOx40Bac&feature=youtu.be\n\nPhoto here: https://i.redd.it/eoa8csxgpok61.jpg\n\nRestaurant-Style Butter Chicken: No blender, grill, oven, or overnight marination required!\n\nTL;DR: Chicken thighs don\u2019t need to be marinated for more than a few minutes, stir fry your chicken on high heat in a wok in small batches, dice your onions very fine and cook them to hell, use tomato paste instead of fresh tomatoes, and of course, abundant spices, salt, sugar, butter, and cream.\n\nThis is a recipe born out of laziness, out of wanting to make as few dirty dishes as possible for me to clean up afterwards, while simultaneously trying to replicate restaurant style cooking as much as possible. Throughout it, I also detail quite a few techniques that generally should be used for all North Indian restaurant style gravy curry dishes. Yes, some of this is not necessarily authentic, but what\u2019s important to me is that the end result tastes good. Many of the choices I make in this recipe are from countless hours of watching various videos on the same dish, hundreds of recipe blogs claiming that their version is the most authentic and tasty, and the consultation of one of my Indian friends who was taught by his aunt, a professional chef in India. Many of the ingredients are also optional and can be skipped if you do not have access to an Indian/Asian grocery store.\n\nBefore I list the ingredients, I do want to make a note of two essential cooking tools that are needed for this specific recipe. One, a large wok. And two, a gas burner stove. The reason? In lieu of having to preheat an oven, turn on the broiler, or fire up the grill for the chicken part of this recipe, I instead stir fry my chicken on high heat in small batches. This fusion of Chinese cooking technique into an Indian dish allows for an approximation of the smoky flavor that is typically desired, with much less time and effort needed to do so. Yes, I know that true butter chicken is made with leftover tandoori chicken, but I hate waiting for my oven to preheat and god knows when I\u2019ll ever fire up the grill for anything other than bbq.\n\nIngredients:\n\nChicken Marinade:\n\n\u2022\tBoneless, skinless, chicken thighs \u2013 about 8 or so. You can also use breast meat, but I would advise marinating overnight if you do so. Thighs can be pretty much cooked immediately after mixing with the rest of these ingredients.\n\n\u2022\tKashmiri red chili powder \u2013 2 tablespoons-ish\n\n\u2022\tTurmeric powder \u2013 1 tablespoon-ish\n\n\u2022\tCoriander powder \u2013 1 tablespoons-ish\n\n\u2022\tGarlic and ginger paste \u2013 2 tablespoons-ish. I actually forgot these once, for both the marinade and the gravy, and it still tasted wonderful. So, I guess they\u2019re optional?\n\n\u2022\tJuice from one lemon\n\n\u2022\tWhole fat yogurt \u2013 or curd if you have access to it. About 4 tablespoons\n\n\u2022\tSalt \u2013 to taste. I eyeball this the same way I eyeball the spices.\n\n\u2022\tGround black pepper \u2013 1 tablespoon-ish. I\u2019d advise buying a large container of whole peppercorns and grinding it with a mortar and pestle or spice/coffee grinder since it would take forever to grind out a tablespoon of pepper by hand.\n\n\u2022\tOil that can handle high temperatures \u2013 both for the marinade and for stir frying. About a tablespoon for the marinade and a tablespoon for each batch of chicken that you stir fry.\n\n\u2022\tKasuri methi \u2013 large handful\n\nNoticeably absent from this list is cumin powder. Some recipes have it, some don\u2019t, and I\u2019ve tried both. It just tastes off with cumin for some reason. Yes the MDH spice mix has cumin in it, but not to the concentration that I would normally use in a recipe like this. Also absent from the gravy ingredients below is cumin seeds for the same reason.\n\nGravy:\n\n\u2022\t2 or more large red onions \u2013 It\u2019s pretty much impossible to have too much onion in a recipe since you can always cook it down until it basically disappears. I\u2019ve made this with 4 onions before and it tasted great.\n\n\u2022\t1 stick of unsalted butter \u2013 and don\u2019t you dare use any less. In fact, use more if you have money to burn. My friend told me that when he makes dal mahkani (butter lentils) he uses even more butter than he does for murgh mahkani (butter chicken). And his dal mahkani was the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life. You really can\u2019t have too much.\n\n\u2022\tOil to supplement in case the curry gets dry while cooking.\n\n\u2022\tSmall can of tomato paste \u2013 along with the onions, this is the most important component of the gravy. You\u2019ll supplement with water to actually turn it into a gravy.\n\n\u2022\tChili, turmeric, and coriander powders \u2013 same as for the chicken. You need some to marinade and some to be bloomed in hot oil for true depth of flavor. Although I no longer bloom my spices directly in oil since they burn so easily. I instead mix them with the onions after they\u2019ve separated from the oil.\n\n\u2022\tGarlic and ginger paste \u2013 see above.\n\n\u2022\tThai bird\u2019s eye chilis \u2013 completely optional, but you can add some at the beginning for some heat.\n\n\u2022\tGaram masala powder \u2013 about a tablespoon. In many of the Indian recipes I\u2019ve read, not just for butter chicken, they all advise to bloom cumin, chili, turmeric, and coriander in the hot oil near the beginning of the recipe, except for garam masala, which was almost always advocated to be mixed in near the end when the gravy has already formed. I looked around on some forums and the consensus seems to be that one; since garam masala (in powder form at least) is already toasted and then ground up, it doesn\u2019t need to be sputtered in oil, and two: adding it near the end allows for its warmth to retain prominence in the dish rather than being cooked away.\n\n\u2022\tSugar \u2013 2 tablespoons-ish\n\n\u2022\tHalf pint of heavy cream\n\n\u2022\tSalt \u2013 to taste. Oftentimes I don\u2019t even need to add anymore since I add so much to the chicken initially.\n\n\u2022\tKasuri methi (fenugreek leaves) \u2013 large handful\n\n\u2022\tFresh bunch of coriander \u2013 Not a big deal if you don\u2019t have it, but it adds a nice freshness to the creaminess that can get overwhelming at times.\n\n\u2022\tIf you want to be more authentic, you can include the stereotypical whole spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, etc. but I\u2019ve personally never really noticed too much difference omitting them. If you do use them, crackle them in the oil before you add your onions and take them out when serving.\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with butter chicken recipes, you might also notice the lack of cashew nuts. Typically they\u2019re added to provide creaminess to the gravy, but there\u2019s already an entire bottle of cream in this thing. I find it kind of pointless. Also using them would require blending the mixture and I try to avoid using my blender as much as possible because I hate cleaning it. If you can somehow source cashew paste, then you could add a few tablespoons when you put in the tomato paste, but it\u2019s really not worth the hassle or money in my opinion.\n\nSteps:\n\n1.\tCut your chicken into bite sized cubes and throw all of the ingredients into a bowl and mix together until evenly coated. Adjust quantities to your liking, just make sure that it has a nice orange-red color and the mixture isn\u2019t too dry (More yogurt, lemon juice, or oil can help).\n\n2.\tHeat a few tablespoons of high heat oil (or ghee) in a wok on high heat over the largest gas burner you have. Make sure to turn your range hood on high as well so you don\u2019t smoke up your entire house. (Is it just me, or do Americans hate using their range hoods? Every friend\u2019s house I\u2019ve been to, no one ever uses it when they\u2019re cooking. My mom instilled in me from a very young age to always turn the range hood on high when cooking no matter what. It seems like a cultural difference between Western and Eastern cooks.) Just as the oil begins to smoke, add a small portion of your chicken to the wok so that it just covers the bottom. If you\u2019re using 8 thighs, try to do this in 4 batches. (This technique of small batch wok cooking was taken from J. Kenji Lopez Alt. and Alex French Guy Cooking. If you put in all of the chicken at the same time, you\u2019ll end up boiling it instead of searing and stir frying it which doesn\u2019t result in the same flavor profile. Stir frying is not necessary, as you could just cook everything at once, but it\u2019s the easiest way to approximate the charred smoky flavor of a tandoor/grill. If you don\u2019t have a gas stove but still want that grilled flavor, you\u2019ll have to use your oven. Plenty of recipes on how to do that online.)\n\n3.\tLet the chicken sear on a single side for about a minute. If water starts to become visible and the chicken starts to boil instead of stir fry, move the chicken away from the center of the wok to let the water evaporate. Most western gas ranges direct the flames in a circle away from the center of a pan, so the center of the wok won\u2019t actually be the hottest portion for cooking purposes. However, due to the shape of a wok, water will tend to pool in the center. Moving whatever you\u2019re cooking to the outside of the wok will both expose it to higher heat and separate it from the water which will still be touching a part of the wok that is hot enough to boil the water off.\n\n4.\tOnce you get a nice sear on one side of the chicken pieces, start stir frying by flipping the chicken in the wok with one hand and stirring with the other hand. Hopefully you should see some flames appear as the oil particles catch the direct heat of the burner. This is essential for the nice lightly charred flavor. After a few minutes, transfer the chicken to a bowl, making sure to take the wok off the direct heat so you don\u2019t accidentally burn the leftover oil. Don\u2019t worry about cooking the chicken all the way through at this point, the stir fry sear is just to increase the depth of flavor.\n\n5.\tRepeat with the remaining batches of chicken, adding oil as necessary to make sure the chicken doesn\u2019t stick.\n\n6.\tOnce all of the chicken has been cooked, return the wok to the burner and reduce the heat to medium-high. Add half a stick of butter, let it melt (doesn\u2019t have to be completely) and add your red onions, diced as fine as possible. Remember, we\u2019re not blending this, so the smaller your onion dice, the easier it\u2019ll disappear into the final gravy.\n\n7.\tCook your onions until completely brown and caramelized. This will take a long time, bare minimum of around 30 minutes. Don\u2019t turn the heat up to try and speed up the process, you\u2019ll just burn them instead. This is one of the most important steps for a great tasting gravy. You can also add your garlic and ginger paste at pretty much any point in this process, just try and make sure that they make direct contact with the hot oil rather than being thrown on top of the onions. This principle of making sure every ingredient makes contact with hot oil was taught to me by my friend, who said that the direct contact with hot oil allows for the flavor of the ingredient to permeate throughout the entire dish more strongly. He actually advocated for putting in garlic and ginger paste before the onions (as have numerous online recipes) so that the onions don\u2019t absorb all the oil before the pastes can touch it, but I\u2019ve found that this results in excessive sputtering that makes a giant mess and burns my arms. Instead, I just use enough oil/butter so that the onions can\u2019t absorb all of it. Hence, one stick of butter.\n\n8.\tAdd the can of tomato paste and mix it into the onions thoroughly for a few minutes. \n\n9.\tTurn the heat down to low and add of all the powdered spices. There\u2019ll be enough residual heat in the pan to nicely toast the spices; leaving it on medium can easily burn them if you\u2019re not careful. At this point, the oil should have somewhat separated from the onions and tomato paste, so you can toss the spices directly on top and mix together. Add oil if the mixture seems too dry. Cook for about a minute, and then begin to add water, a few tablespoons at a time. Adding about a half cup of water will turn the mixture into a very nice and homogenous red curry paste that can be used as a base for other dishes such as palak paneer, chana masala, dal makhani, or restaurant style aloo gobi. However, for this recipe, we\u2019re going to add an additional one and a half cups of water to turn it into a gravy.\n\n10.\tAs you mix the water in, the mixture will gradually change consistency from a paste to a gravy. Add more water if necessary but be careful not to add too much because you\u2019ll have to boil it off otherwise if the mixture becomes too watery. Add the chicken back into the wok and stir it into the gravy, making sure to include the accumulated juices. Turn the heat back up to medium-high and continue stewing for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\n11.\tAdd another half stick of butter and mix until completely melted.\n\n12.\tAdd the sugar and garam masala. You can also add some additional Kashmiri chili powder to enhance the color of the dish if you want. Stir until homogenous. Taste the gravy, and add more salt if necessary. I personally like additional sweetness in mine, so I\u2019ll usually add quite a bit more sugar.\n\n13.\tTurn the heat off and dump your bottle of cream in. Mix together until the gravy becomes a nice light orange color.\n\n14.\tPour some kasuri methi into your hand and rub your hands together over the gravy, letting it crumble into small pieces. Mix together one more time, and transfer to your serving bowl (or just move the entire wok to the dining table on top of a small cutting board like me because you don\u2019t want to clean another bowl).\n\n15.\tGarnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves and eat with roti, kulcha, or paratha.\n\nA small side note about eating habits that I\u2019ve noticed comparing my Indian and American friends when eating Indian food (and with Indian food Youtubers). Pretty much all of my Indian friends eat their curries with bread that isn\u2019t naan and no rice, and pretty much all of my American friends eat their curries with naan and rice. I\u2019ve adopted my Indian friends\u2019 methods, and it allows me to eat much more curry than with rice.

{"title": "A note about Curry Leaves", "selftext": "**Obligatory disclaimer:** The unqualified 'Curry' paste or powder is not a thing in Indian food. It is an umbrella term that only means something when preceded by a region/language/major ingredient. Roughly this format might work\n\n><region> <main ingredient> curry\n\nLike Malabar Fish Curry or Chettinad Chicken Curry.\n\nOftentimes, the word 'Curry' is not even used - like Rogan Josh, for example, is not Rogan Josh *Curry* though it qualifies as one technically.\n\nI was inspired by a post on the sub inquiring about the use of Curry leaves, which made me realize it is a common source of confusion owing to the naming, and lack of resources.\n\nNow to get to the matter of Curry leaves (Kariveppila in Malayalam, Karuveppilai in Tamil, Karivepaku in Telugu, Karibevu in Kannada, Metho Limbdo in Gujarati, God Nimb in Marathi, Kaddi Patta/Meetha Neem in Hindi). They are known as such because they were *also* used in kinds of curries in South India back in the British colonial times. One thing to note is that the use of Curry leaves is largely limited to South Indian cooking (Kerala, TN, Karnataka, Andhra, Telangana) and also to a lesser extent in Eastern (West Bengal, southern Odisha) and Western (Maharashtra & Gujarat) cuisine. \n\n'Curry leaves' are, in my opinion, a misnomer because it implies marriage to the curry recipes, which is not at all the case. In terms of use, it is technically more tied to region than anything else. By that I mean there are various types of curries across the length and breadth of India, but you won't find Curry leaves being used as widely in say, Rajasthan or Bihar (bear in mind there *are* many recipes adopted from the South or influenced by South Indian recipes across the subcontinent. So the phenomenon is not absent as much as it is rare). But you will find it used in places like Singapore, Malaysia, Fiji etc. because of the Tamil diaspora's influence on regional cuisines. Curry leaves are also widely used in Sri Lankan cooking.\n\nThere is a wide variety of ways to use Curry leaves like fresh leaves as-is, deep frying, shallow frying, drying & powdering etc. Being from Kerala, I am familiar with all of these except the last (powdered Curry leaves). Here are some cherry-picked uses:\n\n* [Coconut Chutney](https://ministryofcurry.com/coconut-chutney/) \\- here Curry leaves are fried in oil along with spices and used as tempering.\n* [Malabar Chicken Curry](https://www.kothiyavunu.com/2009/10/malabar-chicken-curry/) where Curry leaves are used to flavor the fat at the beginning along with sputtered mustard seeds. Also used as is to add flavor to the gravy.\n* [Chicken Chettinad](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/chicken-chettinad/) \\- fresh leaves added as-is\n* [Dried Prawns Chutney Powder](https://www.kothiyavunu.com/2009/08/unakka-chemmeendry-prawn-chutney-powder/) \\- roasted and ground up Curry leaves\n* [Kadhi Badi](https://www.archanaskitchen.com/bihari-style-kadhi-badi-recipe) \\- used as tempering\n* [Karuveppilai Sadam](https://www.mycookingjourney.com/karuveppilai-sadam-spiced-curry-leaves-rice/) \\- roasted powdered curry leaves\n\nIf you are lost or unsure as to how this magic leaf can make your cooking better, feel free to use this information. One thing I can guarantee is that it is very difficult to overuse Curry leaves. The flavor is mild and earthy, so use them liberally.\n\nAlso, do comment and correct me if you think any of this information is inaccurate - as with most Indian food related material, there aren't any comprehensively authoritative sources and everyone has a slightly different take on things.\n\n\n**Edit:** _I have been getting some great feedback on this and am trying to update the post as much as possible. Thanks and do post more recipes that use Curry leaves._\n\nHappy cooking!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/m5tyqb/a_note_about_curry_leaves/", "created_utc": 1615839846.0, "score": 185, "author": "vazhifarer", "num_comments": 111, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/m5tyqb/a_note_about_curry_leaves/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Hello again, I'm the guy that gave away all the curry tree seeds last year. How are everyone's plants doing? Pics of mine inside.", "selftext": "So I sent seeds to a few dozen people last year, I got a few followup PMs but for the most part I hadn't heard from people how they turned out.  For my part, I wound up starting about 16 plants, intending to grow them as big as possible this year to get more curry leaves for my hot sauce company.  I guess things are proceeding well enough except the plants are still way smaller than I hoped they'd be at this point.\n\nI was worried the two big ones were just dead because they dropped all their leaves and I didn't see any new growth for months.  In the past I've used either a big grow light or fluorescents to keep them alive over the winter, but this year I switched to a little clip-on double headed led grow light.  They usually start popping out some new growth soon after cutting them back and moving them inside, but not this year.  I'm not sure if the light is the reason for that or what, but thankfully they eventually came back to life.\n\nFor the one I transplanted, I mixed up some potting soil and natural wood mulch, with perlite and gravel for drainage.  I also added in some azalea food pellets, and gave them a dose of fish fertilizer.\n\nI'm hoping the babies will slowly add height throughout the summer, after which they'll get the chop, then hopefully bush out and put on some girth next spring.\n\nHere are a few pics:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/n0KTV2e](https://imgur.com/a/n0KTV2e)\n\nAnd for purely informational purposes, here's the link to my hot sauce :)  I have one made with curry leaves.

{"title": "Week 15 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Andaman and Nicobar Islands", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have finished my 15th week - the Andaman and Nicobar Islands!\n\nThe Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a union territoty that sits in the Bay of Bengal. It's closer to Malaysia than India. It has a really interesting history - controlled by so many other nations and lately given to India by the British after World War II. Please do look into it yourself if you would like to know more, I cannot do it justice here.\n\nBecause of its history, I found it difficult to find the Andaman and Nicobar Islands traditional cuisine. The dishes served at restaurants and what I can find on youtube seem to be a mix of South Indian, Bengali, and Malaysian dishes. The traditional food seem to be based on the freshness of its ingredients. This is how I chose the dishes for this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dishes I chose were macher jhol and prawn curry.\n\n* **Macher jhol** is a Bengali-based fish curry. The types of fish used are usually perch, mullet, mackerel, and more. I used mullet that I bought fresh from the fishmonger. I fried the fish and potatoes seperately before adding them to the curry base. Very simple to make and so delicious. [This is what my macher jhol looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/BGKA964.jpg)\n* **Prawn curry** is a exactly how it sounds - a curry with prawns. I again bought fresh prawns for this dish, I even de-veined and de-shelled them myself! I left the tail and head. There are many different types of prawn curry, the one I followed used butter and chillies. Again, very simple and tasty. Though it took me a bit longer than normal because it was my first time de-veining and de-shelling prawns. [This it what my prawn curry looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/LUvGa47.jpg)\n\nThe recipes I used for the above came from this [one youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@supriyabiswaslifestyleinan143). It was hard to find recipes that weren't street food or were from restaurants, so this channel is what I went by for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands cuisine. She has more recipes and general vlogs on life on these islands. If anyone has any suggestions for this cuisine, please let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next state is Odisha!

{"title": "Week 2 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - West Bengal", "selftext": "Hi again everyone, thank you so much for the interest in my cooking project! My first post got a lot more attention than I thought it would so I've written a little more this time around. I'm also going to ask for recipe suggestions for my next location (near the bottom of the post). I hope you enjoy this post.\n\nEDIT: As requested, an index for all my previous posts in this series:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy second week is West Bengal, an Eastern Indian state. The dishes I chose were daler bora and chingri posto.\n\n* **Daler bora** are lentil fritters. I made this with soaked red lentils blended with an onion, spices, and green chillies. All the recipes said to fry it mustard oil but I couldn't find any (they were out of it at my local Indian shops), so I fried it in sunflower oil flavoured with mustard seeds. This was incredibly easy to make as long as you remember to soak the lentils (I nearly forgot...). This was super delicious and so cripsy, the best way to use lentils! I saw that you can add these fritters to dal for a fuller meal. I'm definitely going to make this again, and I'll look out for the mustard oil for next time. [This is what my daler bora looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/IUMe7cQ.jpg)\n* **Chingri posto** is a prawn curry with poppy seeds. The cooking process was no different to the usual way I make curries, but I've never had poppy seeds in a curry before and let me tell you that this was a game changer. The recipe didn't have many ingredients but this was just so flavourful! The poppy seeds had a distinct nutty and sweet taste that made me fall in love with it. This also uses mustard oil so I did the same as above as a substitute. I also couldn't grind the poppy seeds properly in my grinder (blade was too big for the tiny seeds) so I guess I have to buy a pestal and mortar if I want to make posto properly. This dish still tasted great though. [This is what my chingri posto looked like (I treated myself to the fancy prawns).](https://i.imgur.com/XmiH6n3.jpg)\n\nI still can't get over how tasty the poppy seeds were, they added so much flavour. There was a lot of variations to this dish as well. Some recipes had ginger, garlic, or both. Others added potatoes or a tomato. I decided to keep it simple (with a little grated coconut) as I really wanted to taste the poppy seeds. I was originally going to make daab chingri but I couldn't find any tender coconuts. I could have bought them online but, including shipping, it was pretty expensive. I'm very glad I switched from daab to posto (though I've seen daab chingri recipes using posto as well).\n\nThe daler bora was really tasty too, such a simple dish that was comforting. The recipes I found didn't vary much, so it wasn't hard to decide the ingredients. I was originally going to cook kosha mangsho (a lamb dish) but a redditor on my last post mentioned that veg dishes are popular in West Bengal so I switched to daler bora. Again, very glad I made the switch. This is also supposed to be a good snack with tea, so I'll try it with my tea too.\n\nOne of the posto dishes I want to try is posto bora, A.K.A poppy seed fritters! What do you think of these dishes? Any more bora or posto recipe suggestions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy next location is Puducherry, a union territory boardered by Tamil Nadu in South India. I'm thinking of doing two of these dishes:\n\n* Bondas (either fish or veg filling)\n* Creole Salad (the recipe I found uses beetroot with a coconut dressing)\n* Pondicherrian Fish Assad Curry\n* Meen Puyabaise\n\nI'm leaning towards the bondas but not sure on the other one. What do you think? Any other recipe suggestions? There is such a strong French influence in Puducherry, but it's hard finding a recipe that's properly Franco-Tamil rather than just French or just Tamil, so I very much appreciate any input. I'd also love recipes for the Pondicherrian fish assad curry or the meen puyabaise as I couldn't find that many recipes for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust in case people are interested in how I decide on recipes:\n\nI search for recipes on Google and Youtube. I compare the recipes I find and decide based on common ingredients. The biggest indicator of a good recipe for me is when the recipes have the local state language somewhere in the post/video. I also search for videos in the local state language to see if the process matches the recipe I have; I do this by searching for the dish name in that language rather than the English or Hindi name (unless the local state language is Hindi too). Be wary that most, if not all, will have variations so concentrate on the common ingredients.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1662906052.0, "score": 166, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

These ingredients may also used in addition to the basic ingredients in different variations - *mace, nutmeg, caraway seeds, fennel, star anise.* Some families use cumin in their powder garam masala concoction but I have found toasted cumin to have a strong aroma so it is better to have a separate powder of toasted cumins that can be used to garnish several dishes as well as used in spiced buttermilk, chaat, raita etc.\n2. **Making the basic powder garam masala**, you can store in a airtight jar for upto 2-3 months. (2 is ideal). **Proportions** \\- This is what I use --- > 2 inch cinnamon + 20-25 cloves + 20-25 green cardamoms + 1-2 black cardamom (or 30-35 green cardamoms if there are no black cardamoms) + 10 black peppers. **Additional ingredients (in case you want to) -** if using mace then use a pinch of the dry petal, if using nutmeg use a tiny pinch, fennel also has a strong flavour and 1-2 tsp can give a strong aroma, if using star anise a tiny piece of a floret (advise not using fennel and star anise together), if adding caraway seeds (Shah jeera) 1-1.5 tsp. **Toast the ingredient**s in a dry pan till aroma is released and there is only a slight change in color, remember don't burn the spices. **Grind** the toasted spices to a fine or coarse paste. Though I shared my proportions, they vary greatly from region to region and even family to family, **Adjust proportions** as per your preference, like some like the masala more cardamom-y while some prefer more heat and add more peppers.\n3. **How to use garam masala and when to add to my Indian recipe** ? There are 3 ways of using garam masala **a) Temper oil with whole garam masalas,** add whole garam masala to oil and let the spices bloom and add flavour to oil 1-2 minutes should do (usually for 1 lb chicken 1/4 inch cinnamon + 5-8 cardamoms + 5-8 cloves + few black peppers + 1 bayleaf is enough to bloom your oil), then add your other curry bases and ingredients like onion, garlic, ginger etc. and cook as usual **b) Blend with curry base** If you are grinding down your curry base then you can add your masalas directly to the blender along with your onions and ginger and garlic and cashews etc. in case your Indian dish is curry based. **c) Adding your homemade powder garam masala -** There can be 2 occasions of adding the powder, one when braising your ingredients/cooking or just before you switch off the heat add 1 tsp garam masala with 1 tsp ghee.\n4. When to use which method of adding garam masala to Indian food - **For dishes which need strong flavours** i.e. for rich curries and meats with strong smell like **mutton** \\- use it 3-4 times, temper your oil with spices + add to curry base + a pinch of ground masala during cooking and a pinch of masala as garnish with ghee. As your curries get milder the less you need, for **chicken** say, you may add twice. For veggie dishes where garam masala is added you may use twice or once. For lentils you may use once or twice. If in a hurry, you may just use a bigger portion of the powder spice or bigger portion in the curry base. There are some dishes where the method is more complicated and you may beed a separate masala blend like in biriyani. For **pulao/pilaf,** best to add whole during tempering.\n5. Like I mentioned, no two families in India probably agree on blend of garam masala, my proportions are more in line with bengali palette. I will be happy to know different variations from different parts of the country !\n\nMy favourite method - tempering with whole spices, and adding a tiny pinch of powder masala at the end with a few drops of aromatic ghee.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/mdsc3a/a_word_on_garam_masala/", "created_utc": 1616775779.0, "score": 162, "author": "None", "num_comments": 62, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/mdsc3a/a_word_on_garam_masala/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 5 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Chhattisgarh", "selftext": "Hi again everyone! I have now finished my fifth state - Chhattisgarh!\n\nChhattisgarh is a central Indian state and also nicknamed the \"rice bowl\" of India (according to the many posts I read online when looking for dishes). I thought South Indian states would have eaten more rice than other parts of India but it looks like this central state took the crown!\n\nThe dishes I chose were bafauri and aamat.\n\n* **Bafauri** is a steamed savoury cake made with blended chana dal and spices. I found it very similar to iddli but more spicy. This is a snack that is eaten with chutney. I originally bought a mint chutney to eat with it as I've never had that before but it was so awful and threw it out. I had siracha sauce instead. A coriander chutney would be lovely with this, so I'll make that next time. I also thought that they would break apart as the batter was a little wet but after cooking it, it held its shape nicely! I just used a spoon to make these but you can use an iddli steamer or another mold to make it a nice shape. It was really tasty, glad I made it. [This is what my bafauri looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/0V5IxDI.jpg)\n* **Aamat** is tamarind based curry with chickpeas and thickened with ground rice or rice flour. You can add various vegetables to this, I added bamboo shoots and tomato. Bamboo shoot was a common ingredient but not all recipes used tomato. I used tomato because I like the flavour. Aamat was described as Chhattisgarh's version of sambhar from its Bastar region and I can definitely see the similarities. This was again tasty but I think I'll use rice flour instead of grinding the rice next time so that I don't have to remember to soak the rice. [This is what my aamat looked like (it was a little too thick because I added too much rice).](https://i.imgur.com/bkuU3gw.jpg)\n\nThere were a lot of dishes to choose from that looked super interesting from Chhattisgarh. There were so many different ways of cooking rice that I wouldn't have ever thought about. For example, there is chousela, a puri/fried bread made from rice, and phara, a stuffed rice dumpling. Clearly, Chhattisgarh deserves to be known as the rice bowl of India! The bafauri and aamat won in the end, but I will definitely try the other dishes at some point.\n\nMy next week is Gujarat. I have one dish picked - dhokla! Very excited to make that. But question: is dhokla and khaman different? The more I look into it, the more I'm unsure. I haven't decided on the other dish yet, so please do give me some suggestions!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1666516368.0, "score": 162, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 14 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Bihar", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have done my 14th week - Bihar!\n\nBihar is an eastern Indian state with some delicious dishes that are often vegetarian, where a staple ingredient is sattu - roasted gram flour. A particularly interesting part of the cuisine is the many accompaniments with meals, such as raita, pickles, chutneys, etc. I know India in general serves accompaniments, but there seems to be many more in Bihar from the recipes I've come across.\n\n  \nThe two dishes I choose were dal pitha and litti chokha.\n\n* **Dal pitha** is a dumpling made from rice flour and stuffed with spiced dal. There are many different kinds of pithas, even sweet ones, but dal pitha seems to be one of the more popular ones. Once you have stuffed the pithas, you can either boil or steam them. Once cooked, you can also quickly fry them for added flavour. I boiled mine and it turned out really tasty. More chewy than whea- flour dumplings and the dough was very sticky when I was trying to shape them. The shape of mine turned out weird and it wasn't as nice looking as the pictures I've seen. I'm sure they will get better with practice. [This is what my dal pithas looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/vqd0TL4.jpg)\n* **Litti chokha** is a dish combined of two food items: litti, which are little balls made from wheat flour and stuffed with spiced sattu, and chokha, which is a spiced mashed veggie mix. Sattu is flour made from roasted chickpeas. I couldn't find sattu in the shops so I made my own by dry-roasting chickpeas and grinding them to a powder. Although it looks like a snack, it was very filling. Mainly because the chokha I made had potatoes, aubergines, and tomatoes, *and* because I added a lot of ghee to the litti. It was a really nice comforting meal, but it is time consuming so it will definitely be something I make on a weekend or a day off. [This is what my litti chokha looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/qThzvKc.jpg)\n\nBihar was very interesting to do as I have never made such dishes before. The only time I ever have dumplings at home are cooked from frozen, so making them myself was a challenge. The litti were easier to make than the pitha because the rice flour dough was very sticky. I still very much enjoyed myself and glad I was able to do them.\n\nMy next week will be a union territory - Andaman and Nicobar Islands!

I have tried many of their dishes in restaurants and some by family friends, so I wanted to make the ones that I remember liking the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dishes I chose were rajma and Amritsari fish.\n\n* **Rajma** is made from kidney beans and a thick tomato curry base. This was simple to make and had a really nice spicy kick to it. The flavours were layered really well and was more delicious the day after I made it. I used tinned beans for this dish so I cooked this in about 30 minutes. The only problem I had was that my version was not as smooth as the pictures I found online. I likely didn't blend the onions and tomatoes well enough or maybe it's time for me to get a new blender. Either way, I would still make this again. [This is what my rajma looked like (on its own as I prepped it for my work lunch the next day).](https://i.imgur.com/wrrgP73.jpg)\n* **Amritsari fish** is difficult for me to describe because there seems to be many variants of this dish. I have seen some Amritsari fish that is similar to a South Indian fish fry, where fish is marinated in a masala paste and pan friend. Another version deep fries the fish with a masala besan batter. I chose the deep fried version because a Punjabi family friend made this for my family when I was younger, it was so tasty and I wanted to try it again. Mine also turned out tasty but not as cripsy as I would have liked. I am nervous about deep frying. I don't have a deep fryer so I used one of my pots. I was so scared an oil fire would start, I don't think my oil was hot enough to properly deep fry the fish. It also needed more batter. I still enjoyed it though, I had mine with some malabar parotta and coriander chutney. [This is what my Amritsari fish looked like (fish I used was cod).](https://i.imgur.com/06Hw0of.jpg)\n\nReally fun week to do, Punjab is such a familiar cuisine because it's so popular worldwide but it was nice seeing what authentic recipes looked like and how to make it (thanks to all the Punjabi Aunties and Uncles on YouTube).\n\nMy next week is Jammu and Kashmir, another union territory! As always, I'd love to hear your suggestions. I hear rogan josh is common here, so please let me know if this is a good dish to try!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 -  Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 8 - Nagaland](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 9 - Goa](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 10 - Telangana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/10cm8rn/week_10_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/110kmj8/week_11_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1676221667.0, "score": 156, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/110kmj8/week_11_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "PSA/TIFU: Asafoetida/Hing ist not just some magical onion and garlic substitute", "selftext": "So, as many others on here probably have, I've seen Asafoetida described as having a very onion-like flavour when cooked, and that it is often used in Indian dishes that don't feature onions to give it an onion-y flavour. I've used it in my cooking before but it was never a really present flavour. \n\nSo today I decided to make fries and decided to use some Asafoetida instead of garlic because I thought it would work out. Well, needless to say, it did not. It tasted horrible, although very Indian. It just didn't have anything to do with onions or garlic, as I've seen people describe it. It's its own flavour, that can be great when used right (ie in Indian cooking), but it's not at all the same as onion or garlic. It should be respected. \n\nJust felt like getting that out there for any other newbies like me that might make the same mistake. Or I might just be the only one stupid enough to do this, who knows... At least people can laugh at my failure then\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the nice comments and discussions! For all the people telling me to only use a pinch of Hing when cooking: I do have compounded Hing, which is mixed with some filler and turmeric, so that makes it a bit more error friendly. Still, I only used a tiny bit, so I am going to say that the flavour I ended up getting is not the result of too much Hing, but rather Hing used in a dish where it doesn't really belong.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/hobty1/psatifu_asafoetidahing_ist_not_just_some_magical/", "created_utc": 1594330338.0, "score": 158, "author": "Sad_Cena", "num_comments": 67, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/hobty1/psatifu_asafoetidahing_ist_not_just_some_magical/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 3 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Puducherry", "selftext": "Hi again! Here is my third week. This is a bit of a long post, so feel free to skip to the end to read about the dishes I made. I will also be putting up an index at the bottom my posts in case anyone wants to go back through my previous weeks.\n\nEDIT: Added my fish curry recipe at the bottom as a request.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy third week is Puducherry, a union territory in South India that was previously a French colonial settlement. The two dishes I chose were mushroom bonda and Pondicherry fish assad curry.\n\nBefore describing the dishes themselves, I need to preface it with just how hard it was to do this week (well... relatively hard since I just do this in my free time). A lot of the dishes that you find immediately on google seem to be either French dishes or Tamil dishes (as Tamil Nadu borders Puducherry). I wanted to do something specifically Franco-Tamil, but finding a good recipe was chellenging. When I went through the ingredient lists, it was all Indian ingredients and so I had my doubts whether it had any French influence.\n\nThis was when I realised I didn't know what ingredients were specifically French and after some more googling, I started to understand that the French influence in Franco-Tamil cuisine was the cooking method rather the ingredients. Now, this is just my own understanding so please do let me know if this isn't correct!\n\nI ended up choosing the Pondicherry fish assad curry (Pondicherry is the capital of Puducherry). This curry isn't specific to Puducherry, but what makes it \"Pondicherrian\" is the cooking method (from what I could tell). For example, this recipe calls for searing the fish first and then cooking the rest of the ingredients in the left-over fish oil. This is a French cooking technique that I didn't see in other assad curries that didn't specify \"Pondicherry\" in their title.\n\nThis was a very interesting journey and I learned a little about the French influence in Puducherry. Croissants and baguettes are regularly eaten here, and they have a sub-cuisine called creole cuisine! I always thought creole food was specific to the USA so this was a pleasant surprise to learn about. This was just fascinating; so much so that I went and ordered the \"The Pondicherry Kitchen\" by Lourdes Tirouvanziam-Louis. This was the only Franco-Tamil cook book I could find.\n\nA bit of an extra tidbit: there are popular dishes here influenced by Vietnamese and Malay cuisines too! I knew India was diverse, but Puducherry seems to be a true melting pot when it comes to food.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, onto the dishes I made:\n\n* **Mushroom Bonda** is a deep fried ball of potato and mushroom dipped in a gram flour batter. The reason why I picked a bonda dish was because mushroom bonda seemed to a popular street food in Puducherry. This particular bonda is also different to the \"normal\" bonda you find in the rest of South India. Usually, bondas are just deep fried dough made with maida. Puducherry bondas seemed to have a filling (i.e. fish, meat, veg) that is dipped in gram flour before deep frying. Now, I could not find a recipe for the mushroom bonda so I made my own based on the descriptions of the popular Puducherry street food. (If anyone is interested in making it themselves, my recipe is below for you to use and change to your own tastes.) This dish was nice but I think my filling got too wet. I didn't cook the mushrooms prior to the deep frying so I think the water in them came out when deep frying and they didn't hold their shape very well. [This is what my mushroom bondas looked like (please don't be too harsh, they still tasted nice despite their look!).](https://i.imgur.com/R96J6ln.jpg)\n* **Pondicherry Fish Assad Curry** is a fish curry made with a coconut and posto (i.e. poppy seed paste) base. I was excited to find out that I could use my poppy seeds again! This dish was super tasty and so easy to make. It also uses biriyani spices, which really brought out the lovely flavours of this dish. I didn't have much time to cook this (mainly because I was hungry and getting impatient), so I didn't brown the onions enough nor cook down the tomatoes enough. It was still great though. I'll make sure not to be so impatient next time, cooking the onions and tomatoes longer definitely make a difference. [This is what my Pondicherry fish assad curry looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/LbJTYn2.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy next week will be Manipur, a Northeastern Indian state. So far, I am thinking of Manipur kangshoi. I still need another dish. Any recommendations or dishes typical of this state? Happy to replace kangshoi with something else too, if suggested. Let me know what you think! Thanks for reading my posts :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My mushroom bonda recipe** (no measurements because I did not record that):\n\n1. Mix the following to form the filling: *mashed potatoes, muchrooms, red onion, peas, mint leaves, coriander leaves, green chillies, garlic, ginger, kashmiri chilli powder,* and *salt*.\n2. Make a thick batter with *gram flour, rice flour, salt, turmeric powder,* and *kashmiri chilli powder*.\n3. After forming the mushroom filling into balls, dip them into the batter and deep fry them until golden.\n\nI recommend cooking the mushrooms before mixing into the fillings to make sure the balls keeps their shape.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Pondicherry Fish Assad Curry** (again, no measurements):\n\n1. Marinate the fish (*any firm fish*) in *salt* and *turmeric powder* for 30 minutes.\n2. Sear the fish in a pan and set aside.\n3. Fry the following whole spices for 1-2 minutes in the same pan: *cinnamon, bay leaf, cloves,* and *aniseed*.\n4. Add in *red onion* and *green chillies*, fry till onions have browned.\n5. Mix in *ginger and garlic paste*, fry for a minute.\n6. Add in *turmeric powder, kashimiri chilli powder,* and *fenugreek powder*; fry until raw smell of spices are gone (1-2 minutes).\n7. Mix in *tomatoes* and cover until tomatoes have softened (enough to mash them easily, about 5-8 minutes).\n8. Add in *coconut milk (or coconut paste)* and *posto* (i.e. poppy seed paste), and simmer covered for 10-15 minutes.\n9. Add the fish back in, cover, and simmer until fish has cooked through.\n10. Sprinkle *coriander leaves* and *lime juice*.\n\nThis recipe is a combination of the recipes I found online, plus a lot of Franco-Tamil articles claiming that it isn't Pondicherrian unless there is posto in it. But I have seen recipes using almond paste or cashew paste instead. So feel free to adjust this recipe to your tastes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1664122639.0, "score": 155, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This project came to just under \u00a350. (\u00a349.09 to be precise although prices may change through the season and go up or down)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe heat for a tandoor was traditionally generated by a charcoal or wood fire, burning within the tandoor itself, thus exposing the food to live fire, radiant heat cooking, and hot-air, convection cooking, and smoking in the fat and food juices that drip on to the charcoal. Temperatures in a tandoor can approach 480 \u00b0C (900 \u00b0F), and it is common for tandoor ovens to remain lit for long periods to maintain the high cooking temperature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis build, links for all the materials, tips (including subscribers additional tips) can be found at [https://thecurrykid.co.uk/how-to-build-a-tandoor-oven-at-home-for-under-50/](https://thecurrykid.co.uk/how-to-build-a-tandoor-oven-at-home-for-under-50/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Video**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://youtu.be/6WDIRpGaidY](https://youtu.be/6WDIRpGaidY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Materials**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1 x 85 litre metal bin with closed lid\n* 2 x terracotta stone flower pots 30cm\n* 1 x terracotta stone flower pot dish stand\n* 50 litres of perlite or vermiculite insulation\n* 7 paving blocks or bricks \n* fire cement (very small pot)\n* few handfuls of stones or pebbles\n* small oven tray to collect charcoal debris\n* long flat metal skewers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Tools Required**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* electric drill\n* masonry drill bits (i used DeWalt extreme masonry)\n* disc cutter or saw\n* hole cutter (optional)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## How To Construct Your Home Tandoor Oven**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can complete your tandoor build in under 1 hour without rushing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Drill the holes required for ventilation and debris removal\n2. Using a hole cutter, or by drilling lots of small holes in a circle cut out a 6-10 cm hole in the centre of them metal bin. This is where the ventilation will rise and debris will drop into your collection pot.\n3. Place the plant pot on a suitable surface and drill 6 or more ventilation holes around the centre. I used a 4mm bit followed by 8mm then 10mm to ensure the pot didn\u2019t crack.\n4. Now place the drilled plant pot centre onto the saucer and using a pencil mark the position of the holes. Remove the pot and drill matching holes in the saucer. For the centre hole I used a hole cutter but again you can drill a number of small holes in a circle then gently tap out.\n5. Mark a line around the bottom of your other pot around 4cm from the base. Using either a disc cutter or saw carefully cut around the edge until they separate. Don\u2019t try to cut straight through in 1 go but go around the edge making a deeper cut each time. My dad cut this using a disc cutter for me and recommends you wear eye protection and some sort of face mask and ear defenders as he said it was extremely loud and dusty.\n6. Start by placing your debris tray on the floor where you want your home tandoor then place 4 blocks or bricks around the sides and back to steady the bin.\n7. Place your bin on top of the blocks and make sure you have enough room to remove the debris collection tray and that the bin is secure and cannot fall forward.\n8. Place 3 of the blocks or bricks in a triangle pattern in the base of the bin. Make sure they are touching each other and do not cover the ventilation / debris hole.\n9. Add a handful of stones or pebbles around the back of all the blocks to secure them. Make sure they come to the top of the blocks but are as level as possible\n10. Place the saucer in the centre of the blocks ensuring the centre hole is over the cut-out in the bin itself\n11. Place the first flowerpot with the holes drilled in it on top of the saucer and align the holes\n12. Fill the sides with the Perlite or Vermiculite insulation to about 5 cm below the top of the pot. This just ensures it\u2019s held steady so far.\n13. Add a small bead around the top of the pot. This simply helps to keep things together and ensure the heat doesn\u2019t escape through any big gaps in the pots\n14. Place your last flower pot upside down (with the end you have cut facing up) and press carefully into the oven cement, make sure both pots are perfectly aligned. Fill the outside with more Perlite or Vermiculite insulation and tap the sides gently to settle into all the cracks. If you have used oven cement smooth off any excess inside for a neat finish.\n15. Season the inside of the tandoor by mixing some oil (any kind will do) and coating the top half inside, you can also add a little yoghurt if you have some. This will dry as you do your first warm up and seal the top to allow for things like your naans to be removed easier. You could also use a wash of salt and water. After priming heat your oven for around 6-8 hours on full and everything will be well sealed. Nans will not fall off into the coals yet will not stick so much you cannot remove them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re good to go so now it\u2019s time to prime your oven ready for use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first time a tandoor is used, the temperature must be gradually increased to condition the interior of the oven. This step is crucial in ensuring the longevity of the tandoor. Conditioning can be done by starting a very small fire and slowly adding fuel to gradually increase the amount of heat inside the tandoor. Hairline cracks might form during conditioning; this is normal and will not interfere with the performance of the tandoor oven. When the oven cools off, the hairline cracks will barely be noticeable. They are essential in allowing the clay body of the tandoor to breathe (thermal expansion and contraction). The slower the temperature inside the tandoor is increased during its first use, the fewer hairline cracks will develop. For the first warm up use about 6 lumps of lump wood.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve done your initial heat up and allowed it to cool down you\u2019re good to go. Load up with your coals and enjoy. Sit back, enjoy and become the envy of all your friends.\n\nTake care though as these throw out some real heat. My laser thermometer cut out at 500 Celsius saying MAX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Priming your oven for first use**\n\nThe first time a tandoor is used, the temperature must be gradually increased to condition the interior of the oven.

You can add your lumpwood charcoal directly into the base, light with a natural firelighter such as wood wool and allow to grey over before cooking. I find it easier to use a \u201cBBQ starter chimney\u201d to stack up the charcoal first and then empty into the tandoor once glowing hot. You can place the end of your skewers directly onto the coals if required, or use the lip inside the first flowerpot 1/2 way up the tandoor. I would recommend at least 50cm flat skewers and that you wear a glove at all times when using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Where to buy (UK)**\n\nA list of items updated frequently is available an the main build page at [https://thecurrykid.co.uk/how-to-build-a-tandoor-oven-at-home-for-under-50/](https://thecurrykid.co.uk/how-to-build-a-tandoor-oven-at-home-for-under-50/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/nxba2q/how_to_build_a_tandoor_oven_at_home_for_under_50/", "created_utc": 1623401432.0, "score": 154, "author": "thecurrykid-co-uk", "num_comments": 43, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/nxba2q/how_to_build_a_tandoor_oven_at_home_for_under_50/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

My coworker told me I should try it because it\u2019s good. Plus, you might know a popular YouTuber named Bald and Bankrupt. He comes to India a lot and makes videos of him eating Indian food. I played one of his videos where he was eating a flat bread that you dip in some kind of green curry and showed it to the waiter and told him I wanted to try that. And I also ordered a goat biryani. Ordered both in mild spice because I\u2019m not really built for spicy food as much as I love the taste. I was blown away. They were very good. The spice was just enough that I can enjoy the meal. I love the biryani and I really loved the bread. I asked myself why I waited so long to try Indian food. It was a lot of food but I didn\u2019t eat all day and I just got done with the gym so I devoured it all. I probably will be eating Indian food from now on at least once every paycheck.

{"title": "Cuisine of the week: Gujarati Cuisine", "selftext": "---\n##This week on regional cuisine /r/IndianFood will be exploring Gujarati cuisine!\n--\n##Check our [Archived Cuisine of the Week threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/wiki/location#wiki_our_regional_cuisine_threads)\n\n---\n\nGujarati Cuisine refers to the cuisine of [Gujarat, a state in western India](http://i.imgur.com/hTPL8lP.png). Despite having an extensive coastline providing wholesome seafood, it is primarily a Lacto-vegetarian state due to the influence of Jainism and Vaishnavism. Many communities ,however, do include seafood, chicken, and goat in their diet.\n\nPopulation of Gujarat is mainly vegetarians, due to the influence of Jains and Buddhists except the Parsis and Boras. Boras are very famous for their meat preparation. \n\nJains are the vegetarians who don't use onions and garlic in their dishes. In Gujarati cuisine, there is extensive use of millets, jaggery, vegetables, roots and grains. \n\nGujarati cusine has special place all over India. Gujarati cooking consists of dal, bhaat (rice), vegetables, chapatis, kachumbar (mixed vegetables salad), papad and curd. Gujarati food is nourishing and balanced. Snacks like dhokla, khandvi, sweets like basundi are famous for its taste. Including in this Gujarati staples are wheat, millet (jowra), coarse millet (bajra), and pulses of gram, pigeon pea (tur), and black gram (urad).\n\nIn our normal household, our typical Gujarati meal looked similar to [this.](http://i.imgur.com/DgCccWk.jpg)\n\nThe [typical Gujarati thali](http://i.imgur.com/IeNp3Ae.jpg) consists of: \n\n- a glass of chaas (butter milk)\n- Rice and wheat (chapati/roti)\n- 1 variety of dhal\n- kadhi\n- two or three types of pulses or whole beans (whole beans (called kathor in Gujarati) such as mung, black eyed beans)\n- vegetables\n- a snack item (farsaan) like dhokla, pathra, samosa etc.\n- sweet (mishthaan) like mohanthal, jalebi, doodh pak etc.\n- chutney and [pickles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_pickles)\n- papad\n\nGujarati cuisine varies widely in flavour and heat, depending on a family's tastes as well as the region of Gujarat to which they belong. Salt, sugar, lemon, lime, and tomato are used frequently to prevent dehydration in the areas of Gujarat, where temperatures reaches 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F) in the shade. \n\nGujarati\u2019s generally add sugar or jaggery to some of their sabzi/shaak and dal dishes. The sweetness and the sweet flavor of these dishes is the main factor to neutralize the slightly bland taste of the vegetables.\n\nNorth Gujarat, Kathiawad, Kachchh, and Surti Gujarat are the four major regions of Gujarat that contribute their unique touch to Gujarati cuisine. \n\nFarsans (or snacks) form the essential part of the Gujarati diet. They are consumed along with the meal or alone as snack. Kachoris, papads, etc are examples of Farsans.\n\nVaghars give the food a distinctive flavor. Asafoetida is used in all vaghars as it helps to reduce the gas in the body. \n\nMain dishes are based on steamed cooked vegetables with different spices and dals that are added to a vaghar. Vaghar is a mixture of spices sterilized in hot oil that varies depending on the main ingredient.\n\nUse of pickle is also a must in this cuisine. They are used as optional savory when adding to rice or to give that extra spice or bitterness. \n\nIndian pickles, which have a wide range of flavours and textures. Indian pickles are generally pickled with oil, vinegar, lemon juice or water. \n\nMy personal favorite pickles are cutted/shredded sweet mango pickle [Chuundo](http://i.imgur.com/QE3EsAb.png) and Mango mixed with chillis which gives bitter/sweet taste [mango-chilli pickle](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RBqpXReEL._SY300_QL70_.jpg)\n\nGujarati\u2019s are expert in making seasonal food, E.g, In summer, when mangoes are ripe and widely available in market, then Keri no Ras (fresh mango pulp) is often an integral part of the meal. Not only this, but also spices are being changed as per the season. E.g, Garam Masala and its constituent spices are used less in summer.\n\nRegular fasting and daily diets limited to milk, dried fruits, and nuts are very common. Bhakri ki roti (thick roti) made of wheat flour, garlic chutney, onion, and chaas is a popular meal in many villages situated near Saurashtra. It is a good source of energy for low-income villagers who are working very hard in their fields during cold days.\n\nAs per the time changed, some Gujaratis have changed their taste as well and they now become increasingly fond of very spicy and fried dishes. There are many chefs who have come up with fusions of Western and Gujarati food. Gujaratis are predominantly vegetarians even though some people likes to eat non-veg and some pockets of the state consume chicken, beef and fish.\n\nSome famous sweet dishes and desserts are made with local sugarcane, jaggery (a solid made from unrefined cane sugar), milk, almonds, and pistachios. And they are most often served served at weddings and family occasions as an instant energy booster for relatives who are traveling long distances to attend.\n\nIf you will ask Gujaratis about their recommendation, they will often refer Dal-Bhat-Rotli-Saak as their standard, everyday fare. They generally served this exclusive Gujarati dish on their special occasions.\n\nIf you have ever seen Gujarati Thali, then you might remember the number of items placed on their Thali. Gujarati Thali contains a dozen or more separate items. Dietary rules dictate the acceptable combination of dishes. For example, if kadhi is to be served, then a lentil preparation such as chutti dal, vaal, or mug ni dal will also be included.\n\nThe sweet dish accompanying kadhi will likely be milk or yogurt\u2013based, like doodhpak or shrikhand. However, a yogurt-based raita would not be served with such a meal. Festive meals based on dal will typically have a wheat-based sweet dish like laasi or ladoo as the sweet accompaniment.\n\nMany Gujarati families make and consume moong dal in their diet on Wednesdays. Similarly, there are established combinations of spices, thought to facilitate digestion, that are used with different foods.\n\nIn coastal Gujarat, the Kharwa community has developed a cuisine consisting of fresh and dried fish. The most widely relished varieties of seafood are pomfrets, khandwas, gedadas, surmai, prawns, crabs, lobster. and narsinga (calamari).\n\nIf you would like to learn more about Gujarati food, [Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_cuisine) entry would be a good place to start.

{"title": "Week 8 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Nagaland", "selftext": "Hello again! I am now on my 8th week - Nagaland.\n\nNagaland is a north-eastern Indian state with plenty of mountains and strongly showcases its various tribal cultures. Nagaland was very interesting to learn about and you can really see a smooth blend of typical Indian and Eastern Asian cooking styles.\n\nIt was also difficult because there were many ingredients that I couldn't access. A lot of their dishes used fermented ingredients, such as axone (fermented soybean) which was difficult to get (a similar situation to when I looked for ngari for Manipur week). Such a shame because I love fermented food! I did have a question though - is axone the same as Chinese fermented tofu? I have access to the fermented tofu in my local shop but it doesn't look the same as the pictures of axone I saw online. If it is, I can make the other Nagaland dishes that uses axone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dishes I chose from Nagaland were pork pickle and amrusu:\n\n* **Pork pickle** is a popular type of spicy meat pickle that's made with very few ingredients. There are several variations of this recipe, and I used sichuan pepper in mine. I found a recipe that used dried bamboo shoots but I couldn't find them. That recipe looked delicious so I will make that version one day if I ever find dried bamboo shoots. Although the Nagaland pork pickle uses few ingredients, it uses large quantities. I think this is key for a great meat pickle. I used 5 inches of ginger, for example, so this pickle has a very strong flavour (which I loved). Though, mine doesn't look like the pictures I saw online. Maybe I should have cooked it longer or maybe I used the wrong type of pork (smoked pork in the UK is likely different to smoked pork in Nagaland). But mainly I think I didn't use enough oil. The recipe I followed said that I shouldn't need to add extra oil as there should be plently from the pork but I guess my pork wasn't fatty enough! It was still tasty though. [This is what my pork pickle looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/aPJSCGE.jpg)\n* **Amrusu** is a spicy rice porridge with chicken. It's a traditional comfort dish from the Ao tribe in Nagaland and it is also made with very few ingredients. I severly underestimated the spice level though. I used Naga chillies in the pork pickle but that wasn't too spicy so I used more in the amrusu. That spice level was my limit. It was so tasty but the spice really built up and I ended up having ice cream afterwards to calm my mouth! I just need to add less Naga chillies next time. I still recommend this recipe though. It's simple to make, comforting, and tasty - perfect for the cold weather. I had mine with some salted courgette and ginisang bagoong (Filipino shrimp paste). [This is what my amrusu looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/97f4aup.jpg)\n\nNagaland was fun to learn about and I loved how the recipes were so simple yet packed so much flavour. I'm starting to learn that you don't necessarily need onions, ginger, or garlic to get lovely meals! Just good quality ingredients cooked properly and made with love <3\n\nI would also like to note that Indian pickles are different from Western pickles. Indian pickles are generally perserved with plenty of oil and spices while Western pickles are generally perserved with brine and vinegar. So if anyone wants to make pork pickle themselves, please note this difference!\n\nMy next week is Goa! As always, I welcome any suggestions. I've had Goan food before but never made it myself, so very excited!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 -  Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1671395703.0, "score": 150, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 33, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Mughlai Paratha recipe - my favorite weekend breakfast growing up, basically a scrambled egg empanada, but Indian", "selftext": "[Full Recipe](https://timmitime.com/mughlai-paratha/)\n\nAs you guys know I post my family\u2019s recipes on my mom\u2019s food blog. Here\u2019s one of the recent ones. This one\u2019s kind of simple since the necessary ingredients are probably already in your house! I highly recommend trying it out!\n\n\nIngredients\n\n* 1 cup all purpose flour\n* 3/8 cup water\n* 1 tbsp oil\n* 1/2 tsp salt\n* 2 eggs\n* 1/8 medium red onion chopped\n* 1/8 medium tomato chopped\n* 1 green chili optional\n* 2 tsp cilantro chopped\n\nInstructions\n\nDough\n1. Mix the flour, 1/8 tsp salt, 2 tsp oil and mix.\n1. Add water incrementally until the dough is combined, cohesive, and soft. That took me about 2/8 cup of water, but your mileage may vary.\n\nFilling\n\n1. Beat eggs in a small mixing bowl.\n1. Add onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and green chilis. Stir to combine.\n\nAssembly\n\n1. Heat a pan on medium heat. Ideally the pan should have a slight dip in the middle so the egg doesn't spill out.\n1. Grease the pan with a 1/4 tsp oil.\n1. Separate the dough into balls, each about 1.5-2 inches in diameter.\n1. Roll out a dough ball to a circle about 7-8 inches in diameter. If the dough feels sticky, use some extra flour to flour the work surface and rolling pin or dust the dough with some flour.\n1. Lay the rolled out dough on the pan.\n1. Pour half the egg mixture into the middle of the dough.\n1. Lift one side of the dough and fold it over the egg mixture onto the other side of the dough, folding the dough in half.\n1. Press down on the dough where the two sides meet with a fork to crimp them together and ensure the dough doesn't open up.\n1. Allow each side of the dough and the egg inside to cook. Add oil to grease the pan if needed between flips. Each side takes about 2 minutes to cook. You should see the filling expand as the egg gets cooked.\n1. Once cooked through, remove from heat and eat hot and fresh! We like eating it with some ketchup.\n\n\n\nThe video for this will be up soon on the [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCrMJ7T6LmQDdw9dJz0EvKnQ) soon!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/kkzepj/mughlai_paratha_recipe_my_favorite_weekend/", "created_utc": 1609053374.0, "score": 146, "author": "timmi_time_", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/kkzepj/mughlai_paratha_recipe_my_favorite_weekend/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 10 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Telangana", "selftext": "Hi everyone! This week was Telangana! My gosh, I am in the double digits now - 10!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--Important edit--\n\nI am rightfully getting comments that the Hyderbadi dishes I chose more represent Andhra than Telengana. To clarify,  I'm cooking based on geographical location (i.e. state) rather than cultural-related cuisine. I don't know enough about all the cultures of India to confidently differentiate between the different cuisines. This is why I choose Hyderbadi dishes for Telengana.\n\nI get why people may be displeased about my choices. Cultural identity is an important part of a person and a community. I 100% understand this and it's partially why I am doing this recipe series - I am an Indian brought up in the West and now I want to learn more about my own culture. It also gets a bit difficult picking dishes from South India because I am Keralan but I want to try new things and a lot of South Indian dishes are similar.\n\nWhile I still will move forward with picking dishes based on geography rather than culture, I still want to acknowledge the cultural aspects of the dishes. I am happy to be informed about any of the food I make, it's what makes this fun.\n\nSo if you would like to try dishes from Telangana cuisine rather than Hyderbadi cuisine, please look into the following:\n\n*  Roti made with millets or jowar\n* Tamarind dal\n* Sarva pindi (a type of flatbread/pancake)\n* Malidalu (type of laddu)\n* Sakinalu (crispy rice flour snack)\n\nThere are so many more tasty looking dishes, please have a search yourself!\n\n\\--End of edit--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelangana is a south Indian state, famous for its films as well as its cuisine. Much of their cuisine involves tamarind, chillies, and nuts (like peanuts and cashews). During my search of Telangana dishes, I discovered the GI tag system, which indicates a specific geographic origin and associated standard of quality. Darjeeling tea was the first GI tagged item in India, and others include Kashmir saffron and Mysore silk. Very intersting!\n\nMany of the dishes I found for Telengana were associated with Hyderbad, which is described as a mix of Mughlai and Middle Eastern cooking. Of course, Telengana has other dishes seperate from Hyderbad cuisine but I have heard so much of Hyderbad dishes and wanted to try them myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dishes I chose for Telangana were Hyderbadi haleem and biriyani.\n\n* **Hyderbadi haleem** is a multi-grain, multi-lentil, and mutton dish. It's also a GI tagged dish, but it is very unlikely that mine would meet its quality standard. Haleem is a filling and comforting dish that is easy to make but takes a long time. I cooked the marinated mutton until it was tender (about an hour) and cooked the grains & lentils seperately until it was mashable (also about an hour). I then mixed them together until it was well combined and slid right off my spoon (about 20m). It was delicious and I had mine with chapati. I tried to make mine look fancy by decorating it with cashews and fried onion. [This is what my Hyderbadi haleem looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/oHkpptG.jpg)\n* **Hyderbadi biriyani** is one of the most famous dishes from India and what makes it special is the cooking method. This type of biriyani cooks semi-cooked rice and raw meat together, which can be difficult to do. While my biriyani was tasty and the meat was cooked properly, there was still some water left at the end of the cooking and my rice was too moist. I'm still happy with it though since it was my first time making it and I can definitely improve it next time as I know how to fix my mistakes. I made chicken biriyani and ate it with some mango pickle and papadams. [This is what my Hyderbadi biriyani looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/dO25Mng.jpg)\n\nTelengana was great to do and learn about, but it was an expensive week for me as I had to buy both mutton and saffron. I also decided to treat myself and buy chicken from the butchers instead of the supermarket. It was worth it though and I'm really glad to have made the above dishes. Especially the haleem. I have never had haleem before and it was such a great meal to have. Its very good for batch cooking so perfect for me to make on the weekend and have leftovers for the rest of the week.\n\nMy next week is Punjab! Many dishes to choose from, so I'd love any suggestions you may have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo note, I am expecting to have wrist surgery next week and so my next post will be delayed until I can use my wrist again (just in case anyone is curious about the delay).\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 -  Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 8 - Nagaland](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 9 - Goa](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/10cm8rn/week_10_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1673795807.0, "score": 149, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 36, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/10cm8rn/week_10_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 6 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Gujarat", "selftext": "Hi everyone, this week was my 6th week - Gujarat!\n\nGujarat is a western state on the coast of India. I noticed that sugar (mostly jaggery) is added to many savoury dishes and I found that it's because of the climate and the water. Now, I don't know how true this is, so let me know if there is another explanation!\n\nThe climate in Gujarat is very hot and can be very humid during monsoon, so Gujarati ancestors would add sugar to their food to avoid dehydration. The water is also apparently saltier than normal, so sugar was added to food to alleviate the saltiness. This resutled in the people developing a taste for sweeter foods in general, giving us the lovely sweet and tangy Gujarati food we have today. Pretty interesting!\n\nNot all of Gujarat has a sweet cuisine. I found that certain regions prefer very spicy or very savoury food and don't use sugar at all. So if you don't have a sweet tooth, you'll find still find Gujarati dishes that you like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dishes I chose for Gujarat were Gujarati dal and nylon khaman.\n\n* **Gujurati dal** is both spicy and sweet, at least the one I made. There are different kinds of Gujarati dal and I don't know if the one I made has a name, but it seems to be common. I used toor dal that was cooked with peanuts, kokum, and jaggery. All the recipes blended the dal too, which was new to me. My first bite was very strange because it felt like I was eating a spicer version of parippu payasam, which is a lentil dessert made with coconut milk and jaggery. But, the more I ate it, the more I liked it. The tanginess from the kokum and the crunch from the peanuts also made it very tasty. The reason I picked this dish was because I only ever cooked one type of dal before and I was interested to see what a sweet dal would be like. Plus, I wanted to use kokum. Instead of kokum, you can use lemon juice or tamarind for that tangy, sour taste. I ate mine with chapati. [This is what my Gujarati dal looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/7N0zokS.jpg)\n* **Nylon khaman** is a steamed savoury cake made from gram flour and topped with a thin, spicy syrup. I was initially going to make dhokla, but the recipes I found really confused me regarding their names. Some called it dhokla and others called it khaman.  A comment on my[ previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/comment/itg0nrg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for Chhattisgarh explained the difference between dhokla, khaman, and nylon khaman (thank you!) and I realised that I chose a recipe for nylon khaman. The ingredients are different, but the cooking method is the same. Nylon khaman is made with fine gram flour while khaman uses ground chana dal, and dhokla uses ground rice and urad dal. I was worred that my nylon khaman wasn't going to turn out nice because I tasted the steamed cake before I added the syrup and it tasted plain. But the syrup really elevated it and it ended up being super tasty! I ate mine with leftover mango curry, which went really well with it. [This is what my nylon khaman looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/lUSfAQL.jpg)\n\nGujarat was fun to do, the use of jaggery in savoury dishes and blending the dal were new to me. I now have another dal recipe and a steamed recipe so my steamer can *actually* be used more than once a year!\n\nMy next week is Delhi, India's capital union territory. This is going to be difficult to do because Delhi is a melting pot of various of Indian cultures. I know Delhi street food is very popular and I've also heard its cuisine being called Mughlai cuisine. So, anyone from Delhi, I would love suggestions for Delhi. I am already overwhelmed with what to pick!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(P.S. - Just in case there are people may wonder: I will be away for a while, so my next post will be delayed.)\n\n(P.P.S. - I am still looking for ngari, a fermented fish ingredient, so that I can re-make Manipur kangshoi.

{"title": "The easiest way to make rice that I picked up recently and has been a game changer. ", "selftext": "Growing up, my mom made rice in a pressure cooker. Due to a variety of reasons and experiences that both my mom and I had, I don't think pressure cooker is a great way to make rice. It is very easy to mess up and make the rice too mushy or hard and borderline uncooked. Sometimes the rice would even be scorched and stick to the bottom.\n\nThe other common way to make rice was to simply boil the rice like how you boil an egg and just drain the water off. This would be foolproof but would end up in having one more dish to wash (colander or strainer).\n\nThis new method of mine is actually from the book 'Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking'. It's quite simple and results in rice that's exactly the way I like.\n\n1. Put however much rice you want into a pot. Wash it a few times.\n2. Fill it with just enough water so that your first crease in your index finger will be submerged (distal interphalangeal crease).\n3. Keep the stove at max heat and wait until the water begins to boil.\n4. Keep the stove to the least heat level, put a lid on and set a timer for about 15 mins.\n5. Take it off the stove, fluff the rice and if you notice some water still left at the bottom, just keep it aside for some more time. The rice will absorb the water.\n6. You now have rice cooked to perfection.\n\nWhat I like about this is that I don't have to constantly check if it's done or count the number of whistles. I can just set a timer on my watch and come back later.\n\nI'm not saying this is a very novel method; it is just new for me. This finger trick has been used by women in families for ages but the book actually goes into the science behind why that works, and why rice:water ratio doesn't scale up in bulk quantities.\n\nEdit: for the people saying 'rice cookers exist', I get it. It may be a common thing in the West but as an Indian, I have never seen it in any Indian kitchen I've been to. It is not at all common in Asia to have one.

{"title": "Week 9 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Goa", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I've now completed week 9 of my Indian cooking journey - Goa!\n\nGoa is a western costal state in India, a popular national and international holiday destination because of its beautiful beaches and relaxing vibe. Goan food is a wonderful mixture of Portugese and Indian cuisines. It seems to be a fish and meat heavy cuisine according to the dishes I cam across when I looked into Goa. But if you have any nice Goan veg dishes you like, please let me know!\n\nGoan cuisine also has strong tangy flavours as tamarind, kokum, and vinegar are used in many recipes. A particular ingredient I found interesting was toddy vinegar, a.k.a coconut vinegar. I know toddy as either a hot whisky cocktail or as a local coconut liquor. I couldn't my hands on toddy vinegar for the recipes I tried but I am not on the look out for it!\n\nThe dishes I chose for Goa were recheado fish fry and sorpotel.\n\n* **Recheado fish fry** is a simple dish where fish is fried in a masala paste. There are various ways to make the masala paste but the one thing it should have is a lot of chillies! Now, the recipe I used said to use 20 red chillies. What I didn't realise was that the recipe called for red kashmiri chillies. I used \"normal\" red chillies, where these chillies are just labelled as \"red chillies\" that I get from my local Indian shop. I don't know the variety but I do know they are much hotter than kashmiri chillies. My god, my mouth burned but it didn't overwhelm the other flavours. I could still taste the garlic, jaggery, and other spices. It was very tasty but I will definetly use the proper chillies next time. I'll get a nicer red colour that way too. [This is what my recheado fish fry looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/c37evm6.jpg)\n* **Sorpotel** is a spicy, tangy meat curry. It's mainly made with pork but you can find versions that use mutton, beef, or chicken too. Mine was with pork. I chose this dish because it was described as a special dish usually made for occasions such as weddings or Christmas. I thought it was an apt choice considering the timing. While the method is simple, it takes a couple of hours to make. You first need to boil the pork, then chop and fry it, and then finally cook it with the curry base until the curry thickens. It was worth it though, it was such a decadent dish. I made a big batch so I could have leftovers because every single recipe says that it's best to eat it after 1-2 days from cooking it. My sorpotel didn't come out as red as the pictures I've seen, but I think that's because I added too much tamarind (I prefer tangy flavours, so I added more tamarind). I ate mine with some carrot and peas sabzi. [This is what my pork sorpotel looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/FZr8bG8.jpg)\n\nWhat I really liked about Goan food is the bright red colour to a lot of their dishes (the above dishes are supposed to much redder than my versions). Their mix of spicy and tangy is so flavourful, it makes any leftovers just as good or better than on the day of cooking. My main take though is that the masala paste is the most important part of the dish. As long as that paste is delicious, it's hard to mess up the dish. This also makes it easy to make alterations, for example, using chicken instead of pork.\n\nMy next week is Telangana! An obvious dish for this state is Hyderabadi biriyani, but any other suggestions are welcome too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy New Year! :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fixed spelling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 -  Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 8 - Nagaland](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1672505619.0, "score": 146, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "How to build a tandoor oven at home for under \u00a350", "selftext": "Looking to build a home Tandoor? Then this simple to follow build using easily available items is just for you. \n\nAt the time of filming (3 March 2020) this project came to just under \u00a350. (\u00a349.09 to be precise although prices may change through the season and go up or down)\n\nThe heat for a tandoor is traditionally generated by a charcoal or wood fire, burning within the tandoor itself, thus exposing the food to live fire, radiant heat cooking, and hot-air, convection cooking, and smoking in the fat and food juices that drip on to the charcoal. Temperatures in a tandoor can approach 480 \u00b0C (900 \u00b0F), and it is common for tandoor ovens to remain lit for long periods to maintain the high cooking temperature.\n\nThis build, links for all the materials, tips (including subscribers additional tips) can be found at **thecurrykid.co.uk**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Video**\n\n[https://youtu.be/6WDIRpGaidY](https://youtu.be/6WDIRpGaidY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Materials**  \n\n\n* 1 x 85 litre metal bin with closed lid\n* 2 x terracotta stone flower pots 30cm\n* 1 x terracotta stone flower pot dish stand\n* 50 litres of perlite or vermiculite insulation\n* 7 paving blocks or bricks \n* fire cement (very small pot)\n* few handfuls of stones or pebbles\n* small oven tray to collect charcoal debris\n* long flat metal skewers\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Tools Required**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* electric drill\n* masonry drill bits (i used dewalt extreme masonry)\n* disc cutter or saw\n* hole cutter (optional)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## How To Construct Your Home Tandoor Oven**\n\nYou can complete your tandoor build in under 1 hour without rushing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Drill the holes required for ventilation and debris removal  \n\n2. Using a hole cutter, or by drilling lots of small holes in a circle cut out a 6-10 cm hole in the centre of them metal bin. This is where the ventilation will rise and debris will drop into your collection pot.  \n\n3. Place the plant pot on a suitable surface and drill 6 or more ventilation holes around the centre. I used a 4mm bit followed by 8mm then 10mm to ensure the pot didn\u2019t crack.  \n\n4. Now place the drilled plant pot centre onto the saucer and using a pencil mark the position of the holes. Remove the pot and drill matching holes in the saucer. For the centre hole I used a hole cutter but again you can drill a number of small holes in a circle then gently tap out.  \n\n5. Mark a line around the bottom of your other pot around 4 cm from the base. Using either a disc cutter or saw carefully cut around the edge until they seperate. Don\u2019t try to cut straight through in 1 go but go around the edge making a deeper cut each time. My dad cut this using a disc cutter for me and recommends you wear eye protection and some sort of face mask and ear defenders as he said it was extremely loud and dusty.  \n\n6. Start by placing your debris tray on the floor where you want your home tandoor then place 4 blocks or bricks around the sides and back to steady the bin.  \n\n7. Place your bin on top of the blocks and make sure you have enough room to remove the debris collection tray and that the bin is secure and cannot fall forward.  \n\n8. Place 3 of the blocks or bricks in a triangle pattern in the base of the bin. Make sure they are touching each other and do not cover the ventilation / debris hole.  \n\n9. Add a handful of stones or pebbles around the back of all the blocks to secure them. Make sure they come to the top of the blocks but are as level as possible  \n\n10. Place the saucer in the centre of the blocks ensuring the centre hole is over the cutout in the bin itself  \n\n11. Place the first flowerpot with the holes drilled in it on top of the saucer and align the holes  \n\n12. Fill the sides with the Perlite or Vermiculite insulation to about 5 cm below the top of the pot. This just ensures it\u2019s held steady so far.  \n\n13. Add a small bead around the top of the pot. This simply helps to keep things together and ensure the heat doesn\u2019t escape through any big gaps in the pots  \n\n14. Place your last flower pot upside down (with the end you have cut facing up) and press carefully into the oven cement, make sure both pots are perfectly aligned. Fill the outside with more Perlite or Vermiculite insulation and tap the sides gently to settle into all the cracks. If you have used oven cement smooth off any excess inside for a neat finish.  \n\n15. Season the inside of the tandoor by mixing some oil (any kind will do) and coating the top half inside, you can also add a little yoghurt if you have some. This will dry as you do your first warm up and seal the top to allow for things like your naans to be removed easier. You could also use a wash of salt and water. After priming heat your oven for around 6-8 hours on full and everything will be well sealed. Nans will not fall off into the coals yet will not stick so much you cannot remove them.  \n\n\nThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re good to go so now it\u2019s time to prime your oven ready for use.  \n\n\n* For the first warm up use about 6 lumps of lumpwood.\n* After you\u2019ve done your initial heat up and allowed it to cool down you\u2019re good to go. Load up with your coals and enjoy. Sit back, enjoy and become the envy of all your friends.\n\n  \nTake care though as these throw out some real heat. My laser thermometer cut out at 550 Celsius saying MAX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Priming your oven for first use**\n\nThe first time a tandoor is used, the temperature must be gradually increased to condition the interior of the oven. This step is crucial in ensuring the longevity of the tandoor. \n\nConditioning can be done by starting a very small fire and slowly adding fuel to gradually increase the amount of heat inside the tandoor. \n\nHairline cracks might form during conditioning; this is normal and will not interfere with the performance of the tandoor oven. When the oven cools off, the hairline cracks will barely be noticeable. They are essential in allowing the clay body of the tandoor to breathe (thermal expansion and contraction). \n\nThe slower the temperature inside the tandoor is increased during its first use, the fewer hairline cracks will develop\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Regular use**\n\nBefore use always remove the old charcoal debris from the bottom of the tandoor and ensure the ventilation holes are clear.\n\nYou can add your lumpwood charcoal directly into the base, light with a natural firelighter such as wood wool and allow to grey over before cooking. I find it easier to use a \u201cBBQ starter chimney\u201d to stack up the charcoal first and then empty into the tandoor once glowing hot. \n\nYou can place the end of your skewers directly onto the coals if required, or use the lip inside the first flowerpot 1/2 way up the tandoor. \n\nI would recommend at least 50cm flat skewers and that you wear a glove at all times when using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Where to buy (UK)**\n\nA list of items updated frequently is available an the main build page on my website **thecurrykid.co.uk** (sorry wont let me add links here to external sites for some reason)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**## Credit**\n\nBased on ideas from a design by BiBs Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/gs28ij/how_to_build_a_tandoor_oven_at_home_for_under_50/", "created_utc": 1590654009.0, "score": 140, "author": "thecurrykid-co-uk", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/gs28ij/how_to_build_a_tandoor_oven_at_home_for_under_50/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

You know exactly how much water to put and the timer for when it's finished is innate. You never learn, your glasses always fog up but the hot steam and the aroma is worth it. You eat the rice with curry and dal and you look at the joy on your family's faces, but you can't help thinking about how the rice got to on your plate. Of how lucky you truly are. Are the labourers ok? Do they get to eat rice like this? What pesticides and herbicides were used if any? Would their use mess up the ecosystem in the future? \n\n\n\"Hey kid, your body's with us but your mind is elsewhere, eat!\" one of your parents say.\n\n\n\"It's just my resting face,\" you lie.\n\n\nGod Tier = \n\n* Tilda. \"Tilda is everything you want and more. There's a reason it's so expensive. The grains are ludicrously long. Almost like noodles. They are fluffy as heck. They are very very fragrant. Splurge on it once and see the difference. They use their own strain of rice that they've been sourcing since the 1970s. They discard any broken or off coloured grains. It's a premium product.\" - /u/dsarma\n\nTop Tier = \n\n* Lundberg Farms\n* Lotus Foods\n* Village Harvest\n\nMid Tier = \n\n* Mantra\n* Tilda\n* Zebra\n* Elephant\n\nLow Tier = \n\n* Kohinoor\n* Royal\n* Trader Joe's Brand\n\nShit Tier = \n\n* Uncle Ben's\n\n\"I think one of the cornerstones of a Tier 1 rice is with being organic. It's especially important with rice, and even more so when grown in countries with poor regulation on chemical use. Arsenic is of particular concern when it comes to rice, with sources being with either the soil or pesticide usage. Unless a rice company has a mission focus on sustainable, organic and arsenic free farming, then it doesn't merit Tier 1 ranking.\" - /u/valdamax", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/5nrj7m/hey_can_we_make_a_basmati_rice_tier_list/", "created_utc": 1484324591.0, "score": 126, "author": "PunnyPan", "num_comments": 62, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/5nrj7m/hey_can_we_make_a_basmati_rice_tier_list/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I make really good food and he enjoyed the food a lot at our home.

{"title": "Week 18 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Karnataka", "selftext": "Hello again, I have done week 18 - Karnataka!\n\nKarnataka is south Indian coastal state that is famous for its national parks and amazing food. It has a mix of cuisines that incorporates various types of dishes but its common thread is its love of rice. If you look up Karnataka's cuisine, you'll see that it is split into region-specific dishes. Some regions are mainly vegetarian while others eat a lot of meat or seafood. Like other south Indian states, you'll find that many dishes use coconut oil, coconut, and curry leaves.\n\nThe dishes I chose were sagu and kori gassi.\n\n* **Sagu** is a mixed vegatable curry made with coconut chutney. This was one of my favourite dishes to make. You can use any vegetables but the common ones are cauliflower, carrot, potato, and grean beans. Just void bitter vegetables like okra or broccoli. This is a type of kurma dish, and kurma is a go-to veg dish I make a lot so very happy I found this. I ate mine with aloo paratha. I promised I'd make aloo paratha during a family visit even though I only made it once so I needed to practice haha [This is what my sagu looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/9PkehyJ.jpg)\n* **Kori gassi** is a chicken (kori) curry (gassi) that is made with red chilli chutney. It uses various other ingredients, like poppy seeds, methi seeds, cashew nuts, and more; but not all of these ingredients are used across its different variations. Mine did not use cashew nuts but it was very delicious. I swear, poppy seeds have become a staple in my cooking. Kori gassi is an incredibley flavourful dish, I think I'll save this recipe for parties because it is definitely a show-stopper. I ate it with rice but mine did not turn out as red as the pictures online. Probably because I didn't use that many chillies - I used 5 chillies while a lot of recipes use 10 or more. [This is what my kori gassi looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/dGx66mP.jpg)\n\nKarnataka was fun to do, as is every week I have done so far. Both my recipes grind masala paste before adding it to the curry, so I'm not sure if this is common practice for Karnataka's cuisine or I just happened to pick dishes that used this method. I was going to pick another dish called Mullangi Sambar, which is a thin curry with white radishes. Very tasty looking dish, I will definitely make it at some point as I now know I like white radishes from my Sikkim week.\n\nMy next week is Himachal Pradesh!

I am the one person author, recipe creator, photographer on my blog. I am also very active on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/veganricha) (500k+ fans),  [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/veganricha) and other social media channels. My first book Vegan Richa's Indian Kitchen released in May 2015. It is the #1 best seller on Indian food on [Amazon]( https://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Richas-Indian-Kitchen-Traditional/dp/1941252095) since then. \n\n\nMy book has Indian food made accessible and simplified. It covers dals, veggie dishes, rich curries, flatbreads, savory breakfasts, exotic desserts, celebrating vegetables and legumes. The recipes are inspired by regional Indian cuisines and local ingredients (in the US) , and are streamlined for the home cook. The recipes are also very allergy-friendly with many soy, nut or gluten free options.  I love reading about how people who were previously intimidated are now enjoying their home cookery through the book. \n\nI always loved my time in the kitchen whether it was making the usual Indian food with family recipes for from scratch hot meals or experimenting with ingredients and flavors. The feedback on the blog and social media encourages me to simplify certain traditional flavors and techniques, be more experimental and creative in developing my own recipes, and to learn and grow as a recipe developer. \n\nIf you are new to the blog, start with [Bombay Potato & peas]( http://www.veganricha.com/2015/09/vegan-bombay-potatoes-and-peas.html)  , [Samosa Pinwheels]( http://www.veganricha.com/2015/11/samosa-pinwheels-spiced-potato-pinwheels.html)  or [Broccoli Pakore Waali Vegan Kadhi](http://www.veganricha.com/2013/05/spiced-yogurt-gravy-with-baked-broccoli.html) recipes.  From the book definitely try [Mango Curry Tofu]( http://www.veganricha.com/recipe-pages/vegan-mango-curry-tofu), [Chickpea Quinoa Lentil spinach Stew](http://www.veganricha.com/2014/05/chickpea-lentil-quinoa-spinach-stew.html), [20 minute Palak Tofu]( http://www.veganricha.com/2013/10/palak-tofu-tofu-in-spinach-curry-vegan.html) .\n\nYou can ask me anything about my book or blog, recipes, writing a book, blogging. I can tell you how I do things, not necessarily the best way of doing them :). \n\nUPDATE: It was great taking your questions. I will continue to answer them later this afternoon. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/4qmr67/hi_everyone_i_am_richa_hingle_author_of/", "created_utc": 1467306112.0, "score": 125, "author": "VeganRicha", "num_comments": 58, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/4qmr67/hi_everyone_i_am_richa_hingle_author_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 7 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Delhi", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm back with my 7th week - Delhi!\n\nDelhi is another union territory within India and also the capital territory. Delhi was very hard to do because it is such a melting pot of Indian cultures and cuisines. I ended up learning about some of the cuisine history too, such as the Kayasth and Mughlai cuisines.\n\nKayasth cuisine is a pan-Indian cuisine that consists of very rich traditional Hindu foods influenced by the Mughal Empire. They specialise in slow-cooked meat, particularly mutton, and just reading about it made my mouth water. They take their food very seriously and don't accept anything less than perfection.\n\nMughlai cuisine is from the days of the Mughal Empire and is a mix of central Indian and Persian foods. It also consists of very rich traditional foods that well known internationally. It gave birth to some of my favourite dishes, such as biryani and kebabs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe foods from these cuisine has a very strong presence in Delhi and you can see a lot of them as famous street food. And so, I chose two street food dishes for Delhi - aloo paratha and seekh kebab.\n\n* **Aloo paratha** is a flatbread stuffed with spiced mashed potato. I found many recipes for it and the one I choose used amchur powder. I was excited because I never used amchur powder before. The parathas did taste tangier but I'm not sure if I added enough amchur powder as it's supposed to be strong but it ended up being a subtle flavour. If anyone uses this in their aloo paratha, let me know how you use it! I've also never made any type of stuffed paratha before (only Malabar parathas) and I was pretty pleased that they didn't burst. I even had one fully puff up! This is such a delicious dish and goes well with pretty much anything. I had mine with carrot thoran, prawn pickle, and curd. Yes, I know. I ate seafood with dairy. I like the combination so leave me be. [This is what my aloo paratha looked like (it looks like one big paratha from the lighting but it is actually two).](https://i.imgur.com/dPiFRiX.jpg)\n* **Seekh kebab** is type of meat kebab made into long tubes and then grilled (or fried in my case). Mine was made with mutton and chaat masala topped with ghee. There were a lot of different types of great kebabs to choose from, but this one just spoke to me. This kebab needs the meat to be very fine so I blended mine to get the right texture. The blended meat was so thick and it took more effort than I expected to mix in the rest of the ingredients. It was still easy enough to make though. It was delicious and very filling. I had mine with coriander chutney, cucumber and rice. [This is what my seekh kebabs looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/wW7aKKL.jpg)\n\nDelhi was hard to do just because of the large choice in dishes, but I'm glad I chose the ones I did. Street food is always nice to make, though my versions used less oil because they were week day meals rather than a treat.\n\nMy next week will be Nagaland! The only thing I know about Nagaland is the ghost pepper so I'm excited to learn more about its cuisine. I also welcome any suggestions for dishes too, so please feel free to comment any!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw, my parents visited me last weekend and I made them Manipur kangshoi and Chhattisgarh's bafauri for dinner. The kangshoi was vegetarian for my mum, and they both enjoyed it. They never had anything like bafauri before and even had the leftovers for breakfast the next day with rice. I was happy that I could make the dishes I learned for other people. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 -  Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1670166038.0, "score": 123, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

As a vegetarian living in the USA I sought something more interesting to eat then doubling up on mashed potatoes and grabbing a second ear of corn.   That got me exploring different menus and I found two that were most appealing, Middle Eastern and Indian.  However I did not like the greasy Indian food that was being served in my local restaurants.  A local vegetarian restaurant opened called the Inn Season (Royal Oak, Michigan USA) run by George, who had, I believe, studied food prep with the Krishna people.  His food was sublime, not just good vegetarian fare but delicious on a different level.  I think I must have bought a cookbook then, a big thick one, \" Lord Krishna's Cuisine\" by  Yamuna Devi and that got me started.  I remember how uncomfortable I was going into my first Indian grocery store, not knowing what anything was.  Eventually I became friendly with the owners and they helped me.

{"title": "My curry trees are producing tons of seeds this year so I've decided to give them away on here. details inside", "selftext": "As the title says, I'd estimate my two trees have 100 or so seeds on them at the moment.  Here are some pics:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/E4ZQ9\n\nThe larger plant produced a few large seeds, while the other one has lots of smaller ones.  I've successfully germinated 4 seeds from the larger plant.  I haven't tried any of the smaller seeds but I think they'll be viable once they darken up.\n\nSo here are the rules:\n\n* I'll ship for free but to the US only.  Sorry to the guy from Mexico in that thread a couple of weeks ago.  Did you get your tree btw?\n* I plan to ship them in a little folded up cardboard tube in a padded envelope.\n* Everyone will get 5 seeds.\n\nAnyone interested PM me a shipping address.  I'll ship them out in as soon as they turn purple, in the order received.  I'll PM you back when they go out.\n\nTo germinate, I pull off the fleshy covering and plant the hard seed a half inch or so under the soil.  I've just been using regular potting soil.  Keep it nice and moist and it should start to split open after a week or so.  At that point a root starts to grow out of it and into the soil.  You won't actually be able to see this because the seed will be covered with soil.  After another week or two the root will get enough of a foothold to start pushing the seed itself up out of the soil from below.  Once the seed emerges from the soil a green shoot should start growing out of the middle of it.  Once they emerge I've been moistening them several times a day to encourage them to split open more.  That's been my experience anyway.\n\nThey grow really slowly, but once you have green leaves it's just a matter of giving them a little sun and not forgetting to water them.\n\nI've been growing these plants for the past 4 or 5 years.  Every year I cut them way back in the fall and put them under florescent lights for the Winter, then move them back outside in the Spring.  If you live down south they would probably be fine outside all year.  This recipe is pretty much the sole reason I'm growing them:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZEaYngbp4w\n\nIt's ungodly delicious.\n\nAny questions just ask.\n\nEdit:  Wow I've gotten a lot of PMs!  Keep them coming, I'll send out all the seeds I have and let everyone else know when I run out.\n\nEdit 2:  At this point I've definitely gotten more PMs than I'll have seeds, so I guess this giveaway is pretty much in the can.  I'll try to respond to a few PMs that asked specific questions, but for everyone else don't expect a reply from me until I either get your seeds in the mail or I write you back to tell you you were too late.  I'll try to get them all mailed out within the next week, but I'm going to wait until they turn purple so the timeline will be somewhat dependent on the whims of mother nature.\n\nThanks for the big response!  I'm glad these seeds will be spread far and wide.  I feel like a regular Johnny Curryseed.\n\n\nEdit 3:  Obligatory holy shit thanks for the gold!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/6o5nq5/my_curry_trees_are_producing_tons_of_seeds_this/", "created_utc": 1500432028.0, "score": 124, "author": "theBelvidere", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/6o5nq5/my_curry_trees_are_producing_tons_of_seeds_this/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "High protein Indian vegetarian food", "selftext": "I often see posts by people asking for how to get high protein variations or dishes of Indian food. I am a north Indian vegetarian (eating egg) who does weightlifting and aims for 110g of protein a day. Unsure if anyone would find this useful but thought I would share some of the dishes/meal changes that I make to get a higher amount of protein\n\nKadhi pakora - I use high protein yogurt for the kadhi and use soya chunks for the pakoras\n\nMasala dosa - I grind up oats, protein powder and rava and mix it with high protein yoghurt for the dosa, with a masala made from either paneer or tofu \n\nTofu bhurji- I\u2019ll make amritsari paneer bhurji but substitute tofu instead of the paneer and pair it with a pau \n\nTandoori salad - I will bake paneer, broccoli, peppers, onion and tofu once a week (marinated in high protein yoghurt) and keep that in the fridge to eat as a salad with all meals\n\nDal - I add unflavoured protein powder to certain dals which are ok being thickened (some dal like toor is weird when thick but with black urad for example it\u2019s nice thick)\n\nMalai - I make a malai out of either blended cottage cheese or blended silken tofu and I add it to dishes like dal makhani, palak paneer, matar paneer\n\nSoya pilau - regular quick meal I\u2019ll make in a cooker with veg, soya chunks, brown rice\n\nKeema matar - using soya mince and matar, eaten with pau and a boiled egg on the side \n\nGujrati farsan- some farsan like muthiya can have a block of tofu mixed in. I haven\u2019t tried it with patra or khandvi yet but I plan to as it seems it would work\n\nVariations of egg curries and egg dishes (coconut egg curry, bhurji, sri lankan omelette curry, egg kathi roll on a protein powder cheela. Snacking on boiled eggs with chaat masala and chilli powder just after a workout)\n\nGenerally I won\u2019t add protein to sabzis so these will be different variations of my main protein source (listed above) to get a boost of protein in. I try to get large amounts of protein so although I do eat dals and beans and paneer, to get the amount I need to hit I\u2019ll try to lean towards tofu/soya/protein powder as that can make the difference between 20g of protein in a meal vs 40g. If I\u2019m having something like rajma chawal then I will reduce the amount of rice and ensure there\u2019s a big bowl of high protein yoghurt to still hit my goals.\n\nNot Indian dishes but as I like having good spicy food here are some more dishes I add in to my rotation which taste good and have good quantities of protein:\n\n- Tofu tacos\n- Thai curry with tofu \n- Thai pad kra pow with tofu and a fried egg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1hqelva/high_protein_indian_vegetarian_food/", "created_utc": 1735651428.0, "score": 121, "author": "curry_in_my_beard", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1hqelva/high_protein_indian_vegetarian_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

My conclusion is just based on how the recipe blogs & comments spoke about the cuisines from these places.\n\nJammu cuisine seems to favour more sour flavours and is a mix of veg and non-veg dishes, while Kashmiri cuisine is more meat-heavy. But in comparison to the rest of India, Jammu & Kashmir residents eat so much more meat regardless of religion. Even the Pandits, Brahmins of the Hindu religion who are typically vegetarian, eat mutton.\n\nI wanted to try both veg and non-veg dishes, but ended up choosing two non-veg dishes because their mutton recipes looked so tasty. In case anyone wanted to try veg dishes though, here are some options: Kashmiri dum aloo, kulthi dal, nadru yakhni, and nadru monji.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dishes I chose where goshtaba and khatta meat:\n\n* **Goshtaba** is a yogurt-based dish with large, velvty meatballs, and is part of a multi-course meal called Wazwan. Wazwan is a 36-course meal and is prepared for celebratory occasions such as weddings. Goshtaba is usually mutton but I have seen some chicken recipes too. The velvty meatball texture comes from grinding the meat with some sort of fat (usually mutton fat but you can use ghee or eggs). Goshtaba was simple to make, it just took a long time (+1hr) so that the meatballs were tender. It was a heavy dish and perfect with rice. I added a bit too much ghee to mine and so my curry base turned more yellow than the pictures online. It was still very tasty though. [This is what my goshtaba looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/E8Qa55k.jpg)\n* **Khatta meat** is a sour mutton curry and comes from the Dogra community of the Jammu region. The sourness comes from either amchurr or anardana (pomegranate). Traditionally, it is made with anardana and smoked. I wasn't able to smoke mine, but it still turned out delicious. Again, this dish was simple to make, just with a long cooking time (+1hr) to make the meat tender (I don't have a pressure cooker). It is another heavy meal and also perfect with rice, but you can also have this with gheur, a fried savoury pancake with a mesh structure. The bone marrow from this dish is excellent and my favourite part of the dish. [This was what my khatta meat looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/en58kIy.jpg)\n\nAnother fun week to do! What makes Jammu and Kashmir cuisine particuarly special is its use of both black and green cardamons. It seems to come up in nearly every recipe. Black cardamon was hard to get where I was but I found it and it was definitely worthwhile. This cuisine will definitely be my go-to for mutton recipes.\n\nMy next week is Haryana! Again, suggestions very welcome. I am currently considering bajra khichdi and kadhi pakora.\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 -  Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 8 - Nagaland](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 9 - Goa](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 10 - Telangana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/10cm8rn/week_10_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 11 - Punjab](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/110kmj8/week_11_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11cjv4k/week_12_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1677425171.0, "score": 124, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/11cjv4k/week_12_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 20 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Lakshadweep", "selftext": "Hello all, I am back with my 20th week - Lakshadweep!\n\nLakshadweep is an Indian Union Territory that consists of 36 islands and is located in South India, by the coast of Kerala. Lakshadweep's cuisine heavily features fresh seafood, and ingredients like coconut and curry leaves are also common. Out of the 10 habitable islands, Minicoy food seems to be the most favoured, where its cuisine is influenced by the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar.\n\nThe dishes I choose were maas podichath and farata.\n\n* **Maas podichath** is a dry tuna stir fry made with onions and spices. It's a dry, flakey dish that was simple and quick to make (under 20 minutes). I enjoyed it a lot and I think it will go into my usual meal rotations. The dish is made with dried tuna but I saw recipes use tinned tuna that you dry yourself, which may be a suitable substitute if you don't have access to dried tuna. There are variations on this recipe; some recipes fry the ingredients while others mix everything uncooked. I fried mine and I think I'll stick with that method. I ate mine with rice. I was supposed to have it with some chutney but I forgot to make it. I only realised after I served the maas podichath... Oh well. [This is what my maas podichath looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/x0mElfd.jpg)\n* **Farata** is a flatbread made from maida (plain flour), instead of the usual atta (whole wheat flour). I wanted to try this because it was similar to a Mauritius flatbread I had once upon a time. And what do you know, I think they are actually the same thing, which I found super cool. I'm finding more and more connections between Indian cuisine and cuisines of ~~West~~ East Africa, it's making wanting to travel to ~~West~~ East Africa to experience the food myself. Anyway, the farata was just as easy to make as a parotta, but it was much softer because it used maida. I had mine with coconut prawn curry and dipping the farata into the curry was heaven. [This is what my farata looked like (please excuse the burned ones).](https://i.imgur.com/6wil52Q.jpg)\n\nInitially, I was going to make rairiha, a red tuna curry, but apparently fresh tuna is not in season in the UK right now. As tuna is popular in Lakshadweep, I wanted to try at least one tuna recipe, so I choose maas podichath. Once tuna is in season again, which will be later in the year, I will try making rairiha (with the farata, of course).\n\nThe history of Lakshadweep was interesting to learn about. Although it is often talked about in connection with Kerala, it has its own distinct culture and cuisine. I found it hard to get details of Lakshadweep's cuisine, but [this article](https://lifestyle.livemint.com/food/discover/in-search-of-authentic-flavours-from-lakshadweep-s-minicoy-111626918916250.html) contains a lot of information, in case others would like to read about it too.\n\nMy next state is Chandigarh!

{"title": "Week 19 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Himachal Pradesh", "selftext": "Hello all! Back with week 19 - Himachal Pradesh!\n\nHimachal Pradesh is a north Indian state with beautiful mountains and historical buildings. Its cuisine uses a lot of yogurt, cardamoms, and chickpeas, and is influenced by its neighbouring regions of Punjab and Tibet. There are also beautiful blends of flavours of its different valleys and internal regions, resulting in a great spread of flavours across its cuisine.\n\nThe dishes I chose were chana madra and siddu.\n\n* **Chana madra** is a chickpea dish made with a thick yogurt curry base. This was incredibly simple to make and very quick. However, the recipe I followed adds yogurt to the tempered spices. I was not quick enough on stirring and my yogurt immediately curdled. I didn't have time to remake it so the picture I have posted here looks awful. Sorry to any Himachali readers! I will re-make this again properly at some point because I love chickpeas and this looks like such a tasty dish. The flavour was nice though, the texture was off completey because of the curdling. [This is what my chana madra looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/c1vmwlT.jpg)\n* **Siddu** is a bun stuffed with either savoury or sweet fillings. Savoury fillings count be nuts, lentils, beans, and more, while sweet is usually jaggery. I made a savoury one with an urad dal filling. This dish turned out much better than the chana madra. I was a bit nervous about this one though because I don't often make bread with yeast, but it turned out well. The filling was easy to do as well. It was just making the bun that was hard because (as you will see from my picture) some of the buns split open. I covered the buns in ghee so that's why it looks shiny in the photo. I had mine with some green chutney. [This is what my siddu looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/7RpfsCk.jpg)\n\nReally great dishes again, just sad about the chana madra. I will absolutely do it again and give you an update. I saw various other recipes that used chickpeas too and I'd like to try them one day. HImachal Pradesh was fun to do, I got a little more confident in making leavened bread.\n\nMy next region is a union territory - Lakshadweep!

{"title": "After a long and extended search for the perfect BIR tikka masala recipe, I have found the answer in The Curry Guy's recipe.", "selftext": "I'm of indian origin. I've had CTM here in the states, in Leicester UK, and even in India. I have had a lot of trouble finding the right recipe. I tried Kenji's SeriousEats [recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/06/chicken-tikka-masala-for-the-grill-recipe.html). I tried the BonAppetit [one](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-tikka-masala). I tried several others off reddit. They were good and but not great.\n\nOn reddit, I stumbled upon a reference to The Curry Guy. I followed his very thorough recipe which involves making a [base](https://greatcurryrecipes.net/2013/12/31/make-indian-restaurant-style-curry-sauce-large-batch/) (that uses 10 onions!), making the [chicken tikka](https://greatcurryrecipes.net/2013/05/16/making-chicken-tikka/), and then putting it all [together](https://greatcurryrecipes.net/2012/01/31/how-to-make-chicken-tikka-masala-like-they-do-in-the-indian-restaurants/).\n\nThis one hits, folks. \n\nYou feel the tomato first, the creaminess second, and the spice last. Paired with some rice or naan and it feels like you're in a BIR. One big learning: do *not* skimp on the Kasoori Methi (dried fenugreek leaves). It smells weird on its own but in some way I can't describe, it wraps everything together. One personal preference - skip the butter in the main recipe; it makes it too heavy.\n\nThe investment is worth it. The base takes a long time to make but you can freeze it. It supplies about 30 portions. This is the be all end all CTM recipe.\n\nPhotos: https://imgur.com/a/9hFepa8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/h98vu5/after_a_long_and_extended_search_for_the_perfect/", "created_utc": 1592195150.0, "score": 118, "author": "dopeboy_io", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/h98vu5/after_a_long_and_extended_search_for_the_perfect/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Onam Sadya for one", "selftext": "Namaste y'all, I cooked a small Sadya meal for myself today using many ingredients from home garden. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IveYxxW\n\nThe dishes might sound traditional but my cooking techniques were definitely unorthodox. The end goal was to make a sattwik meal ASAP (2 hrs from start to finish - vegetarian, no onion or garlic) \n\nso I did this with a 6\" cast iron skillet, ikea saucepan and 3qt instant pot. I used an Ikea silicone spatula and spoon for utensils in addition to knife, peeler, chopping board and a bowl of water for washing.\n\nI used a mortar and pestle for minimal grinding and substituted ingredients and techniques where a blender was needed. I also employed some shortcuts where possible. For cooking fat, Coconut oil was used mostly and ghee was used in payasam/pradhaman + for serving initially. \n\nI have given my approach to recipes below. I had posted previously regarding my Tamil meal for one, so wanted to share the image and process here again. If the recipe is not clear, my apologies - I have always copied my mom and she usually measures by eye so I don't have any standard measurements but can come up with something if you need an approximation. \n\nThe spread includes following items\n\n1) Banana leaf from garden as the plate\n\n2) Choru/Matta rice - red rice cooked in an instant pot using pot in pot - 13 minutes steam more mode and did QR after 5 minutes.\n\n3) ghee - homemade a  few weeks ago.\n\n4) pappadam - store bought, took 2 pieces and microwaved for 30 seconds\n\n5) pradhaman/payasam - little bit of cooked rice + water, bring to boil. Add milk, add coconut powder, add sugar and let thicken. In cast iron skillet warm ghee, add raisins and cashews, fry till golden and add to payasam. Transfer to ramekin and rinse the saucepan. \n\n6) sweet potato mezhukupiratti - sweet potato was coocked in instant pot along with rice. Became a bit mushy but I was ok with it. Peeled skin and chopped into pieces. Coated with salt, pepper, chilli powder and turmeric. In cast iron skillet added coconut oil and dumped spiced sweet potato cubes and let it cook on both sides letting it get a char here and there for the crispy bits. Transfer to a plate ( well seasoned cast iron so I wiped and let it sit on low heat for future)\n\n7)  Cluster beans thoran - chopped and added to saucepan with water salt and a pinch of turmeric. As it got cooked and water reduced, I added dried shredded coconut, cumin powder, chilli flakes and a tadka made in cast iron pan using coconut oil + mustard seeds, 1 red chilli broken and curry leaves. Mixed transferred to the pyrex bowl and rinsed the saucepan.  \n\n8) parippu - I had cooked and frozen toor dal in freezer so just cooked it with some boiling water in saucepan. Removed a little bit in a small cup for the parippu and left the rest in the saucepan on heat. \n\n9) sambar - chopped half a red heirloom tomato, added to parippu that was in the saucepan. Added salt, asafetida, sambar powder and readymade tamarind extract + water and let it come to a boil and reduce. Meanwhile I chopped some Brinjal/eggplant and sauteed it in cast iron pan on the side. This was mixed with the contents in saucepan followed by tadka. Sambar done. Transfer to pyrex and rinse the saucepan.\n\n10) vellarika pachadi - homegrown cucumber deseeded and chopped. I used half and froze the rest for future. Add to water boiling in saucepan. Add some chopped ginger and let the cucumber cook. Once knife goes thru without too much resistance, add coconut powder, cumin powder, salt, red chilli flakes and remove saucepan from heat. Add some sour yogurt and tadka (coconut oil, curry leaves and mustard seeds cooked in cast iron), mix well.\n\n11) puli inji - this translates to tamarind ginger. It's an appetite stimulant and digestive aid so I just mashed some peeled, chopped ginger in mortar using some salt for coarseness and added little tamarind paste while mashing. It had an astringent kick due to ginger but I liked it.\n\n12) rasam - mashed remainder of tomato from sambar using my hands in a bowl. Mixed with water, tamarind paste, salt, cumin powder, asafetida and some jaggery. In saucepan I made tadka using coconut oil, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, curry leaves and added the mash into it. Once it came to a boil I switched off and transferred to the bowl.\n\n13) sambaram or spiced buttermilk - mixed remainder yogurt from making pachadi with water for dilution. Added crushed cumin seeds, chopped curry leaves, salt and crushed pepper from pepper mill. Mixed and transferred to a glass. \n\nNot pictured were some banana chips from store, a banana fruit on the side and yogurt for yogurt rice at end.\n\nTo those who celebrate, Hope you all have a happy and blessed Onam. \n\nThanks for reading all this and traveling with me on my journey and approach to food.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x8u7re/onam_sadya_for_one/", "created_utc": 1662623762.0, "score": 112, "author": "vigglypuff", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/x8u7re/onam_sadya_for_one/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "General North/South differences", "selftext": "OK, here's a simpler and more basic difference. \n\nIn the North (in general), you're looking for consistently spiced food. That is, every bite you take of a specific thing should taste like every other bite. There's plenty of variation in texture, via the use of nuts, sweets (raisins in particular), and various fresh ingredients. You generally round out the dish, or somehow add a ground spice mixture to the whole thing, so that you end up with a perfectly spiced dish that tastes exactly like itself. \n\nIn the North, the fat content (calorically speaking) in the food you eat comes from either butter, ghee, or oil. Your dairy products are eaten in concentrated forms, such as cream, butter, cheese, and ghee. Side dishes tend to be light, and the use of a variety of root vegetables is very common. The further north you go, the more exotic the root vegetables. Up in Kashmir, it's quite common to see things like lotus root! There's lots of daikon, taro, potato, yams, and various forms of turnip. \n\nIn the South, you're looking for each bite to be as different as possible. With few exceptions, the food is spiced with whole spices. There also tends to be a lot more of the 1 - 2 spice dishes. For example, a very common cabbage dish is to shred the cabbage, and stir-fry it with mustard seed and asafoetida. The Southern dishes also tend to be rounded out with whole spices, and have textural variety by incorporating different side dishes that have those textures in them. \n\nIn the South, the fat content (calorically speaking) in the food you eat comes from coconut. Oil is used, but rather sparingly. Instead, in the Southern cultures that do use more heavily fatted dishes tend to throw on heaps of either freshly grated coconut, coconut cream, or coconut milk. Ghee and butter are used as garnishes (such as on roti when it's eaten), or in desserts. \n\nThe further south you go, the more you see the use of weird leafy green vegetables. You can stroll along in an open market in Chennai and see the vendors carrying at least 30 or 40 different varieties of dark green leafy vegetables. They'll all be under the umbrella term of \"spinach\", but they're there, and plentiful. You also see lots of reliance on banana products. Banana flower, banana stalk, and green bananas are prized delicacies.\n\nIn both cultures, there is a love for hot spices. In the South, you do use chilies, but you also use a ton of black pepper. In a South Indian home, it's quite common to see dishes that have whole black peppercorns thrown into the food, and eaten as-is. In the North, you get your heat from black pepper too, but it's more an accessory spice used in spice blends. You mostly get your Northern heat from chilies in various forms. \n\nDon't ask a Southerner to make sweets. They'll make it overly sweet, or greasy, or screw it up some other way. Don't ask a Northerner to make pongal (kichidi). They'll use basmati rice. Both sides of the \"divide\" are good at pilaf in various forms. In the North, they'll use whole and ground spices, vegetables, and huge amounts of ghee. In the South, they'll use various whole spices, and whichever ingredient goes with that sort of pilaf (whether it be lemon, coconut, tomato, tamarind, etc). Both sides are adept at their own type of daal. In the North, daal is thick, rich, and creamy. It's a stew more than anything else. In the South, daal is light, watery, and thin. It's definitely a soup. When a Southerner tries to make (for example) Punjabi daal, and they think they're being wild and crazy with using TWO tablespoons of oil rather than one (instead of like a half a cup to a cup), the results are hilarious. When a Northerner tries to make (for example) a Kerala daal, and adds a few splashes of extra water so you can stir the thing, and a few flakes of coconut at the end, the results aren't even close. \n\nBut the thing is, you ask either side to make their own versions, and they'll excel at it. Even though my mother grew up with a Southern diet, she still craves the Punjabi daal makhani that she got at the Gurudwara she visited with my sister. Even though my friend grew up with a Northern diet, she still loves it when I come over to her house and whip up a batch of coconut chatni and adai. The \"rivalry\" between the South and the North is a friendly one, for the most part. Especially for those who've travelled through the country, and tasted the different cuisines in their native areas, there is an appreciation for what the rest of the country does well. \n\nIf you want good Chaat, you go to Bombay. If you want good sweets, find yourself a Gujarati. If you want the best Chhole Bhature you ever tasted, find a Punjabi street vendor in Delhi. If you want good coconut dishes, go to Kerala. If you want South Indian food with a bit of a Northern twist, get yourself to Bangalore. If you want face-meltingly spicy, get thee to Andhra. \n\nThere's HUGE swathes of the country that I'm skipping here, because I'm not familiar with them. Bengali food has its own ideals. Marathi food is its own thing. Rajasthani food is its own thing. I could go on for days, but I wanted to give a deeper understanding of the actual differences that would mean something to someone who hasn't eaten the food. If you've never eaten it before, what would you know about the differences in garam masala and sambhar powder? That doesn't tell you anything. Hopefully, anyone else who has generalised trends they notice in other regions can chime in. Again, I'm only talking about what I know. Feel free to tell about your regions!

{"title": "Week 23 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Uttarakhand", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I am back with week 23 - Uttarakhand!\n\nUttarakhand is a north Indian state, close to the Himalayas. Its cuisine is filled with local produce, particularly a lot of dal dishes (that I have noticed at least). Uttarkhand's cuisine is split into the Garhwali and Kumaoni cuisines, though it looks they have a lot of the same dishes but with different names. Their recipes commonly use simple ingredients but is incredibly tasty and nutrient dense. The region seems to have many choices for different types of lentils and grains that are usually combined with flour. I think Uttarakhand has the most lentil recipes that I have come across (so far).\n\nThe two dishes I chose are Kumaoni raita and bhatt ki churkani.\n\n* **Kumaoni raita** is a yogurt side dish mixed with spices and grated cucumber, topped with mustard oil and coriander. It is the best raita I have eaten, I think this will be the staple raita I make from now on. The grated cucumber gave it such a soft texture, and I don't think I have ever had cold mustard oil before. Very delicious, I 100% recommend this raita. I had the raita with various meals throughout my week, but it also tastes great by itself as a snack. [This is what my Kumaoni raita looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/KKAUW3l.jpg)\n* **Bhatt ki churkani** is a dal made from black soy beans and thickened with roasted atta. My Asian shop luckily had the black soy beans but it was just called \"black beans\". After a lot of back and forth with the shop keeper and looking at pictures online, I'm pretty sure it was black soy beans and not another type of black bean. This was a very tasty dish and easy enough to do, but it took a lot longer to cook than I expected. It took an hour of simmering before the black soy beans were soft, and that was after pre-soaking the beans. It would have been much quicker if I used a pressure cooker. I'm still glad I made this dish though as I have never tasted a dal like this before. I ate my bhatt ki churkani with rice and papadums. [This is what my bhatt ki churkani looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/eoTkc8j.jpg)\n\nUttarakhand was great to do, introducing me to new recipes of a dish I had before and a new ingredient. I really need to get myself a pressure cooker, it would make dal recipes so much easier. If anyone wanted to try Garhwali raita, it looks like it is made with blended pumkin! I will try that as well one day :)\n\nMy next week will be a union territory - Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (long name because of merging many regions). As always, suggestions are welcome (especially for a union territory, there isn't usually much information)!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u200b Index:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 - Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 8 - Nagaland](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 9 - Goa](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 10 - Telangana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/10cm8rn/week_10_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 11 - Punjab](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/110kmj8/week_11_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 12 - Jammu and Kashmir](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11cjv4k/week_12_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 13 - Haryana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11pjgxo/week_13_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 14 - Bihar](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/122yblo/week_14_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 15 - Andaman and Nicobar Islands](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/12gc7hh/week_15_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 16 - Odisha](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/12w81fy/week_16_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 17 - Sikkim](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/13ns7fg/week_17_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 18 - Karnataka](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/140gvgg/week_18_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 19 -Himachal Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/14cj9ru/week_19_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 20 - Lakshadweep](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/14v123o/week_20_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 21 - Chandigarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/157hitv/week_21_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 22 - Jharkhand](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/15jzmbn/week_22_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1691ril/week_23_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1693759591.0, "score": 112, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1691ril/week_23_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 16 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Odisha", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have now done my 16th week - Odisha!\n\nOdisha is an eastern Indian state known for its great ancient history with many ancient temples and monuments still standing today. Odisha's cuisine includes lots of seafood and vegatables. Dishes are not as spicy as other cuisines but definitely flavourful, with preference towards sweet and sour flavours.\n\nI noticed that not much oil is used in the cuisine either, so the dishes are not heavy while still being filling because there are so many other ingredients used, like lentils or starchy veg/fruit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dishes I chose were dalma and amba khatta.\n\n* **Dalma** is a dal made with raw papaya and other vegetables. The tadka is fried in ghee and adds such a lovely depth of flavour. The papaya adds a nice sweet and sour flavour too. I used two papayas, but only one of them was raw. So the ripe papaya gave it an extra sweetness. Dalma is topped with grated coconut too, which again added another layer of delicious flavour. I think this has become one of my favourite dals. [This is what my dalma looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/eNPMguw.jpg)\n* **Amba khatta** is a chutney made with raw mangoes. It's a side dish that can be eaten with many savoury dishes, but I think it best pairs with fried seafood and rice. It's another sweet and sour dish, where the raw mangoes provided the sour and the jaggery added sweetness. Although the mangoes I picked were already starting to ripen. Really simple and quick to make too. The most amazing thing for me though was the smell - oh my gosh, the smeel was incredible. The pancha phutan (a spice mix) fried with the jaggery and mangoes made such a sweet, delicious aroma. My kitchen smelled so good. [This is what my amba khatta looked with (served with fried monk fish).](https://i.imgur.com/poFTtUO.jpg)\n\nOdisha was great to do. I learned another dal and mango recipe that were super tasty, and I'm learning more about sour flavours used in Indian cooking. I am always so delighted to learn more cooking methods! I have also learned that I cannot tell ripe from unripe fruit. I thought I could, but my Odisha week clearly showed me otherwise. I really need to improve this.\n\nMy next week will be Sikkim! Again, suggestions are welcome (and encouraged)!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I am moving home, which is always stressful for me.

{"title": "Cuisine of the week: Tamilian cuisine", "selftext": "Welcome to another regional cuisine thread. This week /r/IndianFood will be exploring Tamilian cuisine!      \n     \nTamilian cuisine originates from the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, but its presence can be felt in many other places as well (Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore). It has a diverse set of offerings that both vegetarians and non-vegetarians can choose from. Key elements of many Tamilian dishes include the use of rice, lentils, tamarind, coconut and spices.    \n    \nMany of you might be familiar with vegetables such as onion, potato, tomato, okra, eggplant, and spinach, which all have a place in Tamil cuisine, but some lesser-known vegetables that are also used are: elephant yam, taro root, white pumpkin, orange pumpkin, sweet potato (white/purple variety), drumsticks (moringa oleifera), raw plantain, raw banana / banana plant stem / banana plant flower, bitter gourd, snake gourd, bottle gourd, chayote squash, broad beans, yard-long beans, (daikon?) radish.    \n    \nDifferent regions and subcultures will spice their food differently, but the types of spices/flavouring agents you will typically find across the state are: cloves, cinnamon, cumin, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, (black) pepper, mustard seeds, chili, cardamom, nutmeg, **edit:** turmeric, corriander (leaves and powder).   \n    \nThe traditional fats used to cook dishes can range from [sesame oil](http://foodandworld.com/image/cache/data/see%20food/idhayam%20sesame%20oil-500x500.jpg) (**edit:** known as \"nalla ennai\" or \"good oil\") and peanut (ground nut) oil, to coconut oil. Ghee (\"nei\" or \"ney\" in Tamil) is also used, though more so to top foods than for actual cooking. However, ghee is usually the fat of choice when making a large number of desserts.     \n      \nTamil Nadu has quite a large coast and, as such, is home to regions with a rich seafood culture. It is not uncommon to find curries (supposedly curry was derived from the Tamil word kari!) that use prawn and fish (\"meen\"). However, mutton and chicken are also popular choices within the state. \n  \nLastly, while many people associate basmati rice with Indian food, basmati rice is actually not a traditional/staple rice of Tamil Nadu! There are [many different rice varieties (including red rice)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rice_varieties#Tamil_Nadu_rice_varieties) grown within the state. I've heard that [ponni rice(short grain)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponni_Rice) has gained much popularity within the last couple decades in urban areas due to ease of access. Another thing I've heard is that Tamilian (and maybe to some extent South Indian) rice tends to be shorter grain. **Edit:** I've also heard of parboiled rice being used!      \n    \n  \nIf you would like to learn more about Tamilian food, [Wikipedia's entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_cuisine) would be a good place to start. For those who have had experiences with Tamilian cuisine, please chip in! Share your stories, recipes, favourite meals, or provide any insight. For those who haven't, feel free to ask questions!\n\nRandom fact: Mulligatawny is an English adaption of *milagu thaneer* - meaning pepper water in Tamil.  \n  \n**Edit:** Tamil food traditionally used to be served on a banana leaf. [Here's an example of restaurant-style vegetarian Tamilian thali, served on the leaf!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ff/2a/2b/ff2a2bc93c8cfd10b606e904e20c46c0.jpg) *Note: Katori = cup*  \n  \n**Edit2:** [*This picture (I think)*](http://marudhuskitchen.com/www/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/valai-ilai-virundhu.jpg) would be a more accurate representation of a traditional Tamilian veg thali.

{"title": "Week 17 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Sikkim", "selftext": "Hello all, I have finished moving and now can cook again! I've done my 17th week - Sikkim!\n\nSikkim is a north eastern Indian state with beautiful mountains and meadows. Its cuisine is influenced by its boardering countires - Bhutan, Tibet, and Nepal - as well as its many ethnic tribes and communities. Fresh vegetables and rice (alongside other grains like millet and barely) are common in Sikkim cuisine, with lots of delicious tangy and spicy flavours. Interestingly, Sikkim has 100% organic and sustainable farming practices. Very cool!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe two dishes I choose were phagshapa and phingsha.\n\n* **Phagshapa** is a pork dish cooked with chillies and white radish. Very few ingredients and so simple to make, it ends up as such a comforting and tasty dish. Perfect for lazy weekends. I've never had white radish before, and it tastes like a sweeter potato (not as sweet as a sweet potato). The liquid part should be thin and translucent, but mine was completely opaque. I think I cooked my radishes too long so they broke down and made the liquid thick. It was sill tasty but I know to add the radishes at a later stage. [This is what my phagshapa looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/20wRW0q.jpg)\n* **Phingsha** is dish with meat and glass noodles, and served with rice or bread. I cooked mine with chicken and ate it with rice. Again, another simple dish to make. Although, I bought the wrong type of glass noodles. There was only one product in the shop that said \"glass noodles\", which I bought and it was a Korean brand. I noticed it looked too thick compared to the picture and then I realised I need a different type of glass noodle (i.e. mung bean vermicelli). Oh well, I know for next time. [This is what my phingsha looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/fYnz4rH.jpg)\n\nI loved Sikkim. Pretty much every north eastern state has given me new ways to cook food and I am loving it. I finally used mustard oil (for the phingsha) and it was great! Question - my bottle says \"for external use only\" even though I used it for cooking. I looked online, and I didn't really get much of an answer. It seems as though the west don't use oil on high temperatures like in Asia, which seems to make the oil safer for consumption. So that may be why it's only sold for external use in the UK? Can anyone shed some light on this? I'm still going to use it for cooking though.\n\nI recently bought this cookbook: \"India: The Cookbook\" by Pushpesh Pant. If anyone with Indian cooking experience really wants to dive into the Indian cusine, I highly recommend this book. It is *huge* and comes with recipes from all over India along with some cultural knowledge! But I do emphisise that you have some Indian cooking experience before buying this book. A lot of the recipes are not that detailed so it requires some previous knowledge, such as knowing what a curry looks like when the oil splits or knowing when raw spices are cooked.\n\nMy next state is Karnataka! Very excited to continue my cooking project and Karnataka has amazing food. Suggestions welcome, as always. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 - Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 8 - Nagaland](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 9 - Goa](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 10 - Telangana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/10cm8rn/week_10_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 11 - Punjab](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/110kmj8/week_11_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 12 - Jammu and Kashmir](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11cjv4k/week_12_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 13 - Haryana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11pjgxo/week_13_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 14 - Bihar](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/122yblo/week_14_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 15 - Andaman and Nicobar Islands](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/12gc7hh/week_15_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 16 - Odisha](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/12w81fy/week_16_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~For some reason, reddit won't let me copy & paste from my previous post so I can't post the full index of my previous cooking posts :(~~\n\n~~Until this is fixed, here is the link to the previous post (week 16), where you can get access to the full index:~~ [~~Week 16 - Odisha~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/12w81fy/week_16_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/13ns7fg/week_17_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1684673339.0, "score": 111, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/13ns7fg/week_17_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

It should have a glossy and slightly oily surface so it wont stick to your plate. Make all of the balls the same way and set aside. Make sure the balls are smooth with no cracks in the surface, this could let in oil and make them crack\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***To make the syrup:***\n\n1. add a large pan to the stove and add the sugar, water, cardamom powder, cracked cardamom pods, saffron, rose water and lemon juice. Heat on a low to medium heat until fully dissolved stirring every minute to stop the sugar sticking.\n2. turn up the heat and simmer until you get a light sticky syrup that just clings to your spoon, you don\u2019t want anything too thick as it wont sink into the Gulab Jamun balls\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Fry the balls:***\n\n1. heat some oil or ghee on a medium heat to 150 Celsius, too hot and you\u2019ll end up with burnt Gulab Jamun on the outside before they are cooked all the way through.

Continue to stir every minute for around 10 minutes to ensure they are evenly cooked and coloured.\n3. after 10 minutes carefully take out 1 of the Gulab and cut it in half with a knife to see it it\u2019s ready. If there is still dough it\u2019s not cooked yet so continue for a few more minutes.\n4. when ready turn off the heat and carefully lower the Gulab into the hot syrup mixture, stir gently then leave to soak for around 3 hours.\n5. stir occasionally so they are coated, they will double in size so make sure your pan is big enough, using a frying pan is fine, just move them around every 1/2 hour so they can sit and soak up the syrup\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can then serve directly or refrigerate for a day or 2 until needed.

Adding both is necessary as oil provides crispiness and ghee makes Samosa flaky.\n\n\nStep 5 : Mix it well until it starts holding shape when you press it.\n\n\nStep 6 : Now add cold water to dough to make a stiff dough.\n\n\nNote : Do NOT overwork the dough or knead it. Doing so results in development of more gluten than required.\n\n\nStep 7 : Keep the dough cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10 minutes atleast.\n\n\n**While the dough is resting, lets prepare our Filling.**\n\n\nStep 1 : Take a pan and turn the flame to low. Add cumin seeds, coriander seeds and fennel seeds.\n\n\nStep 2 : Roast it on low flame until they start releasing aroma.\n\n\nStep 3 : Now add Fenugreek Leaves and roast it no more than 10 seconds else it\u2019ll get burn quickly.\n\n\nStep 4 : Take these out and grind them coarsely.\n\n\nStep 5 : Now in the same pan, add oil and turn the flame to high.\n\n\nStep 6 : Roast these until the raw smell goes away.\n\n\nStep 7 : Add potatoes and roast them on high flame until they get soft. Keep strirring or they\u2019ll stick to the bottom.\n\n\n*Note : We are not using boiled potatoes, instead we are roasting raw potatoes on high flame. This gives filling a unique roasted flavour that really complimets the crust of the samosa.*\n\n\nStep 8 : Add the ground spice that we made earlier as well as the dry spices.\n\n\nStep 9: Turn the flame to medium and roast the spices for 1 minute while continuously stirring.\n\n\nStep 10 : Add little bit of water to combine spices.\n\n\nStep 11: Now mash the potatoes just a bit so that they get kind of together. Leave out the chunks of potatoes as we don\u2019t to mash them  completely.\n\n\nStep 12 : Filling is ready. Let it cool down a bit before you use it.\n\n\n*Now on to make Samosa:*\n\n\nStep 1 : Take the dough and roll it into a cylindrical shape.\n\n\nStep 2 : Divide it in equal portions.\n\n\nStep 3 : Take one portion, make and ball out of it and flatten it.\n\n\nStep 4 : Now using a rolling pin, roll out the semi thin sheets. It should be even every where.\n\n\nStep 5 : Using a round plate or lid, cut the sheet in a perfect circle.\n\n\nStep 6 : Remove the fringes and stretch the two ends of the sheet, making an oblong shape.\n\n\nStep 7 : Now cut one side of the sheet in stripes in in the centre of the sheet. ( see video for reference)\n\n\nStep 8 : Apply little water on one side of sheet and fold the sheet and match the other half of it.\n\n\nStep 9 : Seal the edges properly.\n\n\nStep 10 : Now, flip the sheet and apply water to one end and close it over the other end to make a cone.\n\n\nStep 11 : Take a spoonful or two of the filling and fill it inside.\n\n\nStep 12 : Now apply little water on the open side of the cone and seal the two sides.\n\n\nNote : Whenever making Samose, keep the dough and prepared samosa covered with a damp cloth so that they don\u2019t loose their moisture.\n\n\nStep 13 : Now, put the samosa in the wok filled with oil on low. Make sure the oil isn\u2019t hot.\n\n\n*Note : Always put the samosa in oil that\u2019s not hot as  the oil heats gradually on low flame and cooks samosa.*\n\n\nStep 14 : Samosa will be done in about 15 minutes on low flame. Make sure you stir occasionally.\n\n\nStep 15 : Once Samosa is done from all the sides, take it on a paper towel.\n\n\nA good samosa should always have a smooth crust and no bubles.\n\n\nServe it with a hot Tea or tomato ketchup.

Cover it and keep aside.\n\n**For Filling**\n\n1. Heat oil in a small kadhai/pan. Add cumin seeds, ginger-green chili paste and pinch of hing. Saut\u00e9 for few seconds.\n2. Now add boiled green peas, all remaining spices, and salt. Mix well and crush it with spatula.\n3. Add beasn, mix again and saut\u00e9 for few minutes. Remove it into a small bowl and let it cool down.\n\n**To make Kachories**\n\n1. Take the prepared dough and knead it for a minute.\n2. Divide the dough into small-small size balls. Take a ball, roll it on the kitchen surface and make a circle/disk. Leave the center little thicker than edges.\n3. Place 1 tsp of filling on the center of the disk, pull the edges of disk to wrap the filling, warp it and make a ball, then using the base of your palm slowly flatten them like Puri.\n4. Use same process for other balls. Once all done then cover it and keep aside.\n5. Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. To check if oil is ready, put a little piece of dough in the oil. Dough should sizzle and come up very slow.\n6. Fry them on medium-low heat. After they start to puff, slowly turn them over. Fry until golden-brown on both sides.\n7. Matar Kachori is ready, serve with coriander chutney, dates tamarind chutney, sev or as per your choice.\n\n**Notes**\u2022 Kachories can be stored in a refrigerator for at least a week in an airtight container.  \n\u2022 You should fry Kachories on low heat. If Kachories are fried on high heat, then they will get soft and not be crispy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/hwyhga/matar_kachori_i_made_this_last_night_omg/", "created_utc": 1595581386.0, "score": 110, "author": "DoKtor2quid", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/hwyhga/matar_kachori_i_made_this_last_night_omg/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Cuisine of the week: Fiji-Indian food!", "selftext": "Bula fellow redditors!\n\nI'll be taking you through Indo-Fijian cuisine, but it's probably best if I start with some historical \nbackground on how and why Indians wound up in the Pacific. Indians first came over to Fiji in large numbers as indentured labourers (the same system that sent people to the Caribbean, South Africa, and Mauritius), working on sugar plantations starting from 1879. These labourers are known as girmitiyas (from agreement, their contracts) had 5 year contracts and the majority stayed in Fiji after that time. The majority of girmitiyas came from eastern UP and adjoining areas of Bihar, with fewer people from western UP, Rajasthan, Nepal, and Punjab, along with a large South Indian contingent from Tamil Nadu, Andhra, and Kerala. At the end of indentured labour Gujaratis and more Punjabis arrived as free migrants. Fiji-Hindi, an eastern Hindi language related to Bhojpuri and Awadhi developed, and is spoken by everyone of Indian origin these days, while other languages are sometimes spoken at home. Other ethnic groups are native Fijians (kaiviti), Europeans, and Chinese people. Intermarriage is pretty common, so you end up with really interesting extended families.\n\nThe food of Indians in Fiji is vegetable based due to the abundance of fresh produce on the island, and most dishes are designed to show off the properties of the vegetables. There seem to be (at least in my family) some pretty strict rules on how each vegetable should be treated. For example lauki (calabash) is cooked with onion in a fair bit of oil and spiced with turmeric and chilli powder. Okra on the other hand is done very simply fried with onions without spices and finished with citrus juice. Karela (bitter gourd) is dusted in masala, turmeric and chilli and deep fried. I think a lot of this treatment of veg comes from South Indian food. Other veg includes greens, potato, cabbage, pumpkin, cauliflower, moringa drumsticks and leaves, gongura (khatta bhaji), toroi, and many more. \n\nI'm half North Indian (Bhojpur/Awadh), and half South (Andhra/Kerala), so I eat a lot of rasam, avial, dosa, idli, moru etc too. Toor dhal is the most widely consumed, sometimes mixed with masoor, and urid and moong dhal is also eaten less commonly. The usual tarka is mustard and cumin seeds in ghee, with onions, curry leaves (known as tej patti), and crushed garlic. \n\nAs for carbs, roti is the primary bread, and rice is widely eaten too. Taro and cassava are also consumed.\n\nMeat dishes are normally cooked in a strong masala gravy without any yoghurt etc. Meat delicacies include jugli murgi (wild chicken), goat curry, and spicy pulao. Being surrounded by the ocean seafood is common, with crab, prawn, and fish curries being favourites, along with shellfish like mussels and clams, all cooked with varying degrees of sauce. One thing is for sure, meat and seafood dishes in Fiji are likely to be spicy! Another standard South Pacific thing is corned mutton curry, or tin tuna/mackerel curry. \n\nSweets are big, laddoo, barfi, jalebi, peda, etc. Snacks include [bhajia](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/e2/7f/7b/e27f7b8c35944033c09f6c38eea3f096.jpg) (with spinach), samosa, pakora of cassava and taro, and my favourite [bara](http://gourmetlovebites.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/photo-4.jpg) (vada) made from split peas which are ground too fine.\n\nTea is king in Fiji, with sweet pot tea the norm with or without milk. Herbal tea made from lemongrass leaves is also made. Kava is enjoyed by a lot of people, and beer and rum are common booze.\n\nThere is a great deal of cultural crossover between the various ethnic groups of Fiji, with indigenous staples like roro/palusami, taro leaves cooked in coconut milk, and lovo, meat and veg cooked in an underground oven over hot stones, being loved by all. There is also a variety of Chinese food made with little quirks like green chilli garnishes and roti or taro on the side. Judging from a recent visit, roti parcels are a standard lunch regardless of ethnicity.\n\nI've only given a broad overview of things, so if there's anything you want to know more about just ask!\n\nVinaka vakalevu!\n\nEDIT: I have more stuff! Breadfruit (as in Mutiny on the Bounty), known as uto, is native to the South Pacific, and is used in place of potatoes in tarkaris with thinner gravy. Unripe jackfruit is cooked in heaps of oil, curry leaves, and masala, and is really nice. \n\nA typical Hindu wedding will have a lot of guests attending, 4-500 people is normal and sometimes even up to 1000 people show up (like at my parents' wedding)! A typical menu for the wedding day is puri, veg pulao, aloo channa/baingan/mattar, dhal, kachumber. \n\nHaving traveled around India a fair bit, I (naturally) found the food of of Eastern UP and adjoining Bihar quite similar to Fiji, though in India the gravies are heavier and spicier. Since I have a Malayali grandmother who is an excellent cook, I found that the food between Kochi and Alappuzha was pretty spot on, especially the dry chicken curry and whole spiced fried fish.

{"title": "Week 4 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Manipur", "selftext": "Hi everyone! This is my fourth week - Manipur!\n\nManipur is a North Eastern state in India and my chosen dishes were Manipur kangshoi and ooti thongba.\n\n* **Manipur kangshoi** is vegetable stew with fish (you can also have this completely vegetarian). Specifically, it uses ngari, which is fermented freshwater fish called pool barb. Now, I couldn't find ngari locally and I did consider using fermented Swedish fish but I thought that might be too much of a different flavour. So I ended up using dried trevally instead. If I ever find ngari, I will definitely buy it to make this dish. The kangshoi also uses smoked fish but the recipes I followed said any smoked fish is fine, so I used smoked mackerel. This dish was such an easy dish to make - you pop all the ingredients into a pot and let it simmer till cooked. I layered the flavours (so adding my aromatics first, then then veg, and then the fish) as this is what I am used to doing, but it was still very simple. You can use any veg too, I ended up using cauliflower, peas, potato, squash, tomato, and spinach. [This is what my Manipur kangshoi looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/WS1Sve9.jpg)\n* **Ooti thongba** is a split yellow pea curry. Again super simple to make (I used chickpeas as that's what I had), but the unique thing about this was that it used baking soda. I've only ever used baking soda in baked goods so I was excited to try it in a savoury dish. It add a subtle bitter, tangy taste but I'm not sure what else it did (if anyone knows, please tell me!). I added way too much though, even though it was a 1/4 teaspoon for two meals. I had to add lemon juice to reduce the taste. So if you ever make this dish, add a *teeny tiny bit*, less than an 1/8 teaspoon! Other than that, the process was similar to making a tadka dal. I saw variations of this dish where you added different vegetables like bamboo shoot or raw papaya. When I make this again, I think I'll add bamboo shoot as that sounds interesting. I also ate mine with iddiyappam as I thought it would go well with it, which it did! [This is what my ooti thongba looked like (note that the liquid was soaked up by the iddiyappam!).](https://i.imgur.com/kcl6c9N.jpg)\n\nManipur was very interesting to do, particularly because a lot of dishes used chinese chives! I've never had them before and it was really nice to try it. My shop didn't have much of it so I also added spring onions and British chives to make up for it. It was also interesting because a lot of recipes used chinese chives instead of onion, so I've found a new ingredient I can use for that lovely onion flavour! I want to try ngari too, it will be the first thing I look out for if I ever visit Manipur.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy next state is Chhattisgarh! I am thinking bafauri, still deciding the second dish. Though if you have any other suggestions to replace bafauri, please let me know!\n\n \n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1665331733.0, "score": 108, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 26, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Keep it covered for 10 minutes.\n\nStep 2) To make sugar syrup, add sugar, water and cardamom powder and cook for five minutes on medium flame. Keep stirring the syrup with a laddle.\n\nStep 3) Take out laddle, wait for a minute and check a drop of sugar syrup. It should have one string consistency. (Check video for reference)\n\nStep 4) Once done, turn off the flame and keep it aside \n\nStep 5) Now, take a lemon size portion out of dough and roll it between your palms.\n\nStep 6) Make a smooth and crack free ball. Make as many balls as you can from the dough. Keep them covered while your making balls.\n\nStep 7) Heat oil in a pan. We need to deep fry the balls so make sure there is enough oil for balls to swim.\n\nStep 8) Add 5 to 6 balls at once. Do not touch them just yet. \n\nStep 9) After 30 seconds or so start stirring the oil around the balls and they'll start turning around.\n\nStep 10) Touch them only once they've lightly turned golden or else you risk breaking them in oil.\n\nStep 11) Keep stirring the oil and once the balls turn golden brown (see color in video for Reference), carefully take them out using a strainer while removing excess oil.\n\nStep 12) Dip them immediately into warm sugar syrup. Syrup shouldn't be hot. Only warm.\n\nStep 13) Let them soak in syrup for atleast 30 minutes. The longer the better.\n\nStep 14) Now to prepare kheer/pudding, add 1 tbsp of ghee. This is not necessary if you're using milk solids as they already have plenty of fat. Milk powder needs bit of oil/ghee.\n\nStep 15) On low flame, add mawa/milk powder and cook until you get a nice aroma.\n\nStep 16) Add sugar to it and cook until it starts releasing oil. It'll easily take 10 minutes.\n\nStep 17) Add milk to it and cook for 5 more minutes. Turn the flame off.\n\nStep 18) Right before serving, take gulab jamun out of syrup and cut them in half.\n\nStep 19) Decorate the center of the balls with a some food color (see in picture for reference). \n\nStep 20) Now add a layer of Kheer in a bowl and add gulab jamun pieces. Add some almond slivers on it.\n\nStep 21) Add another layer of kheer and some more gulab jamun pieces. Finish it off with some almond slivers.\n\n**Note: You can also cover the gulab jamun with kheer once it sets incase you want a dry version of this sweet.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/jsusf3/diwali_special_gulab_jamun_kheer_by_yours_truly/", "created_utc": 1605188594.0, "score": 109, "author": "VickyPedia", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/jsusf3/diwali_special_gulab_jamun_kheer_by_yours_truly/", "html_title": ""}

This recipe is exactly like the butter chicken you get at fancy Indian restaurants. It's so delicious that you will never order butter chicken takeout again. \n\n### INGREDIENTS \n\n#### For chicken\n\n* [Click here for chicken tandoori ingredients](https://notacurry.com/chicken-tandoori/)\n\n#### For the sauce\n\n* 8 medium tomatoes\n* 3 tbsp butter/oil\n* 2-3 cardamoms\n* 1-2 bay leaves\n* 8-10 cloves of garlic minced\n* 1 green chili chopped\n* 2 tsp tomato paste\n* a few drops of orange food color optional\n* 1/2 tsp chili powder\n* salt to taste\n* 1 tsp honey/sugar\n* 1/4 cup fresh cream\n* 1 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves crushed\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\n#### For the chicken\n\n* [Click here for chicken tandoori recipe](https://notacurry.com/chicken-tandoori/)\n* For this recipe, the chicken needs to be cooked separately like a tandoori before adding it to the sauce. You can cook the tandoori chicken with bones in the sauce, but I like butter chicken boneless, so I separate the meat from the bones before adding it to the sauce. If you want to use boneless chicken for the recipe, instead of going through the trouble of making tandoori chicken, then just make the yogurt marinade (which is the second tandoori chicken marinade), marinate the chicken pieces, and broil for 16-20 minutes depending on the size of the pieces.\n\n#### For the Sauce\n\n* Broil the tomatoes at the highest temperature possible for 10-12 minutes, or until the skin starts to split and blister. Let them cool down. Then peel the skins. Alternately, you can immerse the tomatoes in boiling water for a minute or hold them over an open gas flame to peel the skin. But charring the tomatoes a little gives it a much better taste.\n* Puree the tomatoes using a little water.\n* Heat butter over medium heat in a non-stick pan.\n* Add cardamom and bay leaves and wait until they start spluttering (30 secs).\n* Add garlic and chopped green chilies and saute for 30 more seconds.\n* Add the tomato puree and tomato paste and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until the butter/oil has separated (13-15 mins).\n* Add chili powder, salt and sugar/honey, and food color; give it a stir and let simmer for 2 more minutes.\n* Add the tandoori chicken pieces and let simmer for 3-4 minutes.\n* Reduce heat, add cream and dried fenugreek and let simmer for 2-3 more minutes.\n* Adjust seasoning before removing from heat.\n* Garnish with a drizzle of fresh cream and cilantro/coriander leaves (optional).\n* Serve with naan, pita, or rice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/hho0w7/restaurant_style_butter_chicken/", "created_utc": 1593383823.0, "score": 105, "author": "aporochito", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/hho0w7/restaurant_style_butter_chicken/", "html_title": ""}

Give it a good stir and allow to simmer for 40 minutes stirring every now and then so nothing sticks to the bottom and burns\n7. turn off the heat and allow to cool slightly before blending until smooth\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want that\u2019s it, there\u2019s nothing more to do. You can simply store it in the fridge for up to 3 days or freeze in 125ml portions. To use, simply dilute with another 125ml of water per person giving you 250ml per dish\n\nI always top the blended base up to 4 litres and then it's always ready to go. I then store it in the freezer in some plastic tubs\n\nThe standard recipe produces 2 litres of concentrated or 4 litres of standard base gravy when complete, that\u2019s enough for 16 curries", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/o2kid6/easy_indian_base_gravy_quicker_recipe_less_fuss/", "created_utc": 1624005958.0, "score": 107, "author": "thecurrykid-co-uk", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/o2kid6/easy_indian_base_gravy_quicker_recipe_less_fuss/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The Story of Dal Makhani", "selftext": "The original Dal Makhani, which was made in the Western part of Punjab, which is now in Pakistan was made by the Peshawaris. The Punjabis sold this dal with a few flat unleavened bread called roti in Peshawar dhabas. When the Peshawaris came across the border after partition they brought this dal with them. It was made with whole urad dal and it simmered in a clay pot or handi for long stretches of time.\n\nIf one is a Punjabi then one has grown up with one\u2019s family\u2019s version of the ubiquitous urad dal, which is known as Maash ki dal in Sanskrit and Ma ki dal in the vernacular. It meant umpteen whistles of the huge cooker as the dal cooked away slowly for a long time. By far the tastiest \u2018black dal\u2019 as my friends choose to call it is the one that I have eaten in the free kitchens or Langars in various Gurdwaras. They are Sikh temples or places of worship. The dal cooks on huge wood fires in massive cauldrons, sometimes all night long. The taste is remarkably addictive and keeps one longing to go back for more.\n\nPopularly identified as Dal Makhani in most restaurants that serve Indian food, it has a similar history as Butter Chicken. Makhan means butter in the local language, so you know that this dal is bound to be a feast for dairy lovers.\n\nThe original dal which was made in the Western part of Punjab, which is now in Pakistan was made by the Peshawaris. The Punjabis sold this dal with a few flat unleavened bread called roti in Peshawar dhabas. When the Peshawaris came across the border after partition they brought this dal with them. It was made with whole urad dal and it simmered in a clay pot or handi for long stretches of time.\n\nThe other version of this dal which was more popular in East Punjab and Lahore has few red kidney beans, Rajmah and some split gram pulses known as chana dal. The addition of these two adds a certain viscosity and thickness to the dish.\n\nIt is definitely clear that the pre-partition recipe did not use any tomatoes in their Ma ki Dal. If they needed a souring agent they used curd or yogurt.\n\nThe origin of this new look and highly popular dish in Indian restaurants is as old as that of butter chicken, since the gentleman who originally coined the dish is Kundan Lal Gujral, who later became the owner of the Motimahal chain of restaurants. He was the one who popularised tandoori cooking in Daryaganj, Delhi after he came here. To recycle his drying out tandoori chicken he converted it into a tasty world-famous butter chicken by adding pureed tomatoes and dollops of cream and butter!\n\nHis grandson Monish feels that the Dal Makhni is the vegetarian version of that dish! Kundan Lal Ji thought of adding the same shahi ingredients to make a rich and royal combination for his vegetarian customers. He simply incorporated the Makhni sauce to the dal of his ancestors.\n\nThe other queen of dals is the Dal Bukhara, which was popularised by the ITC hotels in New Delhi. There is no blending of lentils in this one. The Moti Mahal dal is only 50 percent urad, the rest is kidney beans and split black gram. The Dal Bukhara gets its taste and viscosity from long hours of cooking. It simmers in a master pot all night. This slow cooking process is what sets it apart, while in other restaurants it is cooked once in a day and when customers come, it is taken out of and given a fresh tempering with the addition of cream and tomatoes.\n\nConnoisseurs feel that the Moti Mahal version was the result of improvisation done by refugees who had to make a living, while Bukhara is one of the costliest places to eat. They can afford to be exclusive. Even the water they use is filter water in order to standardise the taste.\n\nSource: [https://www.differenttruths.com/travel-getaways/history-culture/food-history-culture/the-story-of-dal-makhani/](https://www.differenttruths.com/travel-getaways/history-culture/food-history-culture/the-story-of-dal-makhani/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x9mu4x/the_story_of_dal_makhani/", "created_utc": 1662701107.0, "score": 104, "author": "CurrentThingMemes", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/x9mu4x/the_story_of_dal_makhani/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I made pav bhaji!", "selftext": "Here is a picture: [https://imgur.com/ECjhbnU](https://imgur.com/ECjhbnU)\n\nOverall, I really liked the bhaji with the bread I had. It was buttery and bursting with spices. It tasted really good with the red onion on the side and the reserved onion and spice mix. I would rate what I made a 7/10.\n\nThere were a few cons for me. For example, when I first made the base of tomato, potato, and peas, I used far too much water as I wasn't familiar with how much to use. This lead to the underlying base being a bit bland for my taste with not enough salt. I had to strain it through a colander to get a better consistency. Next time, I will use less water and also add some black pepper.\n\nAlso, the recipe called for 4 tablespoons of chili powder which I found made the bhaji too spicy to eat on its own for me. Although, I did substitute 1 tablespoon regular chili powder for cayenne powder as I did not want to use it all of my leftover chili powder. So, next time, I'll try with just 3 tablespoons of regular chili powder.\n\nHere's the recipe I used though I would like to hear your thoughts on the recipe and am open to a different pav bhaji recipe for next time as well.

If onions are too thin, cheese might slip away**\n\nStep 2) Seperate 3 biggest onion rings and put smallest ring inside of the biggest one. This will give us the idea of how much gap there is between rings to fill with cheese.\n\nStep 3) Now take cheese brick and cut strips out of it according to the gap size between rings. Cut them from the center to match the size of onions if required.\n\nStep 4) Push strips inside of the gap of the rings. Fill smallest of the gaps with small small cheese strips. Do this with every set of rings and once done, refrigerate them on a flat surface for as long we are preparing batter etc.\n\nStep 5) Take a deep bowl and add gram flour, salt turmeric Powder and red chilli powder. Add batches of water and keep mixing until we get flowing consistency batter.\n\n**Note: You can also use eggs instead of gram flour and water. Beat two eggs into a bowl instead and skip step 5.**\n\nStep 6) Take a plate and add flour.

{"title": "Some easy ways to cook vegetables.", "selftext": "Cooking vegetables (sabzi) is an integral part of Indian food. There has to be a vegetable everyday. Also, making curries of lentils like black eyed peas, mung, matki (moth beans) is a weekly activity in my home. Some recipes for sabzi are given below.\n\n\n[Most commonly used spices in my kitchen are abbreviated as :\n\n\n\u2022T(Turmeric)\n\n\u2022R (Red chilli powder)\n\n\u2022C (Cumin powder)\n\n\u2022Co (Coriander powder)\n\n\u2022G (Garam masala powder)]\n\n\nBhindi/okra - this is the most basic recipe for a lot of veggies in my kitchen. okra cut into discs and cooked plain ( I just temper some oil with some mustard seeds and add T R C Co, G) Mix well and let it cook till all sticky threads are removed. Add salt. Thats it. Eat with rice or chapati and can cook with literally any other vegetable like potato, onion, tomato, even peas. I make a lot other vegetables in the same way like snake gourd, ridge gourd, pumpkin (just add jaggery), coccinia (either thin discs or long slices), bitter gourd (add a LOT of jaggery or sugar).\n\n\nCabbage - heat oil. Add mustard seeds. Add some green chillies and chopped potato and mix well. Add green peas and spices (T C Co G ). Add chopped cabbage and mix well. Add salt and sugar. Cover and cook till potatoes are done).\n\n\nBottle gourd - heat oil and add spices ( same as the ones stated above), green chillies and diced bottle gourd. Add salt, mix well and cover and cook)\n\n\nCauliflower - made exactly like cabbage. Or : heat oil. Add chopped garlic (any amount is fine), thinly sliced onions and spices ( T R C Co G). Add salt. Add cauliflower florets and mix well. Cover and let cook.\n\n\nCluster beans - cut cluster beans into small half inch pieces. Heat oil and add mustard seeds, chopped garlic, sesame seeds, carom seeds, T R C Co G, cluster beans, salt, jaggery. Mix well. Add water and cover and cook on low flame till the beans are soft but not mushy. Once that happens, remove lid and heat on high flame while stirring continuously till water evaporates completely.\n\n\nFrench beans - heat oil. Add mustard seeds, T R C G Co, curry leaves, desiccated coconut (dry or fresh), chopped beans and salt. Add a little water and cover and cook just like cluster beans.\n\n\nCapsicum/green bell peppers - there are 3 ways i make this one. 1. Just like okra. 2. Make a curry of onion, tomato, ginger garlic pastes, salt and spices  like you would for say butter chicken. Add chopped potatoes and bell peppers and cover and cook. 3. Chop into really small pieces. Cook like okra. Just add a little more oil. After it is cooked add gram flour to it and mix well and cover and cook for around 5 more minutes so that the gram flour gets incorporated into the vegetable.\n\n\nCucumber - grate cucumber and make like capsicum method 3.\n\n\nFenugreek leaves - 1. With chopped potato. Make like okra. 2. Heat oil. Add chopped garlic and make like bell pepper method no. 3.\n\n\nSpinach - both ways exactly like fenugreek leaves.\n\n\nMake parathas of vegetables like potatoes, onions, cabbage, cauliflower, peas, carrots, fenugreek leaves, spinach puree, etc.\n\n\nCoriander leaves are our best friends in indian cooking. Don't feel shy in adding loads to all of these vegetables.\n\n\nAll of these taste very good with rotis but don't worry if you don't have access to them. Cook some rice and eat these with some yogurt. Add pickles if you desire or chutneys.\n\n\nHave a lot more but this is turning into a long answer. Happy cooking!\n\n\nEdited: totally forgot about my husband's favourite lol. Egg plant the small ones either green or purple or spotted -  Add in chopped potatoes, onions, tomatoes and make like okra. Add jaggery.\n\nThe long ones are used for making bharta. Roast the eggplants on open flame till the peel is black and crusty. The insides should be soft and mushy. Mash them well. Heat oil, add cumin seeds, T C Co, green chillies, chopped onion and tomato. Mix well and add the mashed eggplant. Cover and cook. Garnish with a lot of coriander leaves.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/biadsr/some_easy_ways_to_cook_vegetables/", "created_utc": 1556451668.0, "score": 99, "author": "anothergurlonreddit", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/biadsr/some_easy_ways_to_cook_vegetables/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Mum's Mangalorean Coconut Chicken Curry (Chicken roce curry)", "selftext": "Mangalore is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Karnataka. I have a few of my late mother's recipes saved and this is by far my favourite. Real comfort food for me and the wife. It goes great with near any starch(bread, rice, pita). I would even have a modified version with [some zero carbs \"noodles\"](http://imgur.com/a/0Tg9H) when I did keto. The bird's eye chilies tend to give it quite the kick, and the spice level tends to vary based on the quality of chili. I'd probably halve the number of chilies if you're not great at handling spice.\n\n**Mangalorean Coconut Chicken Curry**\n\n*Servings 7-8*\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n3 tbsp oil/ghee\n\n4 medium onions ~500g - halved and sliced\n\n4 tsp red chili powder\n\n1 tsp black pepper powder\n\n1 tsp turmeric powder\n\n1 kg chicken breast - cut into bite sized pieces **OR** whole chicken cut \n\n2 tsp ginger-garlic paste\n\n2 medium tomatoes ~300g - diced\n\n8 green bird's eye chilies - slit lengthwise (halve or remove the seeds if you can't take the heat)\n\nSalt to taste\n\n1 tin coconut milk/cream ~400ml\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. On a medium flame, heat up the oil/ghee in a saucepan. Fry **half** the sliced onions till they are translucent and start to turn a golden-brown colour.\n1. Lower the heat to a medium-low/low and add the red chili powder, pepper powder, and turmeric powder. Fry for 30 seconds till fragrant. You want the powders mixing with oil, you want them to give off an aroma but not burn. A little under 30 seconds is about right.\n1. Add the chicken with the ginger-garlic paste and fry for about a minute.\n1. Add the rest of the sliced onions, tomatoes and green chilis. Also add salt, tasting the masala to see if you'd like it to have more salt or sourness. A teaspoon of white vinegar helps if you like it a little sour. If it starts to dry out too much before the chicken is cooked, add a little water. Usually, the tomatoes will let out quite a bit of their water for this part.\n1. When the chicken is cooked, add the coconut cream/milk and bring it to a low simmer. Some like the taste of coconut more than others so, keep an eye on the consistency as you add the milk/cream and keep tasting as you go. You will end up with just the right amount of coconut taste. Garnish with some chopped coriander/cilantro if you have it on hand.\n\n**EDIT:** Couple things I forgot to mention - *Roce* is the word for Coconut milk in Konkani, which is one of the languages spoken in Mangalore. Also, according to mum, you can also try making this curry without the coconut milk by halving the amount of red chili powder. I have never tried it this way, but you might want to reduce the number of green chilies as well.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/6xlvhc/mums_mangalorean_coconut_chicken_curry_chicken/", "created_utc": 1504358279.0, "score": 101, "author": "pqgbd", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/6xlvhc/mums_mangalorean_coconut_chicken_curry_chicken/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I've seen the name used to refer to all kinds of flatbreads, but one defining characteristic - or so I thought - was that it is unleavened. I've also seen and heard it used to refer to any kind of bread, unleavened or not.\n\nThis is a picture of what I got:\n\n[https://ibb.co/288Zf47](https://ibb.co/288Zf47)\n\n[https://ibb.co/ykRytqC](https://ibb.co/ykRytqC)\n\n[https://ibb.co/M6wW8z8](https://ibb.co/M6wW8z8)\n\nIn my understanding of cooking(or baking) these little bubbles or holes do not form when frying or heating unleavened dough, but is rather something you'd see when you heat a thin layer of fermented batter.\n\nI'm arguing that what we see in the image is made from dosa batter - or is even injeera. It's not at all crispy like a dosa, and rather tasteless. And it doesn't have the vague fermented taste of an injeera, either. Bread, as far as I know, is made from dough and not from batter. But then again - if roti could refer to any type of bread, isn't injeera often referred to as a bread? If that is so, could the... thing.. in the picture actually be a roti of any definition?\n\n(The menu clearly states that it is supposed to be unleavened/unfermented and woked in oil to give a light roasted taste - it is obvious that this is not the item described in the menu)\n\nWhat does the panel say?

Was it like putting a pinch of salt into a baked good, where it makes a huge difference but isn't salty. Or were we talking actually salty. So I ordered it, I had to know.\n\nWhen I got our food home I went for the lassi. My first sip was confused. I felt like I was drinking cottage cheese. But you know, I like cottage cheese. On my second sip I started to get it. The way tomato juice is both refreshing and craveable, so too is the salt lassi. But more tart, creamier, maybe even fresher.\n\nI made it at home, here are the proportions that worked for me.\nA scant 2c plain yogurt, 5% fat\nA scant cup (as needed) of chilled water\n1/2- 1 tsp salt, to taste.

{"title": "Why does BIR base gravy use way more Ingredients than base gravies used in Indian restaurants in India? and some other differences!", "selftext": "Trying to start a discussion, hopefully without any toxic arguments or offending anyone lol.\n\nIndian guy here.  Moved to USA in my early 20s. Taught myself how to cook Indian restaurant cooking because of how much I missed that distinct taste, I am pretty good at it :P.\n\nVisited London recently and realized that a LOT of BIR dishes tasted VERY similar to each other, sometimes no real difference between any two random menu items in the \"curries\" category. Decided to explore BIR a bit and I was a bit surprised to see how many veggies often go into the base gravy and that most places use one base gravy and there seems to a major use of Patak's in quite literally everything.\n\nThere is a base gravy that has like 5-6 different veggies, Why? \n\nThe three base gravies used in Indian restaurants in India are basically,\n\n1) [onion + tomato](https://youtu.be/HLbAhwPWhV8?t=108) ,\n\n2) [tomato](https://youtu.be/InlAguG3ttY) and  \n\n3) [onion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9DGqgVTAQA&t=3s) \n\nThey are very easy to make and require way less ingredients than the singular BIR base gravy and gives a lot of variability in terms of taste of the dish you are making by changing the ratios according to the recipe. eg Butter Chicken uses only the Makhani gravy, Paneer/Chicken Tikka masala uses all 3 with Onion Tomato masala being the main star. \n\nNow yes the argument can be that it's one vs three, yea but cabbage, green/red peppers or even carrots (I am guessing to cut the tartness from canned tomato?) etc are not the things I have seen being used in India.\n\n[I mean this is just crazy and intimidating to a new cook but I am guessing not very widely used either?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOn9wkjLpCc)\n\nThe amount of cream was another surprise. I have only ever seen restaurant chefs in india (and on YouTube) use a small amount of cream, a couple of tablespoons or so compared to BIR which literally drowns the curries in cream, sometimes using way more than a cup.\n\nAgain not trying to start a flame war, just trying to understand the whats/whys/hows and have a discussion.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/vag3k1/why_does_bir_base_gravy_use_way_more_ingredients/", "created_utc": 1655015969.0, "score": 100, "author": "None", "num_comments": 62, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/vag3k1/why_does_bir_base_gravy_use_way_more_ingredients/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Crunchy Paneer Fried Rice.", "selftext": "[Picture](https://i.imgur.com/HyLDgOk.jpg)\n\n[3 minutes video recipe](https://youtu.be/8R90yrAq0YI)\n\n###**WRITTEN RECIPE**\n\n###**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* Paneer - 200 gm (Cut into cubes)\n\nDRY SPICES\n\n* Kashmiri Red Chilly Powder\n* Turmeric Powder \n* Garam Masala Powder\n\nVEGGIES ETC\n\n* Mustard Oil - 1/2 tbsp + 2 tbsp + as required for shallow or deep frying paneer.\n* Salt as per taste.\n* Minced Garlic - 1/2 tbsp\n* Finely Chopped Green Chillies - 3 \n* Chopped Beans - 1/2 cup\n* Peas - 1/2 cup\n* Finely Chopped Carrot - 1/3rd cup\n* Sliced Onions - 1/2 cup\n* Lemon Juice - 1 tbsp\n* Chopped Coriander Leaves - as required.\n* Rice (cooked) - 2 cups of as required. (You can also use leftover rice)\n\n###**DIRECTIONS**\n\nStep 1) Cut Paneer into medium size cubes and add them into a bowl. \n\nStep 2) Add Dry spices, salt and 1 tsp of oil. Give it a mix. No need to rest it. You can use it immediately.\n\nStep 3) Heat oil in a pan and add paneer cubes to it. Shallow fry them from all sides until they get crispy on the surface and their color turn golden.\n\nStep 4) Once golden take them out. Save the oil as we'll use it in the next step. This step is important as the oil has all the flavour of spices and it's what that'll flavor the rice.\n\nStep 5) Now in a pan, heat 2 tbsp of the same oil we used to fry paneer. Heat the oil on high flame.\n\nStep 6) Add all the veggies except for onions and stir fry them while continuously tossing and stirring the veggies.\n\n**Note: Stir fry on high heat gives it a smoky flavor. If you keep the flame low, it'll make veggies loose their moisture. If you added salt along with veggies, the same will happen so add salt onions.**\n\n**Note: We haven't added onions in the beginning as they get cooked faster than other veggies and will turn golden brown which we don't want in this recipe.**\n\nStep 7) Once the veggies are done, add onions and stir fry until they get translucent.\n\nStep 8) Add salt, Paneer cubes and lemon juice. Toss them well.\n\nStep 9) Add cooked rice to it and give it a gentle mix. We don't want to break rice so use a soft edged spatula.\n\nStep 10) Add chopped coriander leaves and give it a final mix. \n\nCrunchy Paneer Fried Rice is ready.

If you don't get a PM from me then consider yourself on the waiting list in case one of the first 12 bail.  Thanks everyone!***\n\nSo my curry trees decided to put out some more seeds this year.  It seems like an every-other-year kind of thing.  I only have about 38 that look like they'll be viable so I'm going to limit this to 12 people, who will each receive 3 seeds.  I am going to ask for $3.50 for shipping, just because I'm kind of broke right now and can't afford to cover it myself.  I'm also going to limit it to the lower 48.\n\nHere are some pics:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2wd1rKa\n\nThe two on the right are my main plants that I've had for years, they're the ones that are producing seeds.  The 4 on the left were started from seed 2 years ago, when I did the first seed giveaway.  The first year they hardly grew at all, which was pretty disappointing, but this year they've taken off.  Now that I have a house with a back yard and stuff I'm planning to keep all of them, transplanting them into really big pots at some point.  I always cut them back in the winter and put them under fluorescent lights, then back outside in the spring.\n\nIn case you're wondering, I use the leaves for my curry leaf hot sauce.  I have a [hot sauce company](https://www.boldbadgersauces.com/).  Rogan Ouch is the one with curry leaves.  Mods, if it's not cool to post the link message me and I'll edit the post to remove it.\n\nTo ship them I'll put the seeds in a little folded up piece of cardboard to keep them from getting crushed, and into a padded envelope.\n\nTo start the seeds just put them in some moist soil and keep them watered and somewhat warm.  They should pop up anywhere from a week to a month later.  I'd recommend at least cutting open the fleshy outer covering, if not outright removing it.  Note that a lot of times you'll get more than one stalk per seed.  I think the seeds are sort of lobed and each lobe has the potential to germinate into a separate stalk.\n\nThe first 12 people who post in this thread and say they want some will get seeds.  If you're one of the 12 I'll send you a PM to get your shipping address and send you my paypal address for the $3.50.

{"title": "Week 28 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Ladakh", "selftext": "Hello, I'm back with week 28 and it was Ladakh!\n\nLadakh is a union territory in the north of India, and famous for its mountains and valleys. It is one of the highest places in the world, earning its name the \"land of the high passes\". Ladakh's cuisine is rich with fresh vegetables and meat, and common carbs include pasta, noodles, and dumplings. Some dishes, such as momos and noodle soup, are popular world-wide and is also eaten in the neighbouring country of Tibet. From the recipes I've seen, Ladakhi food isn't spicy and uses few ingredients, making it simple and light to eat. Ladakhi food seems to be growing more popular across India, according to the many Indian news articles on its cuisine.\n\nThe dishes I chose were skyu and khambir.\n\n* **Skyu** is a pasta soup dish. It starts with a quick stir fry of vegetables and spices before adding water, milk, and raw pasta made from atta flour. Incredibly simple dish to make and very quick, I made it under 30 minutes. It was also more filling that I expected it to be, but probably because I made too much pasta. I also made the pasta thicker than what it typically looks like, but it still tasted great. I need to work on its shape as it didn't have the cute dimples it should have. [This is what my skyu looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/CaWqCNv.jpg)\n* **Khambir** is a flatbread made from atta dough that has been fermented overnight. It has a slightly sour taste to it (similar to sourdough bread) and delicious on its own. I ate mine with leftover vegetable curry. Khambir is also commonly eaten with butter tea, but I wasn't sure I'd like a savoury tea but please do make it if it interests you! Khambir was easy enough to make, just like making chapati with a couple extra steps. Although, I burnt mine a little when I cooked it over the flames on my gas stove. It didn't affect the taste, if anything it was more charred than burnt (I say trying to excuse the burning...). [This is what my khambir looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/P37zsES.jpg)\n\nAnother great place to do, Ladakh was super interesting. This was the first time I made a traditional Indian pasta, and the first time making fermented bread. More new recipes to add to my list!\n\nMy next week will be Maharashtra!

{"title": "Why is chicken with skin on absent in north Indian or South Indian cuisine?", "selftext": "I'm from Northeast India myself and in most kitchens there, chicken is prepared with skin included ie we pluck only the feathers instead of tearing off the skin and discarding it entirely (Some parts of Assam and Tripura seem to be exceptions but even there it's not completely unheard of). I've always been curious why  butchers in the rest of the country discard skin unless it is specifically asked for, and why it's absent in usual restaurant fare like chicken curries, biryanis and tandooris. Are there specific cultural or historical reasons for this? Or is it simply that people don't care much for it? It's already non-veg with or without skin, so it's not a matter of Hindu religious restrictions (I assume), and AFAIK it isn't haram either. \n\nI speak only from personal experience in Delhi NCR, and what friends have told me of Lucknow, Chandigarh, Kerala, and Chennai, so my understanding draws only from metropolitan spaces. I am also curious to know to what extent my assumption hold true, with regards to caste, class, community, and geography (and why it would be so). I ask this because I have seen chicken with skin on in certain 'village cooking' type YouTube channels, and also because I am aware that while offal is usually absent in the majority diet same as chicken skin, it is still consumed in certain spaces (I have enjoyed liver and brains from Karim's, and friends have informed me that certain communities in Chennai consume chicken giblets), so it would make sense that there might also  be spaces where chicken skin is an authentic part of cuisine,  even if it isn't mainstream.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/134eoka/why_is_chicken_with_skin_on_absent_in_north/", "created_utc": 1682922665.0, "score": 93, "author": "None", "num_comments": 64, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/134eoka/why_is_chicken_with_skin_on_absent_in_north/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Dal Makhni - Is it supposed to be mind-blowing?", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nThe post is longer than I expected - TL;DR at the end.\n\nFrom what I've read and heard online Dal Makhani is supposed to be a luxurious, somewhat premium dish people usually make for special occasions. It's supposed to be characterized by it's rich, creamy texture and nutty, deep flavour.\n\nAs a vegetarian Indian cuisine enthusiast I was bound to attempt it someday and so I did a month ago for the first time. I followed [this recipe](https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/dal-makhani-recipe/) including the Dhungar method (about 2 minutes) and simmering the dal for a good 5-6 hours. When I finished the dal, garnished it with cilantro and cream and served with freshly baked naan I was ready for it to blow my mind. But it didn't. The texture was indeed luxurious, very creamy, the mouthfeel - great but the taste was... ok. Nutty - yes, somewhat deep. But not amazing, just ok.\n\nI thought I did something wrong so I decided to try out a different recipe. I followed [this one](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/dal-makhani-restaurant-style-recipe/), Dhungar for 3 minutes this time and simmered it even longer - 7-8 hours in total. It turned out slightly better (a matter of practice I guess) but didn't blow my socks off. I mean it's tasty and enjoyable but disproportionately to the amount of work and time it consumes. I could make a regular dal in 1/10 of that time and be similarly satisfied with the result so why bother to go through that long and laborious process?\n\nMy question is - is there anything about Dal Makhani I'm missing? Maybe these recipes are bad. Perhaps there's a common mistake that could have caused that? Or maybe my expectations were just set too high?\n\nPlease share your experience with home-made Dal Makhni.\n\nPS - most of the spices were relatively freshly bought and come from a source that hasn't let me down so far.\n\nTL;DR - Tried making Dal Makhani twice (different recipes), it was decent but not amazing.

{"title": "Recipie: Goat Masala", "selftext": " All Indian gravy/stewy things are called curries by ROW, but we Indians don't call them curries - we rather call dishes as per their given name or specialization.\n\nSo this is a Goat masala / Mutton masala - a thicker, spicier curry. \n\n*It can even stand for \"Dhaba style Mutton\" as this is what you get in unknown run-down eateries along side unknown roads going into unknown towns in India. I wouldn't call it a Mutton curry, as that is much simpler and runny and mostly cooked in pressure cookers.*\n\n*Ok and one bit about Goat and Mutton. Mutton is basically British for any kinda meat. But during British Raj, Goat was the most popular choice - as it was most widely available in India and also tender. So to this day, Mutton and Goat are interchangeable to the point that no-one calls it a Goat this/that. It's called a Mutton this/that.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 1: Ingredients**\n\n* 2lbs - Goat pieces (or goat 'mix' as the shops call it here in the US). \n\n*Steps:*\n\nWash it well - multiple times (coz instead of a butcher knife, they use saw for cutting, which essentially creates a bone powder - not good)  and drain out excess water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: Marinate**\n\n* 3 big spoons: Curd (Whole milk Indian Style. Don't go putting that low-fat dairy-free diet-yogurty-stuff in here.\n* 1 small spoon: Turmeric powder (This is not for taste - but purely for color, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties - so kinda mandatory)\n* 1 small spoon: Red Chilli powder (This is definitely for taste but also for color. Use a good red chilli powder - the more powerful the better - coz that'll take lesser amount)\n* 3 big spoons: Ginger-Garlic Paste (Mandatory. This is the base of curries. You could also do put half the amount in marinate, and half later while frying onions.)\n\n*Steps:*\n\n* Mix it well it in fridge for at least 2-4 hours. I leave mine overnight.\n\n*Tips*:\n\n* Don't add salt to marinate. It'll draw out juices and make the meat chewy\n* Marination time depends on meat tenderness. If you're getting fresh live meat like in India, it will so fresh and tender that it would be having spasms in your pot and hardly need marinating. For frozen meats, marinate is definitely needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 3: Onions**\n\n* 3 nos. - 3 inch in diameter. Red onions only (You need the pungency of the red. White/yellow will be too sweet)\n\n*Steps:*\n\n* Split them in half. Put each half flat-side down and cut into thin slices - as thin as you can. Cut along the axis - not across.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 4: Dry Spices**\n\n* 2-inch long: Cinnamon stick\n* 3 or 4 nos.: Large bay leaves\n* 1 small spoon: Whole Cumin (Jeera)\n* 1 small spoon: Shah Jeera (Black Cumin. NOT Kali Jeeri - which is Bitter Cumin. If you don't find Shah Jeera, skip it and increase quantity of normal Cumin above.)\n* 2 nos.: Black Cardamoms\n* 3 nos.: Green cardamoms\n* 8-10 nos.: Whole Black peppercorns (Do not grind)\n* 2-4 nos.: Cloves\n* 2-5 nos.: Whole dry Red Chillies (doesn't need to be too spicy. This is to get the chilli oil and color into the dish.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 5: Powder Spices**\n\n* 2 big spoons: Coriander powder (Coariander powder counteracts the sweetness of the onions)\n* 1 small spoon: Cumin powder (Has to be way less than coriander powder like 1:3 or 1:4)\n* 1 big spoon: Garam Masala (you can use less but you definitely do need at least a small spoon or the gravy would lack body/complexity)\n* 1 big spoon Meat Masala (Ty and find MDH brand - Everest/Priya/Mothers etc are all good, but MDH is the OG..the original king of spices in India). Needed to make a thicker, sweeter gravy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 6: Opening act**\n\n* Bring the marinated mutton out of the fridge. Let it rest.\n* Now put your pan to medium heat. Let it heat up. Add some oil - about 4 large spoons (If your meat has a lot of fat, go easy on the vegetable oil).\n\n***What kind of pot to use?*** *You need a saute pan/karahi/handi (something with a lid) and not too shallow and not too thin of a material. Handi is the best coz it allows the steam and heat to get constricted near the top. It shortens the cooking time by a lot. I don't have it and just use a deep saute pan with heavy base.*\n\n***What oil to use?*** *Well the only correct answer to this is Mustard oil. It is irreplaceable. But then you could also do with olive oil/vegetable oil/ghee etc. Ghee would be amazing, but too heavy. And yes I know Mustard oil has the US FDA warning about the erucic acid. But I also know that the FDA cares more about business priorities than your health. And even if it's true - simply don't eat too much of it. So use what you want.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Let the oil heat up. Read this 10 times. And even then I will repeat. Let the oil heat up.\n\n*Don't go too hot like fuming/smoking hot. Get to medium high heat. There should just be a little vapors coming from the oil. You can test by throwing a piece of Cumin in it. If it frizzles away happily - it's perfect. If it sits quietly, it means it's too cold. If it turns burns very fast, it's too hot.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Leave the heat on medium high, and now throw all the Dry Spices in the oil (In somewhat the same order if you can. It's ok if you don't)\n* Let the spices splatter and sizzle in the oil for a few seconds - say 10 seconds max if your heat is high enough - don't let them burn. \n* Throw in the onions. Mix vigorously. Keep on mixing and turning every 10 secs to allow more of the onions to come in touch with the base of the pan and get seared.\n\n*A little browning will impart a piece of heaven to your dish. Too much browning will make it bitter. Too less browning will cause onions to come in your mouth raw. I like to throw half a small spoon of sugar and equal amount of salt to this step. It helps in the browning by drawing out the onion moisture.* \n\n*There's no specified time here. As it all depends on your quantity, pan and heat. You need to achieve golden brown on the onions - not just stop when they are translucent. This is the only chance those onions will get to be caramelized and reject the oil used as cooking medium. If they don't cook properly, they'll hold on to the cooking oil and be soggy and obviously unhealthy.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 7: The heart of the story**\n\n* Once you think onions are done, add the mutton to it. (Remember heat is still on medium high). Stir it well. Break down the mutton (now blocky coz of the chill) and make sure the whole thing is mixed well. Cover it and let it fry.\n\n*This is the most important phase of this dish. You need to be careful and vigilant. You don't want mutton pieces to stick to the bottom of the pan and get burnt. At the same time you do want a good sear on all the pieces.* \n\n* Every 4-5 mins remove the lid, vigorously mix the whole thing and replace the lid. \n\n*This is an art. This is called 'bhun-na' in Hindi Or roasting/frying etc in English). You need to do this until you see meat shrinking from the bone from some of the more identifiable pieces like rib racks or shank cuts. The collagen will break down and the meat will shrivel and release its juices and oils and the fat and cartilages will dissolve into the oniony gravy - constantly thickening it.*\n\n*The meat will not be tender/eatable just yet, but it will be well on the way. A lot of steam will be coming out each time you open the lid. Be calm. That is the point. We need to remove most of the water from the meat, curd and onions so that we reach a point when the oils from all 3 get released into the gravy. This is a fine balance between heat, cover and moisture*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 7: The end game**\n\n* When you don't see too much creamy liquid floating around the pan and it feels like the bulk of the pan is just pieces of meat, reduce the heat to medium. \n* Add in half a spoon of salt and throw in all the powder spices. Mix vigorously and well. \n\n*Try to clean any stuff sticking to the base of the pan. This should be easy at this point if the oil has separated out from the meat and some steam is still going on. If there's no steam, try to add a little bit of water to the middle of the pan and use that to scrape around the base. With this much oil, the base should be clean - you don't want burnt bits stuck to the base as they encourage more sticking as oil can't reach those spots.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fry the powder spices with the meat pieces for a few mins. Don't let them burn though. Spices release oils into the gravy. If they don't, you'll feel them on the tongue as raw powder.\n* Now add water to your desired quantity. I like filling my pot up so that I can reduce it to a thickness I want towards the end, rather than starting out with too less and having to add more later - extending the time.\n* The goal is to blend everything in and allow the meat to absorb the flavors. Cover with lid. Reduce heat if needed. Let it boil. After every 5 mins, open, stir well and close lid.\n* This can go for an hour or so. Have a few beers.\n* The goal is to make meat fall off the bone - but you're the judge of how tender you want your meat.\n* When you think it is done, taste the gravy and adjust for salt.\n* At this point, I break a few green chillies by hand and toss them in. And also add a heaping handful of coriander.\n\nDone. Let it rest.\n\n*Such heavily spiced non-vegetarian curries are often not eaten immediately after cooking(Personal choice again). Let it rest for a bit. Rewarm and serve. Special tip: It will taste many times better if you eat it the next day.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Take it with a non-oily plain roti / white rice / appam / dosa.*\n\n*Add an Indian salad as a side - chop a few cucumbers, red onions, green chillies, coriander. Add lime juice, drops of mustard oil and salt.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Pic of the final thing:* https://imgur.com/a/y2pAtyO\n\nHope this satisfies your soul and extinguishes your Indian cravings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/nvauve/recipie_goat_masala/", "created_utc": 1623176908.0, "score": 94, "author": "boddhya", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/nvauve/recipie_goat_masala/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Start by heating the milk in a pan at least 2 inches higher than the liquid. **This is important as when the milk boils it does so very fast and can easily spill over**.\n2. Stir the milk every 30 seconds to stop it sticking to the pan.\n3. As the milk gets hotter stir more often.\n4. Keep an eye on the milk. Directly it starts to boil it will froth up so you will need to instantly turn off the heat and stir gently.\n5. Add the whole of the lemon juice.\n6. Continue to stir gently and you will notice the milk quickly starts to separate into clumps, the gentler you stir the bigger the pieces will remain.\n7. Allow to cool for 10-15 minutes then strain through a sieve to remove most of the water.\n8. If you have cheese cloth simply tip your strained paneer onto it then pull the edges up and tighten to remove more moisture. You could at this stage simply cover with a plate then apply something heavy on top to push out the moisture. If you don\u2019t have cheesecloth a clean tea towel will do just as well.\n9. Press into the shape you want your paneer to end up then place on a plate with another on top in the fridge for 60 minutes. This will remove slightly more liquid and form the paneer block.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo store, place it in enough water to cover the cubes in an airtight container and keep refrigerated for up to 7 days.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ftlfb3/how_to_make_paneer_from_scratch_at_home_using/", "created_utc": 1585830265.0, "score": 92, "author": "thecurrykid-co-uk", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/ftlfb3/how_to_make_paneer_from_scratch_at_home_using/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Cuisine of the Week: British Indian Food", "selftext": "---\n##[Cuisine of the week Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/wiki/location#wiki_our_regional_cuisine_threads)\n\n\n\nSomething a little different for you, this week - British Indian food! I was born in Britain and grew up there in an Indian family.  My family saw the explosion of Indian restaurants in the 70s and 80s to the point where \"*goin' for an Indian*\" was part of the English language.  One of my favourite Anglo-Indian comedy teams did this parody of Indians ['going for an English'](https://tune.pk/video/2490313/go-for-an-english-goodness-gracious-me).\n\nThere are lots of discussions regarding what is and what isn't 'authentic' Indian food.  The reality is, the power and reach of the British Empire meant that Indians moved around the commonwealth (not always by choice) and their food flavours and tastes went with them.  What happened is a fusion of various flavours, like we see with the Indian immigrants to the [Malay Peninsula](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/4ieq7m/cuisine_of_the_week_indian_cuisine_of_the_malay/).  The Anglo-Indian cultural interaction was so strong through the [Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) that British Indian food adapted to be a flavour all of its own.  \n\nThere will be purists that will firmly believe that Indian food *must* come from India, but there are many out there who embrace this inauthenticity - so much so it's hard to really know what constitutes an authentic Indian dish.  In fact, it's really hard to find truly authentic Indian restaurants in Britain as [most are run by the Bangladeshi community, rather than the Indian community](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/21/religion.bangladesh).  For example, you'll find many Anglicised recipes that include ['curry powder'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_powder) in the recipe, even though the yellowish curry powder doesn't exist in India, itself.  We do use spice blends, like garam masala, but it's not used as a 'cover-all' flavouring to replace individual spices as some recipe books try to do.  \n\nIn this post, I want to talk about a couple of examples of completed inauthentic Indian dishes that are so common in Britain that they've made their way back to India and you can find them in popular restaurants in Delhi to cater for the British tourism industry who are searching for flavours they're used to back home.\n\n\n**[Chicken Tikka Masala](http://ekantcookcurry.com/chicken-tikka-masala/)**\n\nChicken Tikka Masala epitomises British Indian Cuisine.  [The legend goes](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8161812.stm) that a diner in a Glasgow Indian restaurant ordered Chicken Tikka, which came out as a dry dish, as is traditional.  The diner explained that they were really after a gravy based curry, so sent it back.  The chef at the time opened a tin of tomato soup and poured it over the Chicken Tikka, added a few spices, and sent it back, much to the delight of the diner.  Whether the story is true or not is neither here nor there - it's part of the mythology of Indian cuisine in Britain - at any rate, it's a staple of British eating and was even picked as Britain's favourite dish some years back ([although, British palettes are moving on a little, now](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/10564444/Curry-why-the-British-are-moving-on-from-Chicken-Tikka-Masala.html)).\n\nYour friend and mine, Heston Blumenthoolinwool, set out to India to find the recipe for the perfect CTM.  He soon realised that there wasn't something there that reminded him of what he was looking for back home - the closest he found was the more traditional '[Murgh Makhani'](http://ekantcookcurry.com/murgh-makhani/) or 'butter chicken' (no, nothing like the insipid Butter Chicken you find in New Zealand or Australia).  Heston, in his inimitable way, took the very best aspects of what he found in India, matched it with the British influence and came up with the pretty damned good dish.  [See the full episode of his search for perfection, here](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xndufg_in-search-of-perfection-s2e1-chicken-tikka-masala_lifestyle).  And that's the beauty of how Indian food flavours and tastes span borders - the very best can be combined to become something new and wonderful.  \n\n**Balti**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_(food)\n\nBalti is another regular dish you'll find on British Indian menus that had no real meaning back in India when it comes to food.  'Balti' literally means 'bucket' in Hindi and Urdu.  There are a number of explanations as to why the dish is called a 'balti'.  It is most likely to do with the round metal pot that the dish is cooked and served in - another explanation is that the Birmingham restaurateurs just chucked all the ingredients in a bucket and served it up to the adoration of the locals.  Either way, Balti houses are a common feature in Birmingham, England and Baltis are now available on the menu in many commonwealth countries.  Typically a quickly cooked dish, rather than a slow cooked, rich curry that typifies dishes like [Rogan Josh](http://ekantcookcurry.com/rogan-josh/).\n\n[**Kedgeree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedgeree)\n\nThis is a weird smoked fish and curry powder infused rice dish - I'm only including this dish on here to explain that this isn't Indian...It's definitely British with Indian influences.  I can't stand it.  I was forced to eat this at boarding school in England in the 80s.  Just ignore it (ok, I'm being a bit overly harsh - I'm sure some people like it - but nah, not for me!)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere are many other great examples of Indian flavours being incorporated into other dishes around the world.  My favourite is the [Bunny Chow](http://www.indiandelights.co.za/bunny-chow-in-south-africa/) from Durban, South Africa where a loaf of bread is cut in half, hollowed out and filled with curry.  You eat the curry by dipping the bread into it as you go.  As far from authentic Indian dining experience as you can get, but bloody hell it's a wonderful way to eat!\n\nBut what am I trying to get at? I guess it's that Indians are less rigid with their cuisine as some countries are.  I remember watching Jamie Oliver get quite frustrated with an Italian family who refused to try any adaptation on their family's food.  My mum's food will always be the best, to me, but that's not to say I can't appreciate another twist on a dish to suit your palette or the availability of ingredients where you are.  Personally, I love that Indian cuisine is evolving, but we should never throw out the traditional in exchange for the new.  Keep both - it's ok! I'll admit I'll eat a good quality CTM when I go out, even if my granddad would never have touched the stuff (tasted too much like British oppression to him).\n\nHopefully this has given you a tiny insight into a couple of British Indian dishes - what others out there are your favourites?  \n\nEdit: Formatting :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/4jeb2m/cuisine_of_the_week_british_indian_food/", "created_utc": 1463279871.0, "score": 93, "author": "mamba_79", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/4jeb2m/cuisine_of_the_week_british_indian_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

You can also make Kokum kadhi instead of your plain old kadhi, it's called Solkadhi.  \n\nWell, there are like a hundred different sherbets, like Jamun and Karvand, which are less popular but equally good.  \n\n3.Khaas [Vetiver] - It smells as good as it looks. I absolutely love the green colour and herbal smell of this drink. It traditionally signals the start of summer.  \n\n4.Piyush - It's like Shrikhand which is drinkable, although not made from Shrikhand. Very Lassi-like but also a bit different. Kids back then used to joke that Shrikhand sellers would sell Piyush after washing their utensils lol. \n\n5.Buttermilk/Chaas/Taak - Whether sweet or salty, summer is incomplete without buttermilk. Also, this makes you really sleepy lol.   \n\n6.Ganne ka raas - Just plain old sugarcane juice and I'll have it no other way.  \n\n7.Jaljeera - Masala soda without the soda. Shikanji for the lemon+soda variant. \n\n8.Aamras - Pulpy sweet mango drink, an all-time favourite from this list. It just smells of summer.   \n\n9.Chinchvani - Sweet-sour Tamarind juice, idk if it's popular elsewhere. A bit like Imli chutney but drinkable.    \n\n10.Aambil - It is more like a soup than a drink but it always reminds me of the pooja at home.  \n\n11.Neera - It's a drink made out of palm extracts, people say that it is really healthy. Well, it tastes good and that is enough for me lol.  \n\n12.Coconut water - self-explanatory.  \n\nedit - forgot to add   \n\n13.Mastani - This is popular in Pune, is like a next-level version of a mango shake  \n\n14.Falooda - It is basically an entire party in a glass lol, difficult to describe.

We went to a Colombian restaurant that does only a prix fixe thing where they bring out items one after the other. I enjoyed the concept and told her that I felt I could do something like this.\n\nShe asked a few of her friends to show up for dinner along with their partners. Given the varied spice tolerances, I decided to go for almost no spice. But I wanted to deliver a culinary experience that was different from what they would have gotten at any random desi restaurant.\n\nMy set included:\n\n* sundal\n\n* papadam\n\n* sabudana khichidi\n\n* pan de bonos\n\n* poha tacos\n\n* dal bukhara\n\n* mushroom pulav\n\n* hawaii'an butter mochi cake\n\nSundal is a very traditional south indian dish usually prepared as an offering for the deities. It has the right amount of savory with lot of coconut to augment its flavors. \n\nPapadam was your generic Lijjat papad served with a tomato+onion+chilis+lemon juice+chaat masala.\n\nSabudana khichidi was also the generic version with no mods.\n\nPan de bonos are these cheesy squishy buns made with tapioca flour. I enjoyed them in Colombia and brought back a mix. It's pretty straightfoward - mix water, flour, and cheese. Make balls and bake.\n\nPoha tacos is an interesting dish. I made poha once and my partner asked me to add eggs to it. She then threw it into a corn tortilla with some salsa and ate it as a taco. Over time we perfected that and it's quite good. Magic ingredient being Maggi hot and sweet ketchup. \n\n[Recipe here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11m4pmg/poha_tacos/)\n\nDal bukhara is an easy enough dish to make, except it takes hours. I got try out making it in an Instant Pot and it came out really decadent. This was served with mushroom pulav.\n\nFinally, the mochi cake is something I have been making for a few years now. It's a straightforward recipe and is quite addicting.\n\n---\n\nOverall, the food was undersalted and barely spiced to my taste, but our guests didn't seem to mind. Many loved the poha tacos. A couple found the sabudana texture to be interesting. All loved the simplicity of the sundal. By the time I was serving the dal, I was tipsy! I enjoyed cooking and sipping on beer the entire time. People boxed and took home the dal. Can't blame them. There was a stick of butter and a box of cream in it!\n\nMy partner put together a little menu in Illustrator and air dropped it to the guests so that they had an idea what they were eating. Overall, we enjoyed the process. I was proud of my carefully calibrated spreadsheet telling me when I had to do what so that an item could come out at a specific time in the evening.\n\nI have mad respect for professional restauranters now! The amount of prep required to run an average Indian restaurant is insane!

Spicy, aromatic with spices, big, bright flavors and chunks of chicken.\n\nDabas, for the uninitiated, are roadside cafes all over the country and their food is second to none. Hell, the experience is unique and you have to have it. Driving along the highway, you can see small mud huts with supports (ropes and wooden beds) and wooden boards for tables. They are usually replaced by truck drivers and budget travelers looking for food that reminds them of home.\n\n **Ingredients for chicken curry**\n\nHere are the main ingredients needed for this recipe:\n\n**Chicken:** Bone-in chicken, cut into 2-inch pieces. Most Indian curries use the whole bird (thigh, breast, leg).\n\n**Ginger Garlic Paste**: Grind equal parts of fresh ginger and garlic with a little water. Use in the store, but it tastes better fresh\n\n**Lemon juice**: The acid helps tenderize the meat\n\n**Mustard oil:** the key to getting the unique taste of tapa. Add more spiciness and smoke\n\n**Whole spices:** cumin, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and bay leaves. If you don't have one, skip it, but I recommend using them for this flavor\n\n**Ginger and garlic:** grind with onions. 1.5 teaspoons can be replaced with store-bought or homemade ginger-garlic paste\n\n**Onions:** form the main base of the sauce and add flavor, thickness and thickness\n\n**Green Chili Peppers:** Add heat and flavor. If you don't have cayenne pepper, use serrano pepper instead\n\n**Ground spices:** red chili, turmeric powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Homemade garam masala is best, and should be added midway or at the end of the cooking process to preserve its flavor.\n\n**Tempering:** Uses ghee, ginger and green chillies and adds more flavor to the curry after it is cooked.\n\n \n\n**Instructions**\n\nMarinate the chicken pieces with ginger garlic paste, lime juice and salt. Cover and set aside while you prep everything else\n\nGrind onions, ginger, garlic and green chilies to a fine paste with very little water. Set aside.\n\nHeat oil in a pressure cooker or a large heavy bottom pan. Add cumin seeds. Roughly pound all the whole spices (bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, peppercorns and cloves) and add to the oil.\n\nOnce they start to splutter, add the onion paste. Cook the onion paste on a low flame, stirring occasionally, till it is reduced to a golden, brown paste and you see a thin layer of oil along the sides\n\nAdd tomatoes, salt, turmeric powder, red chili powder (if using) and coriander powder. Cook till the tomatoes start melting, and almost form a paste.\n\nAdd the chicken and garam masala and roast for a minute or two. Add 1 cup water.\n\n**Pressure Cooker:**\n\nAt this stage, if you are using a pressure cooker, place the lid and pressure cook on high till the first whistle goes off. Then reduce the flame to low and pressure cook for two more whistles and turn off the flame. If using a different kind of pressure cooker (without a whistle system), pressure cook on high for 15 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.\n\nSimmer for 5-10 mins on high flame, if required, to thicken the curry (chicken leaves a lot of water). I didn't need to do this.\n\n**Stovetop Method:**\n\nIf you are using a heavy bottomed pan, bring the curry to a boil, reduce the heat, cover with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for 20-25 minutes. Uncover the pan, and cook for another 10-15 minutes till the curry starts to thicken. Once the curry is ready, switch off the flame.\n\n**Instant Pot Method:**\n\nIf using an instant pot, place the lid and change the vent to sealing. Pressure cook on high for 8 minutes. Release pressure manually. Simmer the curry for a few minutes to achieve the desired thickness if there is too much water.\n\n**Tempering:**\n\nIn another small pan, heat ghee and butter and add green chilies and ginger. Once they start to splutter, switch off the flame and mix the tadka (or tempering) into the curry. Top with coriander.\n\nLet the curry sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. Tastes best with rotis or rice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/yrn9zw/dhaba_style_chicken_curry/", "created_utc": 1668104187.0, "score": 85, "author": "Beatone1", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/yrn9zw/dhaba_style_chicken_curry/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Baking soda also helps make chickpeas get softer.**\n\nStep 4) Let it depressurize naturally and open the lid.

The more you work on the dough, the better. Gluten is very important for this dough.\n\nStep 6) Apply some oil on the dough and let it rest for 5 minutes.\n\nStep 7) Now lightly knead the dough again and roll it into a cylindrical shape. Take a big portion out of it.\n\nStep 8) Now roll it between your palms and make a ball. Now flatten it and make a dent in the center.\n\nStep 9) Add a spoonful of potato filling and seal the edges. Flatten it again and make sure it's smooth.\n\nStep 10) Apply some oil on rolling pin and rolling board and place the bhatura on the board. \n\nStep 11) Spread it carefully using your fingers. Then using a rolling pin, gently roll it into oblong or round shape.\n\nStep 12) Now heat oil on high heat. We need super hot oil to fry these bhature.\n\nStep 13) Add the bhatura in oil carefully and keep touching it's upper surface with a spider strainer. This helps it get balloony.\n\nStep 14) Once light golden on both sides, take it out and let the excess oil drip off. Prepare all the bhatura like this.\n\n**Note: Once your bhatura is done, lower the flame. And when you're about to add another one, put the flame on high just before it.**\n\nServe the yummy stuffed bhature with Hot spicy Chole.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/jx39lg/perfect_chole_and_aloo_stuffed_bhature_by_yours/", "created_utc": 1605794770.0, "score": 90, "author": "VickyPedia", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/jx39lg/perfect_chole_and_aloo_stuffed_bhature_by_yours/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

A loaded tomato and potato mish-mash, topped with a dollop of butter and served with hot buttery buns. You\u2019re in for a treat for brunch! \n\nvideo recipe: [https://youtu.be/k-GLERmjtQU](https://youtu.be/k-GLERmjtQU)\n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n* 2 medium potatoes\n* 1/2 Cup green peas\n* 10 Tbsp butter\n* 1 tsp cumin seeds\n* 1 Tbsp garlic paste\n* 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped\n* 1/2 green pepper, finely chopped\n* 1 large tomato, finely chopped\n* 1 - 2 Tbsp deggi mirch\n* water as needed\n* salt to taste\n* Tbsp pav bhaji masala\n* cilantro for garnish\n* lemon wedge for garnish\n* Pav/Buns to preference\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS\n\n**To prepare the potatoes and peas**\n\n1. Boil the potatoes and peas in a pressure cooker. If using an Instant Pot, slice potatoes in half, insert a trivet to the pot and add the potatoes and peas directly on the trivet.\n2. Set the Instant Pot to Sealing mode and cook in Steam mode for 11-12 minutes. Let pressure release naturally.\n3. Peel the potatoes and transfer both potatoes and peas to a large bowl. Lightly mash the potatoes and peas and set aside for use later\n\n**To prepare the pav bhaji**\n\n1. Heat 2 Tbsp of butter in a pan and once molten, add cumin seeds and onions. Saut\u00e9 until onions become soft and turn a light golden brown.\n2. Add garlic paste and green pepper and saut\u00e9 until peppers have softened, and rawness of the garlic has cooked off.\n3. Add tomatoes, salt and half of the deggi mirch. Mix well and continue cooking until tomatoes cook down and become soft. Stir ever so often to ensure they don\u2019t stick to the pan and burn.\n4. Add the mashed potatoes and peas and mix well to combine. Then, make a well at the center of the pan and add 2-3 Tbsp of butter. Add the rest of the deggi mirch and mix in with the butter.\n5. Cook the spice until fragrant, about 30 seconds and then mix in with the bhaji.\n6. Add water, about 1/2 Cup at a time until you have a wet consistency. Mix well and then start mashing the bhaji with a potato masher until completely smooth.\n7. Turn heat to low and simmer, add more water if required to match the consistency of your liking. Taste and adjust for seasoning.\n8. Sprinkle with pav bhaji masala and mix well. Let bhaji simmer while you prepare the pav.\n9. Heat a tawa pan on medium low heat and add 1-2 Tbsp of butter and let it melt. Slice the pavs in half and add to the pan. Coat each side with butter, adding more as necessary to complete butter the pav. Toast lightly, until pavs are warmed through\n10. Serve Pav Bhaji immediately, topping the bhaji with more butter, chopped cilantro, along with the pav and wedges of lemon", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/lgg87k/homestyle_bombay_pav_bhaji/", "created_utc": 1612912596.0, "score": 86, "author": "cookingwithanadi", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/lgg87k/homestyle_bombay_pav_bhaji/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Week 22 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Jharkhand", "selftext": "Hello, I am back with week 22 - Jharkhand!\n\nJharkhand is an eastern Indian state known for its wildlife and waterfalls. Its cuisine is filled with vegetables, rice, and dal, and flavours are simple with little spice yet very flavourful. Although, there are certain dishes that are meaty and contain a lot of spice (not spicy) that you can find across Jharkhand. I do love unique dishes so I have picked a meat dish and a more famous rice/dal dish for this week.\n\nThe dishes I chose were mutton atthey and dhuska.\n\n* **Mutton atthey** is a mutton curry cooked in ghee. I came across a Deoghar-style mutton atthey (Deoghar is a famous religious city in Jharkhand), but I don't know whether mutton atthey itself is a Jharkhand dish. This dish is unique because you cook the mutton in ghee for a long time before adding water. I am used to cooking it the other way around, where you fry the meat in oil to sear it and then cook it in water for a long time. I have never made mutton (or any meat) like this before and I wanted to try it. Safe to say it was delicious. The meat was so tender and dripping with fat. It such a beautifully indulgent dish, I would make this for a party. I ate mine with rice. [This is what my mutton atthey looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/O2HpeOg.jpg)\n* **Dhuska** is made from a rice-dal batter than is deep fried and eaten usually for breakfast or as a snack. It's not bread because no wheat is used, but it is used like bread similar to poori. I still have trouble deep frying and the first few ones turned out poor because the oil was not hot enough. But the remaining ones turned out super soft with a slight crisp around the edge, super delicious. This was also my first time frying batter, so I am pleased with the outcome. I will be better when I do it again. I ate my dhuska with potato masala and chana dal. [This is what my dhuska looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/f3mHI0m.jpg)\n\nAnother great state to do, Jharkhand had lots of delicious dishes to choose from. Some dishes were not possible because I couldn't get the ingredients but I am glad I went with the dishes I choose.\n\nMy next week is Uttarakhand! As always, please do give me your dish suggestions :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to let everyone know, I will be away for a while but will be back in a few weeks to continue this project!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndex:\n\n* [Week 1 - Andhra Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/x041bx/week_1_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 2- West Bengal](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xbjsfy/week_2_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 3 - Puducherry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xnrn2d/week_3_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 4 - Manipur](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/xzpb41/week_4_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 5 - Chhattisgarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ybcxoa/week_5_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 6 - Gujarat](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/ynr0ob/week_6_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 7 - Delhi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zcbuws/week_7_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 8 - Nagaland](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zp7owv/week_8_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 9 - Goa](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/zzybii/week_9_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 10 - Telangana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/10cm8rn/week_10_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 11 - Punjab](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/110kmj8/week_11_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 12 - Jammu and Kashmir](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11cjv4k/week_12_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 13 - Haryana](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11pjgxo/week_13_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 14 - Bihar](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/122yblo/week_14_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 15 - Andaman and Nicobar Islands](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/12gc7hh/week_15_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 16 - Odisha](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/12w81fy/week_16_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 17 - Sikkim](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/13ns7fg/week_17_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 18 - Karnataka](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/140gvgg/week_18_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 19 -Himachal Pradesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/14cj9ru/week_19_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 20 - Lakshadweep](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/14v123o/week_20_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n* [Week 21 - Chandigarh](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/157hitv/week_21_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/)\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/15jzmbn/week_22_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "created_utc": 1691353476.0, "score": 89, "author": "MoTheBulba", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/15jzmbn/week_22_of_making_dishes_from_each_indian_state/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

My MIL has traumatized me her kitchen ways", "selftext": "Dear People,\n\nMy MIL has a habit of storing stale food in the fridge (not freezer) for months. She claims this is done only when travelling but it isn't true. Multiple times when I have sent curries over to her place in the past she tells me she consumed  them 3 weeks later. She has herself said that she has kept the following in the fridge during the mentioned duration below:\n\n1. Rasam - 2 months\n2. Idly 1 month . Her solution if they become hard - Put water on the idlis, microwave and they will be soft again.\n3. Dosa batter - 1 to 2 months. If the batter becomes sour, add sooji and continue use. Add sooji again if it turns sour.\n4. Non-vegetarian and Vegetarian curries -  she says maximum 3 months\n\n\nPLEASE COMMENT HOW MANY DAYS YOU KEEP THE ABOVE FOOD ITEMS and other south indian items like chutneys, wadas..... It would mean a lot to me!!!!\n\nThe rice she uses for the batter is infested with weevils and so is the flour. Chappatis and Pooris are made with this flour. (PLEASE COMMENT WHAT YOU DO WITH FLOUR AND RICE INFESTED WITH BUGS AND WEEVILS!!)\nEven though they aren't harmful to health, it shows how unhygienic the kitchen is. Her solution is to freeze the flour and then use a sieve to separate the weevils. They do come again because there are so many eggs in the flour and rice is not kept in proper storage containers.  She also has expired packets of poha, coffee powder and other dry ingredients that she continues to use even though the date has passed 2 years ago.\n\nShe tells me off for using frozen fish in my curries even though it is consumed within 2 days. My choice of using frozen fish is because of the poor quality and hygiene standards at our local wet market. However, she freely uses frozen chicken and prawns in her curries. I'm also working full time, and when I told her I meal prep curry base and keep it in the freezer for emergencies for a few days, she said that is unhealthy and I will cause cancer to her son.\n\nI now have a 7 month+ baby and she is starting solids. My MIL lives 5 minutes away and no option for us to move farther. My husband has been brought up like this and it is only now that he has become aware of how stale the food can really be at her place. When I speak with multiple people in front of him, he understands better. Now he is willing to speak to his mom, but I am hoping to gather more opinions so that I feel validated.\n\n\nBTW...My MIL has two refrigerators at home!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1hsc2vx/south_indian_members_please_reply_my_mil_has/", "created_utc": 1735872199.0, "score": 83, "author": "Radiant_Dot_9359", "num_comments": 118, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1hsc2vx/south_indian_members_please_reply_my_mil_has/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I usually buy Gopi brand paneer from Whole Foods because that's the easiest thing for me to get and it lasts a long time so I can buy a lot at once (I live far from Whole Foods).

I'll admit, it fell apart more than the store-bought paneer, but not too much. There were still all the original chunks of paneer, I think that tiny pieces of corners and ends just fell off. The difference in texture and flavor was worth it. Also, the price was totally worth it. I used a half-gallon of milk to make the recipe, which was much cheaper than the price of the paneer at Whole Foods. \n\nI used the paneer in a tikka masala and it fell apart a little bit so that little tiny curds mixed into the sauce, but it was delicious.

{"title": "5 things I learned from testing 100 Chicken Tikka marinades", "selftext": "Ok maybe not 100 but I did eat way too much chicken.  I wanted to test what ingredients and techniques made the best chicken tikka marinade and really dig into what a marinade is supposed to do.  TLDR; If you would rather watch the video than read this summary you can check it out [here](https://youtu.be/g-_6nDRsHGU)  First, let\u2019s do some background.  \n**What is a marinade?**    \nA marinade consists of flavor, acids, and fats.  Flavor flavors the food but some ingredients in chicken tikka, like ginger, do a little extra credit.  Acid adds a little flavor but more importantly breaks down the surface proteins of the chicken.  This tenderizes the surface of the chicken and creates more surface area for the flavor to penetrate.  Fat gathers up all the flavor and sticks it onto the surface of the meat.  It is important to note, MARINADES DO NOT PENETRATE PAST THE SURACE OF THE MEAT.  A marinades job is to take flavor and stick it to the outside of the meat.  The longer you marinate the more concentrated the flavor will be on the surface of the meat.  \n**What is a Chicken Tikka marinade?**  \nA Chicken Tikka marinade can be as simple as yogurt and spices but if you search around you will usually come across a two part marinade:  \nChicken pieces, salt, lemon, ginger, garlic  \nLet sit for 30-90 minutes and then drain  \nThen add the spice mix, yogurt, oil  \n**Things I learned:**  \n1. **Marinades only stick to the outside of the meat.**  I know I addressed it earlier but it\u2019s important to know.  Marinades do not penetrate past the first 3 or so mm of surface.  Acid breaks down the surface to create more surface area and fat takes all the flavor and sticks it onto the surface.    \n2. **Salting early is everything.**  Go get two slices of tomato.  Salt one.  Let them sit for 45 min.  Then salt the other one.  Taste them both.  It is wild what salt can do when it sits.  This is an example of it penetrating and flavoring over time but in chicken is also dissolves protein stands into a gel, which allows them to absorb and retain water better as they cook.   \n3. If I\u2019m marinating for over 5 hours, I\u2019m going to **skip the lemon in the first marinade**.  Both Ginger and yogurt denature surface proteins.  If I was going to marinade past 5 hours, I didn\u2019t need any additional acid in my marinade to do additional denaturing.  I did, however, like adding a little rice wine vinegar 30 minutes before grilling for flavor.  In my next video I go over basting and for me this is where acid shines but we will save that for the next post.     \nNote 1: Acid didn\u2019t not break down skin side pieces as much as cut pieces so If I was dealing with whole pieces of chicken an acid bath would make more sense.  Restaurants use a tandoori oven which has the ability to crisp up the soft surface of chicken whereas my grill or an oven does not.    \nNote 2: I recognize an acid bath is also meant for cleaning.  My chicken here in Mexico is pretty good a rests a few days before it gets to me so I didn\u2019t need that additional acid bath.  I would use it if I had a freshly killed chicken or a really smelly gamey one.  \n4. **If you are short on time forget using yogurt.**  Yogurt is a lactic acid which is much more gentle than citric(citrus) or acetic (vinegar) acids and needs at least 5 hours to start doing its thing.  If I only have 2 hours before grilling, I\u2019m going to use a citric or acetic acid early in the marinade and switch out the fat.  My two favorite substitutes were mayonnaise and cream.  \n5. This is a bonus tip that will be in the next video but it isn\u2019t going to drop for a while so I figured I would give it to you now.  **Wipe the marinade off of your chicken.**  I used a salad spinner to get most of it off and then dabbed it with a paper towel to get rid of all the surface moisture right before grilling.  This makes the best chicken tikka.  I\u2019ll explain why in the next post.  \nHope you learned something new.  Let me know if you disagree with anything I laid out or having anything to add. I\u2019m interested to hear your takes.

{"title": "Week 21 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Chandigarh", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have finished week 21 - Chandigarh!\n\nChandigarh is an Indian Union Territory, and the captial of both Punjab and Haryana. It has a unique history - it is a planned city post-independence with plenty of green and community spaces. It was envisioned as a symbol for India's freedom and its future as an independent nation.\n\nAs for its cuisine, it is largely the Punjabi cuisine. If you google Chandigarh food, the hits will mainly be around its Punjabi street food that look amazing. I haven't come across any Chandigarh-specifc dishes, but please do let me know if you have suggestions!\n\nThe food I chose were fish tikka and chole.\n\n* **Fish tikka** is dish made up of small pieces of fish (i.e. tikka) that have been marinated and grilled. I wanted to try this to compare it fish pakora. I wasn't sure if the taste would be that much different but I was so wrong. The flavour is more smokey and soft compared to the crispy, deep-fried pakoras. Very easy to make and quick too. There are lots of different recipes, but it usually includes yogurt, mustard oil, and a red masala blend. I added rice flour along with the gram flour, which added some crisp. [Here it what my fish tikka looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/DRL0xWd.jpg)\n* **Chole** is a type of chickpea curry. There are so many recipes for chole, but the one I used had tea, pomengranate, and amchur. Really unique flavours and the dish came out great. I think this is an Amritsari chole recipe, but I wouldn't be surprised as these ingredients are also used in other Amritsari dishes. Very easy to make and I had mine with chappati. If you have the opportunity, have the chole with bhatura - best combination. [This is what my chole looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/Gl6EXjt.jpg)\n\nBoth the dishes I picked were very quick and easy to make, all under 30 minutes. But they were still so flavourful and I am glad I made them. I've eaten so many Punjabi dishes before but making them myself really highlights what makes them so special.  :)\n\nMy next week is Jharkhand!

{"title": "Question About Proper Achar/Dahi Eating Methods", "selftext": "Howdy All. I am a Caucasian American who has been dating a desi who likes to cook a lot of Indian food and has turned me onto a bunch of great recipes from her childhood that are completely new to me.  \n\nWe recently had a pretty spirited debate around the proper way to eat one of her favorites dishes (khichdi) and I was hoping you could shed some light on how I seem to be terribly wrong in my take. \n\nI have been cooking khichdi as a healthy and convenient lunch during workdays. I cook a big batch every Sunday to cover me for the week and I'm using the ingredients and cooking methods that she recommended me that are based on her family's preferred recipe. No problems here. \n\nShe suggested that I add achar and dahi to my khichdi to liven things up a little bit, and I found both to be fantastic and I now always add them to my meals (they are added separately as \"condiments\" each time I have lunch and I did not add either to the base recipe, give me some credit here). This is where our argument started. \n\nAll of the recipe pictures and her pictures show the achar and dahi just resting on the side of the bowl and you are supposed to pick up a little bit of each in each bite. This is apparently how it is traditionally eaten. \n\nBeing an impatient American who was raised to expect instant gratification in all areas of life, I abandoned this \"side of the bowl\" approach after about 4 lunches and I instead just added my dahi dollop and achar into the khichdi and stirred it into the overall dish. I now exclusively eat this shameful stirred concoction and have permanently eschewed any \"side of the bowl\" scooping.  \n\nI see 2 big benefits of my approach:\n\n1. Easier to evenly ration out dahi and achar over the course of the meal. The \"side of bowl\" approach always left me running out of achar and/or dahi early into the dish, and it was difficult to get an \"even\" ratio from bite to bite. \n2. Much more convenient. I want dahi and achar in each bite and now I don't need to do any work to achieve that. I just scoop my spoon in and get what I need while I plod through another brainless Excel workbook.  \n\nAccording to her I am committing a grave Indian food faux pas though and no one is supposed to use achar and dahi like this. \n\nNow I'm very respective of the culture of others and I would never do this apparently deplorable eating method in front of her parents or any of her Indian friends for fear of terribly embarrassing her, but can any of you explain what the big problem is from a culinary perspective just to sate my curiosity? I thought it might have to be due to the cooling nature of dahi and achar (mixing it makes the entire dish relatively colder while resting the refrigerated condiments in an area unmixed makes the khichi warmer overall) but I don't see that as a tremendous problem and can't think of anything else besides tradition. Alternatively, is she just being unreasonable and perhaps jealous that I have in fact uncovered a massive breakthrough in efficient khichdi consumption (I'm guessing probably not)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/p9du3r/question_about_proper_achardahi_eating_methods/", "created_utc": 1629644064.0, "score": 82, "author": "Liebo", "num_comments": 54, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/p9du3r/question_about_proper_achardahi_eating_methods/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Add yeast and 1/4 Cup of lukewarm water to a bowl and whisk until water is bubbly. Mix until you see no granules of yeast floating on the water. If the yeast doesn't dissolve, the yeast is likely dead and you will have to start over with fresh yeast.\n2. Add flour to the bowl of your kitchen aid mixer and add all of the yeast-water mixture. Then, slowly add the rest of the lukewarm water while continuing to knead with the dough hook.\n3. Knead until the dough comes together and you have a soft, pliable dough which is not sticky to touch. Add more flour/water as required to reach this consistency.\n4. Stop the mixer and add the salt. knead on low speed for 1 minute.\n5. Then, transfer the dough to your countertop and continue kneading, stretch and fold the dough for 1-2 minutes. Or until, the dough is soft, and has no creases or lines.\n6. Form the dough into a ball and set aside on the countertop/bowl (lined with olive oil) and let rest for 40-45 minutes or until the dough is at least 1.5x times the size.\n7. Then, portion the dough into 2 equal parts and for each portion fold the dough onto itself to create a tight surface tension as you seal/pinch the folds. Be careful not to de-gas the dough too much. The portions should resemble a ball of fresh mozzarella. This is a great time to freeze any dough you are not planning to use right away.\n8. Let the dough portions rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.\n\n**For the paneer tikka**\n\n1. In a bowl add all the ingredients for the marinade except Paneer. Whisk well and taste to adjust for seasoning.\n2. Add the cubed paneer to the marinade and gently toss well to combine. Set aside to marinade while you prepare the sauce.\n\n**For the makhani sauce**\n\n1. In a bowl, combine all the ingredients for the no-cook makhani sauce and mix well. Adjust with salt for seasoning.\n\n**For the pizza**\n\n1. Heat a non-stick/cast iron/stainless steel pan on medium to medium high heat.\n2. In the meanwhile, dust your worktop with flour and take out one portion of the dough. De-gas as little as possible as you transfer it to your worktop.\n3. Starting from the center, start stretching the dough outwards and use a circular motion on both of your hands to stretch the dough to roughly fit the diameter of your pan. Make sure to leave a raised lip at the edge of the dough for the crust.\n4. Once hot, add a splash of olive oil and spread the oil around the pan. Carefully transfer the rolled out dough to the pan, you will have a few seconds to adjust any folds and move the dough to fit the diameter.\n5. Let the dough cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the center feels firm, and you are able to shake the pan to slide the pizza dough.\n6. Turn the heat down to medium low.\n7. Apply the sauce over the dough, followed by a layer of provolone, mozzarella and your marinated Paneer Tikka mix making sure to avoid dripping any excess marinade on the pizza.\n8. Once you have assembled the pizza, check the color of the crust underneath using a spatula.\n9. Once you see a light brown crust, turn the heat all the way to low and cover the pan with a lid. The dough at the edges and the toppings will finish cooking with the steam within the pan.\n10. Once the cheese is molten and the edges of the pizza feels firm, you are ready to serve.\n11. Optional: If you do have an oven, at this stage you can transfer the pizza to a baking sheet or if you have an oven safe pan, transfer the pan directly under the broiler and broil on high until the cheese has brown spots.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/si1lbb/paneer_tikka_pan_pizza/", "created_utc": 1643739446.0, "score": 83, "author": "cookingwithanadi", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/si1lbb/paneer_tikka_pan_pizza/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Stir continuously after adding water and ensure there are no lumps.*\n\n\u2022 Tawa recommendation for starters: get a non-stick dosa tawa (I have used [Hawkins Futura 33 cm Dosa Tava](https://amzn.eu/d/5nhgo15) as a beginner and it works well).\n\n*Note: Dosa tawas/pans are different than regular tawas - they are flat and have thick bottom.*\n\n\u2022 **Instead of pre-heating the tawa and sprinkling water (like a Pro chef) to cool the surface, use a COLD tawa instead** - you get ample time to spread the batter evenly this way and there would be no sticking or holes this way.\n\n\u2022 Pour the batter on **COLD** tawa (batter should be of thick flowy, not runny consistency) in the centre.\n\n\u2022 Swivel the tawa around to spread the batter. Be brave and let the batter flow upto the edges. (If you feel there is excess batter, drain the extra from one side by tilting the pan into the bowl.)\n\n\u2022 Once the batter has been spread evenly, wipe any excess batter that might have flown down the edge of tawa. Turn on the **flame to high \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25**.\n\n\u2022 Usually the residential gas burners are small compared to the size of tawa (33 cm tawa). Keep moving/rotating the pan every 1 min so that the dosa cooks evenly. No need to constantly (every 2-5 seconds) rotate the pan.\n\n\u2022 When you see bubbles forming and popping, ensure that you keep rotating the pan over the flame to ensure every part of batter cooks evenly. (You can move the pan to the extremes to ensure evenly cooking and so that the middle is not overdone). **Keep the flame on high \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 untill bubbles keep forming and the batter is liquidity.**\n\n\u2022 At this stage (bubbles stop forming, minor cracks appear), **turn the flame to medium - low \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25**, keep rotating the pan every now and then accordingly (this stage is to cook the batter on top). \n\n*Keeping high flame at this point will burn the underside and the batter will probably stick to the pan.*\n\n\u2022 When the **batter's surface (top) has dried up** (still white in colour), brush ghee, coconut oil along the outer edge (important). Alternatively can simply rub a brick/slab of butter on the entire dosa.\n\n\u2022 Ensure the centre is cooked evenly (if not, turn the flame to low \ud83d\udd25  and let the pan in the centre of the burner. Cook on low flame until the centre is evenly cooked.\n\n\u2022 **Turn the flame to low \ud83d\udd25**\n\n- at this stage, pour the filling in the center and spread it slightly for masala dosa. Do not exert too much pressure while spreading.  \n\n- also can spread green coriander chutney, mint chutney, Schezwan sauce directly on the batter for added flavour (spread evenly).\n\n- add cheese at this stage (if needed), turn the flame to low and cover the pan with a large plate so that the cheese could melt (another hack is to microwave the freshly prepared dosa for 15-30 seconds to melt the cheese). Processed cheese generally don't require all this hassle and melts during the process.\n\n\u2022 Turn the flame back to medium-low \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 once you're done with the filling/chutney/cheese.\n\n\u2022 At this point make sure the outer edges are completely cooked (keep moving the pan to do so). Once done simply seperate the dosa from the pan along the edges (run a spatula on the outer circumference of the pan). \n\n\u2022 Check the underside by slightly lifting the dosa from the edge and cook it as per preference. Keep the flame medium-low untill the very end.\n\n\u2022 Roll up/fold the dosa and  you are done. **Your Plain Dosa is ready.**\n\n\u2022 **Next - instead of sprinkling water, run tap water (slowly at first, gradually increase the flow) on the pan directly for 5-8 seconds (depends upon the rate of flow of water and temperature), wipe any water droplets and *quickly* repeat the process for your next dosa.** *DO NOT WASH THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PAN.*\n\nThe 1st dosa might not come out to be perfect. Adjust the consistency or the amount of battery accordingly for your 2nd dosa and onwards.\n\nAlso I'd not recommend to flip the batter at any stage. Flipping will harden both sides of batter (like a papad) and you'll no longer be able to roll/fold the dosa. \n\nCooking the dosa on low flame with oil/ghee/butter at the last stage will help you achieve the crispiness that everybody desires. High flame once the top layer dries up will simply burn the underside and result in uneven cooking.\n\n*Cooking dosas need patience, please take your time and enjoy the process.*\n\nThat's my technique and it is not the most polished and standard way of making dosa but it works and you can easily achieve perfection following the above process.\n\nFor recipe, I'd suggest: [Masala Dosa Recipe YFL - YouTube](https://youtu.be/PFG1aeYgi7c)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/11hresk/my_hack_to_make_prefect_dosas_at_home_for/", "created_utc": 1677909919.0, "score": 77, "author": "prakashanish", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/11hresk/my_hack_to_make_prefect_dosas_at_home_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I started cooking 3 years ago, and i learnt the most dishes from Internet.\n\nIn my home region, we consume a lot of Ghee and Mustard Oil. But in south, I don't see this trend. People here avoid Mustard Oil and use Ghee for special dishes. I was using Mustard oil for my personal cooking for three years. I was not cooking anything exceptional but the usual Dal-Chawal. Sometimes when i had to cook Paratha, i would regret using Mustard oil, because it have a strong taste. But then i started keeping a container where i would store the Mustard oil that i used for frying. Because after frying, the oil would lose it's strong flavour.\n\nBut recently, edible oil prices in india has gone up. They have almost doubled. Before i could buy Mustard oil for \u20b9130, and now i have to pay \u20b9220 for a liter. So i am thinking of switching to a comparatively cheaper Refined oil. But I don't know much about them. We, at home, rarely use refined oil because we believe that refined oil is not good for health. I was searching on the internet but i couldn't understand a thing.\n\nSo experts, please tell me, which oil is good for budget. I know the Olive Oil is best, and Ghee is another great option. But those are very costly. So is Mustard Oil really good for health than Refined oils (Soya, rice bran, palm, sunflower)? And in the variety of refined oil, which one is better and which should be absolutely avoided. And what things to look while buying cooking oil?

{"title": "Week 27 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Rajasthan", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have now done week 27 with Rajasthan!\n\nRajasthan is a north Indian state known for its royal history, beautiful architecture, and art. Its cuisine is mainly vegetarian, where many dishes are spicy and rich in flavour. Lentils, beans, legumes, and dairy are common ingredients. Rajasthan's cuisine was heavily influenced by its environment. The arid lands made it difficult to grow fresh food and water was scare compared to other parts of India. Food that could be stored for a long time, such as lentils, became popular. Similarly, dairy was a great way to retain water when cooking, where actual water could be better used elsewhere.\n\nThe dishes I choose for Rajasthan were gatte ki sabzi and mirchi vada.\n\n* **Gatte ki sabzi** is a dairy-based curry with pieces of dumplings made from gram flour. It has several steps but it is so simple to do, and very filling. I ate mine with rice. I added too much water initially when making the gram flour dumplings so I added more gram flour and ended up with much more gatte ki sabzi that I planned. Not a problem though, as the leftovers were still delicious the next day! There is another version of this dish, called shahi gatte, where the dumplings are stuffed with a nut filling. I want to make that too one day. [This is what my gatte ki sabzi looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/bZi46TL.jpg)\n* **Mirchi Vada** (or mirchi bada) is a deep-fried dish made from potato-stuffed chilli peppers and gram flour batter. I am very proud of doing this dish because it means that my deep frying skills are getting better! The only problem was that the pot I used was too small for the large chillies so the batter cooked unevenly, but oh well. They still turned out amazing, *and* the batter stuck to the chillies! It didn't fall off at all! Although this is a snack, I made so many that it ended up being my dinner. I ate it with a raita dip, but it is usually eaten with a red or green chutney. It is also not as spicy as you would think because you scrape out the insides of the chillies, which is what gives it its spiciness. [This is what my my mirchi vadas looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/nfYqXId.jpg)\n\nRajasthan was great to do, I have never before had dumplings made from gram flour. It means I have yet *another* way to use up my gram flour! I am also very pleased with the mirchi vada.

{"title": "Restaurant style dragon chicken", "selftext": " [Dragon chicken](https://youtu.be/HQp8vpFE5lQ)\n\nDragon chicken is a Indo-Chinese dish. I think they got the name because of the real dragon chicken whose foot are red and this dish is also rich red color.(today I didn\u2019t add any artificial food color for that red color).They go well as side dish for egg fried rice or chicken noodles.

The chicken can be marinated earlier and fried and saut\u00e9ed when guest over or party.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7  \n\n\nIngredients:\n\nMarination:\n\nChicken - 1/2 kg( 1.10 lb)\n\nEgg- 1\n\nBlack pepper- 1/2 tsp\n\nSalt- as per taste\n\nVinegar- 1 tsp\n\nDark soya sauce- 1 tsp\n\nMaida/all purpose flour- 3 tbsp\n\nCorn flour-3 tbsp\n\nDragon chicken preparation:\n\nOil- 2 tsp\n\nGinger- 2 tbsp(2\u201d peice)\n\nGarlic-2 tbsp(3 big cloves)\n\nRed chili- 5\n\nCashew-10\n\nCapsicum/bell peppers-1 cup sliced(different colors)\n\nOnion-1/2 sliced\n\nWhite pepper- 1 tsp\n\nSalt-as per taste\n\nVinegar- 1 tsp\n\nDark soya sauce- 1 tsp\n\nChili sauce- 1 tbsp\n\nWater- 1 tbsp & 1/2 cup\n\nCorn flour slurry- 2 tbsp water & 1 tsp corn flour/corn starch\n\nGreen onion\n\nRecipe :\n\n1. In a bowl,add thin striped chicken ( breast peice preferred), along to that add 1 egg ,followed by pepper and salt. Followed by vinegar and soya sauce. Mix all the wet ingredients with chicken and then add maida/all purpose flour and corn flour. No need to add any water. Just egg moisture is enough to coat the chicken. Cover and marinate the chicken for 30 minutes( vinegar helps the chicken to be tender ).\n\n2. After 30 minutes, using a fork ,drop the marinated chicken one by one into medium hot oil( very hot oil make chicken turn hard and rubbery inside).cook for 5-6 minutes in medium flame till the outer layer is crispy and inside should be juicy.\n\n3. For dragon chicken preparation, in a skillet add oil and add chopped garlic,ginger, red chili and cashew . Saut\u00e9 for few minutes and add capsicum/bell pepper and sliced onion. Cook till the capsicum is half cooked.(half cooked capsicum/bell peppers give nice crunch to the dish).\n\n4. Once the capsicum/bell pepper cooked, add white pepper(add black pepper if not available), salt,vinegar,soya sauce and chili sauce. Sprinkle some 1 tbsp water and mix the sauce with vegetables.Finally add fried chicken,1/2 cup water and saut\u00e9 for just 2 minute in high flame to coat the sauce on chicken and chicken shouldn\u2019t \u00a0lose its crunchiness.

{"title": "Week 36 of Making Dishes from Each Indian State and Territory - Arunachal Pradesh", "selftext": "Hello all, welcome to my FINAL WEEK - Arunachal Pradesh!\n\nArunachal Pradesh is a northeastern Indian state and is famed for its untouched natural beauty. The state's name means \"the land of dawn-lit mountains\", referring to the suns rays on the Himalyan mountains and valleys.\n\nArunachalese cuisine consists of localally available meat, fish, and vegetables, with rice being its staple food. Arunachalese rice is a local variety too, called khamti rice, and is a type of sticky rice often cooked in bamboo. Many local herbs and seasonings are used in recipes, where these ingredients are commonly blended into a paste or dry mix before being cooked. Traditional food preferences and cooking methods differ between the various tribes within Arunachal Pradesh, but they generally tend to be mild with minimal spices used. However, when spices *are* used, the dishes are incredibly spicey as bhut jolokia, i.e. ghost chillies or the king chilli, are cultivated here.\n\nThe dishes I chose for Arunachal Pradesh were Arunachali steamed fish and lukter.\n\n* **Arunachali steamed fish** is a common dish where fresh, local fish is marinated in a herby paste and steamed in banana leaves. There are many variations for this dish but generally includes garlic, ginger, hooker chives, and bamboo shoots. The fish tends to be fresh water fish that is either cooked whole (once cleaned and gutted) or cut into steaks. I love recipes that use banana leaves, it gives such a lovely sweet-savoury flavour and the smell is incredible. So this was a very delicious dish for me, also very easy and quick to make. I ate my fish with rice and vegetable pickle. [This is what my Arunachali steamed fish looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/vUPu6ST.jpg)\n* **Lukter** is a crispy, spicy meat dish that uses bhut jolokia and dried bamboo shoots. Any meat can be used, such as pork or chicken, which is boiled and shredded before being fried. As this dish uses bhut jolokia, I made sure to wear gloves when handling the chillies and opened every door and window in the house before I fried the chillies. I still ended up coughing a lot but not as bad I expected. The recipes I've seen uses a lot of chillies and I don't have a high spice tolerance, so I only used 3 bhut jolokia. By itself, my lukter (which was chicken) was very spicy, but eating it along with other food as a meal calmed the spice down. I ate mine with rice, yogurt, and pickle, and it was a very satisfying meal. [This is what my lukter looked like.](https://i.imgur.com/ljdKn4h.jpg)\n\nArunachal Pradesh was another great state to learn about. As with all the Seven Sisters, this state taught me another cooking method; I have never cooked meat like I did with the lukter and it was so tasty!\n\nI cannot believe I have finally done ALL 36 states and union territories! I started this in 2022 and I have finally finished! My gosh, it was a great project and I've become a better homecook because of it. I loved learning about all the different Indian cuisines and I definitely want to continue this learning.

Cinnamon (Dal Cheeni) - 1 inch. \nGreen Cardamoms (Hari Elaichi) - 2-3 crushed. \nBlack Cardamom (Kali Elaichi) - 1 crushed. \nBay leaf (Tez Patta) - 1. \n\nGround Spices: Dry Mango Powder (Aamchoor) - 1/2 Tablespoon. \nCoriander Powder (Dhaniya) - 1 Tablespoon. Turmeric powder (Haldi) - 1/2 teaspoon. \nKashmiri Red Chilli Powder or Paprika - 1 Tablespoon. \nGaram Masala Powder - 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon depending on masala. \nDried Fenugreek Leaves (Kasuri Methi) - 1 teaspoon (crushed) \n\nFor Gravy: Mustard Oil (Sarso ka tel) - 1 Tablespoon. Ginger juliennes (Adrak ke Lachhe)- 7-8. \nGreen Chillies (Hari mirch) - 2 finely chopped. Finely chopped onions - 1 cup (250 ml capacity). Ginger-Garlic Paste (Adrak-Lehsun) - 1 Tablespoon. Green chillies - 2-3 Slit. \nFresh Tomato Puree - 1/2 cup (125 ml capacity). Salt to taste. \n\nFor toppings: Vegetable Oil - 1/2 Tablespoon. \nPaneer (Cottage Cheese) - 200 gms. \nGreen Capsicums - 1/2 cup (Optional).\nOnions cut in petals - 1/2 cup. \n\n\nProcess: \n\n\nStep 1: Heat up a kadhai and add 1 tablespoon of mustard oil on medium flame.\n\nStep 2: Add 1 teaspoon of Jeera and let it splutter.\n\nStep 3: Add all the whole spices and give them a light mix.\n\nStep 4: Add 7-8 ginger juliennes and 2 finely chopped green chillies. \n\n\n(Tip: In any Onion-Tomato based gravy, ginger-green chillies do wonders.)\n\n\nStep 5: To this add 1 cup of chopped onions and cook them on low-medium flame for 5 minutes or until they turn golden brown and start shrinking.\n\n(Tip: Stirring onions on low flame caramalizes the sugar present in onions which gives it a really great taste.) \n\nStep 6: Add ginger-garlic paste and slit green chillies and cook until the raw aroma goes away completely.\n\n(Tip: This dish does not require hot variety of red chilli powder. All the hotness will come from green chillies only.)\n\nStep 7: Add half a cup of fresh tomato puree. You can use canned tomato puree as well but I prefer fresh paste in this recipe.\n\nStep 8; Add salt according to your taste and give it a good mix.\n\nStep 9: Keep stirring on medium flame until the paste darkens.\n\nStep 10: Lower the flame and add our ground spices and quickly mix it.\n\n\n(You can add garam masala powder here but adding it in the last just before finishing the dish makes the final taste super flavorful and aromatic.)\n\nStep 11: Roast for the 30 seconds and add a dash of water to this mixture and let it simmer for 1 minute.\n\n(Tip: Adding water after roasting spices prevents them from sticking to the bottom and it also stops further cooking, thus retaining the beautiful red color of the kashmiri chilli powder.\n\nStep 12: Now to get the gravy texture and combine everything together, add 1/3 cup of water and cover the kadhayi with a lid and cook for 5 minutes on low flame.\n\nStep 13: After five minutes, the oil will be completely seperated from the pasteand the color will be turned out nicely.\n\nStep 14: Add Paneer cubes to this and gently mix it.\n\n(Tip: If your paneer is very soft, you can lightly stir fry it and add it in the last with the rest of toppings.)\n\nStep 15: Add half cup of water for final consistency adjustment. Cover it with a lid and let it cook on a low flame for 10 minutes.\nStep 16: Now, in a seperate pan, add half tablespoon of cooking oil on high flame.\nStep 17: Add diced green capsicum to the pan. Please be careful as the moisture present in the veggies makes the oil splutter when stir frying.\n\n(Tip: Adding capsicum is totally optional but it elevates the taste to the next level and the green in the gravy make it look super savory.)\n\nStep 18: Now, turn the flame to medium and onion petals and stir fry until they turn translucent.\n\nStep 19: Add the stir fried vegetables to the gravy. You will notice the nice red oil on top of the gravy. That's a sign of well cooked gravy.\n\nStep 20: Turn off the flame and add crushed Kasoori Methi and garam masala and give it a final mix.\n\nGarnish with grated paneer and your tasty Paneer Do Pyaza is ready.

{"title": "Beyond the restaurant 'saag', welcome to the world of bengali shaak recipes.", "selftext": "**The restaurant Saag**\n\nTo begin, I have no complaints against the restaurant 'saag' we get in USA. It's a greenish paste of majorly spinach, sometimes with addition of methi or mustard leaves, cooked down to pulp in a lot of oil, onion-garlic-ginger and other spices. This base is used in many different combinations sometimes with meat, sometimes paneer or other veggies. However the way restaurants abroad make it, the flavour of the leaves are lost and one dish is indistinguishable from the other. Aagin, no complaints really, the restaurants are trying to establish a standard recipe that appeals to the local palate, managing with chefs who keep changing and often managing with non-Indian chefs.\n\n**What is saag ?**\n\nAny leafy green.\n\nThe 'restaurant saag' is restaurant version of some punjabi recipes. India has many different regions and we eat hundereds of different varieties of leafy greens. Allow me to introduce you some popular saag/shaak/Xaak recipes from bengali cuisine. It's the cuisine I grew up with and also shaak cooked the bengali way is pretty light on spices, so you can appreciate the flavour of the main ingredient.\n\nCollecting, preparing and cooking shaak used to be a labour intensive process. Different indigenous shaaks weren't commercially grown, but were foraged by children and women of the household or plucked from their courtyard gardens. Some of these greens were biproduct of another vegetable - like gourds, pumpkins, parwals, drumsticks etc. Indian households usually ensured that nothing is discarded.\n\n**Some shaak recipes**\n\nI am mentioning here only a few shaaks which you will get in most South Asin and Asian groceries across US.\n\n1. Puishaak Mishtikumro (Poi saag cooked with pumpkin)\n\nGet some poi leaves (another saag) from any asian/ south asian grocery store. Cut into large pieces, discard stalks that maybe too hard. Wash thoroughly.\n\nTemper mustard oil with paanch phoron and green chilies. Then add some cubed pumpkins and potatoes with turmeric and a tiny hint of coriander powder.\n\nWhen the potato and pumpkin is halfway done, add the shaak. Add water as required to soften the veggies.\n\nCook till everything is soft. Sugar- optional.\n\n2) Laal Shaak (red amaranth)\n\nCut the shaak finely, wash thotoughly. Cut eggplant and potaotes (optional) into small cubes.\n\nTemper mustard oil with kalojira and chillies. Add peanuts and lightly fry them. Add your veggies and shaak. Keep cooking and add splashes of water, cover intermittently till it's 80% done. Add some poppy seeds at this point. Cook till everything is soft.\n\n3) Kolmi Shaak (ong choy , alternative - watercress) - stir fry with splashes of water with mustard oil and kalonji -garlic tadka.\n\n4) Paat shaak (Jute leaves) - Just like kolmi. You don't have to cut this shaak into small pieces though. You can also make fritters. Basically any shaak can be made this way.\n\n5) This is a highly non standard recipe, just our family recipe probably but I have seen a few versions of it made in some bengali and Assamese families - Anyway try to get hold of whole spinach plants, wash thoroughly and roughly chop. Discard the tougher stems. boil with minimum water, few green chillies with salt and once the leaves are soft, that it ! Add a few drops of mustard oil or butter. Serve with hot rice and a piece of fried fish.\n\n\\---\n\n**The traditional shaak culture**\n\nI can't recall if other leaves would be available abroad, so this is the end of my list of recipes. The story of shaak however doesn't end here. We had a gadal tree in our backyard yielding the gadal leaf - which is an acquired taste and someone may point out it has a stench. The leaf is know for medicinal benefits speically in stomach ailments and were added in everything when kids fell ill.\n\nMy uncles often brought kochu leaves and stems ( is taro the right translation ?) when they visited home. You can say it was a gift :) It was a delicacy prepared with fish heads.\n\nThankuni leaves were collected by our maid on the way to work, another taste that's hard to recreate. During my yearly visit to mother's place in north bengal we saw our grandmother collecting dheki shaak ( a kind of fern) for making shaak for lunch. Shaak was mostly a lunch speical item, not recommended for dinner because it used to be difficult to clean shaak at night and it wasn't recommended for digestion.\n\nAnd finally foraged shaak used to be a staple for the rural poor. Shaak-bhaat was the easy go to meal for folks who couldn't afford fish every meal or if the weather was adverse and there was no time to go and buy fish. Shaak was easy to collect.\n\nThat's all folks, I tried to share some recipes and ended up writing an essay but shaak for us is an emotion I thought it was worth sharing and this perspective is lost in most of the 'saag' discussions I see online.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/14j2dms/beyond_the_restaurant_saag_welcome_to_the_world/", "created_utc": 1687739919.0, "score": 75, "author": "None", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/14j2dms/beyond_the_restaurant_saag_welcome_to_the_world/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I love to order gobi manchurian whenever I visit any restaurants. Sometimes, I feel bored to see same gobi 65,gobi chili, gobi manchurian in any parties. When I was searching for something new, I came across this recipe and it was my new appetizer which I make often in any parties or get together in home. Kids love it( thinking it as chicken nuggets,but it won\u2019t disappoint them when they try).  To make it more flavorful, I make a special powder to sprinkle on top while serving.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Yw2HN6i0nRc\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nCauliflower - 2 cup\n\nGarlic powder - 1/2 tsp\n\nOnion powder - 1/2 tsp\n\nPepper powder - 1 tsp\n\nSalt - as per taste (1 tsp)\n\nAll purpose flour/ maida - 3 tbsp\n\nCorn flour - 3 tbsp\n\nBatter:\n\nAll purpose flour- 4 tbsp\n\nCorn flour - 4 tbsp\n\nSalt - 1 tsp\n\nSoya sauce - 1 tsp\n\nWater       -   1/2-3/4 cup water\n\nBread crumbs - 1 cup\n\nPowder:\n\nOnion powder                 -  1/2 tsp\n\nGarlic powder                 -   1/2 cup\n\nBlack pepper powder     -    1 tsp\n\nSalt                                 -     1/2 tsp\n\nPowdered sugar              -  1 tsp\n\nChaat masala                 -  1 tsp\n\nRed chili powder           -   1 tsp\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipe:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3  Blanch the cauliflower florets in hot water till they are cooked 3/4. ( this makes the insect get killed in hot water and also removes the raw smell in cauliflower)\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 In a bowl, add the blanched cauliflower, garlic powder, onion powder( use 1 tsp ginger garlic paste instead), black pepper powder,salt, all purpose flour and corn flour. Mix well,so the flavor is mixed on top and inside the cauliflower. ( this is done to infuse flavor inside cauliflower)\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Remove the coated cauliflower aside and in same bowl, add all purpose flour , corn flour, salt and soya sauce ( I used dark soya sauce to get that dark color). Add 1/2 to 3/4 cup water and mix the batter to medium thin batter( The batter should be thick enough to coat the cauliflower and helps bread crumbs stick to it).\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Take marinated cauliflower in a bowl, batter in another bowl and bread crumbs in another bowl( you can use crushed sweetness corn flakes along with bread crumbs or as it instead of bread crumbs). Take one piece cauliflower and dip in batter and coat the cauliflower with bread crumbs.( I used seasoned bread crumb with panko bread crumbs for flavorful textured coating, you add garlic powder and onion powder,if seasoned bread crumbs not available).

With a circle shape cutter, cut out small circles.\n\n4. Fry the papdis in hot oil for 5 to 6 minutes until both sides are golden and crispy.\n\n5. We can also bake them at 180\u00b0 for 15 to 20 minutes. \n\nHow to make papdi chaat::\n\n10 to 15 papdis (we can get papdis at Indian store rather than making at home)\n\n1/2 potato boiled and crumbled \n\n3 tbsp white chickpeas (chana)\n\n1/2 finely chopped onion \n\n1/2 finely chopped tomato \n\n2 tbsp bhujia sev(gram flour indian snacks normally used in chaats and can be eaten as snacks)\n\nCilantro or coriander leaves \n\n1 tbsp green chutney (made by making a paste with cilantro, green chillies,\u00a0 salt , ginger, cumin powder, chaat masala and water)\n\n1 tbsp tamarind chutney (made by making a paste with tamarind, jaggery and little bit red chilly powder)\n\nPreparation::\n\n1.

{"title": "Konkani Food: A short epicurean tour of the west coast of India", "selftext": "[What is Konkan?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konkan)  \n\nKonkan (kon-kun), or Kokan (ko-kun) depending on dialect, is a wet and verdant stretch of the western coast. It\u2019s worth noting that this is not an official state not managed in any form as a collective region. The grouping is equivalent to the term \u201cMediterranean\u201d in that it is a geographical region consisting of a variety of political borders. And similar to its more popular European non-cousin it has sub-regions with their own language and food and yet there\u2019s a consistent cultural and lifestyle theme that binds it to a stereotype.\n  \n\nBefore diving into the food, it\u2019s worth considering the terra of this picturesque region. To the west is the Arabian sea, an extension of the Indian ocean rising up the Indian peninsula.  Along the coast lie the Sahyadris or the [Western Ghats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats). Weather experts will recognize that after Kerala, Konkan is where the [monsoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon_of_South_Asia) lands in India. This results in giving the region a tropical climate.\n\nThe soil in most of northern Konkan is [alluvial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluvium) and [loamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loam) and rich in minerals such as iron ore. This is extremely fertile soil that is conducive to farming a variety of crops. Given the rain and the prevalence of good freshwater from a [network of rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_of_India#Rivers_flowing_into_Arabian_Sea), the predominant crop here is rice.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that [Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa) was a Portuguese colony till 1961 when it was annexed by India. As a result there\u2019s a strong latin / Portuguese influence to the local culture and enriches it further to create a wonderful layer to the culinary fabric. Goa & Malvan have also long been ports of international trade. \nGiven the nebulous definitions and outlines of what lies in Konkan and what does not, one could always argue about its identity. However, for the most part the following can be considered valid sub-regions that possess their own identity. Keep in mind there\u2019s a colloquialism that the language changes every 10 miles. For the purpose of identifying distinct cuisine I\u2019d outline the sub-regions as follows in north to south order:  \n1.\t[Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai)  \n2.\t[Ratnagiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratnagiri_district)  \n3.\t[Malvan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvan)  \n4.\t[Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa)  \n5.\t[Karwar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karwar,_Karnataka)   \n6.\t[Udupi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udupi)   \n7.\t[Mangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangalore)   \n\n  \n\n*****And now to the crux. Food.*****\n\nCause: Sea, mountains, lots of rain, fresh water river network, hot weather, Portuguese influence, trade ports, and alluvial soil. \nEffect: Lots of fresh seafood, some unique spices, rice, tons of coconuts and a laidback culture\n\nMore about the cuisines \u2013 please keep in mind I\u2019m intimately familiar with Malvani, Goan & Karwari cuisine. I\u2019m familiar with rest but I\u2019m sure there are masters of any / all of the above who will know much better than me. While separate threads will be useful for each of the above regions, I'll try to summarize and exemplify the unique flavors\n\n1. Goa (my ancestral home) - The fertile red soil of Goa, on every visit, reminds me of how the land is a gift to the locals. The hot and humid tropical climate is at worst a nuisance for an otherwise beautiful state. With beautiful beaches, estuaries, rivers and lots of rainfall the staples of this region are fish (fried, curried, stewed.....think Bubba talking shrimp) and rice. But there's enormous complexity and a variety of flavors to it. A couple of things make it unique.  \n           - Firstly, the native Konkani hindu was enriched when Goa became a Portuguese colony. They brought with them Pao (milk bread), vinegar, european desserts, port wine and pork along with the music and the laid back culture.  \n           - Second, as a part of the portuguese trade route with China, Macau, and Brazil, some of the food from other cultures came over. My personally held belief is that [tirphal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_pepper) is a localized variation of the sichuan pepper that was brought over by the Portuguese via Macau. It is hardly known, let alone used outside of the Goan / Karwari cuisine. I may be wrong of course and that wouldn't be a first for an OP on reddit.   \nAnother distinct feature of Goan cuisine are the distinct [Hindu and Catholic dishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goan_cuisine).  Food from both menus are appreciated on either side and religious differences are of no consequence in Goa.  \nThe hindu dishes are mostly vegeratian or fish based with a lot of coconut. They tend to use tamarind to add a sweet and sour flavor and this is where you'll find the use of tirphal (mentioned above). Some of the more popular dishes are fish curry ([this is a good page for listing of the variety of fishes](http://goodgoanfood.blogspot.com/2011/11/local-konkani-names-for-common-fish-in.html)) , beans, dals and the amazing [sol kadhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solkadhi). Its worth noting that the curry base gets modified according to the fish. Goan grandmas are like computers who can figure out a million variations based on the fish and other available ingredients. Its worth noting that the primary oil is Coconut oil (coconut trees above deep inland too) and grated / dried and dessicated coconut are used in practically everything including dals to impart a flavor unique to the konkan region. The local fish fry techniques are also somewhat unique - either coating the fish with a mixture of rice flower and semolina or with a masala (spice) paste. The latter is similar in technique to other regions of India but the flavors are unique. If you've never had semolina coated fried prawns and surmai (king fish) with a cold, cold lager. you haven't lived.  \nThe catholic dishes are mostly non-vegetarian and chicken or pork based. While Christianity existed in other parts of India the Goan catholics are heavily Portuguese by origin (whether from Portugal or converted by missionaries). While there are many overlapping flavors with the hindu cuisine, some things are very much unique to the Goan catholics such as Cafreal, Vindaloo, [Sorpotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarapatel) (pork), and [Bibenca](http://www.goanfoodrecipes.com/2008/06/bibinca-goas-favorite-dessert.html). The use of vinegar, within India, is almost unique to this community. Combine Vinegar with the local spices and you'll end up with flavors the natives of either countries couldn't have dreamed up.  \n ** It is worth remembering that the chillies (peppers) used in Indian cuisine do 2 things - add heat and add color. The chillies used in most fish curries are for color. e.g. [Byadgi chilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byadagi_chilli)\n\n2. Karwari Cuisine: Similar to Goan cuisine sans the Portuguese influence. Karwari people pride themselves on their curries and rice + coconut fish curry are must haves in every meal. Everything else is an accoutrements. My relatives still make their oil from their own coconut plantations to ensure authentic flavors.   \n3. Malvani Cuisine: Malvan is a region just north of Goa in the Sindhudurg district in the state of Maharashtra. There is a strong resemblance between the food from here and ethiopian cuisine. Eastern Africa had strong trade ties with this region and the ethiopian bread and spices strongly resemble the food from here. *All of this is anecdotal of course and OP should not be hanged.*  This cuisine is, as expected, somewhat similar to Goan cuisine but the use of coconut is not nearly as heavy nor as everpresent. In addition, you will find strong influences from other regions of Maharashtra. The latter are exemplified by dishes such as \"kombdi vade\" i.e. chicken served with a rice flour based fried bread, and \"phansachi bhaji\" - a vegetarian jackfruit dish. You're also more likely to find non-coconut based curries in Malvani cuisine which is anathema to Goans and Karwaris.\n\n\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/4j3dce/konkani_food_a_short_epicurean_tour_of_the_west/", "created_utc": 1463093687.0, "score": 75, "author": "Goan_Curry", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/4j3dce/konkani_food_a_short_epicurean_tour_of_the_west/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Soak this rice in water for half an hour.\n\n4 tbsp oil/ghee\n\n2 large onions ~500g - sliced\n\n8 pods of cardamom\n\n8 pieces of clove\n\n4 sticks of cinnamon\n\n**Could be useful:**\n\nAjinamoto/MSG\n\n2 limes\n\n1 bouillion cube\n\n---\n\n**Method:**\n\n**Masala and meat:**\n\n1. Chop up all the masala ingredients into blender-manageable pieces, and add them a little by little to your blender/grinder. You should end up with a smooth paste. You can add a tiny amount of water while grinding the masala if the mix is being uncooperative with your blender/grinder.\n1. Heat the 2 tbsp oil/ghee over a medium flame and fry the masala till it doesn't smell as raw.\n1. Add the meat and fry it in the masala for a minute. Then add some water (about 3-4 cups) and salt. Continue to cook the meat till it is cooked through. \n1. Once the meat is cooked, you need to separate the meat and the masala water. Remove the meat from the masala water and keep aside.\n1. Measure out the remaining masala water. You need to have twice the number of cups of water as you do rice. **2:1 ratio of masala water to rice.** This is why we measure out the kilo of rice in a cup. If you don't have enough water *see Note 1*.\n1. Make sure your masala water and meat is seasoned properly - saltiness and sourness. You can add a little lime juice if it's not sour enough, some bouillion if it's not salty enough.\n\n**Rice:**\n\n1. In a large enough vessel for your meat and cooked rice, heat 4 tbsp of oil/ghee.\n1. Fry the onions till they start to turn golden brown. Remove the onions and set aside.\n1. To the same vessel add the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon sticks. Fry for about 30 seconds and then add the rice.\n1. Fry the rice for a while and then add the cooked meat. Fry some more.\n1. Add the masala water and bring to a boil. Once the water is bubbling through, bring it down to a simmer.\n1. Check the rice frequently and stir the bottom to prevent the rice on the bottom from getting burnt. \n1. When the rice is about half done, add the onions you fried earlier and stir through.\n1. Once the rice is cooked through(about 15 minutes total), spread the biryani out in a wide dish and allow to rest for 10 minutes.\n\n**Garnish**\n\nThis is not a must, but this biryani goes great with some sliced scallions/onions fried till they are carmelised and crispy, and used as a garnish.\n\n**Add-ons**\n\nI also love adding some hard/medium-boiled eggs. Slice in half and layer over your biryani before serving.\n\n---\n\n**Note 1:** If you don't have enough masala water (that is, double the number of cups of rice), you can make a water mixture adding 1 tsp ajinomoto, the juice of two limes, and 1 bouillion cube. Bring to a boil and add to your masala water to make up the difference. Check the water for salt/sourness and adjust if necessary.\n\n**Note 2:** You can also finish this dish in the oven once you've added the masala water to the rice and brought it to a boil. I've never done this and I'm not sure what temperature rice should cook in the oven or for how long. If you do decide to do this, add the onions to the vessel before you put it in the oven.\n\n**Note 3:** I found a faster pressure cooker method of making this dish, although some of the ingredients and the order varies from mum's recipe.

{"title": "Making British Restaurant-style base gravy and applying it to butter chicken (Detailed)", "selftext": "(This is my first real content post here, so my apologies in advance if I made a mistake). The recipes that I used can be found after the introduction. I put together a [photo album](http://imgur.com/a/kGM6M) detailing this adventure. TL;DR: Tasty butter chicken within, and the potential unlocked for many more dishes!\n\nLast week, u/NotTheSheikOfAraby responded to [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/6akzpp/my_palak_paneer_is_bland_as_heck/) and introduced me to the concept of a \"base gravy\" (which is, as I lated discovered, discussed in this subreddit's FAQ). Afterwards, they kindly took the time to answer a [few questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/6akzpp/my_palak_paneer_is_bland_as_heck/dhhoaky/) that I had, pointing me to a YouTube channel by user [h4ppyleader](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rT1AQMqTGiOO8uEf8foSA) and, notably, his [base curry gravy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A91qv2O5eQw) video.\n\nThe videos were wonderfully educational, but I found them a tad difficult to apply, as the components were scattered across several videos and composed entirely of verbal ingredient lists and directions. After several hours of parsing (and watching dozens of his other videos - seriously, they're great), I compiled the instructions together and would like to repay u/NotTheSheikOfAraby's kindness by sharing this compilation.\n\nAfter making the base gravy recipe (as best as I could), I applied it to **h4ppyleader**'s [butter chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZQBhJ7v5uE) recipe. It did not disappoint - the result had all of the richness, depth, and vibrancy that I've come to recognize from restaurant dishes.\n\nNote that this makes about **2.5 gallons of base gravy**. This is a lot. I'm not sure how well the recipe scales down, though. It also took a full day to complete (about 2 hours of active time). I'd suggest making the whole batch and freezing most of it. Compiled instructions follow.\n\n(Gravy Prep): Kashmiri Masala Paste\n===================================\nThis is a write-up of the instructions outlined in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3d21zsmM8E). It's recommended to watch the video before cooking, as it includes a lot of technical and visual information, and the author is very knowledgeable.\n\n**NOTE**: This recipe produces **twice** the amount listed in the video, as this visually seemed to match the amount that he later used in his base gravy recipe. It also deviates a little from the verbal ingredients where I thought I observed a discrepancy.\n\nThis recipe occurs in three stages: first dry cook a whole spice blend, then mix it with additional powdered spices, and finally cook into a paste.\n\n## Dry Cook\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 10 Kashmiri chiles, torn up\n* 8 bay leaves, torn up\n* 2 tblsp coriander seeds, whole\n* 2 tblsp cumin seeds, whole\n* 2 tsp black mustard seeds\n* 1tsp onion seeds\n  * Note: I couldn't find these anywhere, and the recipe has tons of onions, so I omitted.\n* 6 cloves\n* Seeds from 6 cardamom pods\n  * Note: video says \"1\", (times two), but looked like more. Matched quantity.)\n\n### Method\n1. Add everything to a non-stick skillet over high heat, stirring constantly to prevent burning, for 3-5 minutes until fragrant.\n1. Pour onto plate and spread out to cool.\n1. Once cooled, add to spice grinder and grind thoroughly to a powder.\n\n## Powders\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 2 tblsp garlic powder\n* 1/2 tsp nutmeg\n* 2 tsp dried fenugreek (methi)\n* 2 tsp salt\n* 2 1/2 tblsp curry powder\n* 2 tsp ginger powder\n\n### Method\n\n1. Add to ground dry blend and grind more to blend.\n\n## Paste\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 3/4 cups oil\n* 1/2 tsp lemon juice\n* 1/4 cup white vinegar\n* 700ml water\n\n### Method\n\n1. Heat oil over high heat.\n1. Add spice blend, lemon juice, and vinegar, mix well, and bring to a boil (won't take long).\n1. Let boil for 30 seconds, then add water and mix well.\n1. Return to boil and cook down for 10-15 minutes until water is mostly gone.\n1. Remove from heat and cool.\n\nBase Gravy\n==========\n\nThis is a write-up of the instructions outlined in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A91qv2O5eQw). It's recommended to watch the video before cooking, as it includes a lot of technical and visual information, and the author is very knowledgeable.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1L oil\n  * Note: I and some [other users](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/6bwqsp/making_british_restaurantstyle_base_gravy_and/dhzj89l/) think this is way more than necessary. Consider using closer to 1 cup.\n* 3 tblsp garlic paste\n* 3 tblsp ginger paste\n* 1 1/2 tblsp table salt\n* 5kg onions, chopped into 1 inch bands.\n* 1 tsp chili powder (normal, not extra hot)\n* 1 1/2 tblsp turmeric\n* 350g cabbage, coarsely shredded.\n* 1 carrot, in slices.\n* 5L cold water\n* Prepared Kashmiri Masala paste.\n\n### Method\n\n1. Heat oil over high heat in large kettle.\n1. Add garlic/ginger paste, cook stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan for 30 seconds.\n1. Add table salt. Cook until just starting to brown, and the garlic is fragrant.\n1. Add 2L cold water and stir to deglaze and combine.\n1. Add onions, chili powder, and turmeric, and remaining 3L water.\n1. Stir and mix onions and spices around as water heats.\n1. Add cabbage and carrots. Put a lid on and cook for 20 minutes.\n1. Stir, return lid and cook, covered, for another 30 minutes.\n1. Stir, boil vigorously uncovered for an hour.\n1. Add Kashmiri masala paste. Cook on medium heat for 30 minutes.\n1. The onions should be really soft. Take off heat and let set overnight. The gravy will continue to cook for several more hours.\n1. (The next day) temperature should be tepid. Blend *really* well.\n1. Cook on medium heat for 30 minutes, cool, and package. Gravy can be frozen or used immediately.\n\n(Butter Chicken Prep): Pre-cooked Chicken\n=========================================\nI couldn't find a video from **h4ppyleader** for this one, so I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOUbNmU5avg).\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 2 tblsp Oil\n* 1 tblsp Garlic/Ginger paste.\n* Uncooked chicken (~2 lbs), cut into bite-sized chunks.\n* 1/2 cup base gravy (above).\n\nNote: I deviated from the video and dry-brined the chicken in advance by sprinkling about 2tblsp of salt over it, letting it sit for 15 minutes, and then rinsing it off. If you do this, *make sure you rinse the salt off*.\n\n### Method\n\n1. Heat oil in pan.\n1. Add paste and stir to cook until fragrant.\n1. Add chicken and mix around.\n1. Add about 1/2 cup base gravy and mix around to coat.\n1. Cook down on high without stirring for 3-5 minutes, and reserve.\n\n(Butter Chicken Prep): Masala Sauce\n===================================\n\nMy wife was hungry and I didn't have time to find a British Indian video for masala sauce. I Googled and threw together [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228293/curry-stand-chicken-tikka-masala-sauce/).\n\nButter Chicken\n==============\n\nThis is a write-up of the instructions outlined in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZQBhJ7v5uE). It's recommended to watch the video before cooking, as it includes a lot of technical and visual information, and the author is very knowledgeable.\n\nThe video shows the dish being prepared over a restaurant oven. The cooking times that I'm listing here are for my home kitchen oven, which has a markedly less intense flame. Adjust as needed, guided by the visual state of the food from the video.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* Base ghee, not too much.\n* 1/4 onion, finely chopped.\n* 1 tsp garlic\n* Pinch of salt\n* 1/2 tsp dried fenugreek (methi)\n* 1/4 cup tomato sauce\n* 1 1/2 tsp curry powder\n* 1/2 cup base gravy (above)\n* 3 tsp sugar\n* 3 tsp almond powder\n* 3 tsp coconut powder\n* 1/2 cup masala sauce (above)\n* 1 cup base gravy\n* Chicken (above)\n* Add 1/4 cup butter ghee (I used regular butter)\n* Pinch of dried fenugreek (methi).\n\n### Method\n\n1. Heat ghee over high heat. Add onion, saut\u00e9 until soft, about 3 minutes.\n1. Add garlic, saut\u00e9 for 10 seconds.\n1. Add salt and fenugreek, saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds.\n1. Add tomato sauce and curry powder on top of onions (no stirring) and heat until intensely boiling.\n1. Add 1/2 cup base gravy to deglaze, mixing and scraping pan in the process. Let boil intensely for 1 minute.\n1. Add sugar, almond and coconut powders, masala sauce, and 1 cup base gravy. Mix well and let boil for 2 minutes.\n1. Add chicken and mix. Let boil intensely for 5-8 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.\n1. Heat butter in a clean pan until just browning.\n1. Remove butter from heat, mix in fenugreek.\n1. Add butter / fenugreek mixture to chicken mixture and serve.\n\nAddendum\n=========\nAs an aside, **h4ppyleader** (the video author) repeatedly referenced an upcoming e-book of his. His videos are 3 years old now, but I couldn't find the e-book anywhere. If anyone knows whether it was ever actually published, please link it, as I'd love to have an authoratative reference for all of this.\n\n**Edit:** Added note on reducing base gravy oil quantity.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/6bwqsp/making_british_restaurantstyle_base_gravy_and/", "created_utc": 1495119906.0, "score": 71, "author": "Jahava", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/6bwqsp/making_british_restaurantstyle_base_gravy_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Ever heard of *Tandoori* Chicken or *Paneer Tikka*? This is the magical marinade that flavours those dishes. This marinade recipe pairs wonderfully with meat, poultry, [*paneer*](https://youtu.be/fSpWszJAb8k) and also with vegetables. \n\nFor the full *desi* style barbecue experience, serve your barbecued items with naan,[ *dal makhan*i](https://youtu.be/zkTdxa6aZ9w), mint & coriander chutney and [picked onions](https://youtu.be/1MLlw5dXoZ4). Pickled onions are a must!  \n\nRecipe video: [https://youtu.be/F0JTpXOUT8I](https://youtu.be/F0JTpXOUT8I)\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* **5 tbsp or 75ml** greek yoghurt or *dahi*\n* **1 tsp** *ghee* or oil\n* **2 tbsp** ginger garlic paste\n* **1 tsp** sweet paprika powder\\*\n* **1/2 tsp** *kashmiri* chilli powder\n* **1/2 tsp** turmeric\n* **1/2 tsp** *garam masala*\n* **2 tsp** MDH *tandoori masala* or meat *masala*\\*\\*\n* **1 tsp** *kasoori methi*\n* **1 tsp** salt\n* **1/2 tsp** freshly crushed pepper\n* **1 tsp** sugar\n* **1-2 tbsp** chopped coriander (preferably including stems)\n* **2 tsp** *besan* (or flour)\n\n### Method\n\n1. Add the yoghurt to a medium sized bowl.\n2. Grate in the ginger and garlic with a fine grater. De-seed and finely chop the green chillies. Add them to the yoghurt.  \nAlternately, you can pound the aromatics in a mortar and pestle.\n3. Add the oil, and all the powdered spices mentioned in the ingredients list as well as the salt, sugar, *kasoori methi* and *besan*.\n4. Mix well and add in the chopped coriander stems and leaves.\n5. Slather on to anything you're going to be barbecuing and enjoy!\n\n#### Notes\n\n**\\*Spice level and heat -** We  decided to de-seed the chilles in this recipe and like to use a blend  of kashmiri chilli powder and sweet paprika powder. Although sweet  paprika isn't the most traditional Indian ingredient, we use it for a  few reasons..1. although kashmiri chilli is considered mild, we find  it's still quite spicy 2. that attractive red colour is a signature sign  on tandoori dishes, and we find that using sweet paprika helps achieve  this colour without the use of artificial food colouring which most  restaurants use 3. the MDH tandoori masala also has a considerable  amount of spice so do keep that in mind when adding other spices.\n\nHaving  said that, if you'd like a fiery hot marinade by all means, leave the  seeds in and use kashmiri chilli powder instead of sweet paprika.\n\n**\\*\\*MDH Tandoori Masala** \\- To make things a tad bit easier, we recommended using the *MDH Tandoori Masala* in this recipe (in our video we used the MDH *Meat Masala*  since that's what we had lying around at home). This is not a sponsored suggestion. We have found that MDH is one of the most widely available  spice blend brands here in Germany and is an authentic option to go for  compared to spice blends you might find in your local supermarket. Shan and Everest are just as good too! However, if you don't have access to  these boxed spice blends, we'd recommend using an additional teaspoon of [*garam masala*](https://youtu.be/ZvxQJopNWuY) instead.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/o0mfxo/tandoori_marinade_the_only_recipe_youll_ever_need/", "created_utc": 1623785227.0, "score": 74, "author": "indishious", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/o0mfxo/tandoori_marinade_the_only_recipe_youll_ever_need/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Add the egg (if using) and water and mix gently with your fingers to make a dough. you don\u2019t want it too soft or too hard so adjust the water as required\n2. once mixed cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for around 30 minutes in the refrigerator\n3. once relaxed, flour your work surface and divide the dough in four parts then roll each of them into balls\n4. one at a time roll into 6\u20138-inch circles using as much flour as needed to stop them sticking to your rolling pin. I find it easier to get good circles if you roll the middle of the dough, turn the dough a little then do the same 5. again. Keep repeating this until you have your circle\n5. cover the entire dough circle with ghee, normal butter or oil then sprinkle all over with flour\n6. make a slit from the centre to one edge and like the minute hand sweeping a clock roll the dough circle into a cone shape\n7. stand it up like a traffic cone and squash it flat with the palm of your hand before repeating the process for the other 3 dough balls\n8. refrigerate the dough pieces for around 15 minutes as this makes the final part easier\n9. finally, roll into 6\u20138-inch circles again and stack them on a plate applying flour in between the layers. Your paratha is now ready to be fried or stored in the fridge until needed\n10. to finish dust off the flour, add a little ghee, normal butter or oil to a a pan and fry on a low to medium heat for 2 minutes each side until the layers rise and the spirals start to lift apart\n11. if you're going for a full on calorie fest then brush with more ghee or butter and enjoy with your favourite dish", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/nhnufx/parathas/", "created_utc": 1621587068.0, "score": 70, "author": "thecurrykid-co-uk", "num_comments": 33, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/nhnufx/parathas/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Meal prep methods for Indian food", "selftext": "Hello! As someone who will move out of India soon for a PhD, I was trying to get hold of some meal prep plan/method for Indian food that will work for me. \n\nI looked at a few YouTube videos for 'Indian meal prep', but they mostly seem to be methods where people cook a week's worth of gravies, curries, vegetables, and rotis together and pack them in lunchboxes and store. I'm NOT looking for a meal prep like this. I want to able to cook a fresh meal at least once every day without wasting a lot of time (I'm imagining this is where meal prep would come into picture?) and without exhausting myself too much (especially if I'm doing the main cooking in the morning).\n\nTo give a background, I'm vegetarian, I've been cooking full meals for last few years now and I think I understand my taste, spices proportion, and general methods of cooking different vegetables and curries quite well. I'm thinking of meal prep along the lines of having a set meal plan for every week, get groceries for it on weekends, clean/chop all needed vegetables, soak and boil whole beans like chana, matar, etc, make a roti dough for the week, and store all this in fridge. And cook rice, make rotis, and cook the vegetable for a day on that morning/night. Note: I don't mind including occasional western dishes for some meals, like a vegetable sandwich, or noodles, wraps, things like that. But I'd prefer if atleast 3/5th of all weekly meals could be Indians dishes.\n\nI'm wondering if it is even possible do follow this plan regularly and long term, in terms of how exhausting it will be. So if any Indians abroad (especially students!) have this kind of meal prep in place then I'd HIGHLY appreciate if you could share your method and your experiences! I'm also looking for tips on which things could go into fridge for how many days without going bad. For example, is it okay to store a week's worth of roti dough in fridge or will it go bad in three-four days? And, if you could also suggest some healthy and fulfilling, but less time consuming recipes of your own, then that would be extreme helpful too. Thank you in advance!\n\n\nEdit: I just realised that there's quite a lot of posts for meal prep in this subreddit itself and I'm going through them one by one now!

But but, I am a mood oriented person and what if I just find myself to be sh*t af baking and give it up altogether and then the OTG oven might not longer serve any specific purpose (because I researched and found that it takes average 15 to 20 mins to heat up and is no good in regular functions like heating up food). \n\nAlso we're a family of pure vegetarians, so we won't be experimenting with non veg dishes.

{"title": "Saag gosht/lamb palak: how long to simmer for meat to come out tender?", "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nI'm fairly new to Indian cooking (live in the UK so have eaten a lot of Indian food but only started trying to make it myself in the past few months) so this is probably a silly beginner question. One of my favourite dishes to prepare is saag gosht/lamb spinach curry, and it always tastes good but I sometimes find that the meat doesn't come out tender enough for my liking. I'm making it for family this weekend so would like some advice on the best way to slow-cook it without overdoing the curry. \n\nThe recipe I use for the curry sauce: \n\n1. Blanch spinach then pur\u00e9e it in a blender\n2. Heat some cumin seeds, a black cardamom pod, a bay leaf and a couple of cloves in a pan with butter/ghee \n3. Add onions less than a minute later and fry\n4. Add garlic and ginger\n5. Add salt, kasuri methi and chilli powder\n6. Add chopped tomatoes\n7. Add garam masala \n8. Mix in the pur\u00e9ed spinach\n\nFor the lamb I obviously start with searing it until browned, and then add it to the curry sauce and leave it to simmer, but I often find that this way leaves the meat chewy. The only way I've managed to have tender lamb is if I simmer the lamb separately in chicken stock in a separate pan for at least an hour and a half while preparing the rest (I don't usually have that much time to cook), then just mix it in at the end, but then the meat presumably isn't soaking up the flavours nearly as much. \n\nWould adding the seared meat at the end and just leaving the pan on a low heat for 1-2 hours work (since I'm cooking at the weekend there isn't really any time constraint) or would that lead to the curry being overcooked and less flavourful?

{"title": "How to get Saag to taste like in restaurants?", "selftext": "Hi all. I have been cooking Indian recipes for 2-3 years now, and I still cannot manage to get saag quite right. I have followed many different recipes, tried several different techniques and ratios, etc etc, but they all have a pretty similar flavor. I've looked through other posts on here about what some folks may be missing, and I've accounted for most of those in my recent attempts.\n\nFor some context, this is what I did most recently:\n\n1. I tempered mustard seed, cumin, bay leaves, green cardamom, and cinnamon in ghee.\n2. I added finely diced white onion, later salt, ginger, and garlic. Then I added my chicken thighs.\n3. All while this is going, I'm boiling mustard greens, fresh fenugreek leaves, and cilantro in another pot with corn meal, ghee, salt, and lemon juice. I let it go for 2-3 hours.\n4. I add a can of tomato paste, then spices: kashmiri chilli powder, chilli powder, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, curry powder, and cumin. All 1 tsp except for the chilli powder, which is 2 tsp.\n5. After letting it simmer for a while I mixed the greens in with the rest. I added more ghee and a little bit of whole fat yoghurt, then I let it simmer for more time.\n\nIt's still delicious, but I can't help but feel like the spice ratio / choices covered up the unique flavors of the whole spices and greens. I always make sure there's a bit of kick, but I feel like certain spices cancel each other out and kind of subtract from the taste in the first place.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that my garam masala powder is not the best, since it is from Kroger. I did use fresh fenugreek leaves and not dried, as well (I learned my lesson the hard way with using too many of the seeds one time). Maybe that might have something to do with it? I did use tomato paste with this recipe, but I have the same issue with fresh tomatoes.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1k08e47/how_to_get_saag_to_taste_like_in_restaurants/", "created_utc": 1744766099.0, "score": 1, "author": "disastral0", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1k08e47/how_to_get_saag_to_taste_like_in_restaurants/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

There are many non veg dish as well most famous is Lal Maas. As I am a vegetarian I can only list these items. There are much more dishes than listed. Rajasthan is the largest state of India and I come from Marwar Region I don't know about Mewari, Hadoti, or Shekawati region. Then there comes many more states in North where Garhwali cuisine, Himachali cuisine, Kumaoni cuisine (all pahadi) Punjabi, Haryanvi cuisine of their respective states . Please refrain using this statement of North Indian food similar to that of Pak. We should not consider the restaurant food menu as our daily staple food. I am sure many Punjabis would not eat the restaurant menu food on daily basis. I hope I am not sounding rude, but as my marwadi cuisine is not world famous apart from Daal Baati Churma, the people in the world assume that naan, or butter chicken or similar types of punjabi food  is all of North Indian. I hope my fellow Marwadis will get what I wanna convey here .) Now I was banned from that sub and people commenting that I am spreading hate. Idk what wrong I did . It was just a normal post where I wanted them to understand that North Indian cuisine is not just about punjabi food which is similar to their's. People commenting about you are a bjp supporter , you clearly have an agenda etc. my post doesn't even demean any religion,caste gender not even Pakistanis as well. How did I offend them .

All the comments (positive and negative) made me think more and more about it. The idea kind of took wings and here I am a few months later with a more polished and more multi-purpose tool.\n\nThe product in a way is not specific to Indian Cooking, but wanted to post here first because this is where it all started. Of course, there are plenty of uses for this in Indian cuisine too!\n\nFor example:\n\n* Make ghee without burning (of course)\n* Make yogurt or dosa batter in cold climates\n* Perfectly crispy dosas or fluffy phulkas\n* Easy long cooked dals like dal makhni\n* Use as a rice cooker with any pan\n* Read dum biriyani without burning the bottom\n* ...\n\nThe closest product I can think about are the Control Freak (pro and home versions) which retail at 1500$ and 1200$ respectively. I believe our product will cost around 10 times less.\n\nHave a look at the [Github page](https://github.com/WEkigai/Precius) (for all opensource information) or the more [consumer friendly webpage](https://wekigai.eu/precius) if you are not too much into technical details.\n\nIs the idea clear? Is something confusing? Do you miss a major detail? Can I say things differently? Would you buy one at 100-150$ range? What would be that killer application you would buy it for? In the current design, do you see a 'deal breaker' ?\n\nI am open to all kind of feedback, suggestions, criticism or just plain support.\n\nThanks and wish me luck!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1jjhb3s/i_am_making_an_open_source_cooktop_what_do_you/", "created_utc": 1742902752.0, "score": 12, "author": "WEkigai", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1jjhb3s/i_am_making_an_open_source_cooktop_what_do_you/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, and place a light weight on top for about 10 minutes to help press out excess moisture. Once pressed, slice it into cubes of roughly 2\u20133 cm. In a bowl, combine the chilli powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the tofu, stirring gently so each piece is coated. Allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\n\n   Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the ends, and cut it into wedges\u2014aim for around 6\u20138 wedges per onion, depending on its size. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers, then chop them into bite-sized chunks of about 2\u20133 cm. Set the vegetables aside while the tofu marinates.\n\n2. Warm 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. If using cumin seeds, add them first and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Tip in the tofu cubes (along with any remaining marinade) and fry for 5\u20136 minutes, turning occasionally, until they become lightly golden. Transfer the tofu to a plate.\n\n3. Add the onion wedges, green pepper, and red pepper to the same pan. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes, allowing the edges to caramelise lightly for extra depth of flavour. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Sprinkle in the ground coriander and garam masala, tossing the vegetables until they\u2019re well coated. Add the chopped tomatoes or passata, followed by the tomato pur\u00e9e and sugar. Season with \u00bd teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste). Let the sauce simmer for about 5\u20137 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\n\n5. Return the golden tofu cubes to the pan, folding them into the sauce so each piece is evenly coated.

{"title": "Are there two different butter chicken recipe types or am I crazy?", "selftext": "For years I've thought that there are two different kinds of butter chicken. The \"Red Kind\" which has a more creamy/tomatoey flavour with a bit of tang to it but mostly sweeter, and the \"Yellow Kind\" which has more of an earthy taste to it and isn't sweet, I'd compare the flavour more to cardboard.\n\nYou can never know which it is from the menu until it gets served to you, but the colour can give a slight indication.\n\nI really hate the yellow kind, but the red kind is one of my favourite dishes ever. So every time I eat the yellow kind, I get upset and look online and I see... no one talking about this. I get results for people asking about butter chicken vs tikka masala or people asking for the best recipe for butter chicken which is not what I'm looking for. I want to know why I percieve there to be two different types of butter chicken, and why does no one else seem to care? So because I never find answers I'm looking for, I decided to finally make a post myself to see if that can yield something.\n\nFor further context, I am Australian. White Australian, so to me, Indian food is ethnic food. That being said, I eat a lot of Indian. I've had cheap prepackaged meals, made at home from sauce jars, and prepared at restaurants both super modern and so authentic you can smell the spices of the restaurant a block away, and I've experienced the Red Kind from all of them, and the Yellow Kind from all of them.\n\nI presume what I'm tasting is authentic vs localised recipes, and maybe I prefer the localised recipe, but I really cannot tell what's up. My best guess is that the ginger in the recipe is stronger in the yellow kind, and weaker in the red kind.\n\nBut that's not the question at hand here. The question I really want to know is, am I crazy for picking up on this? Can anyone else taste this difference? If people can, why are they both called Butter Chicken? If other people can't taste the difference, why can I?\n\nFor quick reference of a hopefully global/anglo standard, I would say that Patak's Butter Chicken is easily the Red Kind, and I *think* Sharwood's Butter Chicken is the yellow kind. I'm not sure if I don't like Sharwood's because it's the yellow kind or if I simply don't like it however, I haven't had Sharwood's in a year or so.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1j0xkvc/are_there_two_different_butter_chicken_recipe/", "created_utc": 1740828978.0, "score": 22, "author": "evilparagon", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1j0xkvc/are_there_two_different_butter_chicken_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This is another EasyIndianFood kitchen hack to make Indian cooking accessible to all.\n\nNot only is it fast and easy, it\u2019s also tasty and healthy too. *\u201cBund Gobi*\u201d is cabbage - rich in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. *\u201cBund\u201d* in Hindi (sometimes transliterated as *\u201cband\u201d*) means \u201cclosed\u201d \u2014 so unlike cauliflower with \u201copen\u201d florets, cabbage is considered \u201cclosed\u201d or *\u201cbund*\u201d because the leaves are so tightly wound. Don\u2019t confuse it for the other gobi of the Indian staple dish *Aloo Gobi*, which uses cauliflower.\n\nThe masala for this dish is ginger-based, very simple, and light. With a little olive oil in the pan, all you need to do is quickly temper mustard seeds, hing, and curry leaves on medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp of chopped ginger. Then fry 1 cup of frozen peas (how easy and convenient is that?) for 3-4 minutes until cooked through.\n\nPour the bag of cabbage in and then sprinkle 1/2 tsp. each of salt, ground coriander, ground cumin, and turmeric. Fry it up for 1-2 mins on medium high, then cover and lower heat, but keep the fire on for 2-3 more minutes. Check the cabbage and ensure it\u2019s still al dente, and then cover again and turn off the flame. Just let it sit covered for another 5-7 minutes to steam and it\u2019s done - literally that easy.\n\nGarnish with fresh cilantro and eat with roti, chapati, or naan (and if you like it spicier, add a bit of cayenne with the other spices or grab some Indian pickled mango or lime, aka \u201cachaar\u201d.)\n\nMy mission with EasyIndianFood is to take the complexity out of Indian cooking and find easy ways to feed yourselves and your families. This recipe for Cabbage Stir Fry with Peas is right up there in my top ten EasyIndianFoods for those reasons\u2026hope you enjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ixnt3w/easy_indian_food_cabbage_stir_fry_with_peas_bund/", "created_utc": 1740461964.0, "score": 9, "author": "shaktimaan21", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1ixnt3w/easy_indian_food_cabbage_stir_fry_with_peas_bund/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I used a very hot variant of Guntur chillies for the red chillies and the chilli powder but they can substituted with any chilli powder and Thai chillies to the same amount as mentioned below. This recipe makes 6-7 portions and it can be enjoyed with any rice, breads, or millets. This recipe can also be used for chicken thighs but please keep in mind, it will take a lot less time to cook the chicken. If you do not have ghee, just use a bit more oil. \n\nApproximate cooking time: 2 hours\n\n**Ingredients for marination:**\n\n- 1.1 kg bone-in goat cubed medium sized\n- 3 tbsp red chilli powder\n- 1 tbsp of salt\n- 0.5 tbsp of turmeric\n- 1.5 tbsp of ginger garlic paste\n- 4-5 tbsp of plain yoghurt\n\n**Ingredients for curry:**\n\n- 2 large red onions\n- 15 red chillies (use as many as you want if that's too much for your taste)\n- 5 tbsp canola/vegetable oil\n- 2 tbsp ghee\n- 3 tbsp ginger garlic paste\n- 3 tbsp coriander powder\n- 3 tbsp chilli powder\n- 3 tbsp sesame seed/Til powder\n- 1.5 tbsp garam masala\n- Enough water to cover the meat\n- Coriander leaves\n- Mint leaves\n- Curry leaves\n- Lime juice\n\n**Instructions for marination:**\n\n1. Into a bowl, add the marinating ingredients and mix them well. Add mutton and marinate well.\n\n2. Keep the marinate in fridge for 12 hours if you are able or 2 hours minimum. \n\n**Instructions for curry:**\n\n1. Cut the chillies into halves and keep the seeds. Small dice red onions. \n\n2. To a saucepan or a dutch oven on medium-medium high heat, add oil and ghee. Once oil is hot, add chillies and cook for a minute. Add onions and cook until golden brown.\n\n3. Add ginger garlic paste, coriander powder and stir together for a minute until the raw smell of the paste goes away. \n\n4. Add mutton and curry leaves, and turn down heat to low and on closed lid, cook for 5-7 minutes stirring it occasionally. \n\n5. Turn on the heat to medium-medium high, add chilli powder, sesame powder, 1 tablespoon garam masala, enough water to fully cover the meat, mix well and bring to a gentle boil then turn the heat down to low and gently simmer until the meat falls apart the bone or is tender which can take 1.5-2 hours depending on the cut. Adjust salt and heat after tasting whilst the mutton cooks if you need. \n\n6. After the mutton is cooked, add 0.5 tablespoons of garam masala, a handful of coriander leaves and a few mint leaves and cook for 3-5 mins and until you see oil floating.

It can be skipped as long as the meat is marinated at least over 12 hours) \n\n\n\nFor making rice:\n\n- Aged Basmati Rice - 700-750g (I used Guruji brand) \n- Water - 3L\n- Handful of coriander and mint leaves\n- Lemon juice - 1/2 of lemon (the recipe I followed calls for it but I don't think it's necessary)\n- Salt - 2.5 TBSP\n- Oil - 2 TBSP \n- Caraway seeds - 1 TSP\n- Cardamom Pods - 6\n- Cloves - 5\n- Cinnamon sticks - 3 \n- Mace - 2-4 strands, Bay Leaf - 2, 2 star anise (in my opinion, these can be optional but they add great flavour and the star anise is great for fragrance)\n\n\n\nFor layering:\n\n\n- Some coriander and mint leaves\n- Saffron milk (10-15 strands in steeped in 120ml warm milk for 15-20mins)\n- 140ml of Ghee \n- 5 green chillies \n- 200g of fried onions \n- 2 tsp of garam masala powder \n\n\nProcess:\n\n\nFor marination:\n\n\n1. Mix in all the powdered, whole spices, meat tenderiser, salt with the yoghurt and ginger garlic paste in a large bowl thoroughly. \n\n2. Add the meat and marinate it well. Add in the remaining ingredients and marinate well. Leave the meat in the fridge for at least 12 hours if not 24 hours. \n\n\n\nWhen you're ready to cook:\n\n\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. In an enameled dutch oven, layer all the marinated meat as evenly as possible with larger chunks at the bottom. \n\n\n\nTo cook the rice and also assembling:\n\nWash the rice until it's clear under cold water and let it soak for an 45mins-1 hour. \n\n1. Bring the water to a gentle boil and add in all the ingredients except the rice. \n\n2. Let it all boil for at least 5 mins to release the aromas. Add the rice gently and let it boil for 2 mins. \n\n3. Gently layer half of the cooked rice in an even layer over the meat. Add/pour in half of the ingredients for layering all over the rice. Sprinkle 1 tsp of garam masala on top.  \n\n4. Let the remaining rice boil gently for another 2-2.5 mins and layer it evenly over the first layer. \n\n5. Add in the remaining layering ingredients evenly over the rice the same way as before for the second layer. \n\n6. Cover the top of the pot fully with aluminium foil and close the lid. \n\n7. Bake at 350F for 45 mins, then lower the temp to 300F and bake for another 50-60 minutes. Let the pot cool on the countertop for 15 mins before opening. Enjoy! \n\n\nFor cooking on stovetop:\n1. Place the cooking pot on high heat and cook for 2 mins. Then on low heat for 5 mins. \n2. On a heavy bottom pan, place the pot and cook on high heat for 5 mins. Then on low again for 45 mins. \n\n\nThis was my second attempt at making mutton biryani and this one turned really well than the last. I highly suggest to taste the water before adding the rice to check for salt. It should be slightly saltier than a good soup. If the rice is not salted well, the dish won't taste like much. You can use the same recipe for chicken thighs too but it won't take nearly as long (around 70 mins in the oven at 375F I'd say) and instead of 2 layers of rice, just 1 layer after boiling the rice for 3-4 minutes is enough.

In the past, I've made it just by boiling the rava in the water, and it has always come out lumpy, so I was intrigued by this approach. \n\nIt did produce a much smoother texture than what I've tried before, but it's also a bit grainy and seems slightly undercooked. I'm wondering if people have different approaches that don't create a lumpy dish? Or if I did something wrong? I did change a few variables from the recipe as written: I used less ghee, and I don't have a stovetop pressure cooker so I just used a pot. Since the cooker presumably never comes to pressure since you turn the stove off before adding the rava, I didn't think this would be an issue.

{"title": "South Indian Idli and dosa - general purpose batter", "selftext": "South Indian here.  Commented on a thread and felt this could be useful for someone trying to make idly and dosa.\n\nHere is what my wife does for good idli's, at least from my perspective. Note rava idli is different, this is just for plain soft idlis and dosas. For crispier dosas, rice needs to be even more, but we mostly make this as a general purpose batter.\n\n1. I use 5 cups idli rice (It is a specific [short grain parboiled rice](https://amzn.to/40ubfVI) you can get it in Indian stores if in US, and all stores in south India. Not sure about north India) + 1 cup whole [whole urad dal ](https://amzn.to/4hcFlEo)without skin + 1 tbsp [fenugreek](https://amzn.to/40Sl7Kv). You will not get same results with other rice which are mostly long grain.\n2. Grind fenugreek first, then urad dal until fluffy and fine textured. Urad dal will absorb water and become airy and increase in quantity when ground. If it does not, it is not good quality. Remove it to container.\n3. Then grind rice (order is important, note grinding rice second). Once done remove it to the same container with urad and fenugreek. Add salt to taste. Mix well and store it at room temperature (basically need 27c or more, 80 f). If in cooler climates like most of US, keep it in the oven with the oven light on. Leave it overnight so it ferments and rises by 50% or more\n4. Next morning, mix batter well. The first day batter is best for idly. The subsequent days are better for dosas, even though you can use it for both all days.\n5. You can twist the recipe a bit, by replacing 1 portion rice with other ancient grains if you prefer, which is what we are doing as we grow older and health conscious, trying to add more nutrition to idlis which are already a healthy no oil steamed food as-is. But these hybrid idli's are not as favored by the kids.\n6. Grinder - we used to have a wet grinder, but realized the ones we get in US are not great. They also go bad quickly, fail easily etc. Started using [blenders](https://amzn.to/3WE3L18) and we like them. Only issue is the urad dal does not increase in quantity as much, does not get very airy like in wet grinder. But does not change taste and texture much after fermentation rise. Many are less than USD 100 and we can replace them easily. Our has been in service for 3 years so far with no issues. The wet grinder we have is just a relic at this point.\n\nEdit 1: Soak rice, urad dal, fenugreek seed separately in water for 4 - 6 hours. I do it separate, seems urad and fenugreek together is fine. Grind fenugreek first, urad second in the same go. Grind rice separate\n\nEdit 2: Post grinding, the quantity of fluffy urad is same as the quantity of rice. That is how much the urad will fluff up (5 times appox)\n\nEdit 3: Fermentation will double the quantity, and once you mix it up it will fall flat after releasing air. Store in fridge after that. Mind you, I have had it spill over the container into my oven many times during fermentation overnight.

{"title": "How can I get my pulau rice right? Instant Pot vs normal pressure cooker?", "selftext": "Hello :)\n\nI am very new to cooking (only started like 1 month ago), started learning it because of being inspired by Indian food, so decided that I want to be able to make it myself.\n\nThe curries I do etc. come out alright. Still a long way to go but so far I am very happy with the results.\n\nBut the rice though, something that is probably supposed to be so simple, never comes right in terms of texture.\n\nI have Instant Pot (actually I have two) and I prefer cooking everything in Instant Pot if possible.\n\nThe way I make pulau rice is:\n\nFirst I measure 2 cups of rice (I always use basmati rice), wash it in a pot for 5-10 times... After that cover it with water and let it soak for 25-30 minutes. Then drain the water obviously.\n\nWhen it's all ready, I turn on the saute mode in my Instant Pot, wait for a minute or two, add a generous amount of sunflower oil, wait for the oil to get hot, put the whole spices (cumin, cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, black pepper)... Later I add 1 big chopped onion... green chillies... frozen vegetables.... rice.... ground spices... about 3 cups of water, maybe a bit less.. taste, adjust the salt... stir it all well...\n\nPressure cook on high pressure for 5 minutes (Keep Warm option is Off). When done, I leave it on natural pressure release for \\~15 min, release the remaining pressure... And after that I move the rice into another pot to make sure it doesn't keep being cooked in the hot pot... Well, actually I am following the recipes for making Pulau rice in Instant Pot here, so I would expect it to work well but it doesn't :\\\\\n\nThe rice comes out OK in terms of taste... But the texture is not right... I mean, it's not too bad, but the lower layers of rice look quite compressed and sticky... If I add less water, it can also burn a bit on the bottom which is not ideal either, but even in that case I think the texture wasn't that good.\n\nLike, if I compare my Pulau rice to that in an Indian restaurant... Every grain is separating nicely... It looks so perfect... I will attach the photos of mine here :\\\\\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/QmZN1BJDZxUTZoAK7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QmZN1BJDZxUTZoAK7)\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/bvrSutmWq71PkxSs5](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bvrSutmWq71PkxSs5)\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLd6QDrQdfdciUnz7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLd6QDrQdfdciUnz7)\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/f4viDHpttdFkYVFVA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f4viDHpttdFkYVFVA)\n\n  \nThe first two pictures were made yesterday. I was talking to my Peruvian friend and shared the photos with her. She started laughing at my rice, saying she can count separate grains in her rice, while she would count my rice in \"balls\" rather than grains \ud83d\ude01 Well, she was just joking but it hurt \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI have an Indian friend online and I would ask her for any advices but she uses normal pressure cooker, just like some other Indian friends I have, so they would probably have no experience with Instant Pot anyway. I am now wondering if it's worth for me to buy a normal pressure cooker as well, so I could follow their suggestions and be more consistent for rice, and use Instant Pot for everything else? :\\\\\n\nAny advices?......... :(\n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ibzjv7/how_can_i_get_my_pulau_rice_right_instant_pot_vs/", "created_utc": 1738063984.0, "score": 3, "author": "heitian_boyi", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1ibzjv7/how_can_i_get_my_pulau_rice_right_instant_pot_vs/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Butter chicken too oniony? It made us really sick", "selftext": "I had an Indian person teach me how to make authentic butter chicken sauce, but I kinda think he made it wrong??? He said we needed 3 tomatoes and a huge bag of onions, a 3 cm x 2cm piece of ginger and 1 clove of garlic. I kept confirming with him that he meant a big bag of onions and not a big bag of tomatoes, but he was for sure for sure set on 3 tomatoes and a huge bag of onions. I got 4 tomatoes because of a nagging hunch in the back of my mind that 3 tomatoes just wasn\u2019t anywhere near enough. \n\nFast forward to when we cook together, we chop and combine the 4 ingredients, cook it, blend it and cook it again for 15/20ish minutes. This curry was bright yellow, barely orange, not the vibrant red I remember butter chicken being. It tasted good but it made most of my roomies very sick for many days because of how oniony it is. They\u2019ve never had this reaction to any Indian food before. \n\nI repeatedly asked if/what spices we needed when planning/shopping and he just said \u201cbutter chicken spices\u201d even when I asked him to specify individual spices. When we were cooking suddenly he was asking where the cummin and other spices were \ud83d\ude2d like, dude, I don\u2019t have those, all you told me to get was \u201cbutter chicken spices\u201d so I got a butter chicken spice mix from a local shop. When I tell you this man went spice happy with every damn thing that could be found in my kitchen while complaining that I didn\u2019t have the right spices- \n\nThe next time i heated it up I added the 4th tomatoe (still isn\u2019t anywhere near the red colour i vividly remember) and cooked it down for 2 hours, but still he roomies react bad to it and say \u201cit\u2019s too oniony\u201d. The spices are somehow really good despite him going all ratatouille, so I don\u2019t think the spices are the issue, it\u2019s just really really really oniony. We couldn\u2019t taste the ginger or garlic at all. Was it not made correctly? Should it have been a big bag of tomatoes and 3 onions rather than 3 tomatoes and a big bag of onions? Trying to save this curry cause we already put so much money into it \ud83e\udd72\n\nBonus story - I wanted to put tofu in the curry or make other \u201cunusual\u201d additions and he got so sniffy about it, he says Indian food must be made the \u201cright way\u201d and you are not allowed to \u201cruin it\u201d \ud83d\ude00 bro I think the sauce will be the same no matter what you put it on or eat it with.

{"title": "Meal prep methods for Indian food", "selftext": "Hello! As someone who will move out of India soon for a PhD, I was trying to get hold of some meal prep plan/method for Indian food that will work for me. \n\nI looked at a few YouTube videos for 'Indian meal prep', but they mostly seem to be methods where people cook a week's worth of gravies, curries, vegetables, and rotis together and pack them in lunchboxes and store. I'm NOT looking for a meal prep like this. I want to able to cook a fresh meal at least once every day without wasting a lot of time (I'm imagining this is where meal prep would come into picture?) and without exhausting myself too much (especially if I'm doing the main cooking in the morning).\n\nTo give a background, I'm vegetarian, I've been cooking full meals for last few years now and I think I understand my taste, spices proportion, and general methods of cooking different vegetables and curries quite well. I'm thinking of meal prep along the lines of having a set meal plan for every week, get groceries for it on weekends, clean/chop all needed vegetables, soak and boil whole beans like chana, matar, etc, make a roti dough for the week, and store all this in fridge. And cook rice, make rotis, and cook the vegetable for a day on that morning/night. Note: I don't mind including occasional western dishes for some meals, like a vegetable sandwich, or noodles, wraps, things like that. But I'd prefer if atleast 3/5th of all weekly meals could be Indians dishes.\n\nI'm wondering if it is even possible do follow this plan regularly and long term, in terms of how exhausting it will be. So if any Indians abroad (especially students!) have this kind of meal prep in place then I'd HIGHLY appreciate if you could share your method and your experiences! I'm also looking for tips on which things could go into fridge for how many days without going bad. For example, is it okay to store a week's worth of roti dough in fridge or will it go bad in three-four days? And, if you could also suggest some healthy and fulfilling, but less time consuming recipes of your own, then that would be extreme helpful too. Thank you in advance!\n\n\nEdit: I just realised that there's quite a lot of posts for meal prep in this subreddit itself and I'm going through them one by one now!

{"title": "Saag gosht/lamb palak: how long to simmer for meat to come out tender?", "selftext": "Hey all, \n\nI'm fairly new to Indian cooking (live in the UK so have eaten a lot of Indian food but only started trying to make it myself in the past few months) so this is probably a silly beginner question. One of my favourite dishes to prepare is saag gosht/lamb spinach curry, and it always tastes good but I sometimes find that the meat doesn't come out tender enough for my liking. I'm making it for family this weekend so would like some advice on the best way to slow-cook it without overdoing the curry. \n\nThe recipe I use for the curry sauce: \n\n1. Blanch spinach then pur\u00e9e it in a blender\n2. Heat some cumin seeds, a black cardamom pod, a bay leaf and a couple of cloves in a pan with butter/ghee \n3. Add onions less than a minute later and fry\n4. Add garlic and ginger\n5. Add salt, kasuri methi and chilli powder\n6. Add chopped tomatoes\n7. Add garam masala \n8. Mix in the pur\u00e9ed spinach\n\nFor the lamb I obviously start with searing it until browned, and then add it to the curry sauce and leave it to simmer, but I often find that this way leaves the meat chewy. The only way I've managed to have tender lamb is if I simmer the lamb separately in chicken stock in a separate pan for at least an hour and a half while preparing the rest (I don't usually have that much time to cook), then just mix it in at the end, but then the meat presumably isn't soaking up the flavours nearly as much. \n\nWould adding the seared meat at the end and just leaving the pan on a low heat for 1-2 hours work (since I'm cooking at the weekend there isn't really any time constraint) or would that lead to the curry being overcooked and less flavourful?

{"title": "How to get Saag to taste like in restaurants?", "selftext": "Hi all. I have been cooking Indian recipes for 2-3 years now, and I still cannot manage to get saag quite right. I have followed many different recipes, tried several different techniques and ratios, etc etc, but they all have a pretty similar flavor. I've looked through other posts on here about what some folks may be missing, and I've accounted for most of those in my recent attempts.\n\nFor some context, this is what I did most recently:\n\n1. I tempered mustard seed, cumin, bay leaves, green cardamom, and cinnamon in ghee.\n2. I added finely diced white onion, later salt, ginger, and garlic. Then I added my chicken thighs.\n3. All while this is going, I'm boiling mustard greens, fresh fenugreek leaves, and cilantro in another pot with corn meal, ghee, salt, and lemon juice. I let it go for 2-3 hours.\n4. I add a can of tomato paste, then spices: kashmiri chilli powder, chilli powder, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, curry powder, and cumin. All 1 tsp except for the chilli powder, which is 2 tsp.\n5. After letting it simmer for a while I mixed the greens in with the rest. I added more ghee and a little bit of whole fat yoghurt, then I let it simmer for more time.\n\nIt's still delicious, but I can't help but feel like the spice ratio / choices covered up the unique flavors of the whole spices and greens. I always make sure there's a bit of kick, but I feel like certain spices cancel each other out and kind of subtract from the taste in the first place.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that my garam masala powder is not the best, since it is from Kroger. I did use fresh fenugreek leaves and not dried, as well (I learned my lesson the hard way with using too many of the seeds one time). Maybe that might have something to do with it?

{"title": "How sour is kozhi kurma generally?", "selftext": "Yesterday I made a recipe by Smita Chandra for kozhi kurma from her cookbook, Cuisines of India, which calls for \u201cWalnut-size piece of seedless tamarind (2 oz/57g)\u201d and two tbsp of lemon. I even limited the amount of tamarind pulp to 1.5 ounces/42g because it already looked huge compared to a walnut. The final result was VERY VERY sour before I added extra salt, coconut milk, and jaggery. When I make the recipe again, I\u2019m going to focus on making the tamarind pulp walnut-sized instead but am nervous about it still being too sour, especially since none of the kozhi kurma recipes that I\u2019ve found online in English include tamarind or large amounts of sour ingredients. \n\nI\u2019ve included the ingredients list below to illustrate the ratio of tamarind to other items. The 1.5 oz of pulp that I cut off of the slighty sticky brick of tamarind was soaked in .5 cup of lukewarm water for 2 hours at which point I pushed it through a strainer and discarded the fibrous parts so that a light brown slurry remained. The tamarind slurry was added to the pan with the coconut milk and 1 cup water. I can confirm that I did NOT use tamarind concentrate/paste. The tamarind pulp may be a Thai brand but I can\u2019t confirm this as I tossed the packaging years ago. \n\nIs kozhi kurma sometimes quite sour?

{"title": "Ind Pak food", "selftext": "For a context I posted the below paragraph in one of the sub of desi living in abroad so as to reach my post to not just indians particularly to Pakistanis. And obviously there were many post on that sub related to Ind Pak food, so I thought of posting it in that sub (ABCDesis). So the post says ( Let's talk about food .I saw many posts where pak claims that North Indian food and Pakistani food is similar just bcoz both of us have the wheat based diet. As an Indian I completely disagree with this statement. Yeah there are some dishes which are similar but it only and only stick to states like Punjab and the Capital Delhi (among Punjabis) . I belong to Northern part of India , from Rajasthan but our marwadi food is not even closer to what pak claims as north Indian food similarity with theirs. We have a wide range of cuisine and vegetables which particularly grow in thar dessert or of the same atmosphere. We have in sabji/saag, Ker Sangri, Sogra,Kaacharr, Tinsi,Pophaliya, Gatte ki sabji etc Achar me we have Gunda, Keriya, Kachri etc, Chutney me Lehsun, Mirchikoota, Panchkoota, etc Dal Bati Churma, Papad me we have sweet papad, moong dal papad, lehsun papad etc. Rice me we have meetha chawal (do not assume adding sugar in white rice, it's completely different) ,khata chawal, then for refreshment drink we have Raabdi ,made of bajri with chaas or dahi(it's not rabdi), Masala Chaas (buttermilk), Kanji wada, Dovaa etc in sweets there's Malai Ghewar, Fini, Mawa Kachori etc, in chaat , Pyaaz kachori with aloo sabji, Mirchi wada etc, In roti we have Bajre ki, Missi roti besan, Mogar ki Roti, Amranth, Rajgirah , Singhade ki roti etc. These are all Vegetarian Dishes. There are many non veg dish as well most famous is Lal Maas. As I am a vegetarian I can only list these items. There are much more dishes than listed. Rajasthan is the largest state of India and I come from Marwar Region I don't know about Mewari, Hadoti, or Shekawati region. Then there comes many more states in North where Garhwali cuisine, Himachali cuisine, Kumaoni cuisine (all pahadi) Punjabi, Haryanvi cuisine of their respective states . Please refrain using this statement of North Indian food similar to that of Pak. We should not consider the restaurant food menu as our daily staple food. I am sure many Punjabis would not eat the restaurant menu food on daily basis. I hope I am not sounding rude, but as my marwadi cuisine is not world famous apart from Daal Baati Churma, the people in the world assume that naan, or butter chicken or similar types of punjabi food  is all of North Indian. I hope my fellow Marwadis will get what I wanna convey here .) Now I was banned from that sub and people commenting that I am spreading hate. Idk what wrong I did . It was just a normal post where I wanted them to understand that North Indian cuisine is not just about punjabi food which is similar to their's. People commenting about you are a bjp supporter , you clearly have an agenda etc. my post doesn't even demean any religion,caste gender not even Pakistanis as well. How did I offend them .

I now make masala chai every morning, and I've tried my hand at pav bhaji (including making the pav from scratch) and was told it was a little too spicy (for that particular dish) but generally good.\n\nI found a recipe for Chicken Bhuna Masala that sounds tasty and I plan to make naan from scratch. However this recipe does not have any vegetables in it (unlike the pav bhaji) and in my Germanic family typically you would have a roasted veggie and/or a cold salad. but I don't know what would go with this Chicken Bhuna Masala.\n\nI was considering making like a cucumber salad with a yogurt dressing I already have (not specifically Indian it's more middle eastern with citrus and sumac, but I could also add like some tadka to make it more Indian in flavor?). I don't have a big kitchen set up, my oven is broken so I just have a stovetop situation.\n\nWhat would be required for a full meal and /or what should I pair with the chicken?

Wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, and place a light weight on top for about 10 minutes to help press out excess moisture. Once pressed, slice it into cubes of roughly 2\u20133 cm. In a bowl, combine the chilli powder, turmeric, salt, black pepper, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the tofu, stirring gently so each piece is coated. Allow it to marinate for about 10 minutes.\n\n   Meanwhile, peel the onion, trim the ends, and cut it into wedges\u2014aim for around 6\u20138 wedges per onion, depending on its size. Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers, then chop them into bite-sized chunks of about 2\u20133 cm. Set the vegetables aside while the tofu marinates.\n\n2. Warm 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. If using cumin seeds, add them first and let them sizzle for a few seconds. Tip in the tofu cubes (along with any remaining marinade) and fry for 5\u20136 minutes, turning occasionally, until they become lightly golden. Transfer the tofu to a plate.\n\n3. Add the onion wedges, green pepper, and red pepper to the same pan. Stir-fry for 3\u20134 minutes, allowing the edges to caramelise lightly for extra depth of flavour. Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.\n\n4. Sprinkle in the ground coriander and garam masala, tossing the vegetables until they\u2019re well coated. Add the chopped tomatoes or passata, followed by the tomato pur\u00e9e and sugar. Season with \u00bd teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste). Let the sauce simmer for about 5\u20137 minutes, allowing it to thicken.\n\n5. Return the golden tofu cubes to the pan, folding them into the sauce so each piece is evenly coated. Add the chopped fresh coriander and stir. Cook for another 1\u20132 minutes to ensure the tofu absorbs all the flavours.\n\n6. Taste the sauce and adjust it according to your preference\u2014add more salt, chilli, or a pinch of sugar if needed. Garnish with extra fresh coriander.

{"title": "Are there two different butter chicken recipe types or am I crazy?", "selftext": "For years I've thought that there are two different kinds of butter chicken. The \"Red Kind\" which has a more creamy/tomatoey flavour with a bit of tang to it but mostly sweeter, and the \"Yellow Kind\" which has more of an earthy taste to it and isn't sweet, I'd compare the flavour more to cardboard.\n\nYou can never know which it is from the menu until it gets served to you, but the colour can give a slight indication.\n\nI really hate the yellow kind, but the red kind is one of my favourite dishes ever. So every time I eat the yellow kind, I get upset and look online and I see... no one talking about this. I get results for people asking about butter chicken vs tikka masala or people asking for the best recipe for butter chicken which is not what I'm looking for. I want to know why I percieve there to be two different types of butter chicken, and why does no one else seem to care? So because I never find answers I'm looking for, I decided to finally make a post myself to see if that can yield something.\n\nFor further context, I am Australian. White Australian, so to me, Indian food is ethnic food. That being said, I eat a lot of Indian. I've had cheap prepackaged meals, made at home from sauce jars, and prepared at restaurants both super modern and so authentic you can smell the spices of the restaurant a block away, and I've experienced the Red Kind from all of them, and the Yellow Kind from all of them.\n\nI presume what I'm tasting is authentic vs localised recipes, and maybe I prefer the localised recipe, but I really cannot tell what's up. My best guess is that the ginger in the recipe is stronger in the yellow kind, and weaker in the red kind.\n\nBut that's not the question at hand here. The question I really want to know is, am I crazy for picking up on this? Can anyone else taste this difference? If people can, why are they both called Butter Chicken? If other people can't taste the difference, why can I?\n\nFor quick reference of a hopefully global/anglo standard, I would say that Patak's Butter Chicken is easily the Red Kind, and I *think* Sharwood's Butter Chicken is the yellow kind.

{"title": "Easy Indian Food:  Cabbage Stir Fry with Peas (Bund Gobi Matar)", "selftext": "[https://easyindianfood.substack.com/p/cabbage-stir-fry-with-peas-bund-gobi](https://easyindianfood.substack.com/p/cabbage-stir-fry-with-peas-bund-gobi)\n\n\n\nThanks to Trader Joe's, this is a fast and easy meal, owing to their 10 oz. bag of shredded green cabbage and a bag of frozen peas. This is another EasyIndianFood kitchen hack to make Indian cooking accessible to all.\n\nNot only is it fast and easy, it\u2019s also tasty and healthy too. *\u201cBund Gobi*\u201d is cabbage - rich in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. *\u201cBund\u201d* in Hindi (sometimes transliterated as *\u201cband\u201d*) means \u201cclosed\u201d \u2014 so unlike cauliflower with \u201copen\u201d florets, cabbage is considered \u201cclosed\u201d or *\u201cbund*\u201d because the leaves are so tightly wound. Don\u2019t confuse it for the other gobi of the Indian staple dish *Aloo Gobi*, which uses cauliflower.\n\nThe masala for this dish is ginger-based, very simple, and light. With a little olive oil in the pan, all you need to do is quickly temper mustard seeds, hing, and curry leaves on medium-high heat. Add 1 tsp of chopped ginger. Then fry 1 cup of frozen peas (how easy and convenient is that?) for 3-4 minutes until cooked through.\n\nPour the bag of cabbage in and then sprinkle 1/2 tsp. each of salt, ground coriander, ground cumin, and turmeric. Fry it up for 1-2 mins on medium high, then cover and lower heat, but keep the fire on for 2-3 more minutes. Check the cabbage and ensure it\u2019s still al dente, and then cover again and turn off the flame. Just let it sit covered for another 5-7 minutes to steam and it\u2019s done - literally that easy.\n\nGarnish with fresh cilantro and eat with roti, chapati, or naan (and if you like it spicier, add a bit of cayenne with the other spices or grab some Indian pickled mango or lime, aka \u201cachaar\u201d.)\n\nMy mission with EasyIndianFood is to take the complexity out of Indian cooking and find easy ways to feed yourselves and your families. This recipe for Cabbage Stir Fry with Peas is right up there in my top ten EasyIndianFoods for those reasons\u2026hope you enjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ixnt3w/easy_indian_food_cabbage_stir_fry_with_peas_bund/", "created_utc": 1740461964.0, "score": 9, "author": "shaktimaan21", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1ixnt3w/easy_indian_food_cabbage_stir_fry_with_peas_bund/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Wash the lentils and pulses. Soak them in water for 5 hours along with the almonds and cashews. \n\n2. For the marinade, add yoghurt to a bowl and add all the ingredients except the meat. Mix well and add the pieces of meat after to marinate well. Marinate for at least 4 hours.\n\n3. In a large pot, add the soaked mix, add 1 litre of water. Add 1 tsp of salt. Bring to a boil and turn heat down to low. Cook on low until the mix turns into a porridge stirring it occassionally.\n\n4. Preheat oven to 275F.

Cook until the onions are light brown. \n\n5. Add the meat and cook for 7-8 minutes. Add the herbs and chillies. Add water to cover the meat.

Mash it all again into a thick porridge for some elasticity on low heat.   \n\n10.

To a saucepan or a dutch oven on medium-medium high heat, add oil and ghee. Once oil is hot, add chillies and cook for a minute. Add onions and cook until golden brown.\n\n3. Add ginger garlic paste, coriander powder and stir together for a minute until the raw smell of the paste goes away. \n\n4. Add mutton and curry leaves, and turn down heat to low and on closed lid, cook for 5-7 minutes stirring it occasionally. \n\n5. Turn on the heat to medium-medium high, add chilli powder, sesame powder, 1 tablespoon garam masala, enough water to fully cover the meat, mix well and bring to a gentle boil then turn the heat down to low and gently simmer until the meat falls apart the bone or is tender which can take 1.5-2 hours depending on the cut. Adjust salt and heat after tasting whilst the mutton cooks if you need. \n\n6. After the mutton is cooked, add 0.5 tablespoons of garam masala, a handful of coriander leaves and a few mint leaves and cook for 3-5 mins and until you see oil floating. Turn off heat and garnish with coriander and lime juice.

It can be skipped as long as the meat is marinated at least over 12 hours) \n\n\n\nFor making rice:\n\n- Aged Basmati Rice - 700-750g (I used Guruji brand) \n- Water - 3L\n- Handful of coriander and mint leaves\n- Lemon juice - 1/2 of lemon (the recipe I followed calls for it but I don't think it's necessary)\n- Salt - 2.5 TBSP\n- Oil - 2 TBSP \n- Caraway seeds - 1 TSP\n- Cardamom Pods - 6\n- Cloves - 5\n- Cinnamon sticks - 3 \n- Mace - 2-4 strands, Bay Leaf - 2, 2 star anise (in my opinion, these can be optional but they add great flavour and the star anise is great for fragrance)\n\n\n\nFor layering:\n\n\n- Some coriander and mint leaves\n- Saffron milk (10-15 strands in steeped in 120ml warm milk for 15-20mins)\n- 140ml of Ghee \n- 5 green chillies \n- 200g of fried onions \n- 2 tsp of garam masala powder \n\n\nProcess:\n\n\nFor marination:\n\n\n1. Mix in all the powdered, whole spices, meat tenderiser, salt with the yoghurt and ginger garlic paste in a large bowl thoroughly. \n\n2. Add the meat and marinate it well. Add in the remaining ingredients and marinate well. Leave the meat in the fridge for at least 12 hours if not 24 hours. \n\n\n\nWhen you're ready to cook:\n\n\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350F. In an enameled dutch oven, layer all the marinated meat as evenly as possible with larger chunks at the bottom. \n\n\n\nTo cook the rice and also assembling:\n\nWash the rice until it's clear under cold water and let it soak for an 45mins-1 hour. \n\n1. Bring the water to a gentle boil and add in all the ingredients except the rice. \n\n2. Let it all boil for at least 5 mins to release the aromas. Add the rice gently and let it boil for 2 mins. \n\n3. Gently layer half of the cooked rice in an even layer over the meat. Add/pour in half of the ingredients for layering all over the rice. Sprinkle 1 tsp of garam masala on top.  \n\n4. Let the remaining rice boil gently for another 2-2.5 mins and layer it evenly over the first layer. \n\n5. Add in the remaining layering ingredients evenly over the rice the same way as before for the second layer. \n\n6. Cover the top of the pot fully with aluminium foil and close the lid. \n\n7. Bake at 350F for 45 mins, then lower the temp to 300F and bake for another 50-60 minutes. Let the pot cool on the countertop for 15 mins before opening. Enjoy! \n\n\nFor cooking on stovetop:\n1. Place the cooking pot on high heat and cook for 2 mins. Then on low heat for 5 mins. \n2. On a heavy bottom pan, place the pot and cook on high heat for 5 mins. Then on low again for 45 mins. \n\n\nThis was my second attempt at making mutton biryani and this one turned really well than the last. I highly suggest to taste the water before adding the rice to check for salt. It should be slightly saltier than a good soup. If the rice is not salted well, the dish won't taste like much. You can use the same recipe for chicken thighs too but it won't take nearly as long (around 70 mins in the oven at 375F I'd say) and instead of 2 layers of rice, just 1 layer after boiling the rice for 3-4 minutes is enough. Hope this helps someone like it did for me! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/a825tgq\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1irz7ip/foolproof_recipe_for_hyderabadi_mutton_biryani/", "created_utc": 1739837469.0, "score": 45, "author": "MuttonMonger", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1irz7ip/foolproof_recipe_for_hyderabadi_mutton_biryani/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I [took a picture](https://imgur.com/a/RL7z8w4) of the blend and I am hoping someone will help me identify the ingredients so that I can make it at home (or where to buy it if you recognize it!!).\n\nI love this particular blend because it is more perfume-y than others I've tasted.  I know there are coconut cubes and different kinds of fennel in it, but I also taste licorice, lavender (or something floral?) along with a bunch of other wonderful flavors.

{"title": "South Indian Idli and dosa - general purpose batter", "selftext": "South Indian here.  Commented on a thread and felt this could be useful for someone trying to make idly and dosa.\n\nHere is what my wife does for good idli's, at least from my perspective. Note rava idli is different, this is just for plain soft idlis and dosas. For crispier dosas, rice needs to be even more, but we mostly make this as a general purpose batter.\n\n1. I use 5 cups idli rice (It is a specific [short grain parboiled rice](https://amzn.to/40ubfVI) you can get it in Indian stores if in US, and all stores in south India. Not sure about north India) + 1 cup whole [whole urad dal ](https://amzn.to/4hcFlEo)without skin + 1 tbsp [fenugreek](https://amzn.to/40Sl7Kv). You will not get same results with other rice which are mostly long grain.\n2. Grind fenugreek first, then urad dal until fluffy and fine textured. Urad dal will absorb water and become airy and increase in quantity when ground. If it does not, it is not good quality. Remove it to container.\n3. Then grind rice (order is important, note grinding rice second). Once done remove it to the same container with urad and fenugreek. Add salt to taste. Mix well and store it at room temperature (basically need 27c or more, 80 f). If in cooler climates like most of US, keep it in the oven with the oven light on. Leave it overnight so it ferments and rises by 50% or more\n4. Next morning, mix batter well. The first day batter is best for idly. The subsequent days are better for dosas, even though you can use it for both all days.\n5. You can twist the recipe a bit, by replacing 1 portion rice with other ancient grains if you prefer, which is what we are doing as we grow older and health conscious, trying to add more nutrition to idlis which are already a healthy no oil steamed food as-is. But these hybrid idli's are not as favored by the kids.\n6. Grinder - we used to have a wet grinder, but realized the ones we get in US are not great. They also go bad quickly, fail easily etc. Started using [blenders](https://amzn.to/3WE3L18) and we like them. Only issue is the urad dal does not increase in quantity as much, does not get very airy like in wet grinder. But does not change taste and texture much after fermentation rise. Many are less than USD 100 and we can replace them easily. Our has been in service for 3 years so far with no issues. The wet grinder we have is just a relic at this point.\n\nEdit 1: Soak rice, urad dal, fenugreek seed separately in water for 4 - 6 hours. I do it separate, seems urad and fenugreek together is fine. Grind fenugreek first, urad second in the same go. Grind rice separate\n\nEdit 2: Post grinding, the quantity of fluffy urad is same as the quantity of rice. That is how much the urad will fluff up (5 times appox)\n\nEdit 3: Fermentation will double the quantity, and once you mix it up it will fall flat after releasing air. Store in fridge after that. Mind you, I have had it spill over the container into my oven many times during fermentation overnight.

{"title": "How can I get my pulau rice right? Instant Pot vs normal pressure cooker?", "selftext": "Hello :)\n\nI am very new to cooking (only started like 1 month ago), started learning it because of being inspired by Indian food, so decided that I want to be able to make it myself.\n\nThe curries I do etc. come out alright. Still a long way to go but so far I am very happy with the results.\n\nBut the rice though, something that is probably supposed to be so simple, never comes right in terms of texture.\n\nI have Instant Pot (actually I have two) and I prefer cooking everything in Instant Pot if possible.\n\nThe way I make pulau rice is:\n\nFirst I measure 2 cups of rice (I always use basmati rice), wash it in a pot for 5-10 times... After that cover it with water and let it soak for 25-30 minutes. Then drain the water obviously.\n\nWhen it's all ready, I turn on the saute mode in my Instant Pot, wait for a minute or two, add a generous amount of sunflower oil, wait for the oil to get hot, put the whole spices (cumin, cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, black pepper)... Later I add 1 big chopped onion... green chillies... frozen vegetables.... rice.... ground spices... about 3 cups of water, maybe a bit less.. taste, adjust the salt... stir it all well...\n\nPressure cook on high pressure for 5 minutes (Keep Warm option is Off). When done, I leave it on natural pressure release for \\~15 min, release the remaining pressure... And after that I move the rice into another pot to make sure it doesn't keep being cooked in the hot pot... Well, actually I am following the recipes for making Pulau rice in Instant Pot here, so I would expect it to work well but it doesn't :\\\\\n\nThe rice comes out OK in terms of taste... But the texture is not right... I mean, it's not too bad, but the lower layers of rice look quite compressed and sticky... If I add less water, it can also burn a bit on the bottom which is not ideal either, but even in that case I think the texture wasn't that good.\n\nLike, if I compare my Pulau rice to that in an Indian restaurant... Every grain is separating nicely... It looks so perfect... I will attach the photos of mine here :\\\\\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/QmZN1BJDZxUTZoAK7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QmZN1BJDZxUTZoAK7)\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/bvrSutmWq71PkxSs5](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bvrSutmWq71PkxSs5)\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLd6QDrQdfdciUnz7](https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLd6QDrQdfdciUnz7)\n\n[https://photos.app.goo.gl/f4viDHpttdFkYVFVA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f4viDHpttdFkYVFVA)\n\n  \nThe first two pictures were made yesterday. I was talking to my Peruvian friend and shared the photos with her. She started laughing at my rice, saying she can count separate grains in her rice, while she would count my rice in \"balls\" rather than grains \ud83d\ude01 Well, she was just joking but it hurt \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI have an Indian friend online and I would ask her for any advices but she uses normal pressure cooker, just like some other Indian friends I have, so they would probably have no experience with Instant Pot anyway. I am now wondering if it's worth for me to buy a normal pressure cooker as well, so I could follow their suggestions and be more consistent for rice, and use Instant Pot for everything else? :\\\\\n\nAny advices?......... :(\n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1ibzjv7/how_can_i_get_my_pulau_rice_right_instant_pot_vs/", "created_utc": 1738063984.0, "score": 5, "author": "heitian_boyi", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1ibzjv7/how_can_i_get_my_pulau_rice_right_instant_pot_vs/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This curry was bright yellow, barely orange, not the vibrant red I remember butter chicken being. It tasted good but it made most of my roomies very sick for many days because of how oniony it is. They\u2019ve never had this reaction to any Indian food before. \n\nI repeatedly asked if/what spices we needed when planning/shopping and he just said \u201cbutter chicken spices\u201d even when I asked him to specify individual spices.

{"title": "Vegan Butter Tofu", "selftext": "[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/creamy-vegan-butter-tofu)\n\n\nRecipe:\nIngredients  \n\nFor the tofu:\n- 400g firm tofu, pressed and cut into cubes  \n- 2 tbsp cornflour  \n- 1 tsp turmeric powder  \n- 1/2 tsp salt  \n- 2 tbsp vegetable oil (for frying)  \n\nFor the sauce:\n- 2 tbsp vegan butter (or coconut oil)  \n- 1 large onion, finely chopped  \n- 3 garlic cloves, minced  \n- 1 tbsp grated ginger  \n- 1 tsp cumin seeds  \n- 1 tsp ground coriander  \n- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder  \n- 1 tsp garam masala  \n- 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi), crushed  \n- 400g canned chopped tomatoes  \n- 100g cashews, soaked in hot water for 20 minutes  \n- 200ml coconut milk  \n- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)  \n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  \n\nFor serving:\n- 300g basmati rice  \n- Fresh coriander, chopped, for garnish  \n\nMethod:\n1. Press the tofu by placing it between clean kitchen towels and a heavy object for 15-20 minutes to remove excess moisture. Once pressed, cut the tofu into even cubes. Toss the cubes with cornflour, turmeric, and salt in a bowl until evenly coated.  \n\n2. Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the tofu cubes for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden and crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside.  \n\n3. In a large saucepan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for 30 seconds. Stir in the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for 4-5 minutes until golden and softened.  \n\n4. Add the garlic and ginger, cooking for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Stir in the ground coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and fenugreek leaves. Cook for another minute to toast the spices.  \n\n5. Add the chopped tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Blend the soaked cashews with 1/4 cup of water until smooth, then add the cashew cream and coconut milk to the sauce. Stir well and let it simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce thickens and becomes creamy.  \n\n6. Season the sauce with salt, black pepper, and sugar (if using). Add the fried tofu cubes and gently stir to coat them in the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes to heat through.  \n\n7. Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a saucepan, combine the rice with 600ml of water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and let simmer for 12-15 minutes until tender. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork.  \n\n8. Serve the Vegan Butter Tofu over the cooked basmati rice. Garnish with freshly chopped coriander and enjoy!  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1i9rvhp/vegan_butter_tofu/", "created_utc": 1737825628.0, "score": 32, "author": "Whiterabbit2000", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1i9rvhp/vegan_butter_tofu/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "The easiest way to make rice that I picked up recently and has been a game changer. ", "selftext": "Growing up, my mom made rice in a pressure cooker. Due to a variety of reasons and experiences that both my mom and I had, I don't think pressure cooker is a great way to make rice. It is very easy to mess up and make the rice too mushy or hard and borderline uncooked. Sometimes the rice would even be scorched and stick to the bottom.\n\nThe other common way to make rice was to simply boil the rice like how you boil an egg and just drain the water off. This would be foolproof but would end up in having one more dish to wash (colander or strainer).\n\nThis new method of mine is actually from the book 'Masala Lab: The Science of Indian Cooking'. It's quite simple and results in rice that's exactly the way I like.\n\n1. Put however much rice you want into a pot. Wash it a few times.\n2. Fill it with just enough water so that your first crease in your index finger will be submerged (distal interphalangeal crease).\n3. Keep the stove at max heat and wait until the water begins to boil.\n4. Keep the stove to the least heat level, put a lid on and set a timer for about 15 mins.\n5. Take it off the stove, fluff the rice and if you notice some water still left at the bottom, just keep it aside for some more time. The rice will absorb the water.\n6. You now have rice cooked to perfection.\n\nWhat I like about this is that I don't have to constantly check if it's done or count the number of whistles. I can just set a timer on my watch and come back later.\n\nI'm not saying this is a very novel method; it is just new for me. This finger trick has been used by women in families for ages but the book actually goes into the science behind why that works, and why rice:water ratio doesn't scale up in bulk quantities.\n\nEdit: for the people saying 'rice cookers exist', I get it. It may be a common thing in the West but as an Indian, I have never seen it in any Indian kitchen I've been to. It is not at all common in Asia to have one.

Is there any secret to making chai with fiery spice flavors other than just increasing the amount of spice? Most recipes call for sliced ginger, would it be better to chop it?

How can we\u00a0pride ourselves on cultural richness\u00a0while\u00a0ostracizing a child for eating something that is a part of his culture?\n\nWe cannot claim to be a diverse nation\u00a0only when it suits us.\u00a0True diversity means\u00a0embracing differences, not punishing them.\n\nIf we, as a society,\u00a0do not challenge\u00a0this\u00a0narrow-mindedness, what kind of future are we shaping for our children?\n\nThis is not just about one school. It\u2019s about a much\u00a0larger conversation\u2014Do we really practice the inclusivity we preach?\n\nLet\u2019s talk.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/comments/1i55gki/does_indian_food_mean_vegetarian_food/", "created_utc": 1737311910.0, "score": 0, "author": "iMarcoPolo007", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/IndianFood/comments/1i55gki/does_indian_food_mean_vegetarian_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
