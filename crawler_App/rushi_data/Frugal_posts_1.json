{"title": "[Reminder] Amazon Day is a marketing event, not a deal day.", "selftext": "For those who are unaware, Amazon has been doing Prime Day, a day where they claim to have the most amount of deals for 2 years now. However, research, consumer sentiment, analysts are able to show that Prime Day is more about getting users to sign up for Prime and marketing the brand, than it is about providing deals to existing customers.\n\nI strongly recommend you use a historical price checker like CCC or Keepa to actually verify the prices are lower, as it is a common tactic to raise prices before a sale and then trick customers into feeling like they got a deal with a large % drop, like 50% off. Also keep in mind many sites will be pushing the event despite lackluster deals, because they want people to come to their site to see the aggregated 'deals' (getting ad revenue), and some of them will be linking to Amazon for that sweet affiliate money on anything you buy.\n\nHere are the stats:\n\n    Comparing black friday prices to Amazon day:\n    BF Prices for Laptops were 5% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Small Appliances were 3% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Tablets were 7% cheaper\n    BF Prices for TVs were 15% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Video Games were 12%\n    On average prices were 9% lower on BF than prime day.\n    Of 450 best-sellers, only 43 were discounted 10% or more on primeday\n    Adobe's social media tracker found 50% of shoppers were disappointed, 23% felt joy\n    Last year, our staff scanned nearly 8,000 deals and found only 64 worth posting.\n\n\nI would post the numerous links but last time my post was immediately removed (im assuming due to links), I can provide them (hopefully) in the comments if requested.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/6mifa9/reminder_amazon_day_is_a_marketing_event_not_a/", "created_utc": 1499730249.0, "score": 14898, "author": "Put_It_All_On_Blck", "num_comments": 1029, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/6mifa9/reminder_amazon_day_is_a_marketing_event_not_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Got laid off, so I went all-in on living frugally. Here's what I did.", "selftext": "Strap in, it's gonna be a long one.\n\nIn January of 2024, my second daughter was born.  Unfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my paternity leave of just 4 weeks, my company laid me off with an okay severance package (2 months of pay).  I decided during this time that after 10 years of 55+ hour weeks, I wanted a better work-life balance -- especially now that I have a second child.\n\nUnfortunately, I had not anticipated how insane the job market was, so after hundreds of job applications, 20+ interviews, 10+ interview project assignments, and getting to the final round 5 times, I still couldn't find a job going brand-side.  I had to make a pivotal decision -- go back to agency world where I'll likely burn out sooner or later, or attempt to forge my own path with my own clients.  I decided spending time with my family was more important than a bigger paycheck, so I decided to start off on my own consulting/freelancing.\n\nOf course, this meant that cash flow would limited for a while until I was able to build out my client base, so I set off reducing my recurring expenses as much as possible.\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nNetflix|Monthly|$17.99|$17.99|$215.88\nCrunchyroll|Annual|$79.99|$6.67|$79.99\nAmazon Prime|Annual|$139.00|$11.58|$139.00\nOn Demand Korea|Annual|$139.99|$11.67|$139.99\nYoutube Premium|Monthly|$22.99|$22.99|$275.88\nSpotify|Monthly|$19.99|$19.99\t|$239.88\nT-Mobile|Monthly\t|$100.00\t|$100.00\t|$1,200.00\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nLastPass\t|Monthly\t|$4.00\t|$4.00\t|$48.00\nChase Sapphire Reserve\t|Annual\t|$550.00\t|$45.83\t|$550.00\n\nThe above came out to $242.38/month or $2,908.61 annually.  I then cut out as much as I could then replaced the more expensive services with cheaper ones.\n\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nStremio + RD\t|Annual\t|$34.54\t|$2.88\t|$34.54\nOn Demand Korea\t|Annual\t|$139.99\t|$11.67\t|$139.99\nYoutube Premium\t|Monthly\t|$22.99\t|$22.99\t|$275.88\t\t\t\nMint Mobile\t|Annual\t|409.28\t|$34.11\t|$409.28\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nBitwarden\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\nAAA Daily Advantage\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\n\nThe new recurring costs came out to $73.31/month or $879.68 annually.\n\n* Netflix, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime were replaced with Stremio + Real-Debrid (note: this may be a controversial move for some, but I'll be honest -- with the ever increasing subscription prices, I don't feel too bad about going the Stremio + RD route until I get back on my feet).  \n* On Demand Korea was kept because my tech illiterate mother (who lives separately) has no idea how to operate anything other than a remote control to select a show and press play.\n\n* YouTube Premium was kept if only to make sure my older child does not get exposed to random ads on her approved-only content kids profile.  But additionally, utilizing YouTube Music allowed me to get rid of Spotify.  Not gonna lie, I love Spotify's algorithm for discovering new music much better, but YouTube Music works.  Not to mention that since I work with ads as my career, I'd rather not see more ads in my personal life, and about half the content I consume is on YouTube.\n\n* For Amazon Prime delivery, not having the instant 1-day shipping (because we would need to build up a minimum amount to get free delivery now) actually helped reduce monthly Amazon purchases.  I used to spend, on average, about $100/month on random crap.  Now it's closer to $30/month, and that's mostly essential supplies for the kiddos.\n\n* T-Mobile was a big one.  Since my wife and I both work from home, we hardly used any data.  With Mint Mobile, not only do I get more data to use monthly, it's also significantly cheaper with no noticeable reduction in service quality (YMMV).\n\n* I used to pay for LastPass Family, but after using Bitwarden for a while, I wonder why I didn't swap sooner.  It has basically the same functions as the LastPass Family plan to share passwords with family, but Bitwarden is not only free, but they have a much better track record of not getting hacked.\n\n* Finally, I used to have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card as I used to travel a bit more often.  Now that that will be out of the picture for at least a year or so, I've gotten a free card that pays a higher cash back bonus on my highest spending category -- Costco (3% back on Costco with 5% back on groceries, which includes Walmart).  Also, as I now eat out or DoorDash much less frequently, I was not building up points efficiently on the CSR, so it didn't make sense to keep it.\n\nOther things I did to reduce costs:\n\n* Learn how to bake -- I used to buy cookies and baked goods from Costco pretty much every trip I made (every 2 weeks or so), but now I buy 0.  Instead, I am now baking all the sweet treats that my family wants.  Not only can I now get exactly what I want in the quantity that I want it, it is far, far cheaper (and tastier now that I have a bit more experience baking).  This is easily $30/month in savings.\n\n* Learn how to cook my favorite take-out meals -- burritos, burgers, beef & bean chili, chicken noodle soup, etc.  The only time I ever order take-out now is for the party packs at McDonald's if I'm too tired to cook (once a month max), and maybe a Costco pizza.  Thankfully, I'm not a pizza snob, so I can live with cheap pizza.  This is easily $100/month in savings.\n\n* Start a garden in my backyard -- only did this for 1 year so far, and we were able to replace some of the veggies we buy with the garden.  That said, we started off small, so we probably only saved about $50 bucks of food in the end, which was about how much spent on seeds and equipment.  We are definitely going much bigger this year (2x what we had previously) with proper equipment, so hopefully we can grow much more as we develop our green thumb.  Negligible savings so far, but I'm hoping it'll be in the $100s in savings this year.\n\n* Apply for state help on health insurance costs -- while working at my agency, I had my entire family on my premium health insurance plan, which cost $1,600/month to cover everyone.  But now that my earnings are significantly reduced, my entire family gets health insurance completely for free.  With this cheaper health plan, even if my earnings go up significantly and I pay full price for the insurance, it'll only come out to $950/month.  That is $650/month in savings right there.  Perhaps this isn't the best long-term move because there can be problems with cheaper healthcare, but for now, as I am still \"young\", it will suffice.\n\nAll in, I am saving the following:\n\nItem\t|Old Monthly Cost\t|New Monthly Cost\t|Total Monthly Savings\t|Total Annual Savings\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:\nSubscription Services\t|$242.38\t|$73.31\t|$169.08\t|$2,028.93\nAmazon shopping\t|$100.00\t|$30.00\t|$70.00\t|$840.00\nBaked goods\t|$35.00\t|$5.00\t|$30.00\t|$360.00\nTake-out\t|$150.00\t|$35.00\t|$115.00\t|$1380.00\nHealth Insurance\t|$1,600.00\t|$950.00\t|$650.00\t|$7,800.00\nTotal\t|$2,127.38\t|$1,093.31\t|$1034.08\t|$12,408.93\n\nIf you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read through this.  I hope this will give someone some ideas on how they can cut out extraneous expenses from their lives.  Given how the economy is moving, many of us may need these tips sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat are some other things you have done to reduce your recurring costs?  I'd love to try to minimize my costs even further if I can.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1j58b0q/got_laid_off_so_i_went_allin_on_living_frugally/", "created_utc": 1741300784.0, "score": 12326, "author": "quokkabee", "num_comments": 638, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1j58b0q/got_laid_off_so_i_went_allin_on_living_frugally/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My wife and I have discovered that churning meal kits has been cheaper than groceries", "selftext": "Recently it has become more difficult for me and my wife to fit grocery shopping into our schedules with our jobs and two young kids. We decided to try some meal kits in order to still eat home cooked meals without having to spend a lot of time preparing lists and wandering grocery isles. Most companies have very attractive trial codes for 75-80% off your first delivery. So we tried that and really liked the experience. But after a few weeks the cost keeps rising up to full price and we determined that it just wasn't in the budget to do it every week.\n\nWe cancelled, thinking that we would come back maybe when they had another deal available or maybe try a different company. Well it didn't take long for a \"come back\" code to appear in my email inbox. Less than a week. So we bought another delivery at a similar extreme discount of 80%. As an experiment I decided to cancel immediately after being charged for the next box and guess what? Yep, another \"come back\" code arrived. This time via a mailed postcard.\n\nOver the last 6 months I have bounced between two different meal kit services and I have not paid more than $3 per meal since September. As long as you cancel your subscription after each payment they will be begging you to come back within 2 weeks. I'm sure if you were really dedicated you could churn 3 or 4 different meal kits for the maximum savings. Our best streak was after the new year where we got 4 boxes in a row for $1 per meal. There is no way we could afford to buy groceries that cheap. And the meals have been great! I didn't want anyone to think this was an advertisement for a specific service, so I won't name any here. I'm very curious to find out how long I can keep this going, but so far it has been great. We only go to a small local grocer now for milk, butter, and other basics. Accounting for inflation, our total grocery budget has actually gone down despite eating better and saving time.\n\nEDIT: Since making this post I have received another discount code for 75% off from one of our meal kit services.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/123nium/my_wife_and_i_have_discovered_that_churning_meal/", "created_utc": 1679925111.0, "score": 9105, "author": "x70x", "num_comments": 677, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/123nium/my_wife_and_i_have_discovered_that_churning_meal/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Food costs are out of control in the US.", "selftext": "My partner and I live a very frugal lifestyle in a relatively HCOL area, especially when it comes to food. I make almost everything we eat from scratch using clearance and bulk ingredients, including bread, condiments, etc. We're big fans of cold cut sandwiches for lunch, and we've been buying bone-in turkey breasts, holiday hams (after the holidays) and whole roaster chickens on sale for years, freezing them until needed and prepping our own cold cuts for lunches each week. Obviously inflation has hit everyone hard, us included, but making everything from scratch has shielded us somewhat... but it's been a long, difficult week, we were out of homemade cold cuts and I decided to buy some from the deli counter at a grocery store near us last night.\n\nI stupidly didn't check the per lb. cost, assuming it would be like, $3-4/lb like it was a few years ago\u2013 kind of expensive, but manageable. I got to the checkout and 2 lbs of normal, roast chicken deli meat from a normal grocery store cost TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. It was almost $12/lb. That's like the cost of 4+ entire homemade meals for us.\n\nBack to the old way, I guess... can't even cut a corner on something simple anymore. It's genuinely terrifying to know that buying too much DELI CHICKEN could be financially ruinous at this point. Where does it end?-\n\nEdit: Some additional thoughts.\n\nI am clearly not alone in this! This was just meant to be a \"vent\" post but clearly it's resonated. Thanks for all the helpful and supportive responses\u2013 I really hope that collectively, we can organize and DO something about the price gouging/\"inflation\" happening at the supplier and retailer level. A start is contacting your state and local governments and mentioning your concerns with rising food costs and food scarcity\u2013 look up retailers or manufacturers headquartered in your area and mention those retailers by name when contacting elected officials. And, if price gouging continues and worsens, we need to be collectively ready to organize and protest.\n\nThis post is getting way more attention than I expected, and I'm getting some kind of awful comments/messages. I don't know how to caveat this any more than I did in my original post, but I know prices are high for a lot more than just deli meat, and I know deli meat is a convenience food (i.e., higher price point in general), which is why I don't normally buy it. That being said, I don't think it's an extravagant luxury, and no one should feel shamed for buying something that makes their lives easier on occasion\u2013 you can be frugal with your time and sanity sometimes, too. I feel extremely lucky that a) I have the time and equipment needed to cook frugally from scratch and b) I'm only cooking for my partner and I in a dual-income household. Everyone commenting \"stop buying deli meat then\" \u2013 well, that's obviously my plan, but that's not really helpful commentary, it's not just deli meat, and families who rely on convenience foods shouldn't have to starve.\n\nFinal edit: The area we're located grew QUICKLY during and post-Covid when it was named \"one of the best places to live and work remote.\" Housing and food costs have risen dramatically, not to mention scarcity\u2013\u00a0my city made a number of \"largest COL increase\" lists the past couple of years (went from moderate to high, along with lots of other compounding factors) and my partner and I are indeed looking to move.

{"title": "My wife likes to get spray tans and bikini waxes before vacations. To save money, I bought the equipment and now I do both for her.", "selftext": "A few years ago, my wife came home from a Brazilian wax appointment and told me that she'd had a terrible experience. The wax was too hot, the technician (or whatever you call the waxer person) was grumpy, and a lot of hairs left behind. She said, \"Honestly, I bet you could have done it better!\" \n\nThat gave me an idea. \"You know, I bet you that I could.\"\n\nSo, I read some articles online, found the right supplies, we watched a few training videos together, and, long story short, she has never been back to another waxing salon.\n\nIt cost a couple hundred dollars for the right equipment and supplies to be able to perform each of these services, but neither was very hard to learn. It only took about 3 spray tans before I'd gotten really good at giving them. \n\nBrazilians were a bit more of a learning curve. I practiced waxing my own thighs for a couple of months before I attempted waxing her. I started with really small strips and the first few took forever, but now I can do one in about 25 minutes and she tells me that the results are better than any salon she ever went to.\n\nThe key for both services was purchasing professional quality equipment and supplies. I did a ton of research and tried a few different products before settling on what we found to work best.\n\nThe equipment paid for itself within 6 months. Now, each spray tan costs about $2.50 and a wax about $2-3.\n\nMy wife loves that I do them for her. She doesn't have to get naked for a stranger and she gets waxed consistently enough that it's far less painful qnd can keep a nice tan all summer with the perfect amount of color every time.\n\nDo I enjoy providing her these services to her? Yes, I absolutely do. My wife is beautiful and I love taking care of her. However, I would not do them for her if it had not been her idea to have me learn to do them for her.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nEdit: For those asking about supplies:\n\nI order waxing stuff from Honeycomb Wax Company and spray tan solution from MineTan. Both have starter kits available. The spray gun in the MineTan starter kit isn't great. We upgraded to a gently used Norvell m1000 a few months ago and it is much better. \n\nRule of thumb with equipment and supplies: You get what you pay for. As you are not paying for someone to do the application, spend up and get nice quality product (ie, professional products, not stuff from the drug store).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/18mjybg/my_wife_likes_to_get_spray_tans_and_bikini_waxes/", "created_utc": 1703040597.0, "score": 7833, "author": "JephriB", "num_comments": 597, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/18mjybg/my_wife_likes_to_get_spray_tans_and_bikini_waxes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "As a former Sears appliance technician, I take phenomenal care of my appliances and I\u2019ll never have to buy brand new. Here\u2019s why...", "selftext": "I worked for Sears appliance repair and have troubleshot most appliances around the house. I cannot count how many times I have heard customers complain about buying a pair of brand new washing machine/dryer sets and wishing they had their old set back. Not only this, but I\u2019ve picked up the tricks to making appliances last. After having worked on the newer ones vs older, used appliances, this is what I\u2019ve learned:\n\n1. DON\u2019T USE TOO MUCH SOAP!! People make this mistake all the time. Especially with washing your clothes, brands will sell you a detergent with the cap that has measurements on it. Never use these measurements. Even the lowest measurement is too much. If you are washing a normal sized load of laundry, all you need is 1 tablespoon of detergent. Yes, you read that correctly. Towels/blankets can use maybe 2 tablespoons. The reason for this is because most marketed detergents will have a little sticker on it that says \u201cHE\u201d. This means it is high efficiency, or in other words really really really really concentrated soap. 1 tablespoon of HE detergent is equal to about 1/4-1/2 cup of soap. If you were to add 1/2 cup of HE soap, it creates an over abundant amount of suds for your washer. Too many suds can cause balance displacement and mess up your suspension. If you have a washer that senses the moisture content of the clothes, the extra suds can cause your washer to work overtime to get rid of them. This causes the motor/shaft to wear out faster. The extra oil in the suds can also trickle down easier into the shaft and cause rust. Lastly, too much detergent will cause more mildew build up between the tub and basket of the washer.  \n\n2. That being said, never ever ever buy Tide Pods. They are expensive and will wreck your washer/dishwasher. Too much detergent.\n\n3. Never use dryer sheets. They will coat your lint trap with wax and ultimately cause house fires. \nAlso, get your dryer cleaned often! Lint doesn\u2019t always stick to the lint trap. It can escape and get into the heating element, causing it to light up into flames. Open up the dryer and vacuum out the lint, or use a wet rag to wipe it up.\n\n4. The salesman is quick to sell you on all the new gadgets, functions, and color of the appliance. DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM/HER! Say you are on the market for a washer/dryer. The big boy sets will have any function you want. It\u2019ll have crazy settings specifically for bedding, towels, whites, delicates, self cleaning. Looks awesome... but in fact this is pointless. If you go this route, you\u2019ll end up buying a brand new washer with 20 settings that you NEVER touch. Most people only use the Normal and Heavy setting on their washer, and trust me these 2 settings will wash your clothes just fine. Same with a dryer: most people only use sensing dry or timed dry. There is almost no practical use for any of the other settings when they do the exact same function as your most normal setting. \n\n5. The newer appliances combine plastic and metal moving parts, which cause the need for more repairs. The older appliances are made mostly of metal and last forever if you take care of them. I find that older people hang on to their appliances for longer and it always seems to have gone in their favor. I have worked on their 20+ year old washers and dryers they\u2019ve had since the 90s, and in my experience they wash/dry better than any new appliance on the market. Plus, over the duration of their life, they have had little to no repair needed on them. If you can get your hands on an old washer/dryer, I highly recommend it!\n\n6. Older appliances still have replacement parts on the market, and they are cheap. You can buy mostly anything you need to repair the machine with the exception of cosmetics (the outer shell, sometimes handles, main display and buttons).\n\n7. Take care of your appliance. Once a month you should be running a cleaner in your washer/dishwasher. Buy any cleaner at the store and you\u2019ll increase the longevity of the appliance just by doing this. \n\n8. Do not buy Samsung or LG appliances. They are terrible and made of mostly computers. If something breaks, that computer part will cost you an arm and a leg. Make sure to get a warranty if you really want this brand. \n\nThe only exception to not buying brand new would be a refrigerator. I would buy one brand new because every few years, they can change up the refrigerant used. The newer refrigerants are more environmentally friendly. Plus, if they can stay colder for longer, you can save electricity from it having to run the compressor as long. \n\nOverall, following these steps will save so much money in the long run it\u2019s not even funny. Using less soap will ensure your clothes still get clean, but literally double the life you get out of a bottle of detergent.\n\nEDIT: I should mention;  if you have high efficiency washers, then using HE detergent at its proper measurements is generally okay. HE washers use less water and the concentration of the detergent is meant for this purpose. Although, I would still use a tad bit less than recommended. \n\nFIRE WARNING\u2014 the dryer sheets themselves do not cause fires. The wax from your dryer sheets sticks to the lint trap. When the wax has built up over time and the trap no longer catches the lint, that lint has to go somewhere. It will escape through any crease it finds. The lint shoots into the open cabin of the dryer, touching the heating element. Lint is EXTREMELY flammable. The heating element will light it on fire and any other lint in the dryer. This is how house fires are cause by dryers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/j05ioi/as_a_former_sears_appliance_technician_i_take/", "created_utc": 1601124804.0, "score": 7265, "author": "Mr-Ravi0li", "num_comments": 780, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/j05ioi/as_a_former_sears_appliance_technician_i_take/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "PSA: Bedbugs are insanely expensive to deal with and frankly traumatizing to live with. Here are some tips.", "selftext": "A few years ago my wife and I lived in an apartment that got bedbugs. A lot of this might seem excessive or crazy but trust me you don't want to chance this stuff.\n\n1. Whenever you come home from someone's apartment or a hotel stay, immediately put all fabrics (clothes, luggage, sleeping bags) into the **dryer**. Even if you can't see any bugs, the eggs are too small to see and can live in fabrics for up to a year. \n\n2. If you have an expensive mattress, get a bedbug liner. My wife and I had to throw out a 6 month old $1,200 mattress because we didn't spend $25 on a cover. It's really not worth trying to salvage the mattress once its infested, even if you kill all the live bugs you still need to worry about eggs.\n\n3. Don't waste your money on \"natural\" products to kill bed bugs. We tried several and they were straight up ineffective. Rather than buying products that are safe for pets, just buy products that actually work and keep your pets away from the affected areas until you've cleaned up. \n\n4. If you're going to buy furniture off craigslist (which I will no longer do) try to avoid apartments. No this isn't a stereotype against low income people, the problem is that it's basically impossible to clear a building of bedbugs unless the whole building is treated. Most apartment complexes will try to treat on a unit-by-unit basis which just doesn't work. In addition the risk of re-infestation is high because a lot of infestations start by people bringing bugs home from school or work. More people = higher probability of bedbugs.\n\n5. Do not let your landlord try to bully you into keeping a security deposit if you are leaving a place that is infested with bedbugs. We had this happen since we didn't try and salvage their wall to wall carpet. They tried to charge us $500 plus our deposit to fix the carpet. Eventually it ended up in collections but after providing state mandated guidelines on dealing with bedbug infested apartments, they backed off, gave the deposit back, and it never ended up on our credit report.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/drodiu/psa_bedbugs_are_insanely_expensive_to_deal_with/", "created_utc": 1572902331.0, "score": 6786, "author": "lUNITl", "num_comments": 637, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/drodiu/psa_bedbugs_are_insanely_expensive_to_deal_with/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Had to call them up to get a refund, and they were gaslighting me saying maybe I had restarted without being aware (zilch chance of that I don't have time to watch it or interest) or that someone has my password (again zilch chance of that as I'm the only user of my laptop and I had changed my password already when canceling in May). \n\nT-mobile has been even worse. My mom was going abroad for a few weeks and she asked me to add an extra line to my account as they have good international coverage. Turns out instead of adding a single extra line, which I directly and clearly and empathically requested of them despite their INSISTENT sales pitch that I had more \"free\" lines they added **4 extra lines to my account** . When she returned, I had all the lines canceled except my own. Or so I thought. Turns out that t-mobile canceled only 3 of the extra lines and kept an additional on my account. I was paying $147 per month for months due to that extra line, when I should have been paying $50.

{"title": "Ordering takeout or delivery directly from the restaurant is 15% cheaper on average than ordering from 3rd party delivery apps", "selftext": "You are probably wasting money on 3rd party delivery apps for the same food and service you can get from the restaurant directly.\n\nThe 3rd party delivery apps such as DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub charge several kinds of fees on top of the original food price. Specifically, they charge the following for a delivery order:\n\n1. The price of the menu items - for many restaurants, this price is not the original price on their own menus. There can be inflated menu price, as much as 20% higher.\n2. The service fee - 15% of the food price (including the inflated price). Uber Eats caps the service fee at $5 max (and $2.50 min), DoorDash and Grubhub have no cap.\n3. The delivery fee - depending on the distance, different platforms charge different delivery fees. DoorDash charges $2.99 - $6.99, Uber Eats $0.49 - $3.99, Grubhub $1.99 - $5.99.\n4. Other fees - for example, the \"CA driver benefits\" is a fee charged by some of the 3rd party delivery companies in California because the driver's payment is higher in CA. Uber Eats charges $2.00, Grubhub charges $2.00 - $4.00 depending on the distance, DoorDash doesn't charge this fee.\n\nConsidering all these together, guess how much you would pay for a $50 family meal? Let's assume the inflated menu price is +10%, and you are at the max distance of the delivery radius.  \n\\- DoorDash: $50\\*110%\\*115%+$6.99 = $70.24  \n\\- UberEats: $50\\*110%+$5+$3.99+$2 = $65.99  \n\\- Grubhub: $50\\*110%\\*115%+$5.99+$4.00 = $73.24\n\nThat's too much, isn't it? And guess how much you would pay for the same meal if ordering directly from the restaurant? It depends on which online ordering company the restaurant partners with. But most of the time, the restaurant doesn't charge any service fees, and never has inflated menu prices. So you would always pay the original price with some delivery fees. The delivery fee sometimes can be a little bit higher than the 3rd parties, but the overall price is much lower. Take the same $50 meal example, most likely you would only pay$50+$7 = $57where the $7 is the delivery fee if the restaurant uses ChowNow.\n\nNow you know that the price difference can be HUGE between the restaurant's own channel and 3rd party delivery apps. In addition, the restaurant pays 25%-30% commission per order if you place the order through 3rd party delivery apps. The restaurant loses money definitely if all orders go through the 3rd party apps.\n\nSo, if you ever want to order takeout or delivery, please consider placing the orders through the restaurant's own channel. You can go to the restaurant's website, for they usually put a link there to let you place the order online. I know it is a bit inconvenient, but it saves a lot of money for yourself and the restaurants you like. Also, there are some websites that are trying to make it easy for people to order directly from the restaurants, such as Hyperflyer. On that website, you can compare the prices of multiple delivery services side-by-side and see how much you can save if ordering through the cheapest one (most of the time, the restaurant's own channel). It has the links directing you to the ordering websites of the restaurants, so you don't have to search each restaurant's website by yourself.\n\nOf course, it's all up to you to decide how to order food online, but I think you should at least know the numbers and consider before you make the decision.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/lwf6ko/ordering_takeout_or_delivery_directly_from_the/", "created_utc": 1614726620.0, "score": 5915, "author": "fyaoyh1028", "num_comments": 403, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/lwf6ko/ordering_takeout_or_delivery_directly_from_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I garden and cook a lot. One of the coolest things I've learned combining these interests is how much edible stuff you can grow from grocery store leftovers. This is a list of 12 useful herbs and veggies I have personally grown from grocery store scraps/seeds, so I know they work.", "selftext": "But don't let this list limit you. The ultimate moral here is most food scrap seeds and fresh cuttings can be planted or cloned. In hindsight, I feel like that should be an obvious statement, but it's really not in the modern day. It kind of blew my mind how much of the stuff you buy at the grocery store can be planted for fun and profit when I first started to get into gardening. \n\nAnd just FYI, cloning plants is far more difficult with some plant species than internet articles describing how to clone them make out. Most internet articles act like you can clone anything if you just put a cutting in a cup of water. In practice, only some types of plants actually clone that way reliably. You kind of have to develop a technique for each. Biggest universal principle I've learned is that the area you want to take root should be kept in the dark as much as possible. That usually means putting some kind of collar (e.g. peat moss or rockwool) around the stem and putting it in an opaque and covered container with water so only the top half of the plant with the leaves gets light.\n\n**Grocery store stuff I've grown plants from:**\n\n1.\tPinto beans \u2013 Grown from a bag of dried Goya pinto beans. Just plant the beans like you would from a seed packet. They sprouted in a few days. I assume it would work with other varieties of bean, but pinto are the only ones I\u2019ve tried.\n\n2.\tBasil \u2013 Can be cloned from fresh herb cuttings bought in the produce aisle. Clones quite easily in just a glass of water. I\u2019ve had roots pop in a literally just two days with rooting hormone added (a virtually unlimited supply can be bought for about $5 on the internet), though it tends to vary a lot based on the quality of the cutting.\n\n3.\tPeppers \u2013 Seeds inside fresh peppers generally sprout as easily as garden store seeds. You might have less luck with green bell peppers and jalapenos since they\u2019re picked when not ripe though. I\u2019ve successfully grown habaneros, cherry peppers, sweet peppers, and long finger peppers from grocery store seeds.\n\n4.\tMint \u2013 Can be cloned from cuttings. Try to use the less woody stems, as they\u2019ll be more likely to root. I found mint moderately difficult to clone. I took 5 cuttings. 2 rooted, but only 1 survived. Once you have a healthy plant, it\u2019s easy to transfer it to another container by burying the runners in the new container.\n\n5.\tRosemary \u2013 Can be cloned from cuttings. Rosemary is pretty difficult to clone. I took 10 cuttings and only 1 survived. It took about 1-2 months to root too. I\u2019d probably buy an aeroponic cloner if I was going to try clone more of this. You get better results when the part of the stem you\u2019re trying to root is kept in the dark. I did this to an extent with rockwool collars, but it\u2019s still a race for the plant to root before the leaves and stem start to rot.\n\n6.\tBlueberries \u2013 I\u2019ve grown blueberry plants from frozen aisle blueberries. If you have fresh blueberries you\u2019ll want to stratify the seeds by keeping them in the freezer for 60 days to simulate winter. You can skip this with frozen blueberries though. Keep in mind growing blueberries from seed takes a while. The plants are pretty easy to take care of once sprouted. Only real caveats are use acidic soil and keep it moist at all times. They\u2019ll have to grow for about 2 years before they start producing berries, and they won\u2019t get up to full rate production for 3-5 years.\n\n7.\tGarlic \u2013 You can plant whole cloves. Put them about an inch deep in the soil, skin on, pointy side up and water when soil is dry. They\u2019ll sprout in a week or two under ideal conditions. You can harvest them after they\u2019ve grown for about a month for \u201cgreen garlic\u201d which looks and is used like green onions, but has a more garlicky taste (though milder than regular garlic). You can also just let them grow into bulbs. If you do that you\u2019ll want to plant them in the fall, let them go through winter and then harvest in the next summer.\n\n8.\tGreen onions \u2013 The white ends can be planted if you leave the little root nubs on. I usually leave about an inch of the white part on what I\u2019m cutting. The more white you leave the higher the chance of success and give you a more robust plant (though the success rate is very high regardless).\n\n9.\tCarrots \u2013 Carrot plants can be grown by planting the fat end of a carrot. Plant the flat side down and the round end up, with the round end sticking slightly out of the soil. I should note, while I\u2019ve successfully grown carrot plants like this, I\u2019ve never gotten a full-sized carrot from doing it. I presume it\u2019s possible, but clones grown in this way don\u2019t always have the same potential as growing from seed.\n\n10.\tRomaine lettuce ends \u2013 Put the end of the romaine head in a glass of water and new leaves will sprout up. Note that when you do this you\u2019re never going to get a full head out of it (at least I never have) the way you would with seed. It\u2019ll get about half-sized and then bolt. What I do is save the ends in the fridge until I have like 6 and then plant them all at once. When each have about 6-8 decent-sized leaves I\u2019ll harvest them and combine into a single salad. The lettuce will taste sweeter than mature lettuce because it will all be young.\n\n11.\tTomatoes \u2013 Seeds from store bought tomatoes can be grown. Keep in mind most store bought tomatoes are F1 hybrids (except heirloom tomatoes), so the seeds you plant might not produce tomatoes that look exactly like the ones you got the seeds from. I\u2019ve heard the same is true of peppers, as well, though all the peppers I\u2019ve ever grown from grocery store seeds end up looking just like their parents.\n\n12.\tPotatoes \u2013 Can be grown by letting eyes form on a potato and planting that. Cut the potato up so each chunk you plant has at least 3 eyes on it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/lh5sco/i_garden_and_cook_a_lot_one_of_the_coolest_things/", "created_utc": 1612996185.0, "score": 5645, "author": "SleepyConscience", "num_comments": 296, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/lh5sco/i_garden_and_cook_a_lot_one_of_the_coolest_things/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I took up frugal habits learned from here and similar subreddits and after nine months, I'm finally debt-free! (I'm young and don't make a lot, so it took some time) Here are some of my biggest takeaways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHAME IN ASKING FOR HELP -  While I didn't get financial help, I told my family and friends about my situation, and that anything we could do to keep things inexpensive would be appreciated. Instead of going out to dinner and to the movies, I played tons of basketball with friends, started inviting people over for home-cooked meals, and had many cheesy-movie nights with friends. This adds up FAST and saves big money, and having support from loved ones cheering me on to pay things off made a huge difference.\n2. IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU PAY TOO MUCH FOR - Let's take body wash as an example. I was paying over $4 a bottle for the Dove men's soap. I went to Walmart and bought the cheapest soap I could find ($0.99) which was awful. I took a step up to the $1.50 Suave men's stuff and it worked excellent. I did this with everything I bought. I bought the cheapest version, and worked my way up until the quality was acceptable. More often than not, the cheapest thing is just fine!\n3. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT - Here's an unconventional example of this. I like video games, but realized that this wasn't a wise use of money when in debt. Instead of buying new games, I milked the ones I had for their full enjoyment. I've played nothing but Mario Kart 8, Splatoon 2, and Smash Ultimate for the past year and have bought no new games (except Smash when it came out) and have milked an incredible amount of hours (and value) out of them. No need to buy new games if you love the ones you have! This applies to many other items. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you /r/frugal for all the tips. I was a just lurker, but I still felt like I wasn't alone.

{"title": "How to Travel in Japan cheaply - quick notes.", "selftext": "I read a lot from people about how expensive Tokyo and Japan in general is... we went to several cities, saw lots of sights, and while I would say it is far more expensive than, say, Mexico or something, it was still really cheap. So I thought I'd put together some quick tips to save money while out in Japan: \n\n- Biggest expensive is the flight itself. Use Scott's Cheap Flights if you are a frequent traveler (or sign up for free and get occasional emails if not) to help find cheap flights to the country. We bought our tickets for $450 round trip. \n\n- Use hostels, APA Hotels, etc. Hostels are the cheapest way to stay in Japan, and they are quite nice. We stayed in several, and if you book early you can get some really amazing ones that are gorgeous for cheap. They also have the benefit of local knowledge and lots of flyers of local events coming up. We attended a festival our second day we had no idea was going on. We actually browsed on hotels.com as well, scored an APA hotel in Kanazawa for less than the price of both of us staying at a hostel--and it came with roof-top bathing. (EDIT: It has been pointed out that APA hotels may be owned by some unsavory people. Business Hotels in general, something APA is, are cheap nice hotels that get the job done, so if you want more ethical purchases, you might steer clear of APA.) \n\n- Pack LIGHTLY. A backpack should be the most you are carrying because there is LOTS of walking in Japan; if you want to visit several cities like we did, you'll have your work cut out for you. You can get taxis and such, but that's part of what drives the cost up, and you don't want to be lugging tons of luggage on trains either. Hostels have laundry services many times, so you can wash clothes during the trip. \n\n- Get a Japan Rail Pass. This is THE BEST way to tour Japan and it is super cheap for tourists to do so. Taking a bullet train from Kyoto to Tokyo takes literally ZERO more dollars thanks to this pass, you can flash it as you walk by like Leeloo Dallas. It can seem expensive up front, but once you get there and realize how much it would cost just to wander around Tokyo, you realize how cheap and valuable this thing is. (EDIT: There is a lot of controversy apparently about this pass! I absolutely found it worth while and worth the money spent. It took a lot of the \"I need to plan everything right to spend my money accordingly\" out of the equation, and I didn't worry about catching the wrong trains or if we could afford to go to x city last minute or not. If train travel is an anxious thing for you, I definitely recommend this as it makes everything much easier.) \n\n- Konbinis are everywhere. Convenience stores (shortened to Konbini) have cheap food and we mostly used these for breakfast (if the hostel did not have one) and lunches. We got dinner at ramen shops, street food, conveyor belt sushi shops, small mom-and-pop shops, chain curry shops, etc. but you can shave a lot off of your food expenses with these. They actually have LOTS of healthy food in them. Many Americans are wired to think 'gas station style' stop-and-gos are full of fried food... these have that, but also healthy sandwiches, onigiri, etc. We kept our food costs waaay down thanks to these shops. The key is, Eat Japanese Food. If you eat specialty foods they will cost more than bento boxes, onigiri, etc. \n\n- Gardens are everywhere, and free to do for the most part. Small donations are encouraged (and we always did) but it costs very little to go see gorgeous quiet gardens. If your travel buddy wants to see the hustle of Harajuku and the noise and crowd is just too much, a HUGE garden is literally across the street and is somehow instantly quiet. \n\n- Carry cash on you. You need lots of it in Japan, and everything is very much so still cash-based wherever you go. \n\n- There are cities that are less expensive than others too! Takayama, for example, is gorgeous, thriving culture and community with SO much to do, and it is far cheaper than the heart of Tokyo. You can even get a cheap Ryokan ($75ish a person vs over $150-200 as the standard price) there (look up Nomadic Nerd's article on it as that's how we found it) there and have a beautiful luxury evening and meals included. I think we would have spent more if we stayed in just Tokyo. Kanazawa has lovely Geisha and Samurai districts. Matsumoto has one of the oldest castles ever. etc. \n\n- Stay away from Tokyo's big tourist traps. Robot Restaurant, for example, is a big one, but there are a lot of tourist traps in Tokyo where those areas tend to jack up the prices. This is true for most tourist areas of course. (EDIT: Hahaha this was ALSO a big point of debate! Some people really liked the outlandishness of it all, some people found it uncomfortable. For me, definitely, the whole area it was in + the RR itself was awful and a waste of money.... Thoough, I more enjoyed the gardens, temples, street vendors, etc. So take it for what it's worth and try it out if it sounds good to you. Don't take my word for anything, I may have different tastes than you!) \n\n- The airports and train stations actually have some cool souvenirs. If you're waiting to buy souvenirs or seem to have forgotten some last minute, the airport (and the train stations) actually isn't totally overpriced like you'd find in the states. You can get insanely cute cakes and such that make great take-home souvenirs without having to carry them everywhere with you the whole trip. \n\n- If you're looking for a cheap Yukata or Kimono to take home, consider stopping by Chicago second hand store in Harajuku. I bought 2 yukatas for $20 each and 1 obi that matched both of the for around the same price. Tokyu Hands is an insane department store in Tokyo (EDIT: Rightly pointed out, not JUST in Tokyo, but there IS one in Tokyo) that has floors of cool gifts and stuff--I bought a couple terrific bento boxes from there. \n\n- If you have a job where you use pens a lot, consider buying some in Japan! Im a nurse, and use different color pens to help organize everything, and Japan had my back with awesome professional looking combo-color pens. \n\nAnyways, that's all I got, feel free to add more here in the comments too! \n\nEDIT: There absolutely IS a whole subreddit about traveling to this amazing country and I recommend checking it out before you go. \n\nEDIT 2: People were asking about my budget. \n\nIt was $3,500 for 2 people for 2 weeks. \n\nI only spent $2,500 in Japan itself including the flights. \n\nThe flights were $450 each from San Fran to Narita. A small part of why the flights were cheaper was because we got free flights to San Francisco from the East Coast (I have a friend that works in the airport and I did her a solid, so she repayed me with that.) However, South West has cheap flights in country in the US, and I would recommend catching a flight to the West coast and trying to fly to Japan from there to save loads of money on the flight. We were going to do this and book the flights for around $100-200 (I can't remember, somewhere between those numbers) one way when we got the free deal as an option. Still, $1,300 for both people to fly is pretty cheap! We did spend slightly outside of that budget in China, but we had overnight lay-overs in China 2 nights (one there, one back). I did not include that in here because we chose that lay-over over direct flights, and we could have slept in the airport, but opted to get out and sight see. \n\nThe hotels/hostels costed around $10-20 a night depending on where we stayed. \n\nWe spent around $10 (mostly close to $10) a day each on food. I count some odd ball luxury items food-wise as 'entertainment' if we were there for other purposes (historical site, or something like that) so some of that IS in our activities fund, but this is probably 10/14 days worth. Hostels with breakfast included FTW.\n\nThe JRP was ~$200 a person.

{"title": "I quit a well paying job that I love because of this sub.", "selftext": "You guys inspired me to take a pay cut and quit a job I once thought I would retire from, in the name of frugality. \n\nFor the past five years I've had a job that I love, I get paid ridiculously well and I have great benefits, it's a good culture etc. etc. But over time,  Ive felt increasingly anxious and dissatisfied with the job and until recently I wasn't sure why.\n\nI've kind of always been aware that my time even off the company clock has monetary value, and so sometimes I will pay more for something that saves a lot of time, or I will forgo money-saving measures that take too much time. But this sub has led me to take that time-frugal mindset to the next level. \n\nFirst, by teaching me that quality time with loved ones is even more valuable than regular time. So many of the comments on this sub about saving time mention using that time to be with family and friends. \n\nSecondly, by teaching me to look even deeper into budgeting and decision making when it comes to opportunity costs. Sometimes you can be doing great and making money and saving money but simultaneously preventing yourself from being even greater and saving and making even more money. \n\nSo when I was commuting over an hour each way in my personal vehicle and getting home past my daughter's bedtime and working every weekend, even though I was enjoying myself at work and thought the generous compensation was worth it, I was really losing out in the long term. I was burning out at work and burning up my car and burning through the short times I had with her by being exhausted. \n\nToday I took an offer which is a pay cut to have a schedule and a work location which will allow me to drop off and pick up my daughter at school every single day of the week. That is more valuable than I can express.

It's a super easy way to make some cash and makes you feel really good for helping the environment. Now we live in a state that doesn't have a can deposit so each can is only worth 1-2cents.

{"title": "7 random things I do to be Frugal", "selftext": "1) I live in wifi 99% of the time.  Most cell phone plans are under $10 for 1GB of data.  Tello starts at $5\n\n2) Bunny Ears / Antenna provide over 20 channels of great content. ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, and more for free.\n\n3) The library is not your library of the 90s.  From PS5 games to great movies.  Check out weekly for tons of free entertainment. \n\n4) Cash \"Stings\" more than swiping a card.   If you want to stick to a budget, hand over cash on your impulse buys and feel that sting.   Studies show, even on 0% interest cards, you spend 20% more when swiping.   Save money buy feeling the money leave your hands. \n\n5) When going to live events, football games/concert.  Park and wait until the game starts.  I have seen tickets drop from $150 to $8 multiple times by just missing the kickoff and then walking in.   We have set in seats on a premier concert which started at $500 ticket, missed the opening act and got in for under $60.  Big Ten College basketball games for under $4 ticket after fees..  People panic when selling 3rd party tickets after the event starts.   Enjoy the main act and save up to 95%. \n\n6) Designate a \"no spend month\" twice a eyar.  February is a good place to start with fewer days.  Use every single thing in your house to eat, look for coupons, eat rice and beans.  Try to live like you've never lived 2 out of 12 months and it really helps. \n\n7) Panera Sip Club.  Sign ups usually give you 3 months free and next 3 at a discount when you sign up.  If you live within a couple of miles,  get large drinks without ice and take home.  You can get Coffee, Iced Coffee, Tea, Iced Tea, Soda, Bubbly, etc.   Go a couple times a day and have plenty of drinks to share without the ice or have multiple times.   An Iced Coffee with my own ice, makes 5 cups of my own cups.   Full price is $11.99/month. I have been a customer for a year and yet to have paid that much.  Probably spent $3,000 in retail pricing.

I was living on the east coast, paying a ridiculous amount of money for a tiny apartment and general cost of living.

This allowed me to start paying more than the minimums on my cards.

Here are some of mine:\n\n1. Dried beans, lentils and rice can provide you with a lot of cheap meals. Also, Google the ingredients you have on hand and AI will often recommend a recipe.\n\n2. Grocery stores sometimes will sell you produce that is too old to sell, but still edible if cooked right away. Don't be ashamed to ask your local grocer!\n\n3. No entertainment expenses. Library or bust. There is also a lot on youtube or free streaming, including tutorials, movies, exercise classes and music.\n\n4. Bored or anxious? Take a long walk in the woods or clean your house with music blaring.\n\n5. Invite friends to your place for coffee/tea and snacks instead of going out. Throw a pot luck for games or movie nights.\n\n6. Pay attention to free or discount days at your local museums or attractions. \n\n7. Borrow things from friends/family. We've borrowed and loaned out tools, specialty cooking appliances, divided plants, books, movies, games, etc.\n\n8. Mend or upcycle your clothes.

You don't have to drop $10,000 on a new roof. Roofs are wear items by the way: they don't last indefinitely. Somewhere around the corner that $10,000 bill is going to land. \n\nToilet leaking at the base. Replace that yourself for a total of $300 or do you pay $1,200 for someone else to do it?\n\n\"Oh no, my gutter is leaking and I got water running down the side of my house onto the window leaking in, do I fix that myself for $200 or do I pay someone $1,000?\"\n\nI come from a family of renters and I have been a renter a long time, but 3 years ago I became a homeowner. I have since realized how much I took for granted. Literally everything is now my responsibility. And failure to be responsible will lead to unlivable conditions. With no one to complain to. \n\nIf you have the money to buy a really good house then yes it's better than renting. If you can do the work yourself (like I do), yes it's better than renting. If you aren't making big money and also aren't handy, you should rethink how owning a home is so much better than renting.\n\nEdit: Some have mistaken this post for me advocating against home ownership. That's absolutely not the case. It works for me because I can do the repairs myself. I'm merely explaining that if I made the same income but didn't have handy skills, it would be a total sinkhole. \n\nI made this post because I see a lot of low-income individuals looking at home ownership like it's an escape from overpaying on rent. The costs to own are far more than the mortgage payment alone. Either you have the money to absorb the costs or you have the skills to do the work yourself.

{"title": "If you are going to toe the line between frugal and cheap at least be pleasant about it.", "selftext": "I will start by saying I've had to be ridiculously careful with my money when I was younger and remember how much it sucked. Like living in my car for weeks and only eating what was left on bussed plates at work broke. But I never made it anyone else's problem or acted an ass about it. So my tolerance is 0 for people who are assholes because they feel they deserve to be. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, on to the story. I was at the store NYE picking up some things to enjoy with my boyfriend for the holiday and decided I'd like to tack on some crab legs. At the seafood counter was a woman already fighting with the employee at the case. He was apologizing stating that he has to serve the meat as it is and she was looking at him like he'd just slapped her in the face. My curiosity did get the better of me so I stood right behind her. They argued back and forth for a bit, her screaming she shouldn't have to pay by weight for parts she can't eat and him apologizing, stating policy and trying to just get her through the line now that three of us were standing there waiting. You guys... This bitch was trying to get him to remove the tails of the $11lb shrimp before weighing it. That might get you what, 2 extra shrimp? I was gobsmacked. I understand when you want something out of budget and are desperate to find a way to splurge but what the absolute fuck. Eventually a manager came out and stepped to the side with her while the poor guy just getting chewed on had to throw his game face back on and serve the rest of the customers. There was maybe a pound and a half of shrimp left and I seriously debated getting petty and just buying it to end the bullshit still raging next to me but decided against it. She was still bitching as I left the counter. People like that make their own lives harder and then take it out on others because they have a hard life. Just pisses me right off. \n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR/Moral of the story, pick your battles. Cut costs and corners where you can but not if it will negatively impact others. Checking if maybe you can have a discount on a dented can? Frugal win! Demanding the poor counter clerk de-tail 30 shrimp for you to save pennies?

{"title": "I only spent $1,728.79 in 2022 for groceries, averaging around $144 a month, here\u2019s some tips!", "selftext": " \n\nAs the title suggest, I went through my budget and was surprised to see I really underspent on my groceries and wanted to share some things we did that might be helpful. This will be a long post but hopefully it helps someone, I only just learned how to cook this past year and used this sub to help me, so hopefully I\u2019m able to pay it forward since some of the things I learned I haven\u2019t seen mentioned here. Some things to get out of the way before the tips:\n\n* This is strictly groceries, not eating out, or household maintenance no pots/pans, cleaning supplies, paper towels, coffee filters etc etc strictly food we consume\n* I am the main decision maker when it comes to the kitchen, I pay for about %75 of groceries, my SO pitches in for smaller grocery runs (under $25) so the average is probably $200 a month, still way below the standard $300 for household of 2 adults\n* We\u2019re both 30, both work full time, no kids and combined make probably just over $130k in a fairly big city (MCOL) in the NE USA\n* We share about %90 of the food we eat. Nothing exclusive to one another except a few random things ex. I drink almond milk, my SO drinks whole milk and some other small differences.\n* We are NOT foodies, and we are NOT great cooks. This is my first year actually learning to cook. And it\u2019s the reason we wanted to keep our grocery budget low, since we value everything else in our budget more than food, so as long as it\u2019s nutritious and at least decent to eat, we\u2019re happy :)\n\nLast thing I wanted to share was some life events that impacted our budget, we relocated to this new city Dec 2021, so the first few months of the year I was still building out my pantry, which was an added expense. Then this past September I got a work from home position, so far my budget has not been influenced too much by it but only time will tell.\n\nOkay time for tips:\n\n\\-**Most likely what you grew up eating, will be the cheapest thing for you to cook.** Whether you\u2019re hispanic, asian, american, european\u2026you have familiarity with the flavors and your pantry is probably already geared towards that pallet bringing the cost per meal way lower. For instance, I\u2019m hispanic and I know off the top of my head 10 different rice recipes just because I grew up eating them, even if some of them I can\u2019t cook just yet, I know how they\u2019re suppose to taste and what\u2019s involved in it. Give me a potato and I only know how to boil it. Maybe I\u2019ll add it to one of my hispanic dishes, but guess what? I\u2019m still cooking rice to go with it. Speaking about cost per meal, I quickly realized how expensive it was to branch to diff food profiles, I wanted to learn how to cook more asian dishes and kinda had to stop haha, I had no room in my small kitchen for all the additional spices and noodles needed. I settled with some of the basic condiments (sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce and kewpie lol) incase I want to venture off a bit, again a lot of these asian meals also involved rice. Leading me to my biggest point.\n\n\\-**Stick to one carb and run with it**, I rarely cook with potatoes, bread or pasta, my go-to carb is rice (no surprise). I know a lot of people complain about just eating rice and beans to be frugal. But take for instance, if you love potatoes, there\u2019s literally hundreds of different ways to make potatoes interesting, seriously you really can\u2019t get bored of something you *like* to eat. I think that\u2019s the key. I do keep a box of spaghetti handy, and my bf buys bagels for his breakfast, and every once in a while I\u2019ll venture into other things but 80% of the time we\u2019re eating rice and beans (with a salad and a protein).\n\n\\-**We buy the same protein every two weeks.** We buy chicken breast (more on that later), pork-chop (sometimes bone it sometimes not), ground beef (80/20) and shrimp. Every two weeks we run out of them, and we buy them again. If one gets too expensive, we buy an alternative (like ground turkey, or tilapia or chicken strips, whatever is available or cheapest) or we\u2019ll just go w/o one of the protein and maybe just do a veggie dish or stretch out whatever we already have. Eggs we buy about once a month, we only cook them on our off days.\n\n\\-**We almost never buy pre-made meals**, in the beginning I would buy frozen dinners for work and that\u2019s included in this budget. But I would keep them at my work fridge, at home we just cook, eat leftovers or eat out before getting home. Now that I\u2019m working from home, and have a bit more time I do want to learn how to make corn bread and banana bread since we do buy those for quick breakfast and those are easy enough to bake with fairly simple ingredients. I\u2019m also learning how to cut a whole chicken so again I can make stock and learn how to cook more than just chicken breast (idk if I\u2019ll success but we\u2019ll see!).\n\n\\-**We always buy fruit and vegetables**, again we\u2019re creatures of habit. We usually buy the same thing: romaine lettuce, tomatoes, baby carrots, and onion. And in the fruit department we rotate a bit more but we usually always have: apples, tangerine and blueberries (currently we also have kiwi and bananas, yum!). We use the veggies for salad with every meal but also for me to seasoning and we add the fruits to our oatmeal in the morning (yep we buy steel cut oats and just cook it stove top in the morning).\n\n\\-**We shop around a lot**. We do most of our groceries at Aldi (about %80). We also go to our local H-Mart and we just found a nearby Trader Joes near us, those are all our cheap options. We do a ShopRite or Walmart run every once in a while for some specific things. Lastly we do have a Costco membership where we do stock up on dry goods (for instance a 24pck of box almost milk, or 25pds of jasmine rice), but we mostly use Costco for clothes, appliances and household essentials, it does add up in savings even for just the two of us.\n\n\\-**I season in bulk and rotate!** So for instance, if have ground beef, I usually season the whole thing with my basic seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic, Goya), leave half out and freeze the other Half. I can make this weeks ground beef Spanish style with tomatoes, olives, cappers, peppers, cilantro etc and then, next week defrost the remainder and stir fry it with ginger, soy sauce, green onions and carrots. One base seasoning, two different approaches. Same with beans, I boil a pound of dry beans, season it all in a big pot, and divy up what I'll do with it and freeze the rest. Now I only cook about 2-3 time a week, If I\u2019m tired, I know my beef is seasoned and can throw it in the pot, and I can just defrost some beans and put my rice cooker on and have dinner ready in 25min.\n\n\\-**Keep a notepad on the fridge with a running list for when things run out**, I know its common knowledge to always have a shopping list, but it really does work and help curve additional spending!\n\n\\-**If we can't eat it in a week, we freeze it.** Like just the most random things, you\u2019d be surprise you can freeze. I for instance always freeze my cilantro, parsley and green peppers. Like I mentioned I usually freeze my rice and beans. My boyfriend always freezes hotdogs and bread. Also if there\u2019s a can I didn\u2019t finish off, like of tomatoes paste, I just chuck it in the freezer and next time I need it I run through hot water for a few minutes.\n\n\\-**Have an** **Emergency Meal ( a \"911\" like my mom used to call it)**. This is the \u201cI don\u2019t want to lift a finger\u201d meal or the \u201cour fridge is bare but we\u2019re not off until tomorrow to grocery shop\u201d meal. For us it's frozen french fries and frozen jamaican patties, its the only exception to pre-made meal we buy,  we really have gotten into a groove of cooking regularly so it, we only prepare it about 2-3 times a month.\n\nAgain, these are things I had to learn by trial and error, some may be obvious to the general public, but as someone who just learned to cook, it really wasn\u2019t that obvious to me. Yes we probably had the money to be more liberal with our groceries, but 1. We had a lot of other obligations eating at our budget (no pun intended) so this was an easy place to free up some money. 2. We wanted to build habits that would help us in the future, like when we have kids and our budget will inevitable go up. \n\n\\*\\*For those wondering, I got these exact numbers from budgeting with YNAB (You Need a Budget), just went through my year-end reports, so they\u2019re pretty accurate as I track every dollar I spend in the year.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/101t033/i_only_spent_172879_in_2022_for_groceries/", "created_utc": 1672706266.0, "score": 4638, "author": "forgivemefashion", "num_comments": 302, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/101t033/i_only_spent_172879_in_2022_for_groceries/", "html_title": ""}

The frames are literally made of cheap plywood and cardboard... yes cardboard. I needed a looooong couch to fill a space and everything of decent quality that fit my taste was really expensive, $2000-$3000. \n\nSo I found a couch on Craigslist that I loved. It was custom built in 1954 and owned by the same woman ever since. It was the \u201cgood couch\u201d and only sat on when she entertained in the formal dining room. The frame is solid oak and sturdy as hell. It has 8 way hand tied springs, which only the highest end sofas use these days. The upholstery was in good shape, but not my taste. The sofa was $200. \n\nI asked around until I found an older gentleman who worked out of his home shop. He\u2019s retired but still does little jobs here and there. Several people told me he was one of the last true craftsmen in the field. He\u2019s 87 and doesn\u2019t need the money he told me, he just doesn\u2019t have anything else to do and enjoys the work. His rates reflect that and are much more than fair. He recovered the entire couch and made new cushions for $490!\n\nThe fabric was maybe my best find. A huge fabric wholesaler happens to be headquartered in my town, and their outlet store is nearby. All the lines they discontinue are sent there. And it\u2019s cheap. Really cheap. There\u2019s no original price on the bolts, or info about the fabric, you just sort through all these unlabeled bolts and find something you like. This one was $4 a yard! And if you buy the entire bolt it\u2019s 50% off. So I got all my material for $34. I was actually able to find a mill marking on the bolt when I got home and looked it up online. This upholstery fabric sold for $109 a yard new! It\u2019s essentially a high end material used for swanky offices, casinos, etc. It\u2019s made to last forever with high usage. \n\nI got my dream sofa for $724, and I couldn\u2019t be happier!!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/9viimz/ive_been_looking_for_a_high_quality_couch_for/", "created_utc": 1541748979.0, "score": 4349, "author": "cv_mason", "num_comments": 243, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/9viimz/ive_been_looking_for_a_high_quality_couch_for/", "html_title": ""}

This is one of the things I most commonly see folks confused about in r/FreeEBOOKS.  \n\n[Here is an article about the release of works to the public domain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/)\n\n[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.\n\nEbooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. \n\n\n\nPlease ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. \n\n\n# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address\n\nFirst you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it\u2019s way easier to find on your kindle.  \n\n\n**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -> All Settings -> Your Account -> your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**\n\n\nHarder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts & lists-> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg\n\n \n\n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png\n\n \n\n\nClick \u201cDevices\u201d in the menu near the top ->\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png\n\n \n\n\nclick the \u201c\u2026\u201d next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png\n\n \n\n\n(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have \u201cdevices\u201d going back for many years of phones) \n\nYour send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com\n\n\n\n \n\n# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.\n\n \n\nOn [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click \u201cAccount & Lists\u201d -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg\n\n \n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d ->\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png\n\n\n\n\nclick \u201cPreferences\" in the top bar of that page -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png\n\n \n\nClick \u201cPersonal Document Settings\u201d -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png\n\n \n\nfind \u201cApproved Personal Document E-mail List\u201d on that page -> make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png\n\n\n\n\n# 3 - Let\u2019s send a book.  \n\n \n\nGo to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \\-> click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png\n\n \n\nNow open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  \n\nGo to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  \n\nI typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.  \n\nHere are some lists of free ebooks by topic:\n\n[100 free mythology books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9qep6e/heres_a_list_of_100_free_mythology_and_folklore/)\n\n[250 free kids and YA books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9rkjqc/here_is_a_list_ive_compiled_of_250_free_yakids/)\n\n[200 free sci-fi books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9tvcyj/here_is_a_list_of_200_free_scifi_ebooks_ive/)\n\n[100 free classics](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9vy4oa/the_top_100_free_classic_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free Christmas ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a5y4cg/here_is_a_list_of_100_free_christmas_ebooks_ive/)\n\n[100 free history ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a9hsti/here_are_100_free_history_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free poetry books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a9u60i/here_are_100_free_poetry_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free memoirs and autobiographies](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/abaywb/here_are_100_free_ebooks_of_memoirs_and/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/abaxy5/on_january_1_2019_for_the_first_time_in_more_than/", "created_utc": 1546288305.0, "score": 4271, "author": "Chtorrr", "num_comments": 91, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/abaxy5/on_january_1_2019_for_the_first_time_in_more_than/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Being frugal has helped me with dating!", "selftext": "Howdy r/frugal, long-time lurker here. I've been frugal for years which has really helped me develop some new skills which has had an unexpected positive effect on my dating life. For the past several months I've been spending some time with a great girl, and recently realized that some of her favorite things about me are a result of me being frugal. For example:\n\n* For years I was too poor to afford fancy meals, so I learned how to cook - and cook well. She LOVES it when I cook for her rather than take her out to a nice dinner. I have easily saved hundreds of dollars from this aspect of dating alone.\n* Similarly, I grew up eating fresh, artisan bread from local bakeries my entire childhood, but adult me was too poor to buy bread at a bakery. So, I learned to bake. Whenever I bake, I double my yield and send her home with a loaf.\n* I live in a city where there are TONS of free things to do. I follow lots of blogs, newsletters, instagram accounts, etc and curate these events for us to go to. She mentioned the other day how she loves that I have my finger on the pulse of the city. I thought to myself how funny that is because the reason I started going to these free events was because they were free.\n* In the summertime, to save some money on groceries, I plant a small garden with herbs, fresh vegetables, and a few fruits. My passion for gardening and enthusiasm in sharing it with her has been very well received.\n* In brainstorming adventures for us to go on, I've opted for hikes (free) or bike rides (cheap if you use bikeshare) rather than fancy, expensive experiences. She's new to outdoor activities, but has really loved these dates.\n\nAnywho, take it from me - I did not expect the benefits of frugality to spill over into my dating life. But here we are, and I am so much better for it! Good luck to all and happy fruging.\n\nEdit: Wow! Gold! On a post about being frugal... ah the irony, but thanks nonetheless!

{"title": "WARNING: Sears' current promo of \"$7.00 off $70.00+ Purchase\" will sneak the charge back in at the end of the transaction.", "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI bought a mattress online from Sears today.  \n\nAfter I made the purchase, I received the receipt in the mail, and as always looked it over to make sure everything looked all right. \n\nHere is an album showing the receipt emailed to me from Sears and an explanation of how they overcharged me, along with a screenshot of the problematic promo:  http://imgur.com/a/cDrxi\n\nI just spent over an hour on the phone with customer service, spoke with a regular representative who told me Sears would only add $7.00 in points back to my \"Save Your Way Account\" and not back to my credit card.  I seldom shop at Sears, so I didn't want that.  I told her I could just cancel the whole order and put it through again to see if the new promo worked the second time, but she told me since I paid with gift cards, that it would take up to 3 business days to process the balance back on my gift cards to try again.  And there was no guarentee that it would work the second time. \n\nThen I spoke to a supervisor to see if there was anything that could be done, and to give him a heads up that their website promo is being screwy and they should probably alert IT (just my advice).  At first he didn't believe me that there was a promo going on for $7 off a Purchase of $70+.  Then once I had him look at the actual company website to see I didn't make up the promo, he kept trying to get me to just accept the points instead of a return to my credit card.  Then he tried to tell me that since I used gift cards, my price fell below the $70+ restriction on the promo, which I could tell he was a rule he made up on the spot (says no where on the promo, and gift cards are to be treated as cash).  Finally he ended up giving me an email address to their \"back office\" to get rid of me when I wouldn't relent that the $7.00 store credit was not acceptable.  I wrote a lengthy email, sent it, and it bounced back to me that saying, \"WHOOPS!  You replied to an unmonitored email address.\"  Great. \n\nFinally I spoke with a very kind customer service rep online who told me that the rude supervisor apparently sent in a request for a $7.00 credit back to my *credit card* to their billing department, and I will find out in about 3-5 business days if it's granted to me.   \n\nI know this seems like a big fuss to make over $7.00, but I knew if anyone would understand why I fought for it, it would be the people of /r/Frugal.  Pretty sure this is the sort of thing that could evolve into a class action law suit if it happens to enough people.  Oh well.  Guess I'll see in a few days if I get my money back or not.  \n\nTL;DR:  $7 off promo is listed on my receipt, but my final payment does not reflect that discount.  Called customer service, spoke with one helpless person, one rude supervisor, and one nice guy on chat and I *might* get my money back if \"billing approves it.\" \n\n\nEdit:  I received my receipt via E-mail.  Electronic mail.  Not snail mail haha.  Thanks for all the responses everyone!  FYI, I have not tweeted at Sears or gone to their Facebook yet.  I'll wait to see if they approve or deny the request that the Supervisor submitted before I jump in for a good old fashioned public shaming.\n.    \n.  \n.    \n.  \nEDIT 2:  So far I've had two people from Sears reach out to me via PM.  I called and spoke with one of them today, and it sounds like he's been able to get the $7.00 returned to my credit card.  He told me it should show up in 3-5 business days, so I'll be sure to post an update for anyone who'd be interested to let you know if it comes through or not.

{"title": "I was a coffee barista for 4 years; here are our recipes for our best selling iced drinks that you can make for cheaper at home!", "selftext": "Former coffee barista here! There was a post recently on here where I left a comment about how to make some specialty drinks that people enjoyed when I was a barista, so I figured I\u2019d make my own post so more people could find it.\n\nAs a preface since this is r/frugal and I\u2019m sure there are other current/former barista\u2019s on here\u2014take my advice/ingredient recs with a grain of salt! I didn\u2019t work at Starbucks (I worked at a small independent cafe here in Westchester NY) and every cafe uses different ingredients and has different ratios for their recipes. So if you\u2019ve found that a recipe I\u2019m sharing sounds too sweet or you don\u2019t want to spend x for a certain brand because you have your own preferred brand then hey, feel free to experiment/substitute with your favorites! Nothing is set in stone and at best these are just base recipes till you figure out what ratio and brands work for you. And if you think to yourself \u201cwell I\u2019m not spending $30+ for all that!\u201d Then clearly you don\u2019t drink these enough to hurt your wallet\u2014which, good for you.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started!\n\n**Chocolate sauce:**\n\nA tip I learned for mocha drinks (even without a fancy machine) is to either add a splash of hot coffee to the bottom of your cup after decorating the sides with chocolate, so it\u2019ll melt and you don\u2019t get a straw full of chocolate as your first sip and you still have the pretty decoration. The reason I started doing this (I wasn\u2019t trained about that) was because I noticed customers complaining about one of my coworkers leaving a huge pool of chocolate at the bottom of the cup, so from then on I started melting it with some coffee and I suddenly had customers wanting me specifically to make their drinks\u2014it\u2019s the little things that make a difference, I\u2019m telling ya! Same can be applied for caramel sauce and honey--honey in coffee is sinfully delicious.\n\nIf you\u2019re using cold brew and don\u2019t have hot coffee ready then a splash of hot water works just as well and won\u2019t mess up the flavor.\n\n**Syrups/sauces:**\n\nHomeGoods/Marshalls has fantastic coffee syrups and is easily available to the public--Amazon carries these brands as well but I've found that they're  cheaper at HomeGoods/Marshalls. The best brands for flavoring coffees are either the Torani or Monin syrups; that\u2019s what my job used and customers loved them and I even go out of my way to see what brands small coffee shops use and so far it\u2019s been these two so you know they\u2019re good. I have also seen both the Torani chocolate and caramel sauce there and for the price they are worth the buy. Unfortunately when you buy them from the store they don't come with a pump, so if you have a shot glass then just add a shot at a time to your drink till you're content with the flavor. If you don't have a shot glass them go a tablespoon at a time.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to cut down on sugar (or can't have) but still enjoy flavored drinks then the Torani sugar free vanilla (which is what I usually see at HomeGoods) is VERY sweet (tastes sweeter than the normal one actually) so I usually just add a pump or even just half a pump to my coffee and it\u2019s delicious. If you\u2019re not used to sugar free syrups you\u2019ll definitely taste a difference but trust me when I say that if you really wanna cut out your sugar intake (and are fine with fake sugar) then just keep trying to drink it and after maybe a week your palette changes and you\u2019ll find it yummy\ud83e\udd24\n\nFor anyone doubting my last comment: I used to take my coffee as super light and sweet back when I was in college; basically sugar in a cup and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t stand the taste of anything sugar free. Then I realized I should stop adding sugar and slowly phased out the amount of sugar I was using until I got to the point where I was just drinking my coffee with some oat milk. Wasn\u2019t super yummy but it got the job done and I wasn\u2019t making a face when drinking it anymore! Whenever I want to actually enjoy the taste is when I\u2019ll add a half pump of sugar free vanilla syrup to my cup.\n\nThe flavors we had of the syrups were as followed for our hot or iced coffees/lattes (starting from the left was the most popular, to the least popular with customers):\n\nVanilla\n\nPistachio (Monin brand\u2014the syrup is green and I\u2019m not joking when I say we had times where we couldn\u2019t meet demand because we kept running out)\n\nCaramel\n\nSugar free vanilla\n\nHazelnut\n\nPumpkin spice (not the worst one or anything but people tended to think we didn't carry pumpkin spice year round so they didn't ask for it outside of Autumn. This is honestly best in the chai mixes anyway--not on its own.)\n\nAnd for iced teas:\n\nMango (Torani brand)\n\nPeach (Monin brand)\n\nSugar free raspberry (Monin)\n\n**Chai/Pumpkin spice lattes:**\n\nWe used Big Train brand chai latte mix (find it on Amazon\u2014 it\u2019s a bag or can with a dark purple label).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a steamer wand then add 2-3 scoops to a small pan with your choice of milk with 1-2 pumps of vanilla syrup. Mix well and heat up till desired temperature. If doing iced then add 3 scoops and 2 pumps of vanilla syrup. It\u2019s a sweet mix on its own, but with some experimenting you\u2019ll find your ratio of sweetness when adding the syrups.\n\nIf you want a pumpkin spice flavored drink then buy a bottle of Torani pumpkin spice syrup and add 1 pump of vanilla and 2 pumps of pumpkin spice instead (and a single or double shot of espresso\u2014pumpkin spice is traditionally with espresso but if you just want something similar to the chai/don't want espresso then feel free to omit the espresso). Top it off with some cinnamon\u2014yum!\n\nChai lattes were (and still currently are) the biggest seller at that cafe. You can also try using Trader Joe\u2019s brand chai latte mix; this brand mix is slightly less sweet but is spicier (as in flavor because of the spices used\u2014not spicy as in hot. The flavor is exactly what you\u2019ll think of when you think Autumn) which can really be yummy as well. One of my coworkers that doesn\u2019t like how sweet the Big Train brand is said that she finds the Trader Joe\u2019s brand to be of better quality. Big Train Chai mix is not authentic chai but it does taste good, which I know is what a lot of people care most about.\n\nIf you want some coffee in your chai then feel free to make it a dirty chai by adding a shot or two of espresso into it.\n\n**Chocolate/Strawberry milk:**\n\nWhenever we had kids (or even some adults) we'd get asked for chocolate milk. It wasn't on our menu but I made it for them anyway. Just take your desired amount of milk and add it to a small pan with chocolate sauce and 1-3 pumps of vanilla. Chocolate milk is served cold, so just barely heat up the milk enough to melt the chocolate and then pour it into your cup. I usually will add 1-2 ice cubes to keep the milk cold for the kids.\n\nWe had a strawberry puree for one of our pastries and one day I experimented to see if I could make strawberry milk and it worked and it's downright sinful. You can either buy your own strawberry puree or make your own by just adding some sugar to some mashed up strawberries and cooking them on the stovetop till the strawberries break down. Once cooled you can store in a jar. Look up any video for making jams and it's about the same process I believe, just less cooking time since the longer you cook it for, the thicker it becomes. Purees are looser than jams.\n\nOnce you have your puree, do the same steps as you would for the chocolate milk (the vanilla syrup is what really brings the flavor together).\n\n**Ice cubes:**\n\nIf you love iced coffee during the summer then coffee ice cubes are great! We only made a few trays because the customers that knew we had them would take advantage and we couldn\u2019t meet the demand for them since we already had a regular ice machine. Coffee ice cubes really help keep your drink from getting watered down. Espresso ice cubes work great as well either for your iced coffee or for an iced latte. Don\u2019t bother adding milks or flavorings to the cubes; just put black coffee or just pure espresso into an ice cube tray and freeze them. We used large silicone ice cube molds for the largest cup (it never fit into the cup so I would just run some hot water on the cube to get it to the right size)\u2026was a bit more convenient to do during a rush then to just grab a glove and hope I get a bunch of smaller cubes into the cup without dropping anything. Plus the bigger cubes tend to last until you finish your drink and still be plenty left over if you wanted a refill. If making regular sized cubes is better for you then go right ahead.\n\n**Hot chocolate:**\n\nFor a really yummy hot chocolate I recommend the Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix. We kind of used whatever brand we could get but our customers went crazy for the Ghirardelli mix specifically so we tended to stick with that one.\n\nAdd a drizzle of chocolate sauce to your pan with your desired amount of milk and for 24oz add 3 scoops (2 scoops for anything smaller) and 1-2 pumps of vanilla syrup OR 1 pump of vanilla and 1-2 pumps of peppermint syrup for a peppermint hot chocolate. Heat to your desired temperature, drizzle a bit of chocolate into your cup and top off the drink with some whipped cream and unsweetened cocoa powder. If you\u2019d like a dirty hot chocolate (which are crazy delicious) then add a shot of espresso to your cup. The flavor from the espresso pairs very well with chocolate.\n\nI have tried the Ghirardelli white chocolate mix and it was alright\u2014didn\u2019t taste bad or anything but I wasn\u2019t personally crazy about it, but then again I\u2019m not super crazy about white chocolate in general but some people are. If you prefer white chocolate then use the same recipe for the hot chocolate mix but just replace the chocolate sauce with white chocolate sauce. Or you can make it black & white by using chocolate sauce with the white chocolate mix (that was my favorite thing to do).\n\nI actually did once mix the white chocolate mix and hot chocolate mix together so the white chocolate mix wouldn\u2019t go to waste\u2014and it was pretty good!\n\n**Iced tea:**\n\nWhen it comes to steeping teas you\u2019d be surprised by how accurate tea guides are\u2014the ones that tell you how long to steep certain types. We used to have a huge tea bag that we would just drop in a huge container of hot water and customers hated it\u2014too bitter/didn\u2019t taste yummy. Then my coworker looked up what temperature the water for black tea should be and how long it should be steeped for and customers started loving the flavor after that.\n\nIf you enjoy fresh iced teas then I\u2019ve found that mixing different tea bags can make some really refreshing teas\u2014I actually got the idea from one of our regulars. We usually used the Bigelow brand or Steep brand tea bags.\n\nTake 1 bag of mint and 1 bag of green tea. Once it\u2019s steeping add in a piece of yellow lemon and your desired amount of honey or agave. We usually would put the steaming pitcher (or cup) in an ice bath and by the time the mixture cooled (after mixing it every now and then to speed up the cooling process) then it was perfect and less likely to get bitter from over steeping. You can either take the bags out or keep them in your cup and just add your desired amount of ice (you get a stronger flavor this way and with the honey you\u2019re less likely for the bags to make the tea bitter). This iced tea is perfect during a hot summer day\u2014the mint is mellowed out by the grassiness of the green tea and the honey really bring outs the flavor. So you get the coolness of the mint and the sweetness from the honey.\n\nAnother refreshing combination is 1 bag of lemon ginger with 1 bag of green (specifically the Steep brand lemon ginger bags\u2014my absolute favorite, and it was a huge favorite for customers as well\u2014hot or cold) with some honey and lemon. Or even 1 bag of lemon ginger with 1 bag of mint with honey and lemon.\n\n**\\*Please make sure that either both teas are caffeine free or just one of them has caffeine. If both have caffeine then it'll be too much caffeine for your body to handle and your heart will race like crazy and make you feel like you're having a panic attack--ask me how I know...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**London fog:**\n\nTake two bags of earl grey tea and add 2-3 pumps of vanilla syrup. After adding your desired amount of hot water, add the cup to an ice bath and stir till cooled down. Add the tea mixture to a cup of ice and add a splash of your choice of milk. Take a taste and if not sweet enough then just add more vanilla syrup. Very simple but so yummy. If making it hot then top it off with some steamed milk.\n\nOur store unfortunately didn\u2019t have a blender so I don\u2019t have any frappe recipes, sorry! I truly hope this helps a few of you out :)\n\nEnjoy, and don\u2019t be afraid to lightly experiment with different flavor/brand combinations!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/pgzej7/i_was_a_coffee_barista_for_4_years_here_are_our/", "created_utc": 1630649495.0, "score": 4016, "author": "shipping_addict", "num_comments": 154, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/pgzej7/i_was_a_coffee_barista_for_4_years_here_are_our/", "html_title": ""}

What really struck me was the outpouring of gratitude from millions of people who read his co-authored book. \n\nThis book really surprised me when I read it. This book correctly identifies millionaires as being cheapskates, not the overspending stereotypes we are used to hearing about. It talks about how high income earners can go broke by overspending, and how those with modest incomes can achieve millionaire status by being frugal. \n\n\u201cThe Millionaire Next Door\u201d should be required reading in school. I know it sounds like this book does not belong in /r/frugal, but I think that the themes inside it really should resonate in this subreddit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/5c5nqx/the_millionaire_next_door_is_probably_the_best/", "created_utc": 1478747979.0, "score": 3814, "author": "lifecharger", "num_comments": 481, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/5c5nqx/the_millionaire_next_door_is_probably_the_best/", "html_title": ""}

We are working on building trust and teaching skills for all of the kids.\n\nI woke up this morning to find a bunch of messages, because the post had been added to the bestofredditorupdates.  I am so thankful for all of you supporting our effort to be a safe place in a scary world for this teenager.\n\n\n\nOriginal post: A few months ago, I asked for frugal meal ideas to help us stretch our family's budget to incorporate an extra teenager.  You all were amazing in not only giving ideas but many of you sent items from a wish list that helped us meet immediate needs.  We were able to make sure the teen had the toiletry items, clothing that fit and were weather appropriate and have simple meals and snacks available.\n\nIn the past few months, our bonus teen has been spending a lot of time at our house with our teens and they all have been learning simple life skills like doing their own laundry, budgeting, and cooking.  The newest request from all of our teens is to learn baking.  I have seen the anxiety lessen throughout the months.\n\nI wanted to update and let you all know what an important role you have played in this young teenager's life, as well as my family.  Thank you for opening your hearts and helping.  We hope to be able to stay in this teenager's life for years to come and to continue to provide support, in whatever they need.\n\nEditing to answer questions asked in messages:\n\n1. The snacks and meals lasted for more than 3 months, plus we still have a few things left.\n2. The toiletry items have helped a lot in our bonus teen\u2019s self-confidence.\n3.

{"title": "Save TONS of money when selling/buying a home (advice from a former real estate agent).", "selftext": "*Edit: This got way bigger than I thought it would and I'm worried that people are going to put a lot of stock in what I wrote, so if you're consulting this at some point in the future as an official guide to how to buy real estate from an industry veteran, I feel I should mention that I do not consider myself anything close to a real estate expert. The point of this post is really not to tell you the best way to buy or sell a home. What I intended to do was show people that the internet has changed buying and selling real estate and the old model deserves some scrutiny. It's up to you to decide what's right for you and to research your options because there are now more options than ever for buying/selling. Read the comments, read the replies, read everything you can about real estate and talk to other people you trust. Buying and selling a home is a HUGE undertaking. Don't just mindlessly hire an agent because you think that the fact that they have a license makes them valuable. It doesn't. Equally important, don't mindlessly follow my advice below thinking that you'll definitely save money. You might not. There is risk in everything. Just be sure that whatever you choose, you take control. Don't let agents bully you or scare you into thinking they are the only option. Also, I just had an interesting thought. If you're a curious type and have some spare time. You could take the same real estate courses that agents take from your local association for around $500 or so. Even if you get an agent, it could be money and time worth spending. Plus the classes are interesting if you like that sort of thing!*\n\nI started writing some of these points in a different thread and realized that many of you frugal folks might appreciate some tips to save THOUSANDS of dollars when selling or buying a home. I used to sell real estate before the bubble burst and I went broke but I did it just long enough to realize the traditional real estate agent model is set up in a way that really doesn't always benefit consumers. I honestly thought that the old school model of an agent listing a home for 6% commission would completely shift when the internet started becoming more sophisticated in that industry. While that has happened to some degree, the Realtor's association is very strong and I think most people are still unaware that you don't have to hire someone at 6% commission to sell your home and you don't really need to hire a buyer's agent either. In fact, the benefits of hiring one are usually negligible at best and actually often worse than the alternative. In almost all cases there are specialists (attorneys, photographers, appraisers, inspectors etc.) that you can hire who will do a better job for way less money. And while it may seem as though managing all of that by yourself might be difficult or time consuming I would argue that with the tools available to us through the internet it's comparable to hiring an agent on both counts. As with most things, there are plenty of exceptions where my advice doesn't apply but I think this will be helpful for many people buying/selling a home (even seasoned veterans of home sales and purchases) to understand that there are alternatives besides the old model. Since every circumstance is different, I encourage you to meet with agents and see what they have to offer to determine what's right for you but this should help you with some behind-the-scenes context that agents aren\u2019t likely to mention. With no further ado, I give you my guide to buying and selling a house on the cheap.\n\nSelling your home: \n\n**Why you think you need a seller's agent** - If you're selling your house, you may think the only way to do it is to hire an agent. Maybe you believe the process is too complicated for you or you think that the real estate agent has some sort of magical house-selling power or they can bring a list of buyers that will pay top dollar for your property. You may even think that they can take the pain away from what is typically a very painful process.\n\n**Why you don't** - Unless you have a lot of varied skills and *recent* experience with buying and selling homes already, you will need help. But the real question is whether a seller's agent is worth 5%-6% of your home's value and are there cheaper/better alternatives. As a reminder, 6% comes out to $12,000 on a $200,000 home! Here are some things an agent can actually do for you to earn that 6% commission. Provide advice on pricing and home improvements to get your house ready for sale. Take pictures, write copy and enter all the other relevant data into the local MLS service (basically, fill out a form online). Help lead negotiations when you have a deal on the table. Of all of those benefits, the most important is getting your property listed on the MLS. This is the service that companies like Trulia and Zillow use to populate their websites and is the service that other realtors use as the main database to find properties to show their clients. If you're not on the MLS, you're basically not really for sale. This is something that realtors rely on to keep normal people like us coming to them. But there is a solution to that problem (included in the bullets below). Other than the MLS thing, though, the internet renders most of the realtor\u2019s benefits obsolete. So here\u2019s how to get the above benefits without spending $12,000:\n\n* Pricing advice (Max value; $400) \u2013 There is no true science to pricing a home. Realtors and appraisers will argue that point but real estate is so much more nuanced than a scoring spreadsheet will tell you. Ultimately, it comes down to just knowing your market. Use sites like Trulia to see current properties on the market to evaluate your competition. Then look at properties similar to yours that have sold within the last 3-6 months or so to get an idea of a realistic final selling price. Assuming you\u2019re not delusional and you know your neighborhood, you will get pretty close. Even when people hire agents, the agent often just lists for whatever the seller wants anyway. If you so desire, you can have a professional appraisal done on your property for less than $400, though many agents will offer a free \u201chome valuation\u201d as part of their marketing efforts hoping that you will ultimately list with them. If you\u2019re comfortable having them do this with no intension of hiring them, that\u2019s kind of up to your personal moral code, but it is an option. Many agents will do this for you even if you explicitly tell them you are going to try to sell on your own because they know you may call them if you decide to list with an agent eventually.\n* Home improvement advice (Max value; $0.00) - You could read countless articles on how to prepare a home for sale and follow their advice, which will probably be all you need. An agent will not actually help you prep your house for sale, that\u2019s still on you, so the value here is minimal if anything at all. The most important things in my opinion are to DECLUTTER EVERYTHING and make sure the place is clean. Seriously, before you decide to put $5,000 into a bathroom or landscaping or whatever before you sell your place, consider renting a temporary storage unit and putting everything you don\u2019t absolutely need in there. I\u2019m talking couches, big furniture, stuff jammed in closets. Get rid of it all. \n* Marketing (Max value; $200) \u2013 You will need to have pictures and marketing copy to put your property on the MLS and other real estate websites. Your biggest cost here will be photography. You can find local photographers who focus on real estate who will charge you a completely reasonable rate. Photos are important, so I really don\u2019t recommend doing this on your own unless you really know what you\u2019re doing. Many agents even take photos of their properties themselves and they are terrible. As for copy, never in the history of real estate has excellent copy sold a home. You don\u2019t need to be Keats with your copy. Just the facts. Take a look at a few examples of other descriptions that you like on other homes and just use that same structure for your home. There are other details you\u2019ll need like number of beds/bathrooms etc. but you will already know that and the agent doesn\u2019t add any value there. You may have some additional investment in something like a $10 \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign or maybe something else but the days of agents incurring marketing costs to list your property in the newspaper are long gone yet the commission rate remains the same.\n* Listing on the MLS (Max value; $500) \u2013 This is one area you will need to hire a realtor for but you do not need to pay them 6% or sign a long-term contract with anyone. Look for a local agent or agency who offer flat fee service. For around $500, they will list your property on the local MLS. Once it\u2019s listed there, it will get picked up by all of the major real estate websites and added to their databases automatically. For this, it is important to find a local realtor rather than a faceless online entity because if you need to make changes to your listing for any reason, you will need a human being to be responsive to your needs.\n* Paperwork (Max value; $0-$1,000?) \u2013 Okay, so lots of flat-fee agents will also offer an option to buy standard real estate documents for your state. That\u2019s what you want. I don\u2019t recommend buying them online or trying to cobble together your own homemade contract because you can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s any good. Each state is different and the standard contracts are frequently updated. I recommend you ask your flat-fee agent for any paperwork you will need to list and sell your house. Agencies that specialize in flat-fee service will likely be able to explain each document to you as well to help you with that \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m looking at\u201d anxiety. Some of the forms can be intimidating but if you take your time with them and familiarize yourself with them before you have to fill them out, it\u2019s really not bad at all. Even if you\u2019re very worried about screwing this part up, you can just hire a real estate attorney to review your documents to make sure they\u2019re in line with what you want. It will be expensive, maybe up to $500/hour, but it will still save you money overall. Plus, an attorney is almost always better than an agent at getting these documents right.\nSo why is the commission so high? At one point, selling a house was a lot more work. Running newspaper ads, marketing houses, attracting buyers was kinda difficult. But the fact is that even back then, only a small portion of that commission ever went to the seller\u2019s agent him/herself. They split any commission they receive with a buyer\u2019s agent (50%) and their broker (usually 50% depending on the agent\u2019s deal with their broker) and they incurred costs along the way. Nowadays, they do not incur similar costs to market your property but the overhead of maintaining a brokerage still exists. Someone needs to cover the cost to keep the place going which includes high costs for attorney retainers and errors & omissions insurance for the agents in case they make a mistake. Since you are not a licensed professional, you do not need E&O insurance and if you want to consult an attorney, you can do so hourly instead of on a retainer.\n* **Total max value of agent's services if you hire individual professionals**: $2,100. Assuming that you are still offering 3% to a buyer's agent, your total max cost would be $8,100 on a $200,000 home. That's a savings of $3,900 over the standard 6% commission model but I honestly think most people will be able to do this for closer to $1,500-$1,700 though.\n\nBuying a home:\n\n**Why you think you need a buyer\u2019s agent:** - You may want a buyer\u2019s agent because you think they are free. After all, the seller\u2019s agent will split his/her commission with your agent, so it\u2019s no money out of your pocket. Or maybe you feel like you need someone to help you find the perfect home, or get you financing or maybe you just want someone to help you through the process. It can be nerve racking!\n\n**Why you don\u2019t:** - Buyer\u2019s agents are not free. Someone has to pay them and the cost always comes from somewhere. If there is no seller\u2019s agent, then you will likely be responsible for paying your agent out of your own pocket (read your agreement!!) If there is a seller\u2019s agent, then they will split their commission with the buyer\u2019s agent. However if there\u2019s a seller\u2019s agent and no buyer\u2019s agent, the seller\u2019s agent will often be willing reduce their commission by 50% and put that toward the home price. So if the seller is offering their agent 6% on a $200,000 house ($12,000), they can ask their agent to reduce the commission to 3% since they won\u2019t have to split it with a buyer\u2019s agent. Then, the seller can reduce their sale price of the home by $6,000 without affecting their out-of-pocket costs and the seller\u2019s agent still gets the 3% they would have gotten if they split it with your buyer\u2019s agent. Basically, you just saved $6,000 plus 30 years of interest on that money. The key here is to negotiate the price to as low as the seller will go, then ask for the agent to cut the commission. Otherwise, you can\u2019t be sure you\u2019re getting the bottom price. So if you want to buy a house without an agent, here\u2019s how to get (most of) the benefits without spending $6,000:\n\n* Find the perfect home (Max value; $0) \u2013 Trulia, Zillow, Realtor.com, whatever. Your agent doesn\u2019t have magical powers. You can find your own property just as easily and you run less of a risk of missing one that you want. You can set up alerts, too. In this case the agent is really only a middleman slowing down the process.\n* Coordinate showings (Max value; $500) \u2013 This is actually a pain in the butt if you\u2019re the type to look at a ton of houses but if you\u2019re smart about it, you can schedule multiple showings on the same day to keep things fairly easy. Like book yourself to look at three houses on Saturday instead of looking at them one at a time. It shouldn\u2019t take too long but if saving yourself a few phone calls to set up showings is worth $6,000 to you, then by all means hire an agent. Or, if you really like the frugal lifestyle while also living like a baller you could just hire a personal assistant online to handle that for you for probably around $30/hour or less. You could set up a TON of showings for well under $500.\n* Neighborhood awareness ($? - You decide value) \u2013 If you\u2019re moving across the country or otherwise unfamiliar with your new town, an agent may be worth the money for peace of mind but you'll need to decide if that's worth $6,000 to you. With the internet, a few hours of research will show you everything you might want to know. Determine what is important to you when finding a location and there's virtually nothing the agent can tell you that the internet won't tell you. Commute times, school districts, tax rates. All of that stuff is online.\n* Financial advice ($0) \u2013 Working with a mortgage broker (A broker is someone who works with multiple banks) or directly with a reputable bank will often provide you better advice than an agent. Most agents will just tell you to talk to the lender anyway. Tell them what you want to do with your home purchase and they will work it out with you.\n* Pricing advice (Max value; $400) \u2013 See explanation above. Also, you have the added benefit here if you are getting a mortgage that the bank will require an appraisal before you can get financed. In other words, it\u2019s nearly impossible to overpay for the home.\n* Answering questions/consulting ($1,000-? - You decide value) \u2013 Of all the reasons to have a buyer\u2019s agent, I think this is the best one. If you haven\u2019t purchased a home before, you will probably have a ton of questions and there is some real benefit to having someone on call that you trust to help you through your anxieties. If you don\u2019t have a friend or family member to do this with you and the prospect of buying a house is overwhelming to you, an agent may be worth the money just to ease your fears. That being said, if you buy a house from a seller with an agent who doesn\u2019t suck, that agent will be able to walk you through your issues too. There are even a lot of agents who would be happy to answer some of your simpler questions even though they won't get paid. Agents are generally a nice bunch of people who legitimately want to help. The only thing is you\u2019ll be on your own until you decide to put an offer in on a property but that\u2019s when you\u2019ll really need help. Up to that point, it\u2019s just arranging showings for the most part. Remember, the seller\u2019s agent wants the process to go as smoothly as you do. They will help you get your financing in order and help you work though all of the issues and questions you may have as you go along. But remember, the sellers agent really want you to buy that particular house so be sure to get a home inspection before you finalize your sale, even if you're buying a brand new house! It generally costs around $300 or so and it's always money well spent. Even if you hire an agent, though, you will still pay for this out of pocket, so you won't save any money here by having an agent. Also, you will want to buy standard home sale contracts for your state if the seller doesn't already have them and if you want to be totally sure your deal is air-tight, you can hire an attorney to review the contract before you submit it to the seller, though I believe that wouldn't be necessary unless there is no seller's agent at all.\n* **Total max value of agent's services if you hire individual professionals**: $1,900. \n\nOkay, I spent way too much time writing that and I\u2019m sure there are things I\u2019m leaving out and things I should have thought through better and other general errors, but I believe this would be a good start for anyone looking to save money buying or selling a home.\n\n*Edit: Okay, this got a lot bigger than I expected but I got tons of feedback and tried to reply to as many of the comments as I could. I encourage you to read through them for varying perspectives. First, it seems that many Realtors want me to clarify that there's a difference between excellent agents and \"bad\" ones. I agree that an excellent agent can be worth the money and may even pay for themselves in some situations but you have to decide what that's worth to you. I would also point out that I was a mediocre agent, not bad, but not great either. I would classify maybe 5% of agents as excellent. After that, there is a huge dropoff in quality (just my opinion from what I saw in my market) to people like me. What I'm telling you is that I believe that the work I did as a mediocre agent could be done by almost anybody else on their own with just a little bit of effort. When it comes to the value proposition, others have mentioned that some agents will list a property for a 4% commission. In that case, just calculate your savings from selling by yourself using similar math that I used above and decide if you think they're worth it. That said, it's been my experience that agents willing to cut their commissions to get listings aren't often the best in the area, so that might be a consideration too.*\n\n*As a final note, many people mentioned the company Redfin, which I hadn't heard of before but it seems pretty great on the surface. I have no experience with them, but it might be worth exploring for you.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/41p707/save_tons_of_money_when_sellingbuying_a_home/", "created_utc": 1453218321.0, "score": 3601, "author": "hulkster69", "num_comments": 440, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/41p707/save_tons_of_money_when_sellingbuying_a_home/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How I reduced my utilities by almost 80% - Attempt #2", "selftext": "Attempt #2 in writing this hopefully it goes through this time :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, so here is how I went on reducing my utilities by almost 80% and this is with starting from a lower base already vs average american house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe live in about 2200 sq ft of house, ranch style. Built in 1958, so lots of leaky. When I first moved in with my now wife, the average usage of utilities was the following:\n\n\\- Electricity 760 kWh/month\n\n\\- Gas (water and heat) - 820 therms annually\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's best to keep numbers in consumption than actuall dollars (although I provide those as well), since prices differ around the country and also with time. The average price in my area is about 12 cents per kWh in electricity and 1 dollar give or take per therm of NG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe live in the Northeast and Winters are cold - according to the average our winters are about 6100 Heating Degree Days and it gets hot and humid in summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what I did chronologically:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#1 - First move was to change all light bulbs to CFLs. This was in 2013 so LEDs were still very expensive at around 9-10$ per bulb. Since CFLs don't differ that much from power output from LEDs (maybe like 20%) it never made sense $$ wise to go for LEDs when CFLs were available at 1-2 dollars a pop. Before, the whole power output of light bulbs in the house was around 2000-3000 W... when all bulbs were changed the whole power output in the house sits around at 250-300W ... As an example, TODAY if we have the whole house with the lights on, it would use less energy than before when we had 3-5 lights on in the living room 6 hours a day or so. Cost on new lights = $70\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#2 - I am frugal (hence being here...or at least as my mother tells me I am Spartan. I don't mind paying for things of good quality), therefore the dumb thermostats never echoed with me. In 2013 I bought a NEST. At the time I believe NEST was the only wifi t-stat and while I know I could probably get by with a programmable thermostat, the designs were not that appealing and I liked having the wifi access anyhow. Of course I didn't buy it new. Bought it off of ebay in 2013 for about $95. It's been now almost 6 years, and never had an issue with it. It paid itself in no time. With the Nest I started putting the heat off whenever out of the house or at night (with setbacks in the mid 50s). This itself brought big savings in orders of 30-40% in heat. Cost = $95\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#3 Changing electrical suppliers - PA has a liberal market in the energy market, meaning you can choose who your supplier is from hundredds of suppliers. They website is pretty easy to navigate as well. Just input your zipcode and a lot of offers from different companies pop up. Just organize the list by Lowest Price to Highest and you're golden. You can usually get 20-35% lower prices than what the distribution company provides. These are all usually introductory offers for a limited amount of time (like 3, 6 or 12 months for example) so once that time expires just pop onto the website and go for the lowest offer again and jump to a different company. Been doing this for 4-5 years now and it takes maybe 10 minutes every 6 months. For those of you that use 1,000 or more kWh/month it's definitely worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#4 While renovating and redesigning our living room to open space, we had to put a beam and with this access to attic. While up there and since we had the whole thing torn apart we decided to add insulation. Being the perfectionist that I am, I didn't want to just spray insulation on top of what we had there (4-5 inches of loose fiberglass and some spaces even lacking). Air leaks and cracks, even when insulated on top, leak a lot of air, so I wanted to seal off everything. So, we removed all Fiberglass in trash bags by using a leaf blower in reverse and using flexible air ducts to bring all loose fiberglass downstairs to a big mesh bag. This enabled me to air seal all cracks, top plates and fan cans and light boxes from the attic. We decided to put about 18\" of cellulose on our attic for a total of about R65-R70.\n\nOur local Lowe's sold each bag at 12.95 dollars which is expensive IMO - we needed about 120 bags. A local store also had bags at about 8 dollars per bag if buying 100 of them, but Lowes had the FREE machine to spray the insulation which we needed. So I played the price match game with Lowes, where they priced matched it to 7,20 per bag and I also used they 50 off of 250 coupons in order to bring the price lower. Not only that, buying Lowes gift cards at 10-15% discount from 3rd party gift card markets brought it even lower, along with cashback portals. In the end we paid for each bag about $4,90/bag !! Also, our electrical supplier had and still has lots of rebates going for insulation improvements (it's always worth checking it out. I received an extra $130 from the electrical provider, but if my heat were to be electric as well, they would cover 80% of the cost up to 450 dollars, while in my case it was only 25% of the cost up to $130.\n\nTotal cost = $400\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#5 Fridge - we had an old fridge that came with the house when we bought it. I knew it was old from the start but not as old as I ended up finding. Great machine! Cooled things like no other fridge did and probably will outlast any of the new ones, but I digress. The fridge was built in either 1983 or 1992 judging from the serial number and a little bit of Google. I would honestly say it is a 1983. However that thing used about 3 kWh/day. It never made much sense to just buy a new one just for the sake of it, but we had it in the plans to buy one that would go with our renovation. And we did exactly that recently. We bought a nice European fridge from a warehouse at a steep discount and sold the other one on Craigslist for $230 dollars. In the end, the NET cost of the new fridge was $450. Best thing though, the new fridge only uses about 0.2-0.4 kWh per day !!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here's how much we used to spend on utilities before all this:\n\n\\- Old spending $2200/year give or take\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all the improvements we are now using only 190-200 kWh/month and this includes using dryer, landscape lights (LED of course) and cooking (we cook everyday) and having computer 24/7. Heat wise, this year we have only spent 200 therms of gas during an average winter of 6000 HDDs. Better yet, we don't have aggressive setbacks anymore. We keep the house always at 60F when sleeping or away, and around 68F when at home, so in essence we even increase indoor temps and the savings were that big!\n\nAlso, during the summer, while before the house used to get hot pretty quick, we can usually get by a full day without AC unless it's a heat wave of several days or the temps at night don't drop enough where opening windows and using fan would bring the temperatures lower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe new spending is therefore $750/year (already confirmed throguh the last 12 months). Consumption decrease almost 80% and spending almost 70%. There isn't much more we can save now. The only way, would be instead of having gas heat, change it to electricity through European multi-splits system, where we wouldn't need ducts and by being electricity we could drop the gas contract (which the customer charge is $17/month). The mini-split system would give both AC and Heat and since most of them have COP of 4 or higher it would end up being cheaper to use than NG (not by much though). But both our furnace and AC are pretty new - put in by prevous owner - installed around 2010 or so according to manufacture date of systems on their labels. Another way to save would be having a on-demand water heat but since ours is still pretty new it doesn't make sense to change as of now just to save some pennies. The same goes for windows (our windows while they are double pane they are crap) which would cost a lot just to save a couple dollars. Same for wall insulation - I'd love to insulate my walls - but when running the numbers and hassle of insulating the walls (which our house is lacking I am sure) it doesn't make sense. Our highest electric bill is about 40ish dollars in the summer and highest gas bill was 50 dollars back in Jan/February (coldest months)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3nw8u85bd131.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8c5786be735e757f9c6789120bf46efc5f68d1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd by these improvements instead of 3 tons of AC size, next time we need a new AC system, we can go by with only 1ton or 1.5 tons max which is crazy. And for all environmentalists out there, we are saving the planet 10 Metric tons (22,000 lbs) of CO2 emissions on a yearly basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo all this to say, that you dont need a lot of money to get big returns! For about $1000 (and this includes a new fridge) and a lot of DIY work and being smart on how you buy your materials, you can save a lot and increase the comfort of your home. It pays to check for rebates as well! And you don't need to have good wall insulation for the most part, most of the returns come from insulating the heck out of your attic! And you can totally use HDDs and current usage and estimate the savings before hand to see if it's worth it. I did mine and my estimates weren't that far off from what ended up being in reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this post will be of help to someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Woow guys.

{"title": "Husband spends 1/3 of our money on comic books", "selftext": "I often share advice here, but today it's me coming to you for perspective.\n\nMarried less than a year, and we don't have money troubles. I feel like this is more about ... Fairness? Common goals? Letting go of the past/sunk cost? For reference, were both about 40 y.o.\n\nI track spending pretty closely, though it's not like I reign in certain categories per se. More, I track it for knowledge. Husband says he's happy to let me do all the financial planning, since I'm so good at it. He's said he wants me to help us reach our discussed common goals and be secure. The last thing I want is to be a new wife who says he can't go to Cons or hang out at the board game store and play tournaments or whatever. But there's this comic thing he has. We're paying $100/month for a climate-controlled storage closet to store these. He spends about 1/3 of our disposable income per month on them. He brings home a few boxes from the comic store, and then the box(es) go unsorted into the storage locker. In the year we've been together, I've never once seen him read a comic book.\n\nHe says he has this vision that once we have a house with more room, he'll sort them and read entire series. I get it. I love reading. But he's spending more than our rent each month on this collection. And when he had a larger place all to himself, he didn't have them sorted then, either.\n\nI love that he's a nerd. I wouldn't have it any other way. If he lives for 80 more years, I can't imagine he'll read half of them, if any. Money could go to debt, or retirement, or joint purchases/goals. Keep in mind, this money he spends on these is in addition to his disposable spending on other things/hobbies. On average, his hobby spending is half the monthly cost of the comics. I mean, I get it. He doesn't buy lots of clothes or shoes or makeup or cigarettes or drugs. But it's not like I can spend an equivalent amount on MY hobbies or interests, because we couldn't afford it.\n\nHow do you talk to someone who's self identity is almost tied up in these that it's ok to not finish collecting the entire series for each of these? How do you talk about how he's not betraying that 13-y.o. version of himself that found his only solace in comics? How can I explain how out of proportion the spending is to other things? \n\nIf the bills are paid on time, and the CC balances aren't going up, he emotionally sees no reason to not spend like this. \n\nI'm here to listen. I'm here to get other perspectives. We've never fought about this, and I doubt we ever will. But I wanted to have another conversation with him, and I was hoping to come to it with some fresh insight and ways I can compromise.\n\nEdit: some clarifications (1) I earn half the family income (2) I should have technically said \"discretionary\" spending, which is different than disposable (3) He spends on average 50% of the discretionary spending on his hobbies (2/3 of which is this comics collection), leaving 25% for \"us\" things like vacations and gifts, etc, and 25% my hobbies/personal spending.\n\nThank you everyone for all the insights and ideas. I appreciate it immensely.\n\nXpost to r/hoarding https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/dc9hgf/xpost_from_frugal_husband_spends_13_of_our", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/dbvqal/husband_spends_13_of_our_money_on_comic_books/", "created_utc": 1569946724.0, "score": 3525, "author": "AmNotLost", "num_comments": 802, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/dbvqal/husband_spends_13_of_our_money_on_comic_books/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Some thoughts on weddings, from someone who's been to over 40 of them.", "selftext": "So for a bit of background, I'm a wedding photographer. Including weddings I've attended I've been to 40, maybe nearer 50 weddings. I've seen the best and the worst.\n\nOne of the things I've noticed is that there is really no correlation between cost spent and the \"quality\" or enjoyment of the wedding. The best wedding I ever shot was a 400+ person, fairly boujee wedding. The couple was amazing, though, incredibly genuine, and had great family. I teared up during their dance.\n\nThe second best wedding I shot was about 60 people. The bride had a hookup on a nice small venue that she and her sister decorated themselves with homemade centerpieces made from lavender and other less expensive plants, they rented speakers and hooked up a laptop with a spotify playlist their friends curated together, they got food catered and aunties made desserts. This wedding was a r/frugal pipe dream guys.\n\nBut it was awesome, because the bride and groom were so into it and genuine, they have great friends, they partied, and families were sweet. \n\nSo after being to so many weddings and seeing cookie cutter stuff, unique, cheap, expensive, my thoughts really are that regardless of what you spend, how big it is, what the venue looks like, the best weddings are between two people who care about each other and just want to celebrate one another and their family. That's it. Everything else is extra. \n\nI realize I'm preaching to the choir on this sub, but who knows who needs to hear it.\n\nMore specifically, here are some things I think are and aren't worth it, assuming you've set a budget and are having a wedding-wedding.\n\nWorth it:\n\n* A decent photographer, if you want one at all. I realize phones are so good now and some people are cool with just asking family to take photos, but if you do want a photographer get someone solid. It doesn't have to be a $10,000 luxury photog who sends you a leather bound book, but if you're going to pay your 15 year old artist niece or nephew $200 to do it, just stick with the phones.\n\n* Tailoring for a suit. You don't have to spend a lot nowadays to get a suit that fits. Assuming you're going traditional, spend enough to get a plain black suit that's tailored to you and fits well. Fit is so much more important than the materials themselves. Keeping it simple means you can wear that suit for any other occasion that requires it. Also, if you're buying more affordable shoes, consider an in-sole because you'll be standing all day.\n\n* Gifts for your groomsmen/bridesmaids. They don't have to be anything fancy at all, but I do think it's really sweet and a nice start to the day. This is totally my personal opinion though.\n\n* Good food. Again, you don't have to spend a ton (I've had people get food trucks for weddings, costs $20-40 a head and some of them are *bomb*). But low quality food can be a big damper on the day. \n\n* Desserts in some form (homemade is great if you have the ability) and some fun late night food. Some pizzas or something late at a wedding while people are drunk dancing is always a hit.\n\n* EDIT: A lot of comments about day-of planners with positive reviews. Apparently worth it!\n\nNow, a few things that are less worth it if you're trying to stick to a budget, imo:\n\n* A videographer. I promise I'm not biased here - high quality video work that you'll actually want to watch again can be so expensive, and how often will you really watch it vs wedding photos you can put up on a wall? If you really want some recordings, this is a good time to ask Uncle Darren to put his DSLR up on a tripod at the back of the venue during your ceremony. Your friends will probably take videos of the night festivities.\n\n* Fancy dresses, shoes, suits. Everyone is different on this but the fit of your clothes, your smile, your compatibility matter so much more. No one will see your fancy shoes with a huge dress anyway. \n\n* Open bar. A lot of people are doing toonie bars (I'm Canadian :) ) which I think is super cool. Charging $7 for a beer is super lame as if you're trying to make money, but $2 for a beer is just covering your cost so your wild cousin Tina doesn't dry up your bank account.\n\n* Crazy decorations. It's such a short period of time, and people will be drunk before too long. Keep it classy and simple. \n\n* A wedding planner shouldn't be necessary if you're keeping it small and are relatively organized. \n\n* Crazy cakes. You're gonna chop it up. Towers of cupcakes or donuts are very common nowadays and are awesome. Get cheap toppers from a party store and you're in business.\n\n* A DJ. They can get so pricey nowadays. Bands, imo, are worth it if they're in your budget because it's such a fun experience, but DJs less-so in my opinion. Find a trustworthy family member or two to emcee and load up a Spotify playlist with your friend. Speakers and DJ lights can be rented locally in most cities. \n\n\nThat's all I've got. This ran way longer than I anticipated but I hope someone can get some use out of it. Feel free to ask about any elements of the day you're wondering about, or what else may or may not be worth it.

{"title": "Wife and I vacationed 8 days in Ireland for $2,500 (air fare included). And we could have spent less!", "selftext": "I took a shot at planning our first overseas vacation rather than booking through a company. If you're looking to save money, and still do a lot of stuff this is the way to go. First, I'll give you a break down of the costs then discuss each thing.\n\nTo be clear, we did not skimp on experiences. We went to five different cities on the Eastern, Southern, and Western coast of Ireland. We went to 6 different castles, we went to the Cliffs of Moher, traveled to the Wicklow Mountains, St Kevin's cathedral and the Glendalough. It was quite an adventure for the money. \n\nAir fare - $1200\nNightly accommodations (8 nights) - $580\nCar rental (4 days) - $160\nFood/Snacks/Beer - $300\nPublic transportation - $120\nShopping/tours/sight seeing - $200\n\nAir fare: $600 per ticket seems low, but we found several flights to Dublin for under $400. In fact, I recently booked tickets to Dublin for a guys trip in September for $325 out of Boston. Patience and Google Flights are key. If you're interested to know more let me know but there are a lot better resources on flying cheap than me. \n\nNightly accommodations: This could have been a lot lower, but we booked four different bed & breakfasts around Ireland.  We booked 2 nights at a hotel and stayed one night in a hostel. The key for us was booking places that served breakfast. Yes, I ate traditional Irish breakfast every single day. \n\nCar rental: We took public transportation for 4 days and rented a car for 4 days. Booking in advance is your friend. If you book 2+ months out, we were seeing $30 a day everywhere. \n\nFood/snacks/beer: $300 seems low, but remember we ate breakfast at the hotel. For lunch, we usually popped into a grocery store and picked up chips/sandwhich/drink combo for $4. We had a nice dinner out 4 out of the 7 nights we were there and just got pizza or fast food other 3 nights. After we rented a car we picked up $30 in snacks which held us over for in between meals rest of the trip. My wife doesn't drink and all, and beer was so expensive I took it kind of easy on the sauce. \n\nPublic transportation: Ireland's public transport is fire. For $20 each you can get a 72 hour unlimited pass for Dublin which let's you take trains and busses. We took the train to a suburb on the Eastern coast called Howth. It was a beautiful little harbor town. We took public busses from Kilkenny to Waterford, Waterford to Cork and Galway to Dublin. Total cost for all that mentioned was only $120. Students in Ireland get free public transportation. \n\nShopping tours sightseeing: Ireland allows you to buy something called a Heritage card, which is good for a year. Allows you to see 80+ attractions in Ireland. They're about $50 each. Entry to most of the sites are north of $15 so well worth it. Also most museums are free in Ireland. As mentioned wife and I did several castles and tours with the heritage card. And they're not stupid places either, these sites are some of the best Ireland had to offer. \n\nI decided to post this because we've been married 16 years and always assumed overseas travel was cost prohibitive.

{"title": "A method I use to 'scratch' the itch for a \"new thing\"", "selftext": "So, sometimes I feel like I \"need\" something new -- sometimes I'm attracted to improved features, or feel like I'm missing out or whatever. It happens to most of us. This is what I do instead:\n\nI deep clean the thing I already own, make repairs, even paint or customize it if that would make it better.\n\nFor example, I've had the itch to get a new vehicle. But, instead, I really detailed the car with good-quality products. The dog had made a mess of the backseat cushions. I took them entirely out and scrubbed them down, let them dry in the sun to get rid of dog odor. I buffed out some scratches, got the windows almost invisible, oil hinges, even cleaned out the trunk area. There was almost no dog hair, dust, or dirt anywhere. Sure there were some 'character marks' but once the car was deep cleaned and shiny (and smelling good, because I put in a brand new air freshener) it really scratched that itch for 'new shiny.'\n\nI've done this with appliance and kitchen stuff, shoes... you name it, I've done it. I was feeling some sewing machine envy the other day, but I broke out the toolbox instead and got my machine up to snuff and moving smoothly. Boom, desire gone.\n\nETA: sometimes I'm really attracted to a feature on a product -- like an ice maker or some other 'convenience.' When it's feature envy, I always try to figure out a way to rig-up that feature. In my case -- I only want ice for a few months out of the year.

We thought we were overspending because of eating out a lot. Instead, it was because bad meal planning meant we were wasting a ton of the food that we bought at the grocery store or not paying attention to cheaper alternatives for meals or individual ingredients. Better grocery store buying habits accounted for $300 of the $400 saved.\n\nThe other unexpectedly simple step was to print out the recipes we liked instead of just, say, bookmarking them online.

The problem is, I don't think they realize the costs of living here, and I don't know if it would be rude to point it out? We're saving up for a house so we are being quite frugal (although we are never uncomfortable, we naturally are rather minimalistic).\n\nThe main problem is heating: it is normal where we live to have 18C (64.6F) inside in winter (at night even 16C /60.7F). Our guests claim this is to little to be comfortable and keep turning on the heating which is really, really expensive (central heating). The same goes about using hot water. We take 5 min warm showers. Our visitors take even 30 min ones, with much higher heat. Or brush their teeth with the tap open, hot water running...\n\nOne the one hand, I would like my guests to be comfortable, on the other, these costs rise very high very fast. When we had visitors in winter, they staid for 5 days, and our heating bill more than tripled for the entire month! Last week, my husbands friend visited - she claimed to be cold at night even though it was 22C/71.6F in the room at the coldest point, and I gave her 3 comforters. I'm not proud of myself but I told her that the heating works only in the winter months, so that she would not use it... \n\nThis gives me real anxiety about money. How do you handle such situations? Do you just not invite people? Are you upfront about frugality? Or do you just go with it and ignore the extra costs? \n\nEDIT:\nThanks to everyone who replied with tips and shared their experiences! I did not expect that many replies. It seems like people are more or less divided between \n\na) being upront with the rules, and \n\nB) witholding from hosting until I can accommodate my guests fully. \n\nI feel like I should limit my guests to the ones I feel comfortable to do A) with, and otherwise I will go with B).\n\nReplying to the comments made me realize that I may be used a bit by some of my \"friends\", and that the way some of them behave is not acceptable to me.

The standard method is to take the price per pound and divide it by 16.  iow, at $5/lb, we calculate 500 cents divided by 16.  \n  \nBut that's a lot of math at 5:00 pm in the meat aisle.  Even I want to give up half way through.  \nIt's actually far easier and quicker to multiply the $/lb by 6.25\n\nSo, 5 x 6.25 = 31.25 - which is the price per ounce.\n\nTo make it even easier (and just get a ball park number), skip the .25 and quick calc 5 x 6, which is 30 - and then add a penny or two.  (Strictly speaking you need to add a penny for every $4/lb).  \n  \nYeah, I know these days everyone has a calculator on their phone, but with a bit of practice, you can do the mental math far quicker than digging out your cell phone - even if it's a fractional price at say $5.50/lb.  \n  \nAnd besides, it'll do you good to exercise that big ol brain once in a while.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k8mtl1/frugality_tip_quick_mental_math_to_compare_lb_to/", "created_utc": 1745700506.0, "score": 35, "author": "RockMo-DZine", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k8mtl1/frugality_tip_quick_mental_math_to_compare_lb_to/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Dishwashers Using Less Water than Handwashing is a Myth", "selftext": "When they say how much water is being used when hand washing compared to dishwashing, I think numbers are artificially inflated. I think they\u2019re are three types of handwashers they consider in these studies with inflated numbers. \n\nThe first being the most egregious, people who let the water run continuously while washing and scrubbing, only turning it off when all the plates are clean. No wonder they use more water. \n\nThe second is also something I\u2019m not a fan of and it\u2019s filling the sink full of water and cleaning dirty dishes in there. Personally, I just think it\u2019s icky, but beyond that, it uses a lot of water to fill up the sink.\n\nThe third is people who only turn the tap on to rinse. This is fine, but the way people end up using more water washing dishes like this is by running the tap at full power. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think the studies that show dishwashers use less water are a myth, or at the very least, misleading. You don\u2019t need to keep water running when you wash. And you don\u2019t need especially high pressure to rinse suds off. Even the tap opened a quarter of the way and running down the plate will get rid a lot of the suds in one go.\n\nTo test this, I ran an experiment. My dishwasher model will use 3 gallons of water in a cycle. But using this method to hand wash dishes, the amount of plates I needed to wash to use up 3 gallons in the sink were 8 Large plates and 12 small plates. \n\nI understand how a dishwasher can be convenient, but the saying that it uses less water than handwashing were probably studies paid for by dishwashers companies that I\u2019m surprised more people have not caught on to. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k7e7dg/dishwashers_using_less_water_than_handwashing_is/", "created_utc": 1745562384.0, "score": 0, "author": "Anonythrowthetrash", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k7e7dg/dishwashers_using_less_water_than_handwashing_is/", "html_title": ""}

I have found that this has changed how comfortable I am going to events like my kids sporting events at night, walking my dogs, or even just how often I turn the heat on in the house anymore, which is rarely to never.\n\nThey come with a rechargeable battery pack that lasts for a few hours at a time and can double as a portable phone charger. I recommend them to everybody. I have bought them for multiple family members. They're not the most stylish, but man do they do the job. \n\nEDIT: since so many have asked, the brand we have purchased and recommend is Ororo!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k30tcu/a_heated_vest_changed_my_life/", "created_utc": 1745081782.0, "score": 3026, "author": "CertainDamagedLemon", "num_comments": 189, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k30tcu/a_heated_vest_changed_my_life/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "An exercise in practical frugality (Potatoes)", "selftext": "Here in drought stricken Austin, Texas, the least cost potatoes are Russets.\n\nA 5lb bag of  normal/small spuds runs at around $0.51 /lb, while an 8lb bag of much larger 'king size/baking' tubers is around $0.70 /lb.  **A $0.19 /lb difference**.   But, which is the more frugal option?\n\nAt first blush, and strictly on a price/lb initial basis, the big ones are more expensive per pound.  But there are some other considerations.\n\nSmaller spuds require a lot more peeling, scraping, or scrubbing (depending on one's spud prep preference and purpose) and this means more produce waste, effort and time.\n\nSmaller ones also seemed to have more issues than larger ones - leading to more effort cleaning and resulting waste.  And perhaps more importantly, they seem to degrade much quicker - even if stored in the fridge.\n\nLong story short, after two months of comparing each, that initial $0.19 price dif /lb dropped significantly - to less than $0.06 /lb - because of additional waste and storage decay. \n\nOn balance, the smaller ones were still cheaper, but they took longer to prep and soon became an annoying chore.  Obviously, people value their time differently, so that's a difficult factor to cost, but it was usually about 20% longer prepping the smaller spuds.\n\nFor me, the (now only slightly) more expensive bigger units are the preferred choice, mainly because of the time it takes to prep.\n\nBut, I thought it worthwhile offering an example of where cheaper is not always more frugal, depending upon one's specific circumstances.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k1r5pd/an_exercise_in_practical_frugality_potatoes/", "created_utc": 1744933439.0, "score": 475, "author": "RockMo-DZine", "num_comments": 84, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k1r5pd/an_exercise_in_practical_frugality_potatoes/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "If you make cold-brew coffee, you can use the grounds twice", "selftext": "The title pretty much says it all, but here's more details: \n\nI switched from hot to cold-brewed coffee a few months before covid shut things down in March 2020. I first tried it when I found a *very* cheap bottle of cold-brew concentrate in Kroger's clearance section, and liked it so much better than hot-brew coffee, I immediately set about trying to make my own. I ended up buying specialized cold-brew pitchers (about $15 each at the time, IIRC), and through trial and error discovered that for daily cold-brew drinkers, the ideal minimum number of pitchers to have is three: one you're currently drinking from; one where the coffee is steeping but not ready to drink yet; and a third so you have time to wash a newly empty pitcher before refilling it with coffee grounds and water to steep. \n\nThe minimum time for steeping is supposed to be 24 hours, but mine will sometimes sit for several days before I drink it, depending on how long it takes me to finish whatever pitcher I'm currently drinking from.\n\nMost \"how to make cold brew coffee\" recipes will tell you to remove the grounds before you start drinking, and I followed that instruction the first few times I made it, but one morning I was in a rush and had no time to empty the grounds first. Made no difference in the quality or taste of the resulting brew, so now I leave them in the whole time I'm drinking from that pitcher. (Grounds are in a mesh cylinder suspended in the middle of the pitcher.) Then, when I finish a \"fresh\" pitcher of coffee, I refill it with water and let it steep again, for several days, while I drink from the newest pitcher.\n\nA cup of \"first-run\" cold-brew coffee is strong enough that I dilute it with chilled water before adding the cream and sugar. I keep a jug of water in the fridge next to the cold-brew pitchers specifically for this purpose. A cup of \"second-run\" coffee is definitely weaker; I drink that \"straight\" rather than add water first. Also, while 24 hours is the minimum steeping time for cold-brew coffee made of fresh grounds, for a second-run you'll want to let it steep at least twice as long. Mine steeps for a few days, however much time it takes for me to finish a pitcher.\n\n(I once experimented with trying a third brew with the grounds, but it's not worth it; no matter how many days you let it steep, after two cold brewings there just isn't enough left in the grounds to get a drinkable third batch from it. Two brewings is the most you can get from a given amount of ground coffee, and still hope to get a drinkable cup of cold brew.)\n\nOne other thing that might be relevant: whether I'm making a first-run or second-run batch, I don't pour the water directly into the pitcher; instead, I pour it (*very* slowly) directly into that mesh cylinder filled with coffee grounds, so that every drop of water has to work its way through the grounds before making it into the cylinder itself.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k30uag/if_you_make_coldbrew_coffee_you_can_use_the/", "created_utc": 1745081856.0, "score": 0, "author": "Jennifer_Junipero", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k30uag/if_you_make_coldbrew_coffee_you_can_use_the/", "html_title": ""}

Do this like once a month, not every week. TOTAL: $10 for me AND my wife.\n\n\\#4 - Panda Express  \nAgain, not the most healthy, but you get quite a bag for your buck meal at PE.

To know. youre at an authenic Viet spot is if an old viet lady is running the cash register and there's a mop bucket near the restroom area. TOTAL: Me and my wife usually spend $16-20 on banh mi and it's fill us up til late nite.\n\n\\#2 - Salad-n-Go  \nMy wife and I just started going to this quickie salad spot. It hits ALL varibles: taste, price, fillingness, healthy, and FAST as a bonus variable. So far Ive only eaten the wraps there, but theyre are GOOD. They also have very healthy juices there for only like $2. I can have a large wrap and juice solo for under $10. I been here maybe 4times already and is well worth it. TOTAL: Me and the wife spend tops $20 when we go.\n\n\\#1 - Chitpotle  \nChitpotle is very good for hacking. Prices are already pretty fair, but if you know how to hack you can get for super cheap. Plus we all know its good, filling and pretty healthy where u dont feel all greasy and sleepy after u eat it. By hacking prices, I mean download their app and order everything as a side along with some tortillas. go home and make your own buritto and youll be able to make TWO burritos for about $10-$15 bucks and again, thats for TWO ppl! a true value and hits ALL varibles while going under $20 range.\n\n\\*BONUS: CocoShrimp  \nthere's this place here called cocoshrimp, where it's just shrimp with rice or as a taco. If the wife and i feel like spluring a lil more than usual, we go here. EXTREMELY filing, delicious, pretty healthy and worth the value becasue u get a lot of food. It's about $25-30 for TWO ppl.\n\nWe go to one of these places, prob once every weekend. NEVER UberEats/ food deliver these food to you. the upcharge and fee markup is TOO crazy.

{"title": "10 ways to use an on sale Easter ham", "selftext": "I love holidays surrounding a specific food that immediately goes on sale and Easter is no different since spiral cut ham is so easy to deal with. These are a list of things I do with a ham as one person living alone to make it go the farthest, cheapest, with minimal waste. One ham I\u2019ll typically take 3-4 months to finish completely as I stagger eating it with other things of course feel free to add suggestions, I am literally always looking to up my cheap food prep variety game. In case you haven\u2019t prepped and stored a ham before, this tends to take the better part of an afternoon so I suggest either a full day youre off work dedicated or a full evening when you don\u2019t have to work the next day! Even if it\u2019s only a couple hours of active hamming, there\u2019s cleanup and the exhaustion at least I feel after such a task. \n\nTo get ready, you will need: your ham, some white beans, onion, garlic, a few herbs/spices, water, bread, condiments you prefer.\n\n1. Obv- eat some ham! Enjoy a nice meal, warm it up, make a nice side or two it is tasty. \n\n2. First, deconstruct the ham. Take off all the slices and REALLY try to scrape off the bone. Get as much as possible, I use my freshly washed hands. Get all the slices and divide up the ham between chunks and slices. Separate the slices to make sandwiches and grilled cheese. I freeze them in packs of 2-4 servings depending on your food prep habits. Then the larger chunks separate for other uses and keep the bones until we make soup. I also separate out the pieces that are very fatty or very small. And I pay the ham tax to my cat I know she doesn\u2019t need the salt but she only understands the language of singular tiny tiny snack. \n\nNow for the uses! \n\n1. Just to eat, girl dinner it up and just crack open a container and eat a slice of ham. It\u2019s cooked, fast, and easy. (Slices or chunks) if you like ham, this may be the only time you wanna just snack on some slices for a while. \n\n2. Fry it with eggs (or not these days lol) for breakfast. (I prefer slices) see also making a breakfast skillet! \n\n3. Fry it to top salads with or put it on salads out of the fridge or slightly warm or whatever you prefer. (Slices or chunks) \n\n4. Rice porridge! Rice porridge is GREAT and with some ham, render some fat from the ham and fry a couple pieces in the same pot youll be making the porridge in, it gives a little extra flavor. Dice up the pieces you fried and put them on top or stir them in. You can dice as much or as little as you want.  (Fatty chunks) \n\n5. Sandwiches or quesadillas: sorry if this is sacrilegious, a tortilla is the perfect bread and a cheese and ham quesadilla is delightful to me. See also, loaded grilled cheeses. (Slices)\n\n6. My favorite- ham and beans! This is where the bone comes in! Dice an onion roughly, chop a BUNCH of garlic, soak or not some white beans (the whole thing needs to be cooked for so long anyway), and that\u2019s the basis for ham n beans. You put the bone and any scrap-looking ham chunks into a pot (I use my instant pot), cover with water, add herbs you like and let it cook low and slow as long as possible. It is so good, the broth ends up so thick a truly it freezes perfectly, it may even be better rewarded than fresh and white beans cost so little even now. Eat with cornbread if possible. (The bone and bone trimmings). Any little piece clinging to the bone will fall off in this. Can freeze indefinitely tbh and you can make it go a LONG way \n\n7. Ham pot pie- whatever veggies you have and use ham in the filling idk how but it works.\n\n8. Baked potato topping - this feels similar to a salad topping but it feels different enough to me to stay interesting. Cook up some chunks of ham and go wild on a baked potato. Also works great imo in basked potato soup. \n\n9. Fried rice with ham as the protein\n\n10. Ham hand pies - these can be as veggie-forward or ham and cheese forward as you want, I like mine ham and cheesey but have done both. \n\n\nObviously this all takes time, but once you portion out the ham and make the ham n beans (or other soup I guess) it really is minimal work for each dish. If you don\u2019t like ham, no need to let me know. I am also aware that some of these recipes swap in ham in ways people may find off putting- I am not saying this is the only way to make this or even that you should, these are just all things I\u2019ve done with a ham and enjoyed and made it feel less like eating ham sandwiches every day- tho I did that many days. Do with this what you will, just my two cents I hope I helped even one person with this:)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k1vwju/10_ways_to_use_an_on_sale_easter_ham/", "created_utc": 1744948656.0, "score": 1, "author": "r1ceandbeans", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k1vwju/10_ways_to_use_an_on_sale_easter_ham/", "html_title": ""}

Its not a huge saving as tea bags are not that expensive, but this is also the same principle as the razors, I can get a superior product for cheaper. I see no drawbacks. I put a teaspoon of tea leaves in my little tea holder thingy, and I can get a liter of strong tea.\n\nThere are a lot of frugal things/strategies that can save you money.

{"title": "Shopping around for car insurance is a fantastic way to reduce your monthly expenses", "selftext": "I know that this might be common knowledge, but it should be emphasized. It is too easy to become comfortable with your insurer and be slow to look at other options, even if they are hiking your premiums. I delayed getting quotes until my increased payment was coming due and I really didn\u2019t want to pay it.\n\nProgressive raised my monthly premium from $119 to $160 when my first 6-month plan with them renewed recently. A 25% increase was shocking to me, idk if that is normal for policy renewals but damn. This was the absolute bare bones policy too. First car, bought it outright and plan to drive it until it gives out. It\u2019s a great car but it\u2019s not worth anything, at least in regard to comprehensive/collision. The deductibles would take over half of the ACV. \n\nI went to go browse new insurance quotes and got a few from a quote site. I picked Progressive first so to see what they\u2019d say. Surprisingly, I got a much better policy for 27% less than my older shittier policy. I went from:\n\n- No underinsured/uninsured bodily injury coverage to 25k/50k\n\n- 25k/50k/15k liability to 25k/50k/50k\n\n- 5k medical payments to 10k\n\nI know it\u2019s not an impressive policy but it works for my circumstances and is drastically better than my previous policy. It\u2019s likely it will comfortably protect me if an accident were to happen and that\u2019s all I really need. $160 to $116 is no joke, especially in the uncertain times of today. \n\nAll it took was filling out a few online quotes, seeing that I could get better coverage for less than I\u2019m paying now, and checking if Progressive had anything better to offer. Just had to call them up, give them the quote number, start the policy, cancel the old one. I\u2019m astounded by how easy it was. Took 45 minutes max. \n\nIt may not work for all, but I recommend looking! Cancellations are often no-penalty, some have a flat charge (around $50).

(E.g., I food prep to go anywhere, I decline long-distance driving, I decline spending money on events unless I want to do them, etc). I have self-reflected on how much money I have spent over the years in social settings for things I truly didn't want to do... and it makes me SMH.\n\nNow, I'm not a social pariah, per say, but I turn down a lot of paid social gatherings with this thought process. Do I genuinely want to do xyz social event? No \u27a1\ufe0f OK, I won't pay because I don't want to do it. Or do I want to spend money on xyz social event? Not really \u27a1\ufe0f Ok, then just don't do it or go.\n\nSo I paid to attend a Bible Study. You purchase the book and study videos. One day, they hosted a potluck prior to the event. So to not look like an AH, I went out and bought food to bring to the event.  However, the host announced that we are having another potluck next time AND a surprise birthday party.

{"title": "Stop buying band-aids and make your own, its way better and not hard", "selftext": "Band-aids are one of those things that aren't necessarily expensive to begin with, but you always seem to need more of them, and its a drag to go out and buy them. Especially when you need a specific shape or size and wow look you only have the crappy small ones and also you're in a bad mood from getting cut or whatever.\n\nAll you need are gauze pads, which my local grocery store has a pack of 25 for $4.75, and [3M Micropore Tape](https://www.exmed.net/3m-micropore-paper-tape) which is like less than a dollar for a roll.\n\nThe gauze pads are folded into 8 squares, and I can cut one out and fold it up to make the absorbent pad. Then i stick it on a length of the micro pore tape.\n\nThis is beyond superior for numerous reasons:\n\n1. Way cheaper. The two items listed above total less than 6 dollars, which is just a bit cheaper than a pack of 30 band-aids. With just one box of gauze and one roll of tape, there is enough to make *at least* 200 bandages, and that's with generous helpings of gauze and tape. Even the 100 pack of assorted shapes and sizes is like 11 bucks at my grocery store. This is a no brainer already.\n2. Way more performant: Each 1/8th square of gauze folds up into a considerably thicker and softer pad than a regular band aid. It's more absorbent and covers a wider area by default. They stick better to your skin. You never need to do that thing where you realize its peeling off and stick it back down and hope it stays till you get back home.\n3. Plays better with water: lets be real here: unless you're using those space-age TegaDerm things, band aids aren't water resistant at all. When they do get wet, they either fall off or get gross as hell. I've showered with my makeshift bandages and they dry out quickly and don't get gross. I actually have to remember to change them out because of how well they hold up.\n4. More customizable. Since you make it yourself, you can just make it whatever shape you want. You can make it as big or as small as you want. You will never again look through your medicine cabinet and realize you need to drop 10 bucks on another box of the big ones.\n5. Sustainable: Its cotton and paper. Completely biodegradable. Regular band-aids are usually plastic, so you might as well go for the option that will break down and return to nature.\n6. For what it's worth, its easier to take off. It rips easier for when its wrapped around your finger, and it doesn't hurt when you pull it off sensitive skin.\n\nPersonally, I notice this all the time. Things purpose-made for convenience aimed at the consumer market are usually not that much more convenient at all, and are actually quite crap. As soon as you look a little bit further than the grocery store shelf, a world of opportunity opens up.

You can also make your own potting mix with a 1:1:1 mix of vermiculite or perlite, peat moss or coco coir, and compost.  Aim for 5 different kinds of compost if possible.  There is no shame in buying premixed soil!  Don't make this difficult!\n\nFertilizer.  Unless you buy the pre-fertilized bags, you will need fertilizer.  Plants really don't care where their nutrients come from, so you don't have to use organic, but that's an option you can choose.  Follow label directions.  Some plants, like tomatoes, need a little bit more help, like bone meal.  \n\nYou can buy seeds or plants from a nursery.  The frugal way, of course, is seeds.  But if you're starting out with one or two grow bags, a plant start from the nursery is perfectly acceptable.  \n\nIt's smart to know what pests want to eat your plants.  There are lots of simple things that work, like neem oil.  Insect netting is great for plants that don't need to be pollinated, like kale.  \n\nSoil, food, sunshine, and water.  People have been growing food for thousands of years.  You can too.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1jra6yv/im_a_hobby_gardener_heres_the_easy_way_to_grow/", "created_utc": 1743768242.0, "score": 173, "author": "sbinjax", "num_comments": 52, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1jra6yv/im_a_hobby_gardener_heres_the_easy_way_to_grow/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Keeping special occasions costs reasonable, is it frugal or cheap?", "selftext": "I believe an elegant restaurant meal is an enjoyable part of being frugal. You get to enjoy what you want because you've budgeted elsewhere. However, I'm wondering if I've taken being frugal too far. \n\nLast year, was his my mother-in-law's and our first year without my partner, her son. She wanted to scatter his ashes with us and chose the timing to be near mother's day.  My kids had planned to cook for me at home since our son was still in college. The budget had been tight the last few years since I stopped working while taking care of him, but my partner had always loved nice restaurants. He was a foodie.  I wanted my MiL to still feel celebrated for mother's day. I also knew, the scattering would be a hard week for us all. \n\nSo, I bought Morton's gift cards for $325 for the $500 value ($65/100 for each card) when they were on sale at Costco.  We used them to take my MiL, myself, my son, and daughter-in-law for dinner for Mother's Day.\n\nUsing the gift cards, I only had to tip (at the full $500 bill), and that was basically free.  So, I had $625 for a $450 financial outlay.\n\nWas it cheap or frugal?\n\nI ask, because I thought the overall cost to purchase ratio made it frugal for a special occasion.

I even managed to pay off about 40k in debt between mid 2015 and mid 2018 making less than 30k pre tax. I had the luxury of living with family for free and having two jobs which made that possible.\n\nHowever, after I was able to shift to a higher paying career I essentially doubled my income overnight in 2019. I could afford to exist for a change and went overboard. Now in 2025 I make (barely) six figures and I'm struggling to shift back to a more frugal lifestyle.

{"title": "Saving money with other people?", "selftext": "One thing I hardly ever see discussed in the big \"how to save money\" threads are ways to work with other households to save money. How do you and your friends or family work together to save? I have a few, but I'd love to hear from other people!\n\nWITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\n* **Set up a family phone plan with friends -** I pay about $35/mo for an unlimited data plan because I have eight people on my phone plan. You need reliable people, but this is great because 1) you get the credit card points 2) your friends/family are outsourcing having to deal with the phone company for travel, renegotiating contracts, etc. 3) if someone in your life is on a weird pay schedule, they can negotiate what day of the month they pay their bill. \n* **Clothing swaps -** once or twice a year a few ladies and I will get together and shop each other's donation piles. One person is designated as host and another as the donation person who will take the rest of the stuff to the thrift store. \n* **Borrow instead of buy -** Again, you do need reliable friends for this! But it is a huge money, time, and space saver in an apartment. Who has a sewing machine? A shop vac? An angle grinder? Hair clippers? A portable stove? A cat carrier? I assume most people already do this to some degree, but there are so many things we buy instead of pausing to ask \"wait, could I just borrow this from someone?\" Make sure other people know what you can offer too!\n* **Bulk buying and memberships -** if you live in an apartment, bulk buying can be kind of tough. BUT coordinating with a couple of friends can help. Especially for things that require a membership (like Costco) or will kill you in shipping (like a bulk order from a wholesaler). I just put the call out if I'm making one of these big orders or trips and then people pay me back. (Bonus tip: you can buy things like bulk, cheap, scent free lotion from a spa supplier or soap making supplier. Or spices and condiments from a restaurant supplier. Saves me a ton of money). \n* **Reciprocal chores -** I learned this from my mom. She would coordinate with the other poor single moms in our neighborhood and they would help each other out. Like, maybe one mom would babysit while the others got an empty house to do chores. She'd get repaid in something like having someone sell the stuff she's been meaning to list on eBay for her. The best is if you can find someone who will **negotiate your phone and internet**. I know someone like this who managed to help friends contact their internet provider and got them each *free iPads* in addition to almost halving their monthly bill.\n\nCITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD\n\n* A community garden plot (in my experience) is pretty cheap and covers a lot of the start up energy and cost of having your own garden. And you can get some pretty good advice and free produce from the other folks who garden there. \n* Check out your local community college. IMO this is up there with libraries in terms of benefit to the community. You can get a library card as a non-student (this is true of universities, too). There are often lectures, workshops, \"field trips,\" community resources, classes, and events that are free or affordable and open to the community. \n\nWhat did I miss?

{"title": "Are either Walmart Plus/In Home or Harris Teeter Plus worth it, for delivery of groceries when traveling?", "selftext": "Howdy folks,\n\nLooking for some feedback on a thought concerning saving time. So, typically I'll be getting my groceries between the likes of Harris Teeter and Walmart, along with maybe Trader Joes. Long story short, I dont always like getting groceries due to the amount of time it takes.\n\nNow, sometimes I'll travel out of town to go spend time with other friends or such and I'll rent an airbnb for a weekend or so. Ive noticed that typically having to go to the grocery store to get foods/snacks to kind of be annoying and Ive considered maybe just trying to have like a.....preloaded food/grocery list for trips that I could possibly send to stores the day of arriving or so....so that Im basically  arriving into town and have it ready for pick up by the time I get into town so I dont have to lose that time essentially (walking around the store).\n\nMore so, Ive considered maybe just trying to do delivery instead so it kicks that time gain up a bit better and Id be getting my groceries delivered before I arrive to the airbnb essentially.....and try to time it close enough so Im arriving not too far behind the delivery arrival (or maybe just have all the items arrive when Im there if I can time it right/during that time in the evening).\n\nCould anyone comment on this possibly? I know HT allows you basically a two hour window but I believe WM Home only allows delivery from 4-6pm which, if I arrive at say 8 or 9pm (to the airbnb) I might be SOL or have things melt, etc. Im not sure if its possible for me to get a later delivery (on WM) or not but then Id also have to tip on that non direct Walmart delivery as well....right?\n\nI know the service or Walmart Home will only be available in particular markets or what not. Id still find it useful to get things ready for pickup in person so I dont have to spend the hour looking around for things in store or so, but Im just not 100% sure whether these services would do what I need or would it be pointless and not as beneficial-as far as using it the way Id like to when in other cities. Itd find it beneficial in my own place/city, but the real benefit Im going for is trying to have things delivered/time saved while in visiting a different city.

The information comes from a market research firm that tests drive through times. The most recent results were published October 2024. The list below covers average total time on site. \n\nYou might want to add a couple of minutes on top of these listed times for extra time it takes from your day to detour to a fast food location, to wait for a gap in traffic to get back onto the road, and to resume your route after you've left the place.\n\n* Taco Bell: 4 minutes, 16 seconds \n* KFC: 4 minutes, 19 seconds\n* Arby's: 4 minutes, 43 seconds\n* Dunkin\u2019: 4 minutes, 47 seconds\n* Wendy\u2019s: 5 minutes 2 seconds\n* Carl\u2019s Jr./Hardee\u2019s: 5 minutes, 39 seconds\n* Burger King: 5 minutes, 39 seconds\n* Raising Cane\u2019s: 6 minutes, 10 seconds\n* McDonald\u2019s: 6 minutes, 16 seconds\n* Chick-fil-A: 7 minutes, 59 seconds\n\nDue to this sub's restrictions, this post doesn't link directly to the data.

That averages 2.5 minutes per burrito.\n* Breakfast muffins: Allrecipes \"Breakfast Egg Muffins\" recipe batch cooks 12 freezer-worthy egg muffins in 45 minutes. That averages 3 minutes, 45 seconds per muffin.\n* Overnight Oats: Food Network's \"Overnight Oats\" recipe makes 1 individual serving with 5 minutes of prep.\n* Buttered toast with milk and fruit: toaster time averages 2 minutes; give the assembly 3 minutes total time.\n* Good ol' cold cereal with milk: 1 minute to prepare, but it has to be eaten immediately.\n\nIf you're a coffee person and you tend to be in a hurry in the mornings, well reviewed programmable drip coffee makers with a timer feature start at $30.

At the very least, always include recipe cards. \n\nSame for plastic packaging. Dotted lines to show where to cut to turn a gallon milk jug into a scoop. Or how to turn it into a watering can. In Japan, some packaging will even give step by step directions on how to fold and crumple the item so it uses up less space in the garbage/recycling bins. Every plastic bag (like for cereal, crackers) should be resealable or compostable. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? What have you repurposed because you like the design or have found creative things to do with it? What would you want changed?

{"title": "How I\u2019ve saved 4000$ by cutting my own hair (kind of?)", "selftext": "TDLR at the bottom \n\n$4000, really?!? Let me start with some background. I grew up always going to cheap Asian salons, so my haircuts as a pre teen and teenager were, by and large, haphazard. In 2019, before Covid struck, I came up with the brilliant idea of growing out a man bun. After paying a friend 15 bucks to cut my hair in November 2019 and being semi disappointed by the results, I decided to just let it grow. And now looking back 6 years, that was the last time I ever payed someone to touch my hair. \n\nNow how has that saved me $4000 you may ask? Well, after talking with my coworker about his hair style,I decided to do  some rough math given what he said he payed for a barber. He said he goes normally once a month for 65 bucks. You xtrapolate that times 60 months, and wow, $3900 dollars saved. \n\nNow obviously most people don't go every month, or pay someone 65 bucks, but still, it's the little things that add up. Of course my coworkers hair looks better, but for me embracing the ugly but functional has basically become my brand at this point. Rocking my bushwhack surfer cut has become a symbol/testament of my frugality. Sure I look scruffy, but every dollar that doesn't go towards a haircut for me goes towards my savings.

{"title": "Looking for frugal cooling options for warm bedroom", "selftext": "Before I go into the details of my request for information, none of what I'm proposing will probably be Frugal per some users definition. My personal comfort is paramount especially as I have a heat intolerance, so much in fact that my windows are partially open during most of winter (even when its in single digits) and the heat is only set to 70F. (Heat bills are rarely over 100 a month).\n\nThe Setting:\nI live in a second-floor apartment in a house that is at least 100 years old. The bedroom that I am in has three awning windows located about 5 feet from the floor. These awning windows are approximately 18 inches in height and 38 inches in width. Awning windows for those who don't know, open outward and upward. The largest unobstructed portion of the window is facing down with some on the sides. These awning windows require one to lift the screen and push/pull the window to open. (This is a major hassle in itself). \n\nDuring last summer, I bought a portable AC unit, which struggled to get the temperature down below 73 F (or so). I'm actually shocked I didn't burn the house as my room is on one 15 amp circuit and I only have one grounded outlet. The watt meters should have resulted in tripping the circuit as I had to be at 80% for 3 hours or more. I'm fairly certain I was over 15 amps when checking a few times. \n\nThis room has high sun exposure from the roof with no shade and has an attached crawl space that also heats up like an oven. \n\nThis, if you have continued to read my novel are the non-winter and the summer cooling options combined. A few days ago it got up to 70 F, and even with the windows open, the following morning was 71 F in my room. When I went to bed it was 75 F. \n\nOption A: The actual option that will work without fail. I pay below market rent. This would involve ordering double-hung windows, reframing the walls, and exterior siding. I easily estimate this to be at least $6,000.00. \n\nOption B: Replace the awning windows. The cheapest option would be horizontal roller windows (which I personally hate with a passion of a thousand suns) or install a paired casement. As this is not my house, I would just install the cheapest vinyl crap you can buy. Horizontal Rollers would probably cost about 1500, while casements would probably be about 2500 or so. Casement windows are more expensive. \n\nOption C (Non-AC): Purchase shelving units that are about to the height of the windows (that's five feet) and have two fans (quiet ones) where one will hopefully attempt to bring in outside air while the other one will attempt to push that air outside. I estimate this option to cost about 300-400. The fans need to be quiet at least mostly. \n\nOption C (AC): This is only an option for when its constantly above 70 F. Increase the amount of insulation wrap around the extended hoses (dual hose portable ac) in an attempt to keep the heat inside the hoses and thus pushed outside of the house. \n\nOption D (AC): Measure how much clearance I have on the awnings and purchase a GE ClearView AC unit. This has an inverted U. If enough clearance exists, it's probably possible to get the outside portion of the AC unit outside. The downsides of this are that it will be super easy to damage the awning window (and glass) and potentially it could fall out without something to ensure the unit is being held into place. \n\nOther options considered: I've considered a mini-split, however given that installation cost and the need to run another circuit and power lines. I think it will just be too costly. \n\nDue to reasons unrelated, Option C (Non-AC/AC) are probably the only realistic options budget wise but I know effectiveness is going to be marginal at best. \n\nThe question I am asking is, what's the frugal option here? I'm also open to other options that I may not have thought about. Asking the landlord to take care of this is not an option as this is a ME problem. I also have several electronics in my room that produce heat as waste.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1ji805u/looking_for_frugal_cooling_options_for_warm/", "created_utc": 1742759464.0, "score": 4, "author": "monsieurvampy", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1ji805u/looking_for_frugal_cooling_options_for_warm/", "html_title": ""}

Should I buy or continue renting?", "selftext": "\nI am a 24 year old dad making 95-100k in rural Tx, about an hour outside of DFW. We got pre-approved for a 250k loan through Neighbors bank for USDA guaranteed.\n\nWe have mostly found houses in the 175k range. There would be 0 down payment. We have 15k liquid savings, and cash to close without concessions is estimated to be 8k-10k.\n\nWe have no other debt besides my student loans (29k) and a car loan with only 5k remaining. Fiance stays at home and we are getting married this year. Our son is 10 months old. I have an accounting degree and am currently an accounting manager.\n\nAm I stupid for trying to buy, given my situation? We already pay $1400 in rent every month\u2026It feels crazy that it\u2019s actually within my grasp now, but I don\u2019t want to jump the shark. I ran the numbers, and we\u2019d still have 2k of income to save or spend after accounting for all expenses with a mortgage in this range.\n\nWe are probably going to make an offer on a 175k home for list price and 5-6% concessions. It\u2019s been on the market for 42 days and there aren\u2019t many buyers in the current market. There are also currently no offers. The home is directly across the street from the elementary school. The USDA guaranteed loan is 0 down, and I\u2019m pretty sure the house is going to appraise for 180k+ based on comps.\n\n\nWe live pretty frugally. I drive a paid off 2010 Camry, shave my head to save in haircuts, etc. All my clothes are either given to me or from the thrift store, and the vast majority of our grocery budget is simple whole foods that are affordable (leg quarters, frozen veggies, beans, etc). I do have 29k student loans, but my payment is only $118/month. She has a $327 car payment that she only owes 7k on. CC debt is minimal, maybe a couple hundred at a given time. Hell, I even intermittent fast so I don\u2019t spend money on food outside home, as well as drink instant coffee. We go out to dinner once in a blue moon.\n\nFrom the this sub\u2019s standpoint, would I be stupid to do this? I understand that I\u2019m the only one making money and that kinda scares me. I make a good income for my area and age, but what if that stopped? I have an accounting degree and currently work as an accounting manager. Planning to get my CPA soon as well.\n\nWould it be sustainable? We would still have over 2k in income to save/spend/invest after the mortgage, likely utilities, groceries, health insurance, and student loan/car payment. I\u2019d like to save 1K+/20% no matter what, as well as contribute to retirement. \n\nThe sellers verbally agreed to 8k in concessions, which should cover most/all of the closing costs in our area. Once they sign, the biggest thing is getting the inspection scheduled within 7 days and it passing the USDA appraisal (both value and condition).\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1jhgcc1/singleincome_24year_old_dad_got_preapproved_for/", "created_utc": 1742671305.0, "score": 72, "author": "scholarlypimp", "num_comments": 128, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1jhgcc1/singleincome_24year_old_dad_got_preapproved_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I bought 300\u2019 of sisal rope for $17 and redid my cats scratching tree instead of buying a new one. I also fixed the top bed that fell off.", "selftext": "I bought a cat tree two years ago and my cat has used it very much. Instead of replacing it because one or two posts were shredded I figured I would try repairing it. Last year I bought 300\u2019 of sisal rope for $17 and so far have replaced 2 posts (1 post and a half post twice). I found the new sisal rope does not last as long as the original rope but it lasted about 6-7 months before needing to be replaced. I still have a ton of rope left and could do a few more post replacements before running out. Total cost for it and a new glue gun with 30 sticks was under $50. There was a little bit of the cardboard that came off when I peeled off the old rope but it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal as even if it breaks completely I have used it well beyond its intended life This is my 2nd time applying more rope so it\u2019s got 3 lives out of it, beyond its expected one life. \n\nI also had the top shelf become wobbly and eventually fell off in the middle of the night. I ended up fixing that too with about 5 minutes of work and for \u201cfree\u201d by using existing materials. The cat trees are made by using cardboard rolls and have black plastic caps on them so they can be screwed in. I found the top fell off because the cap was loose. I ended up attaching the post to the tree and screwing it in a little than applying some force to get the plastic cap off. I applied some super glue around the base of the cap and shoved it back in the cardboard tube and let it dry. Once it was dry i screwed the top back on and now it doesn\u2019t wobble anymore and my cat enjoys sitting on the top again silently judging me. \n\nA new cat tree costs about $70-100, it looks like with about $50 worth of materials ($20 if you already have a hot glue gun and some superglue) you can refresh your cat trees and scratching posts until they actually break beyond repair. \n\nI\u2019ve also included a picture of my cats Sindri and Fenrir.

I know; \"Duh!\" for people in this sub.  But I want to pass on that you can and you should use 100% of it; no waste.  \n\nThere's only 2/3 meat eaters in our family (depends on if my father visits).  So after the first meal, there's usually still a lot of chicken left over.  I would usually strip all the meat from the bones; separate out the skin.  Save the meat, skin separately; put bones in freezer.  The meat is well-seasoned and can be redeployed in other meals easily (burritos, chicken salad, pho in our case).  Put skin in toaster oven on broil to make cracklings.  The bones makes delicious broth for soup.  If there's enough dripping, I would save that too to make gravy.  Toss the bag though.\n\nFor example, I bought this one last week.  Meal 1 was the chicken as is, some left over fried rice and slaw.  Meal 2 was pho with chicken.  The cheat was using the ready pho bowls from Costco.  My wife (Vietnamese) used the seasoning packs to make the soup, add a lot of cilantro, bean sprouts, and also add additional dried pho to make a big meal.  Not traditional, but good enough, and not a lot of efforts.  Meal 3 was dried ramen with the cracklings made from the skin.  Meal 4 was a big pot of chicken curry with the rest of the meat and some potato/carrot.  Enough to last 2/3 meals.  Meal 5 coming up will be using the bones to make broth for porridge.  (I usually use 3 Costco chicken's worth of bones to make a big pot of broth.)\n\nSo that $5 usually gets us maybe 5+ meals for us, depending on what we decide to cook.  If there's other things we can do, I am happy to learn.

One of the pics included the original sell by date, which also included the price ($10+ for the chicken thighs). It was obvious the poster had no clue about how to preserve food\u2014the most basic of which is to freeze it. This stresses the importance of knowing how to preserve food you have or obtain. \n\nI grew up in poverty and raised my kinds in poverty during their early years, so I gained a LOT of knowledge about preserving food. A neighbors garden produced tons of tomatoes or zucchini? Preserve it instead of letting it rot. Food bank overflowing with peaches or apples and it\u2019s take however many you\u2019d like? Preserve them. You made too much chili or spaghetti sauce you won\u2019t eat before it goes bad? Preserve it. \n\nThere are many ways to preserve food\u2014the most easiest for many foods is to freeze it. There\u2019s also dehydration (great for most fruits, veggies, and herbs), canning, fermenting, salting and smoking. \n\nLearning ways to preserve food can save a lot of money and increase your food security. (Just make sure you\u2019re using a tested and safe way to preserve food, especially if you\u2019re just starting out.)\n\nBTW, According to the USDA, frozen meat kept at 0\u00b0F (or lower) is safe to eat indefinitely, but for best quality, use uncooked steaks, roasts, or chops within 4 to 12 months, uncooked ground beef within 3 to 4 months, and cooked beef within 2 to 3 months. So buy the meat at your grocery store that has been discounted because it\u2019s close to the sell by date and they need to make room for the incoming meat. Put it in the freezer and eat it later.

You have to wait for them to announce it verbally. But if my location is any indication just be patient and wait it out. I recommend getting there as early as you can stand to be in the store to load your cart with merchandise, then check out after the 99% off is announced. Maybe carry snacks so you can stay longer without getting hungry.\n\nA lot of the items that will be left will probably be Christmas items but think ahead and you can save those for next Christmas.\n\nThere might not be a lot left, but you have to look through every item and see if you have a use for it or you can use it for a gift etc. Keep in mind we are talking items for pennies here as its 99% off so even if you overbuy its not going to hurt your wallet.

Most of the degradation comes from holding the battery at near maximum charge. Toggling a power saving setting to limit the charge to ~80% keeps the battery from degrading as fast\n2. Keeping power saving on will offset the limited battery. It more or less causes most apps that rely on passive updates to give delayed updates. I.e. discord pings show up 10-20 minutes after the fact. But if the app is that important you can override the battery setting to have it always passively running.\n3.

You do have to be mindful to cancel the subscribe and save product if you don't want to receive it again.  Obviously Amazon is relying on you forgetting to do so.  So far, we have saved over $2,100 since Sept 2016 when we started using subscirbe and save (Amazon puts the amount in the upper left hand  corner of the subscribe and save page).\n\n\\- If you have the Navy Federal Credit Union Signature Visa card, then you should use that card to pay your annual Prime fee and Navy Federal will reimburse you 100%.

The room comes with a walk-in closet and private bathroom and is spacious. The noise levels in the house tend to be fairly low, however, I do share it with 5 other guys. Sometimes they bring their dates over and you can very easily hear them through the walls. I don't have a problem with any of them, though a couple do love to leave their dishes in the sink for way too damn long and mess up the kitchen. I'm not a fan of having so many roommates and would feel uncomfortable bringing a date over. The house has a really nice kitchen with all modern appliances. My land lady loves me.

I pay $830 for rent.\n\nI recently spoke with our neighbor, who has an even NICER house, and they have a small one bedroom apartment in their guest house. It's a nice space with a living room, full kitchen, bathroom and a bedroom. It has enough distance from the main house that noise is not an issue. I would be able to use their pool, and the property is gated in.  The owners both seem like really sweet understanding people. Utilities are fully covered. It is $1400 a month.\n\nI'm coming off of a year of cancer treatment and just got my first \"real\" job that pays a livable wage: about $4,000 a month pre-tax.

{"title": "Ways to save on bills (all kinds)?", "selftext": "Hi, I just came across this sub and was hoping you all could offer me some advice on how to save money. I live alone (except for my furry and feathery family). This is gonna be a pretty long post, but I'm gonna put everything into categories. Feel free to ask questions and offer advice on any of this stuff.\n\n**My Location**\n\nNorth Central Florida\n\n**My House**\n\nDouble-wide mobile home, bought by my parents in 1986, with additions by my dad. I inherited it from my mom upon her death. Lived here since I was 7.\n\n**Work and Pay**\n\nSetting aside the rather substantial savings that I have (from both me and my mom putting money aside over the years), I want to be able to live on my wages (so as to not have to touch my savings) and perhaps grow my savings.\n\nThat said, I typically work 18-19.5 hours per week (3 days on, 4 days off), lately, and recently got a pay increase to $14.99 per hour. That's gross, though. They take away stuff for Medicare, Vision, 401(k), stock purchase, and taxes (I have them take out more taxes than necessary, so I'm guaranteed a refund every year). I make the net equivalent of roughly $8-$10 per hour.\n\n**Power Company and Monthly Usage**\n\nI get my power through Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative. It doesn't have fixed peak hours, but it does issue [Beat The Peak](https://www.wrec.net/beat-peak) alerts.\n\nMy latest bill, covering 1/15 (reading: 33870) to 2/13 (reading: 33992) and with a usage of 122 kWh, was $51.41. The breakdown is: customer charge: $39.16, energy charge: $6.09, fuel adjustment: $4.88, FL gross receipts tax: $1.28.\n\n**Heater/Thermostat**\n\nNone. I just bundle up in the winter.\n\n**Air Conditioner**\n\nOnly in the summer and only for an hour or two in the evening to dehumidify the house and get the temperature a bit lower. Shut off before I go to bed. I'm very tolerant of the heat, and the air conditioner is loud; I can't watch TV with it on.\n\n**Water Heater**\n\nProbably around a decade old. I don't remember, exactly. Replaced the original one.\n\nI recently began experimenting with just turning off the power to the water heater entirely and turning it on only around an hour before I shower (and I don't shower every day, only a few times per week) and do the laundry (no more than twice per month). I apparently used 221 kWh during the previous bill's billing cycle, so this has seemingly worked for me, knocking $9.13 off my bill.\n\n**Light Bulbs**\n\nI don't have any LED light bulbs. They're all the old kind. And I change them so infrequently that I still have 3 unused ones (60 watt equivalent, 43 actual watts used) left from back when my mom was alive (4.5 years ago).\n\nI don't turn on the lights that often. I might briefly turn on a light in the kitchen or living room when I want to turn on the TV at night, but otherwise I watch TV in the dark. I might turn on a light or two in the kitchen if I wait until after dark to cook dinner. I turn on the light when I use the bathroom at night (but rarely get us specifically to use the bathroom).\n\nI don't hang out in my bedroom and simply use the flashlight on my phone to get to bed every night. I might turn on the front porch light briefly to feed the one or two kitties that visit my porch. The one light that I make the most use of is a lamb on a bookcase near my computer desk.\n\nAll of that said, would I save any money at all by replacing the bulbs that I *do* use with LED bulbs?\n\nWhat about removing the ones that I don't use? Do they use any power just by being screwed in?\n\n**Misc Stuff Plugged In**\n\nRecently unplugged these: color-changing night light for the kitties (was constantly on), treadmill, various night lights (almost never used), Echo Dot (used no more than once or twice per day, if that).\n\nAre surge protectors plugged in (but turned off and with nothing plugged into them) using power? Should I unplug these?\n\nWhat about my cell phone's plug and charging cable? Should I unplug it when my phone isn't being charged?\n\n**Living Room**\n\n50\" 4K onn TV, PlayStation 5, and Sony 4K Blu-ray player are plugged into a surge protector. This outlet has a switch near it that allows me to shut off the power to the whole thing. Should I do that when I'm not using the TV?\n\nA rarely-used lamp (see above) is on the back wall.\n\n**Kitchen**\n\nGE electric range (year unknown). That's it. Rarely use the oven (except on days like today, when I felt like baking a pizza). Cook a meal (usually ground meat, ramen, mashed potatoes, beans, or canned veggies) on one of the burners once (maybe twice) per day. Just turned off the clock. Is there anything more energy efficient that I could get?\n\n**Dining Room**\n\nThis is where my computer (an all-in-one hp purchased in 2020) is. I got a glowing keyboard and mouse separately, because they look cool. Would I save any money by plugging the original keyboard and mouse back in?\n\nWhat about turning off the surge protector (which has lights) at night?\n\nI shut down the computer every night. I typically don't turn it on until I'm ready to use it. If I get into watching TV after I come home from work, I might not even turn on the computer at all on those days.\n\n**Refrigerators**\n\nI have two full-sized fridges (freezer on top). Both have been unplugged for a long time. I got a Hisense mini fridge and stuck it in the pantry. Sufficient for my needs.\n\n**Garage**\n\nHotpoint washer (a few years old). Old, loud Kenmore dryer. Sears garage door opener probably dating back to the 1970s (we brought it with us from Chicago).\n\nI just turned off the power to the garage entirely, since I park outside and rarely do the laundry.\n\n**Internet**\n\n$52 per month. Centurylink.\n\n**Water**\n\nAfter decades of using well water, the county made us get public water (so they could charge us for it) in January of 2021. My brother-in-law and his son came down and set everything up. Latest bill (for 1/3 to 2/3) is $2016. Broken down, that's: water base charge: $12.72, water (4,000 gallons @ $1.86 per 1,000 gallons): $7.44.\n\n**Food**\n\nI often have ground meat for dinner, usually 99% lean ground turkey. Sometimes mashed potatoes, canned corn, or peas. I get a bunch of bananas every so often.\n\nI buy a 40-pack of Great Value water and keep it in the car (my cats have sometimes punctured the bottles when I keep it in the pantry). On my days off from work, I try to drink around 6-8 16.9-ounce bottles daily. On my days at work, I work outside, so I drink the water that they supply us.\n\nIf I don't worry about getting the water cold by fridging the bottles, it might be more cost-effective to buy gallon jugs and just chug straight outta those.\n\nI have four cats, one of which is less than a year old, so I'm buying kitten food for all of them until August 5. Usually a bag of Meow Mix or 9 Lives. Occasionally wet food. I probably have to get two bottles of litter per month. They're super poopers. I have two cockatiels and two parakeets, but I don't need to buy food for them nearly as often.\n\n**Streaming Services**\n\nMax is currently on a one-year ad-free subscription for $106.45. I had meant to switch it to ad-supported but forgot.\n\nRecently switched over Paramount+ from ad-free annual to ad-supported annual ($65.80) and Apple TV+ from ad-supported monthly to ad-supported annual ($108.58). My reasoning here was, even though I don't watch stuff that often, they're annual charges, not monthly charges, and they're cheaper in the long run.\n\nOther monthly streaming charges that can't be switched to annual: Netflix ad-supported ($8.76), Disney+ Duo Basic ad-supported ($12.05)\n\nMonthly streaming charges that I haven't switched to annual yet: Amazon Prime ($15.09), Amazon Music ($12.05)\n\nAs I said, I don't watch much. I want to, but I never seem to have the time. Since I can view YouTube on my TV, my viewing time is often sucked up by reaction videos.\n\nI'm basically keeping these subscriptions going out of convenience. I don't like the idea of waiting until I feel like watching something, getting a one-month subscription, and having to set aside the time to watch all of that one thing and then cancel my subscription. Do you think it might be more cost-effective to simply rent/buy the specific things that I want to watch (assuming that's even an option for everything)?\n\n**Car/Gas/Mileage**\n\nI have a 2009 Nissan Versa (bought in November of that year). It has 60,000+ miles on it. I work a half-mile from home (I drive home for lunch), so I don't make much mileage. On my days off, I might visit various thrift stores in my town or to do some grocery shopping. Might drive to another city to see a movie occasionally (I drove over an hour to get to a theater that played *Bottoms* and over an hour to another one that played *Love Lies Bleeding*; totally worth it). I make trips to big cities 2-3 times per year as a treat (such as on my birthday). I fill up on gas once or twice per month.\n\nI no longer service my car at the dealer but go to a local guy that runs a shop out of his house, near mine. I've saved a ton of money this way, and my car still runs just fine.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1j9x1kv/ways_to_save_on_bills_all_kinds/", "created_utc": 1741819373.0, "score": 0, "author": "Tuxedo_Mark", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1j9x1kv/ways_to_save_on_bills_all_kinds/", "html_title": ""}

Okay, that pissed me off.\n\nWhat really pissed me off even more is finding out that all the interest is front-loaded, so you\u2019re building almost no equity in the first 10-15 years. That INFURIATED me. Like what the fuck? We\u2019re all just making banks rich to be able to have a sliver of a taste of home \u201cowner\u201dship.\n\nPart of me feels like I\u2019m falling into the victim mindset and I just need to adapt and treat it like a challenge to overcome \u2014 to play the game to the best of my ability.\n\nThe other part of me wants to lead a revolution against what seems like a horribly fucking asinine system. How can I get to a point of acceptance for something that\u2019s completely stacked against the people? It makes me feel like a cow in a tiny pen just getting milked for all I\u2019m worth \u2014 giving every last drop of money, energy, emotional stability \u2014 and getting in return just barely enough to survive to continue getting milked again the next day.\n\nThese interest payments are basically a tax if you think about it. You\u2019re already getting taxed 25-30% on your income, and then in order to afford a home, you\u2019re getting taxed another 25-30% roughly because all that money is getting pissed away to the bank in interest or mortgage and auto loans. It\u2019s just another form of tax, arguably even worse, because at least your income tax goes to contributing to society to a degree. Mortgage interest and the like just goes directly to the big bank execs, for the \u201cprivilege\u201d of being able to afford a roof over your head or reliable transportation. We\u2019re basically paying a huge tax to afford things that any person working a job\u00a0*should have a right to own*.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution? Fuck, I don\u2019t know. We need to band together and just live as frugally as possible without taking out mortgages. We need to normalize living with family and multiple roommates instead of taking out huge interest-generating loans. We don\u2019t even have to do it for long. We can live like that for much longer than the banks can stay in business without us lining their pockets with interest money. They are already so over-leveraged that probably just a month of hardly anyone taking out loans would bury them, whether that means a full on collapse and complete rebuild of the system, or an evolution to something that is more fair, I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m at that fork in the road where I can turn left and choose acceptance, or I can turn right and give the system the huge middle finger it deserves. I really, really want to wrench that steering wheel to the right and never look back, and I have no idea if I\u2019m alone in feeling this way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1j7lf07/first_time_homebuying_has_me_infuriated/", "created_utc": 1741564559.0, "score": 494, "author": "PoppingTheBubble", "num_comments": 339, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1j7lf07/first_time_homebuying_has_me_infuriated/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Save money on milk by making your own non-dairy alternatives", "selftext": "If you use lots of milk in smoothies, overnight oats, or other cooking, you can save money by supplementing it with homemade soy milk or oat milk. \n\nAll you need is a pack of soybeans/oatmeal, water, a blender, a pot, and a cheesecloth. \n\nYou can typically find a pack of soybeans at an Asian grocery store for relatively cheap (about the same price as other beans at western grocery stores). If not, you can definitely get 2 lbs of oatmeal for 5-6 dollars. \n\nHomemade soy milk costs about $1 per gallon, compared to regular whole milk, which costs $5-6. The price for homemade oat milk is also similar. Homemade non-dairy milk typically lasts about a week in the fridge. \n\nAnother great part about making soy milk at home is that you get leftover soy bean pulp also known as okara, which you can use in various different recipes. \n\nThere are also plenty of different types of plant milks you can try making. You can use different types of nuts (almond, hazelnut, cashew, walnuts, pistachios, etc) or grains (rice, flax seed, hemp seed, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, buckwheat). Prices may vary on ingredients. But it mostly involves similar steps of soaking ingredients overnight, blending with water, heating in a pot, and straining with a cheesecloth. Some steps may be omitted entirely. \n\nIf you really love homemade non-dairy milk, you can invest in a machine that does most of the work for you. But they tend to cost $200, so opt for a used model. For me, my $30 blender does the job fine.

{"title": "How do you manage hosting guests while staying frugal?", "selftext": "My husband and I enjoy hosting guests, and since we live in a popular tourist destination a lot of people like to come and stay with us.\n\nWe live in a HCOL country but we are from another, LCOL country and our guests are mainly from our hometowns. The problem is, I don't think they realize the costs of living here, and I don't know if it would be rude to point it out? We're saving up for a house so we are being quite frugal (although we are never uncomfortable, we naturally are rather minimalistic).\n\nThe main problem is heating: it is normal where we live to have 18C (64.6F) inside in winter (at night even 16C /60.7F). Our guests claim this is to little to be comfortable and keep turning on the heating which is really, really expensive (central heating). The same goes about using hot water. We take 5 min warm showers. Our visitors take even 30 min ones, with much higher heat. Or brush their teeth with the tap open, hot water running...\n\nOne the one hand, I would like my guests to be comfortable, on the other, these costs rise very high very fast. When we had visitors in winter, they staid for 5 days, and our heating bill more than tripled for the entire month! Last week, my husbands friend visited - she claimed to be cold at night even though it was 22C/71.6F in the room at the coldest point, and I gave her 3 comforters. I'm not proud of myself but I told her that the heating works only in the winter months, so that she would not use it... \n\nThis gives me real anxiety about money. How do you handle such situations? Do you just not invite people? Are you upfront about frugality? Or do you just go with it and ignore the extra costs? \n\nEDIT:\nThanks to everyone who replied with tips and shared their experiences! I did not expect that many replies. It seems like people are more or less divided between \n\na) being upront with the rules, and \n\nB) witholding from hosting until I can accommodate my guests fully. \n\nI feel like I should limit my guests to the ones I feel comfortable to do A) with, and otherwise I will go with B).\n\nReplying to the comments made me realize that I may be used a bit by some of my \"friends\", and that the way some of them behave is not acceptable to me.

My store usually has the quart packages for $3. The last time I bought them I weighed the three containers I got: it was **5.4 pounds** of food. Not bad for $9!!

Of course, I'd love to minimize my expenses as much as I can during this period of frictional unemployment.\n\nSome ideas I have:\n\n\\-meal prepping -- I already prep dinner for most days of the week. i can stretch dinner prep for longer and make a lunch prep (sandwiches, bean salads etc).\n\n\\-minimize eating out -- for a whole week I get takeout 3-4 times. reduce to 0-1\n\n\\-change grocery stores, start shopping at LIDL/Walmart instead of Giant/Safeway. there's also lots of international markets near me (high immigrant pop) which have food for cheap, though idk how that will change once tariffs get implemented.\n\n\\-perhaps some small gig work to cover grocery expenses, like uber or w/e. not a long term solution but something to consider if I haven't found a position by the time I move places.\n\n\\-maybe file for UE? idk how this works, and i technically 'resigned' from my position\n\nAny other advice from people that have humped unemployement before?

I am adamant this must be done in next five years before kids hit high school. \n\nOur home is a brilliant 130+ year old home on a fantastic street in a good area - we accidentally did the buy the worst house on the best street - so moving is absolutely not an option.\n\nReally the big things are just day to day spending, coffee, days out, shopping etc etc. you get the picture. \n\nI\u2019ve spent today thinking about anything i might need in the coming months and really the list is trainers, a few pair of jeans (I\u2019ve lost weight since I\u2019m finished having children) and a pair of silver earrings for a wedding in October (I already have the outfit planned I just don\u2019t have big statement silver earrings - I like big). I plan to get everything but the trainers second hand on Vinted or eBay. \n\nThat\u2019s it. I want to start making bread and pizza dough (not sourdough I\u2019ll start with normal). I used to make pizza dough all the time and now we order takeout at \u00a330-\u00a340 a Friday night so obviously I plan to go back to that ans batch cook things like spaghetti Bolognese and rice and freeze them. \n\nLonger term I plan to learn to sew and to knit to fix/amend/adjust items. With 4 kids and wanting to be frugal I fell this is a necessity. \n\nI live in UK. In August my youngest gets will be in funded nursery so I will have more time to do more money saving things but for the moment I am planning to just stop the mindless spending. \n\nAny tips or advice are absolutely welcome (even if harsh).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k7v7zq/becoming_frugal_day_1_an_accountability_diary/", "created_utc": 1745613465.0, "score": 5, "author": "Hezybaby_changed", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k7v7zq/becoming_frugal_day_1_an_accountability_diary/", "html_title": ""}

No wonder they use more water. \n\nThe second is also something I\u2019m not a fan of and it\u2019s filling the sink full of water and cleaning dirty dishes in there. Personally, I just think it\u2019s icky, but beyond that, it uses a lot of water to fill up the sink.\n\nThe third is people who only turn the tap on to rinse.

You don\u2019t need to keep water running when you wash. And you don\u2019t need especially high pressure to rinse suds off. Even the tap opened a quarter of the way and running down the plate will get rid a lot of the suds in one go.\n\nTo test this, I ran an experiment. My dishwasher model will use 3 gallons of water in a cycle. But using this method to hand wash dishes, the amount of plates I needed to wash to use up 3 gallons in the sink were 8 Large plates and 12 small plates. \n\nI understand how a dishwasher can be convenient, but the saying that it uses less water than handwashing were probably studies paid for by dishwashers companies that I\u2019m surprised more people have not caught on to. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k7e7dg/dishwashers_using_less_water_than_handwashing_is/", "created_utc": 1745562384.0, "score": 0, "author": "Anonythrowthetrash", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k7e7dg/dishwashers_using_less_water_than_handwashing_is/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "If you make cold-brew coffee, you can use the grounds twice", "selftext": "The title pretty much says it all, but here's more details: \n\nI switched from hot to cold-brewed coffee a few months before covid shut things down in March 2020. I first tried it when I found a *very* cheap bottle of cold-brew concentrate in Kroger's clearance section, and liked it so much better than hot-brew coffee, I immediately set about trying to make my own. I ended up buying specialized cold-brew pitchers (about $15 each at the time, IIRC), and through trial and error discovered that for daily cold-brew drinkers, the ideal minimum number of pitchers to have is three: one you're currently drinking from; one where the coffee is steeping but not ready to drink yet; and a third so you have time to wash a newly empty pitcher before refilling it with coffee grounds and water to steep. \n\nThe minimum time for steeping is supposed to be 24 hours, but mine will sometimes sit for several days before I drink it, depending on how long it takes me to finish whatever pitcher I'm currently drinking from.\n\nMost \"how to make cold brew coffee\" recipes will tell you to remove the grounds before you start drinking, and I followed that instruction the first few times I made it, but one morning I was in a rush and had no time to empty the grounds first. Made no difference in the quality or taste of the resulting brew, so now I leave them in the whole time I'm drinking from that pitcher. (Grounds are in a mesh cylinder suspended in the middle of the pitcher.) Then, when I finish a \"fresh\" pitcher of coffee, I refill it with water and let it steep again, for several days, while I drink from the newest pitcher.\n\nA cup of \"first-run\" cold-brew coffee is strong enough that I dilute it with chilled water before adding the cream and sugar. I keep a jug of water in the fridge next to the cold-brew pitchers specifically for this purpose. A cup of \"second-run\" coffee is definitely weaker; I drink that \"straight\" rather than add water first. Also, while 24 hours is the minimum steeping time for cold-brew coffee made of fresh grounds, for a second-run you'll want to let it steep at least twice as long. Mine steeps for a few days, however much time it takes for me to finish a pitcher.\n\n(I once experimented with trying a third brew with the grounds, but it's not worth it; no matter how many days you let it steep, after two cold brewings there just isn't enough left in the grounds to get a drinkable third batch from it. Two brewings is the most you can get from a given amount of ground coffee, and still hope to get a drinkable cup of cold brew.)\n\nOne other thing that might be relevant: whether I'm making a first-run or second-run batch, I don't pour the water directly into the pitcher; instead, I pour it (*very* slowly) directly into that mesh cylinder filled with coffee grounds, so that every drop of water has to work its way through the grounds before making it into the cylinder itself.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k30uag/if_you_make_coldbrew_coffee_you_can_use_the/", "created_utc": 1745081856.0, "score": 0, "author": "Jennifer_Junipero", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k30uag/if_you_make_coldbrew_coffee_you_can_use_the/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "10 ways to use an on sale Easter ham", "selftext": "I love holidays surrounding a specific food that immediately goes on sale and Easter is no different since spiral cut ham is so easy to deal with. These are a list of things I do with a ham as one person living alone to make it go the farthest, cheapest, with minimal waste. One ham I\u2019ll typically take 3-4 months to finish completely as I stagger eating it with other things of course feel free to add suggestions, I am literally always looking to up my cheap food prep variety game. In case you haven\u2019t prepped and stored a ham before, this tends to take the better part of an afternoon so I suggest either a full day youre off work dedicated or a full evening when you don\u2019t have to work the next day! Even if it\u2019s only a couple hours of active hamming, there\u2019s cleanup and the exhaustion at least I feel after such a task. \n\nTo get ready, you will need: your ham, some white beans, onion, garlic, a few herbs/spices, water, bread, condiments you prefer.\n\n1. Obv- eat some ham! Enjoy a nice meal, warm it up, make a nice side or two it is tasty. \n\n2. First, deconstruct the ham. Take off all the slices and REALLY try to scrape off the bone. Get as much as possible, I use my freshly washed hands. Get all the slices and divide up the ham between chunks and slices. Separate the slices to make sandwiches and grilled cheese. I freeze them in packs of 2-4 servings depending on your food prep habits. Then the larger chunks separate for other uses and keep the bones until we make soup. I also separate out the pieces that are very fatty or very small. And I pay the ham tax to my cat I know she doesn\u2019t need the salt but she only understands the language of singular tiny tiny snack. \n\nNow for the uses! \n\n1. Just to eat, girl dinner it up and just crack open a container and eat a slice of ham. It\u2019s cooked, fast, and easy. (Slices or chunks) if you like ham, this may be the only time you wanna just snack on some slices for a while. \n\n2. Fry it with eggs (or not these days lol) for breakfast. (I prefer slices) see also making a breakfast skillet! \n\n3. Fry it to top salads with or put it on salads out of the fridge or slightly warm or whatever you prefer. (Slices or chunks) \n\n4. Rice porridge! Rice porridge is GREAT and with some ham, render some fat from the ham and fry a couple pieces in the same pot youll be making the porridge in, it gives a little extra flavor. Dice up the pieces you fried and put them on top or stir them in. You can dice as much or as little as you want.  (Fatty chunks) \n\n5. Sandwiches or quesadillas: sorry if this is sacrilegious, a tortilla is the perfect bread and a cheese and ham quesadilla is delightful to me. See also, loaded grilled cheeses. (Slices)\n\n6. My favorite- ham and beans! This is where the bone comes in! Dice an onion roughly, chop a BUNCH of garlic, soak or not some white beans (the whole thing needs to be cooked for so long anyway), and that\u2019s the basis for ham n beans. You put the bone and any scrap-looking ham chunks into a pot (I use my instant pot), cover with water, add herbs you like and let it cook low and slow as long as possible. It is so good, the broth ends up so thick a truly it freezes perfectly, it may even be better rewarded than fresh and white beans cost so little even now. Eat with cornbread if possible. (The bone and bone trimmings). Any little piece clinging to the bone will fall off in this. Can freeze indefinitely tbh and you can make it go a LONG way \n\n7. Ham pot pie- whatever veggies you have and use ham in the filling idk how but it works.\n\n8. Baked potato topping - this feels similar to a salad topping but it feels different enough to me to stay interesting. Cook up some chunks of ham and go wild on a baked potato. Also works great imo in basked potato soup. \n\n9. Fried rice with ham as the protein\n\n10. Ham hand pies - these can be as veggie-forward or ham and cheese forward as you want, I like mine ham and cheesey but have done both. \n\n\nObviously this all takes time, but once you portion out the ham and make the ham n beans (or other soup I guess) it really is minimal work for each dish.

But, which is the more frugal option?\n\nAt first blush, and strictly on a price/lb initial basis, the big ones are more expensive per pound.  But there are some other considerations.\n\nSmaller spuds require a lot more peeling, scraping, or scrubbing (depending on one's spud prep preference and purpose) and this means more produce waste, effort and time.\n\nSmaller ones also seemed to have more issues than larger ones - leading to more effort cleaning and resulting waste.  And perhaps more importantly, they seem to degrade much quicker - even if stored in the fridge.\n\nLong story short, after two months of comparing each, that initial $0.19 price dif /lb dropped significantly - to less than $0.06 /lb - because of additional waste and storage decay. \n\nOn balance, the smaller ones were still cheaper, but they took longer to prep and soon became an annoying chore.  Obviously, people value their time differently, so that's a difficult factor to cost, but it was usually about 20% longer prepping the smaller spuds.\n\nFor me, the (now only slightly) more expensive bigger units are the preferred choice, mainly because of the time it takes to prep.\n\nBut, I thought it worthwhile offering an example of where cheaper is not always more frugal, depending upon one's specific circumstances.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1k1r5pd/an_exercise_in_practical_frugality_potatoes/", "created_utc": 1744933439.0, "score": 482, "author": "RockMo-DZine", "num_comments": 84, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1k1r5pd/an_exercise_in_practical_frugality_potatoes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "What's the best affordable, filling, somewhat healthy, and delicious dining out foods?", "selftext": "me and my wife love to dine out, but its getting very costly. Trying to save money, have a lil fun, and enjoying food I made up a top 5 list in my mind of dining out options that hit each of these variables:\n\n\u2022 affordable  \n\u2022 filling  \n\u2022 somewhat healthy  \n\u2022 delicious\n\n\\*Note we live in the Dallas / Fort Worth area (so maybe some of these restaurants dont exist in your area?)\n\n\\#5 - Pizza chain pizza (dominos, pizza hut, papa johns, little caesers, marcos)  \nStarting off controversial, I know chain pizza isnt exactly the most healthy, but if you limit your toppings and size of pizza, you can get 2 medium 1 toppings for like 9.99 total and spread it out 1-3 days, saving money. and of course, pizza is always delicious. Do this like once a month, not every week. TOTAL: $10 for me AND my wife.\n\n\\#4 - Panda Express  \nAgain, not the most healthy, but you get quite a bag for your buck meal at PE. The plate is very filling. half and half rice/ noodles, plus 2 entres is a lot of food. I personally can just have this one meal and I'm done for the day, and for about just 9.99 a bargain. It's a little greasy, but not as much as fried chicken or a burger or even pizza. If you get a kids meal, its only 5.99 and is a decent fill-me up meal. Sometimes I buy the kids meal and come home and fry up an egg and add jarred kim-chi I purchased from walmart to maximize taste. TOTAL: about $20. My wife always gets the 'bowl meal' which is about $8.\n\n\\#3 - Banh Mi from mom and pop Vietnamese spots  \nI love Vietnamese food, but pho prices are very insane these days. I've seen prices as high as $25 for a bowl. WOW. So instead, I opt for a basic banh mi. There's usually many varieties that range from 5.99-8.99. Do not go to the 'white ppl' viet restaurants! Those places charge super high! A banh mi at one of those places can run you $15 a sandwich. F that! Plus it's usually not even good. To know. youre at an authenic Viet spot is if an old viet lady is running the cash register and there's a mop bucket near the restroom area. TOTAL: Me and my wife usually spend $16-20 on banh mi and it's fill us up til late nite.\n\n\\#2 - Salad-n-Go  \nMy wife and I just started going to this quickie salad spot. It hits ALL varibles: taste, price, fillingness, healthy, and FAST as a bonus variable. So far Ive only eaten the wraps there, but theyre are GOOD. They also have very healthy juices there for only like $2. I can have a large wrap and juice solo for under $10. I been here maybe 4times already and is well worth it. TOTAL: Me and the wife spend tops $20 when we go.\n\n\\#1 - Chitpotle  \nChitpotle is very good for hacking. Prices are already pretty fair, but if you know how to hack you can get for super cheap. Plus we all know its good, filling and pretty healthy where u dont feel all greasy and sleepy after u eat it. By hacking prices, I mean download their app and order everything as a side along with some tortillas. go home and make your own buritto and youll be able to make TWO burritos for about $10-$15 bucks and again, thats for TWO ppl! a true value and hits ALL varibles while going under $20 range.\n\n\\*BONUS: CocoShrimp  \nthere's this place here called cocoshrimp, where it's just shrimp with rice or as a taco. If the wife and i feel like spluring a lil more than usual, we go here. EXTREMELY filing, delicious, pretty healthy and worth the value becasue u get a lot of food. It's about $25-30 for TWO ppl.\n\nWe go to one of these places, prob once every weekend. NEVER UberEats/ food deliver these food to you. the upcharge and fee markup is TOO crazy.

{"title": "What are some frugal \"hacks\" that are not only frugal but actually superior to the alternative?", "selftext": "Two things come to my mind:\n\n1. Using safety razors rather than cartridge razors.\n\nWhen i was a broke student I could never afford the cartridges. They were usually sold in packs of 4 for 16 euros, witch at the time was a fortune for me, so I had to use the same, dull cartridge for months usually.\n\nAfter I discovered safety razors I never went back. Not only are they more versatile but the blades are dirt cheap. I bought a 100 blades for 15 euros, witch is probably going to last me a few years. I had my butterfly style safety razor for 10 years now and it still looks like new. It cost 30 euros and still looks like new (A year ago I got an other razor for about 12 euros that is also full metal and looks like it could last a lifetime). In the past 10 years I have probably saved hundreds on cartridges.\n\nCompared to the cartridge razors I can only see benefits, so using safety razors is not only much cheaper, but (at least to me) they are much more superior.\n\n2. Loose tea\n\nI drink a lot of tea and a few months ago I switched to loose tea rather than using tea bags.\n\nIts simple: they are cheaper and much better tasting. Its not a huge saving as tea bags are not that expensive, but this is also the same principle as the razors, I can get a superior product for cheaper. I see no drawbacks. I put a teaspoon of tea leaves in my little tea holder thingy, and I can get a liter of strong tea.\n\nThere are a lot of frugal things/strategies that can save you money.

{"title": "Shopping around for car insurance is a fantastic way to reduce your monthly expenses", "selftext": "I know that this might be common knowledge, but it should be emphasized. It is too easy to become comfortable with your insurer and be slow to look at other options, even if they are hiking your premiums. I delayed getting quotes until my increased payment was coming due and I really didn\u2019t want to pay it.\n\nProgressive raised my monthly premium from $119 to $160 when my first 6-month plan with them renewed recently. A 25% increase was shocking to me, idk if that is normal for policy renewals but damn. This was the absolute bare bones policy too. First car, bought it outright and plan to drive it until it gives out. It\u2019s a great car but it\u2019s not worth anything, at least in regard to comprehensive/collision. The deductibles would take over half of the ACV. \n\nI went to go browse new insurance quotes and got a few from a quote site. I picked Progressive first so to see what they\u2019d say. Surprisingly, I got a much better policy for 27% less than my older shittier policy. I went from:\n\n- No underinsured/uninsured bodily injury coverage to 25k/50k\n\n- 25k/50k/15k liability to 25k/50k/50k\n\n- 5k medical payments to 10k\n\nI know it\u2019s not an impressive policy but it works for my circumstances and is drastically better than my previous policy. It\u2019s likely it will comfortably protect me if an accident were to happen and that\u2019s all I really need. $160 to $116 is no joke, especially in the uncertain times of today. \n\nAll it took was filling out a few online quotes, seeing that I could get better coverage for less than I\u2019m paying now, and checking if Progressive had anything better to offer. Just had to call them up, give them the quote number, start the policy, cancel the old one. I\u2019m astounded by how easy it was. Took 45 minutes max. \n\nIt may not work for all, but I recommend looking! Cancellations are often no-penalty, some have a flat charge (around $50).

Especially when you need a specific shape or size and wow look you only have the crappy small ones and also you're in a bad mood from getting cut or whatever.\n\nAll you need are gauze pads, which my local grocery store has a pack of 25 for $4.75, and [3M Micropore Tape](https://www.exmed.net/3m-micropore-paper-tape) which is like less than a dollar for a roll.\n\nThe gauze pads are folded into 8 squares, and I can cut one out and fold it up to make the absorbent pad. Then i stick it on a length of the micro pore tape.\n\nThis is beyond superior for numerous reasons:\n\n1. Way cheaper. The two items listed above total less than 6 dollars, which is just a bit cheaper than a pack of 30 band-aids. With just one box of gauze and one roll of tape, there is enough to make *at least* 200 bandages, and that's with generous helpings of gauze and tape. Even the 100 pack of assorted shapes and sizes is like 11 bucks at my grocery store. This is a no brainer already.\n2. Way more performant: Each 1/8th square of gauze folds up into a considerably thicker and softer pad than a regular band aid. It's more absorbent and covers a wider area by default. They stick better to your skin. You never need to do that thing where you realize its peeling off and stick it back down and hope it stays till you get back home.\n3. Plays better with water: lets be real here: unless you're using those space-age TegaDerm things, band aids aren't water resistant at all. When they do get wet, they either fall off or get gross as hell. I've showered with my makeshift bandages and they dry out quickly and don't get gross. I actually have to remember to change them out because of how well they hold up.\n4. More customizable. Since you make it yourself, you can just make it whatever shape you want. You can make it as big or as small as you want. You will never again look through your medicine cabinet and realize you need to drop 10 bucks on another box of the big ones.\n5. Sustainable: Its cotton and paper. Completely biodegradable. Regular band-aids are usually plastic, so you might as well go for the option that will break down and return to nature.\n6. For what it's worth, its easier to take off. It rips easier for when its wrapped around your finger, and it doesn't hurt when you pull it off sensitive skin.\n\nPersonally, I notice this all the time. Things purpose-made for convenience aimed at the consumer market are usually not that much more convenient at all, and are actually quite crap.

Here's the easy way to grow food.", "selftext": "If you are feeling like you can't possibly grow anything, I'm here to assure you that you can.\n\nGrow bags are a simple, economical way to get started.  You want to add potting mix to grow bags.  Some plants, like tomatoes and peppers, need a fairly large grow bag, like 10 gallons.  Others, like lettuces, can happily grow in a 1 gallon bag.\n\nYou can get fancy and add specialty potting mixes if you want, like outdoor potting mix or mix that already has fertilizer in it (e.g. Miracle Gro).  You can also make your own potting mix with a 1:1:1 mix of vermiculite or perlite, peat moss or coco coir, and compost.  Aim for 5 different kinds of compost if possible.  There is no shame in buying premixed soil!  Don't make this difficult!\n\nFertilizer.  Unless you buy the pre-fertilized bags, you will need fertilizer.  Plants really don't care where their nutrients come from, so you don't have to use organic, but that's an option you can choose.  Follow label directions.  Some plants, like tomatoes, need a little bit more help, like bone meal.  \n\nYou can buy seeds or plants from a nursery.  The frugal way, of course, is seeds.  But if you're starting out with one or two grow bags, a plant start from the nursery is perfectly acceptable.  \n\nIt's smart to know what pests want to eat your plants.  There are lots of simple things that work, like neem oil.  Insect netting is great for plants that don't need to be pollinated, like kale.  \n\nSoil, food, sunshine, and water.

Grocery stores sometimes will sell you produce that is too old to sell, but still edible if cooked right away. Don't be ashamed to ask your local grocer!\n\n3. No entertainment expenses. Library or bust. There is also a lot on youtube or free streaming, including tutorials, movies, exercise classes and music.\n\n4. Bored or anxious? Take a long walk in the woods or clean your house with music blaring.\n\n5. Invite friends to your place for coffee/tea and snacks instead of going out. Throw a pot luck for games or movie nights.\n\n6. Pay attention to free or discount days at your local museums or attractions. \n\n7. Borrow things from friends/family.

{"title": "Saving money with other people?", "selftext": "One thing I hardly ever see discussed in the big \"how to save money\" threads are ways to work with other households to save money. How do you and your friends or family work together to save? I have a few, but I'd love to hear from other people!\n\nWITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY\n\n* **Set up a family phone plan with friends -** I pay about $35/mo for an unlimited data plan because I have eight people on my phone plan. You need reliable people, but this is great because 1) you get the credit card points 2) your friends/family are outsourcing having to deal with the phone company for travel, renegotiating contracts, etc. 3) if someone in your life is on a weird pay schedule, they can negotiate what day of the month they pay their bill. \n* **Clothing swaps -** once or twice a year a few ladies and I will get together and shop each other's donation piles. One person is designated as host and another as the donation person who will take the rest of the stuff to the thrift store. \n* **Borrow instead of buy -** Again, you do need reliable friends for this! But it is a huge money, time, and space saver in an apartment. Who has a sewing machine? A shop vac? An angle grinder? Hair clippers? A portable stove? A cat carrier? I assume most people already do this to some degree, but there are so many things we buy instead of pausing to ask \"wait, could I just borrow this from someone?\" Make sure other people know what you can offer too!\n* **Bulk buying and memberships -** if you live in an apartment, bulk buying can be kind of tough. BUT coordinating with a couple of friends can help. Especially for things that require a membership (like Costco) or will kill you in shipping (like a bulk order from a wholesaler). I just put the call out if I'm making one of these big orders or trips and then people pay me back. (Bonus tip: you can buy things like bulk, cheap, scent free lotion from a spa supplier or soap making supplier. Or spices and condiments from a restaurant supplier. Saves me a ton of money). \n* **Reciprocal chores -** I learned this from my mom. She would coordinate with the other poor single moms in our neighborhood and they would help each other out. Like, maybe one mom would babysit while the others got an empty house to do chores. She'd get repaid in something like having someone sell the stuff she's been meaning to list on eBay for her. The best is if you can find someone who will **negotiate your phone and internet**. I know someone like this who managed to help friends contact their internet provider and got them each *free iPads* in addition to almost halving their monthly bill.\n\nCITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD\n\n* A community garden plot (in my experience) is pretty cheap and covers a lot of the start up energy and cost of having your own garden. And you can get some pretty good advice and free produce from the other folks who garden there. \n* Check out your local community college. IMO this is up there with libraries in terms of benefit to the community. You can get a library card as a non-student (this is true of universities, too). There are often lectures, workshops, \"field trips,\" community resources, classes, and events that are free or affordable and open to the community. \n\nWhat did I miss?

When they shut down a store, everything inside has to go -- and the best deals hit in the final day or two. Some stores are already closed, but if yours is still open, now\u2019s the time to scope it out.\n\nI went to my local Macy\u2019s on the last day and was shocked by what was left and how cheap everything was. A week earlier, stuff was marked down maybe 40\u201360%, but by the end? 80 - 90% off, and some items were basically free.\n\nHere\u2019s what I ended up taking home:\n\nI grabbed several sheet sets for under $5 -- some were 100% cotton, queen size, brand name. One would\u2019ve originally been $60+.\n\nPicked up a couple of Ralph Lauren bath towels for around $2 each. They were plain white, but super thick and soft.\n\nFound a Martha Stewart cast iron Dutch oven for $11. There were only a few left, and people were hoarding them.\n\nBeauty counters had been picked over, but I still managed to get a few Clinique skincare items for a few bucks each, and a MAC lipstick for $3.\n\nMy favorite score was probably a men\u2019s Calvin Klein wool coat. Original price was $275, and I got it for $24.\n\nI also picked up a handful of kids\u2019 clothes for my niece and nephew -- basic tees and little outfits that came out to around $1\u2013$3 a piece.\n\nJewelry was marked way down too. I found a sterling silver necklace in a clearance case for $7, originally tagged at $60.\n\nLuggage was flying out the door, but I got a Samsonite carry-on for $18.\n\nThe checkout line took about an hour because everyone had carts overflowing, and every item still had to be scanned for inventory. The cashiers were exhausted but kind, and honestly, I was just grateful they were still hanging in there at the end.\n\nA few tips if you\u2019re going:\n\nDon\u2019t bother going too early in the sale. The real deals hit the last two days, and sometimes additional discounts are only announced a few hours before closing.\n\nCheck every item. Some boxes were empty or missing parts. A few things were scuffed or damaged from people digging through piles.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying cosmetics or skincare, double-check that they\u2019re sealed and not tampered with.\n\nBe patient.

You will never have to eat ramen again if you know how to shop. I recommend shopping at a large national chain food store for these items as most have generic store brands such as $1 cans of soup, vegetables, bread and boxes of pasta.\n\nThis list will get you delicious AND nutritious meals like grilled cheese or tuna sandwiches and tomato soup, big pots of broccoli and pasta (served with either butter or olive oil, and seasoned with salt and garlic powder), baked beans over toast, cream of mushroom with tuna and mixed veggies over toast or egg noodles, chicken sandwiches, chicken soups, etc. Adding Mom's pro-tip of buying the leftover deli meat and cheese \"ends\" that are usually packaged up and priced at a huge discount. They can be used for fried up baloney or ham sandwiches etc. or tossed in soups. I know the sodium and carb content for this list is probably on the high side but desperate times call for desperate measures.

I grew up always going to cheap Asian salons, so my haircuts as a pre teen and teenager were, by and large, haphazard.

After paying a friend 15 bucks to cut my hair in November 2019 and being semi disappointed by the results, I decided to just let it grow. And now looking back 6 years, that was the last time I ever payed someone to touch my hair. \n\nNow how has that saved me $4000 you may ask? Well, after talking with my coworker about his hair style,I decided to do  some rough math given what he said he payed for a barber. He said he goes normally once a month for 65 bucks. You xtrapolate that times 60 months, and wow, $3900 dollars saved. \n\nNow obviously most people don't go every month, or pay someone 65 bucks, but still, it's the little things that add up. Of course my coworkers hair looks better, but for me embracing the ugly but functional has basically become my brand at this point. Rocking my bushwhack surfer cut has become a symbol/testament of my frugality. Sure I look scruffy, but every dollar that doesn't go towards a haircut for me goes towards my savings.

{"title": "Looking for frugal cooling options for warm bedroom", "selftext": "Before I go into the details of my request for information, none of what I'm proposing will probably be Frugal per some users definition. My personal comfort is paramount especially as I have a heat intolerance, so much in fact that my windows are partially open during most of winter (even when its in single digits) and the heat is only set to 70F. (Heat bills are rarely over 100 a month).\n\nThe Setting:\nI live in a second-floor apartment in a house that is at least 100 years old. The bedroom that I am in has three awning windows located about 5 feet from the floor. These awning windows are approximately 18 inches in height and 38 inches in width. Awning windows for those who don't know, open outward and upward. The largest unobstructed portion of the window is facing down with some on the sides. These awning windows require one to lift the screen and push/pull the window to open. (This is a major hassle in itself). \n\nDuring last summer, I bought a portable AC unit, which struggled to get the temperature down below 73 F (or so). I'm actually shocked I didn't burn the house as my room is on one 15 amp circuit and I only have one grounded outlet. The watt meters should have resulted in tripping the circuit as I had to be at 80% for 3 hours or more. I'm fairly certain I was over 15 amps when checking a few times. \n\nThis room has high sun exposure from the roof with no shade and has an attached crawl space that also heats up like an oven. \n\nThis, if you have continued to read my novel are the non-winter and the summer cooling options combined. A few days ago it got up to 70 F, and even with the windows open, the following morning was 71 F in my room. When I went to bed it was 75 F. \n\nOption A: The actual option that will work without fail. I pay below market rent. This would involve ordering double-hung windows, reframing the walls, and exterior siding. I easily estimate this to be at least $6,000.00. \n\nOption B: Replace the awning windows. The cheapest option would be horizontal roller windows (which I personally hate with a passion of a thousand suns) or install a paired casement. As this is not my house, I would just install the cheapest vinyl crap you can buy. Horizontal Rollers would probably cost about 1500, while casements would probably be about 2500 or so. Casement windows are more expensive. \n\nOption C (Non-AC): Purchase shelving units that are about to the height of the windows (that's five feet) and have two fans (quiet ones) where one will hopefully attempt to bring in outside air while the other one will attempt to push that air outside. I estimate this option to cost about 300-400. The fans need to be quiet at least mostly. \n\nOption C (AC): This is only an option for when its constantly above 70 F. Increase the amount of insulation wrap around the extended hoses (dual hose portable ac) in an attempt to keep the heat inside the hoses and thus pushed outside of the house. \n\nOption D (AC): Measure how much clearance I have on the awnings and purchase a GE ClearView AC unit. This has an inverted U. If enough clearance exists, it's probably possible to get the outside portion of the AC unit outside. The downsides of this are that it will be super easy to damage the awning window (and glass) and potentially it could fall out without something to ensure the unit is being held into place. \n\nOther options considered: I've considered a mini-split, however given that installation cost and the need to run another circuit and power lines. I think it will just be too costly. \n\nDue to reasons unrelated, Option C (Non-AC/AC) are probably the only realistic options budget wise but I know effectiveness is going to be marginal at best. \n\nThe question I am asking is, what's the frugal option here? I'm also open to other options that I may not have thought about. Asking the landlord to take care of this is not an option as this is a ME problem. I also have several electronics in my room that produce heat as waste.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1ji805u/looking_for_frugal_cooling_options_for_warm/", "created_utc": 1742759464.0, "score": 3, "author": "monsieurvampy", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1ji805u/looking_for_frugal_cooling_options_for_warm/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

We got pre-approved for a 250k loan through Neighbors bank for USDA guaranteed.\n\nWe have mostly found houses in the 175k range. There would be 0 down payment. We have 15k liquid savings, and cash to close without concessions is estimated to be 8k-10k.\n\nWe have no other debt besides my student loans (29k) and a car loan with only 5k remaining. Fiance stays at home and we are getting married this year. Our son is 10 months old. I have an accounting degree and am currently an accounting manager.\n\nAm I stupid for trying to buy, given my situation? We already pay $1400 in rent every month\u2026It feels crazy that it\u2019s actually within my grasp now, but I don\u2019t want to jump the shark. I ran the numbers, and we\u2019d still have 2k of income to save or spend after accounting for all expenses with a mortgage in this range.\n\nWe are probably going to make an offer on a 175k home for list price and 5-6% concessions. It\u2019s been on the market for 42 days and there aren\u2019t many buyers in the current market. There are also currently no offers. The home is directly across the street from the elementary school. The USDA guaranteed loan is 0 down, and I\u2019m pretty sure the house is going to appraise for 180k+ based on comps.\n\n\nWe live pretty frugally. I drive a paid off 2010 Camry, shave my head to save in haircuts, etc. All my clothes are either given to me or from the thrift store, and the vast majority of our grocery budget is simple whole foods that are affordable (leg quarters, frozen veggies, beans, etc). I do have 29k student loans, but my payment is only $118/month. She has a $327 car payment that she only owes 7k on. CC debt is minimal, maybe a couple hundred at a given time. Hell, I even intermittent fast so I don\u2019t spend money on food outside home, as well as drink instant coffee. We go out to dinner once in a blue moon.\n\nFrom the this sub\u2019s standpoint, would I be stupid to do this? I understand that I\u2019m the only one making money and that kinda scares me. I make a good income for my area and age, but what if that stopped? I have an accounting degree and currently work as an accounting manager. Planning to get my CPA soon as well.\n\nWould it be sustainable? We would still have over 2k in income to save/spend/invest after the mortgage, likely utilities, groceries, health insurance, and student loan/car payment. I\u2019d like to save 1K+/20% no matter what, as well as contribute to retirement. \n\nThe sellers verbally agreed to 8k in concessions, which should cover most/all of the closing costs in our area. Once they sign, the biggest thing is getting the inspection scheduled within 7 days and it passing the USDA appraisal (both value and condition).\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1jhgcc1/singleincome_24year_old_dad_got_preapproved_for/", "created_utc": 1742671305.0, "score": 70, "author": "scholarlypimp", "num_comments": 128, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1jhgcc1/singleincome_24year_old_dad_got_preapproved_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I know; \"Duh!\" for people in this sub.  But I want to pass on that you can and you should use 100% of it; no waste.  \n\nThere's only 2/3 meat eaters in our family (depends on if my father visits).  So after the first meal, there's usually still a lot of chicken left over.  I would usually strip all the meat from the bones; separate out the skin.  Save the meat, skin separately; put bones in freezer.  The meat is well-seasoned and can be redeployed in other meals easily (burritos, chicken salad, pho in our case).  Put skin in toaster oven on broil to make cracklings.  The bones makes delicious broth for soup.  If there's enough dripping, I would save that too to make gravy.  Toss the bag though.\n\nFor example, I bought this one last week.  Meal 1 was the chicken as is, some left over fried rice and slaw.  Meal 2 was pho with chicken.  The cheat was using the ready pho bowls from Costco.  My wife (Vietnamese) used the seasoning packs to make the soup, add a lot of cilantro, bean sprouts, and also add additional dried pho to make a big meal.  Not traditional, but good enough, and not a lot of efforts.  Meal 3 was dried ramen with the cracklings made from the skin.  Meal 4 was a big pot of chicken curry with the rest of the meat and some potato/carrot.  Enough to last 2/3 meals.  Meal 5 coming up will be using the bones to make broth for porridge.  (I usually use 3 Costco chicken's worth of bones to make a big pot of broth.)\n\nSo that $5 usually gets us maybe 5+ meals for us, depending on what we decide to cook.  If there's other things we can do, I am happy to learn.

{"title": "Confirm my ideas about phone battery preservation?", "selftext": "I've discovered three things when it comes to preserving the battery life of my phone:\n\n1. Most of the degradation comes from holding the battery at near maximum charge. Toggling a power saving setting to limit the charge to ~80% keeps the battery from degrading as fast\n2. Keeping power saving on will offset the limited battery. It more or less causes most apps that rely on passive updates to give delayed updates. I.e. discord pings show up 10-20 minutes after the fact. But if the app is that important you can override the battery setting to have it always passively running.\n3. Plugging in the phone to charge degrades the charging port. It's best to save that for on-the-go situations and instead charge wirelessly at home if you can afford a wireless charging station.\n\nCan redditors here confirm what I've learnt?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1jd2vgn/confirm_my_ideas_about_phone_battery_preservation/", "created_utc": 1742179893.0, "score": 3, "author": "terabix", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1jd2vgn/confirm_my_ideas_about_phone_battery_preservation/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

One of the pics included the original sell by date, which also included the price ($10+ for the chicken thighs). It was obvious the poster had no clue about how to preserve food\u2014the most basic of which is to freeze it. This stresses the importance of knowing how to preserve food you have or obtain. \n\nI grew up in poverty and raised my kinds in poverty during their early years, so I gained a LOT of knowledge about preserving food. A neighbors garden produced tons of tomatoes or zucchini? Preserve it instead of letting it rot. Food bank overflowing with peaches or apples and it\u2019s take however many you\u2019d like? Preserve them. You made too much chili or spaghetti sauce you won\u2019t eat before it goes bad? Preserve it. \n\nThere are many ways to preserve food\u2014the most easiest for many foods is to freeze it. There\u2019s also dehydration (great for most fruits, veggies, and herbs), canning, fermenting, salting and smoking. \n\nLearning ways to preserve food can save a lot of money and increase your food security. (Just make sure you\u2019re using a tested and safe way to preserve food, especially if you\u2019re just starting out.)\n\nBTW, According to the USDA, frozen meat kept at 0\u00b0F (or lower) is safe to eat indefinitely, but for best quality, use uncooked steaks, roasts, or chops within 4 to 12 months, uncooked ground beef within 3 to 4 months, and cooked beef within 2 to 3 months. So buy the meat at your grocery store that has been discounted because it\u2019s close to the sell by date and they need to make room for the incoming meat. Put it in the freezer and eat it later.

{"title": "What would happen if everyone in the U.S became frugal all at once?", "selftext": "I wonder how screwed the economy would get if everyone became frugal and financially savvy all at once. Not extremely so, but just enough that people take pride in finding deals and are always price conscious and price shop, avoid financially ruinous activities like gaining expensive credit card debt or other predatory financial products. \nObviously this would lead to a race to the bottom for many goods. name brands and recognition start to lose appeal unless its items with large and noticeable quality/longevity differences. Everyone becomes hyper aware of excesses and luxuries they no longer \u201cneed\u201d in their life. nothing incredibly extreme like only one pair of shoes until you wear holes in them, but suddenly your home that has an \u201cextra\u201d bedroom or too seems wasteful, so you desire to downsize or rent out your extra bedrooms, you buy economy cars that are just as reliable and efficient with gas savings as possible, and only really ditch them when the repairs are getting more than the value or the ride is super rough. People still eat out rarely, but tend to avoid restaurants but if they do go out take the left overs home, and prefer the budget $10 meals like chipotle etc, skipping the soft drinks. People also become financially savvy, and expensive financial products are no longer very profitable like keeping credit card debt and interest, expensive stock funds that are actively managed, everyone starts moving to more efficient and low cost investing strategies etc.\n\nWould this immediately turn into an economic depression as spending, retail, and finance industries plummet?

{"title": "Ways to save on bills (all kinds)?", "selftext": "Hi, I just came across this sub and was hoping you all could offer me some advice on how to save money. I live alone (except for my furry and feathery family). This is gonna be a pretty long post, but I'm gonna put everything into categories. Feel free to ask questions and offer advice on any of this stuff.\n\n**My Location**\n\nNorth Central Florida\n\n**My House**\n\nDouble-wide mobile home, bought by my parents in 1986, with additions by my dad. I inherited it from my mom upon her death. Lived here since I was 7.\n\n**Work and Pay**\n\nSetting aside the rather substantial savings that I have (from both me and my mom putting money aside over the years), I want to be able to live on my wages (so as to not have to touch my savings) and perhaps grow my savings.\n\nThat said, I typically work 18-19.5 hours per week (3 days on, 4 days off), lately, and recently got a pay increase to $14.99 per hour. That's gross, though. They take away stuff for Medicare, Vision, 401(k), stock purchase, and taxes (I have them take out more taxes than necessary, so I'm guaranteed a refund every year). I make the net equivalent of roughly $8-$10 per hour.\n\n**Power Company and Monthly Usage**\n\nI get my power through Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative. It doesn't have fixed peak hours, but it does issue [Beat The Peak](https://www.wrec.net/beat-peak) alerts.\n\nMy latest bill, covering 1/15 (reading: 33870) to 2/13 (reading: 33992) and with a usage of 122 kWh, was $51.41. The breakdown is: customer charge: $39.16, energy charge: $6.09, fuel adjustment: $4.88, FL gross receipts tax: $1.28.\n\n**Heater/Thermostat**\n\nNone. I just bundle up in the winter.\n\n**Air Conditioner**\n\nOnly in the summer and only for an hour or two in the evening to dehumidify the house and get the temperature a bit lower. Shut off before I go to bed. I'm very tolerant of the heat, and the air conditioner is loud; I can't watch TV with it on.\n\n**Water Heater**\n\nProbably around a decade old. I don't remember, exactly. Replaced the original one.\n\nI recently began experimenting with just turning off the power to the water heater entirely and turning it on only around an hour before I shower (and I don't shower every day, only a few times per week) and do the laundry (no more than twice per month). I apparently used 221 kWh during the previous bill's billing cycle, so this has seemingly worked for me, knocking $9.13 off my bill.\n\n**Light Bulbs**\n\nI don't have any LED light bulbs. They're all the old kind. And I change them so infrequently that I still have 3 unused ones (60 watt equivalent, 43 actual watts used) left from back when my mom was alive (4.5 years ago).\n\nI don't turn on the lights that often. I might briefly turn on a light in the kitchen or living room when I want to turn on the TV at night, but otherwise I watch TV in the dark. I might turn on a light or two in the kitchen if I wait until after dark to cook dinner. I turn on the light when I use the bathroom at night (but rarely get us specifically to use the bathroom).\n\nI don't hang out in my bedroom and simply use the flashlight on my phone to get to bed every night. I might turn on the front porch light briefly to feed the one or two kitties that visit my porch. The one light that I make the most use of is a lamb on a bookcase near my computer desk.\n\nAll of that said, would I save any money at all by replacing the bulbs that I *do* use with LED bulbs?\n\nWhat about removing the ones that I don't use? Do they use any power just by being screwed in?\n\n**Misc Stuff Plugged In**\n\nRecently unplugged these: color-changing night light for the kitties (was constantly on), treadmill, various night lights (almost never used), Echo Dot (used no more than once or twice per day, if that).\n\nAre surge protectors plugged in (but turned off and with nothing plugged into them) using power? Should I unplug these?\n\nWhat about my cell phone's plug and charging cable? Should I unplug it when my phone isn't being charged?\n\n**Living Room**\n\n50\" 4K onn TV, PlayStation 5, and Sony 4K Blu-ray player are plugged into a surge protector. This outlet has a switch near it that allows me to shut off the power to the whole thing. Should I do that when I'm not using the TV?\n\nA rarely-used lamp (see above) is on the back wall.\n\n**Kitchen**\n\nGE electric range (year unknown). That's it. Rarely use the oven (except on days like today, when I felt like baking a pizza). Cook a meal (usually ground meat, ramen, mashed potatoes, beans, or canned veggies) on one of the burners once (maybe twice) per day. Just turned off the clock. Is there anything more energy efficient that I could get?\n\n**Dining Room**\n\nThis is where my computer (an all-in-one hp purchased in 2020) is. I got a glowing keyboard and mouse separately, because they look cool. Would I save any money by plugging the original keyboard and mouse back in?\n\nWhat about turning off the surge protector (which has lights) at night?\n\nI shut down the computer every night. I typically don't turn it on until I'm ready to use it. If I get into watching TV after I come home from work, I might not even turn on the computer at all on those days.\n\n**Refrigerators**\n\nI have two full-sized fridges (freezer on top). Both have been unplugged for a long time. I got a Hisense mini fridge and stuck it in the pantry. Sufficient for my needs.\n\n**Garage**\n\nHotpoint washer (a few years old). Old, loud Kenmore dryer. Sears garage door opener probably dating back to the 1970s (we brought it with us from Chicago).\n\nI just turned off the power to the garage entirely, since I park outside and rarely do the laundry.\n\n**Internet**\n\n$52 per month. Centurylink.\n\n**Water**\n\nAfter decades of using well water, the county made us get public water (so they could charge us for it) in January of 2021. My brother-in-law and his son came down and set everything up. Latest bill (for 1/3 to 2/3) is $2016. Broken down, that's: water base charge: $12.72, water (4,000 gallons @ $1.86 per 1,000 gallons): $7.44.\n\n**Food**\n\nI often have ground meat for dinner, usually 99% lean ground turkey. Sometimes mashed potatoes, canned corn, or peas. I get a bunch of bananas every so often.\n\nI buy a 40-pack of Great Value water and keep it in the car (my cats have sometimes punctured the bottles when I keep it in the pantry). On my days off from work, I try to drink around 6-8 16.9-ounce bottles daily. On my days at work, I work outside, so I drink the water that they supply us.\n\nIf I don't worry about getting the water cold by fridging the bottles, it might be more cost-effective to buy gallon jugs and just chug straight outta those.\n\nI have four cats, one of which is less than a year old, so I'm buying kitten food for all of them until August 5. Usually a bag of Meow Mix or 9 Lives. Occasionally wet food. I probably have to get two bottles of litter per month. They're super poopers. I have two cockatiels and two parakeets, but I don't need to buy food for them nearly as often.\n\n**Streaming Services**\n\nMax is currently on a one-year ad-free subscription for $106.45. I had meant to switch it to ad-supported but forgot.\n\nRecently switched over Paramount+ from ad-free annual to ad-supported annual ($65.80) and Apple TV+ from ad-supported monthly to ad-supported annual ($108.58). My reasoning here was, even though I don't watch stuff that often, they're annual charges, not monthly charges, and they're cheaper in the long run.\n\nOther monthly streaming charges that can't be switched to annual: Netflix ad-supported ($8.76), Disney+ Duo Basic ad-supported ($12.05)\n\nMonthly streaming charges that I haven't switched to annual yet: Amazon Prime ($15.09), Amazon Music ($12.05)\n\nAs I said, I don't watch much. I want to, but I never seem to have the time. Since I can view YouTube on my TV, my viewing time is often sucked up by reaction videos.\n\nI'm basically keeping these subscriptions going out of convenience. I don't like the idea of waiting until I feel like watching something, getting a one-month subscription, and having to set aside the time to watch all of that one thing and then cancel my subscription. Do you think it might be more cost-effective to simply rent/buy the specific things that I want to watch (assuming that's even an option for everything)?\n\n**Car/Gas/Mileage**\n\nI have a 2009 Nissan Versa (bought in November of that year). It has 60,000+ miles on it. I work a half-mile from home (I drive home for lunch), so I don't make much mileage. On my days off, I might visit various thrift stores in my town or to do some grocery shopping. Might drive to another city to see a movie occasionally (I drove over an hour to get to a theater that played *Bottoms* and over an hour to another one that played *Love Lies Bleeding*; totally worth it). I make trips to big cities 2-3 times per year as a treat (such as on my birthday). I fill up on gas once or twice per month.\n\nI no longer service my car at the dealer but go to a local guy that runs a shop out of his house, near mine.

With that changing, I\u2019ve been looking at buying recently, and after running the numbers, I got a brutal reality check \u2014 a glimpse into a system so broken I can\u2019t even believe we got to this point.\n\nAt current interest rates, the cost of interest over the term of the loan is more than the cost of the actual house. I\u2019d be paying for 2 houses and then some. Okay, that pissed me off.\n\nWhat really pissed me off even more is finding out that all the interest is front-loaded, so you\u2019re building almost no equity in the first 10-15 years. That INFURIATED me. Like what the fuck? We\u2019re all just making banks rich to be able to have a sliver of a taste of home \u201cowner\u201dship.\n\nPart of me feels like I\u2019m falling into the victim mindset and I just need to adapt and treat it like a challenge to overcome \u2014 to play the game to the best of my ability.\n\nThe other part of me wants to lead a revolution against what seems like a horribly fucking asinine system. How can I get to a point of acceptance for something that\u2019s completely stacked against the people? It makes me feel like a cow in a tiny pen just getting milked for all I\u2019m worth \u2014 giving every last drop of money, energy, emotional stability \u2014 and getting in return just barely enough to survive to continue getting milked again the next day.\n\nThese interest payments are basically a tax if you think about it. You\u2019re already getting taxed 25-30% on your income, and then in order to afford a home, you\u2019re getting taxed another 25-30% roughly because all that money is getting pissed away to the bank in interest or mortgage and auto loans. It\u2019s just another form of tax, arguably even worse, because at least your income tax goes to contributing to society to a degree. Mortgage interest and the like just goes directly to the big bank execs, for the \u201cprivilege\u201d of being able to afford a roof over your head or reliable transportation.

Whatever, these have now been filtered out into mascarpone. \n\nIn total I got about 1 quart + 2 cups of output; I flavored most of it with maple syrup, honey and vanilla but I reserved 1 cup of plain yogurt for sauces and such. It would have been less if I filtered the whey through my muslin cloth but my weirdo kids prefer to drink their yogurt (seriously) so I intentionally kept a lot of the whey and will just stir it back in before serving because it will separate in the jar.  \n\nAt the store, this much yogurt and a little farmers cheese would run me about $10 right now. The milk was about $3, I used some of the last batch of yogurt for culture so I didn\u2019t pay for that. It\u2019s not a huge savings but it all adds up.

{"title": "Frugal game night with friends", "selftext": "I know it comes up here pretty frequently that people who want to cut back are worried about how to maintain friendships if they aren't going out/going out to eat. \n\nI'm having friends over tonight to play cards, and I estimate that the entire meal and dessert for 5 people cost around $20, definitely less than $25 (pork posole and a fruit plate, if you're  and there will probably be leftovers.  I can only estimate, because since of the ingredients were bought some time ago, and were probably on sale, but I don't remember, and I have no idea how much a single onion cost, or what the amount of spices I'll use costs.  If I had actually been trying for a cheap meal, a pot of pinto beans and cornbread could feed us for probably less than $6, or I could make it a potluck style meal, but frugality was not my primary concern when choosing this meal.\n\nI already have cards, but even if I were starting from scratch and had to buy a deck of cards, I could get cards for a dollar at Dollar General.\n\nI don't do game nights because it is frugal, I do it because they're fun, so I have games that I spent $40 on, but if I break down the cost to a per use basis it's still pretty frugal, pennies per use per person.  I have some games bought at thrift stores for $3 to $5 that would have been worth it just for one evening's entertainment. If you play cards much at all the per-use cost for a decent Bicycle deck gets really low, really fast.\n\nI really think for absolute frugality, cards are a great entertainment option. Decks of cards are cheap, and you can play hundreds of games with them, which can be discovered on free websites like pagat.com or the Bicycle How to Play app. I like books with cards game rules, though, so I can more easily browse through for things to try. The library is great for that, but they're also available pretty cheaply secondhand on eBay, or if you get lucky, local thrift stores.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some games with a specialty deck like Phase 10 are variations of games that can be played with standard cards, with a few special cards like \"skip\" addded in (Phase 10 is basically rummy, and I prefer contract rummy without the skip cards). Rook is another game with a special deck that can be adapted easily to a standard deck. Google is your friend when looking to see if a game you like can be played with a standard deck (or in the case of Phase 10, two decks).\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1j5tcke/frugal_game_night_with_friends/", "created_utc": 1741366427.0, "score": 26, "author": "CraftyCrafty2234", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1j5tcke/frugal_game_night_with_friends/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Got laid off, so I went all-in on living frugally. Here's what I did.", "selftext": "Strap in, it's gonna be a long one.\n\nIn January of 2024, my second daughter was born.  Unfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my paternity leave of just 4 weeks, my company laid me off with an okay severance package (2 months of pay).  I decided during this time that after 10 years of 55+ hour weeks, I wanted a better work-life balance -- especially now that I have a second child.\n\nUnfortunately, I had not anticipated how insane the job market was, so after hundreds of job applications, 20+ interviews, 10+ interview project assignments, and getting to the final round 5 times, I still couldn't find a job going brand-side.  I had to make a pivotal decision -- go back to agency world where I'll likely burn out sooner or later, or attempt to forge my own path with my own clients.  I decided spending time with my family was more important than a bigger paycheck, so I decided to start off on my own consulting/freelancing.\n\nOf course, this meant that cash flow would limited for a while until I was able to build out my client base, so I set off reducing my recurring expenses as much as possible.\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nNetflix|Monthly|$17.99|$17.99|$215.88\nCrunchyroll|Annual|$79.99|$6.67|$79.99\nAmazon Prime|Annual|$139.00|$11.58|$139.00\nOn Demand Korea|Annual|$139.99|$11.67|$139.99\nYoutube Premium|Monthly|$22.99|$22.99|$275.88\nSpotify|Monthly|$19.99|$19.99\t|$239.88\nT-Mobile|Monthly\t|$100.00\t|$100.00\t|$1,200.00\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nLastPass\t|Monthly\t|$4.00\t|$4.00\t|$48.00\nChase Sapphire Reserve\t|Annual\t|$550.00\t|$45.83\t|$550.00\n\nThe above came out to $242.38/month or $2,908.61 annually.  I then cut out as much as I could then replaced the more expensive services with cheaper ones.\n\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nStremio + RD\t|Annual\t|$34.54\t|$2.88\t|$34.54\nOn Demand Korea\t|Annual\t|$139.99\t|$11.67\t|$139.99\nYoutube Premium\t|Monthly\t|$22.99\t|$22.99\t|$275.88\t\t\t\nMint Mobile\t|Annual\t|409.28\t|$34.11\t|$409.28\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nBitwarden\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\nAAA Daily Advantage\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\n\nThe new recurring costs came out to $73.31/month or $879.68 annually.\n\n* Netflix, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime were replaced with Stremio + Real-Debrid (note: this may be a controversial move for some, but I'll be honest -- with the ever increasing subscription prices, I don't feel too bad about going the Stremio + RD route until I get back on my feet).  \n* On Demand Korea was kept because my tech illiterate mother (who lives separately) has no idea how to operate anything other than a remote control to select a show and press play.\n\n* YouTube Premium was kept if only to make sure my older child does not get exposed to random ads on her approved-only content kids profile.  But additionally, utilizing YouTube Music allowed me to get rid of Spotify.  Not gonna lie, I love Spotify's algorithm for discovering new music much better, but YouTube Music works.  Not to mention that since I work with ads as my career, I'd rather not see more ads in my personal life, and about half the content I consume is on YouTube.\n\n* For Amazon Prime delivery, not having the instant 1-day shipping (because we would need to build up a minimum amount to get free delivery now) actually helped reduce monthly Amazon purchases.  I used to spend, on average, about $100/month on random crap.  Now it's closer to $30/month, and that's mostly essential supplies for the kiddos.\n\n* T-Mobile was a big one.  Since my wife and I both work from home, we hardly used any data.  With Mint Mobile, not only do I get more data to use monthly, it's also significantly cheaper with no noticeable reduction in service quality (YMMV).\n\n* I used to pay for LastPass Family, but after using Bitwarden for a while, I wonder why I didn't swap sooner.  It has basically the same functions as the LastPass Family plan to share passwords with family, but Bitwarden is not only free, but they have a much better track record of not getting hacked.\n\n* Finally, I used to have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card as I used to travel a bit more often.  Now that that will be out of the picture for at least a year or so, I've gotten a free card that pays a higher cash back bonus on my highest spending category -- Costco (3% back on Costco with 5% back on groceries, which includes Walmart).  Also, as I now eat out or DoorDash much less frequently, I was not building up points efficiently on the CSR, so it didn't make sense to keep it.\n\nOther things I did to reduce costs:\n\n* Learn how to bake -- I used to buy cookies and baked goods from Costco pretty much every trip I made (every 2 weeks or so), but now I buy 0.  Instead, I am now baking all the sweet treats that my family wants.  Not only can I now get exactly what I want in the quantity that I want it, it is far, far cheaper (and tastier now that I have a bit more experience baking).  This is easily $30/month in savings.\n\n* Learn how to cook my favorite take-out meals -- burritos, burgers, beef & bean chili, chicken noodle soup, etc.  The only time I ever order take-out now is for the party packs at McDonald's if I'm too tired to cook (once a month max), and maybe a Costco pizza.  Thankfully, I'm not a pizza snob, so I can live with cheap pizza.  This is easily $100/month in savings.\n\n* Start a garden in my backyard -- only did this for 1 year so far, and we were able to replace some of the veggies we buy with the garden.  That said, we started off small, so we probably only saved about $50 bucks of food in the end, which was about how much spent on seeds and equipment.  We are definitely going much bigger this year (2x what we had previously) with proper equipment, so hopefully we can grow much more as we develop our green thumb.  Negligible savings so far, but I'm hoping it'll be in the $100s in savings this year.\n\n* Apply for state help on health insurance costs -- while working at my agency, I had my entire family on my premium health insurance plan, which cost $1,600/month to cover everyone.  But now that my earnings are significantly reduced, my entire family gets health insurance completely for free.  With this cheaper health plan, even if my earnings go up significantly and I pay full price for the insurance, it'll only come out to $950/month.  That is $650/month in savings right there.  Perhaps this isn't the best long-term move because there can be problems with cheaper healthcare, but for now, as I am still \"young\", it will suffice.\n\nAll in, I am saving the following:\n\nItem\t|Old Monthly Cost\t|New Monthly Cost\t|Total Monthly Savings\t|Total Annual Savings\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:\nSubscription Services\t|$242.38\t|$73.31\t|$169.08\t|$2,028.93\nAmazon shopping\t|$100.00\t|$30.00\t|$70.00\t|$840.00\nBaked goods\t|$35.00\t|$5.00\t|$30.00\t|$360.00\nTake-out\t|$150.00\t|$35.00\t|$115.00\t|$1380.00\nHealth Insurance\t|$1,600.00\t|$950.00\t|$650.00\t|$7,800.00\nTotal\t|$2,127.38\t|$1,093.31\t|$1034.08\t|$12,408.93\n\nIf you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read through this.  I hope this will give someone some ideas on how they can cut out extraneous expenses from their lives.  Given how the economy is moving, many of us may need these tips sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat are some other things you have done to reduce your recurring costs?

I ended up with a 2021 Toyota Camry with a 5K down payment and 411 monthly payments (311 principal, 100 interest). I currently have 18K left on the loan.\n\nThe problem? Since I moved, my insurance skyrocketed to 300/month, making my total car-related expenses 711 per month.

I also worry about older, less reliable cars and potential repair costs. especially since I\u2019m a fairly new driver and rely on driver-assist features for safety.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve already sunk 9K (down payment + 9 months of payments), and I\u2019m torn between:\n\nKeeping the Camry and sticking with the 711/month, knowing I'll own it in 5 years.\n\nTrading it in for a cheaper car to potentially save 200\u2013300/month, but risk having a less reliable vehicle and starting over with another loan.\n\nI don\u2019t have much experience or guidance on this, so I\u2019d appreciate any advice.

Advancing in my career and making more money made no difference. My bank account seemed to uncontrollably drain every month. It made no sense to me. My fixed expenses are roughly 35% of my net income and I could not figure out where my money was going. I was spending so much with nothing to show for it. I was racking up credit card debt and not saving anything but I just could not get things under control.\n\nSince getting diagnosed and medicated, everything has changed. I can finally see and understand where my money is going. It was actually shocking to calculate how much money I was wasting on impulse buying crap, food delivery, and alcohol because it was the only thing that could quiet my brain. Now, my impulse spending has stopped completely. I no longer have the urge to go shopping all the time, and when I do, it\u2019s easy to stop myself from buying something and tell myself I\u2019ll go back later if I really need it. But I never go back!\n\nI don\u2019t waste all my money buying groceries then not eating them, or buying junk to binge eat, or getting food delivered multiple times a week because I\u2019m too exhausted to cook after work.\n\nI finally have savings and have even started investing. It\u2019s not much but it still fills me with so much pride and satisfaction to see money in the bank and watch the numbers slowly go up. I get the same enjoyment from not spending money as I used to from spending it.\n\nI know it\u2019s not sustainable to never buy anything frivolous or eat out, so I still budget some fun money every month but I don\u2019t even end up spending it all. And I still have a long way to go and a lifetime of bad habits to change, but it\u2019s so motivating to see the difference and the rewards of my hard work.\n\nCan anyone else relate?

Winter PJs for 30 cents compared to 10 pair of curtains for .96 seems very unequal.

People seemed to like it, so here's more - please add your own!\n\nIn no particular order (was tempted to put it in alphabetical order, but I have already spent too much time on this):\n\n- **Herb packs** used to store home-grown herbs\n\n- **Yogurt cups** for seed starters\n\n- **Broken ceramic** or crockery donated to mosaic makers (try high schools, continuing education or hobby groups)\n\n- **Paper tubes** as art supplies for elementary school teachers. They can also be composted and used in gardening!\n\n- **Old phones** (scrub personal data) for emergency internet access (you can't make calls but can generally get online or use the emergency call setting)\n\n- **Got an appliance with a broken plug?** It's under $5 to get a replacement head and about 5mins to switch them out. It is NOT difficult and you don't need an electrician. Also a great idea if you see a nice appliance while thrifting where the plug seems to be the only issue.\n\n- **Patches** for puffer jackets (et al) are much more attractive than duct tape if you want to spend a few bucks. I've used NoSo in the past for nicer items.\n\n- **Shoelaces** for tying up growing plants\n\n- **Pants hangers** for storing linens or drying/storing gloves and mittens. I've also taken them apart for the clips before. \n\n- **Painters tape** works incredibly well for labeling! Use it to date food items for quick reference (this is a chef trick)\n\n- **Didn't finish your drink?** Freeze the remainder in ice cube trays for a future treat\n\n- **For Dogs** freeze all leftover bits of fruit/veg or unseasoned meat. Think strawberry tops, mushy blueberries, sad bananas etc. Add to bulk out their meals with high-quality product.\n\n- **Stop using expensive peanut butter for dogs!** I make my own mix for licky treats that works incredibly well and has ZERO animal products (Oats, chia seeds, hemp, cinnamon, ginger, leftover treat crumbs. Combine with water to make a claylike mixture. Keeps well in the fridge for 5-7 days)\n\n- **Energy saving.** I *love* me a good nightlight. I've got a bad memory and a penchant for turning on a bunch of lights before wandering away. With a few decent baseboard LED lights I can see what I'm up to at night without turning on every damn overhead. \n\n- **Child-havers,** did you know you can get light switch covers that are a little more difficult to turn on? They essentially have a little hat with an open side. Great for lights you would prefer to stay off most of the time, eg when there are 2 switches and one turns on 3 lights and the other only 1.\n\n- On that note, you know what's better than a $75 big fancy camp lantern that needs $20 worth of batteries? A bunch of cheapo battery-operated tealight candles! They throw a TON of light for their size, have an insanely long battery life and are safe for kids and pets.\n\n- **Cold climate:** If you like to read or sit in the same chair, get a reading lamp and put an old incandescent bulb inside. They throw off just enough heat to keep you cozy at a much cheaper cost than turning up the thermostat.\n\n- Back to socks: fill with uncooked rice/beans, tie a knot or sew shut, and microwave for a heated, uh, noodle? You can buy or make nicer ones, and if you have any older one that won't retain heat simply cut a hole and replace the filling. Some people like to put in dried lavender but I personally find the odor kinda nasty. \n\n- **White wine vinegar**over fabric softener. Vinegar odor goes away and you get nice soft clothes with less lingering body odor.\n\n- **Yes, I rinse out and (immediately) reuse paper towels. Fight me. ;)**\n- **Food storage.** For god's sake, make sure all the lids and bags are closed tightly and double-bagged when necessary. Check every month or so. Finding out all your yeast is dead or there's mold in the flour is always depressing mid-cook.\n\n- **Organization:** If you aren't careful and tidy, storing these items can very quickly become a mess of garbage. Clean everything thoroughly, especially food packaging. Use boxes, bags and add easy-to-read labels.\n\n- **Old contact lens cases** make excellent containers for small amounts of paint or glue. (Pro tip: only put stuff in one socket; use the other to get a decent grip). Also good medication holders for gel cap medications when traveling.\n\n- **Brown paper packaging** can be crumpled and used for gift wrap - add a resused ribbon for flair. I always get compliments! \n\n- **Used greeting cards** can be cut in half and made into postcards or gift labels \n\n- **Dried out nail polish** can be reinvigorated with just a touch of nail polish thinner. If it's REALLY old or particularly unique there's a whole community of collectors who may wish to purchase it! \n\n- **Shoe glue** can fix small footwear issues/holes\n\n- **Cobblers (shoe repair folk)** are still in business in many areas and can re-sole your beloved boots for a second life on the road!\n\nFree from the store (if the store sucks) (like Home Depot):\n- **Countertop sample chips** as scrapers for stickers and paint\n- **Paint sample cards** make lovely gift labels (and they have absolutely deranged names; my brother got one called Cargo Pants this year)\n- **Paint stirrers** for plant labels and shims\n\nI probably have more, but let's start here!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1iy1zgs/buckle_up_buttercups_my_big_frugal_savings_list/", "created_utc": 1740508055.0, "score": 143, "author": "ivegotcheesyblasters", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1iy1zgs/buckle_up_buttercups_my_big_frugal_savings_list/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Not looking for anything too fancy just a simple gold coloured band.\n\nI'm looking at 14k goldplated rings on AliExpress (I've noticed a lot of ring sellers reselling these for crazy markup) they go for not much at all, probably the equivalent of approximately $10. \n\nI also noticed these sellers trying to sell tungsten and titanium rings for $100+, which is a scam \u2014 because those metals are worth very little. \n\nOverall I think the price to value ratio seems pretty nice, but I worry about these rings' long-term durability and how it ties in with getting sentimental attachment to one ring that may ultimately need replacing.\n\n**Gold-plated rings:**\n\nI have researched these goldplated \"never fade\" rings and the good PVD/IP (Physical vapor deposition) plated ones will last maybe 10 years or more with regular wear, they are scratch resistant, but not necessarily abusive wear resistant. \nAfter the coating eventually wears off, it's effectively at the end of the road. I am unsure if recoating is a possibility, or the costs involved of doing so.\n\nThese goldplated rings, usually plated tungsten, are not resizable due to the hardness of the base metal. But I could easily buy several sizes and still not be set back much money at all. The advantage is they're disposable and can still perform for years.\n\nIf these rings are lost or stolen, it's no big deal in comparison to losing a wedding ring worth hundreds. Rings are small and easily lost, which reinforces the case for them to be bought cheaply if possible.\n\n**9k gold rings:**\n\nAlternatively I could spend more (\u00a3350 or $442) on a 7mm 9k gold men's ring, it's a comfort ring and the gold content would allow it to hold its value over the years for potential resale if needed. It could therefore serve as a valuable heirloom that's worth a bit. \n\nFrom a sentimental standpoint knowing it'll probably get through a full lifespan without issues is definitely a nice selling point for me.

{"title": "EGGS! All of you complaining about the price of eggs please consider getting your own chickens! Here's the math.", "selftext": "First I will acknowledge that a lof of people can't have chickens because of their living situations and I totally get that. But for anyone with even a small outdoor space, having chickens can not only save you money but make you a few extra dollars.\n\nI have had chickens in many different situations over the last 15 years from small urban backyard to a big rural 1 acre. If you have an outdoor space you can do this.\n\n* BIRDS - $20 per pullet - Pullets are older chicks that can go straight out to the coop and are about to start laying. Do not buy \"used\" adult hens because you will never know how old they are. If you buy laying hens on the classifieds you will be told they are 2 years old and laying great but more likely they are 4-5 and not laying much, which is why someone is getting rid of them.\n* SHELTER - do not spend any money on shelter. Collect some old pallets and used metal sheets to build a coop and run. Chickens are hardy little fuckers - they do not need a fancy insulated coop they only need to be sheltered from the wind. Maybe if you live in Canada you'll need something fancier. Insulate with old clothing and ask your dad for the bucket of screws you know he has in his garage - you don't need to spend ANY money if you're patient and creative.\n* FEEDER/WATERER - Find old 5 gallon buckets (restaurants often have them) and install nipples and feed holes. Suspend them from the ground so rodents can't get in.\n* FEED - $20 commercial layer pellets each month - This might vary a bit, and of course you can go crazy and buy expensive food but you don't need to. Chickens will eat what they're given. Most people you talk to would think that $20 of feed for 9 hens would never be enough, but you have to get creative. Chickens will eat any leftover food scraps you give them. They eat spent grains from brewing beer, old spaghetti, the steak you overcooked, the cat food from your dead cat. They eat squishy heads of lettuce and expired milk and the whey from making your strained yogurt. They eat literally any vegetable crap if you boil it first. They eat squash guts and eggshells and freezer-burned anything. You can also feed them yard waste like grass clippings and weeds and overgrown shrubs and snails you pull off your hostas. You can grow them mealworms or composting worms in a bucket. They will eat the mice you trap in your basement or even roadkill. Give them a huge variety of foods from the beginning and they will learn to eat anything. THIS IS KEY. If your chickens have access to the ground they do not need grit or oyster shell or any other supplement - don't be fooled.\n\nHere are my numbers based on my current flock.\n\n* Total startup costs: 9 pullets ($180) + shelter ($0) + feeder/waterer ($25) = $205\n* Each year I replace half my flock so $90 ongoing yearly cost + $240 in feed = $330 per year\n* My hens lay at 75% year round so 6.75 eggs x 365 days = 2463 eggs (205 dozens) per year\n* These are high quality eggs worth minimum $6/doz x 205 doz = $1230 in eggs every year\n* That's a lot of eggs for one person so I feed a fair amount to my dogs and sell the rest - enough to cover 100% of my costs.\n\nHere are the common pitfalls and why people tend to lose money raising backyard hens:\n\n* They don't put forth any effort into feeding their chickens non-commercial foods. Contact a restaurant to save you food scraps, grow composting worms, have your neighbors collect food scraps. Grow them winter squash, sunflower seeds and corn. IT CAN BE DONE you just have to be creative and do a little work.\n* They buy cute fancy chickens that don't lay much. Buy very productive layers! Anything laying less than 300 eggs a year is a waste of space. I know a little frizzle bantam is the cutest thing you've ever seen but it is not what you want here.\n* They time their pullet buying incorrectly. It's tempting to get the first spring chicks that arrive at the store, but holding out for fall pullets is better. It means they'll start laying right before winter hits and lay right through the cold dark season when most chickens slow down. And buying pullets saves you time and money because you didn't have to raise chicks and feed them for 6 months before they start laying.\n* They don't rotate their flock often enough. These chickens are cute and fun but they are NOT PETS. They will not lay well after they are 2-2.5 years old so GET RID OF THEM. Make soup or dog food or give them to someone who has a retirement home for chickens. Replace half of your flock in the fall each year so that you always have fresh layers going into winter and you're getting rid of the hens that are just going to molt and freeload until spring.\n\nI'd love to hear from others successfully raising chickens and also answer any questions you might have!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1iuzbxw/eggs_all_of_you_complaining_about_the_price_of/", "created_utc": 1740166006.0, "score": 0, "author": "herroorreh", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1iuzbxw/eggs_all_of_you_complaining_about_the_price_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Looking to buy a boogie-board type of product for a toddler. I need something that will withstand the immense pressure she applies, or ideally something that encourages drawing more lightly!", "selftext": "**EDIT** to the post because I anticipate there will be too many comments about this: She uses crayons and paper very often as well, but it requires her to be more closely watched because she can draw on the walls or put the crayons in her mouth. The tablet is a great way to let her draw when someone isn't able to be side by side with her. Also, again, I would like to discourage the pressure behavior--she does it with crayons, too. She has broken the thinner ones and shows no signs of caring, she just uses the little stubs. We have big egg-shaped crayons that she can't break, but again, she's still pressing so hard.\n\nMy baby cousin (2 and a half year old) has been really loving the off-brand boogie board I got her, however, she is pressing on it VERY hard. It's starting to break due to the rough way she draws. She holds whatever object she's drawing with in her fist, and seems to draw with 100% of her strength. I am trying to hold her hand and guide her to draw with less force, but even after hours of one-to-one time, she isn't seeming to get it. Even if we only let her draw with rounded objects, the force she's using alone is not agreeing with the tablet.\n\nNot only is this behavior breaking the tablet, but I also would really like to discourage it in general. I'm an artist who draws way, way, way too hard, and it's a deceptively difficult habit to break. I don't want her building up this bad habit which will put unnecessary strain on her wrist when she's older.\n\nSo, I have two goals, part of one is less realistic\\*\\* but I have to throw out there in case anyone is a miracle worker:\n\n1.) Find something similar that will hold up a little better. She's only had the \"boogie board\" for a few days and it's already looking like it's on its way out at any moment. Something that would last at least a month of potentially constant use and not cost more than 10-20 dollars would be great. Would a name-brand boogie board fit this bill?\n\n2.) **Find something that will in some way discourage this behavior.** I would love it if there was a product that gave her some reason to not do this. The most realistic thing I am looking for is a tablet that does not account for how hard you press. I suspect the reason she likes pressing hard is because the lines get wider and brighter. I am hoping if we gave her something where the lines were always the same no matter what, she won't have a reason to do that anymore. However, from my research it's kind of seeming like the pressure aspect is something inherent to this kind of product. Do I have any options that aren't too pricey?\n\\*\\*A \"dream product\" for me would be **something that doesn't let you draw at all if you're pressing too hard.** That would be surefire way to get her to stop, so if that exists and is a practical product to give to a toddler, please do bring it to my attention.\n\nThanks in advance to everyone!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1iua4pi/looking_to_buy_a_boogieboard_type_of_product_for/", "created_utc": 1740087444.0, "score": 0, "author": "IfUKnowMeKindlyGTFO", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1iua4pi/looking_to_buy_a_boogieboard_type_of_product_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
