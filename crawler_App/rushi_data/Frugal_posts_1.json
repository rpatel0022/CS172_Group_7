{"title": "[Reminder] Amazon Day is a marketing event, not a deal day.", "selftext": "For those who are unaware, Amazon has been doing Prime Day, a day where they claim to have the most amount of deals for 2 years now. However, research, consumer sentiment, analysts are able to show that Prime Day is more about getting users to sign up for Prime and marketing the brand, than it is about providing deals to existing customers.\n\nI strongly recommend you use a historical price checker like CCC or Keepa to actually verify the prices are lower, as it is a common tactic to raise prices before a sale and then trick customers into feeling like they got a deal with a large % drop, like 50% off. Also keep in mind many sites will be pushing the event despite lackluster deals, because they want people to come to their site to see the aggregated 'deals' (getting ad revenue), and some of them will be linking to Amazon for that sweet affiliate money on anything you buy.\n\nHere are the stats:\n\n    Comparing black friday prices to Amazon day:\n    BF Prices for Laptops were 5% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Small Appliances were 3% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Tablets were 7% cheaper\n    BF Prices for TVs were 15% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Video Games were 12%\n    On average prices were 9% lower on BF than prime day.\n    Of 450 best-sellers, only 43 were discounted 10% or more on primeday\n    Adobe's social media tracker found 50% of shoppers were disappointed, 23% felt joy\n    Last year, our staff scanned nearly 8,000 deals and found only 64 worth posting.\n\n\nI would post the numerous links but last time my post was immediately removed (im assuming due to links), I can provide them (hopefully) in the comments if requested.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/6mifa9/reminder_amazon_day_is_a_marketing_event_not_a/", "created_utc": 1499730249.0, "score": 14898, "author": "Put_It_All_On_Blck", "num_comments": 1029, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/6mifa9/reminder_amazon_day_is_a_marketing_event_not_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Got laid off, so I went all-in on living frugally. Here's what I did.", "selftext": "Strap in, it's gonna be a long one.\n\nIn January of 2024, my second daughter was born.  Unfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my paternity leave of just 4 weeks, my company laid me off with an okay severance package (2 months of pay).  I decided during this time that after 10 years of 55+ hour weeks, I wanted a better work-life balance -- especially now that I have a second child.\n\nUnfortunately, I had not anticipated how insane the job market was, so after hundreds of job applications, 20+ interviews, 10+ interview project assignments, and getting to the final round 5 times, I still couldn't find a job going brand-side.  I had to make a pivotal decision -- go back to agency world where I'll likely burn out sooner or later, or attempt to forge my own path with my own clients.  I decided spending time with my family was more important than a bigger paycheck, so I decided to start off on my own consulting/freelancing.\n\nOf course, this meant that cash flow would limited for a while until I was able to build out my client base, so I set off reducing my recurring expenses as much as possible.\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nNetflix|Monthly|$17.99|$17.99|$215.88\nCrunchyroll|Annual|$79.99|$6.67|$79.99\nAmazon Prime|Annual|$139.00|$11.58|$139.00\nOn Demand Korea|Annual|$139.99|$11.67|$139.99\nYoutube Premium|Monthly|$22.99|$22.99|$275.88\nSpotify|Monthly|$19.99|$19.99\t|$239.88\nT-Mobile|Monthly\t|$100.00\t|$100.00\t|$1,200.00\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nLastPass\t|Monthly\t|$4.00\t|$4.00\t|$48.00\nChase Sapphire Reserve\t|Annual\t|$550.00\t|$45.83\t|$550.00\n\nThe above came out to $242.38/month or $2,908.61 annually.  I then cut out as much as I could then replaced the more expensive services with cheaper ones.\n\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nStremio + RD\t|Annual\t|$34.54\t|$2.88\t|$34.54\nOn Demand Korea\t|Annual\t|$139.99\t|$11.67\t|$139.99\nYoutube Premium\t|Monthly\t|$22.99\t|$22.99\t|$275.88\t\t\t\nMint Mobile\t|Annual\t|409.28\t|$34.11\t|$409.28\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nBitwarden\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\nAAA Daily Advantage\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\n\nThe new recurring costs came out to $73.31/month or $879.68 annually.\n\n* Netflix, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime were replaced with Stremio + Real-Debrid (note: this may be a controversial move for some, but I'll be honest -- with the ever increasing subscription prices, I don't feel too bad about going the Stremio + RD route until I get back on my feet).  \n* On Demand Korea was kept because my tech illiterate mother (who lives separately) has no idea how to operate anything other than a remote control to select a show and press play.\n\n* YouTube Premium was kept if only to make sure my older child does not get exposed to random ads on her approved-only content kids profile.  But additionally, utilizing YouTube Music allowed me to get rid of Spotify.  Not gonna lie, I love Spotify's algorithm for discovering new music much better, but YouTube Music works.  Not to mention that since I work with ads as my career, I'd rather not see more ads in my personal life, and about half the content I consume is on YouTube.\n\n* For Amazon Prime delivery, not having the instant 1-day shipping (because we would need to build up a minimum amount to get free delivery now) actually helped reduce monthly Amazon purchases.  I used to spend, on average, about $100/month on random crap.  Now it's closer to $30/month, and that's mostly essential supplies for the kiddos.\n\n* T-Mobile was a big one.  Since my wife and I both work from home, we hardly used any data.  With Mint Mobile, not only do I get more data to use monthly, it's also significantly cheaper with no noticeable reduction in service quality (YMMV).\n\n* I used to pay for LastPass Family, but after using Bitwarden for a while, I wonder why I didn't swap sooner.  It has basically the same functions as the LastPass Family plan to share passwords with family, but Bitwarden is not only free, but they have a much better track record of not getting hacked.\n\n* Finally, I used to have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card as I used to travel a bit more often.  Now that that will be out of the picture for at least a year or so, I've gotten a free card that pays a higher cash back bonus on my highest spending category -- Costco (3% back on Costco with 5% back on groceries, which includes Walmart).  Also, as I now eat out or DoorDash much less frequently, I was not building up points efficiently on the CSR, so it didn't make sense to keep it.\n\nOther things I did to reduce costs:\n\n* Learn how to bake -- I used to buy cookies and baked goods from Costco pretty much every trip I made (every 2 weeks or so), but now I buy 0.  Instead, I am now baking all the sweet treats that my family wants.  Not only can I now get exactly what I want in the quantity that I want it, it is far, far cheaper (and tastier now that I have a bit more experience baking).  This is easily $30/month in savings.\n\n* Learn how to cook my favorite take-out meals -- burritos, burgers, beef & bean chili, chicken noodle soup, etc.  The only time I ever order take-out now is for the party packs at McDonald's if I'm too tired to cook (once a month max), and maybe a Costco pizza.  Thankfully, I'm not a pizza snob, so I can live with cheap pizza.  This is easily $100/month in savings.\n\n* Start a garden in my backyard -- only did this for 1 year so far, and we were able to replace some of the veggies we buy with the garden.  That said, we started off small, so we probably only saved about $50 bucks of food in the end, which was about how much spent on seeds and equipment.  We are definitely going much bigger this year (2x what we had previously) with proper equipment, so hopefully we can grow much more as we develop our green thumb.  Negligible savings so far, but I'm hoping it'll be in the $100s in savings this year.\n\n* Apply for state help on health insurance costs -- while working at my agency, I had my entire family on my premium health insurance plan, which cost $1,600/month to cover everyone.  But now that my earnings are significantly reduced, my entire family gets health insurance completely for free.  With this cheaper health plan, even if my earnings go up significantly and I pay full price for the insurance, it'll only come out to $950/month.  That is $650/month in savings right there.  Perhaps this isn't the best long-term move because there can be problems with cheaper healthcare, but for now, as I am still \"young\", it will suffice.\n\nAll in, I am saving the following:\n\nItem\t|Old Monthly Cost\t|New Monthly Cost\t|Total Monthly Savings\t|Total Annual Savings\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:\nSubscription Services\t|$242.38\t|$73.31\t|$169.08\t|$2,028.93\nAmazon shopping\t|$100.00\t|$30.00\t|$70.00\t|$840.00\nBaked goods\t|$35.00\t|$5.00\t|$30.00\t|$360.00\nTake-out\t|$150.00\t|$35.00\t|$115.00\t|$1380.00\nHealth Insurance\t|$1,600.00\t|$950.00\t|$650.00\t|$7,800.00\nTotal\t|$2,127.38\t|$1,093.31\t|$1034.08\t|$12,408.93\n\nIf you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read through this.  I hope this will give someone some ideas on how they can cut out extraneous expenses from their lives.  Given how the economy is moving, many of us may need these tips sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat are some other things you have done to reduce your recurring costs?  I'd love to try to minimize my costs even further if I can.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1j58b0q/got_laid_off_so_i_went_allin_on_living_frugally/", "created_utc": 1741300784.0, "score": 12326, "author": "quokkabee", "num_comments": 638, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1j58b0q/got_laid_off_so_i_went_allin_on_living_frugally/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My wife and I have discovered that churning meal kits has been cheaper than groceries", "selftext": "Recently it has become more difficult for me and my wife to fit grocery shopping into our schedules with our jobs and two young kids. We decided to try some meal kits in order to still eat home cooked meals without having to spend a lot of time preparing lists and wandering grocery isles. Most companies have very attractive trial codes for 75-80% off your first delivery. So we tried that and really liked the experience. But after a few weeks the cost keeps rising up to full price and we determined that it just wasn't in the budget to do it every week.\n\nWe cancelled, thinking that we would come back maybe when they had another deal available or maybe try a different company. Well it didn't take long for a \"come back\" code to appear in my email inbox. Less than a week. So we bought another delivery at a similar extreme discount of 80%. As an experiment I decided to cancel immediately after being charged for the next box and guess what? Yep, another \"come back\" code arrived. This time via a mailed postcard.\n\nOver the last 6 months I have bounced between two different meal kit services and I have not paid more than $3 per meal since September. As long as you cancel your subscription after each payment they will be begging you to come back within 2 weeks. I'm sure if you were really dedicated you could churn 3 or 4 different meal kits for the maximum savings. Our best streak was after the new year where we got 4 boxes in a row for $1 per meal. There is no way we could afford to buy groceries that cheap. And the meals have been great! I didn't want anyone to think this was an advertisement for a specific service, so I won't name any here. I'm very curious to find out how long I can keep this going, but so far it has been great. We only go to a small local grocer now for milk, butter, and other basics. Accounting for inflation, our total grocery budget has actually gone down despite eating better and saving time.\n\nEDIT: Since making this post I have received another discount code for 75% off from one of our meal kit services.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/123nium/my_wife_and_i_have_discovered_that_churning_meal/", "created_utc": 1679925111.0, "score": 9105, "author": "x70x", "num_comments": 677, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/123nium/my_wife_and_i_have_discovered_that_churning_meal/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Food costs are out of control in the US.", "selftext": "My partner and I live a very frugal lifestyle in a relatively HCOL area, especially when it comes to food. I make almost everything we eat from scratch using clearance and bulk ingredients, including bread, condiments, etc. We're big fans of cold cut sandwiches for lunch, and we've been buying bone-in turkey breasts, holiday hams (after the holidays) and whole roaster chickens on sale for years, freezing them until needed and prepping our own cold cuts for lunches each week. Obviously inflation has hit everyone hard, us included, but making everything from scratch has shielded us somewhat... but it's been a long, difficult week, we were out of homemade cold cuts and I decided to buy some from the deli counter at a grocery store near us last night.\n\nI stupidly didn't check the per lb. cost, assuming it would be like, $3-4/lb like it was a few years ago\u2013 kind of expensive, but manageable. I got to the checkout and 2 lbs of normal, roast chicken deli meat from a normal grocery store cost TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. It was almost $12/lb. That's like the cost of 4+ entire homemade meals for us.\n\nBack to the old way, I guess... can't even cut a corner on something simple anymore. It's genuinely terrifying to know that buying too much DELI CHICKEN could be financially ruinous at this point. Where does it end?-\n\nEdit: Some additional thoughts.\n\nI am clearly not alone in this! This was just meant to be a \"vent\" post but clearly it's resonated. Thanks for all the helpful and supportive responses\u2013 I really hope that collectively, we can organize and DO something about the price gouging/\"inflation\" happening at the supplier and retailer level. A start is contacting your state and local governments and mentioning your concerns with rising food costs and food scarcity\u2013 look up retailers or manufacturers headquartered in your area and mention those retailers by name when contacting elected officials. And, if price gouging continues and worsens, we need to be collectively ready to organize and protest.\n\nThis post is getting way more attention than I expected, and I'm getting some kind of awful comments/messages. I don't know how to caveat this any more than I did in my original post, but I know prices are high for a lot more than just deli meat, and I know deli meat is a convenience food (i.e., higher price point in general), which is why I don't normally buy it. That being said, I don't think it's an extravagant luxury, and no one should feel shamed for buying something that makes their lives easier on occasion\u2013 you can be frugal with your time and sanity sometimes, too. I feel extremely lucky that a) I have the time and equipment needed to cook frugally from scratch and b) I'm only cooking for my partner and I in a dual-income household. Everyone commenting \"stop buying deli meat then\" \u2013 well, that's obviously my plan, but that's not really helpful commentary, it's not just deli meat, and families who rely on convenience foods shouldn't have to starve.\n\nFinal edit: The area we're located grew QUICKLY during and post-Covid when it was named \"one of the best places to live and work remote.\" Housing and food costs have risen dramatically, not to mention scarcity\u2013\u00a0my city made a number of \"largest COL increase\" lists the past couple of years (went from moderate to high, along with lots of other compounding factors) and my partner and I are indeed looking to move.

{"title": "My wife likes to get spray tans and bikini waxes before vacations. To save money, I bought the equipment and now I do both for her.", "selftext": "A few years ago, my wife came home from a Brazilian wax appointment and told me that she'd had a terrible experience. The wax was too hot, the technician (or whatever you call the waxer person) was grumpy, and a lot of hairs left behind. She said, \"Honestly, I bet you could have done it better!\" \n\nThat gave me an idea. \"You know, I bet you that I could.\"\n\nSo, I read some articles online, found the right supplies, we watched a few training videos together, and, long story short, she has never been back to another waxing salon.\n\nIt cost a couple hundred dollars for the right equipment and supplies to be able to perform each of these services, but neither was very hard to learn. It only took about 3 spray tans before I'd gotten really good at giving them. \n\nBrazilians were a bit more of a learning curve. I practiced waxing my own thighs for a couple of months before I attempted waxing her. I started with really small strips and the first few took forever, but now I can do one in about 25 minutes and she tells me that the results are better than any salon she ever went to.\n\nThe key for both services was purchasing professional quality equipment and supplies. I did a ton of research and tried a few different products before settling on what we found to work best.\n\nThe equipment paid for itself within 6 months. Now, each spray tan costs about $2.50 and a wax about $2-3.\n\nMy wife loves that I do them for her. She doesn't have to get naked for a stranger and she gets waxed consistently enough that it's far less painful qnd can keep a nice tan all summer with the perfect amount of color every time.\n\nDo I enjoy providing her these services to her? Yes, I absolutely do. My wife is beautiful and I love taking care of her. However, I would not do them for her if it had not been her idea to have me learn to do them for her.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nEdit: For those asking about supplies:\n\nI order waxing stuff from Honeycomb Wax Company and spray tan solution from MineTan. Both have starter kits available. The spray gun in the MineTan starter kit isn't great. We upgraded to a gently used Norvell m1000 a few months ago and it is much better. \n\nRule of thumb with equipment and supplies: You get what you pay for. As you are not paying for someone to do the application, spend up and get nice quality product (ie, professional products, not stuff from the drug store).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/18mjybg/my_wife_likes_to_get_spray_tans_and_bikini_waxes/", "created_utc": 1703040597.0, "score": 7833, "author": "JephriB", "num_comments": 597, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/18mjybg/my_wife_likes_to_get_spray_tans_and_bikini_waxes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "PSA: There's a real psychological cost in buying cheap crap. It can make you feel like cheap crap.

It looks like the sort of artichoke Hera might stuff for Zeus but on a stick. It's warm and pleasant and stare provoking. Well worth 70 USD.\n\nI'd also like to point out---and this isn't really an r/Frugal thought, it's just a related sidebar about the importance of good lighting to mental health, so stop reading if you hate soapboxes---Our whole experience of the world psychologically is like 70% light, 20% sound and 10% all that other shit. We're primarily light sensing creatures, in other words. The emotional timbre of your domicile's light is easily manipulated by simply getting well thought out lighting. It should be incredibly important to all of us because lighting has a profound but subtle effect on our moods. If you don't believe me, go down to your local IKEA and buy the coolest looking lamp they have. I'm sure you have five dollars. Give it a shot and make sure the bulb has a warm yellowness to it. The Scandinavians are lightyears ahead of the rest of the world in terms of good lighting and creating cozy spaces.
