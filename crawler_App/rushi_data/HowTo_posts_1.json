She uses it on her commute to pick up her kid, without fail at 2:45pm, and back the other way at 3pm every school day. It wouldn't be a big deal if she was just a few feet on the property, but she's so close to the house, and I mean within an arms reach to it and living room windows. In fact on her way to get her kid today she was staring in and we made an awkward eye contact.\n\nAfter gaining the courage, and opportunity, to address the issue with her today on her way back(I don't like confrontation), I was met with a dismissive response. I politely asked if she could just follow the curb abound the corner or use the sidewalk on the other side instead of cutting across the front yard and walking right next to my windows, she just scoffed and rolled her eyes as if I was in the wrong. After repeating myself once again, she said, \"I didn't touch any of your shit why are you tripping boy\". I told her it's not about touching anything, it's about respecting peoples property boundaries and their requests. I was met with more dismissive comments, so I mentioned that if she returns it's trespassing and I would contact the police. The conversation took a turn for the worse  and she responded with, \"go ahead I'll come beat your fucking ass.\" All in front of her kid mind you.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that I'm not trying to be a Karen or unnecessarily escalate the situation. I don't give a fuck about my lawn or anything like that, I just don't want strangers so close to my house, it makes me feel uneasy and invaded, especially now with the threats.

Details inside.", "selftext": "On July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications (which include browsers like Reddit Is Fun, Apollo, and Relay for Reddit) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable than it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on uncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact both groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit \u2013 the fixtures which make it appealing \u2013 will be eliminated.\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's statement \u2013 \"I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users\" \u2013 is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote:\n\nAllow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.\n\nAllow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.\n\n---\n\nMore information is available at /r/ModCoord.

{"title": "How to clean your facebook & download your photos from a guy who just did it (2019)", "selftext": "posting because i wish i had a quick guide like this, as other articles posted become unhelpful soon after their publication because of facebook's frequent changes to its ux and api. \n\nthis was long overdue because i've had fb since freshman year of highschool and i graduated college 4 years ago. like any sane person i don't post there that much anymore so i considered deleting it entirely but i'm in some cool facebook groups and the event function is good. still, i've always been mildly bothered thinking about how much uncool shit i had posted online deep in my profile just from being a young dumbass. \n\nso for posterity's sake i wanted to download all my albums & tagged photos of me, stick those on a hard drive, and then pretty much delete everything (old/bad photos, old status updates, posts on friends pages, comments) except a handful of photos. \n\nfacebook obviously doesn't want to make this easy for you, those sick fucks. it was a couple hour task involving multiple chrome extensions and the added mental torture of looking at cringey old photos and posts. i'll also add that it was a chore that really put me face to face with how much data/content I unhesitatingly handed over for 11 fuckin years. alright let's get going.\n\nStep 1: Use facebook settings to download the photos & videos you uploaded. settings > your facebook information > download your information > photos\n\nfb will make a zip file for you with all of that stuff. \n\nStep 2: download tagged photos of you. facebook doesn't include these in the zip file you just downloaded, and there's no way to do this in one fell swoop without a chrome extension. install [this bad boy called downalbum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downalbum/cgjnhhjpfcdhbhlcmmjppicjmgfkppok?hl=en), open it while you're on FB, and click the button in the extension that says \"fb open photos of.\" i learned that you'll want to scroll to the bottom of the page, so all the photos are loaded, before you run the extension. when its done downloading it'll open a new tab/webpage with all of the photos. save that complete webpage and all the photos you're tagged in will be saved.\n\nyou can then drop all the photos so far into a folder / drive.\n\nstep 3 (the annoying as fuck part): untagging yourself from all the photos you hate. after a little research there didn't seem to be any functional 3rd party tools that could untag photos en masse. so within facebook go to your activity log, select \"photos\", then select \"tagged photos of you\". there will be a timeline of photos you're tagged in, as well as POSTS you're tagged in, where the poster included photos in the post as well. theyre different. I just focused on removing the former. \n\nfacebook lets you select photos in batches of 10 max (which is better than no batches but still seems intentionally discouraging) and then you can apply \"untag\" to those. When i did it, the UI didnt correct itself to show remove the newly untagged posts from the page, so you just have to deselect the posts and trust that you're untagged and move onto the next 10. obviously the less photos you wish to untag the less it will suck, I had to do like 600 and it sucked quite a bit. \n\nstep 4: delete all posts you've ever written (comments, status updates, posts on friends timelines). it's at this step you really realize that nothing you've ever written on facebook has ever needed to stay on there for a more than a week. download the chrome extension [social book post manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-book-post-manager/ljfidlkcmdmmibngdfikhffffdmphjae?hl=en-US). go to your fb activity log again and select \"posts.\" then scroll scroll scroll to the bottom of the page so that all the posts are loaded. use the chrome extension and set your date range and it will delete all the posts (select 16x speed inside the extension to make it go faster). click the various years on the right of the activity log to make sure it got all of the posts. it will only remove the posts that are loaded on the page, i had to do a few passes of loading posts & running the extension to delete.\n\nedit: people seem to be having trouble with social book post manager extension. it gave me problems too when i first tried to run it but then i restarted chrome and ran it with facebook being the only tab/window in my browser and it worked for whatever reason. best of luck.\n\nstep 5: actually delete (not just untag) old albums/pictures you've uploaded. pretty self explanatory, just do it in your photos section. i deleted all my shitty old profile & cover photos and just kept a couple recent ones. i also hadn't uploaded any albums in 5 years and the old ones were whack so i just deleted all of em. \n\nand that's it. my timeline still shows stuff that other people have posted on it going all the way back but now my written history is gone and any photos attached to me are only the ones i want. hope this helps, comment or dm me if you try it and something isn't working and ill try to help. and feel free to comment if you know a better way to take care of any of the steps.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/bq1w9t/how_to_clean_your_facebook_download_your_photos/", "created_utc": 1558170919.0, "score": 975, "author": "noonlastnight", "num_comments": 51, "permalink": "/r/howto/comments/bq1w9t/how_to_clean_your_facebook_download_your_photos/", "html_title": ""}

The extent of my knowledge about doctors and hospitals was just me scheduling an appointment with anyone at a military base hospital, telling them my problems, and then getting a refferal. \n\nI guess my main questions are: How do I navigate finding/changing my PCP? Can I just go to any hospital in my area(that accepts medicaid) and ask any doctor to give me a refferal or does it have to only be my PCP?

{"title": "How to fix a stuck suitcase handle. (wont extend and or collapse)", "selftext": "It took me a minute to figure this out, and I didn\u2019t see any great resources online, so I figured I\u2019d make this post for anyone who may find themselves in a similar situation in the future. \n\nIf you\u2019re currently in a pinch and need to get your handle closed or open: \n\nTry to shake the handle gently up and down while holding down the release button. If that dosent work, then empty your bag and unzip the liner to access the small spring loaded locking pin in each tube of the handle. You can hold them down as you slide the handle out/in. \n\n\n\nTo make the repair: \n\n1. Fully extend the handle (using method above if needed), and remove the screws that secure then handle to the tubes. Then remove the handle. \n\n2. Inside the tube on each side you will see a small rod. When you push down on that rod, the small pins that lock the handle in place should retract. If the pins aren\u2019t retracting when you push on the rods, then inspect for debris and lubricate. \n\n3. In my case, the two small rods had both snapped off and were too short to engage the button properly. \n\n4. The rods can be slid right out of the tubes. With the rods removed, I took one and placed it back into the previously removed handle mechanism to see how far in it went. Make note of this measurement (This is also a good time to confirm that your release button is working properly. When you push the button on the handle, the rod should get pushed out about a 1/4 inch). \n\n5. Figure out how much of your rod is missing by placing the rod back into the tube, and measuring how much of the rod would be protruding into the handle. The difference between this measurement and your previous measurement is the size of the spacer that you will need to add. Mine was just over 1/2 inch. \n\n6. Make a spacer or replace the rod. I was in a hurry when I did this, so I cut rod spacers from some pieces 3/8 oak dowel rod that I had. I removed the rod, dropped the spacer in the tube, and reassembled everything. If you have or can go get a piece of steel wire/round bar in the correct diameter, then I\u2019d recommend that you completely replace the broken rods with two new ones of the proper length (your existing rod length plus measured spacer size). \n\n7. Put your handle back on the tubes, be sure to align the rods with the holes in the handle. With the handle fully seated, but before putting the screws that secure the handle back in place, test your button and ensure that your spacers/ new rods are the correct length. If pushing the button does not retract the pins, then your rods are still too short. If the pins are already partly or fully retracted without pushing the button, then your rods are too long. I had to put the handle on, then test the fit, remove and adjust a couple of times to get it just right. \n\n8. Once you\u2019ve confirmed that your rod length is good, you can put the screws back in the handle and call it a job done. \n\nHope this helps.

Storyboard what each scene will be based on the script(Remember to make it funny with outrages animations or funny faces)\n\n4. Use Blender for the animation. Its free! I always animate at 30fps and render multiple video clips out! I will aim to animate 3 seconds of footage at a time which is 90 frames total.\n\n5. Make a plane(The shape not the vehicle) in blender and apply a grid like texture to it(This will be used as the background)\n\n6. Use assets from Free3d the website to get a scene assembled\n\n7. Use Mixamo to get characters and access to lots of animations \n\n8. Start animating smooth camera movements\n\n9. Render out the scene as pngs into a folder(We will assemble them into video later)\n\n10. Repeat Steps 6,7,8,9 until all scenes are done\n\n11. You will need a video editor.

There are three outlets that I\u2019m assuming are slaved to the main GFCI outlet, and none of them have power. \n\nI\u2019ve checked all fuses, none are blown. None of the breakers were tripped. I swapped the 15A breaker that the refrigerator and GFCI are connected to with another 15A breaker and still got the same issue, so it\u2019s not a breaker fault. I\u2019ve looked everywhere I can think for another GFCI and I can\u2019t find anything. I also checked the 110 outlets on the exterior of the camper, no GFCI on those either. I\u2019ve tried calling my local Forest River dealer to troubleshoot and they\u2019re as useless as tits on a boar hog. Anybody got any suggestions? \n\nAlso to note, there is another outlet that\u2019s higher up near the bed that isn\u2019t GFCI, and it\u2019s working fine.

{"title": "How To Put My Sofa Together Alone?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, it's my first thread posted. (Note, guys I tried to change the post title to \"solo\" ugh \ud83d\ude05)\n\nSo I bought a great sofa online from Wayfair that needs assembly. Single ATM so no one to ask and I would love to get ideas on how I can put it together on my own without calling a handyman.\n\nI've been trying and the overall problem is the latch bolts are small, the teddy boucle sofa fabric is bulky, and the sofa pieces are awkward. I can't get the arms = the sofa sides, close enough to the seat to mesh them together. I haven't attempted to attach the (relatively heavy) sofa back yet.\n\nWhen I pick up the sides to try to join their bolts to the matching bolts on the seat, as I try to position the sides close enough to the seat for the opposing bolts to catch, the first problem is the bolts disappear into the fabric and I can't see them any more to guide them into joining. Every time I try to match the bolts of both the seat and the arm, then slide the arm down as far as I can while still seeing the bolts, and mash the pieces together to get them close enough while holding them in position and sliding the bolts together, they don't mesh and just miss each other.\n\nAs I said the fabric is bulky and the second problem is there's also a lot of padding to make it like a cloud couch. So the seat doesn't hold in position well even when I have it wedged against the wall and am attempting to latch the arm on the other side. When I try to mash the pieces together to get them close enough to latch, while sliding the arm into position to catch onto the seat, it doesn't happen and the latches don't just miss each other, the sofa pieces bounce off each other as well.\n\nHow can I do this? Please post helpful strategies, i.e., not for me to give up and call someone, but how I can complete this assembly solo.\n\nThe directions say to attach the arms first and then the back. But maybe I should try the back first to help ground the sofa and then re-try the arms?\n\nThoughts? Pics below and THANKS in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53anz538x9te1.jpg?width=1070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5445c41e2bf1c62bef6b7b5a09c23b9073f4e9e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hclvo738x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6719b9787af7589544a47f785343bbea8305219d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3ixn438x9te1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c3a1781fd51511daa6139167d218c02696f523a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6avwa638x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb0abe224148c96ce67ba7283e09f6d416cc7e0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3ddu638x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c97d9662741e426073503fc5809f558b2b4ea7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/en2uy538x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23e54cab1b6922590685c2fbe792577c11ac502a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2721638x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7bd0eeb16d27d966811e9f45ff52011bb60fcca", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/1jt2wc5/how_to_put_my_sofa_together_alone/", "created_utc": 1743969333.0, "score": 1, "author": "rmmomma4eva", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/howto/comments/1jt2wc5/how_to_put_my_sofa_together_alone/", "html_title": ""}

(should i cut it and make the tear into a square? or is it best to patch over the thinner lines of the L shape? that sorta stuff).\n\nThanks for the help!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/1kbk2o1/how_to_patch_repair_a_window_screen/", "created_utc": 1746028814.0, "score": 2, "author": "Tanukispooky", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/howto/comments/1kbk2o1/how_to_patch_repair_a_window_screen/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to fix a stuck suitcase handle. (wont extend and or collapse)", "selftext": "It took me a minute to figure this out, and I didn\u2019t see any great resources online, so I figured I\u2019d make this post for anyone who may find themselves in a similar situation in the future. \n\nIf you\u2019re currently in a pinch and need to get your handle closed or open: \n\nTry to shake the handle gently up and down while holding down the release button. If that dosent work, then empty your bag and unzip the liner to access the small spring loaded locking pin in each tube of the handle. You can hold them down as you slide the handle out/in. \n\n\n\nTo make the repair: \n\n1. Fully extend the handle (using method above if needed), and remove the screws that secure then handle to the tubes. Then remove the handle. \n\n2. Inside the tube on each side you will see a small rod. When you push down on that rod, the small pins that lock the handle in place should retract. If the pins aren\u2019t retracting when you push on the rods, then inspect for debris and lubricate. \n\n3. In my case, the two small rods had both snapped off and were too short to engage the button properly. \n\n4. The rods can be slid right out of the tubes. With the rods removed, I took one and placed it back into the previously removed handle mechanism to see how far in it went. Make note of this measurement (This is also a good time to confirm that your release button is working properly. When you push the button on the handle, the rod should get pushed out about a 1/4 inch). \n\n5. Figure out how much of your rod is missing by placing the rod back into the tube, and measuring how much of the rod would be protruding into the handle. The difference between this measurement and your previous measurement is the size of the spacer that you will need to add. Mine was just over 1/2 inch. \n\n6. Make a spacer or replace the rod. I was in a hurry when I did this, so I cut rod spacers from some pieces 3/8 oak dowel rod that I had. I removed the rod, dropped the spacer in the tube, and reassembled everything. If you have or can go get a piece of steel wire/round bar in the correct diameter, then I\u2019d recommend that you completely replace the broken rods with two new ones of the proper length (your existing rod length plus measured spacer size). \n\n7. Put your handle back on the tubes, be sure to align the rods with the holes in the handle. With the handle fully seated, but before putting the screws that secure the handle back in place, test your button and ensure that your spacers/ new rods are the correct length. If pushing the button does not retract the pins, then your rods are still too short. If the pins are already partly or fully retracted without pushing the button, then your rods are too long. I had to put the handle on, then test the fit, remove and adjust a couple of times to get it just right. \n\n8. Once you\u2019ve confirmed that your rod length is good, you can put the screws back in the handle and call it a job done. \n\nHope this helps.

Storyboard what each scene will be based on the script(Remember to make it funny with outrages animations or funny faces)\n\n4. Use Blender for the animation. Its free! I always animate at 30fps and render multiple video clips out! I will aim to animate 3 seconds of footage at a time which is 90 frames total.\n\n5. Make a plane(The shape not the vehicle) in blender and apply a grid like texture to it(This will be used as the background)\n\n6. Use assets from Free3d the website to get a scene assembled\n\n7. Use Mixamo to get characters and access to lots of animations \n\n8. Start animating smooth camera movements\n\n9. Render out the scene as pngs into a folder(We will assemble them into video later)\n\n10. Repeat Steps 6,7,8,9 until all scenes are done\n\n11. You will need a video editor.

{"title": "How To Put My Sofa Together Alone?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, it's my first thread posted. (Note, guys I tried to change the post title to \"solo\" ugh \ud83d\ude05)\n\nSo I bought a great sofa online from Wayfair that needs assembly. Single ATM so no one to ask and I would love to get ideas on how I can put it together on my own without calling a handyman.\n\nI've been trying and the overall problem is the latch bolts are small, the teddy boucle sofa fabric is bulky, and the sofa pieces are awkward. I can't get the arms = the sofa sides, close enough to the seat to mesh them together. I haven't attempted to attach the (relatively heavy) sofa back yet.\n\nWhen I pick up the sides to try to join their bolts to the matching bolts on the seat, as I try to position the sides close enough to the seat for the opposing bolts to catch, the first problem is the bolts disappear into the fabric and I can't see them any more to guide them into joining. Every time I try to match the bolts of both the seat and the arm, then slide the arm down as far as I can while still seeing the bolts, and mash the pieces together to get them close enough while holding them in position and sliding the bolts together, they don't mesh and just miss each other.\n\nAs I said the fabric is bulky and the second problem is there's also a lot of padding to make it like a cloud couch. So the seat doesn't hold in position well even when I have it wedged against the wall and am attempting to latch the arm on the other side. When I try to mash the pieces together to get them close enough to latch, while sliding the arm into position to catch onto the seat, it doesn't happen and the latches don't just miss each other, the sofa pieces bounce off each other as well.\n\nHow can I do this? Please post helpful strategies, i.e., not for me to give up and call someone, but how I can complete this assembly solo.\n\nThe directions say to attach the arms first and then the back. But maybe I should try the back first to help ground the sofa and then re-try the arms?\n\nThoughts? Pics below and THANKS in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/53anz538x9te1.jpg?width=1070&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5445c41e2bf1c62bef6b7b5a09c23b9073f4e9e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hclvo738x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6719b9787af7589544a47f785343bbea8305219d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3ixn438x9te1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c3a1781fd51511daa6139167d218c02696f523a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6avwa638x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb0abe224148c96ce67ba7283e09f6d416cc7e0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3ddu638x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c97d9662741e426073503fc5809f558b2b4ea7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/en2uy538x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23e54cab1b6922590685c2fbe792577c11ac502a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2721638x9te1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7bd0eeb16d27d966811e9f45ff52011bb60fcca", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/1jt2wc5/how_to_put_my_sofa_together_alone/", "created_utc": 1743969333.0, "score": 1, "author": "rmmomma4eva", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/howto/comments/1jt2wc5/how_to_put_my_sofa_together_alone/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Restore or patina brass on a glass curio case", "selftext": "I bought this cool curio case with brass edging but the outside is tarnished so I decided to try to scrub it off with a mix of flour, salt, & white vinegar but it started to turn pink/copper colored (which google says is dezincification, from what I assume is due to the vinegar). Everything I've read about getting it back to brass is to sand it or use steel wool, but that seems difficult to do without scratching up the glass. \n\nSo I thought it'd look good black or even silver, if that's even possible? I also had the idea to use an oil based paint pen to paint over all the brass but I wouldn't be able to reach all the inside edges. \n\nI read that bleach or ammonia tarnishes brass to a black/brown but I'm worried it might ruin it? Then I started reading about patinas and found JAX darkener but I'm not sure if that would give me the results I'm looking for or even work in this case. \n\nAt this point I'm leaning towards making all the brass black/brown, as long as it all matches, inside and out. \nBut it might be a better option to just focus on restoring the outside to match the inside. \n\nEither way, how do I go about this?\n\nI'm in the USA, if that matters at all. \n\nTldr; I want all the brass to match.
