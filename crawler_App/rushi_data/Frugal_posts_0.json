{"title": "[Reminder] Amazon Day is a marketing event, not a deal day.", "selftext": "For those who are unaware, Amazon has been doing Prime Day, a day where they claim to have the most amount of deals for 2 years now. However, research, consumer sentiment, analysts are able to show that Prime Day is more about getting users to sign up for Prime and marketing the brand, than it is about providing deals to existing customers.\n\nI strongly recommend you use a historical price checker like CCC or Keepa to actually verify the prices are lower, as it is a common tactic to raise prices before a sale and then trick customers into feeling like they got a deal with a large % drop, like 50% off. Also keep in mind many sites will be pushing the event despite lackluster deals, because they want people to come to their site to see the aggregated 'deals' (getting ad revenue), and some of them will be linking to Amazon for that sweet affiliate money on anything you buy.\n\nHere are the stats:\n\n    Comparing black friday prices to Amazon day:\n    BF Prices for Laptops were 5% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Small Appliances were 3% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Tablets were 7% cheaper\n    BF Prices for TVs were 15% cheaper\n    BF Prices for Video Games were 12%\n    On average prices were 9% lower on BF than prime day.\n    Of 450 best-sellers, only 43 were discounted 10% or more on primeday\n    Adobe's social media tracker found 50% of shoppers were disappointed, 23% felt joy\n    Last year, our staff scanned nearly 8,000 deals and found only 64 worth posting.\n\n\nI would post the numerous links but last time my post was immediately removed (im assuming due to links), I can provide them (hopefully) in the comments if requested.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/6mifa9/reminder_amazon_day_is_a_marketing_event_not_a/", "created_utc": 1499730249.0, "score": 14899, "author": "Put_It_All_On_Blck", "num_comments": 1029, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/6mifa9/reminder_amazon_day_is_a_marketing_event_not_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Got laid off, so I went all-in on living frugally. Here's what I did.", "selftext": "Strap in, it's gonna be a long one.\n\nIn January of 2024, my second daughter was born.  Unfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my paternity leave of just 4 weeks, my company laid me off with an okay severance package (2 months of pay).  I decided during this time that after 10 years of 55+ hour weeks, I wanted a better work-life balance -- especially now that I have a second child.\n\nUnfortunately, I had not anticipated how insane the job market was, so after hundreds of job applications, 20+ interviews, 10+ interview project assignments, and getting to the final round 5 times, I still couldn't find a job going brand-side.  I had to make a pivotal decision -- go back to agency world where I'll likely burn out sooner or later, or attempt to forge my own path with my own clients.  I decided spending time with my family was more important than a bigger paycheck, so I decided to start off on my own consulting/freelancing.\n\nOf course, this meant that cash flow would limited for a while until I was able to build out my client base, so I set off reducing my recurring expenses as much as possible.\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nNetflix|Monthly|$17.99|$17.99|$215.88\nCrunchyroll|Annual|$79.99|$6.67|$79.99\nAmazon Prime|Annual|$139.00|$11.58|$139.00\nOn Demand Korea|Annual|$139.99|$11.67|$139.99\nYoutube Premium|Monthly|$22.99|$22.99|$275.88\nSpotify|Monthly|$19.99|$19.99\t|$239.88\nT-Mobile|Monthly\t|$100.00\t|$100.00\t|$1,200.00\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nLastPass\t|Monthly\t|$4.00\t|$4.00\t|$48.00\nChase Sapphire Reserve\t|Annual\t|$550.00\t|$45.83\t|$550.00\n\nThe above came out to $242.38/month or $2,908.61 annually.  I then cut out as much as I could then replaced the more expensive services with cheaper ones.\n\n\nPlatform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:\nStremio + RD\t|Annual\t|$34.54\t|$2.88\t|$34.54\nOn Demand Korea\t|Annual\t|$139.99\t|$11.67\t|$139.99\nYoutube Premium\t|Monthly\t|$22.99\t|$22.99\t|$275.88\t\t\t\nMint Mobile\t|Annual\t|409.28\t|$34.11\t|$409.28\nGoogle One\t|Annual\t|$19.99\t|$1.67\t|$19.99\nBitwarden\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\nAAA Daily Advantage\t|Free\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\t|$0.00\n\nThe new recurring costs came out to $73.31/month or $879.68 annually.\n\n* Netflix, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime were replaced with Stremio + Real-Debrid (note: this may be a controversial move for some, but I'll be honest -- with the ever increasing subscription prices, I don't feel too bad about going the Stremio + RD route until I get back on my feet).  \n* On Demand Korea was kept because my tech illiterate mother (who lives separately) has no idea how to operate anything other than a remote control to select a show and press play.\n\n* YouTube Premium was kept if only to make sure my older child does not get exposed to random ads on her approved-only content kids profile.  But additionally, utilizing YouTube Music allowed me to get rid of Spotify.  Not gonna lie, I love Spotify's algorithm for discovering new music much better, but YouTube Music works.  Not to mention that since I work with ads as my career, I'd rather not see more ads in my personal life, and about half the content I consume is on YouTube.\n\n* For Amazon Prime delivery, not having the instant 1-day shipping (because we would need to build up a minimum amount to get free delivery now) actually helped reduce monthly Amazon purchases.  I used to spend, on average, about $100/month on random crap.  Now it's closer to $30/month, and that's mostly essential supplies for the kiddos.\n\n* T-Mobile was a big one.  Since my wife and I both work from home, we hardly used any data.  With Mint Mobile, not only do I get more data to use monthly, it's also significantly cheaper with no noticeable reduction in service quality (YMMV).\n\n* I used to pay for LastPass Family, but after using Bitwarden for a while, I wonder why I didn't swap sooner.  It has basically the same functions as the LastPass Family plan to share passwords with family, but Bitwarden is not only free, but they have a much better track record of not getting hacked.\n\n* Finally, I used to have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card as I used to travel a bit more often.  Now that that will be out of the picture for at least a year or so, I've gotten a free card that pays a higher cash back bonus on my highest spending category -- Costco (3% back on Costco with 5% back on groceries, which includes Walmart).  Also, as I now eat out or DoorDash much less frequently, I was not building up points efficiently on the CSR, so it didn't make sense to keep it.\n\nOther things I did to reduce costs:\n\n* Learn how to bake -- I used to buy cookies and baked goods from Costco pretty much every trip I made (every 2 weeks or so), but now I buy 0.  Instead, I am now baking all the sweet treats that my family wants.  Not only can I now get exactly what I want in the quantity that I want it, it is far, far cheaper (and tastier now that I have a bit more experience baking).  This is easily $30/month in savings.\n\n* Learn how to cook my favorite take-out meals -- burritos, burgers, beef & bean chili, chicken noodle soup, etc.  The only time I ever order take-out now is for the party packs at McDonald's if I'm too tired to cook (once a month max), and maybe a Costco pizza.  Thankfully, I'm not a pizza snob, so I can live with cheap pizza.  This is easily $100/month in savings.\n\n* Start a garden in my backyard -- only did this for 1 year so far, and we were able to replace some of the veggies we buy with the garden.  That said, we started off small, so we probably only saved about $50 bucks of food in the end, which was about how much spent on seeds and equipment.  We are definitely going much bigger this year (2x what we had previously) with proper equipment, so hopefully we can grow much more as we develop our green thumb.  Negligible savings so far, but I'm hoping it'll be in the $100s in savings this year.\n\n* Apply for state help on health insurance costs -- while working at my agency, I had my entire family on my premium health insurance plan, which cost $1,600/month to cover everyone.  But now that my earnings are significantly reduced, my entire family gets health insurance completely for free.  With this cheaper health plan, even if my earnings go up significantly and I pay full price for the insurance, it'll only come out to $950/month.  That is $650/month in savings right there.  Perhaps this isn't the best long-term move because there can be problems with cheaper healthcare, but for now, as I am still \"young\", it will suffice.\n\nAll in, I am saving the following:\n\nItem\t|Old Monthly Cost\t|New Monthly Cost\t|Total Monthly Savings\t|Total Annual Savings\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:\nSubscription Services\t|$242.38\t|$73.31\t|$169.08\t|$2,028.93\nAmazon shopping\t|$100.00\t|$30.00\t|$70.00\t|$840.00\nBaked goods\t|$35.00\t|$5.00\t|$30.00\t|$360.00\nTake-out\t|$150.00\t|$35.00\t|$115.00\t|$1380.00\nHealth Insurance\t|$1,600.00\t|$950.00\t|$650.00\t|$7,800.00\nTotal\t|$2,127.38\t|$1,093.31\t|$1034.08\t|$12,408.93\n\nIf you've made it this far, I appreciate you taking the time to read through this.  I hope this will give someone some ideas on how they can cut out extraneous expenses from their lives.  Given how the economy is moving, many of us may need these tips sooner rather than later.\n\nWhat are some other things you have done to reduce your recurring costs?  I'd love to try to minimize my costs even further if I can.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1j58b0q/got_laid_off_so_i_went_allin_on_living_frugally/", "created_utc": 1741300784.0, "score": 12329, "author": "quokkabee", "num_comments": 638, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/1j58b0q/got_laid_off_so_i_went_allin_on_living_frugally/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "My wife and I have discovered that churning meal kits has been cheaper than groceries", "selftext": "Recently it has become more difficult for me and my wife to fit grocery shopping into our schedules with our jobs and two young kids. We decided to try some meal kits in order to still eat home cooked meals without having to spend a lot of time preparing lists and wandering grocery isles. Most companies have very attractive trial codes for 75-80% off your first delivery. So we tried that and really liked the experience. But after a few weeks the cost keeps rising up to full price and we determined that it just wasn't in the budget to do it every week.\n\nWe cancelled, thinking that we would come back maybe when they had another deal available or maybe try a different company. Well it didn't take long for a \"come back\" code to appear in my email inbox. Less than a week. So we bought another delivery at a similar extreme discount of 80%. As an experiment I decided to cancel immediately after being charged for the next box and guess what? Yep, another \"come back\" code arrived. This time via a mailed postcard.\n\nOver the last 6 months I have bounced between two different meal kit services and I have not paid more than $3 per meal since September. As long as you cancel your subscription after each payment they will be begging you to come back within 2 weeks. I'm sure if you were really dedicated you could churn 3 or 4 different meal kits for the maximum savings. Our best streak was after the new year where we got 4 boxes in a row for $1 per meal. There is no way we could afford to buy groceries that cheap. And the meals have been great! I didn't want anyone to think this was an advertisement for a specific service, so I won't name any here. I'm very curious to find out how long I can keep this going, but so far it has been great. We only go to a small local grocer now for milk, butter, and other basics. Accounting for inflation, our total grocery budget has actually gone down despite eating better and saving time.\n\nEDIT: Since making this post I have received another discount code for 75% off from one of our meal kit services.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/123nium/my_wife_and_i_have_discovered_that_churning_meal/", "created_utc": 1679925111.0, "score": 9107, "author": "x70x", "num_comments": 677, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/123nium/my_wife_and_i_have_discovered_that_churning_meal/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Food costs are out of control in the US.", "selftext": "My partner and I live a very frugal lifestyle in a relatively HCOL area, especially when it comes to food. I make almost everything we eat from scratch using clearance and bulk ingredients, including bread, condiments, etc. We're big fans of cold cut sandwiches for lunch, and we've been buying bone-in turkey breasts, holiday hams (after the holidays) and whole roaster chickens on sale for years, freezing them until needed and prepping our own cold cuts for lunches each week. Obviously inflation has hit everyone hard, us included, but making everything from scratch has shielded us somewhat... but it's been a long, difficult week, we were out of homemade cold cuts and I decided to buy some from the deli counter at a grocery store near us last night.\n\nI stupidly didn't check the per lb. cost, assuming it would be like, $3-4/lb like it was a few years ago\u2013 kind of expensive, but manageable. I got to the checkout and 2 lbs of normal, roast chicken deli meat from a normal grocery store cost TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. It was almost $12/lb. That's like the cost of 4+ entire homemade meals for us.\n\nBack to the old way, I guess... can't even cut a corner on something simple anymore. It's genuinely terrifying to know that buying too much DELI CHICKEN could be financially ruinous at this point. Where does it end?-\n\nEdit: Some additional thoughts.\n\nI am clearly not alone in this! This was just meant to be a \"vent\" post but clearly it's resonated. Thanks for all the helpful and supportive responses\u2013 I really hope that collectively, we can organize and DO something about the price gouging/\"inflation\" happening at the supplier and retailer level. A start is contacting your state and local governments and mentioning your concerns with rising food costs and food scarcity\u2013 look up retailers or manufacturers headquartered in your area and mention those retailers by name when contacting elected officials. And, if price gouging continues and worsens, we need to be collectively ready to organize and protest.\n\nThis post is getting way more attention than I expected, and I'm getting some kind of awful comments/messages. I don't know how to caveat this any more than I did in my original post, but I know prices are high for a lot more than just deli meat, and I know deli meat is a convenience food (i.e., higher price point in general), which is why I don't normally buy it. That being said, I don't think it's an extravagant luxury, and no one should feel shamed for buying something that makes their lives easier on occasion\u2013 you can be frugal with your time and sanity sometimes, too. I feel extremely lucky that a) I have the time and equipment needed to cook frugally from scratch and b) I'm only cooking for my partner and I in a dual-income household. Everyone commenting \"stop buying deli meat then\" \u2013 well, that's obviously my plan, but that's not really helpful commentary, it's not just deli meat, and families who rely on convenience foods shouldn't have to starve.\n\nFinal edit: The area we're located grew QUICKLY during and post-Covid when it was named \"one of the best places to live and work remote.\" Housing and food costs have risen dramatically, not to mention scarcity\u2013\u00a0my city made a number of \"largest COL increase\" lists the past couple of years (went from moderate to high, along with lots of other compounding factors) and my partner and I are indeed looking to move.

{"title": "My wife likes to get spray tans and bikini waxes before vacations. To save money, I bought the equipment and now I do both for her.", "selftext": "A few years ago, my wife came home from a Brazilian wax appointment and told me that she'd had a terrible experience. The wax was too hot, the technician (or whatever you call the waxer person) was grumpy, and a lot of hairs left behind. She said, \"Honestly, I bet you could have done it better!\" \n\nThat gave me an idea. \"You know, I bet you that I could.\"\n\nSo, I read some articles online, found the right supplies, we watched a few training videos together, and, long story short, she has never been back to another waxing salon.\n\nIt cost a couple hundred dollars for the right equipment and supplies to be able to perform each of these services, but neither was very hard to learn. It only took about 3 spray tans before I'd gotten really good at giving them. \n\nBrazilians were a bit more of a learning curve. I practiced waxing my own thighs for a couple of months before I attempted waxing her. I started with really small strips and the first few took forever, but now I can do one in about 25 minutes and she tells me that the results are better than any salon she ever went to.\n\nThe key for both services was purchasing professional quality equipment and supplies. I did a ton of research and tried a few different products before settling on what we found to work best.\n\nThe equipment paid for itself within 6 months. Now, each spray tan costs about $2.50 and a wax about $2-3.\n\nMy wife loves that I do them for her. She doesn't have to get naked for a stranger and she gets waxed consistently enough that it's far less painful qnd can keep a nice tan all summer with the perfect amount of color every time.\n\nDo I enjoy providing her these services to her? Yes, I absolutely do. My wife is beautiful and I love taking care of her. However, I would not do them for her if it had not been her idea to have me learn to do them for her.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\nEdit: For those asking about supplies:\n\nI order waxing stuff from Honeycomb Wax Company and spray tan solution from MineTan. Both have starter kits available. The spray gun in the MineTan starter kit isn't great. We upgraded to a gently used Norvell m1000 a few months ago and it is much better. \n\nRule of thumb with equipment and supplies: You get what you pay for. As you are not paying for someone to do the application, spend up and get nice quality product (ie, professional products, not stuff from the drug store).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/18mjybg/my_wife_likes_to_get_spray_tans_and_bikini_waxes/", "created_utc": 1703040597.0, "score": 7833, "author": "JephriB", "num_comments": 597, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/18mjybg/my_wife_likes_to_get_spray_tans_and_bikini_waxes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "As a former Sears appliance technician, I take phenomenal care of my appliances and I\u2019ll never have to buy brand new. Here\u2019s why...", "selftext": "I worked for Sears appliance repair and have troubleshot most appliances around the house. I cannot count how many times I have heard customers complain about buying a pair of brand new washing machine/dryer sets and wishing they had their old set back. Not only this, but I\u2019ve picked up the tricks to making appliances last. After having worked on the newer ones vs older, used appliances, this is what I\u2019ve learned:\n\n1. DON\u2019T USE TOO MUCH SOAP!! People make this mistake all the time. Especially with washing your clothes, brands will sell you a detergent with the cap that has measurements on it. Never use these measurements. Even the lowest measurement is too much. If you are washing a normal sized load of laundry, all you need is 1 tablespoon of detergent. Yes, you read that correctly. Towels/blankets can use maybe 2 tablespoons. The reason for this is because most marketed detergents will have a little sticker on it that says \u201cHE\u201d. This means it is high efficiency, or in other words really really really really concentrated soap. 1 tablespoon of HE detergent is equal to about 1/4-1/2 cup of soap. If you were to add 1/2 cup of HE soap, it creates an over abundant amount of suds for your washer. Too many suds can cause balance displacement and mess up your suspension. If you have a washer that senses the moisture content of the clothes, the extra suds can cause your washer to work overtime to get rid of them. This causes the motor/shaft to wear out faster. The extra oil in the suds can also trickle down easier into the shaft and cause rust. Lastly, too much detergent will cause more mildew build up between the tub and basket of the washer.  \n\n2. That being said, never ever ever buy Tide Pods. They are expensive and will wreck your washer/dishwasher. Too much detergent.\n\n3. Never use dryer sheets. They will coat your lint trap with wax and ultimately cause house fires. \nAlso, get your dryer cleaned often! Lint doesn\u2019t always stick to the lint trap. It can escape and get into the heating element, causing it to light up into flames. Open up the dryer and vacuum out the lint, or use a wet rag to wipe it up.\n\n4. The salesman is quick to sell you on all the new gadgets, functions, and color of the appliance. DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM/HER! Say you are on the market for a washer/dryer. The big boy sets will have any function you want. It\u2019ll have crazy settings specifically for bedding, towels, whites, delicates, self cleaning. Looks awesome... but in fact this is pointless. If you go this route, you\u2019ll end up buying a brand new washer with 20 settings that you NEVER touch. Most people only use the Normal and Heavy setting on their washer, and trust me these 2 settings will wash your clothes just fine. Same with a dryer: most people only use sensing dry or timed dry. There is almost no practical use for any of the other settings when they do the exact same function as your most normal setting. \n\n5. The newer appliances combine plastic and metal moving parts, which cause the need for more repairs. The older appliances are made mostly of metal and last forever if you take care of them. I find that older people hang on to their appliances for longer and it always seems to have gone in their favor. I have worked on their 20+ year old washers and dryers they\u2019ve had since the 90s, and in my experience they wash/dry better than any new appliance on the market. Plus, over the duration of their life, they have had little to no repair needed on them. If you can get your hands on an old washer/dryer, I highly recommend it!\n\n6. Older appliances still have replacement parts on the market, and they are cheap. You can buy mostly anything you need to repair the machine with the exception of cosmetics (the outer shell, sometimes handles, main display and buttons).\n\n7. Take care of your appliance. Once a month you should be running a cleaner in your washer/dishwasher. Buy any cleaner at the store and you\u2019ll increase the longevity of the appliance just by doing this. \n\n8. Do not buy Samsung or LG appliances. They are terrible and made of mostly computers. If something breaks, that computer part will cost you an arm and a leg. Make sure to get a warranty if you really want this brand. \n\nThe only exception to not buying brand new would be a refrigerator. I would buy one brand new because every few years, they can change up the refrigerant used. The newer refrigerants are more environmentally friendly. Plus, if they can stay colder for longer, you can save electricity from it having to run the compressor as long. \n\nOverall, following these steps will save so much money in the long run it\u2019s not even funny. Using less soap will ensure your clothes still get clean, but literally double the life you get out of a bottle of detergent.\n\nEDIT: I should mention;  if you have high efficiency washers, then using HE detergent at its proper measurements is generally okay. HE washers use less water and the concentration of the detergent is meant for this purpose. Although, I would still use a tad bit less than recommended. \n\nFIRE WARNING\u2014 the dryer sheets themselves do not cause fires. The wax from your dryer sheets sticks to the lint trap. When the wax has built up over time and the trap no longer catches the lint, that lint has to go somewhere. It will escape through any crease it finds. The lint shoots into the open cabin of the dryer, touching the heating element. Lint is EXTREMELY flammable. The heating element will light it on fire and any other lint in the dryer. This is how house fires are cause by dryers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/j05ioi/as_a_former_sears_appliance_technician_i_take/", "created_utc": 1601124804.0, "score": 7271, "author": "Mr-Ravi0li", "num_comments": 780, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/j05ioi/as_a_former_sears_appliance_technician_i_take/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "PSA: Bedbugs are insanely expensive to deal with and frankly traumatizing to live with. Here are some tips.", "selftext": "A few years ago my wife and I lived in an apartment that got bedbugs. A lot of this might seem excessive or crazy but trust me you don't want to chance this stuff.\n\n1. Whenever you come home from someone's apartment or a hotel stay, immediately put all fabrics (clothes, luggage, sleeping bags) into the **dryer**. Even if you can't see any bugs, the eggs are too small to see and can live in fabrics for up to a year. \n\n2. If you have an expensive mattress, get a bedbug liner. My wife and I had to throw out a 6 month old $1,200 mattress because we didn't spend $25 on a cover. It's really not worth trying to salvage the mattress once its infested, even if you kill all the live bugs you still need to worry about eggs.\n\n3. Don't waste your money on \"natural\" products to kill bed bugs. We tried several and they were straight up ineffective. Rather than buying products that are safe for pets, just buy products that actually work and keep your pets away from the affected areas until you've cleaned up. \n\n4. If you're going to buy furniture off craigslist (which I will no longer do) try to avoid apartments. No this isn't a stereotype against low income people, the problem is that it's basically impossible to clear a building of bedbugs unless the whole building is treated. Most apartment complexes will try to treat on a unit-by-unit basis which just doesn't work. In addition the risk of re-infestation is high because a lot of infestations start by people bringing bugs home from school or work. More people = higher probability of bedbugs.\n\n5. Do not let your landlord try to bully you into keeping a security deposit if you are leaving a place that is infested with bedbugs. We had this happen since we didn't try and salvage their wall to wall carpet. They tried to charge us $500 plus our deposit to fix the carpet. Eventually it ended up in collections but after providing state mandated guidelines on dealing with bedbug infested apartments, they backed off, gave the deposit back, and it never ended up on our credit report.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/drodiu/psa_bedbugs_are_insanely_expensive_to_deal_with/", "created_utc": 1572902331.0, "score": 6786, "author": "lUNITl", "num_comments": 637, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/drodiu/psa_bedbugs_are_insanely_expensive_to_deal_with/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

When she returned, I had all the lines canceled except my own. Or so I thought. Turns out that t-mobile canceled only 3 of the extra lines and kept an additional on my account. I was paying $147 per month for months due to that extra line, when I should have been paying $50. They basically pocketed hundreds of dollars in extra fees without my permission and despite multiple documented phone calls to them to cancel and switch me to a single line. \n\nWOW! Now I'm thinking of reaching out to the FCC.\n\nBut this stuff is endless. I'm now finding that im spending a lot of extra time worrying and correcting shady behaviors like this. Another company I discovered today automatically renewed my membership to a video editing software that was advertised as a one-time purchase. \n\nI suggest everyone look carefully at your bank statements and create a system to identify and reach out to any company that might have your payment information.\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/14kis3z/is_anyone_noticing_an_uptick_in_shady_behavior_by/", "created_utc": 1687884395.0, "score": 6730, "author": "LiesToldbySociety", "num_comments": 1167, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/14kis3z/is_anyone_noticing_an_uptick_in_shady_behavior_by/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Ordering takeout or delivery directly from the restaurant is 15% cheaper on average than ordering from 3rd party delivery apps", "selftext": "You are probably wasting money on 3rd party delivery apps for the same food and service you can get from the restaurant directly.\n\nThe 3rd party delivery apps such as DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub charge several kinds of fees on top of the original food price. Specifically, they charge the following for a delivery order:\n\n1. The price of the menu items - for many restaurants, this price is not the original price on their own menus. There can be inflated menu price, as much as 20% higher.\n2. The service fee - 15% of the food price (including the inflated price). Uber Eats caps the service fee at $5 max (and $2.50 min), DoorDash and Grubhub have no cap.\n3. The delivery fee - depending on the distance, different platforms charge different delivery fees. DoorDash charges $2.99 - $6.99, Uber Eats $0.49 - $3.99, Grubhub $1.99 - $5.99.\n4. Other fees - for example, the \"CA driver benefits\" is a fee charged by some of the 3rd party delivery companies in California because the driver's payment is higher in CA. Uber Eats charges $2.00, Grubhub charges $2.00 - $4.00 depending on the distance, DoorDash doesn't charge this fee.\n\nConsidering all these together, guess how much you would pay for a $50 family meal? Let's assume the inflated menu price is +10%, and you are at the max distance of the delivery radius.  \n\\- DoorDash: $50\\*110%\\*115%+$6.99 = $70.24  \n\\- UberEats: $50\\*110%+$5+$3.99+$2 = $65.99  \n\\- Grubhub: $50\\*110%\\*115%+$5.99+$4.00 = $73.24\n\nThat's too much, isn't it? And guess how much you would pay for the same meal if ordering directly from the restaurant? It depends on which online ordering company the restaurant partners with. But most of the time, the restaurant doesn't charge any service fees, and never has inflated menu prices. So you would always pay the original price with some delivery fees. The delivery fee sometimes can be a little bit higher than the 3rd parties, but the overall price is much lower. Take the same $50 meal example, most likely you would only pay$50+$7 = $57where the $7 is the delivery fee if the restaurant uses ChowNow.\n\nNow you know that the price difference can be HUGE between the restaurant's own channel and 3rd party delivery apps. In addition, the restaurant pays 25%-30% commission per order if you place the order through 3rd party delivery apps. The restaurant loses money definitely if all orders go through the 3rd party apps.\n\nSo, if you ever want to order takeout or delivery, please consider placing the orders through the restaurant's own channel. You can go to the restaurant's website, for they usually put a link there to let you place the order online. I know it is a bit inconvenient, but it saves a lot of money for yourself and the restaurants you like. Also, there are some websites that are trying to make it easy for people to order directly from the restaurants, such as Hyperflyer. On that website, you can compare the prices of multiple delivery services side-by-side and see how much you can save if ordering through the cheapest one (most of the time, the restaurant's own channel). It has the links directing you to the ordering websites of the restaurants, so you don't have to search each restaurant's website by yourself.\n\nOf course, it's all up to you to decide how to order food online, but I think you should at least know the numbers and consider before you make the decision.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/lwf6ko/ordering_takeout_or_delivery_directly_from_the/", "created_utc": 1614726620.0, "score": 5916, "author": "fyaoyh1028", "num_comments": 403, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/lwf6ko/ordering_takeout_or_delivery_directly_from_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "I garden and cook a lot. One of the coolest things I've learned combining these interests is how much edible stuff you can grow from grocery store leftovers. This is a list of 12 useful herbs and veggies I have personally grown from grocery store scraps/seeds, so I know they work.", "selftext": "But don't let this list limit you. The ultimate moral here is most food scrap seeds and fresh cuttings can be planted or cloned. In hindsight, I feel like that should be an obvious statement, but it's really not in the modern day. It kind of blew my mind how much of the stuff you buy at the grocery store can be planted for fun and profit when I first started to get into gardening. \n\nAnd just FYI, cloning plants is far more difficult with some plant species than internet articles describing how to clone them make out. Most internet articles act like you can clone anything if you just put a cutting in a cup of water. In practice, only some types of plants actually clone that way reliably. You kind of have to develop a technique for each. Biggest universal principle I've learned is that the area you want to take root should be kept in the dark as much as possible. That usually means putting some kind of collar (e.g. peat moss or rockwool) around the stem and putting it in an opaque and covered container with water so only the top half of the plant with the leaves gets light.\n\n**Grocery store stuff I've grown plants from:**\n\n1.\tPinto beans \u2013 Grown from a bag of dried Goya pinto beans. Just plant the beans like you would from a seed packet. They sprouted in a few days. I assume it would work with other varieties of bean, but pinto are the only ones I\u2019ve tried.\n\n2.\tBasil \u2013 Can be cloned from fresh herb cuttings bought in the produce aisle. Clones quite easily in just a glass of water. I\u2019ve had roots pop in a literally just two days with rooting hormone added (a virtually unlimited supply can be bought for about $5 on the internet), though it tends to vary a lot based on the quality of the cutting.\n\n3.\tPeppers \u2013 Seeds inside fresh peppers generally sprout as easily as garden store seeds. You might have less luck with green bell peppers and jalapenos since they\u2019re picked when not ripe though. I\u2019ve successfully grown habaneros, cherry peppers, sweet peppers, and long finger peppers from grocery store seeds.\n\n4.\tMint \u2013 Can be cloned from cuttings. Try to use the less woody stems, as they\u2019ll be more likely to root. I found mint moderately difficult to clone. I took 5 cuttings. 2 rooted, but only 1 survived. Once you have a healthy plant, it\u2019s easy to transfer it to another container by burying the runners in the new container.\n\n5.\tRosemary \u2013 Can be cloned from cuttings. Rosemary is pretty difficult to clone. I took 10 cuttings and only 1 survived. It took about 1-2 months to root too. I\u2019d probably buy an aeroponic cloner if I was going to try clone more of this. You get better results when the part of the stem you\u2019re trying to root is kept in the dark. I did this to an extent with rockwool collars, but it\u2019s still a race for the plant to root before the leaves and stem start to rot.\n\n6.\tBlueberries \u2013 I\u2019ve grown blueberry plants from frozen aisle blueberries. If you have fresh blueberries you\u2019ll want to stratify the seeds by keeping them in the freezer for 60 days to simulate winter. You can skip this with frozen blueberries though. Keep in mind growing blueberries from seed takes a while. The plants are pretty easy to take care of once sprouted. Only real caveats are use acidic soil and keep it moist at all times. They\u2019ll have to grow for about 2 years before they start producing berries, and they won\u2019t get up to full rate production for 3-5 years.\n\n7.\tGarlic \u2013 You can plant whole cloves. Put them about an inch deep in the soil, skin on, pointy side up and water when soil is dry. They\u2019ll sprout in a week or two under ideal conditions. You can harvest them after they\u2019ve grown for about a month for \u201cgreen garlic\u201d which looks and is used like green onions, but has a more garlicky taste (though milder than regular garlic). You can also just let them grow into bulbs. If you do that you\u2019ll want to plant them in the fall, let them go through winter and then harvest in the next summer.\n\n8.\tGreen onions \u2013 The white ends can be planted if you leave the little root nubs on. I usually leave about an inch of the white part on what I\u2019m cutting. The more white you leave the higher the chance of success and give you a more robust plant (though the success rate is very high regardless).\n\n9.\tCarrots \u2013 Carrot plants can be grown by planting the fat end of a carrot. Plant the flat side down and the round end up, with the round end sticking slightly out of the soil. I should note, while I\u2019ve successfully grown carrot plants like this, I\u2019ve never gotten a full-sized carrot from doing it. I presume it\u2019s possible, but clones grown in this way don\u2019t always have the same potential as growing from seed.\n\n10.\tRomaine lettuce ends \u2013 Put the end of the romaine head in a glass of water and new leaves will sprout up. Note that when you do this you\u2019re never going to get a full head out of it (at least I never have) the way you would with seed. It\u2019ll get about half-sized and then bolt. What I do is save the ends in the fridge until I have like 6 and then plant them all at once. When each have about 6-8 decent-sized leaves I\u2019ll harvest them and combine into a single salad. The lettuce will taste sweeter than mature lettuce because it will all be young.\n\n11.\tTomatoes \u2013 Seeds from store bought tomatoes can be grown. Keep in mind most store bought tomatoes are F1 hybrids (except heirloom tomatoes), so the seeds you plant might not produce tomatoes that look exactly like the ones you got the seeds from. I\u2019ve heard the same is true of peppers, as well, though all the peppers I\u2019ve ever grown from grocery store seeds end up looking just like their parents.\n\n12.\tPotatoes \u2013 Can be grown by letting eyes form on a potato and planting that. Cut the potato up so each chunk you plant has at least 3 eyes on it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/lh5sco/i_garden_and_cook_a_lot_one_of_the_coolest_things/", "created_utc": 1612996185.0, "score": 5640, "author": "SleepyConscience", "num_comments": 296, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/lh5sco/i_garden_and_cook_a_lot_one_of_the_coolest_things/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Finally paid off $10,000 of credit card debt! Thank you r/frugal! Here are my biggest takeaways.", "selftext": "I joined Reddit last July after maxing out two $5,000 credit cards and realizing I needed a change. I took up frugal habits learned from here and similar subreddits and after nine months, I'm finally debt-free! (I'm young and don't make a lot, so it took some time) Here are some of my biggest takeaways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHAME IN ASKING FOR HELP -  While I didn't get financial help, I told my family and friends about my situation, and that anything we could do to keep things inexpensive would be appreciated. Instead of going out to dinner and to the movies, I played tons of basketball with friends, started inviting people over for home-cooked meals, and had many cheesy-movie nights with friends. This adds up FAST and saves big money, and having support from loved ones cheering me on to pay things off made a huge difference.\n2. IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU PAY TOO MUCH FOR - Let's take body wash as an example. I was paying over $4 a bottle for the Dove men's soap. I went to Walmart and bought the cheapest soap I could find ($0.99) which was awful. I took a step up to the $1.50 Suave men's stuff and it worked excellent. I did this with everything I bought. I bought the cheapest version, and worked my way up until the quality was acceptable. More often than not, the cheapest thing is just fine!\n3. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT - Here's an unconventional example of this. I like video games, but realized that this wasn't a wise use of money when in debt. Instead of buying new games, I milked the ones I had for their full enjoyment. I've played nothing but Mario Kart 8, Splatoon 2, and Smash Ultimate for the past year and have bought no new games (except Smash when it came out) and have milked an incredible amount of hours (and value) out of them. No need to buy new games if you love the ones you have! This applies to many other items. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you /r/frugal for all the tips. I was a just lurker, but I still felt like I wasn't alone. I'm hoping these habits will lead to future financial well-being!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/bfegnu/finally_paid_off_10000_of_credit_card_debt_thank/", "created_utc": 1555779954.0, "score": 5539, "author": "EmployeeParking", "num_comments": 261, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/bfegnu/finally_paid_off_10000_of_credit_card_debt_thank/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "How to Travel in Japan cheaply - quick notes.", "selftext": "I read a lot from people about how expensive Tokyo and Japan in general is... we went to several cities, saw lots of sights, and while I would say it is far more expensive than, say, Mexico or something, it was still really cheap. So I thought I'd put together some quick tips to save money while out in Japan: \n\n- Biggest expensive is the flight itself. Use Scott's Cheap Flights if you are a frequent traveler (or sign up for free and get occasional emails if not) to help find cheap flights to the country. We bought our tickets for $450 round trip. \n\n- Use hostels, APA Hotels, etc. Hostels are the cheapest way to stay in Japan, and they are quite nice. We stayed in several, and if you book early you can get some really amazing ones that are gorgeous for cheap. They also have the benefit of local knowledge and lots of flyers of local events coming up. We attended a festival our second day we had no idea was going on. We actually browsed on hotels.com as well, scored an APA hotel in Kanazawa for less than the price of both of us staying at a hostel--and it came with roof-top bathing. (EDIT: It has been pointed out that APA hotels may be owned by some unsavory people. Business Hotels in general, something APA is, are cheap nice hotels that get the job done, so if you want more ethical purchases, you might steer clear of APA.) \n\n- Pack LIGHTLY. A backpack should be the most you are carrying because there is LOTS of walking in Japan; if you want to visit several cities like we did, you'll have your work cut out for you. You can get taxis and such, but that's part of what drives the cost up, and you don't want to be lugging tons of luggage on trains either. Hostels have laundry services many times, so you can wash clothes during the trip. \n\n- Get a Japan Rail Pass. This is THE BEST way to tour Japan and it is super cheap for tourists to do so. Taking a bullet train from Kyoto to Tokyo takes literally ZERO more dollars thanks to this pass, you can flash it as you walk by like Leeloo Dallas. It can seem expensive up front, but once you get there and realize how much it would cost just to wander around Tokyo, you realize how cheap and valuable this thing is. (EDIT: There is a lot of controversy apparently about this pass! I absolutely found it worth while and worth the money spent. It took a lot of the \"I need to plan everything right to spend my money accordingly\" out of the equation, and I didn't worry about catching the wrong trains or if we could afford to go to x city last minute or not. If train travel is an anxious thing for you, I definitely recommend this as it makes everything much easier.) \n\n- Konbinis are everywhere. Convenience stores (shortened to Konbini) have cheap food and we mostly used these for breakfast (if the hostel did not have one) and lunches. We got dinner at ramen shops, street food, conveyor belt sushi shops, small mom-and-pop shops, chain curry shops, etc. but you can shave a lot off of your food expenses with these. They actually have LOTS of healthy food in them. Many Americans are wired to think 'gas station style' stop-and-gos are full of fried food... these have that, but also healthy sandwiches, onigiri, etc. We kept our food costs waaay down thanks to these shops. The key is, Eat Japanese Food. If you eat specialty foods they will cost more than bento boxes, onigiri, etc. \n\n- Gardens are everywhere, and free to do for the most part. Small donations are encouraged (and we always did) but it costs very little to go see gorgeous quiet gardens. If your travel buddy wants to see the hustle of Harajuku and the noise and crowd is just too much, a HUGE garden is literally across the street and is somehow instantly quiet. \n\n- Carry cash on you. You need lots of it in Japan, and everything is very much so still cash-based wherever you go. \n\n- There are cities that are less expensive than others too! Takayama, for example, is gorgeous, thriving culture and community with SO much to do, and it is far cheaper than the heart of Tokyo. You can even get a cheap Ryokan ($75ish a person vs over $150-200 as the standard price) there (look up Nomadic Nerd's article on it as that's how we found it) there and have a beautiful luxury evening and meals included. I think we would have spent more if we stayed in just Tokyo. Kanazawa has lovely Geisha and Samurai districts. Matsumoto has one of the oldest castles ever. etc. \n\n- Stay away from Tokyo's big tourist traps. Robot Restaurant, for example, is a big one, but there are a lot of tourist traps in Tokyo where those areas tend to jack up the prices. This is true for most tourist areas of course. (EDIT: Hahaha this was ALSO a big point of debate! Some people really liked the outlandishness of it all, some people found it uncomfortable. For me, definitely, the whole area it was in + the RR itself was awful and a waste of money.... Thoough, I more enjoyed the gardens, temples, street vendors, etc. So take it for what it's worth and try it out if it sounds good to you. Don't take my word for anything, I may have different tastes than you!) \n\n- The airports and train stations actually have some cool souvenirs. If you're waiting to buy souvenirs or seem to have forgotten some last minute, the airport (and the train stations) actually isn't totally overpriced like you'd find in the states. You can get insanely cute cakes and such that make great take-home souvenirs without having to carry them everywhere with you the whole trip. \n\n- If you're looking for a cheap Yukata or Kimono to take home, consider stopping by Chicago second hand store in Harajuku. I bought 2 yukatas for $20 each and 1 obi that matched both of the for around the same price. Tokyu Hands is an insane department store in Tokyo (EDIT: Rightly pointed out, not JUST in Tokyo, but there IS one in Tokyo) that has floors of cool gifts and stuff--I bought a couple terrific bento boxes from there. \n\n- If you have a job where you use pens a lot, consider buying some in Japan! Im a nurse, and use different color pens to help organize everything, and Japan had my back with awesome professional looking combo-color pens. \n\nAnyways, that's all I got, feel free to add more here in the comments too! \n\nEDIT: There absolutely IS a whole subreddit about traveling to this amazing country and I recommend checking it out before you go. \n\nEDIT 2: People were asking about my budget. \n\nIt was $3,500 for 2 people for 2 weeks. \n\nI only spent $2,500 in Japan itself including the flights. \n\nThe flights were $450 each from San Fran to Narita. A small part of why the flights were cheaper was because we got free flights to San Francisco from the East Coast (I have a friend that works in the airport and I did her a solid, so she repayed me with that.) However, South West has cheap flights in country in the US, and I would recommend catching a flight to the West coast and trying to fly to Japan from there to save loads of money on the flight. We were going to do this and book the flights for around $100-200 (I can't remember, somewhere between those numbers) one way when we got the free deal as an option. Still, $1,300 for both people to fly is pretty cheap! We did spend slightly outside of that budget in China, but we had overnight lay-overs in China 2 nights (one there, one back). I did not include that in here because we chose that lay-over over direct flights, and we could have slept in the airport, but opted to get out and sight see. \n\nThe hotels/hostels costed around $10-20 a night depending on where we stayed. \n\nWe spent around $10 (mostly close to $10) a day each on food. I count some odd ball luxury items food-wise as 'entertainment' if we were there for other purposes (historical site, or something like that) so some of that IS in our activities fund, but this is probably 10/14 days worth. Hostels with breakfast included FTW.\n\nThe JRP was ~$200 a person.

{"title": "I quit a well paying job that I love because of this sub.", "selftext": "You guys inspired me to take a pay cut and quit a job I once thought I would retire from, in the name of frugality. \n\nFor the past five years I've had a job that I love, I get paid ridiculously well and I have great benefits, it's a good culture etc. etc. But over time,  Ive felt increasingly anxious and dissatisfied with the job and until recently I wasn't sure why.\n\nI've kind of always been aware that my time even off the company clock has monetary value, and so sometimes I will pay more for something that saves a lot of time, or I will forgo money-saving measures that take too much time. But this sub has led me to take that time-frugal mindset to the next level. \n\nFirst, by teaching me that quality time with loved ones is even more valuable than regular time. So many of the comments on this sub about saving time mention using that time to be with family and friends. \n\nSecondly, by teaching me to look even deeper into budgeting and decision making when it comes to opportunity costs. Sometimes you can be doing great and making money and saving money but simultaneously preventing yourself from being even greater and saving and making even more money. \n\nSo when I was commuting over an hour each way in my personal vehicle and getting home past my daughter's bedtime and working every weekend, even though I was enjoying myself at work and thought the generous compensation was worth it, I was really losing out in the long term. I was burning out at work and burning up my car and burning through the short times I had with her by being exhausted. \n\nToday I took an offer which is a pay cut to have a schedule and a work location which will allow me to drop off and pick up my daughter at school every single day of the week. That is more valuable than I can express.

It's a super easy way to make some cash and makes you feel really good for helping the environment. Now we live in a state that doesn't have a can deposit so each can is only worth 1-2cents.

{"title": "7 random things I do to be Frugal", "selftext": "1) I live in wifi 99% of the time.  Most cell phone plans are under $10 for 1GB of data.  Tello starts at $5\n\n2) Bunny Ears / Antenna provide over 20 channels of great content. ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, and more for free.\n\n3) The library is not your library of the 90s.  From PS5 games to great movies.  Check out weekly for tons of free entertainment. \n\n4) Cash \"Stings\" more than swiping a card.   If you want to stick to a budget, hand over cash on your impulse buys and feel that sting.   Studies show, even on 0% interest cards, you spend 20% more when swiping.   Save money buy feeling the money leave your hands. \n\n5) When going to live events, football games/concert.  Park and wait until the game starts.  I have seen tickets drop from $150 to $8 multiple times by just missing the kickoff and then walking in.   We have set in seats on a premier concert which started at $500 ticket, missed the opening act and got in for under $60.  Big Ten College basketball games for under $4 ticket after fees..  People panic when selling 3rd party tickets after the event starts.   Enjoy the main act and save up to 95%. \n\n6) Designate a \"no spend month\" twice a eyar.  February is a good place to start with fewer days.  Use every single thing in your house to eat, look for coupons, eat rice and beans.  Try to live like you've never lived 2 out of 12 months and it really helps. \n\n7) Panera Sip Club.  Sign ups usually give you 3 months free and next 3 at a discount when you sign up.  If you live within a couple of miles,  get large drinks without ice and take home.  You can get Coffee, Iced Coffee, Tea, Iced Tea, Soda, Bubbly, etc.   Go a couple times a day and have plenty of drinks to share without the ice or have multiple times.   An Iced Coffee with my own ice, makes 5 cups of my own cups.   Full price is $11.99/month. I have been a customer for a year and yet to have paid that much.  Probably spent $3,000 in retail pricing.

I was living on the east coast, paying a ridiculous amount of money for a tiny apartment and general cost of living.

This allowed me to start paying more than the minimums on my cards.

Here are some of mine:\n\n1. Dried beans, lentils and rice can provide you with a lot of cheap meals. Also, Google the ingredients you have on hand and AI will often recommend a recipe.\n\n2. Grocery stores sometimes will sell you produce that is too old to sell, but still edible if cooked right away. Don't be ashamed to ask your local grocer!\n\n3. No entertainment expenses. Library or bust. There is also a lot on youtube or free streaming, including tutorials, movies, exercise classes and music.\n\n4. Bored or anxious? Take a long walk in the woods or clean your house with music blaring.\n\n5. Invite friends to your place for coffee/tea and snacks instead of going out. Throw a pot luck for games or movie nights.\n\n6. Pay attention to free or discount days at your local museums or attractions. \n\n7. Borrow things from friends/family. We've borrowed and loaned out tools, specialty cooking appliances, divided plants, books, movies, games, etc.\n\n8. Mend or upcycle your clothes.

You don't have to drop $10,000 on a new roof. Roofs are wear items by the way: they don't last indefinitely. Somewhere around the corner that $10,000 bill is going to land. \n\nToilet leaking at the base. Replace that yourself for a total of $300 or do you pay $1,200 for someone else to do it?\n\n\"Oh no, my gutter is leaking and I got water running down the side of my house onto the window leaking in, do I fix that myself for $200 or do I pay someone $1,000?\"\n\nI come from a family of renters and I have been a renter a long time, but 3 years ago I became a homeowner. I have since realized how much I took for granted. Literally everything is now my responsibility. And failure to be responsible will lead to unlivable conditions. With no one to complain to. \n\nIf you have the money to buy a really good house then yes it's better than renting. If you can do the work yourself (like I do), yes it's better than renting. If you aren't making big money and also aren't handy, you should rethink how owning a home is so much better than renting.\n\nEdit: Some have mistaken this post for me advocating against home ownership. That's absolutely not the case. It works for me because I can do the repairs myself. I'm merely explaining that if I made the same income but didn't have handy skills, it would be a total sinkhole. \n\nI made this post because I see a lot of low-income individuals looking at home ownership like it's an escape from overpaying on rent. The costs to own are far more than the mortgage payment alone. Either you have the money to absorb the costs or you have the skills to do the work yourself.

{"title": "If you are going to toe the line between frugal and cheap at least be pleasant about it.", "selftext": "I will start by saying I've had to be ridiculously careful with my money when I was younger and remember how much it sucked. Like living in my car for weeks and only eating what was left on bussed plates at work broke. But I never made it anyone else's problem or acted an ass about it. So my tolerance is 0 for people who are assholes because they feel they deserve to be. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, on to the story. I was at the store NYE picking up some things to enjoy with my boyfriend for the holiday and decided I'd like to tack on some crab legs. At the seafood counter was a woman already fighting with the employee at the case. He was apologizing stating that he has to serve the meat as it is and she was looking at him like he'd just slapped her in the face. My curiosity did get the better of me so I stood right behind her. They argued back and forth for a bit, her screaming she shouldn't have to pay by weight for parts she can't eat and him apologizing, stating policy and trying to just get her through the line now that three of us were standing there waiting. You guys... This bitch was trying to get him to remove the tails of the $11lb shrimp before weighing it. That might get you what, 2 extra shrimp? I was gobsmacked. I understand when you want something out of budget and are desperate to find a way to splurge but what the absolute fuck. Eventually a manager came out and stepped to the side with her while the poor guy just getting chewed on had to throw his game face back on and serve the rest of the customers. There was maybe a pound and a half of shrimp left and I seriously debated getting petty and just buying it to end the bullshit still raging next to me but decided against it. She was still bitching as I left the counter. People like that make their own lives harder and then take it out on others because they have a hard life. Just pisses me right off. \n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR/Moral of the story, pick your battles. Cut costs and corners where you can but not if it will negatively impact others. Checking if maybe you can have a discount on a dented can? Frugal win! Demanding the poor counter clerk de-tail 30 shrimp for you to save pennies?

{"title": "I only spent $1,728.79 in 2022 for groceries, averaging around $144 a month, here\u2019s some tips!", "selftext": " \n\nAs the title suggest, I went through my budget and was surprised to see I really underspent on my groceries and wanted to share some things we did that might be helpful. This will be a long post but hopefully it helps someone, I only just learned how to cook this past year and used this sub to help me, so hopefully I\u2019m able to pay it forward since some of the things I learned I haven\u2019t seen mentioned here. Some things to get out of the way before the tips:\n\n* This is strictly groceries, not eating out, or household maintenance no pots/pans, cleaning supplies, paper towels, coffee filters etc etc strictly food we consume\n* I am the main decision maker when it comes to the kitchen, I pay for about %75 of groceries, my SO pitches in for smaller grocery runs (under $25) so the average is probably $200 a month, still way below the standard $300 for household of 2 adults\n* We\u2019re both 30, both work full time, no kids and combined make probably just over $130k in a fairly big city (MCOL) in the NE USA\n* We share about %90 of the food we eat. Nothing exclusive to one another except a few random things ex. I drink almond milk, my SO drinks whole milk and some other small differences.\n* We are NOT foodies, and we are NOT great cooks. This is my first year actually learning to cook. And it\u2019s the reason we wanted to keep our grocery budget low, since we value everything else in our budget more than food, so as long as it\u2019s nutritious and at least decent to eat, we\u2019re happy :)\n\nLast thing I wanted to share was some life events that impacted our budget, we relocated to this new city Dec 2021, so the first few months of the year I was still building out my pantry, which was an added expense. Then this past September I got a work from home position, so far my budget has not been influenced too much by it but only time will tell.\n\nOkay time for tips:\n\n\\-**Most likely what you grew up eating, will be the cheapest thing for you to cook.** Whether you\u2019re hispanic, asian, american, european\u2026you have familiarity with the flavors and your pantry is probably already geared towards that pallet bringing the cost per meal way lower. For instance, I\u2019m hispanic and I know off the top of my head 10 different rice recipes just because I grew up eating them, even if some of them I can\u2019t cook just yet, I know how they\u2019re suppose to taste and what\u2019s involved in it. Give me a potato and I only know how to boil it. Maybe I\u2019ll add it to one of my hispanic dishes, but guess what? I\u2019m still cooking rice to go with it. Speaking about cost per meal, I quickly realized how expensive it was to branch to diff food profiles, I wanted to learn how to cook more asian dishes and kinda had to stop haha, I had no room in my small kitchen for all the additional spices and noodles needed. I settled with some of the basic condiments (sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce and kewpie lol) incase I want to venture off a bit, again a lot of these asian meals also involved rice. Leading me to my biggest point.\n\n\\-**Stick to one carb and run with it**, I rarely cook with potatoes, bread or pasta, my go-to carb is rice (no surprise). I know a lot of people complain about just eating rice and beans to be frugal. But take for instance, if you love potatoes, there\u2019s literally hundreds of different ways to make potatoes interesting, seriously you really can\u2019t get bored of something you *like* to eat. I think that\u2019s the key. I do keep a box of spaghetti handy, and my bf buys bagels for his breakfast, and every once in a while I\u2019ll venture into other things but 80% of the time we\u2019re eating rice and beans (with a salad and a protein).\n\n\\-**We buy the same protein every two weeks.** We buy chicken breast (more on that later), pork-chop (sometimes bone it sometimes not), ground beef (80/20) and shrimp. Every two weeks we run out of them, and we buy them again. If one gets too expensive, we buy an alternative (like ground turkey, or tilapia or chicken strips, whatever is available or cheapest) or we\u2019ll just go w/o one of the protein and maybe just do a veggie dish or stretch out whatever we already have. Eggs we buy about once a month, we only cook them on our off days.\n\n\\-**We almost never buy pre-made meals**, in the beginning I would buy frozen dinners for work and that\u2019s included in this budget. But I would keep them at my work fridge, at home we just cook, eat leftovers or eat out before getting home. Now that I\u2019m working from home, and have a bit more time I do want to learn how to make corn bread and banana bread since we do buy those for quick breakfast and those are easy enough to bake with fairly simple ingredients. I\u2019m also learning how to cut a whole chicken so again I can make stock and learn how to cook more than just chicken breast (idk if I\u2019ll success but we\u2019ll see!).\n\n\\-**We always buy fruit and vegetables**, again we\u2019re creatures of habit. We usually buy the same thing: romaine lettuce, tomatoes, baby carrots, and onion. And in the fruit department we rotate a bit more but we usually always have: apples, tangerine and blueberries (currently we also have kiwi and bananas, yum!). We use the veggies for salad with every meal but also for me to seasoning and we add the fruits to our oatmeal in the morning (yep we buy steel cut oats and just cook it stove top in the morning).\n\n\\-**We shop around a lot**. We do most of our groceries at Aldi (about %80). We also go to our local H-Mart and we just found a nearby Trader Joes near us, those are all our cheap options. We do a ShopRite or Walmart run every once in a while for some specific things. Lastly we do have a Costco membership where we do stock up on dry goods (for instance a 24pck of box almost milk, or 25pds of jasmine rice), but we mostly use Costco for clothes, appliances and household essentials, it does add up in savings even for just the two of us.\n\n\\-**I season in bulk and rotate!** So for instance, if have ground beef, I usually season the whole thing with my basic seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic, Goya), leave half out and freeze the other Half. I can make this weeks ground beef Spanish style with tomatoes, olives, cappers, peppers, cilantro etc and then, next week defrost the remainder and stir fry it with ginger, soy sauce, green onions and carrots. One base seasoning, two different approaches. Same with beans, I boil a pound of dry beans, season it all in a big pot, and divy up what I'll do with it and freeze the rest. Now I only cook about 2-3 time a week, If I\u2019m tired, I know my beef is seasoned and can throw it in the pot, and I can just defrost some beans and put my rice cooker on and have dinner ready in 25min.\n\n\\-**Keep a notepad on the fridge with a running list for when things run out**, I know its common knowledge to always have a shopping list, but it really does work and help curve additional spending!\n\n\\-**If we can't eat it in a week, we freeze it.** Like just the most random things, you\u2019d be surprise you can freeze. I for instance always freeze my cilantro, parsley and green peppers. Like I mentioned I usually freeze my rice and beans. My boyfriend always freezes hotdogs and bread. Also if there\u2019s a can I didn\u2019t finish off, like of tomatoes paste, I just chuck it in the freezer and next time I need it I run through hot water for a few minutes.\n\n\\-**Have an** **Emergency Meal ( a \"911\" like my mom used to call it)**. This is the \u201cI don\u2019t want to lift a finger\u201d meal or the \u201cour fridge is bare but we\u2019re not off until tomorrow to grocery shop\u201d meal. For us it's frozen french fries and frozen jamaican patties, its the only exception to pre-made meal we buy,  we really have gotten into a groove of cooking regularly so it, we only prepare it about 2-3 times a month.\n\nAgain, these are things I had to learn by trial and error, some may be obvious to the general public, but as someone who just learned to cook, it really wasn\u2019t that obvious to me. Yes we probably had the money to be more liberal with our groceries, but 1. We had a lot of other obligations eating at our budget (no pun intended) so this was an easy place to free up some money. 2. We wanted to build habits that would help us in the future, like when we have kids and our budget will inevitable go up. \n\n\\*\\*For those wondering, I got these exact numbers from budgeting with YNAB (You Need a Budget), just went through my year-end reports, so they\u2019re pretty accurate as I track every dollar I spend in the year.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/101t033/i_only_spent_172879_in_2022_for_groceries/", "created_utc": 1672706266.0, "score": 4635, "author": "forgivemefashion", "num_comments": 302, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/101t033/i_only_spent_172879_in_2022_for_groceries/", "html_title": ""}

The frames are literally made of cheap plywood and cardboard... yes cardboard. I needed a looooong couch to fill a space and everything of decent quality that fit my taste was really expensive, $2000-$3000. \n\nSo I found a couch on Craigslist that I loved. It was custom built in 1954 and owned by the same woman ever since. It was the \u201cgood couch\u201d and only sat on when she entertained in the formal dining room. The frame is solid oak and sturdy as hell. It has 8 way hand tied springs, which only the highest end sofas use these days. The upholstery was in good shape, but not my taste. The sofa was $200. \n\nI asked around until I found an older gentleman who worked out of his home shop. He\u2019s retired but still does little jobs here and there. Several people told me he was one of the last true craftsmen in the field. He\u2019s 87 and doesn\u2019t need the money he told me, he just doesn\u2019t have anything else to do and enjoys the work. His rates reflect that and are much more than fair. He recovered the entire couch and made new cushions for $490!\n\nThe fabric was maybe my best find. A huge fabric wholesaler happens to be headquartered in my town, and their outlet store is nearby. All the lines they discontinue are sent there. And it\u2019s cheap. Really cheap. There\u2019s no original price on the bolts, or info about the fabric, you just sort through all these unlabeled bolts and find something you like. This one was $4 a yard! And if you buy the entire bolt it\u2019s 50% off. So I got all my material for $34. I was actually able to find a mill marking on the bolt when I got home and looked it up online. This upholstery fabric sold for $109 a yard new! It\u2019s essentially a high end material used for swanky offices, casinos, etc. It\u2019s made to last forever with high usage. \n\nI got my dream sofa for $724, and I couldn\u2019t be happier!!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/9viimz/ive_been_looking_for_a_high_quality_couch_for/", "created_utc": 1541748979.0, "score": 4347, "author": "cv_mason", "num_comments": 243, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/9viimz/ive_been_looking_for_a_high_quality_couch_for/", "html_title": ""}

This is one of the things I most commonly see folks confused about in r/FreeEBOOKS.  \n\n[Here is an article about the release of works to the public domain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/)\n\n[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.\n\nEbooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. \n\n\n\nPlease ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. \n\n\n# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address\n\nFirst you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it\u2019s way easier to find on your kindle.  \n\n\n**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -> All Settings -> Your Account -> your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**\n\n\nHarder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts & lists-> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg\n\n \n\n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png\n\n \n\n\nClick \u201cDevices\u201d in the menu near the top ->\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png\n\n \n\n\nclick the \u201c\u2026\u201d next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png\n\n \n\n\n(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have \u201cdevices\u201d going back for many years of phones) \n\nYour send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com\n\n\n\n \n\n# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.\n\n \n\nOn [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click \u201cAccount & Lists\u201d -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg\n\n \n\nunder \u201cDigital content and devices\u201d click \u201cContent and Devices\u201d ->\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png\n\n\n\n\nclick \u201cPreferences\" in the top bar of that page -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png\n\n \n\nClick \u201cPersonal Document Settings\u201d -> \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png\n\n \n\nfind \u201cApproved Personal Document E-mail List\u201d on that page -> make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png\n\n\n\n\n# 3 - Let\u2019s send a book.  \n\n \n\nGo to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \\-> click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png\n\n \n\nNow open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  \n\nGo to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  \n\nI typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.  \n\nHere are some lists of free ebooks by topic:\n\n[100 free mythology books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9qep6e/heres_a_list_of_100_free_mythology_and_folklore/)\n\n[250 free kids and YA books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9rkjqc/here_is_a_list_ive_compiled_of_250_free_yakids/)\n\n[200 free sci-fi books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9tvcyj/here_is_a_list_of_200_free_scifi_ebooks_ive/)\n\n[100 free classics](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/9vy4oa/the_top_100_free_classic_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free Christmas ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a5y4cg/here_is_a_list_of_100_free_christmas_ebooks_ive/)\n\n[100 free history ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a9hsti/here_are_100_free_history_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free poetry books](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/a9u60i/here_are_100_free_poetry_ebooks_from_project/)\n\n[100 free memoirs and autobiographies](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeEBOOKS/comments/abaywb/here_are_100_free_ebooks_of_memoirs_and/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/abaxy5/on_january_1_2019_for_the_first_time_in_more_than/", "created_utc": 1546288305.0, "score": 4259, "author": "Chtorrr", "num_comments": 91, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/abaxy5/on_january_1_2019_for_the_first_time_in_more_than/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Being frugal has helped me with dating!", "selftext": "Howdy r/frugal, long-time lurker here. I've been frugal for years which has really helped me develop some new skills which has had an unexpected positive effect on my dating life. For the past several months I've been spending some time with a great girl, and recently realized that some of her favorite things about me are a result of me being frugal. For example:\n\n* For years I was too poor to afford fancy meals, so I learned how to cook - and cook well. She LOVES it when I cook for her rather than take her out to a nice dinner. I have easily saved hundreds of dollars from this aspect of dating alone.\n* Similarly, I grew up eating fresh, artisan bread from local bakeries my entire childhood, but adult me was too poor to buy bread at a bakery. So, I learned to bake. Whenever I bake, I double my yield and send her home with a loaf.\n* I live in a city where there are TONS of free things to do. I follow lots of blogs, newsletters, instagram accounts, etc and curate these events for us to go to. She mentioned the other day how she loves that I have my finger on the pulse of the city. I thought to myself how funny that is because the reason I started going to these free events was because they were free.\n* In the summertime, to save some money on groceries, I plant a small garden with herbs, fresh vegetables, and a few fruits. My passion for gardening and enthusiasm in sharing it with her has been very well received.\n* In brainstorming adventures for us to go on, I've opted for hikes (free) or bike rides (cheap if you use bikeshare) rather than fancy, expensive experiences. She's new to outdoor activities, but has really loved these dates.\n\nAnywho, take it from me - I did not expect the benefits of frugality to spill over into my dating life. But here we are, and I am so much better for it! Good luck to all and happy fruging.\n\nEdit: Wow! Gold! On a post about being frugal... ah the irony, but thanks nonetheless!

{"title": "WARNING: Sears' current promo of \"$7.00 off $70.00+ Purchase\" will sneak the charge back in at the end of the transaction.", "selftext": "Hello all, \n\nI bought a mattress online from Sears today.  \n\nAfter I made the purchase, I received the receipt in the mail, and as always looked it over to make sure everything looked all right. \n\nHere is an album showing the receipt emailed to me from Sears and an explanation of how they overcharged me, along with a screenshot of the problematic promo:  http://imgur.com/a/cDrxi\n\nI just spent over an hour on the phone with customer service, spoke with a regular representative who told me Sears would only add $7.00 in points back to my \"Save Your Way Account\" and not back to my credit card.  I seldom shop at Sears, so I didn't want that.  I told her I could just cancel the whole order and put it through again to see if the new promo worked the second time, but she told me since I paid with gift cards, that it would take up to 3 business days to process the balance back on my gift cards to try again.  And there was no guarentee that it would work the second time. \n\nThen I spoke to a supervisor to see if there was anything that could be done, and to give him a heads up that their website promo is being screwy and they should probably alert IT (just my advice).  At first he didn't believe me that there was a promo going on for $7 off a Purchase of $70+.  Then once I had him look at the actual company website to see I didn't make up the promo, he kept trying to get me to just accept the points instead of a return to my credit card.  Then he tried to tell me that since I used gift cards, my price fell below the $70+ restriction on the promo, which I could tell he was a rule he made up on the spot (says no where on the promo, and gift cards are to be treated as cash).  Finally he ended up giving me an email address to their \"back office\" to get rid of me when I wouldn't relent that the $7.00 store credit was not acceptable.  I wrote a lengthy email, sent it, and it bounced back to me that saying, \"WHOOPS!  You replied to an unmonitored email address.\"  Great. \n\nFinally I spoke with a very kind customer service rep online who told me that the rude supervisor apparently sent in a request for a $7.00 credit back to my *credit card* to their billing department, and I will find out in about 3-5 business days if it's granted to me.   \n\nI know this seems like a big fuss to make over $7.00, but I knew if anyone would understand why I fought for it, it would be the people of /r/Frugal.  Pretty sure this is the sort of thing that could evolve into a class action law suit if it happens to enough people.  Oh well.  Guess I'll see in a few days if I get my money back or not.  \n\nTL;DR:  $7 off promo is listed on my receipt, but my final payment does not reflect that discount.  Called customer service, spoke with one helpless person, one rude supervisor, and one nice guy on chat and I *might* get my money back if \"billing approves it.\" \n\n\nEdit:  I received my receipt via E-mail.  Electronic mail.  Not snail mail haha.  Thanks for all the responses everyone!  FYI, I have not tweeted at Sears or gone to their Facebook yet.  I'll wait to see if they approve or deny the request that the Supervisor submitted before I jump in for a good old fashioned public shaming.\n.    \n.  \n.    \n.  \nEDIT 2:  So far I've had two people from Sears reach out to me via PM.  I called and spoke with one of them today, and it sounds like he's been able to get the $7.00 returned to my credit card.  He told me it should show up in 3-5 business days, so I'll be sure to post an update for anyone who'd be interested to let you know if it comes through or not.

{"title": "I was a coffee barista for 4 years; here are our recipes for our best selling iced drinks that you can make for cheaper at home!", "selftext": "Former coffee barista here! There was a post recently on here where I left a comment about how to make some specialty drinks that people enjoyed when I was a barista, so I figured I\u2019d make my own post so more people could find it.\n\nAs a preface since this is r/frugal and I\u2019m sure there are other current/former barista\u2019s on here\u2014take my advice/ingredient recs with a grain of salt! I didn\u2019t work at Starbucks (I worked at a small independent cafe here in Westchester NY) and every cafe uses different ingredients and has different ratios for their recipes. So if you\u2019ve found that a recipe I\u2019m sharing sounds too sweet or you don\u2019t want to spend x for a certain brand because you have your own preferred brand then hey, feel free to experiment/substitute with your favorites! Nothing is set in stone and at best these are just base recipes till you figure out what ratio and brands work for you. And if you think to yourself \u201cwell I\u2019m not spending $30+ for all that!\u201d Then clearly you don\u2019t drink these enough to hurt your wallet\u2014which, good for you.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get started!\n\n**Chocolate sauce:**\n\nA tip I learned for mocha drinks (even without a fancy machine) is to either add a splash of hot coffee to the bottom of your cup after decorating the sides with chocolate, so it\u2019ll melt and you don\u2019t get a straw full of chocolate as your first sip and you still have the pretty decoration. The reason I started doing this (I wasn\u2019t trained about that) was because I noticed customers complaining about one of my coworkers leaving a huge pool of chocolate at the bottom of the cup, so from then on I started melting it with some coffee and I suddenly had customers wanting me specifically to make their drinks\u2014it\u2019s the little things that make a difference, I\u2019m telling ya! Same can be applied for caramel sauce and honey--honey in coffee is sinfully delicious.\n\nIf you\u2019re using cold brew and don\u2019t have hot coffee ready then a splash of hot water works just as well and won\u2019t mess up the flavor.\n\n**Syrups/sauces:**\n\nHomeGoods/Marshalls has fantastic coffee syrups and is easily available to the public--Amazon carries these brands as well but I've found that they're  cheaper at HomeGoods/Marshalls. The best brands for flavoring coffees are either the Torani or Monin syrups; that\u2019s what my job used and customers loved them and I even go out of my way to see what brands small coffee shops use and so far it\u2019s been these two so you know they\u2019re good. I have also seen both the Torani chocolate and caramel sauce there and for the price they are worth the buy. Unfortunately when you buy them from the store they don't come with a pump, so if you have a shot glass then just add a shot at a time to your drink till you're content with the flavor. If you don't have a shot glass them go a tablespoon at a time.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to cut down on sugar (or can't have) but still enjoy flavored drinks then the Torani sugar free vanilla (which is what I usually see at HomeGoods) is VERY sweet (tastes sweeter than the normal one actually) so I usually just add a pump or even just half a pump to my coffee and it\u2019s delicious. If you\u2019re not used to sugar free syrups you\u2019ll definitely taste a difference but trust me when I say that if you really wanna cut out your sugar intake (and are fine with fake sugar) then just keep trying to drink it and after maybe a week your palette changes and you\u2019ll find it yummy\ud83e\udd24\n\nFor anyone doubting my last comment: I used to take my coffee as super light and sweet back when I was in college; basically sugar in a cup and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t stand the taste of anything sugar free. Then I realized I should stop adding sugar and slowly phased out the amount of sugar I was using until I got to the point where I was just drinking my coffee with some oat milk. Wasn\u2019t super yummy but it got the job done and I wasn\u2019t making a face when drinking it anymore! Whenever I want to actually enjoy the taste is when I\u2019ll add a half pump of sugar free vanilla syrup to my cup.\n\nThe flavors we had of the syrups were as followed for our hot or iced coffees/lattes (starting from the left was the most popular, to the least popular with customers):\n\nVanilla\n\nPistachio (Monin brand\u2014the syrup is green and I\u2019m not joking when I say we had times where we couldn\u2019t meet demand because we kept running out)\n\nCaramel\n\nSugar free vanilla\n\nHazelnut\n\nPumpkin spice (not the worst one or anything but people tended to think we didn't carry pumpkin spice year round so they didn't ask for it outside of Autumn. This is honestly best in the chai mixes anyway--not on its own.)\n\nAnd for iced teas:\n\nMango (Torani brand)\n\nPeach (Monin brand)\n\nSugar free raspberry (Monin)\n\n**Chai/Pumpkin spice lattes:**\n\nWe used Big Train brand chai latte mix (find it on Amazon\u2014 it\u2019s a bag or can with a dark purple label).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a steamer wand then add 2-3 scoops to a small pan with your choice of milk with 1-2 pumps of vanilla syrup. Mix well and heat up till desired temperature. If doing iced then add 3 scoops and 2 pumps of vanilla syrup. It\u2019s a sweet mix on its own, but with some experimenting you\u2019ll find your ratio of sweetness when adding the syrups.\n\nIf you want a pumpkin spice flavored drink then buy a bottle of Torani pumpkin spice syrup and add 1 pump of vanilla and 2 pumps of pumpkin spice instead (and a single or double shot of espresso\u2014pumpkin spice is traditionally with espresso but if you just want something similar to the chai/don't want espresso then feel free to omit the espresso). Top it off with some cinnamon\u2014yum!\n\nChai lattes were (and still currently are) the biggest seller at that cafe. You can also try using Trader Joe\u2019s brand chai latte mix; this brand mix is slightly less sweet but is spicier (as in flavor because of the spices used\u2014not spicy as in hot. The flavor is exactly what you\u2019ll think of when you think Autumn) which can really be yummy as well. One of my coworkers that doesn\u2019t like how sweet the Big Train brand is said that she finds the Trader Joe\u2019s brand to be of better quality. Big Train Chai mix is not authentic chai but it does taste good, which I know is what a lot of people care most about.\n\nIf you want some coffee in your chai then feel free to make it a dirty chai by adding a shot or two of espresso into it.\n\n**Chocolate/Strawberry milk:**\n\nWhenever we had kids (or even some adults) we'd get asked for chocolate milk. It wasn't on our menu but I made it for them anyway. Just take your desired amount of milk and add it to a small pan with chocolate sauce and 1-3 pumps of vanilla. Chocolate milk is served cold, so just barely heat up the milk enough to melt the chocolate and then pour it into your cup. I usually will add 1-2 ice cubes to keep the milk cold for the kids.\n\nWe had a strawberry puree for one of our pastries and one day I experimented to see if I could make strawberry milk and it worked and it's downright sinful. You can either buy your own strawberry puree or make your own by just adding some sugar to some mashed up strawberries and cooking them on the stovetop till the strawberries break down. Once cooled you can store in a jar. Look up any video for making jams and it's about the same process I believe, just less cooking time since the longer you cook it for, the thicker it becomes. Purees are looser than jams.\n\nOnce you have your puree, do the same steps as you would for the chocolate milk (the vanilla syrup is what really brings the flavor together).\n\n**Ice cubes:**\n\nIf you love iced coffee during the summer then coffee ice cubes are great! We only made a few trays because the customers that knew we had them would take advantage and we couldn\u2019t meet the demand for them since we already had a regular ice machine. Coffee ice cubes really help keep your drink from getting watered down. Espresso ice cubes work great as well either for your iced coffee or for an iced latte. Don\u2019t bother adding milks or flavorings to the cubes; just put black coffee or just pure espresso into an ice cube tray and freeze them. We used large silicone ice cube molds for the largest cup (it never fit into the cup so I would just run some hot water on the cube to get it to the right size)\u2026was a bit more convenient to do during a rush then to just grab a glove and hope I get a bunch of smaller cubes into the cup without dropping anything. Plus the bigger cubes tend to last until you finish your drink and still be plenty left over if you wanted a refill. If making regular sized cubes is better for you then go right ahead.\n\n**Hot chocolate:**\n\nFor a really yummy hot chocolate I recommend the Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix. We kind of used whatever brand we could get but our customers went crazy for the Ghirardelli mix specifically so we tended to stick with that one.\n\nAdd a drizzle of chocolate sauce to your pan with your desired amount of milk and for 24oz add 3 scoops (2 scoops for anything smaller) and 1-2 pumps of vanilla syrup OR 1 pump of vanilla and 1-2 pumps of peppermint syrup for a peppermint hot chocolate. Heat to your desired temperature, drizzle a bit of chocolate into your cup and top off the drink with some whipped cream and unsweetened cocoa powder. If you\u2019d like a dirty hot chocolate (which are crazy delicious) then add a shot of espresso to your cup. The flavor from the espresso pairs very well with chocolate.\n\nI have tried the Ghirardelli white chocolate mix and it was alright\u2014didn\u2019t taste bad or anything but I wasn\u2019t personally crazy about it, but then again I\u2019m not super crazy about white chocolate in general but some people are. If you prefer white chocolate then use the same recipe for the hot chocolate mix but just replace the chocolate sauce with white chocolate sauce. Or you can make it black & white by using chocolate sauce with the white chocolate mix (that was my favorite thing to do).\n\nI actually did once mix the white chocolate mix and hot chocolate mix together so the white chocolate mix wouldn\u2019t go to waste\u2014and it was pretty good!\n\n**Iced tea:**\n\nWhen it comes to steeping teas you\u2019d be surprised by how accurate tea guides are\u2014the ones that tell you how long to steep certain types. We used to have a huge tea bag that we would just drop in a huge container of hot water and customers hated it\u2014too bitter/didn\u2019t taste yummy. Then my coworker looked up what temperature the water for black tea should be and how long it should be steeped for and customers started loving the flavor after that.\n\nIf you enjoy fresh iced teas then I\u2019ve found that mixing different tea bags can make some really refreshing teas\u2014I actually got the idea from one of our regulars. We usually used the Bigelow brand or Steep brand tea bags.\n\nTake 1 bag of mint and 1 bag of green tea. Once it\u2019s steeping add in a piece of yellow lemon and your desired amount of honey or agave. We usually would put the steaming pitcher (or cup) in an ice bath and by the time the mixture cooled (after mixing it every now and then to speed up the cooling process) then it was perfect and less likely to get bitter from over steeping. You can either take the bags out or keep them in your cup and just add your desired amount of ice (you get a stronger flavor this way and with the honey you\u2019re less likely for the bags to make the tea bitter). This iced tea is perfect during a hot summer day\u2014the mint is mellowed out by the grassiness of the green tea and the honey really bring outs the flavor. So you get the coolness of the mint and the sweetness from the honey.\n\nAnother refreshing combination is 1 bag of lemon ginger with 1 bag of green (specifically the Steep brand lemon ginger bags\u2014my absolute favorite, and it was a huge favorite for customers as well\u2014hot or cold) with some honey and lemon. Or even 1 bag of lemon ginger with 1 bag of mint with honey and lemon.\n\n**\\*Please make sure that either both teas are caffeine free or just one of them has caffeine. If both have caffeine then it'll be too much caffeine for your body to handle and your heart will race like crazy and make you feel like you're having a panic attack--ask me how I know...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**London fog:**\n\nTake two bags of earl grey tea and add 2-3 pumps of vanilla syrup. After adding your desired amount of hot water, add the cup to an ice bath and stir till cooled down. Add the tea mixture to a cup of ice and add a splash of your choice of milk. Take a taste and if not sweet enough then just add more vanilla syrup. Very simple but so yummy. If making it hot then top it off with some steamed milk.\n\nOur store unfortunately didn\u2019t have a blender so I don\u2019t have any frappe recipes, sorry! I truly hope this helps a few of you out :)\n\nEnjoy, and don\u2019t be afraid to lightly experiment with different flavor/brand combinations!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/pgzej7/i_was_a_coffee_barista_for_4_years_here_are_our/", "created_utc": 1630649495.0, "score": 4020, "author": "shipping_addict", "num_comments": 154, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/pgzej7/i_was_a_coffee_barista_for_4_years_here_are_our/", "html_title": ""}

What really struck me was the outpouring of gratitude from millions of people who read his co-authored book. \n\nThis book really surprised me when I read it. This book correctly identifies millionaires as being cheapskates, not the overspending stereotypes we are used to hearing about. It talks about how high income earners can go broke by overspending, and how those with modest incomes can achieve millionaire status by being frugal. \n\n\u201cThe Millionaire Next Door\u201d should be required reading in school. I know it sounds like this book does not belong in /r/frugal, but I think that the themes inside it really should resonate in this subreddit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/5c5nqx/the_millionaire_next_door_is_probably_the_best/", "created_utc": 1478747979.0, "score": 3813, "author": "lifecharger", "num_comments": 481, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/5c5nqx/the_millionaire_next_door_is_probably_the_best/", "html_title": ""}

We are working on building trust and teaching skills for all of the kids.\n\nI woke up this morning to find a bunch of messages, because the post had been added to the bestofredditorupdates.  I am so thankful for all of you supporting our effort to be a safe place in a scary world for this teenager.\n\n\n\nOriginal post: A few months ago, I asked for frugal meal ideas to help us stretch our family's budget to incorporate an extra teenager.  You all were amazing in not only giving ideas but many of you sent items from a wish list that helped us meet immediate needs.  We were able to make sure the teen had the toiletry items, clothing that fit and were weather appropriate and have simple meals and snacks available.\n\nIn the past few months, our bonus teen has been spending a lot of time at our house with our teens and they all have been learning simple life skills like doing their own laundry, budgeting, and cooking.  The newest request from all of our teens is to learn baking.  I have seen the anxiety lessen throughout the months.\n\nI wanted to update and let you all know what an important role you have played in this young teenager's life, as well as my family.  Thank you for opening your hearts and helping.  We hope to be able to stay in this teenager's life for years to come and to continue to provide support, in whatever they need.\n\nEditing to answer questions asked in messages:\n\n1. The snacks and meals lasted for more than 3 months, plus we still have a few things left.\n2. The toiletry items have helped a lot in our bonus teen\u2019s self-confidence.\n3.

{"title": "Save TONS of money when selling/buying a home (advice from a former real estate agent).", "selftext": "*Edit: This got way bigger than I thought it would and I'm worried that people are going to put a lot of stock in what I wrote, so if you're consulting this at some point in the future as an official guide to how to buy real estate from an industry veteran, I feel I should mention that I do not consider myself anything close to a real estate expert. The point of this post is really not to tell you the best way to buy or sell a home. What I intended to do was show people that the internet has changed buying and selling real estate and the old model deserves some scrutiny. It's up to you to decide what's right for you and to research your options because there are now more options than ever for buying/selling. Read the comments, read the replies, read everything you can about real estate and talk to other people you trust. Buying and selling a home is a HUGE undertaking. Don't just mindlessly hire an agent because you think that the fact that they have a license makes them valuable. It doesn't. Equally important, don't mindlessly follow my advice below thinking that you'll definitely save money. You might not. There is risk in everything. Just be sure that whatever you choose, you take control. Don't let agents bully you or scare you into thinking they are the only option. Also, I just had an interesting thought. If you're a curious type and have some spare time. You could take the same real estate courses that agents take from your local association for around $500 or so. Even if you get an agent, it could be money and time worth spending. Plus the classes are interesting if you like that sort of thing!*\n\nI started writing some of these points in a different thread and realized that many of you frugal folks might appreciate some tips to save THOUSANDS of dollars when selling or buying a home. I used to sell real estate before the bubble burst and I went broke but I did it just long enough to realize the traditional real estate agent model is set up in a way that really doesn't always benefit consumers. I honestly thought that the old school model of an agent listing a home for 6% commission would completely shift when the internet started becoming more sophisticated in that industry. While that has happened to some degree, the Realtor's association is very strong and I think most people are still unaware that you don't have to hire someone at 6% commission to sell your home and you don't really need to hire a buyer's agent either. In fact, the benefits of hiring one are usually negligible at best and actually often worse than the alternative. In almost all cases there are specialists (attorneys, photographers, appraisers, inspectors etc.) that you can hire who will do a better job for way less money. And while it may seem as though managing all of that by yourself might be difficult or time consuming I would argue that with the tools available to us through the internet it's comparable to hiring an agent on both counts. As with most things, there are plenty of exceptions where my advice doesn't apply but I think this will be helpful for many people buying/selling a home (even seasoned veterans of home sales and purchases) to understand that there are alternatives besides the old model. Since every circumstance is different, I encourage you to meet with agents and see what they have to offer to determine what's right for you but this should help you with some behind-the-scenes context that agents aren\u2019t likely to mention. With no further ado, I give you my guide to buying and selling a house on the cheap.\n\nSelling your home: \n\n**Why you think you need a seller's agent** - If you're selling your house, you may think the only way to do it is to hire an agent. Maybe you believe the process is too complicated for you or you think that the real estate agent has some sort of magical house-selling power or they can bring a list of buyers that will pay top dollar for your property. You may even think that they can take the pain away from what is typically a very painful process.\n\n**Why you don't** - Unless you have a lot of varied skills and *recent* experience with buying and selling homes already, you will need help. But the real question is whether a seller's agent is worth 5%-6% of your home's value and are there cheaper/better alternatives. As a reminder, 6% comes out to $12,000 on a $200,000 home! Here are some things an agent can actually do for you to earn that 6% commission. Provide advice on pricing and home improvements to get your house ready for sale. Take pictures, write copy and enter all the other relevant data into the local MLS service (basically, fill out a form online). Help lead negotiations when you have a deal on the table. Of all of those benefits, the most important is getting your property listed on the MLS. This is the service that companies like Trulia and Zillow use to populate their websites and is the service that other realtors use as the main database to find properties to show their clients. If you're not on the MLS, you're basically not really for sale. This is something that realtors rely on to keep normal people like us coming to them. But there is a solution to that problem (included in the bullets below). Other than the MLS thing, though, the internet renders most of the realtor\u2019s benefits obsolete. So here\u2019s how to get the above benefits without spending $12,000:\n\n* Pricing advice (Max value; $400) \u2013 There is no true science to pricing a home. Realtors and appraisers will argue that point but real estate is so much more nuanced than a scoring spreadsheet will tell you. Ultimately, it comes down to just knowing your market. Use sites like Trulia to see current properties on the market to evaluate your competition. Then look at properties similar to yours that have sold within the last 3-6 months or so to get an idea of a realistic final selling price. Assuming you\u2019re not delusional and you know your neighborhood, you will get pretty close. Even when people hire agents, the agent often just lists for whatever the seller wants anyway. If you so desire, you can have a professional appraisal done on your property for less than $400, though many agents will offer a free \u201chome valuation\u201d as part of their marketing efforts hoping that you will ultimately list with them. If you\u2019re comfortable having them do this with no intension of hiring them, that\u2019s kind of up to your personal moral code, but it is an option. Many agents will do this for you even if you explicitly tell them you are going to try to sell on your own because they know you may call them if you decide to list with an agent eventually.\n* Home improvement advice (Max value; $0.00) - You could read countless articles on how to prepare a home for sale and follow their advice, which will probably be all you need. An agent will not actually help you prep your house for sale, that\u2019s still on you, so the value here is minimal if anything at all. The most important things in my opinion are to DECLUTTER EVERYTHING and make sure the place is clean. Seriously, before you decide to put $5,000 into a bathroom or landscaping or whatever before you sell your place, consider renting a temporary storage unit and putting everything you don\u2019t absolutely need in there. I\u2019m talking couches, big furniture, stuff jammed in closets. Get rid of it all. \n* Marketing (Max value; $200) \u2013 You will need to have pictures and marketing copy to put your property on the MLS and other real estate websites. Your biggest cost here will be photography. You can find local photographers who focus on real estate who will charge you a completely reasonable rate. Photos are important, so I really don\u2019t recommend doing this on your own unless you really know what you\u2019re doing. Many agents even take photos of their properties themselves and they are terrible. As for copy, never in the history of real estate has excellent copy sold a home. You don\u2019t need to be Keats with your copy. Just the facts. Take a look at a few examples of other descriptions that you like on other homes and just use that same structure for your home. There are other details you\u2019ll need like number of beds/bathrooms etc. but you will already know that and the agent doesn\u2019t add any value there. You may have some additional investment in something like a $10 \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign or maybe something else but the days of agents incurring marketing costs to list your property in the newspaper are long gone yet the commission rate remains the same.\n* Listing on the MLS (Max value; $500) \u2013 This is one area you will need to hire a realtor for but you do not need to pay them 6% or sign a long-term contract with anyone. Look for a local agent or agency who offer flat fee service. For around $500, they will list your property on the local MLS. Once it\u2019s listed there, it will get picked up by all of the major real estate websites and added to their databases automatically. For this, it is important to find a local realtor rather than a faceless online entity because if you need to make changes to your listing for any reason, you will need a human being to be responsive to your needs.\n* Paperwork (Max value; $0-$1,000?) \u2013 Okay, so lots of flat-fee agents will also offer an option to buy standard real estate documents for your state. That\u2019s what you want. I don\u2019t recommend buying them online or trying to cobble together your own homemade contract because you can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s any good. Each state is different and the standard contracts are frequently updated. I recommend you ask your flat-fee agent for any paperwork you will need to list and sell your house. Agencies that specialize in flat-fee service will likely be able to explain each document to you as well to help you with that \u201cI have no idea what I\u2019m looking at\u201d anxiety. Some of the forms can be intimidating but if you take your time with them and familiarize yourself with them before you have to fill them out, it\u2019s really not bad at all. Even if you\u2019re very worried about screwing this part up, you can just hire a real estate attorney to review your documents to make sure they\u2019re in line with what you want. It will be expensive, maybe up to $500/hour, but it will still save you money overall. Plus, an attorney is almost always better than an agent at getting these documents right.\nSo why is the commission so high? At one point, selling a house was a lot more work. Running newspaper ads, marketing houses, attracting buyers was kinda difficult. But the fact is that even back then, only a small portion of that commission ever went to the seller\u2019s agent him/herself. They split any commission they receive with a buyer\u2019s agent (50%) and their broker (usually 50% depending on the agent\u2019s deal with their broker) and they incurred costs along the way. Nowadays, they do not incur similar costs to market your property but the overhead of maintaining a brokerage still exists. Someone needs to cover the cost to keep the place going which includes high costs for attorney retainers and errors & omissions insurance for the agents in case they make a mistake. Since you are not a licensed professional, you do not need E&O insurance and if you want to consult an attorney, you can do so hourly instead of on a retainer.\n* **Total max value of agent's services if you hire individual professionals**: $2,100. Assuming that you are still offering 3% to a buyer's agent, your total max cost would be $8,100 on a $200,000 home. That's a savings of $3,900 over the standard 6% commission model but I honestly think most people will be able to do this for closer to $1,500-$1,700 though.\n\nBuying a home:\n\n**Why you think you need a buyer\u2019s agent:** - You may want a buyer\u2019s agent because you think they are free. After all, the seller\u2019s agent will split his/her commission with your agent, so it\u2019s no money out of your pocket. Or maybe you feel like you need someone to help you find the perfect home, or get you financing or maybe you just want someone to help you through the process. It can be nerve racking!\n\n**Why you don\u2019t:** - Buyer\u2019s agents are not free. Someone has to pay them and the cost always comes from somewhere. If there is no seller\u2019s agent, then you will likely be responsible for paying your agent out of your own pocket (read your agreement!!) If there is a seller\u2019s agent, then they will split their commission with the buyer\u2019s agent. However if there\u2019s a seller\u2019s agent and no buyer\u2019s agent, the seller\u2019s agent will often be willing reduce their commission by 50% and put that toward the home price. So if the seller is offering their agent 6% on a $200,000 house ($12,000), they can ask their agent to reduce the commission to 3% since they won\u2019t have to split it with a buyer\u2019s agent. Then, the seller can reduce their sale price of the home by $6,000 without affecting their out-of-pocket costs and the seller\u2019s agent still gets the 3% they would have gotten if they split it with your buyer\u2019s agent. Basically, you just saved $6,000 plus 30 years of interest on that money. The key here is to negotiate the price to as low as the seller will go, then ask for the agent to cut the commission. Otherwise, you can\u2019t be sure you\u2019re getting the bottom price. So if you want to buy a house without an agent, here\u2019s how to get (most of) the benefits without spending $6,000:\n\n* Find the perfect home (Max value; $0) \u2013 Trulia, Zillow, Realtor.com, whatever. Your agent doesn\u2019t have magical powers. You can find your own property just as easily and you run less of a risk of missing one that you want. You can set up alerts, too. In this case the agent is really only a middleman slowing down the process.\n* Coordinate showings (Max value; $500) \u2013 This is actually a pain in the butt if you\u2019re the type to look at a ton of houses but if you\u2019re smart about it, you can schedule multiple showings on the same day to keep things fairly easy. Like book yourself to look at three houses on Saturday instead of looking at them one at a time. It shouldn\u2019t take too long but if saving yourself a few phone calls to set up showings is worth $6,000 to you, then by all means hire an agent. Or, if you really like the frugal lifestyle while also living like a baller you could just hire a personal assistant online to handle that for you for probably around $30/hour or less. You could set up a TON of showings for well under $500.\n* Neighborhood awareness ($? - You decide value) \u2013 If you\u2019re moving across the country or otherwise unfamiliar with your new town, an agent may be worth the money for peace of mind but you'll need to decide if that's worth $6,000 to you. With the internet, a few hours of research will show you everything you might want to know. Determine what is important to you when finding a location and there's virtually nothing the agent can tell you that the internet won't tell you. Commute times, school districts, tax rates. All of that stuff is online.\n* Financial advice ($0) \u2013 Working with a mortgage broker (A broker is someone who works with multiple banks) or directly with a reputable bank will often provide you better advice than an agent. Most agents will just tell you to talk to the lender anyway. Tell them what you want to do with your home purchase and they will work it out with you.\n* Pricing advice (Max value; $400) \u2013 See explanation above. Also, you have the added benefit here if you are getting a mortgage that the bank will require an appraisal before you can get financed. In other words, it\u2019s nearly impossible to overpay for the home.\n* Answering questions/consulting ($1,000-? - You decide value) \u2013 Of all the reasons to have a buyer\u2019s agent, I think this is the best one. If you haven\u2019t purchased a home before, you will probably have a ton of questions and there is some real benefit to having someone on call that you trust to help you through your anxieties. If you don\u2019t have a friend or family member to do this with you and the prospect of buying a house is overwhelming to you, an agent may be worth the money just to ease your fears. That being said, if you buy a house from a seller with an agent who doesn\u2019t suck, that agent will be able to walk you through your issues too. There are even a lot of agents who would be happy to answer some of your simpler questions even though they won't get paid. Agents are generally a nice bunch of people who legitimately want to help. The only thing is you\u2019ll be on your own until you decide to put an offer in on a property but that\u2019s when you\u2019ll really need help. Up to that point, it\u2019s just arranging showings for the most part. Remember, the seller\u2019s agent wants the process to go as smoothly as you do. They will help you get your financing in order and help you work though all of the issues and questions you may have as you go along. But remember, the sellers agent really want you to buy that particular house so be sure to get a home inspection before you finalize your sale, even if you're buying a brand new house! It generally costs around $300 or so and it's always money well spent. Even if you hire an agent, though, you will still pay for this out of pocket, so you won't save any money here by having an agent. Also, you will want to buy standard home sale contracts for your state if the seller doesn't already have them and if you want to be totally sure your deal is air-tight, you can hire an attorney to review the contract before you submit it to the seller, though I believe that wouldn't be necessary unless there is no seller's agent at all.\n* **Total max value of agent's services if you hire individual professionals**: $1,900. \n\nOkay, I spent way too much time writing that and I\u2019m sure there are things I\u2019m leaving out and things I should have thought through better and other general errors, but I believe this would be a good start for anyone looking to save money buying or selling a home.\n\n*Edit: Okay, this got a lot bigger than I expected but I got tons of feedback and tried to reply to as many of the comments as I could. I encourage you to read through them for varying perspectives. First, it seems that many Realtors want me to clarify that there's a difference between excellent agents and \"bad\" ones. I agree that an excellent agent can be worth the money and may even pay for themselves in some situations but you have to decide what that's worth to you. I would also point out that I was a mediocre agent, not bad, but not great either. I would classify maybe 5% of agents as excellent. After that, there is a huge dropoff in quality (just my opinion from what I saw in my market) to people like me. What I'm telling you is that I believe that the work I did as a mediocre agent could be done by almost anybody else on their own with just a little bit of effort. When it comes to the value proposition, others have mentioned that some agents will list a property for a 4% commission. In that case, just calculate your savings from selling by yourself using similar math that I used above and decide if you think they're worth it. That said, it's been my experience that agents willing to cut their commissions to get listings aren't often the best in the area, so that might be a consideration too.*\n\n*As a final note, many people mentioned the company Redfin, which I hadn't heard of before but it seems pretty great on the surface. I have no experience with them, but it might be worth exploring for you.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/41p707/save_tons_of_money_when_sellingbuying_a_home/", "created_utc": 1453218321.0, "score": 3593, "author": "hulkster69", "num_comments": 440, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/41p707/save_tons_of_money_when_sellingbuying_a_home/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How I reduced my utilities by almost 80% - Attempt #2", "selftext": "Attempt #2 in writing this hopefully it goes through this time :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, so here is how I went on reducing my utilities by almost 80% and this is with starting from a lower base already vs average american house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe live in about 2200 sq ft of house, ranch style. Built in 1958, so lots of leaky. When I first moved in with my now wife, the average usage of utilities was the following:\n\n\\- Electricity 760 kWh/month\n\n\\- Gas (water and heat) - 820 therms annually\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think it's best to keep numbers in consumption than actuall dollars (although I provide those as well), since prices differ around the country and also with time. The average price in my area is about 12 cents per kWh in electricity and 1 dollar give or take per therm of NG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe live in the Northeast and Winters are cold - according to the average our winters are about 6100 Heating Degree Days and it gets hot and humid in summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what I did chronologically:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#1 - First move was to change all light bulbs to CFLs. This was in 2013 so LEDs were still very expensive at around 9-10$ per bulb. Since CFLs don't differ that much from power output from LEDs (maybe like 20%) it never made sense $$ wise to go for LEDs when CFLs were available at 1-2 dollars a pop. Before, the whole power output of light bulbs in the house was around 2000-3000 W... when all bulbs were changed the whole power output in the house sits around at 250-300W ... As an example, TODAY if we have the whole house with the lights on, it would use less energy than before when we had 3-5 lights on in the living room 6 hours a day or so. Cost on new lights = $70\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#2 - I am frugal (hence being here...or at least as my mother tells me I am Spartan. I don't mind paying for things of good quality), therefore the dumb thermostats never echoed with me. In 2013 I bought a NEST. At the time I believe NEST was the only wifi t-stat and while I know I could probably get by with a programmable thermostat, the designs were not that appealing and I liked having the wifi access anyhow. Of course I didn't buy it new. Bought it off of ebay in 2013 for about $95. It's been now almost 6 years, and never had an issue with it. It paid itself in no time. With the Nest I started putting the heat off whenever out of the house or at night (with setbacks in the mid 50s). This itself brought big savings in orders of 30-40% in heat. Cost = $95\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#3 Changing electrical suppliers - PA has a liberal market in the energy market, meaning you can choose who your supplier is from hundredds of suppliers. They website is pretty easy to navigate as well. Just input your zipcode and a lot of offers from different companies pop up. Just organize the list by Lowest Price to Highest and you're golden. You can usually get 20-35% lower prices than what the distribution company provides. These are all usually introductory offers for a limited amount of time (like 3, 6 or 12 months for example) so once that time expires just pop onto the website and go for the lowest offer again and jump to a different company. Been doing this for 4-5 years now and it takes maybe 10 minutes every 6 months. For those of you that use 1,000 or more kWh/month it's definitely worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#4 While renovating and redesigning our living room to open space, we had to put a beam and with this access to attic. While up there and since we had the whole thing torn apart we decided to add insulation. Being the perfectionist that I am, I didn't want to just spray insulation on top of what we had there (4-5 inches of loose fiberglass and some spaces even lacking). Air leaks and cracks, even when insulated on top, leak a lot of air, so I wanted to seal off everything. So, we removed all Fiberglass in trash bags by using a leaf blower in reverse and using flexible air ducts to bring all loose fiberglass downstairs to a big mesh bag. This enabled me to air seal all cracks, top plates and fan cans and light boxes from the attic. We decided to put about 18\" of cellulose on our attic for a total of about R65-R70.\n\nOur local Lowe's sold each bag at 12.95 dollars which is expensive IMO - we needed about 120 bags. A local store also had bags at about 8 dollars per bag if buying 100 of them, but Lowes had the FREE machine to spray the insulation which we needed. So I played the price match game with Lowes, where they priced matched it to 7,20 per bag and I also used they 50 off of 250 coupons in order to bring the price lower. Not only that, buying Lowes gift cards at 10-15% discount from 3rd party gift card markets brought it even lower, along with cashback portals. In the end we paid for each bag about $4,90/bag !! Also, our electrical supplier had and still has lots of rebates going for insulation improvements (it's always worth checking it out. I received an extra $130 from the electrical provider, but if my heat were to be electric as well, they would cover 80% of the cost up to 450 dollars, while in my case it was only 25% of the cost up to $130.\n\nTotal cost = $400\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#5 Fridge - we had an old fridge that came with the house when we bought it. I knew it was old from the start but not as old as I ended up finding. Great machine! Cooled things like no other fridge did and probably will outlast any of the new ones, but I digress. The fridge was built in either 1983 or 1992 judging from the serial number and a little bit of Google. I would honestly say it is a 1983. However that thing used about 3 kWh/day. It never made much sense to just buy a new one just for the sake of it, but we had it in the plans to buy one that would go with our renovation. And we did exactly that recently. We bought a nice European fridge from a warehouse at a steep discount and sold the other one on Craigslist for $230 dollars. In the end, the NET cost of the new fridge was $450. Best thing though, the new fridge only uses about 0.2-0.4 kWh per day !!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here's how much we used to spend on utilities before all this:\n\n\\- Old spending $2200/year give or take\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all the improvements we are now using only 190-200 kWh/month and this includes using dryer, landscape lights (LED of course) and cooking (we cook everyday) and having computer 24/7. Heat wise, this year we have only spent 200 therms of gas during an average winter of 6000 HDDs. Better yet, we don't have aggressive setbacks anymore. We keep the house always at 60F when sleeping or away, and around 68F when at home, so in essence we even increase indoor temps and the savings were that big!\n\nAlso, during the summer, while before the house used to get hot pretty quick, we can usually get by a full day without AC unless it's a heat wave of several days or the temps at night don't drop enough where opening windows and using fan would bring the temperatures lower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe new spending is therefore $750/year (already confirmed throguh the last 12 months). Consumption decrease almost 80% and spending almost 70%. There isn't much more we can save now. The only way, would be instead of having gas heat, change it to electricity through European multi-splits system, where we wouldn't need ducts and by being electricity we could drop the gas contract (which the customer charge is $17/month). The mini-split system would give both AC and Heat and since most of them have COP of 4 or higher it would end up being cheaper to use than NG (not by much though). But both our furnace and AC are pretty new - put in by prevous owner - installed around 2010 or so according to manufacture date of systems on their labels. Another way to save would be having a on-demand water heat but since ours is still pretty new it doesn't make sense to change as of now just to save some pennies. The same goes for windows (our windows while they are double pane they are crap) which would cost a lot just to save a couple dollars. Same for wall insulation - I'd love to insulate my walls - but when running the numbers and hassle of insulating the walls (which our house is lacking I am sure) it doesn't make sense. Our highest electric bill is about 40ish dollars in the summer and highest gas bill was 50 dollars back in Jan/February (coldest months)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3nw8u85bd131.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8c5786be735e757f9c6789120bf46efc5f68d1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd by these improvements instead of 3 tons of AC size, next time we need a new AC system, we can go by with only 1ton or 1.5 tons max which is crazy. And for all environmentalists out there, we are saving the planet 10 Metric tons (22,000 lbs) of CO2 emissions on a yearly basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo all this to say, that you dont need a lot of money to get big returns! For about $1000 (and this includes a new fridge) and a lot of DIY work and being smart on how you buy your materials, you can save a lot and increase the comfort of your home. It pays to check for rebates as well! And you don't need to have good wall insulation for the most part, most of the returns come from insulating the heck out of your attic! And you can totally use HDDs and current usage and estimate the savings before hand to see if it's worth it. I did mine and my estimates weren't that far off from what ended up being in reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this post will be of help to someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Woow guys.

{"title": "Husband spends 1/3 of our money on comic books", "selftext": "I often share advice here, but today it's me coming to you for perspective.\n\nMarried less than a year, and we don't have money troubles. I feel like this is more about ... Fairness? Common goals? Letting go of the past/sunk cost? For reference, were both about 40 y.o.\n\nI track spending pretty closely, though it's not like I reign in certain categories per se. More, I track it for knowledge. Husband says he's happy to let me do all the financial planning, since I'm so good at it. He's said he wants me to help us reach our discussed common goals and be secure. The last thing I want is to be a new wife who says he can't go to Cons or hang out at the board game store and play tournaments or whatever. But there's this comic thing he has. We're paying $100/month for a climate-controlled storage closet to store these. He spends about 1/3 of our disposable income per month on them. He brings home a few boxes from the comic store, and then the box(es) go unsorted into the storage locker. In the year we've been together, I've never once seen him read a comic book.\n\nHe says he has this vision that once we have a house with more room, he'll sort them and read entire series. I get it. I love reading. But he's spending more than our rent each month on this collection. And when he had a larger place all to himself, he didn't have them sorted then, either.\n\nI love that he's a nerd. I wouldn't have it any other way. If he lives for 80 more years, I can't imagine he'll read half of them, if any. Money could go to debt, or retirement, or joint purchases/goals. Keep in mind, this money he spends on these is in addition to his disposable spending on other things/hobbies. On average, his hobby spending is half the monthly cost of the comics. I mean, I get it. He doesn't buy lots of clothes or shoes or makeup or cigarettes or drugs. But it's not like I can spend an equivalent amount on MY hobbies or interests, because we couldn't afford it.\n\nHow do you talk to someone who's self identity is almost tied up in these that it's ok to not finish collecting the entire series for each of these? How do you talk about how he's not betraying that 13-y.o. version of himself that found his only solace in comics? How can I explain how out of proportion the spending is to other things? \n\nIf the bills are paid on time, and the CC balances aren't going up, he emotionally sees no reason to not spend like this. \n\nI'm here to listen. I'm here to get other perspectives. We've never fought about this, and I doubt we ever will. But I wanted to have another conversation with him, and I was hoping to come to it with some fresh insight and ways I can compromise.\n\nEdit: some clarifications (1) I earn half the family income (2) I should have technically said \"discretionary\" spending, which is different than disposable (3) He spends on average 50% of the discretionary spending on his hobbies (2/3 of which is this comics collection), leaving 25% for \"us\" things like vacations and gifts, etc, and 25% my hobbies/personal spending.\n\nThank you everyone for all the insights and ideas. I appreciate it immensely.\n\nXpost to r/hoarding https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/dc9hgf/xpost_from_frugal_husband_spends_13_of_our", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/dbvqal/husband_spends_13_of_our_money_on_comic_books/", "created_utc": 1569946724.0, "score": 3524, "author": "AmNotLost", "num_comments": 802, "permalink": "/r/Frugal/comments/dbvqal/husband_spends_13_of_our_money_on_comic_books/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Some thoughts on weddings, from someone who's been to over 40 of them.", "selftext": "So for a bit of background, I'm a wedding photographer. Including weddings I've attended I've been to 40, maybe nearer 50 weddings. I've seen the best and the worst.\n\nOne of the things I've noticed is that there is really no correlation between cost spent and the \"quality\" or enjoyment of the wedding. The best wedding I ever shot was a 400+ person, fairly boujee wedding. The couple was amazing, though, incredibly genuine, and had great family. I teared up during their dance.\n\nThe second best wedding I shot was about 60 people. The bride had a hookup on a nice small venue that she and her sister decorated themselves with homemade centerpieces made from lavender and other less expensive plants, they rented speakers and hooked up a laptop with a spotify playlist their friends curated together, they got food catered and aunties made desserts. This wedding was a r/frugal pipe dream guys.\n\nBut it was awesome, because the bride and groom were so into it and genuine, they have great friends, they partied, and families were sweet. \n\nSo after being to so many weddings and seeing cookie cutter stuff, unique, cheap, expensive, my thoughts really are that regardless of what you spend, how big it is, what the venue looks like, the best weddings are between two people who care about each other and just want to celebrate one another and their family. That's it. Everything else is extra. \n\nI realize I'm preaching to the choir on this sub, but who knows who needs to hear it.\n\nMore specifically, here are some things I think are and aren't worth it, assuming you've set a budget and are having a wedding-wedding.\n\nWorth it:\n\n* A decent photographer, if you want one at all. I realize phones are so good now and some people are cool with just asking family to take photos, but if you do want a photographer get someone solid. It doesn't have to be a $10,000 luxury photog who sends you a leather bound book, but if you're going to pay your 15 year old artist niece or nephew $200 to do it, just stick with the phones.\n\n* Tailoring for a suit. You don't have to spend a lot nowadays to get a suit that fits. Assuming you're going traditional, spend enough to get a plain black suit that's tailored to you and fits well. Fit is so much more important than the materials themselves. Keeping it simple means you can wear that suit for any other occasion that requires it. Also, if you're buying more affordable shoes, consider an in-sole because you'll be standing all day.\n\n* Gifts for your groomsmen/bridesmaids. They don't have to be anything fancy at all, but I do think it's really sweet and a nice start to the day. This is totally my personal opinion though.\n\n* Good food. Again, you don't have to spend a ton (I've had people get food trucks for weddings, costs $20-40 a head and some of them are *bomb*). But low quality food can be a big damper on the day. \n\n* Desserts in some form (homemade is great if you have the ability) and some fun late night food. Some pizzas or something late at a wedding while people are drunk dancing is always a hit.\n\n* EDIT: A lot of comments about day-of planners with positive reviews. Apparently worth it!\n\nNow, a few things that are less worth it if you're trying to stick to a budget, imo:\n\n* A videographer. I promise I'm not biased here - high quality video work that you'll actually want to watch again can be so expensive, and how often will you really watch it vs wedding photos you can put up on a wall? If you really want some recordings, this is a good time to ask Uncle Darren to put his DSLR up on a tripod at the back of the venue during your ceremony. Your friends will probably take videos of the night festivities.\n\n* Fancy dresses, shoes, suits. Everyone is different on this but the fit of your clothes, your smile, your compatibility matter so much more. No one will see your fancy shoes with a huge dress anyway. \n\n* Open bar. A lot of people are doing toonie bars (I'm Canadian :) ) which I think is super cool. Charging $7 for a beer is super lame as if you're trying to make money, but $2 for a beer is just covering your cost so your wild cousin Tina doesn't dry up your bank account.\n\n* Crazy decorations. It's such a short period of time, and people will be drunk before too long. Keep it classy and simple. \n\n* A wedding planner shouldn't be necessary if you're keeping it small and are relatively organized. \n\n* Crazy cakes. You're gonna chop it up. Towers of cupcakes or donuts are very common nowadays and are awesome. Get cheap toppers from a party store and you're in business.\n\n* A DJ. They can get so pricey nowadays. Bands, imo, are worth it if they're in your budget because it's such a fun experience, but DJs less-so in my opinion. Find a trustworthy family member or two to emcee and load up a Spotify playlist with your friend. Speakers and DJ lights can be rented locally in most cities. \n\n\nThat's all I've got. This ran way longer than I anticipated but I hope someone can get some use out of it. Feel free to ask about any elements of the day you're wondering about, or what else may or may not be worth it.

{"title": "Wife and I vacationed 8 days in Ireland for $2,500 (air fare included). And we could have spent less!", "selftext": "I took a shot at planning our first overseas vacation rather than booking through a company. If you're looking to save money, and still do a lot of stuff this is the way to go. First, I'll give you a break down of the costs then discuss each thing.\n\nTo be clear, we did not skimp on experiences. We went to five different cities on the Eastern, Southern, and Western coast of Ireland. We went to 6 different castles, we went to the Cliffs of Moher, traveled to the Wicklow Mountains, St Kevin's cathedral and the Glendalough. It was quite an adventure for the money. \n\nAir fare - $1200\nNightly accommodations (8 nights) - $580\nCar rental (4 days) - $160\nFood/Snacks/Beer - $300\nPublic transportation - $120\nShopping/tours/sight seeing - $200\n\nAir fare: $600 per ticket seems low, but we found several flights to Dublin for under $400. In fact, I recently booked tickets to Dublin for a guys trip in September for $325 out of Boston. Patience and Google Flights are key. If you're interested to know more let me know but there are a lot better resources on flying cheap than me. \n\nNightly accommodations: This could have been a lot lower, but we booked four different bed & breakfasts around Ireland.  We booked 2 nights at a hotel and stayed one night in a hostel. The key for us was booking places that served breakfast. Yes, I ate traditional Irish breakfast every single day. \n\nCar rental: We took public transportation for 4 days and rented a car for 4 days. Booking in advance is your friend. If you book 2+ months out, we were seeing $30 a day everywhere. \n\nFood/snacks/beer: $300 seems low, but remember we ate breakfast at the hotel. For lunch, we usually popped into a grocery store and picked up chips/sandwhich/drink combo for $4. We had a nice dinner out 4 out of the 7 nights we were there and just got pizza or fast food other 3 nights. After we rented a car we picked up $30 in snacks which held us over for in between meals rest of the trip. My wife doesn't drink and all, and beer was so expensive I took it kind of easy on the sauce. \n\nPublic transportation: Ireland's public transport is fire. For $20 each you can get a 72 hour unlimited pass for Dublin which let's you take trains and busses. We took the train to a suburb on the Eastern coast called Howth. It was a beautiful little harbor town. We took public busses from Kilkenny to Waterford, Waterford to Cork and Galway to Dublin. Total cost for all that mentioned was only $120. Students in Ireland get free public transportation. \n\nShopping tours sightseeing: Ireland allows you to buy something called a Heritage card, which is good for a year. Allows you to see 80+ attractions in Ireland. They're about $50 each. Entry to most of the sites are north of $15 so well worth it. Also most museums are free in Ireland. As mentioned wife and I did several castles and tours with the heritage card. And they're not stupid places either, these sites are some of the best Ireland had to offer. \n\nI decided to post this because we've been married 16 years and always assumed overseas travel was cost prohibitive. And I'd like to let others know it's not!
