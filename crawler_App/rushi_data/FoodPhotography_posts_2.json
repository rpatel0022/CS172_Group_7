Usually I started with a couple of clients but was getting recommendations (I still do todays). Generally what I've seen is you gotta pitch the sale in person. People sometimes need this 'human touch' in order to make a decision and being there explaining your passion helps them to feel comfortable.\n\nThere's this one time I cold called some IG accounts and after 5 years I still have one of those clients.", "Wanted to follow up and say I went out and pitched in person yesterday. Dressed up. Grabbed a few business cards. Grabbed my tablet preloaded with my portfolio.\n\nI was super nervous, drove around for a bit to work out the jitters, picked a low-stakes place first that I didn't have my heart set on. Then a place where I knew the people somewhat and knew they were friendly (jewelry store where my wife and I recently purchased from for our wedding) and not in my niche. By then I was in full swing. I went to two walkable areas of town with a lot of successful restaurants (that are likely to have a marketing budget / need) and ended up hitting about 13-14 places in about 3.5 hours (\\~2pm to 5:30pm on a Saturday).\n\nEveryone was nice. Most hostesses weren't trying to gatekeep. I told them I was a local food photographer and I just wanted to make an introduction with a manager / owner. Half the time they'd go grab them, the other half they'd say the person was busy. Either way I left with a business card and left mine with them. I'd email them when I got back to the car saying \"Thanks for taking the time, blah blah, here's my portfolio.\"\n\nAt the end of the trip, I'd walked away with 3 very interested candidates, a few maybes, and the rest I at least left a good impression on the hostesses for the next time I make my rounds.\n\nNotes for next time would be as follows:\n\n\\* Consider ditching the tablet and replacing with quality 2-sided flyers with my name, logo, work samples, info, and maybe a first-session pricing deal. I feel like a business card is too easy to trash or overlook even though I have some pretty nice ones from Moo.\n\n\\* Start a spreadsheet with the following: Business Name, Person Spoken To / Role, Owner, Date, Time, Notes About Visit, General Vibe (positive, negative, neutral), Best Way to Contact (after asking the person there). I was bad about remembering the staff members' names after I walked out the door.\n\n\\* Dress down a little bit, but not too much. I went in with a band collar button-down, gray pleated slacks, belt, Chelsea boots. I could probably get away with nicer jeans or chinos. I think I came across as too salesy at first - especially with the tablet. Looked more like a liquor rep than a photographer.\n\n\\* Have some pricing and packages ready. I was asked about average pricing and I told them $300/hr with most sessions being 1.5-2 hours or $500 with \\~10 deliverables in 2 weeks. I was asked about social media management (I have an agency background in this, so I'm happy to do it, but didn't have a price or guesstimate on my mind). Also, I'd like to have options for continued clients. Something I'm going to offer is a discount on the first shoot if they book within 7 days and a discount on the second shoot if they leave a solid Google review (kind of invaluable right now as I have none). I'd be open to referrals landing a discount as well for any future shoots.\n\n\\* Slow it down and order a drink at the bar of some of these places (obviously limit yourself) if they have one. Become a patron. I can't afford nor do I have the time to be eating at all of these and hoping that a manager comes in, but most had a bar I could've had half a beer at. Tip well. Consider it a business expense. This one must be done in moderation and it also eats into schedule and could get you smelling or feeling boozy. If I had the availability to be pitching every day I would do this much more often, but I'm only free on weekends.\n\nI'm sure I'll keep coming up with notes and thoughts after my next journey out, but I think it was pretty successful. Hope this helps you or someone else!  \n\nI'd also say this was a HUGE confidence boost for me - I got some really nice compliments on my work and it was amazing to actually KNOW that I was able to get in front of people. I'd rather have a host/hostess tell me that the manager or owner is out or busy or even get a flat out \"No\" (which I didn't) than shoot off an unread DM or an email that I have know way of knowing who opened it or didn't or if it went to spam, etc. I think I made more progress in 4 hours of walk-ins than 4 months of reaching out digitally.", "Shot details are required with your image posts in the title or as a top level comment.

And, even if it's no or not right now that's a good thing because a yes is around the corner.  It's really a numbers game in cold outreach. You have to make sure you are reaching out the right people (creative directors, brand director, etc.) as well.\n\nYou've probably already done this, but asking for referrals when you have a happy client is really helpful. The reality is that you probably can't rely on one method."]}

Only feedback would be to frame the bottom of the glass further down, which would let the shadow light bleed out of frame and get more of the height of the splash. Second shot feedback: such a lonely drink with that much space, needs more specular highlights on the rim/garnish. For both, try playing around with the shadow direction as well, I personally like the shadow to face away from me (like in the 2pm direction) as it feels like someone else's drink with the shadow coming towards me at the 7pm direction.", "the 2nd shot is great! I like the staging. The shadow falls left while the herb is opposite. I agree with another comment that the berries are very staged. I think they would look better in the foregound and I actually lose depth when they behind and above the drink. Great splash shots also! The light is very white, I'm not sure the setting, the tone, or if it's alcoholic.", "These are good for getting started, but there are some places you can refine your work.\n\nThe splash shots are nice, but they could be cleaned up a bit. There is a bit more motion blur in some areas than I care for, and you probably want to try and avoid it if you can. You're also losing a lot of the droplets to a shallow depth of field - if you can't stop down any more, remove them in post. Most of the splash shots I've done are composites of a minimum of 3 shots.\n\nThe rest of the shots need some work on drink styling. The glass isn't nearly full enough: it needs more liquid and ice. Very few cocktail images work with a glass that isn't almost filled to the top. \n\nNot knowing what's in the cocktail, the garnishes look like they were chosen for color and not because they went with the actual drink.  It looks like a stirred and boozy cocktail, but that doesn't make a whole lot of sense with raspberries, thyme, and a lemon wedge. Those garnishes seem like something that would be served with a tall, bubbly, citrusy, and refreshing cocktail, but the drink doesn't look like that. The garnishes may make sense to the drink, but on the surface they feel disjointed. \n\nThe last thing I'll suggest is focus stacking. A shallow depth of field is nice for a lot of things, but you generally want the entire rim of the glass to be sharp. Unless you're shooting really tight on the drink, the downward angle can make for an odd plane of focus if you're not stopping down or stacking.", "Very cool!", "I like the splash and the base light, with some more art direction you get a great pic", "My feedback is related to the food styling, work on using the Golden Ratio when placing accents.

Where did you get this kind of backdrop? Thank you.", "I imagine the look you\u2019re going for is one of a tasty drink that you can make.  While the splash photos look interesting, seeing this in a food photography context is strange.  Obviously this is my personal thought process, but I feel like half of that drink is ending up on the table, which makes me feel like I just wasted the drink I just made and created a mess I have to clean up.  I do enjoy the third photo with the garnishes but feel you could make the raspberries feel less staged and maybe break up the contour of the glass resting on the table with them.  The warmer tones of the photo make me think that this is a summer drink, so maybe add a little condensation to the glass."]}

For example, when shooting Pizza Hut commercials a few years ago we had an excessive amount of cheese used to get that perfect shot when the slice is separated from the main pizza. Another thing you can do is mix water with vegetable glycerin into a spray bottle and spray it onto the food to make it look moist and fresh.

Awesome work! Good luck!", "Like other said, great color and lighting but doesn't do the food any justice. Needs to look warm, gooey, and soft. Also the plate is way too large to show any of those things. You got to get up in there with a macro lens to show all of the cinnamon richness. I do like the single light look tough. Nice continuity.

Did you add a vignette? Throwing some more light in behind would improve this. For food images, always err on the side of too bright rather than too dark.\n\n\\- The title explains that this is an avocado-based dish. That's not at all obvious from the image itself, and if you think that's an important element (I would say that it is, it's quite unusual to have a chocolate dessert made from avocado!) then I would add an avocado flavour cue somewhere in the image. Discarded / scooped avocado shells with a dirty spoon? Just a small cluster of avocados on the edge of the frame?\n\n\\- Following the two points above would probably negate this, but I feel there seems to be something lacking from the composition - a third element.

A very summery vibe. \n\nA few thoughts, if you'll allow me:\n\n- not sure if the wooden background that you chose really complements your tart, as its light grey colour doesn't bring a lot of contrast with the beiges, whites, and light pastel colours of your plate... Maybe a darker cloth underneath the pie or a dark plate would help bring it out a bit more?\n\n\n- about the two front-facing shots, either open your field of view a little bit or a lot. Having the foreground of the pie blurry is not a good point. Photographers love the shallow depth of field, but in food photography it needs to be carefully applied.\n\n\n- about the top shot, maybe bring the brightness down a bit, it seems that the left side of the white mousse drops are a liiiittle bit overexposed. \n\n\n- I'm nitpicking here, but styling wise you have more passion fruit drops on the lower right part of the pie, and more yellow (mango?) mousse on the upper left side of the pie, so it's a bit unbalanced colour wise. But I'm really nitpicking here.\n\nVery nice shots, very yummy-looking product.\n\nKeep on posting here!", "I really like the shots. Nice and clean. I would suggest something a bit warmer for the tabletop - for example, you could still use that white washed wood, but I would have looked for something with a warmer wood color in the dark tones to match better with the base of the ganache. The grey and brown clash just a bit. How do you like that vinyl tabletop? I just ordered about 20 of them from China. I figured for the cost, why not? I have a bunch of tabletops that I built, and use on shoots, but I think the vinyl might give me more options if they shoot well."]}

Especially with the graham cracker so the limes feel forced.", "This is a great first attempt. I'm going to give you a critique as I would if you were working in my studio, and learning. A few things need to be addressed. 1) The limes conflict with the creaminess of ice cream. It's visually juxtaposed to ice cream. I understand the ice cream is key lime, but it doesn't work. You could have found another way of introducing green into the shot. 2) The ice cream is not the hero in this shot, mostly because the glass is too large, so it covers the majority of the ice cream. You could help this with 1 of 2 things. First, you could raise the level of the camera, so you're shooting a higher angle, which would make the ice cream more prominent, and the stem of the glass shorter. It would have compressed the shot a bit, so it's all together rather than top of image/bottom of image. Second, use a glass that's less prominent, and has much lower sides on the bowl. Those scoops should be standing proud of the glass as much as possible. Any ice cream company is going to want to see the product more than anything else. The other thing you could have done with the limes is to cut them into slices, or wedges, so their weight was far less than the ice cream. When I look at the image my eyes go down to the limes, rather than up to the ice cream. It needs to do exactly the opposite. I'd also suggest having the graham cracker with a bit more angle rather than flat to the scene., and probably the opposite side, which would have helped with balance between the top of the image and the bottom. /u/Mother_Blueberry9618  also had the right idea about a spoon. The spoon connects the viewer to the image. In their mind that spoon is there for them to grab and eat that ice cream. It doesn't have to be in the ice cream, but it would help if it were in the scene.", "Ok, but what an I supposed to do with those limes??", "90mm, f/7.1, 1/160. Lit by an on-camera flash bounced off my metal fridge.

If you are looking for comments: my two cents would suggest a few things you might try next time \ud83e\udd69 see if you prefer placing the steak in the middle of the plate with green sauce behind it or in front with the fries behind, or even take it off the plate and put it on the table, and ideally the sauce a bit out of focus so the eye is definitely drawn directly to the steak. I like the glistening surface of the steak, suggesting it is nice and juicy, I would like to see the butter on top look like it is melting, because hot and juicy is even better. \ud83e\udd69 There is a lot of empty table in the middle which is not contributing much, you might try a smaller table or closing this gap with camera technique or resetting the table. On thee far side are two other entr\u00e9es both almost completely visible. This does give the context that we\u2019re in a restaurant with a variety of dishes. So I think you must decide if this is a shot about the restaurant or is it about the steak. From your title I\u2019m going to assume the shot is about the steak, so in that case I\u2019d consider removing the burger like meat dish or de-emphasize it. The other green dish, if kept to the edge, like it is, and out of focus, provides a touch of color and suggests complementary food choices. The wine glass might be given a role to play, put three oz of red wide in it with perhaps a little back light and it can suggest an array of flavors, a certain up scale atmosphere, and provide a touch of color, again, just keep it secondary as not to take away from the steak. \ud83e\udd69 Finally, the steak is very flat on the plate, you might try placing some French fries under part of the steak elevating it and angling it toward the camera, really emphasizing the steak as the star of the shot.", "Shot details are required with your image posts. \n\nIf your post is a question and not an image you must use the weekly Q&A thread.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And it just made me hungry. And I think food photography is suppose to achieve that.\nI'm not a pro at photography. It's only just my hobby. But I do take it seriously. So anything I suggest or comment isn't meant to be taken as critism but rather just helpful(maybe) and constructive feedback. \n\nAnyways, the photo looks amazing. The composition is great and that plant and table cloth position is just the best. I don't think they can be placed any better.\nBut maybe tone down the highlights on the noodles alone. It looks like the exposure on the noodles isn't correct. Just a smudge above what I would like. Apart from the noodles not being proper I think the overall photo has turned out amazing. \n\nBTW, It looks like you shot jpg and edited that. When editing editing jpg this sort of increase in highlights or overexposure to certain parts happen. I may be wrong (probably am). If so, try using raw only. It'll help out a ton."]}

It will help you a lot to find the right position.", "I think it would be a good idea to completely strip it back so before you start adding props, and before you've nailed the lighting and the way the macarons are positioned. I would also think about setting up proper backdrops and always be self analysing as you go - why do you pick that background, why did you pick that plate, why have you chosen that lighting, etc etc. I hope this helps :)"]}

I would also position the camera in a way the light is more from the back, but that's a taste thing. The shadow creates a horizontal line in the frame which creates a border between the bottom side and the top. With the flash higher up and more from behind, the shadow becomes shorter and creates a diagonal line, which will be either less distracting or will even lead the eye towards the can. \n\nWere you trying to simulate the sun hitting through a window? Because of the size of the lightsource, (the flash) the light is much harsher than regular sunlight. The sun is a huuuuuuge lightsource a very long distance away, which creates that nice even lighting we associate with natural sunlight when it diffracts through a window. Positioning a diffuser or a thin white cloth like a pillowcase about 50-70 cm from the flash will soften that light right up, if it's too soft for your liking you can move the diffuser closer to the flash until it gets exactly as hard as you want. \n\nAnother lighting tip, use a bigger bounce surface, like 60\u00d790. That'll give you those nice big white reflections from the top of the can to the bottom. \n\nAs another user said, create condensation. A hair spray bottle is good.

Go heavier on the syrup pour and try to capture just that perfect \"syrup hitting the front edge of the stack and flowing down\" moment. It may take a few takes to get just right.\n* Overall, shot 4 seems underexposed as compared to the previous 3 shots.\n* Shots 3 and 4 feel lacking as compared to shots 1 and 2 because they lack motion. Consider making them a little more dynamic by adding a touch of motion in post. Just add a 5%-10% scale shift over the length of the shot.\n\nAnd some food/styling thoughts:\n\n* Video is less forgiving than stills, so pick your props carefully. The strawberries have pretty rough foliage. If you can't find A+ greens, consider removing them.\n* There's a continuity error - the first shot is the only one that has whipped cream. If only one shot has whipped cream and mint, it should be the final shot.\n* On the whipped cream note, best not to get berry juice all over the whipped cream, it kills the clean white look.\n* You'll want to be careful with the macerated berries, you can tell there's a little bit of splash on the rim of the plate. They're also running quite a bit down the stack, which isn't a super good look! Consider making your berry syrup thicker, or draining your berries beforehand.\n\nI'm just nitpicking though because I do this for a living and you asked for suggestions - this is a great first effort!", "Music!

I am a photography hobbyist and a chef, so I hope my perspective is helpful! Here are my thoughts, I'll try to work from the most meta thoughts to the most detailed since the narrower the details get, the more subjective they seem to be:\n\n1. The lighting is a little dull. I think part of it is the background and the mat is a little bit of a color sink. The nuance you've created with the dried flowers, the ceramics, and the cinnamon stick is really quite nice and should be the main focus of the picture. Your instincts with those shades are spot on, so everything else should serve to really make those colors and interactions pop.\n2. I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking at. Like, what is in the ramekin? Does it have something to do with the pumpkins in the background? I make a panna cotta with simple berry flavors, vanilla, and a touch of greek yogurt. I really try to find a way to generate and maintain a representation of the process, ingredients, and the \"feel\" of the very first bite of my food in pictures. For example, when I shoot my panna cotta, I like to focus on soft berry tones, some streaks of dark brown (oftentimes just a few vanilla beans), and try to get a clean spoon in the shot.\n3. Personally, I like your choice of colors with the flowers quite a bit. I would like to see more interactions of those shades, some warm browns, and whites in the background.", "This shows some nice potential for a first photo, congrats! Here's to many more.\n\nAs far as suggestions, I agree with what others have said but will re-emphasize one point, it's not clear what the food is or the story is.  This angle and the high-sided ramekin and the garnishes make it unclear what the dish is. Does it have orange and pumpkin and cinnamon and edible flowers all in it? It sorta seems like at least one of those things might be added just to embellish, but while it might visually take up space, it's subtracting from the photo but making it's message less clear."]}

Someone mentioned the spoon being to eye-catching because of the hotspot, but I didn't think so.\n\nMy two cents (and two comments) are :\n\n1. the shadows are going from right to left, which draws my eyes to more things on the left since the shadows/reflections of the honey jar and flowers is there and create visual contrast. This brings my eyes naturally to the upper left and not the madelines, oh no! But I think that can be somewhat helped by cropping some of the left side out.\n\n2. Because of the comment above, for me the most \"observed\" part of the image are the middle-left, and upper portion. However, I do see a very strong leading line [as show here](https://imgur.com/a/Wi5wmOS). With cropping, or if you have the luxury of reshooting, I think you can utilize this lead line to help bring attention to the madelines in front rather than the blank space in the upper left. I slightly cropped the left and showed how just a little bit more alignment brings a lot more attention to the madelines."]}

They look very 'social media'. Which is to say, not very polished. That's totally fine, if social media is indeed the application these images will be used for.\n\nHowever, if you wanted to polish these a bit, I would suggest the following.\n\n\\- The light is quite flat, I would use a bit less fill, and try to make the background either lighter or darker than everything else. In image one, the milk clashes with the background and the result is that it all looks a bit washed-out. Image two is a little better.\n\n\\- If the product packaging is important, you might want to give it a bit more focus, and not hide the jar behind the cookies. It's difficult to read the label, even the logo. It's also not straight.\n\n\\- The 'flow' of the sauce is a little gloopy and thick. Perhaps you could mix it with a little water to make it a little less viscous. A better flow would look more appetising, and would allow the sauce to pile up a little better on the cookies, and maybe even flow down the sides, which would look very nice.\n\n\\- The cookies look great in the first picture, but the cookies in the second picture look like they've been bought from a store. Why did you use different cookies?\n\n\\- The hand in the second image looks awkward - the way it's gripping the jug, and also the way it's cropped kind of half-way. Always pay attention to how the hand looks and try to get it looking nice. If you're using a small jug like that, just grip it by the body. Two fingers one side, one thumb on the other - like in the first image.\n\n\\- Lastly, just pay a bit more attention to the way everything is composed within the shot, so you're not overlapping things in a strange way. Something about the way the jug is placed in front of the milk bottle in image two is a little weird looking. You just need to experiment with different arrangements and make little tweaks until it looks 'right'. Along the same lines, in image one, everything is kind of bunched up towards the left hand side of the image. Spread things out so they're not bunched so much. Remember you can always shoot wider and crop down.", "What are you trying to showcase? Cookies or the sauce?  I believe I know the answer but think about it"]}

They seem like they\u2019d be at home in an early 2000s issue of Weight Watchers Magazine or grocery store coupon book. \n\nThat might just be a matter of personal preference on my part. But revisit some work you admire and consider composition, color, other major themes and try to pick out what appeals to you, then put your own spin on it. Great artists don\u2019t steal but they borrow. \n\nBest of luck! Excited to see you post more photos.", "Former Chef here now foodstylist/photographer. Photos are ok but I think you have some work with basic composition to work on and lighting. Things in bowls rarely look good from profile or the side its a top down kind of thing. The flatlay is very popular for a reason. Also your crops are a little tight give your self some negative space and some room to breath. \n\n\n\nSecondly from a styling point of view, I think are different schools of thought here in food photography, I don't like crumbs I think they look messy. I dont like random mise en place next to a bowl or plate unless its motivated like do I serve this with crudite. I like clean plated foods, even if its a rustic style of dish it doesnt mean there should be messy, its a careful balance to make something look rustic and natural and not overly plated but also not desheveled. These look like probably delicious but I wouldn't say they are particularly styled very well. theres moisture stains on the cutting board with the random pieces. Attention to detail should be your focus as a chef and as stylist or food photographer. \n\n  \nIm trying to be a little more constructive here working with what your are giving, assuming this is the best work you have from your \"portfolio\". But at the moment its not really there. Give it practice and really get detailed in to the why something is there, what the focus of the shot is.", "Definitely need to work on your lighting.

As for the second one with the ice cream, i like it overall, but I would've move around a bit the ingredients, the two on the bottom are not symmetrical to the top ingredients. Either all of them are in one line, or could be not in a line at all. Keep up the good work.", "1. Light is a little unbalanced, skewing heavily towards the left hand side of the image. the food is a little messy, and I can't really tell what anything is (aside from the tomatoes), and that's usually a bad sign - the photography should at the bare minimum show the food unambiguously. The pico de gallo is lost amongst the colour and texture of the plate, for example. A good rule of thumb would be that the busier the food, the more basic the plate should be. So, maybe opt for a white plate for this one. White plates don't have to be boring, you can get well-designed, textured or irregular ones which can look cool. The knife shows signs of water drops and streaks from cleaning. You should polish the cutlery or at least fix that in post. Make sure you always think of details like that. Overall, the composition could benefit from a little more time to experiment with placement, scattering, etc. Food photography is almost always embellished, especially editorial style shots such as yours, but in theory it should at least look somewhat realistic, as if a real moment in time is being represented. The scattering of the coloured things is quite over the top in that regard.\n2. The light, again, is unbalanced, very hot on the left, too dark on the right. So try experimenting with light placement, diffusion and fill, and see if you can get it more balanced. The food looks better here, particularly the scooped ice cream at the top and the crushed macaron thing in the middle, but the composition, with lots of things on one side and a single item on the other side feels quite unbalanced and arbitrary. This image would have benefited from a little more time to experiment with composition - there is probably a way that these elements work better together. Maybe two columns of ingredients, one either side of the bowl. Maybe placed in a semi-circle around the top of the bowl. Well done for getting real ice cream looking so good in this shot. Perhaps you were in a rush to the images before the ice cream melted. You can always experiment with a placeholder item. You probably know that in professional settings ice cream is often substituted for slightly modified mashed potato. I don't think that would work here because the ice cream is the central focus, but I thought I should mention it because tricks like that are usually fair game. Whenever I shoot food, the food is never edible, let's put it that way.\n3.  This is probably the most successful of the images. The cake looks good, the almond scatters look realistic, well composed and appetising. The dried flowers aren't great, and I don't think they belong on the same marble slab as the cake. Why not put a really nice designer cake slice lifter thingy there? Take the top off the cream bottle, and whatever that folded thing at the bottom is, I would either remove it or fold it in a way that looks more natural. Good use of surfaces here.\n4. This one is very successful too. The colours are attractive, the food looks very appetising. The propping is just a little OTT for my liking, but all the individual garnishes / flavour cues look good. My suggestions for this are to move the spices which are hiding underneath the big bowl, move the middle bowl down and to the right just a bit to give it some room to breathe, and place a spoon in the big bowl.\n5. The quality of the light in this one is pretty nice, but it's a little on the dark side. The chiles and tomatoes look a bit dull and lifeless, particularly the tomatoes. The bottles could look better. There are peeling labels, for example. And I don't think you've nailed the focus here - it's too soft in too many places. For me, this shot needs to be taken from directly above, not from a slight angle, and styled 'naturally', which is to say, with great precision to achieve a look which appears to be natural. Get at least a few of the labels in focus, and spend a good while nailing the composition. And throw more light in there.", "Which devices are you using?"]}

{"title": "Common Beginner Mistakes", "selftext": "Hi! So I've been on this subreddit for a little over a month. And I just wanted to make a quick rundown on some of the more common mistakes I saw in beginner photos. Hopefully, if you're just starting out this will be of some help!\n\nAll the photos below are by me. You'll see by no means am I a professional, but I do hope this provides value. Feel free to add any suggestions of your own of course.\n\n**1. Flatlay\u2019s are too flat.**\n\nDon't only pay attention to the two dimensions when taking a flat lay! In many cases, the more dimensional your photos are the better they will look. Feel free to add a cloth or a second plate for more layers and create that perception of depth.\n\nAs is with the next 9 tips, this is not an unbreakable rule. In general, they stand true. However, if you have a good reason to break a rule feel free to get creative! Always shoot with intent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This photo doesn't have as many layers but that's fine because I'm emphasizing the pattern made by the M&Ms](https://preview.redd.it/1svx9zxzexl41.jpg?width=2664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b7be90d1663a95dddcb808d635e4c637a170da8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If your heart wants to get creative, \\\\\"gopher\\\\\" it!](https://preview.redd.it/8an3e3rafxl41.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1276c9713e9fe49f3272f253d1f3329d6f89a83)\n\n**2. Too much shadow.**\n\nThis is a common mistake when trying to shoot dark and moody food photography. Even in dark photos, your subject should still be properly exposed.\n\nIf you're shooting with only one light source (e.g. window light), adding a whiteboard or white bedsheet on the opposite side serving as a light bouncer works great.\n\nSame with highlights, You want your milk to be white but not eye-blinding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na1uvsv9fxl41.jpg?width=7360&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2834687555ddc56a1ed07d7914347f28a11e14f7\n\n**3. Not filling the frame.**\n\nThis makes your photo feel empty and hollow. Place your props on the edges of your photo and let the frame cut it. The viewer will feel that there is more than meets the eye and it creates curiosity about what is beyond the frame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ngepahjfxl41.jpg?width=4912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac4dfcda3bf90427006ee3b3dfb21a6868e4104d\n\n**4. Not filling up the bowl/cup/glass.**\n\nI actually only started paying attention to this after being on this sub!\n\nCreate that abundance and avoid scarcity. Not only will it look better, but this will help your subject pop. There are a variety of ways to \u201ccheat\u201d if you don\u2019t have enough food. You can add a smaller bowl inside a bigger bowl that will take up space but be covered by the contents of your food. You can also use smaller bowls and plates, which without anything to reference will look perfectly normal-sized in your photo.\n\n**5. Wrong focus.**\n\nI see this a lot with sandwiches and hamburgers. Only the tip of the lettuce is in focus while the rest of the bun is out of focus. Bump up that aperture. In my opinion, you\u2019d rather have your background completely in focus than parts of your subject being out of focus.\n\n**6. Distracting background.**\n\nThis is pretty straightforward, but I still ignore it sometimes out of pure laziness. Make sure your background is clean, folks! Anything that is irrelevant to the photo should stay out of the photo.\n\n[Too lazy to iron the backdrop...](https://preview.redd.it/cwps7jb0gxl41.jpg?width=4912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74a178b9541719eff206e0b0f442ac6e172c8b65)\n\n**7. Bad color.**\n\nColor is very very important in food photography and plays a big part in making your food look tasty.\n\nProper editing can go a long way but do not over-saturate. Also, keep in mind white foods like milk and rice. You don't want yellow milk after messing with the white balance too much.\n\nUsing complementary colors is also a great way to make your subject stand out.  Check out [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com).\n\n**8. Not paying attention to corners.**\n\nThis is just proper attention to detail. Before calling it a day, check the corners of your photo and make sure nothing is poking in. Some things I saw that were irrelevant to the photo and could have easily been avoided - corner of a window, dust, food crumbs, edge of the backdrop.\n\n**9. Not using props.**\n\nProps help convey the atmosphere or story. They help with composition, either by framing your subject or leading the eye towards it. Start out with simple utensils and a piece of cloth if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The newspaper adds to the \\\\\"morning vibe\\\\\" and frames the cereal bowl](https://preview.redd.it/h8rwls9phxl41.jpg?width=5572&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72979fadf04556ff64e9bc62fe7b4696030f1af1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helped!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodphotography/comments/fgncmo/common_beginner_mistakes/", "created_utc": 1583882868.0, "score": 31, "author": "pj20001", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/foodphotography/comments/fgncmo/common_beginner_mistakes/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Really great run down, thanks so much for putting this together!", "subscribed", "Couple things I would add - is don't try and do too much.\n\nPhotos can go from great, to too busy in a hurry when you're dumping raw ingredients all over the frame or too many props.

Food shots are usually very bright, and lit from all angles with little to no shadows. It also seems like some of your pics need more contrast, and more vibrance. Composition is good, though.", "this comes off as sounding like an ass, sorry.  But these look like you should hire a professional.", "Personal opinion: too much negative space in the cake and ramekin shot. Get closer or zoom in on the subject. Take a look at the last dozen or so pics on this sub and notice how tight/close the compositions are. While these make nice photos, think of how your client\u2019s clients will be viewing them\u2014on a menu with a bunch of other photos/items, decreasing the size of the image. If your food subject is then a small part of an even smaller image, the client\u2019s clients will have a hard time looking at it.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d also consider a higher angle on many of those same shots. You\u2019re coming in at something like a 30 degree angle which, for example in the ramekin shot, almost makes the subject the ramekin and not the supposedly-delicious layer on top\u2014what is it, I can\u2019t tell, there\u2019s so little of it visible. If this were a video shoot, I\u2019d imagine the camera would start from the angle you have and pan at an angle upwards, ending with a sharp frame of the top layer. You don\u2019t have a video, so split the difference and use a higher angle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn food styling. Can you bubble and caramelize the top of the ramekin? It\u2019s texturally very flat. Just imagine if you could see the top bubbling and browning\u2014how much more appealing that would look. That image also has a chef in the background\u2014does that add to the story? What if the chef could bring out a torch to brown the top and give you a nice artisinal-at-work action shot?\u00a0\n\nLikewise, some of those cake slices (or brownie?) are really thin, which flattens the plate and the picture. It doesn\u2019t look as stunning when it\u2019s so flat. A higher angle puts the emphasis on the layers, the texture of the crumb and cream and colors. Here, you can\u2019t just ask for a thicker slice since that\u2019s not representative of the product. Buuut you could ask to see the plated slice next to the original it was cut from. Potentially adds more height and dynamism to the picture. Exception would be if the rest of the loaf were just all black around. If you could get a profile of the sliced opening and see the layers, then you could work with that \u2014 but it\u2019d also put you back to a sheer angle which is likelyunflattering for the slice.\n\nOn focus. On the first cake image, the focus seems to be on the whipped cream. Why? It\u2019s artsy, but I\u2019m not ordering whipped cream, I\u2019m ordering cake. I want to see the cake\u2019s texture \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t tell if it was a loose crumbed cake or dense brownie because its texture is smoothed out by not being the in-focus subject. Similarly, whatever is on top of the ramekin is not in the sharpest focus\u2014is it a french onion soup with cheese on top, or a meat pie with mashed potatoes on top? I have no idea from the picture.\u00a0\n\nI adore the cookie shots, really great. The only things I\u2019d suggest would be a wider shot of the variety cookies with the snowman \u2014 showcase your client\u2019s diversity in decorating those cookies! After all, people will buy those cookies because of the decorations. Give their customers a preview! You could totally set focus on just one of them, or keep deeper focus of everything. I\u2019d also maybe plate/style the santa cookies a bit more. These are sophisticated decorations\u2014the cluttered cookies on the baking sheet takes away from that. If it were arranged like the bears that\u2019d be great. It\u2019s also a santa cookie, so play around with that \u2014 can you style the shot to look like its the cookie left out for santa around a warmly lit table, with a glass of milk on the side?", "Take the dishes out of the kitchen and put them near a window in the restaurant but not in full sun.

I made some grape leaves this weekend and felt like I should record it. I have found that grape leaves are more attractive before they are cooked. The first picture is before cooking and the third is after. I am not 100% satisfied with either picture but I was a little rushed for time. I would of done something different with the lemons in the first picture. \n\nI am looking for any CC you may have. TIA!", "As a food photographer and a lover of humus and grape leaves, you should be proud. These look amazing!", "Lovely work! They're all very nice, I especially like the first one. The second one is also very interesting in a geometric sort of way, lots of shapes and patterns to look at, it sort of bounces the eye around the shot in a good way while still maintaining focus on the main dish.\n\nMy cc would be this:\n\nIn the first shot everything is a little too perfectly situated around the plate, maybe try moving the placement of the lemons so it seems a little more like they just happened to be there instead of purposefully lined up, and the empty teapot(?) is a little distracting, maybe if you filled it with something? It's a very beautiful glass piece, whatever it is. Also maybe you could have one half of a lemon and the other one be a smaller wedge so they're not exactly the same?\n\nIn the third shot I think your main dish is a little too close, either try pushing it back a little bit so it's more central to the shot or get slightly lower with your angle, and again the empty glass piece is distracting my eye. With the layout and the empty space it almost looks like the glass piece is supposed to be the center of attention and the grape leaves are just a bonus feature. The grape leaves look good, and the yellow of the lemon is good for creating focus, but all that empty space and the empty teapot(?) just keep drawing my eye away from the main feature. I'm also not 100% sold on the red plate, something about the green leaves and the red plate is a little off-putting. Maybe if you used another black plate or a more neutral color like cream or white it would show off the leaves even more? They're a very interesting color that you don't get in a lot of food photography, I think it could be beneficial to flatter the color a bit more.\n\nOverall, very good job! Food in that color range can be quite tricky to photograph and you've done great."]}

Take a very long exposure and move the torch in the places where you want your objects to be lightened.  \nRemember to hold the light longer on darker objects and less time on lighter ones.\n\n[Still life photography](https://preview.redd.it/vmn9uk7vihj61.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0f673b2753f9e3c872a0954a4be94f1fe6a42d3)\n\n\u2800  \nThis particular still life was inspired by the works of Dutch painters of 17th century, especially by Willem Claesz Heda and Pieter Claesz. I deliberately used colors instead of monochrome palette to make the picture juicier. The light was depicted as if from the window, tall and narrow. I was fascinated about the fact how much meaning was hidden by the Dutch authors in every oeuvre and tried to use symbolism in my photograph as well.  \n\u2800  \nThe central theme is also \u201cmemento mori\u201d (literally \u201cremember that you have to die\u201d). It reminds the viewer not to get lost in enjoying oneself with wealth and gluttony.  \n\u2800  \nSymbols and meanings:  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Apple has many meanings. It can signify love, knowledge, wisdom, joy, and death. In religious works it usually means temptation and original sin.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Grapes: earthly pleasures.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Pomegranate: fertility, desire, abundance, but also resurrection and immortality.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Bread and fish: everyday life, humility, the body of Christ.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Lemon has also several opposing meanings. From the one hand it's considered a symbol of luxury, love and longevity. On the other hand - disappointment and time passing.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Glass and silver objects were expensive luxury items, they stood for wealth and power in still life paintings. However, turned over glasses or plates reminds about modesty and emptiness of material pursuits.  \n\u2800  \nHere is the same composition shot with artificial light (one source, a soft box). Do you see the difference? What image would you prefer the most?\n\n[Composition shot with a soft box lightning](https://preview.redd.it/x1aj5xjpkhj61.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16ca01efbf39e18dc1aebe05ca4a5b8107aa40b4)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodphotography/comments/lrmva5/light_painting_still_life_photography_the_dutch/", "created_utc": 1614199143.0, "score": 27, "author": "Shot_recp", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/foodphotography/comments/lrmva5/light_painting_still_life_photography_the_dutch/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This.

I don\u2019t feel like this is the reason for your sharpness problem though.

I guess im still in the unkwon about corectly setting apeture. Is there a rule of thumb you go by for setting apeture or you snap different photos with different apetures?", "It really depends on the effect you\u2019re trying to achieve. The lower the f-stop, the narrower the depth of field, which means a narrow portion of your image will be in focus. It can be interesting to use a low f-stop to create a blurry foreground and/or background, but in this case, the front of your tart is blurry, which tells me you should use a bigger f-stop so that the entire tart is in focus (maybe in the 4 to 5.6 range). This will reduce the amount of light that hits the sensor, so you\u2019ll need a slower shutter speed. I don\u2019t recommend letting the ISO go higher, I\u2019m already seeing a bit of grain in your image! This could have been worsened by your post-processing though.

For next time, try your shutter speed at 1/100, and bump your ISO a few stops to 800 or 1000. You shouldnt be able to see much in terms of noise dependent on the sensor and age of your camera.

This was during regular out during dinner hours so they put me somewhere where I was out of the way of customers/those dining.  \n  \nI've only youtube videos on food photography.

Here are a few suggestions. 1) the light is a bit flat, and that's probably because it looks like you have 2 softboxes directly across from each other shooting the scene. Try lighting from behind with your key light, and then using a fill card to the front. It will give you more dynamic light. 2) The plating is OK, but needs to be tweaked a bit. 3) This is the one that stands out the most - you're using too many textures and colors as your placemats. It draws you away from the food, and is busy. I'm a fan of using different textures, but they need to be complimentary, and not distracting. You would have been better served not using the brown weave placemat, and just going with the table, and the orange runner. 4) look at your placement with your plates/bowls, there is a lot of empty dead space around the food (especially in the bowl) so, it makes it feel like the food is small. On the orange runner the bowls are spaced too far apart, so it looks too deliberate and empty. If you had placed some sort of garnish between them, they would have looked less symmetrical, and more organic. Also, the towel is doing you no favors. It's blue, and doesn't compliment the rest of your scene. By the time you get to the scene with all the plated items it is so busy that your eye doesn't know where to look. Keep shooting, and it will all start to make sense as you learn. Great job!", "Not bad, not bad at all. Keep it going!"]}

This is a good place to start:\n\n\"the plane is parallel to the camera's sensor. So as we change our camera's angle, we change this plane. Anything that is in front of this plane will be out of focus. Similarly, anything beyond this plane will also be out of focus.\"\n\nhttps://twolovesstudio.com/blog/macro-food-photography-plane-of-focus/", "exposure triangle is bogus,  at best it's helps you remember the relationship of aperture and shutter speed in regards to exposure. Don't rely on it to make your images. \n\nDistance to your subject and focal length of the lens will effect the depth of field as much as aperture does. Small aperture won't always give a deep depth of field and a large aperture wont always give a shallow depth of field if focal length and distance to subject are not helping you.\n\nYour camera is also tilted and you can see in the image the parts in focus are the front corner of the cake, the front edge of the stand, and part of the rim of the dishes in front. That plane is parallel to the camera sensor. \n\nThe plane of focus is that imaginary wall where everything is in focus. The closer you focus a lens the narrower the plane of focus is. Anything that is on that plane will be in sharp focus no mater what the aperture is. The further away you focus, the deeper the plane of focus becomes. Once the plane of focus reaches infinity everything in the plane will be in focus. Stopping down doesn't increase the plane of focus, it just lets more of the image be in acceptable focus. \n\nInfinity isn't a set point, it depends on the focal length. Using a quick estimate/rule of thumb, a 100mm lens is going to focus at infinity at about 100m. You will need to move back a long way to get everything there in focus.\n\nThe best way to get this image in focus, is to use a tilt shift lens so you can put the plane of focus across everything you need in focus, but if you want to save a thousand dollars, focus stacking is cheaper.", "are u using manual focus w your lens or using autofocus ?", "Shot details are required with your image posts. \n\nIf your post is a question and not an image you must use the weekly Q&A thread.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Think of the plate edge as a picture frame, with all of the elements needing to fit within that frame.\n\nFollowing the mindset of working within a frame, remember \u201cless is more.\u201d Smaller portion sizes will look better on most plates, and be easier to arrange for the camera.\n\nChoose the best ingredients for the shoot, and the best looking pieces of those ingredients. The salad is looking a little bruised/sad, the one lemon wedge looks a little rough, the rice is just a pile.\n\nThe salad is boring, and needs some colour, or dressing, or shape. It is a dark hole on the plate.\n\nA pile of rice is a pile of rice, but here\u2019s how you can give it shape. Wet a small bowl, lightly pack the rice into the bowl, and then, upside down, tamp it down on to the plate just hard enough for the rice to come out. It might take a few tries but you should have a nice bowl shaped mound after that.\n\nA coupe of thoughts on the photos:\n\nWhat is your colour palette? You have a very nice scene but neglected to match the background to the food. Try to work with like 3-5 colours max (whenever possible)\n\nDecorative props should support the focus of the composition, pepper corns and flowers are nice, but what do they have to do with the meal, the ingredients, or the occasion of this meal. Try to tie it all together.\n\nShooting blacks and whites in the same photo is always tough, and inevitably you will lose definition of one or the other. Try to work within the same key, and shoot all light or all dark, and then use the opposite for emphasis or highlight.\n\nHope this helps!

Often some of these will be out of focus on the counter, which will add more depth to the photo\n- The knocked over muffin stands out well. I like this idea a lot. If you put something underneath it - it will be propped up closer to the camera and if you position the object underneath right - it will be invisible. This is a cool trick to make things stand out even more in flatlays, and add more bokeh to the surface the objects are sitting on. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/BpJUQRB6cLo\n\nSome of the tips in this video might help as well, or my photography style might differ from yours completely and none of them work for you! Either way - this is what helped me with flatlays :) \n\nhappy cooking, happy shooting! Looking forward to seeing more.", "Practice makes perfect! Here are some tips that might help on your next go:\n\n- Use a baking scale and weigh out your batter to ensure muffin size consistency.\n- Make sure your spacing is perfect, the muffins clearly aren't spaced evenly. Massage your proportions until everything looks just right.\n- Keep things consistent, why the one muffin laying on its side?\n- If you're going for the whole pattern look, go all out. Try to make it more symmetrical by arranging the muffins in a 3x3 grid. Odd numbers are also often more pleasing than even numbers. 9x9 also gives the image a focuses center and divides it into thirds (so it plays nicely with the rule of thirds).\n- Use a bounce to light the other side of the muffins. There's too much shadow going on here.\n- Use some kind of diffusion material to soften the light.\n- It looks like there are two light sources coming from the top of the image. Try to stick to one, or merge them so you don't get that weird double shadow look.\n\nSource: I'm a professional food photographer."]}

I'd like to see more of the cake in focus, especially those ridges in the frosting around the edges. A tripod would go a long way in allowing you to lower your ISO and close up your aperture without compromising clarity.\n\n\\- Something large and white frame left would help bounce your light back into the scene and fill in those shadows on the left side of the cake.\n\n\\- This is just a small nitpick but I would have left the whole platter in the crop.

So, in this instance, I, personally, would reduce the exposure, saturation and contrast in the background. I'd use a radial filter in Lightroom to up the clarity and brightness of the chips only, and actually dim down the background a bit to give you some more separation between it and the main subject.

It is part of a 15-course menu consisting of locally hunted and foraged foods prepared in traditional Native American ways.   \n\n\nHere, we created a traditional bannock bread from a 30 year old sourdough mother to which we mixed in ash of poplar and maple wood. The bannock is cooked over hot stones and finished table-side over hot coals and served with a butter of whipped bone marrow.   \n\n\nIf anyone is interested, the rest of the menu as well as some additional information can be found on our Insta @whiskandjigger.\n\nThank you, friends.\n\nEdit:\n\nOn the technical side, this was a stacked shot on my Fuji X-T10 with a Fujinon 60mm at F8 at 1/250 ISO 200 as the base, and a similar shot at 1/50 for the glowing coals which I then comped in in post. The whole scene is lit from the back left with a single Neewer 960 LED panel at 4600k softened with a lone round diffuser. \n\nAs for the bannock itself, it is a blend of stone-ground amaranth, buckwheat, and millet flour with our sourdough mother as a natural leavening agent. The bannock took quite a bit longer to rise (36 hours) due to our addition of maple ash. Despite the longer prep times, the ash adds a lovely woody bite as well as a beautiful deep black colour to the inside of the bannock. Finally, the bread was cooked on hot stones surrounded by maplewood coals and finished tableside on the same coals. Following the typical M\u00e9tis tradition of using readily available fats with their breads, we opted for a rich, velvety whipped bone marrow, or *graisse de moelle*, as the spread, which we sweetened with a touch of maple syrup.", "[deleted]", "Why did you put a big white border around a dark picture?"]}

It\u2019s just not quite working for me anymore when it comes to capturing the detail, color, and mood I want in my food shots. That led me down a bit of a rabbit hole: researching different systems, watching YouTube reviews, reading blog posts, and checking out what other food photographers are using.\n\nOne camera that keeps coming up\u2014especially in budget-friendly circles\u2014is the Nikon D800 (and its slightly newer sibling, the D810).

Be mindful of the background (e.g. the edge of the table, other items peeking into frame, someone's arm with a distracting bracelet, etc).

While it's not a hard and fast rule, I had a film photography professor tell us that we should aim to keep our whites a little less than white. I personally tend to stick by this on 90% of shots.\n\n\\- Mind your focus - The first shot could be nicer if it were focusing on the microgreens, but it's focused behind them. Honestly, if you're stopped down to f/2, you might consider f/5.6 to keep the full dish intact for some of these.\n\n\\- Mind your angles - I love having angles in shots, but these feel a little crooked more than purposefully angled. I used to do this a lot. Try to be mindful of having straight lines, isometric lines, etc. It can help the shot look more composed. I don't like the arm and thigh in the dumpling shot - it'd be nicer if it were just the dish and a straight line for the edge of the table.\n\n\\- General touch-ups - The dumpling over the sauce could be touched up to remove the microgreen from the sauce, for instance. Table dents and small things like that could be easily fixed in post to help polish things up.\n\n\\- Zoom in or out - I feel like these are either too far away from the food to make a bold impression or not far away enough since there are other things in the background that could set a scene. I personally like close-ups more than spreads, but it could be helpful to determine the goal of each shot beforehand so you can know where you need to be when shooting and composing.\n\nI hope this was helpful!

To start maybe try bringing in a lamp or other household light to strategically shape your light, then graduate to a continuous light with soft box when you\u2019re ready. Maybe a flash system after that. You can help yourself by shooting during late morning or early evening when light through windows is dimensional but bright. A simple diffuser board by windows can help.\n\nFor photo coverage, I like to get a wide, medium, and close shot(s) for each stage. This helps focus the shoot so you aren\u2019t weeding through 100s of photos for winners, that\u2019s a time killer.

Your aperture is wide open thus making your plane of focus very small so the front of your food item might be in focus but everything else will be slightly blurry.

My suggestion, if you don't want to use a flash, is to close up your aperture to something like f8, set your shutter to 1/180 to avoid motion blur, and raise your ISO to maybe somewhere around 800.

So a lot of pics are food, cocktails and from time to time hotel rooms.\nSo either way, I think if I'm correct the most versatile is 24-70mm f2.8?

The long-ish shortest focal distance makes it a non starter for me.

I only use primes for food and architecture, and rarely use AF (especially for close up shots where moving in and out a bit is more accurate). \n\nThe two lenses I use the most for food are the Voigtlander 40mm f/2 Ultron and the Micro-Nikkor 55mm f/2.8. Both are wide enough that I can fit a place setting in a shot when I stand on a chair and also can focus close enough to get detail shots with a blurred background. I do use 105mm macro lenses in the studio sometimes, but I need more room than I usually have on locations. I think the Voigtlander 23mm f/1.2 or Nikon 24mm f/1.7 would be good choices for APS-C. \n\nFor shooting the rooms you need a wide lens, I always bring at least a 20mm with me in case I have to shoot a space. I also use a 14-24mm f/2.8 frequently, but both the G and Z versions are pretty large so I only bring it if I know I have to do architectural shots (a 20mm prime fits in my kit much more easily).

Changing the lighting for each dish would consume loads of time and effort.(I would suggest you to stick with one lighting and concentration more on props and placements) \n- Follow hero shots (google it)\n- Ask the client if he is looking for a highkey photos (well lite) or a lowkey photos (somewhat dark) and follow the same through out.\n\nAngles:\n- 45\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Sometimes 0\u00b0.\n\nLenses:\n- Use 105mm or 70mm since it would make the background bigger and blur\n- Shoot on f12 or f16 make sure the main subject is totally in focus\n- Dont go for F2 or 1.8 unless you are shooting details \n- Low iso 300 - 500 max\n\nLighting:\n- Larger the diffuser the better (softer the image)\n- If you can get Karl taylor light cone for white bg images\n- If possible use two flashes in one diffuser. You can get flash mounts for softbox.(deep octa recommended or else use any rectangle softbox)\n- First easy setup is - Top lighting (single Octa behind the dish) with 45\u00b0 angle. Use reflector opposite to light from below to fill shadows (perpendicular to camera tripod)\n- Watch \"The Bite Shot\" on youtube. (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GlZyL2KUmh4)\n- Second easy setup is - Two softboxes one of each side of the dish (good for top down shots)\n- Third easy setup is - one flash bounce on full power on white ceiling and one softbox on one side and use reflector opposite side.\n- If you are using natural light, set up your table either facing north or south.\n\nBackground:\n- You can either use the existing wall of they have good texture or you can print out a flex with neutral grey abstract background or wooden background\n- The farther you move the subject from bg the darker it becomes(follow the biteshot link)\n- Carry loads of clips, glue tacs\n\n\nProps:\n- Since it's your first time use props from the restaurant\n- Get some neutral clothes to decorate the subject\n- Sometimes I would shoot photos they way they serve to customers(clients request)\n- Use different plating and cups to make the subject interesting (heroshot)\n\n\nVIDEOGRAPHY:\n\nFollow same steps as photography\nMoodboarding, Angles, Lenses, Lighting, Background, Props\n\nMoodboarding: \n- Make moodboarding on Slow motions, rotating (turntable), zoom in zoom out, panning, focus shift shots\n- Script one full dish making from scratch to customer table\n- Testimonials from customers\n- Search Daniel Schiffer on youtube\n- handheld, tripod shots, gimbal\n\nAngles:\n- Same as photography \n\nLenses:\n- You can be creative here. But use f5 atleast and \nObviously low iso\n\nLighting:\n- Deep Octa from top or two light setup\n- Make sure your turn off restaurant lights\n- You might rent one or two continuous lights(don't get bi color to begin with)\n- Take a large grey or black clothes to cover surroundings to avoid any natural light spilling into your shots\n\nBackground: \n- You would be needing a bigger background since you would be moving.\n\nProps:\n- Restaurant cutlery and clothes at your disposable\n\n\nFinally, just be patient and try to get the light set up first and the do the props for dishes. Dont keep changing the light setup. Write down the number of dishes and angles after each shot. Ask one person to be with you to help you out with dishes and plating. If possible you can take a intern for helping you out. Do Teather shoot. Review your shots every now and then. Especially your focus points. Dont complicate things. Just decide on one light setup and follow it. Goodluck."]}

Food photography is to a high degree just as much about food and set styling as it is about photography. Here's some tips to get you in the right direction. \n\nUse small portions, way smaller than what you would eat. The negative space from the plate itself makes the food stand out - and the objective is always to make the food look as appetizing as possible.\n\nStick to one light source, which should be soft, light from the left or top. As you master this you can add more, but food is an organic thing and shoud look natural. Windows are great for this. \n\nLook into color theory. For this image you'd be way better of using a blue-ish background as a complementary color to the yellow in the pasta dish.\n\nManage color temperature. The white plate in this image is yellow-tinted. A certain warm shift is nice, but with the added yellowness from every other element makes this image way too yellow.\n\nGarnish with fresh ingredients.\n\nConsider your background. Keep it simple. Only add items which enhances the image. A few strands of dried pasta and some dried herb container doesn't do it. You want to make people hungry for an amazing dish, not just anything they could throw together. A fresh bunch of parsley and some homemade pasta would be way better. Maybe some cloth if it makes sense in the setting.\n\nUse simple compositions effectively. Rule of thirds goes a long way. Experiment with angles. 45 degree and top-down is popular for a reason. In this image you've cut off the plate on two edges, if you only cut one it would retain it's eye-catching shape better. \n\nGet inspiration from the best of the best. If you strive to be as good as any other mediocre photographer you will never be better than that. And the only way to get there is to shoot a fuckton of images. PA J\u00f6rgensen, Sam A Harris, Lateef Okunnu, Nick Millward and Tommy Andresen are a few from the top of my head. \n\nJoane Simon and Lauren Short have great Youtube-channels for when you're starting out and beyond.

The only thing I would change is melting the cheese further till it drips like you see in the other photos.  \n  \n**Second pic**: I think the bun is well lit here. Composition-wise, I would have moved towards the right a little more to see a bit of the glassware stem and less of the tray space in the front left. The red background choice with the dark beer bottle complements the warmth of the burger. I would have also chosen a darker/lighter tray liner paper or make it a darker color in post to help the burger stand out more.\n\n**Third pic:** it looks like there is a noodle/something on the lens (can be photoshopped out) in the center right of frame. I would have closed the aperture more to get the rest of the burger in focus while still keeping the beer bottle out of focus. You can see the aberration/dark outline of the meat and cheese at it's current depth. The glaze on the meat is well captured though.\n\n**Fourth pic:** I would also back up the frame for this one. It looks like there is a white bounce or something making the front third of the burger brighter. I like this effect but it appears stronger in this photo than the rest, I would either make it more subtle or achieve the same lighting in all of your photos (which could help with lighting style).\n\n**Food styling:** when shooting for a restaurant, I know they often just provide the food but if you could collaborate on the styling for camera, I would finesse the layering a bit more. In the fourth pic for example, the cheese could have more drips over the patty and the bacon on top could be shown more. I'm not a fan of the paper towel but if the burgers are served that way, then that would make sense.\n\n**My last tip**: I noticed these shots are larger than 4:5 ratio for vertical. If you or your client wanted these for social media or website, they will want to crop down to 4:5/1:1. To make sure you can provide the most visual information, I would back up the camera and capture more of the scene plus shoot at your highest resolution so you can always crop in or narrower for 9:16 ratio (mobile fullscreen).\n\n  \nI hope this was helpful!", "My only comment is there\u2019s a bit too much empty space to the left on #2. Move that bottle a little left and closer to the camera to solve it. \n\nOtherwise I\u2019m getting a cool 70s Steak & Ale vibe and I dig it.\n\nEdit: took me a second to figure out what that was on the top right.

{"title": "How do you deal with unhappy clients?", "selftext": "I have a client that contracted me for a full day of work at my day rate. As per my usual agreement, I take a 50% retainer and the remainder on delivery of the photos. This whole process this time around was accelerated and the client was in a big hurry to get it all done - and the contract went unsigned (I know this is on me, believe me, I'm kicking myself). I sent shots as I edited as I usually do for feedback and heard nothing but positive remarks. I delivered the gallery yesterday, and suddenly the work is \"completely unacceptable\" and \"I don't know how we can justify paying you the remainder of your invoice, or even the deposit we already paid\"\n\nThere was also a minimal amount of video involved - when we had our initial discovery call he asked if I had done video or could do it and I said \"I don't do much video, but if what you need is simple I can most likely get the shots you need\". He said they needed simple shots and I said sure, I'll try and get them for you. He came to me with an extensive shotlist that was storyboarded, completely beyond the scope of what we discussed. I still gave it an attempt to get them some usuable footage, but it was mostly crap, I don't have the proper equipment for what they wanted. I spent \\*maybe\\* an hour getting video shots. I told him, yes, the video is on me, I misunderstood your needs but I didn't charge you extra for it. He very snarkily said \"So we overpayed you for photography then? Because you spent some time doing video so it took away from photographing.\"\n\nUm, first of all, you haven't even paid me for the entire day yet, ya rude ass. (No, I didn't say that, but I wanted to) and second my day rate applies to anything beyond 5 hours. I worked an 8 hour day, and I spent 1 hour getting video shots, so it would have been billed at the day rate regardless.\n\nI am NOT an amateur food photographer. I have my BFA in photography and have been photographing food specifically for around two years now. I have literally never once had this type of feedback from a client, and I'm floored, and quite frankly, I don't know how to move forward. The quality of the work delivered matches my portfolio and is in line with the mood board I created for the shoot and was signed off on by them.\n\nI'm not optimistic about these guys paying the remainder of their invoice. What I want to know is how to go about my next contact with them, if you have any advice at all. He said he would get with the team to talk about a possible path forward and get back to me today (this was yesterday) and I said I would be happy to rework some of the edits if that's the issue - I sent over a before and after of a reworked edit and was left on read. The gallery has been downloaded and I think I'm going to get crickets now.\n\nWhat's the best way to address them now? I want to make it clear that if they do not pay the remainder of the invoice they do not have the rights to use my work product. From my understanding, since the contract was never actually signed, they have zero rights to the work product as I am an independent contractor. I will send a cease and desist letter if they don't comply with this request.\n\nI feel like they're trying to rip me off honestly. I delivered what we talked about, on par with the quality I represent on my website. They sought me out. I did not contact them for a pitch. I think they don't want to pay my full rate so they're suddenly saying the work is \"completely unacceptable\" and \"has major issues\".\n\nI fully expect them to use the work and not pay me without a strongly worded email.\n\nIf you read all of this - thank you. Any and all advice is appreciated. Like I said, this is my first time ever experiencing this and I'm just at a loss.\n\nTLDR: I delivered photos on par with my usual quality and the mood board that was approved for the shoot and the client suddenly hates them and doesn't want to pay me.

Like you, I am an experienced photographer (20 years!) with 2 years of college level instruction in photography and a degree in Fine Art. \n\nI ultimately refunded the fee, filed the photos with the Copyright Office, and told the client they were not to use any of the photography. I and asked them to sign a contract that said they had no rights to the images and would not display them in any form..\n\nIt left a sour taste and I was pretty angry, but cutting them loose was the best thing I could do. One more word of advice: do not do \u201cwork for hire\u201d on photography unless you are getting tens of thousands of dollars. I am very sorry this happened to you.

Honestly, the setup is fine but you're not going to want to hear this next part.\n\nAt a certain level, food photography like this should be \"perfect\". And I think if you posted this looking for feedback, you would have a LOT of notes. a BA in photography means nothing, so I wouldn't mention it, (sorry) but I can see where you think this is a great photo, but I see a subject that's way too hot one side, ingredients and untensils that are melting into the background and the chopsticks are not even straight up and down. Maybe the knolling style of food photography is your thing, but it doesn't really \"sell\"  me on the dish, i'm not the chef, I shouldn't have to imagine what it's like put together. Maybe this is exactly what the client asked for, but red ingredients on red background is already kinda sus, and you're always going to be fighting that choice uphill, but I think depending on your day rate, they might have a point. If your day rate is $600, I would say they got what they paid for, if your day rate is $1200, I would feel the same as them if this is the average level of quality of the shoot.", "Yeah that's a tough one to deal with. To start, I'm sure a lot of us have been in the situation of a rushed shoot where contracts go un signed. I also require 50% non refundable deposit before the shoot upon signing of the contract with the remainder being paid before images are released. Unfortunately there are times where the client just doesn't do either but the shoot is immediate and it is hard to just not show up to the shoot especially when it is a large invoiced contract. Not ideal but it happens. And to anyone that wants to comment \"Well you should have...\" yeah we get it, that's not the problem in front of us at the moment. \n\nIn terms of the rights to the images, contract or no contract you own the rights to the images and if they haven't paid you for the agreed amount and are using said images you have every right to tell them they need to stop using them or legal action will be taken. Yes this will lead to the client probably not hiring you again moving forward, but judging by the spot you are in I don't think you will care that much. Money is nice but ultimately as a contractor and being your business you get to choose who you work with and it is better to build a client base that you respect and one that respects you. \n\nIt sounds like you were very upfront in terms of what you can deliver and I'm sure they recognized your portfolio as a style that suited their needs. Especially if you were sending shots in real time to get a green light while you were doing the shoot (always a good idea when not working with the team directly).  You also mentioned you were upfront about your video abilities and it not being your main area. So you have covered your basis on what they can expect and they can't say you didn't give warning. \n\nWith moving forward you have a couple options which mainly boil down to how you want to move forward with this client on future jobs.\n\nIf you want to try and keep the client you can offer a reshoot and try to work with them and their team to get the images they are looking for. Ask for the team to send mood boards to help show exactly what they were looking for that is different than what you already shot. \n\nIf you want to get the full money from what was agreed upon you can continue to reach out and request the remainder of the payment for use of the images. If they refuse to pay the rest of the amount then you keep the deposit and tell them they can not use the images. Since no contract was signed find and save any sort of email or conversation that can back up your claims that they did not follow through with the agreement. It's not as good as a contract but its at least something. \n\nIf they straight up ghost you and refuse to return calls or emails there isn't too much else you can do other than keep whatever money they sent and just take the shoot as a loss. It sucks but it happens. \n\nMy advice would be to keep contact and email again next week if you don't hear from them. If you keep getting no response after a couple weeks then email and explain they do not have the rights to the images until the remainder is paid and go from there. A tough thing about working with teams is they don't often communicate well with each other so it takes longer than usual to get back to you. Give it a little time and see what they say. \n\nEither way I am sorry to hear they are responding like that, no one want's to deal with tough client's but they are out there and they can be worked with.

It hits a tough point too because you could try and go public about the company ripping you off but I\u2019ve seen that backfire for photographers before, even when they\u2019re 100% in the right, and can just make them sound hard to work with.

I know I wouldn\u2019t be okay with learning someone at a company I worked at was pulling shit like this on contractors. \n\nI think the photo looks better than anything I could do, just for the record.

You could hire a lawyer if they decide to use your images without consent but that may just add more costs than revenue and may mar your reputation for being litigious if this client is connected. It\u2019s unfortunate that as a photographer we have to consider our reputation in the face of people who are literally doing illegal things but our jobs are customer-facing service jobs and we\u2019re between a rock and a hard place. \n\nI see that you sent shots and received positive feedback but were you tethering? I always tether on these shoots, not just so I can make sure things look good in LR, but so the client can see and approve everything. It\u2019s very important to get verbal approval, IMO, from a client before you leave so that the accountability is on them, not you. That way if a client wants you to reshoot something, it\u2019s also on them and then you can charge for your time/get more business. \n\nSorry again but the emotional value of not having this person live rent-free in your head and moving on may be more valuable than the other half of your payment."]}

You can't own enough.\n\n2) Plates - I try to always have at least 4 of each set - Most of the time, a table is going to be a 4-top if you're shooting a wide scene. Otherwise you're probably shooting a single plate, and using the other as background or possibly as non-hero setups to get lighting right.\n\n3) Silverware - I generally keep 3 full sets of silverware in different styles - Fancy, Middle of the road, and dark - You really can't have enough silverware either. I also have a ton of one-off pieces that are old, or unique, that I have picked up from thrift stores.\n\n4) Serving utensils - You can't have enough, especially since you may need different styles - old, new, patina, shiny, matte, wooden, bamboo, etc... \n\n5) Napkins and dish towels - once again, you can't have too many of these, because there are an infinite amount of combinations that could be useful - try to purchase linen style napkins in sets of 4 to go with your plates as well. Try for solid colors, or items that are not busy, so they don't distract from the scene.\n\n6) Cups - I have 3 full sets of cups/glasses that will compliment the plating, plus a bunch of 2 or 3 glass sets that compliment each other - plus whisky glasses, shot glasses, and various coffee cups.\n\n7) Serving bowls/ramekins small condiment dishes - buy as many as you can store. They tend to show up on set in groups of 3, so you never have enough of these either. Get them in various sizes and colors. (I tend to use smaller ones more, but also need bigger ones for larger settings)\n\nThe best thing you can do to build your prop catalog is shop thrift stores, Goodwill, Catholic charity stores, Salvation Army, etc... and just see what they have that looks interesting, or will help fill out your props as you go. They are cheap, but usually are limited to one or two of an item. For new items shop at stores like Home Goods - they carry cool items that tend to cost less than the other stores. Walmart and Target have great selections of plates and other food props that you can get relatively cheaply. [Here are the props](https://imgur.com/a/NAmRdXY) I have just sitting in a corner of the studio. In our outdoor storage I have another shelf that's full of larger items like cutting boards, and various surfaces (you also can't have enough surfaces) like faux tabletops, and even some wooden tabletops that we have built over the years. And, I also have 5 full dining sets in boxes that I use for larger shoots like Christmas or Thanksgiving spreads. [If you look through my food portfolio](https://moorecreativedesign.com/food-photography/) you will see there are so many different setups that are necessary that having a large prop supply available can really help when you're working with clients. Especially if those clients are not necessarily preparing food to be served in a restaurant (Like grocery stores). They make food that is not served as a place setting, but they still need photos of those items in a setting that to which the consumer can relate. In larger markets you can hire a prop stylist, and they will bring their own props. If you're shooting at a restaurant, they are usually going to want to use their own plates, but it's always helpful to have extra props to finish a shot. If you're working with a client that will give you a budget, go buy them, and charge it to the client. They will usually be happy that you've taken the time to find items that work for their food, and compliment the style you are shooting.\n\nI know that's a lot of information, but hopefully it is helpful.", "I think it mostly depends on your space. I don't really have much space for many duplicates so I usually stick to one plate but I wish I had more space so we could take more interesting pics that imply some sort of get together or family dining experience. but for me its choice between more props, more lights, or more cookware/utensils. We typically do a full how to video then a photoshoot at the end so we need to have everything in the same space.\n\nWith that said, I tend to get 1 of each piece of dishware (plates, bowls, etc), most napkins are sold in multipacks which is helpful, but I always keep my eye out for multipack deals. If a dish looks unique and I can get two types of dishware for different shoots I tend to pick it up.

Manfroto and Mathews are two quality brands and Impact makes some decent budget options. Don't buy anything generic on Amazon to save some money, it will be useless crap. You will need white and black cards for bouncing and blocking light, large pieces of foamcore that are black on one side and white on the other are useful. You will need a way to diffuse light, white rip stop fabric can work well and allows you to control the amount of diffusion you want (and is cheap). Shoot through umbrellas are very useful and provide a medium softening of the light. Softboxes are good to have, and are another thing you should go cheap on, cheap ones fall apart in the middle of shoots and can provide uneven lighting.\n\nYou will need grip equipment - starting with adapters to fit your lights onto the stands. Superclamps and articulating arms are very helpful for placing bounce card or diffusion materials. Wooden blocks are great for propping up bounce/flag cards. Make them yourself in the sizes you need and paint them flat black. A tripod is a must, the way to get great shots is to take one, tweak the framing, lighting, and prop placement, shoot again - repeat, repeat, repeat. It is much easier to do this when your camera is on a tripod.\n\nFor shooting - most food shots are best served by a normal focal length (35-60mm or so). Manually set the aperture and focus. Paying attention to your depth of field and where it is placed is one of the foundations of good food photography.\n\nFinally get a color calibration target - even just a gray scale or card makes a big difference. You don't need to go with a fully neutral balance, but it's good to always be starting your editing from a consistent balance.

For me, the first thing that stands out is camera placement.  For each shot, what I assume is supposed to be featured is relatively small in frame. Because of that, the eye is drawn all over the photo, One section being dominant. I would try moving your camera closer to the \u201chero\u201d of the shot. \n\nThe very narrow aperture also makes this issue more pronounced. Since the focus is in so much of the frame, there\u2019s less relative crispness on the hero.  Maybe play with F stops and find the one that keeps the hero in focus but softens what is behind it . \n\nI also think some of the props you\u2019re choosing are making it difficult. Large white plates and platters with a lot of empty space just become bright but blank spots in the shot.  The sizes of your props also seem to be all relatively the same. For example, the plant on the table is of a similar size to the ramekin with food in it. That makes it compete for attention rather than letting it be just something pretty that helps fill out the frame. \n\nI hope this is helpful. Good luck!", "From art class, compose the negative space. \n\nFrom looking at your local cafe post, there's a lot of clutter interfering with the hero of the shot, it's too busy.

Basically shooting with an eye that knows what to look for. That\u2019s just practice. \n\n- there\u2019s a gap line where the background meets the surface, get rid of it, it\u2019s very distracting and doesn\u2019t lead the eye to the drink as it would. Try to fix these things on set but it\u2019s also an easy fix in post. \n\n- there\u2019s a relaxed mood here, while the cork is fine the sparkling\u2019s cage is too far. That speaks more to party or mess than enhancing the drink subject you\u2019ve got going on. Or at least it\u2019s poorly placed, something worth playing around with. Sometimes details are added and it\u2019s too much. Like the lime wheel hiding under the mint\u2014 it can go. It\u2019s very distracting from the mint garnish and adds nothing to the photo. \n\n- I\u2019m not sure why but for some reason the perspective feels slightly forced and like the wine glass is about to fall over. I\u2019m not sure what to say about that. \n\n - when picking supporting items try to go for the best or most interesting subjects. Everything from the crooked lime wheel, mint etc is just sort of off. I like the casual of it all but it\u2019s got a disarray that could be reigned in. \n\n- The green key light is nice but not doing quite as much work as it could. Maybe a bounce card from the other direction or a brighter key light could give those highlights that make a subjects form pop. \n\n- the glassware itself seems just out of focus. Getting the mint and cork is great but the drink is just about to disappear in some places. This causes us to focus more on those supporting items than the hero of the shot. \n\n\nThis is a fun stage where you\u2019ve got a lot of intention but not enough clarity to fully capture the subject matter. It ends up making the image look forced or heavily staged because I\u2019ve got competing style indications of casual yet fully manicured. They can work together it\u2019s just not happening here.\n\n\n[Here\u2019s a quick fat fingered, phone edit to give you an idea](https://ibb.co/9wVJskv)\n\n[And a low quality side by side](https://ibb.co/BcXXKrY)\n\nAt one point I got rid of the cork too and that looked stellar, just a bit far for my phone editing tho.", " It feels like smth is wrong with perspective IMO", "Sorry if this is too late to comment, but I don't know how fast this sub moves or what is considered necro-posting here.  \n\nI really like this shot but I had a question about focusing. Did you try some focus stacking here or are you maybe using a tilt shift effect? You seem have two, possibly three, distinct planes of focus running through the glass. The front mint leaves are in focus, then the middle sprigs are out of focus, and then the rear leaves are back in focus again. There also seems to be a hint of a focus plane running between the front foot of the glass and the cork. This combined with the glasses in both of your shots feeling slightly off kilter makes me think of a tilt/shift effect. But you say you're not using one of the PC lenses. I'm just wondering what techniques you're using.\n\nOtherwise, I agree with u/liarliarhowsyourday ; good color choices, good styling (lose the cork cage,) good execution. I like this one more than your orange photo.  The high key subject lighting with black background weighs down the image and makes it feel like it can't decide whether it wants to be a morning brunch or a sophisticated nighttime bar. You want to make sure that your hero orange slice is just perfect, too, but that's just me nitpicking.

Raise both of them. \n\nSecond is completely out of focus and suffers from the same motion blur. See all comments from above on this.

Those colours look much better overall. \n\nApologies if you knew but I think you might have actually dropped the aperture rather than increased it.

Aperture numbers work by increasing the number you increase the depth of focus. Which can be confusing because technically you\u2019re closing the aperture by doing this. \n\nIf you go again, boost your light right up. Don\u2019t go any lower than 1/125 shutter speed if you\u2019re shooting handheld (this will fix the blur), 5.6 being the absolute minimum aperture but ideally closer to 8 and then adjust the ISO to expose it correctly.", "Damn you take feedback quick. Well done - way better than the previous. Go f8 or above when people say deeper depth of field use it if you have enough light. There are downsides to that ie. diffraction but hopefully it can be worked out with some sharpening of some sort.\n\nAs an add which you can try. At this angle your subject needs some shadows the light is nicely spreading over the subject but im wondering if having more volume will make it better. You know in anime or asian movies /ads where rice bowls (or similar) are stacked above the  bowl in an inverted bowl / hemispherical shape? Im my mind that would put half of the the bowl not facing the light in shade which hopefully create some volume. After that add a flag (a piece of board where light wont go through) in between the subject and the light im looking at it like a shadow running on the top left.covering some of the lemon and Other accesories and another on the bottom basically faking a window.

I have to turn on the overhead light, which are daylight LED with 5000K temperature, to have enough light.  I use photo mode on my phone.  I tried portrait mode, but my picture looked blurry in places.  I have tried flash and no flash and the result does not look any different.  My photos have a slight yellowing tinge.  I have tried editing the brightness, temperature, and contrast using Snapseed and Retouch, as well as Instagram's photo editor.  It makes my photo a little better, but not as nice as I would like.  I would like for my photos to look like the photos in an account I follow on Instagram.  I asked the person who has this Instagram account about her pictures, and she told me that she uses her iphone, takes her picture in front of a floor length window using only the natural light that comes in.  She uses portrait mode on her iphone, and the only editing she does is minimal, and she uses the Instagram photo editor.  She does not use filters hardly at all.  I snapped my photo (second photo) with my Samsung S22+ and brightened it just a little, upped the contrast a little, and lowered the temperature a little.

Well, it's true and it makes food photography slightly more difficult than everything else. Humans have evolved to look at food with an instinctual complexity.\n\nBlurry food is an issue, for most humans if food has a fuzzy texture we are going to be cautious. In the real world this visual compels us to check for mold or bacterial growth. You need to avoid that instinct when taking food photos in my opinion.\n\nTry the shot again except this time completely sharp and in focus.", "Interesting shot. Food looks yum and well presented. Salad, bread and tomato look crisp and fresh, cheese is almost dripping, 'tatoes look handmade, wooden board compliments the food, that's very invitating.\n\nI'll write some comments, take what feels right for you. \n\nMaybe my only take on the food itself is that I can't really see the grounded meat, and it looks a bit cooked. I would want to see that it's a fresh piece. \n\nAbout lighting, the dark atmosphere gives the shot a very intimate feel, don't know if that's what you were aiming for.\n\nIn my opinion, that would be a good light ambiance for a cocktail shot for a pub with an intimate atmosphere, I'm not so sure it works for a burger. I guess in depends on the atmosphere of the restaurant too. Let's say it doesn't sell ''lively atmosphere'', so my advice would be not to make all the shots in your portofolio with that kind of lighting. \n\n\nAbout aperture, as it is often said on this sub, use it very carefully. The normal human eye does not do blurry foreground and blurry background. If you use it in portrait photography, it gives a very special effect that detach the subject from its background. If you use it in landscape photography, it gives a very cinematic effect that emphasizes the building or phone booth or whatever that you want the attention to be focused on.\n\nIn food photography, depth of field in used generally to separate the food from the background. When you use it IN the food, especially in a stacked food tower that is a burger, you are not detaching an ingredient from the background, you are creating a blur IN ingredients.\n\nGenerally it is distracting, sometimes in creates a sense of uneasiness. Like, ''are my glasses or my screen dirty?''. Here it's more ''what's up with that meat and cheese here? Are they stale or something...?''\n\nEducate your eye by looking at food photographers IG like Dennistheprescott, Thebiteshot, fraiseetbasilic, scottchoucino, we.eat.together..., check this sub regularly, and buy some local food magazines and try to collect as much local restaurant flyers and menus to know what sells in your area and how you could inspire from what is being done. \n\nThat will help you to propose something a bit different but not so different that it would scare clients away. If your own style it dark atmosphere lighting, put some in your portfolio, but don't fill it with just that. Food photography is like commercial photography, you have to catter to what your client wants and need.\n\nWhen you'll have more experience and a more defined style, then you might be able to have clients come to you for your own style.\n\nTake all of this a grain of salt, it's just comments on ONE of your pics and advices that will be useful to you or not.

Burger shots can be very difficult.   \n\n\nI like dark and moody images but this lighting feels dark and flat (looks under exposed by about a stop). The pickles disappear, and there's not enough color in the tomatoes (maybe slide one out a bit more so we can see it better - same with the pickles).\n\nFries look dead (not fresh and crispy) - the styling of the fries with the big ones coming directly at the camera isn't good placement/styling - leaves a big visual hole on the front right side of the serving board. And idea would to possibly put them in a small dish, and get them standing in a more vertical serving, and move the ketchup to a smaller dish and bring it up front, breaking the barrier between the burger and the fries. If your'e going to make a pile of fries, then make a pile of fries. ...be thoughtful in how you place them on the serving the board. Everything on that board deserves the same attention as the burger.\n\nBurgers look delicious when they're juicy.

I photographed and art directed food photography for 12 years... and I love being on set.   \n\n\nA couple of things to think about when you're photographing food.  \n\n\n1) Make a hero - the salmon should be the hero here, and it's mostly covered up by the slices of the avocado. Slide the avocado back, so it's not covering up the entire piece of fish.   \n\n\n2) Less in more - when garnishing your food, don't cover everything in toppings. Let the food be seen through the minced cilantro, green onion, crumbled cheese and the sauce.   \n\n\n3) prop styling - choose your table and platings (bowls, plates) carefully. This bowl is a good size for the fish - most people choose too big of a plate or bowl, and the food looks too small. The table top is OK, but where you position the bowl batter. The strong horizontal line/seem at the bottom is distracting - it's not needed to ground the bowl in the photography. ...retouch some of the table dings/scratches out, and those crumbs as well. Find linens with different colors and patterns to create contrast, mood and texture to your sets.   \n\n\n4) lighting. This would have worked better if the lighting was more direction, rather than from directly overtop. The light glare behind the bowl is distracting, and in general creates a very flat quality of light. If you're at home, slide a table up next to a big window (preferably not in direct sunlight), and use that to start. You can bounce the light with white paper/foam core and modify the light white linens (to soften). Even a small window works, as it creates a more directional type of light."]}

You could experiment with portrait mode on your phone if you want MORE blur, just be prepared for wild weirdness since portrait mode doesn't always work the way you want with things that aren't people :) \n\nAlso, in the second picture with the seam, it's not level in the camera. If it was extremely off level because you were shooting the food from say a 45 degree angle to the side, that's one thing; with it slight, it just looks tilted.\n\nHaving just the broken oreos in the second picture looks like someone set some broken cookies down on a napkin and left them there. The first picture looks deliberate and attractively set up.\n\nAlso, try using something other than a purely white napkin for the cookies; perhaps a napkin with a design, or a dark or more interesting plate.", "I like the styling and composition of the first shot, but the pattern in the top left corner is distracting from the subject. The cookie in the very front is out of focus. I think it would look better if lit from camera left as most photos do (but this can be a western/eastern culture difference based on what direction you read from). \n\nThe second shot looks better in this regard but the seam of the backdrop is harsh and not straight so it lends a sloppy feel to the photo. You may want to try a different backdrop on the top vs bottom.", "Shot details are required with your image posts.

Since I really love the diagonal symmetry you used in this shot, I would suggest editing the pumpkin out and cropping the left side a bit so that the distance from the left edge of the photo to the left plate is the same as from the right edge of the photo to the right plate, that would balance the photo out. I also feel like the single pumpkin caused a bit of a color dysfunction in the photo. I would not use it in the shoot at all but if you must for the sake of storytelling (I assume, that is a pumpkin dessert) and you really want/need to show that, I would also add a couple of smaller pumpkins in the right bottom corner to balance the whole thing out. \n2. I feel like that tiny piece of cinnamon stick on the left side causes a bit of visual clutter.  For your next shoot I would try to not leave tiny tiny bits like that show and either eliminate it altogether or move it a bit more into the photo so that it is more visible like the other cinnamon sticks. It doesn't have to be out as much but just enough for it to not be a dark dot on the edge of the photo :) \n\nI hope that helps!"]}

(Most cameras have an included software available for tethered shooting with live view.) Take your time, whenever I am shooting the scene will progress into my vision over time, it rarely happens right away! \n\nOne suggestion is when shooting food lay out all of your props before the hero subject, as here with the meat. Layout the cutting board, the salt shaker, etc. setting up your shot before the steak so it doesn't dry out (or go bad if you plan on eating it) sitting under lights for a long time. That or try roughly sketching out how you want the image to look before starting and that can help you see the composition beforehand as well.\n\nOtherwise I think correcting your images white balance would help you as well.

Probably around $60 -$100. When using a light a good staring position would be to the side (Imagine it is the window). \n\nTry this trick next time you are shooting with your phone.

Start learning how to use the one light and take it from there. Get a softbox to soften the shadows with your light. Work on your angles and shoot as much as you can.\nDon't check Instagram. Everything looks the same there. Go grab some magazines where you have an easy reference. Pick up some magazines that feature the food you like to eat and are interested in. Look for inspiration and keep on shooting. It'll take you at least a year to get good.

Learn to play with light sources and you'll up your game to the max. Another thing to think about is your compositions. You have an overhead shot here and overheads can be a bit tricky despite how simple they seem. When composing an image I like to start with a sketch where I think about what shapes go where. Where do my circles go, where do my semicircles go, triangles rectangles etc. By working with those shapes you can style your food easier too, which you already seem to have a nack for. Watch out for harsh shadows and take notice of what's in your background because the food is the subject but the environment is what also makes the photograph."]}

I love how your chose the plants and the coffee cup to match the green! I also love that you have a great light source in all of your photos and how you used an odd number of cookies, you def have some experience with taking other amazing photos and it shows! The bitten cookie is a nice touch for storytelling too, love it!  \n\n\nIf you don't mind me being a little nitpicky, I think your photos can shine even more next time if you:  \n\\- increased the contrast in shadows! I love that you were going for a gentle, soft look, however I think the shadows specifically are too light. In the first photo, my eyes immediately fell onto the napkin because of how bright it is in contrast to the shadows. I think lowering your Whites and increasing your Blacks on whatever photo editing software you use will balance out the light!  \n\\- this is just a personal preference, but I prefer the white wood backdrop way more than the brown wood b/c the latter clashes with the white napkin. Shot 3 looks more cohesive to me because the napkin blends well with the white backdrop  \n\\- be careful about accidentally introducing other light sources! I think I can spot a warm kitchen(?) light on the right side for Shot 3. Don't forget to only have one light source if you're going for that bright airy atmosphere!  \n\\-  I think the grey plate looks a little out of place? Mostly because your color palette seems to be green, white, and brown in all of your photos and there's suddenly a blob of grey from the plate. I personally would have used a different color plate or omitted entirely by placing the cookies on lightly crinkled wax or parchment paper instead but that's just me.  \n\\- I think you can afford to add more props for story-telling! I personally like adding a few cookie crumbs strategically scattered around the cookies or other decorating props (such as a tiny bowl of the matcha sugar in the foreground or background to help with the story-telling as if you just finished decorating them)  \n\\- I would change the black coffee to matcha tea or just plain milk instead so the colors are more cohesive and it matches the recipe. But again that's just me, if you love coffee with these cookies then go for it!  \n\n\nHopefully that made sense! You're already getting a lot of the basics down and I have no doubt you'll improve very quickly, keep it up OP! Don't hesitate to shoot me a message if I wasn't very clear!"]}

I would set up a 35mm prime or a 50mm prime and have fun.", "The gear is secondary, it\u2019s all about the lighting.", "[deleted]", "Here are some tips from someone who just started their food photography journey a couple years ago.\n\n1. It really is all about the lighting. The best type of light I\u2019ve found is \u201cnatural-type\u201d light, and there are a few ways you can get it on the cheap. First, you can buy an inexpensive reflector on Amazon, place your food item near a window, and use the reflector to bounce back light to fill in shadows while you take the shot. This works bests at times of day when light is beautiful (early morning, golden hour, etc.)\n\n2. You can also buy a simple flash/softbox system from companies like Godox. Even if your camera doesn\u2019t support flash control out of the box, you can also buy a flash controller to attach to your hot shoe. Again, use this light to simulate a natural light source and use a reflector to remove/create pleasing shadow balances. Advantage is you aren\u2019t subject to natural light conditions to get your shot.\n\n3. If you can afford one, it\u2019s a big step up to replace your kit lens with a fixed focal length, fast aperture lens. The difference between a kit lens that can only get open to f3.5 and, say, a 35, 50, or 85mm fixed lens that can open to f2.8 or f1.8 is a massive difference in light gathering and pleasing bokeh, especially in low or poor light situations. Most camera manufacturers make a cheap fixie lens for most mounts, and this is an excellent \u201cbuy used\u201d candidate.\n\n4. Mess with composition. People get stuck on all the technicals and kind of ignore just how important what\u2019s actually in the photo mean for the end result. For baked goods, things like cutting boards, sugar or flour in strategic places, bowls of fruit or ingredients used in the baked goods, etc\u2026these all help build context and interest into the photo. Don\u2019t be afraid to experiment here. Use backdrops. Change locations. Get weird with it.\n\n5. Most important remember that it\u2019s all a learning process and nobody starts out taking amazing photos. Every day I\u2019m learning new techniques, gear settings, and editing tricks just by doing it over and over again.", "I like Joanie, she's a food photographer with a youtube channel calledThe Bite Shot. Her videos are great. \n\nI linked one of her videos from her \"lighting\" playlist below\n\n[2 awesome lighting tricks for food photography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlZyL2KUmh4&list=PLFsNwQS3ur2OVqfgw8pz7NzXl1H-rCOLG&index=3&ab_channel=TheBiteShot)\n\nI've also included a link to a video where she uses a Canon T2i and shows you how to take great pictures with it. The T2i and the Rebel T6 are pretty comparable, so I think a lot of the stuff she mentions would translate over for you.  \n\n[Food photography with a cheap camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZBaTgVvdaY&ab_channel=TheBiteShot)", "Thank you to everyone that took a few minutes out of your day to give me much needed advice.
