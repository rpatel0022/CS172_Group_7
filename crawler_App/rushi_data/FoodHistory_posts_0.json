{"title": "After research I now know \"The Founder (2016)\" was COMPLETELY inaccurate in depicting Ray Kroc's takeover of McDonald's", "selftext": "For the record, I do not work at McDonald's, I am not a McDonald's diehard fan (I actually much prefer Chick Fil A), and I am not a member of the Kroc family. Let's dive in.\n\nI watched \"The Founder (2016)\" and I really enjoyed it. It was a great story that showed one of the largest brands/companies on Earth had to start somewhere and was once a mom and pop shop just like any local business. It was also a great case study for future entrepreneurs. When I reached the ending of the movie my heart sank. I really felt for the McDonald brothers and was sad that their business was stolen from them from a shrewd and conniving businessman. At least, that's what I thought at the time. I since read extensively about the history of McDonald's and that is COMPLETELY FALSE.\n\nMuch of the movie was more or less accurate up until a certain point (with some small details being off, such as McDonald's having already been franchising extensively in California and Kroc mostly wanted to expand it to the Midwest, but that's fine I get the change from a narrative standpoint). The part when the movie went into full-on misleading or even fiction was when it depicted Kroc's purchase of McDonald's.\n\nThe 0.5% share in the profits was not an agreement in the sale, that was how much Kroc pledged to give the McDonald brothers for all his future McDonald restaurants outside of California. When it came to selling McDonald's to Kroc he gave the brothers $1.7M each so they could have $1M each after taxes, a HUGE sum at the time, equal to almost $10M today. The movie made it seem like Kroc was already this rich and powerful CEO and just handed the money over like it was nothing. In reality, Kroc actually did not have $3.4M to give at the time, as he was still focusing on expanding McDonald's and had a lot of debts, so he borrowed extensively to raise the money. He actually stated in an interview once that that $3.4M wound up costing him $10M. After this happened, the McDonald brothers later claimed they had a handshake agreement with Kroc to continue receiving 0.5% of future profits. Besides the fact that this was never in writing so it's pointless to discuss hearsay claims like this without proof, the McDonald brothers were mostly upset because they never knew McDonald's would become THAT big. They knew it would become a big chain but they never knew it would have 10K+ restaurants around the world and just how obscenely wealthy that 0.5% would have made them. So after the sale they became bitter and felt they had been cheated into selling the company.\n\nThe movie gets one thing accurate: The McDonald Brothers were not as ambitious as Kroc about expanding their business. They were relatively old during Kroc's growth of the company and they were already very wealthy (from their original California locations and from the 0.5% profits from Kroc's locations). The movie makes it seem like they were these aw shucks can-do-no-wrong heart of gold country boys, but the truth is they just wanted to sit back and coast and rake in passive income while Kroc did all the work. The movie is also accurate that Kroc legally had to get their approval to make changes to the restaurants (not milkshake powder though which btw was completely made up). The McDonald brothers though were so passive at this point that they almost never got back to him, so Kroc's hands were tied. They just kept holding all the keys to the castle and were pretty much content with coasting and raking in passive income. For more context, at the time of their sale of McDonald's to Kroc they had already been retired for two years, not still hustling around a kitchen like the movie depicts. Kroc basically begged them to sell the company to him (the blank check scene in the movie was real) and their relationship took a nosedive when they responded with exorbitant demands.\n\nNow was Ray Kroc a sad helpless victim? Of course not. He was still a shrewd cunning businessman. Was he a good man who could do no wrong? No. It is true that after the sale of McDonald's he intentionally opened a McDonald's across the street from their original San Bernadino restaurant to put it out of business. It was a very petty sensitive boo boo act, as he was mad that they made him go a further $10M into debt and would not give him the original location. It is also true that Kroc would not credit the original McDonald brothers as the founders of McDonald's, which was also petty at best and dishonest and deceitful at worst. But the depiction in the movie of Ray Kroc as a this cartoonish villain and the McDonald brothers as these two gullible nice country guys is absolutely false and everyone who watches the movie should keep in mind that it is a drama and not a documentary.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/zef1ut/after_research_i_now_know_the_founder_2016_was/", "created_utc": 1670353642.0, "score": 799, "author": "nanika1111", "num_comments": 135, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/zef1ut/after_research_i_now_know_the_founder_2016_was/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "What Was Beef Stroganoff Originally Served Over? (Commenting on locked post from r/AskCulinary", "selftext": "So the question was asked, and I started putting together an answer, only to find the comments locked when I tried to post. I assume that's because it's outside the scope of the sub, but haven't seen a mod confirm that yet. \n\nAt any rate, feel free to comment your findings and opinions, but darn it, I'm posting my original comment, because I think it's fun! Here it is: \n\nWhat was beef stroganoff originally served over? \n\n*very Gollum voice*\n\nPotato straws or nothing!!\n\n(Really, that's my understanding of the original or an early version of the dish. That it wasn't served *over* anything, because it was made for a man with no teeth, so was simply very tender beef in a creamy sauce, the end. But it was certainly served with potato straws in some early iterations, and this is still common in Russia)\n\nBut the iconic NYC Russian Tea Room served it over rice when they began serving the dish in the thirties. That is more provable than any of the origin stories, and probably was more influencial in the US than anything until Betty F-ing Crocker said, \"hit it, housewives.\" [Completely made up quote for dramatic effect, but we can assume it was one of the workhorse cookbooks ladies depended on from that era which popularized serving stroganoff over egg noodles]\n\n*Wide egg noodles.* An iconic food of the mid century dinner party. If you weren't moulding you an egg noodle ring while swilling a pre-dinner cocktail, you weren't living. I can't give you a date when the first recipe for a noodle ring made from pre-packaged wide egg noodles would've been published, but I've seen recipes for those as early as the forties. There's a Pennsylvania Dutch recipe for a homemade noodle version earlier than that, but I think that's about the earliest we saw mass produced egg noodles in the American kitchen. Correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nSo, in my 1950 first edition Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook, there are zero recipes for stroganoff. \n\nIn the 1965 edition of the Congressional Club Cookbook, there are no less than six. One makes no suggestion it should be served over anything at all. A few recommend fluffy rice. Two suggest wild rice. I was amused to read that one called for canned water chestnuts and asked that it be served over white rice with crispy Chinese noodles on top; horrified to find a \"Hawaiian\" version made of hamburger, a can of Chinese Chop Suey, and a can of pineapple chunks, which should all be cooked together (with no further seasoning) and served over Chinese Hard Noodles. Thanks, but no thanks, Mrs. La Vern R. Delwig.\n\nTo me, it seems likely that the two trends didn't manage to collide in the fifties - maybe not even till the later half of the sixties.\n\nMy dad, a late baby boomer born in '61, remembers my grandma using wide egg noodles in her Minnesota kitchen while cursing the Bolsheviks. It would likely have been from the '69 Betty Crocker. I take that as gospel, naturally.\n\nAll things considered, I think it went: nothing, potato straws, rice, egg noodles. But I can't prove that and I don't think anyone can. So I've just listed some touchstones for your edification.\n\nPlease enjoy this dish over whatever starch you like, but please, for the love of all that is good and holy, let's leave the canned pineapple in the cupboard for this one.

{"title": "Tim Walz's fast food campaign stop and the Volga Germans", "selftext": "Tim Walz stopped at a Nebraska fast food chain called Runza, and it's important enough to the campaign that they created a standalone video about it: [https://www.tiktok.com/@timwalz/video/7404541009268460843](https://www.tiktok.com/@timwalz/video/7404541009268460843)\n\nThe newsletter I run published an article last year that explains where this Runza sandwich comes from. (I edited the article but did not write it.) Posted here entirely, so as not to self-promote!  \n\n\"Whether you tuck into one at a Cornhusker football game or from one of 88 locations in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Colorado, the Runza sandwich, a savory stuffed bun from the fast-food chain of the same name, is pure Nebraska. To learn how it achieved its cult status, though, look to the 1700s. And Russia.\n\nIn\u00a0[1762 and 1763](https://www.volgagermans.org/history/manifesto), Catherine the Great invited foreign colonists to populate the expanding Russian empire. The offer especially tempted Germans,\u00a0[30,000](https://www.volgagermans.org/history/migration-russia)\u00a0of whom left their war-torn homes with the promise of military service exemption, the right to maintain their language and religion, and a 30-year tax exemption. Known as German Russians or Volga Germans, they farmed the expansive steppe along the Volga River. German Russians kept their food traditions, too, while incorporating techniques from their new climate.\u00a0\n\nOne of those foods became the foundation for Runza. Taking a cue from the Russian pirog, a savory, stuffed pie, German Russians created the pocket-sized bierock, known also as krautenruns, cabbage pies, kraut bierock, and Runzas. Russian savory pies abound, with the pirog \u2014 derived from the word pir, meaning feast \u2014 leading the pack. (Don\u2019t confuse pirogi \u2014 plural for pirog \u2014 with pierogi, the Polish dumplings, or pirozhki, the plural of pirozhok, the diminutive, handheld version of a pirog.)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201cRunzas were made for the men to take out into the fields to eat, so they wouldn\u2019t have to come back into town for the meals,\u201d says Pam Wurst, a member of the\u00a0[American Historical Society of Germans from Russia](https://ahsgr.org/), based in Lincoln, Neb. \u201cThe Russian versions were filled with potatoes and onions, mostly,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe Germans added cabbage and meat to them. Most of the time they left the potatoes out.\u201d\u00a0\n\n100 years later, as Russian nationalism grew, new legislation reversed Catherine\u2019s promises. Many of the Volga Germans immigrated to\u00a0[the United States](https://www.norkarussia.info/deportation-1941.html), which was seeking to colonize land gained during its own bloody expansion. Several settled in Nebraska, including the family of Sarah \u201cSally\u201d (Brening) Everett, born in Sutton in 1912. She grew up making savory pies filled with beef, cabbage, onions, and spices, so in 1949, when it was hard to find jobs after World War II, Everett coined the final spelling and pronunciation of the sandwiches and trademarked the Runza name, opening her first restaurant \u2014 a car hop stand \u2014 with her brother and brother-in-law.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOur best guess is there was a German word which was close, and she changed it enough to be able to be trademarked,\u201d says Becky Perrett, Runza\u2019s director of marketing. (Perhaps it was\u00a0[runsa](https://omaha.com/lifestyles/runza-the-story-of-one-of-nebraskas-most-treasured-foods/article_6e0b5a51-b017-5a23-b5cd-92f2c06a5d88.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRunza%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20version%20of,shape%20of%20a%20round%20belly), a low German word meaning \u201cbun shape.\u201d)\u00a0\n\n\u201cTo be a female entrepreneur in 1949,\u201d says Perrett, \u201cShe was ahead of her time.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe company is still run by the Everett family, with Sally\u2019s grandson, Donald Everett, Jr., serving as president.

{"title": "Philadelphia Cream Cheese DID come from Philly!!!", "selftext": "Is Philadelphia cream cheese from really Philadelphia? If you do a basic Google search, plenty of reputable articles from Today to Newsweek even the Philadelphia Inquirer (sadly) will say no. Wikipedia says no. Even a viral Reddit thread says no.\n\nBut that\u2019s completely and utterly wrong. \n\nLet me start by giving credit where credit is due (considering that\u2019s my bone to pick in this entire situation) \u2014 American cream cheese was \u201cinvented\u201d in New York State by William Lawrence in 1875. He found success in the market as one of the first producers of cream cheese, and expanded his operation throughout the 1890s. He even tacked on the moniker \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d to his product to associate it with the established, flourishing dairy market in the Philadelphia and surrounding Pennsylvania areas. \n\nThe William Lawrence Company eventually became known as the Phenix Cheese Company, and was bought out by the Kraft Corporation in 1928. Tha t seems the be where the story stops right? Totally wrong. This is really a multi-pronged story in the saga of cream cheese.\n\nRemember how I said Philadelphia had a flourishing dairy market? Well, Philly was well known in the 1870s and onward for their butter, cream, and other dairy products. So much so, surrounding cities in the Mid-Atlantic area would seek out Philadelphia-made dairy products for their grocery stores. Places like Washington DC, Baltimore, and Atlantic City were all clambering to stock Philly dairy products.\n\nThe most popular butter in the 1880s (according to articles and advertisements in the Atlantic City Gazette-Review, the Daily Republican, Evening Star, the Philadelphia Times, Newport Daily News, the Evening Journal, Press of Atlantic City, etc.) was \u201cSharpless Gilt-Edge Butter\u201d or \u201cSharpless Philadelphia Butter\u201d(Philadelphia was added to the name in 1890). It came from a creamery on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and its reputation greatly preceded itself. According to the Philadelphia Times in 1888, Sharpless gilt-edge butter was \u201cthe most delicious addition to the feast of good things\u201d and consumers would \u201cnever put tongue to anything so toothsome.\u201d The butter was so popular, it was reportedly used at the White House, according to the Lancaster Examiner in 1902, where they write: \u201cThe Sharpless butter is In great demand in Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, and Washington. Butter used at the White House is made by Sharpless.\u201d \n\nThe Sharpless Creamery grew under the ownership of Pennock Edwards Sharpless, a native Pennsylvanian and son of a prominent local dairy farmer, William Sharpless. He moved his creamery to Ward Village, Concord Township, PA in 1893, where he produced many dairy products from butter, condensed milk, pimento cheese, and most importantly \u2014 cream cheese! The creamery burned down in June 1900 due to an arson attack, but was immediately rebuilt. In 1904, Sharpless Creamery was fully incorporated as a domestic business corporation (#326461) and mass producing dairy products for sale all around the mid-Atlantic region. In 1910, the New York Produce Review and American Creamery notes that \u201cJohn B. Fassler, head cheesemaker of the P.E. Sharpless Company plant at Ward, Delaware County reports daily receipts of 16,000 lbs. milk. Of this over half is made up into Neufchatel and Philadelphia cream cheese, the remaining goes into condensed milk.\u201d Sharpless used the moniker \u201cPhiladelphia cream cheese\u201d on his tinfoil packaged cream cheese cakes, and examples of advertisements can been seen in every major newspaper at the time in this region (Atlantic City Gazette-Review, Daily Republican, Evening Star, The Philadelphia Times, Newport Daily News, The Evening Journal, Press of Atlantic City, Delaware County Daily Times, Lancaster New Era, Denton Journal, Asbury Park Press, The Washington Post, Harrisburg Telegraph, The Virginian-Pilot, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Reading Times, etc.). The Sharpless Creamery also turned to the fluid milk business in 1922, when they consolidated with the Breyer Ice Cream Company to create the Breyer-Sharpless Milk Association. The Ice Cream Review of 1922 notes that \u201cThe Breyer Company confined itself to the manufacture of ice cream previous to the consolidation, while the Sharpless firm have long been known as manufacturers of fancy print butter and package cheese, as well as condensed and evaporated milk.\u201d So basically, the Sharpless Creamery had the Philadelphia dairy market cornered!\n\nThe reality of the cream cheese boom at the turn of the 20th century was that there were only 5 major creameries making and selling cream cheese: Phenix Company and F.X. Baumert Company in New York, Kraft Company and Blue Label Cream Cheese Company in Chicago, and the P.E. Sharpless Creamery in the Philadelphia area, according to the 1954 court case Kraft Foods Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It goes on to state that \u201cno other concerns, with the possible exception of one or two small ones, made and sold cream cheese commercially in the United States at that time.\u201d Out of the 5 companies, the P.E. Sharpless Creamery was the only geographically authentic Philadelphia cream cheese company!\n\nWilliam A. Lawrence & Son (aka Phenix) sued the Sharpless Creamery in 1913 over misleading advertising on their cream cheese packaging and won, which can be read in Lawrence et al. v. P.E. Sharpless Co. Sharpless was using a cow with blue lettering and tinfoil packaging on their products, the same as Lawrence/Phenix. This didn\u2019t slow Sharpless\u2019 role though.\n\nThe Sharpless Company went on to obtain three U.S. patents on their process of making soft cheese (patent # 1,258,438) and packaging (patent # 1,399,270 and 1,466,380) beginning in 1918, 1921, and 1923. Two patents in 1937 covering the manufacture of cream cheese (patent #2,098,764 and 2,098,765) were given to Pennock Edwards Sharpless\u2019 son, Caspar Sharpless, who became the general manager of the still-operating Sharpless plant in Ward after the sale to Kraft Company. \n\nIn 1924, Kraft Company purchased the P.E. Sharpless Creamery and all assets, including their patents. Kraft continued using the Sharpless name on their dairy products (likely for name recognition), until 1941 when Kraft trademarked the \u201cPhiladelphia Brand\u201d moniker (trademark registration #0392212). Kraft also purchased the Phenix Cheese Company in 1928, combining the two once-warring \u201cPhiladelphia cream cheese\u201d brands. Of course, Kraft Company is the business that makes and sells Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese today. So to say that Philadelphia brand cream cheese does NOT come from or have roots in the Philadelphia region is outright wrong. The P.E. Sharpless Company, now absorbed by the Kraft Company along with Phenix, was the only commercial creamery corporation in the Philadelphia area making tried and true, authentic Philadelphia cream cheese at the turn of the century. Any other business that used the moniker \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d cream cheese were doing so in association only. The Sharpless Creamery was the true Philadelphia cream cheese brand. \n\nThank you for attending my cream cheese lecture.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/12ug2ta/philadelphia_cream_cheese_did_come_from_philly/", "created_utc": 1682106700.0, "score": 8, "author": "UnusualAd7417", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/12ug2ta/philadelphia_cream_cheese_did_come_from_philly/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How come people were willing to kill each other in the past over delicious foods? Even as far as mere condiments like food spices? Was food that terrible back than?", "selftext": "I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken, and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living. The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......\n\nA bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.\n\nIn addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which \"Ninja Chefs\" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. \n\nThe project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.\n\nThese two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.\n\nThe first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. \n\nAnd what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.\n\nHell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!\n\nIn addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:\n\n\"Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death\".\n\nHe explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.\n\nHell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.\n\nI am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?\n\nCan anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!\n\nWhat is the logic behind this? Why did historical peoples act this way?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/cbk3d1/how_come_people_were_willing_to_kill_each_other/", "created_utc": 1562781754.0, "score": 4, "author": "SaturnineSasuke", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/cbk3d1/how_come_people_were_willing_to_kill_each_other/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Why did ice cream trucks used to be so common esp in the suburbs and urban places?", "selftext": "I was playing Grand Theft Auto 2 and a mission involving stealing ice cream trucks and taking it to some underground syndicate wasin the game. IIRC also from years ago that in one of the sequels, Vice City, there was a mission where you pedestrians would come to your truck to buy ice cream while you also had to avoid the attention of the police. I'm also reminded of the scene from Assault on Precinct 13 (the original JOhn Carpneter one, not the horrible remake by a French director) of the scene where an elderly man and his grand daughter approaching an ice cream truck to buy treats, unaware that gangs have tken it over, and the chilling scene where the innocent girl is simply awaiting at the indow when she gets shot right in front of her grandpa.\n\nSo this makes me wonder. Why was ice cream trucks so common in the past in particular for suburbs and a big city? In my city, which is a small one and in one of the more isolated rural states in the country (not Southern just as an FYI) I enver seen an ice cream truck growing up in the main city proper. So we had to either buy ice cream from the K Mart or Walmart or local grocery story or walk to the nearest ice cream eatery.

I understand Europe's colder climate often kills of worms and germs associated with pig diseases. But what about Latin America where half of the world's Christian population live in and traditionally had pork as a common meat because of its ease in raising as livestock? Latin America often reach the average heats found in desert countries (and often surpass it!) but it also even has the added problems of humid and wet environment perfect for bacteria to thrive in! Yet no on there gets sick from pig diseases such as trichinosis!\n\nIf the scientific theory behind Islam and Judaism's prohibition of pork is because of diseases, why doesn't South America, traditionally a hotbed of Catholicism and pork cuisine, suffer from the diseases ancient Hebrews and Muslims often got from eating pork (which led to the prohibition in the first place)?\n\nI mean the theory is that its the hot environment of the deserts of the Middle East that caused trichinosis and other pork related diseases because it made it a thriving environment for worms and germs to grow in pigs as well as the stuff pigs ate in the deserts.

I've no doubt it is an invention, but I thought you'd appreciate it.\n\nThe contributor claimed this was found in an ancient site in Tabasco:\n\nPlace 3 pared and quartered chayotes, or mango-squash, in a basin and pour 1 pint water mixed with 1 cup pear vinegar and some salt over them. Let them stand for 2 hours. Cut one wild hen turkey (choose a 6- to 8-pound hen if you are not lucky enough to get a wild turkey) into 8 parts, and saut\u00e9 the pieces with 1 onion, sliced, in 2 tablespoons butter for about 10 minutes. Now pour 1 cup soup stock into the pan and add 1 clove of garlic, minced, and 3 bay leaves, broken into tiny pieces. Stew all this gently until the turkey is tender and then add the drained chayotes. Cook the chayotes with the turkey until they are tender and slip off the fork. Serve with any green vegetable.

{"title": "The story of the Mediterranean Diet - chapter one: The prehistoric man tastes the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and develops agriculture", "selftext": "\r\nLet's go back 13,000 years in time. \"Just\" before the Ice Age ended. Will you be shocked to learn that you are familiar with the local flora and fauna? For instance, you might be shocked to find bears and leopards in Andalusia or lions and crocodiles in the southern Levant, but these are familiar creatures. The environment, which included several trees, shrubs, and forage herbs, also bore a striking resemblance to the Mediterranean landscape that surrounds us now.\n\r\nIf we were to arrive at a settlement or cave of hunter-gatherers, we would discover that the food, even if it looks a bit different, is not far from what we know today: olives, figs, almonds, grapes, acorns, lentils, wheat and barley seeds \u2013 all were part of the diet of ancient humans. Sometimes, meat consumption was high \u2013 about 50% of the total food, and occasionally low \u2013 about 20% or even less.  \n\nFor instance, even though there was an abundance of game in their surroundings 16,000 years ago, the hunter-gatherer community that lived in northern Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria was nearly exclusively vegetarian. Or, for example, populations of Natufian culture in the southern Levant, some of which relied on a plant-rich diet, and others on a much more meat-based diet, with only a few dozen kilometers separating them.\n\r\nIn this ancient world, which botanically and zoologically resembled our world today, the seeds of the greatest change humanity would undergo on Earth are beginning to sprout. A change that occurred independently at least six times in human history: in the Fertile Crescent, in China, in the Indus Valley, in Central America, in South America, and the Sahel south of the Sahara \u2013 the development of agriculture.\n\r\nThe southern Levant, where generations of Natufian culture have been turning grain (wheat and barley) into flour, will be the first place to undergo change. The Natufians in the Levant, like their contemporaries in North Africa, stored cereal grains and replanted some of them to ensure food supply in the future. Despite the climatic changes during the transition from the Ice Age to the Neolithic period, there is no evidence of mass extinction or abandonment of habitats \u2013 neither of the Natufian culture, nor their distant relatives in North Africa, nor of the animals or the vegetation. Life continues. \n\r\nTherefore, it is still a mystery why in North Africa they did not advance to the domestication of plants and animals, while in the southern Levant, they did. What led the Natufians to invest in agriculture? Maybe one day we'll know. And maybe never. But one thing is clear:\r\nThe great drama, of the transition from hunting and gathering to the domestication of plants that will serve us, begins!\n\r\nWheat and barley were the first to be domesticated. By means of deliberate improvement and selective breeding, our prehistoric ancestors selected grain with large ears, easily cut stalks, and seeds that did not disperse when ripe. This is just the beginning of an extraordinary agricultural development \u2013 in the post-Ice Age Southern Levant, flax, peas, lentils, fava beans, chickpeas, and bitter vetch were also domesticated \u2013 completing the staple crops of the transition to agriculture.\n\r\nGrapes (probably with parallel domestication at the same time in the Caucasus) and olives were domesticated about 4000 years later, in the 6th millennium BCE. After them, figs and dates will also be domesticated in the southern Levant (with parallel domestication of dates in southern Mesopotamia (present-day southern Iraq) and the eastern Arabian Peninsula). \n\r\n\"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground...\" (Genesis 3:19). \n\r\nAccording to the Torah, the divine punishment for eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is the toil of the ground. When God expels Adam and Eve from Eden, He grants them the knowledge to till the land, but they (and we follow them) will work hard to grow bread from it.\n\r\nThis hard work will bring about a new era. The dedication to agricultural work will lead to the development of cities, the emergence of the royal class, the creation of bureaucracy, taxation, and control over trade, which in turn will lead to the invention of writing...And from here, everything is history.\n\r\nThe grain, along with other staple crops, will spread like wildfire throughout the Mediterranean. Immigrant populations from the Levant will bring the knowledge and technique of plant cultivation south to Egypt, east to the Fertile Crescent, north to Asia Minor, and from there west to Crete, the Peloponnese, and Macedonia, Italy, and the western shores of the Iberian Peninsula. From there, the grain will spread south to North Africa. \n\r\nIn total, 3000 years since the end of the Ice Age, wheat and barley have been growing all around the Mediterranean. From now until today, they will form the basis of the diet around the Mediterranean.\n\r\nLike grain, other crops also spread quickly through the same trade and migration routes along the southern coasts of Europe. The sea levels after the Ice Age were dozens of meters lower, allowing for island hopping. in this way, For example, wheat, barley, fava beans, and even livestock arrived in Crete 9,000 years ago. \n\r\nBut this flourishing comes to an end with the rise in sea levels at the end of the Neolithic period, about 7000 years before our time. The agriculture of the Mediterranean is almost lost, and the population around the Mediterranean will return to relying on hunting and gathering. \n\r\nBut the knowledge was not lost. Agriculture survived the catastrophe and returned to the starting line, ready for the race that would make it the leader of humanity.\n\r\nIn the next chapter: from a great crisis to a golden age \u2013 the collapse of ancient civilizations and the emergence of new ones, that will transform the Mediterranean into a huge agricultural unit.\r\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/1gnaqo3/the_story_of_the_mediterranean_diet_chapter_one/", "created_utc": 1731160912.0, "score": 2, "author": "oliveoilworldexpert", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/1gnaqo3/the_story_of_the_mediterranean_diet_chapter_one/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I now wonder did people even leave an oven wide open as the food was being cooked during a winter night in the 19th century and other olden times? Or if soldiers stayed around a chef as he was frying good outdoors  for an army camp? during the American Revolution? And other uses of cooking devices to keep warm like putting hands in front of the evaporating air from a kettle pot boiled on a fire outdoors after some peasant farmers hunted down wolves in Medieval England?\n\nI ask historically was it normal to do what I just did to keep warm esp during winter?

{"title": "Why have bars become well-rounded relaxation places in contrast to other drinking and eating places like cafes and fine dining restaurants?", "selftext": "Not only are billiard tables and darts become industry requirements for running a bar, but plenty and plenty of bars have a karaoke system and coin operated jukebox in place as well as a small stage for a guest singer or band. Its also pretty common for many bars to have a few arcade cabinets, a dedicated table or two for playing recreational poker, perhaps a pinball machine and one of those punching score thingy. The larger bars may have a small section if not separate room for dancing and at least in bigger towns and within the city hookah pipes are also pretty common. Some of the more night time bars even feature clothed women doing lewd dances for money! On top of air hockey and foosball also becoming more common in North American bars (with foosball being as standard a feature as billiards and darts in Europe and Latin America). The more high class bars even have a separate lounge with couches and a couple of book shelves and magazine stacks. Perhaps a tennis table. Don't get me started on multiple TVs featuring sporting events and how many of them also offer regular food including actual cooked meals. Some might even have a DJ playing around with vinyls and CDs. Hell gambling machines have started being placed in bars too more and more frequently.\n\nSo I gotta ask. Why have bars become pretty well-rounded chilling places with a wide multiple different entertainment options? Why didn't other eating and drinking establishments like 5 star restaurants grow to become as well-rounded as fun places? In particular I ask about cafes since many of them frequently feature guest bands and singers just like bars do but almost never have karaoke systems unlike bars!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/1af3ylk/why_have_bars_become_wellrounded_relaxation/", "created_utc": 1706660220.0, "score": 2, "author": "YMCALegpress", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/1af3ylk/why_have_bars_become_wellrounded_relaxation/", "html_title": ""}

That there was a time when hotdog carts were not unusual to see even in isolated small towns in rural places like Arkansas and Wyoming in the main commercial district of a town (where the few shops that exist along witht he church, library, police department, and mayor's office were located).\n\nWhile the days of hotdog cart endors as a ubiqitious thing in America is long gone, major cities still have them. So much that they might even make the majority of the food carts in a certain neighbhorhood block or street.\n\nSo I'm curious why were they so common in the past and still remains so easy to find in the biggest urban centers of the country? Why are burger carts and pizza carts and most other popular foods not as common to see around both today and back in the past when food carts were so numerous across the USA?

{"title": "I don't remember where I read this", "selftext": "In my culinary school education I dove deep into random awesome history facts that seem lost/forgotten/ never practiced.  But I remember reading about someone traveling through the southern coastal boarders of Asia and the South East Asian islands talking about the lush vegetation and the indigenous peoples love for nature's bounty.  One of which is citrus particularly lime.  Explorer writes how fantastic it is and describes how the natives eat it like a sauce on other foods, how for babies is used as a pacifier, and how they cut it.  Now what strikes me is that he describes the lime being cut on a bias that means if you find the lateral line (north south)  you tilt the lime 45 degrees left or right (not rolling it) and cut, that's how the natives cut them.  Now fast forward current day, I discovered that when you do so, you cut straight through the compartment membranes of the lime exposing the pulp.  You get twice as much juice when you squeeze it cause now there's no membrane holding the juices in.  I see chefs with Michelin stars, tv, and local dope restaurants that send out citrus with membrane (cutting vertical/lateral) and it's disheartening sometimes.  Kinda like being cursed with ocd about saying \"BEHIND\" or \"CORNER\" and thinking anyone who doesn't say it regardless of being in a kitchen is an asshole or an idiot.  So I guess this turned into a rant, psa, and a little history.

{"title": "Punch", "selftext": "\"PUNCH is a beverage made of various spirituous liquors or wine, hot water, the acid juice of fruits, and sugar. It is considered to be very intoxicating; but this is probably because the spirit, being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the sugar, its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it really is. Punch, which was almost universally drunk among the middle classes about fifty or sixty years ago, has almost disappeared from our domestic tables, being superseded by wine. There are many different varieties of punch. It is sometimes kept cold in bottles, and makes a most agreeable summer drink. In Scotland, instead of the Madeira or sherry generally used in its manufacture, whiskey is substituted, and then its insidious properties are more than usually felt. Where fresh lemons cannot be had for punch or similar beverages, crystallized citric acid and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the same thing. In the composition of \"Regent's punch,\" champagne, brandy, and veritable Martinique are required; \"Norfolk punch\" requires Seville oranges; \"Milk punch\" may be extemporized by adding a little hot milk to lemonade, and then straining it through a jelly-bag. Then there are \"Wine punch,\" \"Tea punch,\" and \"French punch,\" made with lemons, spirits, and wine, in fantastic proportions. But of all the compounds of these materials, perhaps, for a summer drink, the North-American \"mint julep\" is the most inviting. Captain Marryat gives the following recipe for its preparation:\u2014\"Put into a tumbler about a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint; upon them put a spoonful of white sugar, and equal proportions of peach and common brandy, so as to fill up one third, or, perhaps, a little less; then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the tumbler. Epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh pineapple; and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted outside with stalactites of ice. As the ice melts, you drink.\" The Virginians, say Captain Marryat, claim the merit of having invented this superb compound; but, from a passage in the \"Comus\" of Milton, he claims it for his own country.\"\nThe Book of Household Management\nMrs. Isabella Beeton, published 1861", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/7qkm8r/punch/", "created_utc": 1516032513.0, "score": 2, "author": "Olivesplace", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/7qkm8r/punch/", "html_title": ""}

Like, are we talking about noodles in general, or specifically spaghetti as we know it today, with the long strands and all that? And if spaghetti isn't technically ancient, can it still be considered a modern adaptation of something ancient? Or does the way we eat it today, with tomato sauce and stuff, make it more of a modern invention? Basically, I'm curious\u2014how far back does the concept of spaghetti really go, and at what point do we draw the line between ancient and modern food?\"\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/1ikyu2a/is_spaghetti_ancient_food/", "created_utc": 1739051872.0, "score": 0, "author": "Curious_Place659", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/1ikyu2a/is_spaghetti_ancient_food/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Why doesn't Japan have a tradition of dog meat and in turn avoids the canine controversy in the rest of Asia (esp China)?", "selftext": "Having read the article of the dog festival in China and the kidnappings of local pets to supply for the dog dishes, I am quite curious why Japan is quite unique in that it never developed dog dishes as a tradition or even a thriving underground delicacy?\n\nI mean even other Asian countries that make dog meat taboo and illegal such as the Philippines and Indonesia has underground markets that cook dog meat. They may not be mainstream and indeed these countries have a tradition of taboo dog meat because the populace sees dog as disgusting to cook and eat, but somehow subcultures and regions even in these countries have it thriving enough to at least have a big feast and some small places in these countries' outskirt may even eat dog daily (despite the main nations' culture being anti-dog meat).\n\nConsidering all of Japan's nearby neighbor across the East Asian stratosphere still have restaurants that openly sell cook dog without facing controversy, how come Japan never went this path? I mean I wouldn't be surprised if there are Yakuza and other criminal groups who engage in a black market dog trade with something like a small isolated mountain community of less than 100 does eat dog and maybe a household in the forest regions eat dog secretly........ But an entire subculture or even regions of over 200+ people (often reaching thousands as Indonesia and Philippines) people eating it for a yearly delicacy? I haven't heard anything like this in Japan.\n\nIndeed even before modernization, as early as Imperial Japan doesn't seem to have this dish in contrast to Korea, China, and the rest of East Asia. Even culinary documentaries I watched on Asia don't mention dog being delicacy in Japan while they frequently highlight dog on menu in China and Korea and local holidays eating dog meat, etc.\n\nWhy is this?

{"title": "Is it true that food in an unopened container in a landfill (such as hotdogs sealed in the same package from its supermarket life) can survive over 20 years without decomposition? If so, why don't we have any historical foods surviving from centuries ago in air sealed containers?", "selftext": "Yesteday I helped my aunt prepare and store food to be used in my dad's promotion to Colonel in the National Guard Airforce (which took place today). As we were clearing the van before we stored food, my auntie found a bunch package of Chinese meatbuns (the white kind that with soft smooth texture that often comes with a paper sticker under them). My aunt was like \"I bought those 4 months ago and couldn't find it!\". We sadly had to throw it since its obviously now bad. But there was something peculiar about it. Despite being under the hot sun in a vehicle for the whole summer, it did not melt into a liquid pile of goo. Not only that, there was no sign of mould or discoloration and ohter associated things with food spoilage. From what I could smell of it from outside the sealed bag , it did not smell bad at all but had the smell so associated with that kind of white bread the Chinese use for their native cake and bread products. I could not smell the meat inside but the fact I couldn't detect anything typically like rotting meat amazed me so much.\n\nThis reminds me of a project I did in middle school where we had to research stuff related to trash and waste management. Is tumbled upon an article from a major news paper (can't remember the name but its a big brand name in the same league as say New York Times and People Magazine). It said something about unopened hot dog still in their plastic sealed containers being found in landfills from 20 years ago looking like in new considtion without discoloration nor did it have a strong scent that should have been apparent because of being refigerated so long even if its in a unopened package. The article emphasized that along with being in factory condition package, since it was in a garbage bag and hidden so long deep in over 50 feet high of a pile of trrash, it could not get oxygen and thus failed to decompose because no microbes were interating with the food.\n\nThe article was written around 1987 meaning that the aforementioned hotdogs and other trash it was commenting on would have been produced in the 1960s decade, To this day I still could not believe the article's claims despite being written by some big name professor or scientist (might have been both) who's in the field of evironmentalist and was doing some project for a university at the time the article was published..........\n\nBut seeing the Chinese meat buns not change at all despite being unrefigrated and outdoors during the hot summers (in even hotter temperature because it was stuck inside a car trunk the whole time) reminded me about that article.......\n\nNow the first major question since I cannot believe it. Is this all possible that sealed food thrown into the center of a bunch of garbage would not be able to composee due to lack of oxygen and in turn lack of germs and other invisible tiny living things especially if its been thrown inside a tied plastic bag ortrash bag or something similar? I still am having difficulty beleiving this is actually real. Now the second question, how long until the food getst ot the point of disappearing? 6 centuries? A thousand years? 3 milennias? A whole eon of a million years or more? Now last and most of all, if food can survive so long without decomposition for decades, how come we don't have easily perishable food from the mid 1800s or even from World War 1 in a surviving state? Sealing food in a cloth, paper, ardboard, wooden box, and even modern day plastic wrapper seal has been in eistence since the late 19th century. Furthermore landfills were already a thing after the Industrial Revolution with places like N the Northern states having problems with running out of space in some ities and towns because of the heaps of trash piling up already shortly after the American Civil War. Landfills just became more and more as technology advanced before World War 1 at the even of the 1900s. The existing amount of open lands being used to pile more and more trash has boosted up even further after WWII. So I'm wondering why don't we have surviving ground beef hidden in a trash pile in Germany thats been wrapped in a cylander plastic dated container dated from 1922 hidden in some landfill in operation for 90s years? Why aren't there some ancient sausage linked wrapped in paper cloth in early trashbags in a landfill thats been in operation since 1879? Since piels of trash limit oxygen and can cause hotdogs to survive so long for decades, not to mention the Chinese meatbuns in my Auntie's trunks surviving one whole hot summer without decaying into a different state, why don't we have surviving food especially whose in plastic air sealed wraps from the 19th and early 20th centuries in very old landfills?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodHistory/comments/16ejzms/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "created_utc": 1694301246.0, "score": 0, "author": "CamelIllustrations", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodHistory/comments/16ejzms/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "A&W Lying?", "selftext": "So, I have been on a bit of an adventure within Google search. I was studying the history of soft drinks (soda/pop/tonic/coke, etm), and eventually happened upon contradictory accounts of when A&W started.\n\nIn 1919, Roy W. Allen opened a root beer stand in Lodi. 4 years later, he partnered with Frank Wright to officially form and open the first A&W in Sacramento. These are both facts.\n\nHowever, A&W, among many other sources, erroneously claim that the official start of the company was in 1919, in Lodi. It is factually incorrect, since it was not A&W in 1919, as Allen & Wright hadn't partnered up yet.\n\nNow, I can accept if what is meant is that the start-up Allen had made in 1919 was licensed and officially a business, and then when he brought Wright onboard, he filed paperwork to change the name. That's fine, and it would make some sense. However, that's not the gist of what it comes across as saying *and* it doesn't make sense. From how they word it, they should be saying that A&W was founded in 1923.\n\n\nI'll admit, I think I know why they potentially lie about 1919, as it's likely that they wish to hold onto the title of \"first American fast food franchise\", which they'd lose to White Castle (1921).
