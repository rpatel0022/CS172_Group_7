Just to give some context, their family all came from Kilis in what was then the Ottoman Empire. My family calls the dish \"bourton jajukh.\" Obviously it is called a jajukh because of the yogurt , but nobody remembers what \"bourton\" means. \n\nTo make this dish, cubed meat is boiled in chicken stock with some added garlic powder. Growing up, we used chicken, but in the past it was probably lamb. When the meat is cooked, it gets ladled into bowls, and the soup is mixed with yogurt. Sumac is sprinkled on top to add a tart, citrus-like flavor. Finally, pieces of crusty bread that are either stale or baked dry are put into the soup to soak it up. \n\nIf anybody out there feels like making it, the recipe is very simple, but the six ingredients work together very well. Warms your bones on a winter day. \n\nThere are many recipes from the region that are similar, but none that I can find really use this specific combination of ingredients, and I have not been able to find a recipe with the name. \n\nIs this something that would be familiar to Armenians in any part of the world, or is it likely to be a true family recipe?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmenianFood/comments/197f2yn/family_recipe_unclear_origin/", "created_utc": 1705341499.0, "score": 3, "author": "Anfechtung1525", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/ArmenianFood/comments/197f2yn/family_recipe_unclear_origin/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Just to give some context, their family all came from Kilis in what was then the Ottoman Empire. My family calls the dish \"bourton jajukh.\" Obviously it is called a jajukh because of the yogurt , but nobody remembers what \"bourton\" means. \n\nTo make this dish, cubed meat is boiled in chicken stock with some added garlic powder. Growing up, we used chicken, but in the past it was probably lamb. When the meat is cooked, it gets ladled into bowls, and the soup is mixed with yogurt. Sumac is sprinkled on top to add a tart, citrus-like flavor. Finally, pieces of crusty bread that are either stale or baked dry are put into the soup to soak it up. \n\nIf anybody out there feels like making it, the recipe is very simple, but the six ingredients work together very well. Warms your bones on a winter day. \n\nThere are many recipes from the region that are similar, but none that I can find really use this specific combination of ingredients, and I have not been able to find a recipe with the name. \n\nIs this something that would be familiar to Armenians in any part of the world, or is it likely to be a true family recipe?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmenianFood/comments/197f2yn/family_recipe_unclear_origin/", "created_utc": 1705341499.0, "score": 3, "author": "Anfechtung1525", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/ArmenianFood/comments/197f2yn/family_recipe_unclear_origin/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Just to give some context, their family all came from Kilis in what was then the Ottoman Empire. My family calls the dish \"bourton jajukh.\" Obviously it is called a jajukh because of the yogurt , but nobody remembers what \"bourton\" means. \n\nTo make this dish, cubed meat is boiled in chicken stock with some added garlic powder. Growing up, we used chicken, but in the past it was probably lamb. When the meat is cooked, it gets ladled into bowls, and the soup is mixed with yogurt. Sumac is sprinkled on top to add a tart, citrus-like flavor. Finally, pieces of crusty bread that are either stale or baked dry are put into the soup to soak it up. \n\nIf anybody out there feels like making it, the recipe is very simple, but the six ingredients work together very well. Warms your bones on a winter day. \n\nThere are many recipes from the region that are similar, but none that I can find really use this specific combination of ingredients, and I have not been able to find a recipe with the name. \n\nIs this something that would be familiar to Armenians in any part of the world, or is it likely to be a true family recipe?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ArmenianFood/comments/197f2yn/family_recipe_unclear_origin/", "created_utc": 1705341499.0, "score": 3, "author": "Anfechtung1525", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/ArmenianFood/comments/197f2yn/family_recipe_unclear_origin/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
