I was going to build the grill myself but I found a nice Santa Maria grill on eBay from Argentina. The table is fun because it\u2019s modular and I can build a small yakitori grill or an oven to bake some wood fire dessert. My goal was to replicate the grill at Asador Etxebarri.

I'm now looking to buy a wireless meat thermometer that can allow me to see the temperature from afar and get alarms when the desired temperature is reached.\n\nI've read a lot of reviews these days and, while I would like to go for a Typhur Sync with 4 probes, at 300 Euro it's quite expensive. I know I could go for the Typhur with 2 probes also, but I'd like 4. While browsing, I found the ThermoMaven P4 (Amazon link below) that is just over half the price of the Typhur while having very similar features. I found (mostly via Reddit) that the mother company is Typhur, and they might use similar technology. \n\nNevertheles, other than Amazon, I can barely find this product elsewhere. On Amazon, most of the reviews are positive, but I find it suspicious that they mostly are too positive. I did find a few reviews on YouTube, but they are from unknown channels and generally pretty short. The few Reddit mentions are generally overusing the name of the manufacturer, which could be a tactic for having this show up in search results.\n\nTo sum it all up, the product looks good, and I can always return it if I purchase it from Amazon. It does, however, look suspicious (to me, at least) because of the lack of reviews or reviews and comments that might be bots. Am I paranoid? Did anyone else try this product?

{"title": "6 Weeks In: Thoughts on the Typhur Sync Gold", "selftext": "Been smoking and grilling for years, and honestly, getting accurate temps is non-negotiable for me. I\u2019ve tried all kinds of built-in probes and third-party thermometers, but nothing I\u2019ve used really compares to this thing. If you care about both function and aesthetics in your setup, the Typhur Sync Gold delivers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s stood out so far:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Accuracy and control: Temps have been dead on every time. Whether I\u2019m cooking fish, brisket, steak, you name it. It even tracks ambient temp, which is new for me, and the 5-point probe setup lets me monitor different spots in the meat at once.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Super easy to use: The interface is really straightforward. All the smart features are there without feeling like you need a manual just to cook dinner.\n\n\\- Build quality: It\u2019s got this slick gold finish and feels solid - definitely has that premium vibe if you\u2019re into nice gear.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Heats up fast: Big win for me since I\u2019m impatient.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Wireless connection\u2019s rock solid: Honestly might be my favorite part. No wires tangling up my setup, and I can wander around the house without losing connection on WiFi/Bluetooth.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCouple things to note:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- It ain\u2019t cheap: Not gonna lie, it\u2019s a bit pricey. But imo totally worth it if you take your cooking seriously.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Bit of a learning curve: Some of the advanced features took me minutes to figure out, but the app and tutorials helped. (Small gripe: wish the app would put temp alerts and controls more front-and-center instead of burying them under recipes.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBottom line:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you care about precision and want your cooks dialed in, the Typhur Sync Gold\u2019s seriously worth a look. Setup\u2019s easy, accuracy\u2019s on point, connection\u2019s solid. Definitely an A+ from me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd3ty0", "created_utc": 1746199768.0, "score": 2, "author": "Ttrip66", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1kd3ty0/6_weeks_in_thoughts_on_the_typhur_sync_gold/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Surprisingly the cart is 304 as opposed to 316L grade, and some folks report it doesn't hold up well as a result.\n* Coyote's new CL line looks very nice.

Every fastener, burner, etc. I've found quite a few 304s out there that are only the shell, but various components are 433 or other, and those pieces would die ugly out here. Coyotes reputation for durability and performance seem very strong; the only thing holding me back really is the 304 vs 316L.

{"title": "Napoleon vs Broil King vs Weber (Coastal Use)", "selftext": "Hey all - looking for some advice as I narrow down options for a new grill. I am located right on the coast in Bermuda, so rust/corrosion resistance is a top priority (I will be keeping the grill covered, but the salt air is no joke). My parents (who live next door) had various Webers over the years and all suffered the same rusted out fate. So they started just buying cheap grills and rotating every couple of years. I thought my solution (sticking with Weber) was the Genesis S-series (parents always had some form of the E-series), but I quickly realised that the S-series still have the porcelain/enamel coated exterior (internal is SS, which was always less of an issue). So I\u2019ve started focusing more on Napoleon and Broil King, which from what I can tell, have a stainless steel exterior build (or at least for the most part). \n\nI\u2019ve put some links below of grills I am considering, but open to any suggestions not listed below,. Any feedback on how each brand holds up would be much appreciated, especially if you\u2019ve used them in coastal or humid environments.\n\nJust for reference, I am currently leaning toward the Napoleon Prestige 500 (2025) \u2014 great reviews from what I have seen and seems to have a good balance of quality, and rust/corrosion resistance (and the lifetime warranty). Earlier model is only slighly cheaper so I think the 2025 is worth it (unless someone tells me otherwise. The Prestige Phantom (2023) also caught my eye (espeiclaly with the current discount) - great reviews, looks even better and the cast SS grates are a plus, but it looks like it is enamel coated, which brings me back to square one and why I started looking outside Weber. Anyone on the coast/humd environment with the Phantom? The Broil King's also seem to be a pretty attractive, slightly cheaper option - I am slightly confused by the different models (but that may be because I burned myself out figuring out all the Napoleon/Weber Sku's). It looks like the Broil King models are primariliy SS exterior build, with parts (like shelves) being enamel coated, but would appreciate any insight if that is not correct. \n\nNapoleon:  \n\n* [Napoloen 500 (2025)](https://www.bbq-authority.com/napoleon-prestige-500-rsib-gas-grill-evolved-p/p500vrsibss.htm) \n* [Prestige 500 (previous model)](https://www.bbq-authority.com/napoleon-prestige-500-rsib-cart-gas-grill-ss-p/p500rsibss-3.htm) \n* [Prestige Phantom (2023)](https://www.bbq-authority.com/napoleon-phantom-prestige-500-rsib-gas-grill-2023-p/p500rsibk-3-phm.htmWeber:) \n\nBroil King:\n\n* [Regal S420 Pro](https://www.bbqguys.com/i/2957061/broil-king/regal-s420-pro-4-burner-freestanding-propane-gas-grill-stainless-steel)\n* [Regal 490 Pro IR ](https://www.bbqguys.com/i/3100946/broil-king/regal-490-pro-ir-4-burner-propane-gas-grill-with-rotisserie-infrared-side-burner-stainless-steel-956944)\n\nWeber \n\n* [Genesis SP-325 LP SS](https://www.bbqguys.com/i/3158946/weber-grills/genesis-sp-325-lp-ss)\n* [Genesis S-335 Propane SS](https://www.bbqguys.com/i/3081356/weber-grills/genesis-s-335-propane-grill-stainless-steel)\n\nThank you in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grilling/comments/1k4lz50/napoleon_vs_broil_king_vs_weber_coastal_use/", "created_utc": 1745263019.0, "score": 1, "author": "acedingo13", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1k4lz50/napoleon_vs_broil_king_vs_weber_coastal_use/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Impressed with the Typhur SYNC Gold Wireless Meat Thermometer", "selftext": "I picked this up to replace my old thermometer, which had terrible range issues and would constantly disconnect if I stepped too far away. Since switching to the Typhur, I\u2019ve used it for grilling steaks, pork tenderloin, prime rib, and chicken... it\u2019s been rock solid. The Wi-Fi makes it super convenient to check temps from anywhere in the house, not just when I'm standing next to the grill.\n\nThe base is super handy with a clear display that shows meat and ambient temperature, remaining cook time, and target temp. I like having the flexibility to check temps either through the app or directly on the base, which I can move around freely since it doesn\u2019t need to stay plugged in.\n\nIt also has a built-in stand, so I don\u2019t need to constantly check my phone. The accuracy is great, and I love that the app shows a temperature graph and estimates when your food will be done, saves me from checking the thermometer every time I flip something on the grill.\n\nThe alarm is very loud - goes off when your food hits the target temp. It startled me the first time! I haven\u2019t found a way to adjust the volume yet. The only minor issue I\u2019ve run into is inserting the probe into really firm foods like potatoes is a bit tricky, but that\u2019s more about the food than the thermometer itself.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy with this purchase.

{"title": "Review of the new Char Broil grill redesign.  Not good.", "selftext": "Not happy.  Where did the old tried and true design go?  The models we would buy year after year for reliable grilling, when nothing was changing and everything worked so well?\n\nNo special lip on the front edge of the grill to hold a cutting board against so one can slide heavy trays and items off the heat onto a board.\n\nNo rear side rain and wind protection lip, so now lose a lot of heat and really tough to cook in cold conditions, rain gets in all the time, big air gap.\n\nTwice the size large skinny wheels which always flex.  Not the same as the nice small thick wheels from before.\n\nMissing the metal plate on the under side to simply set the tank on there, screw on the regulator, and get to cooking.  A flimsy tiny rail and top rail shaped like a W to somehow magically be in the proper placement to firmly set the tank on there.  My wife and kids can no longer safely put a new tank on for me.\n\nThere is an additional burner on the right side that's twice the width, uses twice the gas, generates a disproportionate amount of heat.  What happened to the uniform three rails up down and one single rail all the way across?\n\nThe top rack no longer swivels and moves back when you open the top.  Now that's fixed in place.  So we lose several key every day grilling benefits.  Can't flip a steak on the back side, there is no room to do so unless one pulls the steak all the way forward.  Additionally you can't take things off the heat when it's open, because that fixed second rack stays directly over the heat.\n\nThe frame metals are thinner gauge and thinner width.  The thing is flimsy as all can be.  Every single piece of metal, thinner gauge.\n\nThe top metal cover is thinner gauge, so it retains less heat, and is more susceptible to damage.  It's so flimsy, it flexes left and right just lifting the grill top upward.  \n\nThe thermostat is now set on the high side on the front on a flat surface.  This does not capture a true reading like the older design where it read the temperature right near the top on a rounded surface.  \n\nThere are four iron grill plates instead of three.  They get staggered upon scraping or moving items around during live grilling and don't sit right.  Should have stayed with the standard three plates.\n\nThe logo change is a side note, it's the design changes to nearly the entire grill that is so disappointing.\n\nWanting a new brand entirely.  Waste of two hundred and fifty dollars.  I'm going to give this thing away as soon as I can find a replacement with all those older features.  \n\nIt's just too bad.  Why did they feel the need to redesign everything?  They should go back to the previous tried and true models.  Change is not always a good thing.\n\nAnyone know if we can still buy one of the previous models anywhere?  I've looked everywhere online and was unable to find one.  I'm going to switch brands.  Photo of the old model.  We bought the Charbroil Performance series black and silver 4 burner propane.  Even the standard black ones have a complete redesign and are simply not the same.

Multiple phone calls, emails, and videos showing some burners not firing minutes after the grill was on (sometimes it would sometimes it wouldn't) and a fairly uneven flame later they just kept giving me the run around.\n\nThey told me to take out the burner separators (one of the features I paid a premium for), move it out of the wind (it wasn't that windy) and ultimately wanted me to take the grill apart and try adjusting things on my own based off of a fairly poorly written email.  Rather than do anything themselves to help fix the issue.\n\nI'm pretty frustrated at the lack of effort from Blaze to follow through with their advertising about it being \"effortless to use and engineered for life\" as the grill has never worked well after all the hoops they had me jump through.\n\nI went back to the place I bought it from who has a good reputation showing them Blaze's responses and they were livid.  They offered me a full refund and said they were going to go after their sales rep about what people expect when purchasing a grill at this price point, and a few other things.\n\nAfter checking online it looks like if you get a model that doesn't work, Blaze is somewhat notorious for not doing to help.

The problem is, the airfryer isn\u2019t big enough to cook all the wings at once so it takes me twice as long to cook it all.  And trying to do it on the grill, they\u2019re just not the same. The crunch of the skin just isn\u2019t there.  The little understanding I have about an airfryer is it \u201cfrys\u201d the food by circulating the air with a fan.

If you care about both function and aesthetics in your setup, the Typhur Sync Gold delivers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s stood out so far:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Accuracy and control: Temps have been dead on every time. Whether I\u2019m cooking fish, brisket, steak, you name it. It even tracks ambient temp, which is new for me, and the 5-point probe setup lets me monitor different spots in the meat at once.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Super easy to use: The interface is really straightforward. All the smart features are there without feeling like you need a manual just to cook dinner.\n\n\\- Build quality: It\u2019s got this slick gold finish and feels solid - definitely has that premium vibe if you\u2019re into nice gear.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Heats up fast: Big win for me since I\u2019m impatient.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Wireless connection\u2019s rock solid: Honestly might be my favorite part. No wires tangling up my setup, and I can wander around the house without losing connection on WiFi/Bluetooth.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCouple things to note:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- It ain\u2019t cheap: Not gonna lie, it\u2019s a bit pricey. But imo totally worth it if you take your cooking seriously.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\\- Bit of a learning curve: Some of the advanced features took me minutes to figure out, but the app and tutorials helped. (Small gripe: wish the app would put temp alerts and controls more front-and-center instead of burying them under recipes.)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBottom line:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you care about precision and want your cooks dialed in, the Typhur Sync Gold\u2019s seriously worth a look. Setup\u2019s easy, accuracy\u2019s on point, connection\u2019s solid. Definitely an A+ from me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd3ty0", "created_utc": 1746199768.0, "score": 2, "author": "Ttrip66", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1kd3ty0/6_weeks_in_thoughts_on_the_typhur_sync_gold/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I\u2019m running into a few issues though and could use some advice from anyone who's been down this road.\n\nFirst, the grates are rusting pretty heavily and definitely need replacing. OEM replacements are close to $1,000, which seems crazy. Has anyone found good alternative options that fit the Echelon?\n\nBigger problem: I\u2019m seeing some performance issues. The far right side of the grill burns cooler than the rest. On low, all areas have this \"flaming in and out\" behavior. Also noticing a lot of orange flame. I've cleaned the unit thoroughly and everything looks decent, but I'm wondering if the manifold and valves might be aging out. The burners look okay visually, but I\u2019m not sure how to tell if they\u2019re on their last legs.\n\nAlso, the glow igniters are getting red hot but not lighting the burners \u2014 probably due for replacement too.\n\nAt this point, would you invest in repairs or start thinking about replacement?

I'd like to find something in the 36-42\" range, LP. Other bells and whistles (sear station, side burner, etc) are nice, but not critical.  Thus far I've narrowed my search down to two:\n\n* Blaze Marine Grade seems like the obvious front-runner, but I've read several reviews dissatisfied with performance for one reason or the other. I'd also prefer something in the 36\"-42\" range, and the Blaze Marine only comes in a 32\".  Surprisingly the cart is 304 as opposed to 316L grade, and some folks report it doesn't hold up well as a result.\n* Coyote's new CL line looks very nice. It's 304 rather than 316L, but it appears to be *all* 304. Every fastener, burner, etc. I've found quite a few 304s out there that are only the shell, but various components are 433 or other, and those pieces would die ugly out here. Coyotes reputation for durability and performance seem very strong; the only thing holding me back really is the 304 vs 316L. The 36 or 42 size is pretty great too.\n\nAnyone out there have experience with these? Or perhaps a better idea? What about the SS grade; maybe the 304 is good enough with a little TLC? \n\nAny help appreciated!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grilling/comments/1k7393d/marine_grade_grills/", "created_utc": 1745528329.0, "score": 2, "author": "MrMeem", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1k7393d/marine_grade_grills/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Napoleon vs Broil King vs Weber (Coastal Use)", "selftext": "Hey all - looking for some advice as I narrow down options for a new grill. I am located right on the coast in Bermuda, so rust/corrosion resistance is a top priority (I will be keeping the grill covered, but the salt air is no joke). My parents (who live next door) had various Webers over the years and all suffered the same rusted out fate. So they started just buying cheap grills and rotating every couple of years. I thought my solution (sticking with Weber) was the Genesis S-series (parents always had some form of the E-series), but I quickly realised that the S-series still have the porcelain/enamel coated exterior (internal is SS, which was always less of an issue). So I\u2019ve started focusing more on Napoleon and Broil King, which from what I can tell, have a stainless steel exterior build (or at least for the most part). \n\nI\u2019ve put some links below of grills I am considering, but open to any suggestions not listed below,. Any feedback on how each brand holds up would be much appreciated, especially if you\u2019ve used them in coastal or humid environments.\n\nJust for reference, I am currently leaning toward the Napoleon Prestige 500 (2025) \u2014 great reviews from what I have seen and seems to have a good balance of quality, and rust/corrosion resistance (and the lifetime warranty). Earlier model is only slighly cheaper so I think the 2025 is worth it (unless someone tells me otherwise. The Prestige Phantom (2023) also caught my eye (espeiclaly with the current discount) - great reviews, looks even better and the cast SS grates are a plus, but it looks like it is enamel coated, which brings me back to square one and why I started looking outside Weber. Anyone on the coast/humd environment with the Phantom?

I want something a bit larger that\u2019ll last me a few years without breaking the bank. After some research, I\u2019ve narrowed it down to two options:\n\n\t\u2022\tBroil King Crown 420 \u2013 \u20ac899\n\t\u2022\tWeber Spirit EP-425 (2025 model) -\u20ac770\n\nWe\u2019ve got a local Broil King dealer in town, so I stopped by to check them out. The salesperson spent most of the time trashing Weber\u2014saying everything\u2019s made in China now, full of cheap plastic, while Broil Kings are built in Ontario with better materials, etc. I get it\u2014it\u2019s their job to push what they sell\u2014but some of their points do line up with older Reddit threads I\u2019ve read.\n\nThat said, Weber still gets a lot of love here, and the new Spirit seems like a solid option. On the other hand, all my friends swear by Broil King.\n\nSo, is the Crown 420 really worth the extra \u20ac130 over the Spirit EP-425? Is Broil King actually better in terms of build quality and performance, or is it mostly brand loyalty?\n\nWould really appreciate any input from people who\u2019ve used either of these\u2014or even better, both.\n\nThanks!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grilling/comments/1k4lyu9/new_to_grilling_torn_between_broil_king_crown_420/", "created_utc": 1745262998.0, "score": 1, "author": "PsychologicalSpell82", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1k4lyu9/new_to_grilling_torn_between_broil_king_crown_420/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I like having the flexibility to check temps either through the app or directly on the base, which I can move around freely since it doesn\u2019t need to stay plugged in.\n\nIt also has a built-in stand, so I don\u2019t need to constantly check my phone. The accuracy is great, and I love that the app shows a temperature graph and estimates when your food will be done, saves me from checking the thermometer every time I flip something on the grill.\n\nThe alarm is very loud - goes off when your food hits the target temp. It startled me the first time! I haven\u2019t found a way to adjust the volume yet. The only minor issue I\u2019ve run into is inserting the probe into really firm foods like potatoes is a bit tricky, but that\u2019s more about the food than the thermometer itself.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy with this purchase. It\u2019s reliable, easy to use, and has taken a lot of stress out of grilling and roasting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6n0ndwo1nve1.jpg?width=1413&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad43437a42f0cd265af53a1dd62bea5b9bc7e1c6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsbmnjwo1nve1.jpg?width=815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96c4dd9b9947d9d9bc12d66f6bb9235cc0661201\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grilling/comments/1k2camh/impressed_with_the_typhur_sync_gold_wireless_meat/", "created_utc": 1745001668.0, "score": 16, "author": "-broondjongen-", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1k2camh/impressed_with_the_typhur_sync_gold_wireless_meat/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Review of the new Char Broil grill redesign.  Not good.", "selftext": "Not happy.  Where did the old tried and true design go?  The models we would buy year after year for reliable grilling, when nothing was changing and everything worked so well?\n\nNo special lip on the front edge of the grill to hold a cutting board against so one can slide heavy trays and items off the heat onto a board.\n\nNo rear side rain and wind protection lip, so now lose a lot of heat and really tough to cook in cold conditions, rain gets in all the time, big air gap.\n\nTwice the size large skinny wheels which always flex.  Not the same as the nice small thick wheels from before.\n\nMissing the metal plate on the under side to simply set the tank on there, screw on the regulator, and get to cooking.  A flimsy tiny rail and top rail shaped like a W to somehow magically be in the proper placement to firmly set the tank on there.  My wife and kids can no longer safely put a new tank on for me.\n\nThere is an additional burner on the right side that's twice the width, uses twice the gas, generates a disproportionate amount of heat.  What happened to the uniform three rails up down and one single rail all the way across?\n\nThe top rack no longer swivels and moves back when you open the top.  Now that's fixed in place.  So we lose several key every day grilling benefits.  Can't flip a steak on the back side, there is no room to do so unless one pulls the steak all the way forward.  Additionally you can't take things off the heat when it's open, because that fixed second rack stays directly over the heat.\n\nThe frame metals are thinner gauge and thinner width.  The thing is flimsy as all can be.  Every single piece of metal, thinner gauge.\n\nThe top metal cover is thinner gauge, so it retains less heat, and is more susceptible to damage.  It's so flimsy, it flexes left and right just lifting the grill top upward.  \n\nThe thermostat is now set on the high side on the front on a flat surface.  This does not capture a true reading like the older design where it read the temperature right near the top on a rounded surface.  \n\nThere are four iron grill plates instead of three.  They get staggered upon scraping or moving items around during live grilling and don't sit right.  Should have stayed with the standard three plates.\n\nThe logo change is a side note, it's the design changes to nearly the entire grill that is so disappointing.\n\nWanting a new brand entirely.  Waste of two hundred and fifty dollars.  I'm going to give this thing away as soon as I can find a replacement with all those older features.  \n\nIt's just too bad.  Why did they feel the need to redesign everything?  They should go back to the previous tried and true models.  Change is not always a good thing.\n\nAnyone know if we can still buy one of the previous models anywhere?  I've looked everywhere online and was unable to find one.  I'm going to switch brands.  Photo of the old model.  We bought the Charbroil Performance series black and silver 4 burner propane.  Even the standard black ones have a complete redesign and are simply not the same.   I'm going to miss this old grill, photograph below.  Good by old friend, I'm going to miss you so much.  I'm switching brands for sure.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2b4ftbujfve1.jpg?width=3648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b6293ebf0e9fa46341d71e5190c1e8511ee27a1\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grilling/comments/1k1itbd/review_of_the_new_char_broil_grill_redesign_not/", "created_utc": 1744911604.0, "score": 0, "author": "Mr_Yesterdayz", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1k1itbd/review_of_the_new_char_broil_grill_redesign_not/", "html_title": ""}

Multiple phone calls, emails, and videos showing some burners not firing minutes after the grill was on (sometimes it would sometimes it wouldn't) and a fairly uneven flame later they just kept giving me the run around.\n\nThey told me to take out the burner separators (one of the features I paid a premium for), move it out of the wind (it wasn't that windy) and ultimately wanted me to take the grill apart and try adjusting things on my own based off of a fairly poorly written email.  Rather than do anything themselves to help fix the issue.\n\nI'm pretty frustrated at the lack of effort from Blaze to follow through with their advertising about it being \"effortless to use and engineered for life\" as the grill has never worked well after all the hoops they had me jump through.\n\nI went back to the place I bought it from who has a good reputation showing them Blaze's responses and they were livid.  They offered me a full refund and said they were going to go after their sales rep about what people expect when purchasing a grill at this price point, and a few other things.\n\nAfter checking online it looks like if you get a model that doesn't work, Blaze is somewhat notorious for not doing to help.

{"title": "Is this considered rude??", "selftext": "Hi everyone! I randomly decided that I want to cook tomorrow using one of the public park grills. This will be my first time and I just wanted to ask if it\u2019s considered weird or rude to do this early in the morning? If I pull up at the park at 6:30am and start grilling will all the early morning runners hate me?? I really don\u2019t wanna deal with any Karens or anything! \n\nThe park opens at 5 am btw. I just don\u2019t wanna be a jerk but I also really just want to do it early bc I\u2019m a morning person and it\u2019s supposed to get windy later in the day tomorrow.

{"title": "How to cover meat on a large open grill (doesn't have a lid!)", "selftext": "We're gonna be grilling about 35 tri-tips for work on Friday.    We put the wrong guy in charge of buying the grills.   They are these very large, 8-burner grills but it's completely open, no lid.   It's only gonna be about 60 degrees out and just a tiny 2-3mph breeze.\n\nWhat's the best way to cook without burning the tri-tips?  They're all 2 to 2.5 lbs.\n\nI was thinking about searing them well, then wrapping in foil and pulling at 133-135 and letting them rest.\n\nAny other suggestions on how to handle?\n\nThanks!\n\n  \nEDIT -   now I'm thinking about using those very large disposable aluminum pans and turning them upside down.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/grilling/comments/1jq0gdf/how_to_cover_meat_on_a_large_open_grill_doesnt/", "created_utc": 1743629464.0, "score": 1, "author": "Strange_Republic_890", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/grilling/comments/1jq0gdf/how_to_cover_meat_on_a_large_open_grill_doesnt/", "html_title": ""}
