Initiated some small talk. Guy was nice enough. \n\nTime comes to \"sign my receipt\" - and a TIP line appears. I grab the pen. \nSign my name.\nHe looks up at me like he did something wrong.\nNope. Just done tipping. \n\nSee, it's getting out of hand. As a broke college student, these places are my kitchens. And if I had the means to eat out at restaraunts all the time I would. Many times $9-10 gets you further there than at a fast food place. But as someone who believes in tipping for good service (20-25%), I know I can't afford restaraunts.\n\nYet, recently I've noticed a progression of fast food/sandwich shops/take-out chains that think merely paying for the food you eat is not enough. Whether it's Jersey Mikes, Taco Del Mar, Panera, Quiznos, or any other place whos business model does not involve going above-and-beyond making/handing customers food - I don't care. I'm just done tipping. I tipped $2 yesterday, $4 the day before (lunch and dinner), and by the time I'm done I could have upgraded my internet speed. \nI know I'm not alone on this.\n\n\nAnd I don't buy the \"it's the new POS systems\" line. They can change it if they wanted to. Also, the \"they only make minimum wage\" is bs too. I live in the Seattle area and the minimum wage is $13-15hr...\n\nto make a burrito. Or a sandwich. Or hand me a coffee and a muffin.\n\nAnd for those great employees who make it an enjoyable experience, I wish I could show my gratitude. I show your company gratitude by coming back. \n\nBut for now, your companies have chosen to shame customers like me into paying for your wages. And I'm sorry, but I'm making a mental checklist of every place that pulls that crap.

I never get confused looks from the cashiers or watch them scramble to figure out how to ring it up. The process is usually smooth, and I really hope that mobile ordering remains a popular way of doing business in the industry.\n\n*That said...* \n\nThe main reason I use mobile ordering right now is so that I don't have to go into the building or touch cash. I want to protect myself *and* the employees.\n\nYet as of a few weeks ago, half the restaurants around me have instituted \u201cno drive thru mobile order\u201d policies. Even if I select drive thru on the app order, I\u2019m told \u201cyou have to park and come inside to pick up mobile orders\u201d when I pull up to the speaker.\n\nI\u2019m not ordering customized stuff, or mountains of food that would hold up a non-existent line of cars.

Please keep visiting, upvoting good links, commenting on posts, and submitting interesting articles to r/fastfood. \n\nThe sub is now at 40,458 subscribers. It passed 40,000 users last Saturday (April 13th).\n\nThe sub has continued to see the increase in pageviews, unique pageviews, and subscriptions that I commented on when the sub hit 30,000 4 months ago. I think some of that has been because there has been an increase in the number of different users posting stuff to the sub, plus postings from more different news sources. I want to thank all the users who have been posting links to the sub.\n\n----\n\nI've been adding users as Approved Submitters who have regularly posted articles to /r/FastFood. It doesn't really change anything, at least for this sub. It's just an attaboy for a good post or comment \u2014 or in this case, multiple posts. \n\nTo try to increase the diversity of fast food news sources (beyond the usual Chewboom, BrandEating, TheTakeout, etc.), I've also recently started awarding reddit silver for posts from websites that haven't been regularly posted to /r/FastFood.\n\nTo find more fast food articles you can use the [Google News fast food search](https://news.google.com/search?for=fast%20food) that's in the sidebar.\n\n----\n\nThis reddit is only as good as the links and comments posted in the reddit. Please submit links to any interesting news articles that you find around the internet on fast food and fast casual restaurants.\n\nI would especially like to see more links to information on smaller regional fast food chains and independent restaurants around the world, instead for the McDonalds, Burger Kings, Wendy's, and Taco Bells of the world. What sort of information would you like to see more of posted in r/fastfood?\n\n----\n\nTo both the old and new members of the sub, I suggest that you review the sub's rules in the sidebar. This sub is a little more actively moderated than some subs on reddit, plus it uses automod to automatically remove many of the posts and comments that violate the sub's rules. But the general intent is to keep the discussions civil.\n\nA reminder: Posting rules include \u2014 No insults, profanity, incivility, trolling, or bigotry. Nothing that is rude, vulgar or offensive. Nothing gross or disgusting.(https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/6v6fl9/a_reminder_posting_rules_include_no_insults/)\n\nPlus: Don't modify article titles except to add a location in brackets unless the title is excessively misleading, vague, or clickbait-ish. Don't rely upon reddit's \"use suggested title\" feature.\n\nThere has been an increase in altered and editorialized titles the last few months.\n\n----\n\nYou can see some of the sub's previous milestones [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/search?q=flair%3Ameta&sort=new&restrict_sr=on). \n\n* [13 April 2019 40,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/bfr6nx/yippee_40000_subscribers_for_rfastfood/)\n* 10 Feb 2019 35,000\n* [12 Dec 2018 30,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/a5kdfi/wowza_30000_subscribers_for_rfastfood/?)\n* [4 Aug 2018 25,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/94oh5h/yeah_25000_subscribers_greetings_to_all_the_new/)\n* [23 March 2018, 20,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/86mb46/20000_subscribers_woot/) \n* [~ 15 November 2017, 15,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/7k4k0p/wow_15000_subscribers_to_the_fastfood_subreddit/)\n* [5 Sept 2016, 10,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/51ba3w/wow_10000_redditors_are_subscribed_to_the/) \n* [2014 - 4 years ago, 5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/2bbxvy/wow_over_5000_members/) - also when the custom snoo and header were created by /u/ninjartist\n* [21 Jan 2012, 1,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/osc64/wow_over_1000_subscribe2rs_for_rfastfood/) \n* [20 August 2011, 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/jqbey/rfastfood_hits_500_subscribers/)\n* [23 April 2011, 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/hb5bi/yea_101_subscribers/)\n\n7 years ago when I was added as a moderator the sub had been around for 3 years but only had 3 subscribers.\n\n----\n\n\nFor the last milestone post at 30,000 I wrote:\n\n> The likely unobtainable goal: To have more members than /r/TacoBell, which currently has 32,982 tacos. \n\nBut on 19 March 2019 /r/FastFood did finally pass /r/TacoBell.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/b3jegq/rfastfood_has_finally_passed_rtacobell_in_the/\n\nAnd so far the sub has stayed slightly ahead of /r/TacoBell in subscribers  where there are now at 40,355 tacos.\n\n> But looking at /u/TacoBellBlake's [rankings of fast food subs](https://old.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/aph6de/fast_food_subreddit_ranks_and_growth/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=fastfood&utm_content=t3_b3jegq) there's still one seemingly insurmountable mountain to climb, /r/Starbucks, which currently has 68,604 subscribers.

{"title": "I tried the Panda Express chicken strips", "selftext": "You may have seen [the post the other day](https://www.chewboom.com/2022/08/11/panda-express-tests-new-hand-breaded-chicken-strips/) about them, they're testing it at Innovation Kitchen in Pasadena CA, which is where I happen to live, so I went in today to give it a try.\n\nThey're cooked to order so you get it fresh, alongside fresh fries. They were regular straight-cut fries like you'd get at a burger spot, not crinkle fries as in the photo. They were kinda like the fries at The Habit if you've ever had those.\n\nThey are definitely hand-breaded, as advertised. The breading is a bit coarser than your typical chicken strip. The breading itself has very little flavor, the chicken inside has a very mild flavor like it was marinated in saltwater maybe with a very few spices. \n\nThey're a bit crispier than your average chicken strips and I'm afraid mine were ever so slightly overcooked. From a texture perspective, they do have a very satisfying crunch when you bite into them. There was no gristle or bad meat in any of my strips, it was all high quality chicken breast.\n\nThey have very little overall flavor, which doesn't make them bad, it just makes them kinda bland. I think they're relying on you getting the flavor from the sauces: A creamy sweet chili sauce and a hot habanero honey. And that leads to the flaw in my reporting:\n\nI'm an absolute pepper baby. I can't handle even regular ol black pepper. On occasion, Panda's orange chicken can be too spicy for me to eat depending on how the batch is prepared. And I couldn't handle either of these sauces. I'm sure to an average palate they're delicious and flavorful, but I'm the wrong guy to be testing them. For that I apologize. I'll leave the sauces to someone else to review.\n\nI ended up pairing the chicken strips with much milder sauces: a packet of McDonald's sweet & sour (which did NOT pair well, just was the wrong flavor to combine with this particular chicken strip) and a packet of Chick Fil A BBQ sauce (which was AMAZING with the Panda strips). \n\nIt was 3 strips with fries for $7, or 4 strips with fries for $8. Might as well spend the extra dollar and get the 4th IMHO. These prices are fairly reasonable and approximately in line with the competition in this space. Although the serving of fries was smaller than most competitors. I was able to finish the whole plate and felt full by the end.\n\n\nOverall, while they certainly weren't *bad,* they weren't extraordinary enough to make me go to Panda and order them over some of the other exceptional things on the menu. Panda's food is really good and I get cravings for their various specialties often. It's hard to recommend the chicken strips over anything else that Panda does SO WELL when Raising Cane's exists. \n\nI commend Panda for trying new things though. I just don't know if these would be a big enough seller to justify the extra labor cost in deploying them nationally.\n\n\nHere are a few pictures:\n\n[\\[1\\]](https://i.imgur.com/uY4PQDH.jpg)\n\n[\\[2\\]](https://i.imgur.com/OhSeuCK.jpg)\n\n[\\[3\\]](https://i.imgur.com/dR8yc0j.jpg)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fastfood/comments/wojok0/i_tried_the_panda_express_chicken_strips/", "created_utc": 1660518978.0, "score": 155, "author": "pmjm", "num_comments": 44, "permalink": "/r/fastfood/comments/wojok0/i_tried_the_panda_express_chicken_strips/", "html_title": ""}
