I have not updated the prices to post corona inflation, but the lovely u/FaetylMaiden checked the current prices at their local store, and the base items went from $75.15 to  $94.98\n\nAlso I messed up the title. It wasn't $100 a week, it was a little over $100 a month. So if I had to do this again I would probably be at closer to $200 a month for a family of 6 adults. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTl;dr- this is is basic system I used to keep a family of 6 adults fed for under $100 a month. I'm really tired and have to go to work tomorrow and spent forever writing this all out, so if you have questions just leave them below and I'll try to get to them!\n\nHey there, I had someone in another sub tell me I should post here. When I was 17 I was feeding a family of 6 adults on my **very** part-time earnings, and developed a bit of a system for feeding a family for cheap. Last time I went to WalMart I even got current prices(1) on what I *used* to purchase. Perhaps if I have some extra time later, I'll add a bunch of links with recipes you can make with all this stuff.\n\nIf I was dead broke and had a very limited budget to eat with for the month, this is what I would buy: (with u/FaetylMaiden's updated prices in brackets)\n\n* 25 lb sack of flour, Great Value brand, $7.89 (8.32)\n* 25 lb sack of sugar, Great Value brand, $11.98 (13.98)\n* 20 lb sack of pinto beans, Great Value brand, $13.97 (14.46)\n* 20 lbs Great Value long grain enriched rice, $8.44 (9.78)\n* 4 lbs of Armor lard, $4.98 (10.22)\n* 64 oz Great Value nonfat dried milk (for baking), $14.982 (19.67)\n* 10 lbs frying chicken leg quarters, $5.30 (9.08)\n* 5 lb bag of russet potatoes, $1.97 (2.75)\n* 3 lb bag of yellow onions, $1.94 (1.98)\n* 1.25 lbs of garlic, $3.68 (4.92)\n\nIf you are eating a really pared down diet like this, you will NEED the garlic and onions.\n\nTo get closer to the prices I posted, find a local Restrant Depot. The bags of items are bigger but the prices are better per ounce- but not every town has a Restaurant Depot nearby and Walmart is everywhere. \n\nThat comes to $75.15. That is a LOT of food for under a hundred bucks. That's 113 lbs of food, and most people need about a pound of food a meal to feel full. So, for a family of 4, this will cover *most* of what you need for 28 days, or just under a month, giving you a little wiggle room in the budget to still keep it under $100 for the month for basics, which gives you a little more budget to play with for everything else.\n\nWith anything over that, I'd also get:\n\n* Cheddar cheese\n* A variety of beans. Pinto beans are the cheapest in my neck of the woods, but I far prefer black beans and lentils. They are still cheap as hell and worth buying.\n* Whatever is on sale. I try not to pay over .99/lb for meat, which is getting a lot harder. Safeway still has the best sales on meat.\n* 50 lb sack of popcorn, Mighty Pop brand, $23.98\n* A cheap, bulk sack of steel cut oatmeal\n* Butter\n* Sauces. Soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar(apple cider, balsamic, rice wine), mirin, furikake, pepper, salt, epizote, bay leaves, hot sauce, maple syrup, etc.\n* The biggest box of eggs I can get. I know in my area I can get 60 eggs (5 dozen) for under $10, but I did not check the price at WalMart when I went last time.\n* Cilantro\n* Curry pastes (Mae Ploy yellow is the best) and coconut milk\n* Bag of bacon ends and pieces\n* Better than Bullion, or some kind of bullion.\n* Canned tuna\n* a mix of canned tomato products\n* Some fresh fruit and vegetables- whatever is on sale/cheap. I ate a LOT of bananas.\n\nI'm assuming you already have things like baking soda, baking powder, etc. If not, you'll need to get salt, baking soda/powder, vanilla, pepper, etc to fill out your pantry.\n\nNow these big sacks are cheap and you CAN NOT get down to the per oz or per pound unit cost in smaller quantities. These are large amounts of food to keep you through a month, if you have a problem with vermin in your apartment (or you have neighbors who like to feed the roaches because all life is sacred- (I was **SO** happy to move out of there), you might want to swing by your local burger fast food place and ask for their pickle buckets. They will forever stink of vinegar, but I think that would help keep bugs away from your grains. I kept mine in 5 gallon buckets that I just bought (they're >$2.00 each), and if you have a little wiggle room you might want to get gamma lids.\n\nFirst, you'll be doing a lot of baking. Baking from scratch is not only going to save you money, but there is NOTHING like home baked bread to make you feel like you're not on a survival diet, but that things are OK. It's just delicious. I didn't price yeast, but you want the little tubs, not the packets. If you can, get to a library and order \"*Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day*\" or pick it up on amazon, it's really a wonderful book, and you really can get your baking down to five minutes of active time, before you get the rest of your meal started.\n\nHere is how a basic day would go:\n\n**Breakfast** Mix up milk to use for coffee creamer/baking that night. Oatmeal with a little sugar on top and some butter, or some syrup if we have it. If I'm making beans for dinner, use one of the zillions of recipes available for crock pot beans, get that started before I leave the house.\n\n**Lunch:** Leftovers with rice.\n\n**Dinner:** Fresh bread and/or cornbread\n\nPinto beans and rice, with a sausage link or two cut up and used as a seasoning/topping for all 6 people in the house.\n\nor\n\nRefried beans, home made tortillas, and a little cheese and/or cook up a chicken leg or two and shred them.\n\nor\n\n[Home made pasta](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/best-easy-all-purpose-fresh-pasta-dough-recipe-instructions.html) (cheaper with the flour than buying it, tastes better, not hard to learn to make), tossed in butter with a little garlic powder and parmesan cheese, with a fried egg cracked on top.\n\nor\n\nBaked potato, scooped out, mash the middles, mix in a little sour creme (a small tub is .88), some shredded cheddar, and some chopped cooked broccoli (microwaved frozen works fine for this). If you got the bacon ends, cook some and chop them fine, and mix them into this. Save the fat for cooking something else in, later. Bacon fat adds a lot of flavor.\n\nor\n\nFry some of the bacon ends and pieces, chopped fine. Drain, put meat aside, put fat back in pan. Dice an onion, pop it in the fat, stir it until it's golden brown. If you can get some, add a carrot and celery in there, diced the same size. Chop some garlic, put it in there. When it smells like heaven, some coriander seed and some cumin. When that's toasted and lovely, add a can of chopped tomatoes. Add about two quarts of water (or your home made chicken stock if you have it, bullion if you do not) and a one pound bag of lentils. Let it simmer on medium-low for about 40 minutes. This goes ahhh-MAAAAY-zing with home made bread.\n\nIf you are cooking for kids like this, make sure to put butter on their bread and in their cereal, and to give them the richer bits. Kids need fat for brain development, and this is a lower-fat diet than is really healthy for them.\n\nThis is also pretty shy on Vitamin C, and you can get scurvy if you eat like this too much, BUT- seasonally, oranges and carrots are cheap, so you can buy them, and I HIGHLY SUGGEST you use whatever greens are available and cheap (it's the winter now, so turnip greens, kale, and cabbage are cheap, in the spring it turns into lettuce being cheaper) to fill out your weekly budget. Also, I used a sprouting tray and got seeds to sprout, because that's a great, cheap way to get vitamins year-round.\n\nI actually got a microwave rice cooker at Walmart for \\~5.00 that I use when I'm cooking like this, because I make a LOT of rice bowls. You'll want to google those for dinners because you can do a HUGE amount with them to keep things varied, but here is one of my favorites:\n\nGet rice started in the microwave. Cook two chicken legs, separated into one leg portion and one thigh portion, in soy sauce and a little lemon juice. When they are done, toss some hardy greens (mustard, kale, etc) in the pan, maybe add a touch of vinegar. Cover with a loose lid, stir occasionally until the greens are soft.\n\nTake bowls, fill about halfway with rice, then layer on the greens. Place portion of chicken on top. Serves four people with two legs of chicken.\n\nAnother thing I would do to make things stretch is I would invite over someone to have a meal, if they provided an ingredient. I had plenty of friends in college who were broke but could spare enough to buy a few steaks or pork chops, which I could season, cook, and then slice really thin to put on top of a rice bowl. They got a meal they otherwise couldn't have cooked, we got some extra meat which wasn't really in the budget, and everyone got to socialize, so it was a mega win. If your broke friends realize that you bake bread every day, inviting them over for dinner is an easy sell. :)\n\nAlso, put a freezer bag in the freezer, and every onion bottom, veggie peeling, and chicken bone that goes through your hands, pop it in there. Roast everything then dump it in a big stock pot full of water, cook on low all day, and turn it into chicken stock. Use that instead of water to give your recipes a lot more depth and flavor.\n\n(1) I lived in rural Texas. It's cheap to live out here, so the prices are likely to be on the low side, even for WalMart.\n\n(2) This is one of the first things I would cut if things were SUPER tight, but if you're doing your own baking it's better than real milk. Mostly because people don't drink it for fun, but if transportation to a store is an issue, it's also shelf stable so it's easier to stretch it for a month than it is to try to keep fresh milk.\n\n(3) Popcorn is the same as the corn that goes into corn meal. Put it in a blender, and mix it half and half with some wheat flour, and you have the basis for a zillion recipes, from johnny cakes, breading for food, cornbread, muffins, etc. You can also just buy corn meal, but I didn't' snag the price for it while i was out. It's not expensive, but popcorn can also be popped, and was marginally cheaper, so I used to get that instead.\n\nHope this is helpful! You can live well on nearly nothing, but the thing is, you have to give up a lot of convenience food. I had a Russian friend tell me the only thing Americans were afraid of was inconvenience, so that can be hard. In some ways, though, I ate a lot better when I was too poor too afford cereal, I sure as heck don't eat fresh bread every day anymore\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_-\n\nA few updates: Since Corona, Restaruant Depot, which is in most cities, is open to the public and the bags of beans there are larger, higher quality and cheaper than Walmart. If you can go, I super reccomend it. I think last time I went I got a 50lb bag of pinto beans for around $13. Use it to make Charro beans, refried beans, etc. I still prefer black beans. I buy my rice at an asian grocery store in 50 or 100 lb bags and now consider an Aroma rice cooker the best kitchen gadget I own, mixing in some sazon or any spice packet or dried herbs will make a cheap, filling rice that tastes amazing and goes beautifully with beans.\n\nRemember if your food tastes boring or flat, to add salt and then a little bit of something acidic like vinegar or lime juice. And if you're getting burned out eating food like this add more onions/garlic/leeks, it helps with appetite fatigue.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/xjlac4/repost_how_i_used_to_feed_a_family_of_6_adults/", "created_utc": 1663709575.0, "score": 1035, "author": "madpiratebippy", "num_comments": 134, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/xjlac4/repost_how_i_used_to_feed_a_family_of_6_adults/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I've put some in chicken soup, I've cut some into carrot sticks for my fiance's lunchbox. And there are still so many carrots. I want to use these carrots before they go bad. This was terrible planning on my part. So please what are your carrot-y suggestions.\n\nUPDATE\nHey yall!\nI was not expecting this many recommendations so I wanted to share a little carrot update. I'm not employed right now, so I have been in my kitchen all day following up on a few of the recommendations.\n\nI have baked 3 carrot cake loaves: 1 for us, one for my fiance to take to work, and one for the inlaws\n\nI have multiple batches of carrot and sweet Potato soup in silicone molds in the freezer.

{"title": "How I used to feed a family of 6 adults for >$100 a week", "selftext": "Tl;dr- this is is basic system I used to keep a family of 6 adults fed for under $100 a week. I'm really tired and have to go to work tomorrow and spent forever writing this all out, so if you have questions just leave them below and I'll try to get to them!\n\nHey there, I had someone in another sub tell me I should post here. When I was 17 I was feeding a family of 6 adults on my **very** part-time earnings, and developed a bit of a system for feeding a family for cheap. Last time I went to WalMart I even got current prices^1 on what I *used* to purchase. Perhaps if I have some extra time later, I'll add a bunch of links with recipes you can make with all this stuff. \n\nIf I was dead broke and had a very limited budget to eat with for the month, this is what I would buy:\n\n* 25 lb sack of flour, Great Value brand, $7.89\n* 25 lb sack of sugar, Great Value brand, $11.98\n* 20 lb sack of pinto beans, Great Value brand, $13.97\n* 20 lbs Great Value long grain enriched rice, $8.44\n* 4 lbs of Armor lard, $4.98\n* 64 oz Great Value nonfat dried milk (for baking), $14.98^2\n* 10 lbs frying chicken leg quarters, $5.30\n* 5 lb bag of russet potatoes, $1.97\n* 3 lb bag of yellow onions, $1.94\n* 1.25 lbs of garlic, $3.68\n\nIf you are eating a really pared down diet like this, you will NEED the garlic and onions. \n\nThat comes to $75.15. That is a LOT of food for under a hundred bucks. That's 113 lbs of food, and most people need about a pound of food a meal to feel full. So, for a family of 4, this will cover *most* of what you need for 28 days, or just under a month, giving you a little wiggle room in the budget to still keep it under $100 for the month for basics, which gives you a little more budget to play with for everything else.\n\nWith anything over that, I'd also get:\n\n* Cheddar cheese \n* A variety of beans. Pinto beans are the cheapest in my neck of the woods, but I far prefer black beans and lentils. They are still cheap as hell and worth buying. \n* Whatever is on sale. I try not to pay over .99/lb for meat, which is getting a lot harder. Safeway still has the best sales on meat. \n* 50 lb sack of popcorn, Mighty Pop brand, $23.98^3\n* A cheap, bulk sack of steel cut oatmeal\n* Butter\n* Sauces. Soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar(apple cider, balsamic, rice wine), mirin, furikake, pepper, salt, epizote, bay leaves, hot sauce, maple syrup, etc. \n* The biggest box of eggs I can get. I know in my area I can get 60 eggs (5 dozen) for under $10, but I did not check the price at WalMart when I went last time.\n* Cilantro\n* Curry pastes and coconut milk\n* Bag of bacon ends and pieces\n* Better than Bullion, or some kind of bullion.\n* Canned tuna\n* a mix of canned tomato products\n* Some fresh fruit and vegetables- whatever is on sale/cheap. I ate a LOT of bananas. \n\nI'm assuming you already have things like baking soda, baking powder, etc. If not, you'll need to get salt, baking soda/powder, vanilla, pepper, etc to fill out your pantry.\n\nNow these big sacks are cheap and you CAN NOT get down to the per oz or per pound unit cost in smaller quantities. These are large amounts of food to keep you through a month, if you have a problem with vermin in your apartment (or you have neighbors who like to feed the roaches because all life is sacred- I was **SO** happy to move out of there), you might want to swing by your local burger fast food place and ask for their pickle buckets. They will forever stink of vinegar, but I think that would help keep bugs away from your grains. I kept mine in 5 gallon buckets that I just bought (they're >$2.00 each), and if you have a little wiggle room you might want to get gamma lids.\n\nFirst, you'll be doing a lot of baking. Baking from scratch is not only going to save you money, but there is NOTHING like home baked bread to make you feel like you're not on a survival diet, but that things are OK. It's just delicious. I didn't price yeast, but you want the little tubs, not the packets. If you can, get to a library and order \"*Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day*\" or pick it up on amazon, it's really a wonderful book, and you really can get your baking down to five minutes of active time, before you get the rest of your meal started. \n\nHere is how a basic day would go:\n\n**Breakfast**\nMix up milk to use for coffee creamer/baking that night.\nOatmeal with a little sugar on top and some butter, or some syrup if we have it.\nIf I'm making beans for dinner, use one of the zillions of recipes available for crock pot beans, get that started before I leave the house. \n\n**Lunch:**\nLeftovers with rice.\n\n**Dinner:**\nFresh bread and/or cornbread\n\nPinto beans and rice, with a sausage link or two cut up and used as a seasoning/topping for all 6 people in the house.\n\nor\n\nRefried beans, home made tortillas, and a little cheese and/or cook up a chicken leg or two and shred them.\n\nor\n\n[Home made pasta](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/best-easy-all-purpose-fresh-pasta-dough-recipe-instructions.html) (cheaper with the flour than buying it, tastes better, not hard to learn to make), tossed in butter with a little garlic powder and parmesan cheese, with a fried egg cracked on top.\n\nor\n\nBaked potato, scooped out, mash the middles, mix in a little sour creme (a small tub is .88), some shredded cheddar, and some chopped cooked broccoli (microwaved frozen works fine for this). If you got the bacon ends, cook some and chop them fine, and mix them into this. Save the fat for cooking something else in, later. Bacon fat adds a lot of flavor.  \n\nor\n\nFry some of the bacon ends and pieces, chopped fine. Drain, put meat aside, put fat back in pan. Dice an onion, pop it in the fat, stir it until it's golden brown. If you can get some, add a carrot and celery in there, diced the same size. Chop some garlic, put it in there. When it smells like heaven, some coriander seed and some cumin. When that's toasted and lovely, add a can of chopped tomatoes. Add about two quarts of water (or your home made chicken stock if you have it, bullion if you do not) and a one pound bag of lentils. Let it simmer on medium-low for about 40 minutes. This goes ahhh-MAAAAY-zing with home made bread. \n\n\nIf you are cooking for kids like this, make sure to put butter on their bread and in their cereal, and to give them the richer bits. Kids need fat for brain development, and this is a lower-fat diet than is really healthy for them. \n\nThis is also pretty shy on Vitamin C, and you can get scurvy if you eat like this too much, BUT- seasonally, oranges and carrots are cheap, so you can buy them, and I HIGHLY SUGGEST you use whatever greens are available and cheap (it's the winter now, so turnip greens, kale, and cabbage are cheap, in the spring it turns into lettuce being cheaper) to fill out your weekly budget. Also, I used a sprouting tray and got seeds to sprout, because that's a great, cheap way to get vitamins year-round. \n\nI actually got a microwave rice cooker at Walmart for ~5.00 that I use when I'm cooking like this, because I make a LOT of rice bowls. You'll want to google those for dinners because you can do a HUGE amount with them to keep things varied, but here is one of my favorites:\n\nGet rice started in the microwave. Cook two chicken legs, separated into one leg portion and one thigh portion, in soy sauce and a little lemon juice. When they are done, toss some hardy greens (mustard, kale, etc) in the pan, maybe add a touch of vinegar. Cover with a loose lid, stir occasionally until the greens are soft.\n\nTake bowls, fill about halfway with rice, then layer on the greens. Place portion of chicken on top. Serves four people. \n\nAnother thing I would do to make things stretch is I would invite over someone to have a meal, if they provided an ingredient. I had plenty of friends in college who were broke but could spare enough to buy a few steaks or pork chops, which I could season, cook, and then slice really thin to put on top of a rice bowl. They got a meal they otherwise couldn't have cooked, we got some extra meat which wasn't really in the budget, and everyone got to socialize, so it was a mega win. If your broke friends realize that you bake bread every day, inviting them over for dinner is an easy sell. :) \n\nAlso, put a freezer bag in the freezer, and every onion bottom, veggie peeling, and chicken bone that goes through your hands, pop it in there. Roast everything and turn it into chicken stock. Use that instead of water to give your recipes a lot more depth and flavor.\n\nIf I was now in this sort of a budget shortfall, I'd get a few chickens, garden a lot more for my greens, possibly get some quails for eggs. The eggs are critical, and I have a big enough back yard I could feed the chickens scraps and get some eggs in return.\n\n1.I live in rural Texas. It's cheap to live out here, so the prices are likely to be on the low side, even for WalMart.\n\n2. This is one of the first things I would cut if things were SUPER tight, but if you're doing your own baking it's a lot cheaper than real milk.\n\n3. Popcorn is the same as the corn that goes into corn meal. Put it in a blender, and mix it half and half with some wheat flour, and you have the basis for a zillion recipes, from johnny cakes, breading for food, cornbread, muffins, etc. You can also just buy corn meal, but I didn't' snag the price for it while i was out. It's not expensive, but popcorn can also be popped, and was marginally cheaper, so I used to get that instead.\n\nHope this is helpful! You can live well on nearly nothing, but the thing is, you have to give up a lot of convenience food. I had a Russian friend tell me the only thing Americans were afraid of was inconvenience, so that can be hard. In some ways, though, I ate a lot better when I was too poor too afford cereal, I sure as heck don't eat fresh bread every day anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/45v9u2/how_i_used_to_feed_a_family_of_6_adults_for_100_a/", "created_utc": 1455519218.0, "score": 746, "author": "madpiratebippy", "num_comments": 88, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/45v9u2/how_i_used_to_feed_a_family_of_6_adults_for_100_a/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I recreated my favorite restaurant's $18 double beef burger at home. Nailed it?", "selftext": "Hey \u2764\ufe0f I wanted to share this over here because I was quite proud of this double beef burger recipe completely made from scratch \u2764\ufe0f the recipe is on my channel and it was quite a bit of hard work. It would be awesome if y\u2019all could check it out. But everything is below too nonetheless\u2764\ufe0f\n\nBurger Bun Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n- 3/4 cup + 2 tsp milk\n- 1 tbsp sugar\n- 1 1/4 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp yeast\n- 50g butter\n- 325g flour\n\nInstructions:\n1. Combine milk, sugar, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Stir well and let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.\n2. Add the butter and gradually mix in the flour until a smooth dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until elastic and smooth.\n4. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled (about 1-1.5 hours).\n5. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions (to make 4 bun halves for 2 complete burgers).\n6. Shape into rounds and place on a baking sheet. Cover and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.\n7. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n8. Bake in air fryer at 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.\n\n Double Beef Patty Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n- 500g beef mince\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp black pepper\n- 1 tsp garlic powder\n- 1 tsp onion powder\n- 1 tsp paprika\n- 2 tbsp BBQ sauce\n- 2 tbsp cold grated butter\n\nInstructions:\n1. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix gently (avoid overmixing).\n2. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions (125g each) to make 2 patties per burger.\n3. Shape into patties slightly larger than your buns (they'll shrink when cooking).\n4. Make a slight indent in the center of each patty (prevents bulging while cooking).\n5. Refrigerate patties for at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n6. Cook in a hot pan or grill for 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness.\n7. Brush with BBQ sauce when almost done.\n8. Add cheddar cheese on top of each patty and cover lid to melt.\n \nIngredients:\n- 4 burger bun halves (2 tops, 2 bottoms)\n- 4 cooked beef patties with melted cheddar\n- Sliced red onions\n- Sliced tomatoes\n- Fresh lettuce leaves\n- Pickle slices\n- Special sauce (from previous recipe to be mentioned in your video)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Toast the cut sides of the buns if desired.\n2. Spread special sauce on the bottom bun.\n3. Layer with lettuce and tomato slices.\n4. Place the first cheese-topped patty.\n5. Add the second cheese-topped patty directly on top of the first.\n6. Add pickles and red onion slices.\n7. Spread more sauce on the top bun, if desired.\n8. Place the top bun over the assembled ingredients.\n\nTips for Success\n\n- For juicier double patties: Make each patty thinner than you would for a single patty burger (about 1/2 inch thick).\n- Patty size: Make the patties slightly larger than your buns as they will shrink during cooking.\n- Even cooking: Ensure all patties are uniform in thickness for consistent cooking.\n- Cheese placement: Add cheese to both patties for maximum flavor.\n- Stacking strategy: Place the patties directly on top of each other to create a true double burger experience.\n- For the buns: This recipe makes 4 bun halves, perfect for 2 complete burgers.\n- Air fryer batches: You may need to bake the buns in batches depending on your air fryer size.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/wjwxnbcjw6qe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742626925.0, "score": 663, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1jh2r3a/i_recreated_my_favorite_restaurants_18_double/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I eat for roughly $5/day, and here is a breakdown of my past week (all recipes included)", "selftext": "I'm not an expert, and I'm certainly not claiming these as \"meal preps\", they're just recipes to help make your week a little easier, keep your wallet a little fuller, and your stomach satisfied. Especially helpful if you're trying to cut back on eating out!\n\n\\----------\n\n**Ingredients Needed**\n\n* 12 eggs\n* 3 potatoes\n* 1 lb sausage\n* 14 medium-sized tortillas\n* 10 garlic cloves\n* 2 white or yellow onion\n* 2 tsp creole spice (or cajun)\n* 2 3/4 cups uncooked rice\n* 1 can coconut milk\n* 2 cans red kidney beans\n* 2 1/4 cups chicken broth (or use water + 1 chicken bouillon cube)\n* 3 chicken breasts (or meat of your choice)\n* 6 large fluffy tortillas (look for something a little less thick than a flatbread or pita)\n* 6 cups refried beans\n* 3 cups cheese\n* 1 cup sour cream (or salsa)\n* 2 small tomatoes\n* 1 lb boneless chicken\n* 1 small bunch green onion\n* 3 bell peppers\n* 1 spicy pepper (jalapeno, habanero, etc.)\n* 1 can black beans\n* 3 can crushed tomatoes\n* 1 cup Jamaican jerk marinade\n* 1 lb beef stew meat\n* 1 cup almonds\n* 2 cups dates\n* 1 1/2 coconut flakes\n* 1/3 cup cocoa powder\n\nSome seasonings and condiments aren\u2019t listed, as most people have the basics on hand. And remember, let\u2019s make the most of your budget by buying what is on a deal at your grocery store and substitute!\n\nCaribbean flavors call for unique spices and flavors. To help even the costs with these ingredients that you may not already have, I made sure to include large recipes that cover at least 3 days of meals.\n\n**Breakfast (all 7 days)**\n\nBreakfast Burrito\n\nFor 7 meals: 12 eggs, 3 potatoes, 1 lb sausage, 14 tortillas\n\nBreakfast burritos are my favorite! You may recall a similar recipe I used before with only eggs and potatoes, this one is a more hearty version.\n\nScramble the eggs in a pan, and also cook the sausage thoroughly in a pan (breaking into small pieces). Shred the potatoes (using a cheese grater works perfectly) and cooking over high heat until they are golden and crisp.\n\nI like to cook my potatoes like pancakes, this makes the outside crispy but the inside soft.\n\nWhen everything is finished cooking, fill each tortilla with some of everything, roll it up, and store it in the freezer. You can store it in plastic wrap, aluminum foil or just a regular Ziploc bag.\n\nEach morning, pop 2 in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes and enjoy.\n\n**Lunch (days 1-4)**\n\nCaribbean Rice & Beans with Meat\n\nFor 4 meals: 2 garlic cloves, 1 onion, 2 tsp creole spice (or cajun seasoning), 2 cups uncooked rice, 13.5 oz can coconut milk, 15.5 oz can red kidney beans, 2 1/4 cups chicken broth (or water with 1 chicken bouillon cube), 3 chicken breasts (or meat of your choice)\n\nFirst, wash your rice until the water runs clear and then drain.\n\nIn a saucepan over medium-high heat, add some oil or butter, then add diced onions and garlic. Saut\u00e9 for about a minute.\n\nStir in the rice, followed by the kidney beans, and keeping stirring around for about 2 minutes. Then add coconut milk, chicken broth, creole spice, and bring this to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and lit it simmer with a lid on top. Let this cook for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is cooked, and stir occasionally to prevent the sides/bottom from burning.\n\nWhile this is cooking, you can prepare the chicken breasts. Because the rice and bean dish is so tasty on its own, just cooking the chicken with salt and pepper is plenty. Chop the chicken into strips and then divvy it up into 4 days of meals with the Caribbean rice and beans.\n\n**Lunch (days 5-7)**\n\nHonduran Baleadas (Street Tacos)\n\nFor 3 meals: 6 large fluffy tortillas, 6 cups refried beans, 3 cups cheese, 1 cups sour cream (or a salsa), 2 small tomatoes and other toppings you\u2019d like\n\nSpread warmed-up refried beans evenly over a warm tortilla. Sprinkle cheese and drizzle sour cream. Top with sliced tomatoes and any other toppings. Fold in half like a taco! Eat 2 for each meal.\n\nI think if you sprinkled some of the previous creole seasoning it would be very tasty too! I haven\u2019t tried doing that, so I\u2019m not sure, but it sounds good!\n\n**Dinner (days 1-4)**\n\nJamaican Jerk Chicken Chili\n\nFor 4 meals: 1 lb boneless chicken, 1 small bunch of green onion, 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, 1 spicy pepper (jalepeno, habanero, etc.), 1 can kidney beans, 1 can black beans, 1 can crushed tomatoes, 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 cup Jamaican jerk marinade\n\nThese aren\u2019t necessary, but it would make it taste out of this world, add: 1 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp thyme, 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon\n\nYou can either cook this in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours, low for 6-8 hours, or in a large pot on the stove for about 1.5 hours on a simmer.\n\nBasically, just dump everything into the pot and let it cook. Stir it around a few times, and add salt and pepper to your liking.\n\nYou can eat this as-is, with crackers, avocado or rice\u2026 whatever you feel like!\n\nIf you end up making more than 4 portions, you can freeze the rest and save for when you\u2019re rushed for time.\n\n**Dinner (day 5-7)**\n\nRopa Vieja (Cuban Beef Stew)\n\nFor 3 meals: 1 lb beef stew meat (1-inch cubes), 2 bell peppers, 5 garlic cloves, 2 cans crushed tomatoes, salt and pepper, 1.5 cups cooked rice\n\nNot necessary, but you can also add: 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp paprika\n\nAgain, this can be done the slow cooker route or on the stove with the same guidelines as before.\n\nBefore you dump everything in the pot, you\u2019ll want to sear your beef and bell peppers. Do this by heating oil in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the beef and allow all outer edges to brown. Once done, transfer to a big pot or slow cooker.\n\nSear the bell peppers in the pan, cooking just until they soften slightly.\n\nAdd the bell peppers and all remaining ingredients into the pot. Let this cook until the beef is tender and you can shred it using 2 forks. Mix it all together and serve with cooked rice.\n\n**Snacks**\n\nBliss Bars\n\nFor the week: 1 cup almonds, 2 cups dates, 1 1/2 cup coconut flakes, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, water as needed\n\nIf using whole almonds, you will need to blend them or put them in a processor to break them down. If you are using sliced or slivered almonds, you can skip this step.\n\nIn a blender or processor, add all your ingredients (except water) and blend until they create a texture that\u2019s smooth and clumps together. You may need to add a tablespoon of water at a time to achieve this, depending on how much moisture your dates contain.\n\nLine a 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper and press the mixture into the pan. Flatten and smooth the mixture, then pop in the fridge for at least 20 minutes.\n\nAfter that, you can slice them into bars and store in the fridge for up to 1 week (or in the freezer if you want to store them longer).\n\n\\----------\n\nEvery Friday, I actually send out an email with a list of recipes and a shopping list for the week - in the same format as this one. I've had many, many people applaud me on this and I wanted to go ahead give the option for if you want to receive them also, you can check it out [here](https://www.budgetmealplanner.com/)! There's no catch. Just honest weekly recipes :p\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, eating for $5/day means shopping smart. But, I'm no extreme couponer. I just buy what's on deal and make it work.

I have changed the recipe a little because I did not have tomato juice which she would have used. \n\n1 lb of beef. \n1 onion\n14.5 oz can of tomatoes\n1/2 lb of macaroni noodles. \n\nBrown the beef and onions.  Add tomatoes.  Along with 14 oz of water (this is where she would have used the tomato juice). Add the noodles.  Add garlic, salt, pepper, chili powder (tsp of each, Tbsp of chili). I added some smoked paprika as well.  Love that stuff.  Simmer for 20 minutes or until the noodles are soft and it is the right liquid for your taste.  \n\nIt's a simple meal. One that seems \"boring\" but I love it.  I left mine soupier than mom would have.  I used to text her and ask if she would make this for me if I brought the goods.  She always would.

Soup makes about 3, curry and chicken is for 1-2, and paella is for 2-3\n\n**Chinese chicken soup** :\n\nbring pan to boil, then add 1 teaspoon of chinese 5 spice, and 1 chicken stock cube. Dissolve the spices.\n\nadd 1 chicken breast, then simmer on low for 25 minutes\nremove chicken onto plate, then shred with forks\n\nadd chicken back into pan, then add frozen peas, spinach, green (spring) onions, and mushrooms.\n\nadd soy sauce to taste.\n\n**Curry** :\n\ndice (ie chop into very small bits) an onion\n\nget frying pan with some oil, then gently fry onions for 5-10 minutes until the whiteness is turned into translucence\n\ndice (make into cubes about the size of a dice) 1 chicken breast, and add to frying pan\n\nadd 1-2 tablespoon of ready-mixed curry powder. If you want to do this yourself the spice mix I use is 1 tsp of each - cumin, turmeric, fennel, coriander, chilli powder, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a large pinch of salt\n\nonce chicken is browned and maybe cooked through, add 1 tin of chopped tomatoes, then simmer for at least 20 minutes. adding lime is good.\n\nIf you can't be fucked cooking rice you can add 1 diced sweet potato and cook for at least 35 minutes.\n\ntaste, if it is bland add more spices, if it is unspicy add more chilli powder, if it needs more salt add some. You can go pretty wild with the vegetables in this, adding things like celery or mushrooms at the same time as the onions, or peas at the end, is all extra flavor and nutrition. If you want it to be more creamy, add some icelandic yogurt or just normal natural yogurt\n\n**Lazy paella**:\n\nput 1-3 chicken thigh in oven, cover with oil, then cook at 180 degrees c for 35 mins. take out, cool, then pull the meat off\n\nboil water in pan, add tumeric, add rice.\n\nwhen rice has 2 minutes left add frozen peas and frozen fish or shrimp, fish can be crazy cheap. Smoked sausage is also an easy 2 minute ingredient that makes this better.\n\nadd chicken thigh, and salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n**Carbonara-ish**\n\nI make a carbonara using eggs, milk, with a tiny bit of chorizo with rosmary and a kick of chili, and it is amazing, and the eggs replace the cheesyness I crave. I base it off [this recipe](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pasta-recipes/chorizo-carbonara-with-catalan-market-salad/) but half the chorizo, very little cheese if any, and no salad\n\n**sweet potato wedges**\n\n\nsweet potato wedges are a very low calorie replacement that hits the same spot as fries. Just wedge em, spray with some of that 1 calorie spray, add herbs/spices depending on what flavour you're going for.\n\n**Broccoli and cauliflower soup**, possibly the lowest calorie thing I make super regularly, and it is super tasty. \n\nFry 1 small onion in about 1/2 a teaspoon of oil, low and slow, this adds great sweetness. Add 2 head of broccoli and 1 head of cauliflower, then 1 chicken stock cube and enough water to fill up the pan. Add a big amount of pepper (bit by bit then taste) while boiling. cook for about 10 mins then blend. \n\nroughly 100 kcal\n\n**chicken chilli wrap.** \n\nboil a chicken breast in water with a bit of salt and chili for about 25 mins, remove and shred. reduce water down to not much, then add chicken in again with 1/8 can cannolini beans, chopped tomatos, chopped fresh chili, tonnes of mushrooms, then reduce down again till not much water left. Without a wrap it sits at about 220 kcal\n\n**Japenese Udon Noodles** - Fuck me this will rock your world\n\nboil 1 chicken breast in water, with 1 heaped tsp of chinese 5 spice and 2tbs of soy sauce. Cook for 20 mins then remove and shred. add 1 clove of garlic, chicken stock cube, tonnes of mushrooms, and some [udon noodles](http://img.21food.com/20110609/product/1305081968546.jpg). Finish with 1 tbsp of Worcester sauce and some spring onions (scallions). sits at 475 calories, but normally does 2 big bowls.\n\n**tuna mayo pasta**\n\nProbably the simplest meal you can make.\n\nBoil 250g pasta for 10 mins, (this makes 2 huge servings)\n\nWhen pasta has 2 minutes left, stir in some frozen peas and sweetcorn\n\nOpen a can of cheap tuna and drain the oil/brine/water\n\nDrain pasta, then stir in tuna, a little olive oil, and a good amount of mayonnaise\n\nAdd a good amount of pepper, a wee bit of salt, some (dried) basil, and some garlic powder. Some chili flakes are never a bad move either.\n\n**Pork Wellington**\n\nThis one is for showing off, as it looks amazing, but it is also suprisingly easy and, when you get pork tenderloin on the cheap, can actually be reasonably cheap.\n\nFry a finely diced onion and some finely diced mushrooms. \n\nRoll out about half a block of frozen pastry so it is about 20cm up and as wide as your tenderloin is long\n\nplace bacon on the pastry, covering as much of the surface as you can afford\n\nonce mushrooms and onions have softened, spread over bacon/pastry\n\nplace tenderloin on top, then roll up into a cylinder and seal the ends.\n\nCook in the oven for about 40 minutes at around 170C\n\nserve with lots of brocolli/other greens\n\nmakes about 4 portions\n\n**burgers**\n\nGet some beef mince, put in a bowl large enough to mix it, then add an egg, chives, salt, pepper, and maybe basil. \n\nGradually add breadcrumbs until it becomes solid enough to form into safe patties.\n\nGrill, or fry, then eat\n\n**sausage pasta**\n\nchop a couple sausages into bite-size chunks, then put into a lightly oiled baking dish. Add a bunch of quartered mushrooms, then add salt and pepper, and shove in the oven. They need about 15 minutes at around 180C (fan) or 200C\n\nBoil about 300g pasta for 10 minutes in salted water. After 5 minutes add a shit-tonne of broccoli\n\nOnce pasta is done, drain, add frozen peas and sweetcorn, and let that defrost for 30 seconds or so. \n\nstir in passata (crushed tomatoes), enough to make it look saucy, then some Worcester sauce (only a wee bit), lots of basil, lots of garlic powder, and salt and pepper. \n\nGet the sausage/mushrooms out the oven when they are cooked, then pour the pasta into the baking dish and stir round. top with cheese and but back in for about 15 minutes\n\nMakes about 5 servings\n\n\n**pasta pesto**\n\nThis one often isn't cheap, as fucking pine nuts cost crazy money recently. \n\nBoil pasta for 10 mins, adding frozen sweetcorn at the 8 minute mark.\n\nIn a blender, add about two plants of basil, 50g of pine nuts, some oil, and a garlic clove or three, and blend into a paste.\n\nadd to pasta\n\n**Gumbo-ish**\n\nGet 7 boneless chicken thighs (or 3-4 breasts), cover in oil and cajun spice mix, and put in the oven at 180 C for 35 minutes in a large cast iron skillet\n\nChop up 4 stalks of celery, 1/2 an onion, a good amount of mushrooms, 1-2 red bell pepper, a pack of okra a few cloves of garlic, and a good bit of chorizo (with the skin removed) \n\nGet a deep pot, and put in a good few tablespoons of butter, then melt, then add an equal number of heaped tablespoons of flour, and fry the roux very gently so it it begins to colour\n\nWhen the chicken thighs are done, take them out the skillet and rest on a plate, then put the skillet on the hob and gently fry  all the vegetables and chorizo (I normally start with the onion and celery, then add chorizo for a couple minutes, then add everything else,\n\nChop up the chicken into bite size pieces.\n\nonce the veg is done, gradually add a couple liters of water and a chicken stock cube to the roux, and stir until there are no lumps. Add the veg into the pan and the chicken, and make sure the water level fills most the pan. Add a shit-tonne more cajun spice mix, salt, pepper, and some chili powder, and keep tasting and adding what it feels like it needs until it tastes how you want\n\nAdd a couple handfuls of white rice\n\nCook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, as the rice will stick to the bottom\n\n**mushroom pasta**\n\nget pasta boiling\n\nFinely dice loads of mushroom\n\nfry mushroom in a tiny bit of olive oil, and add a bit of salt\n\nonce they have cooked through, and when pasta has about 2 minutes left, add in a smallish nob of butter\n\nstir through 1 very heaped tablespoon of flour\n\nonce everything is combined, add milk bit by bit until a thick creamy sauce is formed. Chuck some sweetcorn into the pasta pot\n\nadd salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some basil (dried works well, but very finely sliced fresh would be awesome)\n\ncombine with pasta and serve.\n\n**marsetti**\n\nget about 500g of pasta boiling in salted water\n\nfinely dice an onion, and get it frying\n\nonce onion is translucent, add in 500g of mince\n\ncook through\n\nonce everything is cooked, mix the frying pan with the pasta, then stir in 1 can of condensed mushroom soup and 1 can of condensed tomato soup, then add salt, pepper, garlic, and MSG.\n\nmove to an oven dish and cover with cheese mixed with breadcrumbs, then bake until everything is golden and crispy\n\n**Lazy mushroom risotto**\n\nChop up 3-4 mushrooms and 1/2 a small onion per person finely diced. \n\nIn a saucepan, fry onions in olive oil for about 5 minutes\n\nadd all the mushrooms and cook for a couple minutes, until they are browned and soft.\n\nAdd some butter then add 75-100g of risotto rice per person. \n\ncook rice in the butter for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly, then add 1/3 of a chicken stock cube per person\n\nadd a good covering of water. You are about to cook it for 20 minutes so don't put too little in\n\ncover and cook on low for 10 minutes, stir, then cook for another 10 minute\n\nIf there is still too much water left cook uncovered for a few minutes whilst stirring. \n\nAdd in s,p, garlic powder, a good bit of basil, some msg, and taste. Fix if it is missing anything\n\n\n**EDIT** **sushi** REMOVED. I just found out I was risking poisoning people with my recipe. Sorry everyone. Here's a nice replacement of a recipe I made yesterday to make up for almost killing people\n\n**Thai Vegetable Curry**\n\nPut rice on\n\nDice an onion and some celery, and finely slice a carrot. Get a deep pan and cook gently in coconut oil\n\nCube up an aborigine, a courgette(Zucchini) a shit-tonne of mushrooms, and some broccoli florets, then add to the pan. Stir in some Thai Curry Paste and coconut milk, then simmer for 15 minutes\n\nFinely slice half a bunch of coriander and 1/2 a lemon, and some spring onions. Fire them in, then taste to see if it needs anything. If it is a bit too thin, mix some cornflour with cold water and add in gently stirring the pan until it thickens\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/5joc74/heres_all_the_recipes_that_kept_me_alive_and/", "created_utc": 1482376989.0, "score": 475, "author": "The_edref", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/5joc74/heres_all_the_recipes_that_kept_me_alive_and/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My version of dal soup", "selftext": "This is a winter staple of mine that changes depending on what bits of veg are looking frumpy in my fridge, my budget, and the amount of time I have. The base is super simple and consists of:\n\n1 large onion, chopped (finely if you can be bothered).\n3 large cloves of minced garlic (at leat).\n1 nubbin (about a thumb) of grated ginger (optional).\n3-4 decently sized carrots, cubed (the smaller, the faster it cooks).\n3-4 hefty potatoes, peeled and cubed somewhat larger than the carrots.\n1.5-2 cups of split peas (any colour) or red/yellow lentils, or as I like a mix of about half and half.\n3 tbs veg oil.\n1.5 tbs of yellow curry power (nothing fancy needed).\nSalt to taste.\n2-2.5 litres (8.5-10 cups) of water, (veg/chicken broth if I have a cube).\n\nSweat the onions and carrots in the oil on medium low heat without browning. When the onions are clear, add the the garlic, ginger, and curry powder and sweat for another minute. Add potatoes, salt, water or broth and bring to a boil. If you\u2019re using both split peas and lentils, add the peas first, they take about 35-40 min to cook so I give them a 20 min head start. (If I\u2019m in a hurry or only have lentils in the pantry, I cut my potatoes small as well and give the veg a 10 min head start.) Red/yellow lentils cook in about 10 minutes and I find that they tend to make the soup stick and burn if I add them too early. Once the split peas and potatoes are starting to fall apart I give it a few hearty stirs with a whisk to give all the starches a chance to thicken it up (if it\u2019s too thick I add some water) and give it a final taste of salt and it\u2019s done. The coriander (cilantro) on top is optional. This base recipe serves 4 hungry people and tastes even better after a night in the fridge. \n\nThings (frumpy veg and leftovers)that go great in this (and stretch the soup):\nCelery or celery root (celeriac) finely diced and sweated in the beginning of the soup.\nLeeks.\nWhite cabbage (a personal favourite of mine).\nCauliflower (in any shape of form).\nCooked chickpeas/green lentils.\nCooked rice.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/cnd5o3h84j7a1.jpg", "created_utc": 1671731567.0, "score": 396, "author": "Dystopiandaywalker", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/zss9qe/my_version_of_dal_soup/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I write 7-day meal plans that are based off of eating for ~$5 a day, here's a recent one!", "selftext": "I share them on [Budget Meal Planner](https://budgetmealplanner.com), along with recipes that have a calculated price per serving.\n\nHere's a recent meal plan I wrote that was based off the Swedish cuisine :) I figured it may help someone here, especially with trying some new things! Eating cheap can sometimes get boring, so I try to switch it up by basing weekly meals off of certain cuisines or ingredients. Enjoy! (A full grocery list is at the bottom)\n\n**BREAKFAST, DAYS 1-4 | SM\u00d6RG\u00c5S**\n\nFor 4 meals: \n\n* 8 slices bread\n* butter\n* a block of cheese and/or sliced meat\n\nVegetarian substitution: bell pepper slices, or another vegetable\n\nYes, open-faced sandwiches are common Swedish breakfast! Go ahead and toast 2 slices of bread, spread some butter on them and add a thin slice of cheese to each. You can then top them with deli-sliced ham, chicken, etc. Or add slices of a hard-boiled egg (also very common).\n\n**BREAKFAST, DAYS 5-7 | MUESLI WITH YOGURT**\n\nFor 3 meals:\n\n* 3 cups muesli / 7dl\n* 3 cups yogurt (any flavor) / 7dl\n\nIf you wanted to be authentic, you would use a soured milk that is almost similar to buttermilk or kefir. But for sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll use yogurt! Mix 1 cup (2.4dl) together with 1 cup (2.4dl) muesli for a quick, easy, and filling breakfast.\n\n**LUNCH, DAYS 1-3 | PYTTIPANNA (HASH)**\n\nFor 3 meals: \n\n* 3 potatoes\n* 1 yellow onion\n* 2 tbsp. butter / 35ml\n* 2 chicken breasts\n* pickled beets (optional)\n\nVegetarian substitution: chickpeas and carrots\n\nThis dish is highly customizable and is a great way to use up any leftovers or food that may spoil soon.\n\nIn a large skillet, add butter and very small diced potatoes. Cook until almost tender. To the same pan, add diced chicken and diced onions. Allow everything to cook through fully, and even get a little crisp.\n\nSeason with salt and black pepper, and anything else you\u2019d like. If you want to be more authentic, you can top this with a fried egg and serve alongside pickled beets. Super tasty either way you choose!\n\nAnd if you\u2019re lazy\u2026 IKEA actually sells a frozen bag of this stuff! Look for \u2018Pyttipanna Kyckling\u2019. Still cheaper than eating out! ;)\n\n**LUNCH, DAYS 4-7 | TACOS (TACOFREDAG STYLE)**\n\nFor 4 meals: \n\n* 8 medium tortillas\n* 2 lb. minced beef / 1kg\n* 1 lb. mushrooms / 500g\n* 1 cucumber\n* 1 small lettuce head\n* 8 oz. corn kernels / 250g\n* 1 cup garlic sauce / 2.4dl\n* taco seasoning\n\nVegetarian substitution: sofritas\n\nTacos are huge in Sweden! So huge, it\u2019s traditional to eat them every Friday. That\u2019s what Tacofredag is. But they\u2019re not the same tacos you\u2019re probably used to\u2026\n\nStart by cooking the minced beef as normal, with taco seasoning. When the beef is about 80% done, add sliced mushrooms.\n\nWhile this is cooking you can prepare the toppings. Dice the cucumber, drain your corn kernels (if canned), and chop lettuce. What\u2019s great is that you can store this and the cooked meat mixture for the rest of the week, to minimize cooking and prepping time.\n\nFor each meal, use 2 tortillas and layer all the ingredients. Top with 2 tbsp. of garlic sauce on each.\n\nTo save the most money, you can easily make garlic sauce with plain yogurt, minced garlic, salt, black pepper, a few chili flakes, and a little squeeze of lemon. Make sure you allow it to sit overnight before eating it.\n\n**DINNER, DAYS 1-4 | K\u00d6TTBULLAR (SWEDISH MEATBALLS)**\n\nFor 4 meals:\n\n* 1 cup bread crumbs\n* 1 1/2 cups milk / 3.5dl\n* 1 yellow onion\n* 7 tbsp. butter / 1dl\n* 1 lb. minced beef / 500g\n* 1 lb. minced pork / 500g\n* 2 eggs\n* 3 potatoes\n* lingonberry jam (optional)\n\nVegetarian substitution: The best alternative would be to buy pre-made vegetarian meatballs\n\nAgain, thanks to IKEA, you honestly can buy authentic frozen Swedish meatballs from there for a decent price. And lingonberry jam, because you will have a hard time finding this in a grocery store.\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine 1 1/4 cups milk (3dl) with the bread crumbs. Let this soak for 10 minutes. While this is soaking, add 1 tbsp. (18ml) butter to a skillet over medium heat. Add minced onions and cook until tender, but not brown. About 3 minutes and remove from heat.\n\nWith the soaked bread crumbs, add onions, minced beef, minced pork, eggs, salt and black pepper. Get your hands dirty and mix everything until combined.\n\nStart forming meatballs about 1-inch (2.5cm) in size. When all of the meat mixture has been rolled, add 4 tbsp. (60ml) butter to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add meatballs to the skillet and brown on all sides. Gently shake the pan often to prevent sticking.\n\nIn a medium saucepan, boil potatoes (skin removed) until tender. Once soft, drain and begin to mash. Add remaining milk and butter and continue mashing until smooth and creamy.\n\nServe 1/4th of the meatballs with 1/4th of the mashed potatoes and add a generous dollop of lingonberry jam. Enjoy!\n\nYou can make a slightly larger batch of the meatballs to enjoy on your morning sm\u00f6rg\u00e5s, super tasty. You only need 3 extra meatballs, slice them thinly (easy to do when cold), and then you\u2019re set for 3 breakfasts. And yes, eat them cold on toast! No need to heat them up once they\u2019ve been cooked fully.\n\n**DINNER, DAYS 5-7 | KALOPS**\n\nFor 3 meals: \n\n* 1 1/2 lb. stew beef / 750g\n* 2 carrots\n* 2 yellow onions\n* 2 tbsp. butter / 35ml\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 1 beef bouillon cube\n* 2 tbsp. flour / 35ml\n* 4 1/4 cups water / 1 liter\n* 3 potatoes\n* pickled beets (optional)\n\nVegetarian substitution: I'm really not sure for this one! Could someone recommend a substitute for meat in stews below? Perhaps just more veggies and potatoes :)\n\nCut carrots and onions however you\u2019d like. Thicker carrots are nice for this stew.\n\nIn a pot over medium-high heat, add butter and beef. Cook until brown. Add carrots, onion, bay leaves, and black pepper. Stir for a few minutes.\n\n Sprinkle in flour and mix well. Pour in water and add a beef bouillon cube, bring to a boil while stirring occasionally.\n\nOnce boiling, bring the heat down to low and let this simmer for about 1 hour until meat is tender. Season with salt and black pepper, if needed.\n\nServe with a boiled potato and pickled beets.\n\n**SNACKS, 7 DAYS | CHOKLADBOLLAR (CHOCOLATE COCONUT BALLS)**\n\nFor 7 snacks:\n\n* 1/2 cup butter / 1.2dl\n* 1 cup sugar / 2.4dl\n* 3 cups rolled oats / 7dl\n* 1 tsp. vanilla extract / 6ml\n* 3 tbsp. cocoa powder / 50ml\n* 2 tbsp. strong coffee / 35ml\n* 2/3 cup coconut flakes / 1.5dl\n\nFun fact: In Sweden, you\u2019d normally eat chokladbollar as part of fika (to be enjoyed with coffee and the company of others). The average Swede fikas twice a day! And yes, fika is a verb and a noun.\n\nI\u2019m all for balance, so some of you may be disappointed that I\u2019m including a sugary dessert. But c\u2019mon, if you really followed this meal plan, then you deserve a reward!\n\nIn a bowl, mix together butter (softened to room temperature), sugar and oats. Stir in cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Add coffee that has been cooled down.\n\nRoll the mixture into 14 balls and coat them in shredded coconut flakes. Refrigerate for few hours and enjoy 2 at a time with a cup of coffee or on its own.\n\n**WEEKLY INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 8 slices bread\n* block of cheese (your favorite one)\n* deli-sliced meat (optional)\n* 3 cups yogurt / 7dl\n* 9 potatoes\n* 4 yellow onions\n* 2 chicken breasts\n* 8 medium tortillas\n* 3 lb. minced beef / 1.5kg\n* 1 lb. mushrooms / 500g\n* 1 cucumber\n* 1 small lettuce head\n* 8 oz. corn kernels / 250g\n* 1 cup garlic sauce / 2.4dl\n* 1 1/2 cups milk / 3.5dl\n* 1 lb. minced pork / 500g\n* 2 eggs\n* 1 1/2 lb. stew beef / 750g\n* 2 carrots\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 2/3 cup coconut flakes / 1.5dl\n\n**SPICES AND STAPLES**\n\n* butter\n* muesli\n* taco seasoning\n* bread crumbs\n* lingonberry jam (optional)\n* pickled beets (optional)\n* 1 beef bouillon cube\n* flour\n* sugar\n* rolled oats\n* vanilla extract\n* cocoa powder\n* coffee", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/cqdaa4/i_write_7day_meal_plans_that_are_based_off_of/", "created_utc": 1565805443.0, "score": 386, "author": "diannamallen", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/cqdaa4/i_write_7day_meal_plans_that_are_based_off_of/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chicken and mushroom soup with pan seared garlic bread", "selftext": "My mother isn't well (cancer) and wanted something warm and filling and I need to keep the costs down soo.... \n\nI got some vegetables: Mushrooms, a white onion, a red pepper and some celery. I had half a red onion in the fridge. One garlic clove for good measure. I'd have liked a carrot or two but the local shop didn't have any. \n\nGave it all a chop ready for cooking. Then onto the chicken! \n\nI have some chicken breasts frozen individually so I plucked one out and defrosted it in the microwave (I didn't have time/foreplanning to let it defrost overnight) whilst chopping the veg. \n\nI cut it into very thin strips, gave it a spritz of oil and sprinkled 1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder, 1 teaspoon of old bay seasoning and a good 'eye balling it' 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Then just gave it a good mixing on the chopping board, making sure everything is mixed well. \nI did put some cling film over it while it was waiting to be cooked, but the vegetables need to cook first! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\nI oiled up the pan that was on low and threw everything but the mushrooms and garlic in. Quick few stirs then ignored it while I watched a movie for about 10-15 minutes.. I got distracted but that's ADHD for you \ud83d\udc4d\nNow that it was starting to cook nicely I gave it a stir, left it for another 20 minutes. \n\nOnce the base veg got softer and had nice crispy bits in went the mushrooms with more butter than I care to admit, also 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme. Mushrooms seem to suck up the butter while they get rid of their moisture, so I let the whole lot cook for a while. \n\nInto a bowl once the mushrooms had little crispy bits and were not rubbery. \n\nChicken bits into the pan next in batches, when slightly browned they go into the bowl with the veg. Once the last batch of chicken is cooked I turned the hob onto max for a minute sor it was very hot the added 250ml of chicken stock made from asda/Walmart cheap chicken cubes. Gets all that cooked goodness off the bottom of the pan, and saves washing up! \n\nThe last bit of the soup is easy, put in a can of condensed mushroom soup. Stir, simmer for along as it takes to make the side. \n\nI'm not sure what bread this is, it was \u00a31.20 for 6 rolls. It made at a localish bakers, tastes and has the mouthfeel of home made bread and normally costs \u00a33 a bag. Bargain. \n\nSliced them open and gave them a little rub of butter to get them going. Once they were a lightly toasted I rubbed a cut garlic glove all over. On went a good amount of butter and a stinking of mixed herbs. Back into the pan they went for about ten minutes on high heat, turning often. \n\nPlate it all up and mum was happy and full. I have left over soup in two tubs ready to freeze so it was four generous meals. \n\nAlso, picture of the rescue who wasn't happy he didnt get any!

{"title": "Smoky Lentil Rice", "selftext": "Smoky is optional. This recipe comes from the website called A Couple Cooks. I never get tired of it. The recipe is vegetarian and dairy free. (i eat meat and dairy and still crave it.)\n\nThis is meant to be used as alternative protein for vegetarians and flavored to taste like it contains smoked meat. I eat it as a side, a filling for tacos or sandwiches, crumble it up cold on salads--and i also eat a double serving for a filling meal. \n\nIt tastes way better than it looks, costs me about 2 USD per entire batch, makes ten cups, and keeps forever. Any of the seasonings can be swapped for your preferences (I've omitted fennel seed, used cumin, chili powder, etc. It's different every time i make it, but this version is the exact recipe as published on A Couple Cooks and shared to here.) The vinegar at the end is critical to balance the flavors i think. I splash water onto portions i reheat in the microwave to keep it moist, and like to serve with sour cream or yogurt, olive oil, and chopped onion, sometimes pumpkin seeds. It's really versatile. \n\nThe rice and lentils are chewy, which is very satisfying, but you could easily add liquid or cook it longer if that's not desired--either by the serving or for the whole batch. \n\nIt's great for this sub in these times because my cost of around 2usd per batch includes the lentils and rice required, the vinegar, and the broth base i use that's pricier than bouillon. The spices you need to buy will work in other dishes and i didn't bother to figure how much it would cost if i had to buy them new by the jar.\n\nThe recipe makes 10 one-cup servings; that's only 350 mg sodium per serving so it's great to share with people on all sorts of restricted diets and infinitely adaptable. When i discovered this recipe in my 40s, i so wished it had always been in my budget arsenal of nutritious food. (it calls for specific lentils, but i use the ones at my store that are cheaper since that's the goal and the French ones aren't available.)\n\nRecipe follows with link to A Couple Cooks where i find it.

{"title": "Ramen noodle stir fry", "selftext": "Ramen noodle stir fry is a cheap- high yielding meal you can cater to fit your personal preferences. My mom got the recipe off a lunchtime episode of Mr. Food back in the 90\u2019s. I cook up 1 lb of ground pork in sesame oil and light soy sauce in a large skillet (I\u2019m sure a wok would be preferable but I use what I have). Prior to cooking the pork I chopped up a bunch of vegetables (orange and red bell pepper, calabacitas, broccoli, cauliflower, and celery). Chop up half a head of green cabbage. You can also use a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables and it\u2019s still just as good. In addition I always like to add the little canned baby corn and water chestnuts. I usually buy a stir fry sauce I like because I don\u2019t have the correct ingredients to make my own sauce. Then you need a couple packages of ramen noodles- you won\u2019t use the seasoning packets so any brand/flavor will work. Add the vegetables (besides the cabbage, squash and the corn and the water chestnuts) to the undrained pork. Season with more sesame oil and soy sauce. I cooked the vegetables between 8-10 mins (with the lid on- stirring frequently) then added in the cabbage and stir well. Cook (again with the lid on) until the cabbage has reduced by half and then add in the rest of the vegetables. I also added in about 1 1/2 Tbsps of jarlic (I don\u2019t like chopping garlic and don\u2019t have a press so I use the jarred stuff). Cook until the squash are nearly soft. Add in (2-3 packages) of crushed ramen noodles, and then either add about 3/4 cup of water (I used some extra reduced sodium chicken broth I had in the fridge) to start. Put the lid on and stir about every 2 mins, adding more liquid as needed until the noodles are cooked. Once everything is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed add your sauce, and cook a few more minutes until everything is coated and heated through. \n\nThis makes a HUGE amount of food (taking shortcuts like using frozen vegetables/ using the jarred sauce) will cut your time down.

{"title": "Curried lentil and potato burritos", "selftext": "So as someone who\u2019s lost 100+lbs by mostly changing eating I\u2019ve definitely had to look into nutrition and meal prep/ planning. Recently came across lentil burritos for healthy / filling meals and snack. Not including the cost of the Jamaican curry powder as the price online at Walmart was way more than when I purchased in store. Went with the canned food for convenience this time due to time constraints to soak and pressure cook and all. Negating minimal cost of seasonings and cooking oil. It was about $10 for the supplies and would have net 6 full size burritos if I hadnt already used a few tortillas in the past for other dishes. So $2 or under per burrito. \n\nFor this recipe :\n-2 cans GV organic lentils , rinsed and drained \n- 1 can whole mini potato\u2019s , rinsed and drained and sliced up \n-1 large yellow onion , quartered and thinly sliced \n-1 pack GV flour tortillas , burrito size \n-GV fine shred fiesta blend ( 4 cheese ) \n\nSpices :\nDusting of Goya adobo ( to season the potatoes with salt/ garlic ) \n1 Tbsp Jamaican curry powder ( to season the lentils ) \n1 tsp-ish Knorr tomato boullion powder ( very little to get the tomato taste but without watery tomatoes ) \n\nDirections :\nTop and tail onion , remove outer layer , either quarter the onion , or halve it,  fine slice and cut those in half. Saut\u00e9 til translucent. Toss in chopped potatos till warmed thru . Add Goya adobo, and stir. Add in drained lentils and curry powder and stir till cooked thru. Just a few minutes before end of cooking add the little amount of knorr tomato powder and let it cook in. \n\nFrom there let it cook down and fill the tortillas while remembering that it needs to be in the bottom third of tortilla to roll properly. Add little bit of cheese to hold together and for taste. I call it chipotle style rolling for bottom 1/3 filling , take bottom part and go over food and kinda swipe back to lock it in , fold both sides on and roll till the top of burrito is sitting on top of the tortilla flap. I might recommend warming the tortillas just a little to make more pliable as I ripped a tiny corner on one or two on the folded corners on side. \n\nafterwards toss them into a heated pan at about a medium to medium-high heat ( 5 or up to 7 out of 10 dial ). Remember to flip in the direction that makes sure the burrito keeps the flap closed instead of unraveling.

{"title": "Baked potatoes are my biggest budget food hack", "selftext": "Hi there, I hope you all have a splendid Sunday. Sending good vibes. Let's talk about baked potatoes. For me they're the ultimate budget food hack. I buy potatoes in bulk and usually do a tray of baked potatoes at least once a week. A few of them will be eaten directly as lovely baked potatoes \ud83d\ude0d. \n\nBut I will let the bulk cool out and put them in the fridge. Here they last a few days and they are a great base for some quick meals: \n\nBreakfast potatoes: just dice a few of the baked potatoes from the fridge and fry them up in a pan. Add some onions garlic paprika and whatever other leftovers you have, like sausage or meat and add a few eggs in the end. Cheap and powerful breakfast. \n\nPotato salad: just dice the baked potatoes and add some mayonnaise, onion, gherkins and paprika and you have a quick potato salad. \n\nHash browns: just shred them in a bowl and combine with some flour, egg, salt, pepper and spices. You can even add herbs or cheese. \n\nTwice baked potatoes: just soup them out, fill them to your liking and quickly heat them up in the oven or microwave. \n\nPotato burrito: Mash, shred or just cut the baked potato and fry in a pan with some eggs, cheese, bacon and other available leftovers. Fill in a tortilla. \n\nPotato soup: just peel and blend the potato with some broth, milk and seasonings and you have a simple potato soup.\n\nLoaded potato skillet: cut the baked potatoes up and saute with some onion, garlic, peppers and other available leftovers. Then top with cheese and eggs. \n\nI hope this can inspire some of you and maybe help a little.

{"title": "These bot accounts are getting out of control.", "selftext": "Every time I see a post from this subreddit make it to my front page it's some expensive lobster/crab/steak dish, and after checking this subreddit out I now know why - this subreddit is riddled with bots right now. Nearly the entire front page are accounts with generic cooking related usernames like \"[XYZ]'s-kitchen\" or \"[XYZ]Cooking\" or \"the[XYZ]chef\" or suspiciously generic general names like \"Ken1995\" or \"Matt2019\" with an account with no interaction that's solely dedicated to posting recipes on different subreddits that are suspiciously always linking to some food blog website and advertised with professional glamor shots of the food they're \"sharing\". And all of these posts are obviously just spammed all over reddit with zero regard for whether they're relevant to the subs they're posting them in.\n\nSuspiciously, these posts are also consistently upvoted, yet people in the comments are almost always all complaining - it seems like these accounts are probably buying votes to manipulate their post to the front page consistently, and that's incredibly clear when you see that any post by a regular reddit user gets easily 1/10th of the votes.\n\nSomething needs to be done about this. It's absolutely ruining this subreddit that I've used as a useful resource for affordable, healthy and delicious recipes for years now.\n\n/u/zakariazahidi1999 is a bot.\n\nThe suspiciously similarly named /u/zak2O18 is also a bot.\n\n/u/cookingandcraft is a bot.\n\n/u/This_Is_Tasty is *possibly* a bot, if not a dedicated advertisement reddit account that promotes their own youtube\n\n/u/Ebro18 is most likely a bot (they have only one post that seems normal in a sea of link spam - but it's possible that these bot accounts are made to do that from time to time to evade detection?\n\nThese are all just from the front page, several of which have multiple posts on there, and only the ones that have no activity on their account other than recipe spam - there were many others that mostly spammed recipes, but had a few comments here and there so I didn't post them here. If anyone else finds more, share them because I may start blocking them one by one if they aren't banned.\n\nEdit: additional suggestion - if it's too much to root out all of the bots, maybe a rule can be implemented where the cost per serving has to be included in the title of the thread. It's not too difficult to look up the cost of different ingredients, add all of those together and then divide it by the amount of servings in the recipe - but bots aren't going to go through that effort since they don't even go through the effort of making their spam content relevant. Adding the cost of the food will both improve this sub's content, help ensure it's kept as an actual *budget* food, and weed out the bots in one fell swoop.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/sw0w14/these_bot_accounts_are_getting_out_of_control/", "created_utc": 1645243176.0, "score": 340, "author": "MetallHengst", "num_comments": 45, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/sw0w14/these_bot_accounts_are_getting_out_of_control/", "html_title": ""}

I'm a student and I had to move in a different apartment two years ago. Broke up with abusive boyfriend etc. My rent is more expensive than before, I can't really do anything else atm than to eat cheaper, and try to get my school done.\n\nFor The context I'm about 5'3 tall and weight about 120 lbs. Woman, early 20's. When I see people my age and size eating, I'm always wondering how are they surviving. I'm not hating on them, I have a really hard time eating enough to not be tired all The time and to not lose weight.\n\nI eat smaller breakfast, huge lunch at school (full plate, full salad plate, two breads and a dessert). After I come home from school, I'm so hungry that I need to eat some snacks before dinner. Usually bread or a microwave pizza, because I need it immediately, and they are very cheap.\n\nThen a huge dinner. I once ate 400g ground beef with gravy and pasta, and I was full after that.\n\nAnd something in The evening. Maybe bread again with some yougurt.\n\nI can't understand this. About 6 months ago out of curiosity I tried to count my calories to stay on The maintenance (2000 kcl), but not overeat. I was hoping I would save some money that way, because I thought I was overreacting. I was dizzy all The time, lost 14 lbs weight... Didn't go well.\n\nI'd really like some advice on meals that are _filling_, but cheap. Actually as cheap as possible.

This homemade creamy rabokki combines cheap instant noodles with homemade rice cakes for a restaurant-quality meal that costs pennies to make! The video for this is on my channel\u2764\ufe0f link in bio if you wanna show some love!\n\nIngredients\nFor the DIY Rice Cakes (saves $$$):\n- 1 cup glutinous rice flour (~$2 for a bag that makes multiple batches)\n- 1/2 cup hot water\n- 2 pinches of salt\n- Neutral oil (for greasing hands/surface)\n\nFor the main dish:\n- 1 pack Indomie instant ramen (only ~$0.50 each!)\n- 3 sausages (about 150-180g), sliced (use whatever's on sale)\n- 1 boiled egg, peeled\n- 1 tbsp unsalted butter (or neutral oil)\n- 1 tsp minced garlic\n- 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste - one tub lasts months!)\n- 1 cup milk (whole milk or unsweetened oat/soy milk)\n- 1/4 cup water\n- 1 tsp soy sauce\n- 1 tsp sugar\n- 1 Indomie seasoning packet\n- Optional: 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella or cheddar cheese\n- Optional: green onions and sesame seeds for topping\n\nInstructions\n1. Make the Rice Cakes (Saves you $5+ compared to store-bought!)\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine:\n   - 1 cup glutinous rice flour\n   - 2 pinches of salt\n   - Gradually pour in 1/2 cup hot water, stirring as you go.\n2. Mix into a soft dough.\n3. Lightly oil your hands and roll the dough into small logs, about finger-thick and 2-3 inches long.\n4. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the shaped tteok.\n5. Cook until they float to the top.\n6. Once floating, remove them and immediately place in a bowl of cold water.\n7. After a brief soak, drain and transfer to an empty bowl. Set aside.\n\n2. Cook the Sausages\n- Heat a pan over medium heat and saut\u00e9 the sliced sausages for about 3-4 minutes until browned. Remove and set aside.\n\n3. Prepare the Creamy Sauce\nIn the same pan:\n1. Add butter and let it melt.\n2. Stir in minced garlic and gochujang, saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds until fragrant.\n3. Pour in milk, water, soy sauce, sugar, and ONE Indomie seasoning packet.\n4. Mix until everything is dissolved into a smooth sauce. Bring to a gentle simmer.\n\n4. Assemble the Dish\n1. Add the prepared rice cakes and simmer for 3-5 minutes until soft and chewy.\n2. Add back the cooked sausage and toss to coat.\n3. Add the cooked Indomie noodles and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until sauce thickens.\n4. If using, stir in shredded cheese for a richer, creamier texture.\n\n5. Finishing Touches\n- Add the boiled egg, halved or whole.\n- Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds if you like.\n\nMoney-Saving Tips:\n- Make double batch of rice cakes and freeze extras for next time\n- Use any cheap protein - hot dogs, tofu, or leftover chicken all work!\n- Milk about to expire? Perfect time to make this!\n- One jar of gochujang makes dozens of meals - best bang for your buck\n- Skip the cheese if you're really pinching pennies\n\nTotal cost: Under $3 per serving with homemade rice cakes vs. $12+ at Korean restaurants!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/f5zb8u8ez5xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745666715.0, "score": 75, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1k8aqm6/budgetfriendly_homemade_creamy_rabokki_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

Just made these mini chocolate cinnamon rolls in my air fryer for the first time and had to share this budget win. They taste like coffee shop treats at a fraction of the cost!\n\nCost breakdown: About $3-4 total for 9-12 rolls (30-45\u00a2 each vs $4-5 at cafes!)\n\nMini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Style)\nMakes 9-12 rolls\n\nDough:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 2 tbsp sugar\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- \u00be cup warm milk (38-40\u00b0C)\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted\n- 1 egg (room temperature)\n\nFilling:\n- 2 tbsp softened butter\n- 2 tbsp brown sugar\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\n- \u00bc cup mini chocolate chips/chopped chocolate\n\nOptional Glaze:\n- \u00bc cup cream cheese, softened\n- 2 tbsp powdered sugar\n- 1 tbsp butter, soft\n- Splash of milk or vanilla\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.\n\n2. Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough and roll into a rectangle about 10x12 inches. Spread softened butter, sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. Roll tightly from the short side and slice into 9-12 mini rolls.\n\n3. Second rise: Place rolls in a parchment-lined air fryer tray, spaced slightly apart. Cover lightly and let rise for 30-40 minutes until puffed up.\n\n4. Air fry: Preheat air fryer at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for 3 minutes. Air fry rolls at 160\u00b0C for 8-10\nminutes until golden on top and soft inside. You may need to do this in 2 batches.\n\n5. Glaze: Mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth. Spread over warm rolls.\n\nPro tips:\n- For extra gooey centers, add a few more chocolate chips in the spiral.\n- A pinch of salt on top of the glaze enhances the flavor.\n- If tops brown too quickly, loosely cover with foil during air frying.\n- No cream cheese? Make a simple glaze with just powdered sugar and milk!\n\nThese are seriously addictive and WAY cheaper than anything you'll find at a bakery. The air fryer batch size is perfect if you're cooking for 1-2 people and don't want leftovers going stale.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with air fryer baking to save on energy costs?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/5plsuopebsue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744629562.0, "score": 55, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1jywe08/budgetfriendly_mini_chocolate_cinnamon_rolls_air/", "html_title": ""}

Maybe even go for a walk for exercise.\n\nI have this stupid notion in my head that I can\u2019t just GO HOME, eat lunch, then leave the house again!!\n\nNearly ALL of my appointments and stores are less than 5-7 miles from my home.\n\nYet\u2026I nearly always resort to fast food.\n\nIt\u2019s killing my health as well as my budget.\n\nMY MAIN QUESTION: what are some quick, easy, tasty foods to keep stocked at home, to give me a reason to stop at home and eat healthy?\n\nI strongly dislike leftovers.  Call it childhood \u201ctrauma\u201d if you will.\n\nEDIT: telling me I\u2019m ridiculous for not liking leftovers, and continuing to recommend leftovers\u2026is like telling a Vegan to just eat a steak, because everyone else does it!!\n\nI F\u2019ING HATE LEFTOVERS!!!

{"title": "Bread butts (heels) and what to do about them.", "selftext": "This was a comment I made under a different post in a different subreddit but I realized it might be more useful over here. Some people don\u2019t like eating them or their kids outright refuse and often they end up getting trashed. Well, you can save them in your freezer and use them up in bread pudding if you want to cut down of food waste.\n\nThis is a recipe I made for people who can\u2019t afford or abide food waste and may have a limited budget or resources to scrounge up, but it\u2019s good for anybody and if you want to make it fancy by using fancy ingredients the rest of the steps are the same:\n\nFrench Toast bread pudding:\n\nYou will need a loaf pan, baking sheet, and and oven at 350F\n\n- Bag of butts (heels, ends, crusts your kids made you cut off, any other bread scraps. Go ahead and mix types, even stale baked goods like croissants or muffins)\n\n- Eggs\n\n- Milk or cream (also a good way to use up expired dairy, which is safe to cook with)\n\n- Optional: Fruit (frozen, fresh, even dried works if you soak it in warm water for 5min and strain it. Also use up overripe or bruised fruit your family will probably avoid and let go bad)\n\n- Cinnamon (optional: nutmeg, cloves, allspice, pumpkin or chai spice.)\n\n- Vanilla\n\n- Sugar\n\nCube the bread. You want enough to fill a loaf pan (or if you have a lot you can use a casserole dish). \n\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl. For one loaf pan\u2019s worth you will need 3 eggs, but you can make do with 2 large eggs if you supplement with extra dairy. Use more eggs if you want, or aren\u2019t on a budget and want the pudding to be more substantial.\n\nNext, add in your dairy. Depending on your available resources, the ratio of eggs to dairy can be 2:1 (recommended) or 1:1 or anywhere in between. So if you have 1 cup of beaten eggs you can use anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup of milk or cream. If your budget demands a very milk-heavy batch, you can add a 1/4tsp of cornstarch to firm up the pudding.\n\nNext, whisk in your chosen spices and vanilla. (Another budget tip: if you don\u2019t have spices available, you can use a tea bag. Pour just enough boiling water into a cup to wet the bag, about 1/8cup, and let it soak until cool, then squeeze out the tea bag. The concentrated tea liquid can then be added to the egg mix. Avoid herbal tea flavours like mint or chamomile, instead use chai or black tea or spice/fruit teas) \n\nStir your bread into the egg mix and let it soak in for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally so all the bread gets soaked. \n\nAdd in your chopped/frozen fruit, and spoon into your greased loaf pan. Sprinkle some sugar on top. \n\nPlace the loaf pan onto a baking sheet with a thin layer of water on the bottom and bake at 350F for 20-30 min or until the top is crisp and the centre is cooked through.\n\nDepending on your egg/dairy ratio you might be able to slice the loaf when it\u2019s done, otherwise just spoon it out like a casserole. Serve with butter, and syrup or a sprinkling of sugar.\n\n\nETA just wanted to say I am loving all the other ideas, some so practical and others incredibly creative. Keep it coming!

If not everything is below as usual.\n\nIngredients:\n- Flour: 325g (2\u00bd cups)\n- Slightly warm milk: 190ml (\u00be cup + 2 tsp)\n- Butter: 50g (3\u00bd tbsp)\n- Instant yeast: 1 tsp (or 1\u00bc tsp active dry yeast)\n- Sugar: 2\u00bd tbsp (30g)\n- Salt: 1\u00bc tsp (7g)\n- Sausages: 8 pieces\n\nInstructions:\n1. Prepare the Dough:\n   - Mix warm milk, sugar, yeast, salt, butter, and flour until a shaggy dough forms\n   - Knead until soft and elastic\n\n2. First Proofing:\n   - Let dough rise for 30 minutes, covered\n   - Meanwhile, lightly brown sausages in a skillet, then cool\n\n3. Divide and Shape:\n   - Divide dough into 8 equal pieces (74g each)\n   - Roll each into a ball, then into a thin sheet\n   - Form into cylinders, seal edges\n   - Roll each into 10-12 inch ropes (thicker in middle)\n   - Wrap around sausages, tucking in ends\n   - Place on parchment-lined baking sheet with space between\n\n4. Second Proofing:\n   - Cover and let rise 45-60 minutes until puffy\n   - Brush with egg wash, add optional sesame seeds\n\n5. Bake:\n   - 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 18-20 minutes until golden\n   - Place on lower rack to prevent over-browning\n   - Brush with butter immediately after baking\n\nPro Tips for Budget-Friendly Perfection:\n\n1. Upgrade your sausages: Mix cheap ground meat with caramelized onions and spices to make your own premium-tasting sausage filling at fraction of the cost\n\n2. Tangzhong method: Replace 2 tbsp of flour and 10 tbsp of milk with a cooked roux (mix and heat until thickened) for extra softness that lasts days\n\n3. Freezer-friendly: Make a double batch and freeze half before the second rise - thaw overnight in fridge when ready to bake\n\n4. Leftover transformation: Slice leftover rolls into rounds and toast for \"sausage coins\" - kids love these in soup or as snacks\n\n5. Flavor boosters: Add 1 tsp garlic powder and \u00bd tsp dried herbs to the dough for extra flavor without extra cost\n\n6. Perfect proofing hack: Use your microwave as a proofing box - heat a cup of water for 2 minutes, remove, then place dough inside (don't turn microwave on)\n\n7. Milk substitute: Use water with 1 tbsp powdered milk for even more savings if fresh milk is expensive\n\n8. Stretch your ingredients: Add 1/2 cup finely diced vegetables (carrot, onion, cabbage) to your sausage mixture to make it go further\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jirdqf", "created_utc": 1742824959.0, "score": 324, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1jirdqf/solved_the_secret_to_bakerystyle_sausage_rolls_at/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

But everything is below too nonetheless\u2764\ufe0f\n\nBurger Bun Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n- 3/4 cup + 2 tsp milk\n- 1 tbsp sugar\n- 1 1/4 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp yeast\n- 50g butter\n- 325g flour\n\nInstructions:\n1. Combine milk, sugar, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Stir well and let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.\n2. Add the butter and gradually mix in the flour until a smooth dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until elastic and smooth.\n4. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled (about 1-1.5 hours).\n5. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions (to make 4 bun halves for 2 complete burgers).\n6. Shape into rounds and place on a baking sheet. Cover and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.\n7. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n8. Bake in air fryer at 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.\n\n Double Beef Patty Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n- 500g beef mince\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp black pepper\n- 1 tsp garlic powder\n- 1 tsp onion powder\n- 1 tsp paprika\n- 2 tbsp BBQ sauce\n- 2 tbsp cold grated butter\n\nInstructions:\n1. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix gently (avoid overmixing).\n2. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions (125g each) to make 2 patties per burger.\n3. Shape into patties slightly larger than your buns (they'll shrink when cooking).\n4. Make a slight indent in the center of each patty (prevents bulging while cooking).\n5. Refrigerate patties for at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n6. Cook in a hot pan or grill for 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness.\n7. Brush with BBQ sauce when almost done.\n8. Add cheddar cheese on top of each patty and cover lid to melt.\n \nIngredients:\n- 4 burger bun halves (2 tops, 2 bottoms)\n- 4 cooked beef patties with melted cheddar\n- Sliced red onions\n- Sliced tomatoes\n- Fresh lettuce leaves\n- Pickle slices\n- Special sauce (from previous recipe to be mentioned in your video)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Toast the cut sides of the buns if desired.\n2. Spread special sauce on the bottom bun.\n3. Layer with lettuce and tomato slices.\n4. Place the first cheese-topped patty.\n5. Add the second cheese-topped patty directly on top of the first.\n6. Add pickles and red onion slices.\n7. Spread more sauce on the top bun, if desired.\n8. Place the top bun over the assembled ingredients.\n\nTips for Success\n\n- For juicier double patties: Make each patty thinner than you would for a single patty burger (about 1/2 inch thick).\n- Patty size: Make the patties slightly larger than your buns as they will shrink during cooking.\n- Even cooking: Ensure all patties are uniform in thickness for consistent cooking.\n- Cheese placement: Add cheese to both patties for maximum flavor.\n- Stacking strategy: Place the patties directly on top of each other to create a true double burger experience.\n- For the buns: This recipe makes 4 bun halves, perfect for 2 complete burgers.\n- Air fryer batches: You may need to bake the buns in batches depending on your air fryer size.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/wjwxnbcjw6qe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742626925.0, "score": 661, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1jh2r3a/i_recreated_my_favorite_restaurants_18_double/", "html_title": ""}

With the motor running, slowly add about 1 cup of the reserved soaking liquid and blend until you get a smooth, light, and fluffy batter. Do not let the batter overheat. To check that it has been blended well, drop a little into a bowl of water. If the batter rises to the top, it has been blended enough. Pour the batter into a large bowl.\n\n    Drain the rice. Drain the soaked rice through the fine-mesh strainer, reserving the soaking liquid.\n\n    Blend the rice. Place the soaked rice in the now-empty blender (no need to rinse). With the motor running, slowly add about 1 cup of the reserved soaking liquid. Once blended, add in 1/4 cup cooked rice and continue blending until you have a mostly smooth batter that feels a little grainy when you rub it between two fingers.\n\n    Mix the blended rice and dal. Pour the rice batter into the urad batter and add 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt. Stir together with your hand \u2014 the heat in your hand is good to kick-start the fermentation process, while also adding in more wild yeast. You should have a loose, thick batter that falls through your hands easily but also coats your fingers at the same time.\n\n    Ferment the batter. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and place in a warm place (80 to 90\u00baF). (I usually place my batter in the oven with the light on and a large bowl of hot tap water on the rack below it. I change out the water a few times to keep the temperature warm and humid in the oven.) Let ferment 8 to 14 hours.\n\n    Check that the batter has fermented. When fermented, your batter will have almost doubled and look puffed on the top. It will also have a sour, fermented smell. When scooped with a spoon, it should be a frothy mass of bubbles. Note that in colder climates, the batter may not rise as much, but if it has the frothy, bubbly look and smells fermented, you can start making dosas with it.\n\n\nCook the dosas:\n\n  Stir the batter. Stir the batter a couple of times with a ladle. Ideally, you will have a thick, flowing batter with a consistency between cr\u00eape and pancake batter. If too thick, add filtered water a tablespoon at a time to thin it out.\n\n Prepare for cooking. Before cooking the dosas, set out a little bowl with ghee or oil, a teaspoon, a spatula, a cup of water, and a few paper towels or a silicone pastry brush by the stove. I use a 1/3 measuring cup and a slightly curved large serving spoon, flat ladle, or the measuring cup to spread my dosa.\n\n Heat a skillet with ghee. Heat a large cast iron skillet, griddle, or nonstick pan over medium heat. (If you are a first timer, I suggest that you start with a nonstick pan, as it will be more forgiving than the cast iron which you can work yourself up to.) Add a couple drops of ghee or oil to the pan and lightly smear it all over with a paper towel or silicone pastry brush. If you have a sprayer for oil that will work best here. At this point, you don\u2019t want to put too much ghee or oil, as this will make it difficult to spread the batter evenly. Sprinkle a few drops of water into the pan \u2014 if it sizzles, the pan is ready. Reduce the heat to low.\n\n Pour in batter. Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into the center of the pan. The batter should sizzle a bit.\n\n Spread the batter. Starting in the middle, swirl the batter using the bottom of a slightly curved large serving spoon, flat ladle, or measuring cup in a circular motion outwards until you have spread it out into a round dosa that is about 9 inches in diameter. It is important not to press down too hard with your spreading utensil. Spreading should happen more on the top surface than on the bottom.\n\n  Add ghee to the edges and top of dosa. Increase the heat to medium. Wait a few seconds for the dosa to sizzle a little in the pan, and then drizzle about 1 teaspoon of ghee or oil around the edges of the dosa and on top.\n\n Cook the dosa. Cook until the dosa is dried out on top and you can see some browning and crisp spots appearing on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. When it\u2019s ready, the dosa will peel off easily when you slide a flat spatula underneath. If you see the dosa browning but it is still sticking, just lower the heat and wait a few seconds, then probe around the edges with your spatula until you find an area that starts to give. Usually the whole dosa will unstick once you start to pull it up from that spot.\n\n Flip the dosa. Flip the dosa over and let cook for a few seconds. Flip it over again.\n\nFold the dosa. If serving as-is, fold the dosa in half in the pan, then transfer it onto a plate for serving.\n\nOr fill and fold the dosa. To serve as masala dosa, spread a spoonful or two of potato palya on one half of the dosa. Fold the dosa in half in the pan to cover the filling, then slide it onto a plate for serving.\n\nRepeat with the remaining batter. Cool down the pan so you can easily spread your next dosa and prevent it from sticking to the pan by sprinkling in a little water. When the sizzling stops, heat the pan back up for the next dosa. Mix the dosa batter well before cooking the next one.\n\nServe the dosas. Serve the dosas with chutney and sambar, or sprinkle with chutney pudi and serve with plain yogurt.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6yznt", "created_utc": 1741492202.0, "score": 57, "author": "Additional-Wall-6747", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1j6yznt/dosa_as_budget_breakfast/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Caps reserved for another application.\n\n\\- Tomatoes not yet used. They'll be part of tomorrow's dinner, along with buttered bread and smoked herring.\n\n\\- Green onions washed and trimmed. Trimmings in the stock pot. Green tops used for cilantro-tofu dressing. Whites not yet used.\n\n\\- Carrots peeled and trimmed. Trimmings in the stock pot. 3-4 smallest carrots cut into plain sticks for eating, put into container of water in fridge. 3-4 middle-sized carrots cut into sticks for pickling with daikon. Remaining carrots shredded on large box grater. 2C shredded carrots reserved for baking; remaining carrots added to salted cabbage.\n\n\\- Sweet peppers washed and cored. Seeds and green stem removed from cores before adding them to the stock pot. Flesh in container in fridge.\n\n\\- Cilantro washed. Stems removed and put in the stock pot. Leaves used to make cilantro-tofu dressing.\n\n\\- Ginger not yet used. Purchased for making ginger-sesame salad dressing.\n\n\\- Daikon washed and peeled. Ends trimmed and added to stock pot. Cut in half, then each half into wedges. Quick pickled in 1/2C water, 1/2C white vinegar, 1.5 Tbsp brown sugar and 1.5 tsp salt, along with about 1lb carrot sticks. Contained with brine in refrigerator.\n\n\\- Peeled and matchsticked the rutabaga. Brined in 4C water + 1Tbsp salt for 3 hours. Drained, rinsed, mixed with 1Tbsp gochujang + 1/4 apple, shredded. This will ferment at room temp for a day or two.\n\n\\- Green cabbage trimmed and cored. Washed outer leaves and core added to stock pot. Cabbage sliced thinly in shreds, then massaged with 1/2 Tbsp salt and approx. 1lb shredded carrot. In a container in the fridge, to be used as a salad or as a quickly sauteed side.\n\n\\- 1/4 of one Gala apple shredded and added to rutabaga ferment. Rest of that apple eaten for dessert. Remaining apples not yet used, but they'll be added to baked goods.\n\n\\- Stock pot. After adding all trimmings, filled with 8C water, along with 2 bay leaves, 2 pieces of kombu (optional), 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp bouillon powder. Simmer for 30 minutes, cool, drain and refrigerate. 2L of broth for free!\n\nI also bought a bag of potatoes. When I get around to cooking them, I'll go through the whole bag and pick out the ones with the least life left in them and/or ones with big cuts, holes or blemishes. Once they're washed and trimmed, they'll be fine, plus once they're out of the bag, the others will last a bit longer. Next time I go for potatoes, I'll roughly sort them by size into Big and Small and use them on that basis. Using all Big or all Small potatoes makes it easier to cut them into even pieces that will cook evenly.\n\nIn total, I spent $37 for all of this, plus two packages of soft tofu and one container of yogurt.

I will go to the ends of the earth for a good deal, and often have to stop myself from buying a thing just because it's marked down. So when I tell you it hurt me to pay full price for some ground meat today (beef and pork), I need you to believe me. A total of 3 lbs of meat cost me $19 entire human monies.\n\nThis is for a special occasion - a birthday dinner - so it's already outside the norm. At the store, it's more money per pound for a smaller package of ground beef (because of course it is), so I grab the bigger one. They've only got one size of ground pork. I grab both and come home.\n\nSo, because I got more beef than I needed, I split that package in half. One half gets mixed with the pork and gets braised for an hour with a half-can of diced tomatoes and some stock cubes. Only half of this braise will go in the final dish. The other half might make some chili or sloppy joes or something - or might get frozen for another time.\n\nThe second half of the ground beef gets mixed up into meatballs and baked with the other half-can of tomatoes. We picked up a giant bag of mixed buns for $3, so the ones we don't use for garlic bread will do for meatball sandwiches.\n\nAll this to say, what started as a bum-clenching expense to write into the weekly budget has been transformed into three family meals for five people. And that is exactly my kind of nonsense.\n\nRecipe for Meatballs\n\nFor every 1 lb of meat, add 1 tsp salt, 1 large egg, 1/4 C breadcrumbs, up to 1 Tbsp dried herbs and spices, and up to 3/4 C of vegetables (shredded carrot, diced onion, chopped spinach or kale, fresh herbs). This mixture can be used to make meatballs, meatloaf, or can be spread into a 1/2\" layer on a baking sheet for what I call 'sandwich meatloaf'.\n\nAs meatballs, put in a baking dish with about 1 C of sauce (diced tomatoes, thinned BBQ sauce, etc) and bake at 350F for 30 minutes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1ixiy0s/more_than_i_bargained_for/", "created_utc": 1740446694.0, "score": 53, "author": "Disastrous-Wing699", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1ixiy0s/more_than_i_bargained_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Curried lentil and potato burritos", "selftext": "So as someone who\u2019s lost 100+lbs by mostly changing eating I\u2019ve definitely had to look into nutrition and meal prep/ planning. Recently came across lentil burritos for healthy / filling meals and snack. Not including the cost of the Jamaican curry powder as the price online at Walmart was way more than when I purchased in store. Went with the canned food for convenience this time due to time constraints to soak and pressure cook and all. Negating minimal cost of seasonings and cooking oil. It was about $10 for the supplies and would have net 6 full size burritos if I hadnt already used a few tortillas in the past for other dishes. So $2 or under per burrito. \n\nFor this recipe :\n-2 cans GV organic lentils , rinsed and drained \n- 1 can whole mini potato\u2019s , rinsed and drained and sliced up \n-1 large yellow onion , quartered and thinly sliced \n-1 pack GV flour tortillas , burrito size \n-GV fine shred fiesta blend ( 4 cheese ) \n\nSpices :\nDusting of Goya adobo ( to season the potatoes with salt/ garlic ) \n1 Tbsp Jamaican curry powder ( to season the lentils ) \n1 tsp-ish Knorr tomato boullion powder ( very little to get the tomato taste but without watery tomatoes ) \n\nDirections :\nTop and tail onion , remove outer layer , either quarter the onion , or halve it,  fine slice and cut those in half. Saut\u00e9 til translucent. Toss in chopped potatos till warmed thru . Add Goya adobo, and stir. Add in drained lentils and curry powder and stir till cooked thru. Just a few minutes before end of cooking add the little amount of knorr tomato powder and let it cook in. \n\nFrom there let it cook down and fill the tortillas while remembering that it needs to be in the bottom third of tortilla to roll properly. Add little bit of cheese to hold together and for taste. I call it chipotle style rolling for bottom 1/3 filling , take bottom part and go over food and kinda swipe back to lock it in , fold both sides on and roll till the top of burrito is sitting on top of the tortilla flap. I might recommend warming the tortillas just a little to make more pliable as I ripped a tiny corner on one or two on the folded corners on side. \n\nafterwards toss them into a heated pan at about a medium to medium-high heat ( 5 or up to 7 out of 10 dial ). Remember to flip in the direction that makes sure the burrito keeps the flap closed instead of unraveling.

{"title": "The Tumbledown Method of Meal Planning", "selftext": "My favourite cookbook of all time is Economy Gastronomy. I recommend it to anyone who asks what cookbook to get, and bought it a second time when I was forced to leave my cookbook collection behind.\n\nI mention this because a core tenet of that book is the idea of 'tumbledown' meals. That is, making a large batch of something that acts as an ingredient in subsequent meals. It can help to think of it as upcycling leftovers, so that rather than eating the same thing over and over, you have a similar thing with minor alterations that makes less work overall.\n\nThe example I'll use begins with this recipe:\n\n**Vegetarian Braised Mince**\n\n300 g finely diced mushrooms\n\n3 Tbsp oil\n\n3 C frozen diced onions (about 3 diced onions)\n\n6 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped (about 3 Tbsp)\n\n200 g raw brown lentils, rinsed and drained\n\n2 C TVP mixed with 2 C water\n\n400 g chopped tomatoes (about 1/2 a can)\n\n1 Tbsp soy sauce\n\n3 beef stock cubes + 1L boiling water\n\nIn a large, deep-sided skillet, heat oil over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook until most of the water is cooked out. Add onion and garlic, and saute until onions are transluscent. Stir in remaining ingredients and let simmer uncovered for about 1 hour.\n\nCool and divide into 3. Use as an add-in for tomato sauce.\n\nI make a batch of this mince every few months. One third of a batch can mix into some tomato sauce and be used as part of a lasagna, so I can make three homemade lasagnas over that period of months with far less effort than such a task would typically demand.\n\nI also recently took a dose of this recipe and made it into a 'meatball' mix using this recipe:\n\n**Beef Meatballs**\n\nFor mix:\n\n500g ground beef\n\n1 large egg\n\n1/4 C breadcrumbs\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n3/4 C veggie add ins (1/2 C frozen chopped kale, 1/4 C diced onion)\n\n1 Tbsp seasonings (1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp curry, 1/4 tsp cumin & nutmeg)\n\nFor cooking:\n\n1/4 C BBQ sauce + up to 1/4 C water\n\nMix ingredients together well & form into meatballs of about 25g each. Place in an oven-safe dish and coat with thinned BBQ sauce. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes at 350F.\n\nMeatloaf sandwich alteration: Spread mixture in a 1/2\" layer on a greased or lined baking sheet. Coat with straight BBQ sauce, and bake at 350F for 15 minutes. Cut into squares to fit your preferred bread.\n\nUsing the meatloaf alteration, and replacing the meat with 1/3 batch of vegetarian braised mince, we had hot meatloaf sandwiches the night I made it, using toasted brown bread and topping with some cheese.\n\nA couple of days pass, and now I want to use up the remaining 'meatloaf'. There are four slices. We could have sandwiches again, but we eat plenty of sandwiches. I have no potatoes or vegetables to make a 'meat and potatoes' plate. So I do my usual fallback: pizza.\n\nI make my own crust, but this could just as easily be done with a premade crust or dough from the store. Then I topped it with some sauce (plain canned), the 'meatloaf' that I'd cut into smaller pieces, and some shredded mozzarella.

{"title": "Ramen noodle stir fry", "selftext": "Ramen noodle stir fry is a cheap- high yielding meal you can cater to fit your personal preferences. My mom got the recipe off a lunchtime episode of Mr. Food back in the 90\u2019s. I cook up 1 lb of ground pork in sesame oil and light soy sauce in a large skillet (I\u2019m sure a wok would be preferable but I use what I have). Prior to cooking the pork I chopped up a bunch of vegetables (orange and red bell pepper, calabacitas, broccoli, cauliflower, and celery). Chop up half a head of green cabbage. You can also use a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables and it\u2019s still just as good. In addition I always like to add the little canned baby corn and water chestnuts. I usually buy a stir fry sauce I like because I don\u2019t have the correct ingredients to make my own sauce. Then you need a couple packages of ramen noodles- you won\u2019t use the seasoning packets so any brand/flavor will work. Add the vegetables (besides the cabbage, squash and the corn and the water chestnuts) to the undrained pork. Season with more sesame oil and soy sauce. I cooked the vegetables between 8-10 mins (with the lid on- stirring frequently) then added in the cabbage and stir well. Cook (again with the lid on) until the cabbage has reduced by half and then add in the rest of the vegetables. I also added in about 1 1/2 Tbsps of jarlic (I don\u2019t like chopping garlic and don\u2019t have a press so I use the jarred stuff). Cook until the squash are nearly soft. Add in (2-3 packages) of crushed ramen noodles, and then either add about 3/4 cup of water (I used some extra reduced sodium chicken broth I had in the fridge) to start. Put the lid on and stir about every 2 mins, adding more liquid as needed until the noodles are cooked. Once everything is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed add your sauce, and cook a few more minutes until everything is coated and heated through. \n\nThis makes a HUGE amount of food (taking shortcuts like using frozen vegetables/ using the jarred sauce) will cut your time down.

Marinade the chicken pieces with some soy, a tiny bit of sugar, corn starch and oyster sauce if you have it. \n2. In a pan, cook the chicken pieces until cook through \nAnd set aside .\n3. In the same pan, warm up the cream style corn on medium low slightly bubbly, return the cooked chicken into the pan to coat with the corn sauce. You can beat an egg and slowly add to the dish ( like in egg drop soup) if you like. \n4. Serve over rice. \n\nYou can make this in a big batch and it\u2019s a great lunch thing and easy to heat up. If you want some veg, add frozen pea/carrot mix and it\u2019s totally fine. Pretty economical meal esp when you can score the meat on sale.\n\nIdea 2: ground pork and tofu\nI buy a lot of firm tofu ($1.79/per) and got some ground pork on sale from 99 ranch ($1.79/lb). \n\nRecipe:\n1. Cut firm tofu into cubes.\n2. Marinade pork with water, soy, sugar, white pepper, Chinese wine, oyster sauce ( you don\u2019t need to add all if you don\u2019t have them) for about 15 min.\n3. Pan sear the tofu until somewhat golden on all sides. Set aside.\n4. Portion out the pork( I only used about 1/3lb cause I want to save the pork for something else). \n5. Cook the ground pork in a pan until cook through , add a bit of garlic \n6. Make a sauce with oyster sauce, soy, sugar ,water and corn starch. \n7. Add cooked tofu into the pan and add the sauce mixture. Let simmer on low and stir occasionally until the sauce thicken to your liking.\n8. Serve over rice. \n\nSo I can\u2019t account for the condiments cause I have them on hand constantly, but the tofu and pork dish legit costed $3 for the protein and it\u2019d be enough for 3 ( depends on serving size).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1i1wiod/another_simple_ideas/", "created_utc": 1736944880.0, "score": 5, "author": "genegenet", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1i1wiod/another_simple_ideas/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I think we're going to be eating more pork; I buy the whole loin and cut it into pork chops to freeze. Chicken is our main animal protein and I watch the prices like a hawk; we currently have 42 chicken breasts in our freezer purchased at 1.77 and 1.88/lb. \n\nIt took me a while to talk my wife into a chest freezer. It paid for itself in a year due to savings of buying in bulk. Organization takes some work. Inventory takes some work. Well worth it.

All but my first one which admittedly was overdone and dry have been moist tender  birds with beautiful browned skin and a pleasure to carve. This includes 6 wild turkeys I personally harvested. Most all the birds averaged more than 20 lbs in dry weight. This week's bird weighed 19.66 lbs.\n\nI treated this bird the same as I have done all the others. It was frozen so took 4 days in fridge to defrost it. Took it out Thursday morning and washed the bird off inside and out.\n\nPatted it dry then wiped a bit of olive oil and butter mix on the skin and applied simple salt and pepper seasoning. Seasoned the inside similarly.\n\nSet it in a roasting pan on a rack and added a butter and broth mixture to the bottom to baste it with and to mix with drippings for gravy.\n\nRoasted as usual being careful not to dry it out basting it regularly. It was done and at temperature 15 minutes earlier than anticipated removed from oven and placed on a platter and wrapped it in a tent of foil for it to finish and to let the meat rest.\n\nNow all of my turkeys have been delicious and moist and tender and easy to carve. \n\nNotice the picture above, that was the brand and type used this week.\n\nFirst the bird was like carving styrofoam board. That dry and tough.  The only moisture found in meat on this bird was in what was in contact with drippings and it was tough also.\n\nMy question is this, is there some special way you should roast an \"Organic\" turkey. \n\nI ask as I am worried I might have done something wrong here but reviewing my process In did not deviate from what I have done in the 35 birds previous to this.  The meat was dry and tough like the slabs of jerky you buy at the gas station. Except the jerky was chewable.\n\nThe meat from this turkey is so tough I can not use it for sandwiches. The white meat is like stringy cardboard and the dark meat is worse.\n\nAnyone with experience with this brand and type of turkey please chime in on your experience with it and any ideas.\n\nI appreciate it.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/pfunh36wed4e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1733117081.0, "score": 198, "author": "Material_Disaster638", "num_comments": 79, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1h4nqhi/the_worst_turkey_i_ever_roasted_out_of_36_years/", "html_title": ""}

It's amazing.) \n0.5 teaspoons of garlic granules (not powder) \n\n\nGive the chicken a pat down with kitchen paper to make sure it's dry. Give it a spray or rub on some oil just lightly. \nSeason both sides of the chicken and (in my case using gloves) rub the dry rub all over. \n\n\nCover it up on a plate and put in the fridge. Ideally for 2+ hours but it's not one to leave overnight so maybe make in the morning and cook after work? It works too if you only have an hour. 30 minutes is the shortest time I've let it marinate.. It was still good. \n\n\nAnyway. Get a pan onto medium hot (not searing), a few sprays of oil or a small amount if your not spraying. I put both large breasts into the pan and just leave them alone. Don't move them, poke or prod. Give them 4-6 minutes to get some color and they will easily move when you shake the pan. \n\nTurn them over for another 4-8 minutes (the pan has cooled by now and it needs longer to brown the second side) and be ready with some boiling water. \n\nAs the chicken was seasoned with veg stock there was no need to use a stock to poach the chicken. \n\nOnce the chicken is browned on both sides and there is some yummy seared goodness on the bottom of the pan pour in the boiling water. It's going to bubble, steam and then you'll notice all the caramelised goodness lift off the pan. \n\nNext part is easy. Just use a wooden spoon or whatever you have to scrape up all the browned bits of flavor. (wooden or silicon won't sctrach your pan) \n\nPop the lid on and leave it for 12 minutes.. Yes you have to use a timer, I do at least or I forget what I was doing. ADHD brain is a hazard, ha. \n\nOnce it's done I check to make sure the thickest part has got to 75c (Sorry don't know that in f) and put them into a air tight container to rest. \n\nIf you are using the chicken for a meal immediately then let them rest for Atleast 10 minutes. \n\nI left mine for an hour then took two forks to them for shredding. \n\n\nI have turned \u00a32 worth of chicken into four individual pies (obviously extras will be needed), Atleast the three sandwiches I've made and enough to give my dog a little treat. \n\n\n(I did try to make a pie but wasted some chicken as I had a temor and spilt sugar into the pan, ha!) \n\nI'll post how the pies comes out tomorrow.

I was attempting to make budget meals and get back into couponing again this last January, but most of the coupon site I used weren\u2019t as good. So I found out about these receipt scanning apps. I tried out a lot of them (and like walking apps for cash too) But I was looking for free food or the equivalent of cash back for my purchases. Any little bit helped at the time so I was downloading all of them but now that time has passed I have weeded out the bad ones and the good ones are what is left.

The cash out is every 3 months and they just drop the full amount it in your account on 2/15, 5/15, 8/15, 11/15.\n\nHoney - This app I've had since 2015. Originally It was just on my PC but I use it to find promo codes for everything. It also has cash back for quite a few places. I couldn't tell you how much I've made honestly Since January of this year I've made $38.40 Cashback and countless promo codes lol\n\nFrisbee - 1/13/24 $32.17 I do like receipt scanning apps some are a little slow to pay out, most of them give you more payouts the longer you use. This ones the slowest but still simple with no ads and the cashout works.\n\nIbotta - 6/14/24 $9.75( pqcbrsy ) This one is a cashback app. Look up the item on the app, select the cashback for the items available. Then just scan your receipts Or sometimes the item. I had this one in my extreme couponing era. It's pretty good.\n\nReceipt Hog - 1/12/24 $26.55 ( gak28203 ) Its acute app Easy to use\u00a0 It's not the biggest payout but if Im snapping pics For other receipt apps might as well for this legit one too well worth it. The payouts work\n\nReceipt Jar - 1/12/24 $37.18 ( HOPEPJ128 )This one gives you more the longer you're a member but for a lot of the Ereceipts you need to refresh the Connection once a week or so. Just do it when you snap pics of your paper receipts though and it downloads them with the correct points.\n\nCoinout - 6/14/24 $ 20.75 Very Quick money took me less than a month to reach their \"Diamond level\u201d which just means a higher payout for each receipt and bigger rewards. I haven't had it as long as the others but it's up there in my Favorites. It's also got as low as $3 payouts\n\nNCP - 8/30/24 $ 25.35 I had applied to be on this one at sometime this year and got on a waitlist. I heard about the National Consumer Panel in my couponing days but never applied. I do like this one. It's not scanning receipts though. It's scanning barcodes and entering amounts. I will say it does take a little longer for Big shopping trip but it's kinda fun to me. So to each their own\n\nFetch - 4/13/24 $109.70 ( TP41AA ) Wow love this app. Just try it for real. They give big bonuses for a lot of stuff!  They have cash back for items. It has a Fun interface. This one I wish I had found sooner! Love this App 5 stars.

{"title": "Help with meal inspiration please? High protein", "selftext": "I intend to try jamming together lunch and dinner to one meal with about 40g protein. The idea is to do an intermittent fasting regime based on eating early in the day so I get better utilization of the energy according to the circadian rythm. It\u00b4s also strategic because the few times I do overeat it\u00b4s always in the evenings and I want to lose a bit of weight.  \nBut I am trying to stick to a tight budget and an issue is that I only have 30 minutes lunch and am not a 'volume eater', my gut likes 'normal' or 'small but satiating' better. But yeah, I aim to try it anyway. Thought it could be good to know so people don\u00b4t think that I consider an almost OMAD-supersize meal good, quite the opposite or it would have been easier to load up on protein. My food budget for the whole weeks lunches is 15$.\n\nIdeally, I would be able to meal prep the weeks 5 lunches at once, but have some 'extras' ready to make the dish a lil bit different towards the end of the week. Like a different sauce or side veggie/carb or something.  \nI aim to cook gluten free and mixed vegetarian/animal based foods because my gut can\u00b4t deal with enough beans and such at once but only meat would become bad quality or expensive on my budget. Also good amounts of fibers, complex carbs, good savoury taste (so I do spend some on seasonings/sauces and sometimes find it worth to add a lil bit extra to the budget if it\u00b4s for a nice seasoning). I have a Cosori Dual Blaze Airfryer and a Crockpot express (so pressure cooking + slow cooking) and I love to use them when possible.\n\nSo far I have come up with this meal from mostly foods I already have got at home;\n\nChicken inner fil\u00e9s (frozen 700g, 140g protein), with 5 dl of red lentils (dry, 40g of protein) that I mash so they are sort of disguised in the dish, figured it would be easier to eat in one sitting, served with oat rice the first 2-3 days (so another 4g protein/day from the rice on those days)  and then I come up with something else as a side such as brussel sprouts/zoodles. The idea is that it\u00b4s gonna be a pot with coconut milk, spices, onion, some veggies such as bell peppers and carrots. Divided into 5 portions, in case that was not clear.\n\nSome other foods I already have that I would love to come up with recipes for;  \n\\- Small white beans  \n\\- Yellow peas  \n\\- Sausages (it\u00b4s just 10g protein/100g sausage, swedish 'Falukorv', pretty neutral taste)  \n\\- Black beans (was thinking about trying them as a base for gluten free pie crust)\n\nSo yeah, for a total of at least close to 200g protein and 15$ for 5 portions, gluten free, healthy, not too heavy to eat for a small eater in less than 30 min and best case scenario ideas for variation towards the end of the week. Thank you in advance for any input! (:\n\n\n\n\\-UPDATE-   \nI got a lot of inspiration from just the few current posts in combo with the list of ingredients that I have. It\u00b4s so valuable to hear how other people are thinking! Currently, I actually think I have roughly enough for the next 4 weeks worth of lunch boxes. \n\n1. The meal I wrote in the initial post (chicken stew with lentils, coconut milk, oat rice etc)  \ncost: about 7$ mainly for veggiesand coconut milk + food I already have  /7$\n\n2. Oven sausage with 'regular' household cheese, custard, tomato puree, fried eggs, boiled potatoes, baked cabbage or such (cheap veggie).   \nI would buy the cheese at campaign price, 1,1kg for 10,50$, (I will have 800g left), eggs at special price 5,65$ for 30 and 25 eggs left for later/breakfast, cabbage at special price for 1$ per kilo, so likely 1,5kg/1,50$ and half of it left. I have the rest already, got some really cheap sausage that I put in the freezer last week (800g for 2$). /17.65$\n\n3. Pie with crust made of white beans, tuna filling (canned). There are actually a lot of fancy ingredients I need such as sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, corn, canned tuna, (eggs but I would have gotten them already), it\u00b4s supposed to be creme fraiche but I would sub it for cottage cheese, I already got beans and other but I would buy tuna 3,20$, sundried tomatoes 1,90$, feta cheese 1,90$, canned corn 1,30$, cottage cheese 2,70$  /11$ \n\n4. Soup made with a big bunch of white beans and tomato sauce. I already have beans and crushed tomatoes. I\u00b4d be using leftovers of the cottage cheese above. I\u00b4d make fry bread out of oat meal flour and psyllium husk which I have got already. I\u00b4d make scrambled eggs on 8 eggs which I have gotten already above.  I\u00b4d use a semi-fancy sausage on campaign price, cognacsmedwurst 2,60$ for 350g for some additional foodiness and flavor (I\u00b4d be using about half of it), + leafy green salad 1,60$  / 4:20$\n\nSo sure I already had a bunch of the ingredients since last month but \\~33$ for 4 weeks seems promising. It\u00b4s not the entire months food budget, but not far from it actually... Pretty cool! \n\nThank you for the inspo!

I had alot of left overs, as intended and had a plan. I did forget to post how it looked served up for the first meal so picture two was the first two meals which where way to much for each of us. \n\nSo onto the left overs! I heated the stew back up the next day and to make sure it was a one container frozen meal I added some frozen peas, string beans and a can of cannelloni beans. It was what I had in the freezer and cupboard that my mum can eat, having oral cancer. You can add whatever you have or enjoy. \n\nI went to the shop and got some potatoes and onions as again I had run out. \n\nAs mash doesn't really freeze well (for me) I sliced the potatoes into thinish slices and dumped them into cold water. Put the hob on low and braught to a low boil. You can salt the water (I prefer to) but I need to keep salt down for mum. \n\nOnce the water is gently boiling I gave it a few minutes and then drained them whilst running a cold tap to stop them cooking more. I wanted them firm but par boiled enough they won't be ruined with freezing. \n\nOnce cold I cut the slices in half and layered onto the stew. I almost ran out but managed to get a single decent layer. \n\nAs I had used the same herbs in the stew I decided to grab the last of my garden herbs which admittedly aren't great right now but free. Gave them a chop along with the onion into small peices. \n\nSprinkled on a bit of the fresh thyme and rosemary on each container, shared out the red onion between each and then some parsley. \n\nBasically done. I labeled the lids so mum knows what she's getting out of the freezer. \n\nAll she has to do is take them out of the freezer the day before, put them in he ovan at 180c for 20 minutes with the lid on, then 20-30 minutes with the lid off. You *can* cook from frozen but i prefer to defrost in the fridge the day before. Mum tends to just take them out of the freezer and straight into cooking. As the stew was cooked long and slow, the meat doesn't need softening however it does need to be at a decent temperature.. I'm over cautious. \n\nI intended these frozen meals to be stand alone dishes, with he amount of meat, veg and potatoe but they can also be halfed when cooked and shared between two with sides. \n\nI hope you're having a good day! \n\nAs a point of reference the entire 8+ dishes came to under \u00a31.50 each if eaten as is. With the amount of stock, meat, bone broth, veg and the cheeky glass of red wine, I don't think that's too bad. It's cheaper than a micro meal and alot healthier, in my opinion of course. \n\n(apologies for spelling and gammer, English *is* my first language but dyslexia and adhd..)

Huzzah. \n\nThe one thing you should know is I like to cook 'on the cheap' but since I'm cooking for my mum with cancer it has to be somewhat healthy. So here is how I made some beef stock that's going to go into a healthy, rich beef stew using shin meat as it was the cheapest cut of meat! \n\nThe pictures tell you pretty much everything I did. I understand things better in pictures. \n\nThe beef bones are from morrisons and surprisingly a good amount of meat for making stock. \u00a35 in total, not too bad. \n\nGave them a good bit of seasoning with what I  had in the cupboard so: 5 grinds of salt, about 10 grinds of the mixed pepper (use any you have), 1/4 teaspoon of dried rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon of dry thyme. I gave them a spritz of oil too before mixing it all together. \n\nThe veg is self explanatory but there were 3 gloves of garlic for good measure.\n\nThen into the combi ovan at 190c for 30 minutes, turn everything over and back on for another 20. \n\nI used about 200ml of boiling water from the kettle to deglaze the ovan tray, all the best bits   got scraped and made a very thick and oily mess! Sounds gross but it's amazingly tasty. \n\nI put it all into a pan with a tiny peice of cinnamon (2cm long), one half of a star anise, some fresh rosemary, and parsley from the garden. \n\nThen the only thing to do was add as much cold water as needed to cover, put the pan over the small hob burner on low and leave it alone!

Knead the dough 100 times or for 5-10 minutes. You can add flour if the dough is too sticky but with caution.\n7. Let rest for 30 minutes (dumplings) or 1 hour (Bao). Difference is that yeast in Bao requires more time to activate.\n8. Quickly knead dough after resting a bit, then split into 8 smaller doughs (1 cup = 4 Bao or large dumplings). \n9. Roll out into circular wrappers, using flour to dust the roller and table to prevent sticking.\n10. With your finger tips, wet your tips and dab the small amount of water on the edge of the flatter dough wrapper. This is to help it stick together when wrapping the dough to the final form.\n11. Put in filling and wrap dough (video tutorial online for various versions of wrap are available).\n12.

Then onto the chicken! \n\nI have some chicken breasts frozen individually so I plucked one out and defrosted it in the microwave (I didn't have time/foreplanning to let it defrost overnight) whilst chopping the veg. \n\nI cut it into very thin strips, gave it a spritz of oil and sprinkled 1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder, 1 teaspoon of old bay seasoning and a good 'eye balling it' 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Then just gave it a good mixing on the chopping board, making sure everything is mixed well. \nI did put some cling film over it while it was waiting to be cooked, but the vegetables need to cook first! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\nI oiled up the pan that was on low and threw everything but the mushrooms and garlic in.

Mushrooms seem to suck up the butter while they get rid of their moisture, so I let the whole lot cook for a while. \n\nInto a bowl once the mushrooms had little crispy bits and were not rubbery. \n\nChicken bits into the pan next in batches, when slightly browned they go into the bowl with the veg. Once the last batch of chicken is cooked I turned the hob onto max for a minute sor it was very hot the added 250ml of chicken stock made from asda/Walmart cheap chicken cubes.

It made at a localish bakers, tastes and has the mouthfeel of home made bread and normally costs \u00a33 a bag. Bargain. \n\nSliced them open and gave them a little rub of butter to get them going.

I have 3 various canned beans and a can of corn(was thinking chili?), and a 2lb bag of pinto beans (never cooked dried beans before??) I have a 10lb bag of small sweet potatoes and a 5lb bag of small gala apples. I have huge bags of both walnuts, almonds, and cranberries. (I grabbed a $5 rotisserie chicken from Walmart to make walnut cranberry salad for lunch for the week, but not sure what else to make, maybe muffins or in the oatmeal they gave???) I got chicken breast which I plan to put in the crockpot with some ingredients I already had, I got ground beef, which I plan to use with the Spaghetti sauce and noodles they gave me. I got 3 zucchini, 3 tomatoes, and 2 bell peppers. I also got a few other odds and ends but those are the main things I need meal ideas for! I LOVE heavily seasoned recipes, and am a pretty equal opportunist when it comes to food! I could potentially get a few small things from Walmart to make it a full meal, but unfortunately no significant food shopping will be happening anytime soon.

{"title": "I'm not great at plating or taking pictures but this meal was free, tasty and leftovers for a couple of days. ", "selftext": "Sausage in a very rich gravy, cheese and potatoe pie with some veg. (Not sure if a cheese pie is common, it's just mash with cheese then ovan baked.. Tomatoes preferred) \n\nMy neighbour is very elderly and needed some help with her bins and some cleaning. \n\nShe was trying to give me money but I didn't take it, she's definitely not short on money but I couldn't take cash for helping. Instead she offered to make me dinner. As she struggles to see I offered to cook and the food would be more than enough payment. \n\nSo onto the recipes. Please keep in mind I'm happy to chat and relax while food is on the go, so 1 hour cooking just onions is no hassle for me. My neighbour just lives a chin wag so she was happy while I did my thing. Q\n\n\nI used what she had in the house which is more than what I normally have, so it was fun and a bit luxurious for me. \n\nSliced 1 very large mild yellow onion, 4 white cooking onions, 3 red onions. \n\nAfter my eyes stopped watering, I melted about two tablespoons of butter in some olive oil. In went 1 bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon of dry rosemary and 1 teaspoon of dry thyme. I gave it a good 5 minutes to melt and get the herbs fragrant. I didn't have fresh. \n\nThen it's just a case of throw in all the onions. Mix so everything is coated in herby oil and put the hob on its lowest setting. Gently cook the onions for much longer than you think is needed, then cook for longer. That huge amount of onions cooked down so it didn't cover the pan. Lots of sweet, charred and jammy onion goodness. \n\nWhilst that was all happening on it own, with the occasional stir, I peeled and boiled the potatos she had in her cupboard. Gave them a good mashing, added some cheddar cheese and butter. She came in and said mash always needs mustard... She put a hefty pinch (or three) of Coleman mustard powder in, and I'm guessing 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper, and the same with black pepper. \n\nSo after a break to stir the onions again I put half the mash into a foil lined tray, put a sliced up ball of asdas cheapest mozzarella on too., some Asda cheapest mixed herbs and covered it with the rest of the mash. \nOn top I put one sliced tomatoe, more mixed herbs then some grated cheese. \n\n\nNow the cheese and potato pie is ready for the ovan, back to the onions. \n\nIn went a tablespoon of plain flour whilst stirring then gave it a few minutes to cook. \n\nNow that the onions where browned, and starting to get jammy I cheekily put in a glass of her red wine. I don't like wine but she does, so seemed to be a decent option. It was maybe 200mls, I guess. I used a beef stock cube to make 500mls of stock, added it while stirring.\n\nWhile that pan was gently bubbling away I peeled and cut some carrots to boil. Put some frozen beans and sweetcorn into a pan, and remembered I hadn't put the sausages on to cook. \n\nPopped them into the air fryer, 200 for 18 minutes. Once done I put them into the onion gravy mostly to stay warm while I put the cheese and potatoe pie in the ovan for 25 minutes on 230c. \n\nI did taste test the sausage and onion, added 1 teaspoon tomatoe puree, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of the vinegar she had and a teaspoon of marmite! \n\nAll in all it's a very rich, warming and filling dish made for my neighbor and I put the leftovers into tubs so she has food for a few days. \n\nI just wish I knew how to plate food well and how to take pictures. Oh well, free food for helping someone, huzzah! \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fs9xea", "created_utc": 1727631423.0, "score": 172, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1fs9xea/im_not_great_at_plating_or_taking_pictures_but/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Various spices. \n\n\nI'm currently caring for my mum and due to tongue cancer and related issues she can't eat anything 'spicy' (that means salty, acidic, chilli pepper heat, black or white pepper and no garlic...) \n\n\nSo into the pan went 1 red onion in a little oil for 20 minutes, stir when it starts to catch.. Basically when it starts to smell good. \n\nI take the onions out of the pan when using thighs as they take a good long cook to be tasty and tender enough. \nSo into the pan with the meat in batches until sealed, I'm don't want it cooked at this point.

Idk how much I just eyeball it so there's a layer the skin side of the salmon can rest on it. \n\n3. Cover the top with the cure and you'll be making lox. If you take the extra step and season it, you'll have lax, I think, idk, I'm not any of the races that make these things so that's my understanding. You can add gin, ground pepper, fresh or dried dill. Or not, the important part is the to cover the flesh side of the salmon with the sugar and salt so it covers the entire flesh side and remains visible. Whenever you can't see salt and sugar on the fish then you need to add more. I don't have exact portion because I eyeballed it. \n\n4. Wrap it up, poke corners in the Saran wrap packet so liquid can leak out. I used the Tupperware in the picture because the center is warped and raised up higher than the sides so the liquid can pool along the edges. I take one of those cheap disposable plastic water bottles with the tiny caps and I drink half of it and then take the air out and molded the bottle to the shape of the fish and then put the lid on with rubber bands. This way there is pressure on the fish. I guess to remove more liquid? I'm not sure, the recipes used things like food cans and wine bottles but I don't think that's practical. Anyways fish packet, water bottle, Tupperware lid, another water bottle on top of the Tupperwareid and some rubber bands to keep it together and to add more pressure and put it in the fridge. \n\n5. I drained it and checked on it every 12 hours. One recipe said 36 hours for medium cure and I think that's the sweet spot. After 24 hours it definitely was cured but not quite enough for me, still had raw texture. If you can't see any salt/sugar on the fish then you need to add more to keep curing it. I dumped out a fair amount of liquid at first and it slowed down each time I checked the fish (once every 12 hours). \n\n6. I filet'ed the meat off the skin and then charred the skin in a toaster oven. I cut up the charred skin to make into crumble to add smokey flavor to the final product without actually have to smoke anything. \n\n7.

{"title": "Budget tips", "selftext": "Please note that I am in the US and I am giving advice from my knowledge of shopping here. I apologize if this isn't wanted. I wish to help others so you can take or leave it. I wouldn't say I am the best at this but I have stretched our food out with my family of weeks without going to the store aside from the occasional milk or sandwich bread. \n\nThese items I like keeping in stock or on hand: Tomato sauce, dried noodles, dried rice, caned cream soup (chicken, potato, mushroom), shredded or block cheese (if I'm desperate I shred my own cheese), tortillas, eggs, bread, broth powder (I have a large container from a local Asian market), canned veggies, boxed stuffing (I make casseroles or crab/ salmon cakes with this), boxed pancake mix (freeze your extra waffles or pancakes), boxed potato flakes (great for thickening soups), curry/ white/ and brown cubes (sure you can make your own curry sauce but the cubes I found at the Asian market are so simple. White/ brown are stew cubes), tortillas, butter, gravy (I buy the gravy packets), bread flour (sometimes I make my own bread as a side with meals\n(Leftover bread is either made into stuffing or chopped into cubes seasoned, baked into croutons and frozen). Many of these I buy on sale. \n\nPrepping can take up a chunk of time but will help in the long term when you are short on time. I try to buy meats on sale. Buy family packs, divide, bag and freeze. Buying whole turkey or chicken when it goes on sale helps. Debone and freeze parts of it for later. Raw hamburg doesnt seem to freeze as well for me so I either make patties, or meatballs and freeze. \n\nVeggies I buy in bulk and freeze. Carrots or celery can be shredded and frozen, added to any dish. Onions or mushrooms can be chopped and frozen. Both lasted me for several months and were only $3-4 for bag. Peppers can be chopped (or cored if you make stuffed peppers). Corn (when in season) can be cut off husk and frozen for meals.You can even freeze bagged spinach if you use it for pasta or soup. Potatoes are different. I make mashed or twice baked and freeze them. Fruits (berries or apples), I buy in season and freeze. Sealed shredded or block cheese and lunch meat can also be frozen. So can sandwich bread, bagels, muffins.\n\nLast tip is shopping. Early morning shopping is great for deals. Eat before you go, look at sales, compare prices. Sit down, make stock of what you have. Try to shop if you are in that area. Budget stores can be great for basics. Make a list and price point. If I'm really in a crunch, I take a calculator so I know I don't go over board. Leave room for taxes if you have them. Also take a look at marked down items and use apps if you can.\n\nLastly, if you cook for yourself or make a large batch of something that you know you can't finish, freeze it. Got that left over bacon that you wont use? Freeze it. Don't force yourself to eat the same thing if you can. Just put it away for another day. Don't throw away money. I hope this helps someone.

{"title": "Dhal: food of the poor or food of the gods?", "selftext": "You cannot get a more budget food than dhal and rice and I would choose it over some really fancy curry a lot of the time.\n\nDahl is so easy and tasty that you will be amazed you have managed to live your life without it. I was!\n\nIn it's simplest form it's just 1 cup dried split lentils to 2.5 or 3 cups water or stock (just a stock cube in hot water; again optional as lentils have nice flavor already).\n\nRed lentils and mung dhal have different flavor, and it's good to try all kinds of dhal. Chickpea is one of my faves but you have to cook it much longer if you want it less chunky. \n\nI forgot to state how important it is to rinse the lentils. Some don't do this, but I was taught to do it till the water runs clear.\n\nYou can cheat that by boiling them for a minute or two, then rinsing, then putting back on with fresh water too.\n\nIf you are using green lentils make sure you pick through them when you are rinsing, as very occassionally there will be a very hard lentil like a stone in there, and you don't want to bite that when you're eating!\n\nNot sure what those are, but I've found a few at times, and they are rock hard. They sink to the bottom of the rinsing bowl and tend to be darker than any other lentils.\n\nAn onion is standard at least in Western dhal versions, and shouldn't really be skipped, but if you don't have one...yeah well. Ideally a chopped onion in there.\n\nYou can also grate in a carrot, or stick in big chunks of it if you like to mix up the texture. Zucchini chunks? Yeah! Why not. Bell peppers? Why not!? Whatever you have.\n\nAdd garam masala (mixed spice) right at the start and cook for 15-30 mins, depending on how hot your stove is and how you like the texture. Some like it smoother, and some like it so you can still see lentil shapes. Your choice. Try both. On a reheat you will get the chance to cook it down more.\n\nThis is also the point to add a chopped fresh chilli, or some chill powder or flakes if you want any heat in it; this is entirely optional.\n\nOnce the water has mostly absorbed you will have to stir it quite frequently and turn the heat right down.\n\nI usually like dhal pretty thick, but your preference might differ.\n\nBefore taking it off the heat, you can stir in a bit more garam masala or spices of choice to your personal tastes and to freshen the spice of the dish.\n\nChillis, chilli powder or curry powder is entirely optional if you don't like hot spice, but I'd recommend some.\n\nServe with long grain rice and you have a tasty filling meal in half an hour.\n\nI think you will be absolutely shocked by how good dhal is considering what it is made of.\n\nI would leave it as simple as that since you are on a budget, but if you can splash out a bit for more luxury, you can add a knob of butter, splash of milk or cream or yogurt or (for pure decadance) coconut milk, all of which can be stirred in right at the end when it's cooling.\n\nGaram masala is the cheap spice option, but you can add ground ginger, ground coriander, ground cumin and a pinch of turmeric (also fenugreek is used to sub for onion if you are following an ayurvedic diet) if you have those things handy and want to try a slightly different flavor profile.\n\nRoasting the seeds yourself and grinding them...yeah ok, it's budget food.

{"title": "Let's talk about milk", "selftext": "Let's talk about some tips for saving money on milk.  I have some tips to share, and I hope I'll learn some new ones:\n\nBuy half and half instead of milk.  It's fairly inexpensive, it keeps in the fridge much longer than milk, and you can add water to it to make it more like milk.  Really great when you usually only need milk on hand to cook with and therefore go through it very slowly.  The upside is that you have cream on hand to make fabulous sauces and other recipes where cream works better than milk.\n\nFreeze milk you might not use in time.  You can use ice cube trays, though I use my silicone egg bites mold to freeze a large cube of it that's roughly a quarter cup of milk.  Once frozen, I put them all in a labeled bag.  I take out however many needed for a recipe, put them in a glass bowl, and micro them for 30 seconds at a time until melted (or put them in the fridge to thaw the night before, but I never remember).\n\nBuy powdered milk.  When I used to only very occasionally use milk to cook with, I sometimes bought powdered milk to have the ability to have milk on hand at all times without waste.  It's not cheap to buy a box, but it goes a long way and keeps a long time.  It's also good for those that have limited or no options for keeping food cold or for storing frozen extra milk.\n\nIf choosing between types of milk, consider that you can often buy whole milk for the same price as skim.

Or sautee it with the oil depending on what you've got). I chucked in some frozen spinach (seriously, don't sleep on frozen veggies!!) along with onion powder, cayenne, paprika, freeze dried chives, and the obligatory salt and pepper. Really any spice would be good here.\n\nI let that bad boy simmer for a bit, and then I cracked in two eggs.

Two packages of chicken, 4 pkgs of bacon, a pkg of ground turkey, four boxes of rotini noodles, three packages of spaghetti noodles, about six cans of diced tomatoes, 4 cans of chickpeas, a couple cans of black beans, a couple cans of corn, a can of peas, a couple cans of cream mushroom soup, 1lb of rice, 2lbs of flour, a giant box of jiffy corn bread mix, and two boxes of Ragu double cheddar sauce, 2 fresh cucumbers and 2 green peppers, a 3lb block of cheddar cheese, salsa, cottage cheese, Italian dressing, ranch dressing and 3 dozen eggs.

There is no cure for it available right now unfortunately. Because it's not related to function of The thyroid, there is no medication and surgery won't help. So even if this is caused by it, I just need to adjust my eating to it at The moment, until maybe someday there will be treatment to it available for me.\n\nHello everyone, I have been having some problems with finances for a while now. I'm a student and I had to move in a different apartment two years ago. Broke up with abusive boyfriend etc. My rent is more expensive than before, I can't really do anything else atm than to eat cheaper, and try to get my school done.\n\nFor The context I'm about 5'3 tall and weight about 120 lbs. Woman, early 20's. When I see people my age and size eating, I'm always wondering how are they surviving. I'm not hating on them, I have a really hard time eating enough to not be tired all The time and to not lose weight.\n\nI eat smaller breakfast, huge lunch at school (full plate, full salad plate, two breads and a dessert). After I come home from school, I'm so hungry that I need to eat some snacks before dinner. Usually bread or a microwave pizza, because I need it immediately, and they are very cheap.\n\nThen a huge dinner. I once ate 400g ground beef with gravy and pasta, and I was full after that.\n\nAnd something in The evening. Maybe bread again with some yougurt.\n\nI can't understand this. About 6 months ago out of curiosity I tried to count my calories to stay on The maintenance (2000 kcl), but not overeat. I was hoping I would save some money that way, because I thought I was overreacting. I was dizzy all The time, lost 14 lbs weight... Didn't go well.\n\nI'd really like some advice on meals that are _filling_, but cheap. Actually as cheap as possible. Also if someone here knows more about metabolism and usage of energy in The human body... Is this even possible? I don't exercise at all, because I have no money to eat even more.

Make the Rice Cakes (Saves you $5+ compared to store-bought!)\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine:\n   - 1 cup glutinous rice flour\n   - 2 pinches of salt\n   - Gradually pour in 1/2 cup hot water, stirring as you go.\n2. Mix into a soft dough.\n3. Lightly oil your hands and roll the dough into small logs, about finger-thick and 2-3 inches long.\n4. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the shaped tteok.\n5. Cook until they float to the top.\n6. Once floating, remove them and immediately place in a bowl of cold water.\n7. After a brief soak, drain and transfer to an empty bowl. Set aside.\n\n2. Cook the Sausages\n- Heat a pan over medium heat and saut\u00e9 the sliced sausages for about 3-4 minutes until browned. Remove and set aside.\n\n3. Prepare the Creamy Sauce\nIn the same pan:\n1. Add butter and let it melt.\n2. Stir in minced garlic and gochujang, saut\u00e9 for 30 seconds until fragrant.\n3. Pour in milk, water, soy sauce, sugar, and ONE Indomie seasoning packet.\n4. Mix until everything is dissolved into a smooth sauce. Bring to a gentle simmer.\n\n4. Assemble the Dish\n1. Add the prepared rice cakes and simmer for 3-5 minutes until soft and chewy.\n2. Add back the cooked sausage and toss to coat.\n3. Add the cooked Indomie noodles and simmer for 2-3 minutes, until sauce thickens.\n4. If using, stir in shredded cheese for a richer, creamier texture.\n\n5. Finishing Touches\n- Add the boiled egg, halved or whole.\n- Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds if you like.\n\nMoney-Saving Tips:\n- Make double batch of rice cakes and freeze extras for next time\n- Use any cheap protein - hot dogs, tofu, or leftover chicken all work!\n- Milk about to expire? Perfect time to make this!\n- One jar of gochujang makes dozens of meals - best bang for your buck\n- Skip the cheese if you're really pinching pennies\n\nTotal cost: Under $3 per serving with homemade rice cakes vs. $12+ at Korean restaurants!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/f5zb8u8ez5xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745666715.0, "score": 73, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1k8aqm6/budgetfriendly_homemade_creamy_rabokki_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

Just made these mini chocolate cinnamon rolls in my air fryer for the first time and had to share this budget win. They taste like coffee shop treats at a fraction of the cost!\n\nCost breakdown: About $3-4 total for 9-12 rolls (30-45\u00a2 each vs $4-5 at cafes!)\n\nMini Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls (Air Fryer Style)\nMakes 9-12 rolls\n\nDough:\n- 2 cups all-purpose flour\n- 2 tbsp sugar\n- 1\u00bc tsp instant yeast\n- \u00bd tsp salt\n- \u00be cup warm milk (38-40\u00b0C)\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted\n- 1 egg (room temperature)\n\nFilling:\n- 2 tbsp softened butter\n- 2 tbsp brown sugar\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\n- \u00bc cup mini chocolate chips/chopped chocolate\n\nOptional Glaze:\n- \u00bc cup cream cheese, softened\n- 2 tbsp powdered sugar\n- 1 tbsp butter, soft\n- Splash of milk or vanilla\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Make the dough: Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm milk, egg, and melted butter. Mix into a shaggy dough. Knead 8-10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Cover and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours until doubled.\n\n2. Shape the rolls: Punch down the dough and roll into a rectangle about 10x12 inches. Spread softened butter, sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and chocolate chips. Roll tightly from the short side and slice into 9-12 mini rolls.\n\n3. Second rise: Place rolls in a parchment-lined air fryer tray, spaced slightly apart. Cover lightly and let rise for 30-40 minutes until puffed up.\n\n4. Air fry: Preheat air fryer at 160\u00b0C (320\u00b0F) for 3 minutes. Air fry rolls at 160\u00b0C for 8-10\nminutes until golden on top and soft inside. You may need to do this in 2 batches.\n\n5. Glaze: Mix cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and a splash of milk or vanilla until smooth. Spread over warm rolls.\n\nPro tips:\n- For extra gooey centers, add a few more chocolate chips in the spiral.\n- A pinch of salt on top of the glaze enhances the flavor.\n- If tops brown too quickly, loosely cover with foil during air frying.\n- No cream cheese? Make a simple glaze with just powdered sugar and milk!\n\nThese are seriously addictive and WAY cheaper than anything you'll find at a bakery. The air fryer batch size is perfect if you're cooking for 1-2 people and don't want leftovers going stale.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with air fryer baking to save on energy costs?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/5plsuopebsue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744629562.0, "score": 51, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1jywe08/budgetfriendly_mini_chocolate_cinnamon_rolls_air/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Bread butts (heels) and what to do about them.", "selftext": "This was a comment I made under a different post in a different subreddit but I realized it might be more useful over here. Some people don\u2019t like eating them or their kids outright refuse and often they end up getting trashed. Well, you can save them in your freezer and use them up in bread pudding if you want to cut down of food waste.\n\nThis is a recipe I made for people who can\u2019t afford or abide food waste and may have a limited budget or resources to scrounge up, but it\u2019s good for anybody and if you want to make it fancy by using fancy ingredients the rest of the steps are the same:\n\nFrench Toast bread pudding:\n\nYou will need a loaf pan, baking sheet, and and oven at 350F\n\n- Bag of butts (heels, ends, crusts your kids made you cut off, any other bread scraps. Go ahead and mix types, even stale baked goods like croissants or muffins)\n\n- Eggs\n\n- Milk or cream (also a good way to use up expired dairy, which is safe to cook with)\n\n- Optional: Fruit (frozen, fresh, even dried works if you soak it in warm water for 5min and strain it. Also use up overripe or bruised fruit your family will probably avoid and let go bad)\n\n- Cinnamon (optional: nutmeg, cloves, allspice, pumpkin or chai spice.)\n\n- Vanilla\n\n- Sugar\n\nCube the bread. You want enough to fill a loaf pan (or if you have a lot you can use a casserole dish). \n\nBeat the eggs in a large bowl. For one loaf pan\u2019s worth you will need 3 eggs, but you can make do with 2 large eggs if you supplement with extra dairy. Use more eggs if you want, or aren\u2019t on a budget and want the pudding to be more substantial.\n\nNext, add in your dairy. Depending on your available resources, the ratio of eggs to dairy can be 2:1 (recommended) or 1:1 or anywhere in between. So if you have 1 cup of beaten eggs you can use anywhere from 1/2 to 1 cup of milk or cream. If your budget demands a very milk-heavy batch, you can add a 1/4tsp of cornstarch to firm up the pudding.\n\nNext, whisk in your chosen spices and vanilla. (Another budget tip: if you don\u2019t have spices available, you can use a tea bag. Pour just enough boiling water into a cup to wet the bag, about 1/8cup, and let it soak until cool, then squeeze out the tea bag. The concentrated tea liquid can then be added to the egg mix. Avoid herbal tea flavours like mint or chamomile, instead use chai or black tea or spice/fruit teas) \n\nStir your bread into the egg mix and let it soak in for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally so all the bread gets soaked. \n\nAdd in your chopped/frozen fruit, and spoon into your greased loaf pan. Sprinkle some sugar on top. \n\nPlace the loaf pan onto a baking sheet with a thin layer of water on the bottom and bake at 350F for 20-30 min or until the top is crisp and the centre is cooked through.\n\nDepending on your egg/dairy ratio you might be able to slice the loaf when it\u2019s done, otherwise just spoon it out like a casserole. Serve with butter, and syrup or a sprinkling of sugar.\n\n\nETA just wanted to say I am loving all the other ideas, some so practical and others incredibly creative. Keep it coming!

If not everything is below as usual.\n\nIngredients:\n- Flour: 325g (2\u00bd cups)\n- Slightly warm milk: 190ml (\u00be cup + 2 tsp)\n- Butter: 50g (3\u00bd tbsp)\n- Instant yeast: 1 tsp (or 1\u00bc tsp active dry yeast)\n- Sugar: 2\u00bd tbsp (30g)\n- Salt: 1\u00bc tsp (7g)\n- Sausages: 8 pieces\n\nInstructions:\n1. Prepare the Dough:\n   - Mix warm milk, sugar, yeast, salt, butter, and flour until a shaggy dough forms\n   - Knead until soft and elastic\n\n2. First Proofing:\n   - Let dough rise for 30 minutes, covered\n   - Meanwhile, lightly brown sausages in a skillet, then cool\n\n3. Divide and Shape:\n   - Divide dough into 8 equal pieces (74g each)\n   - Roll each into a ball, then into a thin sheet\n   - Form into cylinders, seal edges\n   - Roll each into 10-12 inch ropes (thicker in middle)\n   - Wrap around sausages, tucking in ends\n   - Place on parchment-lined baking sheet with space between\n\n4. Second Proofing:\n   - Cover and let rise 45-60 minutes until puffy\n   - Brush with egg wash, add optional sesame seeds\n\n5. Bake:\n   - 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for 18-20 minutes until golden\n   - Place on lower rack to prevent over-browning\n   - Brush with butter immediately after baking\n\nPro Tips for Budget-Friendly Perfection:\n\n1. Upgrade your sausages: Mix cheap ground meat with caramelized onions and spices to make your own premium-tasting sausage filling at fraction of the cost\n\n2. Tangzhong method: Replace 2 tbsp of flour and 10 tbsp of milk with a cooked roux (mix and heat until thickened) for extra softness that lasts days\n\n3. Freezer-friendly: Make a double batch and freeze half before the second rise - thaw overnight in fridge when ready to bake\n\n4. Leftover transformation: Slice leftover rolls into rounds and toast for \"sausage coins\" - kids love these in soup or as snacks\n\n5. Flavor boosters: Add 1 tsp garlic powder and \u00bd tsp dried herbs to the dough for extra flavor without extra cost\n\n6. Perfect proofing hack: Use your microwave as a proofing box - heat a cup of water for 2 minutes, remove, then place dough inside (don't turn microwave on)\n\n7. Milk substitute: Use water with 1 tbsp powdered milk for even more savings if fresh milk is expensive\n\n8. Stretch your ingredients: Add 1/2 cup finely diced vegetables (carrot, onion, cabbage) to your sausage mixture to make it go further\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jirdqf", "created_utc": 1742824959.0, "score": 322, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 29, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1jirdqf/solved_the_secret_to_bakerystyle_sausage_rolls_at/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "I recreated my favorite restaurant's $18 double beef burger at home. Nailed it?", "selftext": "Hey \u2764\ufe0f I wanted to share this over here because I was quite proud of this double beef burger recipe completely made from scratch \u2764\ufe0f the recipe is on my channel and it was quite a bit of hard work. It would be awesome if y\u2019all could check it out. But everything is below too nonetheless\u2764\ufe0f\n\nBurger Bun Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n- 3/4 cup + 2 tsp milk\n- 1 tbsp sugar\n- 1 1/4 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp yeast\n- 50g butter\n- 325g flour\n\nInstructions:\n1. Combine milk, sugar, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Stir well and let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.\n2. Add the butter and gradually mix in the flour until a smooth dough forms.\n3. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until elastic and smooth.\n4. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled (about 1-1.5 hours).\n5. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions (to make 4 bun halves for 2 complete burgers).\n6. Shape into rounds and place on a baking sheet. Cover and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.\n7. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.\n8. Bake in air fryer at 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.\n\n Double Beef Patty Recipe\n\nIngredients:\n- 500g beef mince\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 tsp black pepper\n- 1 tsp garlic powder\n- 1 tsp onion powder\n- 1 tsp paprika\n- 2 tbsp BBQ sauce\n- 2 tbsp cold grated butter\n\nInstructions:\n1. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix gently (avoid overmixing).\n2. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions (125g each) to make 2 patties per burger.\n3. Shape into patties slightly larger than your buns (they'll shrink when cooking).\n4. Make a slight indent in the center of each patty (prevents bulging while cooking).\n5. Refrigerate patties for at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n6. Cook in a hot pan or grill for 3-4 minutes per side for medium doneness.\n7. Brush with BBQ sauce when almost done.\n8. Add cheddar cheese on top of each patty and cover lid to melt.\n \nIngredients:\n- 4 burger bun halves (2 tops, 2 bottoms)\n- 4 cooked beef patties with melted cheddar\n- Sliced red onions\n- Sliced tomatoes\n- Fresh lettuce leaves\n- Pickle slices\n- Special sauce (from previous recipe to be mentioned in your video)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Toast the cut sides of the buns if desired.\n2. Spread special sauce on the bottom bun.\n3. Layer with lettuce and tomato slices.\n4. Place the first cheese-topped patty.\n5. Add the second cheese-topped patty directly on top of the first.\n6. Add pickles and red onion slices.\n7. Spread more sauce on the top bun, if desired.\n8. Place the top bun over the assembled ingredients.\n\nTips for Success\n\n- For juicier double patties: Make each patty thinner than you would for a single patty burger (about 1/2 inch thick).\n- Patty size: Make the patties slightly larger than your buns as they will shrink during cooking.\n- Even cooking: Ensure all patties are uniform in thickness for consistent cooking.\n- Cheese placement: Add cheese to both patties for maximum flavor.\n- Stacking strategy: Place the patties directly on top of each other to create a true double burger experience.\n- For the buns: This recipe makes 4 bun halves, perfect for 2 complete burgers.\n- Air fryer batches: You may need to bake the buns in batches depending on your air fryer size.\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/wjwxnbcjw6qe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1742626925.0, "score": 660, "author": "DiahDreams", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1jh2r3a/i_recreated_my_favorite_restaurants_18_double/", "html_title": ""}

Place 2 cups uncooked rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cool water. Transfer to a large bowl and add enough filtered water to cover by at least 2 inches. Soak uncovered at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight. Filtered water is important in case there is a high amount of chlorine in your water, which will inhibit fermentation.\n\n    Soak the urad gota, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds. Place 1/2 cup whole urad gota and 2 tablespoons chana dal in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cool water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds. Add enough filtered water to cover by at least 2 inches. Soak uncovered at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight.\n\n    Drain the urad gota, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds. Drain the soaked whole urad gota, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds through a fine-mesh strainer, reserving the soaking liquid.\n\n    Blend the urad mixture. Place the urad mixture in a blender (work in batches if needed). (I use a Vitamix which does the job well. In India, the traditional method is to use a wet grinder.) With the motor running, slowly add about 1 cup of the reserved soaking liquid and blend until you get a smooth, light, and fluffy batter. Do not let the batter overheat. To check that it has been blended well, drop a little into a bowl of water. If the batter rises to the top, it has been blended enough. Pour the batter into a large bowl.\n\n    Drain the rice. Drain the soaked rice through the fine-mesh strainer, reserving the soaking liquid.\n\n    Blend the rice. Place the soaked rice in the now-empty blender (no need to rinse). With the motor running, slowly add about 1 cup of the reserved soaking liquid. Once blended, add in 1/4 cup cooked rice and continue blending until you have a mostly smooth batter that feels a little grainy when you rub it between two fingers.\n\n    Mix the blended rice and dal. Pour the rice batter into the urad batter and add 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt. Stir together with your hand \u2014 the heat in your hand is good to kick-start the fermentation process, while also adding in more wild yeast. You should have a loose, thick batter that falls through your hands easily but also coats your fingers at the same time.\n\n    Ferment the batter. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and place in a warm place (80 to 90\u00baF). (I usually place my batter in the oven with the light on and a large bowl of hot tap water on the rack below it. I change out the water a few times to keep the temperature warm and humid in the oven.) Let ferment 8 to 14 hours.\n\n    Check that the batter has fermented. When fermented, your batter will have almost doubled and look puffed on the top. It will also have a sour, fermented smell. When scooped with a spoon, it should be a frothy mass of bubbles. Note that in colder climates, the batter may not rise as much, but if it has the frothy, bubbly look and smells fermented, you can start making dosas with it.\n\n\nCook the dosas:\n\n  Stir the batter. Stir the batter a couple of times with a ladle. Ideally, you will have a thick, flowing batter with a consistency between cr\u00eape and pancake batter. If too thick, add filtered water a tablespoon at a time to thin it out.\n\n Prepare for cooking. Before cooking the dosas, set out a little bowl with ghee or oil, a teaspoon, a spatula, a cup of water, and a few paper towels or a silicone pastry brush by the stove. I use a 1/3 measuring cup and a slightly curved large serving spoon, flat ladle, or the measuring cup to spread my dosa.\n\n Heat a skillet with ghee. Heat a large cast iron skillet, griddle, or nonstick pan over medium heat. (If you are a first timer, I suggest that you start with a nonstick pan, as it will be more forgiving than the cast iron which you can work yourself up to.) Add a couple drops of ghee or oil to the pan and lightly smear it all over with a paper towel or silicone pastry brush. If you have a sprayer for oil that will work best here. At this point, you don\u2019t want to put too much ghee or oil, as this will make it difficult to spread the batter evenly. Sprinkle a few drops of water into the pan \u2014 if it sizzles, the pan is ready. Reduce the heat to low.\n\n Pour in batter. Pour 1/3 cup of the batter into the center of the pan. The batter should sizzle a bit.\n\n Spread the batter. Starting in the middle, swirl the batter using the bottom of a slightly curved large serving spoon, flat ladle, or measuring cup in a circular motion outwards until you have spread it out into a round dosa that is about 9 inches in diameter. It is important not to press down too hard with your spreading utensil. Spreading should happen more on the top surface than on the bottom.\n\n  Add ghee to the edges and top of dosa. Increase the heat to medium. Wait a few seconds for the dosa to sizzle a little in the pan, and then drizzle about 1 teaspoon of ghee or oil around the edges of the dosa and on top.\n\n Cook the dosa. Cook until the dosa is dried out on top and you can see some browning and crisp spots appearing on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. When it\u2019s ready, the dosa will peel off easily when you slide a flat spatula underneath. If you see the dosa browning but it is still sticking, just lower the heat and wait a few seconds, then probe around the edges with your spatula until you find an area that starts to give. Usually the whole dosa will unstick once you start to pull it up from that spot.\n\n Flip the dosa. Flip the dosa over and let cook for a few seconds. Flip it over again.\n\nFold the dosa. If serving as-is, fold the dosa in half in the pan, then transfer it onto a plate for serving.\n\nOr fill and fold the dosa. To serve as masala dosa, spread a spoonful or two of potato palya on one half of the dosa. Fold the dosa in half in the pan to cover the filling, then slide it onto a plate for serving.\n\nRepeat with the remaining batter. Cool down the pan so you can easily spread your next dosa and prevent it from sticking to the pan by sprinkling in a little water. When the sizzling stops, heat the pan back up for the next dosa. Mix the dosa batter well before cooking the next one.\n\nServe the dosas. Serve the dosas with chutney and sambar, or sprinkle with chutney pudi and serve with plain yogurt.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6yznt", "created_utc": 1741492202.0, "score": 60, "author": "Additional-Wall-6747", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1j6yznt/dosa_as_budget_breakfast/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Caps reserved for another application.\n\n\\- Tomatoes not yet used. They'll be part of tomorrow's dinner, along with buttered bread and smoked herring.\n\n\\- Green onions washed and trimmed. Trimmings in the stock pot. Green tops used for cilantro-tofu dressing. Whites not yet used.\n\n\\- Carrots peeled and trimmed. Trimmings in the stock pot. 3-4 smallest carrots cut into plain sticks for eating, put into container of water in fridge. 3-4 middle-sized carrots cut into sticks for pickling with daikon. Remaining carrots shredded on large box grater. 2C shredded carrots reserved for baking; remaining carrots added to salted cabbage.\n\n\\- Sweet peppers washed and cored. Seeds and green stem removed from cores before adding them to the stock pot. Flesh in container in fridge.\n\n\\- Cilantro washed. Stems removed and put in the stock pot. Leaves used to make cilantro-tofu dressing.\n\n\\- Ginger not yet used. Purchased for making ginger-sesame salad dressing.\n\n\\- Daikon washed and peeled. Ends trimmed and added to stock pot. Cut in half, then each half into wedges. Quick pickled in 1/2C water, 1/2C white vinegar, 1.5 Tbsp brown sugar and 1.5 tsp salt, along with about 1lb carrot sticks. Contained with brine in refrigerator.\n\n\\- Peeled and matchsticked the rutabaga. Brined in 4C water + 1Tbsp salt for 3 hours. Drained, rinsed, mixed with 1Tbsp gochujang + 1/4 apple, shredded. This will ferment at room temp for a day or two.\n\n\\- Green cabbage trimmed and cored. Washed outer leaves and core added to stock pot. Cabbage sliced thinly in shreds, then massaged with 1/2 Tbsp salt and approx. 1lb shredded carrot. In a container in the fridge, to be used as a salad or as a quickly sauteed side.\n\n\\- 1/4 of one Gala apple shredded and added to rutabaga ferment. Rest of that apple eaten for dessert. Remaining apples not yet used, but they'll be added to baked goods.\n\n\\- Stock pot. After adding all trimmings, filled with 8C water, along with 2 bay leaves, 2 pieces of kombu (optional), 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp bouillon powder. Simmer for 30 minutes, cool, drain and refrigerate. 2L of broth for free!\n\nI also bought a bag of potatoes. When I get around to cooking them, I'll go through the whole bag and pick out the ones with the least life left in them and/or ones with big cuts, holes or blemishes. Once they're washed and trimmed, they'll be fine, plus once they're out of the bag, the others will last a bit longer. Next time I go for potatoes, I'll roughly sort them by size into Big and Small and use them on that basis. Using all Big or all Small potatoes makes it easier to cut them into even pieces that will cook evenly.\n\nIn total, I spent $37 for all of this, plus two packages of soft tofu and one container of yogurt. It took roughly 2 hours to achieve, which is comparable to a meal prep session, but leaves more options open for mixing and matching according to whim during the week. Having all this produce in a state of being ready (or nearly ready) to eat makes it easier to grab some and add it to a plate, or even just as a snack.

So when I tell you it hurt me to pay full price for some ground meat today (beef and pork), I need you to believe me. A total of 3 lbs of meat cost me $19 entire human monies.\n\nThis is for a special occasion - a birthday dinner - so it's already outside the norm. At the store, it's more money per pound for a smaller package of ground beef (because of course it is), so I grab the bigger one. They've only got one size of ground pork. I grab both and come home.\n\nSo, because I got more beef than I needed, I split that package in half. One half gets mixed with the pork and gets braised for an hour with a half-can of diced tomatoes and some stock cubes. Only half of this braise will go in the final dish. The other half might make some chili or sloppy joes or something - or might get frozen for another time.\n\nThe second half of the ground beef gets mixed up into meatballs and baked with the other half-can of tomatoes.

This would feed me a minimum of 3 meals, if very hungry, but up to 6 if not.\n\nCost breakdown:\n\nRolls 3.55 (for 8)\nPeppers 3.75 (for 3)\nProvolone cheese 1.99\nMild Italian Sausage 3.49\nOrganic marinara 2.45\nGreen beans 2.75\n\nFor 3 meals, it's $5.99 per, 6 meals $3.00.  Not included in the cost was seasonings, bread crumbs, onion and garlic.  I almost always have these items.  If you have to purchase them, it would increase the cost by a few dollars.  But, those items could be used for multiple meals.  I also only use half of each roll for garlic bread, so those can be used for multiple meals, as well.\n\nIf I wanted to stretch the meal for 6 hungrier people, I would add a side of rice or pasta.  Even with that, it's still under $5 per meal.  Shopping in store would have probably saved a little, too.\n\nIf I had to change anything, I would probably not use the cheese next time.  I absolutely love cheese, but don't think it added much to the dish.  Everything was very flavorful without it.  \n\nRecipe:\n\n3 bell peppers\n1 lb Italian sausage\n1/4 c bread crumbs \n1/2 yellow onion\n3 cloves garlic\n1 jar marinara\n3-6 slices Provolone or mozzarella \n\nTo make:\n\nSlice each pepper in half. Remove seeds, ribs, and stem.  Set aside.\n\nMince/finely chop onion and garlic.  In a large bowl mix Sausage, bread crumbs, garlic, onion, and desired seasonings. (Salt, pepper, herbs, etc.) Fill each pepper half with meat mixture.\n\nPour half of the marinara in the bottom of slow cooker.  Place stuffed peppers on top of the marinara, then top with remaining sauce. Cook on low for 4-6 hours, high for 3-4 hours.  The peppers are done when meat reaches a temperature of 165\u00b0.\n\nServe with garlic bread and green beans.

The thinning was i want fat, protein, sugar, salt, and something fresh and green. Non super spicy chili peppers work well, Anaheim or poblano. Bell peppers tend to taste watery to me. The seaweed is small pieces of kelp for salt or minerals or iodine etc, trace nutrients. Other seaweeds might work too. I have no idea on the cost per serving. Peanuts -- 12 oz lasts me 3 days or so, for $5 bag on the higher end of costs, bulk I've seen for cheaper. Honey 22oz 10% used over 3 days, $10. Persian cucumbers, 16 oz for $4, every two-three days. Seaweed, $10 I've maybe used 5% in three days. So based on this, per day is $1.66 + $0.30 + $2 + $0.17 = $4.13 a day for lunch and I'm not too hungry at dinner either.

Not including the cost of the Jamaican curry powder as the price online at Walmart was way more than when I purchased in store. Went with the canned food for convenience this time due to time constraints to soak and pressure cook and all. Negating minimal cost of seasonings and cooking oil. It was about $10 for the supplies and would have net 6 full size burritos if I hadnt already used a few tortillas in the past for other dishes.

Saut\u00e9 til translucent. Toss in chopped potatos till warmed thru . Add Goya adobo, and stir. Add in drained lentils and curry powder and stir till cooked thru. Just a few minutes before end of cooking add the little amount of knorr tomato powder and let it cook in. \n\nFrom there let it cook down and fill the tortillas while remembering that it needs to be in the bottom third of tortilla to roll properly. Add little bit of cheese to hold together and for taste. I call it chipotle style rolling for bottom 1/3 filling , take bottom part and go over food and kinda swipe back to lock it in , fold both sides on and roll till the top of burrito is sitting on top of the tortilla flap. I might recommend warming the tortillas just a little to make more pliable as I ripped a tiny corner on one or two on the folded corners on side. \n\nafterwards toss them into a heated pan at about a medium to medium-high heat ( 5 or up to 7 out of 10 dial ).

{"title": "The Tumbledown Method of Meal Planning", "selftext": "My favourite cookbook of all time is Economy Gastronomy. I recommend it to anyone who asks what cookbook to get, and bought it a second time when I was forced to leave my cookbook collection behind.\n\nI mention this because a core tenet of that book is the idea of 'tumbledown' meals. That is, making a large batch of something that acts as an ingredient in subsequent meals. It can help to think of it as upcycling leftovers, so that rather than eating the same thing over and over, you have a similar thing with minor alterations that makes less work overall.\n\nThe example I'll use begins with this recipe:\n\n**Vegetarian Braised Mince**\n\n300 g finely diced mushrooms\n\n3 Tbsp oil\n\n3 C frozen diced onions (about 3 diced onions)\n\n6 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped (about 3 Tbsp)\n\n200 g raw brown lentils, rinsed and drained\n\n2 C TVP mixed with 2 C water\n\n400 g chopped tomatoes (about 1/2 a can)\n\n1 Tbsp soy sauce\n\n3 beef stock cubes + 1L boiling water\n\nIn a large, deep-sided skillet, heat oil over high heat. Add mushrooms and cook until most of the water is cooked out. Add onion and garlic, and saute until onions are transluscent. Stir in remaining ingredients and let simmer uncovered for about 1 hour.\n\nCool and divide into 3. Use as an add-in for tomato sauce.\n\nI make a batch of this mince every few months. One third of a batch can mix into some tomato sauce and be used as part of a lasagna, so I can make three homemade lasagnas over that period of months with far less effort than such a task would typically demand.\n\nI also recently took a dose of this recipe and made it into a 'meatball' mix using this recipe:\n\n**Beef Meatballs**\n\nFor mix:\n\n500g ground beef\n\n1 large egg\n\n1/4 C breadcrumbs\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n3/4 C veggie add ins (1/2 C frozen chopped kale, 1/4 C diced onion)\n\n1 Tbsp seasonings (1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp curry, 1/4 tsp cumin & nutmeg)\n\nFor cooking:\n\n1/4 C BBQ sauce + up to 1/4 C water\n\nMix ingredients together well & form into meatballs of about 25g each. Place in an oven-safe dish and coat with thinned BBQ sauce. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes at 350F.\n\nMeatloaf sandwich alteration: Spread mixture in a 1/2\" layer on a greased or lined baking sheet. Coat with straight BBQ sauce, and bake at 350F for 15 minutes. Cut into squares to fit your preferred bread.\n\nUsing the meatloaf alteration, and replacing the meat with 1/3 batch of vegetarian braised mince, we had hot meatloaf sandwiches the night I made it, using toasted brown bread and topping with some cheese.\n\nA couple of days pass, and now I want to use up the remaining 'meatloaf'. There are four slices. We could have sandwiches again, but we eat plenty of sandwiches. I have no potatoes or vegetables to make a 'meat and potatoes' plate. So I do my usual fallback: pizza.\n\nI make my own crust, but this could just as easily be done with a premade crust or dough from the store. Then I topped it with some sauce (plain canned), the 'meatloaf' that I'd cut into smaller pieces, and some shredded mozzarella. Baked it at 425F for 15 minutes, then served it up.\n\nThis is all a very long way of saying that this kind of exercise can be carried out with any number of foods. It's less of a method than a way of looking at food, and making the most of what you've got.\n\nThanks for reading my gigantic post.

{"title": "Ramen noodle stir fry", "selftext": "Ramen noodle stir fry is a cheap- high yielding meal you can cater to fit your personal preferences. My mom got the recipe off a lunchtime episode of Mr. Food back in the 90\u2019s. I cook up 1 lb of ground pork in sesame oil and light soy sauce in a large skillet (I\u2019m sure a wok would be preferable but I use what I have). Prior to cooking the pork I chopped up a bunch of vegetables (orange and red bell pepper, calabacitas, broccoli, cauliflower, and celery). Chop up half a head of green cabbage. You can also use a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables and it\u2019s still just as good. In addition I always like to add the little canned baby corn and water chestnuts. I usually buy a stir fry sauce I like because I don\u2019t have the correct ingredients to make my own sauce. Then you need a couple packages of ramen noodles- you won\u2019t use the seasoning packets so any brand/flavor will work. Add the vegetables (besides the cabbage, squash and the corn and the water chestnuts) to the undrained pork. Season with more sesame oil and soy sauce. I cooked the vegetables between 8-10 mins (with the lid on- stirring frequently) then added in the cabbage and stir well. Cook (again with the lid on) until the cabbage has reduced by half and then add in the rest of the vegetables. I also added in about 1 1/2 Tbsps of jarlic (I don\u2019t like chopping garlic and don\u2019t have a press so I use the jarred stuff). Cook until the squash are nearly soft. Add in (2-3 packages) of crushed ramen noodles, and then either add about 3/4 cup of water (I used some extra reduced sodium chicken broth I had in the fridge) to start. Put the lid on and stir about every 2 mins, adding more liquid as needed until the noodles are cooked. Once everything is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed add your sauce, and cook a few more minutes until everything is coated and heated through. \n\nThis makes a HUGE amount of food (taking shortcuts like using frozen vegetables/ using the jarred sauce) will cut your time down.

I will buy bread every now and then and make a meal of it or just have the broth for a snack or cooking base. When I cook rye or barley, I save the boiled water and drink that as well, as it gets really starchy and flavorful.

Marinade the chicken pieces with some soy, a tiny bit of sugar, corn starch and oyster sauce if you have it. \n2. In a pan, cook the chicken pieces until cook through \nAnd set aside .\n3. In the same pan, warm up the cream style corn on medium low slightly bubbly, return the cooked chicken into the pan to coat with the corn sauce. You can beat an egg and slowly add to the dish ( like in egg drop soup) if you like. \n4. Serve over rice. \n\nYou can make this in a big batch and it\u2019s a great lunch thing and easy to heat up.

Cut firm tofu into cubes.\n2. Marinade pork with water, soy, sugar, white pepper, Chinese wine, oyster sauce ( you don\u2019t need to add all if you don\u2019t have them) for about 15 min.\n3. Pan sear the tofu until somewhat golden on all sides. Set aside.\n4. Portion out the pork( I only used about 1/3lb cause I want to save the pork for something else). \n5. Cook the ground pork in a pan until cook through , add a bit of garlic \n6. Make a sauce with oyster sauce, soy, sugar ,water and corn starch. \n7. Add cooked tofu into the pan and add the sauce mixture. Let simmer on low and stir occasionally until the sauce thicken to your liking.\n8. Serve over rice. \n\nSo I can\u2019t account for the condiments cause I have them on hand constantly, but the tofu and pork dish legit costed $3 for the protein and it\u2019d be enough for 3 ( depends on serving size).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1i1wiod/another_simple_ideas/", "created_utc": 1736944880.0, "score": 5, "author": "genegenet", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1i1wiod/another_simple_ideas/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I legit waste most of my time just sorting through my lists attempting to keep my focus on what's most important...).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1hhx0xt/grocery_app_that_sorts_by_aisles_and_can_filter/", "created_utc": 1734626529.0, "score": 3, "author": "SL-VA", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1hhx0xt/grocery_app_that_sorts_by_aisles_and_can_filter/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "The Worst Turkey I Ever Roasted out of 36 years", "selftext": "I had the worst turkey dinner of my entire life. Let me state I have been roasting turkeys for 36 years. All but my first one which admittedly was overdone and dry have been moist tender  birds with beautiful browned skin and a pleasure to carve. This includes 6 wild turkeys I personally harvested. Most all the birds averaged more than 20 lbs in dry weight. This week's bird weighed 19.66 lbs.\n\nI treated this bird the same as I have done all the others. It was frozen so took 4 days in fridge to defrost it. Took it out Thursday morning and washed the bird off inside and out.\n\nPatted it dry then wiped a bit of olive oil and butter mix on the skin and applied simple salt and pepper seasoning. Seasoned the inside similarly.\n\nSet it in a roasting pan on a rack and added a butter and broth mixture to the bottom to baste it with and to mix with drippings for gravy.\n\nRoasted as usual being careful not to dry it out basting it regularly. It was done and at temperature 15 minutes earlier than anticipated removed from oven and placed on a platter and wrapped it in a tent of foil for it to finish and to let the meat rest.\n\nNow all of my turkeys have been delicious and moist and tender and easy to carve. \n\nNotice the picture above, that was the brand and type used this week.\n\nFirst the bird was like carving styrofoam board. That dry and tough.  The only moisture found in meat on this bird was in what was in contact with drippings and it was tough also.\n\nMy question is this, is there some special way you should roast an \"Organic\" turkey. \n\nI ask as I am worried I might have done something wrong here but reviewing my process In did not deviate from what I have done in the 35 birds previous to this.  The meat was dry and tough like the slabs of jerky you buy at the gas station. Except the jerky was chewable.\n\nThe meat from this turkey is so tough I can not use it for sandwiches. The white meat is like stringy cardboard and the dark meat is worse.\n\nAnyone with experience with this brand and type of turkey please chime in on your experience with it and any ideas.\n\nI appreciate it.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/pfunh36wed4e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1733117081.0, "score": 195, "author": "Material_Disaster638", "num_comments": 79, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1h4nqhi/the_worst_turkey_i_ever_roasted_out_of_36_years/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Really easy Shreded chicken for multiple meals.", "selftext": "Hi\n\nOften recipes for shredded chicken are not much more than simmer it in some stock cube/stock, or worse just boiling water. \n\nThese two 350gm breasts cost \u00a31 each.. That's pretty cheap in the UK. \n\nI like to make shredded/pulled chicken as it stretches alot further. \nFrom the pictures you can see I have enough for 4 individual pies, some for sandwiches and a decent amount to use in a two person meal. \n\nObviously you can use more or less, stretch with extra veg and my seasoning is just my prefenace. Mix it up how you like but I'll give you a run down of what I did. \n\n1 teaspoons of Old Bay \n1.5 teaspoons of Vegetable stock (I'm not sure how wide available that brand is, it's polish I think but in the UK most supermarkets sell it. It's amazing.) \n0.5 teaspoons of garlic granules (not powder) \n\n\nGive the chicken a pat down with kitchen paper to make sure it's dry. Give it a spray or rub on some oil just lightly. \nSeason both sides of the chicken and (in my case using gloves) rub the dry rub all over. \n\n\nCover it up on a plate and put in the fridge. Ideally for 2+ hours but it's not one to leave overnight so maybe make in the morning and cook after work? It works too if you only have an hour. 30 minutes is the shortest time I've let it marinate.. It was still good. \n\n\nAnyway. Get a pan onto medium hot (not searing), a few sprays of oil or a small amount if your not spraying. I put both large breasts into the pan and just leave them alone. Don't move them, poke or prod. Give them 4-6 minutes to get some color and they will easily move when you shake the pan. \n\nTurn them over for another 4-8 minutes (the pan has cooled by now and it needs longer to brown the second side) and be ready with some boiling water. \n\nAs the chicken was seasoned with veg stock there was no need to use a stock to poach the chicken. \n\nOnce the chicken is browned on both sides and there is some yummy seared goodness on the bottom of the pan pour in the boiling water. It's going to bubble, steam and then you'll notice all the caramelised goodness lift off the pan. \n\nNext part is easy. Just use a wooden spoon or whatever you have to scrape up all the browned bits of flavor. (wooden or silicon won't sctrach your pan) \n\nPop the lid on and leave it for 12 minutes.. Yes you have to use a timer, I do at least or I forget what I was doing. ADHD brain is a hazard, ha. \n\nOnce it's done I check to make sure the thickest part has got to 75c (Sorry don't know that in f) and put them into a air tight container to rest. \n\nIf you are using the chicken for a meal immediately then let them rest for Atleast 10 minutes. \n\nI left mine for an hour then took two forks to them for shredding. \n\n\nI have turned \u00a32 worth of chicken into four individual pies (obviously extras will be needed), Atleast the three sandwiches I've made and enough to give my dog a little treat. \n\n\n(I did try to make a pie but wasted some chicken as I had a temor and spilt sugar into the pan, ha!) \n\nI'll post how the pies comes out tomorrow.

{"title": "Grocery receipts apps for money back or free food", "selftext": "Most of these I\u2019ve used for about a year some only 6 months. I was attempting to make budget meals and get back into couponing again this last January, but most of the coupon site I used weren\u2019t as good. So I found out about these receipt scanning apps. I tried out a lot of them (and like walking apps for cash too) But I was looking for free food or the equivalent of cash back for my purchases. Any little bit helped at the time so I was downloading all of them but now that time has passed I have weeded out the bad ones and the good ones are what is left. Do what you want with this info I just wanted to help save money on groceries \n \nReceipt Scanning/ E-reciepts / Cashback Apps - Favorites Last to First\n\nRakuten - 8/27/24 () $ 10.80 This one is a cash back app alot like Honey (which gives you cashback and finds you Coupons and promo codes) I just got it last month and got 12% back For a $100 Oil change. The cash out is every 3 months and they just drop the full amount it in your account on 2/15, 5/15, 8/15, 11/15.\n\nHoney - This app I've had since 2015. Originally It was just on my PC but I use it to find promo codes for everything. It also has cash back for quite a few places. I couldn't tell you how much I've made honestly Since January of this year I've made $38.40 Cashback and countless promo codes lol\n\nFrisbee - 1/13/24 $32.17 I do like receipt scanning apps some are a little slow to pay out, most of them give you more payouts the longer you use. This ones the slowest but still simple with no ads and the cashout works.\n\nIbotta - 6/14/24 $9.75( pqcbrsy ) This one is a cashback app. Look up the item on the app, select the cashback for the items available. Then just scan your receipts Or sometimes the item. I had this one in my extreme couponing era. It's pretty good.\n\nReceipt Hog - 1/12/24 $26.55 ( gak28203 ) Its acute app Easy to use\u00a0 It's not the biggest payout but if Im snapping pics For other receipt apps might as well for this legit one too well worth it. The payouts work\n\nReceipt Jar - 1/12/24 $37.18 ( HOPEPJ128 )This one gives you more the longer you're a member but for a lot of the Ereceipts you need to refresh the Connection once a week or so. Just do it when you snap pics of your paper receipts though and it downloads them with the correct points.\n\nCoinout - 6/14/24 $ 20.75 Very Quick money took me less than a month to reach their \"Diamond level\u201d which just means a higher payout for each receipt and bigger rewards. I haven't had it as long as the others but it's up there in my Favorites. It's also got as low as $3 payouts\n\nNCP - 8/30/24 $ 25.35 I had applied to be on this one at sometime this year and got on a waitlist. I heard about the National Consumer Panel in my couponing days but never applied. I do like this one. It's not scanning receipts though. It's scanning barcodes and entering amounts. I will say it does take a little longer for Big shopping trip but it's kinda fun to me. So to each their own\n\nFetch - 4/13/24 $109.70 ( TP41AA ) Wow love this app. Just try it for real. They give big bonuses for a lot of stuff!  They have cash back for items. It has a Fun interface. This one I wish I had found sooner! Love this App 5 stars. They even added some more cash back and rebates for delivery items. Use my promo Code for a fat welcome bonus too!

{"title": "Help with meal inspiration please? High protein", "selftext": "I intend to try jamming together lunch and dinner to one meal with about 40g protein. The idea is to do an intermittent fasting regime based on eating early in the day so I get better utilization of the energy according to the circadian rythm. It\u00b4s also strategic because the few times I do overeat it\u00b4s always in the evenings and I want to lose a bit of weight.  \nBut I am trying to stick to a tight budget and an issue is that I only have 30 minutes lunch and am not a 'volume eater', my gut likes 'normal' or 'small but satiating' better. But yeah, I aim to try it anyway. Thought it could be good to know so people don\u00b4t think that I consider an almost OMAD-supersize meal good, quite the opposite or it would have been easier to load up on protein. My food budget for the whole weeks lunches is 15$.\n\nIdeally, I would be able to meal prep the weeks 5 lunches at once, but have some 'extras' ready to make the dish a lil bit different towards the end of the week. Like a different sauce or side veggie/carb or something.  \nI aim to cook gluten free and mixed vegetarian/animal based foods because my gut can\u00b4t deal with enough beans and such at once but only meat would become bad quality or expensive on my budget. Also good amounts of fibers, complex carbs, good savoury taste (so I do spend some on seasonings/sauces and sometimes find it worth to add a lil bit extra to the budget if it\u00b4s for a nice seasoning). I have a Cosori Dual Blaze Airfryer and a Crockpot express (so pressure cooking + slow cooking) and I love to use them when possible.\n\nSo far I have come up with this meal from mostly foods I already have got at home;\n\nChicken inner fil\u00e9s (frozen 700g, 140g protein), with 5 dl of red lentils (dry, 40g of protein) that I mash so they are sort of disguised in the dish, figured it would be easier to eat in one sitting, served with oat rice the first 2-3 days (so another 4g protein/day from the rice on those days)  and then I come up with something else as a side such as brussel sprouts/zoodles. The idea is that it\u00b4s gonna be a pot with coconut milk, spices, onion, some veggies such as bell peppers and carrots. Divided into 5 portions, in case that was not clear.\n\nSome other foods I already have that I would love to come up with recipes for;  \n\\- Small white beans  \n\\- Yellow peas  \n\\- Sausages (it\u00b4s just 10g protein/100g sausage, swedish 'Falukorv', pretty neutral taste)  \n\\- Black beans (was thinking about trying them as a base for gluten free pie crust)\n\nSo yeah, for a total of at least close to 200g protein and 15$ for 5 portions, gluten free, healthy, not too heavy to eat for a small eater in less than 30 min and best case scenario ideas for variation towards the end of the week. Thank you in advance for any input! (:\n\n\n\n\\-UPDATE-   \nI got a lot of inspiration from just the few current posts in combo with the list of ingredients that I have. It\u00b4s so valuable to hear how other people are thinking! Currently, I actually think I have roughly enough for the next 4 weeks worth of lunch boxes. \n\n1. The meal I wrote in the initial post (chicken stew with lentils, coconut milk, oat rice etc)  \ncost: about 7$ mainly for veggiesand coconut milk + food I already have  /7$\n\n2. Oven sausage with 'regular' household cheese, custard, tomato puree, fried eggs, boiled potatoes, baked cabbage or such (cheap veggie).   \nI would buy the cheese at campaign price, 1,1kg for 10,50$, (I will have 800g left), eggs at special price 5,65$ for 30 and 25 eggs left for later/breakfast, cabbage at special price for 1$ per kilo, so likely 1,5kg/1,50$ and half of it left. I have the rest already, got some really cheap sausage that I put in the freezer last week (800g for 2$). /17.65$\n\n3. Pie with crust made of white beans, tuna filling (canned). There are actually a lot of fancy ingredients I need such as sun dried tomatoes, feta cheese, corn, canned tuna, (eggs but I would have gotten them already), it\u00b4s supposed to be creme fraiche but I would sub it for cottage cheese, I already got beans and other but I would buy tuna 3,20$, sundried tomatoes 1,90$, feta cheese 1,90$, canned corn 1,30$, cottage cheese 2,70$  /11$ \n\n4. Soup made with a big bunch of white beans and tomato sauce. I already have beans and crushed tomatoes. I\u00b4d be using leftovers of the cottage cheese above. I\u00b4d make fry bread out of oat meal flour and psyllium husk which I have got already. I\u00b4d make scrambled eggs on 8 eggs which I have gotten already above.  I\u00b4d use a semi-fancy sausage on campaign price, cognacsmedwurst 2,60$ for 350g for some additional foodiness and flavor (I\u00b4d be using about half of it), + leafy green salad 1,60$  / 4:20$\n\nSo sure I already had a bunch of the ingredients since last month but \\~33$ for 4 weeks seems promising. It\u00b4s not the entire months food budget, but not far from it actually... Pretty cool! \n\nThank you for the inspo!

I heated the stew back up the next day and to make sure it was a one container frozen meal I added some frozen peas, string beans and a can of cannelloni beans. It was what I had in the freezer and cupboard that my mum can eat, having oral cancer. You can add whatever you have or enjoy. \n\nI went to the shop and got some potatoes and onions as again I had run out. \n\nAs mash doesn't really freeze well (for me) I sliced the potatoes into thinish slices and dumped them into cold water. Put the hob on low and braught to a low boil. You can salt the water (I prefer to) but I need to keep salt down for mum. \n\nOnce the water is gently boiling I gave it a few minutes and then drained them whilst running a cold tap to stop them cooking more. I wanted them firm but par boiled enough they won't be ruined with freezing. \n\nOnce cold I cut the slices in half and layered onto the stew. I almost ran out but managed to get a single decent layer. \n\nAs I had used the same herbs in the stew I decided to grab the last of my garden herbs which admittedly aren't great right now but free. Gave them a chop along with the onion into small peices. \n\nSprinkled on a bit of the fresh thyme and rosemary on each container, shared out the red onion between each and then some parsley. \n\nBasically done.

You *can* cook from frozen but i prefer to defrost in the fridge the day before. Mum tends to just take them out of the freezer and straight into cooking. As the stew was cooked long and slow, the meat doesn't need softening however it does need to be at a decent temperature.. I'm over cautious. \n\nI intended these frozen meals to be stand alone dishes, with he amount of meat, veg and potatoe but they can also be halfed when cooked and shared between two with sides. \n\nI hope you're having a good day! \n\nAs a point of reference the entire 8+ dishes came to under \u00a31.50 each if eaten as is.

I understand things better in pictures. \n\nThe beef bones are from morrisons and surprisingly a good amount of meat for making stock. \u00a35 in total, not too bad. \n\nGave them a good bit of seasoning with what I  had in the cupboard so: 5 grinds of salt, about 10 grinds of the mixed pepper (use any you have), 1/4 teaspoon of dried rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon of dry thyme.

{"title": "$20/week Chinese Bao or Dumplings", "selftext": "Ingredients (Canadian Pricing):\n\n$7 Ground Pork (500grams)\n$8 worth of vegetables (either or in combination of cabbage, spinach, green onions, carrots, mushrooms, leeks, etc). \n\n$15 per week (+$5 per week flour/seasoning/yeast, etc)\n\n\u2014\n\nVegetables portions should be 2.5kg or more (usually opting for whatever is on sale to expand the filling portion to meat).\n\nThis allows for 4-8 big dumpling or bao per day (2 cups of flour).\n\nThe ratio of meat to vegetable filling is 1:5 (but can scale to 1:10 if budget is constraint). \n\nThe 1:5 scale gives it a meatier taste.\n\n1:10 scale will be more vegetarian, while the small amount of meat acts more of a seasoning/spice agent (the fat and meat for an umami or a savoury taste). \n\n\u2014\n\nDumpling vs Bao: the only difference between these two are cooking method and the addition of yeast to rise the dough or not. Dumpling can be steam like Bao, but are often pan fried, steam in the pan, then refried for a golden crust. \n\n\u2014\n\nQuick Instruction:\n\n1. Combine 2cup of all purpose flour into large bowl\n2. Add in 1tsp of baking powder (for dumplings) or 1tbsp of activated yeast (for Bao).\n3. Add in 3TBSP of oil\n4. 1 cup of warm/hot water\n5. Mix until sticky dough appears\n*Restrain from adding too much flour, as a stickier dough is better, and will become less sticky as you knead it. When rolling out the final dough for dumpling or Bao wrapper, you will be using more flour to prevent it from sticking to the roller or table, so you don\u2019t want to over flour the dough at this early stage due to that.\n6. Knead the dough 100 times or for 5-10 minutes. You can add flour if the dough is too sticky but with caution.\n7. Let rest for 30 minutes (dumplings) or 1 hour (Bao). Difference is that yeast in Bao requires more time to activate.\n8. Quickly knead dough after resting a bit, then split into 8 smaller doughs (1 cup = 4 Bao or large dumplings). \n9. Roll out into circular wrappers, using flour to dust the roller and table to prevent sticking.\n10. With your finger tips, wet your tips and dab the small amount of water on the edge of the flatter dough wrapper. This is to help it stick together when wrapping the dough to the final form.\n11. Put in filling and wrap dough (video tutorial online for various versions of wrap are available).\n12.

I had half a red onion in the fridge. One garlic clove for good measure. I'd have liked a carrot or two but the local shop didn't have any. \n\nGave it all a chop ready for cooking. Then onto the chicken! \n\nI have some chicken breasts frozen individually so I plucked one out and defrosted it in the microwave (I didn't have time/foreplanning to let it defrost overnight) whilst chopping the veg. \n\nI cut it into very thin strips, gave it a spritz of oil and sprinkled 1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder, 1 teaspoon of old bay seasoning and a good 'eye balling it' 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper. Then just gave it a good mixing on the chopping board, making sure everything is mixed well. \nI did put some cling film over it while it was waiting to be cooked, but the vegetables need to cook first! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\nI oiled up the pan that was on low and threw everything but the mushrooms and garlic in. Quick few stirs then ignored it while I watched a movie for about 10-15 minutes.. I got distracted but that's ADHD for you \ud83d\udc4d\nNow that it was starting to cook nicely I gave it a stir, left it for another 20 minutes. \n\nOnce the base veg got softer and had nice crispy bits in went the mushrooms with more butter than I care to admit, also 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme. Mushrooms seem to suck up the butter while they get rid of their moisture, so I let the whole lot cook for a while. \n\nInto a bowl once the mushrooms had little crispy bits and were not rubbery. \n\nChicken bits into the pan next in batches, when slightly browned they go into the bowl with the veg. Once the last batch of chicken is cooked I turned the hob onto max for a minute sor it was very hot the added 250ml of chicken stock made from asda/Walmart cheap chicken cubes. Gets all that cooked goodness off the bottom of the pan, and saves washing up! \n\nThe last bit of the soup is easy, put in a can of condensed mushroom soup. Stir, simmer for along as it takes to make the side. \n\nI'm not sure what bread this is, it was \u00a31.20 for 6 rolls. It made at a localish bakers, tastes and has the mouthfeel of home made bread and normally costs \u00a33 a bag. Bargain. \n\nSliced them open and gave them a little rub of butter to get them going. Once they were a lightly toasted I rubbed a cut garlic glove all over. On went a good amount of butter and a stinking of mixed herbs. Back into the pan they went for about ten minutes on high heat, turning often. \n\nPlate it all up and mum was happy and full.

Instead she offered to make me dinner. As she struggles to see I offered to cook and the food would be more than enough payment. \n\nSo onto the recipes. Please keep in mind I'm happy to chat and relax while food is on the go, so 1 hour cooking just onions is no hassle for me. My neighbour just lives a chin wag so she was happy while I did my thing. Q\n\n\nI used what she had in the house which is more than what I normally have, so it was fun and a bit luxurious for me. \n\nSliced 1 very large mild yellow onion, 4 white cooking onions, 3 red onions. \n\nAfter my eyes stopped watering, I melted about two tablespoons of butter in some olive oil. In went 1 bay leaf, 1/2 teaspoon of dry rosemary and 1 teaspoon of dry thyme. I gave it a good 5 minutes to melt and get the herbs fragrant. I didn't have fresh. \n\nThen it's just a case of throw in all the onions. Mix so everything is coated in herby oil and put the hob on its lowest setting. Gently cook the onions for much longer than you think is needed, then cook for longer. That huge amount of onions cooked down so it didn't cover the pan. Lots of sweet, charred and jammy onion goodness. \n\nWhilst that was all happening on it own, with the occasional stir, I peeled and boiled the potatos she had in her cupboard. Gave them a good mashing, added some cheddar cheese and butter. She came in and said mash always needs mustard... She put a hefty pinch (or three) of Coleman mustard powder in, and I'm guessing 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper, and the same with black pepper. \n\nSo after a break to stir the onions again I put half the mash into a foil lined tray, put a sliced up ball of asdas cheapest mozzarella on too., some Asda cheapest mixed herbs and covered it with the rest of the mash. \nOn top I put one sliced tomatoe, more mixed herbs then some grated cheese. \n\n\nNow the cheese and potato pie is ready for the ovan, back to the onions. \n\nIn went a tablespoon of plain flour whilst stirring then gave it a few minutes to cook. \n\nNow that the onions where browned, and starting to get jammy I cheekily put in a glass of her red wine. I don't like wine but she does, so seemed to be a decent option. It was maybe 200mls, I guess. I used a beef stock cube to make 500mls of stock, added it while stirring.\n\nWhile that pan was gently bubbling away I peeled and cut some carrots to boil. Put some frozen beans and sweetcorn into a pan, and remembered I hadn't put the sausages on to cook. \n\nPopped them into the air fryer, 200 for 18 minutes. Once done I put them into the onion gravy mostly to stay warm while I put the cheese and potatoe pie in the ovan for 25 minutes on 230c. \n\nI did taste test the sausage and onion, added 1 teaspoon tomatoe puree, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of the vinegar she had and a teaspoon of marmite! \n\nAll in all it's a very rich, warming and filling dish made for my neighbor and I put the leftovers into tubs so she has food for a few days. \n\nI just wish I knew how to plate food well and how to take pictures. Oh well, free food for helping someone, huzzah! \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fs9xea", "created_utc": 1727631423.0, "score": 171, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1fs9xea/im_not_great_at_plating_or_taking_pictures_but/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Spread the cure on the plastic wrap, I used sugar and salt in a 2:1 ratio, some recipes say 1:1 but I think it's too salty. Idk how much I just eyeball it so there's a layer the skin side of the salmon can rest on it. \n\n3. Cover the top with the cure and you'll be making lox. If you take the extra step and season it, you'll have lax, I think, idk, I'm not any of the races that make these things so that's my understanding. You can add gin, ground pepper, fresh or dried dill. Or not, the important part is the to cover the flesh side of the salmon with the sugar and salt so it covers the entire flesh side and remains visible. Whenever you can't see salt and sugar on the fish then you need to add more. I don't have exact portion because I eyeballed it. \n\n4. Wrap it up, poke corners in the Saran wrap packet so liquid can leak out. I used the Tupperware in the picture because the center is warped and raised up higher than the sides so the liquid can pool along the edges. I take one of those cheap disposable plastic water bottles with the tiny caps and I drink half of it and then take the air out and molded the bottle to the shape of the fish and then put the lid on with rubber bands. This way there is pressure on the fish. I guess to remove more liquid? I'm not sure, the recipes used things like food cans and wine bottles but I don't think that's practical. Anyways fish packet, water bottle, Tupperware lid, another water bottle on top of the Tupperwareid and some rubber bands to keep it together and to add more pressure and put it in the fridge. \n\n5. I drained it and checked on it every 12 hours. One recipe said 36 hours for medium cure and I think that's the sweet spot. After 24 hours it definitely was cured but not quite enough for me, still had raw texture. If you can't see any salt/sugar on the fish then you need to add more to keep curing it. I dumped out a fair amount of liquid at first and it slowed down each time I checked the fish (once every 12 hours). \n\n6. I filet'ed the meat off the skin and then charred the skin in a toaster oven. I cut up the charred skin to make into crumble to add smokey flavor to the final product without actually have to smoke anything. \n\n7. Bagel, toasted, schmeared with cream cheese, put capers on a plate and then press the cream cheese side into the capers so they don't fall off, add think sliced lax/lox and red onion, squeeze of lemon, fresh dill...

I wouldn't say I am the best at this but I have stretched our food out with my family of weeks without going to the store aside from the occasional milk or sandwich bread. \n\nThese items I like keeping in stock or on hand: Tomato sauce, dried noodles, dried rice, caned cream soup (chicken, potato, mushroom), shredded or block cheese (if I'm desperate I shred my own cheese), tortillas, eggs, bread, broth powder (I have a large container from a local Asian market), canned veggies, boxed stuffing (I make casseroles or crab/ salmon cakes with this), boxed pancake mix (freeze your extra waffles or pancakes), boxed potato flakes (great for thickening soups), curry/ white/ and brown cubes (sure you can make your own curry sauce but the cubes I found at the Asian market are so simple. White/ brown are stew cubes), tortillas, butter, gravy (I buy the gravy packets), bread flour (sometimes I make my own bread as a side with meals\n(Leftover bread is either made into stuffing or chopped into cubes seasoned, baked into croutons and frozen). Many of these I buy on sale. \n\nPrepping can take up a chunk of time but will help in the long term when you are short on time. I try to buy meats on sale. Buy family packs, divide, bag and freeze. Buying whole turkey or chicken when it goes on sale helps. Debone and freeze parts of it for later. Raw hamburg doesnt seem to freeze as well for me so I either make patties, or meatballs and freeze. \n\nVeggies I buy in bulk and freeze. Carrots or celery can be shredded and frozen, added to any dish. Onions or mushrooms can be chopped and frozen. Both lasted me for several months and were only $3-4 for bag. Peppers can be chopped (or cored if you make stuffed peppers). Corn (when in season) can be cut off husk and frozen for meals.You can even freeze bagged spinach if you use it for pasta or soup. Potatoes are different. I make mashed or twice baked and freeze them. Fruits (berries or apples), I buy in season and freeze. Sealed shredded or block cheese and lunch meat can also be frozen. So can sandwich bread, bagels, muffins.\n\nLast tip is shopping. Early morning shopping is great for deals. Eat before you go, look at sales, compare prices. Sit down, make stock of what you have. Try to shop if you are in that area. Budget stores can be great for basics. Make a list and price point. If I'm really in a crunch, I take a calculator so I know I don't go over board. Leave room for taxes if you have them. Also take a look at marked down items and use apps if you can.\n\nLastly, if you cook for yourself or make a large batch of something that you know you can't finish, freeze it. Got that left over bacon that you wont use? Freeze it. Don't force yourself to eat the same thing if you can. Just put it away for another day. Don't throw away money. I hope this helps someone.

{"title": "Dhal: food of the poor or food of the gods?", "selftext": "You cannot get a more budget food than dhal and rice and I would choose it over some really fancy curry a lot of the time.\n\nDahl is so easy and tasty that you will be amazed you have managed to live your life without it. I was!\n\nIn it's simplest form it's just 1 cup dried split lentils to 2.5 or 3 cups water or stock (just a stock cube in hot water; again optional as lentils have nice flavor already).\n\nRed lentils and mung dhal have different flavor, and it's good to try all kinds of dhal. Chickpea is one of my faves but you have to cook it much longer if you want it less chunky. \n\nI forgot to state how important it is to rinse the lentils. Some don't do this, but I was taught to do it till the water runs clear.\n\nYou can cheat that by boiling them for a minute or two, then rinsing, then putting back on with fresh water too.\n\nIf you are using green lentils make sure you pick through them when you are rinsing, as very occassionally there will be a very hard lentil like a stone in there, and you don't want to bite that when you're eating!\n\nNot sure what those are, but I've found a few at times, and they are rock hard. They sink to the bottom of the rinsing bowl and tend to be darker than any other lentils.\n\nAn onion is standard at least in Western dhal versions, and shouldn't really be skipped, but if you don't have one...yeah well. Ideally a chopped onion in there.\n\nYou can also grate in a carrot, or stick in big chunks of it if you like to mix up the texture. Zucchini chunks? Yeah! Why not. Bell peppers? Why not!? Whatever you have.\n\nAdd garam masala (mixed spice) right at the start and cook for 15-30 mins, depending on how hot your stove is and how you like the texture. Some like it smoother, and some like it so you can still see lentil shapes. Your choice. Try both. On a reheat you will get the chance to cook it down more.\n\nThis is also the point to add a chopped fresh chilli, or some chill powder or flakes if you want any heat in it; this is entirely optional.\n\nOnce the water has mostly absorbed you will have to stir it quite frequently and turn the heat right down.\n\nI usually like dhal pretty thick, but your preference might differ.\n\nBefore taking it off the heat, you can stir in a bit more garam masala or spices of choice to your personal tastes and to freshen the spice of the dish.\n\nChillis, chilli powder or curry powder is entirely optional if you don't like hot spice, but I'd recommend some.\n\nServe with long grain rice and you have a tasty filling meal in half an hour.\n\nI think you will be absolutely shocked by how good dhal is considering what it is made of.\n\nI would leave it as simple as that since you are on a budget, but if you can splash out a bit for more luxury, you can add a knob of butter, splash of milk or cream or yogurt or (for pure decadance) coconut milk, all of which can be stirred in right at the end when it's cooling.\n\nGaram masala is the cheap spice option, but you can add ground ginger, ground coriander, ground cumin and a pinch of turmeric (also fenugreek is used to sub for onion if you are following an ayurvedic diet) if you have those things handy and want to try a slightly different flavor profile.\n\nRoasting the seeds yourself and grinding them...yeah ok, it's budget food. The stuff in those little jars and packs is well good enough, but the fresh roasted and milled seeds are next level ;)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1e67iho/dhal_food_of_the_poor_or_food_of_the_gods/", "created_utc": 1721296171.0, "score": 87, "author": "simagus", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1e67iho/dhal_food_of_the_poor_or_food_of_the_gods/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Let's talk about milk", "selftext": "Let's talk about some tips for saving money on milk.  I have some tips to share, and I hope I'll learn some new ones:\n\nBuy half and half instead of milk.  It's fairly inexpensive, it keeps in the fridge much longer than milk, and you can add water to it to make it more like milk.  Really great when you usually only need milk on hand to cook with and therefore go through it very slowly.  The upside is that you have cream on hand to make fabulous sauces and other recipes where cream works better than milk.\n\nFreeze milk you might not use in time.  You can use ice cube trays, though I use my silicone egg bites mold to freeze a large cube of it that's roughly a quarter cup of milk.  Once frozen, I put them all in a labeled bag.  I take out however many needed for a recipe, put them in a glass bowl, and micro them for 30 seconds at a time until melted (or put them in the fridge to thaw the night before, but I never remember).\n\nBuy powdered milk.  When I used to only very occasionally use milk to cook with, I sometimes bought powdered milk to have the ability to have milk on hand at all times without waste.  It's not cheap to buy a box, but it goes a long way and keeps a long time.  It's also good for those that have limited or no options for keeping food cold or for storing frozen extra milk.\n\nIf choosing between types of milk, consider that you can often buy whole milk for the same price as skim.  You can add water to get it to the taste/consistency of skim, 1%, or 2%.  That stretches it, making whole milk a better deal.  It's also more calories for the same cost, which might be a consideration for some.\n\nThat's enough from me.  Do you have any other tips about saving on milk, cream, or plant-based milks (almond, soy, coconut, etc.)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1e14quj/lets_talk_about_milk/", "created_utc": 1720745985.0, "score": 39, "author": "MeeMeeSong", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1e14quj/lets_talk_about_milk/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I live in the South-Eastern part of the United States and the closest grocery stores ( I don\u2019t reliably have a car) are Kroger and Target. \nI\u2019m trying to plan and figure out budget for eating. I have a part time job on campus so I\u2019m slowly making money once August comes. What should I set aside money wise for food? I\u2019m okay not eating 3 meals a day if that helps cut back, as I do intermittent fasting as is. I\u2019m inexperienced with cooking but willing to learn and I am not super picky and am willing to try things but do occasionally struggle with texture, I am also planning on doing meal prepping on the weekend to help with how busy my schedule is.

Y'all were right, her circus, her monkeys. \n\n\nSo a couple of months ago my roommate and his girlfriend decided they were going to throw a small get together at the end of this month.

This crowd - a lot of them are perpetually stoned old hippies and not very responsible for lack of a better word. A lot of them are going to show up without bringing food.

Two packages of chicken, 4 pkgs of bacon, a pkg of ground turkey, four boxes of rotini noodles, three packages of spaghetti noodles, about six cans of diced tomatoes, 4 cans of chickpeas, a couple cans of black beans, a couple cans of corn, a can of peas, a couple cans of cream mushroom soup, 1lb of rice, 2lbs of flour, a giant box of jiffy corn bread mix, and two boxes of Ragu double cheddar sauce, 2 fresh cucumbers and 2 green peppers, a 3lb block of cheddar cheese, salsa, cottage cheese, Italian dressing, ranch dressing and 3 dozen eggs.

I have to walk everyday and would prefer not to have to carry something each day.\n\nThank you for reading. \ud83d\ude4f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1dee81e/any_suggestions_for_cheap_work_lunches/", "created_utc": 1718218025.0, "score": 174, "author": "CommercialWarning271", "num_comments": 200, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1dee81e/any_suggestions_for_cheap_work_lunches/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Bone-in Skin-on Chicken thighs are great on a budget for more than just meat!", "selftext": "Making this post because I had a less-than resouceful friend buy herself the boneless, skinless chicken thighs for way more than she should\u2019ve. These tips also work for different cuts of chicken with skin and bones (though with drumsticks I usually just cook them in soup as-is).\n\nYes, the ones with skin on and bones included are cheaper by weight than the alternative, but if you\u2019ve been just throwing the skin and bones away, stop! I have some budget friendly tips for you. \n\n1) Collect the skin and bones and put them in separate gallon-sized freezer bags. You will be adding to them as you get more chicken. For the skin, keep adding chicken skins and fat to them. For the bag with the bones, you will also want to add veggie scraps such as the skins of onions, garlic, carrots, ginger, and celery. There are others you can add, but if you aren\u2019t familiar with cooking times and qualities of vegetables yet, I\u2019d try to just stick with those. Again, it\u2019s better to use organic veggies or ones sourced from someone you know uses less pesticides when growing as you\u2019re using the skins for this. \n\n2) when you have a good amount of skins(like 3/4lbs or more), make shmaltz (rendered chicken fat). It\u2019s basically the Jewish alternative to lard and tallow. It\u2019s healthier than most cooking oils aside from avocado, olive, and coconut. It has a high smoke point so you can use it to fry, roast, bake, or whatever it is you do with your cooking oils. Because it is animal based, the chemical structure is easier to digest. You might want to steer clear if you have heart problems, though. I used a recipe from Serious Eats which goes like this:\n\n- heat up a saucepan with about a cup of water over medium high heat and put in the chicken skins + fat, stirring occasionally until it starts to boil. \n\n- turn heat down to medium low and continue to stir occasionally until the chicken bits start to turn brown and crispy and the water is evaporated (about 50 minutes). Some people like to add chopped onions around the end for extra flavor. \n\n- filter with a sieve/muslin cloth over a heatproof container. If left in an airtight container in the fridge, sources say you can store from a week until a few months, depending on how secure and refined your shmaltz is after rendering. If you want, you can also snack on the chicken bits as a crispy snack!\n\n3) When you eventually collect enough bones and scraps to fill the ziplock bag, you can make bone broth (or stock, for the anti-hippies). I sometimes add pork bones if I get any with my meat. I make mine in an instant pot so I\u2019m going to use that recipe. \n\n- Dump contents of stock bag into instant pot and cover with water (filtered is best). You can also add aromatics like bay leaf and peppercorns in, though some people like to drink it like a tea, so you could omit. \n\n- Set to high pressure for 1.5 hours. Natural release (just don\u2019t touch it til the pressure indicator falls down). \n\n- Filter with a sieve to a separate container and not your sink! You can freeze portions for later. Salt to taste. \n\nBone broth(stock) is really good for your bones and adds a really nice flavor to whatever you use it for. Consider using it instead of store-bought stock or Better than Bouillon. You can use it for a healthy egg-drop soup. Supposedly some people use it in smoothies, but personally that\u2019s not for me!\n\nI like to get the crunchier packs of chicken when I can afford to (think free-range, organic, locally sourced), and if you have the means to, you should too since you can utilize all parts of the cut. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetfood/comments/1csbx0l/bonein_skinon_chicken_thighs_are_great_on_a/", "created_utc": 1715745736.0, "score": 36, "author": "ejrole8", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/budgetfood/comments/1csbx0l/bonein_skinon_chicken_thighs_are_great_on_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
