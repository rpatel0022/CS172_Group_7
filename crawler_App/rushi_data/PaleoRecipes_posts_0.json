{"title": "Game changer: spiced blueberry fig \"barbecue\" sauce", "selftext": "I've tried different paleo barbecue sauce recipes, and been woefully disappointed by ech and everyone.  Nothing could capture that sweet and spicy tennessee style barbecue essence.  There is a popular local Q joint that does its own, very different, but very popular sauce.  It is dark, and spicy, and as delicious as it is mysterious.  \n\nInspired by their recipe, I came up with my own loose recipe-- I put it on ribs and chicken (as a basting sauce for grilling, and a dipping sauce post-cooking) and it was miles better than anything else I've tried. May be a little high in sugar for some, but use whole fruit for some fiber/nutrient benefits.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n* \"a bunch\" of blueberries (I'd guess about 1.5 - 2 cups) \n* a handful of figs (about 1/2 a cup?)\n* water\n* unsweetened applesauce (optional)\n* clove\n* nutmeg\n* cinnamon\n* allspice\n* apple cider vinegar\n* salt/pepper\n* cayenne (optional)\n* fish sauce\n* coconut aminos\n\n\nSimmer blueberries with figs in a small sauce pan with just enough water to almost cover them.  Add a bit of unsweetened applesauce for extra sweetness in you want.  Cook until all fruit is soft and falling apart.  (I suspect that a bit of sweet onion would go well here, I'll try that next time)\n\nMove fruit and liquid to a blender, and blend until completely smooth.  After the long simmer, sauce will be velvety smooth, and a little thick.\n\nReturn to simmer (may need a little more water).  Add spices to your taste-- don't be afraid to go a little light with most of the spices, especially nutmeg and cayenne, but add a little more clove than you want to.  Clove is the important spice here, especially if you are using the sauce with pork. Also, take it easy with the salt, because it will be easy to overpower the sweetness of the sauce.\n\nReduce the sauce until it gets very thick and sweet. I let it simmer for a couple hours. Some of the sauce may try to burn to the sides of your sauce pan.  Stir in vinegar.  Start with about an 8th of a cup, and add more depending on your taste.\n\nAt the end I added a couple dashes of fish sauce and coconut aminos to round out the savory notes of the sauce.  This improved the sauce, but is not so important if you don't have them on hand.\n\nThis recipe is pretty vague, but this was a first try that I thought needed to be shared.  If you need more info, I will try to help, but please give it  try, and I hope you love it as much as we did.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/paleorecipes/comments/2wsj5k/game_changer_spiced_blueberry_fig_barbecue_sauce/", "created_utc": 1424636346.0, "score": 6, "author": "NicoLibris", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/paleorecipes/comments/2wsj5k/game_changer_spiced_blueberry_fig_barbecue_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

These are a delicious, healthy, gooey dessert treat that contains a good amount of protein, no added sugar (unless you add some chocolate), and, best of all, no wheat or flour used. The saltiness of the peanut butter and crepe blend beautifully with the sweetness of the banana and optional chocolate. The crepe is also very pliable, so no worries about the goop breaking out onto your lap (Goop lap is a bad look). \n\n\n**Prep time:** about 20 minutes  \n**Serves:** 2 to 3  \n**Ingredients:**  \n2 eggs  \n1 banana  \nPeanut Butter (about 3 Tbsp.- I use TJ's salted crunchy PB, ingredients are peanuts and salt)  \n1 tsp. Ghee or coconut oil  \n\u00bc cup arrowroot powder (Can be found in bulk section at health food stores)  \n1 tsp. coconut or brown rice flour  \n1 Tbsp. water  \nPinch of salt  \nSprinkle of cinnamon  \nDark chocolate squares (optional)  \n\n\n**Directions:**  \n\n1. Combine the eggs, melted ghee (or coconut oil), and water into a medium sized bowl. Whisk together.  \n\n\n2. Add the arrowroot powder, coconut (or brown rice) flour, and salt into the wet mixture. Beat with a whisk or fork to combine until homogenous.  \n\n3. Add the sliced bananas into the mixture.  \n\n4. Spray or butter a small 8 to 10\" skillet set over medium heat.  \n\n5. Add \u2153 of the crepe & banana mixture into the skillet. Let cook on each side about 1 minute, or until slightly golden brown. Repeat this step 2 times to make a total of 3 crepes.  \n\n6. Place the hot crepes on a plate. Put about 1 Tbsp. worth of peanut butter onto one half side of each crepe.  \n\n7. Place some optional dark chocolate squares into the PB crepes. The heat from the crepes will melt the PB and chocolate together. Now we're talkin'!  \n\n8. Roll the crepes starting from the peanut butter side and work toward the end.  \n\n9. Sprinkle cinnamon on top of crepes.  \n\n10.

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\n2. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\n3. In a large bowl, mix your almond flour, protein powder (if using), cacao powder, Chaga, and salt.\\*\n4. Add the almond butter and softened coconut oil. If needed, add a bit of water to help the batter stick together \u2013 but it shouldn\u2019t be too sticky. If you accidentally add too much and the batter is sticky, just stick in the refrigerator for 5 minutes to make it easier to work with.\n5. Before rolling out your dough, taste it and adjust the sweetness level to your preference. If you want it sweeter, add your favorite sweetener.\n6. Roll dough between two sheets of wax paper until about 1/4\u201d in thickness.\n7. Use a cookie cutter (or mason jar lid, or rim of a glass) to cut about 12 circles. (Number of circles will vary depending on the size of your cookie cutter.)\n8. Bake on a lined cookie sheet for 10-12 minutes.\n9. Let the cookies cool before you touch them or apply the icing.\n10. Once the cookies have cooled, place a large spoonful of softened coconut butter on half of the baked cookies. Smoosh the other half of the cookies on top and enjoy!!\n11. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days. Or alternatively, freeze them if you want to keep them longer.\n\nFull video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubsMrEdGy5o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubsMrEdGy5o)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/paleorecipes/comments/lgbviv/oreo_cookies_with_real_ingredients_mushrooms/", "created_utc": 1612900518.0, "score": 1, "author": "realmushrooms", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/paleorecipes/comments/lgbviv/oreo_cookies_with_real_ingredients_mushrooms/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Game changer: spiced blueberry fig \"barbecue\" sauce", "selftext": "I've tried different paleo barbecue sauce recipes, and been woefully disappointed by ech and everyone.  Nothing could capture that sweet and spicy tennessee style barbecue essence.  There is a popular local Q joint that does its own, very different, but very popular sauce.  It is dark, and spicy, and as delicious as it is mysterious.  \n\nInspired by their recipe, I came up with my own loose recipe-- I put it on ribs and chicken (as a basting sauce for grilling, and a dipping sauce post-cooking) and it was miles better than anything else I've tried. May be a little high in sugar for some, but use whole fruit for some fiber/nutrient benefits.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n* \"a bunch\" of blueberries (I'd guess about 1.5 - 2 cups) \n* a handful of figs (about 1/2 a cup?)\n* water\n* unsweetened applesauce (optional)\n* clove\n* nutmeg\n* cinnamon\n* allspice\n* apple cider vinegar\n* salt/pepper\n* cayenne (optional)\n* fish sauce\n* coconut aminos\n\n\nSimmer blueberries with figs in a small sauce pan with just enough water to almost cover them.  Add a bit of unsweetened applesauce for extra sweetness in you want.  Cook until all fruit is soft and falling apart.  (I suspect that a bit of sweet onion would go well here, I'll try that next time)\n\nMove fruit and liquid to a blender, and blend until completely smooth.  After the long simmer, sauce will be velvety smooth, and a little thick.\n\nReturn to simmer (may need a little more water).  Add spices to your taste-- don't be afraid to go a little light with most of the spices, especially nutmeg and cayenne, but add a little more clove than you want to.  Clove is the important spice here, especially if you are using the sauce with pork. Also, take it easy with the salt, because it will be easy to overpower the sweetness of the sauce.\n\nReduce the sauce until it gets very thick and sweet. I let it simmer for a couple hours. Some of the sauce may try to burn to the sides of your sauce pan.  Stir in vinegar.  Start with about an 8th of a cup, and add more depending on your taste.\n\nAt the end I added a couple dashes of fish sauce and coconut aminos to round out the savory notes of the sauce.  This improved the sauce, but is not so important if you don't have them on hand.\n\nThis recipe is pretty vague, but this was a first try that I thought needed to be shared.  If you need more info, I will try to help, but please give it  try, and I hope you love it as much as we did.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/paleorecipes/comments/2wsj5k/game_changer_spiced_blueberry_fig_barbecue_sauce/", "created_utc": 1424636346.0, "score": 7, "author": "NicoLibris", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/paleorecipes/comments/2wsj5k/game_changer_spiced_blueberry_fig_barbecue_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

These are a delicious, healthy, gooey dessert treat that contains a good amount of protein, no added sugar (unless you add some chocolate), and, best of all, no wheat or flour used. The saltiness of the peanut butter and crepe blend beautifully with the sweetness of the banana and optional chocolate. The crepe is also very pliable, so no worries about the goop breaking out onto your lap (Goop lap is a bad look). \n\n\n**Prep time:** about 20 minutes  \n**Serves:** 2 to 3  \n**Ingredients:**  \n2 eggs  \n1 banana  \nPeanut Butter (about 3 Tbsp.- I use TJ's salted crunchy PB, ingredients are peanuts and salt)  \n1 tsp. Ghee or coconut oil  \n\u00bc cup arrowroot powder (Can be found in bulk section at health food stores)  \n1 tsp. coconut or brown rice flour  \n1 Tbsp. water  \nPinch of salt  \nSprinkle of cinnamon  \nDark chocolate squares (optional)  \n\n\n**Directions:**  \n\n1. Combine the eggs, melted ghee (or coconut oil), and water into a medium sized bowl. Whisk together.  \n\n\n2. Add the arrowroot powder, coconut (or brown rice) flour, and salt into the wet mixture. Beat with a whisk or fork to combine until homogenous.  \n\n3. Add the sliced bananas into the mixture.  \n\n4. Spray or butter a small 8 to 10\" skillet set over medium heat.  \n\n5. Add \u2153 of the crepe & banana mixture into the skillet. Let cook on each side about 1 minute, or until slightly golden brown. Repeat this step 2 times to make a total of 3 crepes.  \n\n6. Place the hot crepes on a plate. Put about 1 Tbsp. worth of peanut butter onto one half side of each crepe.  \n\n7. Place some optional dark chocolate squares into the PB crepes. The heat from the crepes will melt the PB and chocolate together. Now we're talkin'!  \n\n8. Roll the crepes starting from the peanut butter side and work toward the end.  \n\n9. Sprinkle cinnamon on top of crepes.  \n\n10.

{"title": "Game changer: spiced blueberry fig \"barbecue\" sauce", "selftext": "I've tried different paleo barbecue sauce recipes, and been woefully disappointed by ech and everyone.  Nothing could capture that sweet and spicy tennessee style barbecue essence.  There is a popular local Q joint that does its own, very different, but very popular sauce.  It is dark, and spicy, and as delicious as it is mysterious.  \n\nInspired by their recipe, I came up with my own loose recipe-- I put it on ribs and chicken (as a basting sauce for grilling, and a dipping sauce post-cooking) and it was miles better than anything else I've tried. May be a little high in sugar for some, but use whole fruit for some fiber/nutrient benefits.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\n* \"a bunch\" of blueberries (I'd guess about 1.5 - 2 cups) \n* a handful of figs (about 1/2 a cup?)\n* water\n* unsweetened applesauce (optional)\n* clove\n* nutmeg\n* cinnamon\n* allspice\n* apple cider vinegar\n* salt/pepper\n* cayenne (optional)\n* fish sauce\n* coconut aminos\n\n\nSimmer blueberries with figs in a small sauce pan with just enough water to almost cover them.  Add a bit of unsweetened applesauce for extra sweetness in you want.  Cook until all fruit is soft and falling apart.  (I suspect that a bit of sweet onion would go well here, I'll try that next time)\n\nMove fruit and liquid to a blender, and blend until completely smooth.  After the long simmer, sauce will be velvety smooth, and a little thick.\n\nReturn to simmer (may need a little more water).  Add spices to your taste-- don't be afraid to go a little light with most of the spices, especially nutmeg and cayenne, but add a little more clove than you want to.  Clove is the important spice here, especially if you are using the sauce with pork. Also, take it easy with the salt, because it will be easy to overpower the sweetness of the sauce.\n\nReduce the sauce until it gets very thick and sweet. I let it simmer for a couple hours. Some of the sauce may try to burn to the sides of your sauce pan.  Stir in vinegar.  Start with about an 8th of a cup, and add more depending on your taste.\n\nAt the end I added a couple dashes of fish sauce and coconut aminos to round out the savory notes of the sauce.  This improved the sauce, but is not so important if you don't have them on hand.\n\nThis recipe is pretty vague, but this was a first try that I thought needed to be shared.  If you need more info, I will try to help, but please give it  try, and I hope you love it as much as we did.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/paleorecipes/comments/2wsj5k/game_changer_spiced_blueberry_fig_barbecue_sauce/", "created_utc": 1424636346.0, "score": 6, "author": "NicoLibris", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/paleorecipes/comments/2wsj5k/game_changer_spiced_blueberry_fig_barbecue_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

These are a delicious, healthy, gooey dessert treat that contains a good amount of protein, no added sugar (unless you add some chocolate), and, best of all, no wheat or flour used. The saltiness of the peanut butter and crepe blend beautifully with the sweetness of the banana and optional chocolate. The crepe is also very pliable, so no worries about the goop breaking out onto your lap (Goop lap is a bad look). \n\n\n**Prep time:** about 20 minutes  \n**Serves:** 2 to 3  \n**Ingredients:**  \n2 eggs  \n1 banana  \nPeanut Butter (about 3 Tbsp.- I use TJ's salted crunchy PB, ingredients are peanuts and salt)  \n1 tsp. Ghee or coconut oil  \n\u00bc cup arrowroot powder (Can be found in bulk section at health food stores)  \n1 tsp. coconut or brown rice flour  \n1 Tbsp. water  \nPinch of salt  \nSprinkle of cinnamon  \nDark chocolate squares (optional)  \n\n\n**Directions:**  \n\n1. Combine the eggs, melted ghee (or coconut oil), and water into a medium sized bowl. Whisk together.  \n\n\n2. Add the arrowroot powder, coconut (or brown rice) flour, and salt into the wet mixture. Beat with a whisk or fork to combine until homogenous.  \n\n3. Add the sliced bananas into the mixture.  \n\n4. Spray or butter a small 8 to 10\" skillet set over medium heat.  \n\n5. Add \u2153 of the crepe & banana mixture into the skillet. Let cook on each side about 1 minute, or until slightly golden brown. Repeat this step 2 times to make a total of 3 crepes.  \n\n6. Place the hot crepes on a plate. Put about 1 Tbsp. worth of peanut butter onto one half side of each crepe.  \n\n7. Place some optional dark chocolate squares into the PB crepes. The heat from the crepes will melt the PB and chocolate together. Now we're talkin'!  \n\n8. Roll the crepes starting from the peanut butter side and work toward the end.  \n\n9. Sprinkle cinnamon on top of crepes.  \n\n10. Have a foodgasm without the guilt.  \n\n\n\n**Pictures of final product:**  \n\n[1](http://i.imgur.com/5jb4pCN.jpg)\n\n[2](http://i.imgur.com/gJMZOOZ.jpg)  \n\n**Nutritional Facts:**  \n\nServing Size: 1 crepe (without chocolate)  \n\nFat: 14g  \n\nCarbs: 24g  \n\nProtein: 9g", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/paleorecipes/comments/2cwmki/sweet_and_savory_flourless_wheatless_banana_and/", "created_utc": 1407435897.0, "score": 1, "author": "twtwtwtwtwtwtw", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/paleorecipes/comments/2cwmki/sweet_and_savory_flourless_wheatless_banana_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
