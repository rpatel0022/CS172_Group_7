I have not flushed the sediment from my hot water heater since I bought the house in 2022, so today\u2019s the day. \nI turned off the power (it\u2019s electric - boogie-woogie-woogie), hooked up the hose, put the other end of the hose in the floor drain, turned off the cold water feed, opened the hot water faucet in the nearby utility sink. Once the sink ran cold, I opened the drain valve. It drained nicely. I saw a little discoloration, but nothing major Major. Once it was done draining, I got adventurous and decided to check the anode rod.\nI pried open the plastic cap and dug out the foam insulation with a screwdriver. Once I got down to the rod, I checked the fit of the 11/16\u201d socket it said to use in the manual. It wouldn\u2019t fit. I looked down in the hole, and saw it was definitely bigger than 11/16\u201d. I Googled, and it said many anodes are 1-1/16\u201d. So I went to Home Depot and bought a 1-1/16\u201d socket. It wasn\u2019t until I got home that I realized it wouldn\u2019t fit on my 3/8\u201d socket wrench. Back to Home Depot and bought a $30 1/2\u201d socket wrench. Got home and tried to turn the rod, but the socket wasn\u2019t quite long enough to get enough leverage to turn it. Decided the rod was probably fine. Put the cover back on and cracked a beer.

In the basement are the guts of the house (water heater etc) washer and dryer. I wouldn't do anything fancy.

{"title": "How to make a covered patio structure/gazebo that can easily convert to sunroom and then have the walls removed again?", "selftext": "Hi all! I'm wondering if anyone here has ideas on how to do this, because I've searched the internet and can't seem to find what I'm looking for. I want to add some kind of gazebo/pergola/covered patio area in our backyard that doesn't have any walls to it, just the pillars to hold it up. There are a million of these you can buy from home depot, costco, and a ton of other online retailers, and these would be great for the summer.\n\nHowever, I would love to be able to extend how much of the year we can be outside by being able to convert it into a sunroom as it starts to get cooler in the fall (or starts to barely warm up in the spring), by having big window panels that I could put up on all four walls and then have a space heater inside, etc. It wouldn't need to be fully sealed\u2014I don't expect to be able to use it in the dead of winter and still be warm in there\u2014but I would like to be able to use it on a chillier fall or spring day and be outdoors more often, without being boiled to death and having it be unusable when it's 100 degrees outside in the summer.\n\nThere are also lots of sunroooms available for purchase that can be assembled in just a day or two, but from what I can tell from my online research, they seem to be designed to not be taken apart once they're built\u2014everything is screwed together pretty permanently and it would be a multi-person, multi-day operation to remove the walls, and possibly would result in damage to the structure.\n\nIs there a product I'm missing, and/or something that we could cobble together?

I have attached a [layout ](https://imgur.com/a/TZmROYe)of the rooms in case it helps visualize.

The hardwood shown in those other two bedrooms is going to stay, but the hardwood does continue under the carpeted areas.  The bathroom has linoleum now but will be replaced with tile.  I mention all this to give an idea of the different levels of flooring.  So first of all, before any flooring is replaced, I am thinking I need to install the new prehung doors.  For the 3 bedrooms, since the hardwood is under everything and will be the same level, that will be easy to just install them all the way down to sit on the hardwood.  With the bathroom (which is being remodeled with tile), I think I need to put in the door before they put in the tile, because If I do it afterwards, the tile in the bathroom will be higher than the hardwood in the hall, so I am not sure how that would work.

Am I correct in installing the door here first so it sits on level ground?\n\n  \nOnce the bathroom is finished, I will paint the living room, hall, and master (the other two bedrooms don't need to be painted), including the ceilings, and not care about making a mess because the carpet will be replaced.  I am going to be putting all new baseboards in so I will remove the old ones before I paint everything, and then once the old carpet is removed and new one in place, I will install new baseboards and finish casing the doors.  I figure to put a coat of paint on the baseboards and trim before installing them, and then touching up the nail holes after I install them.  Does this all sound like the correct order?

The squirrels chewed some holes in the fascia boards in multiple places/eaves of the house to get inside.  **We set up a squirrel trap** with peanutbutter & birdseed bait (my grandpa swears by this combo) in the attic **but have not caught any squirrels** in the three years that we have tried to bait them to remove them.  **We do hear the squirrels sometimes** scurrying up there so we know they're still semi-active, but we can't seem to trap (or shoot) the darned things.

{"title": "Asphalt to Concrete wall sealing", "selftext": "1). I rent. Major renovations are not possible. Lets just get that out of the way first.\n\nThere is an asphalt pad under and next to our deck in the back yard. It has sunk about 2\" and now the basement is leaking, just from beside the water spigot to the edge of the asphalt. The area was previously sealed by a company building a 45\\* angle of small rocks and sealing the resulting face with some kind of rubberized pavement/asphalt seal. The sinking has opened a crack that ranges from 1/4\" to over 1.5\" in the small rocks. I did my best to clear out the rocks/dirt/etc from this area and could see about 1.5\" of dirt between the house wall and the edge of the asphalt, about 2\" below the top of the asphalt. I could also see the edge of a plastic sheeting material, pulled away from the wall by at least 1\" with dirt on all sides. I stuffed some heat-activated asphalt sealant into the cracks and melted as directed. It appeared to work for the lighter rains (less than 1/2\" total) but when we then had a heavier ran (over an inch in about 12 hours) it leaked again. I suspect that the product did not actually fill all of the crack, this was my first time using anything like this.\n\nOn the INSIDE of the basement, it's semi-finished, with the only fully built out area being the closet that appears to be the location of the leak. The walls have thick stucco coating, so i can't see what the concrete looks like under them, there is a 2 foot or so area that has spalling of the stucco, so I know that some moisture is coming in there. At the floor level, I can't see the joint/bottom of the wall due to the combination of wood edging, 2x4 framing members and that d\\*mn stucco. I can tell that the water is coming in at the bottom, and being \"sucked\" along the 2x4s that frame the closet and laundry room into the rest of the basement, with a limited amount passing under the tiles in the laundry room to the drain. There is no french drain, sump pump, or other internal water directing system. \n\nI'm willing to put enough work into this to keep my stuff from being destroyed (already lost two particle board bookcases, but those things suck anyway), but I'm not going to do thousands in work, and the owner has already indicated that he is not in a position to fix anything right now (plus the deck is only 2 years old...he's not ripping it out to get the asphalt along the wall....). \n\nStandard items like fixing the downspouts (already directing away from the house, no blockages, etc) and ensuring the grade is right (despite the sinking in the asphalt, water still runs away from the wall if you poor it on the ground) have already been done.\n\nShould I dig out what I tried to fix the wall with, put in a new angled small rock connection point, and reseal with something similar to what was used previously? It lasted about 5 years before the leaking returned. Or do you have another suggestion for sealing such a small surface area? (pictures will be added this evening, I'm at work currently)\n\nIs it worth removing the stucco and painting the interior wall with waterproofing? \n\nShould I rip out the damn framing and edging so I can at least see the bottom of the wall/joint? \n\nOther notes: We have a dehumidifier that is always set up, usually it is 40-50% humidity and runs intermittently. I keep fans and a heavy duty vacuum handy for any water removal that might be needed, dry everything as fast as possible once leakage does occur, treat for mold after it's dry, etc. We have been here for about 9 years, and I would be fine with never moving, my spouse wants to find a new place in the next 2 years for reasons entirely unrelated to the quality of the rental (which is actually quite nice and reasonably priced). \n\nI'm only interested in the best DIY repairs for this crack and leakage, that won't cost thousands.

{"title": "What's the best method for waterproofing plywood under concrete?", "selftext": "We are remodeling our pool deck that's going to be 2.5\" concrete poured over a plywood base. Originally the plan was to treat the wood with sealant and then also lay plastic sheeting over it for an additional barrier.

{"title": "Cat Door Staircase Conundrum", "selftext": "Hi all, I'm hoping for some ideas. We just had new doors installed in our house; one at the top of our basement stairs, which do not have a landing (https://imgur.com/a/VH5hLdf). Our contractor put a cat door in for us, but it had to be installed high up in that decorative panel area so it didn't mess with the integrity of the door. Unfortunately, this makes the cat door unusuable--especially for my arthritic cat. Had I known this limitation before, we wouldn't have gone this route (I wasn't there when it was put in).\n\nSo, any ideas for something creative I could do to provide a platform, ramp, or way of getting to the door more easily? I'm thinking of a carpeted platform that's corner shaped, starts where the hinge side of the door meets the basement wall, and comes out to meet the opposite edge of the cat door, positioned right at the bottom of it. That way they can jump from the top step to the platform and come out, and it's out of the way for people going up and down. \n\nAny ideas--explained to me like I'm a toddler--are much appreciated", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfjo01/cat_door_staircase_conundrum/", "created_utc": 1746471281.0, "score": 2, "author": "BuffyTheEggPileLayer", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1kfjo01/cat_door_staircase_conundrum/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
