{"title": "What should I order/expect/take note of at a high end French restaurant?", "selftext": "Hello all. I've been trying to get into the food writing game, and have been getting practice by visiting restaurants and writing up my thoughts on them. Recently I've gotten an opportunity to hit a French restaurant well above my usual means (Le Chat Noir in Riverside, CA, if anyone is curious). I'm relatively clueless about French cuisine, and especially uninformed about the higher end aspects of it, so I'm looking for some general advice in terms of what I should expect, what might be most interesting to order/write about, and what sort of things I should look out for as indicators of quality or lack thereof. Any other advice that doesn't fit the above would also be appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchfood/comments/7tw8vi/what_should_i_orderexpecttake_note_of_at_a_high/", "created_utc": 1517265602.0, "score": 1, "author": "WhiskeySarabande", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/frenchfood/comments/7tw8vi/what_should_i_orderexpecttake_note_of_at_a_high/", "html_title": ""}
