{"title": "Peugeot u'select pepper mill disassembly", "selftext": "As I couldn't find anything on the internet about this, I'll post it here.\nIn my case, I wanted to remove the coarseness selection ring in order to fix a crack.\n\nIn order to take the ring off, you'll need to remove the whole grinding mechanism. See green arrow in the second figure.\n- First, remove the lid from the mill. This frees up the mechanism from above.\n- Then remove the white plastic ring inside the mill. It just pulls out with a pair of pliers. This should help you to move the shaft back and forth. The top should look like the third picture.\n- Now comes the tricky part. The grinding mechanism snaps into a rubber ring on the bottom of the main body. See figure 4. Nice the shaft back and forth to see where these screws are.\n- When you know where the screws are, move the shaft sideways. This should create a gap between the adjustment ring and the main body. Carefully prise the plastic grinding mechanism from the rubber ring. The interface is shown in figure 5. (I took the adjustment ring off because it was already broken. This is not possible if it's not broken.)\n- Now you should have freed the grinding mechanism and you can see the tabs that lock into the rubber ring (6th photo).\n\nNow you can clean it out or fix something, like I did. I would advise against removing the shaft from the grinder. It is fixed in place with a snap ring (blue arrow), that snaps into grooves. If you remove it, you'll likely need to replace it, because it is bent or broken. Also the whole adjustment mechanism is plastic that is snapped together. It's best to leave it alone.\n\nTo reassemble:\n- Re-install the plastic ring in the top of the body. Make sure that the small hole for the shaft is on the bottom, otherwise the kid won't fit.\n- Make sure to mark the position of the ring so that the coarseness marks line up with the mark on the body.\n- Slide the adjustment ring over the top of the grinding mechanism, in the correct orientation!\n- Slide the mechanism into the body and make sure the shaft fires through the small hole in the white plastic ring.\n- Line up the tabs on the mechanism with the pockets in the rubber ring in the main body.\n- Then push on the grinding mechanism to snap it into place. Do not push on the wooden selector ring.\n- Check that it's seated on all sides. The gap should be even all around.\n- Fill with pepper and install the lid.\n\nI hope this helps someone!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15veif2", "created_utc": 1692446729.0, "score": 22, "author": "Verfblikje", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/KitchenTools/comments/15veif2/peugeot_uselect_pepper_mill_disassembly/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "The Best Stainless Steel Cookware: Legend, All-Clad, or Made In?", "selftext": "I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who has looked at a thousand cookware sets and thought, 'Is this THE one?' So, I went down a rabbit hole and dug out reviews for each of them. I\u2019ve listed what I found from my research to help anyone who is in the same boat as me\nFirst things first, what should one look for when buying stainless steel cookware, here are the must-have features to consider:\n\n1. Multi-Ply Construction: Look for cookware with at least 3-ply or 5-ply construction. The layers ensure even heat distribution, preventing hot spots and improving cooking efficiency.\n\n\n\n2. Induction Compatibility: If you have an induction cooktop, make sure the cookware is induction-compatible. This allows for optimal heat transfer and energy efficiency.\n\n\n\n3. Oven and Broiler Safe: Cookware that can handle high oven temperatures (up to 500\u00b0F or more) offers versatility, allowing you to seamlessly move from stovetop to oven.\n\n\n\n4. Ergonomic, Heat-Resistant Handles: Handles that stay cool during cooking and are ergonomically designed make it easier and safer to handle your pots and pans. \nDishwasher Safe: While stainless steel is easy to clean, some sets are dishwasher safe for extra convenience.\n\n5. Durability and Lifetime Warranty: Choose cookware that\u2019s built to last, preferably with a warranty, so you\u2019re investing in long-term quality.\n\n\n\n| Brand            | Pros                                   | Cons                                           |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Legend Cookware | 5 Ply construction, Induction compatible and versatile | Handles can get hot during extended cooking times |\n| All-Clad D3    | 3 Ply construction, Oven and broiler safe | Some pans tend to become wobbly after a while |\n| Made In Cookware | 5 Ply heat control, Stay cool handles | A little heavy                                |\n\n\nPRICE COMPARISON:\n\n- [Legend Cookware](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B09HN3Q81F) -  $550\n- Made In Cookware - 10 Piece Stainless Steel Pot and Pan Set - $799 \n- All-Clad D3 3-Ply Stainless Steel Cookware Set 14 Piece - $1299\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nAfter reviewing all the products, I believe legend provides the greatest value for the price. \n\nLet me know if this was helpful?

Ever.**\n\nNot only does it save me from the whole \u201cpour, blend, transfer back\u201d mess but it also gives me way more control over texture. There\u2019s actual research on this- immersion blenders allow for more precise emulsification (great for sauces) and better aeration (hello perfectly fluffy whipped cream).

{"title": "The Knife That Will Take Your Kitchen Game from Meh to Michelin", "selftext": "Alright, fellow kitchen warriors, we\u2019ve all been there. You\u2019re in the heat of service, slicing, dicing, chopping, and your knife feels more like a liability than a tool. It slips, it dulls, it\u2019s not cutting it\u2014literally. So how do you upgrade from the dull, mediocre knives that are ruining your flow?\n\nAfter spending hours on r/TrueChefKnives and r/ChefKnives\u00a0 (yes, I\u2019m obsessed), I\u2019ve pieced together the key features that separate a GREAT chef\u2019s knife from the ones that leave you fighting for your life on the line. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s not the shiny ones with \u201csuper titanium\u201d in the name. (Yes, I\u2019m looking at you, gimmicky kitchen gadgets.)\n\nSo, if you\u2019re tired of struggling through your shift with a knife that\u2019s more hassle than help, here are five must-have features you should be looking for in a serious chef\u2019s knife:\n\n**1. Sharpness** \u2013 If your knife isn't sharp enough to breeze through proteins without a fight, it\u2019s not worth your time. Precision is everything.\u00a0\n\n**2. Comfortable Handle** \u2013 You\u2019re holding this thing for hours on end. Your knife should feel like a natural extension of your arm\u2014not something that gives you cramps after a few minutes.\n\n\u00a0**3. Full Tang** \u2013 Strength, balance, and control. If you want durability that can handle the pressure of a high-paced kitchen, a full tang is essential.\n\n\u00a0**4. Durability** \u2013 This knife needs to survive everything\u2014from daily prep to the chaos of rush hour. It has to keep up with you, not the other way around.\n\n\u00a0**5. Versatility** \u2013 A great chef\u2019s knife should do it all. From fine slicing to heavy-duty work, it\u2019s gotta be flexible enough for anything you throw at it.\n\nNow, let me introduce you to the game-changer: the[ LEGEND COOKWARE Premium 8\u201d German Steel Chef Knife](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0CMFBMBD7). After putting this beauty to the test, I\u2019m telling you\u2014it checks all the boxes for a pro kitchen tool.\n\n**Here\u2019s why this knife is a must-have for any chef working the line:**\n\n1. **Razor-Sharp Edge** \u2013 Seriously, this thing cuts like a dream. I\u2019ve never had a knife go from onion to brisket without even breaking a sweat. Efficiency? Check.\n2. **G10 Ergonomic Handle** \u2013 You know the feeling when your knife just fits? No slippage, no strain, just pure comfort all shifts long.\n3. **Full Tang Construction** \u2013 Built to last. It\u2019s strong, it\u2019s solid, and it can handle the madness of a busy kitchen. No more worrying about a knife falling apart mid-chop.\n4. **Versatile Performance** \u2013 From fine slicing to breaking down tough cuts of meat, this knife does it all. Do you need a one-stop-shop for your knife work? This is it.\n\nIf you\u2019re tired of knives that can\u2019t keep up with your pace, it\u2019s time for an upgrade. This knife is built for the grind and delivers every time, from the first cut to the last. Don\u2019t let a bad knife hold you [back.So](http://back.So), if you\u2019re ready to step up your knife game and slice like a pro, you know what to do.
