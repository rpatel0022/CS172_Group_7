{"title": "Found a whole set of filthy keys buried in my takeout container! ", "selftext": "Hey everyone, \n\nNeed some advice on what to do here\u2026 \nSo, last night I ordered fried rice takeout from a PF Chang restaurant ate some then put it in the fridge. Today I started feeling a bit off\u2014GI issues and all that. Didn\u2019t think much of it at first, just assumed it was a random case of my stomach staging a rebellion. Fast forward to this evening: I still felt kind of sick but, being the optimist (or maybe just hungry), I decided to reheat the leftovers.\n\nThat\u2019s when things took a turn for the weird. My microwave suddenly caught on fire. Yes, fire. I pulled the container out, understandably confused, and what do I find? A whole set of absolutely filthy keys buried in my rice. Like, not a fortune cookie, not a sauce packet\u2014keys. One even had a label that said \u201cfreezer,\u201d and the kicker? There was a laminated card attached that said P.F. Chang\u2019s. So yeah, I basically got a side of some employees kitchen key collection with my meal.\n\nNow, I\u2019m horrified (and pretty grossed out) that these filthy keys may have been the reason behind my newfound GI issues.

Department heads brother(the one who contaminated pico) hid the room temperature salad cart. I went and grabbed it and he came up to me and was like hey my brother said to throw this away. I said no I\u2019m gonna go show the inspector and ask him. Department manager and inspector were talking when I walked up and showed him and asked him and told him what we do. He said it\u2019s a no go to leave it out for more than 4 hours. I proceeded to tell him we wheel it out at 7am or so and it sits till maybe 7:30-8 at night. Every day. The Inspector said how Incorrect it was and told my boss to throw it all away after he counted it. Cart has maybe 25-30 salads in there. Should of seen my department heads face. His eyes were bugging out he was so mad. I overheard him and the store manager saying it had to be me or my other coworker who called the health department.\n\nLater when he came back from his report my boss was on lunch and he asked me a few things about the shrimp and if I\u2019ve seen him pour bleach water into the cooler ventilation systems directly next to fresh fruit, I told him yes and he left again to add to his report lol. My boss isn\u2019t talking to me anymore and when he does he\u2019s aggressive in telling me what to do.\n\n\nToday my store manager looked troubled all day and pulled me into his office.

I told him I can\u2019t confirm the health department showing up and that it wasn\u2019t me.\n\nAfter the meeting in the office another co worker(who was attacked by our department managers sister last summer off the clock In the employee parking lot in which I was the sole witness and we went to the police and got his sister let go and she was taken to court) told me the department manager has been saying a lot of bad things about me and calls me \u201cthe n*gger\u201d and \u201cthe negro\u201d aka the black in Spanish. I\u2019ve faced racial harassment from him before and his brother and went to the previous owner years ago about it and nothing happened.\n\nI explained to the store manager about the pico and shrimp and how it\u2019s wrong etc and that my GF is severely allergic to seafood and she could of been killed since my mom and her both shop here.. also how he bleached the pico and how that\u2019s felony poisoning and he agreed and said he\u2019ll stand up for me if he does it again. My co worker that told me today about the racial stuff said he can\u2019t get rid of me but may throw heavy jobs at me.

We share a back room where they prep food and where the bathrooms are. We are required to go back there to throw away garbage since we share the door that leads to the ally. \n\nThe stuff I see and smell back there is horrible. I\u2019ve seen them leave bread sitting overnight with little flies all over it, rice sitting out with visible black spots which are either the flies or their poop. This morning was my final straw, I go back there to see 3 boxes of chicken sitting back there, open, not refrigerated, left over night. I know it was over night because we open an hour and 30 minutes before they do and I always come in early. At 8:45 this morning I saw the chicken left out and recorded it out of pure disgust. \n\nOther than the food issue the flies back there drive me nuts. I have to hold my breath because they detect movement and start flying/swarming everywhere, apparently they got in because someone from the pizzeria accidentally left the ally door open overnight\u2026 \n\nI just wanna know, what\u2019s the best way to report this without it tracing back to me? I have the evidence but I can\u2019t have this traced back since our businesses share a back room and even though the bosses also thinks it\u2019s disgusting they want to keep relations friendly, which obviously wouldn\u2019t happen if it was found that their employee reported the pizzeria.

{"title": "My roommate regularly keeps his rice in a rice cooker on warm setting for as long as 6 days. How dangerous is this behavior?", "selftext": "So the other day, I woke up at 3am hearing my roommate fight for his life in the bathroom (food poisoning). He was throwing up on and off for 3 hours. He believes it wasn't food poisoning, but from eating too fast because he boiled the soup he ate for dinner. But here's the thing: he _regularly_ eats rice that has been sitting in a rice cooker on warm setting for 3+ days. I've gently mentioned it's a risk to him many times, saying that I think it would definitely make me sick, and that I wouldn't do that. He is a bit stubborn, saying he hasn't had a problem with it and has been doing it for years. I know that's true because I see the rice cooker with 60+ hours on the display very often. \n\nNow, the rice he ends up eating is often slightly yellow from sitting there for days. I tell him, you know, I think that yellow is a sign of bacteria. Straight up, light yellow color means bacteria and it's risky to consume that rice. He says it's fine. He always feels fine after eating it this way for years. I don't know how to convince him that the food poisoning he just had very likely came from the rice he had with his meal. I checked the rice cooker. It was at 62 hours. \n\nAm I going crazy, or isn't that like very dangerous? Is it possible for someone to go years without a problem doing this, then to get a problem so suddenly? How dangerous is this for his health? I'm concerned for the guy haha\n\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the comments. Now I'm wondering if it could be one of his other unsafe food habits. His soup was leftover, and I often notice he leaves his soup on the stove top for several hours at room temperature before putting it in the fridge. Would boiling this soup remove the risk? (This man has several unsafe food habits. He also doesn't seem that careful with preparing meat alongside veggies.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1i1qfaf/my_roommate_regularly_keeps_his_rice_in_a_rice/", "created_utc": 1736918438.0, "score": 165, "author": "someoctopus", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1i1qfaf/my_roommate_regularly_keeps_his_rice_in_a_rice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I was disappointed and went to my department and put a sign on the pico that was in a cart in our coooler and wrote \u201cDO NOT PUT ON THE SHELF. CROSS CONTAMINATED WITH SHRIMP SPOON. MAJOR HEALTH RISK ALLERGEN\u201d.  My department manger saw it but didn\u2019t say anything until near the end of the day and told my coworker to mix it into the fresh made guacamole. Coworker asked \u201c what pico should I add to the guacamole and manager said add the \u201ccontaminated pico\u201d into it. In which I replied \u201cyou can\u2019t do that\u201d and my manager didn\u2019t acknowledge me and ignored me but quickly he changed his mind. At the end of the day while my Manager was on the floor I took the cart to the dumpster and disposed of it and clocked out and left immediately. I disposed it in such a way that it would be irretrievable since I threw them against the back of the dumpster and they broke open. I figured I just placed them in the front of the dumpster safely, my manager would surely retrieve them. I am off today and work tomorrow and will probably have an interesting day since the department manger will surely of noticed the missing cart of pico on Saturday evening. \n\nToday I will be sending in a health department complaint not just about this incident but also about him keeping out of date salads at reduced price in a cart not being refrigerated all day and at night they are not always put in the cooler. Temperature fluctuations like that are major risk of promoting pathogens and developing lysteria and e-coli. 2 complaint I will be reporting is when pico is made and the tomatoes are really bad he will bleach the fresh tomatoes while they sit in the sink before they are cut.

{"title": "WTF is r/foodsafety and why is it showing up for me?", "selftext": "Maybe it was the spiked gelatin, maybe it was the dented can, or maybe it was one of the super gross posts.\n\nWhatever it was, you found yourself here at r/foodsafety. \n\nI know, I know. Your first impression is off-putting. Who are these people? Why don't they know a steak that is still mooing and walking is bad? \n\nWell, allow me to explain what you've stumbled onto.\n\nThis is a place for people to post any food safety related question and, preferably, receive little to no judgement and an answer. The users who respond come from a variety of backgrounds including: Auditors, Farmers, vet techs, bakers, fishermen, gardeners, chefs, and many many more. Do we have a group that answers every question? Absolutely not. We leave that up to the users. A lot of times we might have somebody hop in who has direct experience with manufacturing of the product somebody is asking about. For most answers we do ask for some external source, or at least a pretty sound explanation. There are enough users here that do know what they're doing that a bad answer will usually get put down pretty quick.\n\n**Some more questions you may have:**\n\n*Ok, but like, don't people know what's good and bad?*\n\nNot really. Sometimes people never have a hand in preparing their own food, and so when they begin to live on their own they just don't know. Sometimes people are low on funds and they have to start making tough decisions about what they could eat. Sometimes someone is just using an ingredient that is entirely new to them or exotic and all the information they can find online is conflicting.\n\n*Is everyone who posts here a troll?*\n\nI'd guess it's about 5 to 15%. We catch it decent amount of them.\n\n*Are the mods power hungry monsters?*\n\nIt's a food safety sub, everyone here is hungry. Us specifically? Don't really need more power. I actually took over the sub several years ago from an account that just created it to try to sell software. It had a few thousand users, then a few months ago we exploded. I give it my time and energy because I think it's interesting. Sometimes we delete comments that are outright rude or mean because we want the conversation to stay focused on food safety, and not the potato version of Pickle Rick. It's not a power trip. \n\n*Do we really need food safety? Weren't my ancestors fine?*\n\nNo, they understood the risks of food. Food safety has been around for thousands of years. Egyptians boiled water to prevent disease, in the middle age there were bread laws and the first documented case of a foodborne illness causing death is from 323 BCE.\n\n*It feels like everyone here always gives the worst case scenario, why?*\n\nBecause we'd rather the person asking the question get the full view of what could happen than be under some delusion it's perfectly safe. The can **could** contain botulism. The chicken **might** be an unholy mutation. Stealing the last cookie at Christmas **may** cause your siblings to murder you. If we tell the worst then they can make a choice.\n\n*Are people with food anxieties welcome here?*\n\nAre you kidding me? We love you all. Bring those worries and share them with us.\n\n*What's with all the misinformation?*\n\nWe are trying to cut down on it, but we are a small mod team. We cannot check every comment as this is not our full-time job. If we notice the top comment or comments are wrong we will lock the post. Please keep in mind we are human. \n\n*Why do you keep locking posts?*\n\nWhen a question has been answered and the conversation starts devolving into vulgarity or insults we shut it down so we don't have to monitor it anymore. \n\n*My comment was deleted, what do I do?*\n\nMessage the mods, sometimes things are taken down by automod for wording, sometimes we do it and didn't see all the details or assume you were a troll.\n\n*Why did I get banned for saying this sub is stupid?*\n\nIf you don't want to be here, we don't want you here. It's that simple. We ban people because this is not a sub designed around talking about how stupid food safety is, or how stupid people are.\n\n*Are we fear mongering?*\n\nSee the above answer about worst case scenarios. Seriously though, we aren't trying to scare people, and we aren't being overly dramatic. We give what the rules say. If they sound restrictive, well, they can be at times. They aren't ours, they are typically best practices.\n\n*The mods are deleting posts, right?*\n\nNo. Typically we do not delete posts even when they go off the rails. We delete some of we are confident it's a troll. If you interacted with a post and can't find it again, before getting mad at us, please check if your reddit settings are hiding posts you've upvoted or downvoted.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/153ff42/wtf_is_rfoodsafety_and_why_is_it_showing_up_for_me/", "created_utc": 1689726411.0, "score": 83, "author": "Redbaron1701", "num_comments": 42, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/153ff42/wtf_is_rfoodsafety_and_why_is_it_showing_up_for_me/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Botulism FAQ", "selftext": "Any given day on any given food sub, at least one person will inevitably post the frantic question:\u00a0\n\n\u201cI ate some freaky food. Do I have BOTULISM?\u201d\n\nAnd, inevitably, the answer is \u201cno, you don\u2019t.\u201d Frequently, the answer is \u201cthat\u2019s not even remotely how botulism works.\u201d\n\nI get it. I really do. **Botulism is legitimately scary.** It can fuck you up in horrifying ways for life, or kill you in a particularly slow and gruesome manner. But here\u2019s the thing: foodborne botulism is [*exceedingly rare*](https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/php/national-botulism-surveillance/2019.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20health%20departments%20reported,as%20probably%20adult%20intestinal%20colonization) in the developed world.\u00a0\n\n>In 2019, health departments reported 215 cases of botulism to CDC \u2026 The cases were of the following types: 152 (71%) infant, 41 (19%) wound, **21 (10%) foodborne,** and 1 (<1%) other, diagnosed as probably adult intestinal colonization.\n\nSo to reiterate: in the **entire year** of 2019, in the **entire country** of the United Sates of America (pop. 345 million), there were a whopping **twenty one** cases of botulism that people got from eating food.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established how rare it is, let\u2019s answer some frequently asked questions to further establish why you probably don't have botulism.\n\n**What the heck is botulism, anyway?**\n\nBotulism is a disease caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by the bacterium *Clostridium botulinum. C. botulinum* is a spore-former, meaning it creates protective spores to in order to survive in unfavorable environments. The spores themselves are largely harmless, and are found everywhere in the environment. Ingesting *C. bot* spores won't hurt you (unless you're an infant, possibly) \u2014 in order to develop the toxin, you need live (\u201cvegetative\u201d) bacteria and the right conditions.\n\n**So** ***C. bot*** **can grow basically anywhere, right?**\n\nOh, hell no. While the *spores* are found commonly in many environments, it takes **very specific conditions** in order for the vegetative cells to emerge from the spores, multiply, and produce the toxin:\n\n* NO OXYGEN: *C. bot* is anaerobic, meaning it can\u2019t grow in the presence of oxygen.\u00a0\n* LOTS OF MOISTURE: *C. bot* requires high water activity (aw > 0.92) to grow. It can't grow in dry foods, or foods that don't have enough available water.\n* LOW ACIDITY: acid inhibits *C. bot* growth. A pH below 4.6 will prevent it from growing\n* WARMTH: *C. bot* thrives in warm conditions. Below 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) it would take the most cold-tolerant types of C bot a week or more to grow and produce toxin. Below 37.9\u00b0F (3.3\u00b0C), it will not grow at all. Other types of C. bot can\u2019t grow below 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C).\u00a0\n\n**Is it true that eating food from dented cans can give you botulism?**\n\nPossible? Yes. Likely? No.\n\nIt's my personal and professional opinion that the risk of botulism from dented cans is VASTLY overstated in consumer food safety discourse.\u00a0\n\n**By all means**, you should **always** throw away cans with deep, sharp dents, major damage to a seam, heavy rust, or cans that are bulging or bloated or that spurt when you open them. **If** ***C. bot*** **were going to be present in any canned food situation, these are it.**\n\nCommercially canned food is thermally processed to extremely high temperatures in order to destroy *Clostridium botulinum* spores. **There are** **no** **viable spores inside any undamaged can of commercial food produced in the developed world.** However, the concern with dented cans is that a severe dent could compromise the hermetic seal, which could allow microorganisms from the environment to enter the can. Most of the time these would be organisms that cause spoilage that you can see or smell. But there is a *remote* chance that *C. bot* spores could get inside and work their way into a part of the can that is still anaerobic enough (despite the hole) for them to grow and produce toxin.\n\nAgain, this is pretty unlikely. The idea that \u201cdented cans = botulism\u201d is extremely pervasive, but it is **nowhere close** to the most common causes of botulism. Possible? Yes. Likely? No.\n\n**What's the deal with garlic in oil?**\n\nOil creates an anaerobic environment. Oil by itself doesn\u2019t have high enough water activity to support pathogen growth, but if you introduce something wet, it can create a pocket of higher water activity inside the oil. Garlic and fresh herbs are especially good at this because they also tend to carry botulinum spores. As a result, unrefrigerated garlic-in-oil infusions are a common source of botulism. Fortunately, you can solve this problem by storing it in the fridge. And store-bought garlic in oil products are generally acidified to make them shelf stable and inhibit botulinum growth, so it's typically only the homemade stuff you need to worry about.\n\n**I stored my leftovers in a sealed Tupperware or ziplock bag. That\u2019s anaerobic, right?**\n\nNope. When you put on the lid or zipped the seal, you closed air inside with the food. Unless you used a vacuum sealer, that air is still in there. Not anaerobic.\u00a0\n\n**Okay, I get it, it\u2019s rare. But where did those 21 people get botulism then?**\n\nThere are a few very reliable ways to give yourself botulism, and none of them have to do with commercially manufactured food. The majority of cases are due to **improper home canning and preservation techniques**. Things like people hot filling their cans with low-acid food and skipping the processing step. Or sketchy, unrefrigerated homemade garlic infusions. Or inadequately preserved fish or marine mammal meat (this is a big one - a huge % of US botulism cases happen in Alaska Native communities).\n\n**In summary, it's pretty easy not to get botulism. Conversely, it is pretty damn hard to get botulism. I hope folks find this informative!**\n\nEdit: as u/Ippus_21 pointed out, botulism is only one specific kind of foodborne illness. There are many others that are much easier to get, so practicing safe food handling is still very important!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1g5jkhi/botulism_faq/", "created_utc": 1729142541.0, "score": 49, "author": "sir-charles-churros", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1g5jkhi/botulism_faq/", "html_title": ""}

Ofc they wash their hands and wear gloves but there's got to be someone else who could make eggs and not all the baked goods right?).\n\nThe thing that gets me (and is the reason for this post really) is that they label everything in the store with a \"use by\" label so everything stays fresh, but then at night or first thing in the morning, the manager or night staff change ALL the labels... Every. Single. Day. Not a single item of food is correctly labelled with a correct \"use by\" date, the cold brew is always expired, I haven't seen anyone wash the sauce bottles in over a year, I don't even know how long it's been since the toaster was cleaned or the units that keep everything warm... \n\nAm I exaggerating?

I immediately contacted their customer service; they issued a refund and said that they had forwarded this matter to their food safety team.\n\nThe oddest thing is that the yogurt tasted not too bad - to me, it had a slight artificial cherry flavor, so I just thought there was some artificial flavoring that went into this plain yogurt by accident (I know now this is probably stupid thinking...). There was also a small amount of water on the surface of the yogurt when I first opened it. Again I did not take it seriously (the texture and taste - not counting the \"cherry\" flavor - felt fine).\n\nFor the most part, I feel ok. I have some throat discomfort. Before I knew I was having long-expired yogurt, I did not associate the discomfort and yogurt together. I am wondering if I should keep the little amount of yogurt left as physical evidence in case I get really sick (knock on wood). But I also don't want to keep a one-year-old yogurt in my fridge. Or should I go see a doctor?... It makes me feel pretty stupid that this happened, though I know the blame is completely on Amazon Fresh.\n\nI had a brief moment of thinking \"Wait, is it still 2022?\" when I saw the date on the packaging.

{"title": "Just had my power restored after a 3 day outage. Here's how I handled the food safety aspect.", "selftext": "It's not uncommon to see questions in this sub regarding the safety of food during power failures.  I just got my power back after an ice stormed knocked out power for 3 days, so I wanted to share how I navigated those waters.  \n\nThe first thing I can say, as I have many times in many threads, is if you don't already have a food thermometer, **get one**.  Get one probe style thermometer that is capable of reading both cold and hot temps (in other words, don't get a \"meat\" thermometer), and then get a hanging one to put in your fridge.  None of what I'm about to advise is going to be feasible unless you can take accurate temps.  You don't need fancy digital ones (although those are fun), and you can get dial-type ones for under $10.\n\nI have 2 fridges with small freezer compartments, and 1 freezer chest.  Once it became obvious that this wasn't going to be a short outage, I grabbed everything from the freezer compartments and (working quickly to minimize the time the door was open) threw everything into the chest.  \n\nThe basic premise here is that a tightly packed freezer (regardless of whether its a chest or compartment) will stay frozen longer than one that is half full.  Just for grins, I threw the thermometer I use to monitor how hot my smoker is on top of the food in the chest.  It has a wire that leads to a panel so I could monitor the temps without opening the chest.  When the power came back on, the warmest it got in there was 26F.\n\nIf you encounter this situation, when the power comes back on, check your freezer.  If it still feels hard, then you know you're fine.  Ice crystals are also a good sign.  If it thaws, then this is the point you will need your thermometer.  Start taking temps of the food near the surface where it will be the warmest (the center may still be frozen).  If the temp is 41F or below, then you can keep the food.  At this point it's just like being refrigerated instead of frozen.  You *can* refreeze at this point, just understand that there may be a loss of quality.  But the main point is the food is still safe.\n\nIf it's over 41F, then the question is how long was it over that threshold.  Be aware that even when the power comes back on, it will still take a few hours for your appliances to cool back down.  Anyone who frequents this sub knows this song:  under 2 hours and you can cool it back down again and under 4 hours you can cook and eat it right away.  \n\nThe refrigerator compartments are a bit trickier, since they are starting from a warmer temperature.  In my case, I know that my fridges both run about 37F \u2013 38F, so I have at least a few hours to work with before things go south.  That first day of the outage, the temp outside was in the mid to high 40\u2019s.  But once the sun went down, so did the temp and it wasn\u2019t going to be above the 30\u2019s for the next few days.  So I loaded everything I wanted to keep and wasn\u2019t just refrigerated for quality and moved it to the detached garage.  I threw another thermometer in the box and it never got into the danger zone.\n\nHere's a final point.  Being over 41F for over 4 hours does **not** guarantee that you will get sick.  But for every hour and every degree over those levels increases the **risk** of illness.  At this point you need to ask yourself if the potential risk of serious illness is worth the cost of the food you are discarding.  That is a decision that you need to make for yourself, but if you ask anyone who has been hit with any of the major bugs\u2026 well, you know.  If you made it through this entire wall of text, go get yourself a nice bowl of ice cream or some other treat.

{"title": "Please stop downvoting questions", "selftext": "\"TL;DR cause I'm a wordy son of a gun: Part of why we're here is to help folks learn. If you don't want to help, it takes less effort to just ignore it than it does to downvote it.\n\nThis subreddit is here for experienced (cooks), but it's also here for people who are just starting out. What's more, no matter how much experience we have under our belts, there's always more we can learn. Nobody here, not a single one of us, knows all that there is to know about gardening.\n\nIn the past few days I've seen more folks downvoted for asking innocent questions than I have in the past. That's remarkable because this subreddit has kinda always had a problem with downvoting questions.\n\nThis is a problem because downvoting discourages people from engaging. It keeps folks from asking questions, and it prevents answering them too. It makes folks move on, and then everyone misses out on information that person might have had that we don't.\n\nIf you don't want to answer a question, that's fine. You don't have to. Move along. It's not that hard, it takes even less effort to ignore a question than it does to downvote it. But realize that the reason a person is asking a question is because they don't know the answer and they want to. You have an opportunity to educate someone. That's an awesome opportunity. You can even get drawn into a discussion about it and get to talk in-depth about this passion that, ultimately, all of us here want to share.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe it's a question that's been asked a million times. Guess what? Reddit's search function genuinely sucks. Don't blame people for not using it, it is legitimately very very bad. You can try it yourself. It'll work sometimes and other times it won't.\n\nNot everyone's been a member here for so long, and not everyone has seen everything. Helping people to learn is part of what this subreddit is for. If you don't have the patience to help them and you just want to look at more pictures,(...) fine, just move on and leave them alone.

{"title": "Mexican mom leaves food on counter every night", "selftext": "This is going to be a bit lengthy sorry. Please bear in mind I come from a Mexican family. I want to respect her past and culture differences from me, US born and raised, but me and my boyfriend are living with her again. And he worries because he grew up with food safety, his mom taught him everything from freezing to reheating leftovers.\n\nMy Mexican mom has always left out food overnight. She cooks it in the big pots and pans and then will cover it with a lid, aluminum foil, or sometimes nothing and leave it overnight on the counter. Sometimes she does try to plastic-bag things more when I ask, and she does refrigerate some things. But it\u2019s pretty clear she does the pots and pans on the counter more, because of her own past etc and for \u201cstorage space\u201d. We usually eat the food the next day or within 2 days. \n\n- Chile verde, steak/potatoes/sauce, enchiladas, carne asada (tacos), pozole (soup), bacon (cooked), mole (sauce or curry basically w chicken) eggs with weenies (cut up hot dogs),\n\n- Refried beans. Rice, she always leaves out the rice. Spaghetti. \n\n- Burgers from restaurants, she leaves out half a burger with some fries overnight. \n\n- Any of the vegetables we were having. Maybe the tomatoes for the tacos, cilantro and onion. Maybe fried zucchini. stir fry so any extra veggies mixed with rice, left in a big pan. \n\nThis is a majority of things she often leaves overnight out. The few times she has asked me to reheat the food was winter time/cold temperatures (I was home and she was at work), and that food was only pozole/soups and mole/sauce with chicken. \n\nI haven\u2019t gotten sick off her food but I have been educating myself about food safety for my boyfriend and I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019m a young adult so forgive my ignorance. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Are any of these foods allowed to be left out? I am familiar now that she shouldn\u2019t leave meat out but.. she always leaves it out lol. \n\n2. Crema / sour cream: she will use it way past the expiration date for enchiladas. I try to understand sometimes her English is poor so I figured I should know the max days the sour cream can stay in fridge before I toss it for her? \n\n3. Ketchup: she keeps leaving it outside. I put it in the fridge and then it happens again. Is ketchup outside or inside the fridge? How many times can she keep leaving it out before I have to toss it. \n\n4. Is there any \u201cOK\u201d or green light where she can justify why we won\u2019t get sick or why she\u2019ll keep putting the food in the counter. Maybe because of the cultural differences? \n\n5. What\u2019s the logic of her reheating soups and meat w sauces in the winter, VS never reheating other stuff? \n\n6. Realistically, will I eventually get me or my boyfriend sick from her food? We had one case of a weird food poisoning but it didn\u2019t seem to be from her.. and it wasn\u2019t apparently Covid. \n\n^ adding to that, even if it\u2019s not now, over time as I age my stomach probably won\u2019t be as strong against her food or?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the length and ignorance but, it\u2019s obviously something I\u2019ve seen all my life from her and I want to respect everyone and educate myself on what\u2019s the best decision.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/158it27/mexican_mom_leaves_food_on_counter_every_night/", "created_utc": 1690223501.0, "score": 42, "author": "kraftrainy04", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/158it27/mexican_mom_leaves_food_on_counter_every_night/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I've banned a lot of accounts for everything from death threats to unprompted vicious insults. The past few days have brought the top upvoted post (friggin chicken, always), and a tremendous amount of discussion. \n\nSo, for you newcomers, what's the deal with r/foodsafety, and what is it here for? \n\nThis is a subreddit dedicated to answering any questions regarding food safety. Whether it's questioning an expired package of cheese, or whether hairnets are really required for Costco audits. I'll admit that a majority of what we see is questions regarding the safety of a specific food item. \n\nDoes this seem like a bunch of overly anxious people asking questions that may seem obvious to you? It can look like that from the outside, but let me give you some examples of what people are dealing with when they come here. These are taken from real posts:\n\n-A person recently had food poisoning and now has crippling anxiety whenever they get a stomach ache. They came here asking for tips to keep their kitchen clean and what resources they could read. \n\n-A parent was concerned about their child after they ate some expired candy. We were able to explain the difference between shelf stable foods, best by, consume by, etc. We saved them a multi hour drive to a hospital and a world of worry.\n\n-Someones elderly father insisted on doing the cooking when everyone visited, but had some very unsafe behavior that had made the family sick before. We gave them suggestions on how to talk to their father and help them adjust the unsafe behavior. \n\n**Consider this a warning:**\n\nWe will be aggressively monitoring posts and comments. Insults, threats, trolling, and just generally being an ass over numerous comments will result in a ban. You can disagree with someone, you can't call them a ||piss baby||. Please decide if your comment is helpful before posting. Please decide if your joke is funny before replying. \n\nIf your idea of a good time is to go into depression subs and call everyone crybabies, this is not the sub for you. \n\nIf you have a question about something you ate or bought, or something someone may try to feed you, glad you've found us. \n\nPlease feel free to ask questions here in the comments, we'll try to answer. \n\nThank you all.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Mods of r/foodsafety", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/13r7utn/read_before_commenting_or_posting/", "created_utc": 1684988981.0, "score": 42, "author": "Redbaron1701", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/13r7utn/read_before_commenting_or_posting/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

On weekends we host an all you can eat breakfast buffet. We serve usual breakfast items like eggs, bacon, pancakes and sausage gravy. The food is put in containers and put into steam tables to keep it warm while out in the main dining area. On Saturday once the buffet is taken down, all of the food is put into the fridge and reheated the next day and put back out on the buffet. Then on Sunday, it's all put in the freezer. The following Friday it's all usually taken out and left on a table overnight to thaw to then be reused again for the buffet. This isn't my first job working with prepared food but it is my first working in a proper restaurant setting. I know the rules can vary wildly depending on specific factors, but I've never heard of reuing food this many times. \n\nIs it still safe to use all the food?

{"title": "Can you keep butter on the counter?", "selftext": "My bf and I are in a bit of an argument regarding butter. Growing up, my family always kept butter in a butter dish, the kind that looks like a lil rectangular plate and had a dome lid. It stayed on the counter, usually under the shelves. It would stay there for the week or two it took us to consume a stick of butter (neither of us ate many things that required butter), so it was always soft and easily spreadable. It was only one stick at a time; the rest stayed in the fridge until we needed a new stick. \n\nI never got food poisoning growing up unless I ate at a place like Golden Corral. \n\nI told my boyfriend about this and he is horrified. He cannot fathom keeping butter out for more than the time it takes to cut how much you need off the stick and re-wrap it to put it back in the fridge. \n\nApparently Google says it can only be out for a day or two? Salted butter can maybe last 3 days but otherwise it\u2019ll go rancid. But growing up mine never did. Was I just constantly eating poison for 19 years or was I just lucky? \n\nIf it helps, I grew up in Southern California and our house always had the AC at 73\u00b0F year-round.

I get that it\u2019s tragic for those 3 people but in a country of 340 million people your chances of getting botulism or dying from it seem pretty minimal.  I know canning and home preserving are a big thing in America; probably more so than other countries but it would appear that improper canning was only responsible for around 5 incidents.  Yet this and other food related subs are flooded with questions like, my chicken was undercooked will I get botulism? I left some salmon in the car for an hour will I get botulism?  I used some old garlic will I get botulism?  These questions always seem to come from Americans.  I get that botulism is nasty but no other nationalities seem concerned by it. I can tell you that in Australia botulism never gets a mention. Ever.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nAre people over reacting? Have they been conditioned to be scared of botulism and don\u2019t realise how rare it seems to be (to me anyway)? Do they not fully understand what causes it?

I just opened it again at 9 PM tonight, so around 2 and a half hours later, and the max reading showed 40.4\u00b0F, but the current temperature was around 37\u00b0F, even lower (33\u00b0F) on my analog thermometer.

Growing up, my family always kept butter in a butter dish, the kind that looks like a lil rectangular plate and had a dome lid. It stayed on the counter, usually under the shelves. It would stay there for the week or two it took us to consume a stick of butter (neither of us ate many things that required butter), so it was always soft and easily spreadable. It was only one stick at a time; the rest stayed in the fridge until we needed a new stick. \n\nI never got food poisoning growing up unless I ate at a place like Golden Corral. \n\nI told my boyfriend about this and he is horrified. He cannot fathom keeping butter out for more than the time it takes to cut how much you need off the stick and re-wrap it to put it back in the fridge. \n\nApparently Google says it can only be out for a day or two? Salted butter can maybe last 3 days but otherwise it\u2019ll go rancid. But growing up mine never did. Was I just constantly eating poison for 19 years or was I just lucky? \n\nIf it helps, I grew up in Southern California and our house always had the AC at 73\u00b0F year-round. My parents were also baby boomers if that also helps with why they thought it was okay to keep butter out. Only butter, nothing else refrigerated.

The food in question was diced tomatoes with tofu and ground turkey. Of course it\u2019s like a stew type of dish most commonly known in Vietnam. Anyways, so we cooked a lot of it so that it could be eaten over the next couple days (for lunch and dinner etc). So we let it cool down for an hour after cooking and then we put it in the fridge overnight.\n\nFast forward to today during lunch\u2026\n\nI had my Mother on FaceTime for our daily chats and she saw me take out the large pot out of the fridge and put it on the stove to heat up. She freaks out at me and tells me that I should not do this and that I should put leftover food in a ceramic container instead. She also stated that if I do what I\u2019m doing right now that it\u2019s not safe because of the metal and the food and whatever (I also had no idea what the she was talking about) would make me have food poisoning. She then told me about relatives that did something similar like this, and that put them in the hospital and made them really sick. (Mind you these relatives don\u2019t eat the best and healthy foods and are t super hygienic). And then just kind of just shook my head and while trying to discuss this with my mother I ended up burning the food so I had to dump it all out\u2026what a waste. \n\nANYWAYS:\nIs this anywhere near true what she claims??

I do have OCD so I know I'm overthinking this but I'm going through a rough time atm so my thoughts are kinda spiralling. And this is more food adjacent than directly dealing with food but idk where else to ask or find information\n\nAnyway, I have a knife sharpening stone that has been stored in water in a sealed plastic container for like 3 years. I used to change the water out very frequently, but stopped using the stone and it just sat in a cupboard undisturbed for years. The container has a \"smart seal\" type lid, with a silicone seal and a knob to twist at the top to lock the lid closed, so no water has evaporated and I guess no air would get in either? But I don't know if this has created an environment for botulism to grow, and the water is kind of grey from the stone sitting in it. I guess my train of thought is if there was any food residue left on my knife that maybe got on the stone, and now the stone has been stewing there for years, could it be a risk for botulism?\n\nHow do I go about disposing of this safely, since I don't think I can bring myself to use it ever again.

I said I understood that fish sold to eat raw is frozen and asked if freezing it a second time would impact the quality. She said:\n\n>Sorry it took me a little longer to get back to you. I had to reach out to Wulf's directly to get the correct answer. To clarify, the term \"sushi grade\" is primarily used by restaurants to indicate that the fish has been frozen and thawed to eliminate the risk of parasites. For snapper, there is no legal requirement for freezing before service, and many of our partner restaurants confidently use our snapper for sushi.What we can assure you of is that both Wulfs and Savenor's take great care in handling our snapper to ensure it meets high standards for quality consumption. However, once it leaves our store, it\u2019s up to you, the consumer, to ensure it\u2019s properly maintained if you intend to consume it [raw.In](http://raw.In) short, our snapper is not frozen before we receive it, but we take the proper steps in handling it for safe consumption. We trust this helps clarify, and we're always happy to answer any further questions!\n\nSo she totally misunderstood my question, but now I'm wondering if I should just get something else that has been super frozen?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1jux3h2/how_risky_is_eating_good_quality_red_snapper_that/", "created_utc": 1744171692.0, "score": 0, "author": "Not_instant_ramen17", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1jux3h2/how_risky_is_eating_good_quality_red_snapper_that/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Every ingredient was the same as the ones I've used many previous times, except the baking soda, that one was different.\n\nAnyone has an idea as to what happened and if it's safe to eat?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1jrchir/chicken_smelled_weirdly_unpleasant_after_i_put_it/", "created_utc": 1743774971.0, "score": 1, "author": "eternal_ttorment", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1jrchir/chicken_smelled_weirdly_unpleasant_after_i_put_it/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I didn\u2019t consume any, but threw some of the water outside then the rest in the trash bin and put the jar to soak in water and soap before really freaking out and taking the jar, lid and trash out altogether. \n\nI highly doubt there is any risk for botulism, especially cause inhalation is so rare, but I\u2019m in a total panic, and can\u2019t find much information for my circumstance online. \n\nThank you for your patience.

My question here is, I opened my fridge last at around 6:30-6:45 PM tonight and my fridge was below 40, at around 38.3\u00b0 on the digital thermometer. I just opened it again at 9 PM tonight, so around 2 and a half hours later, and the max reading showed 40.4\u00b0F, but the current temperature was around 37\u00b0F, even lower (33\u00b0F) on my analog thermometer. Let\u2019s say worst case, the fridge was at 40.4\u00b0F for the whole 2 and a half hours. Would the food still be safe to eat? I have pre cooked chicken, eggs, cold cuts, tempeh, vegetables, fruits, etc in there. \n\nI keep seeing varying information on whether the danger zone starts at anything above 40\u00b0F or anything above 41\u00b0F. \n\nPlease let me know! I actually recently threw all the meat/perishables in my fridge away right after I bought them because my fridge thermometer was too high, so I really hope I don\u2019t have to do that again!\n\nTDLR: If my fridge was at 40.4\u00b0F for 2.5-3 hours, should food be discarded?

{"title": "Can you keep butter on the counter?", "selftext": "My bf and I are in a bit of an argument regarding butter. Growing up, my family always kept butter in a butter dish, the kind that looks like a lil rectangular plate and had a dome lid. It stayed on the counter, usually under the shelves. It would stay there for the week or two it took us to consume a stick of butter (neither of us ate many things that required butter), so it was always soft and easily spreadable. It was only one stick at a time; the rest stayed in the fridge until we needed a new stick. \n\nI never got food poisoning growing up unless I ate at a place like Golden Corral. \n\nI told my boyfriend about this and he is horrified. He cannot fathom keeping butter out for more than the time it takes to cut how much you need off the stick and re-wrap it to put it back in the fridge. \n\nApparently Google says it can only be out for a day or two? Salted butter can maybe last 3 days but otherwise it\u2019ll go rancid. But growing up mine never did. Was I just constantly eating poison for 19 years or was I just lucky? \n\nIf it helps, I grew up in Southern California and our house always had the AC at 73\u00b0F year-round. My parents were also baby boomers if that also helps with why they thought it was okay to keep butter out. Only butter, nothing else refrigerated.

I\u2019m basically trying to figure out if I was served a 3 year old steak\u2026. And if that is the cause of my ongoing stomach issues since this morning. Diarrhea didn\u2019t start until about 14 hours after consuming.\n\nI called the restaurant and they told me this meat essentially cannot go bad. It\u2019s stored in such a sterile environment that it\u2019s completely normal to get it at this time from slaughter/fabrication date. Previously when I had wagyu from this restaurant the fabrication date was just months from the time it was served. They chalked it up to their purveyors getting the Wagyu from different suppliers. I\u2019m trying to figure out if there is accuracy to that statement or if I\u2019m being fed a bunch of bull (pun intended).\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/b56rrxmpb9xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745707177.0, "score": 50, "author": "danielson35", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1k8p6vg/does_this_wagyu_beef_card_make_sense_for_having/", "html_title": ""}

I do have OCD so I know I'm overthinking this but I'm going through a rough time atm so my thoughts are kinda spiralling. And this is more food adjacent than directly dealing with food but idk where else to ask or find information\n\nAnyway, I have a knife sharpening stone that has been stored in water in a sealed plastic container for like 3 years. I used to change the water out very frequently, but stopped using the stone and it just sat in a cupboard undisturbed for years. The container has a \"smart seal\" type lid, with a silicone seal and a knob to twist at the top to lock the lid closed, so no water has evaporated and I guess no air would get in either? But I don't know if this has created an environment for botulism to grow, and the water is kind of grey from the stone sitting in it. I guess my train of thought is if there was any food residue left on my knife that maybe got on the stone, and now the stone has been stewing there for years, could it be a risk for botulism?\n\nHow do I go about disposing of this safely, since I don't think I can bring myself to use it ever again. I know that it has to have at least some kind of bacterial growth or mold, but to me it feels like I'm dealing with a bomb or something since my anxiety is wild right now\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsafety/comments/1k141n5/food_safety_adjacent_question/", "created_utc": 1744862984.0, "score": 0, "author": "Spiritual-Quail3583", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/foodsafety/comments/1k141n5/food_safety_adjacent_question/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I said I understood that fish sold to eat raw is frozen and asked if freezing it a second time would impact the quality. She said:\n\n>Sorry it took me a little longer to get back to you. I had to reach out to Wulf's directly to get the correct answer. To clarify, the term \"sushi grade\" is primarily used by restaurants to indicate that the fish has been frozen and thawed to eliminate the risk of parasites. For snapper, there is no legal requirement for freezing before service, and many of our partner restaurants confidently use our snapper for sushi.What we can assure you of is that both Wulfs and Savenor's take great care in handling our snapper to ensure it meets high standards for quality consumption. However, once it leaves our store, it\u2019s up to you, the consumer, to ensure it\u2019s properly maintained if you intend to consume it [raw.In](http://raw.In) short, our snapper is not frozen before we receive it, but we take the proper steps in handling it for safe consumption.

Pls help :( I don't feel comfortable letting them cook and consume this. Srry for the poor picture but I'm very afraid to touch it. Its mostly blue and brown with pink spots (can kinda see that) and some sort of yellow substance on it.
