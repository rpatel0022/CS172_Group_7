{"title": "I tried 4 Cubanos in Miami ", "selftext": "Ranked from favorite to least favorite:\n\n1. Sanguich: 10/10\n$13.49\nEvery time I visit Miami, Sanguich is a must. Ever since my first visit 4-5 years ago, they haven\u2019t lost their touch! This sandwich is simply perfect. \n\nPerfectly toasted bread for a crispy crust that still allows for a soft interior. The pork and ham are juicy, soft, tender, and so flavorful. They really know how to marinade and flavor the pork to get it so juicy and tasting amazing. Plenty of cheese ooey and melty all throughout the sandwich. Crunchy pickles, and the right amount of mustard. \n\nI\u2019ll also add the pan con Lechon is the best I\u2019ve had in Miami, the mamey smoothie is delicious, and service is always excellent.\n\n\n2. Old\u2019s Havana ($13.50) 6/10 and 3. Havana 1957 ($18) 5/10 \n\nTo me, both of these cubanos are on the same level. They feel amateurish, but not in a bad way, just not to the level of Sanguich but still better than a lot of places. The pork and ham aren\u2019t quite as juicy and soft but do have good flavor. These sandwiches feel a bit more \u201cdown home\u201d. Nothing to rant about but still good places to sit down, relax, and enjoy a hearty sandwich. \n\nI did enjoy the Fritas on each, the Havana 1957 was a bit more cheesy and meaty though. I liked how much the sandwich was toasted on the 1957 sandwich, it was much more crispy than Old\u2019s, however, Old\u2019s was still warmed well where the bread was toasty like it had just come out of the oven.\n\nAlthough the sandwiches themselves are similar in many ways, Havana 1957 gets a drop due to the $5 higher price albeit we are aware this may be more of a tourist trap. You also get a $5 pp charge that isn\u2019t clearly indicated for the evening dinners due to the live entertainment. We absolutely enjoyed the band and singer but it comes down to a principal issue when that \u201ccover charge\u201d wasn\u2019t stated on the menu, signage, or when we made reservations specifically for the evening entertainment. \n\n\n4. Cubaton ($12.95) 1/10 \nFor a place that has so many accolades displayed on the wall of the restaurant, I expected the sandwich to be up there with Sanguich. This was actually the worst of the four and one of the worst I\u2019ve had anywhere. Everything about this Cubano was so darn dry, the meat was bland, and the sandwich was hardly toasted because the sandwich was handed to me before I could finish paying. The bread was definitely stale and old given its texture. And this sucks because I ate their breakfast sandwich the day before, a Pan con Timba, and it was simple but delicious.

Here\u2019s how I make my Onion Rings: \n\nOnion Rings 2 cups all purpose flour, divided2 teaspoons paprika1 teaspoon garlic powder2 teaspoons salt1/2 teaspoon pepper12 ounces of your favorite beer 2 large Vidalia onionsVegetable or Peanut oil for frying \n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups of flour with the paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Whisk in the beer until the mixture is well combined. Let the batter rest at room temperature for 10-12 minutes.\nWhile the batter rests, cut the tip off of the stem side of the onions then remove peel. Slice the onions horizontally into 1/2 inch thick rings and toss them with the remaining 1/2 cup of flour.\nAdd the oil to a large, Dutch oven to a depth of 2 inches and heat it over medium high heat until a deep fry thermometer reaches 375\u00b0F.\nWorking in batches, dip onion rings into prepared batter shaking off excess, then immediately drop into hot oil. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot. Allow the onions to cook in the oil, flipping them once to guarantee even browning, for a total of approximately 3 minutes. Remove onions with slotted spoon and transfer them to paper towel lined plate. Immediately season with salt. Repeat coating & frying process, returning the oil to 375 between batches, with remaining onions!  Enjoy!  \n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/brzpir5a5qne1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1741552351.0, "score": 756, "author": "KarinsDogs", "num_comments": 38, "permalink": "/r/Sandwiches/comments/1j7gx2m/patty_melt_w_my_famous_onion_rings_horseradish/", "html_title": ""}

Toast a brioche bun in a non-stick pan; then lightly fry the mortadella, flip, top with grated provolone, and cover until melted and starting to form a cheese skirt. Add plenty of mayo and dijon on both halves of the bun, assemble, and serve with a huge glass of water and a salad.\n\nThe Bourdain sandwich definitely needs to be quite mustard-forward to balance out the richness, so it'll probably get better each time you make it until you find the perfect balance.\n\nIf anyone cares about the salad, it's a cucumber salad with yuzu kosho vinaigrette, topped with cherry tomatoes, scallions, and black sesame seeds.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/g6nnrdfgb2ue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744315298.0, "score": 29, "author": "justinpenner", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Sandwiches/comments/1jw79gh/bourdain_sandwich/", "html_title": ""}
