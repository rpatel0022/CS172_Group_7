I just got a soft box + continuous lighting set up so I\u2019m hoping to start focusing more on proper lighting and composition. \n\nI find my photos to be quite busy and I know that I\u2019m still an amateur so it\u2019ll take time to hone my style, but I find myself taking the same type of photos each time. My goal is to be more intentional with how and what I shoot. I\u2019ve been trying to start shooting further back and including more people into shots.

I've been experimenting with high contrast looks. Always played it safe and by the rules with color adjustments (whites never clipping, blacks juuuust touching the edge of the histogram, blah, blah) and decided that I always like pictures that break those rules so I might as well break them too. \n\nThe first shot I believe was a misfire on my key light. However, the drink and rim light on the hand had enough information to pull some cool looks out of it. I love how isolated and bold it turned out. \n\nThe second shot was fine. The shot I provided the client had hands in it and was more neutrally graded, even if a little back lit. I think tweaking the curve and undertones made this one feel super moody and mysterious. \n\nLastly, the negroni shot was very similar to something I believe I've posted here before. Same shot even. Totally different experimental crop and pushed the colors a lot - probably even too much in the red (you can see it in the bottom of the orange peel, oh well). \n\nThere's still some technical stuff and lighting choices I wish I'd done differently in all of these, but I'm happy for what they are after salvaging! All shot indoors around 4pm on different days a year or two ago. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on whether they're successful or not.

{"title": "Common Beginner Mistakes", "selftext": "Hi! So I've been on this subreddit for a little over a month. And I just wanted to make a quick rundown on some of the more common mistakes I saw in beginner photos. Hopefully, if you're just starting out this will be of some help!\n\nAll the photos below are by me. You'll see by no means am I a professional, but I do hope this provides value. Feel free to add any suggestions of your own of course.\n\n**1. Flatlay\u2019s are too flat.**\n\nDon't only pay attention to the two dimensions when taking a flat lay! In many cases, the more dimensional your photos are the better they will look. Feel free to add a cloth or a second plate for more layers and create that perception of depth.\n\nAs is with the next 9 tips, this is not an unbreakable rule. In general, they stand true. However, if you have a good reason to break a rule feel free to get creative! Always shoot with intent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This photo doesn't have as many layers but that's fine because I'm emphasizing the pattern made by the M&Ms](https://preview.redd.it/1svx9zxzexl41.jpg?width=2664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b7be90d1663a95dddcb808d635e4c637a170da8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If your heart wants to get creative, \\\\\"gopher\\\\\" it!](https://preview.redd.it/8an3e3rafxl41.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1276c9713e9fe49f3272f253d1f3329d6f89a83)\n\n**2. Too much shadow.**\n\nThis is a common mistake when trying to shoot dark and moody food photography. Even in dark photos, your subject should still be properly exposed.\n\nIf you're shooting with only one light source (e.g. window light), adding a whiteboard or white bedsheet on the opposite side serving as a light bouncer works great.\n\nSame with highlights, You want your milk to be white but not eye-blinding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na1uvsv9fxl41.jpg?width=7360&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2834687555ddc56a1ed07d7914347f28a11e14f7\n\n**3. Not filling the frame.**\n\nThis makes your photo feel empty and hollow. Place your props on the edges of your photo and let the frame cut it. The viewer will feel that there is more than meets the eye and it creates curiosity about what is beyond the frame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ngepahjfxl41.jpg?width=4912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac4dfcda3bf90427006ee3b3dfb21a6868e4104d\n\n**4. Not filling up the bowl/cup/glass.**\n\nI actually only started paying attention to this after being on this sub!\n\nCreate that abundance and avoid scarcity. Not only will it look better, but this will help your subject pop. There are a variety of ways to \u201ccheat\u201d if you don\u2019t have enough food. You can add a smaller bowl inside a bigger bowl that will take up space but be covered by the contents of your food. You can also use smaller bowls and plates, which without anything to reference will look perfectly normal-sized in your photo.\n\n**5. Wrong focus.**\n\nI see this a lot with sandwiches and hamburgers. Only the tip of the lettuce is in focus while the rest of the bun is out of focus. Bump up that aperture. In my opinion, you\u2019d rather have your background completely in focus than parts of your subject being out of focus.\n\n**6. Distracting background.**\n\nThis is pretty straightforward, but I still ignore it sometimes out of pure laziness. Make sure your background is clean, folks! Anything that is irrelevant to the photo should stay out of the photo.\n\n[Too lazy to iron the backdrop...](https://preview.redd.it/cwps7jb0gxl41.jpg?width=4912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74a178b9541719eff206e0b0f442ac6e172c8b65)\n\n**7. Bad color.**\n\nColor is very very important in food photography and plays a big part in making your food look tasty.\n\nProper editing can go a long way but do not over-saturate. Also, keep in mind white foods like milk and rice. You don't want yellow milk after messing with the white balance too much.\n\nUsing complementary colors is also a great way to make your subject stand out.  Check out [color.adobe.com](https://color.adobe.com).\n\n**8. Not paying attention to corners.**\n\nThis is just proper attention to detail. Before calling it a day, check the corners of your photo and make sure nothing is poking in. Some things I saw that were irrelevant to the photo and could have easily been avoided - corner of a window, dust, food crumbs, edge of the backdrop.\n\n**9. Not using props.**\n\nProps help convey the atmosphere or story. They help with composition, either by framing your subject or leading the eye towards it. Start out with simple utensils and a piece of cloth if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The newspaper adds to the \\\\\"morning vibe\\\\\" and frames the cereal bowl](https://preview.redd.it/h8rwls9phxl41.jpg?width=5572&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72979fadf04556ff64e9bc62fe7b4696030f1af1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helped!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodphotography/comments/fgncmo/common_beginner_mistakes/", "created_utc": 1583882868.0, "score": 30, "author": "pj20001", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/foodphotography/comments/fgncmo/common_beginner_mistakes/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Light painting. Still life photography. The Dutch Golden Age inspiration", "selftext": "My first attempt to shoot with a torch in complete darkness. This is light painting. It helps create unique photographs that make a statement, I believe.  \n\u2800  \nSo how to use light painting?  \nMake sure to manually focus your camera before you start. And turn off all the lights. Take a very long exposure and move the torch in the places where you want your objects to be lightened.  \nRemember to hold the light longer on darker objects and less time on lighter ones.\n\n[Still life photography](https://preview.redd.it/vmn9uk7vihj61.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0f673b2753f9e3c872a0954a4be94f1fe6a42d3)\n\n\u2800  \nThis particular still life was inspired by the works of Dutch painters of 17th century, especially by Willem Claesz Heda and Pieter Claesz. I deliberately used colors instead of monochrome palette to make the picture juicier. The light was depicted as if from the window, tall and narrow. I was fascinated about the fact how much meaning was hidden by the Dutch authors in every oeuvre and tried to use symbolism in my photograph as well.  \n\u2800  \nThe central theme is also \u201cmemento mori\u201d (literally \u201cremember that you have to die\u201d). It reminds the viewer not to get lost in enjoying oneself with wealth and gluttony.  \n\u2800  \nSymbols and meanings:  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Apple has many meanings. It can signify love, knowledge, wisdom, joy, and death. In religious works it usually means temptation and original sin.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Grapes: earthly pleasures.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Pomegranate: fertility, desire, abundance, but also resurrection and immortality.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Bread and fish: everyday life, humility, the body of Christ.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Lemon has also several opposing meanings. From the one hand it's considered a symbol of luxury, love and longevity. On the other hand - disappointment and time passing.  \n\u2b50\ufe0f Glass and silver objects were expensive luxury items, they stood for wealth and power in still life paintings. However, turned over glasses or plates reminds about modesty and emptiness of material pursuits.  \n\u2800  \nHere is the same composition shot with artificial light (one source, a soft box). Do you see the difference? What image would you prefer the most?\n\n[Composition shot with a soft box lightning](https://preview.redd.it/x1aj5xjpkhj61.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16ca01efbf39e18dc1aebe05ca4a5b8107aa40b4)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodphotography/comments/lrmva5/light_painting_still_life_photography_the_dutch/", "created_utc": 1614199143.0, "score": 28, "author": "Shot_recp", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/foodphotography/comments/lrmva5/light_painting_still_life_photography_the_dutch/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019ve truly loved Fuji\u2014there\u2019s something timeless about the design and the images I\u2019ve been able to create with their cameras. But lately, especially as I\u2019ve leaned more into food photography, I\u2019ve started to feel like it might be time for a change.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I still admire Fujifilm. It\u2019s just not quite working for me anymore when it comes to capturing the detail, color, and mood I want in my food shots. That led me down a bit of a rabbit hole: researching different systems, watching YouTube reviews, reading blog posts, and checking out what other food photographers are using.\n\nOne camera that keeps coming up\u2014especially in budget-friendly circles\u2014is the Nikon D800 (and its slightly newer sibling, the D810). Or 850 These full-frame DSLRs were once professional workhorses, and now you can find them second-hand for a fraction of what they used to cost. I\u2019ve seen some fantastic bargain prices lately, and from everything I\u2019ve read and watched, they could be a great fit for my food photography needs.\n\nThe image quality, dynamic range, and lens options are hard to ignore, especially when you\u2019re not looking to break the bank. Of course, there\u2019s always that lingering question when switching systems: Do I stay loyal to a brand, or go where the gear works best?\n\nHave you used Nikon for food photography? Do you think the D800/D810 still holds up in 2025?\nOr maybe you\u2019ve found a different budget gem that\u2019s worked wonders for your setup \n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodphotography/comments/1kbbwf1/what_best_budget_camera_for_food_photography_time/", "created_utc": 1746003658.0, "score": 2, "author": "DepartureSpiritual27", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/foodphotography/comments/1kbbwf1/what_best_budget_camera_for_food_photography_time/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How do you deal with unhappy clients?", "selftext": "I have a client that contracted me for a full day of work at my day rate. As per my usual agreement, I take a 50% retainer and the remainder on delivery of the photos. This whole process this time around was accelerated and the client was in a big hurry to get it all done - and the contract went unsigned (I know this is on me, believe me, I'm kicking myself). I sent shots as I edited as I usually do for feedback and heard nothing but positive remarks. I delivered the gallery yesterday, and suddenly the work is \"completely unacceptable\" and \"I don't know how we can justify paying you the remainder of your invoice, or even the deposit we already paid\"\n\nThere was also a minimal amount of video involved - when we had our initial discovery call he asked if I had done video or could do it and I said \"I don't do much video, but if what you need is simple I can most likely get the shots you need\". He said they needed simple shots and I said sure, I'll try and get them for you. He came to me with an extensive shotlist that was storyboarded, completely beyond the scope of what we discussed. I still gave it an attempt to get them some usuable footage, but it was mostly crap, I don't have the proper equipment for what they wanted. I spent \\*maybe\\* an hour getting video shots. I told him, yes, the video is on me, I misunderstood your needs but I didn't charge you extra for it. He very snarkily said \"So we overpayed you for photography then? Because you spent some time doing video so it took away from photographing.\"\n\nUm, first of all, you haven't even paid me for the entire day yet, ya rude ass. (No, I didn't say that, but I wanted to) and second my day rate applies to anything beyond 5 hours. I worked an 8 hour day, and I spent 1 hour getting video shots, so it would have been billed at the day rate regardless.\n\nI am NOT an amateur food photographer. I have my BFA in photography and have been photographing food specifically for around two years now. I have literally never once had this type of feedback from a client, and I'm floored, and quite frankly, I don't know how to move forward. The quality of the work delivered matches my portfolio and is in line with the mood board I created for the shoot and was signed off on by them.\n\nI'm not optimistic about these guys paying the remainder of their invoice. What I want to know is how to go about my next contact with them, if you have any advice at all. He said he would get with the team to talk about a possible path forward and get back to me today (this was yesterday) and I said I would be happy to rework some of the edits if that's the issue - I sent over a before and after of a reworked edit and was left on read. The gallery has been downloaded and I think I'm going to get crickets now.\n\nWhat's the best way to address them now? I want to make it clear that if they do not pay the remainder of the invoice they do not have the rights to use my work product. From my understanding, since the contract was never actually signed, they have zero rights to the work product as I am an independent contractor. I will send a cease and desist letter if they don't comply with this request.\n\nI feel like they're trying to rip me off honestly. I delivered what we talked about, on par with the quality I represent on my website. They sought me out. I did not contact them for a pitch. I think they don't want to pay my full rate so they're suddenly saying the work is \"completely unacceptable\" and \"has major issues\".\n\nI fully expect them to use the work and not pay me without a strongly worded email.\n\nIf you read all of this - thank you. Any and all advice is appreciated. Like I said, this is my first time ever experiencing this and I'm just at a loss.\n\nTLDR: I delivered photos on par with my usual quality and the mood board that was approved for the shoot and the client suddenly hates them and doesn't want to pay me. The contract wasn't signed and I overlooked it - what can I do?\n\nIncluding the before and after edit I submitted below.\n\n[Before - Shot on Canon 6D Mark ii - 24-70MM.

For instance, the first pic was very blurry and they suggested several ways to improve focus and later had good suggestions of what props and ingredients to add to the image.\n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised with ChatGPT-4's abilities here and will continue to play around with this method.\n\nFor the shots shown here, I used a tripod-mounted Nikon D5300 with a 35 mm lens and a softbox light to the side (and some black foam core as flags). \n\nExposure settings: Image 1: 1/1.3, F14, ISO 320 | Image 3: 1/50, F2.2, ISO 320 | Image 5: 1/3, F8, ISO 320.

I am not happy with the crispness, clearness nor brightness of my photos.  I use an Android Samsung S22+ to take my photos in front of the largest window in my house.  It is large, but not floor length. Unfortunately, the window faces south instead of east or west, so there is not a lot of direct sunlight coming in.  I have to turn on the overhead light, which are daylight LED with 5000K temperature, to have enough light.  I use photo mode on my phone.  I tried portrait mode, but my picture looked blurry in places.  I have tried flash and no flash and the result does not look any different.  My photos have a slight yellowing tinge.  I have tried editing the brightness, temperature, and contrast using Snapseed and Retouch, as well as Instagram's photo editor.  It makes my photo a little better, but not as nice as I would like.  I would like for my photos to look like the photos in an account I follow on Instagram.  I asked the person who has this Instagram account about her pictures, and she told me that she uses her iphone, takes her picture in front of a floor length window using only the natural light that comes in.  She uses portrait mode on her iphone, and the only editing she does is minimal, and she uses the Instagram photo editor.  She does not use filters hardly at all.  I snapped my photo (second photo) with my Samsung S22+ and brightened it just a little, upped the contrast a little, and lowered the temperature a little.  Honestly, I don't know anything about photography.  I hardly know what I even did when I did the editing I described.  I would like for my photo (second photo) to be as crisp, bright, and clear as the photo (first photo)  from the Instagram account I mentioned before.

I\u2019ve truly loved Fuji\u2014there\u2019s something timeless about the design and the images I\u2019ve been able to create with their cameras. But lately, especially as I\u2019ve leaned more into food photography, I\u2019ve started to feel like it might be time for a change.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I still admire Fujifilm. It\u2019s just not quite working for me anymore when it comes to capturing the detail, color, and mood I want in my food shots. That led me down a bit of a rabbit hole: researching different systems, watching YouTube reviews, reading blog posts, and checking out what other food photographers are using.\n\nOne camera that keeps coming up\u2014especially in budget-friendly circles\u2014is the Nikon D800 (and its slightly newer sibling, the D810). Or 850 These full-frame DSLRs were once professional workhorses, and now you can find them second-hand for a fraction of what they used to cost. I\u2019ve seen some fantastic bargain prices lately, and from everything I\u2019ve read and watched, they could be a great fit for my food photography needs.\n\nThe image quality, dynamic range, and lens options are hard to ignore, especially when you\u2019re not looking to break the bank. Of course, there\u2019s always that lingering question when switching systems: Do I stay loyal to a brand, or go where the gear works best?\n\nHave you used Nikon for food photography? Do you think the D800/D810 still holds up in 2025?\nOr maybe you\u2019ve found a different budget gem that\u2019s worked wonders for your setup \n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodphotography/comments/1kbbwf1/what_best_budget_camera_for_food_photography_time/", "created_utc": 1746003658.0, "score": 2, "author": "DepartureSpiritual27", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/foodphotography/comments/1kbbwf1/what_best_budget_camera_for_food_photography_time/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How do you deal with unhappy clients?", "selftext": "I have a client that contracted me for a full day of work at my day rate. As per my usual agreement, I take a 50% retainer and the remainder on delivery of the photos. This whole process this time around was accelerated and the client was in a big hurry to get it all done - and the contract went unsigned (I know this is on me, believe me, I'm kicking myself). I sent shots as I edited as I usually do for feedback and heard nothing but positive remarks. I delivered the gallery yesterday, and suddenly the work is \"completely unacceptable\" and \"I don't know how we can justify paying you the remainder of your invoice, or even the deposit we already paid\"\n\nThere was also a minimal amount of video involved - when we had our initial discovery call he asked if I had done video or could do it and I said \"I don't do much video, but if what you need is simple I can most likely get the shots you need\". He said they needed simple shots and I said sure, I'll try and get them for you. He came to me with an extensive shotlist that was storyboarded, completely beyond the scope of what we discussed. I still gave it an attempt to get them some usuable footage, but it was mostly crap, I don't have the proper equipment for what they wanted. I spent \\*maybe\\* an hour getting video shots. I told him, yes, the video is on me, I misunderstood your needs but I didn't charge you extra for it. He very snarkily said \"So we overpayed you for photography then? Because you spent some time doing video so it took away from photographing.\"\n\nUm, first of all, you haven't even paid me for the entire day yet, ya rude ass. (No, I didn't say that, but I wanted to) and second my day rate applies to anything beyond 5 hours. I worked an 8 hour day, and I spent 1 hour getting video shots, so it would have been billed at the day rate regardless.\n\nI am NOT an amateur food photographer. I have my BFA in photography and have been photographing food specifically for around two years now. I have literally never once had this type of feedback from a client, and I'm floored, and quite frankly, I don't know how to move forward. The quality of the work delivered matches my portfolio and is in line with the mood board I created for the shoot and was signed off on by them.\n\nI'm not optimistic about these guys paying the remainder of their invoice. What I want to know is how to go about my next contact with them, if you have any advice at all. He said he would get with the team to talk about a possible path forward and get back to me today (this was yesterday) and I said I would be happy to rework some of the edits if that's the issue - I sent over a before and after of a reworked edit and was left on read. The gallery has been downloaded and I think I'm going to get crickets now.\n\nWhat's the best way to address them now? I want to make it clear that if they do not pay the remainder of the invoice they do not have the rights to use my work product. From my understanding, since the contract was never actually signed, they have zero rights to the work product as I am an independent contractor. I will send a cease and desist letter if they don't comply with this request.\n\nI feel like they're trying to rip me off honestly. I delivered what we talked about, on par with the quality I represent on my website. They sought me out. I did not contact them for a pitch. I think they don't want to pay my full rate so they're suddenly saying the work is \"completely unacceptable\" and \"has major issues\".\n\nI fully expect them to use the work and not pay me without a strongly worded email.\n\nIf you read all of this - thank you. Any and all advice is appreciated. Like I said, this is my first time ever experiencing this and I'm just at a loss.\n\nTLDR: I delivered photos on par with my usual quality and the mood board that was approved for the shoot and the client suddenly hates them and doesn't want to pay me. The contract wasn't signed and I overlooked it - what can I do?\n\nIncluding the before and after edit I submitted below.\n\n[Before - Shot on Canon 6D Mark ii - 24-70MM.

I am not happy with the crispness, clearness nor brightness of my photos.  I use an Android Samsung S22+ to take my photos in front of the largest window in my house.  It is large, but not floor length. Unfortunately, the window faces south instead of east or west, so there is not a lot of direct sunlight coming in.  I have to turn on the overhead light, which are daylight LED with 5000K temperature, to have enough light.  I use photo mode on my phone.  I tried portrait mode, but my picture looked blurry in places.  I have tried flash and no flash and the result does not look any different.  My photos have a slight yellowing tinge.  I have tried editing the brightness, temperature, and contrast using Snapseed and Retouch, as well as Instagram's photo editor.  It makes my photo a little better, but not as nice as I would like.  I would like for my photos to look like the photos in an account I follow on Instagram.  I asked the person who has this Instagram account about her pictures, and she told me that she uses her iphone, takes her picture in front of a floor length window using only the natural light that comes in.  She uses portrait mode on her iphone, and the only editing she does is minimal, and she uses the Instagram photo editor.  She does not use filters hardly at all.  I snapped my photo (second photo) with my Samsung S22+ and brightened it just a little, upped the contrast a little, and lowered the temperature a little.  Honestly, I don't know anything about photography.  I hardly know what I even did when I did the editing I described.  I would like for my photo (second photo) to be as crisp, bright, and clear as the photo (first photo)  from the Instagram account I mentioned before.  I need to mention the name of the account photo comes from to give the person credit for her photo.  The first photo is from the Instagram account: aprilsbakerlondon.
