It's fun to read the stories and see people's reactions to having their request for pizza met, even though it's a small thing. Just some people giving what they can to help their fellow man.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, last night I was reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/yvk0b/broke_till_the_1st_feel_like_shit_after_quitting/) thread, and gave props to the OP after he was heavily criticized for quitting smoking because of his girlfriend's pregnancy scare, and then continued to quit after it turned out to be negative. Later, I asked him to PM me about pizza.\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards, I went off Reddit for a couple of hours and then remembered my message, so I went back on and found several messages from whom I thought was one person. It turns out, the messages were from two people. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/9WcJY.png) is my inbox, which shows the messages. I was suspicious, because 999rafica responded twice, and then I had another message saying that he just got my message to PM me. I figured, hey, he probably saw my comment on the thread and then my PM so he sent me multiple replies. Or maybe he was excited about pizza and wondered why I didn't respond for a couple of hours.\n\n\n\n\nI ended up replying to the most-recent message, which was from ***999raffca***. The legitimate user's name is 999raff***i***ca, but I didn't notice the spelling difference until it was too late. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/user/999raffca) is the scammer's user profile. It was made right before he messaged me, proving that the account was made specifically to fool me. I guess I wasn't too concerned about getting scammed on a subreddit that's supposed to be about giving out of the random kindness of your heart.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, I don't know what Reddit wants me to do about this, but because the purchase (which was an e-gift certificate to Domino's) was made by me, I can't file it as fraud with my bank, and because the code was already used, Domino's isn't going to refund me.\n\n\n\n\nI guess I just want everyone out there to know that people suck, regardless of what you think.

Someone trying to take advantage of northernInfinity's plight and snag their pizza signed up as a redditor called northemInfinity and it slipped past me.  I sent the scumbag a $25 gift certificate for papajohns.  Luckily it all happened after Dominos was closed and I got to them before the giftcode was used. \n\nSo - now it won't work and there's another trick that I won't fall for again.  \n\nOf course, shame on me for falling for the top most scam mentioned on the Don't Fall For Scams page.  But I win this round - in the end.\n\nEDIT:  For fun, this is the email I sent to the giftcard people...\n\nHi,\n\nI got scammed by someone and sent this giftcard to the wrong person.  Take a moment and see if you can appreciate how annoying this is and help me stop the thieving little bastard from getting away with it.  \n\nI'm a part of the Reddit community called Random_acts_of_pizza.  You can find it here\n\nwww.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza\n\nIt's a lovely little community that gives away pizzas to people.  Sometimes because they need them and sometimes just for fun.  I myself have purchased about 15 $25 gift certificates from you guys.  In fact, I only ever give away PapaJohns/Dominos/PizzaHut pizza because I can just give them your eGiftCard.  Check xxxxxxx@xxxxx.com as one of your regular customers.\n\nSo - this guy made a post and I offered him a pizza:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/leogq/request_havent_eaten_in_36_hours_got_six_bucks_in/\n\nSo (if you can go to the link) you'll see that I told him to send me a message with his email and preference of pizza and that I'd send him a gift card.  That's when the scammer stepped in.  He created a new account with a username Very Similar to the person making the post and he sent me a private message with that email address in the hope that I wouldn't notice the difference in the username and that I'd send Him the gift card instead of the needy person.  What an utter ass, eh?\n\nWell, it worked! :(  \n\nI Did send him the gift card.  THIS gift card.  And now I'm hoping that you'll rescind it and foil his evil plan.  Maybe give me a new gift card number as a replacement that I can donate to someone worthy.  If you do this then I'll be sure to mention how you helped foil this nasty little thief.\n\nBut here's the thing.  He may have already spent it (in which case I'm screwed).  But if he hasn't then he's likely to spend it very soon.  So - if he hasn't spent it yet, please cancel it so that I can give it to someone worthy.\n\nThank you!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/lf682/gotcha_you_scamming_scumbag_thats_one_trick_that/", "created_utc": 1318864224.0, "score": 213, "author": "badbrownie", "num_comments": 115, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/lf682/gotcha_you_scamming_scumbag_thats_one_trick_that/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Unfortunately it was not possible to accomplish with new submissions rolling in, I had to shut down. This stuff has been neglected for too long.. When I made the \"superhero\" flair, for 40+ gifts, I thought  \"surely nobody will ever reach this\".. so I just went with \"superhero\" with a superman icon.. But just in correcting the transactions from the past years, /u/bobbyshark counted... I believe **43 pizzas** that were hidden from the records... ?! Thank you Bobby, we appreciate your generosity very much!\n\nAnyway, much as I hate to shut down the subreddit in this fashion, on a holiday weekend no less, it was absolutely necessary to reach these goals in the time I had available.

I can't change history, I can only apologize for not fixing it sooner.. Sorry.\n  \n* Approximately 400 expired transactions have been reviewed and corrected\n  * These are transactions that were not $confirm'ed or $cancel'ed correctly\n  * This should restore balance to pizza counts, please post to /r/SantaComplaints if your flair is wrong.\n  * The bot is now much more helpful for moderators; it's easier to keep track of ongoing transactions. Long-standing bugs have also been fixed, which enables the moderators to manage transactions.\n    \n* The bot now enforces the rules much tighter than before,\n  * Users that were gifted in the past 90 days will not be able to post requests or comment in giveaways\n  * Users that have received two pizzas more than they have given will not be able to post requests or comment in giveaways\n  * Users with a PROPOSED or EXPIRED transaction (as a recipient) will not be able to post requests or comment in giveaways\n  * Rule 7 wording has changed slightly, and now includes the phrasing, \"max two requests per month\", in addition to the original rule.\n  * Bot commands *no longer work in removed posts.* This means, if you want to fulfill a removed request, you must contact moderators first. Of course, you are free to gift who you want, and we will approve any request that you fulfill. It is a precautionary measure to ensure that it can't be tricked with if the request was not formally accepted.\n  \nPlease accept my apologies, everyone who had their posts removed in the days leading up to the shutdown. And of course, everyone that had their posts removed by the bot for the past two years while it's been sitting without getting attention. I did not initially think I would have to go private, let alone this long. Sorry about the lack of communications for the past two weeks while I have been working on this stuff, and concerning the shutdown itself. \n\nThe rest of the modteam were every bit as confused as you, and the truth is I could barely keep track of things myself...\n\nI hope you understand that I did this trying to improve the quality of the subreddit.\n\nThank you everyone for your patience and understanding, we are now open for business.\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful Christmas season!\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/a0e3n7/psa_random_acts_of_pizza_is_open_again/", "created_utc": 1543191667.0, "score": 198, "author": "SantaHQ", "num_comments": 91, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/a0e3n7/psa_random_acts_of_pizza_is_open_again/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

On the way to work, my wife got mugged for her iPod (she was okay). At the end of her shift, she got laid off. On her way to get her bike so she could go home, she discovered she had a flat tire and her sister had to take her home. When my wife got home, she discovered that I, too, had been laid off. Yep, we got laid off on the exact same day. Thankfully, we didn't have any children yet.\n\nWe sat there in silence just watching TV for a couple hours, not really saying much. I decided to post on this sub to see if my sob story could earn me a pizza, and sure enough, it did.

{"title": "[Meta] tips for givers (and recipients)", "selftext": "Hey guys, I see some new faces around giving out pizzas and it warms my cold, black heart. \n\nJust wanted to share some tips and practices that I use when giving pizzas, feel free to use them or ignore them, it's up to you. Everyone has a system that works for them. \n\nWhen I give pizza, I almost exclusively use one of the big 3 for several reasons. \n\nFirst, they're everywhere. Second, they all have online apps and rewards programs. Who doesn't like free pizza? Also, they all allow for CC payment on the apps. If you want, gift cards are a great option too, with Pizza Hut allowing you to buy eGift cards direct to email. If I do that, I have them sent to myself and provide the gift card number to my pizza recipient. \n\nWhen using the app, I always, always change the name on the order. Reddit is a community based on anonymity and none of you need to know that I may or may not be Bill Gates. I find Leeroy Jenkins or Ric Flair to be good choices and often elicit a chuckle. Phone number is a bit more important on delivery orders, so if you desire, get the number of your recipient to add to the order. \n\nBot commands are hard. See: [practical bot examples](http://reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/w/howto_bot)\n\nRecipients- when posting photo [thanks] verification, do two things. First, pull any order stickers off of the box. Fun information like your address may be on it and I'd hate to get drunk and send you [glitter](https://www.ruindays.com/collections/all/products/glitter-everywhere-card). Secondly, go to the rules and follow them for [thanks] posts. Also, the most commonly used method for posting the photo is using Imgur. Google \"imgur upload,\" follow the prompts and copy/pasta into the text box of your [thanks] post. \n\nBe gracious. Thank your recipient. They fed you and quieted the growls emitting from your tummy. \n\nLastly, be kind to each other.\n\nPeace, love and Pizza", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/eh2apy/meta_tips_for_givers_and_recipients/", "created_utc": 1577598488.0, "score": 179, "author": "toomanydeployments", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/eh2apy/meta_tips_for_givers_and_recipients/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Something of a rant...", "selftext": "First, I want to say that I believe in my heart that there are some good, honest, decent folks out there, and a lot of them are on Reddit... even hanging out here.  And there are a lot of trolls, too.  This is for them:\n\nGuys, a lot of the people requesting Pizzas here are genuinely hungry.  Some of us are tight on money and can't afford it ourselves, or even to go to the grocery store.  You might think you're being funny or cute to offer pizzas and then reneg on your offer (or worse, send an eGift card and then cancel it. You'll be pleased to know that I was pretty embarassed on that one).  The thing is... when you offer a pizza, plans change. I've turned down offers of food from friends or family members because I thought a good samaritan was doing something nice for a stranger.  And when nothing happens... well, it's embarassing for me (especially when I tell my wife and toddler \"Can we wait a bit longer before giving up? We should be getting a code for pizza any minute now...\").  Anyway... the reason I'm writing this is because I think the trolling is getting out of hand here. Over the past few weeks I've had four offers for pizza, and of the four, **ONLY ONE** was genuine.\n\nI just got trolled again tonight. This time, my 2 year old son wound up going to bed without supper.\n\nFolks, it's just **not funny**.  And RAOP isn't fun anymore.\n\n**EDIT:** Actually, my wife and son are with her folks now getting some food. So there's that, at least.\n\n**EDIT 2:** I've had several very generous offers as a result of this thread. As I've said, I've made alternate plans for myself tonight (and I'm getting ready to head on out), but I also see a lot of other hungry folks out there.  Please consider extending your generosity out to them.\n\n**FINAL EDIT:** Somehow, this thread has degenerated into a screed about my financial situation or parenting ability. That was not my intent -- nor is this post about karma or getting offers of pizza (every one of which, while GREATLY appreciated, has been declined).  My entire point is (and always has been) that if you make a **promise** to send a pizza, please do so. \n\nIt's not about being upset that a [REQUEST] was ignored. That wouldn't have bothered me.\n\nIt's not about being upset that replies to [OFFER]s were ignored.  Again, that wouldn't have bothered me.\n\nIt's about promises being made (causing me to stop looking for other alternatives) and then *broken* after stringing me along for *hours.*  And that's not cool.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ihoap/something_of_a_rant/", "created_utc": 1309913488.0, "score": 155, "author": "Doombuggyman", "num_comments": 165, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ihoap/something_of_a_rant/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "[META] PLEASE READ!!! Information for Givers/Offerers.", "selftext": "    This post will be updated as needed (updated 11/7/2013) \n\nYour incredible acts of generosity have kept us growing at an incredible pace. In the short time I've been here, the subreddit has nearly doubled in subscribers. We have been featured in several media outlets, numerous /r/bestof threads, and countless person to person referrals of the \"magic\" that goes on here. All this attention has brought it's share of more incredible givers, new requesters, and just like anything else, dishonest people that are looking for ways to game and scam the system. \n\n\n\n**The only real way to combat these lowlifes is with an increased awareness in verifying who you are giving to.**\n\nList of things to look for and best practices:\n\n* **Account Name** - Verify that the person you are intending to give to is the person you are corresponding with. **The easiest way to do this is to PM them first!!!** I personally will not reply to any request related PMs unless I first initiated it. Use the [messages view in your inbox](http://i.imgur.com/mFOTk7Z.png) to help with this. It puts a conversation in a thread, with your portion in green text. The nature of way Reddit is setup allows for easy anonymity among its users. One of the things that makes Reddit great for some subs but troubling for ours is that throwaway accounts are so easy to create. People who are scamming generally create accounts similar to the ones intended to be given to by givers (for instance I am /u/OliverTw1st, a scammer might make an account called /u/0liverTw1st in an attempt to trick the giver.) The vast majority of transactions that occur are by sending e-gift cards directly to the recipient's email address and once they have gotten the e-gift card, it is used almost immediately. **The moderators and admins can't help once the order has been placed, and usually the companies that the GC are ordered through won't offer refunds or reversals onces the GC has been redeemed. If you feel you have been scammed, contact the GC company immediately!**\n\n* **Account History** - Specifically AGE. **Scammers accounts are typically less than a day old, because they were created to look similar to the recipient that they just found out about.** We enforce \na 60 day account age minimum for posts and encourage gifters to use one when choosing a recipient as well. It takes less than 10 seconds to click on someone's account name and [verify their age in the top right of their profile screen](http://i.imgur.com/UONGNa7.png). If you use something like[ RES \\(Reddit Enhancement Suite\\)](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/), you can just[ mouse hover over their name](http://i.imgur.com/oHJtMt4.png) and it will tell you the account age as well. \n\n* **Contests/Offers** - When you choose a recipient for your contest/offer, don't announce it publicly until you have made contact (by PM'ing them first) with the intended recipient. You can edit your post to add something like \"Winner chosen, PM'ing them now\" and go back and fill in the winner or comment on their comment in the thread once you have made the transaction. **It's a lot harder for scammers to impersonate someone if they don't know who to impersonate.**\n\n* **When Responding on a thread** - Use the receiver's account name somewhere in your public response to the thread. If it's someone's request, say \"PMing you now (account name)\". If it's a contest/offer you are doing, you can also do that or edit your post to reflect you you gave to. **This helps us track the people who delete their posts to try to hide history of receiving.** They cannot remove your comments or posts that have their account name listed in them.\n\n* **When you've completed a transaction** - Message the mods. Please include a link to the thread. We can then assign you and the receiver the appropriate flair. It also helps us establish a record when investigating deleted posts. \n \n* **When in doubt** - Message the mods **BEFORE making a transaction** if you have any questions. We are here to help make the RAoP experience a good one. [Message us from the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) or stop in to the [IRC Channel](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com/chat). There is usually someone around that can help. We do volunteer our time between work, sleeping and life in general, but we are pretty good at getting back to you within a reasonable amount of time. We will do what we can to help but as stated earlier, once the transaction has been completed, we can't really do anything about it. \n\n[**Random Acts of Pizza**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza/) is an amazing community made up of Redditors from all over the globe and all walks of life, brought together by the simple fact that **MOAR pizza makes the world a better place**. RAoP has the most subscriptions of any Random Acts subreddit and is in my opinion one of the top (and easily the most thoughtful) reasons why Reddit is such an awesome social experiment in the digital age. **Our success can be solely pointed to our givers that make our subreddit such an amazing place and their generosity is responsible for helping to restore people's faith in humanity on a daily basis.** \n\nIn the year or so that I have been involved with RAoP, I have seen unbelievable acts of kindness on behalf of you all. From the truly random (and sometimes bizarre) request for pizza fulfilled, helping a fellow Redditor who is down on their luck, contests that spark the creatively genius and hilarious entries from participants, and most recently the tremendous out pour of relief during tragedies. We may only make the news from time to time, but I have the privilege of witnessing it every day. I am honored and grateful to be a part of RAoP and **it's people like yourselves that I have to thank for showing me just how amazing humans can be to eachother.** \n\nThanks for reading this.

Single mom yadda yadda yadda.\n\nSo anyway, I work at a motel, and every time there is a delivery to our motel from Papa John's, they will sign a little piece of paper with the pizza box sticker sticker and a signature on it - once we reach 10, we get a free pizza. Each desk clerk has their own signature sheet.\n\nSo anyway, I had been saving up for a few months, because I only work a few days every few weeks [my mom is the manager and I get called in when I am needed]. Honestly, I usually sit at the bottom of the stairs when I see the Papa John's guy on the camera with my paper and a pen because sometimes [ie. most of the time] they'll leave without signing/giving the sticker because then they get to save them and use them basically like cash around the motels. So anyway, dedication went into saving up for this free pizza. \n\nFinally, I got it. I had worked SO HARD for this and I finally got it. \n\nUntil last night. Last night, at work, a woman had come in, she was adorable with an ADORABLE daughter, who decided to tell me about why she was at the motel. She had 80 dollars to her name and was trying to escape her abusive husband, and didn't have enough money to feed her child. A room at the motel is normally 59.95+ tax [67.75 all together] and I gave her the room for 35.95 all together.\n\nI mentioned this in my last post, but I'm a single mom in college, and I'm pretty broke as well, but you know what?

What you CAN do is calm down a bit and accept why RAOP was created in the first place.\n\nRemember why redditors first started donating pizzas? It wasn't targeting people who had NOTHING. It was targeting people who had very little, who were down to their last few dollars and looking for ideas on how to spend them wisely until their next paycheck. The response was often a kind soul who just wanted to brighten a stranger's day.\n\nYes, some people have basic food, enough to barely get by. But RAOP was never supposed to be for people who have NOTHING left. (If you have NOTHING left, there are food assistance programs out there, and you should be going there, not Reddit.) It was supposed to give people a chance to enjoy some comfort food that they generally couldn't afford, to make someone smile when they were down and the world was kicking them in the nuts.\n\nAnd now I get to see posts like \"Hey, if you have ramen, just shut up and eat it.\"\n\nHere's my suggestion: stop worrying about whether someone deserves a pizza. That's not to say you shouldn't take common sense steps to ensure someone isn't scamming mounds of free food from multiple suckers, but let's all stop judging whether any one person has suffered enough to deserve some comfort food. If they're not a scammer, then they summoned the courage and humility to ask strangers for help, and I think that should be enough to expect good people, the kind of people who frequent RAOP, to respond.\n\nIt's time to expect the best of people. After all, if people weren't good at their core, RAOP wouldn't exist.\n\nHave a great day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j15iv/i_worry_that_raop_is_losing_its_soul/", "created_utc": 1311774801.0, "score": 128, "author": "None", "num_comments": 119, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j15iv/i_worry_that_raop_is_losing_its_soul/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "[Request] I'm angry and it's my birthday. Anyone wanna help a guy out?", "selftext": "So context: I'm a 23-year-old with Cerebral Palsy. I am in a wheelchair and attend the University of Illinois. I'm currently in my Senior year of Undergrad. About six months ago, my main wheelchair started shorting out (it would stop moving every time I went over a bump.) It got so bad the first week of school this year that I decided to switch from my primary chair to my five-year-old outdated chair that my Dad fixed up enough to use as a backup (he's an engineer, he can do that). Then, at the beginning of September, the wheelchair people called and said \"Hey, we fixed your chair!\" I was overjoyed. My folks brought it down and it worked fine until they left. Then, I decided to leave my phone on the charger, because I'm a moron and went to Walgreens to get some stuff I needed. I got trapped in the Walgreens and had to have a random stranger manually push me home and help me back into the five-year-old piece of junk (which, by the way, I will always be endlessly thankful for). Save for taking it into a local chair shop, the main chair has been sitting in the corner of my room facing the wall [like a disobedient child](https://imgur.com/gallery/GzyTSfG) for about a month, give or take. The shop isolated the problem to be the controller, so they were going to get me a new controller. This was, again, about last month. Two weeks ago, we learned that nobody in the Chicago office placed the order for anything at all for no good reason, so then we had to wait even longer. That brings us to today, my 23rd birthday. I was all ready to go with my buddy to the shop to get the chair fixed because they finally had sent it. [I got this text from my Mom.](https://imgur.com/a/zYr9O1a) They, once again, didn't ship the controller. So I don't get to get my chair fixed for another week at least.

Perhaps others have more tips, but I'll start.\n\n**Read the sidebar** - Seriously. You wouldn't walk into a dry-cleaners and expect ice-cream. If you walked into someone's home or business and wanted something from them, you'd follow their rules and requests. Otherwise you could expect to be ignored or thrown out. Are you being ignored? ***READ THE SIDEBAR!***  It says to include your location. Hello? So include your location! How much tougher is it to say \"I need a pizza in Southern Oklahoma\" than to say \"I need a pizza.\" ????  \n\nTake a good look at the requests that don't get responded to. You'll see three things that commonly result in being ignored. \n\n1) **You will generally be ignored if you don't include your location.** This will get you ignored by about half the givers. They don't want to have a 5-part back-and-forth conversation just to find out you're in South Thunderpack Norway where they can't get you a friggin pizza.\n\n2) **You will generally be ignored if you use a throwaway.** Pizza givers like to see that they have a good chance of actually helping someone in need, not just feeding some scammer who worked up a good story. They will read your history. If you've got no history, they move on.\n\n3) **You will generally be ignored if you come across as just too lazy to go get your own damned pizza.** \"Hey, I'm on my way home from my $75k job, and I'm just too busy to pull my SUV off at the Domino's and get a pizza. I'd rather have somebody buy me one so I can eat as soon as I get home.\"  -or- \"Duuuuuddddde -- I am SO STONED and I've got the munchies big time.

{"title": "[OFFER]{Valentine\u2019s Day} Cupid\u2019s a bitch, but hunger\u2019s an asshole.", "selftext": "Yeah, it\u2019s *that* time of year again.  \n\nThe one day out of the year florists and chocolatiers make over 40% of their annual gross income in a single 24-hour period. Unfortunately for the single population out there, this is the one day hand-crafted by fate\u2019s ugly hands to simply remind them of their single status, and once again pierce their hearts with that infernal sword of loneliness. It sucks, I know \u2013 I\u2019ve been there. Being single on Valentine\u2019s Day is akin to spending Christmas or New Year\u2019s alone; not fun. But don\u2019t worry, my lonely friends. RAoP is here to help you. This Valentine\u2019s Day won\u2019t suck, at least, not *as* much.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway\u2014one of colossal proportions. In fact, it\u2019s so big, we had to stretch it out over the entire day. Ah, \u201cwe?\u201d you might ask? Yes. WE\u2013**WE.** As you read on, you\u2019ll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentine\u2019s Day less shitty. Before you continue on to the part where you read the guidelines (which, so help me, you *will* read) on how to acquire your pizza, please take the time to recognize this all-star squad of RAoPers who are taking the time to serve you.\n\nThe roster, in no particular order:\n\n[PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread), [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack), [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch), [jetboyterp](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp), [badbrownie](http://www.reddit.com/user/badbrownie), [chupanibre25](http://www.reddit.com/user/chupanibre25), [toncinap](http://www.reddit.com/user/toncinap), [overripebanana](http://www.reddit.com/user/overripebanana), [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), [tanyagal2](http://www.reddit.com/user/tanyagal2), [CheeseGamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/CheeseGamer), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [fordandt]( http://www.reddit.com/user/fordandt), [m2mu](http://www.reddit.com/user/m2mu), [kencater](http://www.reddit.com/user/kencater), [MonkeyHouse](http://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeyHouse), [Cacoo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cacoo), [awana56](http://www.reddit.com/user/awana56), [aghos](http://www.reddit.com/user/aghos), [Madamrimbaud](http://www.reddit.com/user/Madamrimbaud), [Supersized](http://www.reddit.com/user/Supersized), [Coasttocoaster](http://www.reddit.com/user/Coasttocoaster), [TokenFemale](http://www.reddit.com/user/TokenFemale), [Drolsonator](http://www.reddit.com/user/Drolsonator)\n\n(Givers, *please* tell me if I missed your name.)\n\n**Guidelines**\n\nSo, you want a pizza, yes? Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to **post a pic of yourself with a sign reading \u201cRAOP, will you be my Valentine?\u201d** Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor\u2019s name, course number\u2014whatever. Get creative; it\u2019s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don\u2019t lie, we know you have one). This is *not* a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.\n\nOne of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we\u2019ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who\u2019s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner\u2014either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. **Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.**\n\n**Protip:** If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you\u2019ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I\u2019m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we\u2019re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.\n\n **Couples**\n\nWe haven\u2019t forgotten about you; don\u2019t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there\u2019s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, *however*, since I don\u2019t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., **your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other *physical* (operative word here) affection**. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won\u2019t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want\u2026*rubs hands together deviously*), whatever\u2014just show us that you\u2019re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nAs one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we\u2019ve put together for this event, you\u2019d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won\u2019t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock. \n\nAs King Th\u00e9oden, son of Thengel, said: *\u201cLet them come.\u201d*\n\nAlso, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we\u2019re fresh out of fucks\u2014we\u2019re giving out pizza, bitches.\n\n**TL;DR:** Start at the top.\n\n**Special thanks**\n\nI would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I\u2019ve come across in real life.\n\nMy deepest thanks and gratitude to [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack) for coming up with the whole Valentine\u2019s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guy\u2014he deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadn\u2019t done so, I would\u2019ve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I can\u2019t thank you enough.\n\nI would also like to thank [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread) who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably would\u2019ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole \u201chow\u201d aspect to this endeavor and I really don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve figured this thing out without him.\n\n[Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch). Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there\u2019s a fair amount of magic involved.\n\nLast but not least, let\u2019s give it up for our fearless mods, [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [Rollout]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), and [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause. Pasta also deserves our thanks for his efforts in promoting this event and coordinating with mods from other subreddits to get the word out.\n\n**TL;DR2:** No, you have to read this one too.\n\nEdit: Props to snang for putting up the sweet layout.\n\nEdit2: Work now, might try to squeeze one in at lunch. People I'm still waiting on to hear back on, I'll check in from time to time. Other givers, have at it.\n\nEdit3: Just checking in on break, looking good so far. Keep up the good work givers. Also, all you foreveralone folks, after browsing all of your pics, how the hell are *any* of you single? You're all gorgeous!\n\nEdit4: Quick check in on break. Good news for requestors, to be honest, I don't even think we've given away half of what we pooled together. Foreveralone crowd, you should take advantage of this opportunity and browse the other singles, there are some lookers out there.

If you read it to the end, thank you so much for doing so. \n\nOur family is in need of a real meal. We're struggling pretty hard right now. There are 2 main reasons for this: I lost a major contract that I was sure was rock solid, and I am currently drowning in the dreck waters of a major depressive episode. I have Bi-polar II, and I feel like this current episode is trying to end my life completely. \n\nI am so embarrassed of my limitations right now. I'm ashamed to admit that I have fallen so low. I have been trying to claw my way out of this massive pit of despair and depression ever since I got the news about my contract but I'm not doing well right now. 'We' are trying a new medication for me, because my previous meds stopped helping, but so far they are doing nothing. The depression is way harder to treat than the hypomanic stuff is, apparently. \n\nTo briefly explain myself, I sit up in bed every morning with so much despair inside of me that it's like the world is ending.  I try to decide what my reason will be for getting out of bed that day, what I can focus on, and then I focus as hard has I can on that reason and I drag myself up and out of the womb and into the day. But sometimes I can't. Lately, I mostly can't, or only can for a little while before I end up in my safety nest on my sofa, with the black cloud suffocating my thoughts again. \n\nCooking is out of my reach right now. I couldn't stop sobbing for almost 3 hours earlier today, and it was because I couldn't handle making some damn grilled cheese sandwiches. My face looks like the StayPuff Marshmallow Man, right now. My partner wanted to take me to the ER, but that's just silly to me.  What would I say to them, that I can't quit crying because I feel like the world is ending, and that everything I love will be taken away from me? That my kids are almost all grown now, they barely seem to need me anymore, and I feel like I have no purpose in life? I sound  pathetic even to myself. \n \nMy partner is **not** a cook. No one else in the family is, aside from me, they'd burn water. All our bills were just due, and there is just zero money for takeout after I've lost my contract and we're temporarily down to single income.  The rest of my family can only eat so many grilled cheese sandwiches. They've been doing it all week. \n\nI **know** we can't afford to order pizza today, but pizza sounds so good today, with *vegetables*..  I hope that doesn't sound like begging, it just sounds delicious. I personally haven't had anything \"real\" to eat in such a long time ( because of the %=&# depression), and my family would love pizza for dinner, of course.  I hope someone can help, but either way, thank you very much for reading this far down. Not everyone would do that.\n\nEdit: removed compromising info that could get me doxxed.

My father has even gone through my room when I'm out of the house. I feel like I have no privacy and nothing left to lose if they find out. Hopefully someone out there has been in this position before. I'm nervous, scared, and feeling like this is going to be the last meal I have in the house. I know there are others out there who may have a real need for a meal tonight, but I'm simply here to request a pizza as comfort food. My name is Ben and I live in Bellevue, WA. I am proud of who I am and I am no longer going to continue hiding the truth. Thank you for reading my wall of text.\n\nI didn't know where to post my update either in the comments or to edit this post. Well, my parents came home and my aunt came over. I told my parents that I had something important to share with them and that I wanted to be completely honest with them. After telling both of them I was gay, dad began screaming at me. Mom just sat there for a minute before she started crying. When I saw how upset she was, I started to cry too. Dad meanwhile was telling me how disgusting I am and that all gay people should burn in hell. I tried to calm him down, but at one point he raised his hand at me and my aunt told him not to hit me. My aunt got in between us and I really think he would have hit me. He took a deep breath and stormed out of the house. Mom got up and ran to her bedroom. My aunt said that I did the right thing and that she was going to speak with my mom. I'm sitting here now shaking, because I don't feel safe. I feel like I've done something horrible. I can still hear mom crying. I shouldn't have done this. I've destroyed my family tonight. \n\nI don't feel safe staying here, so I'll be staying at my aunts house tonight. I'm hoping mom and dad will at least talk to me tomorrow. Neither of my parents have ever lifted a hand to me and I'm worried that things got out of control so fast. I have my bag packed and I'm ready to leave. Thank you all for your support and kind words. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but I just hope they'll at least talk to me peacefully.

In order to win in the contest,  you have to go to Dominos FB page, 'Like' it, add their app, and then get the highscore in a pizza-arcade-shooting game with Noid. It's not too hard, while I was playing the highscore was usually around 300,000.\n\nThe trick is, shoot the pizzas/tomatoes as fast as possible, because they are worth more. Don't hit anything with the Noid face on it, or Noid himself, or not a tomato or pizza. I'm not sure if there was a bonus for hitting pizzas so many times in a row. You have a 'Bomb' meter in the upper right, fill and use it as much as possible. The games are short, the maximum amount of times you can use the Bomb meter is about 3. Hit all the tomatoes too, if you don't, you lose points. Practice makes perfect! Also, you may have to refresh the page after the first game, sometimes it had a game running behind the waiting screen, and it wouldn't count your score if that happened. You can tell by the music.\n\nIt took me about 5-10 minutes to finally win. I had to give them my email, and they sent the giftcard code and pin to my email within a few minutes.

That's great and all, and it makes it really easy for me and the recipient at the door. But then they are faced with an interesting conundrum.\n\nThey get asked to sign for it. Okay, so what do you do? It seems like most people tip a little bit, understanding it is where most of our income comes from. But how much, if any, do you give using someone else's money?\n\nThe great thing is, you can leave a tip while ordering online, and the recipient can avoid the entire awkward situation, while I don't curse in my car for not making money. The option should be available when entering your credit card info. And if you're ordering over the phone, you can tell them you would like to add a tip. Anything works, and it'll make a second person's day even more awesome.\n\nI do hope this post doesn't come across as pretentious, and if this issue has come across in another post I apologize.

I\u2019m making this post due to the fact that.... 2019 was the year I made my reddit account. Prior to that, I had no other form of a community besides the one I am in personally. You guys are what makes the world go round, and I\u2019ve never seen such camaraderie except in the military. \n\nWith all this being said, if shit goes hype, I\u2019ve left my 3 franchise locations to my son-in-law. I\u2019ve left all forms of communication (emails, etc) to my wife. I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ll be gone for, but I\u2019ll be off of reddit for a couple months. \n\nI love you guys, and I hope to see y\u2019all soon. \n\nu/toomanydeployments, love you buddy.

{"title": "[Meta] Why pizza?", "selftext": "I only just discovered this subreddit last night, and I think it's fantastic. But it got me thinking... why pizza? Why not gift cards for grocery stores or something? And I think I get it. And maybe if someone sees this who wonders the same thing, they'll get it, too.\n\nAt the times that I've been struggling financially (and it's pretty frequent at the end of a pay period), if I were to receive a gift card for a grocery store or find a $20 bill, I'd be spending it on ramen, day-old bread, and anything else cheap that can last. And that's cool, and I'd be grateful, but I'd still be kinda bummed about going through a rough spot.\n\nBut pizza is normal. Pizza is happy. Pizza is a tiny, relatively inexpensive luxury. You get a pizza delivered to your house, and you're still struggling, but you don't *feel* poor. You have **pizza**.\n\nAnd then, a couple of weeks later, you're doing a little better financially, and you remember how happy that pizza made you, so you want to make someone else feel like that, so you pay it forward. And then someone else gets to feel a little better about life.\n\nSo why pizza? Because it's more than just feeding someone who's hungry. You get to give them a little slice of normal and happy along with filling their tummy with warm, cheesy goodness. I'm telling everyone I know about this subreddit, in the hopes that they will spread the happiness.\n\nTL;DR: Why pizza?

{"title": "[PSA] RAoP is back online! Sorry for the extended downtime!", "selftext": "**Hi pizza lovers, sorry for the extended downtime!** It was a *massive* effort..\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1. **The subreddit stylesheet is no longer dangerous!** \n2. Updated rules, sidebar and  ... everything else\n3. New flair systems (automated with bot)\n4. *The Pizza Library* is public! (our new subreddit wiki) \n5. More prominent scam warnings and new [SCAM] tag for scam reports\n\nTurns out, I was more than a little naive in first estimates, in particular the number of time-consuming things that arose once moving to the real subreddit. A lot has happened behind the scenes since the moderator team was expanded about a year ago, culminating in this massive update... Sorry to remove your 3+ years old sticky post, /u/mcredson.. I've been reluctant to do it, thinking you were going for a world record... ;) \n\nIn the new flair system, we have recorded **11000 pizzas received and 8000 pizzas given** (there is no correlation, the system is far from perfect).. But it's 100% safe to say that more than **10000** pizzas have been gifted in total! That is really impressive, with ~40k subscriber, 1 in 4 got a pie! Thanks for participating!\n\n\n**The closed pizza subreddit**\n\n> When /r/RandomActsOfPizza first closed, we expected it to reopen, but that didn't happen. Welcome to all the new users that have subscribed lately. We've counted post history and flairs in both subreddits, plus resurrected an archive of all the (known) posts to our wiki for transparency.\n\n\n**Subreddit Stylesheet**\n\n> A lot of work went into replacing the stylesheet, no better time to learn about an upcoming [Reddit website makeover](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/).. Anyway, we have new RAoP logo, post icons, link flairs, user flairs, etc. Enjoy it while it looks decent! RES Night mode is recommended!\n\n\n**The Pizza Library**\n\n> [The Pizza Library](/r/RAoPCSS/wiki) is now public, as mentioned in PSA before shutdown. It covers many aspects of participating here, and will be linked from automod comments and to answer common questions in modmail. We hope you find it useful.\n\n\n**New Link Flairs**\n\n> /u/GiversBot now controls link flairs to indicate the status/progress of your post (fulfilled, no longer needed, closed, etc). This is all done with a few intuitive commands that work on any reddit client. The bot also sets link flair when gifts are logged using the bot (more below)\n\n\n**New User Flairs**\n\n> Updating the user flair system was a very extensive process, and there are bound to be issues. We will provide opportunity for users to correct their flairs if history is not accurately represented. The new flairs, and the process of arriving at them, [is described in the Pizza Library User Flairs section](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/userflairs). \n\n\n**Bot**\n\n> *  You can use the bot to control link flair (status) of your own posts. Simply comment ``$closed``, ``$reopen``, ``$expired`` etc to set the corresponding flair. \n\n> * **As a giver** you can log gifts by commenting ``$fulfilled with $15 carryout pizza`` *on a [REQUEST] post*, or comment ``$winner /u/username $15 carryout pizza`` in *your own [OFFER]/[CONTEST]*.\n\n> * **As a requester,** you can log a gift by commenting ``$fulfilled by /u/username $15 carryout pizza`` *in your own [REQUEST] post,* or ``$fulfilled by anonymous $15 carryout pizza`` if the donor wishes to remain anonymous\n\n> * The bot publishes profiles of users that submit posts to the subreddit, showing their complete known history. You can manually request a user's profile by doing ``$check /u/username`` (this report can take 10-15 minutes, depending on workload)\n\n> *(replace $value, description and username as appropriate in the examples above)*\n\n\n\n**Rule Changes**\n\n> 1. We now require a **90 days old account** with **400 comment karma**. for requesting (used to be 60/300). The activity limits are better explained in the wiki than ever before.  \n>  * However, in the coming week(s), we will be *lowering* the karma required to *comment.* Instead of having automoderator globally enforce the 400 comment karma limit, we will enforce it with a separate bot *for giveaway posts only.* This will allow lower-karma users to comment on requests without moderator approval (we will review these comments still)\n\n> 2. You are not allowed to post a request or enter giveaways for **90 days** after receiving a pizza, and **7 days** after an unfulfilled request (used to be 14/3).\n\n> 3. Documenting transactions is now a rule (anonymous gifts are possible), as is posting [THANKS] with verification photo when gifted.\n\n(Some other rewording/combining/changes has taken place as well, but those are the major items)\n\n**RAoP By Numbers**\n\n> We used to have approx 9000 users flaired (total), and we recovered approx 2000 from our archive of /r/RandomActsOfPizza. By flairing from post history and other methods, we now have 15000 users flaired (givers and recipients). Plus we have flaired an additional 35000 users that have no specific record of pizzas given/received (but they have commented/posted in the sub). Total flairs handed out is approx 50k. \n\n**In conclusion**\n\nPlease be patient while we iron final things out, and report issues you come across. I've been to 4 different countries in the time I worked on this, so there are probably things that have been left out..\n\n**Looking forward to hear from you - thanks for reading & participating!**\n\nIf you are still here - and you want a pizza tonight - say something nice about this makeover while I go eat cold pizza leftovers from yesterday... ;)\n\n(Domino's or Papa John's, US only!)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5w1vgb/psa_raop_is_back_online_sorry_for_the_extended/", "created_utc": 1487990505.0, "score": 89, "author": "SantaHQ", "num_comments": 149, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/5w1vgb/psa_raop_is_back_online_sorry_for_the_extended/", "html_title": ""}

I have confirmed this information, and wanted to be sure before I posted this. Any questions about this please pm me.\n\nCashStar even asked a few redditors if they were from Random Acts Of Pizza, and they support our cause!\n\nThis also tells us that CashStar has our back!!!!

{"title": "[OFFER - CONTEST] Let's play pizza party scavenger hunt. Lot's of people ask for free pizza. Anyone willing to play a game for the chance to win a you call it $100 pizza party?", "selftext": "**The basics**\n\nThe game is a scavenger hunt. If you're not familiar with scavenger hunts you should get out of the house more, but the basic idea is below is a list of ten (10) items not commonly found in every day life for you to seek out and find. First one to collect all ten items wins a $100 gift card to the pizza place of your choice (only restriction is that I must be able to buy you a gift card online with relative ease. I'm looking big three U.S. but if you're international or have a local spot I'll work with you as we can.).\n\n**The rules**\n\nFind all ten (10) items listed below. Take a picture of the item with a slip of paper next to it with your user name, the phrase \"pizza party scavenger hunt\" and the date next to it. Upload your pictures to an album on a picture hosting site (imgur, photobucket, whatever). First person to find all ten with their pictures properly processed wins a $100 gift card to the pizza place of their choice. Mods may impose additional rules at their discretion and as always 60 days or older accounts only can win. In the event more than one person has completed the hunt prior to my declaring a winner the first person in/posted wins.\n\n**Specifics**\n\nNo photoshopping obviously. The idea is to find the actual physical items. If I suspect photoshopping I reserve the right to DQ anyone. If I DQ you you can appeal to me by PM and send another photo if there is some debate but I reserve right to final ruling. So make it obvious it's a real photo. Your face etc need not be in the photo, just the slip of paper. Same for the requirements of people in the photo, feel free to blur faces. You are welcome to recruit friends to help so not all photos/papers need to have the same handwriting. Get your friends to help you. The prize is a pizza party anyways - you're not really going to eat $100 of pizza by yourself are you? I will check back Sunday (8 June) night my time (in Hawaii, USA) to see if I have a winner. If so they will be notified of their win via PM and then it published. If not, I will continue checking day to day until someone does win with the same protocol being followed.\n\n**The scavenger list**\n\n1.

Congratulations to them. I'll post their username after they claim (IAW the sub's guidelines to ensure he is the one I give the pizza to). Sorry about the delay (I know I said Sunday night) in declaring a winner, I had some work/personal life stuff come up that kept me from my lazy man reddit time. Thanks everyone for playing and I hope the winner enjoys his free pizza. It was fun and I'll do it again sometime. Thanks as well to the nice guy as well who gave me gold.

Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly.

I can\u2019t afford it.", "selftext": "So I feel really weird posting this, but I\u2019d heard of this sub so I thought, why not?\n\nSome context though, lockdown has hit me hard. Over the past 2 months, I\u2019ve lost my girlfriend, my home, my job, my kitten, and control of my mental health.\n\nI had a really bad mental illness episode, and as a result my girlfriend left me. I had to move out of our house, and I\u2019m currently staying in my sister\u2019s guest room. My kitten stayed with her as I couldn\u2019t have pets at my sister\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019ve been furloughed since March, and learned last week I was being made redundant, and I\u2019ve been paying through the nose for a house I\u2019m no longer living in, so I\u2019m broke.\n\nThroughout all this, I\u2019ve been changing medication for my depression, because my therapist believes that might have been the cause of my episodes, so my mental state has been all over the place.\n\nSo there\u2019s the wider context, now for the pizza context.\n\nMy sister and her other half have been in the process of buying a house, today they finally finalised. To celebrate they ordered themselves pizza.\n\nI\u2019ve had an awful, no good day. I had to go back to my old house to pick up the last of my things, and as I\u2019m coming off the meds I\u2019m currently on, the feels became too much and I broke down In front of my ex.\n\nOn top of this, my best friend\u2019s Nan tried to kill herself last night, and as selfish as i know it is, I\u2019ve been struggling to be there for her while my mind is trying to eat itself.\n\nSo when I got home, and my sister and her SO had pizza, it was like the cherry on top of a shit cake day. I\u2019d love a pizza, but I can\u2019t afford it, and I can\u2019t ask them for one, as they\u2019ve already done so much for me.\n\nSo I thought, why not ask the internet?

Cool, that's like a reverse contest! **5** of those requests are truly random with neutral^\\* titles. An overwhelming **32** of those requests have titles that are written in a way that begs sympathy on behalf of a viewer.\n\n^\\* (Note: If it wasn't clear to me if a title was neutral or seemed written to elicit sympathy, I categorized it based on the text within. If a request appeared random, I didn't look closer.)\n\nIs everybody okay with this?\n\nRAoP is not /r/foodpantry or /r/assistance, the purpose for RAoP is **Random** giving. Personally, I'd like to see that. Random.\n\nInstead, I experience a numbing effect as my eyes glaze over constant pleas for Pizza, advertising the sort of dire need that neither I, nor a Pizza, can begin to address.\n\nSo I ask again, **32** of **38** current requests are not, in the spirit of this subreddit, Random.\n> Is everybody okay with this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/xflah/meta_where_has_the_random_gone/", "created_utc": 1343709042.0, "score": 84, "author": "None", "num_comments": 55, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/xflah/meta_where_has_the_random_gone/", "html_title": ""}

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/n7tlzq/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1620493511.0, "score": 78, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/n7tlzq/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Inverse acts of pizza", "selftext": "So I was just heading to the corner store just now and saw the pizza delivery guy get out of his car and trudge towards me. Poor dude looked so sad, kinda touched me a little. I felt like I should do something for this poor man. Obviously approaching middle age, and for reasons unknown stuck working this crappy job. Or maybe it's a second job that he has to work at night to pay for medcine for a sick child... who knows. The look on this face shows it could be many things, nothing or that he was simply having a bad, bad day. \n\nA few meters down the road I saw his car and realise he'd delivered to our house many times (it's the best pizza place in town). Tipping in my country just doesn't happen. It's not protocol, so on my way out of the store I remembered this thread and thought: \"Why not an act of kindness for the one who brings us such nice, soothing treats\". So, as I walk past his car, I glance around to make sure he's not around and slip a $10 in the windshield wiper (all the cash I had). Then, like a creature of the night, I slink back into the shadows. \n\nI walk up the street a little, to the corner of my road and stand in the shadow of a large house where I can see his car clearly, but cannot be seen. There are other people walking around and I want to make sure he gets the money, not some passer by. \n\nAfter a while I see him emerge from the house he was in. Slouching along slowly, cap brim bent down, almost vertical. His tall frame hunched and a red pizza carrier limply dangling from his right hand. He approaches the car from the front. I'd put the money on the drivers side to make sure he sees it, at least when he's in the car it would be obvious, but from his angle of approach, and the fact that the car is directly under a street light, I can tell that he will spot it as soon as he's within 4 or 5 feet of the car. \n\nAs he gets closer I tense up. What if he spots me? What will his reaction to finding free money be? Will I make someones day just that little bit more bearable?  All of these things flash though my mind and suddenly I feel that this gesture has become all about me and making myself feel good! I'm conflicted. My conscience pulled this way and that. Did I do this for the pizza guy, for myself, or both? \n\nThe last things I remember are a thundering of deep horns and flashing lights. Have I been spotted, or is it my confuddled mind playing tricks on me? I stare into the lights and see teeth. Familiar teeth. They boom at me \"Hey, Detrituss! What are you doing in the shadows! you look like big scary man yes!! HaHaHa!!\". It's my flatmate in his car. He spotted me as he rounded the corner and began tooting and shouting. I glance down the road and see the Pizza man, obviously shocked at the commotion, quickly get in his car and drive away swiftly. As he goes past I can make out through the glare of high-beams the flimsy blue ten dollar note pressed against the glass. \n\nI hope he sees it before it blows away.

{"title": "Announcing the first Annual RAOP V-Day Giveaway! (Details inside)", "selftext": "So today we're announcing the great [RAoP](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza) Valentine's giveaway.  On Valentine's Day, 2/14, we're planning a massive gift card giveaway.  We know that some redditors are foreveralone, so we'd like to try and brighten up your otherwise depressing Valentine's holiday.  I don't have the exact numbers, but we've definitely got over $1000 lined up for sure.  This is going to be MASSIVE, friends.\n\n**The Details:**\n\nIf you are interested in throwing some money into the pot for donations, please PM me (PastafarianTwit) and I can fill you in the details and put you through to the official coordinator, should that be necessary. Keep in mind I'm employed full-time and a full-time grad student, I might be slow to respond, but I WILL respond. Should you wish to sign up for a pizza, we plan on putting up the post for entry on Valentine's morning.  This post is NOT the post to reply to if you want a pizza, this is just to give people ample notification because it's going to be HUGE and we want as many people involved as possible, givers and receivers alike.  Also, I'm hoping that a few more redditors get inspired by what we're doing and decide to pitch in. =)\n\nUnfortunately, this rules out all of you non-US individuals, as these gift cards are US only (sorry, but when you're sending out this many gift cards, you want to make it as easy as possible.)  International people are always welcome on RAoP, however.  These gift cards will be in amounts of $10 for singles and $20 for couples. (If you're a couple requesting $20, we ask that you post a picture of both of you holding a sign with the date and time [Hell, maybe this is a good way to find a Valentine, eh?])\n\n**Testimonials**\n\n\"Due to a garbled interstellar space transmission we have a surplus of pizza gift cards. They're absolutely no use to use in the space future! So, we're just giving them away!\"  -DownSouthDread (he's high right now)\n\n\"Valentine's Day is one of those days where life is either great or crappy.  It's either a reminder of what love you do have, or the love you don't.  After having donated my first few pizzas on RAoP, I realized how much doing one little thing can make such an impact on someone who feels like life isn't going their way.  It wasn't hard to think of a day where more people might feel that way than any other. After seeing all of the other great people on RAoP who donate when they can, I realized that Valentine's Day was the perfect time to get all of the donators together for a huge event the likes of which RAoP hadn't seen.\"  -RobSpewack\n\n\"It's all good\"  -chupanibre25\n\n\"Valentine's Day is supposed to be a day of love and friendship, but for many it can royally suck.

For Valentine's Day, this is one of the greatest days where one can feel better with a gift, for those who're alone or are couples.

Thanks to those three, and to everyone who makes RAoP possible, you're all amazing.\n\nThe **apology** comes because, a month down the line, I'm still unemployed, and still haven't been able to return the favor; I'll be moving soon because I can't afford rent, and bringing my job hunt to a city with better prospects (I love my town, but if I'm going to be effectively homeless and unemployed, I figure it's smarter to do it somewhere with a better chance of changing that; besides, there is no chance for advancement in my field (culinary) in a town this size, whereas in the city I'll be able to work in a 'real' kitchen). What this ads up to is that not only have I not given pizza yet, but I don't see it happening anywhere near as soon as I'd like, and that's the apology.\n\nThe **promise** part is that I do stand by my word, eventually, and as I see it, I owe this community 4 pizzas - one for each of the people who helped me (or gifted in their name, if they prefer, I'll figure that out when I get there ;) and one just cause I really want to give pizza (If delivery places took foodstamps man... ;). \n\nAnyhow, just felt like putting that out there. No more requests, because I've already received a ton (though I'll probably keep entering on random offers, or non-need based competitions, because hey, pizza is awesome...), and it looks like I won't be able to Offer for a while, but I wanted to make a post to all of you saying: Stay Awesome (you're pretty good at it). \n\n**tl;dr Thanks for pizza earlier; sorry I can't give pizza now, I promise that I will give pizza later.

I felt bad so when I got to work I placed and order for closing time (Major chain, It's not free :/), once the time came I hooked his taco pizza up with extras of all the fixings and hid a gift card under the pizza.  Paid for it, punched out and took off to the gas station.  Man, I could tell by the look on his face how much it meant to him that someone out there did this for him, I just wish I could see the reaction on his face when he finds the gift card.  I'm not here for any kind of applaud or hoorahs, just wanted to share that giving feels great and much respect and kudos to those that do RAoP.

{"title": "Don't understand all the unkindnesses on a kindness site...", "selftext": "I came to this site a couple of days ago, specifically because I saw the report on ABC news and wanted to help some hungry folks in a direct and immediate way. (Don't know if you can tell, but I've donated to four different--and very appreciative-- families already.) My point is that no one seems to mind that I'm new here since I'm a \"giver.\"  But why be so harsh on others who also are new, just because they've come to \"receive?\" I'm sure folks like me who saw the news report, etc., would quite possibly mention this site to follks who could use the help. Why do so many insist that recipients be previous Reddit members? A hungry soul is a hungry soul, and folks like me who want to help out the best we can are really turned off by the negativity (and sometimes downright hostility, rudeness and mean-spirited words) of those who seem to have made it their business to inspect every post for possible \"unfairness,\" \"cheating,\" or whatever. Just because someone's been a long-time member of Reddit is no guarantee of their need being legit. And, conversely, just because someone is new to this site doesn't by rights make them a scammer. (I'm not a fake giver just because I'm new here.) I expect we all take a small risk that we're not helping out the neediest when we respond with a pizza, but that's a risk most givers here seem willing to take.  It's a pizza, not the Hope diamond.\n\nIn my opinion, a more beneficial way to enhance this site would be to dispense with the negative and hurtful comments, and to make the instructions WAY easier on newcomer givers like me who had a heck of a time figuring this site out the first day. (I searched blogs for assistance since the FAQs didn't give me the answers I sought, and I found many others who wanted to give but gave up when they couldn't figure it out.)\n\nI think this site has the makings of something truly wonderful; just how about making it a more positive experience for all?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ip4iz/dont_understand_all_the_unkindnesses_on_a/", "created_utc": 1310616818.0, "score": 75, "author": "fordandt", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ip4iz/dont_understand_all_the_unkindnesses_on_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "[REQUEST] Unfortunate cyclist in need of some temporary help", "selftext": "I'm located in Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\nPlaces that deliver: Dominoes, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Mazzios, Marcos, and Hungry Howies. \n\nStory time! TL;DR at the bottom\n\nSo [awhile ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/whichbike/comments/9a90cg/looking_for_a_very_entry_level_bike_for_commuting/) I took to reddit for advice on a new bike for commuting to work. I ended up getting a good quality one and have been riding it for the last 10 months consistently. Besides [breaking my pinky](https://i.imgur.com/A0jIm2o.png) back in November (my own fault), everything has been great. I've even lost weight!\n\nWe moved back in March so my commute has doubled from 5 to 10miles daily. Normally this isn't a problem on the bike (the inclines are murder). However, walking now takes 1h 30m compared to the 38m before. I either have my bike or have to pay $10 to Uber to work or else the dreaded 3h combined walk in Oklahoma heat ensures. Normally this goes fine but today was a different story...\n\nI left my house at 6:15 as per usual to get to my 7AM shift. I think I made it not even a full mile before I had to turn around and come home. There is an [intersection](https://i.imgur.com/39lL8gP.jpg) leading out of my neighborhood that isn't as busy as the main roads. I usually ride on the path through the park [next to the road](https://i.imgur.com/pCqXUZa.jpg). I cross at that intersection because it's less dangerous than down the street at the main road. Well at least I thought so...\n\nTurns our when you casually cross the road on a green and someone is too busy on their phone, things don't go well. I went to cross as normal but some lady (paying attention to her phone and not the road) ran the red light as I was in the middle of going across. It was way too late to pump the brakes to avoid getting hit so I had to whip my bike sideways and slide past her. \n\nI ate pavement hard. Honestly, I don't remember much other than pulling my bike to the side of the road and sitting down. The lady straight drove off leaving me bleeding on the side of the road. Luckily a truck further down witnessed this and stopped to help me. The nice older gentlemen gave me a ride back to my house and put my bike in the back of his truck. He made sure I was fine before leaving and letting me know he lived around the corner. \n\nNow I sit here, with my face [looking like this](https://i.imgur.com/QOP7CRf.jpg) and my bike [looking like this](https://i.imgur.com/HW8Tc5u.jpg). My face stings like hell but that will be okay. My shoulder, however, is feeling real rough and hurts to move even slightly. What little money I did have I had to use for a visit to urgent care to get it looked at. I didn't dislocate it but it is torn and will take a little but of time to heal.\n\n I can handle pain and recovery just fine, it's the financials that hurts. Breaking my pinky cost me $5,000 that I'm still paying on. And I now have an impressive [$1.02](https://i.imgur.com/R2WJiC6.png) in my bank account and no way to get around. Thankfully my day off is tomorrow so I just need to make it till Friday. \n\n**TL;DR** Some lady almost hit me with her car and now I'm broke (financially and almost physically lol). \n\nI have no money and I usually don't have food here as I can't transport much on a bicycle so I eat at work.

Those who aren't, our very own Gadianton (creator of the sub along with other mods assistance) Anyhow, Gadianton was just interviewed about RAoP.  The story will soon hit the waves worldwide bringing a mass amount of both new requestors and givers.\n\nLately, a lot of questioning/name calling has been tossed out at new members.  We all at one point were new to reddit overall.  Granted *you* may not have signed up for a free pizza but, someone else may have because this is the place they heard about and wanted to try out.  Maybe they join, post a request 5 minutes later and then they explore and learn more about reddit..good for them.  Maybe they will only join for pizza, again..good for them.  \n\nThis story no doubt will bring a growing crowd to our group.  I'd like to ask you all to embrace and make these new members feel welcome.  At the very least, don't make them feel like they are on trail in court.\n\nThe story they will see is about an amazing group of people reaching out and giving to others.  We don't want to give off the impression that we don't like/appreciate/accept newbies.  We want everyone to feel welcome to post here as often as their heart desires.  Thats the cool thing, you can post for whatever reason, how ever many times.  Only ask that you be honest and don't delete posts that have been answered.  \n\nI understand and respect the *reasoning* for the doubts, questions and concerns.  Believe me I do.  However, not every new member is set out to rip you off for a pizza.  We may get some that aren't on the up and up but, don't allow this to allow you to take it out on or assume this about all members.\n\nI am posting this after speaking with Gadianton about the happenings of late.  This community is a wonderfully awesome place.  I'd hate to see it become a place where everyone and everything is questioned or second guessed.\n\nSure, you may find reason or suspect something about a member.  Should this happen, please privately take your concerns to our wonderful mods.  Copy the link and send it to them with a quick \"hey I think they are ripping people off and *insert proof* *this* is why and allow them to handle it.\n\nWe are lucky in the fact that not only our members are awesome, so are our moderators.  This is the type thing they are here for, please bring it to them, allow them to look into it/discuss amongst themselves and do as they see fit on a one by one basis.  \n\nIf you are a giver who wants to see proof, by all means ask for it.  You want a picture, say so.  Also realize not everyone has the ability to provide pictures and their lack of ability to do so, doesn't make them someone not on the up and up.  Be reasonable, remember there is another human with feelings on the other side of the screen.  Think of how you'd feel if someone said/did something the way you are about to, would you like it? If not, chances are the newbie won't either.  \n\nNobody forces anyones hand in giving.  You give to who you choose for whatever reason you choose.  At the end of the day, if you don't like a repeat requestor, a new member just don't give to those people.  Find someone you *do* want to give to.  No need to call people out or make a person feel uncomfortable about doing just what we as a sub say they can do.  Ask whenever/for whatever.

Requesters have the chance to be gifted with tasty pizza, and givers get the chance to help someone out and feel warm and fuzzy about it.\n\nSometimes I see a lot of unanswered requests and it makes me wonder why some requests get offers but not others. \n\nHere are my thoughts: \n\n* The people who give pizza, on the most part, aren\u2019t spectacularly rich or anything. They\u2019re people who are doing ok, or who have an extra bit of money this week, or have a bit of discretionary income. They\u2019re people who are not buying that new pair of shoes/new game/cup of coffee/magazine/expensive food because it\u2019s more fun and rewarding to give pizza. Givers can\u2019t afford to give to everyone, so every giver has their own criteria (and WHATEVER that criteria is, it\u2019s a perfectly fine criteria).\n\n* Posts with only one line requesting a pizza may be more likely to be overlooked because perhaps it\u2019s easy to draw a line between how much effort someone puts into requesting a pizza to how much they want it.\n\n* Similarly, people with accounts which are hours or days old, or only post on RAoP may be overlooked because they may be creating the impression that all the requester is interested in is pizza.\n\n* People are empathetic \u2013 they like to hear stories and feel connected and involved. Perhaps telling a bit about yourself and your situation may help people connect with you. If your account is a new account, this may be particularly important, as there\u2019s not even a reddit history to look at. Let people know what a pizza would mean to you. Perhaps you could describe your job, or your family, or the things that you like to do/watch/play. Maybe your burning passion for alpacas is shared by another alpaca enthusiast who happens to have some extra money from an alpaca sale. Make the reader feel as though you\u2019re not just a screen-name looking for a quick feed, but a real, live, feeling person whose day would be brightened by a pizza or two.\n\n* Speaking as someone who\u2019s given a couple of pizzas away, there\u2019s nothing more I like than seeing a photo afterwards! (It can be via PM, and it doesn\u2019t even need to show you in it.) I like to know that the pizza got there safely and that you\u2019re enjoying it. Your joy is my reward. Also, *please* and *thank you* are wonderful words \u2013 free to use and they make the world a nicer place. Please, use them liberally.\n\n**TL;DR** \u2013 nothing, these are just some idle thoughts. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT take them as RAoP gospel or apply them as though they were! Oh, and don\u2019t be mean to each other. That\u2019s not nice. :P\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/kdqot/thoughts_for_requesters/", "created_utc": 1315878572.0, "score": 70, "author": "jesses_girl", "num_comments": 44, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/kdqot/thoughts_for_requesters/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "[Meta] An Introduction and Rules Reminder for r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "selftext": " \n\n# Welcome to [/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza)!\n\nFor those of you that are new (or even those that aren't), please keep in mind the following requirements and rules.\n\n## Account Requirements\n\n## To make requests, and enter contests and giveaways, your account:\n\n* Must be at least 90 days old\n* Must have at least 400 **Comment** Karma\n* Must have regular and productive reddit participation for the past 90 days (requesting, entering giveaways, self-promotion, low effort comments, gift exchanges and the like does not count)\n* Must have no defaulted Reddit loans\n* No nuked post history\n* Must not be a revived idle account\n* Must not be listed on the r/UniversalScammerList\n\nPlease view your own account profile to see what your karma levels are at. Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nin3uk/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1621703117.0, "score": 71, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nin3uk/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "[REQUEST] Helped a cyclist out today in Southampton... did not go as planned.", "selftext": "So I'm financially a little shaky right now, as I don't start my new job until September and I just graduated. Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.  \n  \nShortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's \"friend\" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the \"friend\" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.\n\nNaturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's \"friends\" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is \"still on tag\" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also \"on tag\". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.\n\nBy this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, \"thanks anyway\"s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.\n\nDefeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!\n\nEDIT: TL;DR, I helped out a criminal repair what was probably a stolen bicycle while surrounded by sketchy people and subsequently had to spend my dinner money on a replacement tool he broke so that I could fix my own ride.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/x9etl/request_helped_a_cyclist_out_today_in_southampton/", "created_utc": 1343415654.0, "score": 67, "author": "grahamsimmons", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/x9etl/request_helped_a_cyclist_out_today_in_southampton/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "[Offer] DOMINO'S UK ONLY - Only for someone who is in need.", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI recently ordered a pizza the night before going on a keto diet, and I'll be honest.. I'm struggling to stick to this diet - I'm STARVING! Anyway the pizza came in a really bad condition so I made a complaint and got a code for a free complimentary large pizza, it doesn't include sides or drinks unfortunately. I don't want this code so I'm giving it away.\n\nSo... I'm looking for someone who isn't coping with mental health, someone who is suffering from severe depression, anxiety, and maybe PTSD? The reason why I'm doing this is because I sent a request for a pizza on this sub-reddit when I was at my darkest time, I was on the brink of suicidal. I was an absolute mess. Nobody responded to my request, not even an upvote or downvote - didn't get one single person's attention.. and honestly that was a horrible feeling. I managed to convince myself to not suicide and took small steps in improving my mental health and wellbeing and here I am!\n\nNow, you could make up a story just to try and get a code (honestly, you're a bad person if you do this) so I won't give in easily - I'd love to chat and hear more about your life and your story how you're getting on. I am by no means a professional therapist but I'm willing to offer some word of advice as to how you can better yourself, just like how I did it.\n\nI will pick someone, hopefully a genuine person who is suffering, at some point this weekend.\n\nFor those who didn't get the code, please continue to get in touch with me for a chat or seek professional help at  [https://www.mind.org.uk/](https://www.mind.org.uk/) (UK BASED)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRules:  \n\\- I will pick one person who has commented below, and dm me their story and how they're feeling/getting on.\n\nFinal edit: Thank you so much for giving me a gold award for this submission, I really appreciate it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/e05vgv/offer_dominos_uk_only_only_for_someone_who_is_in/", "created_utc": 1574450701.0, "score": 61, "author": "iWindmill", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/e05vgv/offer_dominos_uk_only_only_for_someone_who_is_in/", "html_title": ""}

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban.

{"title": "[Meta] An Introduction and Rules Reminder for r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "selftext": " \n\n# Welcome to [/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza)!\n\nFor those of you that are new (or even those that aren't), please keep in mind the following requirements and rules.\n\n## Account Requirements\n\n## To make requests, and enter contests and giveaways, your account:\n\n* Must be at least 90 days old\n* Must have at least 400 **Comment** Karma\n* Must have regular and productive Reddit participation (requesting, entering giveaways, self-promotion, low effort comments, gift exchanges and the like does not count)\n* Must have no defaulted Reddit loans\n* No nuked post history\n* Must not be a revived idle account\n* Must not be listed on the r/UniversalScammerList\n\nPlease view your own account profile to see what your karma levels are at. Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1iktfa5/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1739037917.0, "score": 8, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1iktfa5/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": ""}

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1hpt9dc/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1735581908.0, "score": 10, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1hpt9dc/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

We have a plan to get back on our feet as my wife will be starting a job driving for Amazon this week.

If pan crust is an option, that would be a huge bonus!\n- We have Domino\u2019s, Hungry Howie\u2019s, and Pizza Hut nearby, so any of those would be great.\n\n Even if this doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019m grateful for being part of a community that\u2019s about spreading kindness and paying it forward.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1gngs7q/request_pizza_heaven_for_my_florida_panhandle/", "created_utc": 1731177641.0, "score": 1, "author": "slickricky60", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1gngs7q/request_pizza_heaven_for_my_florida_panhandle/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

If there was a way to do a delivery it would be best as I don't have much gas money to spare. There are also local spots as well. \n\n  \nThanks in advance!

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban.

My adult son and I rescue cats (daughter used to help, but the losses got to her so she stopped).\n\nWe tnr ferals, tame feral kittens and foster them when they're weaned and we also foster an occasional adult cat.\n\nWe lost almost a whole litter of kittens about 3-4 weeks ago. They were kittens born in my mom's garage.\n\nWe had tamed them, given them flea baths, loved and cuddled them and when they were weaned, we brought them home to foster.\n\nThings went bad after their neuter surgery. They became ill and never recovered, except for 1 baby named Zipper. His little cousin, Kit-Kat survived too. She'd been living with her cousins here at home.\n\nI cry daily for them, especially for my Queso boy. I feel so guilty that I couldn't save them. \n\nIn my mind, I keep going over what I could have done or should have done to change the outcome. \n\nMy son is quite sad too, but he holds it in.\n\nWe're struggling financially. I applied for disability more than a year ago, but it's taking a long time to even get my 1st rejection from them.\n\nOur pantry is almost empty. We have tomato sauce and applesauce but not much else. \n\nTo make things worse, I have a bad cavity related to one of my autoimmune diseases and it's really hurting today. Unfortunately, I can't afford to see a dentist. \n\nNot all is lost, though. We had an adult feral spayed yesterday and she's very sweet and tame. \n\nRather than release her back outdoors, we're going to foster her until she gets adopted. Her name is Olivia.\n\nA gift of a pizza that I can share with my son and daughter would be very much appreciated, even if I can only eat on one side of my mouth, lol.\n\nWe don't mind if it's from pizza hut or dominos. We haven't had pizza from either of those places in about a year.\n\nWell, hopefully I typed out this post correctly.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly.

{"title": "[Meta] An Introduction and Rules Reminder for r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "selftext": " \n\n# Welcome to [/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza)!\n\nFor those of you that are new (or even those that aren't), please keep in mind the following requirements and rules.\n\n## Account Requirements\n\n## To make requests, and enter contests and giveaways, your account:\n\n* Must be at least 90 days old\n* Must have at least 400 **Comment** Karma\n* Must have regular and productive Reddit participation (requesting, entering giveaways, self-promotion, low effort comments, gift exchanges and the like does not count)\n* Must have no defaulted Reddit loans\n* No nuked post history\n* Must not be a revived idle account\n* Must not be listed on the r/UniversalScammerList\n\nPlease view your own account profile to see what your karma levels are at. Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1eife3w/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1722618320.0, "score": 7, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1eife3w/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1az0zi9/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1708797907.0, "score": 7, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1az0zi9/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1aqtd96/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1707933909.0, "score": 6, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1aqtd96/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "[Request] feeling cursed, requesting pizza joy", "selftext": "I feel dumb for asking for pizza, or general moochery. For a lot of reasons the past few years have sucked. Some of this has been 100% my fault for not giving up on helping friends when that help dragged me down. I've gone over it in my head and in hindsight I can't say I would do it differently.\n\nThis is relevant to my TLDR, i promise. I'm not actually proud of helping anyone. A few months ago I realized the actual hurt it caused other people I loved when because of that help I ended up getting robbed because a person I.. not important. My things were mistaken for his because they were outside the unit so someone on way too many drugs and homeless assumed it was shit that apparently had been stolen from him and broke in and left things open. I was sick and in the hospital at the time. Apparently my friend was there and picked through my stuff too.\n\nIt is what it is. I'm upset because I know most of the regular homeless in that are and several who know him and if he'd talked to any of them this could have been resolved. I've helped for years down there. I understand why he wouldn't have confronted any of us and I understand this was a weak excuse. I'm upset because people I thought were friends beyond words, who genuinely meant a lot and who I have gone out of my way in the past to help weren't there for me. I've never asked for help from them before - beyond the sort of normal small things friends do, of course I did. These are people who preach mutual aid and who I have seen leap into action for strangers. I'm glad they help our community but it gutted me, it still guts me. I thought I meant more to people. I am trying to find positives and I am trying to engage meaningfully with the world because I don't want to taken bitterness and fear away from what happened. I've put more into the things that truly matter to me in my work and have connected with old communities stress and depression have made me stop working with the past few years.\n\nThis weekend I'm alone and have been trying to finish my insurance paperwork which has been a review of all the things I've lost and I've been going through all the memories those things held and it has hurt more than I want to admit. Some of the things I'm missing were really important in my life even though they are pretty worthless and I have no doubt just ended up getting thrown away.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/16tq3cz/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1695834309.0, "score": 7, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/16tq3cz/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": ""}

Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban.

Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly.

{"title": "[Meta] An Introduction and Rules Reminder for r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza", "selftext": " \n\n# Welcome to [/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza)!\n\nFor those of you that are new (or even those that aren't), please keep in mind the following requirements and rules.\n\n## Account Requirements\n\n## To make requests, and enter contests and giveaways, your account:\n\n* Must be at least 90 days old\n* Must have at least 400 **Comment** Karma\n* Must have regular and productive reddit participation for the past 90 days (requesting, entering giveaways, self-promotion, low effort comments, gift exchanges and the like does not count)\n* Must have no defaulted Reddit loans\n* No nuked post history\n* Must not be a revived idle account\n* Must not be listed on the r/UniversalScammerList\n\nPlease view your own account profile to see what your karma levels are at. Post/Link karma is separate from Comment karma.\n\n* **Do not cheat when acquiring karma.** Use of the various \"Free Karma\" subs and begging for karma will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not use an alt/throwaway account.** One account per individual and household only. Use of multiple accounts will result in a permanent ban.\n* **Do not send unsolicited private messages.** Sending PMs to circumvent account requirements will also result in a permanent ban.\n* We also reserve the right at moderators' discretion to disallow anyone that appears to abuse the generosity of others. If your account history shows that a substantial amount of your Reddit participation is in gifting and material support subs, you may be banned.\n\nThere are other reasons why you might not be allowed to post that don't fit these categories listed. For more details see our [Moderation Policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies).\n\n## To make offers, contests, giveaways or fulfill requests:\n\n* There are no requirements, however as our bots may not be able to always differentiate, please [modmail us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) if you have any issues.\n* Donors should read [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/scammers) to prevent being scammed.\n\n# Quick Overview of Rules\n\n* **Do not delete ANY CONTENT from this subreddit under ANY circumstances.** You will be banned **AUTOMATICALLY**. Use the bot to change post status. (*In other words, use the* $closed *command!*)\n* **Document transactions using the bot, and keep post status up to date.** Donors and recipients make sure each gift is logged once, - flairs are updated automatically. Use of the bot is not optional, you must log your transaction. Failure to do so can result in a ban. Discount codes do not count as a gift, don't log them with the bot.\n* **When gifted, post a separate \\[THANKS\\] with a Verification Photo.** Do this if you win contests/offers as well. Follow up on all other agreements made with donor, such as work-for-pizza or pay-it-forward / pay-it-back. Failure to include a verification photo will prevent you from making future requests or participating in contests and giveaways.\n* **Posting limits** Wait a minimum 7 days before reposting after an unfulfilled request, and a minimum 90 days after receiving a pizza (including contests/offers). If you have received 2 gifts more than you have given, do not request or enter giveaways.\n* **Requests are for pizza (and side orders and soft drinks with the pizza) only, and max one gift per request!** Do not ask for money, gift cards, or anything that is not pizza and sides and soft drinks with the pizza. No fundraisers, wish lists or referral links. No 3rd party requests for ineligible users. No gift card selling or so on. Also, no alcoholic beverages. (Sorry!)\n* **Be civilized and keep posts Safe for Work.** No witch hunts, calling people out, making insulting, or insinuating comments. No bartering for NSFW/explicit content. Don't hijack requests, or be less than honest.\n\n# More Info\n\n* A complete guide to how to give and get pizzas, along with the meaning behind your flair can be found at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index)\n\n# REMEMBER: We are NOT an emergency food resource.\n\nIf you are in desperate need, we have suggestions on where to get assistance here at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Random\\_Acts\\_Of\\_Pizza/wiki/emergency\\_assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/emergency_assistance)\n\nPosts and comments from ineligible users are simply removed by the bot. There's no banning just because you don't meet requirements, and you are free to participate later once those requirements are met. There are some exceptions though, so again, please check our [Moderation Policies.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/index#wiki_moderation_policies)\n\nEven if you ask us nicely for an exception to the account requirements (which we'll refuse), you'll still be able to participate in the future once you meet requirements.\n\nThe exception is if the user reacts poorly. That will earn a permanent ban. And that's no fun for anyone.\n\n# Questions?\n\n[Click here for Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/wiki/frequently_asked_questions)\n\n[Modmail us!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/15cxaw9/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "created_utc": 1690650309.0, "score": 8, "author": "ultradip", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/15cxaw9/meta_an_introduction_and_rules_reminder_for/", "html_title": ""}
