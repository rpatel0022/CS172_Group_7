Raspberry pur\u00e9e(deseeded) added to my sour cream topping for color and more lemon zest and juice. And oodles of vegan rainbow sprinkles inside! I made two 10inch cheesecakes -32 slices total and it sold out in two days, mid week even! So I\u2019m definitely making this one again! Thank you for the inspiration Reddit! My thoughts was that because it\u2019s been so cold and wintery here this cheesecake flavor would spark some joy, and oh boy it sure did!\nThe cupcakes I make are flavored the same, and I make a cream cheese frosting that has a thickened seedless raspberry for color, I\u2019ll post a pic of the cupcakes in the comments.

Slowly whisk in milk, then add sugar. Over medium heat, bring to a simmer, whisking constantly, until it becomes very thick and almost pudding-like (maybe five minutes). Take care to scrape the bottom of the pan as you whisk to avoid burning.\n- Remove from heat, whisk in vanilla and salt.\n- Pour into a bowl to allow it to cool completely.\n- Put plastic wrap on the surface to keep a skin from forming. Chill overnight or for several hours (don't try to cheat this step! Needs to be solidly cold all the way through).\n- Use a mixer to beat the butter, scraping the sides of the bowl occasionally, about 5 minutes, until pale and fluffy. With the mixer on medium, add the cooled flour mixture a small scoop at a time.
