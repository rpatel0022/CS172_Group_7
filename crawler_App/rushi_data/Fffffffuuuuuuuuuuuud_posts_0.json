I'm thinking of things like spatulas, knives, bowls, pans, pots, slices of bread (???), etc.  Looking through the comic-recipes people have made, it seems like almost every one of them requires specific pictures of that meal being made, so I'm not sure how realistic this is, but I figured I'd offer.\n\nBasically, is there anything I can do to make it easier for you guys?  If you can send me pictures, or at the very least, links to pictures, I'll start adding them to the \"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud\" section right away.

The attribution in the book itself will show this clearly.\n\nApart from some information about a few specific ones, I've not found much general information about copyright on rage faces. I guess that comes with community creation. Seeing how many people already make money off the rage faces and how little lawsuits came from that, it'll probably be all right.

{"title": "Do we still want to properly publish an awesome \r\ncookbook? If so, there are some things that need \r\ndiscussing...", "selftext": "So, if you missed everything: a couple weeks ago I made [a cookbook full of recipes from this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/gj7k2/as_promised_heres_a_cookbook_d/) for my bookexchange giftee and posted it to this subreddit as a pdf. Because a lot of people asked for it, I then put it up [on lulu](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/go8vf/ok_ok_you_win_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_is_now/) for the people who didn't have printers, and made a new and improved pdf for the people who had not gotten around to printing it yet ;). I'll take the book off lulu about 2 weeks from now, so if you still want one you'll have to be quick!\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of talk about making a proper book with a publisher, and I've been contacted by people who are interested in publishing it. The reason I'm posting this: it's not going to happen without you all, so I figured we need to get our expectations and priorities straight. Below I've written some discussion points, and my own thoughts and interpretations. Please discuss! :D.\r\n\r\n*Discussion points:*\r\n\r\n1. **Who does what?** As you can see, I'm taking the lead in this project, as well as doing a lot of the work involved ;). The publisher will do a lot of work as well, and have a say in many things based on their experience and expertise. I do view this as a community project, but it's going to be hard to be productive if everyone needs to be involved at all times. So IMHO this should be like a 'benevolent dictatorship': I'll do my absolute best to go about this project with integrity and respect towards this community, to ask for feedback and explain what's happening. In return I'll need you to trust that the publisher and I will do the right thing for the project, and respect our decisions. If you need to know more about me before you feel you can trust me, please don't hesitate to AMA or check out my comment history :). \r\n\r\n2. **What is the timeline?** I think we need to wait a little more, at least a few months, and gather more possible recipes. I personally would like to make the book a lot thicker than it is now, so the more recipes are submitted, the better. I'm thinking about starting discussions with publishers in 3 or 4 months, and then see what happens. Also, I'd like to be graduated by the time we get to the actual work of putting the book together, so I can work on it full time for a while. Either way, it might well be that it won't work out with a publisher, but at least it'll be an interesting experience. Self-publishing is of course always an option too, but doing this with a publisher is way cooler and easier.\r\n\r\n3. **What about the recipe authors? Part I: permission.** For the previous book I didn't get any permissions, because that wasn't supposed to be such a big thing ;). I did attribute every recipe (when possible), and I would of course do that for the next version of the cookbook as well. However, if we actually want to publish something for real, it can't go forward without official and legal permission from recipe authors. \r\n\r\n4. **What about the recipe authors? Part II: money.**  A publisher will only want to publish this if they think they can profit from it. I will only want to work for this if there's a good chance I'll be paid for my time, because I need to eat ;). There are about 35 recipe in the current book, and it took me a couple days to create a somewhat passable version, for which I didn't bother too much with picture resolutions, font size, kerning, etc etc. I'd like the next book to have lots more recipes. Lots of recipes means lots of authors and lots of work for me/the publisher. So, after thinking about all of the previous sentences, I don't think it's realistic to assume there's going to money to pay 50 or 60 or 70 or more recipe authors. Maybe if it's an overwhelming success we can send you each a copy for free, but I don't know if that's possible. Of course this is something a publisher has a much better handle on, so I might well be wrong, and then we'll all be rich :D. It's definitely something to think about though. Will this change your opinion of the project? Is this (un)acceptable? I'd love to hear your opinions.\r\n\r\n5. **Would you be ok with changes to the recipes?** Some recipes might need changes to make them ready for publishing, for instance because the pictures are blurry, because they're just a little bit too wide or too long, because things are misspelled, because the instructions are unclear, because they use ingredients that are local to somewhere, etc. Of course this is partly a legal issue, I assume you'll sign for this when you give permission to be included, I think no publisher will go near it if you don't. I would like to think that we'd work with the authors if possible, but that might not be practical depending on the volume of changes and the number of authors. Is this acceptable?\r\n\r\n6. **How will I keep you up to date or ask for feedback?** I don't want to keep spamming this subreddit if that's in any way unwelcome. But I do want to be transparent about this project, and open it up for occasional feedback. Should I make a new subreddit/blog/whatever to discuss the project or keep it in here? Mods, maybe you can weigh in on this, it's your subreddit ;). Obviously the frequency of posts etc will all depends on the publisher as well, I'm not sure how much feedback and transparency they'll be comfortable with. I've made /r/hungryasfuck because why the hell not, but I'm not sure if that is the appropriate forum.\r\n\r\n7. **Any other suggestions/thoughts/concerns you'd like to discuss?**\r\n\r\nOne more thing: I've already received a rather unpleasant message about 'selling out' when I first posted the cookbook, so I figured I should address it before some troll derails any productive discussion we might have. I have to admit I'm not super-involved in the 'f7u12 culture', I just enjoy browsing f7u12(d). The reason I'm behind this project is that I just really like your recipes, and think it'll be AWESOME to have a proper real cookbook of them. I don't expect to become super-rich from this, AFAIK most publishing endeavors don't rake in the cash, I just hope it'll cover the amount of work I'll put in ;). If all this makes me a sellout somehow, that's ok. This cookbook thing is not going to happen if you guys won't give permission to be included, so yeah, that would be it then. Either way, I loved the overwhelming positive reaction the current incarnation of the cookbook got, so if this project doesn't happen I'll always have that ;). Thank you all :D.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\ntl;dr: We're (hopefully) making a recipe book with recipes from this subreddit, with a publisher. Just read the bold discussion points and give your opinion about them.

That's more than they cost to print and send, because I'll have to bind them myself and my time isn't free. **This price is for printing, shipping and waving it goodbye when I leave the post office.** And no, I don't know how much that is in dollar. I'm guessing it's about 25, but we'll figure out currencies later.\n\nPrinting will be on regular 90grams white laser printer paper, and print with a color laser machine (just like I did for the one in the picture). Binding involves a black metal coil, a sheet of white card stock on the back, and a plastic sheet in the front to protect the cover.\n\nI will write or draw something on the title page if that amuses you ;).\n\nThis will be a go at 10 people at least. We can figure out how to transfer money/addresses when we hit that point.\n\n**EDIT: To make it abundantly clear what the deal is here, this is what I said to jhh4321 below: Yes, I'll make some money of this. This is not to pay me for the work of putting all this together, this is to pay me for binding all these ones by hand, because that's shit work.**\n\nI sure hope everyone will print it them, because that saves me the time of making them and the work of making sure everyone sends me money and gets a copy. So please do, check out Kinkos or another print shop, or see if you/your parents/friends/someone else can print one at work.\n\nBut now that I released it, it would make me sad if there were people that really couldn't get it, like maniacnf, who comments it costs them 55 dollar to print in their local printshop. That's just not right. That's the only reason I would go to the print shop and bind this things for you guys.\n\n**PLEASE DON'T GET THIS FROM ME TO SUPPORT OR THANK ME!** As long as you guys stay awesome and help me with the next one, and buy that, that would be great.

However, her attention was diverted by, I assume, one of her many pets, and thus she failed to monitor the progress of inflation.\n\nDo I need to finish this story? Of course the point of no return came and went and the bird, having reached critical mass, went supernovae, completely covering her cucina in a cold canard carcass coating.\n\nThe other (for which I will not be making a rage comic as the flash plug in crashed when I was almost done making the first one and so had to start all over and so now am tired) was when I threw a huge dinner party and all these people RSVP'd and then didn't call or anything to cancel, and only three people showed up (I had prepared for at least 12) and I made an impressive (and expensive spread) and I burnt the creme brulee and then everyone shows up because I forgot it was daylight savings day and the time I told everyone to show up was an hour later than I'd thought.\n\nfffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.....\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/k34jw/what_was_your_worst_cooking_disaster_feel_free_to/", "created_utc": 1315015207.0, "score": 18, "author": "hazardousnorth", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/k34jw/what_was_your_worst_cooking_disaster_feel_free_to/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "ffffuuur so-called gumbo. Here's how it's done.", "selftext": "As the Southerners say, \"First you make the roux.\"\n\nTake equal amounts of bacon grease and butter, get it spackling hot (but not smoking) and add an equal amount of flour. Stir until the it looks a little glossy and dust with more flour. Keep stirring, adding flour dustings until it stops shining. This takes approximately two weeks (or seems so, anyway.)\n\nCook the flour/oil mixture over medium heat, stirring without stopping, until it looks like dark chocolate. It should smell nutty but not burnt. If it should start to burn, the neighborhood critters will love it for a snack but you get to start all over again.\n\nOnce it gets dark brown, up the heat a bit and start dumping in chicken stock and stir until tennis elbow starts setting in. At this point the hard part is done and the rest just takes time...lots of time.\n\nAdd your favorite amounts of onion, celery, tomatoes (I cheat and use stewed in a can), garlic, bay leaves, okra, red pepper, a few jolts of Tabasco, Old Bay Seasoning, salt and pepper. Add a little water, wine or chicken stock if it looks thick. At this point it should be quite thin, more like a broth, not thick like gravy (that part comes later).A few hours later, add at least couple cups of peeled smallish shrimp. They'll pretty much disappear and that's okay.\n\nThis is the first layer that cooks pretty much all day. It'll be medium-dark in color and will crust over as it cooks. Stir those yummy crusts back in as they'll add to the flavor and color. At the end of the day remove from stove. Put the whole pot in the fridge and go to bed.\n\nDay Two -\n\nHeat it back up and add at least three teaspoons of liquid Crab Boil (double this amount if the people eating like extra-hot like we do). Everything should pretty much be liquefied at this point so you'll want to add fresh vegetables to the noxious potion for a good texture. Chop up more onion, celery, okra, fresh tomato and toss it in. By this time it should be almost black.. that's what you want. Swamp juice! Toss in a few blue crab bodies, more shrimp, and any other seafood you're fond of. It should look rich, but not so thick to spackle a wall.\n\nCook some rice w/ a bit of butter, salt and chopped up parsley. A sticky rice rather than smooth seems to work best but it's personal preference.\n\nHere's where I differ from my family. Granny used to add gumbo file' to the entire pot before serving. My mom thought it made the gumbo stringy and I'm on the fence so I add about a tablespoon near the end, stir it in, and put the file' jar on the table so it can be added in as desired. Both ways work for me. By this time I'm so hungry I don't care.\n\nI serve this mess over the rice with a healthy-sized spoonful of fresh picked blue crabmeat as a garnish.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/furx4/ffffuuur_socalled_gumbo_heres_how_its_done/", "created_utc": 1298948813.0, "score": 6, "author": "leita", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/furx4/ffffuuur_socalled_gumbo_heres_how_its_done/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Bubba's 'No Guts, No Glory Cranberry Sauce'", "selftext": "I'm not very good with comics but I do have a good recipe to share.\n\n* 3 C sugar\n\n* 2 navel oranges\n\n* 1 t grated ginger\n\n* 8 C cranberries\n\n* 1 1/2 C (2 oz.) toasted pecans\n\n* 1 bottle of fresh Gran Marnier\n\n* 1 shot glass\n\nAs all recipes are a mixture of give & take and some experimentation just must go on, keep that in mind as we begin this adventure and you should come up with a bucket of that red gelatinous goo that grandma used to make, back before they figured out how to puree it and stick it in a can. (disgusting, eh?)\n\nTo insure the quality and freshness of your ingredients, check the sugar tin for weevils, the cranberries for bugs and above all the freshness of the Gran Marnier.\nGo ahead, open it and have a shot. Does it have that royal sweetness on your tongue? Does it make you want to reach for your mink lined satin robe and gather your minions for a speech?\n\nNo? Then have another shot and we'll proceed.\n\nGrate the orange peel and add to a pot with the sugar and ginger. Use a tool called a cheese grater. The peel must be finely grated, or you risk biting into a chunk of some sour ass shit down the road. We're looking for flavor here.\n\nHave another shot, you'll need it for this next step.\n\nAdd the juice from the orange into the pot. Definitely not the easiest thing in the world if you don't have something that looks like a juicer, whatever the fuck that is. Tip: putting it in a freezer bag and stomping on it doesn't work. A trip to the garage for a pair on C-clamps and a couple of chunks of fresh clean pine board did seem to get the job done, though.\n\n\nNow, add the sugar and ginger to the pot and turn on the fire kinda low.\n\nHave another shot and mop up the orange juice off the kitchen floor.\nBy the time you're done with that the sugar will have melted and you'll have something in the bottom of the pan that looks like runny marmalade and pretty much tastes the same.\n\nBefore the sugar starts burning, frantically pull the bags of cranberries out of the fridge, wash 'em and measure out 8 cups.\nA coffee cup will do if you're not a caffeine junkie with a quart jug. Now pour them into the pot with the marmalade.\n\nPour yourself another shot and relax for a moment. At least until you realize the pot isn't big enough, so pull down a bigger pot and transfer all the contents, making sure you get all the goo out of the old pot.\n\nNow you just have to wait, stir and simmer until all the cranberries pop open.\n\n\nHave another shot.\n\n\nGive it a real good stir and make sure all the berries have popped open, but you don't have to make a federal production out of it.\n\n\nHave another shot, turn off the heat. We're almost there.\n\nThe recipe calls for crushed roasted pecans, so tear the kitchen apart looking for the meat tenderizer (who uses those things anymore?) and then go back to the garage and break out your framing hammer. These tools are very similar in design and effect.\n\nOnce you crush the pecans, fold them into the red gelatinous goo.\n\nThen sweep up the glass from the mixing bowl you just shattered with the framing hammer.\n\nYou have to move a little faster now, or the stuff will start setting up like drywall mud.\n\nQuickly take two more shots and pour the rest of the bottle into the goo. Stir until it's completely mixed.\n\nPour it all into a big bowl, cover it with Saran Wrap (a skill that I will go into at a later date) and stick it into the fridge.\n\nNow, break out the hose, rinse out the kitchen and remove all evidence of your mayhem before your wife gets home.\n\nWhile you savor your accomplishment, try to come up with a good alibi for the missing mixing bowl.\n\nYou're done!\n\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/13hugr/bubbas_no_guts_no_glory_cranberry_sauce/", "created_utc": 1353389653.0, "score": 4, "author": "downvotethis2", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/13hugr/bubbas_no_guts_no_glory_cranberry_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Bubba's 'No Guts, No Glory Cranberry Sauce'", "selftext": "I'm not very good with comics but I do have a good recipe to share.\n\n* 3 C sugar\n\n* 2 navel oranges\n\n* 1 t grated ginger\n\n* 8 C cranberries\n\n* 1 1/2 C (2 oz.) toasted pecans\n\n* 1 bottle of fresh Gran Marnier\n\n* 1 shot glass\n\nAs all recipes are a mixture of give & take and some experimentation just must go on, keep that in mind as we begin this adventure and you should come up with a bucket of that red gelatinous goo that grandma used to make, back before they figured out how to puree it and stick it in a can. (disgusting, eh?)\n\nTo insure the quality and freshness of your ingredients, check the sugar tin for weevils, the cranberries for bugs and above all the freshness of the Gran Marnier.\nGo ahead, open it and have a shot. Does it have that royal sweetness on your tongue? Does it make you want to reach for your mink lined satin robe and gather your minions for a speech?\n\nNo? Then have another shot and we'll proceed.\n\nGrate the orange peel and add to a pot with the sugar and ginger. Use a tool called a cheese grater. The peel must be finely grated, or you risk biting into a chunk of some sour ass shit down the road. We're looking for flavor here.\n\nHave another shot, you'll need it for this next step.\n\nAdd the juice from the orange into the pot. Definitely not the easiest thing in the world if you don't have something that looks like a juicer, whatever the fuck that is. Tip: putting it in a freezer bag and stomping on it doesn't work. A trip to the garage for a pair on C-clamps and a couple of chunks of fresh clean pine board did seem to get the job done, though.\n\n\nNow, add the sugar and ginger to the pot and turn on the fire kinda low.\n\nHave another shot and mop up the orange juice off the kitchen floor.\nBy the time you're done with that the sugar will have melted and you'll have something in the bottom of the pan that looks like runny marmalade and pretty much tastes the same.\n\nBefore the sugar starts burning, frantically pull the bags of cranberries out of the fridge, wash 'em and measure out 8 cups.\nA coffee cup will do if you're not a caffeine junkie with a quart jug. Now pour them into the pot with the marmalade.\n\nPour yourself another shot and relax for a moment. At least until you realize the pot isn't big enough, so pull down a bigger pot and transfer all the contents, making sure you get all the goo out of the old pot.\n\nNow you just have to wait, stir and simmer until all the cranberries pop open.\n\n\nHave another shot.\n\n\nGive it a real good stir and make sure all the berries have popped open, but you don't have to make a federal production out of it.\n\n\nHave another shot, turn off the heat. We're almost there.\n\nThe recipe calls for crushed roasted pecans, so tear the kitchen apart looking for the meat tenderizer (who uses those things anymore?) and then go back to the garage and break out your framing hammer. These tools are very similar in design and effect.\n\nOnce you crush the pecans, fold them into the red gelatinous goo.\n\nThen sweep up the glass from the mixing bowl you just shattered with the framing hammer.\n\nYou have to move a little faster now, or the stuff will start setting up like drywall mud.\n\nQuickly take two more shots and pour the rest of the bottle into the goo. Stir until it's completely mixed.\n\nPour it all into a big bowl, cover it with Saran Wrap (a skill that I will go into at a later date) and stick it into the fridge.\n\nNow, break out the hose, rinse out the kitchen and remove all evidence of your mayhem before your wife gets home.\n\nWhile you savor your accomplishment, try to come up with a good alibi for the missing mixing bowl.\n\nYou're done!\n\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/13hugr/bubbas_no_guts_no_glory_cranberry_sauce/", "created_utc": 1353389653.0, "score": 4, "author": "downvotethis2", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/13hugr/bubbas_no_guts_no_glory_cranberry_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

However, her attention was diverted by, I assume, one of her many pets, and thus she failed to monitor the progress of inflation.\n\nDo I need to finish this story? Of course the point of no return came and went and the bird, having reached critical mass, went supernovae, completely covering her cucina in a cold canard carcass coating.\n\nThe other (for which I will not be making a rage comic as the flash plug in crashed when I was almost done making the first one and so had to start all over and so now am tired) was when I threw a huge dinner party and all these people RSVP'd and then didn't call or anything to cancel, and only three people showed up (I had prepared for at least 12) and I made an impressive (and expensive spread) and I burnt the creme brulee and then everyone shows up because I forgot it was daylight savings day and the time I told everyone to show up was an hour later than I'd thought.\n\nfffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.....\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/k34jw/what_was_your_worst_cooking_disaster_feel_free_to/", "created_utc": 1315015207.0, "score": 18, "author": "hazardousnorth", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/k34jw/what_was_your_worst_cooking_disaster_feel_free_to/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Thanks for your responses :). It'll take a while to look at everything, but I'll post the results asap. Of course any feedback you want to give is still welcome in this post.\n\nThe lulu version is of the current edition of the cookbook is no longer available.

This would include the right to distribute the recipe and the right to make changes that might be needed to make it fit for publishing. IANAL but as far as I know this is a form of licensing, I can't see any reason why it would be necessary to sign over full copyrights.\n\nAll recipes will be attributed, if possible. I am not taking credit for the recipes, the rage faces or the f7u12(d) phenomenon, and will definitely correct anyone who thinks I made all of it. The attribution in the book itself will show this clearly.\n\nApart from some information about a few specific ones, I've not found much general information about copyright on rage faces. I guess that comes with community creation. Seeing how many people already make money off the rage faces and how little lawsuits came from that, it'll probably be all right. Once this project gets really serious we'll figure it out in more detail.

{"title": "Do we still want to properly publish an awesome \r\ncookbook? If so, there are some things that need \r\ndiscussing...", "selftext": "So, if you missed everything: a couple weeks ago I made [a cookbook full of recipes from this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/gj7k2/as_promised_heres_a_cookbook_d/) for my bookexchange giftee and posted it to this subreddit as a pdf. Because a lot of people asked for it, I then put it up [on lulu](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/go8vf/ok_ok_you_win_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_is_now/) for the people who didn't have printers, and made a new and improved pdf for the people who had not gotten around to printing it yet ;). I'll take the book off lulu about 2 weeks from now, so if you still want one you'll have to be quick!\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of talk about making a proper book with a publisher, and I've been contacted by people who are interested in publishing it. The reason I'm posting this: it's not going to happen without you all, so I figured we need to get our expectations and priorities straight. Below I've written some discussion points, and my own thoughts and interpretations. Please discuss! :D.\r\n\r\n*Discussion points:*\r\n\r\n1. **Who does what?** As you can see, I'm taking the lead in this project, as well as doing a lot of the work involved ;). The publisher will do a lot of work as well, and have a say in many things based on their experience and expertise. I do view this as a community project, but it's going to be hard to be productive if everyone needs to be involved at all times. So IMHO this should be like a 'benevolent dictatorship': I'll do my absolute best to go about this project with integrity and respect towards this community, to ask for feedback and explain what's happening. In return I'll need you to trust that the publisher and I will do the right thing for the project, and respect our decisions. If you need to know more about me before you feel you can trust me, please don't hesitate to AMA or check out my comment history :). \r\n\r\n2. **What is the timeline?** I think we need to wait a little more, at least a few months, and gather more possible recipes. I personally would like to make the book a lot thicker than it is now, so the more recipes are submitted, the better. I'm thinking about starting discussions with publishers in 3 or 4 months, and then see what happens. Also, I'd like to be graduated by the time we get to the actual work of putting the book together, so I can work on it full time for a while. Either way, it might well be that it won't work out with a publisher, but at least it'll be an interesting experience. Self-publishing is of course always an option too, but doing this with a publisher is way cooler and easier.\r\n\r\n3. **What about the recipe authors? Part I: permission.** For the previous book I didn't get any permissions, because that wasn't supposed to be such a big thing ;). I did attribute every recipe (when possible), and I would of course do that for the next version of the cookbook as well. However, if we actually want to publish something for real, it can't go forward without official and legal permission from recipe authors. \r\n\r\n4. **What about the recipe authors? Part II: money.**  A publisher will only want to publish this if they think they can profit from it. I will only want to work for this if there's a good chance I'll be paid for my time, because I need to eat ;). There are about 35 recipe in the current book, and it took me a couple days to create a somewhat passable version, for which I didn't bother too much with picture resolutions, font size, kerning, etc etc. I'd like the next book to have lots more recipes. Lots of recipes means lots of authors and lots of work for me/the publisher. So, after thinking about all of the previous sentences, I don't think it's realistic to assume there's going to money to pay 50 or 60 or 70 or more recipe authors. Maybe if it's an overwhelming success we can send you each a copy for free, but I don't know if that's possible. Of course this is something a publisher has a much better handle on, so I might well be wrong, and then we'll all be rich :D. It's definitely something to think about though. Will this change your opinion of the project? Is this (un)acceptable? I'd love to hear your opinions.\r\n\r\n5. **Would you be ok with changes to the recipes?** Some recipes might need changes to make them ready for publishing, for instance because the pictures are blurry, because they're just a little bit too wide or too long, because things are misspelled, because the instructions are unclear, because they use ingredients that are local to somewhere, etc. Of course this is partly a legal issue, I assume you'll sign for this when you give permission to be included, I think no publisher will go near it if you don't. I would like to think that we'd work with the authors if possible, but that might not be practical depending on the volume of changes and the number of authors. Is this acceptable?\r\n\r\n6. **How will I keep you up to date or ask for feedback?** I don't want to keep spamming this subreddit if that's in any way unwelcome. But I do want to be transparent about this project, and open it up for occasional feedback. Should I make a new subreddit/blog/whatever to discuss the project or keep it in here? Mods, maybe you can weigh in on this, it's your subreddit ;). Obviously the frequency of posts etc will all depends on the publisher as well, I'm not sure how much feedback and transparency they'll be comfortable with. I've made /r/hungryasfuck because why the hell not, but I'm not sure if that is the appropriate forum.\r\n\r\n7. **Any other suggestions/thoughts/concerns you'd like to discuss?**\r\n\r\nOne more thing: I've already received a rather unpleasant message about 'selling out' when I first posted the cookbook, so I figured I should address it before some troll derails any productive discussion we might have. I have to admit I'm not super-involved in the 'f7u12 culture', I just enjoy browsing f7u12(d). The reason I'm behind this project is that I just really like your recipes, and think it'll be AWESOME to have a proper real cookbook of them. I don't expect to become super-rich from this, AFAIK most publishing endeavors don't rake in the cash, I just hope it'll cover the amount of work I'll put in ;). If all this makes me a sellout somehow, that's ok. This cookbook thing is not going to happen if you guys won't give permission to be included, so yeah, that would be it then. Either way, I loved the overwhelming positive reaction the current incarnation of the cookbook got, so if this project doesn't happen I'll always have that ;). Thank you all :D.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\ntl;dr: We're (hopefully) making a recipe book with recipes from this subreddit, with a publisher.

CHECK OUT [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/go8vf/ok_ok_you_win_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_is_now/) THREAD - I've put the cookbook up on lulu.com at cost price and am accepting donations, details in that thread I just linked. \n\nI'm pretty sure I spammed everyone in this thread with the link, I'm really sorry if I messaged you twice by accident ;).\n\nTHE OLD POST is below, please ignore everything after this line.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe other thread got a bit crazy, if you're really interested post here. \n\nI'm gonna put the price at 15 euro a piece for EU countries, and 17 for anywhere else in the world, without tracking number/insurance/garantees. That's more than they cost to print and send, because I'll have to bind them myself and my time isn't free. **This price is for printing, shipping and waving it goodbye when I leave the post office.** And no, I don't know how much that is in dollar. I'm guessing it's about 25, but we'll figure out currencies later.\n\nPrinting will be on regular 90grams white laser printer paper, and print with a color laser machine (just like I did for the one in the picture). Binding involves a black metal coil, a sheet of white card stock on the back, and a plastic sheet in the front to protect the cover.\n\nI will write or draw something on the title page if that amuses you ;).\n\nThis will be a go at 10 people at least. We can figure out how to transfer money/addresses when we hit that point.\n\n**EDIT: To make it abundantly clear what the deal is here, this is what I said to jhh4321 below: Yes, I'll make some money of this. This is not to pay me for the work of putting all this together, this is to pay me for binding all these ones by hand, because that's shit work.**\n\nI sure hope everyone will print it them, because that saves me the time of making them and the work of making sure everyone sends me money and gets a copy. So please do, check out Kinkos or another print shop, or see if you/your parents/friends/someone else can print one at work.\n\nBut now that I released it, it would make me sad if there were people that really couldn't get it, like maniacnf, who comments it costs them 55 dollar to print in their local printshop. That's just not right. That's the only reason I would go to the print shop and bind this things for you guys.\n\n**PLEASE DON'T GET THIS FROM ME TO SUPPORT OR THANK ME!** As long as you guys stay awesome and help me with the next one, and buy that, that would be great. Then we'll do it through an actual publisher, and I won't have to lovingly hand craft each and every one of them ;)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/gjguj/cookbook_orders_id_rather_you_print_them_yourself/", "created_utc": 1302044831.0, "score": 57, "author": "afrael", "num_comments": 167, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/gjguj/cookbook_orders_id_rather_you_print_them_yourself/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "ffffuuur so-called gumbo. Here's how it's done.", "selftext": "As the Southerners say, \"First you make the roux.\"\n\nTake equal amounts of bacon grease and butter, get it spackling hot (but not smoking) and add an equal amount of flour. Stir until the it looks a little glossy and dust with more flour. Keep stirring, adding flour dustings until it stops shining. This takes approximately two weeks (or seems so, anyway.)\n\nCook the flour/oil mixture over medium heat, stirring without stopping, until it looks like dark chocolate. It should smell nutty but not burnt. If it should start to burn, the neighborhood critters will love it for a snack but you get to start all over again.\n\nOnce it gets dark brown, up the heat a bit and start dumping in chicken stock and stir until tennis elbow starts setting in. At this point the hard part is done and the rest just takes time...lots of time.\n\nAdd your favorite amounts of onion, celery, tomatoes (I cheat and use stewed in a can), garlic, bay leaves, okra, red pepper, a few jolts of Tabasco, Old Bay Seasoning, salt and pepper. Add a little water, wine or chicken stock if it looks thick. At this point it should be quite thin, more like a broth, not thick like gravy (that part comes later).A few hours later, add at least couple cups of peeled smallish shrimp. They'll pretty much disappear and that's okay.\n\nThis is the first layer that cooks pretty much all day. It'll be medium-dark in color and will crust over as it cooks. Stir those yummy crusts back in as they'll add to the flavor and color. At the end of the day remove from stove. Put the whole pot in the fridge and go to bed.\n\nDay Two -\n\nHeat it back up and add at least three teaspoons of liquid Crab Boil (double this amount if the people eating like extra-hot like we do). Everything should pretty much be liquefied at this point so you'll want to add fresh vegetables to the noxious potion for a good texture. Chop up more onion, celery, okra, fresh tomato and toss it in. By this time it should be almost black.. that's what you want. Swamp juice! Toss in a few blue crab bodies, more shrimp, and any other seafood you're fond of. It should look rich, but not so thick to spackle a wall.\n\nCook some rice w/ a bit of butter, salt and chopped up parsley. A sticky rice rather than smooth seems to work best but it's personal preference.\n\nHere's where I differ from my family. Granny used to add gumbo file' to the entire pot before serving. My mom thought it made the gumbo stringy and I'm on the fence so I add about a tablespoon near the end, stir it in, and put the file' jar on the table so it can be added in as desired. Both ways work for me. By this time I'm so hungry I don't care.\n\nI serve this mess over the rice with a healthy-sized spoonful of fresh picked blue crabmeat as a garnish.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/furx4/ffffuuur_socalled_gumbo_heres_how_its_done/", "created_utc": 1298948813.0, "score": 5, "author": "leita", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/furx4/ffffuuur_socalled_gumbo_heres_how_its_done/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Bubba's 'No Guts, No Glory Cranberry Sauce'", "selftext": "I'm not very good with comics but I do have a good recipe to share.\n\n* 3 C sugar\n\n* 2 navel oranges\n\n* 1 t grated ginger\n\n* 8 C cranberries\n\n* 1 1/2 C (2 oz.) toasted pecans\n\n* 1 bottle of fresh Gran Marnier\n\n* 1 shot glass\n\nAs all recipes are a mixture of give & take and some experimentation just must go on, keep that in mind as we begin this adventure and you should come up with a bucket of that red gelatinous goo that grandma used to make, back before they figured out how to puree it and stick it in a can. (disgusting, eh?)\n\nTo insure the quality and freshness of your ingredients, check the sugar tin for weevils, the cranberries for bugs and above all the freshness of the Gran Marnier.\nGo ahead, open it and have a shot. Does it have that royal sweetness on your tongue? Does it make you want to reach for your mink lined satin robe and gather your minions for a speech?\n\nNo? Then have another shot and we'll proceed.\n\nGrate the orange peel and add to a pot with the sugar and ginger. Use a tool called a cheese grater. The peel must be finely grated, or you risk biting into a chunk of some sour ass shit down the road. We're looking for flavor here.\n\nHave another shot, you'll need it for this next step.\n\nAdd the juice from the orange into the pot. Definitely not the easiest thing in the world if you don't have something that looks like a juicer, whatever the fuck that is. Tip: putting it in a freezer bag and stomping on it doesn't work. A trip to the garage for a pair on C-clamps and a couple of chunks of fresh clean pine board did seem to get the job done, though.\n\n\nNow, add the sugar and ginger to the pot and turn on the fire kinda low.\n\nHave another shot and mop up the orange juice off the kitchen floor.\nBy the time you're done with that the sugar will have melted and you'll have something in the bottom of the pan that looks like runny marmalade and pretty much tastes the same.\n\nBefore the sugar starts burning, frantically pull the bags of cranberries out of the fridge, wash 'em and measure out 8 cups.\nA coffee cup will do if you're not a caffeine junkie with a quart jug. Now pour them into the pot with the marmalade.\n\nPour yourself another shot and relax for a moment. At least until you realize the pot isn't big enough, so pull down a bigger pot and transfer all the contents, making sure you get all the goo out of the old pot.\n\nNow you just have to wait, stir and simmer until all the cranberries pop open.\n\n\nHave another shot.\n\n\nGive it a real good stir and make sure all the berries have popped open, but you don't have to make a federal production out of it.\n\n\nHave another shot, turn off the heat.

However, her attention was diverted by, I assume, one of her many pets, and thus she failed to monitor the progress of inflation.\n\nDo I need to finish this story? Of course the point of no return came and went and the bird, having reached critical mass, went supernovae, completely covering her cucina in a cold canard carcass coating.\n\nThe other (for which I will not be making a rage comic as the flash plug in crashed when I was almost done making the first one and so had to start all over and so now am tired) was when I threw a huge dinner party and all these people RSVP'd and then didn't call or anything to cancel, and only three people showed up (I had prepared for at least 12) and I made an impressive (and expensive spread) and I burnt the creme brulee and then everyone shows up because I forgot it was daylight savings day and the time I told everyone to show up was an hour later than I'd thought.\n\nfffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.....\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/k34jw/what_was_your_worst_cooking_disaster_feel_free_to/", "created_utc": 1315015207.0, "score": 18, "author": "hazardousnorth", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/k34jw/what_was_your_worst_cooking_disaster_feel_free_to/", "html_title": ""}

Thanks for your responses :). It'll take a while to look at everything, but I'll post the results asap. Of course any feedback you want to give is still welcome in this post.\n\nThe lulu version is of the current edition of the cookbook is no longer available. You can find the free pdf version [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuud/comments/go8vf/ok_ok_you_win_the_hungry_as_fuck_cookbook_is_now/).\n\n--------\n\n**Below is some legal info, to clear up some question from the last post**\n\nFor a paper version, the recipe authors will probably have to give some rights to the publisher, to make sure nobody gets sued. This would include the right to distribute the recipe and the right to make changes that might be needed to make it fit for publishing. IANAL but as far as I know this is a form of licensing, I can't see any reason why it would be necessary to sign over full copyrights.\n\nAll recipes will be attributed, if possible. I am not taking credit for the recipes, the rage faces or the f7u12(d) phenomenon, and will definitely correct anyone who thinks I made all of it. The attribution in the book itself will show this clearly.\n\nApart from some information about a few specific ones, I've not found much general information about copyright on rage faces. I guess that comes with community creation. Seeing how many people already make money off the rage faces and how little lawsuits came from that, it'll probably be all right. Once this project gets really serious we'll figure it out in more detail.
