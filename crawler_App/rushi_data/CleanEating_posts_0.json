I consider myself very fortunate to be introduced to fruits, vegs, seeds, etc at a young age- even though I was raised on mostly unhealthy stuff. It's the whole introduction that matters a lot, it seems. People who never were given these things at an early age often have a hard time adapting it into their diets later on when they're trying to break the junk food cycle. And others just are content with eating processed garbage. \n\nI'm also fortunate in the fact I never liked chips or cheetos or really anything crunchy due to my teeth problems from my medical condition. I liked pretzels and goldfish, but I swallowed it without chewing.\n\nIt's just so satisfying to snack on raisins or sunflower seeds or fruit. It feels good. It's not even a temporary feel-good like with pretzels, where you feel bloated and upset afterward. \n\nPeople seem to think that this stuff is expensive and out if their reach, but I'm literally living in a sheltter right now with only food stamps at the moment. I've noticed right away the junk food adds up and lasts way less than any of the healthy food I buy. At most, the nuts and dried fruit can be a little iffy ngl. Like I love dates and I love pistachios,  but I won't lie that stuff is pricy LOL at least for the small amount you get in a bag at a chain grocery store. But there's always alternatives. I get raisins instead of dates, i get peanuts instead of pistachios. I've gotten really good at getting the most bang for my buck, that's something you pick up on when you are struggling. \n\nA lot of health foods in the store are a scam.  The processed food that promises it to be a \"healthy alternative \"/option. They are full of added chemicals and sugar/fake sugar- yet they charge you more than the junk food.

You don't need to be perfect with it and get rid of everything with additives- but having your diet consist of mostly clean fruits/vegs/seeds/grains go a long way.

I would remove certain foods and add them back when nothing changed.  Coffee was the first to go.

I was in soooo much pain.  I got worse and spent Christmas Eve day in the ER.  After which, they out me back on all my RA meds and I decided it was time to eat clean.  I don\u2019t put anything processed in my body.  If I do, I pay the price.  I can\u2019t eat any hots, or I pay the price.  I invent dishes.  I eat a lot of tuna and add different fruit to it to make it more palatable.  I\u2019ve been eating it daily for three months.  I am making soups, and rice dishes.

{"title": "Are there any legit SIMPLE and EASY clean eating blogs or websites out there?", "selftext": "I want to sustain a clean eating way of life, or shall I say MORE of a clean eating way of life (not diet) because I'm sick of feeling BLAH and want nourishing foods going into my body but the thing that has been against me and fails me time and time again is the fact that I HATE COOKING, meal prepping, all that jazz. I understand there has to be an effort to do those things to get where I want to be but there has to be an ultimate place for beginners to start. For example, I want SIMPLE and EASY recipes. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nBut every time I google simple or easy clean recipes, I never find what I am looking for. I guess other people's \"simple and easy\" is a recipe that calls for 10-15 items that include obscure different ingredients, and takes 2-3 different cooking methods to make the meal come together ( start to boil this, while you are frying this at the same time while mixing together that). I know that is what cooking is, but you feel me right? I want to get something SIMPLE and EASY down first that can become HABIT for me before I start following interesting and unique recipes that look super good and would love to try but the stage I am at right now looking at recipes makes me dizzy and I end up caving in and do what I always do. Frozen meals here, take out there, with smoothie recipes on the side, sourdough bread with jam for breakfast to fill me up.\n\nOne time I paid a woman $30 on this website called FIVERR to create a clean meal plan for me and silly me I thought it would be tailored to what I was experiencing but I have a feeling it was just a template meal plan she gives everyone- a general clean eating meal plan. Anyway, I purchased everything on her grocery list which was almost $100 and I was overwhelmed. I tried like 2 days of it and it was just too much and most of my veggies spoiled :( I have to start shopping for every 3 days or so until I get a groove on.

Sometimes there's also salad, but is it a side dish so there's one little portion for every one. There's always dessert, which is usually pudding.\n\nUsually, they'll serve coffee and cake in the afternoon.\n\nDinner is leftovers from lunch, bread, cheese, cold cuts. Sometimes a little fruit is on offer.\n\nThe amount of fruit and vegetables is very limited. So far, I have eaten every meal and course because on some days, portions were small and I would have been hungry otherwise. But I'm starting to feel hungry all the time because of blood sugar spikes. \n\nI think I might forgo the dessert and cake and maybe buy some fruit and dark chocolate in town.

{"title": "Plant Based Clean Eating, Where Are the Calories?", "selftext": "TLDR: Seeking recommendations for high calorie, plant based, clean eating food and snacks.  \n\n\nI was diagnosed with osteoporosis last autumn, at age 39, primarily due to cancer treatment. I began weight training and working on my overall fitness that December to try to combat the bone loss, but did not see any change in my body; this led me to a dietitian back in February. Turns out I unintentionally starve myself which is why I have difficulty building muscle and bone. Since then, I've adopted clean eating habits and now track my calories to ensure that I get enough each day. (As a side note, I've followed a plant based diet for the last 12 years.)  \n\n\nSince February, I've lost about 25 pounds, which was not my goal. I'm noticing a little bit of muscle mass and I have changed my workouts to encourage more muscle building, but I still tend show a slight loss of muscle and bone each month along with the fat, which is very discouraging. My dietitian has upped my caloric intake recommendation twice since February, so that  I am now trying to consume 2000 calories a day on a plant based, clean eating diet.   \n\n\nThere is the background, here is the point: I cannot seem to find \\*high calorie\\* plant based foods that fall under the clean eating guidelines. Can anyone shed some light? I am finding it increasingly difficult to hit this benchmark each day and, look, I just don't want to break a hip!   \n\n\nAn added complication is my ADHD. It is terribly easy for me to get sidetracked and literally forget to eat a meal or a snack. For this reason, I try to keep food in the house that is quick and easy to prepare or ready to eat out of the package.   \n\n\nAny suggestions, tips, or information would be so helpful!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanEating/comments/p4zk7v/plant_based_clean_eating_where_are_the_calories/", "created_utc": 1629054240.0, "score": 5, "author": "ReluctantPosterChild", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/CleanEating/comments/p4zk7v/plant_based_clean_eating_where_are_the_calories/", "html_title": ""}

Fixed meal plan for me is just a plan that you follow the entire week, you don't make any drastic changes (maybe the only changes are when you don't have certain food for your \"diet\"). You should make it simple and sustainable. You know exactly what you have for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nMindful eating for me, on the other hand, is when you don't have any plan and just trust your instincts ; hunger and fullness cues. You eat only WHEN you feel you need food and WHAT food you need. You can easily have a scramble and toast for breakfast today, but tomorrow you can have a fruit smoothie or a bowl of oatmeal. And mindful eating for me is also when you're aware of food that is beneficial for your health, looking and performance and what has bad effect on your own body.\n\nSo, I've clearified these 2 terms and now I would like to get your opinion on what I should choose. I'm really stucked right now and can't find what works best for me. I've been searching for the answer a really long time.

Plus, I'd feel the need to stop and wash my hands after touching a hard-boiled egg, and I can't always depend on having that kind of time)\n* Vegetables and dip or hummus (not fast enough to eat, potentially messy, and I get bored of them quickly)\n\nI thought about using kefir as a base for a shake of some sort (because I can have a beverage in most meetings), but it isn't super filling on its own, and I don't know how to bulk it up. I already do a lot of fruit with breakfast, so I don't want to add too much more sugar (even the kind that comes in fruit), and I don't want to go the protein powder route because I just don't trust the stuff (and I don't like the chalkiness, the taste, or the cost).\n\nMy other thought was homemade protein bites, but the only ones I've ever made were really high in fat and sugar because they were made with peanut butter and honey that was mixed with oats and either cocoa powder or dried fruit (yummy, but Cronomer already gets upset about my fat and sugar intake, so I'm trying to cut back, not add more).\n\nWhy does to-go food have to be so annoying (and why do so many people think that foods that require utensils and/or heating up are valid grab-and-go snacks?

I'm wondering if it's a coincidence or if it's possible to get such quick symptoms from a few grains. \n\nFor context, I've been \n\u2022 vegetable oil free for almost 3 months,\n\u2022 gluten, dairy, soy free for 4 months\n\u2022 grain free for 1 month. \n\nThe only reason I ate those foods today was because I didn't have access to other foods and my blood sugar was very low(pre-diabetic). Protein wasn't going to raise it fast enough so I made the decision to eat the only carbs available: my boyfriend's pantry items. \n\nWhat are your experiences with these foods?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanEating/comments/10kclpj/symptoms_after_reintroducing_vegetable_oils_grains/", "created_utc": 1674585573.0, "score": 1, "author": "Mediocre_Hat4988", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/CleanEating/comments/10kclpj/symptoms_after_reintroducing_vegetable_oils_grains/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Food item check for \"clean\"", "selftext": "I have just started my eating clean journey. I have a question about a few of my food items.  \n\n\nAvocado Oil Mayo: Before starting this, I bought avocado oil mayo to be healthier. All the ingredients are natural whole foods except EDTA. It is the very last ingredient, so I imagine there isn't much in it. Is this a no, then? I am hoping not. Everything else in the ingredient list is real whole foods. \n\nButter: We have a bulk butter stash, all great value brand, in our freezer. The unsalted butter lists pasteurized cream (milk), natural flavoring as the ingredients. I am confused why that natural flavoring is there since the salted version by the same brand is just pasteurized cream (milk), salt. So does this mean I just need to avoid the unsalted, but can have the salted one? Yes, I am aware that is is better to do grass-fed butter, but that is going to be a no go with our grocery budget. \n\nGranola: I buy the bear naked brand and put it on plain yogurt. I love it. I checked all the ingredients on the three flavors that I buy. For the most part, the sugar they use is natural: honey. But one of them has sugar listed in the cranberry ingredients and another has sugar listed in the banana chip ingredients. So the granola as a whole is sweetened with just honey, but they have sugar added one of the fruits in the granola. Because it is so minor, I am hoping this isn't a huge deal. If so, is there a better granola brand out there?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSnacks: any recommendations for clean eating snacks that are already prepared? I work for a few hours in the day while a nanny is watching my kids, so it causes me to eat lunch a little bit later in the day, as I need to use the whole time my nanny is here to work, not make lunch. So I get by with snacks. I have always used raisins, trail mixes with just fruit and nuts, apple, oranges, and plain yogurt with granola as my snacks. All my trail mixes have added sugar, I discovered, and I already mentioned the issue with the granola.
