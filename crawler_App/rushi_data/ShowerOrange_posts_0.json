{"title": "This sub helped me with my shower anxiety attacks", "selftext": "So about a year ago, I had an incident and a waterpark which resulted in me getting stuck in a water slide. I remember being scared to death, and had cold water running down on my on all sides which cause me to have a panic attack. I\u2019d never been that scared in my life.\nEver since then, every time I took a shower I would get horrible panic attacks. I\u2019d imagine myself stuck in a tiny tube, water gushing all around me, and no way for me to escape. I\u2019d have to shower with the curtain open and someone in the room next to me. I could never be directly in the water for more than a few seconds at a time.\nWell I discovered this sub, and never really tried eating oranges in the shower. I browsed the sub and thought it was funny but that was it. Well, after hearing everyone\u2019s testimonies I finally decided to give it a try.\nI was finally able to stay in the shower for more than a few seconds at a time, and I was able to partially close the curtain. I remembered on all of the comments saying just to relax and enjoy, and that\u2019s exactly what I did.\nI\u2019ve done it a few times and I can happily say I took my first shower with the curtain completely closed in over a year. It\u2019s was stupidly emotional.\nThank you all. Thank you thank you thank you. I wish I could hug you all. This has been one of the hardest obstacles in my life and now I\u2019m almost over it.

Has anyone else had this problem, and if so can you help me?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/7pl6ck/guys_i_messed_up/", "created_utc": 1515640379.0, "score": 710, "author": "MichaelScott315", "num_comments": 30, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/7pl6ck/guys_i_messed_up/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "A First-Timer's Critical Analysis of Eating an Orange in the Shower.", "selftext": "I stumbled upon this subreddit earlier today from a r/AITA post, and I was intrigued by the idea.  When I learned that there was only one fresh orange in the house that no one wanted, I decided to try it.  Having just finished my first shower-orange, here are my thoughts on the experience:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Walking into the shower with an orange in your hand feels very strange.  I don't think I've ever walked into the shower with something in hand before.  I like different and weird experiences like that.\n\n2. The mess cleans itself up.\n\n3. Tearing the orange apart with your bare hands feels primal and satisfying.\n\n4. The smell and taste of the orange reminds me of eating orange slices as a kid after soccer practice.  That may have been the last time I ate a raw orange.  Nice hit of nostalgia.\n\n5. The shower smells of citrus for the remainder of the shower.\n\n6. It's an excuse to spend more time in the shower.  Who doesn't like chilling in the shower?\n\n7. Good dose of vitamin C.\n\nCons:\n\n1. What do you do with the bits of peel?  Gathering them up and throwing them out in the bathroom trash was a bit of a pain.  If I did this everyday, I would need a better system.\n\n2. Some bits of orange are going down the drain.  Again, if I did it everyday, I would worry about the bits of orange building up in the drain/pipes.\n\n3. The orange juice coats your hands and does not come off as easily as I would like.  I accidentally wiped some orange juice across my face during the shower, which wasn't pleasant.\n\nThe orange itself tasted like an orange.  I don't think the shower does anything to enhance the flavor, but I also don't think it's supposed to.  It definitely enhances the experience though.  Overall I'd say it was a good-to-great experience, 8/10.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/d59ryi/a_firsttimers_critical_analysis_of_eating_an/", "created_utc": 1568682500.0, "score": 675, "author": "PrimePain", "num_comments": 64, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/d59ryi/a_firsttimers_critical_analysis_of_eating_an/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I\u2019m currently sitting in a towel and shampoo hair trying to write this all down. It was...\n\nLife.\n\nChanging.\n\nThe shower orange was something like never before. The juxtaposition of cold citrus to steamy water. The primitive bite into the orange, juice running down. No sticky mess. No clean up. (Other than the peel, of course.) The first bite into the orange, accompanied by the steamy shower, brings back something within. Like out ancestors. Bathing in water and eating fruit and just living it up. There\u2019s something so simple yet wonderful about the mundane act of a shower spiced by a plain and simple orange. 10/10. Quite appealing.\n\n(Shower notes for future reference and maximum enjoyment): \n\nREFRIGERATE the oranges! Cold = best. \n\nHot shower. Steamy. \n\nLastly. The mindset. I saw some posts previous to my endeavor saying that \u201cthis is crap, a bunch of horse shit, blah blah just an orange in a shower.\u201d \n\nIt is what you make of it. Embrace the orange.

{"title": "My Recipe to Success: A Suggestion for Newcomers", "selftext": "Hello everyone! Anyone else always get the urge to make a post on here after they've had a shower orange? I sure do, and this one is for anyone who:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Tried shower orange, but didnt get much from it \n\n2) Hasnt tried it and is looking for pointers\n\n3) Is simply looking for new ways to step up their shower oranging game\n\nand anyone else who might find this post helpful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, this recipe includes lots of optional components, and you can obviously mix and match however you want. Let it be noted that the full experience includes, of course, everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMandatory ingredients: \n\n\\>Orange (or any other citrus fruit, though I do not recommend lemons for beginners)\n\n\\>Shower (or bath)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOptional (but highly recommended) ingredients:\n\n\\>Fridge \n\n\\>Waterproof bluetooth headphones + your favourite music \n\n\\>Dark bathroom\n\n\\>The ability to put yourself into the mind of a predator mercilessly ripping into its prey\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how I do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter completing my grocery haul, I give my orange a good wash before putting it in the fridge overnight. If you take anything from this post, let it be the chillage of your citrus. Im 100% serious when I say that this can make or break the experience. \n\nI usually shower in the evenings, but just do it whenever it feels right. Maybe you open your fridge and see the fruit calling out to you in the morning, and if you have the time, do not feel bad about giving in to the call. However, this will make it a little harder to truly darken your bathroom. \n\nI dont have any windows in mine, so the process is very easy for me. I close the door and shove some old clothes in the bottom gap. Yes, I shower in complete darkness. It is exhilerating. Be careful, it might take you some time to get truly familiar with the layout of your bathroom in the dark. Make use of your hands, smashing your nose into a wall may dampen the experience. \n\nI already have my headphones on at this point. I have a playlist specifically constructed for showering, but sometimes I just let all my saved songs play on shuffle. Any unwanted songs are simply skipped, and the immersion doesnt get ruined, even if you dont catch an out-of-place tune immediately. And even so, getting back into the zone is something that happens completely on its own. \n\nLets recap. I am standing in complete and utter darkness, music is playing, the orange is either being held by me or resting inside the shower. Dont worry, it wont warm up that quickly. Take your time. Have I mentioned that this process will make your showering a lot more time consuming and water-wasting? Yeah... maybe keep an eye on your water bill. \n\nThe prep is done. It is time. Get in the shower. Now, I know some people like their cold showers, you do you, but I \\*highly\\* recommend choosing hot water here. Trust me. This isnt a \"get clean quickly before work\" kind of thing, its an experience. \n\nI often sit down because its even more relaxing, but standing can also help to get you into the predator mindset. Yeah, I wasnt joking, for me this part is just as important as fridging the fruit.\n\nWhen you step into that shower, thats your cue to unleash yourself. You are an animal! This is your chance to act like one! Screw any tools, you only need your teeth and hands here. Take a big bite, spit it out, take another one. Rip the thing apart with your teeth and hands, bury your face in the flesh, scarf it down like its the last thing you'll ever eat! Take the pieces into both hands and take alternating bites. No one can see you! You are free! Completely and utterly let yourself go. The more juice you get on yourself, the better. Fuck it, rub the thing over your body like its a goddamn exfoliator, and then continue eating, because whos gonna stop you? God? The government? The orange is Pompeii, and you, my friend, are Vesuvio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe carnage will end at one point. You will be covered in sweet nectar, bits of orange in your teeth, theres pieces of peel on the ground. Let the hot water wash over you, let it carry your sins down the drain. Theres music playing. You might have forgotten about it during your feast. Now, its your tether. You can start cleaning yourself up now, or remain in this in-between state just a little bit longer. You deserve it. \n\nHow you finish your shower is up to you. Turning the water off is always hard, but of course necessary. I like to clean the peel up as soon as Im done and dressed, otherwise it can get stuck on the floor, but if youre willing to risk it for the sweet orange smell, youre welcome to leave it. (Careful, the smell can turn sour relatively quickly.)\n\nFor me, shower oranging is not something I do every time. I want to keep it a little bit special, for bad days, or just for days where Im really in the mood for a good citrus treatment. Its also, as you may have noticed, pretty time- and water-consuming. Dont feel bad about it though! You deserve nice things, one long shower every on\u00b4ce in a while will kill neither you, nor the planet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhoever may be reading this: I hope you enjoyed this post. Whether you decide to try out my advice, or simply appreciate my writing, Im glad you stuck around 'til the end. \n\nCheers, and happy showering!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "created_utc": 1649098898.0, "score": 189, "author": "None", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Went for the bottle. Took the orange instead.", "selftext": "Disclaimer: While writing this, I realised it had turned into a sort of dump for my thoughts, only tied into the art of shower oranging at the very end. It starts out dark, and it stays dark for a while. Dont read if you're triggered by mentions of alcoholism or other mental illnesses. Im sorry. \n\n(This is a throwaway for a reason. If you recognize my writing style, don't mention it. Please.) \n--------- \n\nRough. Rough days, nay, weeks and months. Endless cycle, at least as far as I can see. Can I break it? It would mean breaking myself. Shatter my inner form into millions of pieces, pick out whats salvagable, leave behind whats tainted. Be left with a pile of shards too sharp to touch and reassemble. Wait til a gloved hand comes along to gently put me back together. But how long? How long to sit and wait, the Whole of Me in splinters? Too long. \n\nIts a slow process, recovery. Especially with no help. Especially when you dont even know what you're recovering from, exactly. Vague pictures of friends turned enemies. An inexplicable terror when confronted with loud, sudden noises. A self esteem so low and deep that the Mariana Trench grows jealous. \n\nNot every day is this bad, thank fuck. I would've been dead a long time ago. I have friends again, and I enjoy every second I spend with them. I have, somehow, made it into university (though this is now a huge part of my struggles as well. Uni work is hard, and harder when you dont have the strength to stay sober). \nToday, I saw the rain, and I went outside to walk in it for the better part of two hours. I saw a snail, and I watched it glide along the wet leafs. It was beautiful, a perfect escape. \n\nOpening the door to my apartment shut it all down. Confronted with piles and piles of paper, work to be done, no rest in sight, at least not without taking shortcuts. It crushes you. After a while, waking up to a new day is dreadful. More work. No sleep. And oh, the guilt. The GUILT that smothers you for not doing what is expected. I barely keep up with my classes, but even thats a lie. I dont. I dont. I do the bare minimum for no one to catch on. I spend my days in a numb stasis. Unable to complete the work, the work that keeps piling and piling, no end in sight, courses followed by exams followed by the next semester, no end, no end. \n\nCould you bear it? Are you struggling, too? Are we alone, together?\u00a0 \nI never knew how people became alcoholics. Everyone knows about the dangers. You try it maybe once or twice. Day-drinking, I mean. Hopefully with friends. If you're not there yet, then don't even think about starting. Never, I repeat, Never take to the bottle when you're alone. You won't realise it's a habit until it's too late. \nI could still stop. I think. \nIt's not every day. It's not that much. But oh, how enchanting it is, opening the fridge and seeing the bottle, thinking: 'One sip won't hurt', until it turns into two and three and four and- \n\nComing home today was rough. I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't so cold from the rain that had long since penetrated my clothes and gotten to my skin. I hadn't taken a jacket with me. \nA perfect time, a perfect situation for a shower. \nAnd as with every shower these days, I went for the fridge, and reached for the bottle. Not open yet. I had emptied the last one a day earlier. \nI was about to close the door and resume with my harmful routine, when something caught my eye. \nAn orange. A singular, ripe orange I had picked up from the store earlier this week. I stared. I fought with myself. I picked it up, and put the bottle away. For another day. \n\nIt's been a while since my last time. Two months, maybe? I got caught up in... everything. The thought only crossed my mind occasionally, but I was always too tired to endulge in it. Walk past the fruit stand, grab my weekly groceries and leave. No thoughts spared on some citrussy endeavour. \n\nGetting into the shower was... almost ceremonial. I sat down. I always sit. Standing takes too much energy. I sat, letting the hot water almost burn my skin, until I forgot the world around me, and myself too. This time, I was cradling a citrus fruit, for the first time in a long time. My fingers were digging into the skin. I wanted to rip and tear. I wanted to destroy. But I was too tired. \nI opened the peel slowly. With care and precision, instead of hunger and beast-like urgency. \nEvery bite was enjoyed slowly. The drops of cold juice presented a stark contrast to the steaming water, but I got used to them hitting my stomach in semi regular intervals. \nI had my eyes closed. It was peaceful. \nIn the end, I cradled the empty peel. It would have been a good moment to cry, had it been a movie. But I just sat in silence. \nTurned off the water, disposed of the waste. Sat down and wrote this post. \n\nIt's been over an hour.\nI still want to drink. Every time I look to my left, I see the open book that I abandoned hours ago, waiting for me to come back. Keep studying. It's not even hard. I just can't bring myself to do it. It's always been this way. Doing things, no matter what, is the most difficult hurdle in my life. \n\nBut there's one thing I can do. Start buying more oranges, and start endulging in the beauty of it all again. Every sip traded for a bite is a good thing. Every shower I can finish without going for the bottle is a win. \n\n- \n\nI've written multiple shower oranging manifestos. Some public, some only for myself. This one will be posted, albeit with no ties to my main account. I need to share my thoughts with someone, and I believe that this community will not judge me. And maybe, just maybe, one person who reads this will be able to relate, and feel a little less alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "created_utc": 1654706446.0, "score": 175, "author": "ThrThrThrorange", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "html_title": ""}

As I approached the shower I had quite the confusion, as holding an orange while entering a shower is not a task that I have ever done. \n\nWhile in the shower, I was soon to realize that I needed to peel the orange with my wet hands. Primal instincts kicked in and there I was, tearing the orange out of the rind with my sopping hands. The sweet smell of oranges filled the shower, and I allowed the pieces of the skin fall to the shower floor. I proceeded to eat the orange and I enjoyed the light snack, before I proceeded to wash the rest of myself. By the end of the shower, the bathroom smelled like oranges and I felt clean. \n\nI will say that having a shower orange is a pleasant experience, but I cannot find myself buying multiple oranges to enjoy each time I shower.

{"title": "The Cult Doctrine", "selftext": "I feel very strongly that this comment by @HugeHouseplant must be its own individual post. It deserves so many more upvotes. \n\nThe Ritual of the Shower Orange\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nBegin by preparing your shower space. Remove any distractions, ensuring the environment is calm and quiet. Allow the natural light, if any, to create a soft, diffused glow. Adjust the water to a hot, steamy temperature that envelops you like an ancient, welcoming embrace.\n\nPreparation\n\n1. \u2060Select the Orange: Choose a ripe, juicy orange. Feel its weight and texture, and appreciate the vibrant color that promises a burst of citrus delight.\n2. \u2060Prepare Yourself: Disrobe completely and step into the shower. Let the hot water flow over you, relaxing your muscles and clearing your mind. Take deep breaths, inhaling the steam and anticipating the forthcoming ritual.\n\nThe Ritual\n\n1. \u2060Initial Caress: Hold the orange in your hand, feeling its coolness against your hot, wet skin. Take a moment to connect with the fruit, appreciating its journey from a distant grove to your shower.\n2. \u2060Ripping the Peel: With deliberate, forceful movements, begin to rip the peel from the orange. Let the water cascade over your hands, washing away the peel and releasing the orange\u2019s fragrant oils. As you tear off each piece of the peel, throw it onto the shower floor. Watch as the pieces scatter, creating an almost mystical scene, their essence mingling with the steam to fill the air with a powerful, invigorating citrus aroma.\n3. Dividing the Segments: Gently separate the orange into individual segments. Feel the plump, juicy flesh beneath your fingers. Take a moment to admire the segments, appreciating their perfect, natural symmetry.\n4. The First Bite: Raise a segment to your lips and bite into it with gusto. Let the juice explode in your mouth, savoring the sweet, tangy flavor. Allow the excess juice to trickle down your chin, neck, and chest, mingling with the hot water. Feel the primal pleasure of eating with your hands, like an animal, connected to the raw, unfiltered experience of nourishing yourself.\n5. Continued Indulgence: Continue to eat the orange, segment by segment. With each bite, embrace the messiness, feeling the juice run freely down your body. Close your eyes and lose yourself in the sensory overload\u2014the taste, the texture, the sound of the shower, the heat of the water, and the feel of the juice on your skin.\n6. Embrace the Moment: As you finish the orange, take a moment to relish the culmination of the ritual. Feel the satisfaction of the fruit in your stomach, the lingering taste on your lips, and the refreshing cleanliness from the shower. Allow yourself to feel both primal and cleansed, connected to a simple yet profound act of nourishment and indulgence.\n\nCompletion\n\n1. Rinse and Reflect: Rinse off any remaining juice, feeling the hot water cleanse you. Reflect on the experience, how it made you feel, and the simple joy it brought.\n2. Clean Up: Carefully collect the orange peels from the shower floor and dispose of them properly.

{"title": "The ShowerOrange CULPRIT!!", "selftext": "My mom was getting frustrated because she kept finding orange shavings in the shower drain. At this time, my sister's boyfriend started staying with us, so she assumed it was him that was weirdly eating oranges in the shower. So, my mom goes to my sister and says \"hey, please tell your boyfriend to keep food out of the shower because it clogs up the drain\". Cut to my (at times hostile) sister being really weirded out and annoyed that my mother would assume something so bizarre of him. My mother kept asking my sister to tell him to stop for about a week and my sister would always just shrug her off because, well, why the hell would her boyfriend be eating oranges in the shower? After enough of this, my sister finally goes to her boyfriend and asks if he's doing it. He says no. Confusion strikes. How the hell are orange shavings getting in the drain? Cue my entire family being questioned about this (up until this point I had no idea this was going on because I guess nobody expected me to be the culprit) and the \"shower orange\" debate started up in my family. At one point we all sat down for breakfast and my sister mentions it passive aggressively because she was getting annoyed. After hearing her mention it, I go \"oh yeah it's a thing online, I've been doing it lately\". Without my anticipation, my entire family finds themselves in uproar. \"IT'S YOU. YOU'RE THE SHOWER ORANGE EATER. YOU'RE THE ONE CLOGGING UP THE DRAIN. WHY THE HELL ARE YOU EATING ORANGES IN THE SHOWER.\" I was shocked. I had no idea this was an issue. I explain to them the concept of aromatherapy (it was a bullshit explanation but I needed to say something) with the astonished looks on all their faces. It still gets brought up at every familiy reunion and to this day I still eat a orange in the shower!!!! \nWoooooo ShowerORANGE!!!

{"title": "Icarian Relief", "selftext": "A few days ago, one of my friends told me that I \"simply had to try eating an orange in the shower.\" If this friend is to be believed, the experience approaches the divine; a conquest of pure sensory freedom. Thinking I had no reason to doubt this friend and eager for new experiences, I decided I must try.\n\n  \nSo today, I took myself over to the grocery store where I carefully and thoughtfully perused the citrus section. This was to be a formative moment, a memory for the grandchildren. It was essential I selected my tools well. I determined that clementines were too ordinary for the job. Yet I found that the thought of blood-orange was too dramatic. The Mandarins were too small, and the cara cara oranges felt too self important with their prominent display. For a moment I thought all was lost. I simply could not attempt such a feat ill equipped. Then I saw it. The most perfectly plump, juicely ripe morsel. It was obvious really. After all, I too would have mine exposed. \n\n  \nA navel orange was the only choice. \n\n  \nUpon arriving home I announced my intention to the husband who begrudgingly agreed to observe the ritual. I gathered the necessary supplies with eager anticipation: the orange, a shower chair, and a bowl for the peels of course, and stepped into the bathroom. I ran the water as hot as it would go and waited for the room to steam up.\n\n  \nFriends. Dear ones. I cannot lie. I peeled that orange with abandon. The juices evaporated into the steam of the shower adding a layer of fragrance that drove me to bliss, and then beyond. I became feral. I pounced upon my meal with the gusto of a cheetah to a gazelle, like a vulture to carrion, like some guy in a fedora to an IPA. I knew at once the taste of ichyr. I stared God in the face and knew he had made me, an animal, for this experience. It was a feast of transcendence.\n\n  \nAs I'm sure you've realized by now, this story is not a happy one. It was obvious, really, from the start. But I ask you  friends, should I really  have known better? Would you have? Could have evaded such tantalizing temptation? Or would you have known that simple truth: every story of triumph is merely the opening act of a tragedy? It was hubris of the worst kind. \n\n  \nAt one point, mid citric mastication, my hand slipped. The precious orange began to fall. I grabbed. And dear ones, I am ashamed to admit it...\n\n  \nI squeezed.\n\n  \nThere was a horrid second of a realization as I felt the meat resist and give way. It was followed by an even shorter instant of hope that physics and chance might conspire to my benefit this time. It was not to be. The juice shot directly into my eyes. \n\n  \nI've often heard it debated, those last thoughts of Icarus as he plummeted towards the sea, facing certain death. Was he consumed by fear? Was he regretful? Was he ecstatic? \n\n  \nFriends, as someone who has recently flown too close to the sun, I venture it was none of these. No, I know what Icarus felt in those last seconds just before he faced oblivion. It wasn't fear. It wasn't ecstasy. It was relief, relief in the knowledge that though he would live no more, he was freed from the burden of waking tomorrow knowing it was possible to fly. \n\n  \nIcarus was the lucky one.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/19e87rk/icarian_relief/", "created_utc": 1706069268.0, "score": 141, "author": "Abject-Ratio2346", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/19e87rk/icarian_relief/", "html_title": ""}

I always imagined having an \u201cahhhh finally mine\u201d moment when buying a house, and I think eating an Orange in the shower is what finally did it.\n\nnothing but my hands, teeth, the hot water and a fresh Florida orange. As I fumbled around with my perfect sphere I eventually just took a small bite to puncture the outer layer and started peeling back; I had envisioned getting all the skin off before I started eating it; and basking in the glory of it before inhaling like an apple. But something happened, something overcame me; once I had a clear passage to the core I started shredding it up. Probably 5-6 minutes or hard but satisfying labor later; I dry off and feel cleaner and more human than I ever have.

{"title": "My story; First time eating an orange in the shower: 15/10 would recommend.", "selftext": "I looked at this sub, questioning why it existed. I laughed at everybody eating oranges in the shower, and mocked their very presence in this world. For months, I kept r/ShowerOrange in the back of my mind. For months, I rolled my eyes at these beautiful redditors.\n\nThen one day, I turned on the water to take a shower and felt the steam rise up my back. It surrounded me as I opened the curtain to test the water, but my hand quickly flinched back due to the heat. And something was missing. I didn\u2019t get my usual sense of comfort with the hot showers I took every night.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered something. Was it just a coincidence? Magic? A sign? Or was it just simply fate? Because I remembered I had an orange sitting in the back of my fridge. I left the bathroom, on a personal mission to see if it was still there. And I saw it. A beautiful, juicy, deeply perfect orange on the bottom shelf.\n\nSo I picked it up and took it into the bathroom. I was taken aback by my own decision. I couldn\u2019t believe I was really going to do it. I left it on the counter, second guessing myself. Thinking I was crazy. I hopped in the shower, missing something again. I stared at the luscious orange skin, calling me like temptation I\u2019d never experienced before. \n\nBefore I could stop myself or even realize what I had done, I was tearing into the orange with my teeth. I ripped it apart like a savage, untamable beast. The juice dripped down my chin like the blood from my fresh kill, which was swiftly washed away by the current of the shower. The peels fell to my orange-soaked feet, carelessly discarded with to get to the beautiful juice within. The fresh citrusy smell erupted into the air as I stared at what I had done.

I got in the shower and I peeled and ate an orange. \n\nI felt so silly in there and I began to realize that maybe that\u2019s the point of it. I started peeling the orange and (after making sure nothing could fit down the drain) I just dropped the pieces wherever. I felt like a kid again. I wasn\u2019t thinking about work (or lack thereof for me), I wasn\u2019t thinking about laundry, all I could focus on was peeling this orange and taking a shower. \n\nIt smelled so good. I love it when the orange oils just fill up the air. The cold orange against the hot water was a delicious sensational pairing I was not expecting. \n\nAfter thinking about this experience (because I have to contemplate *everything*) I kinda realized something. Whenever you go into something with a certain set of expectations, you can often be blinded by the things unfolding right in front of you. I stopped looking for an amazing, transcendental experience and just learned to enjoy the orange.

{"title": "Discovering the Darkness Inside of Me", "selftext": "Last week I had the shower orange urge for the first time and I couldn\u2019t let go. The idea of someone taking an orange into the shower as a daily ritual shook something within me. Initially I was amused by the idea, but over the course of a few days and showers it grew into something more. Every shower I took I imagined how it would feel in the moment\u2026 what it would be like to be holding an orange\u2026 so smooth and soft and plump\u2026 warm soapy water dripping down my hair and back\u2026 how I\u2019d be so very fortunate to have this big ass.. . fucking massive, sweet, sticky, oozing, genetically modified orange in my hands. \n\nA primal urge began to awaken inside me. The last shower I took I was completely helpless to it, I took that innocent orange into the shower and cranked the water to the hottest it could possibly go. The bathroom slowly began to fill with steam completely and my skin was burning very badly\u2026. The poor orange was unrecognizable. i dont think i even got any of it into my stomach. i was on all fours just tearing it to shreds with my hands and teeth like a starving rabid animal. When i got out of the shower my roommate knocks on the door and says he heard growling sounds but i don\u2019t remember making those sounds - I say it must have been a dog in the hallway of our complex. Cleanup is a mess and i can\u2019t leave any evidence (the shower is shared). \n\nI feel oddly relaxed and as though my mind has been cleansed, however i am also unsettled by the unusually savage manner in which I behaved. The experience felt out-of-body almost psychedelic, like i was on the cusp of secret knowledge. I think i will continue to follow this path and see where it takes me. \n\n* i would like to thank this sub for showing me the truth god bless *", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/wr1c9y/discovering_the_darkness_inside_of_me/", "created_utc": 1660773274.0, "score": 126, "author": "StickySalamander", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/wr1c9y/discovering_the_darkness_inside_of_me/", "html_title": ""}

If you recognize my writing style, don't mention it. Please.) \n--------- \n\nRough. Rough days, nay, weeks and months. Endless cycle, at least as far as I can see. Can I break it? It would mean breaking myself. Shatter my inner form into millions of pieces, pick out whats salvagable, leave behind whats tainted. Be left with a pile of shards too sharp to touch and reassemble. Wait til a gloved hand comes along to gently put me back together. But how long? How long to sit and wait, the Whole of Me in splinters? Too long. \n\nIts a slow process, recovery. Especially with no help. Especially when you dont even know what you're recovering from, exactly. Vague pictures of friends turned enemies. An inexplicable terror when confronted with loud, sudden noises. A self esteem so low and deep that the Mariana Trench grows jealous. \n\nNot every day is this bad, thank fuck. I would've been dead a long time ago. I have friends again, and I enjoy every second I spend with them. I have, somehow, made it into university (though this is now a huge part of my struggles as well. Uni work is hard, and harder when you dont have the strength to stay sober). \nToday, I saw the rain, and I went outside to walk in it for the better part of two hours. I saw a snail, and I watched it glide along the wet leafs. It was beautiful, a perfect escape. \n\nOpening the door to my apartment shut it all down. Confronted with piles and piles of paper, work to be done, no rest in sight, at least not without taking shortcuts. It crushes you. After a while, waking up to a new day is dreadful. More work. No sleep. And oh, the guilt. The GUILT that smothers you for not doing what is expected. I barely keep up with my classes, but even thats a lie. I dont. I dont. I do the bare minimum for no one to catch on. I spend my days in a numb stasis. Unable to complete the work, the work that keeps piling and piling, no end in sight, courses followed by exams followed by the next semester, no end, no end. \n\nCould you bear it? Are you struggling, too? Are we alone, together?\u00a0 \nI never knew how people became alcoholics. Everyone knows about the dangers. You try it maybe once or twice. Day-drinking, I mean. Hopefully with friends. If you're not there yet, then don't even think about starting. Never, I repeat, Never take to the bottle when you're alone. You won't realise it's a habit until it's too late. \nI could still stop. I think. \nIt's not every day. It's not that much. But oh, how enchanting it is, opening the fridge and seeing the bottle, thinking: 'One sip won't hurt', until it turns into two and three and four and- \n\nComing home today was rough. I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't so cold from the rain that had long since penetrated my clothes and gotten to my skin. I hadn't taken a jacket with me. \nA perfect time, a perfect situation for a shower. \nAnd as with every shower these days, I went for the fridge, and reached for the bottle. Not open yet. I had emptied the last one a day earlier. \nI was about to close the door and resume with my harmful routine, when something caught my eye. \nAn orange. A singular, ripe orange I had picked up from the store earlier this week. I stared. I fought with myself. I picked it up, and put the bottle away. For another day. \n\nIt's been a while since my last time. Two months, maybe? I got caught up in... everything. The thought only crossed my mind occasionally, but I was always too tired to endulge in it. Walk past the fruit stand, grab my weekly groceries and leave. No thoughts spared on some citrussy endeavour. \n\nGetting into the shower was... almost ceremonial. I sat down. I always sit. Standing takes too much energy. I sat, letting the hot water almost burn my skin, until I forgot the world around me, and myself too. This time, I was cradling a citrus fruit, for the first time in a long time. My fingers were digging into the skin. I wanted to rip and tear. I wanted to destroy. But I was too tired. \nI opened the peel slowly. With care and precision, instead of hunger and beast-like urgency. \nEvery bite was enjoyed slowly. The drops of cold juice presented a stark contrast to the steaming water, but I got used to them hitting my stomach in semi regular intervals. \nI had my eyes closed. It was peaceful. \nIn the end, I cradled the empty peel. It would have been a good moment to cry, had it been a movie. But I just sat in silence. \nTurned off the water, disposed of the waste. Sat down and wrote this post. \n\nIt's been over an hour.\nI still want to drink. Every time I look to my left, I see the open book that I abandoned hours ago, waiting for me to come back. Keep studying. It's not even hard. I just can't bring myself to do it. It's always been this way. Doing things, no matter what, is the most difficult hurdle in my life. \n\nBut there's one thing I can do. Start buying more oranges, and start endulging in the beauty of it all again. Every sip traded for a bite is a good thing. Every shower I can finish without going for the bottle is a win. \n\n- \n\nI've written multiple shower oranging manifestos. Some public, some only for myself. This one will be posted, albeit with no ties to my main account. I need to share my thoughts with someone, and I believe that this community will not judge me. And maybe, just maybe, one person who reads this will be able to relate, and feel a little less alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "created_utc": 1654706446.0, "score": 173, "author": "ThrThrThrorange", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "So I ate an orange in the shower the other day.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve always been a huge germaphobe about showers. I touch as little as possible and die inside every time I touch the shower wall. I have to consciously uncurl my toes. So I thought, why not? Shower orange. Maybe it\u2019ll distract me.\n\nI brought my orange in the bathroom with a solo cup for the scraps, since I\u2019d probably just die before touching the floor to get the peels. Also to set it in because if it touched any shower stuff I wouldn\u2019t eat it. It was fresh out of the fridge, which was great for eating but bad for peeling. Made my fingertips hurt - I\u2019d forgotten how much of a pain in the ass peeling oranges can be. I also did it before actually getting in, which probably wasn\u2019t following protocol. Whatever. I don\u2019t have enough hot water for that.\n\nGot in. Started eating orange by just biting right in, which seemed like the right technique. Shower smelled great instantly. I forgot that eating it like that would hurt though (I have a lip piercing that pinches when I eat stuff like apples and large burgers) so I switched to wedges halfway through. Bummer.

{"title": "My Recipe to Success: A Suggestion for Newcomers", "selftext": "Hello everyone! Anyone else always get the urge to make a post on here after they've had a shower orange? I sure do, and this one is for anyone who:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Tried shower orange, but didnt get much from it \n\n2) Hasnt tried it and is looking for pointers\n\n3) Is simply looking for new ways to step up their shower oranging game\n\nand anyone else who might find this post helpful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, this recipe includes lots of optional components, and you can obviously mix and match however you want. Let it be noted that the full experience includes, of course, everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMandatory ingredients: \n\n\\>Orange (or any other citrus fruit, though I do not recommend lemons for beginners)\n\n\\>Shower (or bath)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOptional (but highly recommended) ingredients:\n\n\\>Fridge \n\n\\>Waterproof bluetooth headphones + your favourite music \n\n\\>Dark bathroom\n\n\\>The ability to put yourself into the mind of a predator mercilessly ripping into its prey\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how I do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter completing my grocery haul, I give my orange a good wash before putting it in the fridge overnight. If you take anything from this post, let it be the chillage of your citrus. Im 100% serious when I say that this can make or break the experience. \n\nI usually shower in the evenings, but just do it whenever it feels right. Maybe you open your fridge and see the fruit calling out to you in the morning, and if you have the time, do not feel bad about giving in to the call. However, this will make it a little harder to truly darken your bathroom. \n\nI dont have any windows in mine, so the process is very easy for me. I close the door and shove some old clothes in the bottom gap. Yes, I shower in complete darkness. It is exhilerating. Be careful, it might take you some time to get truly familiar with the layout of your bathroom in the dark. Make use of your hands, smashing your nose into a wall may dampen the experience. \n\nI already have my headphones on at this point. I have a playlist specifically constructed for showering, but sometimes I just let all my saved songs play on shuffle. Any unwanted songs are simply skipped, and the immersion doesnt get ruined, even if you dont catch an out-of-place tune immediately. And even so, getting back into the zone is something that happens completely on its own. \n\nLets recap. I am standing in complete and utter darkness, music is playing, the orange is either being held by me or resting inside the shower. Dont worry, it wont warm up that quickly. Take your time. Have I mentioned that this process will make your showering a lot more time consuming and water-wasting? Yeah... maybe keep an eye on your water bill. \n\nThe prep is done. It is time. Get in the shower. Now, I know some people like their cold showers, you do you, but I \\*highly\\* recommend choosing hot water here. Trust me. This isnt a \"get clean quickly before work\" kind of thing, its an experience. \n\nI often sit down because its even more relaxing, but standing can also help to get you into the predator mindset. Yeah, I wasnt joking, for me this part is just as important as fridging the fruit.\n\nWhen you step into that shower, thats your cue to unleash yourself. You are an animal! This is your chance to act like one! Screw any tools, you only need your teeth and hands here. Take a big bite, spit it out, take another one. Rip the thing apart with your teeth and hands, bury your face in the flesh, scarf it down like its the last thing you'll ever eat! Take the pieces into both hands and take alternating bites. No one can see you! You are free! Completely and utterly let yourself go. The more juice you get on yourself, the better. Fuck it, rub the thing over your body like its a goddamn exfoliator, and then continue eating, because whos gonna stop you? God? The government? The orange is Pompeii, and you, my friend, are Vesuvio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe carnage will end at one point. You will be covered in sweet nectar, bits of orange in your teeth, theres pieces of peel on the ground. Let the hot water wash over you, let it carry your sins down the drain. Theres music playing. You might have forgotten about it during your feast. Now, its your tether. You can start cleaning yourself up now, or remain in this in-between state just a little bit longer. You deserve it. \n\nHow you finish your shower is up to you. Turning the water off is always hard, but of course necessary. I like to clean the peel up as soon as Im done and dressed, otherwise it can get stuck on the floor, but if youre willing to risk it for the sweet orange smell, youre welcome to leave it. (Careful, the smell can turn sour relatively quickly.)\n\nFor me, shower oranging is not something I do every time. I want to keep it a little bit special, for bad days, or just for days where Im really in the mood for a good citrus treatment. Its also, as you may have noticed, pretty time- and water-consuming. Dont feel bad about it though! You deserve nice things, one long shower every on\u00b4ce in a while will kill neither you, nor the planet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhoever may be reading this: I hope you enjoyed this post. Whether you decide to try out my advice, or simply appreciate my writing, Im glad you stuck around 'til the end. \n\nCheers, and happy showering!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "created_utc": 1649098898.0, "score": 193, "author": "None", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Shower orange review", "selftext": "First shower orange experience today. It was kind of an afterthought, I peeled my orange and decided to try the fabled shower orange. Set the scene with lights off, fan on, some chill tunes and a hot shower. It's the afternoon here and I felt like I needed a reset to finish the rest of my day doing something productive.\n\nOrange itself: navel orange, softball sized. I hate the little inverted orange butt chunk these have at one end, I will choose a different variety next time. However, orange was chilled to 38\u00b0 F before hand so the extra cold juice added an interesting sensory experience. Also a very good orange flavor wise. 8/10\n\nEmotions while shower orange: At first I was pretty relaxed but soon felt somewhat overwhelmed with all the sounds. Will go without music next time. Again, the other senses (taste/smell, touch, sight) were pretty satisfied by the citrus juices, hot water, and low light. I normally eat oranges slowly wedge by wedge as I find repetitive tasks to be meditative. I ate the orange way too fast and could have savored it more. It was a pleasantly feral feeling to be clutching my big ass orange and munching on it with my eyes closed. Primate vibes. 7/10\n\nEmotions post shower orange: I am glad that I peeled my orange first, I would not want to pick up those little white pieces afterwards. I feel energized yet relaxed, ready to work on some projects for the rest of the evening. 9/10\n\nOverall score: 8/10.

{"title": "Greetings, first Timer Here.", "selftext": "I just had my first shower orange. It was pretty good, but the experience was tainted by my choice of orange. It was way too ripe and sweet, right on the edge of fermentation, so next time I will get a nice Fresh and sour orange.\nSo I got in the shower with my orange and turned the water to 40\u00b0 C and got to the peeling. First there was the smell, the smell of the orange peel squirting it's aromatic oils in the air as I remove it, it smelled great. As I said the taste was not ideal but non the less good. The feeling of biting into an orange like it's an apple and having the juices run down your chin is very pleasant! I would also squish the orange peel from time to time to get the orange smell to fill the air while taking another bite. It felt like what I was doing wasn't just me eating an orange in a shower because some people on the internet said it was nice, it felt almost like a meditative exercise. Nothing but the taste, smell, feel of an orange and hot water running down your body while breathing in the moist heavy air. Very relaxing! Needless to say I will try this with a better orange and possibly with other fruits that create a huge mess, mango for example. I hope this was nice to read since English isn't my first language.

I\u2019m a firm believer in brushing teeth in the shower and back in my debate days, laminated notes were great for memorizing in suds, so when I stumbled upon the infamous shower orange, I was hooked. \n\nFirst thoughts! I\u2019m currently sitting in a towel and shampoo hair trying to write this all down. It was...\n\nLife.\n\nChanging.\n\nThe shower orange was something like never before. The juxtaposition of cold citrus to steamy water. The primitive bite into the orange, juice running down. No sticky mess. No clean up. (Other than the peel, of course.) The first bite into the orange, accompanied by the steamy shower, brings back something within. Like out ancestors. Bathing in water and eating fruit and just living it up. There\u2019s something so simple yet wonderful about the mundane act of a shower spiced by a plain and simple orange. 10/10. Quite appealing.\n\n(Shower notes for future reference and maximum enjoyment): \n\nREFRIGERATE the oranges! Cold = best. \n\nHot shower. Steamy. \n\nLastly. The mindset. I saw some posts previous to my endeavor saying that \u201cthis is crap, a bunch of horse shit, blah blah just an orange in a shower.\u201d \n\nIt is what you make of it. Embrace the orange.

I remember being scared to death, and had cold water running down on my on all sides which cause me to have a panic attack. I\u2019d never been that scared in my life.\nEver since then, every time I took a shower I would get horrible panic attacks. I\u2019d imagine myself stuck in a tiny tube, water gushing all around me, and no way for me to escape. I\u2019d have to shower with the curtain open and someone in the room next to me. I could never be directly in the water for more than a few seconds at a time.\nWell I discovered this sub, and never really tried eating oranges in the shower. I browsed the sub and thought it was funny but that was it. Well, after hearing everyone\u2019s testimonies I finally decided to give it a try.\nI was finally able to stay in the shower for more than a few seconds at a time, and I was able to partially close the curtain. I remembered on all of the comments saying just to relax and enjoy, and that\u2019s exactly what I did.\nI\u2019ve done it a few times and I can happily say I took my first shower with the curtain completely closed in over a year.

{"title": "The Cult Doctrine", "selftext": "I feel very strongly that this comment by @HugeHouseplant must be its own individual post. It deserves so many more upvotes. \n\nThe Ritual of the Shower Orange\n\nSetting the Scene\n\nBegin by preparing your shower space. Remove any distractions, ensuring the environment is calm and quiet. Allow the natural light, if any, to create a soft, diffused glow. Adjust the water to a hot, steamy temperature that envelops you like an ancient, welcoming embrace.\n\nPreparation\n\n1. \u2060Select the Orange: Choose a ripe, juicy orange. Feel its weight and texture, and appreciate the vibrant color that promises a burst of citrus delight.\n2. \u2060Prepare Yourself: Disrobe completely and step into the shower. Let the hot water flow over you, relaxing your muscles and clearing your mind. Take deep breaths, inhaling the steam and anticipating the forthcoming ritual.\n\nThe Ritual\n\n1. \u2060Initial Caress: Hold the orange in your hand, feeling its coolness against your hot, wet skin. Take a moment to connect with the fruit, appreciating its journey from a distant grove to your shower.\n2. \u2060Ripping the Peel: With deliberate, forceful movements, begin to rip the peel from the orange. Let the water cascade over your hands, washing away the peel and releasing the orange\u2019s fragrant oils. As you tear off each piece of the peel, throw it onto the shower floor. Watch as the pieces scatter, creating an almost mystical scene, their essence mingling with the steam to fill the air with a powerful, invigorating citrus aroma.\n3. Dividing the Segments: Gently separate the orange into individual segments. Feel the plump, juicy flesh beneath your fingers. Take a moment to admire the segments, appreciating their perfect, natural symmetry.\n4. The First Bite: Raise a segment to your lips and bite into it with gusto. Let the juice explode in your mouth, savoring the sweet, tangy flavor. Allow the excess juice to trickle down your chin, neck, and chest, mingling with the hot water. Feel the primal pleasure of eating with your hands, like an animal, connected to the raw, unfiltered experience of nourishing yourself.\n5. Continued Indulgence: Continue to eat the orange, segment by segment. With each bite, embrace the messiness, feeling the juice run freely down your body. Close your eyes and lose yourself in the sensory overload\u2014the taste, the texture, the sound of the shower, the heat of the water, and the feel of the juice on your skin.\n6. Embrace the Moment: As you finish the orange, take a moment to relish the culmination of the ritual. Feel the satisfaction of the fruit in your stomach, the lingering taste on your lips, and the refreshing cleanliness from the shower. Allow yourself to feel both primal and cleansed, connected to a simple yet profound act of nourishment and indulgence.\n\nCompletion\n\n1. Rinse and Reflect: Rinse off any remaining juice, feeling the hot water cleanse you. Reflect on the experience, how it made you feel, and the simple joy it brought.\n2. Clean Up: Carefully collect the orange peels from the shower floor and dispose of them properly. Exit the shower, feeling refreshed, invigorated, and deeply satisfied.\n\nPost-Ritual\n\nWrap yourself in a soft towel. Reflect on the joy of allowing yourself to experience something so elemental and satisfying, and carry that sense of indulgence and connection with you throughout your day. Feel the eldritch essence of the ritual, a timeless connection to the primal joy of nature\u2019s bounty.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/s/kuQYUq3Xp6", "created_utc": 1723000819.0, "score": 16, "author": "callmecrazyyy", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/1em1ip2/the_cult_doctrine/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "The ShowerOrange CULPRIT!!", "selftext": "My mom was getting frustrated because she kept finding orange shavings in the shower drain. At this time, my sister's boyfriend started staying with us, so she assumed it was him that was weirdly eating oranges in the shower. So, my mom goes to my sister and says \"hey, please tell your boyfriend to keep food out of the shower because it clogs up the drain\". Cut to my (at times hostile) sister being really weirded out and annoyed that my mother would assume something so bizarre of him. My mother kept asking my sister to tell him to stop for about a week and my sister would always just shrug her off because, well, why the hell would her boyfriend be eating oranges in the shower? After enough of this, my sister finally goes to her boyfriend and asks if he's doing it. He says no. Confusion strikes. How the hell are orange shavings getting in the drain? Cue my entire family being questioned about this (up until this point I had no idea this was going on because I guess nobody expected me to be the culprit) and the \"shower orange\" debate started up in my family. At one point we all sat down for breakfast and my sister mentions it passive aggressively because she was getting annoyed. After hearing her mention it, I go \"oh yeah it's a thing online, I've been doing it lately\". Without my anticipation, my entire family finds themselves in uproar. \"IT'S YOU. YOU'RE THE SHOWER ORANGE EATER. YOU'RE THE ONE CLOGGING UP THE DRAIN. WHY THE HELL ARE YOU EATING ORANGES IN THE SHOWER.\" I was shocked. I had no idea this was an issue.

{"title": "Icarian Relief", "selftext": "A few days ago, one of my friends told me that I \"simply had to try eating an orange in the shower.\" If this friend is to be believed, the experience approaches the divine; a conquest of pure sensory freedom. Thinking I had no reason to doubt this friend and eager for new experiences, I decided I must try.\n\n  \nSo today, I took myself over to the grocery store where I carefully and thoughtfully perused the citrus section. This was to be a formative moment, a memory for the grandchildren. It was essential I selected my tools well. I determined that clementines were too ordinary for the job. Yet I found that the thought of blood-orange was too dramatic. The Mandarins were too small, and the cara cara oranges felt too self important with their prominent display. For a moment I thought all was lost. I simply could not attempt such a feat ill equipped. Then I saw it. The most perfectly plump, juicely ripe morsel. It was obvious really. After all, I too would have mine exposed. \n\n  \nA navel orange was the only choice. \n\n  \nUpon arriving home I announced my intention to the husband who begrudgingly agreed to observe the ritual. I gathered the necessary supplies with eager anticipation: the orange, a shower chair, and a bowl for the peels of course, and stepped into the bathroom. I ran the water as hot as it would go and waited for the room to steam up.\n\n  \nFriends. Dear ones. I cannot lie. I peeled that orange with abandon. The juices evaporated into the steam of the shower adding a layer of fragrance that drove me to bliss, and then beyond. I became feral. I pounced upon my meal with the gusto of a cheetah to a gazelle, like a vulture to carrion, like some guy in a fedora to an IPA. I knew at once the taste of ichyr. I stared God in the face and knew he had made me, an animal, for this experience. It was a feast of transcendence.\n\n  \nAs I'm sure you've realized by now, this story is not a happy one. It was obvious, really, from the start. But I ask you  friends, should I really  have known better? Would you have? Could have evaded such tantalizing temptation? Or would you have known that simple truth: every story of triumph is merely the opening act of a tragedy? It was hubris of the worst kind. \n\n  \nAt one point, mid citric mastication, my hand slipped. The precious orange began to fall. I grabbed. And dear ones, I am ashamed to admit it...\n\n  \nI squeezed.\n\n  \nThere was a horrid second of a realization as I felt the meat resist and give way. It was followed by an even shorter instant of hope that physics and chance might conspire to my benefit this time. It was not to be. The juice shot directly into my eyes. \n\n  \nI've often heard it debated, those last thoughts of Icarus as he plummeted towards the sea, facing certain death. Was he consumed by fear? Was he regretful? Was he ecstatic? \n\n  \nFriends, as someone who has recently flown too close to the sun, I venture it was none of these. No, I know what Icarus felt in those last seconds just before he faced oblivion. It wasn't fear. It wasn't ecstasy. It was relief, relief in the knowledge that though he would live no more, he was freed from the burden of waking tomorrow knowing it was possible to fly. \n\n  \nIcarus was the lucky one.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/19e87rk/icarian_relief/", "created_utc": 1706069268.0, "score": 142, "author": "Abject-Ratio2346", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/19e87rk/icarian_relief/", "html_title": ""}

I always imagined having an \u201cahhhh finally mine\u201d moment when buying a house, and I think eating an Orange in the shower is what finally did it.\n\nnothing but my hands, teeth, the hot water and a fresh Florida orange. As I fumbled around with my perfect sphere I eventually just took a small bite to puncture the outer layer and started peeling back; I had envisioned getting all the skin off before I started eating it; and basking in the glory of it before inhaling like an apple. But something happened, something overcame me; once I had a clear passage to the core I started shredding it up. Probably 5-6 minutes or hard but satisfying labor later; I dry off and feel cleaner and more human than I ever have.

I laughed at everybody eating oranges in the shower, and mocked their very presence in this world. For months, I kept r/ShowerOrange in the back of my mind. For months, I rolled my eyes at these beautiful redditors.\n\nThen one day, I turned on the water to take a shower and felt the steam rise up my back. It surrounded me as I opened the curtain to test the water, but my hand quickly flinched back due to the heat. And something was missing. I didn\u2019t get my usual sense of comfort with the hot showers I took every night.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered something. Was it just a coincidence? Magic? A sign? Or was it just simply fate? Because I remembered I had an orange sitting in the back of my fridge. I left the bathroom, on a personal mission to see if it was still there. And I saw it. A beautiful, juicy, deeply perfect orange on the bottom shelf.\n\nSo I picked it up and took it into the bathroom. I was taken aback by my own decision. I couldn\u2019t believe I was really going to do it. I left it on the counter, second guessing myself. Thinking I was crazy. I hopped in the shower, missing something again. I stared at the luscious orange skin, calling me like temptation I\u2019d never experienced before. \n\nBefore I could stop myself or even realize what I had done, I was tearing into the orange with my teeth. I ripped it apart like a savage, untamable beast. The juice dripped down my chin like the blood from my fresh kill, which was swiftly washed away by the current of the shower. The peels fell to my orange-soaked feet, carelessly discarded with to get to the beautiful juice within. The fresh citrusy smell erupted into the air as I stared at what I had done. Both me and the orange. Naked. Vulnerable. Exposed. The way god intended it.\n\nIt was erotic. So erotic, I had to stop myself from reaching down to touch what had been stimulated my this experience. Because eating an orange in the shower isn\u2019t just something you do. It\u2019s an experience.

I got in the shower and I peeled and ate an orange. \n\nI felt so silly in there and I began to realize that maybe that\u2019s the point of it. I started peeling the orange and (after making sure nothing could fit down the drain) I just dropped the pieces wherever. I felt like a kid again. I wasn\u2019t thinking about work (or lack thereof for me), I wasn\u2019t thinking about laundry, all I could focus on was peeling this orange and taking a shower. \n\nIt smelled so good. I love it when the orange oils just fill up the air. The cold orange against the hot water was a delicious sensational pairing I was not expecting. \n\nAfter thinking about this experience (because I have to contemplate *everything*) I kinda realized something. Whenever you go into something with a certain set of expectations, you can often be blinded by the things unfolding right in front of you. I stopped looking for an amazing, transcendental experience and just learned to enjoy the orange.

{"title": "Discovering the Darkness Inside of Me", "selftext": "Last week I had the shower orange urge for the first time and I couldn\u2019t let go. The idea of someone taking an orange into the shower as a daily ritual shook something within me. Initially I was amused by the idea, but over the course of a few days and showers it grew into something more. Every shower I took I imagined how it would feel in the moment\u2026 what it would be like to be holding an orange\u2026 so smooth and soft and plump\u2026 warm soapy water dripping down my hair and back\u2026 how I\u2019d be so very fortunate to have this big ass.. . fucking massive, sweet, sticky, oozing, genetically modified orange in my hands. \n\nA primal urge began to awaken inside me. The last shower I took I was completely helpless to it, I took that innocent orange into the shower and cranked the water to the hottest it could possibly go. The bathroom slowly began to fill with steam completely and my skin was burning very badly\u2026. The poor orange was unrecognizable. i dont think i even got any of it into my stomach. i was on all fours just tearing it to shreds with my hands and teeth like a starving rabid animal. When i got out of the shower my roommate knocks on the door and says he heard growling sounds but i don\u2019t remember making those sounds - I say it must have been a dog in the hallway of our complex. Cleanup is a mess and i can\u2019t leave any evidence (the shower is shared). \n\nI feel oddly relaxed and as though my mind has been cleansed, however i am also unsettled by the unusually savage manner in which I behaved. The experience felt out-of-body almost psychedelic, like i was on the cusp of secret knowledge. I think i will continue to follow this path and see where it takes me. \n\n* i would like to thank this sub for showing me the truth god bless *", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/wr1c9y/discovering_the_darkness_inside_of_me/", "created_utc": 1660773274.0, "score": 128, "author": "StickySalamander", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/wr1c9y/discovering_the_darkness_inside_of_me/", "html_title": ""}

It starts out dark, and it stays dark for a while. Dont read if you're triggered by mentions of alcoholism or other mental illnesses. Im sorry. \n\n(This is a throwaway for a reason. If you recognize my writing style, don't mention it. Please.) \n--------- \n\nRough. Rough days, nay, weeks and months. Endless cycle, at least as far as I can see. Can I break it? It would mean breaking myself. Shatter my inner form into millions of pieces, pick out whats salvagable, leave behind whats tainted. Be left with a pile of shards too sharp to touch and reassemble. Wait til a gloved hand comes along to gently put me back together. But how long? How long to sit and wait, the Whole of Me in splinters? Too long. \n\nIts a slow process, recovery. Especially with no help. Especially when you dont even know what you're recovering from, exactly. Vague pictures of friends turned enemies. An inexplicable terror when confronted with loud, sudden noises. A self esteem so low and deep that the Mariana Trench grows jealous. \n\nNot every day is this bad, thank fuck. I would've been dead a long time ago. I have friends again, and I enjoy every second I spend with them. I have, somehow, made it into university (though this is now a huge part of my struggles as well. Uni work is hard, and harder when you dont have the strength to stay sober). \nToday, I saw the rain, and I went outside to walk in it for the better part of two hours. I saw a snail, and I watched it glide along the wet leafs. It was beautiful, a perfect escape. \n\nOpening the door to my apartment shut it all down. Confronted with piles and piles of paper, work to be done, no rest in sight, at least not without taking shortcuts. It crushes you. After a while, waking up to a new day is dreadful. More work. No sleep. And oh, the guilt. The GUILT that smothers you for not doing what is expected. I barely keep up with my classes, but even thats a lie. I dont. I dont. I do the bare minimum for no one to catch on. I spend my days in a numb stasis. Unable to complete the work, the work that keeps piling and piling, no end in sight, courses followed by exams followed by the next semester, no end, no end. \n\nCould you bear it? Are you struggling, too? Are we alone, together?\u00a0 \nI never knew how people became alcoholics. Everyone knows about the dangers. You try it maybe once or twice. Day-drinking, I mean. Hopefully with friends. If you're not there yet, then don't even think about starting. Never, I repeat, Never take to the bottle when you're alone. You won't realise it's a habit until it's too late. \nI could still stop. I think. \nIt's not every day. It's not that much. But oh, how enchanting it is, opening the fridge and seeing the bottle, thinking: 'One sip won't hurt', until it turns into two and three and four and- \n\nComing home today was rough. I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't so cold from the rain that had long since penetrated my clothes and gotten to my skin. I hadn't taken a jacket with me. \nA perfect time, a perfect situation for a shower. \nAnd as with every shower these days, I went for the fridge, and reached for the bottle. Not open yet. I had emptied the last one a day earlier. \nI was about to close the door and resume with my harmful routine, when something caught my eye. \nAn orange. A singular, ripe orange I had picked up from the store earlier this week. I stared. I fought with myself. I picked it up, and put the bottle away. For another day. \n\nIt's been a while since my last time. Two months, maybe? I got caught up in... everything. The thought only crossed my mind occasionally, but I was always too tired to endulge in it. Walk past the fruit stand, grab my weekly groceries and leave. No thoughts spared on some citrussy endeavour. \n\nGetting into the shower was... almost ceremonial. I sat down. I always sit. Standing takes too much energy. I sat, letting the hot water almost burn my skin, until I forgot the world around me, and myself too. This time, I was cradling a citrus fruit, for the first time in a long time. My fingers were digging into the skin. I wanted to rip and tear. I wanted to destroy. But I was too tired. \nI opened the peel slowly. With care and precision, instead of hunger and beast-like urgency. \nEvery bite was enjoyed slowly. The drops of cold juice presented a stark contrast to the steaming water, but I got used to them hitting my stomach in semi regular intervals. \nI had my eyes closed. It was peaceful. \nIn the end, I cradled the empty peel. It would have been a good moment to cry, had it been a movie. But I just sat in silence. \nTurned off the water, disposed of the waste. Sat down and wrote this post. \n\nIt's been over an hour.\nI still want to drink. Every time I look to my left, I see the open book that I abandoned hours ago, waiting for me to come back. Keep studying. It's not even hard. I just can't bring myself to do it. It's always been this way. Doing things, no matter what, is the most difficult hurdle in my life. \n\nBut there's one thing I can do. Start buying more oranges, and start endulging in the beauty of it all again. Every sip traded for a bite is a good thing. Every shower I can finish without going for the bottle is a win. \n\n- \n\nI've written multiple shower oranging manifestos. Some public, some only for myself. This one will be posted, albeit with no ties to my main account. I need to share my thoughts with someone, and I believe that this community will not judge me. And maybe, just maybe, one person who reads this will be able to relate, and feel a little less alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "created_utc": 1654706446.0, "score": 170, "author": "ThrThrThrorange", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/v7txoe/went_for_the_bottle_took_the_orange_instead/", "html_title": ""}

Also to set it in because if it touched any shower stuff I wouldn\u2019t eat it. It was fresh out of the fridge, which was great for eating but bad for peeling. Made my fingertips hurt - I\u2019d forgotten how much of a pain in the ass peeling oranges can be. I also did it before actually getting in, which probably wasn\u2019t following protocol. Whatever. I don\u2019t have enough hot water for that.\n\nGot in. Started eating orange by just biting right in, which seemed like the right technique. Shower smelled great instantly. I forgot that eating it like that would hurt though (I have a lip piercing that pinches when I eat stuff like apples and large burgers) so I switched to wedges halfway through. Bummer. Not worrying about the mess was real nice, and there was something cathartic about the cold juice running down my neck and arms in the hot water, but i was still annoyed by all the pith. Fuck pith.\n\nI will say, while eating my orange, I didn\u2019t curl my toes. I didn\u2019t for the rest of my shower either. So it sort of worked.

{"title": "My Recipe to Success: A Suggestion for Newcomers", "selftext": "Hello everyone! Anyone else always get the urge to make a post on here after they've had a shower orange? I sure do, and this one is for anyone who:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Tried shower orange, but didnt get much from it \n\n2) Hasnt tried it and is looking for pointers\n\n3) Is simply looking for new ways to step up their shower oranging game\n\nand anyone else who might find this post helpful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, this recipe includes lots of optional components, and you can obviously mix and match however you want. Let it be noted that the full experience includes, of course, everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMandatory ingredients: \n\n\\>Orange (or any other citrus fruit, though I do not recommend lemons for beginners)\n\n\\>Shower (or bath)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOptional (but highly recommended) ingredients:\n\n\\>Fridge \n\n\\>Waterproof bluetooth headphones + your favourite music \n\n\\>Dark bathroom\n\n\\>The ability to put yourself into the mind of a predator mercilessly ripping into its prey\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how I do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter completing my grocery haul, I give my orange a good wash before putting it in the fridge overnight. If you take anything from this post, let it be the chillage of your citrus. Im 100% serious when I say that this can make or break the experience. \n\nI usually shower in the evenings, but just do it whenever it feels right. Maybe you open your fridge and see the fruit calling out to you in the morning, and if you have the time, do not feel bad about giving in to the call. However, this will make it a little harder to truly darken your bathroom. \n\nI dont have any windows in mine, so the process is very easy for me. I close the door and shove some old clothes in the bottom gap. Yes, I shower in complete darkness. It is exhilerating. Be careful, it might take you some time to get truly familiar with the layout of your bathroom in the dark. Make use of your hands, smashing your nose into a wall may dampen the experience. \n\nI already have my headphones on at this point. I have a playlist specifically constructed for showering, but sometimes I just let all my saved songs play on shuffle. Any unwanted songs are simply skipped, and the immersion doesnt get ruined, even if you dont catch an out-of-place tune immediately. And even so, getting back into the zone is something that happens completely on its own. \n\nLets recap. I am standing in complete and utter darkness, music is playing, the orange is either being held by me or resting inside the shower. Dont worry, it wont warm up that quickly. Take your time. Have I mentioned that this process will make your showering a lot more time consuming and water-wasting? Yeah... maybe keep an eye on your water bill. \n\nThe prep is done. It is time. Get in the shower. Now, I know some people like their cold showers, you do you, but I \\*highly\\* recommend choosing hot water here. Trust me. This isnt a \"get clean quickly before work\" kind of thing, its an experience. \n\nI often sit down because its even more relaxing, but standing can also help to get you into the predator mindset. Yeah, I wasnt joking, for me this part is just as important as fridging the fruit.\n\nWhen you step into that shower, thats your cue to unleash yourself. You are an animal! This is your chance to act like one! Screw any tools, you only need your teeth and hands here. Take a big bite, spit it out, take another one. Rip the thing apart with your teeth and hands, bury your face in the flesh, scarf it down like its the last thing you'll ever eat! Take the pieces into both hands and take alternating bites. No one can see you! You are free! Completely and utterly let yourself go. The more juice you get on yourself, the better. Fuck it, rub the thing over your body like its a goddamn exfoliator, and then continue eating, because whos gonna stop you? God? The government? The orange is Pompeii, and you, my friend, are Vesuvio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe carnage will end at one point. You will be covered in sweet nectar, bits of orange in your teeth, theres pieces of peel on the ground. Let the hot water wash over you, let it carry your sins down the drain. Theres music playing. You might have forgotten about it during your feast. Now, its your tether. You can start cleaning yourself up now, or remain in this in-between state just a little bit longer. You deserve it. \n\nHow you finish your shower is up to you. Turning the water off is always hard, but of course necessary. I like to clean the peel up as soon as Im done and dressed, otherwise it can get stuck on the floor, but if youre willing to risk it for the sweet orange smell, youre welcome to leave it. (Careful, the smell can turn sour relatively quickly.)\n\nFor me, shower oranging is not something I do every time. I want to keep it a little bit special, for bad days, or just for days where Im really in the mood for a good citrus treatment. Its also, as you may have noticed, pretty time- and water-consuming. Dont feel bad about it though! You deserve nice things, one long shower every on\u00b4ce in a while will kill neither you, nor the planet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhoever may be reading this: I hope you enjoyed this post. Whether you decide to try out my advice, or simply appreciate my writing, Im glad you stuck around 'til the end. \n\nCheers, and happy showering!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "created_utc": 1649098898.0, "score": 192, "author": "None", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/ShowerOrange/comments/twa135/my_recipe_to_success_a_suggestion_for_newcomers/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Shower orange review", "selftext": "First shower orange experience today. It was kind of an afterthought, I peeled my orange and decided to try the fabled shower orange. Set the scene with lights off, fan on, some chill tunes and a hot shower. It's the afternoon here and I felt like I needed a reset to finish the rest of my day doing something productive.\n\nOrange itself: navel orange, softball sized. I hate the little inverted orange butt chunk these have at one end, I will choose a different variety next time. However, orange was chilled to 38\u00b0 F before hand so the extra cold juice added an interesting sensory experience. Also a very good orange flavor wise. 8/10\n\nEmotions while shower orange: At first I was pretty relaxed but soon felt somewhat overwhelmed with all the sounds. Will go without music next time. Again, the other senses (taste/smell, touch, sight) were pretty satisfied by the citrus juices, hot water, and low light. I normally eat oranges slowly wedge by wedge as I find repetitive tasks to be meditative. I ate the orange way too fast and could have savored it more. It was a pleasantly feral feeling to be clutching my big ass orange and munching on it with my eyes closed. Primate vibes. 7/10\n\nEmotions post shower orange: I am glad that I peeled my orange first, I would not want to pick up those little white pieces afterwards. I feel energized yet relaxed, ready to work on some projects for the rest of the evening. 9/10\n\nOverall score: 8/10.

{"title": "Greetings, first Timer Here.", "selftext": "I just had my first shower orange. It was pretty good, but the experience was tainted by my choice of orange. It was way too ripe and sweet, right on the edge of fermentation, so next time I will get a nice Fresh and sour orange.\nSo I got in the shower with my orange and turned the water to 40\u00b0 C and got to the peeling. First there was the smell, the smell of the orange peel squirting it's aromatic oils in the air as I remove it, it smelled great. As I said the taste was not ideal but non the less good. The feeling of biting into an orange like it's an apple and having the juices run down your chin is very pleasant! I would also squish the orange peel from time to time to get the orange smell to fill the air while taking another bite. It felt like what I was doing wasn't just me eating an orange in a shower because some people on the internet said it was nice, it felt almost like a meditative exercise. Nothing but the taste, smell, feel of an orange and hot water running down your body while breathing in the moist heavy air. Very relaxing! Needless to say I will try this with a better orange and possibly with other fruits that create a huge mess, mango for example. I hope this was nice to read since English isn't my first language.

I\u2019m a firm believer in brushing teeth in the shower and back in my debate days, laminated notes were great for memorizing in suds, so when I stumbled upon the infamous shower orange, I was hooked. \n\nFirst thoughts! I\u2019m currently sitting in a towel and shampoo hair trying to write this all down. It was...\n\nLife.\n\nChanging.\n\nThe shower orange was something like never before. The juxtaposition of cold citrus to steamy water. The primitive bite into the orange, juice running down. No sticky mess. No clean up. (Other than the peel, of course.) The first bite into the orange, accompanied by the steamy shower, brings back something within. Like out ancestors. Bathing in water and eating fruit and just living it up. There\u2019s something so simple yet wonderful about the mundane act of a shower spiced by a plain and simple orange. 10/10. Quite appealing.\n\n(Shower notes for future reference and maximum enjoyment): \n\nREFRIGERATE the oranges! Cold = best. \n\nHot shower. Steamy. \n\nLastly. The mindset. I saw some posts previous to my endeavor saying that \u201cthis is crap, a bunch of horse shit, blah blah just an orange in a shower.\u201d \n\nIt is what you make of it. Embrace the orange. Embrace the capybara bathing within. \n\nThanks! Cheers to more adventures!
