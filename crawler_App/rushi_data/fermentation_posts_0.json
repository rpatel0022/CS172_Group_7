I seasoned the brine, which is my favorite thing to do with fermentation, especially for potatoes because they need a lot of seasoning. The flavors distributed nicely throughout the potato. It was fermented until completion(33 days), which made the tart flavor too rich for some people, but I really liked it.  \n  \nIngredients:  \n\u25cf3# potatoes  \n\u25cf4 oz garlic  \n\u25cf12 oz white onion  \n\u25cf2 quarts water  \n\u25cf3 oz pickling salt  \n\u25cf1 Tbsp black peppercorns  \n\u25cf2 Tbsp dried epazote  \n\u25cf.31 oz rosemary sprigs  \n\u25cf1 Tbsp dried thyme  \n  \nThe pepper and herbs were put in a tiny brew bag with marbles so they sank to the bottom.

{"title": "Hot Sauce Update Update", "selftext": "So here\u2019s the final-ish update on that 2 kg of peppers I fermented a few weeks back. \n\nI decided to clear out my freezer and my brother gave me peppers and I picked a bunch from my yard. I put them all together with a little over 2% salt by weight and vacuum bagged them. It was an eclectic mix of peppers: bells, jalape\u00f1os, fresnos, cayennes, serranos, habaneros, anaheims, whatever was around. \n\nAfter fermenting for a few days, it inflated to the point of needing urgent venting. To my surprise, it fully inflated again, needing venting. Then it inflated again! If you look you can see that the last one isn\u2019t very fully inflated. At this point I needed some time to process. \n\nYesterday I had that time. I also opened two other bags sitting on the counter for a couple months. The cayennes were fairly recent but my habanero bag was pretty old. It had really broken down the cells and was very liquid. And pretty funky. At first I thought it had gone bad, but then I realized it was funk. A bit much for me, but I blended it in anyway. \n\nFor blending, I did that in batches and still over filled my 8-cup measuring cup. \n\nI then strained it all through a sieve with a spoon and mixed it up to blend the flavors. I added about 1.5 tsp of Xanthan gum (bag said I should use 3 tsp for that volume if I was making salad dressing) to keep the liquids separating from the solids. \n\nAfter bottling, I ran out of time for the pulp. So today I added three limes worth of juice to make my own Tajin, and then spread it on the dehydrator on pieces of parchment paper to dry.

{"title": "Making Slivovitz on the Balkans: The First Step - Fermentation", "selftext": "Hello everyone! \nI wanted to share with you the process my family and I use to make slivovitz, a traditional alcoholic drink here on the Balkans.\n\nWe typically gather around 500 kilograms of plums, though some families in the area harvest over 2,000-3,000 kilograms! We\u2019ve just finished picking the ripe plums, and we\u2019ve carefully crushed them and placed them in a large vat, where they\u2019ll stay for the next few weeks to ferment. This stage is crucial, as the natural sugars in the plums will start converting into alcohol.\n\nOnce the fermentation process is complete, we\u2019ll move on to distillation. Distillation is where the magic happens\u2014it\u2019s the process that concentrates the alcohol content. The fermented plum mash, called \"mash\" or \"must,\" is heated in a copper still, which we also affectionately call the \"veseli stroj\" (the \"merry machine\"). As it heats up, the alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature than water. These alcohol vapors are then collected and condensed back into liquid form through a cooling coil.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail on the distillation process:\n\n**Prvenac** - This is the first distillate that comes out of the still. It contains high levels of volatile compounds and is of poor quality, so it needs to be discarded. Generally, for every 100 liters of mash in the still, the first 2-5 dcl that comes out is known as \"prvenac.\" Some people save it and use it in the next distillation, but our advice is: \"What wasn't good the first time, won't be good the second time either!\"\n\n**Srce rakije (meka rakija)** - This is what we\u2019re looking for! The highest quality rakija distillate comes right in the middle, and it contains all the desired aromas and flavors. After discarding the \"prvenac,\" we allow the \"srce\" to flow into a container and adjust it to the desired alcohol level (measured in \"gradi\"). \nThe rakija that comes out every 5-10 minutes will have a lower alcohol content as the process continues. We measure the alcohol level about every 20 minutes, and once we reach the desired strength, we set it aside and move on to the final distillate, known as \"patoka.\" The best quality rakija is typically in the range of 25-35 gradi, but this is up to you.\n\n**Patoka**, like \"prvenac,\" is not the best quality rakija and is generally best discarded and not used.\n\nThe quality and strength of the slivovitz depend on careful control of the temperature during distillation. Our final product can range from 25% to 50% alcohol, but someone makes it even higher, depending on the process and the specific characteristics of the plums and the mash.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re in the fermentation stage, waiting for the process to finish. If you\u2019re interested in how this continues, drop a comment below, and I\u2019ll keep you updated on the distillation and the final results!\n\nThanks for your support, and I\u2019m excited to share this traditional process with you all!\n", "url": "https://v.redd.it/rgx75sri4vkd1", "created_utc": 1724614583.0, "score": 408, "author": "endless_seeker_42", "num_comments": 66, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1f14tc9/making_slivovitz_on_the_balkans_the_first_step/", "html_title": ""}

We gladly provide guidance to additional resources to help improve your ferments, so be sure to use all resources at your disposal.\n\nFor those that have been here or are joining the sub as those seasoned in the world of fermentation, we'd like to remind you of Rule #3: Don't Be Rotten. If a newcomer asks a question that's already been answered or doesn't provide enough information for their question, this does not mean that it's an appropriate time to belittle those with less knowledge than you. There's nice ways to ask for clarifying information or give corrected information, and any unnecessary aggression or condescension will not be tolerated. Additionally, racism, sexism, or any other sort of discrimination or shaming is not acceptable. No matter how experienced you may be, the community does not need a bad attitude souring everything for the rest of us, and multiple infractions ***will*** result in a permanent ban.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/bu21qk/reminder_of_the_rules/", "created_utc": 1559060708.0, "score": 348, "author": "None", "num_comments": 60, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/bu21qk/reminder_of_the_rules/", "html_title": ""}

Today I\u2019m breaking it down, step by step!  \n\nHere\u2019s the journey of a vanilla bean, how it goes from green to brown:\n\n1. The Hot Bath\nFreshly harvested green vanilla beans are carefully placed in hot water for 60-120 seconds (depending on their size). This step is crucial\u2014it\u2019s where the magic begins.  \n\n 2-3. The Fermentation\nAfter their hot bath, the beans are quickly wrapped in bags to trap the heat. These bags are then stacked and tucked into a wooden case, wrapped in blankets like a cozy cocoon. The goal? To keep them warm and cozy for 48 hours.  \n\n4. Post fermentation\nAfter two days of resting in their warm little nest, the beans emerge\u2026 brown! L The heat breaks down the cells inside the pod, allowing enzymes to mix and work their magic. Glucovanillin transforms into vanillin, the compound responsible for that heavenly vanilla aroma we all crave.  \n\nWe work directly with farmers, hand-selecting the best green beans and curing them to perfection. The result? A product that\u2019s as pure and authentic as it gets.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about the process drop your questions below - I\u2019d love to chat about which part of the process fascinates you most!  \n\nAnd if you would like to try the beans we cure let me know!

There's nice ways to ask for clarifying information or give corrected information, and any unnecessary aggression or condescension will not be tolerated.

{"title": "Any advice to achieve different EFFECTS in the spicyness of a fermented sauce? (Slighly long post)", "selftext": "TL;DR: \n\nAny tip on how to achieve some modifications of the effects on the table below, with ingredients like Raw chillies in your previously fermented mash to increase the Heat Level, adding fats to delay the Burn Speed or to make it lingers (increase Burn duration). Etc.\n\nLong version:\n\nI hope this post makes any sense to the community, I know most of us have some experience as an amateur or in some cases professional fermenters, so I was wondering if anyone has recommendations about how to achieve different effects in fermented spicy sauce recipes (tips for non-fermented versions or variations are welcome!). \n\nAllow me to explain, in the particular case of spicy sauce we all know that the spicy sauce's organoleptic characteristics might vary according to the ingredients the recipe includes or the process used. Sadly I have seen many posts being a little vague in the way they describe their final product and if you have ever checked the /hotsauce community you will notice the same issue. Also, spicy sauce naming conventions do not help since almost every sauce is related to well-common tropes like \"hell XYZ\", \"bu\\*\\*hole destroyer 3000\", \"the last xxx\", \"the bomb\", \"nuclear xyz\", and the likes or even some eye rolling names such as \"Sauce wars: The Curry awakens\".\n\nAnyway, rant over. While I know the Scoville scale exists and many products put some kind of \"meter\" to the heat level, this does not reflect on other characteristics that the sauce might have like \"lingering effect\", \"sensation\", \"mouthfeel\" and the likes. Therefore, I brainstormed the next table describing in more detail some other aspects I have found in some sauces:\n\n|Characteristic|What It Means|Example|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Heat Level (HL)**|How spicy it is. (The most basic metric)|Jalape\u00f1o (mild), Habanero (hot)|\n|**Burn Speed (BS)**|How fast the heat hits. (Some hit you as soon as they hit your mouth)|Wasabi (fast), Ghost Pepper (slow)|\n|**Burn Duration (BD)**|How long the burn lasts. (Some hit like a truck but dissipate very fast while others linger for a very very long time)|Jalape\u00f1o (short), Habanero (long)|\n|**Stacking Effect (SE)**|Gets hotter with each bite. (Heat stacks, might start mild but it might stack to barely tolerable levels)|Sichuan oil, Korean gochujang|\n|**Mouth Feel (MF)**|Type of sensation. (Usually non capsaicin ingredients might give a spicy sauce some extra feel, particularly in the lips, or nostrils)|Numbing (Sichuan), Sharp (Mustard), Sinus clearing (Raw garlic)|\n|**Burn Location (BL)**|Where you feel it. (Might be personal but, some really make my lips burn but leave my tonge okayish?)|Tip of tongue, throat, lips|\n|**Addictive Quality (AQ)**|Makes you want more despite the burn. (There is an \"Addictive\" quality that some sauces have that even when you can barely tolerate them you want, no you NEED to keep eating it in that moment)|Samyang noodles, spicy chips, some snack \"sauces\"|\n|**Flavor Match (FM)**|How well does heat blend with the taste. (Commonly some fruity sauces can be paired really well with desserts but rarely you will pair a garlic forward sauce with your vanilla ice cream)|Thai chilli (balanced, pair well with almost all), Raw green chilli (harsh, vegetable flavour, better for sour or light savory dishes like fish)|\n\nParticularly I am looking for something to increase the AQ and the SE of my fermented mash.

I start on my ginger tea, handwashing everything I am about to use with dish soap/warm water and a good rinse, boiling 9 cups of tap water for 20 minutes in case of chlorine, then reducing to a simmer and adding my 1cup, 6Tbsp of granulated sugar and 1/4 cup of shredded organic ginger, simmer for 7 minutes, heat off, separate into two containers to cool faster, waited until both were room temp (\\~60f) and recombined my teas and strained my tea into another container. I stirred, strained out a little over 1/2 cup of ginger bug out, and then combined with my tea, funneling into 3 16oz fliptop bottles with at least 2 inches of headroom for each left out on the counter. Each bottle isn't bubbling after 2 days.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1k42yya/requesting_advice_for_ginger_beer_ferment/", "created_utc": 1745202607.0, "score": 1, "author": "goose716", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1k42yya/requesting_advice_for_ginger_beer_ferment/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

My family never made it tho so I have no secret recipe. I've usually bought the zakwas pasteurized or home made from a shop.\n\nBut this Easter I chose to finally make my own zakwas. In looking up recipes and in cookbooks I own, the ratio of flour to water varies WIDELY, to the point I've never seen an identical recipe. Other variations are spices/no spices and stirring/no stirring. \n\nI settled on 1/2 cup flour to 500ml of water, but I've seen recipes that more than double this quantity for the same amount of water, but also half the amount for twice the amount of water. I also settled on no spices or garlic since it's my first zakwas. I'm using a cheesecloth, and keeping it close-ish to the radiator because I tend to keep a cold ish house at this time of the year and I'm cutting it super close.\n\nI haven't been stirring because that appears to be the standard, but I'm on day 3 and I went from no activity to a thick foamy layer this morning so I stirred it back in so it could settle and prevent mold formation. It definitely has a *smell* that's mildly unpleasant but I tasted and it's close to what I expect and obviously it's not done fermenting.\n\nAnyways, just looking for some clarity on why ratios and instructions vary so widely for zakwas. Anyone with some expert knowledge could help me understand whether more water would make it more or less sour, how much of the flour itself people normally find palatable for the soup, etc. I would say I have significantly more flour as is compared to zakwas I've bought, but then again I do get disappointed sometimes when a batch I've bought is not sour enough.\n\nWeso\u0142ych \u015awi\u0105t", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1k2g91z/question_about_zakwas_na_\u017curek/", "created_utc": 1745011955.0, "score": 1, "author": "mencryforme5", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1k2g91z/question_about_zakwas_na_\u017curek/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Beautiful Butterfly Pea Tea Soda", "selftext": "As far as the fizz goes these drinks have more hit to the throat than store brands. And it is all without chemicals, artificial ingredients/sweeteners and colors. Three ingredients for the base that makes the fizz: organic unpeeled ginger, bottled spring water and organic sugar. The tea or liquid you choose for flavor is endless. Above, that is Butterfly Pea tea, an organic tea that is naturally blue and used for coloring other foods.\n\nAdding lemon will turn the tea purple.\n\n\nThe nutritive properties of the tea are:\n(http://rawandlovely.blogspot.com/2014/02/health-benefits-of-butterfly-pea-tea.html)\n*  Strengthens the hair for healthy hair growth\n*  Prevents skin bruising\n*  Keeps skin glowing & healthy\n*  Treats urinary problems\n*  Improves eyesight & night vision\n*  Treats eye infections\n*  Stimulates blood circulation\n*  Detoxifies the whole body\n*  Provides antioxidants\n*  Slows aging process\n*  Enhances immune system \n\nAnd:\n(http://www.wildturmeric.net/2015/12/blue-butterfly-pea-tea-recipe-health-benefits-medicinal-uses.html)\n1. Butterfly pea tea is full of antioxidants and has been proven through clinical research. You can find the link to the study.\n2. Butterfly pea tea has been proven to have anti glycation properties. Glycation is damage caused to protein because of sugar molecules and it is one of the main causes of skin aging. Butterfly pea tea prevents this damage and helps prevent premature aging of our skin. You can find the link to the study.\n3. Butterfly pea tea has been shown to have anti inflammatory properties. \n4. Butterfly pea tea is very good for people suffering from chronic fatigue as it improves vitality. \n5. The tea has been proven to have analgesic properties (pain relieving properties). You can find the link to the study proving it's analgesic and anti inflammatory properties. \n\nAnd the taste is smooth and subtle... until you make it into a ginger ale. Then the fizz will refresh you and take you back for more. \n\nYou should know this drink is probiotic. That's a great thing.\n\n\nThe recipe for the ginger bug. You have to have this in order to turn the tea into soda...\n1 hand of fresh organic ginger (just get a piece the size of your hand and you will have enough)\n6 tablespoons Organic sugar\n1 cup bottled spring water (if your city uses chloramine in its water then bottled water is essential. You cannot boil the chemical out and need to purchase a special filter to get rid of it. It is not the same chemical as chlorine.)\n1 tablespoon organic white or apple cider vinegar\nSpring water for rinsing\n\nUsing a jar with screw on lid, add the vinegar and some bottled water. About 1/4 cup total. Put lid on jar and swirl liquid around to coat the entire inside. Pour out solution then rinse with some more water. The reason for this is to remove any residue that may inhibit growth of the yeast needed to produce your carbonation (fizz). The yeast grows from the unpeeled ginger and the sugar. The vinegar promotes the process. It is important to use organic unpeeled ginger. Regular ginger has been irradiated and that will prevent the yeast from forming and you are trying to not use chemical or processed ingredients in this healthy drink.\n\nGrate ginger to get 3 tablespoons. Add to the clean jar.\nAdd the 3 tablespoons of sugar.\nAdd the 1 cup of water.\nEither stir or shake to mix.\nSet bug aside for 24 hours.\nOn the second day, add another tablespoon of ginger and another tablespoon of sugar.\nRepeat for two more days.\nOn the third day your bug is ready to use.\n\nWhile your bug is fermenting decide which flavor you want. You can just use lemon, more spring water and more sugar if you just want plain. But this post is about the Butterfly Pea tea...\n\n\nApproximately 56 ounces spring bottled water\n1/2 cup dried Butterfly Pea tea flowers\nat least 1/2 cup organic cane sugar\nYou can either add or not add the juice and rind of a whole fresh lemon. The lemon will turn the tea a yummy looking purple. (see photos).\n1/2 gallon (64 0z) canning jar with screw on lid or regular ring/lid combo.\n\n\nIn a stainless steel pot, add 2 cups of spring water. Bring to a boil. Add the tea flowers. Let steep until mixture is cool.\n\nRinse jar with the vinegar/water solution as you did with the bug. Be sure to do a second rinse with plain bottled water.\nAdd 1 cup of ginger bug\nAdd the cooled Butterfly Pea tea\nIf you are using the lemon add it now...\nAdd the 1/2 cup sugar. (at this point you may want to add up to another 1/2 of cup because the yeast will eat most of the sugar and the drink will be very tart)\nAdd enough water to fill the jar to within 1 inch. \nMix well until sugar has dissolved.\nScrew on lid.\nPlace jar out of direct sunlight but not in the refrigerator. The location should be warm at least 70 degrees.\nAllow to ferment for three days.\nStir or shake drink to mix up the yeast that has settled to the bottom and then strain mixture into a container like a large mixing cup.\nPour into individual swing top bottles like the one pictured below or acquire Groslch beer bottles. Both are made to withstand the pressure of carbonated drinks.\nAfter bottling chill in refrigerator and leave there until ready to drink.\n\nAt this point you should know that this process creates a lot of carbonation. When you open a bottle it may blow the bale either back or off the bottle. To keep from losing your drink place the bottle in a bowl before opening. In that way you will catch what shoots out. You will probably try to catch what shoots out by trying to drink it.

I've been reading about some of the anti-cancer stuff surrounding broccoli sprouts, and I know you're supposed to eat them raw for the enzymes but I also remember reading that young sprouts are basically at peak protective anti-nutrient production, so I was wondering if adding them into a kraut or something would be of any use. Does it work? \n\nI'm completely new to this and I know I need to just jump in but I'm afraid of wasting anything, especially since I don't have a compost pile or anything. I'd welcome any suggestions or insight.

Put all of the ingredients in a glass container, stir the mixture and leave it in a cold place or a fridge.\n\n2. Shake the moto yeast starter once a day for 10 days. The finished moto looks like a cream-soup.\n\nInstruction: Sake (14-32 days process)\n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 1\n\n1. Cook rice for 1 cup (380 g. steamed rice = 1 cup 200 g. uncooked sushi rice), cool it to room temperature.  Then put in a big glass container. This way you\u2019ll be able to oversee the whole process. Coat inside with cooking wine before use. \n\n2. Add 500 ml of water\n\n3. Add the moto yeast starter \n\n4. Add a cup of Koji rice (160 g)\n\n5. Mix well, leave at the cold place, stir the mixture every 10-12 hours \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 3\n\n1. Add another 760 g. of the steamed rice (2 cups, 400 g. uncooked sushi rice.)\n\n2. Add another 1 cup of Koji rice (160 g.)\n\n3. 1.5 liters of water (6 cups) \n\n4. Mix well, leave at the cold place, stir the mixture every 10-12 hours \n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 5\n\n1. Add the remaining 1,140g steamed rice (3 cups uncooked sushi rice).\n\n2. Add Koji rice 380 g.\n\n3. Add 2 liters of water, stir and leave in a cold place for 2-3 weeks depend how strong of alcohol you prefer.\n\n4. You will have to stir every 10-12 hours, to keeping the fermentation in balance. \n\n5. Strain it through a cheesecloth and bottle.

For context this isn't my first time ever fermenting, I have a tiny amount of experience, but brine fermented veggies is new to me.\n\nSo I followed the basics, did a 2.0-2.5 brine, let is do its thing for a few weeks. Upon initial inspection, it looked fine, no mold, no nothing. even no signs of kham yeast (which i know is safe).\n\nSmell test pass, smelled like brussel sprouts so kinda farty but nothing bad.\n\nThen came the taste test. I ate a full half, it was tarty and tangy, exactly what i was looking for.\n\nThen about 5 mins later, i felt odd, almost like an allergic reaction. My lymph nodes felt painful, throat/mouth felt numb, and just overall felt, odd. Swallowing was fine, not painful. Obviously can still breathe fine.\n\nNow I know this is not botulism. As food borne botulism takes 12 hours to manifest, so I am leaning towards 3 things. Histamine intolerance,regular anxiety, or something unrelated.\n\nHistamine intolerance is rare, like 1-3% of the population, and I have never had any issues with store bought stuff like yogurt or cheese, tho the levels of histamine could be different. I have never had any issues with home fermented foods either, but its been a year or 2 since I have had it.\n\nI do have anxiety, but I have never hand anything like this before. But I don't think its impossible.\n\nAs for something else? Im not allergic to anything I know of, didn't eat anything else today, and only have had a mild cold for a bit.\n\nMy next course of action is to monitor. The pain and overall \"odd\" feeling has lessened, but is still a little present, i would say it went from a 3 to a 1. From there, I will see if this is a pattern, and talk to my doctor.\n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\nUPDATE: After thinking about it for a few mins, I have came to the conclusion that its a little of all these things kinda.\n\n1.

There are some good signs that the fermentation is working: Bubbles have been forming since about day 2, there's general cloudiness in the brine and I can smell the signature lactic acid odor from the jar, together with some sweetness from the carrots.\n\nStill, there are some things I'm worried about:\n\n* The brine has turned viscous. It has the consistency of syrup\n* In the brine, there are some \"batches\" and \"strings\" that look cloudier than the rest of the water (3rd and 4th pic), especially near the bottom but also between the carrots. It doesn't look fuzzy though. It's subtle and I hope you can see it on the photos, sorry the one from the bottom is so blurry, I couldn't get it right.\n* At the top, there are some red/dark orange bits (1st and 2nd pic). They don't look fuzzy or like mold and if I had to guess, I'd say it's just bits of carrot but I'd figured I would ask just in case.\n\nI cleaned the jar with cold soapy water because I don't have hot water in my kitchen :( The salt percentage in the brine is definitely fine (2.5% of the weight of the water and carrots combined). I don't have a fermentation weight but covered the ferment with some plastic wrap to keep the carrots submerged. As bubbles started forming, some bits of carrot may have stuck out a little bit, though I tried to press them down again once or twice a day.

{"title": "Milloa: The Fizzy Traditional Indian Probiotic Drink Made with Millets", "selftext": "# Milloa: The Fizzy Traditional Indian Probiotic Drink Made with Millets\n\nDiscover the magic of Milloa - Fermented Millets Fizzy Drink GUT, a delicious probiotic beverage that not only quenches your thirst but also supports your gut health. In this blog, we'll explore the journey of creating this unique drink, its health benefits, and why it's a must-try for everyone this summer.\n\n# Introduction to Milloa\n\nMilloa is not just a drink; it\u2019s a revolution in gut health. This fermented millets fizzy drink combines traditional wisdom with modern nutrition. By utilizing the power of millets, Milloa provides a refreshing option that caters to your taste buds while also supporting your digestive system.\n\n# Why Choose Milloa?\n\n* **Probiotic Power:**\u00a0Milloa is rich in probiotics, promoting a healthy gut microbiome.\n* **Low Sugar Content:**\u00a0With significantly less sugar than traditional fizzy drinks, it\u2019s a guilt-free refreshment.\n* **Gluten-Free:**\u00a0Perfect for those with gluten sensitivities, Milloa offers a safe alternative.\n* **Accessible Ingredients:**\u00a0Made from widely available millets, anyone can recreate this health elixir.\n\n# The Importance of Probiotics\n\nProbiotics are essential for maintaining gut health. They are live microorganisms that provide numerous health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts. In today\u2019s fast-paced world, where stress and poor dietary choices are common, probiotics play a crucial role in preventing various ailments.\n\n# Health Benefits of Probiotics\n\n* **Improved Digestion:**\u00a0Probiotics assist in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients effectively.\n* **Enhanced Immunity:**\u00a0A healthy gut flora strengthens the immune system, helping to ward off infections.\n* **Reduction of Inflammation:**\u00a0Probiotics can help reduce inflammation in the gut, alleviating symptoms of conditions like IBS.\n\n# Understanding Gut Health\n\nGut health encompasses the balance of microorganisms living in the digestive tract. A well-functioning gut contributes to overall health, affecting everything from digestion to mental well-being. The gut-brain connection highlights how gut health can influence mood and cognitive function.\n\n# Signs of a Healthy Gut\n\n* **Regular Bowel Movements:**\u00a0Consistency is key; ideally, one should have daily bowel movements.\n* **Minimal Digestive Discomfort:**\u00a0Occasional bloating or gas is normal, but persistent discomfort is a sign of imbalance.\n* **Good Energy Levels:**\u00a0A healthy gut contributes to better nutrient absorption, leading to higher energy levels.\n\n# Common Gut-Related Issues\n\nMany people experience gut-related issues without realizing the root cause. Conditions such as constipation, diarrhea, and bloating are prevalent, but they can often be managed through dietary changes and the inclusion of probiotic-rich foods like Milloa.\n\n# Common Issues and Their Impact\n\n* **Constipation:**\u00a0Often caused by a lack of fiber and hydration, leading to discomfort.\n* **Diarrhea:**\u00a0Can result from infections or food intolerances, disrupting everyday life.\n* **IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome):**\u00a0A chronic condition that affects gut motility, causing various symptoms.\n\n# The Role of Modern Diet and Lifestyle\n\nModern diets often lack the nutrients necessary for a healthy gut. Processed foods, high in sugar and low in fiber, contribute to gut dysbiosis. Additionally, stress and sedentary lifestyles further exacerbate these issues, creating a cycle that can be difficult to break.\n\n# Strategies for a Healthier Gut\n\n* **Incorporate Whole Foods:**\u00a0Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes to provide essential nutrients.\n* **Stay Hydrated:**\u00a0Adequate water intake is crucial for digestion and nutrient absorption.\n* **Regular Physical Activity:**\u00a0Exercise promotes healthy digestion and reduces stress levels.\n\n# Exploring Probiotic Foods\n\nProbiotic foods are diverse and can easily be incorporated into daily meals. From yogurt to fermented vegetables, these foods are delicious and beneficial. Milloa stands out as a unique option that combines the goodness of millets with the effervescence of a fizzy drink.\n\n# The Concept of Non-Dairy Fermented Drinks\n\nAs more people become lactose intolerant or choose non-dairy lifestyles, the demand for non-dairy fermented drinks has surged. These beverages, like Milloa, offer a probiotic boost without the downsides of dairy.\n\nNon-dairy options include coconut yogurt and nut-based kefirs. They provide similar probiotic benefits without lactose, making them accessible to a wider audience. Milloa stands out by utilizing millets, making it both unique and nutritious.\n\n# The Need for a Fizzy Probiotic Drink\n\nIn today\u2019s world, the allure of fizzy drinks is undeniable. With millions consumed daily, the need for a healthier alternative is pressing. Milloa fills this gap with a fizzy probiotic drink that not only quenches thirst but also promotes gut health.\n\nFizzy beverages often contain high sugar levels, leading to health issues. Milloa offers a refreshing solution with 70% less sugar than traditional fizzy drinks. This makes it an ideal choice for those seeking a guilt-free refreshment.\n\n# Ingredients of Milloa\n\nCreating Milloa involves a simple yet powerful combination of ingredients. The primary components are millets and sugar, which together create a base for fermentation.\n\n* **Millets:**\u00a0Rich in fiber and nutrients, millets serve as the backbone of Milloa.\n* **Sugar:**\u00a0Essential for the fermentation process, it provides food for the beneficial bacteria.\n* **Water:**\u00a0Purified water is crucial for maintaining the quality of the drink.\n* **Optional Fruits:**\u00a0Ingredients like cherries or pineapples can be added for flavor and additional probiotics.\n\n# Understanding Sugar in Fermentation\n\nSugar plays a pivotal role in fermentation. It acts as food for the bacteria and yeast, fueling the fermentation process. In Milloa, the sugar content is carefully balanced, ensuring a flavorful drink without excessive sweetness.\n\nDuring fermentation, bacteria consume a significant portion of the sugar, reducing the final sugar content. This results in a drink that\u2019s not only low in sugar but also rich in probiotics. Understanding this process helps clarify why Milloa is a healthier alternative.\n\n# Why Choose Millets?\n\nMillets are a powerhouse of nutrition. They are gluten-free, high in fiber, and packed with essential vitamins and minerals. Choosing millets for Milloa ensures that the drink is not only tasty but also beneficial for your health.\n\nFurthermore, millets have a low glycemic index, making them suitable for those managing blood sugar levels. Their rich prebiotic fiber content supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, enhancing the overall health benefits of Milloa.\n\n# The Science Behind Milloa\n\nThe fermentation process of Milloa involves various microorganisms, including Saccharomyces yeast and Lactobacillus bacteria. These organisms work together to convert sugars into probiotics, creating a fizzy, health-boosting drink.\n\nAs the fermentation progresses, the drink develops its unique flavor profile and carbonation. This scientific approach not only improves taste but also maximizes the health benefits, making Milloa a delightful addition to your diet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4scwm5xb4ue1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb17ba395c8a2b2d052e14cdbdcfe02a4158148\n\n# The Process of Making Milloa\n\nCreating Milloa is a delightful journey that starts with selecting the right ingredients. The process begins by soaking millets, which helps reduce anti-nutrients and enhances bioavailability. Soak the millets for 24 hours to prepare them for fermentation.\n\nAfter soaking, drain the water and place the millets in a sprouting box. This step is crucial as it allows the millets to germinate slightly, which boosts their nutrient profile. Once sprouted, blend the millets into a smooth paste.\n\nNext, mix the millet paste with sugar and purified water in a clean jar. The typical ratio is about 1/3 cup of millets to 4 tablespoons of sugar and 750 ml of water. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.\n\nCover the jar with a cloth and let it ferment for 3 to 4 days. Daily stirring is essential to prevent any unwanted mold and to ensure even fermentation.\n\n# Fermentation: The Key to Probiotics\n\nFermentation is where the magic happens. During this process, beneficial bacteria and yeasts, such as Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus, consume the sugars, producing probiotics and carbonation. This natural fermentation transforms the millets into a fizzy, gut-friendly drink.\n\nAs fermentation progresses, the sugar content decreases significantly, typically by 50-70%. This not only results in lower sugar levels but also enhances the drink's health benefits, making Milloa a refreshing alternative to sugary beverages.\n\nIt's fascinating to note that the probiotics produced during fermentation can support digestion and boost immunity, making Milloa a powerhouse of health benefits.\n\n# Final Touches and Serving Suggestions\n\nAfter the fermentation period, it's time to add the final touches. For added flavor, consider mixing in fruits like cherries or pineapples, which not only enhance taste but also contribute additional probiotics.\n\nOnce mixed, give the drink a good shake to ensure everything is well combined. Serve Milloa chilled for a refreshing experience. You can also garnish it with mint leaves or a slice of lemon for an extra zing.\n\nThis versatile drink can be enjoyed on its own or paired with meals. It makes an excellent accompaniment to spicy dishes, balancing flavors while benefiting your gut health.\n\n# Tasting Milloa\n\nWhen you take your first sip of Milloa, you\u2019ll notice its unique flavor profile. The balance of sweetness and slight tang from the fermentation is refreshing. The fizzy texture adds to the overall experience, making it a delightful drink for any occasion.\n\nAs you taste, pay attention to the subtle notes of the millets and the added fruits. Each batch may vary slightly, offering a new experience with every preparation. This unpredictability is part of the charm of homemade fermented drinks.\n\nInvite friends or family to taste Milloa and watch their surprise upon learning it\u2019s made from millets. It's a conversation starter and a testament to the creativity in health-conscious drinking.\n\n# Conclusion: Benefits of Milloa\n\nMilloa - Fermented Millets Fizzy Drink GUT is more than just a refreshing beverage; it's a step toward better gut health. Packed with probiotics, low in sugar, and gluten-free, it caters to a wide audience looking for healthier drink options.\n\nIncluding Milloa in your diet can help prevent future health issues related to gut imbalance. It supports digestion, enhances immunity, and may even improve mental well-being. With its unique blend of flavors and health benefits, Milloa is a drink worth trying.\n\nSo, this summer, introduce your loved ones to Milloa and share the joy of this health-boosting drink. It\u2019s not just a drink; it\u2019s a lifestyle choice that promotes better health for everyone.\n\n# How Much Sugar Is Left in Milloa After Fermentation?\n\nMilloa is a naturally fizzy, probiotic-rich drink made from fermented millets and fruits\u2014crafted with love and gut-health in mind.

{"title": "Where Am I Going Wrong?", "selftext": "I\u2019m trying to start a ginger bug. The guide I\u2019m following is simple: 2 c filtered water, 1 T brown sugar, 1 T skin on ginger cut 1/8 inch, mix until sugar is dissolved. Every 24 hours, feed 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp ginger. \n\n1st attempt: went very well at first. I actually totally misread the recipe and 1. peeled my ginger and 2. realized the entire time that the recipe called for 2 tsp of ginger and 2 tsp of sugar, not one tsp of each. Either way, it was a very happy ginger bug. I made it to day 5 with bubbles galore. Kept it on the counter top in a corner of my kitchen. It was about 95 degrees outside, and it\u2019s consistently 75-78 degrees inside and very dry, as I live in the desert. \n\nHere comes day 6. It starts smelling\u2026 strong. Not bad, but a little\u2026 cheesy? I call this yeasty in my head and move on. I decided to (stupidly) follow the recipe and start feeding it the 2 tsp of each. Then day 7\u2026 I wake up, excited to make my ginger beer\u2026 no bubbles. At all. I read everything on here to troubleshoot. I took out a 1/4 cup, replaced with a 1/4 cup of filtered water, let it rest a day, nothing. So I pitched it. Started new.\n\nAttempt #2:\n\nI re sanitize EVERYTHING. Jar, lid, measuring spoon, hands, KNIFE, CUTTING BOARD, COUNTERTOP. After aggressively sanitizing everything in sight, let\u2019s get down to business. This time I chop my very clean, very fresh ginger SKIN ON this time. Into my jar goes 2 cups of filtered water, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp of 1/8in cubes of ginger. Next day, bubbles already! I feed it 2 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp ginger, give the outside of the jar a (sanitized) kiss and put it to sleep for the night. Day 2, even more bubbles! I feed again, same thing, only this time, I notice before I go to bed\u2026 there\u2019s no bubbles? Maybe I just need to wait until the morning. Next morning\u2026 nothing. I waited all day at work just thinking about my bug and the delicious ginger beer I\u2019ll have if I do it correctly. All the friends I\u2019ll make when I tell everyone that I ferment my own sodas. I get home and there\u2019s 2 LITTLE TINY F***ING FLOATING FUZZY WHITE BITS OF MOLD?! Why?! Okay. Discard. Try again.\n\nAttempt #3:\n\nToday we are on day #4. I sanitized EVERYTHING AGAIN. TWICE. Followed the same steps, but I\u2019m back to peeling my ginger and only feeding 1 tsp ginger/sugar a day because I had success with my first batch doing that and I feel like feeding 2 tsp is what offed my first batch. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just going with my gut. I\u2019m seeing absolutely no bubbles and it\u2019s day 4, but I don\u2019t want to give up. She smells good, she looks good. And it sounds stupid, but I see some bubbles when I shake it. Maybe that\u2019s just from shaking it. lol I read on this thread to give it a sugar break for a few days, so today is day one of a sugar break. The first 2 days I believe I\u2019ve been feeding it ginger that wasn\u2019t minced enough, so I chopped it up smaller yesterday and started feeding her smaller bits of ginger. \n\nI\u2019ve fermented so many things, but am having such a hard time getting a ginger bug going.

{"title": "Turned sour \ud83d\ude1e", "selftext": "This is my first ever try at making \"Sato\", the Thai variety of a Doburoku-ish drink. Unfortunately this experiment looks bust and I'm learning from the experience. I'd like to run a few aspects of this failure by this community and see what's there to learn and improve, avoid and retry.\n\nFirst off, the end result; this batch turned sour.. and there was no real way of keeping an eye on taste development.. Sato is brewed by adding a \"Sato ball\" (a fungus/yeast combo)  to a portion of steamed rice. Unlike Doburoku the first stage of about a week is a dry is stage. No water added except that which is contained in the steamed rice. The fungus starts to turn the starches into sugars, and sort of simultaneously the yeast start to kick in. At about a week into the process 1L of water is added to 1Kg of rice. Then supposedly a last fermenting phase takes place lasting about three days. The brew should be separated from the solids and kept in fridge. Longer fermenting supposedly has the brew turn sour.\nAfter 3 days the result should be a cloudy, sweet raw rice wine. Similar to Doburoku.\n\nSo, today was adding the water day.. I did. The dry stuff in the jar smelled like a rice wine, kind of sweet-ish with a distinct alcoholic vapor. Actually quite an attractive bouquet. After adding the water the brew started bubbling quite a bit, so all seemed in order.  A few hours later I could finally have a little taste of the brew as there were enough liquids to actually do so..  okay.. the stuff tasted sour.. not really like a vinegar, more acidic-ish.. (I lack proper expertise to characterise the taste better)\n\nSome details of my process that may have caused the sourness: (?) \n\n1. I used more Sato powder (fungus*yeast) than stated in the recipe. I crushed one ball to powder but ended up using about 30/40% more as I felt the amount I should add looked ludicrously minimal compared to the amount of sweet rice.\n\n2. I do not own a rice steamer and cooked my rice. It may have been a tad over cooked.. not mushy tho!\n\n3. I did, as per the traditional recipe, wash the steamed rice to loosen the grains. Again here, I did not completely let the grains dry. Strained them and added to the jar. Rice was far from dripping wet, but certainly also not dry. \n\n4. During the dry stage (first 6-7 days) I cracked the lid a few times to smell the brew. (Check for foul smell) I did notice a slight turn to a yellowish color of the rice in the jar that had me worried. The smell was fantastic so, worries gone.. but did I introduce acetic bacteria? The stuff that has wines spoil to vinegar??\n\n5. At the start I did however thoroughly clean containers l, even with rubbing alcohol to decontaminate as much as possible. (Which seemed as waaa\u00e1y over doing it as a friend of mine in Thailand is doing the same recipy in the middle of the jungle with quite poor sanitation.. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f???\n\n6. Temperature?? In Thailand the brew is done around 30-40 celcius during day time.. so the fungus/yeast combo operates at quite high temps i guess.. much higher as the 20 celcius ish where Doburoku is preferably is brewed at.. here in Portugal in my place its been early spring and quite cold. I kept my room to about 22ish with a heater. The jars were in front of the window, so may have been a bit colder even. At coldest times I moved the jars a bit closer to the heater as I feared a stalled process (remember ambient temps in Thailand are waaa\u00e1y higher during the brew process)..\n\nSo, all in all, theres been quite some guesswork and loosy loosy approach.. I admit. But it seemed a recipy that allowed for much looseness?? I'm about to just give it another go.. got more Sato balls and lots of time on my hands. Just wondering what I should take from this try and learn, improve and or avoid.\n\nAny souls out there willing to chime in?

This time I mostly followed a recipe except that I decided to split the fermentation up into 2 stages.\n\nThe mix in the big jar (distilled water, 1 cup sugar, 60g ginger grated and boiled, half cup ginger bug) is about 40 hours old and was starting to show some carbonation. I tasted it and it still had some sugar but I wanted to add more to jumpstart the secondary ferment and leave the final product a bit sweeter.

It\u2019s hard to imagine the yeast metabolizing the free sugars in a matter of seconds, but I can\u2019t make sense of why this would happen chemically either.

{"title": "Simple L. reuteri \"Oats Based Protective Matrix\" Protocol for Better Stomach Acid Survival", "selftext": "  \nThis post was removed on\u00a0[r/Microbiome](https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/)\u00a0so to keep it alive, I am crossposting here as it may benefit others.  \n  \nHi everyone, I wanted to share a simple protocol I just started based on research around improving L. reuteri survival through the stomach, and I would love to get thoughts from others who are experimenting with this strain.\n\nI\u2019m aware of the popular L. reuteri yogurt method, but I have a hunch this might be just as effective at delivering the bacteria to the small intestine \u2014 and much easier. That said, I'm open to feedback, as I could be overlooking something that makes this less effective.\n\n# The Idea:\n\nThe goal is to give Oats Based Protective Matrix(via Biogaia Baby drops) a better chance to survive gastric acid and reach the small intestine in higher numbers, where it seems to work its magic.\n\n# My Protocol:\n\n* Step 1: Eat a small to normal meal first This helps naturally buffer stomach acid (raises pH temporarily). I include gut-friendly foods like oats, chia seeds, bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin seeds for fiber and prebiotic effects.\n* Step 2: Mid-meal (or about 2/3 of the way through), I take:\n   * 1 tablespoon of raw rolled oats (dry) with 10 drops of L. reuteri drops dripped directly onto the oats.\n   * Let it sit for 5\u201310 minutes to soak in (which it does very effectively).\n   * Drizzle 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) over the oats.\n   * \u26a0\ufe0f Be mindful that many EVOO brands are not truly pure EVOO. I recommend finding one that has been lab tested \u2014 there are plenty of websites and YouTube videos helping identify authentic EVOO depending on where you live.\n* Optional: Add a pinch of inulin powder or other resistant starch like green bananas for extra prebiotics.\n* Step 3: Swallow the soaked oats without too much chewing. The goal is to let the oats and EVOO act as a \"natural capsule\" to help L. reuteri pass through the stomach more intact.\n\n# Why I\u2019m Trying This:\n\n* EVOO slows gastric emptying and may protect the bacteria.\n* Oats and fiber could act as both a vehicle and a prebiotic which in the 37 degree Celsius of the small intestine is a great place to ferment day after day.\n* Mid-meal timing takes advantage of naturally buffered stomach conditions.\n\n# Plan:\n\nI\u2019ll be sticking to this daily (or twice daily) and plan to report back over the next few weeks to share:\n\n* Any noticeable effects (gut health, mood, sleep, etc.)\n* Any tweaks I make along the way\n\n# Questions:\n\n* Has anyone else tried something similar?\n* Any suggestions to refine this further?\n* Would love to hear from anyone who\u2019s done other \u201cDIY\u201d delivery methods for L. reuteri\n* Am I going against the already proven Yogurt method with my method already proven ineffective?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts, and I hope to create a bit of a log here as I go!\n\nThis is what my \"Oats Based Protective Matrix\" looked like when ready to be eaten.  Was an easy one bite swallow.  I hope the majority of the L. reuteri makes it way through my stomach acid.

{"title": "Ginger bug advice", "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI'm very new to ginger bugs and was hoping for some advice. Last week I made my very first ginger bug, after one day I already started to see some activity, and as I kept feeding it, it started to bubble even more (so excited to see it actually worked!). I added some of the ginger bug liquid to some apple juice and then put the ginger bug in the fridge.\n\nAfter two days, I popped open the apple juice to see how fizzy it had gotten and what it would taste like. There were some bubbles and the taste was fine, but it could have done with some more time to ferment. So I'd like to try it again.\n\nNow my question is, what do you do when you want to use your ginger bug, but it's in the fridge? Do you just take it out, use some liquid (even though there aren't any bubbles), feed it and put it back in the fridge? Do you let it warm up to room temperature and wait for it to become active again? Do you feed it and leave it on the counter?\n\nAnother question, do you burp your bottles? Why or why not? And how often?\n\nThank you in advance for your advice! :) \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1jota5c/ginger_bug_advice/", "created_utc": 1743506998.0, "score": 3, "author": "histam_ine", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jota5c/ginger_bug_advice/", "html_title": ""}

I went on a deep dive on processes and methods and pretty quickly discovered a divide in methodology regarding brine and salinity percentage calculations.

I've read various posts here and watched a few YouTube videos (Alton Brown's Good Eats pickles episode [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4SKZ9BF2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4SKZ9BF2c) and Brad from Bon Appetit's pickles [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6XWXj9l8Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6XWXj9l8Q) ). In the videos, they don't measure the weight of the food. But people on this subreddit insist on including the weight of the food. Calculating salinity based on the weight of the water AND the food makes the most sense to me. I guess I'm wondering, methodology-wise, if we are immersing food in a solution with a given salinity, or, are we achieving an end result with a given salinity. Those are two very different things.\n\nThat said, I'm no food scientist. But this is science. I'm not concerned with comments about overthinking. I WANT THE TRUTH!

One is my mesophilic ferment, and the second is my thermophilic ferment. The Thermo I keep in my Instant Pot on regular mode basically 24/7 (temp ranges 104-107F). The Meso I keep on the counter at room temperature ~72F. They've only been going since 3/28 (2 days now) I've been \"feeding\" them both with a little bit of heated whole milk.

As I mentioned before, I barely produce milk anymore as my youngest is 2.5 years old and nurses infrequently, so I can't just use more breastmilk to feed the culture. By culturing raw breastmilk and feeding it pasteurized whole milk, those breastmilk cultures inoculate the whole milk without the need of large quantities of breastmilk!\nIt appears it's going to work out beautifully and can't wait to see what kinds of yogurts and cheeses I can make with my 2 cultures!

I also am wondering if it isn't the honey that is the issue if its maybe the new ingredients : ginger bug ratio as I feel like maybe I need to improve on that too (I currently use 200ml ginger bug in a 500ml bottle).\n\nAny advice is appreciated ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1jm2yhn/ginger_beerale_making_advice/", "created_utc": 1743189030.0, "score": 5, "author": "Horror-Contest9452", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jm2yhn/ginger_beerale_making_advice/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Questions about gingerbug/soda making", "selftext": "I am a complete newbie here and need some guidance. I made my first gingerbug about 3 weeks ago and it did get bubbles around day 3 but then they went away and never really came back.(The recipe I used said not to worry if you don't see bubbles, that the yeast are working behind the scenes) On day 7 still no bubbles but the recipe said to strain on day 7, so I strained the giner out and put it in the fridge, as the recipe called for. I tried to make gingerale from that ginger bug and after 15 days of it sitting room temp, it refuses to carbonate, and now I realize it's probably because the bug wasn't active enough. \n\nThis brings me to my first question, \u2022is it safe to drink that ginger ale after it sitting out for so long?\u2022 I took a tiny sip and it tasted pretty good and I know some fermentation happened because its not nearly as sweet as it was when I first bottled it and has a bit of a twang to the mouth feel. Hopefully I dont get sick\ud83d\ude2c\n\nThat first gingerbug I made, I ended up having to toss because after my soda didn't work out, I took it out of the fridge and tried to re-vamp my bug, I fed it ginger and sugar and then covered the jar with a paper towel per advice of some online article(BIG mistake). I woke up the next morning to mold on all the ginger that was floating on top. Now I'm making my second ginger bug(pictured) and this time I put it in a Fido jar with the gasket taken off, to avoid any possible mold or bacteria getting in. The same thing is happening as the first, bubbles on day 2/3 and then nothing. I fed it 2 tsp of ginger/sugar for 2 days, skipped day 3, fed again day 4 and the bubbles disappeared. It is now day 7 for this bug and Im not sure how to proceed. What am I doing wrong? Could it be the temperature in my house? I live in PA and its been a bit chilly, my thermostat is set to 68\u00b0 F.Everytime I feed and stir, I can hear crackling, so what gives?? Any advice would be appreciated because I really want this to work out! Can this current ginger bug be saved?\n\nShould note, yes I did use organic ginger with the skin on, organic sugar and spring water. Frustrated with how many differing opinions and directions there are, that all seem to conflict..one person says you \"shouldn't cover it with a lid, it needs oxygen.\" Another says \"no!

{"title": "Any advice to achieve different EFFECTS in the spicyness of a fermented sauce? (Slighly long post)", "selftext": "TL;DR: \n\nAny tip on how to achieve some modifications of the effects on the table below, with ingredients like Raw chillies in your previously fermented mash to increase the Heat Level, adding fats to delay the Burn Speed or to make it lingers (increase Burn duration). Etc.\n\nLong version:\n\nI hope this post makes any sense to the community, I know most of us have some experience as an amateur or in some cases professional fermenters, so I was wondering if anyone has recommendations about how to achieve different effects in fermented spicy sauce recipes (tips for non-fermented versions or variations are welcome!). \n\nAllow me to explain, in the particular case of spicy sauce we all know that the spicy sauce's organoleptic characteristics might vary according to the ingredients the recipe includes or the process used. Sadly I have seen many posts being a little vague in the way they describe their final product and if you have ever checked the /hotsauce community you will notice the same issue. Also, spicy sauce naming conventions do not help since almost every sauce is related to well-common tropes like \"hell XYZ\", \"bu\\*\\*hole destroyer 3000\", \"the last xxx\", \"the bomb\", \"nuclear xyz\", and the likes or even some eye rolling names such as \"Sauce wars: The Curry awakens\".\n\nAnyway, rant over. While I know the Scoville scale exists and many products put some kind of \"meter\" to the heat level, this does not reflect on other characteristics that the sauce might have like \"lingering effect\", \"sensation\", \"mouthfeel\" and the likes. Therefore, I brainstormed the next table describing in more detail some other aspects I have found in some sauces:\n\n|Characteristic|What It Means|Example|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Heat Level (HL)**|How spicy it is. (The most basic metric)|Jalape\u00f1o (mild), Habanero (hot)|\n|**Burn Speed (BS)**|How fast the heat hits. (Some hit you as soon as they hit your mouth)|Wasabi (fast), Ghost Pepper (slow)|\n|**Burn Duration (BD)**|How long the burn lasts. (Some hit like a truck but dissipate very fast while others linger for a very very long time)|Jalape\u00f1o (short), Habanero (long)|\n|**Stacking Effect (SE)**|Gets hotter with each bite. (Heat stacks, might start mild but it might stack to barely tolerable levels)|Sichuan oil, Korean gochujang|\n|**Mouth Feel (MF)**|Type of sensation. (Usually non capsaicin ingredients might give a spicy sauce some extra feel, particularly in the lips, or nostrils)|Numbing (Sichuan), Sharp (Mustard), Sinus clearing (Raw garlic)|\n|**Burn Location (BL)**|Where you feel it. (Might be personal but, some really make my lips burn but leave my tonge okayish?)|Tip of tongue, throat, lips|\n|**Addictive Quality (AQ)**|Makes you want more despite the burn. (There is an \"Addictive\" quality that some sauces have that even when you can barely tolerate them you want, no you NEED to keep eating it in that moment)|Samyang noodles, spicy chips, some snack \"sauces\"|\n|**Flavor Match (FM)**|How well does heat blend with the taste. (Commonly some fruity sauces can be paired really well with desserts but rarely you will pair a garlic forward sauce with your vanilla ice cream)|Thai chilli (balanced, pair well with almost all), Raw green chilli (harsh, vegetable flavour, better for sour or light savory dishes like fish)|\n\nParticularly I am looking for something to increase the AQ and the SE of my fermented mash. Usually I mix some mango (after ferment does not taste sweet) to provide enough sugar to the bacteria, and lots of garlic for the bulk flavour, Thai chillies as a balanced base with, Bhut Jolokia (Indian ghost pepper) for the smoky flavour and after the mash has fermented for 2 weeks I add some ACV and fresh Thai chillies to up the HL since the ferment tame the product a lot. \n\nThe result is a sauce with: \n\n|HL|BS|BD|SE|MF|BL|AQ|FM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|High|Fast|Medium|Zero|Sharp+Hot|Tongue,+Volatile (careful with your throat or you will cough)|Medium|Great for Sour, and Savory dishes.|\n\nNote: I know I am overthinking it but, I guess the community got what I mean with this post :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1kaj9qr/any_advice_to_achieve_different_effects_in_the/", "created_utc": 1745916643.0, "score": 26, "author": "Wiz718", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1kaj9qr/any_advice_to_achieve_different_effects_in_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Ginger Bug Soda Concerns - First Timer", "selftext": "First time posting and making ginger bug sodas. I have a new ginger bug that I think may not be very strong yet, because it took a very long time to get any kind of fermentation going (so long, that for two of my sodas I reboiled them, strained them, and added new ginger bug liquid after it had gotten a bit more robust). I now have two bottles of blueberry sage soda that are aggressively carbonated, but are filled with solids that look disconcerting to me. Part of this may have been the method: I worry I didn't strain out enough of the blueberry solids when I made the initial syrup, which also got too jammy, so I dissolved the jelly I made in water before bottling it with the ginger bug--another potential issue?\n\nMy question is the same as most posters: do these look okay? what's the deal with these solids at the top?  Also, in the third photo while I've just burped it, you can kind of see the solids at the bottom moving up and down from top to bottom, floating in the liquid. What's the deal with that? Is it safe?\n\nI've had them fermenting for a while now, a couple of weeks, partly because I've been busy and loathe to dump them even though I know that's well beyond standard fermentation length for sodas of this kind.

My family never made it tho so I have no secret recipe. I've usually bought the zakwas pasteurized or home made from a shop.\n\nBut this Easter I chose to finally make my own zakwas. In looking up recipes and in cookbooks I own, the ratio of flour to water varies WIDELY, to the point I've never seen an identical recipe. Other variations are spices/no spices and stirring/no stirring. \n\nI settled on 1/2 cup flour to 500ml of water, but I've seen recipes that more than double this quantity for the same amount of water, but also half the amount for twice the amount of water. I also settled on no spices or garlic since it's my first zakwas. I'm using a cheesecloth, and keeping it close-ish to the radiator because I tend to keep a cold ish house at this time of the year and I'm cutting it super close.\n\nI haven't been stirring because that appears to be the standard, but I'm on day 3 and I went from no activity to a thick foamy layer this morning so I stirred it back in so it could settle and prevent mold formation. It definitely has a *smell* that's mildly unpleasant but I tasted and it's close to what I expect and obviously it's not done fermenting.\n\nAnyways, just looking for some clarity on why ratios and instructions vary so widely for zakwas. Anyone with some expert knowledge could help me understand whether more water would make it more or less sour, how much of the flour itself people normally find palatable for the soup, etc. I would say I have significantly more flour as is compared to zakwas I've bought, but then again I do get disappointed sometimes when a batch I've bought is not sour enough.\n\nWeso\u0142ych \u015awi\u0105t", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1k2g91z/question_about_zakwas_na_\u017curek/", "created_utc": 1745011955.0, "score": 1, "author": "mencryforme5", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1k2g91z/question_about_zakwas_na_\u017curek/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Beautiful Butterfly Pea Tea Soda", "selftext": "As far as the fizz goes these drinks have more hit to the throat than store brands. And it is all without chemicals, artificial ingredients/sweeteners and colors. Three ingredients for the base that makes the fizz: organic unpeeled ginger, bottled spring water and organic sugar. The tea or liquid you choose for flavor is endless. Above, that is Butterfly Pea tea, an organic tea that is naturally blue and used for coloring other foods.\n\nAdding lemon will turn the tea purple.\n\n\nThe nutritive properties of the tea are:\n(http://rawandlovely.blogspot.com/2014/02/health-benefits-of-butterfly-pea-tea.html)\n*  Strengthens the hair for healthy hair growth\n*  Prevents skin bruising\n*  Keeps skin glowing & healthy\n*  Treats urinary problems\n*  Improves eyesight & night vision\n*  Treats eye infections\n*  Stimulates blood circulation\n*  Detoxifies the whole body\n*  Provides antioxidants\n*  Slows aging process\n*  Enhances immune system \n\nAnd:\n(http://www.wildturmeric.net/2015/12/blue-butterfly-pea-tea-recipe-health-benefits-medicinal-uses.html)\n1. Butterfly pea tea is full of antioxidants and has been proven through clinical research. You can find the link to the study.\n2. Butterfly pea tea has been proven to have anti glycation properties. Glycation is damage caused to protein because of sugar molecules and it is one of the main causes of skin aging. Butterfly pea tea prevents this damage and helps prevent premature aging of our skin. You can find the link to the study.\n3. Butterfly pea tea has been shown to have anti inflammatory properties. \n4. Butterfly pea tea is very good for people suffering from chronic fatigue as it improves vitality. \n5. The tea has been proven to have analgesic properties (pain relieving properties). You can find the link to the study proving it's analgesic and anti inflammatory properties. \n\nAnd the taste is smooth and subtle... until you make it into a ginger ale. Then the fizz will refresh you and take you back for more. \n\nYou should know this drink is probiotic. That's a great thing.\n\n\nThe recipe for the ginger bug. You have to have this in order to turn the tea into soda...\n1 hand of fresh organic ginger (just get a piece the size of your hand and you will have enough)\n6 tablespoons Organic sugar\n1 cup bottled spring water (if your city uses chloramine in its water then bottled water is essential. You cannot boil the chemical out and need to purchase a special filter to get rid of it. It is not the same chemical as chlorine.)\n1 tablespoon organic white or apple cider vinegar\nSpring water for rinsing\n\nUsing a jar with screw on lid, add the vinegar and some bottled water. About 1/4 cup total. Put lid on jar and swirl liquid around to coat the entire inside. Pour out solution then rinse with some more water. The reason for this is to remove any residue that may inhibit growth of the yeast needed to produce your carbonation (fizz). The yeast grows from the unpeeled ginger and the sugar. The vinegar promotes the process. It is important to use organic unpeeled ginger. Regular ginger has been irradiated and that will prevent the yeast from forming and you are trying to not use chemical or processed ingredients in this healthy drink.\n\nGrate ginger to get 3 tablespoons. Add to the clean jar.\nAdd the 3 tablespoons of sugar.\nAdd the 1 cup of water.\nEither stir or shake to mix.\nSet bug aside for 24 hours.\nOn the second day, add another tablespoon of ginger and another tablespoon of sugar.\nRepeat for two more days.\nOn the third day your bug is ready to use.\n\nWhile your bug is fermenting decide which flavor you want. You can just use lemon, more spring water and more sugar if you just want plain. But this post is about the Butterfly Pea tea...\n\n\nApproximately 56 ounces spring bottled water\n1/2 cup dried Butterfly Pea tea flowers\nat least 1/2 cup organic cane sugar\nYou can either add or not add the juice and rind of a whole fresh lemon. The lemon will turn the tea a yummy looking purple. (see photos).\n1/2 gallon (64 0z) canning jar with screw on lid or regular ring/lid combo.\n\n\nIn a stainless steel pot, add 2 cups of spring water. Bring to a boil. Add the tea flowers. Let steep until mixture is cool.\n\nRinse jar with the vinegar/water solution as you did with the bug. Be sure to do a second rinse with plain bottled water.\nAdd 1 cup of ginger bug\nAdd the cooled Butterfly Pea tea\nIf you are using the lemon add it now...\nAdd the 1/2 cup sugar. (at this point you may want to add up to another 1/2 of cup because the yeast will eat most of the sugar and the drink will be very tart)\nAdd enough water to fill the jar to within 1 inch. \nMix well until sugar has dissolved.\nScrew on lid.\nPlace jar out of direct sunlight but not in the refrigerator. The location should be warm at least 70 degrees.\nAllow to ferment for three days.\nStir or shake drink to mix up the yeast that has settled to the bottom and then strain mixture into a container like a large mixing cup.\nPour into individual swing top bottles like the one pictured below or acquire Groslch beer bottles. Both are made to withstand the pressure of carbonated drinks.\nAfter bottling chill in refrigerator and leave there until ready to drink.\n\nAt this point you should know that this process creates a lot of carbonation. When you open a bottle it may blow the bale either back or off the bottle. To keep from losing your drink place the bottle in a bowl before opening. In that way you will catch what shoots out. You will probably try to catch what shoots out by trying to drink it.

Put all of the ingredients in a glass container, stir the mixture and leave it in a cold place or a fridge.\n\n2. Shake the moto yeast starter once a day for 10 days. The finished moto looks like a cream-soup.\n\nInstruction: Sake (14-32 days process)\n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 1\n\n1. Cook rice for 1 cup (380 g. steamed rice = 1 cup 200 g. uncooked sushi rice), cool it to room temperature.  Then put in a big glass container. This way you\u2019ll be able to oversee the whole process. Coat inside with cooking wine before use. \n\n2. Add 500 ml of water\n\n3. Add the moto yeast starter \n\n4. Add a cup of Koji rice (160 g)\n\n5. Mix well, leave at the cold place, stir the mixture every 10-12 hours \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 3\n\n1.

Mix well, leave at the cold place, stir the mixture every 10-12 hours \n\n \n\n\uf0a7 Day 5\n\n1. Add the remaining 1,140g steamed rice (3 cups uncooked sushi rice).\n\n2. Add Koji rice 380 g.\n\n3. Add 2 liters of water, stir and leave in a cold place for 2-3 weeks depend how strong of alcohol you prefer.\n\n4. You will have to stir every 10-12 hours, to keeping the fermentation in balance. \n\n5. Strain it through a cheesecloth and bottle.

For context this isn't my first time ever fermenting, I have a tiny amount of experience, but brine fermented veggies is new to me.\n\nSo I followed the basics, did a 2.0-2.5 brine, let is do its thing for a few weeks. Upon initial inspection, it looked fine, no mold, no nothing. even no signs of kham yeast (which i know is safe).\n\nSmell test pass, smelled like brussel sprouts so kinda farty but nothing bad.\n\nThen came the taste test. I ate a full half, it was tarty and tangy, exactly what i was looking for.\n\nThen about 5 mins later, i felt odd, almost like an allergic reaction. My lymph nodes felt painful, throat/mouth felt numb, and just overall felt, odd. Swallowing was fine, not painful. Obviously can still breathe fine.\n\nNow I know this is not botulism. As food borne botulism takes 12 hours to manifest, so I am leaning towards 3 things. Histamine intolerance,regular anxiety, or something unrelated.\n\nHistamine intolerance is rare, like 1-3% of the population, and I have never had any issues with store bought stuff like yogurt or cheese, tho the levels of histamine could be different. I have never had any issues with home fermented foods either, but its been a year or 2 since I have had it.\n\nI do have anxiety, but I have never hand anything like this before. But I don't think its impossible.\n\nAs for something else? Im not allergic to anything I know of, didn't eat anything else today, and only have had a mild cold for a bit.\n\nMy next course of action is to monitor. The pain and overall \"odd\" feeling has lessened, but is still a little present, i would say it went from a 3 to a 1. From there, I will see if this is a pattern, and talk to my doctor.\n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\nUPDATE: After thinking about it for a few mins, I have came to the conclusion that its a little of all these things kinda.\n\n1.

(it\u2019s 3 days old) or should I make a new batch of chopped ginger\n\n-could I use a mason jar and do I keep the lid on or use cheesecloth?\n\n-is my first batch dead/dying\n\nthanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1jv5fml/2nd_gingerbug_tryquestions/", "created_utc": 1744204322.0, "score": 1, "author": "SatisfactionHot7603", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jv5fml/2nd_gingerbug_tryquestions/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Where Am I Going Wrong?", "selftext": "I\u2019m trying to start a ginger bug. The guide I\u2019m following is simple: 2 c filtered water, 1 T brown sugar, 1 T skin on ginger cut 1/8 inch, mix until sugar is dissolved. Every 24 hours, feed 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp ginger. \n\n1st attempt: went very well at first. I actually totally misread the recipe and 1. peeled my ginger and 2. realized the entire time that the recipe called for 2 tsp of ginger and 2 tsp of sugar, not one tsp of each. Either way, it was a very happy ginger bug. I made it to day 5 with bubbles galore. Kept it on the counter top in a corner of my kitchen. It was about 95 degrees outside, and it\u2019s consistently 75-78 degrees inside and very dry, as I live in the desert. \n\nHere comes day 6. It starts smelling\u2026 strong. Not bad, but a little\u2026 cheesy? I call this yeasty in my head and move on. I decided to (stupidly) follow the recipe and start feeding it the 2 tsp of each. Then day 7\u2026 I wake up, excited to make my ginger beer\u2026 no bubbles. At all. I read everything on here to troubleshoot. I took out a 1/4 cup, replaced with a 1/4 cup of filtered water, let it rest a day, nothing. So I pitched it. Started new.\n\nAttempt #2:\n\nI re sanitize EVERYTHING. Jar, lid, measuring spoon, hands, KNIFE, CUTTING BOARD, COUNTERTOP. After aggressively sanitizing everything in sight, let\u2019s get down to business. This time I chop my very clean, very fresh ginger SKIN ON this time. Into my jar goes 2 cups of filtered water, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp of 1/8in cubes of ginger. Next day, bubbles already! I feed it 2 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp ginger, give the outside of the jar a (sanitized) kiss and put it to sleep for the night. Day 2, even more bubbles! I feed again, same thing, only this time, I notice before I go to bed\u2026 there\u2019s no bubbles? Maybe I just need to wait until the morning. Next morning\u2026 nothing. I waited all day at work just thinking about my bug and the delicious ginger beer I\u2019ll have if I do it correctly. All the friends I\u2019ll make when I tell everyone that I ferment my own sodas. I get home and there\u2019s 2 LITTLE TINY F***ING FLOATING FUZZY WHITE BITS OF MOLD?! Why?! Okay. Discard. Try again.\n\nAttempt #3:\n\nToday we are on day #4. I sanitized EVERYTHING AGAIN. TWICE. Followed the same steps, but I\u2019m back to peeling my ginger and only feeding 1 tsp ginger/sugar a day because I had success with my first batch doing that and I feel like feeding 2 tsp is what offed my first batch. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just going with my gut. I\u2019m seeing absolutely no bubbles and it\u2019s day 4, but I don\u2019t want to give up. She smells good, she looks good. And it sounds stupid, but I see some bubbles when I shake it. Maybe that\u2019s just from shaking it. lol I read on this thread to give it a sugar break for a few days, so today is day one of a sugar break. The first 2 days I believe I\u2019ve been feeding it ginger that wasn\u2019t minced enough, so I chopped it up smaller yesterday and started feeding her smaller bits of ginger. \n\nI\u2019ve fermented so many things, but am having such a hard time getting a ginger bug going.

{"title": "Turned sour \ud83d\ude1e", "selftext": "This is my first ever try at making \"Sato\", the Thai variety of a Doburoku-ish drink. Unfortunately this experiment looks bust and I'm learning from the experience. I'd like to run a few aspects of this failure by this community and see what's there to learn and improve, avoid and retry.\n\nFirst off, the end result; this batch turned sour.. and there was no real way of keeping an eye on taste development.. Sato is brewed by adding a \"Sato ball\" (a fungus/yeast combo)  to a portion of steamed rice. Unlike Doburoku the first stage of about a week is a dry is stage. No water added except that which is contained in the steamed rice. The fungus starts to turn the starches into sugars, and sort of simultaneously the yeast start to kick in. At about a week into the process 1L of water is added to 1Kg of rice. Then supposedly a last fermenting phase takes place lasting about three days. The brew should be separated from the solids and kept in fridge. Longer fermenting supposedly has the brew turn sour.\nAfter 3 days the result should be a cloudy, sweet raw rice wine. Similar to Doburoku.\n\nSo, today was adding the water day.. I did. The dry stuff in the jar smelled like a rice wine, kind of sweet-ish with a distinct alcoholic vapor. Actually quite an attractive bouquet. After adding the water the brew started bubbling quite a bit, so all seemed in order.  A few hours later I could finally have a little taste of the brew as there were enough liquids to actually do so..  okay.. the stuff tasted sour.. not really like a vinegar, more acidic-ish.. (I lack proper expertise to characterise the taste better)\n\nSome details of my process that may have caused the sourness: (?) \n\n1. I used more Sato powder (fungus*yeast) than stated in the recipe. I crushed one ball to powder but ended up using about 30/40% more as I felt the amount I should add looked ludicrously minimal compared to the amount of sweet rice.\n\n2. I do not own a rice steamer and cooked my rice. It may have been a tad over cooked.. not mushy tho!\n\n3. I did, as per the traditional recipe, wash the steamed rice to loosen the grains. Again here, I did not completely let the grains dry. Strained them and added to the jar. Rice was far from dripping wet, but certainly also not dry. \n\n4. During the dry stage (first 6-7 days) I cracked the lid a few times to smell the brew. (Check for foul smell) I did notice a slight turn to a yellowish color of the rice in the jar that had me worried. The smell was fantastic so, worries gone.. but did I introduce acetic bacteria? The stuff that has wines spoil to vinegar??\n\n5. At the start I did however thoroughly clean containers l, even with rubbing alcohol to decontaminate as much as possible. (Which seemed as waaa\u00e1y over doing it as a friend of mine in Thailand is doing the same recipy in the middle of the jungle with quite poor sanitation.. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f???\n\n6. Temperature?? In Thailand the brew is done around 30-40 celcius during day time.. so the fungus/yeast combo operates at quite high temps i guess.. much higher as the 20 celcius ish where Doburoku is preferably is brewed at.. here in Portugal in my place its been early spring and quite cold. I kept my room to about 22ish with a heater. The jars were in front of the window, so may have been a bit colder even. At coldest times I moved the jars a bit closer to the heater as I feared a stalled process (remember ambient temps in Thailand are waaa\u00e1y higher during the brew process)..\n\nSo, all in all, theres been quite some guesswork and loosy loosy approach.. I admit. But it seemed a recipy that allowed for much looseness?? I'm about to just give it another go.. got more Sato balls and lots of time on my hands. Just wondering what I should take from this try and learn, improve and or avoid.\n\nAny souls out there willing to chime in?

{"title": "Finished primary ferment on ginger brew", "selftext": "This is my second try and using a ginger bug. First one I made a hibiscus ginger soda with and it turned out great. This time I mostly followed a recipe except that I decided to split the fermentation up into 2 stages.\n\nThe mix in the big jar (distilled water, 1 cup sugar, 60g ginger grated and boiled, half cup ginger bug) is about 40 hours old and was starting to show some carbonation. I tasted it and it still had some sugar but I wanted to add more to jumpstart the secondary ferment and leave the final product a bit sweeter. On the right is 1/4 cup of sugar dissolved in the juice of 3.5 meyer lemons. Interestingly when I added the juice/sugar to the main mix it immediately fizzed up noticeably. Any idea why?? It\u2019s hard to imagine the yeast metabolizing the free sugars in a matter of seconds, but I can\u2019t make sense of why this would happen chemically either. The solution should be slightly acidic already, right? Or does dissolved co2 make it basic?\n\nOn the left is something experimental I\u2019m actually really excited about. I carefully poured off the main mixture before adding the juice/sugar so I could collect the sediment rich liquid at the bottom. I\u2019m gonna let it settle again and harvest/dehydrate the sediment which I believe is essentially fermented ginger starch mixed with a bit of yeast/labs sediment.

That said, I'm open to feedback, as I could be overlooking something that makes this less effective.\n\n# The Idea:\n\nThe goal is to give Oats Based Protective Matrix(via Biogaia Baby drops) a better chance to survive gastric acid and reach the small intestine in higher numbers, where it seems to work its magic.\n\n# My Protocol:\n\n* Step 1: Eat a small to normal meal first This helps naturally buffer stomach acid (raises pH temporarily). I include gut-friendly foods like oats, chia seeds, bananas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and pumpkin seeds for fiber and prebiotic effects.\n* Step 2: Mid-meal (or about 2/3 of the way through), I take:\n   * 1 tablespoon of raw rolled oats (dry) with 10 drops of L. reuteri drops dripped directly onto the oats.\n   * Let it sit for 5\u201310 minutes to soak in (which it does very effectively).\n   * Drizzle 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) over the oats.\n   * \u26a0\ufe0f Be mindful that many EVOO brands are not truly pure EVOO. I recommend finding one that has been lab tested \u2014 there are plenty of websites and YouTube videos helping identify authentic EVOO depending on where you live.\n* Optional: Add a pinch of inulin powder or other resistant starch like green bananas for extra prebiotics.\n* Step 3: Swallow the soaked oats without too much chewing. The goal is to let the oats and EVOO act as a \"natural capsule\" to help L. reuteri pass through the stomach more intact.\n\n# Why I\u2019m Trying This:\n\n* EVOO slows gastric emptying and may protect the bacteria.\n* Oats and fiber could act as both a vehicle and a prebiotic which in the 37 degree Celsius of the small intestine is a great place to ferment day after day.\n* Mid-meal timing takes advantage of naturally buffered stomach conditions.\n\n# Plan:\n\nI\u2019ll be sticking to this daily (or twice daily) and plan to report back over the next few weeks to share:\n\n* Any noticeable effects (gut health, mood, sleep, etc.)\n* Any tweaks I make along the way\n\n# Questions:\n\n* Has anyone else tried something similar?\n* Any suggestions to refine this further?\n* Would love to hear from anyone who\u2019s done other \u201cDIY\u201d delivery methods for L. reuteri\n* Am I going against the already proven Yogurt method with my method already proven ineffective?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts, and I hope to create a bit of a log here as I go!\n\nThis is what my \"Oats Based Protective Matrix\" looked like when ready to be eaten.  Was an easy one bite swallow.  I hope the majority of the L. reuteri makes it way through my stomach acid.

I've read various posts here and watched a few YouTube videos (Alton Brown's Good Eats pickles episode [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4SKZ9BF2c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl4SKZ9BF2c) and Brad from Bon Appetit's pickles [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6XWXj9l8Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD6XWXj9l8Q) ).

I currently use an electric mixer it was giving me better results than just stirring with a spoon. \n\nIf i don't have access to organic ginger, is it better to peel the skin or soak it in a cup of water mixed with baking soda?

I tried to make gingerale from that ginger bug and after 15 days of it sitting room temp, it refuses to carbonate, and now I realize it's probably because the bug wasn't active enough. \n\nThis brings me to my first question, \u2022is it safe to drink that ginger ale after it sitting out for so long?\u2022 I took a tiny sip and it tasted pretty good and I know some fermentation happened because its not nearly as sweet as it was when I first bottled it and has a bit of a twang to the mouth feel. Hopefully I dont get sick\ud83d\ude2c\n\nThat first gingerbug I made, I ended up having to toss because after my soda didn't work out, I took it out of the fridge and tried to re-vamp my bug, I fed it ginger and sugar and then covered the jar with a paper towel per advice of some online article(BIG mistake). I woke up the next morning to mold on all the ginger that was floating on top. Now I'm making my second ginger bug(pictured) and this time I put it in a Fido jar with the gasket taken off, to avoid any possible mold or bacteria getting in. The same thing is happening as the first, bubbles on day 2/3 and then nothing. I fed it 2 tsp of ginger/sugar for 2 days, skipped day 3, fed again day 4 and the bubbles disappeared. It is now day 7 for this bug and Im not sure how to proceed. What am I doing wrong? Could it be the temperature in my house? I live in PA and its been a bit chilly, my thermostat is set to 68\u00b0 F.Everytime I feed and stir, I can hear crackling, so what gives?? Any advice would be appreciated because I really want this to work out! Can this current ginger bug be saved?\n\nShould note, yes I did use organic ginger with the skin on, organic sugar and spring water. Frustrated with how many differing opinions and directions there are, that all seem to conflict..one person says you \"shouldn't cover it with a lid, it needs oxygen.\" Another says \"no! It needs to be sealed!\" No 2 recipes are alike and it drives me crazy because Idk who to listen to.

{"title": "Tried making cultured butter", "selftext": "I fermented the cream over night with a spoonful of yoghurt, and it turned quite sour. But after churning it tastes just like any other butter if I\u2019m honest (Though the buttermilk was excellent) I\u2019m wondering what else to try. I saw on YouTube a company described their cultured butter process, and after a night of fermenting they \u201caged the cream for 3-4 weeks before churning\u201d. I\u2019m tempted to try this, but not sure at what temperature they would age it. Would it be fridge temperature or room temperature?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/bde5fyy5hgre1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1743178672.0, "score": 34, "author": "jerryhmw", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fermentation/comments/1jlyv50/tried_making_cultured_butter/", "html_title": ""}
