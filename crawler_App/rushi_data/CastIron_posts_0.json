I have a Lodge and other cookwares, this is not my only pan.\n\nFor those who were still confused and asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d - I clearly stated in my last post that it\u2019s for fun, and it\u2019s for \u201cscience\u201d. Have you guys never done something just to see how far it will get or how it will turn out? Come on, try it.\n\nSo can we just get back to the \u201cscience\u201d now? Lol. Ok, so here\u2019s something I\u2019d like to share/discuss:\n\nI\u2019ve found that there are four main factors that affect your seasoning: Temperature, duration, thickness of the layer of oil applied, and the characteristics/composition of the oil used.\n\nWe can discuss the science behind cast iron seasoning another time if you want, but right now, I want to talk about the thickness of the layer of oil. As we know, the general consensus is that the layer has to be **very** thin. Folks here are super religious about *getting all of the oil off* before putting it in the oven. But I don\u2019t think you need to use the whole roll of paper towel and wipe like your life depends on it. The trick is to apply oil and wipe off excess when the pan is **hot**. Oil is a lot less viscous when hot so it\u2019s a lot easier to put on a thin layer. What I do is I warm up the pan to about 300F. Then use a folded paper towel and dab just a little bit of oil on there, then use it to wipe the entire pan. Make sure to cover the whole surface. It should look wet/shiny. Then use a clean dry paper towel to wipe the whole thing off. It should look matte (I\u2019m talking about pans that haven\u2019t had many coats yet. Obviously, my pan is too shiny to look matte now). Then in the oven it goes. 450F for an hour (for crisco).\n\nFor next time, (if my pan can get to 25 coats) I\u2019ll fry an egg in it. I know I originally said I\u2019m not cooking in it at all.

We'll try to repost the FAQ every 6 months or so to continue any discussion if there is any. As always, this is a living document and can/should be updated with new information, so let us know if you see anything you disagree with! Original FAQ post here:* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/5d3bmc/my\\_personal\\_seasoning\\_process/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/5d3bmc/my_personal_seasoning_process/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm making this post mostly so that I can link back to it as this comes up a lot.  This is my personal seasoning process and it works for me.  There are many others out there and feel free to use them, but if you're asking what I do, this is what I do, and I feel it's the easiest process and works very well, even for newbies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOil of choice - Crisco.  Okay, I'm already lying, I actually use Crisbee because the addition of the beeswax makes application a bit easier when you're seasoning a couple hundred pieces a year (I do a bit of selling on the side.)  But unless you're really into it, have a lot of pieces, or just want to try it and see if it works for you, Crisco is the main oil in Crisbee and is the most important part.  If this is your first Cast Iron pan, just use Crisco.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis process is assuming you're starting with a piece of bare iron.  You've already stripped the old seasoning off either through lye (lye tank, yellow cap oven cleaner, etc), Electrolysis, vinegar scrubs, or magic voodoo.  Stripping can be a different topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Process:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1. Wash and scrub your pan with soap and water.\n* 2. Dry thoroughly with a towel.\n* 3. Immediately place in a 200 degree oven for 20 mins\n* 4. Take out (using gloves) and coat with liberal amount of Crisco.  Use an old t-shirt, towel you don't care about, or something like that.\n* 5. \\*\\*Most Important\\*\\* - try to wipe out ALL of the oil.  Use a different t-shirt or towel.  I do a two step wipe, the first with a towel, the second with a paper blue Shop Towel.  You won't be able to get it all and there's enough left on the pan for the seasoning.\n* 6. Return to oven and heat to 300.  Once it's 300, take out and wipe down again.  \\*\\*Note\\*\\* I don't actually do this step anymore, but I recommend it to newbies or people having problems with their own process.  It helps make sure all of the excess oil is removed.\n* 7. Return to oven and heat to 450\n* 8. Bake for an hour\n* 9. Let cool in oven (completely if you're finished and have time.  You can go to 200 if you're going to do another round of seasoning and are in a rush)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRepeat process starting at step 3.  Before starting second coat, check your pan.  If you see any spots on it, that means you didn't do step 5 very well, and I would scrub it down again starting at step 1, but if it looks good I go right to 3.  Do this 2 or 3 times and you'll get a well seasoned pan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter seasoning your pan may look any color from brown, to dark grey, to black.  Use and cooking fatty foods and time will eventually turn your pan that deep dark black you're looking for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood Luck!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/c4nqtr/my_personal_seasoning_process_faq_post_summer_2019/", "created_utc": 1561382506.0, "score": 1453, "author": "_Silent_Bob_", "num_comments": 317, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/c4nqtr/my_personal_seasoning_process_faq_post_summer_2019/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Grandma recently passed and left a very old cast iron skillet. What do I do with it?", "selftext": "Hello!\n\nMy grandma recently passed, and we were looking through some of her boxes and we came across this cast iron skillet. My dad remembered that my grandparents bought it at an auction when he was a kid. He doesn\u2019t remember seeing it ever being used, so it\u2019s likely that this skillet hasn\u2019t been used in 40 years. \n\nI did some researching online, and it seems to be from the late 1890s or so, but I\u2019m not exactly sure how old or what type of model it is. The back of the skillet also has some wear and tear that has made it difficult to tell exactly. \n\nSo my main question is what should I do with this skillet. I do like to cook and it would be nice to have a cast iron to cook with, but I don\u2019t want to cause any damage to the skillet, and I\u2019m also not sure if it would need to be stripped and seasoned again. Depending on the lighting, parts of the inside of the skillet look slightly reddish, but I can\u2019t exactly tell if this is rust. \n\nAny input or advice would be greatly appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14kq1yj", "created_utc": 1687901126.0, "score": 1404, "author": "Spynxx", "num_comments": 391, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/14kq1yj/grandma_recently_passed_and_left_a_very_old_cast/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

If you're using a gas oven it may be worthwhile to open oven door by about an inch for 5 minutes after bake time elapses to release any residual moisture        \n- Repeat         \n         \nI'm sure there is negligible difference on long-term seasoning whether or not you use convection; however, I'm a fan (lol get it) because the heat is evenly circulated which can prevent temperature fluctuations and further reduces humidity.

{"title": "Cast iron griddle on cast iron grill?", "selftext": "I've got an older offset smoker I use as a grill (because I got a newer better offset), just by putting the coals in the main cook chamber. The grill has nice cast-iron grates. [pretty close to this one, but i think an older model](https://www.chargriller.com/products/smokin-champ)\n\nRecently I got a big Lodge reversible cast iron griddle to use to make smashburgers and stuff, [this one.](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/collections/griddles-grill-pans-grill-presses/products/double-play-reversible-grill-griddle) I would use it inside, but we have a glass-top electric stove and very bad ventilation. Every time I use my cast iron pans, the house smells of it for a few days. So I tried to use the griddle on the grill outside; some cursory web searching said it would be fine.\n\nNow, I think the cook went fine; good temperature on the griddle, the coals I set lasted a good while and kept it hot, and the foot turned out great. The trouble was after I removed the griddle (no mean feat; 9.5lb of ripping hot cast iron is extremely hard to pick up with grill gloves; i waited until it cooled down), the cast iron grill grates under it were rusty!\n\nI do have some rust problems with these grates in general, and there's one whole section of it I don't cook on because it's due for a cleaning. The grate segments don't fit in my sink so it's a big ordeal to clean them. I have some questions for this group:\n\n* Why did the grill grates *rust* of all things? I didn't use water on the griddle itself (it's solid anyways), and the bottom of the griddle seemed fine. It was just stuff on the part of the grates that the griddle was resting on.\n\n* What's the easiest way to clean rust off of big grill grates that are hard to move and won't fit in my sink? I feel like I *had* a pretty good seasoning on those, and I would hate to ruin it with just one cook\n\n* How *should* I cook with this griddle on the grill?

I don't use it everyday, but definitely a few times a week. \n\nFirst off, people aren't joking about getting seasoning to stick being difficult as hell. I was babying this pan at first, constantly doing oven and stove top seasoning and it just wouldn't stay. \n\nFinally it got down to almost bare metal on the inside (outside seasoning is holding up just fine).. \n\nI was frustrated a bit, and also electricity costs are really expensive where I'm at so I decided I was done seasoning it and just going to cook and make sure it never stays wet. \n\nTo my suprise, once all of the factory seasoning was off.. My own seasoning started to build, and rather quickly at that. \n\nWhat I realise is that their factory seasoning is honestly terrible, gorgeous, but terrible. \n\nAs far as cooking, it works great, cooks like a cast iron. Retains heat, nothing sticks, easy to clean etc. \n\nI do like the style of the pan a lot, I love supporting small businesses doing cool things, worth is subjective. I don't really think the pan is worth what I paid overall, but in the grand scheme of life it's not that much for something that will outlive me. \n\nIs it better than a lodge? Slightly. Is it better than the vintage pans I grew up with? No, but its about equal. \n\nHowever vintage CI goes for big bucks these days if you can't find it cheap somewhere so in that case, Smithey might be an okay deal. \n\nUltimately, I don't think the quality of a pan can be judged by its factory seasoning, but I do think for the cost of it they should figure out a way to bake it on better. \n\nI never have had a lodge seasoning not stick the way this is. \n\nI don't think I'll buy another Smithey, but I don't regret this one either.

{"title": "Just got A Lodge 12\"", "selftext": "I've recently received a brand new 12 inch Cast Iron Skillet from the Lodge brand and I figured I'd poke around and ask some questions that I have about use and maintenance.\n\nFirstly, I know Lodge pre-seasons, but I've also been recommend to re-season it after it arrives. I primarily use Avocado oil as my high smoke point oil of choice so I'm wondering if that would be okay to use or if I would be better off using something like vegetable or Canola oil for any and all reseasonings? Also, how light should I go with the oil coating? I've gotten conflicting answers in my research ranging from it being a light but noticable layer of shine to try my best to get every last drop of oil off before putting it through the oven. \n\nMy current game plan for post cook care is to give it a wipe down with a paper towel and salt (if needed), and then a light scrub with hot, soapy water. Once that's done and dryed off, I plan on storing it in my oven. I've heard salt is a good way to absorb and remove stuck food particles without doing damage to the seasoning, how true is this? I'm pretty sure storing it in the oven is okay, but should I remove it when using the oven for other things, or is it okay to sit in there while I use the other racks?\n\nOn the subject of oven use, could I use the cast iron as a pseudo baking dish? I know people often make things like pies and such, but I mean using it more for things like oven baked chicken or getting a steak up to temp before a final sear on the stove top. Logically, I would assume that the bottom of the pan would cook the surface of the object faster than the top would, so I plan on using a wire rack to suspend things off of the surface, but I'd like to ask if that's even needed.\n\nIn terms of what to cook in the pan, I'm pretty sure the only thing holding me back is my imagination. But I'm aware that one of the draws to cooking with cast iron pans is the subtle cary over of flavor from previous dishes. I don't think i'd want a pie to taste like steak and eggs, or vice versa, so how noticeable is this and would I be better off buying a separate pan to having a \"sweet\" pan and \"savory\" pan, or would a light wash remove the flavor essence of the last meal?\n\nLastly, any random tips or meal recommendations to give to a novice cook?

{"title": "Question about chipped enamel", "selftext": "Someone else made a post where they shared a pic of their Dutch oven's chipped enamel. I didn't want to hijack their post, but it reminded me of something I've been intending to ask here for months. \n\nA couple Christmases ago, I got a Dutch oven, and I had it for about 3 weeks before someone in my household dropped it on a concrete floor. It dented the handle, and chipped the enable off of it. Said person also repeatedly used a metal spatula, as well as one of those chain link scrubbers, sometimes used for normal cast iron, on the inside and chipped the enamel there as well. Said person also insists on using it for storage, and scrubbed it with liquid Cascade dish detergent,  that has somehow damaged the outside of pot. In either case, the damage isn't bad. It's just a little pitting, but it's enough that it has me worried that it could get worse, or that rust could form under the enamel. I was really bummed out because I was so looking forward to having that. They've also done a number on my cast iron skillet, cause each time they use it, I end up having to redo the seasoning. Which, while annoying, isn't the biggest of my worries. \n\nThe Dutch oven isn't a Lecrueset, before anyone mentions. As much as I'd love one. I almost found one in a place like TJ Maxx, but they knew exactly what it was, cause it was only like, $20 cheaper than off Lecrueset's website. It's a Cuisinart, that was suggested by America's Test Kitchen. So, my first question would be, is there a place that can redo the enamel? Even if currently  the damage isn't much, but further down the road, are there places I can look for to take it to? \n\nThe other thing I'd like to know is, what's the feeling towards metal utensils, like spatulas? I've seen a lot of posting of them lately, and I've been nervous about them. It causes some fights between myself and my family each holiday.  Namely, I try to avoid using them because they tend to scrape my seasoning, or enamel. Any reccomensations? \n\nI'll admit I treat these kinda gingerly, but it's because I've had nice sets in the past, that have gotten ruined by being mistreated. I'd really like to treat these well.

{"title": "Lodge Cast Iron Seasoning - Back Then Vs Now", "selftext": "I consider myself a seasoned (no pun intended or maybe so) veteran of cooking with cast iron. Grew up as a child with cooking with some cast iron. \n\nDecades ago, I purchased Lodge pre-seasoned cast iron, and had no problems - had quite a number of pieces including several size skillets, Dutch Ovens, and shallow round griddles.  In fact, I was even keeping a few 10 inchers and using them regularly so I could gift each of my sons with one when they became adults.\n\nI never had problems. \n\nBut due to an unexpected move to Europe, I had to give up some things and gave them all away.\n\nI really missed them, but was really happy to discover Lodge was sold in Greece (you don't want to know the price... but I splurged anyway because I really wanted to be using them again). \n\nI swear the Lodge seasoning is nowhere near the same as the seasoning on my cast iron that I purchased many years ago. I see other folk purchasing new Lodge, and read about their issues, and really makes me wonder if their methods/seasoning materials have degraded at some point in the past. \n\nFirst, it doesn't \"seem right..\" I know Lodge always had a surface that was not totally smooth to begin with, but this stuff is even worse... and indeed, it is flaky!  For example, I have a Dutch Oven that I have never tried to \"re-season\" - and all I've done with it is bake bread in it, and roast some chickens. \n\nYet the original Lodge seasoning is just flaking away on the bottom. And I can see how the Lodge seasoning seems to be too thick and just not done well at all. Cleaning with some water and a nylon brush causes the original Lodge seasoning to flake away.\n\nI can deal with it; I'll just have to strip off this stuff and re-season myself, but am wondering if anyone else has noticed a difference in what they may have purchased many years ago, compared to what people are getting today? \n\nOr maybe Lodge is sending off their \"seconds\" to foreign places? I don't think what I have is fake... but I suppose that could be a possibility.\n\nI mention the Dutch Oven, but I'm finding similar with the skillets/pans  I purchased as well, although not to the same degree.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/1jzweiy/lodge_cast_iron_seasoning_back_then_vs_now/", "created_utc": 1744734854.0, "score": 0, "author": "Scottopolous", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/1jzweiy/lodge_cast_iron_seasoning_back_then_vs_now/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Strange outline from cooked food on pan that is resistant to cleaning.", "selftext": "Hey folks,  \n  \nLong time lurker, first time poster here. I've learned a lot about caring for my cast iron pan from reading other posts here but I've come across a phenomenon that I haven't seen posted before but am curious about.  \n  \nI stripped this pan a few months ago because it had a lot of carbon build up stemming from the myth of not using soap on CI. I have reseasoned it according to the general wisdom of this sub and for the most part it performs well- at least much better than it had been.  \n  \nNow when I cook bacon in the oven, or sear something like salmon or steak, it leaves a weird little outline on the pan. The attached picture is from two small pieces of bacon this morning AFTER I then sauteed some vegetables, then made an omlette, then cleaned the pan\\*. I can scrub the shit out of it with chain mail, or soap and water and it doesn't budget. The surface is slick and smooth to the touch so it doesn't appear to be stuck food. I generally am able to \"remove\" it by putting a small drop of oil on the pan and rubbing it in but I've read that this shouldn't have to be done every time the pan is used.   \n  \nYes, yes- just cook with. And I do. This isn't affecting my cooking. But it appears to be continually happening and I'm curious what is causing it and if I could be doing something differently to make my pan perform and look a little more like some of the amazing looking ones posted here.  \n  \nThanks everyone for your time.  \n  \n\\*Just for context- when I'm done cooking with it I get the burned bits off with a metal spatula while it's still hot. Sometimes I'll drop a little water in there put it on a low boil if there is something stubborn like egg residue. Then once it has cooled enough to touch I scrub any surface remnants with chain mail and then scrub it down with soap and water. Once the surface appears free of any debris I heat it in the oven to dry it. Sometimes if it's looking thirsty I'll put the smallest drop of avocado oil on it and wipe it until it's basically all wiped away.  \n  \n  \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/f48yv7ek6hue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744495171.0, "score": 0, "author": "Simultaneity", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/1jxsjid/strange_outline_from_cooked_food_on_pan_that_is/", "html_title": ""}

If you're using a gas oven it may be worthwhile to open oven door by about an inch for 5 minutes after bake time elapses to release any residual moisture        \n- Repeat         \n         \nI'm sure there is negligible difference on long-term seasoning whether or not you use convection; however, I'm a fan (lol get it) because the heat is evenly circulated which can prevent temperature fluctuations and further reduces humidity.

I'll keep including photos of the pan's bottom, no OF subscription required, but let me know if there's any other angles you guys would like to see      \n     \nNext update after I hit 5 coats, which l'l likely get done today.

I\u2019ve been trying to embrace cast iron cooking, but a few recurring issues are making me hesitant to use my pans. Would love some guidance from this community!\n\n**1. Stubborn food residue \u2013 how do you tackle it?**  \nLately, my pans have become a magnet for stuck-on food (even after preheating and oiling). What\u2019s your go-to method for removing residue *without* damaging the seasoning? I\u2019ve heard conflicting advice about scrubbing vs. soaking, so I\u2019m curious what works best.\n\n**2. Cleaning after stews/sauces \u2013 water worries?**  \nI love cooking stews, but cleaning up afterward stresses me out. I\u2019ve avoided water because I\u2019m paranoid about ruining the seasoning. Is it safe to rinse the pan with water? If so, do i need to re-season again??\n\n**3. Lingering fish smells/flavors \u2013 how to reset the pan?**  \nMy dad cooks fish frequently, and now the pan seems to impart a subtle fishy taste to other dishes (even after washing). Any tips for neutralizing strong odors or flavors?\n\n**4. Storage \u2013 oiling and wrapping?**  \nI know oiling before storage is key, but do I need to wrap the pan in paper or cloth to protect it? Or is it better to leave it uncovered in a dry space?

{"title": "Lodge Wok Mod", "selftext": "I sanded smooth the sear zone, washed, and heavily seasoned. The pan was still factory seasoned.

Around a dozen layers of seasoning were applied on the stovetop to the wok sear zone. Then 5 layers were applied to the entire pan in a 400\u00b0F oven using around 75 minutes per layer.

{"title": "Cast iron griddle on cast iron grill?", "selftext": "I've got an older offset smoker I use as a grill (because I got a newer better offset), just by putting the coals in the main cook chamber. The grill has nice cast-iron grates. [pretty close to this one, but i think an older model](https://www.chargriller.com/products/smokin-champ)\n\nRecently I got a big Lodge reversible cast iron griddle to use to make smashburgers and stuff, [this one.](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/collections/griddles-grill-pans-grill-presses/products/double-play-reversible-grill-griddle) I would use it inside, but we have a glass-top electric stove and very bad ventilation. Every time I use my cast iron pans, the house smells of it for a few days. So I tried to use the griddle on the grill outside; some cursory web searching said it would be fine.\n\nNow, I think the cook went fine; good temperature on the griddle, the coals I set lasted a good while and kept it hot, and the foot turned out great. The trouble was after I removed the griddle (no mean feat; 9.5lb of ripping hot cast iron is extremely hard to pick up with grill gloves; i waited until it cooled down), the cast iron grill grates under it were rusty!\n\nI do have some rust problems with these grates in general, and there's one whole section of it I don't cook on because it's due for a cleaning. The grate segments don't fit in my sink so it's a big ordeal to clean them. I have some questions for this group:\n\n* Why did the grill grates *rust* of all things? I didn't use water on the griddle itself (it's solid anyways), and the bottom of the griddle seemed fine. It was just stuff on the part of the grates that the griddle was resting on.\n\n* What's the easiest way to clean rust off of big grill grates that are hard to move and won't fit in my sink? I feel like I *had* a pretty good seasoning on those, and I would hate to ruin it with just one cook\n\n* How *should* I cook with this griddle on the grill? Charcoal doesn't give me a lot of control over the heat except by raising and lowering the coal basket below.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/1ka4k4r/cast_iron_griddle_on_cast_iron_grill/", "created_utc": 1745869267.0, "score": 1, "author": "macrovore", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/1ka4k4r/cast_iron_griddle_on_cast_iron_grill/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Cast Iron Grill and light pieces of meat.", "selftext": "I love the taste of my cast iron. I have a lodge grill pan, the rectangular one. For juicy stakes it is doing fine. Great actually.\n\nBut I'm having trouble with smaller pieces of meat. Like chicken wings, sausages, lamb chops. Probably  the contact surface area of food with the pan is less than half (due to the ridges), the pieces of meat that are light in weight do not cook well and in a reasonable time. The other day I cooked some wings and some of them were pink inside, because the outside appearance was perfectly done and removed them. And I love so much chicken wings.\n\nIf I keep a long and slow temperature, the food will take ages to cook and eventually dry up. If I have high heat the opposite. It will burn on the outside and be uncooked on the inside. I am cooking chicken wings in my air-fryer as well and the bone just falls off. \n\nDo you have a similar experience? What do you suggest I do?  \nI was thinking of buying a glass lid, or a press, or another cast iron pan to use it as a press as well (since the glass lid is almost the prices of a pan). Will the weight remove moisture? Will the glass lid do a good job?   \n\n\nOf course I could also get a new pan (flat) and cook them in that pan with fat, that will act as a heat transfer medium. But I'd rather not spend any money for the time being. \n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear your suggestions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/1ka30rx/cast_iron_grill_and_light_pieces_of_meat/", "created_utc": 1745865465.0, "score": 0, "author": "Equivalent-System-75", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/1ka30rx/cast_iron_grill_and_light_pieces_of_meat/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

First I soaked it in an inch of vinegar to remove any rust and scrubbed the life out of the pan to get it to the base silver look. I had a lot of trouble with the sides so I just left them as they were smooth with no rust or pitting. I dried it, wiped it out with avocado oil 3 times then baked it at 500\u00b0. After the first seasoning cool down I took it out and the sides had flaked and the seasoning was all spotty on the bottom. The photo was taken after I tried to rescrub it today and just put a coat of olive oil in it to prevent it from rusting while I figure out my next move.

{"title": "Just got A Lodge 12\"", "selftext": "I've recently received a brand new 12 inch Cast Iron Skillet from the Lodge brand and I figured I'd poke around and ask some questions that I have about use and maintenance.\n\nFirstly, I know Lodge pre-seasons, but I've also been recommend to re-season it after it arrives. I primarily use Avocado oil as my high smoke point oil of choice so I'm wondering if that would be okay to use or if I would be better off using something like vegetable or Canola oil for any and all reseasonings? Also, how light should I go with the oil coating? I've gotten conflicting answers in my research ranging from it being a light but noticable layer of shine to try my best to get every last drop of oil off before putting it through the oven. \n\nMy current game plan for post cook care is to give it a wipe down with a paper towel and salt (if needed), and then a light scrub with hot, soapy water. Once that's done and dryed off, I plan on storing it in my oven. I've heard salt is a good way to absorb and remove stuck food particles without doing damage to the seasoning, how true is this? I'm pretty sure storing it in the oven is okay, but should I remove it when using the oven for other things, or is it okay to sit in there while I use the other racks?\n\nOn the subject of oven use, could I use the cast iron as a pseudo baking dish? I know people often make things like pies and such, but I mean using it more for things like oven baked chicken or getting a steak up to temp before a final sear on the stove top. Logically, I would assume that the bottom of the pan would cook the surface of the object faster than the top would, so I plan on using a wire rack to suspend things off of the surface, but I'd like to ask if that's even needed.\n\nIn terms of what to cook in the pan, I'm pretty sure the only thing holding me back is my imagination. But I'm aware that one of the draws to cooking with cast iron pans is the subtle cary over of flavor from previous dishes. I don't think i'd want a pie to taste like steak and eggs, or vice versa, so how noticeable is this and would I be better off buying a separate pan to having a \"sweet\" pan and \"savory\" pan, or would a light wash remove the flavor essence of the last meal?\n\nLastly, any random tips or meal recommendations to give to a novice cook?

I don't use it everyday, but definitely a few times a week. \n\nFirst off, people aren't joking about getting seasoning to stick being difficult as hell. I was babying this pan at first, constantly doing oven and stove top seasoning and it just wouldn't stay. \n\nFinally it got down to almost bare metal on the inside (outside seasoning is holding up just fine).. \n\nI was frustrated a bit, and also electricity costs are really expensive where I'm at so I decided I was done seasoning it and just going to cook and make sure it never stays wet. \n\nTo my suprise, once all of the factory seasoning was off.. My own seasoning started to build, and rather quickly at that. \n\nWhat I realise is that their factory seasoning is honestly terrible, gorgeous, but terrible. \n\nAs far as cooking, it works great, cooks like a cast iron. Retains heat, nothing sticks, easy to clean etc. \n\nI do like the style of the pan a lot, I love supporting small businesses doing cool things, worth is subjective. I don't really think the pan is worth what I paid overall, but in the grand scheme of life it's not that much for something that will outlive me. \n\nIs it better than a lodge? Slightly. Is it better than the vintage pans I grew up with? No, but its about equal. \n\nHowever vintage CI goes for big bucks these days if you can't find it cheap somewhere so in that case, Smithey might be an okay deal. \n\nUltimately, I don't think the quality of a pan can be judged by its factory seasoning, but I do think for the cost of it they should figure out a way to bake it on better. \n\nI never have had a lodge seasoning not stick the way this is. \n\nI don't think I'll buy another Smithey, but I don't regret this one either.

{"title": "Question about chipped enamel", "selftext": "Someone else made a post where they shared a pic of their Dutch oven's chipped enamel. I didn't want to hijack their post, but it reminded me of something I've been intending to ask here for months. \n\nA couple Christmases ago, I got a Dutch oven, and I had it for about 3 weeks before someone in my household dropped it on a concrete floor. It dented the handle, and chipped the enable off of it. Said person also repeatedly used a metal spatula, as well as one of those chain link scrubbers, sometimes used for normal cast iron, on the inside and chipped the enamel there as well. Said person also insists on using it for storage, and scrubbed it with liquid Cascade dish detergent,  that has somehow damaged the outside of pot. In either case, the damage isn't bad. It's just a little pitting, but it's enough that it has me worried that it could get worse, or that rust could form under the enamel. I was really bummed out because I was so looking forward to having that. They've also done a number on my cast iron skillet, cause each time they use it, I end up having to redo the seasoning. Which, while annoying, isn't the biggest of my worries. \n\nThe Dutch oven isn't a Lecrueset, before anyone mentions. As much as I'd love one. I almost found one in a place like TJ Maxx, but they knew exactly what it was, cause it was only like, $20 cheaper than off Lecrueset's website. It's a Cuisinart, that was suggested by America's Test Kitchen. So, my first question would be, is there a place that can redo the enamel? Even if currently  the damage isn't much, but further down the road, are there places I can look for to take it to? \n\nThe other thing I'd like to know is, what's the feeling towards metal utensils, like spatulas? I've seen a lot of posting of them lately, and I've been nervous about them. It causes some fights between myself and my family each holiday.  Namely, I try to avoid using them because they tend to scrape my seasoning, or enamel. Any reccomensations? \n\nI'll admit I treat these kinda gingerly, but it's because I've had nice sets in the past, that have gotten ruined by being mistreated. I'd really like to treat these well. Not to mention when I re season the skillet it's like a full day of oil pan, put pan in 475 degree oven, remove pan, and hang on hook too cool, re apply oil, and repeat this three, or four times.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/1k1rd3q/question_about_chipped_enamel/", "created_utc": 1744934049.0, "score": 6, "author": "Olympic_Salad_Tosser", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/1k1rd3q/question_about_chipped_enamel/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Lodge Cast Iron Seasoning - Back Then Vs Now", "selftext": "I consider myself a seasoned (no pun intended or maybe so) veteran of cooking with cast iron. Grew up as a child with cooking with some cast iron. \n\nDecades ago, I purchased Lodge pre-seasoned cast iron, and had no problems - had quite a number of pieces including several size skillets, Dutch Ovens, and shallow round griddles.  In fact, I was even keeping a few 10 inchers and using them regularly so I could gift each of my sons with one when they became adults.\n\nI never had problems. \n\nBut due to an unexpected move to Europe, I had to give up some things and gave them all away.\n\nI really missed them, but was really happy to discover Lodge was sold in Greece (you don't want to know the price... but I splurged anyway because I really wanted to be using them again). \n\nI swear the Lodge seasoning is nowhere near the same as the seasoning on my cast iron that I purchased many years ago. I see other folk purchasing new Lodge, and read about their issues, and really makes me wonder if their methods/seasoning materials have degraded at some point in the past. \n\nFirst, it doesn't \"seem right..\" I know Lodge always had a surface that was not totally smooth to begin with, but this stuff is even worse... and indeed, it is flaky!  For example, I have a Dutch Oven that I have never tried to \"re-season\" - and all I've done with it is bake bread in it, and roast some chickens. \n\nYet the original Lodge seasoning is just flaking away on the bottom. And I can see how the Lodge seasoning seems to be too thick and just not done well at all. Cleaning with some water and a nylon brush causes the original Lodge seasoning to flake away.\n\nI can deal with it; I'll just have to strip off this stuff and re-season myself, but am wondering if anyone else has noticed a difference in what they may have purchased many years ago, compared to what people are getting today? \n\nOr maybe Lodge is sending off their \"seconds\" to foreign places? I don't think what I have is fake... but I suppose that could be a possibility.\n\nI mention the Dutch Oven, but I'm finding similar with the skillets/pans  I purchased as well, although not to the same degree.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/castiron/comments/1jzweiy/lodge_cast_iron_seasoning_back_then_vs_now/", "created_utc": 1744734854.0, "score": 0, "author": "Scottopolous", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/1jzweiy/lodge_cast_iron_seasoning_back_then_vs_now/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Strange outline from cooked food on pan that is resistant to cleaning.", "selftext": "Hey folks,  \n  \nLong time lurker, first time poster here. I've learned a lot about caring for my cast iron pan from reading other posts here but I've come across a phenomenon that I haven't seen posted before but am curious about.  \n  \nI stripped this pan a few months ago because it had a lot of carbon build up stemming from the myth of not using soap on CI. I have reseasoned it according to the general wisdom of this sub and for the most part it performs well- at least much better than it had been.  \n  \nNow when I cook bacon in the oven, or sear something like salmon or steak, it leaves a weird little outline on the pan. The attached picture is from two small pieces of bacon this morning AFTER I then sauteed some vegetables, then made an omlette, then cleaned the pan\\*. I can scrub the shit out of it with chain mail, or soap and water and it doesn't budget. The surface is slick and smooth to the touch so it doesn't appear to be stuck food. I generally am able to \"remove\" it by putting a small drop of oil on the pan and rubbing it in but I've read that this shouldn't have to be done every time the pan is used.   \n  \nYes, yes- just cook with. And I do. This isn't affecting my cooking. But it appears to be continually happening and I'm curious what is causing it and if I could be doing something differently to make my pan perform and look a little more like some of the amazing looking ones posted here.  \n  \nThanks everyone for your time.  \n  \n\\*Just for context- when I'm done cooking with it I get the burned bits off with a metal spatula while it's still hot. Sometimes I'll drop a little water in there put it on a low boil if there is something stubborn like egg residue. Then once it has cooled enough to touch I scrub any surface remnants with chain mail and then scrub it down with soap and water. Once the surface appears free of any debris I heat it in the oven to dry it. Sometimes if it's looking thirsty I'll put the smallest drop of avocado oil on it and wipe it until it's basically all wiped away.  \n  \n  \n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/f48yv7ek6hue1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1744495171.0, "score": 0, "author": "Simultaneity", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/castiron/comments/1jxsjid/strange_outline_from_cooked_food_on_pan_that_is/", "html_title": ""}

Which now seems like it was unnecessary and explains the splotching and extra smoke I have been experiencing. \n\nI read all the advice here, and a bunch of other websites before settling on Sunflower Oil for my seasoning of choice. I followed the [Field Companies](https://fieldcompany.com/pages/how-to-season-cast-iron-pan-skillet) instructions for temp warm up, process, and time. I ended up setting the high heat at 470\\* to get above the smoke point. I did 3 coats and came out with a wonderful bronze colored pile of cast iron!

Went bad, but that's on me for using too high heat and not paying attention.

WATCH IT!\n\nIt was fake ground beef, by the way, given for free, or I wouldn't have eaten it. (No, it's not \"gifted\". \"Gifted\" is a made up word. There's \"Gift\". And there's \"Given\".) I'm a carnivore. But I made it. Then scrambled eggs on top. Besides not using enough butter, it was a skillet I didn't restore and didn't season, the seasoning was done poorly and my first time using it. The iron was thinner than I'm used to, being pre-war (unknown unmarked deep heat ring) and the eggs stuck pretty good. \n\nWHILE THE IRON WAS STILL HOT FROM THE FOOD! And the burner was still on, with only time enough to throw some sour cream and chipotle cremosa on my ground queef & egg$, I performed this little magic trick, using ALL THE CHAIN MAIL I WILL EVER NEED on a cast iron skillet ever.\n\nAt 2 minutes this video is self-explanatory. (I'm sorry for the eating. Sour cream and Chipotle Cremosa is fucking delicious, I don't care what's under it, and I don't like my food getting cold.) At any rate. Now you know the answer. Chain mail scrubbers are not necessary. Don't get me wrong. Only a proud man condemns a thing so blindly without giving it a solid and open-minded trial first. I did. A decade ago at this point. It's not pride but confidence after such a trial and the success of the water \"deglazing\" method that informs me, and therefore the rest of this sub, that there is no need, and never has been, for something so silly as chainmail on cast iron. A caveat maybe: not in daily usage, anyway. But if one is trying to remove years of carbon, just strip the thing with lye already.\n\nAnd now you also have the much-awaited answers to the best chain mail scrubbers and where to buy them: None, Nowhere.\n\nMy therapist says I have anger issues.
