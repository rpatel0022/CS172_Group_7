When I was at the Post, he replied ASAP, so that I\u2019d ship my packages. He was always prompt to reply up to this point. \n\n- August 25, 2024: Keep in mind he was supposedly going to ship his packages out on the 23rd. I figured he might be busy so I gave him a couple days grace but it was starting to give me a weird feeling. \n\n- August 26/September 3/September 16: Follow-up messages I sent. I\u2019m still in disbelief that someone, especially a father (looking at his scant Post history) would scam someone over something as niche and friendly as snacks. He of course has not replied to me since. \n\nI also contacted a previous member of this sub who he apparently had said \u201cthe trade fell through\u201d in a previous post but this member said that he never replied when she was asking about items, so she eventually just left it. I guess he figured he can\u2019t scam her. \n\nTL;DR: My first time trying this out and in my haste and excitement I shipped out 3 packages that cost me almost $200 total with only vague promises from the other person and was completely scammed. Someone who had allegedly successfully done trades before. Honestly I don\u2019t know if it was some sort of elaborate scam using multiple accounts or what. \n\nIt\u2019s not an insignificant amount, that\u2019s for sure - I had saved up some to be able to do this and figured that hey, since he had done this before, I could go big and it would be a payoff.

She was bleeding profusely. Gushing. So much blood. I got the attention of a gentleman nearby, thankfully he had paper towels in his truck and we were able to cover her gash as I called for an ambulance. She was responsive, quietly insisting that she was fine and she only had a bloody nose (the chunk of flesh on the ground next to her begged to differ).

If you look at her comment history you can see her frequenting similar subs trying to get free food (she's a regular on RandomActsofPizza for example) and it just pisses me off.\n\nThe weirdest part is that during our initial messages to each other, she actually told me a whole bunch about her and sent me some links to her singing videos (it wasn't as weird as it sounds, I needed the snacks from her for a video project I was working on so we kind of 'traded' content). After she stopped replying I actually was able to really easily find her facebook profile based off the videos she sent me, which is even more infuriating that I'm unable to get a word out of her despite knowing how to reach her on multiple platforms.\n\nWhat kind of person gives someone this much personal info and then stops replying?! So weird.\n\nMods, please ban this scam artist for good this time, and if you're reading this /u/originalcupcake, stop being such a dick.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your support everyone, I want to apologise if I insinuated in any way that this was the mods' fault, as they're clearly blameless after more info has been uncovered.

I put a huge amount of effort into this exchange. Saving up souvenir items from my office to add to his package, messaging the user to check the type of chocolate he likes, I even put off sending the package so I could include some special items from Hokkaido after I took a trip up there. Up until the exchange itself, initiated by a reply to a post I made, we exchanged 10 or so messages detailing preferences/requests etc. To make the package personal, and as the user presents himself as a British expat living in NZ, I even sent a handwritten note, recommending nice places to visit in a wonderful country.\n\nThe user received my package around 2 months ago, and has not posted a word of thanks or any other notification that he has received it. Despite this, he continues to post on reddit. I find this particularly disappointing, I don\u2019t just take part in these exchanges to get a heap of snacks, but in the hope I can spread a little joy to someone too. I feel doubly deprived. I\u2019ve since reached out to this user, saying that it would be reasonable to at least thank me for the package he received, to which I have not received any reply. I can\u2019t even get an AK, because this Immanuel Kant is too self absorbed in this deviousness to even post a quick message of gratitude. \n\nI came onto snack exchange because I know how crazy reddit seems to be about JP snacks. Seems like half the posts here are demands for exotic kit kats.  Despite the love-in Japan usually gets on reddit, I have to say I\u2019ve not really had the best of times living here. I was really desperate to get a bit of comfort food to distract me from the overbearing work hours and stress of life here.  I admit that I was foolish and overly optimistic. The user said my package was on it\u2019s way. I could see he was a previous successful secret santa participant. I took this notification as enough to send my goods in the other direction.\n\nu/defonotahorse - I\u2019ll be passing on your address to the mods of this subreddit, as well as the mods of secret santa et al to ensure you don\u2019t get away this bullshit again. I rest assured that karma will take an enormous bite out of you when the time is right. People like you take things of beauty of positivity and turn them into piles of ash. And for what? A few bits of chocolate for yourself, and misery and disappointment for someone on the other side of the world.

{"title": "I was scammed, my first exchange :(", "selftext": "EDIT: Woah, this got a lot bigger than I thought it would. Thanks to everybody who showed their support, and everyone who offered to send some free snacks my way. It\u2019s really appreciated. You guys have convinced me not to give up on exchanging! In the world we live in today, with so much hate, violence, etc. it has been pretty mind-blowing reading all of the positive comments. Restored some of my faith in humanity for sure. Much love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAlright, this is going to be a long one. *Please upvote so others can see this, and avoid this situation themselves.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was scammed. This was my first exchange on r/snackexchange, and the user who scammed me said this was their first exchange too. I wasn\u2019t aware what AK\u2019s were, and this user didn\u2019t have one. I\u2019ll be providing our messages as proof throughout this, and will censor ANY personal information about myself and the other user for legal reasons. If this is too long for you, there is a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSo, it started three months ago with this post:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/33qlug1qvwv21.png\n\n*(All images from here on will be on Imgur, as putting them in the actual post makes it too cluttered - I recommend that you read all of them, as it will make everything much easier to follow and understand)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI proceeded to message the user. Everything was going well. You can read our initial messages here: [https://imgur.com/a/KxtaMVB](https://imgur.com/a/KxtaMVB). As seen in the messages in the link, we talked back and fourth, decided the main things we wanted in our exchange, and then I shipped out my portion, and assumed they shipped theirs the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext (later on), I asked them whether or not they received the snacks yet, they said no. ([https://imgur.com/a/l1U4H3o](https://imgur.com/a/l1U4H3o))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days later, they sent me a message telling me that they had forgotten to put the country on the shipping label, so it was returned and they had re-shipped it. I was understanding of this, and didn't think anything of it at the time. I also asked them whether or not they received my snacks, and they **confirmed** that they did. ([https://imgur.com/a/489rhah](https://imgur.com/a/489rhah))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI followed up (a few days later at the most) asking them how they liked everything. This is even more proof that they received the snacks that I sent out. ([https://imgur.com/a/IrRoh2g](https://imgur.com/a/IrRoh2g)) - The package included all dressed chips and maple cream cookies (among other snacks), and they specifically confirmed that they liked the chips, disliked the cookies. The cookies weren't previously mentioned, so this even further confirms that they were received as they would've had no prior knowledge that I included them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDays later (I can't be sure of the exact timing, because it's only telling me general info like \"1 month ago\", etc) I told them I still hadn't received the package. I was thinking that it may have gotten lost in transit, when I suggested this, the user agreed and said they'd purchase everything again, and send it out with an express service that includes a tracking number. I still wasn't really worried at this point. ([https://imgur.com/a/M7zV5uC](https://imgur.com/a/M7zV5uC))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey told me they'd ship it Friday, but Friday passed and I hadn't heard anything, so I sent another message and they told me it'd be shipped on Tuesday. ([https://imgur.com/a/M7zV5uC](https://imgur.com/a/M7zV5uC))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTuesday night, I sent a message asking them if they shipped it. They told me they did ship it, and it should arrive in 6 days. ([https://imgur.com/a/gSjzSCv](https://imgur.com/a/gSjzSCv))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDays later, I asked them to send me the tracking number. This is where the alarm bells started to go off. They told me that the package was stopped by customs, and returned to them with a free postage stamp, and a list of what to remove. The tracking number wasn't sent to me. I then asked for the tracking number again, and my request was ignored again. I also asked what needed to be removed, and they told me \"no idea!\", however just a few messages earlier, they told me that customs had sent them a list of what to remove. ([https://imgur.com/a/kjafmFS](https://imgur.com/a/kjafmFS))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few more days later, I asked them if they got it shipped back out. Didn't receive a response for a couple days, so messaged again. They then told me 3 days later that the parcel had been marked as delivered. They also mentioned that the exchanges they did with Australia at the same time had been received. Keep that in mind, as it is fairly important and I'll come back to it a bit later. ([https://imgur.com/a/q3Hdb0B](https://imgur.com/a/q3Hdb0B))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had been **extremely polite and understanding** the whole time, but I re-read messages, and finally I had to tell them my POV of what was going on. They then told me that they were launching out on a cruise, and would buy snacks and send them when they got back. I again was extremely polite. ([https://imgur.com/a/9KVFgnb](https://imgur.com/a/9KVFgnb))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn entire 18 days later, I had still heard and received nothing, so I sent another message, and then another. I told them that I felt I was scammed, and I finally received a response. They told me that this wasn't a very high concern to them. They finally told me that they were going to ship \"again\" the day after they sent this message (although I'm confident they ever tried to ship in the first place) and asked what I wanted. I told them the same as what I wanted originally. *I suggest you read the messages from here on if you haven't been reading them so far.* ([https://imgur.com/a/YAUN9De](https://imgur.com/a/YAUN9De))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFour days later (today at the time of writing this post) I asked if they had shipped it, like they said they would. They just flat-out told me \"nah\", and starting giving extremely non-descriptive, rude replies. ([https://imgur.com/a/nCqeM5N](https://imgur.com/a/nCqeM5N)). I told them that I wasn't sure if I should even be expecting anything from them anymore. They repeated the issues that they had with shipping, and I once again told them that they provided absolutely NO proof of any of them actually happening. I have no way of knowing that anything was ever sent to me. ([https://imgur.com/a/eqJT26Y](https://imgur.com/a/eqJT26Y))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey seem to think that they don't need to provide any proof, saying that I provided no proof of shipping mine. However, they told me that they received what I sent, so me giving any proof would be pointless (plus the shipping method I used did not include a tracking number). They said that they'll message me if/when they ship \"another box\". They said that they have no proof that I never received the other one(s), because of these supposed \"Delivered\" messages (that I don't think exist) and I told them to send me the tracking number so that I can see any delivered message for myself. In response to this, they sent me an emoji. That's the last I heard. ([https://imgur.com/a/3tcwHzn](https://imgur.com/a/3tcwHzn) \\- *important, if reading any messages, these are the ones*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing back to the message about the people in Australia receiving their packages, I came across a post on their account saying the opposite. This pointing towards even more false information, you can see it here: [https://imgur.com/a/RsP78yc](https://imgur.com/a/RsP78yc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe I've provided all the proof necessary that I've been scammed, and I don't believe that customs stopped the package, nor do I believe there are any \"delivered messages\" that exist. Canadian customs aren't very strict, and I couldn't see any reason that they'd stop any harmless snacks. I'm pretty sure that CBSA sends a letter to the receiver informing them of their decision to reject the parcel and return it to the sender, but I never received one. On top of this, the user's refusal to send me the tracking number is enough proof by itself (in my opinion anyway).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Overall, I'm extremely disappointed that I didn't get anything in return, was really excited to have Funyuns again :(. Working for your money and then having something like this happen is not a good feeling, and I think many can relate. I'm still open to this being resolved.** \n\n*I apologize if anything was worded badly, it's late and I'm extremely tired and have been writing this for over an hour, but I felt this post was necessary.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - A user from the US wanted to trade with someone from Canada. I am from Canada, sent a message to user. We discussed, and I shipped my snacks to them. They supposedly shipped theirs too, but I haven't gotten anything (it's been about three months). They confirmed that they received the snacks I sent them. Excuses like customs issues and forgetting to write the country name were given to me by the user. They provided no proof that they ever shipped the snacks (ignores when I ask for the tracking number).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/bk4ns8/i_was_scammed_my_first_exchange/", "created_utc": 1556859882.0, "score": 275, "author": "TorontoReps", "num_comments": 84, "permalink": "/r/snackexchange/comments/bk4ns8/i_was_scammed_my_first_exchange/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "[Meta] We're all popular now. Here's everything you need to know about the subreddit and trading safely in it.", "selftext": "Ohai. \n\nSo last month our traffic spiked around five times what it normally is and this month we're already halfway to our normal traffic one week in. This is mostly good- more people means more countries, more exchanges. It also means that we need to go over safe trading and what is/isn't allowed in the subreddit again, and to revisit those guidelines and see if they're still in the right.\n\n**What is SnackExchange?**  \n\nWe trade boxes of local foods. \n\n**How much does it cost?**\n\nGenerally you're looking at around 50-100 USD in total for international trades. The normal value of snacks is around 20-30 USD and shipping can get ridiculous. \n\n**But that isn't cheap?**\n\nWe're more about the experience of two people sharing a major part of their daily lives. It's probably cheaper to buy foreign crisps off amazon, but a snackexchange is a curated slice of someone else's world. \n\n**But strangers will poison me!**\n\nWe've been here for over seven years and the maxim \"don't take candy from a stranger\" has never been an issue. Don't eat anything that isn't in its original package and make sure those packages are intact (apart from the box being thrown around by the courier).  \n\n**But what if they scam me?**\n\nSnackExchange uses the AK-47 flair to verify successful traders (may not show up on mobile?) and Automoderator removes any comment posted by a user with less than **600 link/comment karma and 3 months on the website**. While scamming is an issue anytime there's money involved, they're rare here and almost always originate from an account that doesn't meet our rules or hasn't traded before. ***Be weary of PMs, check out the user's page before trading with them, keep communication open with them during the trade.*** \n\n**But I don't have an AK-47! I'm not a scammer!**\n\nIf you're trading for the first time, I recommend trading with someone who has already been verified. To establish goodwill, it's customary to send your package first and provide that user some sort of tracking number.\n\n**I wanted snacks from <place> but nobody responded. Do you have any users from there?**\n\nPretty much every country, if not province/city, has its own subreddit. Try crossposting your thread to /r/<wherever> and get more exposure while bringing more of those users here. Most of our userbase right now is from North America, Europe, and Asia. \n\n**Do I need to use my real name/address?**\n\nObviously it's a bad idea to do this if you post in controversial subreddits or have some other privacy concern with your main account, and we don't allow throwaways because they don't meet our posting criteria. However, I've sent several boxes using a translated version of my username and a work or friend's address. \n\n**What if customs intercepts the package?**\n\nShipping foods can be tricky. Make sure the receiving country's customs agency allows everything inside before sending. Trouble items include perishable foods, fresh fruits/vegetables/plants, and drugs/supplements/things you probably aren't shipping anyway. Sometimes customs will hold a package for up to several weeks (or even months), which just happens. Fill out your customs declaration form accurately. \n\n**How do I format my post?**\n\nWe ask that you include your location and what you're looking for. \n\n**Is there a really big guide to trading safely it but it's like five years old?**\n\n[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/q73dc/the_guide_to_successful_trading/)\n\n**What about those posts from companies? /r/Hailcorporate raid!**\n\nWe ban any unsolicited marketing or PR stuff. However I don't think it's fair to redditors with small businesses if we lump them in with \"LOL I DRANK A PEPSI AND STARTED A REVOLUTION. 2MEIRL4MEIRL\", so we allow them to make a coupon that we feature on the sidebar and a post as long as they approach us beforehand. We don't have any part in their business and don't get any kickbacks/affiliate bonuses/[paper money for grambling at the crashino.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNpIxi20tmA)\n\n**I'm under 18. Can I do this?**\n\nWe've never had a problem with kids posting here, but make sure your parents are cool with it first. \n\n-----\n\nWe've been at this for the better part of a decade and it's been a really neat experiment in civility.

We were thinking about going to a paw paw festival a few states away but shes been going through a lot of physical problems which means she will probably need surgery before we do any trips together. \nI texted my mom every day to find out if she got them and finally she reported back that she got it, opened it, and already ate some of the paw paws. She was so surprised and excited to see them that she started crying! She described them as banana-ey, 'clouds from paradise' and they taste better than anything else in the world. She even said she could die happy now.  This was so great to get her to try this fruit.

I sent mine, and she promised mine was en route even saying she had to take some canned stuff out and rearrange.

Projects like the Universal Scammer List and Automoderator have been essential if we're to do an unpaid job that gets worse the better you do it. That's to say nothing of the apps which make the website usable and accessible for the disabled, with reddit's programmers being so bad that I still don't use the stylesheet redesign. \n\nIf reddit wants to price-gouge those things to inflate their value before their IPO launch, it's at our expense. The mods running the subreddit and the users providing its content, the people who generate the only value this website has. API calls are an essential function for the website to remain in the sorry state it's in to begin with, and what comes next will be even worse. \n\nTo me that's bullshit and it makes clear sense to withhold all of our labour with the subreddit strike on 12 June. The only argument I can think of which would make it a unique thing here is that we're based off verification posts. The strike would interrupt those and people might forget to post them when it ends. But the tool which enabled that entire system to happen was originally an external one that presumably called the API, so even there it's just basic self-preservation. \n\nI wanted to run it by the users and other mods to see if there are any objections to it. If not the subreddit will be shutting down from at least 12-14 June. If the demands aren't met then it will be until they are.\n\nedit: **So far the community response is pretty unanimous.

I tracked my package and saw that it arrived on Aug 22, but he never acknowledged it, and I never received anything in return. I gave it about a week and then sent him a message. And then a week later another one. No response. The mods have messaged him too and have gotten no response, despite the fact that he's been active on Reddit. Bummer for him; he's had his user name a long time and has lot of karma, but I'll be posting to r/badkarma as well as r/hardwareswap and r/secretsanta (where he's been involved as well) to stay away from this creep, and he'll be added to the universal scammer list too.

I was selected to go to a conference later this year in Phoenix, Arizona, but sadly when then date got confirmed it clashes with a friend's wedding and I can no longer go. It was supposed to be my first time going to America, and I was excited to see the hole in a rock (I'm a geologist and already started looking at things to do there!). \n\nTo cheer me up, I was hoping to do an exchange with someone in Phoenix or wider Arizona. The majority of my snack exchanges have been with the US. I'd be keen for any unique snacks or brands local to the area so I can pretend I actually went, but am open to general snacks. \n\nTypically I like gummy sweets, cheese based crisps/chips, and fruit flavours (particularly grape as we don't get that here). Dr Pepper is my favourite drink but can only access regular flavour and occasionally cherry or vanilla float in an American shop.\n\nI'd be looking at exchange around 2-4 kg (about 4-8lbs) and around \u00a330 in value, depending on what you are able to exchange (I'm well aware shipping costs will be far more expensive US to UK than UK to US). Please factor in your shipping costs before agreeing to the exchange - I have had people let me down before when they'd agreed to exchange but then changed their mind after seeing shipping costs.\n\nCurrently in the UK we have a lot of Easter chocolate in the shops. I'm in southwest England and we have a lot of local producers and snacks round this way. Popular items I've sent before have been Cadburys chocolate, Walkers crisps, local cheese cracker/bread sticks, marmite flavours, Ribena, wine gums and cakes.

It's fine if I list 'Lays' in item description but if I say 'Lays Potato Chips' then it's bad.\n\nFor the ramen, it's fine as long as I don't list the brand. When I add in Samyang for the item brand, it thinks it's a frozen item. Which I find weird, cuz I'm sending another type of instant ramen in my package and that passed just fine.

I would create an online spreadsheet with the addresses (only viewable for participating users who will get the link via DM after commenting here).\n\nSo how is that an advent calender? Well in the end everyone would have gotten 24 sweets or snacks in total. The idea would be that everyone wraps up their snacks before sending them so they stay a surprise even after opening the parcels. When they arrive, you can collect them all in a basket and come Dec 1 you start opening a random one every day. \n\nI know shipping/customs will be a bit expensive and it is a bit of work but I think it will be a unique experience for everyone! Also a lot of the more \u2018special\u2019 advent calendars are over 100-150\u20ac so I think it would be worth it! We can try to fit them in the smallest package available to save costs.\n\nA few guidelines I thought of to make it more doable:\n\n-\tPlease do not participate if you have food allergies or strict dietary restrictions \u2013 I know it sucks to exclude people but I think it would make it a lot more complicated if everyone has to think about too many special requires.\n\n-\tTry to pick sweets or snacks that are truly from your region to ensure a good variety in the calendar (e.g. Haribo should only be sent from a german person even though it is also popular in Austria)\n\n-\tAim to keep rather small \u2013 like one chocolate-bar or a \u2018fun-size\u2019 bag of chips e.g. \u2013 not only will that save costs but also ensure that the contents of the calendar are about the same worth\n\n-\tInternational shipping can take a while so I think we should aim in sending all packages by the end of October, first week of November at the latest.\n\n\n\nIf you want to participate \u2013 comment your country/region under this post and I will send you a DM.\n\nI am so giddy to make it happen!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/1fyteao/request_from_all_over_to_everywhere_communal/", "created_utc": 1728368924.0, "score": 22, "author": "KathyKiwi812", "num_comments": 36, "permalink": "/r/snackexchange/comments/1fyteao/request_from_all_over_to_everywhere_communal/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Timeline:\n\n- August 17, 2024: User posted, and seeing that he allegedly had 2 successful trades, I felt confident in agreeing to a \u20ac50 =$75 CAD value trade. \n\n-August 22, 2024: I shipped my part out, it cost me over $100 CAD via our national carrier Canada Post due to the ~6kg weight. \n\ndutchiewutchie kept saying that he\u2019d ship the next day. When I was at the Post, he replied ASAP, so that I\u2019d ship my packages. He was always prompt to reply up to this point. \n\n- August 25, 2024: Keep in mind he was supposedly going to ship his packages out on the 23rd. I figured he might be busy so I gave him a couple days grace but it was starting to give me a weird feeling. \n\n- August 26/September 3/September 16: Follow-up messages I sent. I\u2019m still in disbelief that someone, especially a father (looking at his scant Post history) would scam someone over something as niche and friendly as snacks. He of course has not replied to me since. \n\nI also contacted a previous member of this sub who he apparently had said \u201cthe trade fell through\u201d in a previous post but this member said that he never replied when she was asking about items, so she eventually just left it. I guess he figured he can\u2019t scam her. \n\nTL;DR: My first time trying this out and in my haste and excitement I shipped out 3 packages that cost me almost $200 total with only vague promises from the other person and was completely scammed. Someone who had allegedly successfully done trades before. Honestly I don\u2019t know if it was some sort of elaborate scam using multiple accounts or what. \n\nIt\u2019s not an insignificant amount, that\u2019s for sure - I had saved up some to be able to do this and figured that hey, since he had done this before, I could go big and it would be a payoff.

Even though its only mid-september I had an idea and was wondering if it could be possible.\n\nSo a few years ago I bought an adventcalender with sweets from 'around the world'...it was super dissapointing. It was rather expensive but ended up being more than 80% rather boring european snacks from countries around me. \n\nI was super excited when I found this community so now I am wondering - do you think we could pull off a sort of communal Advent calender? \n\nI have a few ideas how we could do it - we would need 25 people, preferably all from different countries (or at least regions with their special sweets/snacks). Then everyone who wants to participate would send me a dm and I would give them the link to a spreadsheet where they write their country, name and adress. Everyone would pick one famous snack from their country and send 24 of them to the 24 other people. \n\nI know shipping/customs is expensive, but I think if we say only something the size of a chocolate bar or small snack and not too expensive so you could send it in a small package - maybe even letter format and that keeps the costs down. And I think would be a really special experience! \n\nSo let me know what your thoughts are! Do you think it's possible? Would you be interested in that sort of thing? Do you have ideas how to make it easier/doable? \n\nIf there are enough positive comments then I would make an extra request post to get it started.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/snackexchange/comments/1fgqir3/discussion_advent_calender_from_around_the_world/", "created_utc": 1726332659.0, "score": 14, "author": "KathyKiwi812", "num_comments": 41, "permalink": "/r/snackexchange/comments/1fgqir3/discussion_advent_calender_from_around_the_world/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I realize these aren't shelf stable and am more than willing to accept that risk when shipping. The first time I ordered, 2 of the 12 sent had mold, the other 10 were more than edible and tasted as good as they did the first time. That said I'm only looking to request 5-6 of them this time as they proved difficult to find. My only other request would be Meji Coca-Cola gummies, outside of that, I'd be happy with any kinds of Kit-Kats, Hi-Chews or even some of your favorite treats/snacks so that I can share the taste of Japan with family and friends My budget is $50 not including shipping and I'm happy to send specific items or work with you to figure out what you like most and put together a bundle.

I would create an online spreadsheet with the addresses (only viewable for participating users who will get the link via DM after commenting here).\n\nSo how is that an advent calender? Well in the end everyone would have gotten 24 sweets or snacks in total. The idea would be that everyone wraps up their snacks before sending them so they stay a surprise even after opening the parcels. When they arrive, you can collect them all in a basket and come Dec 1 you start opening a random one every day. \n\nI know shipping/customs will be a bit expensive and it is a bit of work but I think it will be a unique experience for everyone!

Honestly I don\u2019t know if it was some sort of elaborate scam using multiple accounts or what. \n\nIt\u2019s not an insignificant amount, that\u2019s for sure - I had saved up some to be able to do this and figured that hey, since he had done this before, I could go big and it would be a payoff. Never been to the Netherlands. But now I just don\u2019t know what to do.

Then everyone who wants to participate would send me a dm and I would give them the link to a spreadsheet where they write their country, name and adress. Everyone would pick one famous snack from their country and send 24 of them to the 24 other people. \n\nI know shipping/customs is expensive, but I think if we say only something the size of a chocolate bar or small snack and not too expensive so you could send it in a small package - maybe even letter format and that keeps the costs down.
