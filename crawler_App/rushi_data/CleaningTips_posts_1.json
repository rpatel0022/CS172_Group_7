{"title": "What you should expect from a professional carpet cleaner", "selftext": "TL;DR \nit hurts my heart seeing before and after pictures of carpet cleaning by \u201cpros\u201d who suck and give me a bad name. Below is what goes through my mind and is discussed when I\u2019m doing what I do for a living.\nTL;DR\n\nYesterday I saw a post someone had issues with \u201cpros\u201d cleaning their carpets with some awesome before, after and 24 hours later pics. I commented that nothing about the performance would seem them as professional in my opinion. Lo and behold I walk into my first stop today and it looks like a similar issue. I figured I could post my process here so you all don\u2019t keep getting taken by these garbage companies.\n\n1st pic - my client had work done and the worker tracked grease onto her carpet (new since covid). She tried to remove it with OTC spot cleaner. Half of that crap can bleach out your carpet (unlikely in this case because the fiber is polyester) most of it will leave a soapy residue. She said spots came back and she only used \u201cclean water\u201d. \n\nI tested the spots with clean water from the sink. Take a few drops, put it in the center of the spot and rub it with a gloved finger. If it cleans up, or soaps up, it\u2019s a residue issue. Bonus points if you smell it and it smells like flowers r citrus. Sure enough it did \u201cclean up\u201d with just water.\n\nI informed the client of her options.\n\nOption 1 - I could treat the spots with a topical powdered defoamer and then treat the whole room and clean it as normal for my normal price but if any of the soap has gotten into the pad she may see some of the spots return in a few months. I could come back and do a deeper the of those at that time (which is more time consuming and more expensive)\n\nOption 2 - I could just do the expensive treatment on every spot and then I would happily guarantee the full removal of the spots and that should they return, I would come back for free and hit them again\n\nI recommended the first option, let\u2019s see if we even need to spend all this time and her money on this. I\u2019m going to try my best to fix it the first way without costing her too much money. I want happy clients that call me back, not ones I only clean for once.\n\nPic 2 - I applied the powdered defoamer to each spot, worked it in.\n\nPic 3 - I treated all the areas with my cleaning product. It\u2019s called {redacted possibly breaks rule 1}. I don\u2019t sell it but you can find it on Amazon. It\u2019s green, odorless, residue free and works great. After I applied that I work the carpet with a matching commonly called a Counter Rotating Brush Machine, more specifically it\u2019s called a {redacted possibly breaks rule 1}.\n\nPic 4 - is the final pic after I cleaned the carpet using a truck mounted cleaning machine. I stretch in tubes and hoses not a rolling machine you can rent from the local hardware place. My rig is less than a year old and set me back $125,000. Notice the nice \u201cV\u201d pattern under the table? I brushed the carpet after I was done. This restores the fiber pile allowing it to dry evenly. So many goobers out there skip this simple step and leave these hard lines in the carpet.\n\nHopefully this is not seen as self promotion, I just hated seeing what someone accepted as a good job when, to a trained eye, it was sub standard work at best. You all deserve better. \n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not perfect, but I will be calling this client tomorrow to make sure those spots stayed gone and dried up nicely. If not, I will be back out there fixing the problem, not making excuses to not come back.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6189a", "created_utc": 1729198623.0, "score": 10751, "author": "programedtobelieve", "num_comments": 104, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1g6189a/what_you_should_expect_from_a_professional_carpet/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One of the best cleaning tips I\u2019ve learned for depression and ADHD", "selftext": "I suffer from pretty severe executive dysfunction caused by ADHD and depression. This causes me to have a constant mental block when it comes to cleaning: I.e., I KNOW I need to do the thing, I know that I\u2019ll feel better once it\u2019s done, but I can\u2019t get myself to do it. Why? Because I feel ashamed.\n\nI was talking with a friend who\u2019s a professional cleaner, and asked her \u201cwhy is it that I can never clean my house the way that professionals do\u201d and she said one of the most profound (and probably obvious) things I\u2019ve heard.\n\nProfessional cleaners do such a thorough job cleaning because they have absolutely no emotional attachment to your house. When they see a mess on the counters, dishes piled up, dust all over the furniture, dirt on the baseboards, they don\u2019t think \u201cgod, I am such a disgusting slob for letting it go this far. How do I live like this?\u201d instead, they simply acknowledge there is a mess and then clean the mess. \nThe reason why it\u2019s so hard for me, and for so many others, is because a lot of us feel an enormous amount of shame surrounding our home. Every time I cleaned, I would beat myself up over it. Which then, gave me no motivation to clean because I didn\u2019t like the way I felt. There was no dopamine rush when I feel an emotional attachment to it. \n\nNow when I clean, I literally try and pretend I\u2019m a professional maid in someone else\u2019s house helping them clean. I see a mess, acknowledge that it\u2019s a mess, then clean it. Basically just gaslighting myself until the timer goes off and I\u2019ve conquered at least some of the mess. It\u2019s been a work in progress, and it has not happened over night but this has seriously improved my attitude around cleaning in general. I feel a lot less shame and sadness around it.\n\nI know this probably sounds dumb or obvious, but hoping this can help another neurodivergent redditor with bad executive dysfunction.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1f26t45/one_of_the_best_cleaning_tips_ive_learned_for/", "created_utc": 1724727340.0, "score": 9990, "author": "actuallychill", "num_comments": 410, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1f26t45/one_of_the_best_cleaning_tips_ive_learned_for/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I went down a rabbit hole on cleaning chemistry and this blew my mind", "selftext": "Soap is wild when you think about it. You lather it on, and somehow dirt, oil, even bacteria just vanish?\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I thought. Until I learned what\u2019s actually happening.\n\nThey *slide away*.\n\nThere\u2019s this thing in all good cleaners called a surfactant (short for \u201csurface active agent\u201d), and it\u2019s the reason that happens. One end grabs onto water, the other end grabs onto grease or grime. When they float around together, they trap all that mess in little bubbles (called micelles), and then water just rinses it away.\n\nNo scrubbing magic. No \u201cpoof.\u201d It\u2019s gone. Just chemistry making the surface slippery enough that the gunk lets go.\n\nNot all cleaners work like this, though. Some are made to kill germs (like disinfectants), or dissolve minerals (like acidic descalers). But surfactants? They\u2019re not killing or dissolving anything. They\u2019re just making it all slippery, so the mess lets go, and water does the rest.\n\nAlso: not all surfactants are the same. The stuff in your dish soap isn\u2019t the same as what\u2019s in your glass cleaner. I started reading labels and realized how many products I use because of these little chemical slip-agents, helping grease and grime lose their grip.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m fascinated. **Anyone else weirdly into this stuff? Or have a favorite surfactant that works way better than it should?**\n\nEdit to add: A few folks pointed out that surfactants can kill some bacteria and viruses, not only just make things slippery. \n\nI looked it up and yep, soap disrupts the lipid layer around certain viruses (like Covid), basically breaking them open, killing them, and then water rinses them away.\n\nMy husband reminded me that Alton Brown talked about this during early Covid and I\u2019d completely forgotten. Appreciate the extra learning here!\n\nEdit to add: \nWe hit a *million* views.\n\nWhat started with simple surfactants turned into a sage lesson in lye, water becoming better at being water, and a full-on Magic School Bus revival.\n\nJust because we \u201clearned it already\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we geeked out properly the first time around. Sometimes we just need the right chemistry for things to really stick.\n\nWhen Reddit said \u201ccleaning tips,\u201d you gave proof that even in a thread about soap, people are still hungry to think, connect, and marvel.\n\nThanks for showing that curiosity still has a seat at the table.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "created_utc": 1746264834.0, "score": 6782, "author": "asleep-under-eiffel", "num_comments": 545, "permalink": "/r/CleaningTips/comments/1kdp2jv/i_went_down_a_rabbit_hole_on_cleaning_chemistry/", "html_title": ""}

The wine had been sitting for hours, but I tried to rinse whatever I could. Then I followed the directions for the one stain remover I could get at the corner shop\u2014Dr Beckmann Stain Devil Fruit & Drinks. It has red wine pictured & listed on the front of the bottle.\n\nIt said to dilute the contents in warm water, and then soak items for several hours. I soaked the most soiled one for about two hours, as well as the damaged laces and my socks. I could hardly believe it when I checked on them about an hour and a half later.\n\nFor good measure & the sake of balance, I put everything including the spared shoe in for a little bit longer.

Etc. Etc.\n\nThe entire point of a tips reddit is to come for advice, help and expertise regarding the topic of the reddit. You will not see people posting in here things like \"How do I wipe my sink down when I pour coffee down the drain?\" \"How do I dust this small particle of dust that accumulated over 3 days on my bookshelf\"\n\nYou are going to see difficult and/or extreme cases of dirt, grime, mould, gunk and ick. That is why they've come to ask for help because the task is a lot larger or more involved than soap and water. \n\nUsually these cleaning jobs result from some challenges the person, their family or their friends are facing that have led them to that level of dirt. If you are able to wave a magic wand and give the person with the dirty space a perfectly healthy body, mind, health care, endless money, supportive relationships, time outside of work and all the little privileges that people take for granted - then you can make unhelpful comments. \n\nThe difference I think no one usually considers when leaving a judgemental, unhelpful comment on a cleaning post is this : this person is asking for your help. They understand there is a problem and they have come to you to ask for your help in remedying it. \n\nThey are not saying \"Omg look how yummy this black mould is! I'm so PROUD that I have a dog urine stain in my carpet. Look at how delicious and gross this space is, isn't it amazing!\" \n\nNo. They are saying, directly or indirectly, \"I have a problem I'd like help fixing, please.\"\n\nThey don't need to justify that help with \"My mother is severely mentally disabled and did not have the ability to clean this bathroom\" or \"I am too poor to replace this kitchen counter, I need a best case solution if that's possible or I won't have electricity this month.\"\n\nHave fun. Have a laugh. Everyone can have a good sense of humor and a chuckle online. But comments that are not supportive but are judgemental and irreverent are just mean. There are SO many spaces on Reddit and the internet to poke fun at others without them seeing it - take that energy there. \n\nLet's just aim to be a little kinder this year than we were last year.

I also HATE cleaning, I never find it fulfilling or cathartic and it\u2019s so overwhelming. \n\nIf you feel similarly, here\u2019s how I did it:\n\n1. Do NOT expect to do it all in one day! Accept & get comfortable with the idea it could take you a few days of chipping away. \n\n2. Get the floor clear first. Throw trash away, put clothes in a laundry basket (or 3), anything you need to find a home for put in a bin or on your bed temporarily. \n\n3. If you find yourself losing steam, do NOT give in immediately. Take care of one more large task (ie. Put folded clothes away, take out the trash, organize your desk) and THEN put a pin it. \n\n4. Anytime you leave the room, start a task and leave it half done. That way, when you return, you have no choice but to finish it. \n\n5. There is NO one definition of \u2018clean\u2019 - what\u2019s clean to me is certainly not clean to my mother.

Start with the smallest task, take care of it, and keep going with the momentum. It\u2019s ok if you need a break.
