{"title": "The unfortunate truth about Top Secret Recipes. The future of this sub.", "selftext": "I\u2019m a chef, and I subscribe to many great cooking subreddits. I stumbled upon this sub over the last few days along with many others. I feel like there is a top secret truth to why we don\u2019t see many actual recipes from our favorite corporate restaurants. \n\nThe unfortunate truth is, most of these recipes were developed in laboratory style kitchens, with ingredients that aren\u2019t commonly found in home kitchens. They were designed with cost and mass production in mind. Almost any sauce you love from a chain restaurant is composed of an emulsified oil, or sugar mixture, with flavorings, colors and preservatives. \n\nThe people who know these recipes aren\u2019t workers at your average fast food restaurant. They are food scientists, who are not going to divulge proprietary information in this forum. \n\nMy suggestion for this subs future, is to focus on best homemade substitutes that come as close as possible to the original.  \n\nI would suggest changing the flair options to things like \u2018sauces\u2019, \u2018sandwich\u2019, \u2018fried chicken\u2019, \u2018baked goods\u2019, etc. We might get some better information this way. \n\nSome things can be learned from the people who work at these restaurants. These things are more about procedure, than ingredients. For example, Bojangles biscuits recipe. They use regular Pillsbury biscuit flour. What makes them great, is the way they prepare them. We should encourage this kind of content. The way a place makes their fried chicken, what makes it special. These are things that we can learn from a sub like this. \n\nI think we need to give up on waiting for somebody to deliver the actual recipe for chic-fil-a sauce. We don\u2019t actually want to make that recipe. We want to find close enough recipes that can be tested and confirmed by this community. \n\nI think we\u2019re all here because we see the potential of this sub. It just needs some guidance, and a better focus to move forward.\n\n\n\nEdit: Well this has been fun. Y\u2019all are a great bunch. Because I\u2019m a chef, I must leave you now, to bury myself in work for the next 12 hours.

{"title": "Two Ingredients You Didn\u2019t Know You Need", "selftext": "I figured alongside top secret recipes I could discuss some top secret recipe tips here. In relation to the sub, these two ingredients are found in just about all commercialized recipes requested here. If you\u2019re attempting to create a copycat, they could very well be the missing link.\n\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Lecithin \n\nWhile the two might sound scary, they\u2019re anything but. As Ann Reardon once said (paraphrasing), if I told to you add sodium bicarbonate to your recipe would you be skeptical? That\u2019s just baking soda. While you shouldn\u2019t take health advice from someone on the internet, knowingly or not, you\u2019re already most likely consuming both of these additives on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n**Xanthan Gum**\n\n\n\nWithout going into too much detail which I\u2019m unqualified to speak on, xanthan gum is a plant based powder that can be useful in everything from emulsifying to thickening.\n\n\nI recreate a lot at home and there\u2019s always something missing from homemade sauces, thickness. If you\u2019ve ever tried your own, you know what I mean. No amount of emulsification or reducing will leave you with the smooth thick texture of something store bought. That\u2019s where xanthan gum comes to play. Sometimes you\u2019ll achieve the perfect flavor in something seemingly watered down. In the standardized thickening process you\u2019ll lose that original flavor and end up going back and forth for a while before just giving up and settling. That\u2019s because the vast majority of sauces out there use xanthan gum as the primary source of thickening. I\u2019ve even used it on buffalo sauce to coat chicken wings better. \n\n\nIts uses can surprisingly spread far. You can throw some in an ice cream base for smoother ice cream, or even in a hot chocolate for a latte texture. When making something like a relish, xanthan gum can also be useful in preventing the ingredients from separating. \n\n\nYou\u2019re definitely going to want a scale when messing with this stuff but I\u2019d be a liar if I told you I\u2019ve never free balled it. You typically want to start at 0.05% of your liquid weight and move up in low increments until you\u2019ve achieved your desired consistency. 0.35% would be the maximum you should use so watch out or you\u2019ll ruin your recipe. \n\n\n**Soy Lecithin**\n\n\nLecithin is simply the god of ingredients when it comes to baking and it also happens to be another great emulsifier. If you want to take your kitchen to the next level, this is the next step. With it, not only will your sauces bind but your food will stay fresher and more moist for longer. It\u2019s almost a necessity in baked goods. \n\n\nBasically, lecithin powder just holds onto moisture really well. It will keep things soft for days and prevent staling. It\u2019s perfect for any baked goods you want to remain moist. Almost all of commercialized soft baked goods use this but also restaurants that prepare items a day or so in advanced. It\u2019s also great for breads! \n\n\nYou can also get lecithin in liquid form for perfect emulsification that won\u2019t split. One downside is that liquid lecithin is hydrophobic so it will only work well with oil based sauces like salad dressings, for example. \n\n\nThe ratio for lecithin in baking is pretty self explanatory. Just 1% of the flour weight. For liquid lecithin in emulsification, you want to use 1% of the oil. \n\n\nBoth of these ingredients are tasteless and can be incorporated into your daily use. They have no affect on recipes apart from their intended purposes so everything else stays exactly the same including ingredients, measurements, and process. \n\n\nI tend to see a lot of copycat recipes fail simply because they try to get around and avoid using some necessary ingredients. It\u2019s been stated here before but the vast majority of chain restaurant and commercial products are developed using an abundance of ingredients not available in your typical grocery store. While not for everyone, these two ingredients are almost a powerhouses in commercial cooking but can also be used in your normal day to day recipes. Why not give it a shot? Experiment a bit. Take the time to crack your favorite recipes yourself or just improve your everyday meals. Both can be found on Amazon at affordable prices.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dg0re8/two_ingredients_you_didnt_know_you_need/", "created_utc": 1570726000.0, "score": 2411, "author": "Blind_at_Sea", "num_comments": 117, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dg0re8/two_ingredients_you_didnt_know_you_need/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "The actual KFC recipe", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have a recipe that I found a long time ago, apparently it is the current KFC corporate recipe, as it was written in 2010. There may have been slight changes to the recipe up to now but I doubt it since the ingredients are easy to get.\n\nThe secret is said to be in the marinade, as it gives it an unmatched flavor. What it says it contains is \u201cpotassium\u201d but I did some research and through experiments I came to the conclusion that it is tetra potassium pyrophosphate. It is the only molecule that works well, since other products that contain potassium would be \u201cpotassium nitrate\u201d, \u201cpotassium chloride\u201d, \u201cpotassium carbonate\u201d and these do not give our meat organoleptic characteristics. Bottle Concantrate Chicken is an ingredient that is mentioned for the marinade and it contains other main ingredients such as chicken concentrate, corn starch, salt, sugar, chicken fat, citric acid, natural flavors.\n\nThe marinade can vary by country and region, as many KFCs are franchises and are not authorized to carry all of the KFC (now Kentucky Fried Chicken) corporate ingredients. Some marinades may contain other potassium and sodium phosphates, as well as sodium bicarbonate. All of these help to keep the meat juicy and slow down the oxidation process of fats and meat, which gives the meat a rancidity (refrigerated flavor). They can be more antioxidants like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid. But the former are acids which could unbalance the pH of our marinade.\n\nAnother secret is the breading part, as skimmed milk powder and egg powder are used to combine it with the flour.\n\nMSG is essential since it is found in almost all processed foods in all fast food restaurants. It is a widely used flavour enhancer, although another commonly used enhancer is yeast extract, which is an extract of amino acids and nucleotides from the yeast Saccaromyces Cerviseae that gives foods a umami flavour. The sugar present in chicken concentrate is also essential, since for curing chicken and other meats, a little sugar is needed to start the curing process of the meat and enhance that umami flavour even more. We all know that ferments (umami) have a different flavour than the original foods, for example anchovies (fish), fish sauce (fish), miso paste (soy, rice), soy sauce (soy beans), hams (fresh meat), cheddar and parmesan cheese (dairy derivatives), Worcestershire sauce (soy and mollusks), sausages (fresh meat), pickled olives (olive trees), among many others\u2026\n\nI leave the document in the photo.

{"title": "[Recipe] Popeye's Fried Chicken Sandwich - written recipe with sauce", "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nSo, I have been a lurker on this sub and this is going to be my first post. I hope you all find it useful and can appreciate the recipe as much as we did at my place! :)\n\n\\[Skip below to read the recipe directly if you'd rather not indulge in my story. :) \\]\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI am professional chef at a luxury hotel in the Midwest. Since the pandemic, work has been super slow. And, like most chefs, I find it hard to not do something with my time. So, I started documenting a lot of my experiments in the kitchen, a lot of recreations of famous chain restaurants, and some of my own concoctions too! I have a full year planned out of how I want to make videos of each of these for my YT channel - which is also something I started doing with full force due to the pandemic!\n\nThere is a video of the [Popeye's Fried chicken recipe](https://youtu.be/elynVq6YINk), and on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/honestcooks) you will also find other recreations like [Shake Shack Shroom Burger](https://youtu.be/B8PVw-TEs0c), [Panda Express Firecracker Shrimp](https://youtu.be/1gxlXqUJwXg), [Ikea Meatballs](https://youtu.be/xm3Xy3Ycnpc) and others. I do an extensive research on all my recipes and I also try to keep them simple for home-cooking, and for that reason, I vouch for the taste and authenticity. If you enjoy the written recipe below, it would be mighty awesome of you if you considered watching the video too, please. :) If not, no big deal - I am happy to bring you the recipe either way.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHere we go -\n\n**Ingredients for Popeye's Fried Chicken Sandwich for 2 portions.** ^(You can easily multiply this recipe if you're making more.)\n\n1. Brioche Buns: 2\n2. Chicken Breast: 1 breast, weighing between 10 and 12 oz. If you have smaller ones, use two. If you're using thighs, use one for each, total 2.\n3. Pickles: 6 slices each, total 12.\n4. Oil, to fry the chicken\n\n**To marinade the chicken:**\n\n1. Buttermilk: 1.5 cups, full cream or full fat buttermilk\n2. ~~Sriracha~~  Old bay seasoning or any other cajun mix : 2 tsp  \n\\*made an error in transferring the recipe from video to text. Thanks to u/Elephant789 for pointing it out to me. :)\n3. Garlic Powder: 1 tsp\n4. Paprika: 1 tsp \\*adjust this as per your heat level.\n5. Salt and pepper: to taste\n\n**For the Spicy Mayo sauce that goes on the buns:**\n\n1. Mayo: 2 heaped tablespoons\n2. Sriracha or any other hot sauce: 2 tsp\n3. Old bay seasoning or any other cajun mix: 2 tsp\n4. Cayenne: 1 tsp \\*adjust this as per your heat level.\n\n**To dredge the chicken before frying**:\n\n1. AP flour: 3-4 oz\n2. Salt/Pepper/Paprika: to season the flour, about half tsp each OR a couple shakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Clean the breast and divide it into 2 equal portions. If it is too thick, whack it a bit with a rolling pin to even out the width so it cooks evenly later on.\n2. Mix all the marinade stuff in a bowl and whisk to combine. Add the chicken and rest in fridge for a minimum of 45 mins OR up to 3 hours.\n3. In the meantime, get the sauce ready by mixing all the ingredients and mixing to combine.\n4. Also, mix the dredging ingredients in a separate bowl.\n5. when the chicken has rested enough, remove from the fridge. Heat oil in pan. Let chicken come to room temp while the oil heats.\n6. when the oil is hot, between 350 and 360 F, take 2 tbsp of the chicken marinade and add to the dredging flour mixture. Mix with a fork.\n7. Now, take the chicken from the marinade and put in the bowl with the dredging flour. Coat with flour by pressing it down so its well coated. Lift the chicken and shake to remove extra flour.\n8. drop in hot oil. repeat step 7 for all pieces.\n9. Do Not overcrowd the pan when frying. Add only up to 4 pcs if frying in a deep and wide pan. Or else stick to batches of 2.\n10. Dont touch the chicken for a good 2-3 mins till it is lightly crispy on one side. Then, FLIP. Follow this step again for the other side. Once you have some color on both sides, now you have to flip it often to avoid burning.\n11. cook till internal temp is 165 f. OR until juices run 100% clear.\n12. Toast brioche buns with butter.\n13. To assemble: Smear on the sauce on both top and bottom bread. Add pickles to the bottom part. Add on the fried chicken and cover with the top bread part.\n14. Serve with fries and ketchup/\n15. Optional step: Come back and let me know if you enjoyed my recipe, makes my day to hear back from redditors when they like the recipe. :))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you to all those who read this all the way. And thank you to those who considered supporting my channel.

Allow the pieces to rest until the shortening comes up to heat.  Carefully, position the chicken in the pan. Place the wings, near the sides of the pan. The dark meat and the breasts go (skin side down) towards the center. Monitor the heat. Keep the temperature at 330-350 F. Watch the progress. Peer under the chicken - especially the breasts. Do not allow the chicken to over-brown. Turn once. Fry for a total of 19-23 minutes. Drain the chicken on an oven rack.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/e4rsr9/kfc_chicken/", "created_utc": 1575251971.0, "score": 490, "author": "ebmsebm", "num_comments": 71, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/e4rsr9/kfc_chicken/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "An Obsessive-Compulsive's Guide to Chipotle's Chicken.", "selftext": "I've spent the past few weeks doing some trial & error in reverse engineering Chipotle's chicken recipe. I worked at a Chipotle for a few months, so I have some first-hand knowledge about the ingredients used and different processes involved in this chicken recipe. I've reviewed *dozens* of online \"copycat\" recipes, and every single one misses the mark in some way. Let's go... \n\nFirst, I'm going to list all of the ingredients and amounts, and then the steps. And if you're so inclined, I'm going to go into great detail afterwards about each decision I made here. \n\n***Note:*** Please do not turn this into a debate about your opinion of Chipotle or their food, that's not what this post is about. I am simply sharing a recipe for those who enjoy their chicken. \n\n###INGREDIENTS \n\n####Serves: 2 (scale up as needed)\n\n* 1 pound | 454g boneless/skinless chicken thighs\n\n#####Adobo marinade:\n\n* \u00bd ounce | 14g dried morita chipotle chiles\n\n* \u00bd cup | 118ml boiling water\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml Better Than Bouillon Roasted Chicken Base (reduced sodium)\n\n* 1 crushed garlic clove\n\n* 1 tablespoon | 15ml distilled white vinegar\n\n* 2 tablespoons | 30ml neutral oil\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml ground cumin\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml Mexican oregano, crushed in the palm of your hand\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml ground black pepper\n\n* 2 teaspoons | 6g Diamond Crystal kosher salt **or** 1 teaspoon | 6g fine table salt\n\n###INSTRUCTIONS \n\n1. Toast the dried chipotle chiles in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant and skins begins to bubble, flipping frequently to avoid burning. This should take about 5 minutes. Transfer chiles to cutting board and let them cool off until you can handle them. Remove the seeds from at least one chile. More if you want it less spicy. Remove any thick stems from the chiles. \n\n2. Meanwhile, mix boiling water and Better Than Bouillon in heat-proof container, set aside. \n\n3. Add the all chiles to bouillon and allow to soften for at least 5 minutes while you prep the rest of the ingredients. \n\n4. Add the chiles, bouillon, and all remaining adobo ingredients to a high powered blender or food processor and blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down sides as needed. \n\n5. [Edit: The marinade will likely be hot at this point, and it should be cooled before adding it to the chicken!] Add chicken to a bowl and pour adobo over chicken, then using gloves, mix thoroughly to combine, ensuring chicken is completely covered in adobo. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, ideally 24 hours. \n\n6. Preheat 2 tablespoons of a high smoke point oil in a stainless steel, carbon steel, or cast iron pan over medium high heat, until oil just begins to smoke. Make sure to turn on the vent/range hood and open some windows, this will create a \"pepper spray\" effect. Working with one piece of chicken at a time, remove from marinade, let any excess marinade drip back into bowl, and carefully lay flat-die down into hot oil. It is okay to crowd the pan, but you may have to work in batches depending on how much chicken you are cooking and how big your pan is. Cook over medium-high heat until the first side is well-charred (spotty black, but not fully black), 5-10 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is well-charred, 5-10 minutes. You want to err on the side of overcooking here. \n\n7. Once chicken is fully cooked and both sides are well-charred, transfer to a clean bowl and allow to rest for just 5 minutes. Once rested, move to cutting board, cut length-wise into 1/2-3/4\" strips, then align strips and cut perpendicular into 1/2-3/4\" cubes. Move all cubes and any juices back into bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to sit for at least 15 minutes. This step is crucial. Before serving, mix everything up to coat the chicken in all of the juices.  \n\n---\n\nSo now for the \"*why*\".\n\n######Adobo \n\nChipotle gets their adobo marinade in a bag. It comes to the store pre-made, so nobody really knows what's all in it, besides what's listed on their website, which I used as a reference for this. You can find the same ingredient list on their website if you google \"chipotle ingredients\" (I'm purposefully avoiding any hyperlinks in this post). \n\n######Chicken\n\nChipotle uses boneless/skinless chicken *quarters*.  These are legs and thighs still attached. If you can find these, great, use those. If not, use boneless/skinless thighs.\n\n\n######Chipotle Chiles\n\nMake sure you use the \"morita\" variety and not the \"meco\". The morita are dark purple, smaller, less smoky, and softer. The meco are light tan, larger, more smoky, and more stiff. There are several good places to buy Chipotle Morita online. If you can only find meco, it will still taste great, but not the same. Leaving all of the seeds intact does make it spicier than what's served at Chipotle, so that's why I'm suggesting to remove the seeds from at least one chile (scale this up as well, if you scale up everything else). You can adjust the spiciness as needed by removing more or less seeds and any large ribs. \n\nIt's my belief that Chipotle *does not* use anything similar to \"canned chipotles in adobo\", but instead makes their own basic adobo from dried chipotles. I've tried both methods, and starting with canned chipotles in adobo does taste different than actual chipotle. It's still very good, but just not the same. If that is all you can find, then you can use 2 tablespoons minced per pound of chicken, room-temp water, and skip step 1 and 2. \n\n######Bouillon\n\nThe Better Than Bouillon is certainly not used by Chipotle, but I will explain why I included it here. For starters, I think it's a safe assumption that *if* chipotle is using chicken stock in their adobo, then they have included that in their ingredient list by just including \"chicken\" and \"water\" as ingredients. Technically, the Better Than Bouillon contains other ingredients that are not listed on their website, but it's not anything drastic. Also, I know that many of you on this sub use Better Than Bouillon anyway, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal to include it. Worst case, just omit it and use straight water, but maybe bump the salt up very slightly if you do. I've never tested this without using the bouillon. If you have a basic homemade or boxed chicken stock, then by all means, use that instead. \n\n######Oil\n\nWhen I say \"neutral\" oil, I mean something that is refined and light in color, like vegetable oil. Chipotle lists sunflower oil, but I don't think that's worth a special purchase. I have not tested that though. \n\n######Oregano\n\nI think Mexican oregano is key here. I have tested it with standard Greek oregano, and it is very different. When I say to \"crush in the palm of your hand\", that should be pretty self-explanatory. The goal is to break up the large pieces first, and the smell should immediately hit you when you do this. If it doesn't, your oregano is old and should be replaced. \n\n######Salt\n\nThe salt amount seems quite high, and it is, but a lot of that salt will be left behind in the blender and bowl. Chipotle uses Morton kosher salt, so if you do that, you should reduce the amount by 25%, or 1.5 teaspoons or 6g per pound of chicken. You must use the exact type of salt here if you're going to use volume measurements.\n\n######Marinating\n\nI will often only marinade for about 2 hours, and it's good. Chipotle will do all of their marinades the previous day, for up to 24 hours, so this is ideal. \n\n######Cooking\n\nChipotle uses a large flat-top griddle. I have a Blackstone 36\" griddle that I use outside, which is ideal, but obviously not practical or possible for many people. I greatly prefer cooking this over charcoal, which is completely different, but highly recommended. \n\n######Resting\n\nAfter cutting the chicken into pieces, Chipotle covers the pan with plastic wrap and puts it into a warming cabinet that is set to 165F, where it will sit for *hours*, sometimes. You do not need to go to this extreme, but wrapping the bowl with the hot chicken and letting it sit for at least 15 minutes is absolutely critical here. Not doing this will produce a completely different texture. \n\n---\n\nThat's it. I think it's pretty damn close, and I think you will too.

This is a life saver for those who have big families at home.)\n\nThere is actually a recipe for bisquick on that link above. For the lazy: 8 Cups Flour 1 1/4 Cups Nonfat Dry Milk Powder 1/4 Cup Baking Powder 1 Tablespoon Salt 2 Cups Shortening\n\nCombine flour, milk, baking powder, and salt in a very large bowl. Cut in shortening until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Store in tightly closed covered container in a cool place.

Turn off heat. Slowly whip in cheese, then remove from heat. PLACE egg yolks in a separate bowl and slowly whip in a portion of the hot milk and cream mixture. Slowly add egg yolk mixture back into remaining cream mixture. Place back on very low heat and continually stir until simmering. Take sauce off heat so it thickens.

To everyone that\u2019s been to The Ganachery in Disney Springs, they may have tried their Hot Ganache drinking chocolate. To everyone that hasn\u2019t tried it, it\u2019s a delicious hot chocolate made from ganache. \n\nNow I\u2019ve tried hot chocolates from a lot of places, from England, to Italy, to Spain, and nowhere has even come close to this drink. It\u2019s rich, smooth, thick, and perfect. \n\nThe problem is the fact that I only come to Disney world once a year. And coming from a cold country, I\u2019d love to be able to make it at home. However I have searched all over the internet, emailed them directly, and they are still yet to respond with a recipe. So I had to physically go into the shop and ask the people at the counter. It was a man and a woman, one of them being a manager/supervisor. And being Disney, they not surprisingly told me it was secret and couldn\u2019t tell me... Fair enough. So I thought my quest to find this recipe was over.\n\nHowever... A few days later, being a lover of the drink, I went into the shop again to buy another. This time, I saw the member of staff who I saw last time, all alone without any other colleague or supervisor, and they recognised me...\n\nA big thank you to that member of staff who gave me this list of ingredients...\n\nHeavy Cream - 80oz\n\n2% milk - 20oz\n\nMilk Chocolate - 24oz\n\nDark Chocolate - 24oz\n\nCaramel - 16oz\n\n(They also mentioned Sea Salt but didn\u2019t write it down)\n\nNow this is a massive step in the right direction. I now have a list of ingredients in order to make this drink at home. However, I don\u2019t have the recipe itself. \n\nI bought the ingredients, mixed them together a million different ways, and tried it. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, it was delicious (I mean who doesn\u2019t love hot chocolate), but it wasn\u2019t the same. \n\nSo here\u2019s where I turn to Reddit: Is there anyone, who has any information on how to make this amazing drink?

{"title": "[Recipe] Starbucks recreation at home - Chai Latte and Salted Caramel Mocha. Both perfect for Fall. :)", "selftext": "**Recreating Starbucks Recipes \u2013 Chai Latte and Salted Caramel Mocha**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/gallery/o4XTFn7) OR a [4-min video](https://youtu.be/0LNWr4VJ3u0).\n\nWell, who doesn't like a good cup of hot drink, yeah? But ever since I started working from home, I haven't wanted to go out in the mornings just to get my chai latte from the Starbucks 2 blocks down. After a couple trials, I recreated 2 of my favorite hot drinks from the Starbucks menu -Chai Latte and Salted Caramel Mocha. Save yourself a few good bucks when you make these at home! :)\n\nI spent zero dollars on this recipe since I had everything in my pantry \u2013 they are mostly panty essentials, and even if you end up buying something, say a can of whipped cream, you could always use it for something else \u2013 still MUCH cheaper than starbucks drinks but the same exact taste! Happy drinking. :)\n*********************\nEdit - Fancy Coffee Math:\n\nSalted caramel mocha, size TALL (12 OZ) is $4.25 at Starbucks, tax not included. With 12% tax it is $4.75\n\nIf you buy all the ingredients, these are organic prices, all from Amazon, so grocery stores will probably be cheaper, but still for argument sakes let's do organic -\nWhole milk 32oz is 2.29\nCane sugar 32oz is 2.99\nCoffee Starbucks Breakfast blend is 7.99\nHersheys cocoa powder 8oz is 2.98\nMcCormick Vanilla extract 3oz is 5.49\nTotal is $21.75\n\nNow, 21.75\u00f74.75 will give you about 4.5 drinks. Since you can't buy half a drink that would be 4 drinks. Meaning if you have $21.75 in your hands, you can either buy 4 drinks at Starbucks OR all of these ingredients. \n\nBut I wanna assume you went out to buy all these ingredients just for this recipe and never used it for anything else, with 32 oz of milk as your base, you'll get 72 oz of drink since you also add coffee and water to the recipe. That itself is 6 drinks, that's assuming each time you drink 12oz of coffee which is same as TALL Starbucks size. \nAnd that's costing it for organic, expensive, Prime Now costed ingredients.\n**********************\n\n**Ingredients for 1 serving of each drink:** \n\n**1\\] Chai Latte:** \n\n1. Milk, whole: half cup or 4 fl. Oz\n\n2. Water: half cup or 4 fl. oz \n\n3. Cinnamon stick: half stick or 2 inches \n\n4. Cloves: 2 pcs \n\n5. Cardamom: 3 pcs \n\n6. Minced ginger: 1 tsp. \n\n7. Sugar: 1 tbsp \n\n8. Loose tea leaves, black tea: 2 tbsp OR use 2 teabags \n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. In a pot, heat the water with the whole spices and minced ginger.\n\n2. When it comes to a rolling boil, keep the heat to medium and then add in the tea leaves and sugar. Simmer this until the liquid is half the quantity you started with.\n\n3. Strain and set aside. Use the same cup that you want for the final assembly.\n\n4. Bring the milk to a boil in a clean pot. Remove from heat and create some froth using an immersion blender. You can keep the froth as much or as less you want. \n\n5. To assemble: pour the milk with the froth on top of the chai concentrate and garnish with cinnamon powder.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**2\\] Salted Caramel Mocha:** \n\n1. Espresso Shots: 2 OR half cup coffee\n\n2. Milk, whole: half cup of 4 fl. Oz\n\n3. Cocoa Powder: 1 tsp\n\n4. Sugar: 1 tbsp\n\n5. Salted caramel sauce: 1.5 tbsp & half tsp for garnish \n\n6. Vanilla extract: 1 tsp\n\n7. Whipped cream: for garnish\n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. In a pot, add the 2 shots of coffee with 1 shot of water. Add sugar and cocoa powder and stir on low heat. \n\n2. When the sugar dissolves, add salted caramel sauce. \\[Salted caramel sauce is the same as caramel sauce, with a pinch of sea salt added when you put the cream and whisk it.\\]\n\n3. When the caramel dissolves, add milk and vanilla extract and bring it to a boil.\n\n4. To assemble: pour into a cup, add whipped cream on top with more salted caramel sauce.\n\nIf you liked the recipes, please consider [checking out my channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/honestcooks), if not, no biggie.

As It Looks In The Ads, Not In The Restaurant.", "selftext": "https://www.bupkis.org/wp-content/uploads/zuppa_toscana-300x274.jpg\n\nI really liked Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana and spent quite a bit of time reproducing it, but then just \"kept going\".\n\nThis recipe has two options: \"Like you really want it\" and \"Like they actually serve it\". Take your pick.\n\nThe recipe is below, but reddit kind of mangles the formatting, \nso an [**easier to read version is here**](https://www.bupkis.org/index.php/recipes-2/soups-2/italian-sausage-potato-and-kale-soup-olive-garden-zuppa-toscana).\n\n__________________________________________\n\nI really like Olive Garden\u2019s Zuppa Toscana, however I find it a little too salty, with not enough sausage or potato, and I didn\u2019t really like the big chunk of Kale with the rib still attached sitting in the bowl, looking like garnish that fell off somebody\u2019s lunch plate. So, I decided to make it better. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nThe half and half gives it a light creamy taste, while still letting the sausage shine though. The red pepper gives it a nice bite, and the kale gives it a light touch of brightness and bitterness to balance the sausage and dairy.\n\nAlthough from the ingredients list it looks like a rich soup, it\u2019s actually quite light, since there are 10 cups of stock & water, and only one cup of half and half, and nearly all the grease is drained from the sausage after cooking\n\nIngredients:\n\n2\tPounds\tLow-starch potatoes, washed, eyes removed and sliced into 1/4 inch disks. Peeling is optional.\n\n2\tPounds\tHot and/or Sweet Italian Sausage Links\n\n1\tLarge Bunch\tKale (it looks like a lot but will cook down)\n\n1\tLarge\tYellow Onion, diced small\n\n2\tT\tGarlic, mashed. Approx 8 cloves (see instructions)\n\n8\tOunces\tHalf and Half\n\n4\tCups\tReduced Sodium Chicken Stock\n\n6\tCups\tWater\n\n1/2\tTeaspoon\tGround Red Pepper (to taste)\n\n3/4\tTeaspoon\tKosher Salt (to taste)\n\n_________________\n\n**A quick potato primer:**\n\nPotatoes come in three basic styles, \u201chigh starch,\u201d \u201cmedium starch,\u201d and \u201clow starch.\u201d\n\nBaking Potatoes, Russet, White & General Purpose are all high starch and great for baking, mashing and frying. But not for this soup. They\u2019ll make it feel \u201cgrainy\u201d when reheated.\n\n\u201cAll Purpose\u201d potatoes are somewhere in the middle and like \u201cOne Size Fits All\u201d clothing, aren\u2019t really the best choice for any purpose.\n\nBoiling Potatoes, Round White or Red Potatoes are low starch and will cook beautifully in soup. They\u2019ll keep their shape and texture, even when reheated and not turn the soup into a grainy mess.\n_____________________\n\nNote: I\u2019m always disappointed when a pot of soup runs out the interesting stuff before the broth is gone, so this recipe includes quite a bit of sausage and potato and kale as well as additional spice and seasoning to handle the extra ingredients.\n\nIf made as shown above, you\u2019ll get a pot full of soup with \u201cgood stuff\u201d all the way from the top to the bottom.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something lighter, feel free to reduce the potato, sausage, garlic, salt and ground red pepper by one-half, which will give you something closer to the proportions that OG uses.\n\nKale tends to have dirt, sand, etc. stuck in it, so it needs a good washing. It also will leak \u201cgreen\u201d into your soup making it look nasty. A quick blanch in boiling water will both clean the kale and prevent it from turning your soup green. The recipe below includes this step.\n\n**Directions:**\n\nFill a large pot with water, bring it to a rolling boil and add some salt \u2013 about the same amount of salt as if you were making pasta. \n\nFill a large bowl with cold water and some ice. Put a large colander in the sink.\n\nCut the base off the head of kale and roughly tear the leaves into 2\u2033 pieces, discarding the hard portion of the rib, and place in the colander for later. Olive Garden leaves the rib in, but I think it\u2019s too big and hard to put on a soup spoon.\n\nPlace the garlic in a mortar and pestle with a heavy pinch of kosher salt and mash until liquid, or finely mince, then grind with the back edge of a knife. You need at least two heaping Tablespoons of mashed garlic when you\u2019re done.\n\n\nCut the raw sausage into 1/2 inch chunks with shears or a knife. Add a little oil to the bottom of a large pot. Add the sausage. \n\nSaut\u00e9 on medium until fully cooked and you have developed a good deal of fond (brown stuff) on the bottom of the pot.\n\n\nPour off grease as necessary and build as much fond as possible without burning or drying out the sausage.\n\n\nRemove the sausage and save. Pour off the excess fat, leaving just enough to coat the bottom of the pot.\n\n\nDrop all the kale into the boiling salted water. Wait a few seconds until the kale turns bright green, then immediately dump the boiling water and kale into the colander in the sink. Then dump the hot, drained kale into the bowl of ice water and swish it around. \n\nDump the chilled kale into the colander to drain.\n\nAdd the finely diced onions and saut\u00e9 on medium until soft, nicely browned, and more fond develops.\n\nAdd the garlic and continue stirring until just fragrant and soft (probably about a minute). Be careful to not to burn or brown the \ngarlic. Add the ground red pepper and mix.\n\nAdd a small amount of water and deglaze the bottom of the pot (scrape up all the yummy brown bits).\n\nAdd the rest of the water, the chicken stock, the potatoes and sausage.\n\nBring to a slow simmer and continue simmering until the potatoes are soft.\n\nAdd the kale then turn off the heat.\n\nImmediately before serving, add the half and half, and serve with some nice home-baked Ciabatta bread.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/lc5acy/olive_gardens_zuppa_toscana_as_it_looks_in_the/", "created_utc": 1612405974.0, "score": 252, "author": "None", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/lc5acy/olive_gardens_zuppa_toscana_as_it_looks_in_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Bojangles biscuits", "selftext": "So it's been a while, but this is what I remember for the recipe. You will need a very large mixing bowl for this.\n\n10 pounds self rising flour\n1/2 tablespoon salt\n1 pound of shortening (refrigerated)\n1/2 gallon buttermilk\n1/2 pound of salted margarine or butter, melted\n\n\nMix the salt and flower in the bowl.  Put entire pound of shortening in bowl with flour mix, and break the shortening down into smallish bits (about a bit larger than a grain of rice).\n\nAt this point some of us put the bowl in the walk in fridge.  It would help keep the shortening from melting too fast when baking, which would make those flat looking biscuits.  If you want the pretty ones, refrigerate it, trust me.\n\nSo, from there, pour in the entire container of buttermilk, and mix.  The absolute key here is to not overmix it.  Just give it a good few folds by hand or with a spatula until it is a wet, lumpy, and sticky dough.\n\nFlour a large surface, scoop up as much dough as the surface can handle, and put the dough on it.  Fold the dough about four times, dusting with flour on each fold.  Do not knead!  It should still be fluffy Flour the top of the dough,  and gently roll to about 1/2 inch thickness.  Don't press down on the dough when you do this. (In the store, the pin had guides on each side to prevent pressing too hard as well as keeping the dough uniform as it was rolled.\n\nDust a biscuit cutter, and cut those bad boys out.  Put them on a non greased baking sheet, and bake at 450F for around 20 minutes.  Once they are golden brown, they are ready, so keep an eye on them.\n\nAfter they are done, liberally brush with the melted butter/margarine.  Do this as soon as they are out of the oven.\n\n\nHope it turns out good for y'all.\n\nEdit:  Also you can add a couple tablespoons of powdered sugar to really kick it into 3rd gear.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/mo3jax/bojangles_biscuits/", "created_utc": 1618056650.0, "score": 189, "author": "avlmadman", "num_comments": 42, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/mo3jax/bojangles_biscuits/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

People obsess about it and it turns what would otherwise be a mediocre meal into heaven on Earth. Here\u2019s [a picture of it](https://ibb.co/cgw1pHb). It\u2019s very rich and thick but mixes very well into other foods. None of the recipes I\u2019ve found online come close to it and the cooks at House of Japan say that it\u2019s just egg yolks and oil. If y\u2019all have any idea how someone could go about making this, please let me know. If not, I will continue experimenting.\n\nEdit: To the people telling me that it\u2019s \u201cmayo\u201d, thank you so much. I had no idea that mayonnaise was made from egg yolks and oil.

Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, remaining one tablespoon of granulated sugar, and salt in a stand mixer.\n\n\n\nAdd the yeast mixture and melted butter to the flour mixture. Knead with the dough hook on medium speed until it is smooth and elastic, about eight minutes. Transfer to a bowl coated with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about one and a half hours.\n\n\n\nLightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Punch down the dough and transfer to a work surface; knead a few times. Cut in half and gently shape into two three-by-six-inch loaves (do not overwork the dough). Place the loaves three inches apart on the prepared pan. Lightly spray the loaves with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until puffy, 30 minutes to one hour.\n\n\n\nMake the topping: Whisk the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small baking dish. Whisk the melted butter and corn syrup in another small baking dish.\n\n\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two nine-by-five-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a two-inch overhang on all sides. Cut four deep slashes across the top of each loaf (the loaves will look deflated). Dip each loaf in the butter-corn syrup mixture, turning to cover, then coat with the cinnamon sugar, making sure to get the sugar in the crevices. Place the loaves in the prepared pans. Drizzle with any remaining butter mixture and sprinkle with any remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Lift the bread out of the loaf pans using the parchment overhang and transfer to a rack. Let cool in the paper, about 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, salt, melted butter, and three tablespoons of milk in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in up to two more tablespoons of milk as needed to loosen. Drizzle on the warm loaves or serve on the side for dipping.\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S KATSU CURRY - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_DgczQFxbB/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_DgczQFxbB/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S FIRECRACKER SHRIMP - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_sxgtNhFIL/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sxgtNhFIL/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S CHILI CHICKEN RAMEN - [https://www.wagamama.us/recipes](https://www.wagamama.us/recipes)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S MONTE CARLO BISCUITS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S SCOTCH FINGERS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger)\n\n\n\n**Arnott's Scotch Finger**\n\n* **Prep time: 10 mins** \n* **Cook time: 25 mins** \n* **Makes: 16 biscuits** \n\n\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* **170g salted butter, softened** \n* **\u2154 cup (90g) soft icing sugar** \n* **1 cup (165g) plain flour** \n* **1\u00bd tsp baking powder** \n\n\n\n**Method**\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 160\u00b0C.

{"title": "Burger King -- Smell and taste of BK Beef (2)", "selftext": "I am reviving a discussion that was closed for some reason, posted about 7 months ago. As the title suggest, it was an inquiry into that charred smell and taste of the BK Beef. I have been doing some research into this, so thought I would revive the topic.\n\nThese are a few of the well-known theories people have surmised that create that unique char-taste of the Whopper;\n\n1.\tThe fat that drips and creates that char-flame imparts the taste upon the meat.\n2.\tThe meat has charred marks on one side, because it travels along hot chains across the flames, landing into a warmer bin. It is well known, even by employees, that these chains build up black char and are not cleaned that often. Many believe the chains themselves impart the special flavor.\n3.\tThe meat itself is a different grade of meat that you would not get in fine dining or grocery stores. \n4.\tSomething is added to the meat.\n\nThe processing of the meat is kind of a secret across all the fast food chains. Some of them use fillers in their meats, some use high pressure, some use soy beans, low grade meats, etc. When it comes to the Whopper, I think the answer lies in looking at its history. \n\nIn 1956 a company was started called Red Arrow Products. They created additives, liquid smoke, that was made from burning saw dust, its essence captured and bottled into water. In 1957, Burger King was looking for something that would make its Whopper stand out. How do we know BK uses Red Arrow Products? An article by Eric Schlosser for the Rolling Stones which turned into a book, \u201cFast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All American Meal (2001)\u201d which uncovered these \u201ctop secret\u201d ingredients that remained hidden under the 100% Beef labeling and their history. Here is what he said;\n\n\u201cBurger King's BK Broiler Chicken Breast Patty contains \"natural smoke  flavor.\" A firm called Red Arrow Products Company specializes in smoke flavor, which is added to barbecue sauces and processed meats. Red Arrow manufactures natural smoke flavor by charring sawdust and capturing the aroma chemicals released into the air. The smoke is captured in water and then bottled, so that other companies can sell food which seems to have been cooked over a fire.\u201d\n\nI find it also odd that the new BK Impossible Whopper, a plant based burger, has the same char taste as its animal-based brother . Although the Impossible version is cooked over the same chains as its counterpart, and charred meat fat flames, I am leaning towards the fact it is not any of those , nor is it a hickory or mesquite liquid smoke that imparts its specialness as many have tried using, but charred saw-dust water.

{"title": "Secrets from Costco", "selftext": "Here are some facts on how Costco Food Service operates their Food Court, Bakeries and their Rotisserie Chicken and other BBQ stuff. FYI, I am not a Costco employee. This info is just pure research.\n\n* So most of the bakery goods at Costco locations make their bread and bake it in-house at their bakeries. Bagels, croissants, danishes, cakes and cookie doughs are delivered from Costco's commissary kitchens to the warehouses.\n* They make breads, pies in-house from scratch.\n* Most of the frosting or buttercream, mousse are place in 50Lbs (50#) white bins stored in plastic bag. It's up to the cake decorators to design the cakes for Costco warehouses.\n* The Costco Business Centers sell bulk ingredients and other baking components to other small businesses.\n* The food court use Lamonica's pizza dough for the oversized pizzas, but they are also sold in 30 oz dough balls in the frozen section. Sometimes they have a made from scratch recipe when you have a rare event outdoors, you just have to talk to the kitchen manager or food service manager.\n* The pizza sauce is available at the Costco Business Center which can be sold to business owners. But Costco members can purchase them. It's called \"Costco Pizza Sauce Concentrate\" Item #879126 which has 6 packet in 1 case. Each packet requires you to add 82 oz of water to make 190 oz of pizza sauce to your pizzas. It is advisable to use your own pizza dough, grate a block of mozzarella and other cheeses of choice, pepperoni and your other toppings. This link is referenced by the [original post about Costco's Pizza Sauce Concentrate at PizzaMaking.com](https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=31104.0).\n* Most of the dry rubs they use is also available in their warehouses for their customers.\n* Also the bulk baking ingredients like icings, and other fillings they use on their desserts, cakes, and baked goods are located beneath their pre packaged baked goods. You'll noticed that there are huge tubs, bins and other ingredients for those who need in their small business.\n* For recipes on their baked goods, search on Google or use Reddit from r/TopSecretRecipes, r/Baking and r/Costco for dupe recipes of your favorite desserts.

I make super easy mousses using any flavor of instant pudding mix you desire & 2-3 cups heavy whipping cream (basically just replacing the cold milk with heavy whipping cream instead). Add pudding mix & heavy whipping cream until combined & soft peaks form. Refrigerate for a few minutes then mix again until stiff peaks form. Mousse will be nice and thick. You can still add any fruit preserves or pie fillings for additional flavor combinations as well. Keep refrigerated. It is spreadable/pipeable & can be used as a frosting. I use this for my cake fillings. It\u2019s super easy & delish. Not too sweet & overpowering.

{"title": "Fuddruckers Burgers and Fries at Home-- FULL MEAL PREPARATION", "selftext": "Any burger purist knows the glory that once was Fuddruckers, and that in its heyday, it truly was the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Hamburger,\u201d as their signage so proudly declared.\u00a0 Today Fudds is in a state of near-extinction.\u00a0 Spotting one, especially a mega-Fudds built in the early 90\u2019s, is like spotting a northern white rhino in the wild.\u00a0x Most of them have been closed, and the ones remaining suffer from cutbacks in quality, offerings and experience so egregious that they\u2019re nearly unrecognizable. \u00a0\n\nThe concept was simple: in order to make the world\u2019s greatest hamburger they needed to take the three basic burger components\u2014bun, meat, toppings\u2014and provide the best version of each, ever offered, period. For the bun, Fudds had an in-house bakery, where plump, steaming rounds of pure heaven were pulled from ovens all day long.\u00a0 That smell of freshly baked bread was the first thing to hit you walking into a Fudds, and the last thing to bid you farewell, enticing an inevitable return.\u00a0 For the meat, they had an in-house butcher shop where the beef was freshly ground daily, with whole forequarters hanging from the ceiling, and a window where you could actually see the butchers at work (if that was your thing).\u00a0 And finally, for the toppings, a famously bountiful self-serve buffet of fresh veg, condiments, and of course, self-serve pump stations of that hot, gooey, molten-gold cheese sauce.\u00a0 Beyond the burger, the fries were equally exceptional\u2014wedge cut, skin-on potatoes, deep fried in canola oil to an amber crisp, liberally seasoned with \u201cFudds Spice\u201d\u2014a proprietary blend of seasonings (heavily favoring paprika) that, when also sprinkled on the burger itself as it hit the griddle, created a flavor amalgamation across the plate that resulted in something other-worldly, and something which humanity had neither experienced before, nor since.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, the closure of your local Fudds was a devastating event.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t around when JFK got whacked, but I imagine the level of grief was similar.\u00a0 The initial penetrating shock gave way to a deep, steady depression, and finally, a measure of unbridled anger I had never known.\u00a0 Why should my life even continue if there\u2019s no more Fudds?\u00a0 One day, in a moment of rarified personal strength and industry, I determined that if I could no longer go to Fudds, I would make Fudds come to me.\n\nIt has been that singular endeavor, my brothers, born of comprehensive research and an unwavering commitment to home-kitchen experimentation, that has led me back to the Promised Land, and to this post, which I offer for the benefit of humanity at large.\u00a0\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n**THE MEAT:**\n\nSchweid & Sons - Butcher Blend\n\n[https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/](https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/)\n\nYou can also go with their other blends like Signature or Heritage. Additionally they offer USDA Prime chuck, American Wagyu (their \u201cKatana\u201d blend), and several other options. Experiment with your tastes and what\u2019s available but these are all excellent blends for premium burger patties. I recommend buying the brick of mince rather than the pre-formed patties as it allows you to create a slightly looser pack. Even though Fudds now uses pre-formed, pre-ground patties of all-chuck, I feel that going with these higher-grade blends greatly enhances flavor and results in a burger closer to the OG Fudds in-house, freshly ground taste of memory.\u00a0\n\n**THE BUN:**\n\nBoulangerie Ace Bakery - Gourmet Buns - Classic\n\n[https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/](https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/)\n\nYou\u2019re looking for a premium bakery bun with that shiny golden dome, but ideally NOT a brioche bun. These are the closest I\u2019ve found where I live, but many bakeries may offer premium buns that fit this description.\u00a0\n\n**THE SPICE:**\n\n[https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html](https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html)\n\nThis is the special ingredient that brings it all together and ultimately makes Fudds\u2026well, Fudds. It\u2019s easily made at home. Follow the recipe to the letter, and multiply proportions as needed to ensure your home is never without the essential magic that is Fudd Spice.\u00a0\n\n**THE FRIES:**\n\nWild Fork Foods - Potato Wedges\n\n[https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa\\_Ap3Mt4soZ7](https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa_Ap3Mt4soZ7)\n\nTBH this was the trickiest component. French fry aficionados may prefer to attempt freshly cut wedges, but these are very close, if not spot-on, and without the hassle. The trick is finding wedges that aren\u2019t overly pre-seasoned because you need to add the Fudd Spice to make these taste correct, and most frozen wedges come with factory seasoning that tampers with (or completely ruins) the authenticity.\u00a0 Bake, air-fry, or, for the closest match, do what they do at Fudds and deep fry in canola oil, drain, and then sprinkle liberally with the magic dust!\n\n**THE CHEESE SAUCE:**\n\nRico\u2019s Premium Cheddar Cheese Sauce\n\n[https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/](https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/)\n\nYes, it\u2019s from a can, but it\u2019s spot on. If you want to go a fresher, more culinarily-sophisticated route, Godspeed, but I\u2019ve been going to Fudds for decades and trust me, for the express purpose of recreating the authentic Fudds experience in your maw, this is the cheese sauce you\u2019re looking for.\u00a0\n\n**THE TOPPINGS BAR:**\n\nThis goes without saying, but any home replication of that glorious fresh market of fixin\u2019s should include: sliced tomato, onion (multiple colors), lettuce (at least two leaf varieties), pickles, salsa, relish, jalape\u00f1o and other pepper varieties, and of course every condiment known to man, never to exclude the basic staples of ketchup, mustard, mayo, 1000 island, and anything else your little heart desires. Needless to say the cheese sauce as mentioned above will factor formidably into the final equation as well.\u00a0\n\n**BURGER PREPARATION:**\n\nFor authenticity it is essential that you cook your burger on a griddle. If you don\u2019t have one, a frying pan or cast iron skillet will substitute in a pinch.\u00a0 Do not, however, attempt to grill over an open flame. You will be rendering all the above meticulous preparations null and void, and doing yourself a great disservice in the bargain.\u00a0 If your griddle or skillet is unseasoned or rarely-used, you may consider adding a tablespoon of canola, avocado, or vegetable oil to the heated surface before laying down your patty. Remember, we are going for authenticity here, and the burger you remember from Fudds was not born of a pristine, virginal cook top, but rather of the greasy remnants of hundreds if not thousands of other burgers born before it on that same cook top. \u00a0\n\n1. Form your beef into 1/3 or 1/2 pound patties taking care not to pack too tightly.\u00a0\n2. Pre-heat griddle on medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil if desired, as suggested above.\u00a0\n3. Place the patty down onto the pre-heated griddle and sprinkle liberally with Fudd spice.\u00a0 This is how they did it at fudds\u2014they did not pre-season the patties before hitting the griddle, as you can see from video footage of Fudds cooks in action from the 1990\u2019s glory days.\u00a0 Cook for 4-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired temperature).\u00a0 Press the patty gently downward with your spatula not more than twice during this initial phase of cooking. Do not \u201csmash\u201d or cut the patty.\u00a0 Just enough pressure to aid in even cooking within and without, while simultaneously facilitating more caramelization on the outer rim. You want it Fudds style\u2014thick, juicy, with a respectable char on the outside.\n4. Flip the patty and cook for an additional 3-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired cook temperature).\u00a0 During this second phase you may elect to sprinkle the Fudd spice again, though, from what I have gleaned from archival footage on YouTube, the OG Fudds cooks did NOT bust a second sprinkydink.\u00a0 During the last minute of cooking, place a square (or squares) of your preferred cheese on the patty and cover with a metal bowl or cooking dome.\u00a0\n5. At some point during phase two of cooking the burger, brush melted butter on the inside of both halves of the bun, and place, butter side down, on the griddle in order to toast.\u00a0 Remove the buns when the insides achieve a golden crisp, being careful not to let them burn.\u00a0\n6. Place the toasted bun halves on a plate, insides facing up, and remove the perfectly cooked burger from the griddle with your spatula, deftly sliding it atop the bottom bun.\n7. Top with fixin\u2019s of your choice and finally enclose the masterpiece with the top bun.\u00a0\n8. Serve alongside your freshly cooked wedge fries, and sides of the hot cheese sauce, and tell heaven you\u2019ll call them back tomorrow.\u00a0\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "created_utc": 1745353029.0, "score": 147, "author": "AceRutherfords", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Set aside both bowls.\n\nIn a dutch oven or a large sauce pan over MEDIUM HEAT, saute\u2019 all of the blended vegetables to intensify all of the flavors. Add the 1st vegetable puree and let all of the water evaporate to make an oily but thick craggy paste left over. The volume will also be reduced by 1/3. It will look like kind of greenish with some oils separating at the edge of the saucepan. Add tomato paste and stir to get it incorporated. It will turn to a deep red paste and oil starts to change in color as well. Add the ground turmeric, Spanish smoked paprika, Allspice and Cayenne Pepper by letting them bloom with the tomato onion mixture. It will be fragrant as you cook for about 2 minutes. Add the blended banana puree, and stir until it becomes a thick, dark tan in color. Add in the brown sugar to caramelize the banana ketchup for 2 mins. Reduce the mixture down to a quarter, or until it becomes a thick and jammy sauce. Stir occasionally to avoid burning ingredients at the bottom.\n\nDecrease the heat to LOW, and simmer it for 15 to 20 minutes with the lid partially open. The banana ketchup is deep red and your spatula will look like a thick banana sauce holds on the back of the spoon. Taste and season with salt to heighten the banana flavor. At this point, you can even adjust the seasoning on how you like it whether you want more:\n\nsweetness - brown sugar\n\npungent or astringent - fruit or coconut vinegar\n\nwarm spices - allspice or you can use cloves\n\nsalty - soy sauce\n\nspicy - cayenne pepper or any type of chili powder, you have or want to try to change its flavor profile of the banana ketchup\n\nIf you are satisfied on what you have, transfer ketchup to a bowl. let it cool completely on the counter at room temperature. Then transfer to a sterilized mason jar.\n\nYou can use this as a condiment for burgers, fries, lumping shanghai or maybe cooking the Jolly spaghetti sauce.\n\nTake this recipe as a guide on making your own banana ketchup depending on how you want it to taste.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nPANCIT PALABOK: COPYCAT\n\n* This is my family\u2019s recipe on making palabok as it is more delicious compared to Jollibee.

I tried all of them as they were not available in the States. They were filling for a snack or light breakfast. When I was there, I liked the corned beef pie and the tuna pie. Then I tried the Choco Mallows Pie at another location, and OMG! It was so good. This pie had a chocolate pie crust but it had a slightly vanilla sweet cream. It was so good. You can definitely make it. Of course, these pies were sold as limited time products.\n\nYou can be creative making your own fry pies with many flavor combinations and can use the peach mango recipe as a guide to make your own fruit fillings like blueberries, apple, pineapple.\n\nI will post few pie fillings that feature tropical flavors like haupia, guava jam, passionfruit on another post.\n\nOf course, Jollibee are creating pies made with Filipino flavors like buko pandan or coconut pandan, ube, ube macapuno or ube coconut, pineapple langka or pineapple jackfruit, choco mallows (this flavor was inspired by a Fibisco choco snack that has a marshmallow mound on a biscuit then covered with bittersweet chocolate coating). Then you can put savory fillings like a tuna salad, corned beef and potatoes, ham egg & cheese,bacon egg cheese. Also, the bacon in most Asian countries like the Philippines is not smoked but cured with Filipino-Chinese spice blend. It tasted different from their American counterpart where they smoked their pork belly bacon with either Mesquite or Hickory wood chips and slow-cooked it to be tender.and mouth watering. Japan\u2019s bacon use a little natural curing salt but it tasted like Korean pork belly or samyupsul flavor profile.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBEVERAGES:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHOT COCOA MIX - ONLY AVAILABLE FROM THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n160 GRAMS GRANULATED SUGAR\n\n68 GRAMS HINTZ FINE DARK COCOA POWDER (THIS PRODUCT IS WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST)\n\n* YOU CAN DEFINTELY TRY THIS BUYING FROM MIDDLE EASTERN GROCERIES NEARBY OR MAYBE ONLINE\n\n15.4 GRAMS FULL CREAM POWDERED MILK OR NIDO POWDERED MILK\n\n1.6 GRAMS CORNSTARCH (FOR THICKENER)\n\nDASH OF SALT\n\nCombine all of the ingredients in a medium bowl with a wire whisk until well blended.\n\nThis hot cocoa mix yields 400 grams of hot cocoa mix per pack.\n\nHOW TO MAKE HOT CHOCOLATE JOLLIBEE-STYLE:\n\n1 PACK (400 grams) Hot cocoa mix\n\n2 Liters Hot water @ 212F\n\nMix all ingredients in large bowl until hot cocoa mix has been dissolved completely.\n\nTransfer contents to an airpot or a 2 Liter kettle.\n\nServe warm.

{"title": "The Cheesecake Factory Original Cheesecake", "selftext": "The owners tweaked the original cheesecake recipe, and made it their own. So this is the basic Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.\n\nCrust:  \n2-1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1/2 cup butter, melted  \nFilling:  \n4 packages (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened  \n2 cups sour cream  \n1-3/4 cups sugar  \n1 tablespoon vanilla extract  \n4 large eggs, lightly beaten  \nTopping:  \n1 cup sour cream  \n1/4 cup sugar\n\nStep 1: Make the graham cracker crust  \nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. In a small bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and the sugar, and stir in the melted butter. Press the mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9-inch springform pan.  \nPlace the springform pan on a baking sheet, and bake until lightly browned, about 18 to 22 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the cheesecake filling  \nIn a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese, sour cream, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Then, add the eggs and beat on low speed, just until combined. It\u2019s important not to overbeat the filling, which can lead to cracks in the cheesecake later on.\n\nStep 3: Pour the filling into the crust  \nPlace the springform pan on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil (about 18 square inches), and securely wrap the foil around the pan, which will prevent any spillage. Pour the filling into the cooled crust.\n\nStep 4: Make the water bath  \nPlace the foil-wrapped springform pan with the unbaked cheesecake in a larger baking pan, and add 1 inch of hot water to the larger pan to create the water bath.\n\nStep 5: Bake the cheesecake  \nBake at 325\u00b0 for about 1-1/2 hours, or until the center of the cheesecake is just set and the top appears dull.  \nAfter you take the cheesecake out of the oven, remove the springform pan from the water bath, and let it stand for five minutes on a wire rack.  \nTip: Don\u2019t use a toothpick to test for doneness, as you would for cake or brownies. Instead, do the wobble test.  \nOpen the oven door and give the pan a gentle but firm rap with a spoon to see if it wobbles.\n\nStep 6: Make the sour cream topping  \nIn a small bowl, mix the sour cream and sugar. When combined, spread it over the top of the cheesecake. Bake five minutes longer without the water bath. Pull it out of the oven and let cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack.\n\nStep 7: Set and refrigerate the cheesecake  \nLoosen the graham cracker crust from the sides of the pan with a knife, and remove the foil from around the springform pan. Cool for one hour longer on a wire rack.  \nRefrigerate the cheesecake overnight, covering when completely cooled. Remove the rim from the pan.\n\nStep 8: Serve.  \nAfter your cheesecake has been refrigerated overnight, it\u2019s ready to enjoy! While it already has a sour cream topping, you could choose to serve it with a drizzle of homemade strawberry syrup, glazed strawberries, chocolate ganache or a salted caramel sauce if you want to take it over the top.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1eusny9/the_cheesecake_factory_original_cheesecake/", "created_utc": 1723930465.0, "score": 143, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1eusny9/the_cheesecake_factory_original_cheesecake/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Copycat versions of Wingstop sauces", "selftext": "So I made some boneless wings or chicken tenders today that is breaded with panko breadcrumbs, flour and eggs. Fry them in 350F oil.\n\nOr If you want your chicken wings crispy, **bake them in a 400\u00b0 F oven for about 40 minutes**. You can reduce the temp of the oven to 170 and keep them in the oven for 20-30 more minutes to make the skin extra crispy.\n\nI only tried to replicate only some of their wings sauces and 1 of their seasonings they make. These are copycat versions.\n\nThis is Danny T's Brennan Cajun SeasoningMakes 2 cups1/2 cup Paprika, 6 tbsps garlic powder, 6 tbsps ground black pepper, 5 tbsps onion powder, 3 tbsps cayenne pepper powder, 3 tbsps dried thyme, 3 tbsps dried oregano.\n\nNotes:\\* Use melted butter instead of butter flavored oil that they use to mix all of their sauces into their wings to cut food costs.\\* Cajun Chef Original Wing Sauce is the hot sauce for their wings and chicken products.\\*\n\nThe right ratio is 4 parts butter, melted and 1 part sauce.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the Wingstop Sauces:\n\nHickory BBQ - 1 cup butter, melted and 1/4 cup Hickory BBQ Sauce. You can use your favorite whether it is Sugar Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ sauce.\n\nMild: 1 cup butter,melted and 1/4 cup Cajun Chef Original Hot or your favorite Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce.\n\nLemon Pepper: 1 cup butter, melted and 1/4 cup McCormick Culinary Lemon Pepper or your preferred choice of Lemon Pepper Seasoning.\n\nLouisiana Rub: 1 cup butter, melted + 2 Tbsps Louisiana Rub + 1 Tbsp Brown Sugar\n\nGarlic Parmesan: 1 cup butter, melted + 2 Tbsps Garlic Powder + Finishing: Sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan.\n\nHot Honey: 1 cup butter, melted + 2 to 3 Tbsps MIke's Hot Honey. If you want sweeter, I suggest adding 2 Tbsps brown sugar or more depending how sweet you want. I believe Wingstop used a Hot Honey Rub because they used it to mix in the sauce and dusted extra on their wings. My suggestions are Herban Farms which only includes dried honey, chili pepper powders.\n\nKorean: I suggest you make your own Korean Sweet and Spicy sauce to capture the full flavor of the chicken wings - 2 Tbsps butter, 1 - 2 Tbsps Gochujang, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 2 garlic cloves minced, 2 tsps fresh ginger minced, 2 tbsps honey, 2 tbsps rice wine or water, 1 tbsp rice vinegar. Heat butter on a saucepan, saute garlic and ginger until garlic is light brown. Add the remaining ingredients and stir until sauce thickens over MEDIUM high heat. Remove pan from heat\n\nToss in cooked and fried chicken wings onto the sauce until wings are fully tossed.\n\nTransfer korean chicken wings to a plate, Sprinkle some sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Enjoy while they are hot!\n\nWS Buttermilk Ranch:1 cup Hellman's mayonnaise, 1.5 cups buttermilk, 2-3 oz Hidden Valley Ranch Mix Restaurant-Style packetsMix all ingredients until it is a flowing consistency.WS Bleu Cheese Dressing:1 cup Hellman's mayonnaise, 1.5 cups buttermilk, 2 tbsps sour cream, 2 tbsp dehydrated onion flakes and 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1/3 cup blue cheese crumbles, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce.Mix until it is fully incorporated and flowing consistency.----\n\nShop Cajun Chef either on Amazon or [here](https://www.cajunchefshop.com/)\n\nMix each sauce with a whisk in a large bowl.

{"title": "Outback Steakhouse Chicken Tenders (OLD RECIPE)", "selftext": "Could anyone figure out or track down the old recipe for Outback's Chicken Tenders? So far my research shows that the people who work at the restaurants get them frozen and just toss them in the fryer. I don't particularly like them, but my wife really liked them and was very disappointed when the recipe changed a few months back. I think this has something to do with Bloomin Brands' push for Tender Shack to have a bigger presence throughout the country, and why have different chicken at these two restaurants? Just a theory, but I think it makes sense.\n\nThe unique thing about Outback's tenders were that the breading was crunchy, but not sharply so. It almost had a \"breadi-ness\" to it, and conformed tightly to the meat. Very uniform color, never dark. The other, more unique, thing was that the breading was strangely sweet, compared to other typical restaurant tenders. Is replicating the recipe as simple as adding sugar into the flour mix?

{"title": "My Top 10 spice blends I usually use at work and at home:", "selftext": "So these are my Top 10 spice blends that I use at work and at Home:\n\nSome are official recipes from chefs that I have used for many years, and others are copycat recipes(maybe better than brand names and store-bought): All of the spice blends are generally 1 cup or 250 grams in yield. You can increase or decrease the original yield on how much you use depending which cuisines or dishes you cook often.\n\nSo these are my Top 10 spice blends that I use at work and Home:s, and others are copycat recipes(maybe better than brand names and store-bought): All of the spice blends are generally 1 cup or 250 grams in yield. You can increase or decrease the original yield on how much you use depending on which cuisines or dishes you cook often. So let's get to the recipes that you are anticipating.\n\nOne thing to note: you can add the salt later on since I want to control if I am cooking and baking it. I use kosher salt ( I prefer Diamond Crystal, Sysco or Morton - depending on the availability of the product. I taste how salty is the salt because not every brand is equal in terms of taste or how it is ground).\n\n\\#1: Italian - 1 part each of dried thyme, rosemary, dried oregano and dried basil. 1/4 cup each of dried thyme, rosemary, dried Italian or Mexican oregano and dried basil leaves.\n\nWeigh or use dry measuring cup to measure for each herbs and transfer in a medium bowl. Use gloves, and hand mix and toss the dried herbs until well blended and combined. Transfer to an airtight container. You can use this to accentuate spaghetti, creamy sauces, other spice blends, pasta dishes and soups.\n\n\\#2 Chinese 7-Spice - 3 Star anise pods, 20 whole cloves, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 Tbsp Sichuan peppercorns husk only, 1 tsp fennel seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and 1/2 tsp ground white pepper.\n\nDry toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon, fennel seeds and Sichuan peppercorn husk on a skillet over Low to MEDIUM low heat. Shake them occasionally until they are fragrant. Avoid burning them. If they are fragrant. Transfer them to a bowl to cool completely. Put all of the contents in a high-speed blender, Nutribullet or Magic bullet. Cover. Pulse on HIGH until the spice blend is in fine powder and well blended. Transfer to an airtight container. Cover and keep in dry place.  \nYou can use this on any Chinese dishes or any dish that require that Chinese 5-spice powder. Use this instead.\n\n\\#3 Garam Masala - a housemade recipe that I use for Indian cooking especially biryani, making sandwich spreads, Indian gravy dishes and even making some raita.  \n82.5 grams coriander seeds, 50 grams cumin seeds, 2.5 grams caraway, 15 grams ground black pepper, 1.5 star anise pods, 1.5\" cinnamon stick or 7.5 grams ground cinnamon, 2.5 Black cardamom pods,7.5 grams whole cloves, 5 grams fennel seeds, 2.5 grams bay leaves and 2 grams dried ginger root.  \nDry toast coriander, cumin and fennel seeds, caraway, whole black peppercorns, star anise pods, cinnamon stick, black cardamom pods, whole cloves, bay leaves and dried ginger root on a skillet over Low to medium low heat. Toss to avoid burning and spices are evenly toasted and until spices are fragrant. If you smell the aroma of the spices, transfer to a bowl and allow to cool completely. Transfer all of the contents to a high-speed blender, Nutribullet or Magic Bullet, cover and pulse on HIGH until it becomes a very fine powder. Let it sit there for few minutes to avoid any dust from flying away once you open it. Transfer to an airtight container, close and store in a cool but dry place.\n\n\\#4  Garlic & Herb Seasoning - This housemade recipe is \"maybe better\" than McCormick's Culinary Garlic Herb Seasoning. You may want to invest buying some hard-to-find spices online. Trust me, it tastes better, freshly made and can be used on multiple cooking applications. Also the orange peel gives it tangy sweet and summery feel of the spices and herb blend. You can substitute the dehydrated orange peel for freshly grated lemon peel but I would increase to 1 tbsp for more lemony taste to it. You can definitely use this for chicken wings, add 3/4 cup butter, melted and slightly cooled then 3 tbsps of the garlic and herb seasoning to coat freshly fried or baked wings.  \n2 tbsps garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 2 tsps Italian seasoning, 2 tsps ground white pepper, 2 tsps dehydrated veggies (carrots, celery and onion) or dehydrated bell pepper blend (red and green bell peppers), 1.5 tsps sweet marjoram, 1.5 tsps parsley flakes or dried parsley leaves, 1.5 savory (summer), 1 tsp granulated orange peel or 1 tbsp freshly grated lemon peel, 1/2 tsp cayenne (adjust for spiciness or heat. You can substitute another type of cayenne pepper or another type of chili powder of choice), 1/2 tsp ground cumin, and 1/2 tsp yellow mustard seeds.  \nCombine all of the spices and herbs in a Nutribullet, cover and pulse on HIGH until it becomes a fine powder spice blend. Transfer to an airtight storage container. Store in a cool and dry place.\n\n\\#5: Cream of soup mix - 500 grams full cream powdered milk, 325 gams ap flour, 60 grams dehydrated veggies, 15 grams onion powder, 15 grams garlic powder. Combine all of the ingredients in a medium bowl until well combined. You can use this to make soup, gravies, creamy sauce and add more mushrooms, meat. 1/2 cup of mix to 1 cup boiling water.\n\n\\#6 CHICKEN OR BEEF BOUILLION BASE POWDER (better than any LKK, Knorr or any bouillion cube, paste, store bought out there) - 110 grams of either Chicken or Beef Stock powder (or bone broth powder), 15 grams rubbed sage, 7.5 grams EACH: Parsley flakes or dried parsley leaves, Dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried Mexican or Italian Oregano or Italian spice blend, garlic powder, onion powder. 5 grams MSG or Accent Flavor Enhancer, optional.  \nThis bouillion base can add umami flavor punch while cooking soups, stews, chowders, rice, sauces, gravies and other sides. This is a better alternative with any flavor based bouillion cube or powder giving an extra umami taste and flavor of your dish.  \nI recommend adding 1 tbsp to flavor rice, side or a gravy. If you were to  make a quick soup, use 1 tsp chicken or beef bouillion base powder : 1 cup hot water.  \nIf you want it vegan then this is the alternative - 110 grams Nutritional yeast\n\n\\#7 CAJUN SEASONING - I have been using this cajun seasoning for many years either at work and at home. Very versatile spice blend - 20 grams salt,  20 grams paprika, 15 grams garlic powder, 15 grams ground black pepper, 12.5 grams onion powder, 7.5 grams cayenne pepper, 7.5 grams dried thyme, 7.5 grams dried oregano.\n\n\\#8 CAJUN SPARKLE - Tnanks BlindDogz for making a copycat of Popeyes Cajun Sparkle. Cajun Sparkle is a secret spice blend that is available at Popeyes but it was available since 2019, and they want this packet available never had any media publicity. Only stories coming from REddit and other social media platforms surfaced when people were raving that this secret spice blend exist at Popeyes. Some people rave about this because they are excellent in fried foods, eggs, sauces, gumbos, gravies and anything you can cook. Follow this post for more info and details on notes how he came up with a better Popeyes Cajun Sparkle. [BlindDogz Cajun Sparkle Copycat Recipe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/i62pds/a_better_cajun_sparkle_maybe/)So here's the housemade recipe - 4 tbsps kosher salt, 4 tsps garlic powder, 3 tsps onion powder, 4 tsps rubbed sage, 3 tsps msg, 3 tsps worcestershire sauce powder, 2.5 tsps Hungarian paprika, 2 tsps tamarind powder, 1 tsps cayenne (for spiciness and taste) plus add 2 tsps Sweet Marjoram (missing herb?).\n\n\\#9: Chai Masala - I prefer this blend as it is warm, sweet and very comforting - 1/2\" fresh ginger,4 whole cloves,1/2 cinnamon stick, 5 green cardamom pods crushed, 1 black cardamom pod split open, 2 teabags of black tea or 5g black looseleaf tea. To make tea, boil 1.5 cups water and spices until boiling over MEDIUM HIGH HEAT. Once it is boiling, remove pot from heat, and let it steep for 5 minutes. Cool slightly. Strain the black tea into warm cups. Add little milk and sugar. Stir and drink it warm. Enjoy!\n\n\\#10: Zaatar - 1 cup or 250 grams - 4 Tbsps Dried Oregano (preferably Turkish or Greek), 4 Tbsps Sumac (one of my favorite spice that is both tangy, lemon sour and pink red in color), 2 Tbsp black sesame seeds, 2 Tbsps white sesame seeds, 2 Tbsps sweet marjoram or marjoram, 2Tbsps dried thyme, 2 tsps fine sea salt optional.  \nMix until well combined and blended into a fine powder. Can be used on pita bread, garbanzos, Lebanese with yogurt and fried pita bread pieces, hummus and many other Greek, Lebanese and other dishes. You can sprinkle it on grilled meats or sandwiches like shawarma, gyro especially something with either beef and/ or lamb.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/18buztl/my_top_10_spice_blends_i_usually_use_at_work_and/", "created_utc": 1701834238.0, "score": 119, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/18buztl/my_top_10_spice_blends_i_usually_use_at_work_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I did read an article on the recipe from the LA Times and they said the key is to refrigerate the dough for at least 48 hrs, and that its very basic, no fancy add-ins, they were mass prodcued at the time. The recipe is very basic, my guess is five ingredients...\n\nIve tried a few recipes and they are close, but the key is either they used BUTTER or CRISCO (vegetable oil) ... My guess is Crisco in the original recipe to get the crunch.\n\nFamous Amos cookies were basic, not fancy at all, and were in their hay day with Mrs Fields cookies.... They are crunchier and smaller but still had the flavor the larger Mrs Fields cookies had... They were almost the same recipe as MrsFields, but just smaller making them crunchy withOUT the soft center as Mr Fields basic cookie... FAmos also had larger cookies IN the store, that were not as popular and they tasted exactly like Mrs Fields.\n\nActually the closet thing that comes close is Nestle Tollhouse cookies, but not quite...Add some pecans to that dough and its kinda close.\n\nAnyone had any luck with a recipe that recreates this little iconic cookie? Anyone else ever had cookies from the Sunset store in Hollywood? We are talking a while back...\n\nUPDATE 3/26: This [shared recipe link](https://mydoseofsugar.com/portfolio/famous-amos-chocolate-chip-cookies/)  seems good, and its close to my recipe with respect to ingredient ratios which Ive been experimenting around with for a while, Ill try this link and report back...Certainly the look of them seems spot on and their proofing time of 72 hours is right on.\n\nUPDATE 3/27: Yes this recipe is as close as you are going to get, Im gunna try a little more white sugar on the next batch, pix [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGO7k_Ae2DndFEAaEWj6oBMmibkpCpA5/view?usp=share_link) and [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19AhPDPmpdzENBtDQ0MdTjYzpXJMgCfaN/view?usp=share_link)  **Top Secret** recipe SOLVED \ud83c\udf08", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/12291ge/famous_amos_cookies/", "created_utc": 1679799634.0, "score": 109, "author": "Strong_Deutan", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/12291ge/famous_amos_cookies/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

It's as basic as can be...yet the ones they serve today don't even taste CLOSE! Make em exactly as I instruct, and you can enjoy that long-lost flavor once again. (In the mid 80's, McDonald's\u00ae began cooking both sides of the meat at the same time, This was to cut cooking time in half. But it also forever changed the flavor of the original hamburgers---ALL of them!) \n\nRay Kroc discovered the McDonald brother's San Bernardino, Cal. restaurant in 1954 while selling mutli-mixers.

In 1952, two years BEFORE Ray Kroc stumbled upon McDonald's, Burger King's founder Keith Cramer got his idea for a burger \"joint\" after visiting with the legendary McDonald bros.)

Do this on waxed paper. *I use a tortilla press with the meat between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.* \n\n Now freeze the patties for at least an hour. (this keeps them from falling apart when you grill 'em) Obviously you'll do this in advance of \"burger time\". It is pretty tough to make patties this small, so if you come up with 9 patties, I'll forgive you.\n\n**The Onions:**\n\nPut the dried onions in a container, oh..like Tupperware...and add water. Water should be a few inches over the top of the onions. (better to have too much water than not enough) Cover, and refrigerate about 1/2 hour. Drain the liquid, and BAM...you have McDonald's little baby onions. Cover again and refrigerate until 'burger time\".\n\n**The Pickles:**\n\nMcDonald's\u00ae pickle slices are unique in flavor, very sour dills. The only product I know of that comes close to the distinctive flavor is HEINZ Genuine Dills. (original sour dill.) But they don't come in slices, so slice your own VERY thin. I can't do it very well with a knife, so I use a K-tel \"dial-a-slice\" home vegetable slicer. ALSO....Vlasic \"original\" dills have that tart flavor. **Make sure they're not \"kosher\" dills.** Wal-Mart\u00ae carries Vlasic ORIGINAL dills, and you have to slice those too. (\\*\\*\\*\\*note, these pickles are pretty small, so slice at an angle....you'll get bigger dill chips.) USE THESE PICKLES ON ALL McDONALD'S\u00ae HAMBURGERS!\n\n**The Buns:**\n\nUse the small, plain cheapo store brand hamburger buns. You know, they come 8 or 12 in a pack. Usually about 59 to 69 cents for a pack of 8. (You'll want to separate the tops, or \"crowns\" from the bottoms, or \"heels\"...as most likely they'll be connected slightly on one edge.) When it's \"burger time\", you'll be toasting the buns. Those instructions are coming up. WalMart\u00ae sells a great product for regular buns---Great Value\u2122 brand \"jumbo\" hamburger buns. They're almost exactly like McDonald's\u00ae buns and a little bigger than the other hamburger buns available at your supermarket.\n\nONE MORE THING: Before you cook these marvelous hamburgers, pre-cut 10 12\"x12\" sheets of waxed paper. You'll need them to wrap the burgers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cooking your Hamburgers!**\n\nPre-heat your oven to warm..its lowest level, this is for later. You're going to need two electric griddles . *I used the stove.*\n\nOne to grill the meat, the other to toast the buns. Pre-heat the meat griddle to 375-400\u00b0, and the bun griddle to about 350\u00b0. (this recipe has you cooking four at a time)\n\n\\*\\*\\*note\\*\\*\\*before starting, make sure to have all of your condiments READY! (because this all happens very fast)\n\n\\#1 -Toast the crowns of 4 buns (tops) Do this by laying them face down on the griddle closely together. Put\n\na dutch oven (pot) bottom side down directly on top of the buns.(open side facing up) This is only to apply hands-free pressure to the buns so they will toast evenly. (Don't use anything TOO heavy like cast iron. You'll smash the buns.)\n\n\\#2 -Lay the frozen patties on the other grill. After about 20 seconds, \"sear\" them by applying even pressure with the back of a metal spatula, and pushing down on the front with your free hand. (careful not to burn your fingers.) Do this only for about 2 seconds...you should hear them sizzle louder while you \"sear\" them. After searing them, sprinkle generously with McDonald's burger seasoning.\n\n\\#3 -At this point, your buns are nearly done. They will have an even tan color when finished. Remove them, and repeat the the \"bun toasting\" process with the heels. (bottoms)\n\n\\#4 -After about one minute since searing the patties, turn them over. Careful, don't tear the side you seared. Add another dash of Seasoning and about a teaspoon of your prepared onions. (Don't be anal and use a measuring spoon...no time...just two fingers and a thumb full.)\n\n\\#5 -Now quickly dress your buns. (crown, or top side) Mustard first....five \"kisses\" the diameter of a pencil evenly spaced in a circle about a half inch from the edge. Then the Ketchup, (use Hunt's if you can) five squirts the size of a nickle..in the pattern found on dice. Place the pickle in the middle.\n\n\\#6 -By the time you finish that, the meat will be done. (about 1 minute or 1:10 after turning) Remove the meat and tilt to the side to allow excess fat to drain off. Use your free hand to hold down the onions. Place patties onion side up on the dressed crown, top with toasted heels. (the burger will be upside-down)\n\n\\#7 -Lay one finished hamburger, still upside-down, in the center of your pre-cut waxed paper. Wrap the paper around the burger tightly. It should resemble a very oblong tube with two open ends, and the burger in the middle. Then wrap the open ends underneath the bottom of the burger so it is enclosed tightly.\n\n\\#8 -Place wrapped hamburger in your pre-heated oven. (remember...oven is just barely on warm) Keep 'em in there about 8-10 minutes.\\*\\*\\*\\* Hey! That's enough time to cook another batch. (if you do cook another batch while these are \"aging properly\", scrape the black stuff and burnt onions to the side before beginning.)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*PLEASE NOTE! Some ovens get too hot even on low, and this may dry out your burger. If they seem dry, next time wrap them tightly and let them sit about 5 minutes. Then ZAP 'em for 15 seconds (one at a time) in the microwave. This will complete the \"Q-ing\" process without over microwaving them like they do now. In fact, they almost taste better this way.\n\n\\#9 -ENJOY!! This is how they used to be. This is how they were MEANT to be. (You might consider toasting your buns first, at least the crowns, to give you extra time to dress them.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dfsbvk/mcdonalds_hamburger/", "created_utc": 1570678827.0, "score": 105, "author": "target022", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dfsbvk/mcdonalds_hamburger/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Taco Bueno Chili Sauce In-Depth Analysis and Hypothesis", "selftext": "I made a few posts across the webs this week about Taco Bueno's secret sauce, one of them was on this sub, and I didn't move the needle much so I decided to investigate. This is what I've come up with in preparation to start attempting recreating this sauce.\n\nFirst, I went to my local 'Bueno right when it opened so that nobody would be in line and I could strike up a conversation with the person at the window (delightful lady btw). She says tons of people ask about the sauce, and she gave me a container of it by itself (not sure if she was being nice or if that's something you can actually order) and she started to say something about \"it's called chili... cheese... something?\" but stopped herself quickly. That might be the name of the sauce on the jugs they get . She told me a few other pieces of info, but we'll get back to that in a moment.\n\nI get back to the house. My wife and I both carefully taste the sauce. I mean carefully... We ran it through multiple taste tests. By itself, on a burrito, Eyes closed, eyes open, after a drink of water, after a saltine, it was comical how hard analyzed the stuff. Anyways, we made some important observations.\n\nIf you've never seen this stuff by itself before, It has a very smooth glossy look and is actually quite orange. That may be why the word \"cheese\" is in the official title, but I seriously doubt there's cheese in it based on the flavor. There's also tiny pieces of meat in it. I think the orange color comes from an insanely high amount of fat content (and some of the spices are orange after frying), and the word \"cheese\" in the name is to disguise the fact that it contains a LOT of fat, thus the wonderfully addictive flavor. It does not have the consistency, flavor, smell, or any other indicator that there is even a tiny bit of cheese in it. Also, the orange color is more concentrated at the top of the liquid, and if anyone has seen a liquid with a lot of not-perfectly-suspended fat in it that's been sitting a while, the fat concentrates at the top.\n\nI then started disassembling my items. A combo burrito and a taco/nacho salad of some kind. Both had a good amount of ground beef crumbles in them. I call them ground beef crumbles because they are very tiny and actually fairly dry. The meat crumbles were delicious and the other ingredients prevent the overall product from seeming dry, but I started putting two and two together. The highly seasoned and tasty flavor of the meat was similar to the flavor of the sauce, also the meat pieces as an ingredient and the pieces in the sauce were the same sizes.\n\nBack to what the delightful window lady said previously. She indicated that the meat comes packaged and pre-cooked. They throw it in a pan or something and heat it up. Makes sense. The dry crumbliness of the ground beef could easily be the product of a \"twice fried\" system, if you will. So here's what I think is going on:\n\nBack at the initial food processing place, they are cooking up big ass vats of very finely ground beef, adding lots of tasty spices (basically \"taco\" seasonings), until browned, and all the fat is rendered out. They drain the fat from the meat very well, and save it. This wonderfully meat and spice-seasoned fat is the base of the chili sauce. They package up probably 90% of the meat, freeze it and send it to the stores. The other 10% goes back into the sauce AFTER this next step. I believe they are making a slurry of beef broth and corn starch (or whatever the cheapest type of starch is that they can buy in massive quantities) and adding it to the rendered meat fat. My guess is that it's a 50/50 ratio, but I'll be testing it. At this point, I think they are using some kind of bad ass industrial immersion blender to suspend the fat in the slurry to sort of homogenize the mixture and thicken it slightly. They might add additional spices at some point, but maybe not due to how incredibly seasoned the beef by itself is. This is something else I'll be testing. Then they add back that 10%, or whatever % held back meat was, back into the sauce.\n\nThe product is a very glossy, very flavorful, slightly thickened and extremely satisfying (like most things that contain a lot of fat) sauce.\n\nThe reason I don't think this is too far off is because the ground beef at 'Bueno, while not overly dry, is dry enough to make you wonder where the fat went. Successful fast food places use every part of every ingredient, and I don't think they are using super lean meat. That fat has to go somewhere (side note, I think that fat is also added to their beans).\n\nI still have to test this, but in summary, I believe the reason that none of the copycat recipes have nailed this flavor anomaly is because none of them contain like 50% beef fat. I think that's why it's so damn addictive and why it's so difficult to replicate.\n\nI'll update y'all with my findings as I test kitchen this over the next day or two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdding images as per requested.\n\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/nYIDEsw \n\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/0P1sQZJ \n\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/GSheBH5 ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/uo62ok/taco_bueno_chili_sauce_indepth_analysis_and/", "created_utc": 1652375810.0, "score": 101, "author": "None", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/uo62ok/taco_bueno_chili_sauce_indepth_analysis_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Walt Disney World Popcorn", "selftext": "Over the years, I've had a lot of people ask me about what's in the popcorn that makes it so good.  Being at Disney probably helps, but the main reason is the oil.  It's called Pop-N-Lite but there's nothing light about it. It's a dark orange color and is made with canola, coconut, and corn oil.  It's also the only thing about it that hasn't changed in a decade.  \n  \nOver the years they've made changes that have affected overall quality IMO, so I purposefully chose the best ingredients we've used in the past ten years in order to get the best taste possible.  The Orville Redenbacher has a better texture and MUCH fewer dud kernels than the Pop Secret that is used now, I think because it actually pops at a slightly lower temperture.  (You could previously pop a white batch if you forgot oil, but with PS it burns the hulls and makes them unpopable). The Popcorn and Nut salt is important because it uses a \"flake\" instead of a grain, meaning it has a larger surface area for its weight and clings better to the popcorn.  \n  \nOfficial Batch Recipe:  \n  \n- 13oz [Louana Pop-N-Lite Butter Flavored Popcorn Oil](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/louana-1-gallon-pop-n-lite-popping-oil/999LOU13843.html?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GoogleShopping&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInMeksLeU5QIVTsDICh3cWwAIEAQYASABEgK3qvD_BwE)  \n  \n- 1 Tablespoon [Diamond Crystal Popcorn and Nut Salt](https://shop.justpoppin.com/Popcorn-Salt--Nut-Salt-Shaker_p_200.html?gdffi=39a55cf16566464c80d8018155921476&gdfms=D4FCA531D85441C583EB61CC0AC8228E&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo9Ha_riU5QIVEpJbCh237AwmEAkYASABEgI1cvD_BwE)  \n  \n- 26oz [Orville Redenbacher Popping Corn](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338572317&mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fp%2F22031750432%3Fiid%3D303316217916%26thm%3D1000) \n   \n*Essentially a 2:1 ratio of seed to oil, and one teaspoon of salt per cup of seed, or to taste.*  \n  \n  \n1.

{"title": "Tazo Pumpkin Spice Chai Tea Latte Concentrate", "selftext": "I've seen many \"copycat\" recipes of the Tazo chai tea and pumpkin spice version, but none tasted close to the actual concentrate. They were more boujee versions for a Starbucks pumpkin spice latte which is a different drink. They would always double the black tea resulting in way too heavy of a tea taste in a latte drink, or add pumpkin which is not even on the ingredients list on the packaging. So here is my version that tastes almost identical minus the preservatives. I mix 50/50 with milk and add a shot of espresso for a dirty pumpkin spice chai tea latte. Can also use in the summer for iced drinks. I've had good luck keeping it in the refrigerator for 1 week. It may last longer, but the tea will start to oxidize so be mindful.\n\nBuy a qt of it in season and compare it.

For stronger use 5 minutes. Type of black tea will also alter flavor slightly (I use Walmart generic black tea bags or Tetley)\n5. Remove tea bags and then stir in vanilla\n6.

{"title": "Trader Joe's Chantilly Cream Vanilla Bean Mini Sheet Cake ", "selftext": "Hey all! Yesterday I had this insane craving for Trader Joe's Chantilly Cream Vanilla Bean Mini Sheet Cake, but I was sooo not driving 45 mins to my nearest store. I'm also not a professional baker by any means, so there was no way I was attempting to recreate this cake on my own. I tried to search the web and here on reddit for any recipes (shoutout to the person in\u00a0the Baking subreddit\u00a0who tried to recreate the cake 2 years back!) but eventually (and maybe definitely controversially) decided to use a bit of AI to my aid. I sent a picture of the back ingredient and nutrition labels of the TJ's cake to ChatGPT and asked it to help me recreate a recipe for the original cake. The outputted recipe looked suspiciously good, so I had to try it.\n\nTo my immense surprise, the result was scary similar to the real thing! Maybe not 100% exact, but for someone who's as obsessed with this cake as I am, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.\u00a0*Super*\u00a0moist, great crumb, and really buttery and flavorful. If anything, it's a great starting place for an even better attempt at recreating this cake! I'd love to hear your thoughts and any tweaks you all might have to make this copycat recipe even closer to the original. Feel free to share your results and suggestions\u2014I'm so curious and maybe a bit too passionate about this cake lol.\n\nHere's the recipe along with some notes from my bake:\n\n***Trader Joe\u2019s Chantilly Cream Vanilla Bean Mini Sheet Cake Copycat Recipe***\n\n*Cake Ingredients:*\n\n* *1 cup (200g) cane sugar*\n* *2 cups (240g) unbleached enriched flour*\n* *1 tbsp malted barley flour (optional)*\n* *1 1/2 tsp baking powder*\n* *1/2 tsp baking soda*\n* *1/4 tsp salt*\n* *1/2 cup (120ml) canola oil*\n* *1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream*\n* *1/2 cup (120ml) milk*\n* *3 large eggs*\n* *1 cup (240ml) buttermilk*\n* *1 tsp clear vanilla extract*\n* *2-3 tsp vanilla bean paste*\n\n*Frosting Ingredients:*\n\n* *2 cups (240g) powdered sugar*\n* *1 tbsp cornstarch*\n* *1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened*\n* *8 oz (225g) cream cheese, softened*\n* *1 tsp clear vanilla extract*\n* *2-3 tsp vanilla bean paste*\n\n*Instructions:*\n\n1. *Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch rectangular cake pan.*\n2. *In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, malted barley flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.*\n3. *In the bowl of your stand mixer, add the sugar, canola oil, and heavy cream. Using the paddle attachment, beat on medium speed until well combined and creamy.*\n4. *Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and vanilla bean paste, and mix until combined.*\n5. *With the mixer on low speed, alternate adding the dry ingredients and the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.*\n6. *Slowly add the milk and mix on low speed until the batter is smooth.*\n7. *Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until completely cool.*\n8. *In the bowl of your stand mixer, combine the softened butter and cream cheese. Beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy.*\n9. *Add the powdered sugar and cornstarch. Mix on low speed using the paddle attachment until combined.*\n10. *Add the vanilla extract and vanilla bean paste, and mix until well combined.*\n11. *Once the cake is completely cool, spread the frosting evenly over the top of the cake using a spatula.*\n12. *Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the frosting to set.*\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* *I didn't feel like buying malted barley flour just to use a singular tablespoon. Instead, I substituted that with a tablespoon of cornmeal out of curiosity, as I and others have noted how the original TJ\u2019s cake sort of resembles cornbread. I\u2019m not sure if the cornmeal made a noticeable difference, but I didn\u2019t hate it*\n* *The cake batter itself was quite thin, which had me scared, but it turned out fine imo*\n* *I truly think that the vanilla bean paste is what made this cake so yummy. ChatGPT originally called for 1 vanilla bean each in the cake batter and the frosting, but I didn't feel like splurging and instead just googled the conversion for vanilla bean paste*\n* *I added a bit of whipping cream to the frosting out of curiosity, which sort of messed up the consistency. I had to end up adding a lot more powdered sugar, so the frosting was quite sweet and not quite as buttery as TJ\u2019s. So, probably don\u2019t add the whipping cream like I did lol*\n\nBesides that, I\u2019m so impressed with how this cake turned out! I wasn\u2019t expecting the final product to be anything near the original, so kudos to ChatGPT. I hope this helps anyone who\u2019s as obsessed with this cake as I am!

The refried beans are very similar everywhere we went, so I assume it's a traditional preparation around Guadalajara or Jalisco area.

I have put together most of the seasonings and preparation that went into them, but **I can't figure out what type of bean was used**. I plan to go to the local Fiesta market in my area (Dallas) and do some test kichening, but I was wondering if anyone knows what kind of bean they use in Guad./Jalisco, and has some insight into the preparation for their traditional refried bean preparation. Thanks in advance!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Note. I don't think it was pinto beans or the more common variety of beans used because it was so light in color and the flavor was so mild.

For the bun, Fudds had an in-house bakery, where plump, steaming rounds of pure heaven were pulled from ovens all day long.\u00a0 That smell of freshly baked bread was the first thing to hit you walking into a Fudds, and the last thing to bid you farewell, enticing an inevitable return.\u00a0 For the meat, they had an in-house butcher shop where the beef was freshly ground daily, with whole forequarters hanging from the ceiling, and a window where you could actually see the butchers at work (if that was your thing).\u00a0 And finally, for the toppings, a famously bountiful self-serve buffet of fresh veg, condiments, and of course, self-serve pump stations of that hot, gooey, molten-gold cheese sauce.\u00a0 Beyond the burger, the fries were equally exceptional\u2014wedge cut, skin-on potatoes, deep fried in canola oil to an amber crisp, liberally seasoned with \u201cFudds Spice\u201d\u2014a proprietary blend of seasonings (heavily favoring paprika) that, when also sprinkled on the burger itself as it hit the griddle, created a flavor amalgamation across the plate that resulted in something other-worldly, and something which humanity had neither experienced before, nor since.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, the closure of your local Fudds was a devastating event.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t around when JFK got whacked, but I imagine the level of grief was similar.\u00a0 The initial penetrating shock gave way to a deep, steady depression, and finally, a measure of unbridled anger I had never known.\u00a0 Why should my life even continue if there\u2019s no more Fudds?\u00a0 One day, in a moment of rarified personal strength and industry, I determined that if I could no longer go to Fudds, I would make Fudds come to me.\n\nIt has been that singular endeavor, my brothers, born of comprehensive research and an unwavering commitment to home-kitchen experimentation, that has led me back to the Promised Land, and to this post, which I offer for the benefit of humanity at large.\u00a0\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n**THE MEAT:**\n\nSchweid & Sons - Butcher Blend\n\n[https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/](https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/)\n\nYou can also go with their other blends like Signature or Heritage. Additionally they offer USDA Prime chuck, American Wagyu (their \u201cKatana\u201d blend), and several other options. Experiment with your tastes and what\u2019s available but these are all excellent blends for premium burger patties. I recommend buying the brick of mince rather than the pre-formed patties as it allows you to create a slightly looser pack. Even though Fudds now uses pre-formed, pre-ground patties of all-chuck, I feel that going with these higher-grade blends greatly enhances flavor and results in a burger closer to the OG Fudds in-house, freshly ground taste of memory.\u00a0\n\n**THE BUN:**\n\nBoulangerie Ace Bakery - Gourmet Buns - Classic\n\n[https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/](https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/)\n\nYou\u2019re looking for a premium bakery bun with that shiny golden dome, but ideally NOT a brioche bun. These are the closest I\u2019ve found where I live, but many bakeries may offer premium buns that fit this description.\u00a0\n\n**THE SPICE:**\n\n[https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html](https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html)\n\nThis is the special ingredient that brings it all together and ultimately makes Fudds\u2026well, Fudds. It\u2019s easily made at home. Follow the recipe to the letter, and multiply proportions as needed to ensure your home is never without the essential magic that is Fudd Spice.\u00a0\n\n**THE FRIES:**\n\nWild Fork Foods - Potato Wedges\n\n[https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa\\_Ap3Mt4soZ7](https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa_Ap3Mt4soZ7)\n\nTBH this was the trickiest component. French fry aficionados may prefer to attempt freshly cut wedges, but these are very close, if not spot-on, and without the hassle. The trick is finding wedges that aren\u2019t overly pre-seasoned because you need to add the Fudd Spice to make these taste correct, and most frozen wedges come with factory seasoning that tampers with (or completely ruins) the authenticity.\u00a0 Bake, air-fry, or, for the closest match, do what they do at Fudds and deep fry in canola oil, drain, and then sprinkle liberally with the magic dust!\n\n**THE CHEESE SAUCE:**\n\nRico\u2019s Premium Cheddar Cheese Sauce\n\n[https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/](https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/)\n\nYes, it\u2019s from a can, but it\u2019s spot on. If you want to go a fresher, more culinarily-sophisticated route, Godspeed, but I\u2019ve been going to Fudds for decades and trust me, for the express purpose of recreating the authentic Fudds experience in your maw, this is the cheese sauce you\u2019re looking for.\u00a0\n\n**THE TOPPINGS BAR:**\n\nThis goes without saying, but any home replication of that glorious fresh market of fixin\u2019s should include: sliced tomato, onion (multiple colors), lettuce (at least two leaf varieties), pickles, salsa, relish, jalape\u00f1o and other pepper varieties, and of course every condiment known to man, never to exclude the basic staples of ketchup, mustard, mayo, 1000 island, and anything else your little heart desires. Needless to say the cheese sauce as mentioned above will factor formidably into the final equation as well.\u00a0\n\n**BURGER PREPARATION:**\n\nFor authenticity it is essential that you cook your burger on a griddle. If you don\u2019t have one, a frying pan or cast iron skillet will substitute in a pinch.\u00a0 Do not, however, attempt to grill over an open flame. You will be rendering all the above meticulous preparations null and void, and doing yourself a great disservice in the bargain.\u00a0 If your griddle or skillet is unseasoned or rarely-used, you may consider adding a tablespoon of canola, avocado, or vegetable oil to the heated surface before laying down your patty. Remember, we are going for authenticity here, and the burger you remember from Fudds was not born of a pristine, virginal cook top, but rather of the greasy remnants of hundreds if not thousands of other burgers born before it on that same cook top. \u00a0\n\n1. Form your beef into 1/3 or 1/2 pound patties taking care not to pack too tightly.\u00a0\n2. Pre-heat griddle on medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil if desired, as suggested above.\u00a0\n3. Place the patty down onto the pre-heated griddle and sprinkle liberally with Fudd spice.\u00a0 This is how they did it at fudds\u2014they did not pre-season the patties before hitting the griddle, as you can see from video footage of Fudds cooks in action from the 1990\u2019s glory days.\u00a0 Cook for 4-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired temperature).\u00a0 Press the patty gently downward with your spatula not more than twice during this initial phase of cooking. Do not \u201csmash\u201d or cut the patty.\u00a0 Just enough pressure to aid in even cooking within and without, while simultaneously facilitating more caramelization on the outer rim. You want it Fudds style\u2014thick, juicy, with a respectable char on the outside.\n4. Flip the patty and cook for an additional 3-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired cook temperature).\u00a0 During this second phase you may elect to sprinkle the Fudd spice again, though, from what I have gleaned from archival footage on YouTube, the OG Fudds cooks did NOT bust a second sprinkydink.\u00a0 During the last minute of cooking, place a square (or squares) of your preferred cheese on the patty and cover with a metal bowl or cooking dome.\u00a0\n5. At some point during phase two of cooking the burger, brush melted butter on the inside of both halves of the bun, and place, butter side down, on the griddle in order to toast.\u00a0 Remove the buns when the insides achieve a golden crisp, being careful not to let them burn.\u00a0\n6. Place the toasted bun halves on a plate, insides facing up, and remove the perfectly cooked burger from the griddle with your spatula, deftly sliding it atop the bottom bun.\n7. Top with fixin\u2019s of your choice and finally enclose the masterpiece with the top bun.\u00a0\n8. Serve alongside your freshly cooked wedge fries, and sides of the hot cheese sauce, and tell heaven you\u2019ll call them back tomorrow.\u00a0\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "created_utc": 1745353029.0, "score": 152, "author": "AceRutherfords", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Pf Chang's (Non-US location) Vegetable Spring Roll Dipping Sauce and Spicy Tuna Sushi Red Sauce", "selftext": "Hello, I have recently moved out of my country of origin where one of my favorite restaurants was Pf Chang's. The two dishes I most enjoyed were the vegetable fried spring rolls (or egg rolls) because of it's very distinctive dipping sauce and the spicy tuna sushi roll, because they used a sauce that tasted dissimilar to sriracha for their spicy tuna. I have been trying to brainstorm ideas on how to recreate this and I would love to hear suggestions on how to recreate these flavors:\n\n\\- The spring roll sauce is very tart and acid, not so much sweet as is usual for me. It is quite translucent and transparent in color with a slight orange hue, and you can see some chili pepper flecks floating around. It does not taste like sweet chili sauce, it is more of an acid base sauce. I was trying to analyze its taste and it doesn't really taste like normal vinegar to me, nor do I get the taste of rice vinegar, lime, lemon or pineapple. The tartness isn't citrusy at all, but it lacks the bitterness of vinegar and is punchier than rice vinegar (which I first thought of since it's not as bitter as regular vinegar). It also doesn't have the taste of wine vinegar. \n\n\\- The spicy tuna sauce is red and very opaque like gochujang, not translucent and gummy like sriracha. But it doesn't have a fermented taste at all like gochujang. \n\nI have searched online and haven't found a copycat recipe for these elements yet. I appreciate any suggestions.\n\nedited for grammar.

{"title": "The actual KFC recipe", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have a recipe that I found a long time ago, apparently it is the current KFC corporate recipe, as it was written in 2010. There may have been slight changes to the recipe up to now but I doubt it since the ingredients are easy to get.\n\nThe secret is said to be in the marinade, as it gives it an unmatched flavor. What it says it contains is \u201cpotassium\u201d but I did some research and through experiments I came to the conclusion that it is tetra potassium pyrophosphate. It is the only molecule that works well, since other products that contain potassium would be \u201cpotassium nitrate\u201d, \u201cpotassium chloride\u201d, \u201cpotassium carbonate\u201d and these do not give our meat organoleptic characteristics. Bottle Concantrate Chicken is an ingredient that is mentioned for the marinade and it contains other main ingredients such as chicken concentrate, corn starch, salt, sugar, chicken fat, citric acid, natural flavors.\n\nThe marinade can vary by country and region, as many KFCs are franchises and are not authorized to carry all of the KFC (now Kentucky Fried Chicken) corporate ingredients. Some marinades may contain other potassium and sodium phosphates, as well as sodium bicarbonate. All of these help to keep the meat juicy and slow down the oxidation process of fats and meat, which gives the meat a rancidity (refrigerated flavor). They can be more antioxidants like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid. But the former are acids which could unbalance the pH of our marinade.\n\nAnother secret is the breading part, as skimmed milk powder and egg powder are used to combine it with the flour.\n\nMSG is essential since it is found in almost all processed foods in all fast food restaurants. It is a widely used flavour enhancer, although another commonly used enhancer is yeast extract, which is an extract of amino acids and nucleotides from the yeast Saccaromyces Cerviseae that gives foods a umami flavour. The sugar present in chicken concentrate is also essential, since for curing chicken and other meats, a little sugar is needed to start the curing process of the meat and enhance that umami flavour even more. We all know that ferments (umami) have a different flavour than the original foods, for example anchovies (fish), fish sauce (fish), miso paste (soy, rice), soy sauce (soy beans), hams (fresh meat), cheddar and parmesan cheese (dairy derivatives), Worcestershire sauce (soy and mollusks), sausages (fresh meat), pickled olives (olive trees), among many others\u2026\n\nI leave the document in the photo.

CAKE. I\u2019ve ever had in my life, no exaggeration. In the span of two weeks, I ordered the cake from them on DoorDash 5 times. That's once every other day. I haven't tasted anything better in my life. It's supposed to be a twist on sticky toffee pudding I believe but the cake is denser and chewier than regular sticky toffee pudding, and the BEST part is the SAUCE - perfect texture, perfect sweetness, so caramelly, not to heavy not too light. Best part is when it's refrigerated it gets a little thicker and chewy, ribonny, l'm not sure how to describe it but l've attached pictures lol. Anyways I moved out of LA recently and I've been craving it sooo badly and trying sticky toffee puddings at other restaurants / from the grocery stores but nothing compares - all the ones I\u2019ve tried taste too soft/moist and dissolve in my mouth, and the sauce tastes sweet in a different way? Idk how to explain it, but it makes me think this isn\u2019t a traditional \u2018sticky toffee pudding\u2019 - like I said its denser chewier, and I know the caramel sauce is made with brown sugar, maybe it uses some type of syrup? I don\u2019t know how to explain it but the sauce has more depth and tastes richer but not \u2018heavy\u2019/cream forward. On the menu all it says is \"**medjool dates, brown sugar caramel**\", but I know both the cake and the sauce contain **dairy and/or egg** (according to the restaurant staff). If anyone knows how to recreate it or thinks they would know how to, PLEASE PLEASE let me know, I\u2019m so desperate (down horrendous) lol. I\u2019ve attached pictures of it and the menu.

I'm not the only one who feels this way LOL, here's a Yelp review I found: \"*if you try anything it has to be the\u00a0best cake\u00a0ever that they serve. it's the\u00a0best thing that's ever been in my mouth.

It\u2019s kinda salty, a little sweet, not spicy, maybe some garlic. It\u2019s also has something that puckers your mouth a little if you try it on its own. It\u2019s not sour, but will make your mouth tighten up and pucker a little.\n\nIf you think you have a recipe. I\u2019d be grateful for details. If you think it\u2019s soy, can you tell me if it\u2019s plain, dark, or some other version. Same if you think it\u2019s vinegar. White, rice, etc. if the sweetness is sugar, brown or white? \n\nThat kind of detail is very helpful. I know from experience, it can matter. I\u2019ve been experimenting with bbq sauces and many contain vinegar. We had Braggs with the mother, and it\u2019s too strong. It\u2019ll kick your teeth in. I\u2019ve found generic, filtered store brand ACV or even white are much milder. You\u2019d think white would be bland, but it just tastes clean in a vinegar base sauce.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard that some of these sauces change drastically if you heat them to a simmer for a while, vs just combining.\n\nMy best guess, though it doesn\u2019t turn out for me, is soy, vinegar, garlic powder, and sugar. Not sure about brands or ratios. There may be something obvious I\u2019m missing. I\u2019d love to make it for lots of uses though.

The color was different as it was like a dark tan from the cookie dough. When cookie was cooled completely. It had the crispy edges of the rolled oats, and wheatgerm. But the centers are chewy, little sweet and mini chocolate chips sets them apart from the sweetness that imparts bittersweet flavor. The texture is just perfect like the one from Specialty's.\n\n\\++++\n\nI baked the Specialty's Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate chip cookies on 350F for 14 mins. It spread way too much because of the amount of light brown sugar it had. Tasted little burnt and the edges burnt. Not pleasant.\n\nIt was a failure for the 3rd time.\n\n\\++++++\n\n2nd, I tried making the dough of the Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe from Advanced Baking and Pastry from Wiley Publishing. I modified the recipe and adapted how Specialty's would have it. The cookies came out as thick, chewy, hearty cookie. Not too sweet but little buttery flavor. I would add little more salt next time. It is a great cookie. The recipe is provided below of the successful cookie between the 2.\n\nLet them cool on pan until cooled completely and the insides are set and firm.\n\nAdvanced Baking and Pastry Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate Chip Cookies:\n\n340 g butter, softened + 390 g light brown sugar (liquid ingredient) + 198 g all purpose flour + 28 g whole wheat flour + 28 g bran flour + 3 g baking soda + 5 g salt + 2.5 g ground cinnamon + 28 g wheatgerm + 369 g rolled oats (old-fashioned rolled oats is okay) +10 ml vanilla extract + 284 g (5 large eggs) + 250 g mini chocolate chips (choose Guittard Almost MIcro chocolate chips. Other brands wouldn't cut it because real chocolate flavor is lost. And after cookies are baked, it tends to get crunchy without any chocolate flavor.\n\nCombine all flours, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, wheatgerm and rolled oats in a large bowl. Mix with a spoon until evenly distributed. Set aside.\n\nCream together the butter, light brown sugar and granulated sugar until sugars are completely dissolved and no grains are apparent. Add eggs one at a time. Add the dry ingredients and fold in both mixtures until the dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in the mini chocolate chips into the cookie batter.\n\nScoop 2oz cookie dough and transfer to an airtight container. Cover and chill in fridge for up to 24 to 48 hours. My fridge is on the cold side, so it took about 12 to 15 hours.\n\nNext day, preheat oven to 375F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Transfer cookie dough onto lined baking sheets with 2\" apart of every cookie. Bake cookies at 375F for 14 minutes until light golden brown and the insides are already set but chewy and soft.\n\nRemove cookies from oven, then cool the cookies on baking sheets until cool completely. Transfer them on wire racks to cool completely and let the cookie be set and firm on the insides.\n\nGood luck making this cookie. It is one of my favorites.\n\nAlso, I recommend adding toasted pecans or walnuts, chopped for a nutty texture in the cookies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glq0pt", "created_utc": 1730984883.0, "score": 18, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glq0pt/journey_remaking_specialtys_oatmeal_wheatgerm/", "html_title": ""}

So of course, I used poblanos in my recipe too!\n\nSince moving in 2020, I\u2019ve been on a quest to find a mock recipe that captures that same flavor and feeling I remember. After scouring the internet with no luck, I decided to try my hand at recreating it myself. These stuffed poblano peppers bring back the nostalgia of my teenage years, and I hope they\u2019ll become a comfort food for you, too. Enjoy!\n\n**For the Stuffed Poblanos:**\n\n\\- 4 large poblano peppers, halved and seeded\n\n\\- 1 cup cooked, shredded chicken (seasoned with a pinch of smoked paprika and chili powder)\n\n\\- 8 oz cream cheese, softened\n\n\\- 1/4 cup diced pickled jalape\u00f1os\n\n\\- 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n\n\\- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n\n**For the Breading and Frying:**\n\n\\- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\\- 2 large eggs, beaten\n\n\\- 1 cup Panko breadcrumbs\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp chili powder (optional, for extra kick in the coating)\n\n\\- Oil for frying (vegetable or canola)\n\n\n\n**For the Tomatillo Ranch:**\n\n\\- 4 tomatillos, husked and rinsed\n\n\\- 1/2 cup sour cream\n\n\\- 1/4 cup mayonnaise\n\n\\- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro\n\n\\- 1-2 tbsp lime juice\n\n\\- 1 jalape\u00f1o (seeded for less heat, if desired)\n\n\\- 1 clove garlic\n\n\\- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the Poblanos: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Place the halved poblanos on a baking sheet and roast for 10-12 minutes, until slightly softened (this will make stuffing easier). Let them cool.\n\n2. Season the Chicken: Mix the shredded chicken with smoked paprika and a pinch of chili powder to add a smoky, grilled flavor.\n\n3. Make the Jalape\u00f1o Cream Cheese Filling: In a bowl, combine the shredded chicken, cream cheese, diced pickled jalape\u00f1os, Monterey Jack cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth.\n\n4. Stuff the Poblanos: Spoon the filling into each poblano half, pressing it in to secure.\n\n5. Bread the Poblanos:\n\n   \\- Set up a breading station with three bowls: flour in the first, beaten eggs in the second, and Panko breadcrumbs mixed with chili powder in the third.\n\n   \\- Coat each stuffed poblano first in flour, then dip into the eggs, and finally press into the Panko breadcrumbs, ensuring they\u2019re fully coated.\n\n6. Fry the Poblanos:\n\n   \\- Heat about 1 inch of oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat.\n\n   \\- Fry each stuffed poblano for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels.\n\n7. Make the Tomatillo Ranch: In a blender, combine tomatillos, sour cream, mayonnaise, cilantro, lime juice, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic. Blend until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n8. Serve: Serve the crispy, fried stuffed poblanos with the tomatillo ranch on the side for dipping.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glfrpp/jose_peppers_jumbo_stuffed_jalape\u00f1os_tomatillo/", "created_utc": 1730945373.0, "score": 11, "author": "SpiritualReward3696", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glfrpp/jose_peppers_jumbo_stuffed_jalape\u00f1os_tomatillo/", "html_title": ""}

Most of the new baked goods were retired during new product launches. This post contains the seasonal cookies.\n\nPecan Sandies:  \n6 oz (170 grams) finely chopped pecans + 8 oz (225 grams) bread flour + 8 oz (225 grams) cake flour + 1/4 tsp (3 grams) salt + 12 oz (340 grams) unsalted butter softened at room temp + 3 oz (85 grams) powdered sugar + 1 tbsp (15 ml) vanilla extract. Powdered sugar\n\nMix together the pecans, bread and cake flours, and salt in a large bowl until they are all fully incorporated. Set aside.\n\nUsing paddle attachment, add the butter and powdered sugar in bowl of stand mixer. Cream together both ingredients until light in color and the texture is aerated and fluffy. Add in vanilla extract and mix until fully incorporated. Incorporate the flour-nut mixture at low speed, mixing just until combined. Chill the dough until it is firm enough to work with.\n\nDivide the dough into 3 equal pieces about 12 oz (360 grams) each. Roll each piece into a ripe of 8 inches in length and cut into 10 pieces from each rope.\n\nRoll each pieces between the palms to make round balls, and place them on sheet pans lined with parchment paper. Press down lightly to keep the balls of dough from rolling, but don't flatten.\n\nBake at 350F/ 175C for about 20 minutes, or until cookies are firm to touch and golden brown. While the cookies are still warm, roll them in powdered sugar to cover them heavily.\n\nGinger Molasses: [https://www.theflouredtable.com/triple-ginger-molasses-cookies/](https://www.theflouredtable.com/triple-ginger-molasses-cookies/)\n\n1/2 cup (113 gramss) unsalted butter softened at room temp + 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar + 1/2 cup (100 grams) light brown sugar + 1 large egg room temp + 1/4 cup (85 grams) Grandma's Brand Molasses + 2.5 tsps fresh ginger finely grated + 1.5 tsps ground cinnamon + 1 tsp ground ginger + 1/4 tsp ground cloves + 1.5 tsps baking soda + 1/2 tsp kosher salt + 240 grams all-purpose flour + 1/2 cup (75 grams) crystallized ginger finely diced + 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar, for rolling.  \nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar on medium-low speed until blended. Increase speed to medium and continue mixing until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl with a spatula. Add egg and mix until fully incorporated.\n\nAdd molasses and mix until blended. Add fresh ginger, ground spices, baking soda and salt, and mix on low speed until completely blended in. Scrape down sides of bowl with spatula. Add the flour and mix on low speed\u00a0*just*\u00a0until a few streaks of flour remain.\n\nRemove mixing bowl from stand mixer and add crystallized ginger (if using). Use your spatula to fold in the last bits of flour and to distribute the crystallized ginger throughout the dough. Do not overmix.\n\nScoop 2 oz or 3.75 oz cookies. Roll the cookie dough balls and cover them on the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar on parchment paper lined baking sheets. Place the trays in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.\n\nNext day, thaw cookies for 15 minutes at room temp from the refrigerator.\n\n* Directly prior to baking, position oven rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C, Gas Mark 4). Place a piece of parchment on a standard half sheet baking pan. Evenly space 8 balls of sugar-covered dough onto the parchment lined sheet. (I do two rows of 3, plus 2 in the center). Store remainder of dough in fridge until ready to bake.\n* Bake each sheet for 12-13 minutes. This will result in a cookie that is chewy, still moist, and slowly bends rather than snaps. If you prefer a crisper, crunchier cookie, increase baking time by a minute or two. Remove from oven and let cool on pan for one minute.\n* After one minute, carefully transfer cookies to a cooling rack.\n\nWhite Chocolate Macadamia Nut - already posted the chocolate chip cookie base that Specialty's uses - [https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gav96f/specialtys\\_chocolate\\_chip\\_cookies\\_other\\_cookies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gav96f/specialtys_chocolate_chip_cookies_other_cookies/)\n\nGood luck baking, and let me know what were the results and experiences baking these treats.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gd0k39/specialtys_seasonal_cookies_and_close_copycats/", "created_utc": 1729994208.0, "score": 29, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gd0k39/specialtys_seasonal_cookies_and_close_copycats/", "html_title": ""}

This is the most requested recipe from Specialty's cookie fans, and here it is:\n\nThis is one of my favorite cookies so far.\n\nSpecialty's cafe and bakery Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate chip cookies:\n\nThis makes 12 - 3.75 oz or almost 1/2 cup cookies\n\nStep A:\n\n7 oz Light brown sugar, packed + 10 oz rolled oats (add-in) + 3.75 oz all purpose flour + 1.75 oz whole wheat flour + 1.25 oz  and 2.25 tsps Wheat Bran Flour (add-in) + 1.25 oz  and 2.25 tsps Wheatgerm (add-in) + 1.75 tsps salt + 1 tsp ground cinnamon + 9.75 oz unsalted butter softened at room temp.\n\nCombine all of the dry ingredients like brown sugar, rolled oats, all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, (wheat) bran flour, wheatgerm, ground cinnamon, salt in a bowl of stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix on LOW SPEED on KA 3 or 4, BRV 3 - 4 for approximately 1- 2 minutes.\n\nAdd in the softened butter, and mix on LOW SPEED until you see pea-sized crumbles of flour mixture and butter mixed together for approximately 1 minute.\n\nSTEP B:\n\nAdd in 1 large egg and 0.7 oz vanilla extract in a small bowl. Beat them together until combined. Add liquid ingredients onto the flour butter mixture until dough comes together. If the cookie dough, doesn't come together add 1 more egg if necessary.\n\nSTEP C:\n\nAdd in 11 oz mini semisweet chocolate chips or Guittard Almost Micro chocolate chips. You can order them on the Guittard website, or Amazon. But you can use any brand of your choice (Hershey's, Baker's Choice, Whole Foods and your choice of dark chocolate chopped finely. Fold the mini semisweet chocolate chips briefly on LOW SPEED until all of the ingredients come together as a sticky cookie dough briefly.\n\nPortion the cookie dough 3.75 oz or how big you want them.

Then place 4 on a quarter baking sheet or 6 on a half sheet and allow 1 to 2 inches apart for the cookie dough.\n\nBake @ preheated 350F for 13 to 16 minutes, or if you have a convection oven 325F for 14 to 17 minutes. I use a Breville Smart oven at 325F for 13 to 15 minutes until egde of cookies are golden brown, crispy, and middle and centers are soft to touch.\n\n\\*\\* If you want to look like cubes of cookie dough. Place them on a parchment paper lined 8 x 8\" or 9 x 9\" square pan. Freeze them for 6 hours or refrigerate them for 12 to 24 hours. Then thaw them at 15 to 20 minutes, then cut them into 2.85\" squares. Place them on baking sheets and follow similar procedures baking them. Also if you are baking bigger cubed cookies allow the cookies to bake longer. I would suggest to bake 1 first, and adjust how long it goes for like 14 to 18 minutes. Take note how much time it bakes the cookies. Adjust and bake accordingly.\n\n\\*\\* Cookies are hearty, chewy, with a lot of oatmeal and mini chocolate chips gives it some wholesome feeling of bittersweet chocolate flavor embedded in this.

Add an egg and vanilla extract. Beat well for 2 minutes.\n* Add the dry ingredient mixture and stir until just combined.

{"title": "Chef Boyardee's Spaghetti Sauce", "selftext": "I made this sauce after watching a Chef Boyardee video from, Tasting History, on YouTube. \n\nIt's the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sauce:\n* 2 lbs (1 kg) canned peeled tomatoes, or fresh if they\u2019re in season (I use 2 cans of delallo san marzano style, plucked out of the can, discarding the can juice)\n* 6 tablespoons (90 ml) extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 cup (140 g) diced onion\n* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n* 1/2 cup (70 g) diced carrot\n* 1 lb (1/2 kg) lean ground beef\n* 1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper\n* 5 medium basil leaves, sliced into strips\n* 1/2 cup (40 g) sliced baby bella mushrooms\n* Serving:\n* 8 ounces (225 g) dried spaghetti\n* 2 tablespoons (28 g) butter\n* 3 tablespoons (20 g) grated parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Chop up the tomatoes, then put them through a food mill or press them through a conical sieve./fine mesh strainer You want to separate all the juice and pulp from the seeds (a wooden pestle is handy if you use a conical sieve, or it\u2019s possible to press so hard that you break your spatula). Set the tomato sauce aside and discard the seeds.\n2. Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sprinkle it with about half of the salt. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes. Turn the heat down if the onions start to brown.\n3. Add the carrots and cook for another 5 to 6 minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.\n4. Add the meat and break it up into small pieces. Sprinkle the rest of the salt and the pepper over it. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the meat is no longer pink.\n5. Stir in the tomato sauce and the mushrooms. Raise the heat a bit and bring the sauce to a boil. Let it boil for a few seconds, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Place the lid on the pot, slightly ajar and let it cook for about 40 minutes.\n6. After the 40 minutes are up and the sauce has thickened, stir in the sliced basil, put the lid back on (ajar), and cook for another 5 minutes.\n7. Cook the spaghetti according to the package\u2019s directions. Drain it and return it to the pot. Add the butter and the parmesan. Toss to combine.\n8. Dish up the spaghetti and ladle the sauce over it.

Only had to tweak the ingredient amounts:\n\n**Marinade**  \n4 lb. Chicken Breast/Thighs (I use both), cut up TINY (1/4\" pieces, food processor works perfect here)  \n2 Limes, juiced  \n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce  \n3 Tbsp Taco Seasoning [(I use this](https://www.amazon.com/Birch-Meadow-Spicy-Seasoning-Flavorful/dp/B0CLYW5HDN?crid=J12LC89CN2BT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WH-1lt5hp_Dbq82QFet22a2hAMtGiEkfleWrF2VItZmBGTqnCuoR5UmNQNzLpsSNVKIx1jpFfEJ2cfLmKyccHyfYAF_nYIZ4bEcsGKe9LB_gA6H-xSGWftPfvW04SEaECD0HRiksMmrClbzL2u6Z5sJEDCy1yqt-9YvPk2-3vRWOZgUKCjcRKefqAVHOi6hOSubm1ZDK7fVFp4CG8zAbGyN04DdffzKsAz032YiKBPsUToBqphWU4D_bAh2YIQFAXOQh1cfONsjakx4Cjhq8u3rd9TVrpMAafV-IiBq63AE.byTl0Z2CCgtwQzhnuCaXwoTcMzYbjrTak88bzVC9Lr4&dib_tag=se&keywords=taco%2Bseasoning%2Bbirch%2Band%2Bmeadows&qid=1731983849&sprefix=taco%2Bseasoning%2Bbirch%2Band%2Bmeadow%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-6&th=1))  \n1 Tbsp Knorr Chicken Bouillon Powder  \n2 tsp Corn Starch  \n1/2 tsp Baking Soda  \n1/4 tsp Garlic Powder  \n1/4 tsp Onion Powder  \n1/4 tsp Cayenne (or Paprika for less heat)  \nDrizzle of Cooking Oil\n\n1.

Smash chicken into an even layer, then set a timer for 4 1/2 minutes. At 2 minutes, flip; after another minute, break up and stir fry until cooked through (should be around when the timer goes off).\n4. Set aside cooked chicken in big bowl, then Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the other batches.\n5.

Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, remaining one tablespoon of granulated sugar, and salt in a stand mixer.\n\n\n\nAdd the yeast mixture and melted butter to the flour mixture. Knead with the dough hook on medium speed until it is smooth and elastic, about eight minutes. Transfer to a bowl coated with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about one and a half hours.\n\n\n\nLightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Punch down the dough and transfer to a work surface; knead a few times. Cut in half and gently shape into two three-by-six-inch loaves (do not overwork the dough). Place the loaves three inches apart on the prepared pan. Lightly spray the loaves with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until puffy, 30 minutes to one hour.\n\n\n\nMake the topping: Whisk the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small baking dish. Whisk the melted butter and corn syrup in another small baking dish.\n\n\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two nine-by-five-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a two-inch overhang on all sides. Cut four deep slashes across the top of each loaf (the loaves will look deflated). Dip each loaf in the butter-corn syrup mixture, turning to cover, then coat with the cinnamon sugar, making sure to get the sugar in the crevices. Place the loaves in the prepared pans. Drizzle with any remaining butter mixture and sprinkle with any remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Lift the bread out of the loaf pans using the parchment overhang and transfer to a rack. Let cool in the paper, about 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, salt, melted butter, and three tablespoons of milk in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in up to two more tablespoons of milk as needed to loosen. Drizzle on the warm loaves or serve on the side for dipping.\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S KATSU CURRY - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_DgczQFxbB/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_DgczQFxbB/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S FIRECRACKER SHRIMP - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_sxgtNhFIL/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sxgtNhFIL/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S CHILI CHICKEN RAMEN - [https://www.wagamama.us/recipes](https://www.wagamama.us/recipes)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S MONTE CARLO BISCUITS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S SCOTCH FINGERS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger)\n\n\n\n**Arnott's Scotch Finger**\n\n* **Prep time: 10 mins** \n* **Cook time: 25 mins** \n* **Makes: 16 biscuits** \n\n\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* **170g salted butter, softened** \n* **\u2154 cup (90g) soft icing sugar** \n* **1 cup (165g) plain flour** \n* **1\u00bd tsp baking powder** \n\n\n\n**Method**\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 160\u00b0C. Grease a 30cm x 20cm rectangular slice pan and line base and sides with baking paper, extending paper 2cm above edge of the pan.\n\n\n\nStep 2\n\nUsing an electric mixer, beat the butter and icing sugar for 2 mins or until pale and creamy.

Then run the knife gently \u00bd way into the shortbread pieces, not touching the bottom, to make the finger indent.

{"title": "Famous candy bars, chocolates and candies in America recipes made by Claire Saffitz", "selftext": "My family watched Gourmet Makes and Claire Saffitz Recreates, and it is interesting to watch every episode as the environment, vibe and how she recreates famous American candies, chocolates and candy bars gives a glimpse what she has been through, even moments when you are so close but their are mishaps and accidents along the way. We enjoyed watching these episodes and gives us a glimpse that these famous American candies and sweets can be replicated at home with better flavor, texture using pantry and other ingredients available at home. Of course, they are some you have to order or purchase at specialty, supermarket and restaurant supplies stores.\n\nThis post will be useful as corporations cut down costs by eliminating few ingredients, changed formulas and replaced with other ingredients. Furthermore, they sacrificed flavor over texture. Still they raised prices due to inflation circumstances. Some \"bad\" corporations do become greedy of profits over the quality of what they sell. For example, I was kind of disappointed when I tasted Hershey's new Kitkat - the new version of milk chocolate was too waxy and lost its milky, creamy texture and flavor of milk chocolate. It lost its flavor that I usually remember back in the 1980s. On 2024, It tasted like oily chocolate coating that lacked salt, sugar and some milk solids. The wafer recipe is similar. But I will be buying a more affordable chocolate biscuit filled with cream and covered with milk or dark chocolate. Or better, make my own. Or maybe buy the imported UK or Canadien candy bar.\n\nThis is a 2nd post of what you can make at home from Bon Appetit, and Claire Saffitz.

And wondered if these cookies are good for a snack or dessert attack. These are the recipes they had provided during the pandemic, if some of you love their cookies. Here are the recipes. Below you will find recipes where you can bake them in an air fryer.\n\n# Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nRecipe:\n\n* \u00bd cup unsalted butter\n* \u00bd cup brown sugar\n* \u00bc cup white sugar\n* 1 room-temp egg\n* 1 \u00bd cups flour\n* 1 tsp baking soda\n* \u00bc tsp salt\n* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Microwave the butter until it\u2019s almost fully melted. Combine with the white and brown sugar, then beat in the egg and vanilla for about 30 seconds. Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt, then fold in the chocolate chips until completely mixed together. Place them in fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Line the air fryer racks with parchment paper or foil. Use a cookie scoop (we love\u00a0[***this one***](https://www.mytoque.com/collections/utensils/products/norpro-stainless-steel-scoop-35-mm)\u00a0from Toque Blanche!) and place cookie dough in the fryer baskets.

Mix together butter and 1 \u00bd cups of sugar. Slowly add in eggs, vanilla, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt until fully combined. Put in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Scoop the dough with a cookie scoop and roll the balls in the remaining sugar and cinnamon.\n\n3. Add parchment paper to the air fryer racks, then gently place dough balls on the parchment paper. You should be able to fit two to five scoops depending on how big your air fryer is.\n\n4. At 340\u00b0F, fry for four minutes, or until the edges look crispy.

Finally, add flour in slowly, bit by bit \u2013 you don\u2019t want to add it all at once! Let them chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2.

This way they cook evenly and won\u2019t melt into each other despite the limited space.\n\n2.. Follow the directions to a T! Air fryers are not your conventional ovens, so don\u2019t expect them to bake the same way (there\u2019s a reason they only go in for five minutes instead of nine to eleven).\n\n3.. If you\u2019re not baking from scratch, lower the temperature about 20\u00b0F less than the recommended temp on the package and cook for 20% less time.

{"title": "jollibee spicy sparkle on their fried chicken", "selftext": "So on 2021, Jollibee introduced a spicy version for people who can take heat well in the US market which focuses on the chili heads and those demographics that belong in Central America, West Coast and South America and regions that enjoy hotter peppers above jalapenos, serranoes and above higher scoville units.\n\nTo tap the markets, the spicy version is what they preferred. It was marketed as fried chicken that had a spicy marinated which is in the chicken, and a spicy sparkle applied after the fried chicken has been cooked. They sprinkled spicy sparkle all over the chicken. The \"fry man\" who is responsible from applying water, then breading the chicken and frying into their pressure cookers. then responsible putting them in heat warmers that is ready for service. If you were to order spicy version, they sprinkle a spicy sparkle all over the chicken, put a spicy flag on the chicken. So servers and expediters serve the right chicken to customers.\n\nOn 2023, they changed the recipe and made a kind of a ripoff and cost-effective method to change the recipe on the spicy sparkle. They added the spicy sparkle on oil form. So instead of sprinkling it directly onto cooked fried chicken. They changed their recipe to annatto oil with added spicy sparkle  plus a cayenne pepper extract remake recipe which is applied using a spray bottle with a wide hole nozzle. A lot of people don't like it because it is not as delicious as before, and addicting and changed their spicy sparkle. This version is kind of a ripoff. Most of the time when I go to the nearest Jollibee, they just ran out of the Spicy chicken that I wanted. They just put a sign on the front counter that spicy chicken is not available until further notice.\n\nI tasted the new spicy ChickenJoy at another location of Jollibee. I didn't like the spicy version because the spiciness stayed on your tongue after you eat it and it stayed on your tongue. You had to drink a lot of soda or the pineapple quencher to wash it off your tongue.\n\nSo I have experimented a spicy sparkle that I reminisced when they had their spicy ChickenJoy in 2021 to 2023. The origins of the spicy sparkle is a very simple recipe that is derived from Taiwanese popcorn chicken sold at night markets, and a common Cantonese use of Jiao Yan or translated as salt and pepper.\n\nIt is a trade secret, so I am speculating this might be their seasoning blend for their fried chicken. I had tried it several times cooking some chicken tenders or popcorn chicken. These recipes are pretty close. The spicy sprinkle has to be applied when cooking freshly cooked fried chicken, not when you buy fried chicken. Unless if you are reheating it on a microwave or air fryer. Spray some oil over chicken, then sprinkle the spicy sparkle, and let it sit for few minutes that is ready to be eaten. However, most Filipinos and others think there's no chinese 5-spice. but the amounts are very minute in terms of their spice blend. But it is there.\n\nFurthermore, on this post I will include the breading mix, spicy sparkle and simple marinade for their fried chicken shown below:\n\njollibee's fried chicken seasoning blend:  \n7 grams jollibee fried chicken seasoning blend + 7 grams salt + 7 grams ground white pepper.\n\nHOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN FRIED CHICKEN SEASONING BLEND LIKE JOLLIBEE:\n\nhow to make your own s&b curry powder: yield: 6 tbsps  \n1 tbsp ground turmeric+ 2 tsps ground coriander seeds+1.5 tsps salt +1.5 tsps fenugreek seeds, toasted & ground, 1.5 tsps ground cumin +1 tsp orange peel dried, finely ground +3/4 tsp msg + 1/2 tsp rubbed dried sage + 1/2 tsp ground black pepper +1/2 tsp cayenne pepper or gochugaru (fine red pepper flakes) + 1/2 tsp dried thyme + 1 bay leaf, crushed + 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg + 1/4 tsp dried ground green cardamom pods.\n\nplus homemade chinese 5-spice: yield: 2.25 tsps  \n1/2 tsp ground cinnamon + 1/2 tsp ground fennel seeds + 1/2 tsp ground ginger + 1/2 tsp ground star anise powder + 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  \nCombine all of the spices in a spice grinder. Pulse for 2 minutes until they are finely grounded. Let it sit for few minutes until the spice dust settles down with the spices. Open the spice grinder. Transfer the spices into a mason jar or an airtight container.\n\nYou can use the spices for your next fried chicken adventure, or make your own japanese curry.\n\nJollibee's spicy sparkle:  \n2 tsps dark chili powder or California chile' powder + 1 tsp garlic powder + 3/4 tsp ground white pepper +1/4 tsp ground black pepper + 1/2 tsp chinese 5-spice powder+ 1/2 tsp salt + 1/3 tsp paprika +1/4 tsp msg.\n\nBreading mix:  \n500 grams all-purpose flour + 500 grams potato starch + 7 grams jollibee fried chicken spice blend + 7 grams salt + 7 grams ground black pepper + 7 grams garlic powder\n\nMarinade (old before 1990s):  \n1.5 to 2 lbs chicken (wings, drumstick, ribwing \\[both breast and wing\\], thighs, breasts) + 2 tbsps lo-salt(potassium chloride)+ 2 tbsps salt + 1/3 cup Knorr chicken concentrate\\[organic Knorr chicken bouillion powder\\] + 5 cups water + 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns + 4 garlic cloves smashed + 2-3 bay leaves. if spicy version, few drops of siling labuyo hot sauce \\[you can substitute Crystal or Louisiana for a similar spicy flavor profile\\].\n\nStir the marinade in a large bowl or cambro container. Add in all of the chicken. Cover with plastic film, or cover with lid if using cambro container. Store in fridge and marinade for 24 hours. Next day, strain the chicken and discard the marinade. Wash the chicken briefly. then return on pan lined with paper towels to pat dry.\n\nNew marinade (after 1990s and onwards):  \n1.5 to 2 lbs chicken (wings, drumstick, ribwing \\[both breast and wing\\], thighs, breasts) + 2 tbsps silver swan or lauriat or any soy sauce + 2 tbsps salt + 2 Tbsps Knorr chicken concentrate\\[organic Knorr chicken bouillion powder\\] + 5 cups water + 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns + 4 garlic cloves smashed + 2-3 bay leaves. if spicy version, few drops of siling labuyo hot sauce \\[you can substitute Crystal or Louisiana for a similar spicy flavor profile\\].\n\nsame procedure as above.\n\nStart with a very small batch to try this recipe out!\n\nIn the Philippines, there are a lot of fried chicken places that popped up as street food style. They marinate their chicken, have a variety of dipping sauces, serve it with rice which is a staple. Others serve it with java rice which is annatto oil with garlic fried rice. Others have about 5-6 dipping sauces to go while customers eat their fried chicken like Korean BBQ, Sweet and Spicy Korean, Gravy, White Gravy, Spicy Banana Ketchup, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Signature Hot sauce, Garlic Butter Sauce. Chicken is a popular meat choice over there as it is seen on many dishes. And it is cheap like chicken pieces are sold by the popular demand of the part like breast, thighs, drumsticks, wings, ribwing or airline as we call it here. The price range from $0.65 to $2. Then rice is just like $0.25. I mean a fried chicken meal is like $3 to $4.50 over there, but you get more for the buck to serve the masses. Filipinos love food so much even though if it is affordable and brings joy, and many more memories.\n\nPeople cannot afford Jollibee because of inflated prices on most goods there. Inflation on every product we consume has double all over. And Jollibee has decreased their portion sizes, made major cost-effective measures (which is a rip-off and don't patronize many restaurants that do this business practice and the products are not worth their are current value) and raised their prices. So more mom and pop businesses popped up to sell a variety of fried chicken at their cities, towns to satisfy cravings among Filipinos.\n\nAlso, if you think it doesn't taste right. Make few samples of the spicy sparkle and adjust it according to your taste buds. That way you can decipher or maybe crack the code of their spicy sparkle.\n\nIf you are still adventurous and curious about tasting what Taiwanese popcorn chicken or those huge XL chicken taste like:\n\nI will write another post about this:\n\nHere's a recipe of Jiao Yan or salt and pepper from Cantonese translation.\n\nhow to make your own chinese-5 spice powder using like Taiwan's night food market street food style:  \n1 tsp garlic powder + 1 tsp ground white pepper + 1/2 tsp chinese 5-spice powder + 1/3 tsp chili powder +1/4 tsp msg.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbnvwa/jollibee_spicy_sparkle_on_their_fried_chicken/", "created_utc": 1725763551.0, "score": 50, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbnvwa/jollibee_spicy_sparkle_on_their_fried_chicken/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I would suggest adding the syrups directly to your espresso drinks as opposed to making their concentrates. It looks like they want to incorporate those powders for added heath benefits, and decrease the sugar by adding more cold water in their concentrates. I thought they are trying to skimp what Monin syrups taste like in reality. If you apply Monin syrups to espressos, martinis, alcohols and other mocktails. Their flavored syrups are already subtlely sweet but you can taste its natural flavor. I am against this company's recipes diluting the main flavored products by using water to decrease the food costs. But this is so cheap they made this practice for their seasonal drinks. I think this is a whole ripoff!\n\nYou could make your own blueberry concentrate by doing this instead if you wanted the full flavor of blueberries - 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries +3 oz or 3 tbsps granulated sugar or your sweetener of choice + 1/2 lemon, juiced. Cook blueberry juice until the fruit has been fully cooked and extracted. Stir until sugar has been dissolved completely and blueberries have soften and extracted their juices over medium heat for 15 minutes.\n\nStrain the blueberry concentrate with a fine mesh over a large bowl to remove any solids like the skin. Let it cool completely.\n\nI would follow the similar recipe when making the blueberry concentrate, add 12 oz cold water. Stir. Store in a squeeze bottle or tall vertical mason jar. No need to add blue spirulina and beetroot powder for additional color, but you can put it in for added health benefits.\n\nFollow this recipe for making lavender concentrate from a previous post written a few days ago :\n\nyield: 3/4 cup lavender syrup\n\n3/4 cup or 6 oz granulated or cane sugar (or your sweetener of choice)\n\n3/4 cup or 6 oz hot water\n\n2 tbsps culinary-grade dried lavender buds\n\nAdd sugar and water to a small saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring frequently.\n\nAdd dried lavender buds and stir.

So I took this from another Filipino website that featured some of the popular Filipino restaurants, and popular food items among us before they exported their brand to other countries worldwide where OFWs and other nationalities can try their menu items.\n\nLittle did I know that Jollibee opened its first restaurant in 1998 at Daly City, CA in the US.\n\nIf you are curious what is their old original recipe, here it is:\n\nOriginal Chickenjoy:\n\nIt is said that it can marinate 1 to 2 pounds of fryer chicken pieces, but you can use wings, ribwings (airline chicken), drumsticks, thighs, and breasts.\n\n\\*Their chicken supplier is Cargill Philippines.\n\n\\*Zenith Foods Corporation is the commissary that handles all of JFC and other food brands. Their production commissary handles all  of spices, sauces, pies, noodles, ChickenJoy and other products to make popular items from Jollibee. Then it is distributed to different warehouses all over the world to their own restaurants. They are all make the marinade and marinate it here on their commissary. So we don't know specifically what is inside the marinade.\n\n2 tbsps LoSalt Reduced Sodium Salt ( you can eliminate this if you cannot find it) + 2 tbsps kosher salt + 4 tbsps MSG or Maggi Magic Sarap + 1/8 tsp garlic powder + 1/3 cup of bottled Knorr Organic Chicken Concentrate + 5 cups water.\n\nMix all of the ingredients above in a big bin. Soak and submerge 1 -2 lbs of chicken. Cover and then refrigerate for 24 hours.\n\nHow to bread and cook their chicken:\n\n8 pieces of chicken, marinated\n\n2 large eggs, beaten + 1 cup milk (mix until dissolved completely in a medium dish)\n\n1 cup all purpose flour + 1/2 cup cornstarch + 1/2 cup potato starch + 2 tsps ground white pepper + 3 tbsps salt + 1 tsp MSG (ajinomoto or maggi magic sarap) + 1/8 tsp garlic powder +  1 dash paprika (for slight red in color after being fried or cooked). Mix all of these ingredients in a deep dish until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Set aside.\n\nAdd 6 cups Crisco shortening or vegetable shortening into a pressure cooker over medium heat until it reaches 400F. It is better to fry these chicken outside at the patio or backyard to avoid burning curtains or the whole house. \n\nOr you could fry chicken on a dutch oven and preheat at 400F. Just be careful when frying, and maintain it over MEDIUM heat. You would use about 3 to 4 cups shortening when using a dutch oven depending on how large it is.\n\nSubmerge chicken onto the egg mixture, and coat the chicken and dredge until fully coated and make sure breading mix are inside the skins to make sure it is fully coated.\n\nCarefully but quickly drop your chicken, or you can put it over a spider spatula and deep fry the chicken into a pressure cooker, Close the lid and cook for 10 minutes (8 minutes pressure frying it, then release  the pressure and air inside. Then cook for additional 2 minutes to finish frying the chicken).\n\nChicken should be golden, so transfer them on a wire rack over a baking sheet to let excess oil or fat drip onto the baking sheet while it is still cooling. Repeat these procedures for the remaining chicken pieces.\n\n++++\n\nJollibee Hamburger (or Yumburger):\n\n1 pound Angus ground beef (very typical in the Philippines to buy Australian Angus beef as it is imported and cheaper than local beef) + 10 small hamburger buns + 10 Bread and butter pickle slices + 10 dried minced onions + hamburger seasoning (4 tbsps salt+ 2 tbsps Accent MSG or Magic Sarap+ 1 tsp ground black pepper + 1/4 tsp onion powder. Mix all ingredients and transfer to shaker)) + hamburger sauce (1/2 cup Lady's Choice sandwich spread + 1 tbsp UFC Sweet Banana Ketchup + 1.5 tsps Yellow mustard)\n\nDivide the angus ground beef patties into 9 or 10 equal portions form into balls. then put each ball of hamburger patty over wax paper or 5 \"x 5\" square hamburger patties, then flatten to 1/4\" thick and 4 inches in diameter patties. Stack on top of each other. Wrap with plastic film. Then freeze a  minimum of 1 HR.\n\nThe dried minced onions is similar to McDonalds where you can buy at specialty groceries, Costco, Walmart which is found on the spice aisle. You just need 2 tbsps dried minced onions : add enough cold water to cover the onions in a tupperware container. Cover and let it sit for 15 minutes until you have some rehydrated onions for assembling the burgers.\n\nMix the sauce in a small bowl until combined.\n\nCook patties for 2.5 to 3 minutes per side until grilled and well done. Don't forget to season with hamburger seasoning on each side. Transfer to plate to make your Yumburger.\n\nToast the buns over a skillet or toaster oven until light golden. Add 1 tbsp  special burger sauce and spread it onto the heel of the bun. Add seasoned hamburger patty on top. Add cheddar cheese or sliced Eden cheese. Place the crown on top.\n\n+++++\n\nChickenJoy Gravy:\n\n2 tbsps butter or ChickenJoy Shortening (when you cooked the fried chicken from) + 2 tbsps all purpose flour + 1/2 cup milk + 1-10.5 oz Swansons Low Sodium chicken broth, 1/4 tsp ground white pepper.\n\nMake a roux by either melting butter or using the cooked shortening from the ChickenJoy that you had cooked earlier). Then add all purpose flour until you make a dark brown roux over MEDIUM HIGH HEAT for 3- 4 minutes on a saucepan. Add the chicken broth and the milk until it makes a chicken gravy. Season with ground white pepper. Taste if it taste like chicken gravy, if not season with little salt. Enjoy and serve warm with fried chicken.\n\nMushroom Gravy:  \nYou can do a similar process making a mushroom gravy. Make a roux by melting butter then adding all purpose flour until the flour is cooked to dark brown. Add 1 tbsp TJ Umami Mushroom seasoning to the mix. Add milk to tighten the gravy. If you want more umami taste, add the mushroom stock from the Shiitake mushrooms after you submerge them. You can eliminate this step and just add 1 - 2 tbsps water. Season with ground white pepper, and salt. \n\nThis is great if you are making burger steaks with the hamburger patties, then putting on the mushroom gravy, and adding sliced button mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms on top served with steamed rice, or better yet - garlic fried rice.\n\nJolly spaghetti - one of the users said that this recipe comes close to 99%, and here is their take on the Jolly spaghetti. You will find most of the ingredients at Weee!, Filipino or any Asian grocery stores and supermarkets elsewhere.\n\n1 kg spaghetti noodles (Royal but another brand will do- texture is softer than Al dente which is typical Filipino preference. But you can cook al dente, if you like) + 1 cup sliced Purefoods or Martin's Tender Juicy hotdogs (the red kind but you can use beef low-sodium hotdogs), sliced to 1/4\" + 1.5 packs of White King Fiesta Sweet blend sauce + 1 small bottle of UFC (not Jufran - way too sweet than this brand) 320grams or 11.29 oz Banana Ketchup + 2 medium white onions, peeled and chopped + 4 garlic cloves, chopped + 1 cup Del Monte (tangy tomato taste) or Hunt's (thick and hearty sweet tomato taste) tomato sauce + salt and ground black pepper to taste.\n\nCook spaghetti noodles over boiling water and use some salt. The texture should be little soft than al dente. Drain the pasta water, and transfer the spaghetti noodles over an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Set aside.\n\nAdd 2 tbsps canola oil on a large pot and preheat oil. Saute' the onions until translucent, then add the garlic until golden, add the 1 kg ground beef until cooked all the way through and well done. Add the sliced hotdogs until cooked. Add the White king sweet blend spaghetti sauce, ufc banana ketchup and the tomato sauce. Stir until all of the ingredients have come together over MEDIUM HEAT for 10 minutes. Decrease heat to LOW and simmer the sauce for additional 30 to 45 minutes, then season with salt and ground black pepper.\n\nTo serve this, ladle 1 cup spaghetti noodles on a plate. Scoop 1/2 cup or more of the spaghetti sauce over the noodles. Then grate some Magnolia's Quickmelt cheese or Kraft's processed cheddar or any semisoft white cheddar on top. Serve and enjoy!.\n\n++++++\n\n\n\n \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f5aqy8/old_jollibee_recipes_from_the_1990s_or_earlier/", "created_utc": 1725064532.0, "score": 52, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f5aqy8/old_jollibee_recipes_from_the_1990s_or_earlier/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Arby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread Recipe", "selftext": "So I searched on Uncle Phraedus - Hungry Browser on numerous occasions searching on secret recipes of numerous items. Here are some great find [HERE!](https://www.hungrybrowser.com/phaedrus/mainindex.htm)\n\nArby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread:\n\nthe person who shared the recipe is the person who developed the Arby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread. i've never eaten at arby's, but i hear rave reviews about the bread  \n  \n1 cup water  \n1 teaspoon salt  \n1/4 cup vegatable oil  \n1/4 cup honey  \n1 cup whole wheat flour  \n1 3/4 cup bread flour (or all purpose flour... which is what i had)  \n1 pkg. yeast  \n  \ni accidentally doubled the recipe and made two loaves... which was a good thing, because it vanished.  \n  \nthis is a great bread and technique for a bread that children will eat, because you fool them into eating healthy. also, along this note, the dough was quite wet for me, i added a good amount of flour when kneading... i'm going to use that opportunity to add \"thirsty\" ingredients to make it healthier (oats, wheat germ, flax meal). don't let the wet dough scare you.  \n  \nthis is the technique... which is VERY IMPORTANT for the soft squishy bread i was looking for.  \n  \n1. At 10:00 pm start sponge: mix all of the water, the whole wheat flour, and yeast in a large bowl. Use a spatula or wire wisk to mix thoroughly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.  \n  \n2. Early next morning: add remaining ingredients. Mix a few minutes until well incorporated. Cover again with plastic wrap and let sit (autolyse) for 30 minutes.  \n  \n3. Knead for 10-12 minutes. Dough will initially be very sticky. After 8 minutes the dough should be somewhat tacky. If needed this is the time to adjust your water or flour depending on whether the dough appears too wet or dry. Continue to knead another 3-4 minutes until gluten is developed. Mixing times depend on the flour, the mixer, the weather, etc but you will notice a change in how the dough balls up at the point of gluten development- knead another minute or two after this point.  \n  \n4. Place in lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap. After 30 minutes gently stretch dough slightly from each side towards center like an envelope gently stretching the dough from the sided to center. Flip over, cover again with plastic wrap, let rise another 20 minutes until not quite double in size.  \n  \n5. Turn oven on to 400 degrees. Grease loaf pan. Let rest for 10 minutes. Form gently into tight loaves, place in bread pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until not quite double, about 40-45 minutes.  \n  \n6. Slash loaves with a serrated knife \u00bc inch deep on the diagonal 5 times - rather than one long center cut. This ensures a better final shape. Place loaf in the hot oven on middle rack, quickly throw \u00bc cup of water on oven floor after loading loaf. Be quick to minimize heat loss and do not hit the light! After 5 minutes open door and throw another \u00bc cup of water on oven floor. At 10 minutes throw another \u00bc cup on the floor, shut door and then lower oven to 375 degrees. Bake another 40 minutes until 201 degree internal temperature.  \n  \n7. Remove from oven. Remove loaf from pan, place on wire rack to cool.  \n  \n8. Optional: hold a cold stick of butter with a napkin and put the end on the bread covering the top of the loaf with melted butter to keep a softer crust.  \n  \n9. Optional: After two hours or so when loaf is faintly warm place in plastic bag. The tiny bit of residual heat will cause bag to lightly mist inside which will ensure a soft crust that is more child friendly. Caution: doing this too soon will result in way too much moisture so make sure loaves are just about fully cooled.  \n  \n10. Optional: slice, and freeze unused portion. Loaf will stay fresh 4 days without spoilage before you need to put unused portion in the refrigerator.  \n  \n  \nyes, this is a bit long. but i'm a relatively new bread baker and this is a combination of the help from two people walking me through the process, step-by-step.  \n  \nif a term/technique is unclear, let me know and i'll explain.  \n  \nthis makes the BEST sandwich bread that has come out of my oven.  \n  \ni got this help from\u00a0[THEFRESHLOAF.COM](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/)\u00a0the people there are awesome and willing to share ALL their secrets.\n\n+++++", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f3tt7p/arbys_market_fresh_sandwich_bread_recipe/", "created_utc": 1724905654.0, "score": 24, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f3tt7p/arbys_market_fresh_sandwich_bread_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Fuddruckers Burgers and Fries at Home-- FULL MEAL PREPARATION", "selftext": "Any burger purist knows the glory that once was Fuddruckers, and that in its heyday, it truly was the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Hamburger,\u201d as their signage so proudly declared.\u00a0 Today Fudds is in a state of near-extinction.\u00a0 Spotting one, especially a mega-Fudds built in the early 90\u2019s, is like spotting a northern white rhino in the wild.\u00a0x Most of them have been closed, and the ones remaining suffer from cutbacks in quality, offerings and experience so egregious that they\u2019re nearly unrecognizable. \u00a0\n\nThe concept was simple: in order to make the world\u2019s greatest hamburger they needed to take the three basic burger components\u2014bun, meat, toppings\u2014and provide the best version of each, ever offered, period. For the bun, Fudds had an in-house bakery, where plump, steaming rounds of pure heaven were pulled from ovens all day long.\u00a0 That smell of freshly baked bread was the first thing to hit you walking into a Fudds, and the last thing to bid you farewell, enticing an inevitable return.\u00a0 For the meat, they had an in-house butcher shop where the beef was freshly ground daily, with whole forequarters hanging from the ceiling, and a window where you could actually see the butchers at work (if that was your thing).\u00a0 And finally, for the toppings, a famously bountiful self-serve buffet of fresh veg, condiments, and of course, self-serve pump stations of that hot, gooey, molten-gold cheese sauce.\u00a0 Beyond the burger, the fries were equally exceptional\u2014wedge cut, skin-on potatoes, deep fried in canola oil to an amber crisp, liberally seasoned with \u201cFudds Spice\u201d\u2014a proprietary blend of seasonings (heavily favoring paprika) that, when also sprinkled on the burger itself as it hit the griddle, created a flavor amalgamation across the plate that resulted in something other-worldly, and something which humanity had neither experienced before, nor since.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, the closure of your local Fudds was a devastating event.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t around when JFK got whacked, but I imagine the level of grief was similar.\u00a0 The initial penetrating shock gave way to a deep, steady depression, and finally, a measure of unbridled anger I had never known.\u00a0 Why should my life even continue if there\u2019s no more Fudds?\u00a0 One day, in a moment of rarified personal strength and industry, I determined that if I could no longer go to Fudds, I would make Fudds come to me.\n\nIt has been that singular endeavor, my brothers, born of comprehensive research and an unwavering commitment to home-kitchen experimentation, that has led me back to the Promised Land, and to this post, which I offer for the benefit of humanity at large.\u00a0\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n**THE MEAT:**\n\nSchweid & Sons - Butcher Blend\n\n[https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/](https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/)\n\nYou can also go with their other blends like Signature or Heritage. Additionally they offer USDA Prime chuck, American Wagyu (their \u201cKatana\u201d blend), and several other options. Experiment with your tastes and what\u2019s available but these are all excellent blends for premium burger patties. I recommend buying the brick of mince rather than the pre-formed patties as it allows you to create a slightly looser pack. Even though Fudds now uses pre-formed, pre-ground patties of all-chuck, I feel that going with these higher-grade blends greatly enhances flavor and results in a burger closer to the OG Fudds in-house, freshly ground taste of memory.\u00a0\n\n**THE BUN:**\n\nBoulangerie Ace Bakery - Gourmet Buns - Classic\n\n[https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/](https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/)\n\nYou\u2019re looking for a premium bakery bun with that shiny golden dome, but ideally NOT a brioche bun. These are the closest I\u2019ve found where I live, but many bakeries may offer premium buns that fit this description.\u00a0\n\n**THE SPICE:**\n\n[https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html](https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html)\n\nThis is the special ingredient that brings it all together and ultimately makes Fudds\u2026well, Fudds. It\u2019s easily made at home. Follow the recipe to the letter, and multiply proportions as needed to ensure your home is never without the essential magic that is Fudd Spice.\u00a0\n\n**THE FRIES:**\n\nWild Fork Foods - Potato Wedges\n\n[https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa\\_Ap3Mt4soZ7](https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa_Ap3Mt4soZ7)\n\nTBH this was the trickiest component. French fry aficionados may prefer to attempt freshly cut wedges, but these are very close, if not spot-on, and without the hassle. The trick is finding wedges that aren\u2019t overly pre-seasoned because you need to add the Fudd Spice to make these taste correct, and most frozen wedges come with factory seasoning that tampers with (or completely ruins) the authenticity.\u00a0 Bake, air-fry, or, for the closest match, do what they do at Fudds and deep fry in canola oil, drain, and then sprinkle liberally with the magic dust!\n\n**THE CHEESE SAUCE:**\n\nRico\u2019s Premium Cheddar Cheese Sauce\n\n[https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/](https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/)\n\nYes, it\u2019s from a can, but it\u2019s spot on. If you want to go a fresher, more culinarily-sophisticated route, Godspeed, but I\u2019ve been going to Fudds for decades and trust me, for the express purpose of recreating the authentic Fudds experience in your maw, this is the cheese sauce you\u2019re looking for.\u00a0\n\n**THE TOPPINGS BAR:**\n\nThis goes without saying, but any home replication of that glorious fresh market of fixin\u2019s should include: sliced tomato, onion (multiple colors), lettuce (at least two leaf varieties), pickles, salsa, relish, jalape\u00f1o and other pepper varieties, and of course every condiment known to man, never to exclude the basic staples of ketchup, mustard, mayo, 1000 island, and anything else your little heart desires. Needless to say the cheese sauce as mentioned above will factor formidably into the final equation as well.\u00a0\n\n**BURGER PREPARATION:**\n\nFor authenticity it is essential that you cook your burger on a griddle. If you don\u2019t have one, a frying pan or cast iron skillet will substitute in a pinch.\u00a0 Do not, however, attempt to grill over an open flame. You will be rendering all the above meticulous preparations null and void, and doing yourself a great disservice in the bargain.\u00a0 If your griddle or skillet is unseasoned or rarely-used, you may consider adding a tablespoon of canola, avocado, or vegetable oil to the heated surface before laying down your patty. Remember, we are going for authenticity here, and the burger you remember from Fudds was not born of a pristine, virginal cook top, but rather of the greasy remnants of hundreds if not thousands of other burgers born before it on that same cook top. \u00a0\n\n1. Form your beef into 1/3 or 1/2 pound patties taking care not to pack too tightly.\u00a0\n2. Pre-heat griddle on medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil if desired, as suggested above.\u00a0\n3. Place the patty down onto the pre-heated griddle and sprinkle liberally with Fudd spice.\u00a0 This is how they did it at fudds\u2014they did not pre-season the patties before hitting the griddle, as you can see from video footage of Fudds cooks in action from the 1990\u2019s glory days.\u00a0 Cook for 4-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired temperature).\u00a0 Press the patty gently downward with your spatula not more than twice during this initial phase of cooking. Do not \u201csmash\u201d or cut the patty.\u00a0 Just enough pressure to aid in even cooking within and without, while simultaneously facilitating more caramelization on the outer rim. You want it Fudds style\u2014thick, juicy, with a respectable char on the outside.\n4. Flip the patty and cook for an additional 3-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired cook temperature).\u00a0 During this second phase you may elect to sprinkle the Fudd spice again, though, from what I have gleaned from archival footage on YouTube, the OG Fudds cooks did NOT bust a second sprinkydink.\u00a0 During the last minute of cooking, place a square (or squares) of your preferred cheese on the patty and cover with a metal bowl or cooking dome.\u00a0\n5. At some point during phase two of cooking the burger, brush melted butter on the inside of both halves of the bun, and place, butter side down, on the griddle in order to toast.\u00a0 Remove the buns when the insides achieve a golden crisp, being careful not to let them burn.\u00a0\n6. Place the toasted bun halves on a plate, insides facing up, and remove the perfectly cooked burger from the griddle with your spatula, deftly sliding it atop the bottom bun.\n7. Top with fixin\u2019s of your choice and finally enclose the masterpiece with the top bun.\u00a0\n8. Serve alongside your freshly cooked wedge fries, and sides of the hot cheese sauce, and tell heaven you\u2019ll call them back tomorrow.\u00a0\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "created_utc": 1745353029.0, "score": 148, "author": "AceRutherfords", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The two dishes I most enjoyed were the vegetable fried spring rolls (or egg rolls) because of it's very distinctive dipping sauce and the spicy tuna sushi roll, because they used a sauce that tasted dissimilar to sriracha for their spicy tuna. I have been trying to brainstorm ideas on how to recreate this and I would love to hear suggestions on how to recreate these flavors:\n\n\\- The spring roll sauce is very tart and acid, not so much sweet as is usual for me. It is quite translucent and transparent in color with a slight orange hue, and you can see some chili pepper flecks floating around. It does not taste like sweet chili sauce, it is more of an acid base sauce. I was trying to analyze its taste and it doesn't really taste like normal vinegar to me, nor do I get the taste of rice vinegar, lime, lemon or pineapple. The tartness isn't citrusy at all, but it lacks the bitterness of vinegar and is punchier than rice vinegar (which I first thought of since it's not as bitter as regular vinegar). It also doesn't have the taste of wine vinegar. \n\n\\- The spicy tuna sauce is red and very opaque like gochujang, not translucent and gummy like sriracha. But it doesn't have a fermented taste at all like gochujang. \n\nI have searched online and haven't found a copycat recipe for these elements yet. I appreciate any suggestions.\n\nedited for grammar.

{"title": "The actual KFC recipe", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have a recipe that I found a long time ago, apparently it is the current KFC corporate recipe, as it was written in 2010. There may have been slight changes to the recipe up to now but I doubt it since the ingredients are easy to get.\n\nThe secret is said to be in the marinade, as it gives it an unmatched flavor. What it says it contains is \u201cpotassium\u201d but I did some research and through experiments I came to the conclusion that it is tetra potassium pyrophosphate. It is the only molecule that works well, since other products that contain potassium would be \u201cpotassium nitrate\u201d, \u201cpotassium chloride\u201d, \u201cpotassium carbonate\u201d and these do not give our meat organoleptic characteristics. Bottle Concantrate Chicken is an ingredient that is mentioned for the marinade and it contains other main ingredients such as chicken concentrate, corn starch, salt, sugar, chicken fat, citric acid, natural flavors.\n\nThe marinade can vary by country and region, as many KFCs are franchises and are not authorized to carry all of the KFC (now Kentucky Fried Chicken) corporate ingredients. Some marinades may contain other potassium and sodium phosphates, as well as sodium bicarbonate. All of these help to keep the meat juicy and slow down the oxidation process of fats and meat, which gives the meat a rancidity (refrigerated flavor). They can be more antioxidants like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid. But the former are acids which could unbalance the pH of our marinade.\n\nAnother secret is the breading part, as skimmed milk powder and egg powder are used to combine it with the flour.\n\nMSG is essential since it is found in almost all processed foods in all fast food restaurants. It is a widely used flavour enhancer, although another commonly used enhancer is yeast extract, which is an extract of amino acids and nucleotides from the yeast Saccaromyces Cerviseae that gives foods a umami flavour. The sugar present in chicken concentrate is also essential, since for curing chicken and other meats, a little sugar is needed to start the curing process of the meat and enhance that umami flavour even more. We all know that ferments (umami) have a different flavour than the original foods, for example anchovies (fish), fish sauce (fish), miso paste (soy, rice), soy sauce (soy beans), hams (fresh meat), cheddar and parmesan cheese (dairy derivatives), Worcestershire sauce (soy and mollusks), sausages (fresh meat), pickled olives (olive trees), among many others\u2026\n\nI leave the document in the photo.

CAKE. I\u2019ve ever had in my life, no exaggeration. In the span of two weeks, I ordered the cake from them on DoorDash 5 times. That's once every other day. I haven't tasted anything better in my life. It's supposed to be a twist on sticky toffee pudding I believe but the cake is denser and chewier than regular sticky toffee pudding, and the BEST part is the SAUCE - perfect texture, perfect sweetness, so caramelly, not to heavy not too light. Best part is when it's refrigerated it gets a little thicker and chewy, ribonny, l'm not sure how to describe it but l've attached pictures lol. Anyways I moved out of LA recently and I've been craving it sooo badly and trying sticky toffee puddings at other restaurants / from the grocery stores but nothing compares - all the ones I\u2019ve tried taste too soft/moist and dissolve in my mouth, and the sauce tastes sweet in a different way? Idk how to explain it, but it makes me think this isn\u2019t a traditional \u2018sticky toffee pudding\u2019 - like I said its denser chewier, and I know the caramel sauce is made with brown sugar, maybe it uses some type of syrup? I don\u2019t know how to explain it but the sauce has more depth and tastes richer but not \u2018heavy\u2019/cream forward. On the menu all it says is \"**medjool dates, brown sugar caramel**\", but I know both the cake and the sauce contain **dairy and/or egg** (according to the restaurant staff). If anyone knows how to recreate it or thinks they would know how to, PLEASE PLEASE let me know, I\u2019m so desperate (down horrendous) lol. I\u2019ve attached pictures of it and the menu. THANK YOU!!!\n\nHere is a [link ](https://order.toasttab.com/online/bacari-west-3rd/item-the-best-cake_ed6282c9-82ce-4cd6-ab19-597178a7c878)to the restaurant's menu where you can find an official picture of the cake, and here is a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDTpgVwRWZf/) of the sauce's texture.\n\nP.S.

It\u2019s not sour, but will make your mouth tighten up and pucker a little.\n\nIf you think you have a recipe. I\u2019d be grateful for details. If you think it\u2019s soy, can you tell me if it\u2019s plain, dark, or some other version. Same if you think it\u2019s vinegar. White, rice, etc. if the sweetness is sugar, brown or white? \n\nThat kind of detail is very helpful. I know from experience, it can matter. I\u2019ve been experimenting with bbq sauces and many contain vinegar. We had Braggs with the mother, and it\u2019s too strong. It\u2019ll kick your teeth in. I\u2019ve found generic, filtered store brand ACV or even white are much milder. You\u2019d think white would be bland, but it just tastes clean in a vinegar base sauce.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard that some of these sauces change drastically if you heat them to a simmer for a while, vs just combining.\n\nMy best guess, though it doesn\u2019t turn out for me, is soy, vinegar, garlic powder, and sugar. Not sure about brands or ratios. There may be something obvious I\u2019m missing. I\u2019d love to make it for lots of uses though. I\u2019d just keep a bottle in the fridge all the time if I could make it.\ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks for any help you can give me.\ud83d\ude00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gmxp3m/ling_ling_potsticker_sauce/", "created_utc": 1731112466.0, "score": 7, "author": "Dalton387", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gmxp3m/ling_ling_potsticker_sauce/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The color was different as it was like a dark tan from the cookie dough. When cookie was cooled completely. It had the crispy edges of the rolled oats, and wheatgerm. But the centers are chewy, little sweet and mini chocolate chips sets them apart from the sweetness that imparts bittersweet flavor. The texture is just perfect like the one from Specialty's.\n\n\\++++\n\nI baked the Specialty's Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate chip cookies on 350F for 14 mins. It spread way too much because of the amount of light brown sugar it had. Tasted little burnt and the edges burnt. Not pleasant.\n\nIt was a failure for the 3rd time.\n\n\\++++++\n\n2nd, I tried making the dough of the Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe from Advanced Baking and Pastry from Wiley Publishing. I modified the recipe and adapted how Specialty's would have it. The cookies came out as thick, chewy, hearty cookie. Not too sweet but little buttery flavor. I would add little more salt next time. It is a great cookie. The recipe is provided below of the successful cookie between the 2.\n\nLet them cool on pan until cooled completely and the insides are set and firm.\n\nAdvanced Baking and Pastry Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate Chip Cookies:\n\n340 g butter, softened + 390 g light brown sugar (liquid ingredient) + 198 g all purpose flour + 28 g whole wheat flour + 28 g bran flour + 3 g baking soda + 5 g salt + 2.5 g ground cinnamon + 28 g wheatgerm + 369 g rolled oats (old-fashioned rolled oats is okay) +10 ml vanilla extract + 284 g (5 large eggs) + 250 g mini chocolate chips (choose Guittard Almost MIcro chocolate chips. Other brands wouldn't cut it because real chocolate flavor is lost. And after cookies are baked, it tends to get crunchy without any chocolate flavor.\n\nCombine all flours, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, wheatgerm and rolled oats in a large bowl. Mix with a spoon until evenly distributed. Set aside.\n\nCream together the butter, light brown sugar and granulated sugar until sugars are completely dissolved and no grains are apparent. Add eggs one at a time. Add the dry ingredients and fold in both mixtures until the dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in the mini chocolate chips into the cookie batter.\n\nScoop 2oz cookie dough and transfer to an airtight container. Cover and chill in fridge for up to 24 to 48 hours. My fridge is on the cold side, so it took about 12 to 15 hours.\n\nNext day, preheat oven to 375F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Transfer cookie dough onto lined baking sheets with 2\" apart of every cookie. Bake cookies at 375F for 14 minutes until light golden brown and the insides are already set but chewy and soft.\n\nRemove cookies from oven, then cool the cookies on baking sheets until cool completely. Transfer them on wire racks to cool completely and let the cookie be set and firm on the insides.\n\nGood luck making this cookie. It is one of my favorites.\n\nAlso, I recommend adding toasted pecans or walnuts, chopped for a nutty texture in the cookies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glq0pt", "created_utc": 1730984883.0, "score": 19, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glq0pt/journey_remaking_specialtys_oatmeal_wheatgerm/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Jose Peppers Jumbo Stuffed Jalape\u00f1os & Tomatillo Ranch", "selftext": "When I was 16, I worked at Jose Pepper's, and the stuffed jalape\u00f1os quickly became one of my favorite comfort foods. I remember they explained that, although they\u2019re called \u201cstuffed jalape\u00f1os,\u201d they actually use poblano peppers because jalape\u00f1os are too small to get that perfect, satisfying bite. So of course, I used poblanos in my recipe too!\n\nSince moving in 2020, I\u2019ve been on a quest to find a mock recipe that captures that same flavor and feeling I remember. After scouring the internet with no luck, I decided to try my hand at recreating it myself. These stuffed poblano peppers bring back the nostalgia of my teenage years, and I hope they\u2019ll become a comfort food for you, too. Enjoy!\n\n**For the Stuffed Poblanos:**\n\n\\- 4 large poblano peppers, halved and seeded\n\n\\- 1 cup cooked, shredded chicken (seasoned with a pinch of smoked paprika and chili powder)\n\n\\- 8 oz cream cheese, softened\n\n\\- 1/4 cup diced pickled jalape\u00f1os\n\n\\- 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n\n\\- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n\n**For the Breading and Frying:**\n\n\\- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\\- 2 large eggs, beaten\n\n\\- 1 cup Panko breadcrumbs\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp chili powder (optional, for extra kick in the coating)\n\n\\- Oil for frying (vegetable or canola)\n\n\n\n**For the Tomatillo Ranch:**\n\n\\- 4 tomatillos, husked and rinsed\n\n\\- 1/2 cup sour cream\n\n\\- 1/4 cup mayonnaise\n\n\\- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro\n\n\\- 1-2 tbsp lime juice\n\n\\- 1 jalape\u00f1o (seeded for less heat, if desired)\n\n\\- 1 clove garlic\n\n\\- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the Poblanos: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Place the halved poblanos on a baking sheet and roast for 10-12 minutes, until slightly softened (this will make stuffing easier). Let them cool.\n\n2. Season the Chicken: Mix the shredded chicken with smoked paprika and a pinch of chili powder to add a smoky, grilled flavor.\n\n3. Make the Jalape\u00f1o Cream Cheese Filling: In a bowl, combine the shredded chicken, cream cheese, diced pickled jalape\u00f1os, Monterey Jack cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth.\n\n4. Stuff the Poblanos: Spoon the filling into each poblano half, pressing it in to secure.\n\n5. Bread the Poblanos:\n\n   \\- Set up a breading station with three bowls: flour in the first, beaten eggs in the second, and Panko breadcrumbs mixed with chili powder in the third.\n\n   \\- Coat each stuffed poblano first in flour, then dip into the eggs, and finally press into the Panko breadcrumbs, ensuring they\u2019re fully coated.\n\n6. Fry the Poblanos:\n\n   \\- Heat about 1 inch of oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat.\n\n   \\- Fry each stuffed poblano for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels.\n\n7. Make the Tomatillo Ranch: In a blender, combine tomatillos, sour cream, mayonnaise, cilantro, lime juice, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic. Blend until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n8. Serve: Serve the crispy, fried stuffed poblanos with the tomatillo ranch on the side for dipping.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glfrpp/jose_peppers_jumbo_stuffed_jalape\u00f1os_tomatillo/", "created_utc": 1730945373.0, "score": 10, "author": "SpiritualReward3696", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glfrpp/jose_peppers_jumbo_stuffed_jalape\u00f1os_tomatillo/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

This post contains the seasonal cookies.\n\nPecan Sandies:  \n6 oz (170 grams) finely chopped pecans + 8 oz (225 grams) bread flour + 8 oz (225 grams) cake flour + 1/4 tsp (3 grams) salt + 12 oz (340 grams) unsalted butter softened at room temp + 3 oz (85 grams) powdered sugar + 1 tbsp (15 ml) vanilla extract. Powdered sugar\n\nMix together the pecans, bread and cake flours, and salt in a large bowl until they are all fully incorporated. Set aside.\n\nUsing paddle attachment, add the butter and powdered sugar in bowl of stand mixer. Cream together both ingredients until light in color and the texture is aerated and fluffy. Add in vanilla extract and mix until fully incorporated. Incorporate the flour-nut mixture at low speed, mixing just until combined. Chill the dough until it is firm enough to work with.\n\nDivide the dough into 3 equal pieces about 12 oz (360 grams) each. Roll each piece into a ripe of 8 inches in length and cut into 10 pieces from each rope.\n\nRoll each pieces between the palms to make round balls, and place them on sheet pans lined with parchment paper. Press down lightly to keep the balls of dough from rolling, but don't flatten.\n\nBake at 350F/ 175C for about 20 minutes, or until cookies are firm to touch and golden brown. While the cookies are still warm, roll them in powdered sugar to cover them heavily.\n\nGinger Molasses: [https://www.theflouredtable.com/triple-ginger-molasses-cookies/](https://www.theflouredtable.com/triple-ginger-molasses-cookies/)\n\n1/2 cup (113 gramss) unsalted butter softened at room temp + 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar + 1/2 cup (100 grams) light brown sugar + 1 large egg room temp + 1/4 cup (85 grams) Grandma's Brand Molasses + 2.5 tsps fresh ginger finely grated + 1.5 tsps ground cinnamon + 1 tsp ground ginger + 1/4 tsp ground cloves + 1.5 tsps baking soda + 1/2 tsp kosher salt + 240 grams all-purpose flour + 1/2 cup (75 grams) crystallized ginger finely diced + 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar, for rolling.  \nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar on medium-low speed until blended. Increase speed to medium and continue mixing until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl with a spatula. Add egg and mix until fully incorporated.\n\nAdd molasses and mix until blended. Add fresh ginger, ground spices, baking soda and salt, and mix on low speed until completely blended in. Scrape down sides of bowl with spatula. Add the flour and mix on low speed\u00a0*just*\u00a0until a few streaks of flour remain.\n\nRemove mixing bowl from stand mixer and add crystallized ginger (if using). Use your spatula to fold in the last bits of flour and to distribute the crystallized ginger throughout the dough. Do not overmix.\n\nScoop 2 oz or 3.75 oz cookies. Roll the cookie dough balls and cover them on the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar on parchment paper lined baking sheets. Place the trays in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.\n\nNext day, thaw cookies for 15 minutes at room temp from the refrigerator.\n\n* Directly prior to baking, position oven rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C, Gas Mark 4). Place a piece of parchment on a standard half sheet baking pan. Evenly space 8 balls of sugar-covered dough onto the parchment lined sheet. (I do two rows of 3, plus 2 in the center). Store remainder of dough in fridge until ready to bake.\n* Bake each sheet for 12-13 minutes. This will result in a cookie that is chewy, still moist, and slowly bends rather than snaps. If you prefer a crisper, crunchier cookie, increase baking time by a minute or two. Remove from oven and let cool on pan for one minute.\n* After one minute, carefully transfer cookies to a cooling rack.\n\nWhite Chocolate Macadamia Nut - already posted the chocolate chip cookie base that Specialty's uses - [https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gav96f/specialtys\\_chocolate\\_chip\\_cookies\\_other\\_cookies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gav96f/specialtys_chocolate_chip_cookies_other_cookies/)\n\nGood luck baking, and let me know what were the results and experiences baking these treats.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gd0k39/specialtys_seasonal_cookies_and_close_copycats/", "created_utc": 1729994208.0, "score": 27, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gd0k39/specialtys_seasonal_cookies_and_close_copycats/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Specialty's Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate Chip, Other cookies and baked goods - close copycats with improved recipes - Part 2", "selftext": "This signature cookie from Specialty's Cafe and Bakery is what they are known for as \" it is like a granola bar in a cookie filled with crisp oats on the edges and mini chocolate chips to get your fix as something healthyish and wholesome at the same time.\" If you had eaten this cookie from them, you know what I am talking about. This is the most requested recipe from Specialty's cookie fans, and here it is:\n\nThis is one of my favorite cookies so far.\n\nSpecialty's cafe and bakery Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate chip cookies:\n\nThis makes 12 - 3.75 oz or almost 1/2 cup cookies\n\nStep A:\n\n7 oz Light brown sugar, packed + 10 oz rolled oats (add-in) + 3.75 oz all purpose flour + 1.75 oz whole wheat flour + 1.25 oz  and 2.25 tsps Wheat Bran Flour (add-in) + 1.25 oz  and 2.25 tsps Wheatgerm (add-in) + 1.75 tsps salt + 1 tsp ground cinnamon + 9.75 oz unsalted butter softened at room temp.\n\nCombine all of the dry ingredients like brown sugar, rolled oats, all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, (wheat) bran flour, wheatgerm, ground cinnamon, salt in a bowl of stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix on LOW SPEED on KA 3 or 4, BRV 3 - 4 for approximately 1- 2 minutes.\n\nAdd in the softened butter, and mix on LOW SPEED until you see pea-sized crumbles of flour mixture and butter mixed together for approximately 1 minute.\n\nSTEP B:\n\nAdd in 1 large egg and 0.7 oz vanilla extract in a small bowl. Beat them together until combined. Add liquid ingredients onto the flour butter mixture until dough comes together. If the cookie dough, doesn't come together add 1 more egg if necessary.\n\nSTEP C:\n\nAdd in 11 oz mini semisweet chocolate chips or Guittard Almost Micro chocolate chips. You can order them on the Guittard website, or Amazon. But you can use any brand of your choice (Hershey's, Baker's Choice, Whole Foods and your choice of dark chocolate chopped finely. Fold the mini semisweet chocolate chips briefly on LOW SPEED until all of the ingredients come together as a sticky cookie dough briefly.\n\nPortion the cookie dough 3.75 oz or how big you want them. Place them on an airtight container. Cover and let them freeze for 6 HOURS, or refrigerate them for at least 12 to 24 hours.\n\nNext day, preheat your oven to 350F (or 325F, if using convection oven). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\nThaw portioned cookie dough for about 5 to 8 minutes. Then place 4 on a quarter baking sheet or 6 on a half sheet and allow 1 to 2 inches apart for the cookie dough.\n\nBake @ preheated 350F for 13 to 16 minutes, or if you have a convection oven 325F for 14 to 17 minutes. I use a Breville Smart oven at 325F for 13 to 15 minutes until egde of cookies are golden brown, crispy, and middle and centers are soft to touch.\n\n\\*\\* If you want to look like cubes of cookie dough. Place them on a parchment paper lined 8 x 8\" or 9 x 9\" square pan. Freeze them for 6 hours or refrigerate them for 12 to 24 hours. Then thaw them at 15 to 20 minutes, then cut them into 2.85\" squares. Place them on baking sheets and follow similar procedures baking them. Also if you are baking bigger cubed cookies allow the cookies to bake longer. I would suggest to bake 1 first, and adjust how long it goes for like 14 to 18 minutes. Take note how much time it bakes the cookies. Adjust and bake accordingly.\n\n\\*\\* Cookies are hearty, chewy, with a lot of oatmeal and mini chocolate chips gives it some wholesome feeling of bittersweet chocolate flavor embedded in this. I loved the cookie so much, I had to stop myself, and buy it rarely when I worked there.\n\n\\++++++\n\nA comparable copycat of these cookies is from [BeyondKimchee.com](http://BeyondKimchee.com) that makes the Oatmeal Wheatgerm & Toasted pecans cookies - [https://www.beyondkimchee.com/chocolate-chip-wheat-germ-cookies/](https://www.beyondkimchee.com/chocolate-chip-wheat-germ-cookies/)\n\nThis is a simplified and accessible recipe for Oatmeal Wheatgerm chocolate chip cookies.\n\nMakes 12 cookies\n\n3/4 cup all-purpose flour + 3/4 cup wheatgerm + 1/2 cup quick cooking instant oats + 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1/2 tsp baking soda + 1/2 tsp salt + 1/2 cup unsalted butter softened + 1/3 cup granulated sugar + 1/2 cup dark brown sugar + 1 large egg + 3/4 tsp vanilla extract + 1/2 cup chopped pecans + 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips.\n\n* Preheat the oven to 350\u02daF. Line a cookie pan with parchment paper or baking mat; set aside.\n* Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, oats, and wheat germ together; set aside.\n* In an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars on medium speed until fluffy. Add an egg and vanilla extract. Beat well for 2 minutes.\n* Add the dry ingredient mixture and stir until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped pecans.\n* Using a cookie scoop or spoon, take 3 tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball. Place cookie balls on a prepared pan, spacing apart about 2-inch in between.\n* Wet your fingers with water and press down the cookie balls slightly. Bake them in a preheated 350\u02daF oven for 12-14 minutes. Let the cookies rest on a pan for 2 minutes. Transfer them to a cooling rack and cool completely.\n\n\\+++++\n\nI have seen other copycats but saw other ingredients like shredded coconut that resulted in a chewy texture but not coconut flavor into it. Would not recommend that recipe, in terms of taste of what you get from Specialty's.\n\n\\+++++\n\nGood luck! on baking these cookies.

Cook, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes. Turn the heat down if the onions start to brown.\n3. Add the carrots and cook for another 5 to 6 minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.\n4. Add the meat and break it up into small pieces.

{"title": "Del Taco's Chicken Tacos Recipe", "selftext": "I've been trying out various recipes on the internet for awhile now, but finally got a combination that tastes pretty close!\n\nFirst is the chicken, which I found [this recipe](https://abracashaba.com/copycat-del-taco-chicken-soft-tacos/) to be the closest. Only had to tweak the ingredient amounts:\n\n**Marinade**  \n4 lb. Chicken Breast/Thighs (I use both), cut up TINY (1/4\" pieces, food processor works perfect here)  \n2 Limes, juiced  \n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce  \n3 Tbsp Taco Seasoning [(I use this](https://www.amazon.com/Birch-Meadow-Spicy-Seasoning-Flavorful/dp/B0CLYW5HDN?crid=J12LC89CN2BT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WH-1lt5hp_Dbq82QFet22a2hAMtGiEkfleWrF2VItZmBGTqnCuoR5UmNQNzLpsSNVKIx1jpFfEJ2cfLmKyccHyfYAF_nYIZ4bEcsGKe9LB_gA6H-xSGWftPfvW04SEaECD0HRiksMmrClbzL2u6Z5sJEDCy1yqt-9YvPk2-3vRWOZgUKCjcRKefqAVHOi6hOSubm1ZDK7fVFp4CG8zAbGyN04DdffzKsAz032YiKBPsUToBqphWU4D_bAh2YIQFAXOQh1cfONsjakx4Cjhq8u3rd9TVrpMAafV-IiBq63AE.byTl0Z2CCgtwQzhnuCaXwoTcMzYbjrTak88bzVC9Lr4&dib_tag=se&keywords=taco%2Bseasoning%2Bbirch%2Band%2Bmeadows&qid=1731983849&sprefix=taco%2Bseasoning%2Bbirch%2Band%2Bmeadow%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-6&th=1))  \n1 Tbsp Knorr Chicken Bouillon Powder  \n2 tsp Corn Starch  \n1/2 tsp Baking Soda  \n1/4 tsp Garlic Powder  \n1/4 tsp Onion Powder  \n1/4 tsp Cayenne (or Paprika for less heat)  \nDrizzle of Cooking Oil\n\n1. Combine all ingredients (including oil) and let sit in airtight container for up to 24 hours.\n2. When ready to cook, heat a metal pan (wok works perfect here) over medium-high heat until hot (use the [dancing water test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-SCA1reqE)), coat with a little more oil, then add 1/4 of the chicken (You'll want to cook in four batches to avoid overcrowding).\n3. Smash chicken into an even layer, then set a timer for 4 1/2 minutes. At 2 minutes, flip; after another minute, break up and stir fry until cooked through (should be around when the timer goes off).\n4. Set aside cooked chicken in big bowl, then Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the other batches.\n5. Mix cooked chicken then taste for seasoning (Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Salt, and/or just more Taco Seasoning).\n\nNext is the Secret Sauce, I liked[ this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZWvlYjZu8Y&t):\n\n**Secret Sauce**  \n1/2 Cup Light Mayo  \n1/4 Cup Buttermilk (or powdered buttermilk + milk)  \n1/4 tsp. Fine Salt  \n1/4 tsp. Sugar\n\n1. Whisk all ingredients together and store in an airtight container overnight.\n\nWith your main ingredients ready, all you need now is taco shells (bake in oven)/tortillas (heat on grill), shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, and your favorite taco sauce.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nEdit: Have made this several more times and made some small adjustments to ingredient amounts for more flavor.\n\nEdit2: Actually found an ingredients list for those that want to try and hack their own recipe:\n\n**Grilled Marinated Chicken:**  \nChicken Breast With Rib Meat, And, Boneless Skinless Chicken Thigh Meat, Water, Seasoning (Modified Food Starch, Salt, Garlic Powder, Spices, Dried Whey Protein Concentrate, Onion Powder, Soy Sauce (Naturally Fermented From Wheat And Soybeans), Sugar, Corn Syrup Solids, Maltodextrin, Lime Juice Solids, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Citric Acid, Natural Flavors, Chicken Fat, Dextrose, Hydrolyzed Corn Gluten, Caramel Color, Chicken Broth, Oleoresin Paprika, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Gelatin), Sodium Phosphates\n\n**Secret Sauce:**  \nSoybean Oil, Water, Egg Yolk, Vinegar, Contains Less than 2% of: Modified Food Starch, Salt, Sugar, Buttermilk Solids, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Calcium Disodium EDTA, Lactic Acid", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1g4v1ro/del_tacos_chicken_tacos_recipe/", "created_utc": 1729069721.0, "score": 52, "author": "Jahydin", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1g4v1ro/del_tacos_chicken_tacos_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, remaining one tablespoon of granulated sugar, and salt in a stand mixer.\n\n\n\nAdd the yeast mixture and melted butter to the flour mixture. Knead with the dough hook on medium speed until it is smooth and elastic, about eight minutes. Transfer to a bowl coated with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about one and a half hours.\n\n\n\nLightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Punch down the dough and transfer to a work surface; knead a few times. Cut in half and gently shape into two three-by-six-inch loaves (do not overwork the dough). Place the loaves three inches apart on the prepared pan. Lightly spray the loaves with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until puffy, 30 minutes to one hour.\n\n\n\nMake the topping: Whisk the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small baking dish. Whisk the melted butter and corn syrup in another small baking dish.\n\n\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two nine-by-five-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a two-inch overhang on all sides. Cut four deep slashes across the top of each loaf (the loaves will look deflated). Dip each loaf in the butter-corn syrup mixture, turning to cover, then coat with the cinnamon sugar, making sure to get the sugar in the crevices. Place the loaves in the prepared pans. Drizzle with any remaining butter mixture and sprinkle with any remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Lift the bread out of the loaf pans using the parchment overhang and transfer to a rack. Let cool in the paper, about 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, salt, melted butter, and three tablespoons of milk in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in up to two more tablespoons of milk as needed to loosen. Drizzle on the warm loaves or serve on the side for dipping.\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S KATSU CURRY - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_DgczQFxbB/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_DgczQFxbB/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S FIRECRACKER SHRIMP - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_sxgtNhFIL/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sxgtNhFIL/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S CHILI CHICKEN RAMEN - [https://www.wagamama.us/recipes](https://www.wagamama.us/recipes)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S MONTE CARLO BISCUITS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S SCOTCH FINGERS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger)\n\n\n\n**Arnott's Scotch Finger**\n\n* **Prep time: 10 mins** \n* **Cook time: 25 mins** \n* **Makes: 16 biscuits** \n\n\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* **170g salted butter, softened** \n* **\u2154 cup (90g) soft icing sugar** \n* **1 cup (165g) plain flour** \n* **1\u00bd tsp baking powder** \n\n\n\n**Method**\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 160\u00b0C.

We enjoyed watching these episodes and gives us a glimpse that these famous American candies and sweets can be replicated at home with better flavor, texture using pantry and other ingredients available at home. Of course, they are some you have to order or purchase at specialty, supermarket and restaurant supplies stores.\n\nThis post will be useful as corporations cut down costs by eliminating few ingredients, changed formulas and replaced with other ingredients. Furthermore, they sacrificed flavor over texture. Still they raised prices due to inflation circumstances. Some \"bad\" corporations do become greedy of profits over the quality of what they sell. For example, I was kind of disappointed when I tasted Hershey's new Kitkat - the new version of milk chocolate was too waxy and lost its milky, creamy texture and flavor of milk chocolate. It lost its flavor that I usually remember back in the 1980s. On 2024, It tasted like oily chocolate coating that lacked salt, sugar and some milk solids. The wafer recipe is similar. But I will be buying a more affordable chocolate biscuit filled with cream and covered with milk or dark chocolate. Or better, make my own. Or maybe buy the imported UK or Canadien candy bar.\n\nThis is a 2nd post of what you can make at home from Bon Appetit, and Claire Saffitz.

And wondered if these cookies are good for a snack or dessert attack. These are the recipes they had provided during the pandemic, if some of you love their cookies. Here are the recipes. Below you will find recipes where you can bake them in an air fryer.\n\n# Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nRecipe:\n\n* \u00bd cup unsalted butter\n* \u00bd cup brown sugar\n* \u00bc cup white sugar\n* 1 room-temp egg\n* 1 \u00bd cups flour\n* 1 tsp baking soda\n* \u00bc tsp salt\n* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Microwave the butter until it\u2019s almost fully melted. Combine with the white and brown sugar, then beat in the egg and vanilla for about 30 seconds. Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt, then fold in the chocolate chips until completely mixed together. Place them in fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Line the air fryer racks with parchment paper or foil. Use a cookie scoop (we love\u00a0[***this one***](https://www.mytoque.com/collections/utensils/products/norpro-stainless-steel-scoop-35-mm)\u00a0from Toque Blanche!) and place cookie dough in the fryer baskets. Depending on the size of the air fryer, you can most likely fit about two to five scoops on each rack.\n\n3. At 350\u00b0F, air fry the dough until it begins crisping and looking golden (which should take about five to seven minutes). Remove the cookies, then let them rest for a few minutes. Work in batches until all the dough is gone, and enjoy!\n\n# Snickerdoodles\n\nRecipe:\n\n* One stick of butter (AT ROOM TEMP \u2013\u00a0[***here\u2019s why***](https://blog.pacificcookie.com/2021/03/how-to-fix-flat-cookies/)\u00a0that\u2019s important!)\n* 1 \u00be cups sugar\n* 2 eggs\n* 2 tsp. vanilla\n* 2 \u00be cups flour\n* 1 tsp. cream of tartar\n* \u00bd tsp. baking soda\n* 1 tsp. salt\n* 1 tbsp. ground cinnamon\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Mix together butter and 1 \u00bd cups of sugar. Slowly add in eggs, vanilla, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt until fully combined. Put in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Scoop the dough with a cookie scoop and roll the balls in the remaining sugar and cinnamon.\n\n3. Add parchment paper to the air fryer racks, then gently place dough balls on the parchment paper. You should be able to fit two to five scoops depending on how big your air fryer is.\n\n4. At 340\u00b0F, fry for four minutes, or until the edges look crispy. Remove from the air fryer, let sit for five minutes, then snack away!\n\n# Peanut Butter Cookies\n\nRecipe:\n\n* 1 stick room-temp butter\n* \u00bd cup brown sugar\n* \u00bd white sugar\n* \u00bd cup smooth peanut butter\n* 1 \u00be cups flour\n* \u00be tsp. baking soda\n* 1 egg\n* \u00bd tsp. salt\n* 2 tbsp. milk (can be non-dairy)\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Mix together peanut butter and softened butter. Then add sugars and mix until fully combined. Add the egg and milk, continuing to mix. Finally, add flour in slowly, bit by bit \u2013 you don\u2019t want to add it all at once! Let them chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Use a cookie scoop to place small balls of dough on parchment-lined air fryer racks/baskets. Take a fork and flatten them.\n\n3. Fry at 350\u00b0F for five to seven minutes, or until they look crispy. Take them out of the air fryer and let them sit until they\u2019re completely cool. Then feast!\n\n# Tips On Baking Cookies In An Air Fryer\n\n1. The best size is a two-tbsp. scoop (so use a scoop!), and you should keep the cookies one inch apart. This way they cook evenly and won\u2019t melt into each other despite the limited space.\n\n2.. Follow the directions to a T!

Microwave the butter until it\u2019s almost fully melted. Combine with the white and brown sugar, then beat in the egg and vanilla for about 30 seconds. Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt, then fold in the chocolate chips until completely mixed together. Place them in fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Line the air fryer racks with parchment paper or foil. Use a cookie scoop (we love\u00a0[***this one***](https://www.mytoque.com/collections/utensils/products/norpro-stainless-steel-scoop-35-mm)\u00a0from Toque Blanche!) and place cookie dough in the fryer baskets. Depending on the size of the air fryer, you can most likely fit about two to five scoops on each rack.\n\n3. At 350\u00b0F, air fry the dough until it begins crisping and looking golden (which should take about five to seven minutes). Remove the cookies, then let them rest for a few minutes. Work in batches until all the dough is gone, and enjoy!\n\n# Snickerdoodles\n\nRecipe:\n\n* One stick of butter (AT ROOM TEMP \u2013\u00a0[***here\u2019s why***](https://blog.pacificcookie.com/2021/03/how-to-fix-flat-cookies/)\u00a0that\u2019s important!)\n* 1 \u00be cups sugar\n* 2 eggs\n* 2 tsp. vanilla\n* 2 \u00be cups flour\n* 1 tsp. cream of tartar\n* \u00bd tsp. baking soda\n* 1 tsp. salt\n* 1 tbsp. ground cinnamon\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Mix together butter and 1 \u00bd cups of sugar. Slowly add in eggs, vanilla, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt until fully combined. Put in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Scoop the dough with a cookie scoop and roll the balls in the remaining sugar and cinnamon.\n\n3. Add parchment paper to the air fryer racks, then gently place dough balls on the parchment paper. You should be able to fit two to five scoops depending on how big your air fryer is.\n\n4. At 340\u00b0F, fry for four minutes, or until the edges look crispy. Remove from the air fryer, let sit for five minutes, then snack away!\n\n# Peanut Butter Cookies\n\nRecipe:\n\n* 1 stick room-temp butter\n* \u00bd cup brown sugar\n* \u00bd white sugar\n* \u00bd cup smooth peanut butter\n* 1 \u00be cups flour\n* \u00be tsp. baking soda\n* 1 egg\n* \u00bd tsp. salt\n* 2 tbsp. milk (can be non-dairy)\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Mix together peanut butter and softened butter. Then add sugars and mix until fully combined. Add the egg and milk, continuing to mix. Finally, add flour in slowly, bit by bit \u2013 you don\u2019t want to add it all at once! Let them chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Use a cookie scoop to place small balls of dough on parchment-lined air fryer racks/baskets. Take a fork and flatten them.\n\n3. Fry at 350\u00b0F for five to seven minutes, or until they look crispy. Take them out of the air fryer and let them sit until they\u2019re completely cool. Then feast!\n\n# Tips On Baking Cookies In An Air Fryer\n\n1. The best size is a two-tbsp. scoop (so use a scoop!), and you should keep the cookies one inch apart. This way they cook evenly and won\u2019t melt into each other despite the limited space.\n\n2.. Follow the directions to a T! Air fryers are not your conventional ovens, so don\u2019t expect them to bake the same way (there\u2019s a reason they only go in for five minutes instead of nine to eleven).\n\n3..

{"title": "jollibee spicy sparkle on their fried chicken", "selftext": "So on 2021, Jollibee introduced a spicy version for people who can take heat well in the US market which focuses on the chili heads and those demographics that belong in Central America, West Coast and South America and regions that enjoy hotter peppers above jalapenos, serranoes and above higher scoville units.\n\nTo tap the markets, the spicy version is what they preferred. It was marketed as fried chicken that had a spicy marinated which is in the chicken, and a spicy sparkle applied after the fried chicken has been cooked. They sprinkled spicy sparkle all over the chicken. The \"fry man\" who is responsible from applying water, then breading the chicken and frying into their pressure cookers. then responsible putting them in heat warmers that is ready for service. If you were to order spicy version, they sprinkle a spicy sparkle all over the chicken, put a spicy flag on the chicken. So servers and expediters serve the right chicken to customers.\n\nOn 2023, they changed the recipe and made a kind of a ripoff and cost-effective method to change the recipe on the spicy sparkle. They added the spicy sparkle on oil form. So instead of sprinkling it directly onto cooked fried chicken. They changed their recipe to annatto oil with added spicy sparkle  plus a cayenne pepper extract remake recipe which is applied using a spray bottle with a wide hole nozzle. A lot of people don't like it because it is not as delicious as before, and addicting and changed their spicy sparkle. This version is kind of a ripoff. Most of the time when I go to the nearest Jollibee, they just ran out of the Spicy chicken that I wanted. They just put a sign on the front counter that spicy chicken is not available until further notice.\n\nI tasted the new spicy ChickenJoy at another location of Jollibee. I didn't like the spicy version because the spiciness stayed on your tongue after you eat it and it stayed on your tongue. You had to drink a lot of soda or the pineapple quencher to wash it off your tongue.\n\nSo I have experimented a spicy sparkle that I reminisced when they had their spicy ChickenJoy in 2021 to 2023. The origins of the spicy sparkle is a very simple recipe that is derived from Taiwanese popcorn chicken sold at night markets, and a common Cantonese use of Jiao Yan or translated as salt and pepper.\n\nIt is a trade secret, so I am speculating this might be their seasoning blend for their fried chicken. I had tried it several times cooking some chicken tenders or popcorn chicken. These recipes are pretty close. The spicy sprinkle has to be applied when cooking freshly cooked fried chicken, not when you buy fried chicken. Unless if you are reheating it on a microwave or air fryer. Spray some oil over chicken, then sprinkle the spicy sparkle, and let it sit for few minutes that is ready to be eaten. However, most Filipinos and others think there's no chinese 5-spice. but the amounts are very minute in terms of their spice blend. But it is there.\n\nFurthermore, on this post I will include the breading mix, spicy sparkle and simple marinade for their fried chicken shown below:\n\njollibee's fried chicken seasoning blend:  \n7 grams jollibee fried chicken seasoning blend + 7 grams salt + 7 grams ground white pepper.\n\nHOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN FRIED CHICKEN SEASONING BLEND LIKE JOLLIBEE:\n\nhow to make your own s&b curry powder: yield: 6 tbsps  \n1 tbsp ground turmeric+ 2 tsps ground coriander seeds+1.5 tsps salt +1.5 tsps fenugreek seeds, toasted & ground, 1.5 tsps ground cumin +1 tsp orange peel dried, finely ground +3/4 tsp msg + 1/2 tsp rubbed dried sage + 1/2 tsp ground black pepper +1/2 tsp cayenne pepper or gochugaru (fine red pepper flakes) + 1/2 tsp dried thyme + 1 bay leaf, crushed + 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg + 1/4 tsp dried ground green cardamom pods.\n\nplus homemade chinese 5-spice: yield: 2.25 tsps  \n1/2 tsp ground cinnamon + 1/2 tsp ground fennel seeds + 1/2 tsp ground ginger + 1/2 tsp ground star anise powder + 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  \nCombine all of the spices in a spice grinder. Pulse for 2 minutes until they are finely grounded. Let it sit for few minutes until the spice dust settles down with the spices. Open the spice grinder. Transfer the spices into a mason jar or an airtight container.\n\nYou can use the spices for your next fried chicken adventure, or make your own japanese curry.\n\nJollibee's spicy sparkle:  \n2 tsps dark chili powder or California chile' powder + 1 tsp garlic powder + 3/4 tsp ground white pepper +1/4 tsp ground black pepper + 1/2 tsp chinese 5-spice powder+ 1/2 tsp salt + 1/3 tsp paprika +1/4 tsp msg.\n\nBreading mix:  \n500 grams all-purpose flour + 500 grams potato starch + 7 grams jollibee fried chicken spice blend + 7 grams salt + 7 grams ground black pepper + 7 grams garlic powder\n\nMarinade (old before 1990s):  \n1.5 to 2 lbs chicken (wings, drumstick, ribwing \\[both breast and wing\\], thighs, breasts) + 2 tbsps lo-salt(potassium chloride)+ 2 tbsps salt + 1/3 cup Knorr chicken concentrate\\[organic Knorr chicken bouillion powder\\] + 5 cups water + 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns + 4 garlic cloves smashed + 2-3 bay leaves. if spicy version, few drops of siling labuyo hot sauce \\[you can substitute Crystal or Louisiana for a similar spicy flavor profile\\].\n\nStir the marinade in a large bowl or cambro container. Add in all of the chicken. Cover with plastic film, or cover with lid if using cambro container. Store in fridge and marinade for 24 hours. Next day, strain the chicken and discard the marinade. Wash the chicken briefly. then return on pan lined with paper towels to pat dry.\n\nNew marinade (after 1990s and onwards):  \n1.5 to 2 lbs chicken (wings, drumstick, ribwing \\[both breast and wing\\], thighs, breasts) + 2 tbsps silver swan or lauriat or any soy sauce + 2 tbsps salt + 2 Tbsps Knorr chicken concentrate\\[organic Knorr chicken bouillion powder\\] + 5 cups water + 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns + 4 garlic cloves smashed + 2-3 bay leaves. if spicy version, few drops of siling labuyo hot sauce \\[you can substitute Crystal or Louisiana for a similar spicy flavor profile\\].\n\nsame procedure as above.\n\nStart with a very small batch to try this recipe out!\n\nIn the Philippines, there are a lot of fried chicken places that popped up as street food style. They marinate their chicken, have a variety of dipping sauces, serve it with rice which is a staple. Others serve it with java rice which is annatto oil with garlic fried rice. Others have about 5-6 dipping sauces to go while customers eat their fried chicken like Korean BBQ, Sweet and Spicy Korean, Gravy, White Gravy, Spicy Banana Ketchup, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Signature Hot sauce, Garlic Butter Sauce. Chicken is a popular meat choice over there as it is seen on many dishes. And it is cheap like chicken pieces are sold by the popular demand of the part like breast, thighs, drumsticks, wings, ribwing or airline as we call it here. The price range from $0.65 to $2. Then rice is just like $0.25. I mean a fried chicken meal is like $3 to $4.50 over there, but you get more for the buck to serve the masses. Filipinos love food so much even though if it is affordable and brings joy, and many more memories.\n\nPeople cannot afford Jollibee because of inflated prices on most goods there. Inflation on every product we consume has double all over. And Jollibee has decreased their portion sizes, made major cost-effective measures (which is a rip-off and don't patronize many restaurants that do this business practice and the products are not worth their are current value) and raised their prices. So more mom and pop businesses popped up to sell a variety of fried chicken at their cities, towns to satisfy cravings among Filipinos.\n\nAlso, if you think it doesn't taste right. Make few samples of the spicy sparkle and adjust it according to your taste buds. That way you can decipher or maybe crack the code of their spicy sparkle.\n\nIf you are still adventurous and curious about tasting what Taiwanese popcorn chicken or those huge XL chicken taste like:\n\nI will write another post about this:\n\nHere's a recipe of Jiao Yan or salt and pepper from Cantonese translation.\n\nhow to make your own chinese-5 spice powder using like Taiwan's night food market street food style:  \n1 tsp garlic powder + 1 tsp ground white pepper + 1/2 tsp chinese 5-spice powder + 1/3 tsp chili powder +1/4 tsp msg.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbnvwa/jollibee_spicy_sparkle_on_their_fried_chicken/", "created_utc": 1725763551.0, "score": 47, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbnvwa/jollibee_spicy_sparkle_on_their_fried_chicken/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I would suggest adding the syrups directly to your espresso drinks as opposed to making their concentrates. It looks like they want to incorporate those powders for added heath benefits, and decrease the sugar by adding more cold water in their concentrates. I thought they are trying to skimp what Monin syrups taste like in reality. If you apply Monin syrups to espressos, martinis, alcohols and other mocktails. Their flavored syrups are already subtlely sweet but you can taste its natural flavor. I am against this company's recipes diluting the main flavored products by using water to decrease the food costs. But this is so cheap they made this practice for their seasonal drinks. I think this is a whole ripoff!\n\nYou could make your own blueberry concentrate by doing this instead if you wanted the full flavor of blueberries - 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries +3 oz or 3 tbsps granulated sugar or your sweetener of choice + 1/2 lemon, juiced. Cook blueberry juice until the fruit has been fully cooked and extracted. Stir until sugar has been dissolved completely and blueberries have soften and extracted their juices over medium heat for 15 minutes.\n\nStrain the blueberry concentrate with a fine mesh over a large bowl to remove any solids like the skin. Let it cool completely.\n\nI would follow the similar recipe when making the blueberry concentrate, add 12 oz cold water. Stir. Store in a squeeze bottle or tall vertical mason jar. No need to add blue spirulina and beetroot powder for additional color, but you can put it in for added health benefits.\n\nFollow this recipe for making lavender concentrate from a previous post written a few days ago :\n\nyield: 3/4 cup lavender syrup\n\n3/4 cup or 6 oz granulated or cane sugar (or your sweetener of choice)\n\n3/4 cup or 6 oz hot water\n\n2 tbsps culinary-grade dried lavender buds\n\nAdd sugar and water to a small saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring frequently.\n\nAdd dried lavender buds and stir. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5-10 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nStrain syrup through a fine mesh sieve to remove lavender buds. Cool lavender syrup to room temperature.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbgqj5/joe_and_the_juice_seasonal_drinks_recipes_2024/", "created_utc": 1725741858.0, "score": 12, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbgqj5/joe_and_the_juice_seasonal_drinks_recipes_2024/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Old Jollibee Recipes from the 1990s or earlier", "selftext": "So there are few Jollibee recipes that I posted which are based on these recipes circa 1990s. This might their 2nd revision but it is worth a try making your favorites: [https://www.atbp.ph/2016/06/01/jollibee-top-secret-recipes/](https://www.atbp.ph/2016/06/01/jollibee-top-secret-recipes/)\n\nThe original source came from Scribd which was taken down or deleted by the original owner. So I took this from another Filipino website that featured some of the popular Filipino restaurants, and popular food items among us before they exported their brand to other countries worldwide where OFWs and other nationalities can try their menu items.\n\nLittle did I know that Jollibee opened its first restaurant in 1998 at Daly City, CA in the US.\n\nIf you are curious what is their old original recipe, here it is:\n\nOriginal Chickenjoy:\n\nIt is said that it can marinate 1 to 2 pounds of fryer chicken pieces, but you can use wings, ribwings (airline chicken), drumsticks, thighs, and breasts.\n\n\\*Their chicken supplier is Cargill Philippines.\n\n\\*Zenith Foods Corporation is the commissary that handles all of JFC and other food brands. Their production commissary handles all  of spices, sauces, pies, noodles, ChickenJoy and other products to make popular items from Jollibee. Then it is distributed to different warehouses all over the world to their own restaurants. They are all make the marinade and marinate it here on their commissary. So we don't know specifically what is inside the marinade.\n\n2 tbsps LoSalt Reduced Sodium Salt ( you can eliminate this if you cannot find it) + 2 tbsps kosher salt + 4 tbsps MSG or Maggi Magic Sarap + 1/8 tsp garlic powder + 1/3 cup of bottled Knorr Organic Chicken Concentrate + 5 cups water.\n\nMix all of the ingredients above in a big bin. Soak and submerge 1 -2 lbs of chicken. Cover and then refrigerate for 24 hours.\n\nHow to bread and cook their chicken:\n\n8 pieces of chicken, marinated\n\n2 large eggs, beaten + 1 cup milk (mix until dissolved completely in a medium dish)\n\n1 cup all purpose flour + 1/2 cup cornstarch + 1/2 cup potato starch + 2 tsps ground white pepper + 3 tbsps salt + 1 tsp MSG (ajinomoto or maggi magic sarap) + 1/8 tsp garlic powder +  1 dash paprika (for slight red in color after being fried or cooked). Mix all of these ingredients in a deep dish until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Set aside.\n\nAdd 6 cups Crisco shortening or vegetable shortening into a pressure cooker over medium heat until it reaches 400F. It is better to fry these chicken outside at the patio or backyard to avoid burning curtains or the whole house. \n\nOr you could fry chicken on a dutch oven and preheat at 400F. Just be careful when frying, and maintain it over MEDIUM heat. You would use about 3 to 4 cups shortening when using a dutch oven depending on how large it is.\n\nSubmerge chicken onto the egg mixture, and coat the chicken and dredge until fully coated and make sure breading mix are inside the skins to make sure it is fully coated.\n\nCarefully but quickly drop your chicken, or you can put it over a spider spatula and deep fry the chicken into a pressure cooker, Close the lid and cook for 10 minutes (8 minutes pressure frying it, then release  the pressure and air inside. Then cook for additional 2 minutes to finish frying the chicken).\n\nChicken should be golden, so transfer them on a wire rack over a baking sheet to let excess oil or fat drip onto the baking sheet while it is still cooling. Repeat these procedures for the remaining chicken pieces.\n\n++++\n\nJollibee Hamburger (or Yumburger):\n\n1 pound Angus ground beef (very typical in the Philippines to buy Australian Angus beef as it is imported and cheaper than local beef) + 10 small hamburger buns + 10 Bread and butter pickle slices + 10 dried minced onions + hamburger seasoning (4 tbsps salt+ 2 tbsps Accent MSG or Magic Sarap+ 1 tsp ground black pepper + 1/4 tsp onion powder. Mix all ingredients and transfer to shaker)) + hamburger sauce (1/2 cup Lady's Choice sandwich spread + 1 tbsp UFC Sweet Banana Ketchup + 1.5 tsps Yellow mustard)\n\nDivide the angus ground beef patties into 9 or 10 equal portions form into balls. then put each ball of hamburger patty over wax paper or 5 \"x 5\" square hamburger patties, then flatten to 1/4\" thick and 4 inches in diameter patties. Stack on top of each other. Wrap with plastic film. Then freeze a  minimum of 1 HR.\n\nThe dried minced onions is similar to McDonalds where you can buy at specialty groceries, Costco, Walmart which is found on the spice aisle. You just need 2 tbsps dried minced onions : add enough cold water to cover the onions in a tupperware container. Cover and let it sit for 15 minutes until you have some rehydrated onions for assembling the burgers.\n\nMix the sauce in a small bowl until combined.\n\nCook patties for 2.5 to 3 minutes per side until grilled and well done. Don't forget to season with hamburger seasoning on each side. Transfer to plate to make your Yumburger.\n\nToast the buns over a skillet or toaster oven until light golden. Add 1 tbsp  special burger sauce and spread it onto the heel of the bun. Add seasoned hamburger patty on top. Add cheddar cheese or sliced Eden cheese. Place the crown on top.\n\n+++++\n\nChickenJoy Gravy:\n\n2 tbsps butter or ChickenJoy Shortening (when you cooked the fried chicken from) + 2 tbsps all purpose flour + 1/2 cup milk + 1-10.5 oz Swansons Low Sodium chicken broth, 1/4 tsp ground white pepper.\n\nMake a roux by either melting butter or using the cooked shortening from the ChickenJoy that you had cooked earlier). Then add all purpose flour until you make a dark brown roux over MEDIUM HIGH HEAT for 3- 4 minutes on a saucepan. Add the chicken broth and the milk until it makes a chicken gravy. Season with ground white pepper. Taste if it taste like chicken gravy, if not season with little salt. Enjoy and serve warm with fried chicken.\n\nMushroom Gravy:  \nYou can do a similar process making a mushroom gravy. Make a roux by melting butter then adding all purpose flour until the flour is cooked to dark brown. Add 1 tbsp TJ Umami Mushroom seasoning to the mix. Add milk to tighten the gravy. If you want more umami taste, add the mushroom stock from the Shiitake mushrooms after you submerge them. You can eliminate this step and just add 1 - 2 tbsps water. Season with ground white pepper, and salt. \n\nThis is great if you are making burger steaks with the hamburger patties, then putting on the mushroom gravy, and adding sliced button mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms on top served with steamed rice, or better yet - garlic fried rice.\n\nJolly spaghetti - one of the users said that this recipe comes close to 99%, and here is their take on the Jolly spaghetti. You will find most of the ingredients at Weee!, Filipino or any Asian grocery stores and supermarkets elsewhere.\n\n1 kg spaghetti noodles (Royal but another brand will do- texture is softer than Al dente which is typical Filipino preference. But you can cook al dente, if you like) + 1 cup sliced Purefoods or Martin's Tender Juicy hotdogs (the red kind but you can use beef low-sodium hotdogs), sliced to 1/4\" + 1.5 packs of White King Fiesta Sweet blend sauce + 1 small bottle of UFC (not Jufran - way too sweet than this brand) 320grams or 11.29 oz Banana Ketchup + 2 medium white onions, peeled and chopped + 4 garlic cloves, chopped + 1 cup Del Monte (tangy tomato taste) or Hunt's (thick and hearty sweet tomato taste) tomato sauce + salt and ground black pepper to taste.\n\nCook spaghetti noodles over boiling water and use some salt. The texture should be little soft than al dente. Drain the pasta water, and transfer the spaghetti noodles over an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Set aside.\n\nAdd 2 tbsps canola oil on a large pot and preheat oil. Saute' the onions until translucent, then add the garlic until golden, add the 1 kg ground beef until cooked all the way through and well done. Add the sliced hotdogs until cooked. Add the White king sweet blend spaghetti sauce, ufc banana ketchup and the tomato sauce. Stir until all of the ingredients have come together over MEDIUM HEAT for 10 minutes. Decrease heat to LOW and simmer the sauce for additional 30 to 45 minutes, then season with salt and ground black pepper.\n\nTo serve this, ladle 1 cup spaghetti noodles on a plate. Scoop 1/2 cup or more of the spaghetti sauce over the noodles. Then grate some Magnolia's Quickmelt cheese or Kraft's processed cheddar or any semisoft white cheddar on top. Serve and enjoy!.\n\n++++++\n\n\n\n \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f5aqy8/old_jollibee_recipes_from_the_1990s_or_earlier/", "created_utc": 1725064532.0, "score": 53, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f5aqy8/old_jollibee_recipes_from_the_1990s_or_earlier/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Arby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread Recipe", "selftext": "So I searched on Uncle Phraedus - Hungry Browser on numerous occasions searching on secret recipes of numerous items. Here are some great find [HERE!](https://www.hungrybrowser.com/phaedrus/mainindex.htm)\n\nArby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread:\n\nthe person who shared the recipe is the person who developed the Arby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread. i've never eaten at arby's, but i hear rave reviews about the bread  \n  \n1 cup water  \n1 teaspoon salt  \n1/4 cup vegatable oil  \n1/4 cup honey  \n1 cup whole wheat flour  \n1 3/4 cup bread flour (or all purpose flour... which is what i had)  \n1 pkg. yeast  \n  \ni accidentally doubled the recipe and made two loaves... which was a good thing, because it vanished.  \n  \nthis is a great bread and technique for a bread that children will eat, because you fool them into eating healthy. also, along this note, the dough was quite wet for me, i added a good amount of flour when kneading... i'm going to use that opportunity to add \"thirsty\" ingredients to make it healthier (oats, wheat germ, flax meal). don't let the wet dough scare you.  \n  \nthis is the technique... which is VERY IMPORTANT for the soft squishy bread i was looking for.  \n  \n1. At 10:00 pm start sponge: mix all of the water, the whole wheat flour, and yeast in a large bowl. Use a spatula or wire wisk to mix thoroughly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.  \n  \n2. Early next morning: add remaining ingredients. Mix a few minutes until well incorporated. Cover again with plastic wrap and let sit (autolyse) for 30 minutes.  \n  \n3. Knead for 10-12 minutes. Dough will initially be very sticky. After 8 minutes the dough should be somewhat tacky. If needed this is the time to adjust your water or flour depending on whether the dough appears too wet or dry. Continue to knead another 3-4 minutes until gluten is developed. Mixing times depend on the flour, the mixer, the weather, etc but you will notice a change in how the dough balls up at the point of gluten development- knead another minute or two after this point.  \n  \n4. Place in lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap. After 30 minutes gently stretch dough slightly from each side towards center like an envelope gently stretching the dough from the sided to center. Flip over, cover again with plastic wrap, let rise another 20 minutes until not quite double in size.  \n  \n5. Turn oven on to 400 degrees. Grease loaf pan. Let rest for 10 minutes. Form gently into tight loaves, place in bread pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until not quite double, about 40-45 minutes.  \n  \n6. Slash loaves with a serrated knife \u00bc inch deep on the diagonal 5 times - rather than one long center cut. This ensures a better final shape. Place loaf in the hot oven on middle rack, quickly throw \u00bc cup of water on oven floor after loading loaf. Be quick to minimize heat loss and do not hit the light! After 5 minutes open door and throw another \u00bc cup of water on oven floor. At 10 minutes throw another \u00bc cup on the floor, shut door and then lower oven to 375 degrees. Bake another 40 minutes until 201 degree internal temperature.  \n  \n7. Remove from oven. Remove loaf from pan, place on wire rack to cool.  \n  \n8. Optional: hold a cold stick of butter with a napkin and put the end on the bread covering the top of the loaf with melted butter to keep a softer crust.  \n  \n9. Optional: After two hours or so when loaf is faintly warm place in plastic bag. The tiny bit of residual heat will cause bag to lightly mist inside which will ensure a soft crust that is more child friendly. Caution: doing this too soon will result in way too much moisture so make sure loaves are just about fully cooled.  \n  \n10. Optional: slice, and freeze unused portion. Loaf will stay fresh 4 days without spoilage before you need to put unused portion in the refrigerator.  \n  \n  \nyes, this is a bit long. but i'm a relatively new bread baker and this is a combination of the help from two people walking me through the process, step-by-step.  \n  \nif a term/technique is unclear, let me know and i'll explain.  \n  \nthis makes the BEST sandwich bread that has come out of my oven.  \n  \ni got this help from\u00a0[THEFRESHLOAF.COM](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/)\u00a0the people there are awesome and willing to share ALL their secrets.\n\n+++++", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f3tt7p/arbys_market_fresh_sandwich_bread_recipe/", "created_utc": 1724905654.0, "score": 24, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f3tt7p/arbys_market_fresh_sandwich_bread_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
