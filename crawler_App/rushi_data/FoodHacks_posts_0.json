There's no advertising or sneaky marketing on the site, just a passion for cooking and a way to improve my programming skills.\n\nAs someone who loves cooking and cares deeply about food waste, I'm really proud of what I\u2019ve built. I\u2019ve put a lot of time and energy into making Gumbo as user-friendly and effective as possible, and I\u2019m always working to improve the search algorithms and make it even easier to find great recipes.\n\nSo if you're ever in need of dinner inspiration, head over to [https://gumbo.co.uk](https://gumbo.co.uk/).

{"title": "Why I skip brining my turkey and instead just salt it ahead of time", "selftext": "Brining works. Both [J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/the-food-lab-the-truth-about-brining-turkey-thanksgiving.html) and [America\u2019s Test Kitchen](https://shop.americastestkitchen.com/science-of-good-cooking.html) have done similar experiments testing how a brine impacts the weight of meat after being soaked and then after cooking. The salt in the water dissolves proteins and loosens muscle filaments in the meat so it absorbs more water during the soak AND loses less moisture during cooking. It's pretty nifty.\n\nBut even though it works, I'm skipping the brine for my Thanksgiving turkey. Here's why:\n\n1. **Browning**: When you brine your turkey, the skin absorbs water too\u2013making it challenging for it to brown and crisp up. Because of the[ Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction), the browning that takes place on the surface is where we get most of our flavor. So juicy meat is great. But I also want flavor and a nice crispy texture.\n2. **Water-downed flavor**: The extra water the turkey absorbs during the brining process makes it taste less like turkey. Again, juicy meat is wonderful. But flavorful meat is better!\n3. **Space**: I don\u2019t know about you but my refrigerator is always full. But even more so leading up to Thanksgiving. So how the heck am I supposed to fit a 16-lb turkey submerged in 2\u20133 gallons of salty water?\n\nInstead, I just use salt.\n\nThis is something I picked up from folks like Samin Nosrat, J Kenji Lopez-Alt, and America's Test Kitchen. (AKA all people who are smarter/better cooks than me.)\n\nSalt is the magical ingredient that makes the proteins in the meat better at holding on to moisture. And salt is a small compound so it can penetrate deep into the meat, seasoning it all the way through.\n\nYou don\u2019t need water for the same benefits! So skip the water, save space in your fridge, and go for what some folks call a \"dry brine\". I just call it salting.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it: Start by rubbing salt into the cavity of your bird. Then rub salt on and underneath the skin of the breast and legs and in all the crevices you can find. Just make sure you salt your turkey 24\u201348 hours in advance to give it enough time to works its magic.\n\n*If you like cooking tips like this, I share others like it in a weekly newsletter called* [*Salt Sear Savor*](https://saltsearsavor.substack.com/)*.

Does that make any difference in my physical appearance (weight and face)\n\nI\u2019ve come across information suggesting that diet may play a role in facial inflammation.

I also tried eating crab out of the shell from a buffet and it was extremely salty and not fresh. I really want to start liking crab again but I don\u2019t want the strong fishy taste.

{"title": "Easy ground turkey protein addition", "selftext": "A nutritionist once told me an easy way to add protein to my diet was to have ground turkey around. That turned out to be some of the best eating advice I've followed - and I tweaked around with it over time to get easy tasty ground turkey to improve meals. \n\nI basically get a pack of 99% lean ground turkey every week. At the start of the week, I'll cook it and save it on its own, then use it in mostly lunches and occasionally dinners for the next few days (especially because my partner is pescatarian and I don't like fish, it helps to have pre-cooked protein to throw in). \n\nSo, how do I make ground turkey extra tasty? Cooking wine. \n\nI'll heat olive oil in a deep pan and add the ground turkey and maybe garlic if I have it on hand. Seasonings always salt & pepp, then sometimes fennel seeds, a little turmeric, whatever I feel like using. Then I cook, of course breaking up the ground turkey as I go. After \\~4-5 minutes, when it's almost mostly cooked, I'll add in a quarter-cup or so of the plain white $5 cooking wine I keep in my pantry. I've found that wine addition keeps the ground turkey from getting too dry, so it's tastier when I use it. \n\nBut really, shout out to ground turkey. Sometimes when I cook it I'll add a bag of \"cole slaw\" (basically just chopped cabbage) from Whole Foods, so it has veggies included; sometimes I'll use some soy sauce while cooking. I find fennel gives it a nice extra level to the taste so it's not as boring.

I've been on a quest to find the perfect microwave rice for a few weeks now. I started with Great Value, but it was flavorless and the texture reminded me of plastic. I've seen many people rave about Uncle Ben's, so I splurged on several flavors this past week. The first one I tried was tikka masala. I really liked the texture; it was fine and felt authentic since it's basmati rice. However, the flavor was off and had a strange odor that other flavors had as well, which I suspect might be the smell of microwaved plastic. Next, I tried red beans and rice. It was more palatable than the tikka masala, but the texture was mushy and it had that same weird odor. I regret buying so many different flavors of Uncle Ben's because each has been disappointing in one way or another. I've been choosing cheaper options, which might be why everything tastes bad. I'm picky about textures and prefer basmati because it's not sticky or mushy. I'm looking for something similar to basmati with flavor options, but I do not like mushy rice, which is why I lean towards basmati.

{"title": "Looking for some RICE!  ..(Specifically, a BASMATI-Style rice) BUT one that is WHOLEGRAIN/Brown.   Does it exist?", "selftext": "The reason I am after such a rice is two fold. \n\n1. Because I have a blood sugar condition and I have noticed almost any amount of white rice is very harsh on my system, i seem to absorb it like is apple juice.\n\n2. comparing the nutrients of wholegrain vs white its clear whole (brown rice) has so much more and it will save me time and money getting those nutrients from elsewhere.\n\n  \n.. Of course being basmati, i am assuming some kind of very-long-grain would do? I get confused between the grain sizes because honestly they have been so inconsistent, i.e. short grain described being longer than a long grain when i measure it, etc.\n\n  \nAlso, I am open to another type of grain that mimics basmati-rices texture, but after many years I haven't come across any except for a kind of wheat, i forget what its called, but its cooked like a pasta/couscous, but I am gluten free now anyway. But having tried all kinds like sorghum, quinoa, buckwheat, frankly, for me, NOTHING comes close to basmati rice for texture, taste, aroma, cooking time, versatility, flavour absorption, etc.\n\nFor reference I have tried numerous brown rices and they all suck. I hate the bitterness of them, the crunchiness, the chewiness, it's definitely NOT for me.\n\nAny ideas? \n\n  \n\\[TLDR\\] :\n\nQ. - Is there a variety/type of brown rice that is closest to WHITE basmati in texture and flavour?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodhacks/comments/1hu3k5z/looking_for_some_rice_specifically_a_basmatistyle/", "created_utc": 1736071243.0, "score": 0, "author": "poofypie384", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1hu3k5z/looking_for_some_rice_specifically_a_basmatistyle/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Love the crunchy and delicious half-popped kernels at the bottom of the bowl!? Here\u2019s how to make them\u2026 ", "selftext": "Hello. \n\nSo I have always loved digging through the bottom of an Orville Reddenbacher bag and finding those kernels that had just split partly open but not fully popped. They are crunchy and wonderful and super satisfying to eat. Very similar to a beer nut or something like that. \n\nWaaay back in like, 1998 Rosie O\u2019Donnell had a daytime talk show and I would watch it every day after school (rerun at 4pm). She used to showcase her favourite snacks and one of them was \u201chalf pops\u201d which, as the name suggests, was bagged half-popped popcorn flavoured with all different flavours like cheddar cheese, BBQ, and all the other typical chip flavours. \n\nI am Canadian and soon discovered that these were not available in Canada. One day my girlfriend at the time went to California with her family and I asked her to try to find them. She successfully came back with a bag - classic salt and butter flavoured. \n\nThat one bag was the best thing I\u2019ve ever had and ever since then I\u2019ve been chasing the perfect way to make my own at home\u2026. \n\nWell. I think I\u2019ve cracked it.\n\nSorry if this is reading like a food blog it\u2019s not intentional I just wanted to give some background. \n\nOkay here goes: \n\nYou will need: \n**Orville Reddenbacher popping corn**. It must be Orville\u2019s as I\u2019ve discovered not all popping kernels are created equal and some brands will not work with this method. \n\n**a cast iron pan with lid** \n\n**water** \n\n**canola oil or another oil with a high burn point** do not use olive oil \n\n**butter**\n\n**salt or other seasoning** \n\nPlace 1/3 cup of popping kernels into the cast iron pan with about 1\u201d of rapidly boiling water. \n\nAllow kernels to boil rapidly for 25-30 minutes (longer if you like them crunchier) \n\nRemove pan, dump water and kernels into seive or colander. \n\nAllow pan to cool for a few minutes. \n\nReduce heat to low-medium (I use setting 3 out of 10) and place pan back onto heat. \n\nAdd enough canola oil to coat entire bottom of pan. 2-3tbsp with my pan. \n\nAdd kernels and COVER (these things are literally like bullets when they pop and you don\u2019t want to take one in the lip\u2026 ask me how I know) \n\nListen as oil begins to sizzle and pop. Eventually the first kernels will start to pop. \n\nShake the pan around *frequently* to avoid burning. \n\nThe popping will slow, but it\u2019s probably not done yet. Keep shaking the pan around and new popped kernels will settle to the bottom and pop. \n\nContinue doing this until the time between pops slows to 2-3 seconds despite shaking the pan around. \n\nMove the pan to a cold burner. Continue shaking the pan around to avoid burning while you wait until you\u2019re certain there will be no more pops (can you tell I\u2019m traumatized by taking a high speed lava hot kernel to the lip?). \n\nOpen the lid and add 1-2tbsp of butter depending on how buttery you want them. Salt or season and shake the pan around again while it all melts and coats the kernels. \n\nDump the pan into a bowl. Allow to cool and enjoy. \n\nIt\u2019s a labour of love for me but it\u2019s my favourite snack. \n\nFair warning if you didn\u2019t pop all the kernels there may still be some hard unpopped kernels in there so watch your teeth. Just do what I do and pick one or two at a time that you are sure have split, toss them in your mouth, crunch and repeat. \n\nYou\u2019ll end up with a few you don\u2019t wanna eat just like any bag of popcorn but it\u2019s better than a busted tooth! \n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/bpmt7ulki48e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1734752751.0, "score": 0, "author": "FatFaceFaster", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1hj1h61/love_the_crunchy_and_delicious_halfpopped_kernels/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How does lack of sleep affect hunger and food choices during the day?", "selftext": "Lack of sleep has a significant impact on two key hormones that regulate hunger: ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is known as the \"hunger hormone\" because it stimulates appetite, while leptin, the \"satiety hormone,\" signals to your brain that you\u2019re full. When you don\u2019t get enough sleep, the body produces more ghrelin and less leptin, creating a situation where you feel hungrier than usual and less satisfied after eating. This hormonal imbalance is a major reason why people tend to eat more when they\u2019re sleep-deprived.\n\nMoreover, the lack of sleep alters the brain's reward system. Studies show that sleep deprivation activates the areas of the brain associated with reward and cravings, leading you to seek high-calorie, sugary, and carb-heavy foods. These quick-energy foods temporarily boost energy levels but are harmful to long-term weight loss goals. The combination of heightened hunger and cravings for unhealthy foods creates a vicious cycle that can result in overeating.\n\nSleep deprivation also impairs decision-making abilities. When you're tired, your willpower is lower, making it harder to resist tempting, unhealthy food choices. Even if you\u2019re committed to a healthy diet, lack of sleep can lead to poor decisions, such as snacking on junk food or eating larger portions, because the body is desperate for energy. In this way, sleep deprivation sabotages both your hunger hormones and your food choices.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodhacks/comments/1ftmd9i/how_does_lack_of_sleep_affect_hunger_and_food/", "created_utc": 1727784141.0, "score": 36, "author": "yuvaap", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1ftmd9i/how_does_lack_of_sleep_affect_hunger_and_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "How to quickly rescue stale snacks in an air-fryer:", "selftext": "**Disclaimer**: I googled-back a few pages on this sub, upon this specific tip, but couldn't find similar.  Please delete if redundant.  Otherwise...\n\n**LET'S GO!**: An air-fryer (mini-convection oven super-cheap and popular these days) is my buddy go-to for quickly crisping up any kind of stale snack.\n\n**WHY BETTER THAN AN OVEN?**: In short, we're talking a couple minutes on a table-top AF device vs. a more laborious, longer, inefficient process via roomier, clumsier oven.  Our snacks need us more quickly, dude! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**EXAMPLES**: Believe it or not, plain popcorn can do 3-4mins at standard blast of 370\u00b0F and turn out delightfully refreshed & crispy. (as usual tho, don't eat it hot, but let it cool down)\n\n**Note**: just make sure that if it's powdered with cheese, then you set the temp and time somewhat down, otherwise cheese-powder burns.\n\nIronically, snacks like Cheez-its (tm) also work at full blast, 4min, but most stuff needs lower intensity.\n\nFor example, I like those Swedish \"Wasa\" crackers, but it just goes to show that heating times can vary dramatically. Those only need about ~220\u00b0F at two minutes to get nice & crisp. (otherwise they'll burn)\n\nSo I'd say just experiment gently and make a little chart for best crisping times per snack. Your tastebuds (and garbage can) will thank you. :D\n\n\nOoh, ooh-- I also jam a round, disposable baking pan in first so that the snacks don't fall in to the vents. Then use a metal kitchen tongs to lift the whole pan out, once done. \\^^\n\nHope that helps someone.  \n(I really love my AF, lol)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodhacks/comments/1fsw7lx/how_to_quickly_rescue_stale_snacks_in_an_airfryer/", "created_utc": 1727704740.0, "score": 39, "author": "JohnnyEnzyme", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1fsw7lx/how_to_quickly_rescue_stale_snacks_in_an_airfryer/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Why do we crave sugary and fatty foods when we\u2019re sleep-deprived?", "selftext": "When you're sleep-deprived, your brain's reward system becomes more sensitive to high-calorie, sugary, and fatty foods. Sleep deprivation increases activity in the brain's amygdala (which processes emotions) and decreases activity in the prefrontal cortex (responsible for rational decision-making). This means you\u2019re more likely to reach for comfort foods when tired because your brain craves an emotional lift.\n\nNot only do hunger hormones like ghrelin increase, but dopamine levels also rise, which makes sugary foods feel even more rewarding. This combination makes resisting unhealthy snacks extremely difficult when you haven\u2019t slept enough. In fact, studies have shown that people who sleep less tend to eat an additional 300-500 calories per day.\n\nIn the long term, regular cravings for and consumption of sugary and fatty foods can lead to weight gain, increased body fat percentage, and a higher risk of metabolic disorders. Prioritizing sleep can help break this cycle and prevent these intense cravings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodhacks/comments/1fsnz7j/why_do_we_crave_sugary_and_fatty_foods_when_were/", "created_utc": 1727672868.0, "score": 61, "author": "yuvaap", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1fsnz7j/why_do_we_crave_sugary_and_fatty_foods_when_were/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I've seen this method shared endlessly yet after about a week my grapes are moldy and strawberries are mushy. Am I doing something wrong, or is this normal?\n\nOther specific questions: best way to store citrus items, best way to wash/store kale, which crisper drawer do I put bananas in once they're ripe.

{"title": "How to easily make the best AND healthiest peanut better ever", "selftext": "I think this qualifies as a food hack? If not, feel free to delete!\n\nI eat a lot of peanut butter; and man, this is so good I'm never going back. Here's what you need:\n\n1. A store that has those machines that grind peanuts for you (I know -- at this point you're thinking, \"That's it? Duh!\" But there's more.)\n2. Peanut oil\n3. Salt\n4. Honey\n5. A stand mixer; or a hand mixer with the dough-hook attachments.\n\nHere's what you do.\n\n1. First, I go to the deli section of my supermarket and ask for a soup container. They're bigger than the ones that are sitting by the peanut-butter machines. Your mileage here may vary.\n2. Grind the peanuts into the container and bring the peanut butter home. At this point it will be very bland and not very good.\n3. Scoop the PB into a mixing bowl. Add:\n   1. Peanut oil for consistency\n   2. Salt (to taste) for flavor. This will require a little experimentation.\n   3. Honey (to taste) for sweetness. This also will require a little testing.\n4. Blend. I use a hand mixer with dough hooks, as they are going to give you more torque (power) than the regular attachments. This step only takes a minute.\n5. Transfar back to plastic container, or cover bowl with lid or whatever.\n\nThat's it! For a minimum of labor, you end up with PB that is tastier, healthier and sometimes even cheaper than the stuff in the jars.\n\n**BONUS**: Set some of your new PB aside into a separate bowl. Mix with cocoa powder and a little extra honey, to taste.

{"title": "What's happening with my strawberries?", "selftext": "I purchased these strawberries at a Farmers Market. A few weeks ago, I was able to store them well enough to last all week. My method was to soak them for 3-5 minutes in a bath of 6 cups water, 3/4 cup vinegar, wait for them to dry, then lay them on a paper towel, lay a paper towel on top and add another layer of berries, and so on. (Detailed in this video https://youtu.be/PsYlbR0C16U?t=3m9s ) Finally, I place the lid on, and put the container in the fridge.\n\nLately I've been doing 3 cups water 1 cup vinegar instead because it is easier to remember, and I soak them for more like 5-8 minutes. Because I have such a high volume of strawberries, I pat them dry instead of waiting, and I dump each layer onto the paper towel instead of arranging them perfectly. This time I used ACV instead of white vinegar. I saw that the berries were a little moist, so after I let them sit in the container a few hours, I removed them and repeated the layering with new, dry paper towels.\n\nI don't know if it's because I'm buying them in the summer heat and driving them home in a hot car, or if my vinegar portion is no good, but these berries are holding miserably. I bought these on Saturday and it's only Monday today. What are these moist spots? I've been cutting them off and tossing the okay bits in the freezer, but should I be tossing the berries?

But with a good stainless steel wok (which he also teaches you how to season).\n\nOther hacks mentioned in the comments and others I've found deep diving in the Wok Hei rabbit hole are: \n\n- Torch Hei (charring the ingredients with a blow torch while stir frying)\n- IMPORTANT: Use day old cooked rice, preferably Jasmine rice. \n- [Smoky Soy Sauce](https://www.justonecookbook.com/smoked-soy-sauce-recipe/) (a combination of a dash of liquid smoke and soy sauce, that will add more of that smoky flavor)\n- Refined Peanut Oil, a high smoke point oil that will not burn. \n- Roasted Black Sesame oil (for more of the roasted effect. Add this at the end of the stir fry session as part of the seasoning)\n- [Grill Flavor Powder](https://www.firehousepantrystore.com/grillflavorpowder.html). By using a pin point of this powder you can intensify the effect even more, especially when you don\u2019t have the essential equipments (stainless steel woks, blow torch and so on)\n- [Shaoxing Wine](https://www.recipetineats.com/shaoxing-wine-chinese-cooking-wine/) for that extra something restaurant quality style Chinese food.

Cooking wine. \n\nI'll heat olive oil in a deep pan and add the ground turkey and maybe garlic if I have it on hand.

After \\~4-5 minutes, when it's almost mostly cooked, I'll add in a quarter-cup or so of the plain white $5 cooking wine I keep in my pantry.

I've seen many people rave about Uncle Ben's, so I splurged on several flavors this past week. The first one I tried was tikka masala. I really liked the texture; it was fine and felt authentic since it's basmati rice. However, the flavor was off and had a strange odor that other flavors had as well, which I suspect might be the smell of microwaved plastic. Next, I tried red beans and rice. It was more palatable than the tikka masala, but the texture was mushy and it had that same weird odor. I regret buying so many different flavors of Uncle Ben's because each has been disappointing in one way or another. I've been choosing cheaper options, which might be why everything tastes bad. I'm picky about textures and prefer basmati because it's not sticky or mushy.

She successfully came back with a bag - classic salt and butter flavoured. \n\nThat one bag was the best thing I\u2019ve ever had and ever since then I\u2019ve been chasing the perfect way to make my own at home\u2026. \n\nWell. I think I\u2019ve cracked it.\n\nSorry if this is reading like a food blog it\u2019s not intentional I just wanted to give some background. \n\nOkay here goes: \n\nYou will need: \n**Orville Reddenbacher popping corn**. It must be Orville\u2019s as I\u2019ve discovered not all popping kernels are created equal and some brands will not work with this method. \n\n**a cast iron pan with lid** \n\n**water** \n\n**canola oil or another oil with a high burn point** do not use olive oil \n\n**butter**\n\n**salt or other seasoning** \n\nPlace 1/3 cup of popping kernels into the cast iron pan with about 1\u201d of rapidly boiling water. \n\nAllow kernels to boil rapidly for 25-30 minutes (longer if you like them crunchier) \n\nRemove pan, dump water and kernels into seive or colander. \n\nAllow pan to cool for a few minutes. \n\nReduce heat to low-medium (I use setting 3 out of 10) and place pan back onto heat. \n\nAdd enough canola oil to coat entire bottom of pan. 2-3tbsp with my pan. \n\nAdd kernels and COVER (these things are literally like bullets when they pop and you don\u2019t want to take one in the lip\u2026 ask me how I know) \n\nListen as oil begins to sizzle and pop. Eventually the first kernels will start to pop. \n\nShake the pan around *frequently* to avoid burning. \n\nThe popping will slow, but it\u2019s probably not done yet. Keep shaking the pan around and new popped kernels will settle to the bottom and pop. \n\nContinue doing this until the time between pops slows to 2-3 seconds despite shaking the pan around. \n\nMove the pan to a cold burner. Continue shaking the pan around to avoid burning while you wait until you\u2019re certain there will be no more pops (can you tell I\u2019m traumatized by taking a high speed lava hot kernel to the lip?). \n\nOpen the lid and add 1-2tbsp of butter depending on how buttery you want them. Salt or season and shake the pan around again while it all melts and coats the kernels. \n\nDump the pan into a bowl. Allow to cool and enjoy. \n\nIt\u2019s a labour of love for me but it\u2019s my favourite snack. \n\nFair warning if you didn\u2019t pop all the kernels there may still be some hard unpopped kernels in there so watch your teeth. Just do what I do and pick one or two at a time that you are sure have split, toss them in your mouth, crunch and repeat. \n\nYou\u2019ll end up with a few you don\u2019t wanna eat just like any bag of popcorn but it\u2019s better than a busted tooth! \n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/bpmt7ulki48e1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1734752751.0, "score": 0, "author": "FatFaceFaster", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1hj1h61/love_the_crunchy_and_delicious_halfpopped_kernels/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How does lack of sleep affect hunger and food choices during the day?", "selftext": "Lack of sleep has a significant impact on two key hormones that regulate hunger: ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is known as the \"hunger hormone\" because it stimulates appetite, while leptin, the \"satiety hormone,\" signals to your brain that you\u2019re full. When you don\u2019t get enough sleep, the body produces more ghrelin and less leptin, creating a situation where you feel hungrier than usual and less satisfied after eating. This hormonal imbalance is a major reason why people tend to eat more when they\u2019re sleep-deprived.\n\nMoreover, the lack of sleep alters the brain's reward system. Studies show that sleep deprivation activates the areas of the brain associated with reward and cravings, leading you to seek high-calorie, sugary, and carb-heavy foods. These quick-energy foods temporarily boost energy levels but are harmful to long-term weight loss goals. The combination of heightened hunger and cravings for unhealthy foods creates a vicious cycle that can result in overeating.\n\nSleep deprivation also impairs decision-making abilities. When you're tired, your willpower is lower, making it harder to resist tempting, unhealthy food choices. Even if you\u2019re committed to a healthy diet, lack of sleep can lead to poor decisions, such as snacking on junk food or eating larger portions, because the body is desperate for energy. In this way, sleep deprivation sabotages both your hunger hormones and your food choices.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodhacks/comments/1ftmd9i/how_does_lack_of_sleep_affect_hunger_and_food/", "created_utc": 1727784141.0, "score": 37, "author": "yuvaap", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1ftmd9i/how_does_lack_of_sleep_affect_hunger_and_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "How to quickly rescue stale snacks in an air-fryer:", "selftext": "**Disclaimer**: I googled-back a few pages on this sub, upon this specific tip, but couldn't find similar.  Please delete if redundant.  Otherwise...\n\n**LET'S GO!**: An air-fryer (mini-convection oven super-cheap and popular these days) is my buddy go-to for quickly crisping up any kind of stale snack.\n\n**WHY BETTER THAN AN OVEN?**: In short, we're talking a couple minutes on a table-top AF device vs. a more laborious, longer, inefficient process via roomier, clumsier oven.  Our snacks need us more quickly, dude! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**EXAMPLES**: Believe it or not, plain popcorn can do 3-4mins at standard blast of 370\u00b0F and turn out delightfully refreshed & crispy. (as usual tho, don't eat it hot, but let it cool down)\n\n**Note**: just make sure that if it's powdered with cheese, then you set the temp and time somewhat down, otherwise cheese-powder burns.\n\nIronically, snacks like Cheez-its (tm) also work at full blast, 4min, but most stuff needs lower intensity.\n\nFor example, I like those Swedish \"Wasa\" crackers, but it just goes to show that heating times can vary dramatically. Those only need about ~220\u00b0F at two minutes to get nice & crisp. (otherwise they'll burn)\n\nSo I'd say just experiment gently and make a little chart for best crisping times per snack. Your tastebuds (and garbage can) will thank you. :D\n\n\nOoh, ooh-- I also jam a round, disposable baking pan in first so that the snacks don't fall in to the vents. Then use a metal kitchen tongs to lift the whole pan out, once done. \\^^\n\nHope that helps someone.  \n(I really love my AF, lol)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/foodhacks/comments/1fsw7lx/how_to_quickly_rescue_stale_snacks_in_an_airfryer/", "created_utc": 1727704740.0, "score": 38, "author": "JohnnyEnzyme", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/foodhacks/comments/1fsw7lx/how_to_quickly_rescue_stale_snacks_in_an_airfryer/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Why do we crave sugary and fatty foods when we\u2019re sleep-deprived?", "selftext": "When you're sleep-deprived, your brain's reward system becomes more sensitive to high-calorie, sugary, and fatty foods. Sleep deprivation increases activity in the brain's amygdala (which processes emotions) and decreases activity in the prefrontal cortex (responsible for rational decision-making). This means you\u2019re more likely to reach for comfort foods when tired because your brain craves an emotional lift.\n\nNot only do hunger hormones like ghrelin increase, but dopamine levels also rise, which makes sugary foods feel even more rewarding. This combination makes resisting unhealthy snacks extremely difficult when you haven\u2019t slept enough. In fact, studies have shown that people who sleep less tend to eat an additional 300-500 calories per day.\n\nIn the long term, regular cravings for and consumption of sugary and fatty foods can lead to weight gain, increased body fat percentage, and a higher risk of metabolic disorders.

If not, feel free to delete!\n\nI eat a lot of peanut butter; and man, this is so good I'm never going back. Here's what you need:\n\n1. A store that has those machines that grind peanuts for you (I know -- at this point you're thinking, \"That's it? Duh!\" But there's more.)\n2. Peanut oil\n3. Salt\n4. Honey\n5. A stand mixer; or a hand mixer with the dough-hook attachments.\n\nHere's what you do.\n\n1. First, I go to the deli section of my supermarket and ask for a soup container. They're bigger than the ones that are sitting by the peanut-butter machines. Your mileage here may vary.\n2. Grind the peanuts into the container and bring the peanut butter home. At this point it will be very bland and not very good.\n3. Scoop the PB into a mixing bowl. Add:\n   1. Peanut oil for consistency\n   2. Salt (to taste) for flavor. This will require a little experimentation.\n   3. Honey (to taste) for sweetness. This also will require a little testing.\n4. Blend. I use a hand mixer with dough hooks, as they are going to give you more torque (power) than the regular attachments. This step only takes a minute.\n5. Transfar back to plastic container, or cover bowl with lid or whatever.\n\nThat's it! For a minimum of labor, you end up with PB that is tastier, healthier and sometimes even cheaper than the stuff in the jars.\n\n**BONUS**: Set some of your new PB aside into a separate bowl. Mix with cocoa powder and a little extra honey, to taste.

{"title": "What's happening with my strawberries?", "selftext": "I purchased these strawberries at a Farmers Market. A few weeks ago, I was able to store them well enough to last all week. My method was to soak them for 3-5 minutes in a bath of 6 cups water, 3/4 cup vinegar, wait for them to dry, then lay them on a paper towel, lay a paper towel on top and add another layer of berries, and so on. (Detailed in this video https://youtu.be/PsYlbR0C16U?t=3m9s ) Finally, I place the lid on, and put the container in the fridge.\n\nLately I've been doing 3 cups water 1 cup vinegar instead because it is easier to remember, and I soak them for more like 5-8 minutes. Because I have such a high volume of strawberries, I pat them dry instead of waiting, and I dump each layer onto the paper towel instead of arranging them perfectly. This time I used ACV instead of white vinegar. I saw that the berries were a little moist, so after I let them sit in the container a few hours, I removed them and repeated the layering with new, dry paper towels.\n\nI don't know if it's because I'm buying them in the summer heat and driving them home in a hot car, or if my vinegar portion is no good, but these berries are holding miserably. I bought these on Saturday and it's only Monday today. What are these moist spots? I've been cutting them off and tossing the okay bits in the freezer, but should I be tossing the berries? It's not mold, is it? Some of the berries look yellow on the inside, but I think they were like that when I bought them.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?

Add this at the end of the stir fry session as part of the seasoning)\n- [Grill Flavor Powder](https://www.firehousepantrystore.com/grillflavorpowder.html). By using a pin point of this powder you can intensify the effect even more, especially when you don\u2019t have the essential equipments (stainless steel woks, blow torch and so on)\n- [Shaoxing Wine](https://www.recipetineats.com/shaoxing-wine-chinese-cooking-wine/) for that extra something restaurant quality style Chinese food.
