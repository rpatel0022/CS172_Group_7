{"title": "\"Fifteen years ago, a woman named Robin Chapman made a pot roast in her slow cooker. Now known as Mississippi Roast, it would become one of the most popular recipes on the web, an unlikely star with unlikely ingredients.\"", "selftext": "From [The Improbable Rise of Mississippi Roast](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/dining/mississippi-roast.html), New York Times, 2016/01/27\n\n-----------------------------\n\nFifteen or so years ago, by her recollection, a woman named Robin Chapman made a pot roast in her slow cooker. Now known as Mississippi Roast, it would eventually become one of the most popular recipes on the web, an unlikely star with unlikely ingredients, a favorite of the mom-blog set.\n\nMs. Chapman lives in Ripley, Miss., but she did not call her pot roast Mississippi Roast, not then and not now. She just calls it \u201croast.\u201d She used beef chuck to make the dish that first time, she told me in an interview, and put a packet of dry ranch-dressing mix on top of the meat, along with a packet of dry \u201cau jus\u201d gravy, a stick of butter and a few pepperoncini. It was an on-the-spot variation of a recipe she had learned from her aunt, which called for packaged Italian dressing. Ms. Chapman wanted something \u201cmilder,\u201d she said, so she swapped out the Italian for the ranch.\n\nShe set the slow cooker to low and walked away. Some hours later, her family dived into their meal with glee. She has made the roast ever since. And largely unnoticed by food writers and scholars, the recipe has slowly taken on a life of its own.\n\nThe story of that twisting road to fame began a few months after the dish\u2019s creation, when Ms. Chapman prepared the roast for Karen Farese, a friend \u201csince we were diapers,\u201d Ms. Chapman said. Ms. Farese loved her dinner, and eventually contributed a recipe for it to a cookbook put together by her congregation, the Beech Hill Church of Christ, also in Ripley. Ms. Farese did not call the dish Mississippi Roast either. She called it \u201croast beef.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say that was over 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nOne Beech Hill congregant, Judy Ward, started making Ms. Farese\u2019s recipe for Sunday lunch at her family\u2019s home near Ripley, in Hickory Flat. Laurie Ormon of Bentonville, Ark., is Ms. Ward\u2019s niece by marriage, and she told me she ate the dish when she and her husband were visiting the area in 2010. She wrote about it soon after on her blog, Laurie\u2019s Life.\n\n\u201cThe best roast in the world,\u201d she called it in her post. While admitting that \u201cthe recipe sounded awful\u201d and that she hated ranch dressing, she stood strong on the deliciousness of the meal. \u201cYou have got to make this if you like a good roast,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTrust me on this.\u201d\n\nSome did. And a few months later, at the start of 2011, another blogger, Candis Berge, published the recipe on her site, A Perfectly Lovely Ordinary Day, writing that she got the recipe \u201cfrom a blogger named Laurie. She got it from her husband\u2019s aunt and lots of her blog followers are now sold on this roast. So am I. So is hubby.\u201d\n\nThen Ms. Berge switched to italics: \u201cThat\u2019s the important test in this house \u2026 the hubby test.\u201d\n\nMs. Berge called Ms. Ormon\u2019s recipe Mississippi Roast. And in August 2011, according to Christine Schirmer, a spokeswoman for Pinterest, a \u201cpinner\u201d called the Prairie Cottage posted a link to the recipe, saving the image to her \u201cbeef/pork\u201d board.\n\nBy fits and starts at first, and more recently in droves, people began sharing the image and the recipe on Pinterest and Reddit, on Facebook and Twitter. Ms. Schirmer said that since the start of 2014, the recipe for Mississippi Roast has been pinned more than one million times. A search for the term on Google yields tens of thousands of recipe links, many of them leading back to Ms. Berge or mentioning a sighting on Pinterest. \u201cOh heavens me,\u201d reads one introduction, on the Hungry Housewife blog. \u201cI can not even begin to explain to you how delicious and easy this dinner is.\u201d\n\nOutside the blogosphere, however, the success of Mississippi Roast has been a quiet one. It has gone widely unnoticed by the journalists and academics who document the food culture of the American South, perhaps because it sounds so unappetizing.\n\nJohn T. Edge, the director of the Southern Foodways Alliance at the University of Mississippi, who has contributed to The Times, said he had never heard of Mississippi Roast. I described it to him. \u201cCould it be that it was associated with Mississippi in a dismissive way,\u201d he asked, \u201c\u00e0 la Ernie Mickler and his \u2018White Trash Cooking\u2019 book? As in, this is the kind of food those folks eat? That would be my best guess.\u201d\n\nFrederick Douglass Opie, a professor of history and foodways at Babson College and a fount of knowledge about cooking across the South, was likewise stumped. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one for me,\u201d he said.\n\nEven Kathleen Purvis, the food editor of The Charlotte Observer in North Carolina and one of the world\u2019s best sources of information on Southern cooking, professed ignorance. \u201cNot me, Sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d have called it Tar Heel Roast.\u201d\n\nTo see what the fuss was about, I set out to make Mississippi Roast myself. An initial run at the recipe, strictly as written, yielded a tangle of soft and luscious beef, richly flavored with butter and salt, with a low vinegar zip from the pickled peppers. There was a faint chemical bite, yes, from the packaged dressing and gravy, but the dish was objectively good, even delicious.\n\nStill: packaged dry ranch-dressing mix? Packaged dry gravy mix? These are built on foundations of salt and monosodium glutamate, artificial flavors, artificial colors, polysyllabic ingredients that are difficult to pronounce much less identify. Surely they could be replaced without increasing by much the prep time for the roast.\n\nAs for the full stick of butter Ms. Chapman used, I reckoned I could go with less. There is plenty of fat in a chuck roast. And Ms. Farese called for using \u201c2 or more pepperoncini\u201d in her recipe in the church cookbook. I thought many more \u2014 eight to 10 \u2014 would answer more clearly, providing some zing against the richness of the sauce.\n\nI seared the roast before placing it in the slow cooker, browning it aggressively beneath a shower of salt and pepper and a coating of all-purpose flour that I hoped would create a fond, or base of flavor, to replace the gravy mix, and give some structure to the sauce. I placed it in the slow cooker with a half-stick of unsalted butter and all my pepperoncini.\n\nWhile that started to heat, I made a small portion of ranch dressing: some mayonnaise and dried dill, cider vinegar and a splash of buttermilk, just a few tablespoons in all, seasoned with a dash of paprika. And I dumped that over the top of the meat.\n\nEight hours later, my family dived into their meal with glee. It was exactly the same as the original effort, and took about the same amount of time to make.\n\nMs. Farese has twins, Katherine and Michael, both seniors at the University of Mississippi. Recently, she said, a friend of theirs served them the roast for dinner. \u201cWhere did you get this recipe?\u201d Katherine asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a Mississippi Roast,\u201d the host replied. \u201cI found the recipe on Pinterest.\u201d\n\nMs. Farese laughed at the children\u2019s response. \u201cNo,\u201d Michael said, \u201cthis is my mama\u2019s roast.\u201d\n\nThis soft, beefy roast calls for a robust, structured red that will both complement the flavor of the meat and accommodate the bite of the peppers. If you want an Italian red with plenty of acidity, consider a Brunello di Montalcino or its more modest sibling, Rosso di Montalcino. For a little more friendly fruit, perhaps a nero d\u2019Avola blend from Sicily or Puglia, or even a ripasso Valpolicella from Veneto. From Spain, try a garnacha-based wine from Montsant or its grander neighbor, Priorat. Or maybe the same grape, grenache, as interpreted in the southern Rh\u00f4ne, like a Gigondas or a Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape. A good California grenache or mourv\u00e8dre (sometimes called mataro) would work well, and if you are a fan of Argentine malbec, try one.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/7meiuz/fifteen_years_ago_a_woman_named_robin_chapman/", "created_utc": 1514374320.0, "score": 2263, "author": "One_Giant_Nostril", "num_comments": 135, "permalink": "/r/slowcooking/comments/7meiuz/fifteen_years_ago_a_woman_named_robin_chapman/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Learn from my mistake!!! A PSA about dried beans", "selftext": "The post-Thanksgiving season is upon us, which means that some of you may be trying to find some nice stew recipes for your leftover turkey, ham, etc. \n\nI came across [this recipe](https://www.tablespoon.com/recipes/slow-cooker-ham-white-bean-and-potato-soup/aa2d5f89-4cf6-41e9-bbf5-2a8e1b9e79f5?utm_campaign=yummly&utm_medium=yummly&utm_source=yummly) for a ham and potato stew on Saturday and decided to give it a try! \n\n\nI followed the instructions carefully, including the part about adding a pound of *dried* Great Northern beans. I normally make chilis with canned beans, but I really didn't think twice about the dried ones. They were to be cooked in broth and other vegetables for several hours, so no problem, right?\n\n\n**WRONG.** I came down with pretty severe food poisoning that evening and it is still ongoing today (Monday.) After a bit of googling, I figured out that the culprit was indeed the Great Northern bean, which I had failed to cook all the way through (apparently.)\n\n\nI'm the type of person who likes their pasta *al dente* and often prefers raw vegetables to cooked ones, so when my beans came out a little more firm than I was used to, I thought nothing of it and just chalked it up to them having been dry when I started. Little did I know, that a compound called *lectin* is present in uncooked and undercooked beans. Lectin is produced by the bean plant as a way to deter predators from eating it. Apparently, animals can smell it and know to stay away, but it is undetectable to the human nose. Luckily, lectin leaves the beans if they're cooked to completion. \n\n\nI know that pre-cooking or soaking beans before preparing a meal may seem obvious to some of you. However, as a relatively young person whose mother only ever bought canned beans, the idea of soaking my beans overnight or even cooking them before making the stew at all, had never occurred to me. I just blindly followed a recipe. \n\n\n**TL;DR** Undercooked beans gave me food poisoning. I never knew that undercooked beans could be harmful, wanted to pass on that knowledge to anyone else who is trying to stew some leftovers.

An idea i've had to mitigate the overcooking is to essentially make a kind of vegetable soup overnight then add the meat the morning after for another 5-6 hours or w/e to get the richness of a 12+ hour slow cook without giving the meat the texture of leather but i've yet to experiment with that concept  \n  \nany insight is appreciated :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1k2vtm3/a_question_of_technique/", "created_utc": 1745067903.0, "score": 3, "author": "Macksimoose", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/slowcooking/comments/1k2vtm3/a_question_of_technique/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Advice for a Mississippi pot roast?", "selftext": "I have a work pot luck tomorrow at lunch. For some reason the first thing that came to mind was a Mississippi pot roast. I'm second guessing this decision now but we had to mark what we are bringing and it's too late now to change things.\n\nIt's been a couple years since I made it but I remember it being very salty and am thinking I should tone it down a bit. I'm thinking to maybe sear the meat first, add chopped onions, a cup of beef broth with red wine, and probably a 1/4 cup of flour. I'm also thinking to put in half the au jus pack and 3/4 the ranch pack. Cooking on low for 12 hours. My roast is 2.5lbs.\n\nAnybody tried these ideas? Any mississippi pot roast veterans on here? Thoughts?\n\nThat or should I just make the NY Times variant?\n\n\nEdit: First off, it got rave reviews! Somebody brought in buns and I brought in some pickled red onions so most people end up making sandwiches. \n\nI made a few slight tweaks but not everything I originally listed. Here's what I ended up doing: \n-I patted the meat dry then rolled it in flour and pepper. I then seared it in a pan until some nice colour formed on all sides.\n-I used some no salt added beef stock to deglaze the pan and added that to the slow cooker. \n-I added four sliced onions to the bottom of the slow cooker and covered with one cup of the no salt added beef stock.\n-Instead of the au jus I used a package of Club House caramelized onion and bacon gravy mix. Mainly used this because it had 40% less sodium. I started with 3/4 of the package but when tasting the sauce when shredding I decided it needed the rest of the package.\n-Used 2/3 of the ranch packet and 6 TBSP of unsalted butter (3/4 of what was called for).\n-I added 12 pepperoncinis which I cut into slices and removed the stems and seeds. Also added about 1/4 cup of the liquid.\n-Added a 2TBSP/2TBSP corn starch water slurry about 3 hours before it was served.\n-Cooked on low for 12 hours instead of 8.\n\nThe end result was a pulled beef which was incredibly tender and not overly salty at all. The acidity of the pepperoncini was a stronger flavour than the salt of the gravy. I think the onions and beef stock absorb most of the salt to avoid that oversaltiness. \n\nFor my personal tastes, I actually would've liked a little more salt and a little less acidity, so I'd probably have used the au jus mix if making for myself. For an intro to the dish for a group though this was really good. The spice level was also great for this setting. Lots of people commented there was a bit of heat which creeps up on you but nobody said it was too hot for them.\n\nThat's my experience. Hope this helps someone in the future!

{"title": "Yogurt powder sachets", "selftext": "Hi all, sorry if this has been posted already, I couldn\u2019t find the answer to my question searching this group so I figured I would ask anyway. I have been using a yogurt maker and store bought yogurt powder sachets. I\u2019m not sure if these sachets are available/common in other countries ( I am in New Zealand). Unfortunately my yogurt maker has broken and since I already have a slow cooker I figured I should try and use that before re purchasing the yogurt maker. I know you can use milk and a starter of a pre made yogurt to make yogurt in the slow cooker however my partner doesn\u2019t think they would like it as then it wouldn\u2019t have any flavour. (They will only eat strawberry, raspberry, boysenberry, mixed berry and passion fruit flavoured yogurt and no Greek yogurt ever as it has a funny taste apparently). The yogurt maker is essentially a thermos which you pour hot water in to and then in a seperate container you mix the yogurt powder with water and submerge that container in the hot water and close the thermos for 8-12 hours and the yogurt sets. Basically has anyone tried putting the yogurt powder and water in the slow cooker on low overnight and did it work? Or does anyone know how to make flavoured yogurt in the slow cooker another way?

It was still tough. It didn\u2019t \u2018shred\u2019 into \u2018strings\u2019. Even the carrots were undercooked.

Prep the Crock-Pot \u2013 No need to pre-cook anything! Place both rolls of ground turkey in the Crock-Pot (it\u2019ll break down as it cooks).\n\n\n2. Add all ingredients \u2013 Pour in the diced tomatoes (with their juice), tomato sauce, Bush\u2019s Country Style Baked Beans, onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Stir everything together.\n\n\n3. Season \u2013 Sprinkle in the chili seasoning packet or use the homemade spices if you prefer. Add the cayenne pepper if you want some extra heat. Stir to combine.\n\n\n4. Add liquid (optional) \u2013 If you prefer a thinner chili, add about 1 cup of water or chicken broth and stir.\n\n\n5. Cook \u2013 Cover the Crock-Pot and cook on high for 4 hours. Stir occasionally and check the texture and flavors.\n\n\n6. Final touch \u2013 About halfway through cooking, stir and break up the turkey into smaller pieces with a spoon. You\u2019ll get a nice chili texture this way!\n\n\n7. Taste and adjust \u2013 Before serving, give it a taste. If it needs more seasoning, feel free to add more chili powder or salt to your liking. If the chili is too thick, add a little more broth or water.\n\n\n8. Serve and enjoy \u2013 Serve your chili with cornbread, crackers, shredded cheese, or a dollop of sour cream for an extra touch!\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nGround turkey is leaner than beef, making it a great healthier option for chili. If you like a richer flavor, you could also mix in a little beef.\n\nThis recipe is super versatile! Feel free to add more veggies like carrots or zucchini if you want to bulk it up or tweak it to your taste.\n\nLeftovers store well in the fridge and can even taste better the next day!\n\n\nEnjoy your homemade Wendy\u2019s-style chili without the hassle! \ud83c\udf72\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/labyz0rz1qje1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1739807867.0, "score": 155, "author": "RefrigeratorSure7096", "num_comments": 43, "permalink": "/r/slowcooking/comments/1irn2z3/wendys_crockpot_chili_rip_off/", "html_title": ""}

I just made this recipe that is a cuban dish that is basically just ground beef, capers, olives, bell pepper, tomato, garlic, and cilantro.

Overnight the keep warm setting on my possible cooker kept it at about at 155F.\n\nIn my head this was going to enhance the flavor by letting the flavors mix together.

It's still fine but it doesn't seem particularly more flavorful but unless I am remembering wrong the ground beef feels just a smidge more like gravel than it did last night. Still perfectly fine but like I am unsure.\n\nThis brings up a few questions for me:\n\n1. Was the idea to leave it hot for longer than 4 hours it cook a good idea at all?

If you have sour oranges (naranja agria) in your area, use that.\n\n**Rub**\n\n* 5 tbsp Mexican oregano (or regular)\n* 2.5 tbsp ground cumin\n* 6 tbsp olive oil (or enough to make a paste)\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Dry the pork butt with paper towels. Trim the fat cap to your desired amount and rub with salt and pepper. I tend to leave some but try to get rid of as much of the hard fat as possible.\n2. Combine the rub ingredients into a paste and coat the pork butt. I use a silicon pastry brush, and it works well.\n3. Wrap pork butt tightly in plastic wrap and park it in the fridge for 12 hours.\n4. Place the pork in a slow cooker with the fat cap up. Top with the onions, jalape\u00f1o, minced garlic, and pour your orange and lime juice in.\n5. (OPTIONAL) I put a cast iron press on top of the pork butt in the slow cooker to prevent it from floating & cooking unevenly.\n6. Slow cook on low for 12 hours or on high for 8 hours.\n7. Pull out the pork butt and shred. If you're trying to avoid as much fat as possible, shred and move to a wire rack to let the fat drain.\n8. If serving immediately, lay out your shredded pork on a sheet pan and broil it on high for 10-15 minutes or until desired crispiness. Alternatively, you can pan fry it in the leftover liquid from inside the slow cooker.\n9. Remove from oven and liberally apply juices from slow cooker.\n\n**Leftovers/Meal Prep**\n\n* If you're going to cook and then save the majority of the carnitas for the week (which is what I do), follow the directions to step 7.\n* Grab a couple of gallon zip lock bags, load them up with the shredded pork after cooking, and throw it in the fridge if you're eating it within 7 days.

I'll put the recipe below in case anyone fancies giving it a go. It serves 5-6.\n\n*Ingredients*\n8 sausages (any kind)\n2x 500g passata\n400g butterbeans\n200g fine green beans\n4 medium to large carrots\n2 celery sticks\n3 handfuls spinach\n2 garlic cloves\n1 onion\n15-20 plum or cherry tomatoes\n1 vegetable stock cube\n200ml water\n2 tbsp tomato puree\n4 tsp paprika\nPepper, to taste\n\n*Method*\n1. Cut up the sausages and place in the oven to brown.\n2. Roughly chop the carrots, celery and onion and blitz it up with the spinach and garlic to the desired consistency.\n3. Add the passata, tomato puree, stock cube, water and blitzed vegetables to the slow cooker and stir gently until blended.\n4. Add the paprika and pepper to taste.\n5. Add the sausages.\n6. Half the green beans and remove the ends.\n7. Drain and rinse the butterbeans.\n8. Add the beans to the pot and stir to combine.\n9. Cook on high for 4 hours.\n10. Half the tomatoes, add to the pot and stir.\n11. Serve with crusty bread and/or a salad.\n\n*Notes*\n- Blending the vegetables is not absolutely necessary, I just have a thing about not liking big chunks of onion (don't ask!), plus it makes for a thicker consistency\n- Next time I plan to try frying off the vegetables and sausage to see if it makes any difference to the flavour\n- Chilli or curry powders could easily be added to this instead of or in addition to the paprika\n- Tomatoes could be added at any point, I just prefer them 'fresh' rather than cooked\n\nPlease let me know if you give it a go and what you think! \ud83d\ude0a", "url": "https://i.redd.it/18cnxbivbdhe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1738782094.0, "score": 24, "author": "Just_A_Broadway_Baby", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/slowcooking/comments/1iihsid/sausage_and_bean_casserole/", "html_title": ""}

Since I tend to prep for the whole week, I often eat things like casseroles, pasta dishes, a baked potato, breakfast for supper, things that are moist and don't taste terrible when reheated. If I wanted something crisp or that would get soggy, I'd make that fresh, of course.\n\nWould these things hold up to being in a slow cooker all day? I know pasta is probably out because it would get mushy, and eggs would get rubbery, but what about a casserole, meatloaf, meatballs, hot sandwich fillings, potato- or rice-based side dishes cooked vegetables, cereal products?

I also let it cook for exactly 8 hours and then set to warm for the entire day while I was eating it. And this tasted perfect my meat was tender and juicy.\n\nIs the problem that I used a different type of meat? Or because I used way more meat (2lbs)? Even though I used more meat I had more meat I had more beef stock compared to the first time. Or is it because I left my crockpot on low for longer than 8 hours?

{"title": "Need advice for timing a pork roast?", "selftext": "I am in need of some advice for the timing that would be ideal for cooking a pork shoulder/butt for the goal of making pulled pork. This Saturday we have a family Christmas get together on my boyfriend's side and it's potluck style for snacks and apps.

{"title": "Why do so few slow cookers have a stainless steel or other stove safe type of pot? Does not seem there a many options with pot inserts fitting for those conscientious about long term durability and avoidance of potentially harmful chemical coatings. What am I missing?", "selftext": "I am big on stainless steel. Love cleaning it, love searing on it. Love the fond. Love it. Love it on my Insta Pot for this reason.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping for slow cookers there are very few that have a pot that is stainless steel. And I am wondering if there is a reason. A big reason I switched away from nonstick was that nonstick develops less of a fond or high quality sear and tends to come with concerns about what chemicals involved in the nonstick might eventually get in my food. Not to mention that non stick is normally not nearly as durable in the long (LONG) term.\n\nThe other thing is the stove safety. Given nearly all slow cookers can't reach the power to properly sear I would prefer to bring them over my stove. But in most cases the pot cannot be placed on the stove because its some other material.\n\nPerhaps I am wrong here though. For example I am looking at the Hamilton Beach Set and Forget. I cannot figure out what black material its crock/pot is using but reviews say it is not stove safe. But what I can't tell is is that material using a coating to make it nonstick that can break down and wear over time? Unsure.\n\nJust not used to the market of slow cookers. So entirely possible this is a very fundamental misunderstanding I am forgetting. My guess is that slow cooker pots need to fundamentally be thicker and heavier than stainless steel pots are.

{"title": "Custom gluten free/lactose free tips/recipe book gift", "selftext": "I\u2019m working on a special project for my best friend\u2019s birthday, and I could use your help! She\u2019s gluten- and lactose-intolerant, and the idea is to make a personalized cookbook that\u2019s practical, full of recipes, snacks, and tips she can actually enjoy without worrying about her intolerances.\n\nShe loves food but doesn\u2019t always have the time or energy to cook, so I want this book to be a mix of easy, affordable ideas and some fun, indulgent meals. Since she doesn\u2019t stick to a gluten- or lactose-free diet perfectly, I\u2019m including cheat sections, too, with clear notes on what might cause issues.\n\nHandwritten in a nice, organized notebook, she's lived with it for a long while, but I figured it would be a nice gift and a nice way to mix up her normal routine. I am not to educated in this sorta thing so any info if it a tip, an idea, or a full recipe, please feel free to reply or pm me.\n\n# The Plan\n\n# 1. Cover Page & Introduction\n\nThis will include:\n\n* A letter to her explaining the gift.\n* A table of contents listing all the sections.\n\n# 2. Cheat Sheet Section\n\nHelpful facts and tips to make life easier:\n\n* Gluten- and lactose-free alternatives for common ingredients.\n* Foods people think are gluten- or lactose-free but aren\u2019t\u2014and surprising ones that are\n* A list of shelf-stable and easy-to-find store-bought options in Canada she ca stock up and have on hand\n\n# 3. Snacks & Quick Meals\n\nA section of gluten- and lactose-free snack ideas and quick meals she can whip up when time is short. I\u2019ll also include late-night lazy options, cozy/comfort, movie night, hangover cures, and good lunches. The focus here is on time.\n\n# 4. Gluten- & Lactose-Free Dinners\n\nNice filling dinner recipes that range from quick and easy to more elaborate meals for when she\u2019s feeling motivated. That she can rely on for herself and when cooking for others, I've heard gluten free stuff doesn\u2019t taste near as good but I'm sure some people have some go to favorites.\n\n# 5. Gluten Cheat Section\n\nSometimes you eat the gluten and deal with it later. These recipes will be lactose-free but not gluten-free, organized by estimated prep time and \u201cseverity\u201d (how much gluten is in it, on a rough 1\u20135 scale). Snacks, lunches, dinner.\n\n# 6. Lactose Cheat Section\n\nFor when skipping lactose isn\u2019t a priority. These recipes will be gluten-free but not lactose-free, also organized by prep time and severity. Snacks, lunch, dinner.\n\n# 7. Desserts/Baking\n\nA mix of gluten- and lactose-free desserts, plus cheat options for when she wants something indulgent. Baking isn\u2019t a huge focus for her, so this section will be smaller but still have a few fun ideas. Also, might throw some cocktails or something here, maybe recommended for some meals.\n\n# The Recipe Format\n\nEach recipe will include:\n\n* Title\n* Quick Info:\n   * Gluten-free/lactose-free status.\n   * Estimated prep time and total time.\n   * For cheat recipes, a 1\u20135 severity scale for gluten or lactose content.\n* Ingredients List: Ingredients will be listed clearly, with the ingredient followed by its amount for easy reading. Example:\n   * Baking soda: 1 tbsp\n   * Gluten-free flour: 2 cups\n   * Sugar: 3 tbsp\n* Instructions: Simple step-by-step directions.\n* Photo Placeholder: I\u2019ll leave a spot to print and paste a picture of the dish.\n\n# What I need help with\n\nI\u2019m planning to do plenty of research myself and compile everything over the winter break and start to write it would in the following months, but I\u2019d love suggestions from anyone who\u2019s gluten- or lactose-intolerant or knows great recipes.\n\nDo you have:\n\n* Easy, filling recipes or meal ideas (snacks, dinners, desserts, etc.)?\n* Tips for shopping or meal prep?\n* Favorite gluten- or lactose-free brands or products available in Canada?\n* Anything helpful or info on your mind\n* Ideas of info I should subtly get out of her to make the book better\n\nPlease reply or reach out and I'd love to hear it, nothing is too small. I'm probably going to use a nice notebook that\u2019s a size B6 or an A4 with 80 pages so I got a lot of space to fill out, I will leave a few pages in each section for her to fill out if she has some go to meals she wants to include in it too. I'll probably check back here in a while with an update\n\n# TL;DR\n\nI\u2019m making a personalized gluten- and lactose-free cookbook for my friend\u2019s birthday.

Pretty much every cut I have is packaged as 1-1.5kg, its just how the butcher we use does stuff. So my first question is anyone familiar with working with smaller cuts for slow cooking. I can't seem to get any good time/weight/temp ratios to use as a metric since my previous results deviating from the current method were boot leather.\n\nThe other thing is I've been looking at getting an actual slow or pressure cooker to try and make the process idiot proof.

{"title": "Advice for a Mississippi pot roast?", "selftext": "I have a work pot luck tomorrow at lunch. For some reason the first thing that came to mind was a Mississippi pot roast. I'm second guessing this decision now but we had to mark what we are bringing and it's too late now to change things.\n\nIt's been a couple years since I made it but I remember it being very salty and am thinking I should tone it down a bit. I'm thinking to maybe sear the meat first, add chopped onions, a cup of beef broth with red wine, and probably a 1/4 cup of flour. I'm also thinking to put in half the au jus pack and 3/4 the ranch pack. Cooking on low for 12 hours. My roast is 2.5lbs.\n\nAnybody tried these ideas? Any mississippi pot roast veterans on here? Thoughts?\n\nThat or should I just make the NY Times variant?\n\n\nEdit: First off, it got rave reviews! Somebody brought in buns and I brought in some pickled red onions so most people end up making sandwiches. \n\nI made a few slight tweaks but not everything I originally listed. Here's what I ended up doing: \n-I patted the meat dry then rolled it in flour and pepper. I then seared it in a pan until some nice colour formed on all sides.\n-I used some no salt added beef stock to deglaze the pan and added that to the slow cooker. \n-I added four sliced onions to the bottom of the slow cooker and covered with one cup of the no salt added beef stock.\n-Instead of the au jus I used a package of Club House caramelized onion and bacon gravy mix. Mainly used this because it had 40% less sodium. I started with 3/4 of the package but when tasting the sauce when shredding I decided it needed the rest of the package.\n-Used 2/3 of the ranch packet and 6 TBSP of unsalted butter (3/4 of what was called for).\n-I added 12 pepperoncinis which I cut into slices and removed the stems and seeds. Also added about 1/4 cup of the liquid.\n-Added a 2TBSP/2TBSP corn starch water slurry about 3 hours before it was served.\n-Cooked on low for 12 hours instead of 8.\n\nThe end result was a pulled beef which was incredibly tender and not overly salty at all. The acidity of the pepperoncini was a stronger flavour than the salt of the gravy. I think the onions and beef stock absorb most of the salt to avoid that oversaltiness. \n\nFor my personal tastes, I actually would've liked a little more salt and a little less acidity, so I'd probably have used the au jus mix if making for myself. For an intro to the dish for a group though this was really good. The spice level was also great for this setting. Lots of people commented there was a bit of heat which creeps up on you but nobody said it was too hot for them.\n\nThat's my experience. Hope this helps someone in the future!

Put a little bit of rosemary in the liquid and then a sprig on top of the pork. \n\nAdd cherries to liquid and lay some on top of the roast. \n\nLiquid should come up to about 1/4 inches high on the side of the pork so most of the meat is outside of the broth. \n\nCook on low 6-8 hours or high 3-4\n\nWhen fork tender set pork out to rest on cutting board and put all the broth into a bowl to make a roux on the stove top. You can either make a cornstarch slurry or do a traditional flour butter roux to add the liquid to. \n\n(Discard the rosemary sprig unless you want to chop up some of it for the gravy which imo would be too overwhelming) \n\nMy friend serves this over egg noodles or spaetzle but I'm doing mashed potatoes. I believe it's a German recipe he got from his German butcher. \n\nI'll let y'all know how it goes!

I detest celery so I made the base with just onion and carrots. Wasn't my favourite and even less my fianc\u00e9's. Maybe I could have chosen to spice it differently, now it tasted mostly of bay leaf. \n\nGot me wondering, how much of what we cook come from our culture and home environment, and how someone's stable can be something super exciting and new for someone else. For example my family used to have pigs and thus we ate a lot of pork, and as they are still farmers, we almost always had domestic grains as carbs.

{"title": "New Slow cooker undercooks- Altitude effect on temps?", "selftext": "Old slow cooker died.  Even on low it would boil.  Made good pulled pork and great Pot Roast.  Got a new fancy one from Williams&Sonoma as a gift.  7Qt with a fairly shallow liner. Has the Low and High setting.  Did a roast for 8 hours on low, and it was only 180F and was tough.  Thought it might be the cut of meat- it had been frozen (but was thawed).\nTried again. The low temp of the first attempt spooked me so I did 2hrs high and 6 hours low.  Meat was about 185 this time. It was still tough. It didn\u2019t \u2018shred\u2019 into \u2018strings\u2019. Even the carrots were undercooked.  Old one would almost make them \u2018mashed\u2019.\nToday I tried to run just water.  Lid has two eyelet holes to put a thermometer into the liquid.  Low setting after 4 hours was 173F.  Boosted it to high and it went to 199 and was almost boiling- air bubbles forming, but no real \u2018boiling\u2019 action.  At Albuquerque altitude, so I think that might be as hot as it can get, though I would expect it to \u2018boil\u2019 maybe a bit more?\nLittle annoyed that this has ruined two nights of dinner, and cost some cash money. I thought the low temp of 173 was low since the old one would boil on low- but it seems that might be the \u2018correct\u2019 low temp?  Also, the old one was deeper, so the meat was submerged mostly.  The new one is shallow, so the meat is less submerged. This last time, the one piece of meat that was submerged was cooked a bit better. But the carrots still weren\u2019t right.\nDo I just need to run it on high?  What use is the low setting?  I wonder if 4 hours on high is long enough?  Is altitude screwing with the cooker?  Outside of making horrible food, I like it. The browning function is pretty handy. So the liner is at least getting somewhat hot before the slow cook?\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1ixhugb/new_slow_cooker_undercooks_altitude_effect_on/", "created_utc": 1740443558.0, "score": 8, "author": "WaitAMinuteThereNow", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/slowcooking/comments/1ixhugb/new_slow_cooker_undercooks_altitude_effect_on/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I just made this recipe that is a cuban dish that is basically just ground beef, capers, olives, bell pepper, tomato, garlic, and cilantro. Real simple.\n\nI browned everything on the stove and cooked the onions a bit through everything in. Put it on low in my Ninja Possible Cooker.\n\nI monitored it with a food thermometer. Let it reach 163F (it did so in about 4 hours) then let it cook for 15 minutes and then kept it on keep warm overnight (10 hours). Overnight the keep warm setting on my possible cooker kept it at about at 155F.\n\nIn my head this was going to enhance the flavor by letting the flavors mix together. I tried the recipe last night and again for lunch. It's still fine but it doesn't seem particularly more flavorful but unless I am remembering wrong the ground beef feels just a smidge more like gravel than it did last night. Still perfectly fine but like I am unsure.\n\nThis brings up a few questions for me:\n\n1. Was the idea to leave it hot for longer than 4 hours it cook a good idea at all? Could it have improved the flavor? How do I know when a recipe might benefit from that?\n2. Was pan browning the ground beef (I did not fully cook it) a bad idea?\n3.

{"title": "YACR (Yet Another Carnitas Recipe)", "selftext": "Not much back story. I modified recipes and techniques I've seen over the years to get it where I like it. I get pretty large pork butts through a restaurant supplier, but you can cut this recipe in half for smaller cuts.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 10lb pork butt\n* 4 tbsp kosher salt\n* 2 tbsp ground black pepper\n* 2 yellow onions, chopped\n* 2 jalapenos, deseeded and chopped\n* 1 head of garlic, minced\n* 1.5 cup orange juice, 0.5 cup lime juice. If you have sour oranges (naranja agria) in your area, use that.\n\n**Rub**\n\n* 5 tbsp Mexican oregano (or regular)\n* 2.5 tbsp ground cumin\n* 6 tbsp olive oil (or enough to make a paste)\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Dry the pork butt with paper towels. Trim the fat cap to your desired amount and rub with salt and pepper. I tend to leave some but try to get rid of as much of the hard fat as possible.\n2. Combine the rub ingredients into a paste and coat the pork butt. I use a silicon pastry brush, and it works well.\n3. Wrap pork butt tightly in plastic wrap and park it in the fridge for 12 hours.\n4. Place the pork in a slow cooker with the fat cap up. Top with the onions, jalape\u00f1o, minced garlic, and pour your orange and lime juice in.\n5. (OPTIONAL) I put a cast iron press on top of the pork butt in the slow cooker to prevent it from floating & cooking unevenly.\n6. Slow cook on low for 12 hours or on high for 8 hours.\n7. Pull out the pork butt and shred. If you're trying to avoid as much fat as possible, shred and move to a wire rack to let the fat drain.\n8. If serving immediately, lay out your shredded pork on a sheet pan and broil it on high for 10-15 minutes or until desired crispiness. Alternatively, you can pan fry it in the leftover liquid from inside the slow cooker.\n9. Remove from oven and liberally apply juices from slow cooker.\n\n**Leftovers/Meal Prep**\n\n* If you're going to cook and then save the majority of the carnitas for the week (which is what I do), follow the directions to step 7.\n* Grab a couple of gallon zip lock bags, load them up with the shredded pork after cooking, and throw it in the fridge if you're eating it within 7 days. Freezer up to 6 months. Same with the liquid. Find a suitable vessel (I use large mason jars) and fridge it.\n\nAny questions, feel free to ask!

{"title": "Would leftovers be any good after sitting in a slow cooker all day?", "selftext": "I got a Crock Pot lunchbox recently, and my hot lunches taste SO much better than microwaved. I'm single and usually cook suppers on Monday night for a week, but I'm getting sick of microwaved leftovers. I'm thinking about getting a second lunchbox, or more likely an actual, small slow cooker, so I can come home to a hot meal that actually tastes good.\n\nThe thing is, I don't really like traditional slow cooler meals like soups, stews, or chili. Tonight, for example, I'm making meatloaf, real mashed potatoes, and a simple vegetable. Since I tend to prep for the whole week, I often eat things like casseroles, pasta dishes, a baked potato, breakfast for supper, things that are moist and don't taste terrible when reheated. If I wanted something crisp or that would get soggy, I'd make that fresh, of course.\n\nWould these things hold up to being in a slow cooker all day? I know pasta is probably out because it would get mushy, and eggs would get rubbery, but what about a casserole, meatloaf, meatballs, hot sandwich fillings, potato- or rice-based side dishes cooked vegetables, cereal products? Also, has anyone tried using a heated lunchbox overnight or all day? The instructions recommend only using it for 2-4 hours, and I haven't used it for more than 4 hours so far.

A ninja possible cooker pro (ok so more of an electric dutch oven).\n\nI am confused. 4 hours in despite using boiling water and setting the pot to sear it seems to hover right around 150F.

This (see photo below) is the style of thermometer I am using and you can tell that the conductive part of the probe is not getting all the way into my soup with it stuck through the steam hole. It's only about half way in.\n\nI am lucky. I am cooking beef which only needs to reach a minimum of 150F. But if this were poultry? Ground beef (chili) the min setting would be too low and the high setting might be way too high.\n\n**I heard slow cookers stopped having low settings precisely due to this kind of user error.** But was the issue that people were cooking poultry on low and just didn't leave it in long enough, or was it that they used it on low period? Or could it be that the \"standards\" for meat cooking temps do not apply to slow cooking somehow?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgrj4hwopwce1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce493803b1737344252d34af39e09bb2c3a85a54", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1i10bd0/how_can_you_cook_meat_on_low_in_a_slow_cooker_if/", "created_utc": 1736837695.0, "score": 38, "author": "kierumcak", "num_comments": 36, "permalink": "/r/slowcooking/comments/1i10bd0/how_can_you_cook_meat_on_low_in_a_slow_cooker_if/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Why do so few slow cookers have a stainless steel or other stove safe type of pot? Does not seem there a many options with pot inserts fitting for those conscientious about long term durability and avoidance of potentially harmful chemical coatings. What am I missing?", "selftext": "I am big on stainless steel. Love cleaning it, love searing on it. Love the fond. Love it. Love it on my Insta Pot for this reason.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping for slow cookers there are very few that have a pot that is stainless steel. And I am wondering if there is a reason. A big reason I switched away from nonstick was that nonstick develops less of a fond or high quality sear and tends to come with concerns about what chemicals involved in the nonstick might eventually get in my food. Not to mention that non stick is normally not nearly as durable in the long (LONG) term.\n\nThe other thing is the stove safety. Given nearly all slow cookers can't reach the power to properly sear I would prefer to bring them over my stove. But in most cases the pot cannot be placed on the stove because its some other material.\n\nPerhaps I am wrong here though. For example I am looking at the Hamilton Beach Set and Forget. I cannot figure out what black material its crock/pot is using but reviews say it is not stove safe. But what I can't tell is is that material using a coating to make it nonstick that can break down and wear over time? Unsure.\n\nJust not used to the market of slow cookers. So entirely possible this is a very fundamental misunderstanding I am forgetting. My guess is that slow cooker pots need to fundamentally be thicker and heavier than stainless steel pots are.

{"title": "Custom gluten free/lactose free tips/recipe book gift", "selftext": "I\u2019m working on a special project for my best friend\u2019s birthday, and I could use your help! She\u2019s gluten- and lactose-intolerant, and the idea is to make a personalized cookbook that\u2019s practical, full of recipes, snacks, and tips she can actually enjoy without worrying about her intolerances.\n\nShe loves food but doesn\u2019t always have the time or energy to cook, so I want this book to be a mix of easy, affordable ideas and some fun, indulgent meals. Since she doesn\u2019t stick to a gluten- or lactose-free diet perfectly, I\u2019m including cheat sections, too, with clear notes on what might cause issues.\n\nHandwritten in a nice, organized notebook, she's lived with it for a long while, but I figured it would be a nice gift and a nice way to mix up her normal routine. I am not to educated in this sorta thing so any info if it a tip, an idea, or a full recipe, please feel free to reply or pm me.\n\n# The Plan\n\n# 1. Cover Page & Introduction\n\nThis will include:\n\n* A letter to her explaining the gift.\n* A table of contents listing all the sections.\n\n# 2. Cheat Sheet Section\n\nHelpful facts and tips to make life easier:\n\n* Gluten- and lactose-free alternatives for common ingredients.\n* Foods people think are gluten- or lactose-free but aren\u2019t\u2014and surprising ones that are\n* A list of shelf-stable and easy-to-find store-bought options in Canada she ca stock up and have on hand\n\n# 3. Snacks & Quick Meals\n\nA section of gluten- and lactose-free snack ideas and quick meals she can whip up when time is short. I\u2019ll also include late-night lazy options, cozy/comfort, movie night, hangover cures, and good lunches. The focus here is on time.\n\n# 4. Gluten- & Lactose-Free Dinners\n\nNice filling dinner recipes that range from quick and easy to more elaborate meals for when she\u2019s feeling motivated. That she can rely on for herself and when cooking for others, I've heard gluten free stuff doesn\u2019t taste near as good but I'm sure some people have some go to favorites.\n\n# 5. Gluten Cheat Section\n\nSometimes you eat the gluten and deal with it later. These recipes will be lactose-free but not gluten-free, organized by estimated prep time and \u201cseverity\u201d (how much gluten is in it, on a rough 1\u20135 scale). Snacks, lunches, dinner.\n\n# 6. Lactose Cheat Section\n\nFor when skipping lactose isn\u2019t a priority. These recipes will be gluten-free but not lactose-free, also organized by prep time and severity. Snacks, lunch, dinner.\n\n# 7. Desserts/Baking\n\nA mix of gluten- and lactose-free desserts, plus cheat options for when she wants something indulgent. Baking isn\u2019t a huge focus for her, so this section will be smaller but still have a few fun ideas. Also, might throw some cocktails or something here, maybe recommended for some meals.\n\n# The Recipe Format\n\nEach recipe will include:\n\n* Title\n* Quick Info:\n   * Gluten-free/lactose-free status.\n   * Estimated prep time and total time.\n   * For cheat recipes, a 1\u20135 severity scale for gluten or lactose content.\n* Ingredients List: Ingredients will be listed clearly, with the ingredient followed by its amount for easy reading. Example:\n   * Baking soda: 1 tbsp\n   * Gluten-free flour: 2 cups\n   * Sugar: 3 tbsp\n* Instructions: Simple step-by-step directions.\n* Photo Placeholder: I\u2019ll leave a spot to print and paste a picture of the dish.\n\n# What I need help with\n\nI\u2019m planning to do plenty of research myself and compile everything over the winter break and start to write it would in the following months, but I\u2019d love suggestions from anyone who\u2019s gluten- or lactose-intolerant or knows great recipes.\n\nDo you have:\n\n* Easy, filling recipes or meal ideas (snacks, dinners, desserts, etc.)?\n* Tips for shopping or meal prep?\n* Favorite gluten- or lactose-free brands or products available in Canada?\n* Anything helpful or info on your mind\n* Ideas of info I should subtly get out of her to make the book better\n\nPlease reply or reach out and I'd love to hear it, nothing is too small. I'm probably going to use a nice notebook that\u2019s a size B6 or an A4 with 80 pages so I got a lot of space to fill out, I will leave a few pages in each section for her to fill out if she has some go to meals she wants to include in it too.

Pretty much every cut I have is packaged as 1-1.5kg, its just how the butcher we use does stuff. So my first question is anyone familiar with working with smaller cuts for slow cooking.
