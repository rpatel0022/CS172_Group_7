If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me a DM!\n\nIngredients:\n- 1 acorn squash\n- 2 tbsp butter\n- Maple syrup\n- roughly 1/2 lb Pancetta\n- 1 shallot\n- 1 garlic clove\n- 1/2 lb pasta\n- A few tbsp of mascarpone\n- Parmigiano Reggiano\n\nMethod:\nCut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds and guts, season with S&P, put a tbsp of butter in each half, and lightly drizzle with maple syrup. Bake @ 325 convection for about an hour or until soft all the way through. \nCube the pancetta and fry over medium heat until the fat is rendered. Deglaze with a little water if the pan gets too dark. This will also help the rendering. \nRemove the pancetta and cook the sliced shallot in the fat until soft and caramelized. \nRemove the squash flesh and blend it together with the shallot. Season with salt if needed. \nWhile the pasta cooks, add a clove of garlic to the remaining pancetta fat over medium heat until slightly browned and fragrant just to give a hint of flavor. Remove the clove and add the pasta to the pan with some pasta water. Add the squash pur\u00e9e and mix, adding pasta water if needed.

{"title": "Sausage and fennel ragu", "selftext": "This was a really tasty but fairly quick to make sauce. The combination of sausage and fennel was really good, with sweetness to balance out a bit of the spiciness. \n\nIn a heavy skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat brown 1-1.5 lbs of ground sweet Italian sausage (@5 min). \n\nFinely chop one small onion and one fennel bulb (I pulsed in my food processor about 45 seconds) and add to pan when sausage is nearly cooked through and saut\u00e9 (another 3-4 mins). Reduce heat in pan to medium. \n\nPour 1 cup of chicken broth into a bowl and sprinkle with one packet of unflavored gelatin to bloom.\n\nMince 4 cloves of garlic and add to pan along with 1 tsp of anchovy paste (optional, but recommended), 2 tbs of double concentrated vegetable paste (sub tomato paste, but more if not double concentrated), 1 tbs of fennel seed, a pinch of red pepper flake, and 1 tbs of dried oregano. Cook aromatics for another minute. \n\nDeglaze pan with @3/4 cup of dry red wine, scraping up all of the fond. Stir up the chicken broth/gelatin mixture in the bowl well before adding. Add 1 large can (28 oz) of pur\u00e9ed tomatoes (I used whole peeled San Marzanos pur\u00e9ed in my food processor on low @45 seconds). Bring to boil and simmer on medium-low heat at least 45 minutes. I added @1 tsp of soy sauce (optional, but recommended), @2tsp of kosher salt, and @1tsp fresh ground black pepper to taste. \n\nBoil 1lb pasta of your choice (I choice rigatoni in this instance) in salted water. Reserve some pasta water and add back some to your preferred consistency (I used @ 1/2 cup). Mix in your pasta and let rest a few minutes. For me, a little fresh grated pecorino romano cheese on top in this pic. \n\nAll in, this took just over an hour, but if you\u2019re not a multi-tasker and prep first, plan on an hour and a half.

However, I will advise that I flattened the sfoglie as normal until setting 4 on my imperia roller and then moved over to the chitarra box and rolled them out. I needed 3 times, the first two rested for 15 mins and the final one overnight in the fridge. This helped the dough to become delightful and airy.\n\nSauce:\n- a lot of cherry tomatoes\n- a lot of EVO oil\n- 350g of guanciale\n- handful of 'nduja (see photo for reference)\n- half an onion.\n- salted pasta water (obviously)\n- grated pecorino\n- basil leaves\n\nHalf the cherry tomatoes and season generously with salt, EV olive oil and some lemon rind. Lay out onto a baking tray lined with parchmebt paper and roast/confit at 180 degrees until very soft and intensified. It took me about an hour, I don't know how powerful your oven is so be instinctive. This can be done even a couple days before. Put into a container and refrigerate with some basil leaves.\nBring a big pot of lots of water on to boil. When it does, add salt. Take the cooked cherry tomatoes and use a stick blenser to puree along with some pasta water until the desired consistency is obtained, and set aside this slurry for now.\nCut the guanciale into 1cmx1cm cubes and place into a cold pan. Bring the heat up to medium and fry, turning to avoid burning. Once you see the fat rendering, tip into a separate container, being careful not to let the guanciale dall' out of the pan (I use a slotted chef's spoon to facilitate). Repeat this process, I usually do it three times and buy that stage the guanciale is a delicious golden brown that is rendered crispy on the outside and soft a luscious on the inside (this is a direct rip off of Luciano Monosilio because it works amazingly well).\n\nAdd the reserved fat back to the same pan and fry your onion until soft and translucent and then add the 'nduja in pieces as per the image. Melt this down with some of the cooking water to help emulsify. Add the cherry tomato slurry and begin mixing. Bring to boil then turn off the heat. Add your pasta and cook. If it's fresh pasta, will only take like three minutes otherwise and in any case, obviously cook it until all dente.\nDrain the pasta and toss through the sauce vigorously \"mantecando\" until you have the desired thickness add some pecorino romano and more cooking water if necessary. \nServe into bowls and buon appetito!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsnpkz", "created_utc": 1743920522.0, "score": 384, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jsnpkz/home_made_spaghetti_alla_chitarra_con_pomodorini/", "html_title": ""}

I froze the filling in balls and then wrapped them with dough, and when the filling softened a little, I shaped the ravioli into pumpkins with the back of a knife (and added the leaves).

Been experimenting a lot with risotattura, so I decided to add the pasta to the boiling water for 3-4 minutes until it softens a bit and releases some of its starches, adding pasta cooking water to the pan I cooked the guanciale (where I left the other half of its fat) and finished the pasta cooking there until al dente. That helped the pasta coat itself with its own starches plus the fat of the guanciale. Then took it off of the heat, leaving a little bit of the residual water in the pan, and then adding the guanciale and the carbocrema, constantly tossing and stirring, then plating it with some pecorino and black pepper on top:)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bkkil7", "created_utc": 1711062684.0, "score": 361, "author": "Fantastic_Board8651", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1bkkil7/carbonara/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Egg and spinach striped triangoli with ricotta filling", "selftext": "I recently came across Mateo Zeilonka\u2019s \u2018The Pasta Man\u2019 cookbook and wanted to try his fun little colorful pastas ever since. Last weekend I got to it and gave the egg and spinach dough triangoli a go; there was definitely a learning curve involved from getting the spinach dough right to interlacing colors, but the end result was great!\n \n\nEgg dough:\n\n200g 00 flour, 2 eggs, and 1 yolk. Combine and knead well, cover, and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\n\nSpinach dough:\n\n250g 00 flour, 1 egg, 1 yolk, and 150g fresh spinach. Blanch spinach for 30 seconds, rinse under cold water immediately, then squeeze out as much moisture as possible. Throw all of it in a blender along with the eggs and blend well. Finer the better. Add to flour, knead well, and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nNote: Although Mateo says use 250g, that turned out to be too dry and the dough was hard to work. Next time I\u2019m going to use 200g.\n\n\nMethod:\n\nSeparate doughs into 6 equal pieces (3 from each color) by weight. It\u2019s important as we want to match same quantities of yellow and green dough. Get 2 pieces from one color each and roll into equal sized rectangles (make sure to keep the others covered so as not to let them dry out). Rectangles must not be rolled too thin, otherwise they will not stick to each other well when interlacing. Cut them into stripes and interlace, then roll slightly with the wooden pin to let them come together. Then ideally using a pasta machine roll them into a thinness about setting 7. Cut into about 3.5-inch squares, and put a dollop of filling into the center, and fold the squares along the diagonal. Use the roller cutter and cut out edges so they end up with a nice wavy edge. Repeat with rest of the dough.\n \n\nFilling:\n\nMix ricotta with thinly sliced dill (or green onion, green part only) and ham if preferable. Salt to taste.\n \n\nSauce:\n\nChop morel mushrooms into small pieces. If using dried morels, rehydrate in a bowl of room temp water for about 30 minutes, then pat dry. Fry them lightly in a little bit of olive oil in medium heat, turn heat down to medium low and add a lot of butter and fresh rosemary and coat well. Add cooked raviolis, mix well, and finish with a little bit of reserved pasta water. Plate the raviolis, garnish with some parmigiano reggiano, freshly cracked black pepper, and slightly crumbled toasted pine nuts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/y7fbcx", "created_utc": 1666118890.0, "score": 274, "author": "whatissevenbysix", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/y7fbcx/egg_and_spinach_striped_triangoli_with_ricotta/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Another Cacio e pepe", "selftext": "Traditional method - three ingredients (4 if you include pasta water)\n\nMy recipe:\n\nFor 500g of bronze cut pasta, ideally spaghetti alla chitarra or tonnarelli \n- 275g-300g of Pecorino Romano cheese (whole)\n- A handful of peppercorns\n- Pasta water QB\n\nStart by freshly grating room temperature pecorino romano cheese. The key here is that it needs to be grated with a microplace because of the way it renders the cheese very fine and fluffy, perfect for creating the creamy sauce. If you can't find a microplace, just a regular grater should do the trick. Set aside into a bowl.\n\nNext, toast your peppercorns on a medium heat whilst constantly swirling the pan (ensuring not to burn). For 2-3 mins until aromatic. Take off heat and put into mortar and pestle and grind straight away.\n\nBoil some water to boil. When boiling, add some salt (not too much because pecorino is already very salty). Take some cooking water and mix with some room temperature water to make it warm (around 50-60 degrees Celsius) and slowly start adding to pecorino to create a paste. Carefully not too add to much at a time and make sure it is all absorbed before adding more. Add some of the ground pepper as well, it should look like a cookies and cream ice cream almost - set aside.\n\nCook pasta to Al dente and then place the pasta into a stainless steel bowl. Bring the pasta water down to low heat and wait about 1 min. Add a ladle of water to pasta, a generous helping of pepper and add also the cheese paste. Begin stirring vigorously with tongs and you will need to also \"mantecare\" the pasta here. Please google this as it is hard to explain this process but essentially, slowly, slowly, everything should start to come together and a delightful cream should begin forming. If too watery, add more cheese, if too wet, add more water. If it cools down too quick, add the bowl back to the pot of pasta water like a double boiler but please be careful with the heat as it can split the sauce. \nServe into a brown and garnish with more pecorino and pepper.\n\nBuon appetito!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/osskckdhqywe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745578970.0, "score": 120, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1k7i5is/another_cacio_e_pepe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cacio e pepe - with homemade pasta!", "selftext": "Since the dawn of time, humankind has always wondered...\nWhat if I were to make cacio e pepe but with a fresh home made Spaghetti alla chitarra?\n\nWould it work? Would it be terrible?\n\nI have embarked on this journey and have lived to tell the tale...\n\nThis was absolutely awesome.\n\nWas it better than using a bronze cut dried tonnarello or spaghetto? It was different.\n\nThe dough was simply water and semola, kneaded twice and rested once for 15 mins, ann then in the fridge overnight. Google the method for that, there are an abundance.\n\nRecipe below:\nFor 500g of bronze cut pasta, ideally spaghetti alla chitarra or tonnarelli:\n- 275g-300g of Pecorino Romano cheese (whole)\n- A handful of peppercorns\n\nStart by freshly grating room temperature pecorino romano cheese. The key here is that it needs to be grated with a microplace because of the way it renders the cheese very fine and fluffy, perfect for creating the creamy sauce. If you can't find a microplace, just a regular grater should do the trick. Set aside into a bowl.\n\nNext, toast your peppercorns on a medium heat whilst constantly swirling the pan (ensuring not to burn). For 2-3 mins until aromatic. Take off heat and put into mortar and pestle and grind straight away.\n\nBoil some water to boil. When boiling, add some salt (not too much because pecorino is already very salty). Take some cooking water and mix with some room temperature water to make it warm (around 50-60 degrees Celsius) and slowly start adding to pecorino to create a paste. Carefully not too add to much at a time and make sure it is all absorbed before adding more. Add some of the ground pepper as well, it should look like a cookies and cream ice cream paste almost - set aside.\n\nCook pasta to Al dente (like 30 seconds literally if fresh pasta) and then place the pasta into a spacious stainless steel bowl. Bring the pasta water down to low heat and wait about 1 min. Add a ladle of water to pasta, a generous helping of pepper and add also the cheese paste. Begin stirring vigorously with tongs and you will need to also \"mantecare\" the pasta here. Please google this as it is hard to explain this process but essentially, slowly, slowly, everything should start to come together and a delightful cream should begin forming. If too watery, add more cheese, if too wet, add more water. If it cools down too quick, add the bowl back to the pot of pasta water like a double boiler but please be careful with the heat as it can split the sauce. \nServe into a bowl and garnish with more pecorino and pepper and Buon appetito!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0gn2w", "created_utc": 1744797439.0, "score": 247, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1k0gn2w/cacio_e_pepe_with_homemade_pasta/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Home made Spaghetti alla chitarra con pomodorini, 'nduja e guanciale", "selftext": "This was very tasty, almost similar to an amatriciana with 'nduja adder but I am aware this is not amatriciana so I am not calling that, it's just for perspective.\nThe spaghetti were made and rolled from a semola flour and water only dough which was a conscious decision as I thought the sauce was a little rich but it was absolutely stunning. \n\nDough:\n- 500g of semola flour (semolina)\n- 248g of tepid water\n- pinch of salt\n\nI am not going to explain how the dough is made as there is an abundance of videos out there. However, I will advise that I flattened the sfoglie as normal until setting 4 on my imperia roller and then moved over to the chitarra box and rolled them out. I needed 3 times, the first two rested for 15 mins and the final one overnight in the fridge. This helped the dough to become delightful and airy.\n\nSauce:\n- a lot of cherry tomatoes\n- a lot of EVO oil\n- 350g of guanciale\n- handful of 'nduja (see photo for reference)\n- half an onion.\n- salted pasta water (obviously)\n- grated pecorino\n- basil leaves\n\nHalf the cherry tomatoes and season generously with salt, EV olive oil and some lemon rind. Lay out onto a baking tray lined with parchmebt paper and roast/confit at 180 degrees until very soft and intensified. It took me about an hour, I don't know how powerful your oven is so be instinctive. This can be done even a couple days before. Put into a container and refrigerate with some basil leaves.\nBring a big pot of lots of water on to boil. When it does, add salt. Take the cooked cherry tomatoes and use a stick blenser to puree along with some pasta water until the desired consistency is obtained, and set aside this slurry for now.\nCut the guanciale into 1cmx1cm cubes and place into a cold pan. Bring the heat up to medium and fry, turning to avoid burning. Once you see the fat rendering, tip into a separate container, being careful not to let the guanciale dall' out of the pan (I use a slotted chef's spoon to facilitate). Repeat this process, I usually do it three times and buy that stage the guanciale is a delicious golden brown that is rendered crispy on the outside and soft a luscious on the inside (this is a direct rip off of Luciano Monosilio because it works amazingly well).\n\nAdd the reserved fat back to the same pan and fry your onion until soft and translucent and then add the 'nduja in pieces as per the image. Melt this down with some of the cooking water to help emulsify. Add the cherry tomato slurry and begin mixing. Bring to boil then turn off the heat. Add your pasta and cook. If it's fresh pasta, will only take like three minutes otherwise and in any case, obviously cook it until all dente.\nDrain the pasta and toss through the sauce vigorously \"mantecando\" until you have the desired thickness add some pecorino romano and more cooking water if necessary. \nServe into bowls and buon appetito!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsnpkz", "created_utc": 1743920522.0, "score": 385, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jsnpkz/home_made_spaghetti_alla_chitarra_con_pomodorini/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Bolognese Lasagna (Help needed)", "selftext": "Hello everyone! How\u2019s it going?  \nOn Sunday, I\u2019ll be hosting some guests at my place (4 adults and 3 children), and I want to make a classic Bolognese lasagna (or as classic as possible \ud83d\ude05).  \nI\u2019ve made this dish a few times before, so I\u2019m familiar with all the work it involves (I\u2019ve even shared the process here on Reddit).  \nI\u2019d like to share with you the recipes I plan to use, but mostly, the schedule I intend to follow (preparation, storage, cooking, etc.).  \nMy main questions are about how preparing some steps ahead of time might influence the flavor, consistency, texture, etc., of the lasagna.\n\n**Saturday afternoon:**\n\n* Make the Rag\u00f9 (estimated time: 3 hours and 30 minutes) In a large pan, brown the meats (guanciale, ground beef (2/3), and ground pork (1/3)), and deglaze with white wine. \n* In another pot, make the soffritto (onion, carrot, and celery), then add the meats, passata, and fresh herbs. Add water, and let it simmer on low for 3 hours (or until the meats are tender). Season with salt and pepper, and at the end, add a bit of milk. Let it cool and refrigerate (until the next day. Take it out 20 minutes before assembling).\n* Make the green pasta (while the rag\u00f9 is cooking): Beat eggs and spinach. Mix the '00' flour with the liquid. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate (until the next morning).\n\n**Sunday morning:**\n\n* Make the B\u00e9chamel: Butter, flour, milk, salt, and nutmeg.\n* Roll out the pasta.\n* Pre-cook the pasta sheets in salted water, then shock them in cold water.\n* Dry the pasta sheets with a cloth, drizzle with a little olive oil to prevent sticking, and stack them.\n\n**Sunday, 2 hours before serving lunch:**\n\n* Assemble the lasagna, layer by layer: \n   * Rag\u00f9 + B\u00e9chamel Pasta Rag\u00f9 + B\u00e9chamel + cheese (repeat until the last layer) Top: B\u00e9chamel and cheese for gratin\u00e9ing. \n* Place in the oven (approximately 30 minutes). \n* Let the lasagna rest for 30 minutes. \n* Serve.\n\nIn your opinion, is it possible to optimize this process? Since I\u2019ll be doing everything alone, I\u2019m always worried about timing \ud83d\ude05.  \nFor example:  \n\\- Could I roll out the pasta on Saturday and store it in the fridge?  \n\\- Is it possible to make the B\u00e9chamel on Saturday as well?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pasta/comments/1jrfc96/bolognese_lasagna_help_needed/", "created_utc": 1743782196.0, "score": 1, "author": "sholderbuffalo", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jrfc96/bolognese_lasagna_help_needed/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I then pass the spaghetti straight from the pot to the pan like 3-4 minutes before al dente and I finish cooking it in the pan with its cooking water and obviously the pepper. Once the pasta is done and most of the water reduced (while leaving a bit on the bottom of the pan) I take it out of the heat, and I start to add the cheese slowly until desired consistency (adding some extra pasta cooking water if need be) and voila!

The key here is that it needs to be grated with a microplace because of the way it renders the cheese very fine and fluffy, perfect for creating the creamy sauce. If you can't find a microplace, just a regular grater should do the trick. Set aside into a bowl.\n\nNext, toast your peppercorns on a medium heat whilst constantly swirling the pan (ensuring not to burn). For 2-3 mins until aromatic. Take off heat and put into mortar and pestle and grind straight away.\n\nBoil some water to boil. When boiling, add some salt (not too much because pecorino is already very salty). Take some cooking water and mix with some room temperature water to make it warm (around 50-60 degrees Celsius) and slowly start adding to pecorino to create a paste. Carefully not too add to much at a time and make sure it is all absorbed before adding more. Add some of the ground pepper as well, it should look like a cookies and cream ice cream almost - set aside.\n\nCook pasta to Al dente and then place the pasta into a stainless steel bowl. Bring the pasta water down to low heat and wait about 1 min. Add a ladle of water to pasta, a generous helping of pepper and add also the cheese paste. Begin stirring vigorously with tongs and you will need to also \"mantecare\" the pasta here. Please google this as it is hard to explain this process but essentially, slowly, slowly, everything should start to come together and a delightful cream should begin forming. If too watery, add more cheese, if too wet, add more water. If it cools down too quick, add the bowl back to the pot of pasta water like a double boiler but please be careful with the heat as it can split the sauce. \nServe into a brown and garnish with more pecorino and pepper.\n\nBuon appetito!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/osskckdhqywe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745578970.0, "score": 120, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1k7i5is/another_cacio_e_pepe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cacio e pepe - with homemade pasta!", "selftext": "Since the dawn of time, humankind has always wondered...\nWhat if I were to make cacio e pepe but with a fresh home made Spaghetti alla chitarra?\n\nWould it work? Would it be terrible?\n\nI have embarked on this journey and have lived to tell the tale...\n\nThis was absolutely awesome.\n\nWas it better than using a bronze cut dried tonnarello or spaghetto? It was different.\n\nThe dough was simply water and semola, kneaded twice and rested once for 15 mins, ann then in the fridge overnight. Google the method for that, there are an abundance.\n\nRecipe below:\nFor 500g of bronze cut pasta, ideally spaghetti alla chitarra or tonnarelli:\n- 275g-300g of Pecorino Romano cheese (whole)\n- A handful of peppercorns\n\nStart by freshly grating room temperature pecorino romano cheese. The key here is that it needs to be grated with a microplace because of the way it renders the cheese very fine and fluffy, perfect for creating the creamy sauce. If you can't find a microplace, just a regular grater should do the trick. Set aside into a bowl.\n\nNext, toast your peppercorns on a medium heat whilst constantly swirling the pan (ensuring not to burn). For 2-3 mins until aromatic. Take off heat and put into mortar and pestle and grind straight away.\n\nBoil some water to boil. When boiling, add some salt (not too much because pecorino is already very salty). Take some cooking water and mix with some room temperature water to make it warm (around 50-60 degrees Celsius) and slowly start adding to pecorino to create a paste. Carefully not too add to much at a time and make sure it is all absorbed before adding more. Add some of the ground pepper as well, it should look like a cookies and cream ice cream paste almost - set aside.\n\nCook pasta to Al dente (like 30 seconds literally if fresh pasta) and then place the pasta into a spacious stainless steel bowl. Bring the pasta water down to low heat and wait about 1 min. Add a ladle of water to pasta, a generous helping of pepper and add also the cheese paste. Begin stirring vigorously with tongs and you will need to also \"mantecare\" the pasta here. Please google this as it is hard to explain this process but essentially, slowly, slowly, everything should start to come together and a delightful cream should begin forming. If too watery, add more cheese, if too wet, add more water. If it cools down too quick, add the bowl back to the pot of pasta water like a double boiler but please be careful with the heat as it can split the sauce. \nServe into a bowl and garnish with more pecorino and pepper and Buon appetito!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0gn2w", "created_utc": 1744797439.0, "score": 251, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1k0gn2w/cacio_e_pepe_with_homemade_pasta/", "html_title": ""}

They still melted in your mouth after surviving the boil to ice water to frying with sauce sequence! \n\nI used about 3lb of russet potatoes and it took me about 4 hours start to finish (but I\u2019m usually way slower than other people at things so keep that in mind). \n\nI wish I had a pic to show but alas I\u2019m a Snapchat ho and my pics have disappeared into the ether. \n\nJust wanted to share my experience in case anyone was like me and wondering if the machine was ever going to work for their gnocchis :) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pasta/comments/1jzupz7/gnocchi_with_cavatelli_machine/", "created_utc": 1744730801.0, "score": 2, "author": "mangopinecone", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jzupz7/gnocchi_with_cavatelli_machine/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Home made Spaghetti alla chitarra con pomodorini, 'nduja e guanciale", "selftext": "This was very tasty, almost similar to an amatriciana with 'nduja adder but I am aware this is not amatriciana so I am not calling that, it's just for perspective.\nThe spaghetti were made and rolled from a semola flour and water only dough which was a conscious decision as I thought the sauce was a little rich but it was absolutely stunning. \n\nDough:\n- 500g of semola flour (semolina)\n- 248g of tepid water\n- pinch of salt\n\nI am not going to explain how the dough is made as there is an abundance of videos out there. However, I will advise that I flattened the sfoglie as normal until setting 4 on my imperia roller and then moved over to the chitarra box and rolled them out. I needed 3 times, the first two rested for 15 mins and the final one overnight in the fridge. This helped the dough to become delightful and airy.\n\nSauce:\n- a lot of cherry tomatoes\n- a lot of EVO oil\n- 350g of guanciale\n- handful of 'nduja (see photo for reference)\n- half an onion.\n- salted pasta water (obviously)\n- grated pecorino\n- basil leaves\n\nHalf the cherry tomatoes and season generously with salt, EV olive oil and some lemon rind. Lay out onto a baking tray lined with parchmebt paper and roast/confit at 180 degrees until very soft and intensified. It took me about an hour, I don't know how powerful your oven is so be instinctive. This can be done even a couple days before. Put into a container and refrigerate with some basil leaves.\nBring a big pot of lots of water on to boil. When it does, add salt. Take the cooked cherry tomatoes and use a stick blenser to puree along with some pasta water until the desired consistency is obtained, and set aside this slurry for now.\nCut the guanciale into 1cmx1cm cubes and place into a cold pan. Bring the heat up to medium and fry, turning to avoid burning. Once you see the fat rendering, tip into a separate container, being careful not to let the guanciale dall' out of the pan (I use a slotted chef's spoon to facilitate). Repeat this process, I usually do it three times and buy that stage the guanciale is a delicious golden brown that is rendered crispy on the outside and soft a luscious on the inside (this is a direct rip off of Luciano Monosilio because it works amazingly well).\n\nAdd the reserved fat back to the same pan and fry your onion until soft and translucent and then add the 'nduja in pieces as per the image. Melt this down with some of the cooking water to help emulsify. Add the cherry tomato slurry and begin mixing. Bring to boil then turn off the heat. Add your pasta and cook. If it's fresh pasta, will only take like three minutes otherwise and in any case, obviously cook it until all dente.\nDrain the pasta and toss through the sauce vigorously \"mantecando\" until you have the desired thickness add some pecorino romano and more cooking water if necessary. \nServe into bowls and buon appetito!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsnpkz", "created_utc": 1743920522.0, "score": 376, "author": "_Brasa_", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jsnpkz/home_made_spaghetti_alla_chitarra_con_pomodorini/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Bolognese Lasagna (Help needed)", "selftext": "Hello everyone! How\u2019s it going?  \nOn Sunday, I\u2019ll be hosting some guests at my place (4 adults and 3 children), and I want to make a classic Bolognese lasagna (or as classic as possible \ud83d\ude05).  \nI\u2019ve made this dish a few times before, so I\u2019m familiar with all the work it involves (I\u2019ve even shared the process here on Reddit).  \nI\u2019d like to share with you the recipes I plan to use, but mostly, the schedule I intend to follow (preparation, storage, cooking, etc.).  \nMy main questions are about how preparing some steps ahead of time might influence the flavor, consistency, texture, etc., of the lasagna.\n\n**Saturday afternoon:**\n\n* Make the Rag\u00f9 (estimated time: 3 hours and 30 minutes) In a large pan, brown the meats (guanciale, ground beef (2/3), and ground pork (1/3)), and deglaze with white wine. \n* In another pot, make the soffritto (onion, carrot, and celery), then add the meats, passata, and fresh herbs. Add water, and let it simmer on low for 3 hours (or until the meats are tender). Season with salt and pepper, and at the end, add a bit of milk. Let it cool and refrigerate (until the next day. Take it out 20 minutes before assembling).\n* Make the green pasta (while the rag\u00f9 is cooking): Beat eggs and spinach. Mix the '00' flour with the liquid. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate (until the next morning).\n\n**Sunday morning:**\n\n* Make the B\u00e9chamel: Butter, flour, milk, salt, and nutmeg.\n* Roll out the pasta.\n* Pre-cook the pasta sheets in salted water, then shock them in cold water.\n* Dry the pasta sheets with a cloth, drizzle with a little olive oil to prevent sticking, and stack them.\n\n**Sunday, 2 hours before serving lunch:**\n\n* Assemble the lasagna, layer by layer: \n   * Rag\u00f9 + B\u00e9chamel Pasta Rag\u00f9 + B\u00e9chamel + cheese (repeat until the last layer) Top: B\u00e9chamel and cheese for gratin\u00e9ing. \n* Place in the oven (approximately 30 minutes). \n* Let the lasagna rest for 30 minutes. \n* Serve.\n\nIn your opinion, is it possible to optimize this process? Since I\u2019ll be doing everything alone, I\u2019m always worried about timing \ud83d\ude05.  \nFor example:  \n\\- Could I roll out the pasta on Saturday and store it in the fridge?  \n\\- Is it possible to make the B\u00e9chamel on Saturday as well?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pasta/comments/1jrfc96/bolognese_lasagna_help_needed/", "created_utc": 1743782196.0, "score": 1, "author": "sholderbuffalo", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/pasta/comments/1jrfc96/bolognese_lasagna_help_needed/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe", "selftext": "I don\u2019t usually make Cacio e Pepe because of how precise you sometimes need to be so you don\u2019t get all of those cheese lumps that can maybe happen. But once you find your proper technique to cook it, it\u2019s hard to drift away from it. I cook the spaghetti on a separate pot, while on a pan I add some crushed black peppercorns to toast, while adding some of the pasta cooking water (2 and a half-3 ladles).
