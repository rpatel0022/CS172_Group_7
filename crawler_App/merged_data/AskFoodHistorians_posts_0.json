Was limewater found in the wild by the mesoamericans or was it mixed separately? Maybe some water had residues of quicklime resulting in limewater being \"accidental\" produced?

{"title": "Historian demolishes \"Italian food tradition\", is this just marketing?", "selftext": "The Austrian Standard just published an interview with historian Alberto Grandi in which \"Italian food tradition\" is pretty much demolished.\n\nWhile it's understood that \"tradition\" always is fabricated to a certain extent, I as a mod of a food-related sub would be very much interested on *food historians'* take on this interview, in particular whether this is just marketing in order to sell his book about that topic.\n\nSource (in German): https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000232054/historiker-die-italienische-kueche-ist-nichts-anderes-als-marketing\n\nTranslation from German into English via DeepL:\n\n\\---\n\n**Historian: \u2018Italian cuisine is nothing more than marketing\u2019**\n\n*When we think of Italy, we immediately think of pasta, pizza and other delicious food. Specialities such as Neapolitan margherita or Roman carbonara have become as legendary as the Colosseum, the Amalfi Coast and Pompeii. Italian cuisine has long since developed a cult following. People refer to alleged original recipes from the times of the Medici dynasty or which originate from poor shepherds in the Apennines. Deviations from these recipes are met with veritable shitstorms on social media.*\n\n*Cucina italiana, the traditional cuisine, is not to be trifled with. Historian Alberto Grandi is particularly annoyed by this glorification of food. That's why he researched the true history of the origins of Italian dishes. What did he find out? Everything is fake. The carbonara, the origin stories, even the culinary figure of the nonna. In his book* Mythos Nationalgericht*, he claims that Italy's famous cuisine only developed after the Second World War.*\n\nSTANDARD: In some articles about your book, you are described as the \u2018destroyer of Italian cuisine\u2019. Is that true?\n\nGrandi: I'm not destroying it, I'm telling a different kind of story about Italian cuisine.\n\nSTANDARD: What is that?\n\nGrandi: We have simply invented a lot of recipes and stories over the last 50 years. There is an excess of myths and legends surrounding Italian cuisine. It's nothing more than marketing. \n\nSTANDARD: So when I read that tiramisu originated from a dish in the 17th century and was eaten by the de Medici family, that's a fairy tale?\n\nGrandi: Yes, it's marketing. There's nothing reprehensible about it. Marketing is there to sell products. Tiramisu could only have been invented in the 60s or 70s. Mascarpone requires refrigeration to produce and was not available to everyone. It only became possible with the development of supermarkets. My mum is now 90. 50 years ago, mascarpone was an absolute novelty for her.\n\nSTANDARD: Why do you have a problem with the way stories about food are passed on?  \nGrandi: Food has such an enormous significance in our culture. And I find that strange. As a historian, I find it difficult that food is now the most important aspect of identity for Italians. I find that dangerous. Just this morning I was discussing this with a friend. He said that everything in Italy depends on tourism and food. That is not true. 90 per cent of Italy's GDP cannot be attributed to tourism. The reactions to my work show that many Italians are unaware of the economic and social reality of our country.\n\nSTANDARD: Food is an emotional topic. Just when it comes to preparing a dish \u2018properly\u2019. For many people, carbonara can only be made with guanciale and pecorino.\n\nGrandi: Ten or 15 years ago, Gualtiero Marchesi, one of the most important Italian chefs, added whipped cream to carbonara. Today, people would go crazy over it. Carbonara is not a recipe, it's a religion. A Roman journalist once threatened me with a beating because of such statements in my book.\n\nSTANDARD: Is there such a thing? A right or wrong?\n\nGrandi: The story of the Amatriciana sauce comes to mind. If you use onions for the sauce today, you are declared crazy. But the long history shows that the only really constant ingredient from the beginning of the 20th century until ten years ago was the onion. So: what is the right recipe?  \nSTANDARD: But why is that happening?\n\nGrandi: Cuisine is no longer part of our identity, it is our identity. Italians have no faith in the future, and that's why they invent a past. The one true Italian cuisine doesn't exist. It's the same with the Nonnas, the grandmothers. They can't cook as well as is always claimed. Grandmas can make two or three good dishes and that's it.\n\nSTANDARD: You're telling me the dear old Nonnas are fake?\n\nGrandi: When it comes to cooking, yes. They cook big meals on public holidays, but the rest of the year they cook badly and monotonously.\n\nSTANDARD: Nonnas are the experts for Italian food on social media.\n\nGrandi: Massimo Bottura, a very well-known chef, says he learnt everything from his nonna. That's completely impossible. The ingredients, the flavours, the cooking techniques that a nonna had at her disposal before the world wars are completely different to today. That's another legend.\n\nSTANDARD: What did people eat then if not pasta and pizza?\n\nGrandi: Until the First World War, pasta was only known in Naples. The rest of the Italians ate a lot of vegetables, soup and polenta. They cooked with chestnut flour and lard. So not the Mediterranean diet that we know. That is also an invention. Nobody ate like that.\n\nSTANDARD: Really?\n\nGrandi: If you look at southern Italy today, it is the region with the highest obesity rate. In the past, people ate badly and little, today they eat too much and too much.\n\nSTANDARD: Which true story of a dish surprised you the most?\n\nGrandi: Perhaps the strangest story is that of Parmigiano Reggiano. Parmesan has a very long history, almost 2000 years. During this time, the cheese has undergone many changes. In its original form - small, soft, greasy and black on the outside - it is produced in Wisconsin in the USA. Italian emigrants brought it with them. It was not until the 1960s that it was developed into its current form in Parma.  \nSTANDARD: So how did the terrible Italian food become the fantastic Italian food?\n\nGrandi: On the one hand, the great emigration of Italians between 1860 and 1960 was a factor. At that time, 25 million people left the country. Thanks to economic growth, some of them came back in the middle of the 20th century and brought with them dishes and recipes that are now sold as originals.\n\nSTANDARD: Which dishes would that be?\n\nGrandi: Pizza, for example. Pizza was invented in Naples, but it tasted awful. The dough was firm, burnt on the outside and still doughy on the inside. And without tomatoes. It was only thanks to the Italian diaspora that pizza was further developed and improved in the USA.\n\nSTANDARD: One of the most famous stories is that the pizza was created for Queen Margherita's visit and represents the colours of the Italian flag.\n\nGrandi: There is a document on which this story is written. It's a forgery. Pizza Margherita was only invented years after the Queen's death. She never ate it. What you find in Naples today is an American invention.\n\nSTANDARD: So the Americans put mozzarella and tomatoes on the pizza?  \nGrandi: Exactly. Tomato sauce is not Italian either. It comes from Spain. It only really became established after the Second World War. Tomato sauce is difficult to preserve. It needed industrialisation for that.\n\nSTANDARD: Is there any real traditional Italian food at all?\n\nGrandi: The worst word you can use for Italian cuisine is traditional. There is no culinary tradition.\n\nSTANDARD: You have falsified tomato sauce, parmesan, tiramisu and pizza. What about Bolognese?\n\nGrandi: Everyone makes Bolognese differently. There is no original recipe. Today, however, people say that Bolognese is cooked without tomatoes. But you can't prove that.\n\nSTANDARD: And carbonara?\n\nGrandi: Carbonara is a little different. Although it originated in Italy, it comes from the Americans. At the end of the Second World War, after the conquest of Rome, the soldiers combined their rations of egg powder and bacon with pasta. They called it \u2018spaghetti breakfast\u2019. So it didn't come from the charcoal burners in the Apennines, who prepared pasta with bacon and cheese during their break. Incidentally, the first recipe for carbonara was published in Chicago in 1952. Only two years later in Italy. And even that was different from the modern version. Gruy\u00e8re cheese, pancetta and garlic were used.\n\nSTANDARD: In Austria, carbonara is also cooked with whipped cream and ham.\n\nGrandi: Whipped cream was often used in carbonara recipes right up until the 1970s.\n\nSTANDARD: So our version is not a fake carbonara?\n\nGrandi: There is no such thing as a fake carbonara. Every recipe has its justification. But don't say that out loud when you're in Italy.\n\nSTANDARD: Let's go through the rest. What about olive oil?\n\nGrandi: That's a very strange story. Fifty years ago, olive oil was used for everything except cooking. For oil lamps, for example. It tasted very sour and very intense. It was unsuitable for food. Italians tended to cook with lard, butter or margarine. It wasn't until the 80s that the quality of the oil improved so that it could be used for cooking.\n\nSTANDARD: Pasta comes from China, doesn't it?\n\nGrandi: Yes and no. Pasta came into the country via Sicily through the Arabs. Pasta used to be eaten by hand and only mixed with garlic, fat and cheese.\n\nSTANDARD: Can you still go out to eat in your home country without being insulted?\n\nGrandi: (Laughs.) I don't know what it would be like in Naples, I haven't ventured there yet, but yes, I can still go out to eat.\n\nSTANDARD: What do you eat then?\n\nGrandi: Spaghetti with tomato sauce.  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1euaky0/historian_demolishes_italian_food_tradition_is/", "created_utc": 1723873781.0, "score": 530, "author": "Gulliveig", "num_comments": 170, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1euaky0/historian_demolishes_italian_food_tradition_is/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Did actual slicing onions (not green onions) play a prominent role in Chinese cuisine before modern shipping and industrialization?", "selftext": "I've been researching onions and have been surprised about their cultivation needs. The main takeaway: pre-modern onion cultivation was a lot more regionalized than most people assume.\n\nOnions are weird--they make bulbs depending on day length.

{"title": "how did medieval people handle such high fiber diets?", "selftext": "I'm going off memory here, so the details may be off, but I recall reading about medieval Scottish peasants living off a diet that was perhaps as high as 80% of caloric intake from oats alone.  This with a perhaps 3000+ calorie diet to accommodate the high physical workload.  Now I'll assume the majority of this would have been eaten as oatcakes, as to eat that amount of oatmeal would necessitate eating dozens of bowls given the decreased caloric density of an oat 'soup'.  Nonetheless, the fiber intake would be astronomical compared to contemporary standards.  I spent a year eating 900 calories worth of oats a day and felt absolutely awful every day, I never pushed through to 'adapted to this food.'  I don't believe I have any sensitivity to oats either, as I've experience the same phenomenon with many whole grains if eaten in excess, oats just seem particularly offensive given the higher soluble fiber to insoluble fiber ratio.

Here's the relevant passage, which I'm quoting in full: \"What is interesting is that this particular type of sweet bread it is found in one other region in the world: Asia. Japan's sweet, yeasted bread roll topped with a cookie-like crust is known as melonpan. The \"pan\" part of the word is said to come from the Portuguese for bread. The \"melon\" from the English word, which references the shape of the finished breads; they are traditionally scored in a crosshatch to look like melons verses in a gradient curve like the Mexican concha. It is possible that the cross pollination of this type of sweetened, yeasted bread topped with a crumbly cookie crust started in Mexico and then spread to Asia. According to bread historian Steven L. Kaplan and culinary historian Linda Civitello, it is perhaps more likely that the two creations originated on different continents independently of one another. Civitello posits it's as a result of \"Iberian peninsula diaspora...when the Portuguese sailed east, the Spanish sailed west.\" While the Spanish invaded the Americas in the early 1500s, the Portuguese invaded Japan. The neighboring European countries made use of the same sorts of bread-baking techniques and were likely using a variety of recipes to convince their respective colonies to embrace wheat breads, despite a distaste for wheat among the conquered population and a preference for rice (Japan) and corn (Mexico).\"\n\nIn other words, there are (at least) two hypotheses about the similarities between conchas and melonpan. One is a mysterious and unknown spread from Mexico to Asia (although that might question the Portuguese etymology of the Japanese word 'pan,' unless the word has a different history than the food). Another is spontaneous invention based on similar culinary resources.\n\nIn my (admittedly brief) attempt to fit pineapple buns into this (admittedly incomplete) picture, I came across a *South China Morning Post* [piece](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1587246/secrets-behind-serving-hong-kongs-hot-cross-buns) that profiles a Hong Kong bakery that's been making pineapple buns since the 1940s. The bakery's owner, Tse Ching-yuen, says that, \"Before we started producing pineapple buns in Hong Kong in the 1940s, there was something similar in Japan. But its ultimate origin is unknown.\"\n\nDoes anyone have any additional information or insight on the origins of these similar buns?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/fwzxye/pineapple_buns_melonpan_and_conchas_what_is_their/", "created_utc": 1586321118.0, "score": 167, "author": "umbrella-or-not", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/fwzxye/pineapple_buns_melonpan_and_conchas_what_is_their/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

They cut ice blocks out of a pond on the South Platte river floodplain in town, and stored it in a large wooden building with a stone foundation.\n\nUsing salt and ice (an endothermic reaction) you can make ice cream. Apparently there was enough ice stored up to have ice cream in Denver in September. https://history.denverlibrary.org/news/denver/ice-houses-how-early-denver-kept-its-cool \n\n(For those who haven't been, Denver is on the high plains next to the Rocky Mountains. When winds are directly westerly, chinook winds can suddenly make the area extremely warm and dry. It's definitely not Aspen or Vale--there are many days, even in the transition seasons, when you'd prefer ice cream over hot chocolate).\n\nI didn't picture saloons in the Wild West selling ice cream, but apparently that was the case.\n\nNow I am trying to figure out two things:\n\n1) Where else in the U.S. was ice stored locally, instead of being shipped from New England, and used to make ice cream in the 19th century? The Western USA makes sense to me because of elevation, but IDK.\n\n2) What flavors were popular at the time? In passing, one historian told me that fruit flavors dominated at the time and in particular, orange blossom was a popular flavor at the time that is mostly lost now.\n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hox0o0/i_was_surprised_to_read_that_denver_colorado_was/", "created_utc": 1735482302.0, "score": 154, "author": "Caraway_Lad", "num_comments": 36, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hox0o0/i_was_surprised_to_read_that_denver_colorado_was/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Hang in there though, I promise this is relevant and belongs in this sub.\n\nI learn Talmud with a good friend of mine, and today we learned [Sotah 4a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.4a?lang=bi), which primarily focuses on an argument over how long it takes to have sex. Or how long it takes to *start* having sex, possibly. It's a whole thing, and it would take way too long to explain why it's a relevant question in context, but suffice it to say, the sages of the time had a *lot* of opinions on the topic. The amount of time it takes to walk around a palm tree. The amount of time it takes to mix a glass of wine. The amount of time it takes to drink that glass of wine.\n\nAnd according to Ben Azzai: the amount of time it takes to roast an egg.\n\nI went grocery shopping a little later in the day, and I bought some eggs. When I got home it occurred to me that I actually have no idea how to roast an egg, let alone how long it takes, and double let alone how one might have roasted an egg \\~2000 years ago. Of course we have roasted eggs as part of the Passover seder, but I believe most people boil those before roasting them (and I'm quite sure that's what my mom did). And, given the context, I kind of doubt that's what Ben Azzai had in mind.\n\nSo, food historians of Reddit, my understanding is the Talmud is a compendium of teachings from the Tannaic period, roughly 10-200 CE, collected both from Jerusalem and its surroundings and Babylonia (we're learning the Babylonian version, but it spends plenty of time discussing opinions and accounts from Jerusalem as well).

{"title": "Why do some countries have \u201cbad food\u201d?", "selftext": "I know that these kind of questions are usually refuted by naming traditional dishes of the country that was considered to have bad food. I would generally agree with this sentiment. From what I\u2019ve seen, countries generally have tasty dishes that those country\u2019s people enjoy.\n\nThat being said, the statement that some countries have bad food still seems true to me. I grew up in Germany, which has very enjoyable (albeit often also very hearty) regional dishes. I would still say that Germany has bad food or a bad food culture (not even factoring in health). The general sentiment in the population is that food needs to be filling and cheap. Therefore, restaurants often offer mediocre quality and use a lot of pre-made and instant ingredients to keep prices low. There seems to be no real appreciation for quality in food. Regional dishes are often known to be of low quality in restaurants (e.g. K\u00e4ssp\u00e4tzle in Swabia) and only made in good quality at home. High quality restaurants will mostly cook french inspired food instead of refining local dishes.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to France where food is celebrated much more. Local dishes are made very well in restaurants and taste is rated over quantity. This goes for so many things, like pastries, wine, etc. While Germany has excellent examples of all of these, the average quality is considerably lower.\n\nAn argument that I\u2019ve often read is that countries with bad food have had less varied produce historically. This seems to be correlated, since in Europe for example, southern countries are often considered to have good food and northern not so much. This argument is not satisfying to me, since from my experience all countries have enjoyable dishes to some extent.\n\nAre there historical/cultural explanations for the way food and food quality is appreciated in different countries?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16bdndp/why_do_some_countries_have_bad_food/", "created_utc": 1693985268.0, "score": 113, "author": "Comfortable-Incident", "num_comments": 71, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16bdndp/why_do_some_countries_have_bad_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Not a question per se, but I'd love to learn more about the history of steamed buns.", "selftext": "A Chinese friend and I were discussing bread, and how the two cooking styles apparently diverged where Westerners baked and Easterners steamed. And we found that baking is definitely older, but steaming is also ancient. And now I'm going down wiki rabbit-holes,  wondering where it all started.\n\nI presume rice steamers were repurposed for steaming boazi/mantou/manju, but steaming food happened really early, even outside of China, in Italy (Bronze age) and the Americas (10 000 y.a.). And shoabing, a baked bread, has been in China for about 2000 years already, so now I'm not even sure the steamed buns are China's ur-bread. I suspect the natural progression for bread would be chew raw grain -> boil grain -> mill and boil grain -> mill, leaven then bake grain -> mill, leaven then steam grain, but I'm hoping someone knows (or has access to) a more definitive source. Basically I would like to know the history of steamed buns and breads in China. I'd also love to know why this technique developed. I don't really see the benefit of steaming over other cooking methods. For steamed buns, the texture is obviously different, but that would be such a luxury food for bronze age cooks. For grains, vegetables and meats, boiling would be far more practical; no need to constantly weave and repair steaming baskets.\n\n Also, I would live a recipe for the unleavened shoabing.

{"title": "Why is there a striking similarity between Mexican Cuisine and Indian Cuisine?", "selftext": " I have always found this rather fascinating and no one seems to talk about it much!\n\n\\- Wheat tortillas are prepared and rolled out just like the rotis or chappatis\u00a0 of India. These are then wrapped in a cloth and stored in a basket, or in a special plastic container to keep them warm.  \n\\- Both the countries use grinding stone to make their dips (chutney)  \n\\- Tamarind and chillies are most used spices and they native to India  \n\\- Mexican rice dishes are cooked similarly like our Pulao (Indian Rice)  \n\\- Rajma (beans) is a staple diet in both the countries  \n\\- Beer is often accompanied by savouries such as Cashew, peanuts and chips  \n\\- Tlacoyos and yet another type of quesadillas are like the Indian \u201cparathas\u201d stuffed with a variety of fillings like potatoes, radish, etc. and cooked on the griddle.  \n\\- Crispy, deep-fried tortillas called tostadas have cousins in many Indian snacks like \u201cmasala papads\u201d\u00a0 and spicy \u201cchaats\u201d when they are laden with fresh salsa. But otherwise, tostadas are very often piled with meat, frijoles refritos and salad.\n\nSo the Indus Valley Civilization is marked to be the birthplace of the modern agriculture in the Indian subcontinent which is dated to be at around 3000 BC. The influence of agriculture seemed to have worked upon both the civilizations simultaneously but the usage of grains and rice and their preparation for consumption is strikingly similiar in both these nations. It is, in my opinion, impossible to be a coincidence or rather a climatic factor leading to such food habits. There has to be a connection of some sort between the communication of both people, however, nothing is documented.\n\nThe inception of both the cuisines seems to have been at nearly the same age.\n\n*Source from Wikipedia:*  \n*\"****Mexican cuisine*** *began about 9000 years ago, when agricultural communities such as the* [*Maya*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization) *formed, domesticating* [*maize*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize)*, creating the standard process of* [*corn*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn) [*nixtamalization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization)*, and establishing their* [*foodways*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_cuisine) *.\"*\n\n*\"* ***Indian cuisine*** *reflects an* [*8,000-year history*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India) *of various groups and cultures interacting with the* [*Indian subcontinent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent)*, leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India.

Rather, I believe that this dish originated or was inspired by a delicious Sichuan dish known as [Dry-Fried Shredded Beef \u5e72\u7178\u725b\u8089\u4e1d](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B2%E7%85%B8%E7%89%9B%E8%82%89%E4%B8%9D/954218) *(gan bian niu rou si)*\u2014which itself originates from a fried rice-paddy eel dish.\n\nDry-frying involves neither marinade nor sauce, and traditionally relies on the gradual drying out of the main ingredient over moderate heat, with the subsequent addition of spices and flavorings. The beef, which is cut into strips, ends up slightly crisp and chewy, with a delicious toasty fragrance and a dry, spicy taste *(Dunlop, The Food of Sichuan)*.\n\nThere is a distinct homogeneity between the sweet deep-fried Western versions\u2014in stark contrast to the spicy dry-fried Chinese [original](https://k.sina.cn/article_6677863968_18e081e2000100dwqi.html)\u2014which begs the question of where the sweet Western version of this dish originated and who created it?\n\nThe rise of crispy beef in the West appears to have coincided with the haute British- and American-Chinese (\u201cchinois\u201d) restaurant [movement](https://www.seriouseats.com/ed-schoenfeld-chinese-food-personal-history) of the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s in London and New York, respectively; including [Mr Chow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Chow), Shun Lee Palace, the original Hwa Yuan, and the late [Chin Chin](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?searchResultPosition=7#:~:text=shredded%20beef%20with%20chilies) and Tse Yang.

{"title": "Why wasn't there any attempt to mass produce malt sugar at the height of the European sugar trade?", "selftext": "Malt sugar is incredibly easy to produce. All you need is surplus grain, which could be easily obtained in Europe, unlike sugar cane. Considering how much beer was produced in Europe at the time, surely there would have been no problem setting aside some grain to make sugar. The process isn't complicated either, in fact, the first few steps are identical to the process of making beer. Yet nobody seemed to have gotten the idea of selling malt sugar to cash in on the demand for sweetness in Europe at the time.       \n\nIt isn't used nowadays because it doesn't store as well as white sugar and isn't as sweet. Maltose is extremely hygroscopic, to the point where it basically can't exist outside of syrup (solution) form in most environments. So from a modern perspective where mechanization has made cane sugar equally easy to produce, you are moving less sugar (as there is water included) and \"worse\" sugar for the same transportation cost.     \n\nBut in the past, surely the fact that malt sugar could be produced within Europe and with much less effort than pre-industrial cane sugar would have been massive points in its favor. Furthermore, people at that time would have been much more used to handling honey, so a syrupy sweetener wouldn't have been seen as a negative either.      \n\nIn fact we have an example of malt sugar out-competing cane sugar elsewhere in history. Despite sugar cane cultivation and sugar production being well known in China since the Tang dynasty, malt sugar remained the most popular form of sugar used all the way until industrialization. If you look at Qing era cookbooks, all the dessert recipes will call for malt sugar. I suspect the widespread usage of malt sugar also contributed to why beekeeping never really took off there either (knowledge of beekeeping is recorded as early as the 2nd century, having come through the silk road).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/l48suv/why_wasnt_there_any_attempt_to_mass_produce_malt/", "created_utc": 1611525782.0, "score": 81, "author": "LokiPrime13", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/l48suv/why_wasnt_there_any_attempt_to_mass_produce_malt/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

From my own research, there seems to be little of combining complementary ingredients.\n\nSay, if you brought down a deer, your tribe ate plain roast deer that night. Not \"roast deer with mushrooms\" or \"roast deer stuffed with berries\". Those things might have coincidentally been on the menu for the night, but they were not intentionally prepared together with the deer.\n\nHowever, there are times where two food sources would have been routinely found together. For example, freshwater mussels and lotus roots are often found right next to each other.

I remember lots of heavy cream, sugar, cinnamon, beef tallow, and lard. I'm sure a little vanilla as well. I remember using a meat tenderizer hammer to make little holes all over the dough. Then she would spread a thin layer of filling. I think she baked it like that, and then when out of oven, we would flip half the sheet like a book. You ended up with a thin pastry with layer of thin dough, then thin layer of filling, and top layer of thin dough. All 3 layers were almost the same thickness. The dough would get hard if you didn't keep it bagged, but was still good even when a little dry. I remember breaking pieces off of it. \nI would love to taste this recipe one more time in my life.

It seems to me that Indian cooks realized that tomatoes were a flavorful acidic ingredient, and creatively swapped it for yogurt in recipes.\n\nI have since tried my own transformations of recipes based on this particular ingredient swap. I have subbed tomato puree for the buttermilk in crepe recipes many times now and it makes delicious, tender crepes that go well with any filling, savory or sweet. This was a lightbulb-going-on moment for me. I have since though of other likely swaps in recipes (like the recent question about rices, I imagine cultures in both hemispheres could envision swapping out oats, rice, quinoa, etc fairly easily for each other). Some swaps seem more obvious to me than the tomatoes for yogurt one, like I assume hot peppers were used in dishes that previously used peppercorns.\n\nAm I right about this pattern of new ingredient usage?

{"title": "Spaghetti and meatballs - Italian or not?", "selftext": "I have long been under the impression that spaghetti and meatballs was an  Italian-American creation.  That conventional wisdom can be found all over, including at Wikipedia.  \n>Spaghetti and meatballs was an innovation of Italian immigrants in New York City, who had access to a more plentiful meat supply than in Italy.[2][3]\n\n\n>^ 2  Frankie Celenza (2018-07-03). \"Italian-American Food Never Claimed To Be Italian, So You Can Stop Hating On It\". HuffPost. \n\nWell gee, it was in HuffPo so it must be true! \n \n^ 3 Allie Lembo (2018-10-11). \"7 'Italian' foods Americans eat that you typically won't find in Italy\". insider.  \n\nSo I go to Insider and it turns out Lembo's source is [Smithsonian Magazine]( https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/is-spaghetti-and-meatballs-italian-94819690/) which says \"But those large meatballs, doused in marinara over spaghetti are 100 percent American.\"  (Why the wiki author didn't just cite the original source I have no idea.)   Smithsonian relates the usual story that, as in the other much less known story of corned beef and the Irish immigrants, it was the creation of people who could now afford to eat it. They also \"explain\"  that in Italy pasta is usually a primo piatto and  propose that it became a secondo here because Anglo-American diners were accustomed to having a starch - usually potatoes -  accompaniment to their proteins,  so to satisfy the requests of their clientele, these early Italian restaurants married the main course meat dishes with pasta, or because  spaghetti was only one of the only Italian ingredients available in the U.S.,  and it became more popular in the home to new immigrants who were adjusting to their newfound overflowing cornucopia.  That's plausible but it seems a bit shaky, perhaps  looking at  the past through the lens of the present.  The author is not a historian of any kind.  \n\n\nNow,  I've had the opportunity to inform some hose  pretentious ethnic  snobs whose gatekeeping  comments often  appear in /r/iamveryculinary,   that they are correct that the pictured dish isn't how you'd get it in Italy, because as it's an Italian-American dish, you're unlikely to get it in Italy.    \n\nBut perhaps I was a bit _too_ smug?  I just learned of [spaghetti con le polpettine](https://www.giallozafferano.it/images/11-1138/Spaghetti-con-le-polpettine_450x300.jpg) and was told that is popular, at least in Rome.  \n\n[This Italian site](https://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Spaghetti-con-le-polpettine.html)  says \"spaghetti with meatballs are a rich and substantial first course that for this reason is considered an appetizing single dish.\"  Yeah, the translation leaves a bit to be desired.  There an interesting comment: \"This recipe is very good. I'm from Rome and my mother always made pasta with meatballs sauce. I'm curious to know where the idea that this is not an Italian dish comes from.\" \n\nCan anyone settle this, or shall I keep shooting my mouth off, secure in the knowledge that the entire Internet seems to think it's an Italian-American  creation?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/jx8zj4/spaghetti_and_meatballs_italian_or_not/", "created_utc": 1605812805.0, "score": 68, "author": "YourFairyGodmother", "num_comments": 31, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/jx8zj4/spaghetti_and_meatballs_italian_or_not/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Not to forget that, unlike pigs and sheep, it would be difficult to confine cattle herd in a barn during the winter time.\nSure, people had cows. However, it was bred for its milk, not necessarily to slaughter in order to obtain its meat. Perhaps that's the reason ( or one of the reasons) why there are few beef dishes in many European and Asian cuisines compared to pork, lamb, poultry and seafood.\nI guess another aspect of why the high consumption of meat is so recent is that only a few countries have the \"geographical\" luck of having enough plain land that is appropriate for breeding cattle in a large scale, in which can include countries like the US, Brazil, Australia, Argentina, etc. One curious fact is that these countries are former colonies, in which had other functions and activities during its colonial time and would start a beef production long after their respective independences. Perhaps that's another factor to it.\n\nWell, this is just my thoughts. I'm don't have a major in history, nor do I know if these points are historically valid.

I checked the city directories and did not find anything. When I searched \"silver leaf flour\" in our digitized newspaper I got a ton of advertisements for a new type of flour called Silver Leaf Flour that was milled at a few different mills in the general area. \n\nThe advertisements don't really explain what silver leaf flour is. Most mention the wheat being extracted in the winter, containing more gluten phosphates, and being of the upmost purity, but no mentions of what makes silver leaf flour silver leaf or the process. \n\nThese advertisements mostly range from the early 1900s to the 1910s. I checked the google ngram viewer for the phrase silver leaf flour and see results as early as 1880 but I can't seem to find anything relevant. \n\nWhen I just do a general search of the phrase Silver Leaf Flour I'm mostly getting digitized records from cultural institutions that have flour sacks of silver leaf flour in their collections. \n\nI tried to do a patent search to see if this kind of flour had some sort of new ground breaking technology for extraction but can't find one (I used the google patents, Justia database, and the UPSTO search but I'm not very good at searching for patents tbh). \n\nWhen I get stumped by a question I'll usually explain to the patron what I looked for and then my educated guesses but I have a feeling that I could use different search criteria or that this is something that is well known but I'm too in the weeds to think.   \n\n\nHere are my educated guesses, would anyone be willing to confirm my guesses or tell me if I'm going down the right path? \n\n1. Silver Leaf Flour is just a marketing term given to normal flour to encourage sales \n2. Silver Leaf Flour is fortified using extractions from Silver leaf maple trees (I did some blog posts about consuming maple seeds but nothing very definitive) \n3. Silver leaf flour is fortified with actual silver leaf like the thing edible leaf that bakers use on desserts\n4.

Maybe I have terrible searching criteria, but I can't find more than a couple images of actual traditional Chinese woks. I've seen one from the Smithsonian's collection, some from Wikipedia and a couple from stray mentions like Grace Young's website and her articles detailing some images and history. Everything else is just pictures of modern day woks, and that's not really what I'm looking for.\n\nFor something so ubiquitous in Chinese and east Asian food in general, historically abundant images of woks is hard to come by. I figure there must be some reason this is, like for example: low importance to document woks as you find them everywhere. But much like how people like to track the different designs of cereal through the years or document older recipes and vintage cookware, I wanted to know if there was a repository of wok pictures that I seem to be having trouble locating. Or anything at all pertaining to the more historical record of woks in general.\n\nAnother thing tangentially related that I'm surprised is hard to find information on in english speaking circles, is the difference between wrought iron and cast iron woks. According to a reddit post by the people who make Chinese Cooking Demystified on Youtube, wrought iron woks are the second most abundant kind of wok people have in China. I've also seen the distinction for hand hammered woks as well. This is greatly confusing. I think what's happening here is translation makes this difficult, and that hand hammered woks and wrought iron woks have a lot of overlap. Based on a cursory glance about wrought iron, its iron that has to be hit a lot to strengthen it for use.

{"title": "The first dinner of Arthur Rimbaud in Paris - Total Eclipse (1995)", "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am a Brazilian who is passionate about Arthur Rimbaud and French culture.\n\nI would like to know if this dish seen in the 1995 film \"Total Eclipse\", which portrays the poet's relationship with Paul Verlaine, fits into a traditional French dish, based on its visual aspect. I would like to know if there is anything more specific besides \"a simple soup made of whatever ingredients can be seen.\"\n\nBelow is some information that may help to clarify the matter. I am providing it thinking about the possibility that the production team had access to this information, regardless of whether it was used for any special purpose or not. This is because Christopher Hampton, the screenwriter of the original play and the film of the same name, demonstrates in his script that he has great knowledge about Rimbaud's life, providing details that do not appear in the final version of the film.\n\nWHERE: The scene takes place in the dining room on the ground floor of Mr. Maut\u00e9, located at 14 Rue Nicolet, Montmartre, in Paris.\n\nWHEN: This is the first night Rimbaud spent in Paris. He arrived in the city on the afternoon of September 24, 1871, a Sunday. Some biographies describe the weather in the capital as being quite pleasant that afternoon.\n\nSome important details about the characters that may also help:\n\n\\- The house did not belong to Paul Verlaine, the girl's husband and the person who had invited Rimbaud and paid for his one-way ticket, but to Theodore de Maut\u00e9, Verlaine's father-in-law.\n\n\\- No matter how kind the host family may have been, Rimbaud certainly did not receive a special dinner. Firstly, because he was not expected by everyone, and secondly, because of the way he arrived:\n\n1. Rimbaud left Verlaine waiting for him at the train station and set off alone in search of the poet's house. Therefore, he arrived at the house without him, alone, in the afternoon. He arrived without suitcases, looking unkempt and not at all concerned with making a good impression. When Verlaine and Charles Cros (not shown in the film) arrived home discouraged and did not find the young man at the station, they were shocked to see him already there.\n2. The biographies also say that Rimbaud's mother-in-law, Antoinette-Flore Chariat, was only informed about who the young man was when he arrived and, besides her husband, she, Mathilde, seemed to be the only one who knew about his arrival. Mr. Maut\u00e9, on the other hand, was away from home, hunting, and could not even imagine that his son-in-law was using his house to host someone, since he himself, in his father-in-law's opinion, should not be there. So much so that Rimbaud had to be hidden in a hurry as soon as he returned from hunting.\n3. Despite coming from an economically stable family, the fact that he was a young man from the countryside, with bad habits and depending on help to establish himself in Paris (Verlaine paid for his third-class train ticket) placed Rimbaud several notches below the social position occupied by the Maut\u00e9 family.\n\nAll this to say: there is nothing to suggest that this dinner was anything other than a typical Sunday dinner for a good family living in the Montmarte neighborhood in the early 1870s in Paris.\n\nAny guesses based on his visual appearance?  \nThank you!\n\n[Le premier d\u00eener - Total Eclipse (1995)](https://youtu.be/E1YCdKj5lbQ)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hso6s8/the_first_dinner_of_arthur_rimbaud_in_paris_total/", "created_utc": 1735916021.0, "score": 3, "author": "CurrentScore3146", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hso6s8/the_first_dinner_of_arthur_rimbaud_in_paris_total/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Well, cantaloupes are that same way today, and they've been domesticated at least as long as watermelons. \n\nSo I am wondering, in particular, if cantaloupe/other sweet melons were enjoyed by the middle/lower class in Ancient China / Bactria / various Islamic empires in Central Asia. And how deeply rooted are they, if at all, in the cuisine of those regions ?\n\nI know unsweet melons feature in a lot of salads like a cucumber today in East Asia, and that cantaloupes do not store or ship as well as watermelon or winter squash, so no matter what in a pre-industrial context they would be a summer / early fall fruit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hqgzum/historically_how_important_was_the_cantaloupe_or/", "created_utc": 1735658979.0, "score": 53, "author": "Caraway_Lad", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hqgzum/historically_how_important_was_the_cantaloupe_or/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I mean I wouldn't be surprised if there are Yakuza and other criminal groups who engage in a black market dog trade with something like a small isolated mountain community of less than 100 does eat dog and maybe a household in the forest regions eat dog secretly........

All salt went through government agencies. I think this is very similar to alcohol and tobacco in Canada. They then made exclusive deals with land locked cities, creating what is now know as Venetian salt contract.\n\nWith money in the bank, Venice flourished. It became a leading port, and businesses and reach expanded along with the range of goods traded. With all the money it was generating from regulation, Venice could develop its infrastructure.\n\nTill this time, there was no records of a state or government so dependant on Salt, except for China.

{"title": "Historian demolishes \"Italian food tradition\", is this just marketing?", "selftext": "The Austrian Standard just published an interview with historian Alberto Grandi in which \"Italian food tradition\" is pretty much demolished.\n\nWhile it's understood that \"tradition\" always is fabricated to a certain extent, I as a mod of a food-related sub would be very much interested on *food historians'* take on this interview, in particular whether this is just marketing in order to sell his book about that topic.\n\nSource (in German): https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000232054/historiker-die-italienische-kueche-ist-nichts-anderes-als-marketing\n\nTranslation from German into English via DeepL:\n\n\\---\n\n**Historian: \u2018Italian cuisine is nothing more than marketing\u2019**\n\n*When we think of Italy, we immediately think of pasta, pizza and other delicious food. Specialities such as Neapolitan margherita or Roman carbonara have become as legendary as the Colosseum, the Amalfi Coast and Pompeii. Italian cuisine has long since developed a cult following. People refer to alleged original recipes from the times of the Medici dynasty or which originate from poor shepherds in the Apennines. Deviations from these recipes are met with veritable shitstorms on social media.*\n\n*Cucina italiana, the traditional cuisine, is not to be trifled with. Historian Alberto Grandi is particularly annoyed by this glorification of food. That's why he researched the true history of the origins of Italian dishes. What did he find out? Everything is fake. The carbonara, the origin stories, even the culinary figure of the nonna. In his book* Mythos Nationalgericht*, he claims that Italy's famous cuisine only developed after the Second World War.*\n\nSTANDARD: In some articles about your book, you are described as the \u2018destroyer of Italian cuisine\u2019. Is that true?\n\nGrandi: I'm not destroying it, I'm telling a different kind of story about Italian cuisine.\n\nSTANDARD: What is that?\n\nGrandi: We have simply invented a lot of recipes and stories over the last 50 years. There is an excess of myths and legends surrounding Italian cuisine. It's nothing more than marketing. \n\nSTANDARD: So when I read that tiramisu originated from a dish in the 17th century and was eaten by the de Medici family, that's a fairy tale?\n\nGrandi: Yes, it's marketing. There's nothing reprehensible about it. Marketing is there to sell products. Tiramisu could only have been invented in the 60s or 70s. Mascarpone requires refrigeration to produce and was not available to everyone. It only became possible with the development of supermarkets. My mum is now 90. 50 years ago, mascarpone was an absolute novelty for her.\n\nSTANDARD: Why do you have a problem with the way stories about food are passed on?  \nGrandi: Food has such an enormous significance in our culture. And I find that strange. As a historian, I find it difficult that food is now the most important aspect of identity for Italians. I find that dangerous. Just this morning I was discussing this with a friend. He said that everything in Italy depends on tourism and food. That is not true. 90 per cent of Italy's GDP cannot be attributed to tourism. The reactions to my work show that many Italians are unaware of the economic and social reality of our country.\n\nSTANDARD: Food is an emotional topic. Just when it comes to preparing a dish \u2018properly\u2019. For many people, carbonara can only be made with guanciale and pecorino.\n\nGrandi: Ten or 15 years ago, Gualtiero Marchesi, one of the most important Italian chefs, added whipped cream to carbonara. Today, people would go crazy over it. Carbonara is not a recipe, it's a religion. A Roman journalist once threatened me with a beating because of such statements in my book.\n\nSTANDARD: Is there such a thing? A right or wrong?\n\nGrandi: The story of the Amatriciana sauce comes to mind. If you use onions for the sauce today, you are declared crazy. But the long history shows that the only really constant ingredient from the beginning of the 20th century until ten years ago was the onion. So: what is the right recipe?  \nSTANDARD: But why is that happening?\n\nGrandi: Cuisine is no longer part of our identity, it is our identity. Italians have no faith in the future, and that's why they invent a past. The one true Italian cuisine doesn't exist. It's the same with the Nonnas, the grandmothers. They can't cook as well as is always claimed. Grandmas can make two or three good dishes and that's it.\n\nSTANDARD: You're telling me the dear old Nonnas are fake?\n\nGrandi: When it comes to cooking, yes. They cook big meals on public holidays, but the rest of the year they cook badly and monotonously.\n\nSTANDARD: Nonnas are the experts for Italian food on social media.\n\nGrandi: Massimo Bottura, a very well-known chef, says he learnt everything from his nonna. That's completely impossible. The ingredients, the flavours, the cooking techniques that a nonna had at her disposal before the world wars are completely different to today. That's another legend.\n\nSTANDARD: What did people eat then if not pasta and pizza?\n\nGrandi: Until the First World War, pasta was only known in Naples. The rest of the Italians ate a lot of vegetables, soup and polenta. They cooked with chestnut flour and lard. So not the Mediterranean diet that we know. That is also an invention. Nobody ate like that.\n\nSTANDARD: Really?\n\nGrandi: If you look at southern Italy today, it is the region with the highest obesity rate. In the past, people ate badly and little, today they eat too much and too much.\n\nSTANDARD: Which true story of a dish surprised you the most?\n\nGrandi: Perhaps the strangest story is that of Parmigiano Reggiano. Parmesan has a very long history, almost 2000 years. During this time, the cheese has undergone many changes. In its original form - small, soft, greasy and black on the outside - it is produced in Wisconsin in the USA. Italian emigrants brought it with them. It was not until the 1960s that it was developed into its current form in Parma.  \nSTANDARD: So how did the terrible Italian food become the fantastic Italian food?\n\nGrandi: On the one hand, the great emigration of Italians between 1860 and 1960 was a factor. At that time, 25 million people left the country. Thanks to economic growth, some of them came back in the middle of the 20th century and brought with them dishes and recipes that are now sold as originals.\n\nSTANDARD: Which dishes would that be?\n\nGrandi: Pizza, for example. Pizza was invented in Naples, but it tasted awful. The dough was firm, burnt on the outside and still doughy on the inside. And without tomatoes. It was only thanks to the Italian diaspora that pizza was further developed and improved in the USA.\n\nSTANDARD: One of the most famous stories is that the pizza was created for Queen Margherita's visit and represents the colours of the Italian flag.\n\nGrandi: There is a document on which this story is written. It's a forgery. Pizza Margherita was only invented years after the Queen's death. She never ate it. What you find in Naples today is an American invention.\n\nSTANDARD: So the Americans put mozzarella and tomatoes on the pizza?  \nGrandi: Exactly. Tomato sauce is not Italian either. It comes from Spain. It only really became established after the Second World War. Tomato sauce is difficult to preserve. It needed industrialisation for that.\n\nSTANDARD: Is there any real traditional Italian food at all?\n\nGrandi: The worst word you can use for Italian cuisine is traditional. There is no culinary tradition.\n\nSTANDARD: You have falsified tomato sauce, parmesan, tiramisu and pizza. What about Bolognese?\n\nGrandi: Everyone makes Bolognese differently. There is no original recipe. Today, however, people say that Bolognese is cooked without tomatoes. But you can't prove that.\n\nSTANDARD: And carbonara?\n\nGrandi: Carbonara is a little different. Although it originated in Italy, it comes from the Americans. At the end of the Second World War, after the conquest of Rome, the soldiers combined their rations of egg powder and bacon with pasta. They called it \u2018spaghetti breakfast\u2019. So it didn't come from the charcoal burners in the Apennines, who prepared pasta with bacon and cheese during their break. Incidentally, the first recipe for carbonara was published in Chicago in 1952. Only two years later in Italy. And even that was different from the modern version. Gruy\u00e8re cheese, pancetta and garlic were used.\n\nSTANDARD: In Austria, carbonara is also cooked with whipped cream and ham.\n\nGrandi: Whipped cream was often used in carbonara recipes right up until the 1970s.\n\nSTANDARD: So our version is not a fake carbonara?\n\nGrandi: There is no such thing as a fake carbonara. Every recipe has its justification. But don't say that out loud when you're in Italy.\n\nSTANDARD: Let's go through the rest. What about olive oil?\n\nGrandi: That's a very strange story. Fifty years ago, olive oil was used for everything except cooking. For oil lamps, for example. It tasted very sour and very intense. It was unsuitable for food. Italians tended to cook with lard, butter or margarine. It wasn't until the 80s that the quality of the oil improved so that it could be used for cooking.\n\nSTANDARD: Pasta comes from China, doesn't it?\n\nGrandi: Yes and no. Pasta came into the country via Sicily through the Arabs. Pasta used to be eaten by hand and only mixed with garlic, fat and cheese.\n\nSTANDARD: Can you still go out to eat in your home country without being insulted?\n\nGrandi: (Laughs.) I don't know what it would be like in Naples, I haven't ventured there yet, but yes, I can still go out to eat.\n\nSTANDARD: What do you eat then?\n\nGrandi: Spaghetti with tomato sauce.  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1euaky0/historian_demolishes_italian_food_tradition_is/", "created_utc": 1723873781.0, "score": 537, "author": "Gulliveig", "num_comments": 170, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1euaky0/historian_demolishes_italian_food_tradition_is/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

It's a whole thing, and it would take way too long to explain why it's a relevant question in context, but suffice it to say, the sages of the time had a *lot* of opinions on the topic. The amount of time it takes to walk around a palm tree. The amount of time it takes to mix a glass of wine. The amount of time it takes to drink that glass of wine.\n\nAnd according to Ben Azzai: the amount of time it takes to roast an egg.\n\nI went grocery shopping a little later in the day, and I bought some eggs. When I got home it occurred to me that I actually have no idea how to roast an egg, let alone how long it takes, and double let alone how one might have roasted an egg \\~2000 years ago.

{"title": "how did medieval people handle such high fiber diets?", "selftext": "I'm going off memory here, so the details may be off, but I recall reading about medieval Scottish peasants living off a diet that was perhaps as high as 80% of caloric intake from oats alone.  This with a perhaps 3000+ calorie diet to accommodate the high physical workload.  Now I'll assume the majority of this would have been eaten as oatcakes, as to eat that amount of oatmeal would necessitate eating dozens of bowls given the decreased caloric density of an oat 'soup'.  Nonetheless, the fiber intake would be astronomical compared to contemporary standards.  I spent a year eating 900 calories worth of oats a day and felt absolutely awful every day, I never pushed through to 'adapted to this food.'  I don't believe I have any sensitivity to oats either, as I've experience the same phenomenon with many whole grains if eaten in excess, oats just seem particularly offensive given the higher soluble fiber to insoluble fiber ratio.  I experienced bloating, lower back pain, joint pain.  It felt like the minerals in my body were being chelated at a rate that I couldn't replace back.  During that year I attempted many ways to make it work, first an approach incorporating lots of foods that would have been common in the area, kale, blueberries, fish, or else very low fiber higher fat, cheese, eggs, lower fiber fruit.

I remember lots of heavy cream, sugar, cinnamon, beef tallow, and lard. I'm sure a little vanilla as well. I remember using a meat tenderizer hammer to make little holes all over the dough.

You ended up with a thin pastry with layer of thin dough, then thin layer of filling, and top layer of thin dough. All 3 layers were almost the same thickness.

The extent of the collection was never clear before her passing, so when two pallets arrived with 48\" cube cardboard containers on them packed to the gills with books, he was a little surprised. We managed to get all two tons of them boxed up and into storage. Six months later, he got a message from a sibling asking if he wanted more cookbooks, and puzzled, he replied he already got them. Oh, no, the sibling answered back, you got the EAST COAST collection. The California house had an additional ton and a half of cookbooks. They are now all consolidated in storage here in Washington State.  \n\n\nHe is obviously never going to cook all the recipes, and just statistically speaking, some of them are going to be crap (especially those from the 1960's and 70's that focus almost exclusively on suspending various foodstuffs in various flavors of gelatin), but many are fascinating snapshots on different periods of American history (most are mid-20th Century, but there are a few community cookbooks and \"housewive's helper\" type cookbooks from the late 1800's). Some are more like textbooks, going into technique more in-depth than most, while others are very clearly based on product advertising (offering 200 new and innovative ways to used canned soups in cooking, for example, or 101 baking recipes for X-brand flour, etc.)  \n\n\nIf I were to gently suggest he doesn't need to keep all those cookbooks, and may possibly not even have the ability to even display them all on bookshelves due to the sheer volume, does anyone know of any library or historical organization that would accept all or most of these cookbooks   en masse? I've done a little digging, but so far haven't found a place that would definitely accept all of these, and it would be a shame to not share this collection with the world.

This is a public project meaning anyone may submit.\n\n  \nThe objective of this project is to create a collaborative public-facing online archive that identifies largely unindexed examples of cookery marginalia so they may be indexed and accessed digitally as support of the presence and historical contributions of mothers, parents, homemakers, cooks, and others who labored within the home, for the benefit of the household. The examples collected and presented support histories of the private sphere of the historical American household between the 1700s and 1928.\n\n  \nHandwritten marginalia can be understood as writings found within the margins of documents. This project focuses on these handwritings found within commercially published historical American cookery texts. These marginalia can be in the forms of full recipes written within already published cookbooks, periodicals, and pamphlets. But it may also exist as corrections and alterations to published recipes, commentary and other notes surrounding recipe texts, illustrations, sketches and doodles around cookery text, and marks within cookery publications that denote the ownership or gifting of the texts and areas of emphasis and importance.\n\n  \nThis is an exercise in community critical making and public history; that is, learning and researching through the collaborative creation of things. I encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to this archive to submit examples of marginalia that you have found in American cookery publications from between 1700s and 1928. These could be found in your own personal collection, at a physical library, or from already digitized historical publications within other online archives that have not been indexed and are therefore not searchable.\n\n  \nIf you are interested in helping build the objects and collections within this archive by submitting examples you have found, please visit the below Qualtrics form.

{"title": "St. Louis Style Pizza and No Yeast Pizza Dough", "selftext": "A few years before the pandemic I started trying to make St. Louis style pizza at home. When you search online for St. Louis style pizza recipes you find a common theme of no yeast dough recipes. The only recipe I found for St. Louis style pizza using yeast was in Tony Gemignani's book The Pizza Bible and that recipe isn't something one can find online.\n\nI've eaten many St. Louis style pizzas from multiple St. Louis style pizzerias and I've made several St. Louis style no yeast dough recipes. None of the no yeast dough recipes tasted even remotely like what I was actually eating from St. Louis style pizzerias.\n\nAfter doing some more searching I was able to find a website called Lost Tables https://losttables.com/pizzerias/pizzerias.htm that lists the history of pizza in St. Louis. In 1947 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote a small article about the first pizzeria in the city and noted that the yeasted pizza dough was rolled out, topped with tomato sauce and Provolone cheese, and cut into squares. This sounds, more or less, the same style of pizza we are eating in St. Louis over 75 years later. The exception being the change from Provolone cheese to Provel cheese.\n\nThis led me to start making phone calls and Facebook messaging St. Louis style pizzerias to get a head count of who is using yeast and who isn't. After over two dozen phone calls and several Facebook messages I found that every pizzeria was using yeast. Including the largest St. Louis style chain pizzeria Imo's. During my search I was also able to acquire some whole and partial recipes that the pizzerias were using, or used at some point in the cases of the pizzeria no longer being in operation, and all of them used yeast. I also couldn't find a single example of any pizzeria in St. Louis ever not using yeast.\n\nAfter trying the yeast dough recipes my search for real St. Louis style pizza dough was over. They tasted great and were exactly what I was getting from pizzerias in St. Louis.\n\nOne thing that I couldn't find that I really wanted to was when did this no yeast dough start being associated with St. Louis style pizza? As far as I can find it didn't come out of a pizzeria and after speaking to friends, family, co-workers, and random people online it doesn't seem to be a traditional St. Louis way to make pizza at home either. The no yeast pizza dough recipes also seem to be coming exclusively from people not from St. Louis as well.\n\nMy questions to you fine folks is does anyone know the history of no yeast pizza doughs, how did this type of pizza dough become associated with St. Louis, or does anyone know of any resources I could use to try to continue my search into where this association came from?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1bit0le/st_louis_style_pizza_and_no_yeast_pizza_dough/", "created_utc": 1710876824.0, "score": 11, "author": "HouseofProvel", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1bit0le/st_louis_style_pizza_and_no_yeast_pizza_dough/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The first being somewhat a general history of food, and how it is interwoven with a society, is shaped by and shapes a society (e.g., communal vs small group/individual meals, transportable food making exploration possible, etc.).\n\nThe second built on the first and covered the usage of food in diplomacy. Effectively, all cultures eat, so food is a common cultural language. Probably, the most commonly known example of this is the story of the first thanksgiving. This section also covered the gradual adoption of other cultures by the powerful of a state put pressure on governments to lean towards one or another. The ultimate extension of the food diplomacy being you get your target culture to want to have good ties with you because they feel they know you. \n\nThe last section then covered the spread of these foods into society and how as we reached the modern day the food and recipes have changed. Covering things like pepper used to be worth more than gold and now it is commonplace, refrigeration affected our approach to spices. A touch on capitalist cultural colonization being an independent topic but effectively being an offshoot of this. Then finishing on foods/recipies that were transmittted some we have forgotten the origin, some falsely attributed the origin, and some bastardized the food itself. It was talking about foods like tikka masala, chop suey, American pizza, forgetting katsu was inspired by schnitzel. If memory serves fully the last last bit was basically a call to action that we can fulfil the diplomatic origins and embrace our shared foods and growth together or argue over how something is supposed to be made. Have food diplomacy 2.0. \n\nIf memory serves, it was written by an academic but in an approachable, accessible style. I think it was about 180-200pages. It was much more detailed and better written than I am doing justice here. I think it was published post 2010, and from what I remember it would most likely have been written no earlier than 2000. I don\u2019t seem to remember any references to the GWOT but there was an assumption the audience was somewhat familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine and the East West trade routes and some reference to Afghanistan being as dangerous then as it is now. \n\nHopefully someone knows this book.

{"title": "2024 State of the sub", "selftext": "Hello everyone and welcome to our brand new traditional yearly state of the sub post! It's been a year of great growth, many interesting questions and delightful answers from our users. So before anything else, we want to thank you for making this sub a place where friendly humans exchange knowledge about that most human of passions - food! \n\n\nWhen we said 2023 had seen growth, we weren't kidding, Our end of year monthly unique views were almost four times the uniques views we we had in january; Our pageviews went from around 75K per month in the begining of the year to almost 225K in december! Overall, we're up 366K views over the previous year, up 14.9K uniques over the previous year and now have a whopping 10K subcribers, doubling our numbers from 2022! So a great big welcome to all our new friends, we hope you'll feel at home here!\n\nWith great growth comes greater workload and our fearless leader /u/ryguy_1 is, despite being a reddit mod, trying to have a life. With the new year, he took stock and noticed some trends, globally, numbers were up which was a good thing but more worryingly many threads were becoming filled with unsubstantied arguments, guidelines were routinely ignored and even more worrying, there was wanton abuse of reddit's self harm report option as a disagree button. Feeling that this was getting to be a little much to handle on his own, he resolved to ask the sub's population for volunteers and from all the applicants, ~~six sacrificial victims~~ lucky winners were selected. Please welcome our new assisitant librarians and be kind to them as they grapple with the awesome powers of their ascent to godhood. \n\nFor the benefit of those who are new around here, we'd like to go over the posting guidelies and what they mean to us.\n\n \nGuideline 1\n\n**Questions must be of a historical nature.**\n\nWe will be happy to answer questions that have a strong historical component, such as [this delightful gem  offered to us by /u/SingapoeranSloth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/18xbuqc/mysterious_world_war_2_canned_beef_stew_is/) but we won't be competent  to deal with more current food questions which can be handled by less history focused subs like /r/AskCulinary or with history questions that aren't about food, these should go to /r/AskHistorians.\n\n\nGuideline 2\n\n**Post specific questions**\n\nThat one shouldn't be a problem, don't post open ended questions, the more specific you are, the better we will be able to help you. Of course, if you need help crafting a question, we'll be delighted to assist.\n\nGuideline 3\n\n**If you have more than one unrelated question, post it in a new post.**\n\nAs above, that one is pretty much self explanatory, Reddit is a chaotic enough place as it is, no need to make it worse. The search function is pretty bad as it is, let's not make it worse.\n\nGuideline 4\n\n**Post credible links and citations when possible**\n\nThis guideline has raised much debate amongst the mods as to how it should be interpreted, we're not going to require every answer to have a linked source but request that one be previded if asked. We recognize that some knowledge may be from oral history or be the result of 'secrets' passed down in a familly or a workplace, so not everything can be definitely sourced but very many things can and should be sourced.\n\n\nGuideline 5\n\n**Answers must be on topic. Food history can often lead to discussions of aspects of history/culture/religion et.c that may expand beyond the original question. This is normal, but please keep try to keep it relevant to the question asked or the answer you are trying to give.**\n\nSimply put, all top level comments must either attempt to answer the question asked or seek to clarify its context. Violators will be removed.  Digression in the lower comments will be tolerated so long as all other rules are respected.\n\nGuideline 6\n\n**Be friendly!**\n\nWe're not here to fight, if you are you will not be welcome very long. It is perfectly healthy to disagree, but arguments should be supported with facts and never descend to the personal level. Name calling is obviously out as is any type of hate speech. Abuse of reddit's self harm report button will result in a ban, mental health is not a joke.\n\nGuideline 7\n\n**Enjoy!**\n\nUnless /r/Transhumanism has broken new ground recently, we don't believe we have in our power to compel your enjoyment, but we do very much hope you enjoy this sub's content. Should be there be things you do not enjoy and wish to discuss, we are creating a META tag for posts about the sub's rules and infrastructure such as this one where comments are open. We greatly look forward to your thoughts and ideas on how to improve this sub.\n\n\t\n\nWe wish you a fascinating 2024.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/19ce2lm/2024_state_of_the_sub/", "created_utc": 1705871891.0, "score": 26, "author": "an0nim0us101", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/19ce2lm/2024_state_of_the_sub/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Mysterious World War 2 Canned Beef Stew, Is Something Similar Or Identical Available Today? Or If Not A Recipe?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm here with a World War 2 culinary mystery! I made a post on r/RBI, since they helped me solve another World War 2 culinary mystery, but my latest post there doesn't seem to have gotten as much traction or any useful answers, unlike my last one. So, I've been talking to my Grandma, who, as I explained in my last post, lived through the Japanese Occupation of Singapore as a young girl. Those were some very difficult times, not least because of severe food shortages, which led to quite a few... unusual recipes of necessity being used to survive. However, unlike the mysterious bread (which I should note, that subreddit seems to have solved), my Grandma actually *likes* this mysterious food, and has fond memories of eating it, so we'd like to see if it's still available today (ideally, the exact same brand and packaging, if not, just the same dish, and canned), or at least a recipe, so she, her children and grandchildren can enjoy a *happier* taste of her wartime childhood\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll describe what the mysterious canned beef stew was, and all the clues my Grandma can remember about it:\n\n-It was labelled \"Braised Beef With Soya Beans\"\n\n-It actually did contain beef, cubed and braised (in a cut similar to brisket, but somewhat less fatty), in a stew that was tomato-y, along with possibly soy sauce (this one seems a bit odd to me, more likely some other kind of salty brown sauce?), and soya beans (she is 100% certain they were soya beans, not any other kind of beans and were whitish/very pale brown in colour)\n\n-It came in a can that was cylindrical, similar in dimensions to a Campbell soup can, with a yellowish orange label (she is 100% on the shape, less certain on the labelling, but still fairly certain)\n\n-She is 100% certain that labelling on the cans was in English (I think this is a major clue)\n\n-The cans were only available for the first 9 months or so of the occupation. They were taken from bunkers, fighting positions, personal equipment (webbing and haversacks) and warehouses on military bases abandoned by British Army soldiers when they evacuated or surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army. She is 100% certain that they were British Army issue (at least in Malaya). Taken cans were then available for a short period of time, before they ran out, so we can rule out anything produced by Imperial Japan (I think this is another major clue)\n\n-She is less certain of this, but she seems to have a vague recollection that the cans were marked \"Made in...\" with the country of origin being somewhere in South America. She has explicitly ruled out Canada and Australia as possible origins (I think this clue at least gives us an idea of what sort of cuisines we should be looking at)\n\n-Unlike most of the wartime food she ate, they were delicious! She's been wanting to try some again for decades now!\n\nSo what we'd like to know is whether they're still available today, and from where (since she's never seen it in a supermarket anywhere in the country, it'll likely have to be bought online). Ideally we'd want the *exact* same brand (hopefully the packaging hasn't changed), if not, another brand of the same dish, canned would be good too. If cans of this dish are no longer produced, we'll happily go for a recipe too. If anyone can find a picture of the wartime cans (hoping some expert on British Army rations will know what she's talking about), so we can confirm if that's it, that'd be great too! :)\n\nEdit: spelling", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/18xbuqc/mysterious_world_war_2_canned_beef_stew_is/", "created_utc": 1704260720.0, "score": 14, "author": "SingaporeanSloth", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/18xbuqc/mysterious_world_war_2_canned_beef_stew_is/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "The Mythology of Yeast", "selftext": "I'm currently trying to recreate a traditional ale barm so I can make an early 1600s recipe for Samhain \"soul cakes.\"\n\nIt has me wondering what people thought about yeast's origins before society discovered it was a microorganism. A sourdough starter, for example, is just a small amount of flour with water (and sometimes honey) that was left out and tended daily until it \"miraculously\" produced the fermentation one was looking for. Sometimes, the starter spoiled instead. Other times, the particular strain of natural yeast captured had an unpleasant flavor profile, while other attempts tasted just right, and all these complex outcomes would have felt fairly unpredictable to historical bakers.\n\nAdditionally, the weather, global location, and season during which one captured wild yeast had a tremendous impact on the success of the process, with it being harder to achieve in winter. I believe there were even a few years in medieval Europe when the temperatures were so far below average that the wild yeast went dormant and its successful capture virtually disappeared, causing most attempts at fermentation to fail during that time.\n\nWith yeast seemingly coming from the aether, and it's collection heavily dependent on both one's technique and simple luck, there must be a rich culture of anecdotes, rituals, folklore, lingo, idioms, and religious superstition around yeast and its use.\n\nWhat did the average person believe about yeast, where it came from, and what it actually was? How did the fickleness of yeast influence kitchen and beer-making culture? What antiquated terms are unique to this mystery process? I can imagine how yeast, more than most things in the kitchen, might seem a bit like magic.\n\nAnyway, I know this is a massive question spanning most of known human history, so I'm mostly curious if anyone has a favorite story or historical fact about this issue, as well as any historical resources/books I could check out myself.

{"title": "Is it true that food in an unopened container in a landfill (such as hotdogs sealed in the same package from its supermarket life) can survive over 20 years without decomposition? If so, why don't we have any historical foods surviving from centuries ago in air sealed containers?", "selftext": "Yesteday I helped my aunt prepare and store food to be used in my dad's promotion to Colonel in the National Guard Airforce (which took place today). As we were clearing the van before we stored food, my auntie found a bunch package of Chinese meatbuns (the white kind that with soft smooth texture that often comes with a paper sticker under them). My aunt was like \"I bought those 4 months ago and couldn't find it!\". We sadly had to throw it since its obviously now bad. But there was something peculiar about it. Despite being under the hot sun in a vehicle for the whole summer, it did not melt into a liquid pile of goo. Not only that, there was no sign of mould or discoloration and ohter associated things with food spoilage. From what I could smell of it from outside the sealed bag , it did not smell bad at all but had the smell so associated with that kind of white bread the Chinese use for their native cake and bread products. I could not smell the meat inside but the fact I couldn't detect anything typically like rotting meat amazed me so much.\n\nThis reminds me of a project I did in middle school where we had to research stuff related to trash and waste management. Is tumbled upon an article from a major news paper (can't remember the name but its a big brand name in the same league as say New York Times and People Magazine). It said something about unopened hot dog still in their plastic sealed containers being found in landfills from 20 years ago looking like in new considtion without discoloration nor did it have a strong scent that should have been apparent because of being refigerated so long even if its in a unopened package. The article emphasized that along with being in factory condition package, since it was in a garbage bag and hidden so long deep in over 50 feet high of a pile of trrash, it could not get oxygen and thus failed to decompose because no microbes were interating with the food.\n\nThe article was written around 1987 meaning that the aforementioned hotdogs and other trash it was commenting on would have been produced in the 1960s decade, To this day I still could not believe the article's claims despite being written by some big name professor or scientist (might have been both) who's in the field of evironmentalist and was doing some project for a university at the time the article was published..........\n\nBut seeing the Chinese meat buns not change at all despite being unrefigrated and outdoors during the hot summers (in even hotter temperature because it was stuck inside a car trunk the whole time) reminded me about that article.......\n\nNow the first major question since I cannot believe it. Is this all possible that sealed food thrown into the center of a bunch of garbage would not be able to composee due to lack of oxygen and in turn lack of germs and other invisible tiny living things especially if its been thrown inside a tied plastic bag ortrash bag or something similar? I still am having difficulty beleiving this is actually real. Now the second question, how long until the food getst ot the point of disappearing? 6 centuries? A thousand years? 3 milennias? A whole eon of a million years or more? Now last and most of all, if food can survive so long without decomposition for decades, how come we don't have easily perishable food from the mid 1800s or even from World War 1 in a surviving state? Sealing food in a cloth, paper, ardboard, wooden box, and even modern day plastic wrapper seal has been in eistence since the late 19th century. Furthermore landfills were already a thing after the Industrial Revolution with places like N the Northern states having problems with running out of space in some ities and towns because of the heaps of trash piling up already shortly after the American Civil War. Landfills just became more and more as technology advanced before World War 1 at the even of the 1900s. The existing amount of open lands being used to pile more and more trash has boosted up even further after WWII. So I'm wondering why don't we have surviving ground beef hidden in a trash pile in Germany thats been wrapped in a cylander plastic dated container dated from 1922 hidden in some landfill in operation for 90s years? Why aren't there some ancient sausage linked wrapped in paper cloth in early trashbags in a landfill thats been in operation since 1879? Since piels of trash limit oxygen and can cause hotdogs to survive so long for decades, not to mention the Chinese meatbuns in my Auntie's trunks surviving one whole hot summer without decaying into a different state, why don't we have surviving food especially whose in plastic air sealed wraps from the 19th and early 20th centuries in very old landfills?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16ejzsa/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "created_utc": 1694301255.0, "score": 27, "author": "CamelIllustrations", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16ejzsa/is_it_true_that_food_in_an_unopened_container_in/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Why do some countries have \u201cbad food\u201d?", "selftext": "I know that these kind of questions are usually refuted by naming traditional dishes of the country that was considered to have bad food. I would generally agree with this sentiment. From what I\u2019ve seen, countries generally have tasty dishes that those country\u2019s people enjoy.\n\nThat being said, the statement that some countries have bad food still seems true to me. I grew up in Germany, which has very enjoyable (albeit often also very hearty) regional dishes. I would still say that Germany has bad food or a bad food culture (not even factoring in health). The general sentiment in the population is that food needs to be filling and cheap. Therefore, restaurants often offer mediocre quality and use a lot of pre-made and instant ingredients to keep prices low. There seems to be no real appreciation for quality in food. Regional dishes are often known to be of low quality in restaurants (e.g. K\u00e4ssp\u00e4tzle in Swabia) and only made in good quality at home. High quality restaurants will mostly cook french inspired food instead of refining local dishes.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to France where food is celebrated much more. Local dishes are made very well in restaurants and taste is rated over quantity. This goes for so many things, like pastries, wine, etc. While Germany has excellent examples of all of these, the average quality is considerably lower.\n\nAn argument that I\u2019ve often read is that countries with bad food have had less varied produce historically. This seems to be correlated, since in Europe for example, southern countries are often considered to have good food and northern not so much. This argument is not satisfying to me, since from my experience all countries have enjoyable dishes to some extent.\n\nAre there historical/cultural explanations for the way food and food quality is appreciated in different countries?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16bdndp/why_do_some_countries_have_bad_food/", "created_utc": 1693985268.0, "score": 111, "author": "Comfortable-Incident", "num_comments": 71, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16bdndp/why_do_some_countries_have_bad_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Berbere or Amazigh seasoning? (Name question)", "selftext": "Hello :) This question has been on my mind for a bit and I wanted to see if someone here could help me understand. So I've had Ethiopian dishes before such as doro wat which heavily feature the spice blend I've always known as Berbere seasoning. When I looked up the history of this blend it said that it is native to Ethiopia and Eritrea and was invented through traders bringing in new spices to Ethiopia from Asia across the Indian Ocean.\n\nI also know that \"Berber\" is an exonym referring to different ethnic groups native to the Maghreb region of Northwest Africa. This word has been replaced by \"Amazigh\" in a lot of contexts because berber is considered derogatory and has roots in the word \"barbarian\".\n\nNow, the other day I was shopping at a spice store in Pittsburgh and I asked for Berbere seasoning and the guy said they had it but that they were now calling it Amazigh seasoning so as not to use the offensive word.\n\nI just corrected myself and didn't ask about it more but now I'm confused. Why is a spice from Ethiopia named after ethnic groups in a completely different part of the continent? Is there a shared etymological root between the so-called \"Berber\" peoples and \"Berbere\" seasoning? I read something that said yes, but I also read something saying the name of the spice comes from \"papare\" the old Ge'ez (ancient Ethiopian language) word for pepper. In which case calling it Amazigh seasoning could be a complete misnomer. As far as I can tell from reading, the Amazigh peoples of North Africa do not have a connection to the Berbere seasoning from Ethiopia. So I'm confused why it would be named after them. I'm not from any of these places so I can't say what names are appropriate or politically correct. But I thought maybe someone here could help me understand this.\n\nhttps://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/amazigh-seasoning-blend/c-24/p-155/pd-s\n\nBtw here's the link to the store I was referring to. ^ They seem to be the only place I could find calling it Amazigh seasoning. It also seems to be the same as the Ethiopian blend I am familiar with but on their website they call it North African.

Spices in Europe pre-global trade were expensive, reserved for the rich.  As spices got easer to get, they got cheaper, more people used them and so on.  \n\nRecently I heard of a sort of counter-culture movement, in which once the poors got ahold of spices, rich people stopped spicing their food.  Claimed that because their meats and veg were so high quality they did not need such adulteration or something. \n\nNow I recently got into looking at recipes from the 18th into the 20th centuries, and while I know that's a long period, I see tons of use and mention of things like pepper, sage, mint, red pepper, etc.  It seems like people were seasoning their food any way they could, rich or poor.  Which leads me to today.  It seems like everyone from the ancient romans onward knew if you shoved a few leaves or dried bits of this and that it made things taste better.  Colonized and enslaved peoples brought with them use of spices and peppers, which eventually made their way through the foods everyone was eating. \n\nWhy is there such an insistence that American and British foods in particular, suffer from not having any spice in them, when I am seeing colonial recipes that call for pepper and herbs galore and 19th century recipes that call for all sorts of mixins and fixins.

Not to forget that, unlike pigs and sheep, it would be difficult to confine cattle herd in a barn during the winter time.\nSure, people had cows. However, it was bred for its milk, not necessarily to slaughter in order to obtain its meat. Perhaps that's the reason ( or one of the reasons) why there are few beef dishes in many European and Asian cuisines compared to pork, lamb, poultry and seafood.\nI guess another aspect of why the high consumption of meat is so recent is that only a few countries have the \"geographical\" luck of having enough plain land that is appropriate for breeding cattle in a large scale, in which can include countries like the US, Brazil, Australia, Argentina, etc. One curious fact is that these countries are former colonies, in which had other functions and activities during its colonial time and would start a beef production long after their respective independences.

And shoabing, a baked bread, has been in China for about 2000 years already, so now I'm not even sure the steamed buns are China's ur-bread.

{"title": "The first dinner of Arthur Rimbaud in Paris - Total Eclipse (1995)", "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am a Brazilian who is passionate about Arthur Rimbaud and French culture.\n\nI would like to know if this dish seen in the 1995 film \"Total Eclipse\", which portrays the poet's relationship with Paul Verlaine, fits into a traditional French dish, based on its visual aspect. I would like to know if there is anything more specific besides \"a simple soup made of whatever ingredients can be seen.\"\n\nBelow is some information that may help to clarify the matter. I am providing it thinking about the possibility that the production team had access to this information, regardless of whether it was used for any special purpose or not. This is because Christopher Hampton, the screenwriter of the original play and the film of the same name, demonstrates in his script that he has great knowledge about Rimbaud's life, providing details that do not appear in the final version of the film.\n\nWHERE: The scene takes place in the dining room on the ground floor of Mr. Maut\u00e9, located at 14 Rue Nicolet, Montmartre, in Paris.\n\nWHEN: This is the first night Rimbaud spent in Paris. He arrived in the city on the afternoon of September 24, 1871, a Sunday. Some biographies describe the weather in the capital as being quite pleasant that afternoon.\n\nSome important details about the characters that may also help:\n\n\\- The house did not belong to Paul Verlaine, the girl's husband and the person who had invited Rimbaud and paid for his one-way ticket, but to Theodore de Maut\u00e9, Verlaine's father-in-law.\n\n\\- No matter how kind the host family may have been, Rimbaud certainly did not receive a special dinner. Firstly, because he was not expected by everyone, and secondly, because of the way he arrived:\n\n1. Rimbaud left Verlaine waiting for him at the train station and set off alone in search of the poet's house. Therefore, he arrived at the house without him, alone, in the afternoon. He arrived without suitcases, looking unkempt and not at all concerned with making a good impression. When Verlaine and Charles Cros (not shown in the film) arrived home discouraged and did not find the young man at the station, they were shocked to see him already there.\n2. The biographies also say that Rimbaud's mother-in-law, Antoinette-Flore Chariat, was only informed about who the young man was when he arrived and, besides her husband, she, Mathilde, seemed to be the only one who knew about his arrival. Mr. Maut\u00e9, on the other hand, was away from home, hunting, and could not even imagine that his son-in-law was using his house to host someone, since he himself, in his father-in-law's opinion, should not be there. So much so that Rimbaud had to be hidden in a hurry as soon as he returned from hunting.\n3. Despite coming from an economically stable family, the fact that he was a young man from the countryside, with bad habits and depending on help to establish himself in Paris (Verlaine paid for his third-class train ticket) placed Rimbaud several notches below the social position occupied by the Maut\u00e9 family.\n\nAll this to say: there is nothing to suggest that this dinner was anything other than a typical Sunday dinner for a good family living in the Montmarte neighborhood in the early 1870s in Paris.\n\nAny guesses based on his visual appearance?  \nThank you!\n\n[Le premier d\u00eener - Total Eclipse (1995)](https://youtu.be/E1YCdKj5lbQ)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hso6s8/the_first_dinner_of_arthur_rimbaud_in_paris_total/", "created_utc": 1735916021.0, "score": 5, "author": "CurrentScore3146", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1hso6s8/the_first_dinner_of_arthur_rimbaud_in_paris_total/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Is there a reason why the Japanese cuisine tends to be less spicy than in other countries in the area?", "selftext": "Most local cuisines across China, Korea, southern and southeastern Asia feature a great deal of spiciness through liberal use of ingredients such as black pepper, chili pepper, tumeric, garlic, and other similar strong flavours. Japanese cuisine on the other hand tends to be more \"delicate\" and \"balanced\" by our western standards (one might say umami?). Ingredients like wasabi or soy sauce are generally only used in moderation to add that little extra touch. I was wondering why that is - I read that one of the reasons why spicy food is so common is because it would make you sweat and therefore fight the humid heat, but Japan is also quite humid.\n\nEDIT a possibly misguided theory I came up with is that the modern Japanese cuisine, much like the French one, is a result of central efforts at codifications which favour dishes where all flavours are balanced and identifiable, as opposed to the cuisine from other places which is more practical and reflects the habits of \"the people\".", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1gkc7wl/is_there_a_reason_why_the_japanese_cuisine_tends/", "created_utc": 1730827891.0, "score": 245, "author": "slicheliche", "num_comments": 63, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1gkc7wl/is_there_a_reason_why_the_japanese_cuisine_tends/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

They may not be mainstream and indeed these countries have a tradition of taboo dog meat because the populace sees dog as disgusting to cook and eat, but somehow subcultures and regions even in these countries have it thriving enough to at least have a big feast and some small places in these countries' outskirt may even eat dog daily (despite the main nations' culture being anti-dog meat).\n\nConsidering all of Japan's nearby neighbor across the East Asian stratosphere still have restaurants that openly sell cook dog without facing controversy, how come Japan never went this path? I mean I wouldn't be surprised if there are Yakuza and other criminal groups who engage in a black market dog trade with something like a small isolated mountain community of less than 100 does eat dog and maybe a household in the forest regions eat dog secretly........ But an entire subculture or even regions of over 200+ people (often reaching thousands as Indonesia and Philippines) people eating it for a yearly delicacy?

All salt went through government agencies. I think this is very similar to alcohol and tobacco in Canada. They then made exclusive deals with land locked cities, creating what is now know as Venetian salt contract.\n\nWith money in the bank, Venice flourished. It became a leading port, and businesses and reach expanded along with the range of goods traded. With all the money it was generating from regulation, Venice could develop its infrastructure.\n\nTill this time, there was no records of a state or government so dependant on Salt, except for China.

{"title": "Historian demolishes \"Italian food tradition\", is this just marketing?", "selftext": "The Austrian Standard just published an interview with historian Alberto Grandi in which \"Italian food tradition\" is pretty much demolished.\n\nWhile it's understood that \"tradition\" always is fabricated to a certain extent, I as a mod of a food-related sub would be very much interested on *food historians'* take on this interview, in particular whether this is just marketing in order to sell his book about that topic.\n\nSource (in German): https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000232054/historiker-die-italienische-kueche-ist-nichts-anderes-als-marketing\n\nTranslation from German into English via DeepL:\n\n\\---\n\n**Historian: \u2018Italian cuisine is nothing more than marketing\u2019**\n\n*When we think of Italy, we immediately think of pasta, pizza and other delicious food. Specialities such as Neapolitan margherita or Roman carbonara have become as legendary as the Colosseum, the Amalfi Coast and Pompeii. Italian cuisine has long since developed a cult following. People refer to alleged original recipes from the times of the Medici dynasty or which originate from poor shepherds in the Apennines. Deviations from these recipes are met with veritable shitstorms on social media.*\n\n*Cucina italiana, the traditional cuisine, is not to be trifled with. Historian Alberto Grandi is particularly annoyed by this glorification of food. That's why he researched the true history of the origins of Italian dishes. What did he find out? Everything is fake. The carbonara, the origin stories, even the culinary figure of the nonna. In his book* Mythos Nationalgericht*, he claims that Italy's famous cuisine only developed after the Second World War.*\n\nSTANDARD: In some articles about your book, you are described as the \u2018destroyer of Italian cuisine\u2019. Is that true?\n\nGrandi: I'm not destroying it, I'm telling a different kind of story about Italian cuisine.\n\nSTANDARD: What is that?\n\nGrandi: We have simply invented a lot of recipes and stories over the last 50 years. There is an excess of myths and legends surrounding Italian cuisine. It's nothing more than marketing. \n\nSTANDARD: So when I read that tiramisu originated from a dish in the 17th century and was eaten by the de Medici family, that's a fairy tale?\n\nGrandi: Yes, it's marketing. There's nothing reprehensible about it. Marketing is there to sell products. Tiramisu could only have been invented in the 60s or 70s. Mascarpone requires refrigeration to produce and was not available to everyone. It only became possible with the development of supermarkets. My mum is now 90. 50 years ago, mascarpone was an absolute novelty for her.\n\nSTANDARD: Why do you have a problem with the way stories about food are passed on?  \nGrandi: Food has such an enormous significance in our culture. And I find that strange. As a historian, I find it difficult that food is now the most important aspect of identity for Italians. I find that dangerous. Just this morning I was discussing this with a friend. He said that everything in Italy depends on tourism and food. That is not true. 90 per cent of Italy's GDP cannot be attributed to tourism. The reactions to my work show that many Italians are unaware of the economic and social reality of our country.\n\nSTANDARD: Food is an emotional topic. Just when it comes to preparing a dish \u2018properly\u2019. For many people, carbonara can only be made with guanciale and pecorino.\n\nGrandi: Ten or 15 years ago, Gualtiero Marchesi, one of the most important Italian chefs, added whipped cream to carbonara. Today, people would go crazy over it. Carbonara is not a recipe, it's a religion. A Roman journalist once threatened me with a beating because of such statements in my book.\n\nSTANDARD: Is there such a thing? A right or wrong?\n\nGrandi: The story of the Amatriciana sauce comes to mind. If you use onions for the sauce today, you are declared crazy. But the long history shows that the only really constant ingredient from the beginning of the 20th century until ten years ago was the onion. So: what is the right recipe?  \nSTANDARD: But why is that happening?\n\nGrandi: Cuisine is no longer part of our identity, it is our identity. Italians have no faith in the future, and that's why they invent a past. The one true Italian cuisine doesn't exist. It's the same with the Nonnas, the grandmothers. They can't cook as well as is always claimed. Grandmas can make two or three good dishes and that's it.\n\nSTANDARD: You're telling me the dear old Nonnas are fake?\n\nGrandi: When it comes to cooking, yes. They cook big meals on public holidays, but the rest of the year they cook badly and monotonously.\n\nSTANDARD: Nonnas are the experts for Italian food on social media.\n\nGrandi: Massimo Bottura, a very well-known chef, says he learnt everything from his nonna. That's completely impossible. The ingredients, the flavours, the cooking techniques that a nonna had at her disposal before the world wars are completely different to today. That's another legend.\n\nSTANDARD: What did people eat then if not pasta and pizza?\n\nGrandi: Until the First World War, pasta was only known in Naples. The rest of the Italians ate a lot of vegetables, soup and polenta. They cooked with chestnut flour and lard. So not the Mediterranean diet that we know. That is also an invention. Nobody ate like that.\n\nSTANDARD: Really?\n\nGrandi: If you look at southern Italy today, it is the region with the highest obesity rate. In the past, people ate badly and little, today they eat too much and too much.\n\nSTANDARD: Which true story of a dish surprised you the most?\n\nGrandi: Perhaps the strangest story is that of Parmigiano Reggiano. Parmesan has a very long history, almost 2000 years. During this time, the cheese has undergone many changes. In its original form - small, soft, greasy and black on the outside - it is produced in Wisconsin in the USA. Italian emigrants brought it with them. It was not until the 1960s that it was developed into its current form in Parma.  \nSTANDARD: So how did the terrible Italian food become the fantastic Italian food?\n\nGrandi: On the one hand, the great emigration of Italians between 1860 and 1960 was a factor. At that time, 25 million people left the country. Thanks to economic growth, some of them came back in the middle of the 20th century and brought with them dishes and recipes that are now sold as originals.\n\nSTANDARD: Which dishes would that be?\n\nGrandi: Pizza, for example. Pizza was invented in Naples, but it tasted awful. The dough was firm, burnt on the outside and still doughy on the inside. And without tomatoes. It was only thanks to the Italian diaspora that pizza was further developed and improved in the USA.\n\nSTANDARD: One of the most famous stories is that the pizza was created for Queen Margherita's visit and represents the colours of the Italian flag.\n\nGrandi: There is a document on which this story is written. It's a forgery. Pizza Margherita was only invented years after the Queen's death. She never ate it. What you find in Naples today is an American invention.\n\nSTANDARD: So the Americans put mozzarella and tomatoes on the pizza?  \nGrandi: Exactly. Tomato sauce is not Italian either. It comes from Spain. It only really became established after the Second World War. Tomato sauce is difficult to preserve. It needed industrialisation for that.\n\nSTANDARD: Is there any real traditional Italian food at all?\n\nGrandi: The worst word you can use for Italian cuisine is traditional. There is no culinary tradition.\n\nSTANDARD: You have falsified tomato sauce, parmesan, tiramisu and pizza. What about Bolognese?\n\nGrandi: Everyone makes Bolognese differently. There is no original recipe. Today, however, people say that Bolognese is cooked without tomatoes. But you can't prove that.\n\nSTANDARD: And carbonara?\n\nGrandi: Carbonara is a little different. Although it originated in Italy, it comes from the Americans. At the end of the Second World War, after the conquest of Rome, the soldiers combined their rations of egg powder and bacon with pasta. They called it \u2018spaghetti breakfast\u2019. So it didn't come from the charcoal burners in the Apennines, who prepared pasta with bacon and cheese during their break. Incidentally, the first recipe for carbonara was published in Chicago in 1952. Only two years later in Italy. And even that was different from the modern version. Gruy\u00e8re cheese, pancetta and garlic were used.\n\nSTANDARD: In Austria, carbonara is also cooked with whipped cream and ham.\n\nGrandi: Whipped cream was often used in carbonara recipes right up until the 1970s.\n\nSTANDARD: So our version is not a fake carbonara?\n\nGrandi: There is no such thing as a fake carbonara. Every recipe has its justification. But don't say that out loud when you're in Italy.\n\nSTANDARD: Let's go through the rest. What about olive oil?\n\nGrandi: That's a very strange story. Fifty years ago, olive oil was used for everything except cooking. For oil lamps, for example. It tasted very sour and very intense. It was unsuitable for food. Italians tended to cook with lard, butter or margarine. It wasn't until the 80s that the quality of the oil improved so that it could be used for cooking.\n\nSTANDARD: Pasta comes from China, doesn't it?\n\nGrandi: Yes and no. Pasta came into the country via Sicily through the Arabs. Pasta used to be eaten by hand and only mixed with garlic, fat and cheese.\n\nSTANDARD: Can you still go out to eat in your home country without being insulted?\n\nGrandi: (Laughs.) I don't know what it would be like in Naples, I haven't ventured there yet, but yes, I can still go out to eat.\n\nSTANDARD: What do you eat then?\n\nGrandi: Spaghetti with tomato sauce.  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1euaky0/historian_demolishes_italian_food_tradition_is/", "created_utc": 1723873781.0, "score": 535, "author": "Gulliveig", "num_comments": 170, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1euaky0/historian_demolishes_italian_food_tradition_is/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Or how long it takes to *start* having sex, possibly. It's a whole thing, and it would take way too long to explain why it's a relevant question in context, but suffice it to say, the sages of the time had a *lot* of opinions on the topic. The amount of time it takes to walk around a palm tree. The amount of time it takes to mix a glass of wine. The amount of time it takes to drink that glass of wine.\n\nAnd according to Ben Azzai: the amount of time it takes to roast an egg.\n\nI went grocery shopping a little later in the day, and I bought some eggs. When I got home it occurred to me that I actually have no idea how to roast an egg, let alone how long it takes, and double let alone how one might have roasted an egg \\~2000 years ago. Of course we have roasted eggs as part of the Passover seder, but I believe most people boil those before roasting them (and I'm quite sure that's what my mom did).

But I literally have never seen anything even close to how she made it. Everything is a pie, or cake, or custard,  fruit on top, etc. This tasted like those, but very different. I remember she would roll dough out very thin. I don't think it had yeast as it didn't rise. It stayed thin. Then she made the filling. I remember lots of heavy cream, sugar, cinnamon, beef tallow, and lard. I'm sure a little vanilla as well. I remember using a meat tenderizer hammer to make little holes all over the dough. Then she would spread a thin layer of filling. I think she baked it like that, and then when out of oven, we would flip half the sheet like a book. You ended up with a thin pastry with layer of thin dough, then thin layer of filling, and top layer of thin dough. All 3 layers were almost the same thickness. The dough would get hard if you didn't keep it bagged, but was still good even when a little dry. I remember breaking pieces off of it. \nI would love to taste this recipe one more time in my life.

{"title": "\"Historic\" Cookbooks", "selftext": "Story time: A friend of mine has inherited his stepmother's cookbook collection, as he is a more avid cook than his siblings. The extent of the collection was never clear before her passing, so when two pallets arrived with 48\" cube cardboard containers on them packed to the gills with books, he was a little surprised. We managed to get all two tons of them boxed up and into storage. Six months later, he got a message from a sibling asking if he wanted more cookbooks, and puzzled, he replied he already got them. Oh, no, the sibling answered back, you got the EAST COAST collection. The California house had an additional ton and a half of cookbooks. They are now all consolidated in storage here in Washington State.  \n\n\nHe is obviously never going to cook all the recipes, and just statistically speaking, some of them are going to be crap (especially those from the 1960's and 70's that focus almost exclusively on suspending various foodstuffs in various flavors of gelatin), but many are fascinating snapshots on different periods of American history (most are mid-20th Century, but there are a few community cookbooks and \"housewive's helper\" type cookbooks from the late 1800's). Some are more like textbooks, going into technique more in-depth than most, while others are very clearly based on product advertising (offering 200 new and innovative ways to used canned soups in cooking, for example, or 101 baking recipes for X-brand flour, etc.)  \n\n\nIf I were to gently suggest he doesn't need to keep all those cookbooks, and may possibly not even have the ability to even display them all on bookshelves due to the sheer volume, does anyone know of any library or historical organization that would accept all or most of these cookbooks   en masse?

Nearly all of them are interfertile and very prone to mutation, and most of the combinations aren't entirely complex, so if sweet oranges didn't occur naturally, they likely would have eventually, given how close all these fruit were to one another.\n\nI'm here to possibly lose a battle, maybe start a war, because the man made bit just seems to be said because people believe it has to be that way.

This is a public project meaning anyone may submit.\n\n  \nThe objective of this project is to create a collaborative public-facing online archive that identifies largely unindexed examples of cookery marginalia so they may be indexed and accessed digitally as support of the presence and historical contributions of mothers, parents, homemakers, cooks, and others who labored within the home, for the benefit of the household. The examples collected and presented support histories of the private sphere of the historical American household between the 1700s and 1928.\n\n  \nHandwritten marginalia can be understood as writings found within the margins of documents. This project focuses on these handwritings found within commercially published historical American cookery texts. These marginalia can be in the forms of full recipes written within already published cookbooks, periodicals, and pamphlets. But it may also exist as corrections and alterations to published recipes, commentary and other notes surrounding recipe texts, illustrations, sketches and doodles around cookery text, and marks within cookery publications that denote the ownership or gifting of the texts and areas of emphasis and importance.\n\n  \nThis is an exercise in community critical making and public history; that is, learning and researching through the collaborative creation of things. I encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to this archive to submit examples of marginalia that you have found in American cookery publications from between 1700s and 1928. These could be found in your own personal collection, at a physical library, or from already digitized historical publications within other online archives that have not been indexed and are therefore not searchable.\n\n  \nIf you are interested in helping build the objects and collections within this archive by submitting examples you have found, please visit the below Qualtrics form.

{"title": "St. Louis Style Pizza and No Yeast Pizza Dough", "selftext": "A few years before the pandemic I started trying to make St. Louis style pizza at home. When you search online for St. Louis style pizza recipes you find a common theme of no yeast dough recipes. The only recipe I found for St. Louis style pizza using yeast was in Tony Gemignani's book The Pizza Bible and that recipe isn't something one can find online.\n\nI've eaten many St. Louis style pizzas from multiple St. Louis style pizzerias and I've made several St. Louis style no yeast dough recipes. None of the no yeast dough recipes tasted even remotely like what I was actually eating from St. Louis style pizzerias.\n\nAfter doing some more searching I was able to find a website called Lost Tables https://losttables.com/pizzerias/pizzerias.htm that lists the history of pizza in St. Louis. In 1947 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote a small article about the first pizzeria in the city and noted that the yeasted pizza dough was rolled out, topped with tomato sauce and Provolone cheese, and cut into squares. This sounds, more or less, the same style of pizza we are eating in St. Louis over 75 years later. The exception being the change from Provolone cheese to Provel cheese.\n\nThis led me to start making phone calls and Facebook messaging St. Louis style pizzerias to get a head count of who is using yeast and who isn't. After over two dozen phone calls and several Facebook messages I found that every pizzeria was using yeast. Including the largest St. Louis style chain pizzeria Imo's. During my search I was also able to acquire some whole and partial recipes that the pizzerias were using, or used at some point in the cases of the pizzeria no longer being in operation, and all of them used yeast. I also couldn't find a single example of any pizzeria in St. Louis ever not using yeast.\n\nAfter trying the yeast dough recipes my search for real St. Louis style pizza dough was over. They tasted great and were exactly what I was getting from pizzerias in St. Louis.\n\nOne thing that I couldn't find that I really wanted to was when did this no yeast dough start being associated with St. Louis style pizza? As far as I can find it didn't come out of a pizzeria and after speaking to friends, family, co-workers, and random people online it doesn't seem to be a traditional St. Louis way to make pizza at home either. The no yeast pizza dough recipes also seem to be coming exclusively from people not from St. Louis as well.\n\nMy questions to you fine folks is does anyone know the history of no yeast pizza doughs, how did this type of pizza dough become associated with St. Louis, or does anyone know of any resources I could use to try to continue my search into where this association came from?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1bit0le/st_louis_style_pizza_and_no_yeast_pizza_dough/", "created_utc": 1710876824.0, "score": 11, "author": "HouseofProvel", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/1bit0le/st_louis_style_pizza_and_no_yeast_pizza_dough/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Effectively, all cultures eat, so food is a common cultural language. Probably, the most commonly known example of this is the story of the first thanksgiving. This section also covered the gradual adoption of other cultures by the powerful of a state put pressure on governments to lean towards one or another. The ultimate extension of the food diplomacy being you get your target culture to want to have good ties with you because they feel they know you. \n\nThe last section then covered the spread of these foods into society and how as we reached the modern day the food and recipes have changed. Covering things like pepper used to be worth more than gold and now it is commonplace, refrigeration affected our approach to spices. A touch on capitalist cultural colonization being an independent topic but effectively being an offshoot of this. Then finishing on foods/recipies that were transmittted some we have forgotten the origin, some falsely attributed the origin, and some bastardized the food itself. It was talking about foods like tikka masala, chop suey, American pizza, forgetting katsu was inspired by schnitzel.

{"title": "2024 State of the sub", "selftext": "Hello everyone and welcome to our brand new traditional yearly state of the sub post! It's been a year of great growth, many interesting questions and delightful answers from our users. So before anything else, we want to thank you for making this sub a place where friendly humans exchange knowledge about that most human of passions - food! \n\n\nWhen we said 2023 had seen growth, we weren't kidding, Our end of year monthly unique views were almost four times the uniques views we we had in january; Our pageviews went from around 75K per month in the begining of the year to almost 225K in december! Overall, we're up 366K views over the previous year, up 14.9K uniques over the previous year and now have a whopping 10K subcribers, doubling our numbers from 2022! So a great big welcome to all our new friends, we hope you'll feel at home here!\n\nWith great growth comes greater workload and our fearless leader /u/ryguy_1 is, despite being a reddit mod, trying to have a life. With the new year, he took stock and noticed some trends, globally, numbers were up which was a good thing but more worryingly many threads were becoming filled with unsubstantied arguments, guidelines were routinely ignored and even more worrying, there was wanton abuse of reddit's self harm report option as a disagree button. Feeling that this was getting to be a little much to handle on his own, he resolved to ask the sub's population for volunteers and from all the applicants, ~~six sacrificial victims~~ lucky winners were selected. Please welcome our new assisitant librarians and be kind to them as they grapple with the awesome powers of their ascent to godhood. \n\nFor the benefit of those who are new around here, we'd like to go over the posting guidelies and what they mean to us.\n\n \nGuideline 1\n\n**Questions must be of a historical nature.**\n\nWe will be happy to answer questions that have a strong historical component, such as [this delightful gem  offered to us by /u/SingapoeranSloth](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/18xbuqc/mysterious_world_war_2_canned_beef_stew_is/) but we won't be competent  to deal with more current food questions which can be handled by less history focused subs like /r/AskCulinary or with history questions that aren't about food, these should go to /r/AskHistorians.\n\n\nGuideline 2\n\n**Post specific questions**\n\nThat one shouldn't be a problem, don't post open ended questions, the more specific you are, the better we will be able to help you. Of course, if you need help crafting a question, we'll be delighted to assist.\n\nGuideline 3\n\n**If you have more than one unrelated question, post it in a new post.**\n\nAs above, that one is pretty much self explanatory, Reddit is a chaotic enough place as it is, no need to make it worse. The search function is pretty bad as it is, let's not make it worse.\n\nGuideline 4\n\n**Post credible links and citations when possible**\n\nThis guideline has raised much debate amongst the mods as to how it should be interpreted, we're not going to require every answer to have a linked source but request that one be previded if asked. We recognize that some knowledge may be from oral history or be the result of 'secrets' passed down in a familly or a workplace, so not everything can be definitely sourced but very many things can and should be sourced.\n\n\nGuideline 5\n\n**Answers must be on topic. Food history can often lead to discussions of aspects of history/culture/religion et.c that may expand beyond the original question. This is normal, but please keep try to keep it relevant to the question asked or the answer you are trying to give.**\n\nSimply put, all top level comments must either attempt to answer the question asked or seek to clarify its context. Violators will be removed.  Digression in the lower comments will be tolerated so long as all other rules are respected.\n\nGuideline 6\n\n**Be friendly!**\n\nWe're not here to fight, if you are you will not be welcome very long. It is perfectly healthy to disagree, but arguments should be supported with facts and never descend to the personal level. Name calling is obviously out as is any type of hate speech. Abuse of reddit's self harm report button will result in a ban, mental health is not a joke.\n\nGuideline 7\n\n**Enjoy!**\n\nUnless /r/Transhumanism has broken new ground recently, we don't believe we have in our power to compel your enjoyment, but we do very much hope you enjoy this sub's content. Should be there be things you do not enjoy and wish to discuss, we are creating a META tag for posts about the sub's rules and infrastructure such as this one where comments are open.

{"title": "Mysterious World War 2 Canned Beef Stew, Is Something Similar Or Identical Available Today? Or If Not A Recipe?", "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm here with a World War 2 culinary mystery! I made a post on r/RBI, since they helped me solve another World War 2 culinary mystery, but my latest post there doesn't seem to have gotten as much traction or any useful answers, unlike my last one. So, I've been talking to my Grandma, who, as I explained in my last post, lived through the Japanese Occupation of Singapore as a young girl. Those were some very difficult times, not least because of severe food shortages, which led to quite a few... unusual recipes of necessity being used to survive. However, unlike the mysterious bread (which I should note, that subreddit seems to have solved), my Grandma actually *likes* this mysterious food, and has fond memories of eating it, so we'd like to see if it's still available today (ideally, the exact same brand and packaging, if not, just the same dish, and canned), or at least a recipe, so she, her children and grandchildren can enjoy a *happier* taste of her wartime childhood\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll describe what the mysterious canned beef stew was, and all the clues my Grandma can remember about it:\n\n-It was labelled \"Braised Beef With Soya Beans\"\n\n-It actually did contain beef, cubed and braised (in a cut similar to brisket, but somewhat less fatty), in a stew that was tomato-y, along with possibly soy sauce (this one seems a bit odd to me, more likely some other kind of salty brown sauce?), and soya beans (she is 100% certain they were soya beans, not any other kind of beans and were whitish/very pale brown in colour)\n\n-It came in a can that was cylindrical, similar in dimensions to a Campbell soup can, with a yellowish orange label (she is 100% on the shape, less certain on the labelling, but still fairly certain)\n\n-She is 100% certain that labelling on the cans was in English (I think this is a major clue)\n\n-The cans were only available for the first 9 months or so of the occupation. They were taken from bunkers, fighting positions, personal equipment (webbing and haversacks) and warehouses on military bases abandoned by British Army soldiers when they evacuated or surrendered to the Imperial Japanese Army. She is 100% certain that they were British Army issue (at least in Malaya). Taken cans were then available for a short period of time, before they ran out, so we can rule out anything produced by Imperial Japan (I think this is another major clue)\n\n-She is less certain of this, but she seems to have a vague recollection that the cans were marked \"Made in...\" with the country of origin being somewhere in South America. She has explicitly ruled out Canada and Australia as possible origins (I think this clue at least gives us an idea of what sort of cuisines we should be looking at)\n\n-Unlike most of the wartime food she ate, they were delicious! She's been wanting to try some again for decades now!\n\nSo what we'd like to know is whether they're still available today, and from where (since she's never seen it in a supermarket anywhere in the country, it'll likely have to be bought online). Ideally we'd want the *exact* same brand (hopefully the packaging hasn't changed), if not, another brand of the same dish, canned would be good too. If cans of this dish are no longer produced, we'll happily go for a recipe too. If anyone can find a picture of the wartime cans (hoping some expert on British Army rations will know what she's talking about), so we can confirm if that's it, that'd be great too! :)\n\nEdit: spelling", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/18xbuqc/mysterious_world_war_2_canned_beef_stew_is/", "created_utc": 1704260720.0, "score": 14, "author": "SingaporeanSloth", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/18xbuqc/mysterious_world_war_2_canned_beef_stew_is/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "The Mythology of Yeast", "selftext": "I'm currently trying to recreate a traditional ale barm so I can make an early 1600s recipe for Samhain \"soul cakes.\"\n\nIt has me wondering what people thought about yeast's origins before society discovered it was a microorganism. A sourdough starter, for example, is just a small amount of flour with water (and sometimes honey) that was left out and tended daily until it \"miraculously\" produced the fermentation one was looking for. Sometimes, the starter spoiled instead. Other times, the particular strain of natural yeast captured had an unpleasant flavor profile, while other attempts tasted just right, and all these complex outcomes would have felt fairly unpredictable to historical bakers.\n\nAdditionally, the weather, global location, and season during which one captured wild yeast had a tremendous impact on the success of the process, with it being harder to achieve in winter. I believe there were even a few years in medieval Europe when the temperatures were so far below average that the wild yeast went dormant and its successful capture virtually disappeared, causing most attempts at fermentation to fail during that time.\n\nWith yeast seemingly coming from the aether, and it's collection heavily dependent on both one's technique and simple luck, there must be a rich culture of anecdotes, rituals, folklore, lingo, idioms, and religious superstition around yeast and its use.\n\nWhat did the average person believe about yeast, where it came from, and what it actually was? How did the fickleness of yeast influence kitchen and beer-making culture? What antiquated terms are unique to this mystery process? I can imagine how yeast, more than most things in the kitchen, might seem a bit like magic.\n\nAnyway, I know this is a massive question spanning most of known human history, so I'm mostly curious if anyone has a favorite story or historical fact about this issue, as well as any historical resources/books I could check out myself.

{"title": "Is it true that food in an unopened container in a landfill (such as hotdogs sealed in the same package from its supermarket life) can survive over 20 years without decomposition? If so, why don't we have any historical foods surviving from centuries ago in air sealed containers?", "selftext": "Yesteday I helped my aunt prepare and store food to be used in my dad's promotion to Colonel in the National Guard Airforce (which took place today). As we were clearing the van before we stored food, my auntie found a bunch package of Chinese meatbuns (the white kind that with soft smooth texture that often comes with a paper sticker under them). My aunt was like \"I bought those 4 months ago and couldn't find it!\". We sadly had to throw it since its obviously now bad. But there was something peculiar about it. Despite being under the hot sun in a vehicle for the whole summer, it did not melt into a liquid pile of goo. Not only that, there was no sign of mould or discoloration and ohter associated things with food spoilage. From what I could smell of it from outside the sealed bag , it did not smell bad at all but had the smell so associated with that kind of white bread the Chinese use for their native cake and bread products. I could not smell the meat inside but the fact I couldn't detect anything typically like rotting meat amazed me so much.\n\nThis reminds me of a project I did in middle school where we had to research stuff related to trash and waste management. Is tumbled upon an article from a major news paper (can't remember the name but its a big brand name in the same league as say New York Times and People Magazine). It said something about unopened hot dog still in their plastic sealed containers being found in landfills from 20 years ago looking like in new considtion without discoloration nor did it have a strong scent that should have been apparent because of being refigerated so long even if its in a unopened package. The article emphasized that along with being in factory condition package, since it was in a garbage bag and hidden so long deep in over 50 feet high of a pile of trrash, it could not get oxygen and thus failed to decompose because no microbes were interating with the food.\n\nThe article was written around 1987 meaning that the aforementioned hotdogs and other trash it was commenting on would have been produced in the 1960s decade, To this day I still could not believe the article's claims despite being written by some big name professor or scientist (might have been both) who's in the field of evironmentalist and was doing some project for a university at the time the article was published..........\n\nBut seeing the Chinese meat buns not change at all despite being unrefigrated and outdoors during the hot summers (in even hotter temperature because it was stuck inside a car trunk the whole time) reminded me about that article.......\n\nNow the first major question since I cannot believe it. Is this all possible that sealed food thrown into the center of a bunch of garbage would not be able to composee due to lack of oxygen and in turn lack of germs and other invisible tiny living things especially if its been thrown inside a tied plastic bag ortrash bag or something similar? I still am having difficulty beleiving this is actually real. Now the second question, how long until the food getst ot the point of disappearing? 6 centuries? A thousand years? 3 milennias? A whole eon of a million years or more? Now last and most of all, if food can survive so long without decomposition for decades, how come we don't have easily perishable food from the mid 1800s or even from World War 1 in a surviving state? Sealing food in a cloth, paper, ardboard, wooden box, and even modern day plastic wrapper seal has been in eistence since the late 19th century. Furthermore landfills were already a thing after the Industrial Revolution with places like N the Northern states having problems with running out of space in some ities and towns because of the heaps of trash piling up already shortly after the American Civil War. Landfills just became more and more as technology advanced before World War 1 at the even of the 1900s. The existing amount of open lands being used to pile more and more trash has boosted up even further after WWII. So I'm wondering why don't we have surviving ground beef hidden in a trash pile in Germany thats been wrapped in a cylander plastic dated container dated from 1922 hidden in some landfill in operation for 90s years? Why aren't there some ancient sausage linked wrapped in paper cloth in early trashbags in a landfill thats been in operation since 1879?

I wonder if it's a simplified form of mulled wine or a recipe that developed independently in Japan, either way probably influenced by the \u304a\u6e6f\u5272\u308a (oyuwari) tradition of mixing warm water into sake.\n\nNone of the sources actually even specifies the type of wine that is used for this drink: for all I know, the superficial connection with port wine could be a coincidence or a product of confusion or linguistic analogy.\n\nI've looked through newspaper archives and cocktail inventories for any term that resembles or could have been corrupted to the form p\u014dtorappu but so far it has been fruitless.

{"title": "Why do some countries have \u201cbad food\u201d?", "selftext": "I know that these kind of questions are usually refuted by naming traditional dishes of the country that was considered to have bad food. I would generally agree with this sentiment. From what I\u2019ve seen, countries generally have tasty dishes that those country\u2019s people enjoy.\n\nThat being said, the statement that some countries have bad food still seems true to me. I grew up in Germany, which has very enjoyable (albeit often also very hearty) regional dishes. I would still say that Germany has bad food or a bad food culture (not even factoring in health). The general sentiment in the population is that food needs to be filling and cheap. Therefore, restaurants often offer mediocre quality and use a lot of pre-made and instant ingredients to keep prices low. There seems to be no real appreciation for quality in food. Regional dishes are often known to be of low quality in restaurants (e.g. K\u00e4ssp\u00e4tzle in Swabia) and only made in good quality at home. High quality restaurants will mostly cook french inspired food instead of refining local dishes.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to France where food is celebrated much more. Local dishes are made very well in restaurants and taste is rated over quantity. This goes for so many things, like pastries, wine, etc. While Germany has excellent examples of all of these, the average quality is considerably lower.\n\nAn argument that I\u2019ve often read is that countries with bad food have had less varied produce historically. This seems to be correlated, since in Europe for example, southern countries are often considered to have good food and northern not so much. This argument is not satisfying to me, since from my experience all countries have enjoyable dishes to some extent.\n\nAre there historical/cultural explanations for the way food and food quality is appreciated in different countries?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16bdndp/why_do_some_countries_have_bad_food/", "created_utc": 1693985268.0, "score": 109, "author": "Comfortable-Incident", "num_comments": 71, "permalink": "/r/AskFoodHistorians/comments/16bdndp/why_do_some_countries_have_bad_food/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Berbere or Amazigh seasoning? (Name question)", "selftext": "Hello :) This question has been on my mind for a bit and I wanted to see if someone here could help me understand. So I've had Ethiopian dishes before such as doro wat which heavily feature the spice blend I've always known as Berbere seasoning. When I looked up the history of this blend it said that it is native to Ethiopia and Eritrea and was invented through traders bringing in new spices to Ethiopia from Asia across the Indian Ocean.\n\nI also know that \"Berber\" is an exonym referring to different ethnic groups native to the Maghreb region of Northwest Africa. This word has been replaced by \"Amazigh\" in a lot of contexts because berber is considered derogatory and has roots in the word \"barbarian\".\n\nNow, the other day I was shopping at a spice store in Pittsburgh and I asked for Berbere seasoning and the guy said they had it but that they were now calling it Amazigh seasoning so as not to use the offensive word.\n\nI just corrected myself and didn't ask about it more but now I'm confused. Why is a spice from Ethiopia named after ethnic groups in a completely different part of the continent? Is there a shared etymological root between the so-called \"Berber\" peoples and \"Berbere\" seasoning? I read something that said yes, but I also read something saying the name of the spice comes from \"papare\" the old Ge'ez (ancient Ethiopian language) word for pepper. In which case calling it Amazigh seasoning could be a complete misnomer. As far as I can tell from reading, the Amazigh peoples of North Africa do not have a connection to the Berbere seasoning from Ethiopia. So I'm confused why it would be named after them. I'm not from any of these places so I can't say what names are appropriate or politically correct.

Which leads me to today.  It seems like everyone from the ancient romans onward knew if you shoved a few leaves or dried bits of this and that it made things taste better.  Colonized and enslaved peoples brought with them use of spices and peppers, which eventually made their way through the foods everyone was eating. \n\nWhy is there such an insistence that American and British foods in particular, suffer from not having any spice in them, when I am seeing colonial recipes that call for pepper and herbs galore and 19th century recipes that call for all sorts of mixins and fixins.  Now we make jokes about boiled chicken and mushy peas, but then I see recipes for roasted herb chicken and peas with so much butter and salt and stuff that even I'd have some trouble dealing with the flavors.

Some examples of what I would like to learn:\n\n* Lots of cultures have flat breads: naan, pita, etc. Where was that food invented and when? How did the concept travel through the world? \n* Many Asian countries have soups that are considered regional specialties: ramen, laksa, pho, etc. Do these have a common history, and if so, which was first? When was it invented?\n* Where did the idea of putting ground meat into an animal intestine come from and when? I'm guessing soft sausages were invented first, and hard dried ones like salami came later, but is that true? \n* There are many styles of curry across Asia and many of the recipes are quite complicated. What was the original curry and where was it invented? How did it spread? How was it changed when chile peppers were introduced? \n\nThe specific food doesn't matter so much as the story that is told and how consumable (pun intended) it is.

I checked the city directories and did not find anything. When I searched \"silver leaf flour\" in our digitized newspaper I got a ton of advertisements for a new type of flour called Silver Leaf Flour that was milled at a few different mills in the general area. \n\nThe advertisements don't really explain what silver leaf flour is. Most mention the wheat being extracted in the winter, containing more gluten phosphates, and being of the upmost purity, but no mentions of what makes silver leaf flour silver leaf or the process. \n\nThese advertisements mostly range from the early 1900s to the 1910s. I checked the google ngram viewer for the phrase silver leaf flour and see results as early as 1880 but I can't seem to find anything relevant. \n\nWhen I just do a general search of the phrase Silver Leaf Flour I'm mostly getting digitized records from cultural institutions that have flour sacks of silver leaf flour in their collections. \n\nI tried to do a patent search to see if this kind of flour had some sort of new ground breaking technology for extraction but can't find one (I used the google patents, Justia database, and the UPSTO search but I'm not very good at searching for patents tbh). \n\nWhen I get stumped by a question I'll usually explain to the patron what I looked for and then my educated guesses but I have a feeling that I could use different search criteria or that this is something that is well known but I'm too in the weeds to think.   \n\n\nHere are my educated guesses, would anyone be willing to confirm my guesses or tell me if I'm going down the right path? \n\n1. Silver Leaf Flour is just a marketing term given to normal flour to encourage sales \n2. Silver Leaf Flour is fortified using extractions from Silver leaf maple trees (I did some blog posts about consuming maple seeds but nothing very definitive) \n3. Silver leaf flour is fortified with actual silver leaf like the thing edible leaf that bakers use on desserts\n4.

{"title": "Is the high consumption of beef a recent thing in history?", "selftext": "I've had this discussion with my parents a few days ago and we were thinking about the fact that this modern consumption of beef and breeding of cattle in a high scale just for obtaining its meat is quite recent in mankind's history.\nWhen you think about the past, keeping cattle in a large number was a difficult thing considering how much land it demands for the animal to graze. Not to forget that, unlike pigs and sheep, it would be difficult to confine cattle herd in a barn during the winter time.\nSure, people had cows. However, it was bred for its milk, not necessarily to slaughter in order to obtain its meat. Perhaps that's the reason ( or one of the reasons) why there are few beef dishes in many European and Asian cuisines compared to pork, lamb, poultry and seafood.\nI guess another aspect of why the high consumption of meat is so recent is that only a few countries have the \"geographical\" luck of having enough plain land that is appropriate for breeding cattle in a large scale, in which can include countries like the US, Brazil, Australia, Argentina, etc. One curious fact is that these countries are former colonies, in which had other functions and activities during its colonial time and would start a beef production long after their respective independences. Perhaps that's another factor to it.\n\nWell, this is just my thoughts. I'm don't have a major in history, nor do I know if these points are historically valid.

Even American-Chinese chain Panda Express serves this dish as part of its main menu under the name [Beijing Beef](https://www.pandaexpress.ca/en/menu/entrees/beijing-beef). Despite widespread adoption and love for this dish, its history in the West remains rather opaque.\n\nDespite some English-language [attributions](https://youtu.be/tAyDF8JUXMg) to this dish\u2019s Hunan heritage, I have never encountered a similar or even reminiscent dish while in Changsha. Rather, I believe that this dish originated or was inspired by a delicious Sichuan dish known as [Dry-Fried Shredded Beef \u5e72\u7178\u725b\u8089\u4e1d](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B2%E7%85%B8%E7%89%9B%E8%82%89%E4%B8%9D/954218) *(gan bian niu rou si)*\u2014which itself originates from a fried rice-paddy eel dish.\n\nDry-frying involves neither marinade nor sauce, and traditionally relies on the gradual drying out of the main ingredient over moderate heat, with the subsequent addition of spices and flavorings. The beef, which is cut into strips, ends up slightly crisp and chewy, with a delicious toasty fragrance and a dry, spicy taste *(Dunlop, The Food of Sichuan)*.\n\nThere is a distinct homogeneity between the sweet deep-fried Western versions\u2014in stark contrast to the spicy dry-fried Chinese [original](https://k.sina.cn/article_6677863968_18e081e2000100dwqi.html)\u2014which begs the question of where the sweet Western version of this dish originated and who created it?\n\nThe rise of crispy beef in the West appears to have coincided with the haute British- and American-Chinese (\u201cchinois\u201d) restaurant [movement](https://www.seriouseats.com/ed-schoenfeld-chinese-food-personal-history) of the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s in London and New York, respectively; including [Mr Chow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Chow), Shun Lee Palace, the original Hwa Yuan, and the late [Chin Chin](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?searchResultPosition=7#:~:text=shredded%20beef%20with%20chilies) and Tse Yang.
