Shape into 1 1/2 to 2 inch balls. In large skillet,\u00a0brown meatballs in hot oil; drain. Add desired sauce to\u00a0meatballs, cook as directed in recipe.\n\nTip:\u00a0 To brown in oven, arrange in un-greased shallow baking\u00a0pan; bake at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes or until browned.\n\nCocktail Meatballs:\u00a0 Shape into 1 inch balls; continue as\u00a0directed above. Makes 24 meatballs.\n\n**To Freeze..**\u00a0Flash Freeze and bag together.  \n**To Serve..**\u00a0Just add to any sauce or recipe as needed\n\nnotes...  \nif you use crackers you don't need to use salt..  \n1 sleeve of saltines is one cup of crumbs..  \na tablespoon measure slightly heaped makes a nice size meatball..  \nI bake @ 400 for 20 min.  \nI use dried onions and they work great.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Pre-Cooked Basic Ground Beef**\n\nNext I make the recipes that call for cooked ground beef.\u00a0 I cook my ground beef with garlic and onions.\u00a0 I am a convenience freak, I use the dehydrated onions that I buy\u00a0 in bulk and I use the crushed garlic from a huge jar that I buy at Costco.\n\nWhen my panful of ground beef is cooked (about 5 lb. at a time) I start making the packages that call for cooked ground beef.\u00a0 First I rinse the fat off in a big colander, then using a Tupperware Quick Shake container, I bag my meat 2 cups at a time. The quick Shake container works great because it\u00a0 is 2 cups and has no handle, so it fits great slipping into a quart size ziploc container.\u00a0 Slip, flip, shake, zip..... very fast and easy.\n\n**Ideas to use the Pre-Cooked Basic Ground beef..**.\u00a0 We use this on pizza for pizza night, in our spaghetti sauce which I can without meat in the summertime, or for hamburger gravy and more.\u00a0 Very versatile to have in the freezer.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Noodle stroganoff**\n\n\\*\\* Super easy OAMC instructions...  \nthis is how i do it for OAMC..  \nuse a gallon freezer bag and put it in a large measuring cup to support it..\n\n1 lb (I use 2c.) cooked ground beef seasoned with onion and garlic  \n1 large can (8 oz) canned mushrooms (if you use fresh saut\u00e9 them some)  \n1 can beef broth  \n3 Tblsp Lemon Juice  \n3 Tblsp red wine\n\n**To Freeze..**\u00a0bag together,\u00a0label, date and freeze..\n\n**To Serve..**\u00a0defrost.. add 3 cups noodles ( I add the whole bag but need to\u00a0add a little liquid) cook till noodles are tender then stir in 1c. sour\u00a0cream (or more if you have added extra noodles)\u00a0 warm slightly and serve...\n\nMy family eats this like madmen!! I have had to continually stretch this with\u00a0more mushrooms and noodles to get enough for my family.. You\u00a0can of course lighten this any way you like or use beef soup\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Shepherds Pie**\n\n2 c ground beef (cooked with onions and garlic)  \n1 can tomato soup  \n1 can green beans or corn\n\n**To Freeze..**\u00a0Put in gallon freezer bag and squish together. Label and freeze.\n\n**To Serve:**\u00a0Defrost, put in 1.5 - 2 quart casserole dish,\u00a0 top with 6 servings of mashed potatoes and top with a generous amount of grated cheddar (apx. 3/4 c?) Bake at 350 \\* 30-40 minutes or till hot and bubbly and the cheese is melted.\n\n**Optional:**\u00a0In disposable 1.5 quart foil pan, prepare completely to the cheese and freeze. Defrost and bake as above.\n\n  \n\u00a0\n\n**Beef and Potato Burritos**\n\nAfter browning ground beef with onions and garlic, measure out 4 cups (apx.. 2 lb).\u00a0 Put in fry pan with about 6-8 med. diced potatoes (I chop small in my food processor). Cook until potatoes are done. I don't like to add oil, so if it starts to stick I add water.\u00a0 Add salt, pepper and lots more garlic.\u00a0 When potatoes are tender, spoon into tortillas and roll.\u00a0 Flash freeze, wrap in plastic and put in a big zip bag.\u00a0 To heat wrap in a paper towel and microwave...\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Taco Meat Seasoning Packets**\n\nMakes enough mix for one pound of ground meat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 2 t\u00a0 Instant Minced Onion  \n\u00a0\u00a0 1\u00a0 t\u00a0 Salt  \n\u00a0\u00a0 1\u00a0 t\u00a0 Chili Powder  \n1/2 t\u00a0 Cornstarch  \n1/2 t\u00a0 Crushed Dried Red Pepper\u00a0\u00a0 (optional) - way to hot for my family  \n1/2 t\u00a0 Instant Minced Garlic  \n1/4 t\u00a0 Dried Oregano  \n1/2 t\u00a0 Ground Cumin\n\nCombine all ingredients in a small bowl and blend well.  \n\u00a0  \nMakes 1 package (about 2 T) of mix.\u00a0 Using the above recipe as a guide you can increase the amounts to make any number of packages.  \n\u00a0\u00a0  \nTaco Filling:\u00a0 Brown 1 lb lean ground beef or turkey in a medium skillet over medium high heat; drain the excess grease.\u00a0 Add 1/2 cup water and the seasoning mix.\u00a0 Reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  \n**To Freeze..**\u00a0bag,\u00a0label, date and freeze..  \nMakes filling for 8 to 10 tacos.  \n\u00a0  \nFor a larger quantity - Rip squares of foil for the number you want to make and just portion out the spices on the foil pieces.\u00a0 Fold the spices inside the foil packets and store in cupboard in a container.\u00a0 I use a recycled peanut butter jar.\u00a0\u00a0 I do make my seasoning packets in quantities larger than 1 lb packets.\u00a0 I usually cook 5 lb. meat at a time and use seasoning for 3 lb. But that is how WE like it.\n\n  \n\u00a0\n\n**Sloppy Joe's**\n\nI used to make this from scratch.. then I made it once from a can...
