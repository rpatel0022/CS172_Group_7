{"title": "Follow Up: My Sunday Meal Prep", "selftext": "EDIT: I've been wanting to create a blog for the longest time but didn't think it'd be useful to anyone. I'm starting to realize that more people appreciate the tips/recipes than I thought! So I finally did it... [and here's the link](https://mealprepsunday.wordpress.com/). I'll update it with recipes, new meal prep ideas/tips, and other fitness/nutrition related content. Thanks Reddit!! \n\n[MyMealPrep Instagram](http://instagram.com/mymealprep) [MyMealPrep Twitter](http://twitter.com/mymealprep)\n\nHey Guys, \nI posted a picture of [my meal prep last night] (http://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/2yejpy/my_meal_prep_sunday/) and was pleasantly surprised to see how many of you took an interest in it! A lot of people have been asking for various details about meal prepping, containers, recipes etc. so I thought I would cover it all in this post. \n\n**HOW DO I MEAL PREP!?**\nFor obvious reasons, planning is key when it comes to meal prepping. Keeping things organized will make for the quickest and easiest prep. First things first, decide on what your nutritional goals are. Your meal prep is going to be significantly different if you're an 18 year old girl trying to get healthy vs. a 32 year old guy trying to get in those gains. \n\nDecide on your meals for the week before you hit the grocery store so that you know exactly what you need. Things can start to taste 'bleh' if you're eating the same meal every single day of the week. A good way to start is to create a combination of 1 Carb + 1 Protein + 1 Green. You can obviously alter this if you're on a low carb kick and whatnot. Here's some general ideas: \n\n* Carbs: Quinoa, Brown Rice, Sweet Potato, Lentils, Whole Wheat Pasta\n* Protein: Chicken, Turkey, Meatballs, Lean Beef, Salmon, Tuna, Eggs, Beans \n* Veggies: Broccoli, Green Beans, Brussel Sprouts, Snap Peas, Kale, Spinach \n\n**Where do I start?**\nOnce you've decided on your meals for the week and have bought all the necessary ingredients, it's time to cook. I cook in the following order: meats, carbs, veggies. \n\n**Meats** \nI like to get all the meat out of the way first. Your oven is your best friend. It's the cleanest and quickest way to get your meat cooked. It's going to get super time consuming and messy if you cook everything on the stove. For the meal prep in the photo that I posted, I roasted two whole chickens ([ate some for dinner that night](http://i.imgur.com/iOpEH7t.jpg)) and made mini meatballs out of lean ground beef (also baked). The meat takes a while to cook which leaves you with time to get other things done. \n\n**Carbs**\nIf you're going with quinoa, brown rice, pasta, or any other carb that needs to be boiled then that should be step 2. Set timers or write down times so you know how long everything has been cooking. Try to keep this chaos as organized as possible! If you're cooking up some sweet potato, now is the time to clean, peel, and chop. Get it chopped, seasoned and on a baking tray so that you can pop it in the oven once the meat is done. \n\n**Veggies** [See pic here](http://i.imgur.com/38p8d8N.jpg)\nClean, cut, and season your veggies. If you're going to cook them on the stove, do it now! If you're going to roast them, prep them so that they're ready to go in the oven once the meat is out. FYI - I prep ALL my veggies for the week on Sunday night. That's why there's containers of carrots and whatnot. If you keep everything washed and cut, it literally takes a few minutes to put a meal together. A salad or stirfry will be quick, easy, and best of all.... you'll have ZERO mess. It's also great for when you're looking for something to munch on. If your veggies are clean and cut, you're more likely to eat them. \n\n**How many people is this for?**\nThis is 3 days worth of lunches for 4 people + 1 week worth of granola bars for 4 + 1 week worth of washed and cut veggies for salads, stir frys, and munching. The cut veggies are primarily used for dinners and salads. It's quick and easy to prepare meals when all your ingredients are prepped and it's just a matter of tossing them in.\n\n**How much do you spend?**\nI haven't calculated exact costs in the past but I would say that all of the food pictured probably cost around $40.00. That's in Canadian dollars. I would assume US grocery stores are cheaper. Veggies obviously have to be bought fresh but I buy quinoa, oats, and other non-perishable goods in bulk and on sale. \n\n**How do you store everything? / Where did you get your containers?**\nI use food containers that I bought from a local restaurant supply shop. They are reusable, microwavable, and dishwasher safe. I bought 150 containers for $30.00 and currently have 120 or so sitting in a box... They should last me a long while. \n\n**How do you store it in the fridge?**\n[Like this.](http://i.imgur.com/D77mJyJ.jpg). I know the first three columns are lunches for M,T, & W. The last two have veggies in them and are labeled. \n\n**How do you store your veggies?** \nI store them in plastic containers. The key is to ensure that they are completely dry before you store them. If you store them wet, they will surely spoil much faster. Veggies with a higher water content like bell peppers will not store as long as something like beets. But they should last you 5 days without a problem. \n\n**How long does it take**\nTo prepare everything pictured, it takes about 2 hours on Sunday. My mid-week meal prep on Wednesday takes about 45 minutes since the bulk of the prep is done on Sunday. \n\n**What do I do on Wednesday?** \nGood question. This meals in the picture will last M-W. On Wednesday, I'll prep meals for T-F but because the majority of the prep was done on Sunday, it's much faster with minimal clean up. I'll usually cook up some more meat and roast some of the veggies that I washed and cut on Sunday. Quinoa and brown rice will stay good in the fridge until Friday so if you cook up a big batch on Sunday, it's just a matter of portioning it in containers on Wednesday. Alternately, you could also cook up a new batch on Wednesday. Quinoa is my carb of choice and only takes 15 minutes to cook. I prefer to cook a new batch but there's no harm in cooking a larger batch on Sunday. \n\n**Macros**\nI didn't calculate exact macros but these meals are probably around 300 calories per container.  \n\n**RECIPES** \nSo a bit of a disclaimer: I don't really use recipes. I look at recipes to get ideas and then just work with what I have. I've done my best to get them in recipe form! \n\n**CHICKEN**\n\n* 1 Whole Chicken - I pull all of the skin off to get rid of the excess fat but you can keep it if you wish!\n* Chimichurri Sauce - I made my own but you can find it at any local supermarket. Just make sure to keep an eye on the ingredients and the sodium content. I made it by grinding up some cilantro, thai chillis (I <3 spice), parsley, oregano, and garlic with olive oil and red wine vinegar. I also added some cumin. I'll try to keep track of proportions next time so that I can give you guys a recipe! \n* Preheat oven to 450 F. Clean the chicken and create slits so that the sauce gets infused in the meat. Coat the chicken generously with the chimichurri sauce. Top with a little bit of olive oil if you removed the skin and still want a crispy outside. Cook for 50-60 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165. Carve chicken and top with remaining chimichurri sauce. \nFYI - For roasting chickens, this is't the only recipe you can use. Just top it with some garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and you'll have yourself a delicious, fool-proof roast chicken! \n\n**GARLIC GREEN BEANS** \n\n* 1 lb green beans (or as much as you have/want!) \n* 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic \n* 1 teaspoon olive oil \n* Salt \n* Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add green beans and cook for 3-4 minutes until cooked but still crisp. Add salt to taste. \n\n**SPICY SWEET POTATO**\n\n* 3 Sweet Potatoes, cubed \n* 1/2 tsp salt \n* 1/2 tsp pepper \n* 1/2 tsp paprika \n* 1/2 tsp crushed chilli peppers \n* 1/4 tsp dry thyme \n* 1 tsp onion powder \n* 1 tsp garlic powder \n* 1 tbsp olive oil \n* Clean, peel, and cut sweet potatoes. Add spices + olive oil and mix until well coated. Bake at 425 F for 20 minutes or until fully cooked. \n\n**BROCCOLI**\n\n* 2 Broccoli Crowns\n* 2 Cloves of Garlic \n* 1 tsp olive oil \n* 1 tsp onion powder \n* Crushed chilli peppers to taste \n* 1.5 tsp reduced sodium soy sauce \n* Cook garlic in olive oil over high heat. Add broccoli, onion powder, soy sauce, and crushed chilli peppers (if desired). Cook for 3-5 minutes until cooked but still crisp. \n\n**QUINOA SALAD** \n\n* 1.5 cups cooked quinoa \n* 1/2 Bell Pepper \n* 1/4 English Cucumber \n* Crumbled Feta (as much as you like)\n* 4 Red Radishes\n* Squeeze of lemon \n* Handful of Snap Peas \n* Pepper to taste\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder \n* Cook 1.5 cups of quinoa in 3 cups of boiling water. Bring to a boil and then cover and reduce to low heat for 15 minutes. Allow quinoa to cool. Mix in all other ingredients. Feta is quite salty so no need to add additional salt. \n\n**CHOCOLATE CHIP GRANOLA BARS** \n\n* 1/2 cup organic honey (get the real stuff, not the sugar syrup)\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \n* 2 cups of quick cooking oats \n* 1.5 puffed quinoa or whole wheat rice krispies \n* 1/2 cup of sliced almonds \n* 1/4 cup of flax meal \n* chocolate chips to top (as many or as few as you like) \n* Place the honey in a small sauce pan and heat on low for 2 minutes stirring constantly. The honey should be thinner than when it was at room temperature. Add vanilla extract to honey. Mix oats, quinoa/cereal, almonds, and flax in a bowl. Add honey and mix. If required, add more honey directly to the dry ingredients. Place in a 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper and ensure that the mix is flat. I usually press down hard with a small baking tray. Top with chocolate chips. Place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Cut in bars and serve! \n\nLeave any other questions you have in the comments section. Sorry if this isn't super clear. I'm happy to provide clarification on anything - just leave me a comment!

Is there something about rice that I'm just missing that explains why it seems so popular whereas pasta is so often considered a food suited for the rare \"cheat meals\"?\n\nAnother thing would be quinoa - why is that thing considered a superfood? In protein and fiber, it doesn't seem to beat whole wheat pasta. Is there something about the micronutrients that I don't understand?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/fgmsuf/why_rice_over_pasta/", "created_utc": 1583880712.0, "score": 370, "author": "EspacioBlanq", "num_comments": 162, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/fgmsuf/why_rice_over_pasta/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Oven roasted chicken breasts turned out dry and bland no matter what I did, but then I learned to not suck at cooking. Here are my tips for awesome oven roasted chicken breasts.", "selftext": "First and most importantly, avoid overcooking your chicken breasts. Once your chicken is cooked to the point it's safe to eat (i.e. all the bacteria is dead), every additional minute it spends in the oven will take it one step closer to becoming a wooden hockey puck. Rather than taking out your chicken when it reaches 165\u00b0F, take it out when it reaches 150\u00b0F instead. Pasteurization (the process of killing bacteria in food through heat) is a function of both time and temperature. Bacteria die the instance they hit 165\u00b0F, but they will also die at 150\u00b0F if they stay at that temperature for three minutes ([chart for reference](https://www.seriouseats.com/images/2015/06/20150610-sous-vide-chicken-guide-pasteurization-chart.jpg)). If you take out your chicken when it reaches 150\u00b0F, it will remain at this temperature for at least three minutes on the counter, so it will then be safe to eat. In terms of actual cooking time and oven temperature, I\u2019d recommend cooking your chicken breasts at 375\u00b0F for 30 minutes and flip the breasts halfway through cooking. If the breasts you buy aren\u2019t particularly plump or big, then 25 minutes cooking time may be more appropriate.\n\nSecond, you need to either marinade your chicken or brine your chicken before cooking it (if you do a brine you'll also want to apply a dry rub after). And if you\u2019re too lazy to do a marinade or brine, at least do a dry rub that contains salt.\n\nMarinading means soaking your chicken breasts in a seasoned, acidic liquid for some amount of time. A marinade typically consists of the following:\n\n* oil (e.g. olive oil)\n* acid (e.g. lemon juice, vinegar)\n* sugar (e.g. honey, brown sugar)\n* salt (e.g. fine sea salt, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce)\n* aromatics (e.g. garlic, onion, ginger)\n* herbs/spices (e.g. cumin, paprika, black pepper, rosemary, thyme)\n\nBy marinading your chicken, you allow the salt, sugar, and acid to penetrate its surface (the other ingredients will just sit on the outside for the most part). The purpose of the salt is mainly to make the chicken taste better, as salt stimulates your taste buds, thus bringing out all the other flavors. Acid will break down the outside tissue of the chicken and make it more tender. The sugar will encourage caramelization. If you do go with a marinade, marinade your chicken for 30 minutes to 3 hours in the fridge (mix everything in a ziploc bag). Contrary to popular belief, marinading your chicken overnight is not a good idea. After 3 hours, the salt, sugar, and acid will have penetrated the chicken as much as they reasonably can, and if you marinade for longer than that, the acid will turn your chicken into mush.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to brine your chicken, which means soaking your chicken in salt water. By soaking your chicken in salt water, you allow the chicken to absorb both the salt and water. This will season your chicken beyond the surface and make it more juicy at the same time. To brine chicken breasts, soak them for 2 hours in a solution containing 50g salt for every 1 liter of water (approx 1 tbsp of salt for every cup of water). Keep in mind that if you brine your chicken for too long, it will become overly salty. You can also add sugar to your brine if you desire (add half as much sugar as you do salt). Fyi, a lot of chicken that you buy at the grocery store is prebrined, i.e. injected with salt water, so don't brine these cuts if you buy them.\n\nAfter brining your breasts, you obviously want to add some other flavors, so apply a dry rub, that is, coat your breasts in a mix of dried herbs and spices. You can add oil to the dry rub if you want and lather your chicken in such a mixture.\n\nIf you can, buy and use fresh chicken. Freezing chicken causes the cells in its tissues to rupture, which messes with its texture and its moisture content when it thaws. Freezer burn can also be an issue.\n\nIn terms of marinades and dry rubs, there are a lot of options, so just look some up and use the one that sounds best to you. You can buy premade seasoning packets if you want (e.g. taco seasoning, fajita seasoning, italian dressing seasoning), though such packets often contain a lot of salt, so you would want to decrease the brining time.\n\ntl;dr either marinade your chicken or brine it and apply a dry rub after and then take your chicken out of the oven when it hits 150\u00b0F (30 minutes at 375\u00b0F, flip halfway through)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/baf00n/oven_roasted_chicken_breasts_turned_out_dry_and/", "created_utc": 1554633221.0, "score": 305, "author": "Fossana", "num_comments": 37, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/baf00n/oven_roasted_chicken_breasts_turned_out_dry_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "The Costco Hit List", "selftext": "I've been on a post-pandemic body recomp for the past 7 months, meaning I watch my calories, eat lots of protein and lift weights (my NSFW r/progresspics are in my profile for those with a strong stomach).\n\nI was just looking through my pantry and realized that I've been leaning heavily on a few items from Costco that have really helped me with my progress, so I thought I would list them here as it might help others going through a recomp/diet.\n\nOf course, you have to be a Costco member to purchase these items at a good price, or know someone with with a membership. Some of these items can be found in other stores or online.\n\n**EDIT: Some commenters brought up the fact that some of these foods are highly processed, meaning also high in sodium/preservatives/etc. I agree 100%, and so I'll caveat this by saying my diet has been mostly founded on healthy basics like the standard chicken breast, brown rice and broccoli meal.**\n\n**However, I'm acutely aware of the fact that the majority (vast majority) of people who diet end up gaining their weight back, and a large percentage of those actually end up weighing more than where they started. For me personally, there were serious health issues associated with my weight gain, and I felt that I didn't have the option to gain the weight back, so I had to program a few \"escape valves\" into my diet in order to fight the urge to binge eat. This means that I pretty much follow the old maxim of \"all things in moderation\", including some of the (relatively low calorie) food below.**\n\n**I don't recommend eating hot dogs every day. :)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Jones Fully Cooked Chicken Sausage Links** \\- these are breakfast sausage-sized, and taste like normal pork sausages. It's a 3 lb bag for about $13, and 3 links are only 90 calories. I usually have them every morning with my eggs, just 1 minute in the microwave and they're ready.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Sweetwell Sugar-Free Coconut Cookies** \\- These taste kind of flat, but at only 80 calories for 5 cookies they make a pretty good afternoon snack regardless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **FitCrunch Protein Bars** \\- these are definitely the best protein bars I've tried by far (and no chemical taste!). The ones at Costco are the Chocolate Peanut Butter bars - they're baked and taste like candy bars, but only have 3g of sugar @ 190 calories. I eat these as a morning or afternoon snack, or sometimes post-workout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Bibigo Chicken and Cilantro Wontons** \\- Costco sells a 3 pound bag of these for about $13. They're delicious and at only 100 calories for 8 wontons they can pretty easily be added to meals for extra volume/protein. I even once dumped them into some Trader Joe's low-cal mac and cheese (lazy).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **NuTrail Low Carb Keto Nut Granola** \\- like any granola, this is somewhat higher in calories (190 per serving, 0g added sugar), but I put 1/2 serving into my oatmeal in the morning when I'm trying to bulk up. This was on sale at Costco last week for about $9 for a 22 oz bag, not sure if it still is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Kirkland Egg Whites** \\- there are cases of egg white cartons for only $9 in the dairy cold room (where the milk is). I mention this because they are kind of hidden and not everyone knows about them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Kirkland Almond Milk** \\- a giant case of cartons (that will be too heavy for most people to carry comfortably) is only about $10. I use this in my protein shakes and oatmeal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Optimum Nutrition Chocolate Protein Powder** \\- an 80 serving bag (about 5.5 lbs) is on sale right now for $54 at my local Costco.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Kinder's Buttery Steakhouse Rub** \\- meant for steaks obviously, but I put it in almost everything to add big flavor. Zero calories, but watch the sodium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Costco Rotisserie Chicken** \\- have to mention this, as it's a LOT of chicken for only about $4. It's a loss leader for the store, meaning they sell it at a low price to keep people coming back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The famous Costco Hot Dog** \\- I of course have to mention this as well. It's 550 calories, only $1.50 with a Diet Pepsi (another loss leader) and tastes like real food (it's really delicious). When I have a craving for fast food (as you sometimes do), I just run over and grab this deal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/v8175n/the_costco_hit_list/", "created_utc": 1654725740.0, "score": 263, "author": "EmpathyForTheD3vil", "num_comments": 70, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/v8175n/the_costco_hit_list/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I have tried, I have supplemented his daily intake with either Ensure or Boost or some sort of 30 g liquid drink. And I'm trying to figure out what else I should do. As with many people who are older, he's not all that hungry frequently and he doesn't do snacking. He does have his three meals a day and is doing his exercises so he's trying to stay fit and healthy but I just wonder if we should be doing more. I'm also worried about his dehydration not that he shows signs but just that he doesn't like to drink water.  Fortunately, he's not a picky eater, but he also doesn't really care to eat other than the basic meals we eat. Thank you for any ideas\n\nUpdate:  He's now doing 30g protein shakes with/after each meal, getting more liquid and I'm working to improve my grocery shopping and menus == we haven't done that bad really but always good to do better.

{"title": "What are your \"Perfect Meals\" that hit all your daily nutrients in one go? Round II", "selftext": "I posted a similar question around 5 or 6 month ago and got brilliant responses. I figured with the growth of this sub and COVID going on, people may have come up with more \u201cPerfect meals\u201d. So what are your super meals? Those meals that are healthy, super filling and satiating, have variety, are delicious, hit appropriate macros, and have as many micronutrients and vitamins as possible. Maybe let us in on some of your secret add ons or substitutions to regular meals that make them more nutritious!\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTo address one of the main concerns from last time: The point of this thread is come up with as many \u201cPerfect Meals\u201d as possible, to hit all of your daily nutrients and goals while having a variety of foods. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPrime examples from last time: \n\n* **Green smoothie/yogurt:** Spinach and Kale, Greek yogurt, orange juice, ice, berries, and protein powder (and whatever other fruits one may desire). Fantastic macros, LOADED with vitamins, and low calorie. \n* Basic Burrito: grilled chicken, black beans, taco sauce, tomatoes, onion, pepper, and some dark greens. Complex carbs, (One may substitute for other \u201chealthier sauces like buffalo sauce). Lots of protein, good fats, loads of vitamins. \n\n* **Chili:** I use a mix of lean meats, but you can use whatever, red beans, black beans, and lentils. Onion, pepper, assorted chili peppers, and whatever other veges that might fit. Canned tomatoes and bone broth as the liquid. This is one of the most variable and filling ones I like to eat. Not exactly high in nutrients, but definitely high in protein, lower in other macros, and very high in fiber. \n\n* **3 bean Salads:** I use brown rice and/or quinoa, chop up tons of spinach and parsley (or other dark greens), red onion, and peppers. This can be modified to a ludicrous degree as well. Add feta and balsamic vinegar. Add soy sauce and ginger and some nuts. Add buffalo sauce. Add cumin, oregano, chilis, and taco sauce. Super delicious, high in nutrients, great macros. \n\n* **Various Soups:** My favorite is a blended cauliflower, butternut squash, red lentil, onion, and curry spices. So good. Nutritious and delicious on cold days. Please post all your loaded healthy soups! Always love more.\n\n* Yes, everyone knows that \u201cChicken, Veggie, and Rice\u201d works. Please don\u2019t post that. It\u2019s not that tasty.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat are some other \u201cperfect meals\u201d that you guys prepare?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEdit:  \n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/ge41wj/what_are_some_perfect_meals_that_can_hit_all_your)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/jn8276/what_are_your_perfect_meals_that_hit_all_your/", "created_utc": 1604399625.0, "score": 254, "author": "der3009", "num_comments": 70, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/jn8276/what_are_your_perfect_meals_that_hit_all_your/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chili. High protein, low carb, generally low calorie, low cost.. where have you been all my life?", "selftext": "I do meal prep Sundays and am on a high protein/kinda low calorie diet. I usually cook a bunch of chicken to eat throughout the week in various forms, but still needed protein shakes/bars to hit my goals. \n\nA few weeks ago I decided to make a pot of chili. I did it while I'm prepping my marinade, marinating and what not. I had generally made chili in the slow cooker which I now think is kind of a waste of time when it can be done so quickly on the stove.\n\nHoly smokes. For such little effort, you can have loads of healthy, high protein, low calorie, entirely customizable food to eat all week!\n\nMy last batch consisted of:\n\n*  2 lbs 90% lean ground beef\n\n*  1 can chickpeas\n\n*  1 can pinto beans\n\n*  1 can black beans\n\n*  2 10oz cans rotel\n\n*  3oz tomato paste\n\n*  1 small can diced jalapenos\n\n*  1 whole yellow onion\n\n*  1 green bell pepper\n\n*  1 red bell pepper\n\n*  3 tbsp pre minced garlic (I know, I know)\n\nEdit:\n\n*  Forgot I squeezed half a lime into it and also poured like 1/4-1/2 the 12oz lager I was drinking in there. Otherwise, No liquid necessary although it's a thick, chunky chili which is how I like it!\n\nSpices: Cumin, chili powder, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, fresh cracked salt and pepper.\n\nThe list seems long, but seriously, **all you do is chop an onion and two bell peppers, then it's all opening cans.**\n\nThe little amount of work for so much tasty and healthy food kinda blows my mind. \n\nI fill five smallish tupperwares with chili to grab and go for a 10 AM breakfast at work. Have a smallish cup of chili during lunch with my main dish (chicken sandwich, lately). Last night for dinner I chopped up one of my pre-cooked chicken breasts and put it on a salad, with a side soup of.. chili! \n\nIf you lift or exercise at all, protein is very important for rebuilding torn muscles and other functions. \n\n**Customization:**\n\nIf you don't like ground beef or want a more lean meat, you can sub it for turkey or chicken (chicken has that protein boost as well).  [Here](https://www.budgetbytes.com/weeknight-black-bean-chili/) is a great turkey blackbean chili that's even more simple to do. I did this one two weeks ago. \n\nYou can do 3 beans, one bean or no bean! I've made a three meat chili that just had ground beef, cubed chuck roast and ground pork. No beans about it. I personally prefer beans for their own health benefits you don't get from meat. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to share this for any meal preppers out there!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/b8ljfa/chili_high_protein_low_carb_generally_low_calorie/", "created_utc": 1554222912.0, "score": 247, "author": "DothrakAndRoll", "num_comments": 85, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/b8ljfa/chili_high_protein_low_carb_generally_low_calorie/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "What are your go to \"every day\" quick meals?", "selftext": "Curious if anyone else has something that they end up eating almost every single day. If so, what is it and why do you eat it so often?\n\nHere's mine:\n\n* 227g Fage 0% Plain Greek Yogurt\n* 32g Optimum Nutrition Naturally Flavored Vanilla Whey\n* A couple splashes of water to help the whey blend well\n\nDirections -- stir it all together and eat.\n\nMacros:\n\n* 260 kcal\n* 14g carbs\n* 1g fat\n* 47g protein\n\nI'm on an 1,800 kcal/day diet and working to hit about 190 grams of protein per day, so recipes with > 1g protein for every 10 kcal are critical. By working in a bowl of this every day, I stay very full and nail 25% of my protein at the expense of not many cals or carbs. This allows some diet flexibility so I'm not beholden to chicken for every single meal.\n\nSpeaking of chicken...here's an actual recipe adapted from Protein Chef. I don't eat this every day but I make it weekly and have for lunch or dinner a few times per week. It takes the normal boring and bland chicken breast and transforms it into something very pleasant to eat.\n\n* 900g boneless skinless chicken breast (about 2 lbs)\n* 60g panko breadcrumbs\n* 60ml olive oil\n* Italian herb blend -- garlic, pepper, oregano, basil, etc...whatever you have to taste\n\nDirections: Saute the olive oil with herbs for a few minutes to infuse the oil. Let it cool a bit, then roll each chicken breast in the oil to coat and then the panko. Bake for ~40 mins at 375, until internal temp hits 165.\n\nMacros (per 120g cooked serving, assuming about 25% weight reduction on the meat):\n\n* 260 kcal\n* 9g carbs\n* 12g fat\n* 33g protein\n\nYield is about 6 servings for 2 lbs of chicken. If I'm eating this for a full meal, I'll hit 3 servings for 780 kcal and 100g of protein. This plus the yogurt recipe leaves about 800 kcal with which I can eat damn near anything I want and still hit my macro targets.\n\nSo what are your go to quick recipes?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/6duj1v/what_are_your_go_to_every_day_quick_meals/", "created_utc": 1495987444.0, "score": 239, "author": "suburban_robot", "num_comments": 82, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/6duj1v/what_are_your_go_to_every_day_quick_meals/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "[TIP] stretching your dollar with chicken breast xpost from /r/fit", "selftext": "**Background**\n\nChicken breast is obviously a staple for a lot of guys and gals here, myself included.  Being the stingy Jew that I am, I refuse to pay more than $2.50 per pound for boneless/skinless (less for split breast obviously). I never buy prefrozen breasts because if you look at the label it says **they are 10-15% water weight!**  I only buy chicken breast either from Aldi (always $2.00-$2.50) or I watch the sales at the grocery store.  Giant and Shoppers always seems to have good deals.  Suffice to say I'm not shopping at Publix or Whole Foods.  And when I do buy it, I stock up.  I'll usually buy between 6-12lb at a time. The issue is this: *when the chicken is this cheap, it's usually from older birds which means the breasts are huge with a tough/unpleasant texture*.  But with about 20 minutes of work, you can have your chicken breast ready for any recipe.  The secret is brining.\n\n**What is brining?**\n\nBrining chicken breast involves soaking it in a salt/sugar water solution for about an hour.  This causes the individual muscle fibers to breakdown and gives it a much more tender, juicy flavor.  You should be brining your chicken breast all the time.  The chicken stays juicier which is great for anyone who grills and knows how quickly chicken breast can dry out.  If you ever notice, a chik-fil-a chicken breast is not \"stringy\" inside and that is because they brine their chicken.  This is also why it is so tender and fucking delicious.\n\n**How do I brine my chicken?**\n\nFirst of all, let's talk ratios.  For every 4lb of chicken, you want to use 4 cups of water, 1/8 cup of sugar & 1/8th cup of salt.  If you're brining less than 4lb of chicken, just use the above measurements.  Don't get too caught up in getting the ratio perfect to the amount of chicken you have.  What's more important is getting the ratio of water:salt:sugar right.  First thing's first, throw your salt, sugar, and one fourth of your water (so in this case 1 cup) in a sauce pan, put it on low heat and stir it until the sugar and salt dissolves completely.  This should only take 2-5 minutes depending on big your batch is.  Then pour the salt/sugar/water mixture into a bowl big enough for all your chicken.  Add the remaining COLD water and stir.  Now throw this in the fridge and let it cool while you prep the chicken.\n\nBecause you bought cheap chicken breast, they are probably super thick and need to be [butterflied](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjfQP3Mp2k&t=0m24s).  The only difference is you want to cut them completely in half so that each breast yields two pieces of roughly the same thickness.  Once you have all your chicken cut, throw it in the brining solution and let it sit anywhere from 1-1.5hrs.  Once its done, dump out your brining water and use them as you please.  I like to throw 2-3 pieces each into a quart ziplock bag and freeze it.  Now you've got juicy tender chicken breast ready to defrost and cook at a moments notice.  This is a long post but honestly the entire process takes maybe 20 minutes of work.  Brined chicken last in the refrigerator for about 5-7 days.\n\nHope you guys find this useful!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1p0qtb/tip_stretching_your_dollar_with_chicken_breast/", "created_utc": 1382492674.0, "score": 191, "author": "akcom", "num_comments": 61, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1p0qtb/tip_stretching_your_dollar_with_chicken_breast/", "html_title": ""}

All the brownies, doesn't matter what kind, but all the low cal versions I have tried seems to fail or are loaded with sugar alcohol like erythritol. At best they taste good but have zero structure to them, just a gooey mess that can cause stomach issues. At worse, the high protein ones, are dry and could be used for cannon fodder. As such, I have worked through some available recipes to land on one that never fails and is super simple.\n\nFor those who want to see. https://imgur.com/a/O61NQd9\n\nA frosted version, a carrot cake version, and then 2 shots of the regular old recipe as shown.\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n* 1 serving, 53g of Kodiak Dark Chocolate Powercake mix\n* 1 serving, 30-31g of casein/whey blend protein powder (I use pescience select)\n* 5g of baking powder\n* and sweetener of choice, I use liquid splenda (aka liquid sucralose or Kroger-branded Apriva.) You don't need much since both the mix and the protein powder are sweetened already.\n* You add enough water to make it the consistency of a cake batter, I find this amount varies between protein brands so I can't give an absolute amount.\n\n* (1 tsp of a neutral oil can be used if you desire more fats, it also makes the brownie just a tad moister.)\n\nMix in a bowl, microwave for 2 minutes and eat. In fact, if you get the Dixie large dessert bowls (50 for 6-7 bucks at Walmart, they also sell store brand at both walmart and kroger), it will hold one full brownie and then you can throw it away/recycle it when you're done. No mess other than a spoon.\n\n**What Flavor Protein?**\n\nIn my experience, Chocolate Cupcake gives the best \"chocolate\" flavor. But I have also used Snickerdoodle (more of a cinnamon infused Mexican hot chocolate flavor), White Chocolate Peppermint Bark (a Christmassy feel to it), and Mint Cookie (very girl scout cookie tasting), I've also used Cookies and Cream which has almost a mix between a brownie and a blondie. You can always add a few grams of cocoa powder or vanilla to push whichever way you prefer.\n\nHonestly, chocolate goes with basically the entire pescience line up, although I wasn't a fan of Cake Pop. Didn't taste bad, just seemed \"flat\" tasting.\n\n**Macros:**\n\nThis is roughly 300-310cals, 31g carbs, 3.5g fat and 38-39g protein. (Variations between protein powder flavors account for minor swings in contents) \n\n**Use Cases:**\n\nCan be easily pre-measure, packed in plastics bags and if you use the dixie bowl then you've got an easily portable breakfast or snack w/ a plastic spoon. Or a bit greener with a bamboo disposable one. You can also just pre-do packages of mix for home for a quick chocolaty snack, breakfast, or I even use it for a quick dinner sometimes. Also, the recipe is easily doubled but cooking time will vary. Just watch for the moment when just a little bit of the top of the brownie is still wet.\n\n**Cost per serving:**\n\nAt 6.50/box of Kodiak and 37.00/27 serving container of Pescience, I have about 2.02 in each of these brownies. If you only buy this protein for these brownies 2 boxes of Kodiak will net you 20 brownies, so you'll have about 2.50 in each w/ 7 servings of protein powder left over. Both items can be bought in bulk, so you can get that price down as well.\n\n**Variations on the brownie (obviously changes macros):**\n\nUse white chocolate peppermint bark and a drop of peppermint oil for a chocolate peppermint brownie.\n\nAdd a few grams of coconut flakes for coconut brownies.\n\nAdd a few grams of chocolate chips. Or drizzle the top with sf chocolate syrup.\n\nLet the brownie cool, poke holes in it, and pour in a bottle of a chocolate or coffee flavored Fairlife Protein Milk for a Tres Leche like cake/brownie and more protein. (this is amazing for a breakfast, 450cals and 68g of protein)\n\nMix half a scoop of cookies and cream protein with just enough water to make a glaze for the cake.\n\nMix a vanilla Greek yogurt cup with 1/4 package chocolate fudge FF/SF jello pudding mix, 5-10g of cocoa powder, and a bit of sweetener for a fantastic frosting (makes a great high protein birthday cake).\n\nSF caramel topping is great, so is SF strawberry jam that's been slightly warmed. Nuke some frozen raspberries till warm works too.\n\nA scoop of sea salt caramel Halotop on top is AWESOME.\n\nAnd a final sweet and savory bomb ... finely dice half a strip of well-cooked bacon, mix with 1-2 tblspn of Walden Farms Maple/Bacon syrup, and pour over the warm brownie.\n\n**Major Variation**\n\nYou can make a blondie like cake as well, by switching to Cake Pop or Snickerdoodle protein flavor, some vanilla extract and Plain or Cinnamon Oat Kodiak powercake mix. The oatmeal in the latter will make it dry, so youll need to add some water. Let the batter sit for 2 minutes, then add more to get the right hydration level. But I prefer the chocolate-based recipe MUCH better and its more consistent in the end product in my experience.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nNone. Both items can be easily found/ordered anywhere in the US, so I won't tell you where to find them. I'm not affiliated with any company mentioned in any way, these are just the ones I have found to give me a consistent product each time I make this recipe, which I will admit is probably more than I should, lol. Lastly, never pay for pricey cookbooks that are ultimately just what someone else likes. Learn the skills needed to cook low-cal, high protein, or low-carb then produce your own recipes and save your money.

Fruit, Syrup, Sugar etc. that was the problem. So I bought some **Whole Oats**, turned on the **rice cooker** and **added Garlic, Soy Sauce, and Habanero Powder.** And what do ya know **Tastes just like Ramen**! Same texture, smell and everything else. I love this stuff AND I get some easy healthy carbs it's AMAZING.\n\nI posted this here because for YEARS on websites/youtube etc all I have ever seen are these people putting sugary crap in their oats/oatmeal.

{"title": "Can we talk about sardines for a minute?", "selftext": "Sardines. They get a pretty bad rep. From the 'eww' factor of soft and chewy bones to their portrayal as universally despised food in pop culture (*I'm lookin' at you, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs*), they are hardly anyone's first choice for a meal.\n\n\nI recently became interested in an alternative to tuna as a small female who shouldn't be eating much mercury-heavy fish. I like cheap, easy protein and canned tuna was perfect for that. But the risks to my longterm health weren't really justifying my love of guacamole and tuna bean salads (*1/2 cup black beans, 2 tbsp fresh guacamole, 1 small can of tuna, since we're on /r/fitmeals*).\n\n\nSo I sucked it up, walked into Trader Joes, and grabbed a can of spring water-canned sardines. \n\n\nAnd you know what, it really wasn't bad. I was, for some reason, expecting the world's most atrocious smell to come from that can, but honestly, it was milder than tuna. The appearance wasn't too bad either- just small fillets of shiny fish. I decided to try my bean salad with mashed up sardines and hit my only mental obstacle- bones. Tiny little spines emerged from the fish and I had to stay strong as I dutifully mashed the little fish into my beans. Sardines and beans turned out to be a pretty good combo- it felt like a milder alternative to the sometimes harsh taste of tuna- and I thought, \"I could get used to this.\"\n\n\nSo I decided to see what other health benefits the sardines offered besides their low mercury content. I quickly found that because you consume the bones, they are full of **calcium**, which is great for those who don't consume dairy. They are also **packed** with **Vitamin D, B12, and Omega-3 fats**. All these are great for your heart and bones.\n\n\nBut the real winning part for many of us on /r/fitmeals is the **protein**.  The can I got from Trader Joe's contained only 130 calories worth of fish, but packed in **17 grams of protein**. \n\n\n**TL;DR**: All in all, the sardine doesn't deserve the hate it gets. Not only is it affordable, nutritious, and versatile, it's also a very sustainably sourced fish. So here's your challenge- *try some sardines!*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/2b4qc7/can_we_talk_about_sardines_for_a_minute/", "created_utc": 1405777325.0, "score": 175, "author": "ifeelhopeless", "num_comments": 72, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/2b4qc7/can_we_talk_about_sardines_for_a_minute/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to order at restaurants without ruining your gains.", "selftext": "Edit: this is for people who need/like to eat out on a very regular basis due to career choices, schedules or just don\u2019t like to cook. \n\nOf course you can indulge in whatever you enjoy whenever you get the chance, this is just for regular restaurant attendees :)\n\n1. Always choose \u201cGrilled\u201d instead of \u201cFried\u201d if that is an option. \u201cFried\u201d automatically adds calories based on cooking the food in oil. Many\n\ntimes, \u201cFried\u201d also implies that the food is breaded as well, which adds many additional carbs, too.\n\n2. Salads are USUALLY good options. Choose salads with a variety of natural color, healthy fats (nuts, seeds, avocado), berries, vegetables and\n\nGRILLED leaner protein (chicken, fish, steak). Ask for the dressing on the side, so you can control how much you put on the salad.\n\n3. Drink tons of water and limit your alcohol intake. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t ever have a drink, but definitely try to limit how much you drink.\n\nAlcohol is basically full of \u201cempty\u201d calories and contain zero nutritional value. Also try and avoid sugary alcoholic drinks as well. Club soda (zero\n\nsugar) is a great mixer for liquor drinks.\n\n4. Share your apps and desserts. Have some fun with ordering a little extra and trying new apps and desserts. Sharing them will allow you to try\n\nnew things without going completely overboard.\n\n5. Choose lower calorie sauces such as mustard, buffalo sauce, hot sauce, tomato sauce and many others. White sauces (egg and oil-based) tend\n\nto be higher in calorie.\n\n6. Pick a balanced combination \u2013 a leaner meat/protein (tofu/fish/egg for non-meat-eaters), one higher carb item (rice, potatoes, quinoa, pasta)\n\nand a vegetable. Use 1-2 tablespoons of sauce/dressing.\n\n7. Add a little salt and pepper. Adding some seasoning can really change the taste of a meal. Once again, don\u2019t go overboard with them, but as\n\nlong as you are drinking water, you will stay hydrated even with a little salt.\n\n8. Substitute a healthier side. Many times, an entr\u00e9e will be paired with an item like French fries, but most restaurants will have other options\n\nyou can choose.\n\n9. Don\u2019t be afraid to have LEFTOVERS. I\u2019m all about not wasting food, but you can always take some home. Just because a restaurant sends you\n\ntheir idea of a \u201cportion-size\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean it is the correct portion-size for YOU. Some restaurants definitely tend to have oversized portions, so\n\ntaking home leftovers is a great idea.\n\n10. Check the menu ahead of time. Most menus are online at this point, so you can always check out a menu beforehand to see the types of\n\noptions they have that will work for you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/bzg5ho/how_to_order_at_restaurants_without_ruining_your/", "created_utc": 1560277258.0, "score": 172, "author": "racheleatsright", "num_comments": 39, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/bzg5ho/how_to_order_at_restaurants_without_ruining_your/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Cooking healthy(ish) food throughout the week: A guide", "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nThis subreddit has been really helpful to me over the past years, and I've (hopefully) finally found a way to give back. The goal of this post is to give you an example of meals you can make throughout the week that are tasty, not too time consuming, and are (fairly) nutritionally healthy. This is **NOT** a guide to meal prepping--I like to cook a different meal 3-4 times a week, with each meal containing two servings so that I can bring the second serving for lunch the next day. None of these meals should take more than an hour to cook. I'm a graduate student, which means I get to make my own schedule, so I always make sure to have this time in my schedule. If you cannot make this time, I would either stop reading here, or figure out how to turn this into a meal-prep. These also make up the **majority** of the meals for the week--not all of them.  This is also **NOT** for those on a limited food budget. I'm lucky that my graduate program pays me a more than livable stipend, but I also spend the vast majority of my non-rent money on food. \n\n**On portion size and macronutrients**\n\nI am a 5'8\" 180lb male. I lift 3-4 times a week, and do conditioning 2 times a week. My goal is somewhere between light weight loss to maintenance--I have lost 15 lbs in the past few months using a similar diet. You'll notice the dinners don't have carbs, which is due to me wanting to go for a higher protein-low carb diet. If you want more carbs, but the same calories, sub out some of the protein, and add a serving of rice, sweet potatoes, or whatever your carb of choice is. These can be cooked separately and doesn't impact the rest of this post. I don't provide calorie or macronutrient estimates for these meals (although if someone does, I'm sure those who need those calculations would be  very happy). I find that these meals provide sufficient energy for my work and fitness activities, and I don't feel like I'm deprived of any nutrients.\n\n**Kitchen supplies you should get**\n\n* Cast iron pan\n* Spatula\n* Large roasting pan\n* 9x13 pan\n* Parchment paper\n* Instant read thermometer--highly recommend [this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021AEAG2/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This will really help you with your cooking if you know how to use it!\n* Staples: Olive oil, canola oil, unsalted butter, **kosher** salt, pepper (get whole pepper in a grinder)\n* General spices: Cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, etc...--these will last you a while, so I do not place them in my weekly grocery list \n\n**List of meals for the week**\n\nI do my grocery shopping on Sunday afternoon, so this is starting on Sunday dinner. My lab provides me with lunch on Thursday, so note that I prepare around this. Note that other than Sunday dinner, I don't provide meals for the weekend. I don't want to plan my life to that extent, so it's usually a combination of runs to the grocery store to cook something new and more time consuming, or going out to eat. I'm sure you all can figure this out for yourselves.\n\n* Daily breakfast: Breakfast tacos!\n* Sunday dinner/Monday lunch: Baked chicken parmesan and roasted carrots\n* Monday dinner/Tuesday lunch: Salmon and roasted asparagus\n* Tuesday dinner/Wednesday lunch/Friday lunch: Chili\n* Wednesday dinner: Chicken apple sausages with veggies\n* Thursday dinner/Friday dinner: Pork chops and broccoli\n\nThe rest of this post is organized by meal--what I buy on my weekly shopping trip for that meal, and how to make it (if a recipe is not provided). \n\n**Breakfast tacos**\n\nTo buy:\n\n* 24 eggs (I use 4 eggs each morning, adjusted as needed)  \n* A package of bacon\n* 4 bell peppers (mix it up with the colors!)\n* Cheese (I buy a package of shredded Mexican cheese, since I'm lazy)\n* Tortillas\n* Salsa (or whatever condiment you want)\n\nTo prep:\n\n* On Sunday, pre-heat oven to 400. While you're waiting, chop your bell peppers, and put them in a ziplock bag.\n* After you're done chopping, take a large roasting pan, and cover it in **TWO** layers of aluminum foil. Lay all of your bacon in a single layer on the pan, put it in the oven for 15-20 minutes, depending on how crispy you want the bacon\n* After the bacon cools, chop it up, and throw it in another ziplock bag. \n\nTo cook:\n\n* Wake up, start making coffee\n* Heat a pan (I highly recommend getting a nice non-stick pan) to medium with a bit of canola oil. Throw in a handful of the pre-chopped peppers, stir occasionally. \n* While this is going on, whisk 4 eggs in a bowl. Don't be lazy and just throw your eggs in the pan, pre-whisking the eggs makes scrambled eggs better\n* After your happy with the peppers, throw in your desired amount of bacon and let it cook for about a minute. While this is going on, you can throw a tortilla on a plate, cover it with the desired amount of cheese, and microwave for 25-30 seconds\n* Finally, time to cook the eggs. Lower heat to medium-low, pour in whisked eggs from bowl. Stir CONSTANTLY, taking pan on-and-off heat as needed. If you want to scramble eggs better, watch [this video from Gordon Ramsey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0). \n* When the eggs are properly cooked, dump the mixture on your cheese-tortilla, put on the desired condiments, and enjoy. This whole process should not take more than 10-15 minutes, and it's worth waking up a bit earlier for a nice breakfast.\n\n**Baked chicken parmesan and roasted carrots**\n\nThis makes two servings--one for dinner, and one for lunch.\n\nTo buy:\n\n* 1-1.5 lbs chicken thighs (or breasts)\n* Mozzarella cheese\n* Marinara sauce\n* Breadcrumbs (this will last you a while if you decide to make this in future weeks)\n* 4 whole carrots\n\nTo cook:\n\n* Preheat oven to 425. Make sure you have room for both the roasting pan, and the smaller pan (9x13 or so) you will be using for the chicken\n* If the carrots are thick, cut in half lengthwise. Cut carrots diagonally in 1/2-1 inch long pieces, mix with a tbsp or so of olive oil, and desired amount of kosher salt and pepper. One of the keys to cooking is learning how much salt to put on things, so you should experiment with and get a feel for this.\n* Put a layer of parchment paper on a roasting pan, and throw carrots on this. The parchment paper makes for super easy clean-up after.\n* Prep chicken as written by [this recipe](https://www.skinnytaste.com/baked-chicken-parmesan/)\n* Throw carrots and chicken in at the same time. You'll want to check if they're done after 25 minutes (the carrots will probably take around 30). The chicken is done when the internal temp is over 165 (use your instant-read thermometer!). The carrots are done when you can easily pierce a fork through them. If you want to be fancy, chop up a bit of dill and throw them on the carrots after they're done roasting.\n\n**Roasted salmon and asparagus**\n\nThis makes two servings--one for dinner, and one for lunch.\n\nTo buy:\n\n* Two 1/2 lb salmon filets\n* A bunch of asparagus\n\nTo cook:\n\n* Preheat oven to 425\n* Put parchment paper on roasting pan. Break off bottoms of asparagus stems with your hands (there's a natural breaking point, and you can do this in two or three handfuls, depending on how thick the asparagus is). \n* Mix asparagus with olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper. Lay on a single layer in roasting pan. This will bake for 15 minutes in the oven. If you want to make this tastier, throw some shredded parmesan cheese on top.\n* Right after putting asparagus in oven, heat your cast-iron pan over medium-high. Put 3 tbsp of butter in the pan. \n* **Important**--use a paper towel to dry off the skins of the salmon filets. This will make them crispier\n* Once pan is hot and butter has stopped foaming, throw both filets in a single layer on the pan, skin-side down. Put kosher salt and pepper (again, you'll have to experiment with how much) on the salmon. As the skin cooks in the butter, start spooning the butter over the top of the salmon. This whole step will be about 2-3 minutes, depending on how crispy you like the skin. DON'T let the skin burn\n* Put cast iron pan in the oven. After 6-7 minutes, check the temperature using your instant-read thermometer in the middle of the thickest part of the salmon. You want this to be 125 F (or at least I do). Find the temperature that works right for you. If it's not there, check in another minute or two--salmon cooks quickly. \n* Once the salmon hits the right temperature, take it out, and let rest for a couple minutes. If you time this right, you can finish the salmon and asparagus at exactly the same time\n\n**Chili**\n\nThis makes 3-4 servings--I prefer to use as one dinner, and two lunches.\n\nTo buy:\n\n* 1-2 yellow onions\n* Bulb of garlic (optional, I prefer to just use garlic powder)\n* 1-1.5 lbs ground beef (I like 80/20)\n* 1 can crushed tomatoes\n* 1 can beans\n* Either 2 ears fresh corn, or a bag of frozen corn (depending on season)\n* Lime\n\nTo prep:\n\n* I like to chop up the onions on Sunday night and keep them in a ziplock bag. This saves a bit of time and clean-up before cooking\n\nTo cook:\n\n* Follow [this recipe](https://www.mensfitness.com/nutrition/what-to-eat/best-chili-recipe-athletes). Note you'll need cumin and chili powder on hand. I choose not to throw in the chocolate, since I have before, and it didn't make any difference. I also choose not to put rice in at the end. I usually sub frozen corn for fresh corn, and garlic powder for the garlic clove--I believe its 1/8 tsp garlic powder per clove. \n\n**Chicken apple sausage and veggie**\n\nThis is my lazy meal for the week, as I usually just heat up frozen vegetables. However, I'll be nice, and provide an easy way to cook up Brussels sprouts.\n\nTo buy:\n\n* Package of chicken apple sausage\n* Veggies (your choice, either fresh to roast/have raw, or frozen). If you're doing Brussels sprouts, buy a bag of Brussels sprouts\n\nTo prep:\n\n* If you want, you can prep the Brussels sprouts. Cut off the stems, then slice in half length-wise. This can be a bit tedious, but it's worth it.\n\nTo cook:\n\n* Preheat oven to 400\n* Saute chicken apple sausage on the stovetop. You can't mess this up. \n* Use your cast-iron pan and follow [this Brussels sprouts recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1890-roasted-brussels-sprouts-with-garlic). I've done this without garlic, and it's fine. I highly recommend adding the balsamic in at the end, along with some honey.\n\n**Pork chops and broccoli**\n\nI make two servings--one for dinner, one for lunch\n\nTo buy:\n\n* Two pork chops, bone-in\n* Two broccoli crowns \n\nTo prep:\n\n* You can cut broccoli florets ahead of time, and store them in a zip-lock bag.\n\nTo cook:\n\n* Preheat oven to 400\n* Put parchment paper on a roasting pan (sensing a theme here?). You can guess what comes next--mix broccoli with olive oil, salt, pepper, and roast for 20 minutes.\n* When you put broccoli in oven, heat cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Take out the pork chops, and pat them dry with paper towel. Salt (kosher!) and pepper both sides. \n* When pan is close to smoking, add a decent amount of canola/vegetable oil. Put pork chops in single layer on pan for 3 minutes or so, until bottom is golden brown. Flip pork chops over, put pan in oven\n* Pork chops should be 145 (again, thermometer should be in middle of the thickest part) when you take them out--overcooked pork chops are terrible, so really watch this.  Start checking after 4-6 minutes, depending on pork chop thickness. \n* Let pork chops rest 5-10 minutes. Again, I can usually time this so everything is ready at the same time\n\n**Summary**\n\nI provided a list of meals I like to make each week that are healthy, tasty, and help me meet my fitness goals. Each meal has a list of things to buy, and pretty details cooking instructions. These meals can make up the bulk of your food for the week. Everything can be adjusted depending on your nutritional goals. I would love improvements, suggestions, and any other comments/questions.

{"title": "Healthy Eggs Benedict Recipe (High Protein)", "selftext": "[Quick Pic!](http://i.imgur.com/CsmNlL8.jpg)\n\nMade these last night for my girlfriend and I (Serves 2) and honestly they were pretty good so here's the recipe: \n\nHealthy Hollaindaise Sauce:\n* 80g Fat Free Greek Yoghurt\n* 1/4 Tsp Dijon Mustard\n* 1 Egg Yolk\n* Sprig of Parsley \n* Pinch of Pepper\n* 1/2 Tsp Lemon Juice\n* Pinch of Salt\n\nThe Muffins, Turkey and Eggs: \n* 2 English Muffins \n* 4 Rashers of Turkey Bacon\n* 4 Eggs\n* Dash of White Vinegar \n\nMethod: \nFirst make the delicious sauce by expertly creating a double boiler, if you're a student like me then find a random bowl and balance that in a sieve over some simmering water. Beat together your egg yolk, yoghurt and lemon juice then add to the bowl in your double boiler, it took abut 10 minutes to thicken up for me. Mix in the mustard, pepper, a little parsley and maybe some salt and your sauce is finished. Keep this sauce nice and warm somewhere and move on to the main event.\n \nCut your muffins in half then toast them then move on to your poached eggs. If you've never poached eggs before then you wanna take the water from your double boiler earlier (which will still be nice and hot) add in a little white vinegar and give it a swirl, pour your egg into the center of this swirl and wait 3-5 minutes depending on how you like your yolk. Repeat this 3 more times and place the poached eggs on top of the muffin. Lightly fry off the turkey rashers and add those to the top of your poached eggs then drizzle the sauce over the top.

{"title": "My \"healthy\" Subway sandwich concoction for those of you who forgot your lunch today.", "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I know there will be at least 3 comments saying \"subway sux\" in some form or another. I *completely* agree with you. That's why healthy is in quotes. I *worked* at subway for over a year back in high school. I was also a wrestler, and as such it was a challenge to not have a sub that was terrible for me so I could make weight. Plus being behind the counter really illustrates how shitty all the food items are. By no means am I saying Subway is healthy fast food, its not.\n\nWith that said, I forgot my lunch today, so that left me with little options. I could go hungry, but screw that. That left me with buying, and within a radius of walking/bus distance there's little healthy options. Compared to McDonalds and the like, I choose Subway. \n\nI settled on a 6\" sub. I had some spare time at the office looking up Subway's nutritional information off their website, and cross referenced with what I could find on myfitnesspal. \n\nFinally, here's the sub:\n* Honey Oat Bread\n* Oven Roasted Chicken Breast (double meat)\n* Shredded Mozzerella Cheese\n* Lettuce\n* Spinach \n* Bannana Peppers\n* Oil & Vinegar\n\nThat comes to 512 calories. Total Fat: 16g, Carbs: 52g, 5 of em being fiber thanks to the honey oat bread. Protein is a solid 39g.\n\nIs it gonna replace a well-engineered meal at home? Again, of course not.  But this seemed to be a solid alternative. This is coming from a person who has just started trying to eat and exercise well, an already decently-in shape college student who has yet to buy protein powder (gasp). So this may not be for you. But if you forgot your lunch and are trying to get a solid helping of protein from fast food without swimming in calories or desecrating your macro goals, hopefully you can settle on this little compromise.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/27aqsn/my_healthy_subway_sandwich_concoction_for_those/", "created_utc": 1401896153.0, "score": 164, "author": "dsolimeno93", "num_comments": 85, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/27aqsn/my_healthy_subway_sandwich_concoction_for_those/", "html_title": ""}

Hope you guys love this meal prep as much as I do! \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nBARBOCOA:\n\n1-2 tbsp olive oil \n\n3.2lb chuck steak\n\n\u00bd red onion \n\n4-5 cloves garlic \n\n1 lime \n\n1/2 canned chipotle pepper minced \n\n1 tsp cumin \n\n2 tsp chili powder \n\n1 tsp paprika \n\n1/4 cup rice vinegar \n\n6 oz diced hunts tomatoes\n\n1 cup beef broth \n\nSIDES:\n\nCorn: 1 bag (frozen) sweet corn \n\nCilantro Lime Rice: 2 cups calrose or basmati rice, 1 juiced lime, ~1/4 cup cilantro\n\nBeans: 2 cans Black Beans (substitute: kidney beans or great northern beans)\n\nChipotle Pepper Salsa\n\nOptional: Avocado\n\nRECIPE:\n\nDice up garlic and onion & set aside. \n\nAdd 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil to Instant Pot and brown meat with the \u201cSaute\u201d setting.\n\nOnce your meat is browned, turn off the Instant Pot and add the following ingredients (aka basically everything): chopped onion, diced garlic, hunts diced tomatoes, beef broth, chipotle peppers, cumin, paprika, chili powder, rice vinegar and juice 1 lime. Mix it all up and turn the Instant Pot back on to \u201cManual\u201d mode for 44 minutes.\n\nWhile your barbocoa is cooking, start making the rice!\n\nCook 2 cups of rice on the stove as you normally would, then add 1 juiced lime and about \u00bc cup of cilantro, adding more as you wish. Set this aside.\n\nAs the meat is about finished, rinse your beans and optionally, season with salt & pepper, set aside. Put your sweet corn into a bowl, set aside. Once your barbocoa is done cooking, do a quick release (takes about 6 minutes), then turn on the \u201cSaute\u201d setting. Let your sauce cook down to about \u00bd of what it is currently. \n\nPop your frozen corn & beans into microwave or use the stove to heat them up. \n\nOnce your barbocoa sauce is cooked down (about 5 ish minutes), put into another bowl to shred. Serve your rice, beans, corn and freshly made barbocoa into a bowl, top with avocado, chipotle pepper salsa, and a lime quarter for the most delicious meal ever.\n\nFYI: This made 6 meals for me, using the following breakdown: 130g rice, 60g black bean, 50g corn, 1 tablespoon chipotle pepper salsa & the meat breakdown below. As discussed in the video, meat cooked with sauces is hard to determine macros so I took the full barbocoa recipe and divided it by the 6 meals:\n\nMACROS:\n\nBarbocoa (with no sides): 397 cal | 15.3g fat | 8.3g carb | 50g protein\n\nSides:\n\nRice (basmati): 157 cal | 0.5 fat | 32.8 carb | 4.6g protein \n\nCorn: 56 cal | 0.6g fat | 11.7g carb| 1.7g protein\n\nBeans: 55 cal | 0.2g fat | 10.6g carb | 3.2g protein \n\nChipotle Pepper Salsa: 5 cal | 1g carb\n\nFull Meal Macros: 670 cal | 16.6g fat | 64.4 carb | 59.5g protein\n\n[Video]( https://youtu.be/JqPfXRm-1-0) of the recipe & how-to\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/7z3gpv/chipotle_barbocoa_bowls/", "created_utc": 1519193989.0, "score": 161, "author": "paige_cor", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/7z3gpv/chipotle_barbocoa_bowls/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Two recipes that will make you love your oatmeal", "selftext": "Hi, I saw a post yesterday about making oatmeal taste good, and I have been working up two savory oatmeal recipes. I had trouble with the idea that oatmeal could be good without sweet flavors, but it actually works much better. My fianc\u00e9e is addicted to these!\nEDIT: these are as fast as regular oatmeal or an omelette, but a LOT healthier than sweetened oats!\n\n\n1) \"Asian\" Peanut Oatmeal \n\n1 1/2 cups water\n\n1 cup rolled oats\n\n1/4 cup cashews, raw\n\nTwo sprigs fresh cilantro\n\n1/4 cup peanut butter\n\n1 tablespoon soy sauce, low sodium\n\n1/4 teaspoon cumin\n\n1/4 teaspoon paprika or cayenne\n\n1 tablespoon sriracha (optional)\n\n\nStep 1: Boil the water in a sauce pan. Add the oats and reduce heat to low. Add cashews and cover, stirring frequently, till all water is evaporated.\n\nStep 2: In a small bowl, mix the remaining ingredients, adding a little vegetable oil if it is too hard or dry. Mix it into oatmeal and serve.\n\n(That's it. It's based on Pad Thai. As you can see, it's cheap and fast. For more kick, add grated ginger and garlic.)\n\n\n2) \"Italian\" Aglio e oglio oatmeal\n\n1 1/2 cups water\n\n1 cup rolled oats\n\n1 clove garlic, finely minced\n\n1/2 cup kale\n\n1/4 cup low fat Kraft mozzarella, shredded\n\n1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\n\n2 teaspoons olive oil\n\nTwo sprigs parsley\n\n\nStep 1: Same oatmeal process as above, minus cashews. \n\nStep 2: Once oatmeal is cooked down, heat olive oil on high heat in a fry pan. When it ripples slightly, add oatmeal. It should sizzle! Add kale, cheese, red pepper flakes and garlic and cook for a minute, stirring a few times to prevent sticking. Add parsley and serve. \n\n\nThat's it. A couple final pointers. Oatmeal is great if treated like brown rice or noodles. It is a similar flavor profile. Would you add banana or syrup to that profile? You could, and it might taste fine. But many of us prefer salty/spicy flavors to that. So have fun!\nA note on texture: mixing in flaxseed and chia are tried and true ways to make the texture much more complex and interesting. A final tip if you hate soft mushy oats, TOAST them first! Fry up a dollop of smart balance and toss the oats on top. When they get harder and a little brown, cook them as usual in the water. They'll taste nuttier and be less gloppy.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEDIT: \"ass\" to \"add\".

{"title": "Recipe: Anabolic buttermilk oat pancakes", "selftext": "[Three 8\" pancakes](https://i.redd.it/20he6dr7lhf51.jpg)\n\nI've been searching for a buttermilk pancake that has less calories and more protein than Kodiak's buttermilk pancake mix. After a lot of trial and error this is what I came up with:\n\nYield:\n\n* Three 8\" pancakes\n\n* Six 5-6\" pancakes\n\n* Twelve 4\" pancakes\n\nMacros: 612 calories, 75 g protein. You can halve the recipe and get three 5-6\" pancakes for 306 calories and 38 g protein.\n\nCompared to Kodiak cake mix (three 4\" pancakes vs three 4\" pancakes, same thickness):\n\n* 153 calories vs 190 calories\n\n* 19 g protein vs 14 g protein\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 scoops (58 g) unflavored whey protein isolate\n\n* 1/2 cup (50 g) old fashioned oats: 190 calories, 6 g protein\n\n* 1/4 cup (61 g) egg whites: 33 calories, 7 g protein\n\n* 1/4 cup low fat (2%) cottage cheese: 45 calories, 5 g protein\n\n* 1 cup low fat (1.5%) buttermilk: 120 calories, 9 g protein\n\n* 1 Tbsp sugar equivalent, optional. I used a monkfruit/erythritol blend.\n\n* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, optional\n\n* 1 tsp baking powder: 2 calories\n\n* 1/2 tsp baking soda\n\n* 1/8 tsp xanthan gum, probably optional: 1 calorie\n\n* sugar free syrup for topping (not included in the macros)\n\nSubstitutions:\n\n* You can swap the unflavored protein powder, sweetener, and vanilla extract for vanilla protein powder.\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Grind the oats into flour. Or just use oat flour in the first place.\n\n2. Mix all the dry ingredients together.\n\n3. Blend the cottage cheese with the buttermilk. Then add the egg whites to the liquid mixture.\n\n4. Heat up your pan to medium-low heat. I did 3 on my stove which goes from 1 to 9. Water should sizzle when dropped on the pan but not ball up.\n\n5. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Avoid overmixing. The batter will look thin at first, but the oat flour needs a bit of time to soak up the liquid. If the batter looks too thick add more buttermilk (this will affect the macros) or some water.\n\nAs far as cooking the pancakes go, the bubbles don't quite reach the top so it's hard to tell when they're ready to flip. I just peak at the underside of the pancake when the bottom half of looks stable. The pancakes are relatively easy to flip and shouldn't make a mess if you're careful.\n\nAlso I created /r/AnabolicEating for people interested in low calorie dense and high protein recipes/foods.

And it's somewhat customizable to your preferences and provides that combined grocery list. Unfortunately it costs $144-240/year, depending on how much you pay up front, which is outside of my price range as a student.\n\nJust wondering if you guys had any ideas for similar services that might be a little cheaper as my search has been fruitless so far.

As the meat begins to brown, stir in the onions and garlic. Continue cooking until the meat has fully browned and onions are tender. If there is a lot of excess grease, drain.\n\nStir in the Rotel, water, tomato sauce, beans, chipotle peppers, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir in the seasonings. Adjust to taste.\n\nCover and cook over medium-high heat until it reaches a boil. Boil a couple minutes, reduce heat, and simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Makes 4 portions that you can serve immediately or store in sturdy freezer bags and freeze. To reheat, place bag in room temp or cool water to thaw, then microwave contents of the bag in a bowl for around 2-3 minutes.\n\n1 serving with this recipe comes to 493 kcal and 58 g. protein. With a couple spoonfuls of light sour cream and about 1/4 cup of grated Colby jack cheese, it comes to 623 kcal and 67 g. protein. I used nonfat unflavored Greek yogurt instead of sour cream once to empty my fridge and it turned out pretty well too, and my girlfriend turned me on to adding a handful of Fritos on top.\n\nSwitching from 80% lean to 95% lean ground beef saves around 200 calories but loses a lot of the flavor, so I adjusted with the Worcestershire sauce and leaned heavily on spice.

{"title": "Ya Want Protein Pancakes? FINE! I'll Give Ya Protein Pancakes.", "selftext": "This recipe is for those people who are a) on the fence about protein recipes pretending to be normal recipes or b) people who struggle to get enough protein in a day without hastily shovelling in the chalkiest, most plastic-flavoured protein brick at 3pm because they can't face another bite of husked-out \"juicy\" baked chicken breast. I'd say you COULD meal-prep these, but they do deflate a little, so be prepared to them to be slightly less exciting and \"pancake stack\"-like the next day. Another thing \\[goddamn, this is starting to look like a white-lady-from-New-York-City-blog-post\\]: don't waste your money running out to buy something just because you think the thing you have in the fridge isn't \"the right one\". Make it work and chill out. You don't have to have protein powder - make oat flour instead. You don't have to have protein yoghurt. I've done this with cottage cheese, I've done it with thin natural yoghurt, and I've done it with protein yoghurt. It's fiiiiiiiiiiine.\n\nONTO THE SHOW!\n\n***EDITED TO ADD MACROS AND SUCH:***\n\n***For the whole serving, MFP gave me a readout of approx. 500 calories, 64g protein, for a quite high-yield protein powder and yoghurt.*** YMMV. Also, I used Macro Mike's White Choc Malt protein powder. It's the best non-dairy/plant-based protein powder I've tried, and BOY have I suffered through many. It doesn't taste chalky, it doesn't feel like you're eating plasterboard, and it has quite a strong flavour profile. Upsides: mixes well, doesn't get chalky, doesn't taste like you're eating the box your baking powder came in. Downsides: It's expensive, no matter where you are, and unless you're specifically looking for that, MOST of the Macro Mike protein powders have a bit of a peanut butter flavour tint to them, because their products are based on peanut, almond, pea and fava bean proteins. \n\n**WHAT:**\n\n**1 x single serve tub your favourite protein yoghurt.** I used Iskey vanilla bean \\[96 cals per 170g tub, 17g protein\\]\n\n**\\~50-100 ml optional liquid, to loosen batter if needed** \\- water, milk, mylk, meeyelk, whatever creamy substance \\[that's what sh---NO!\\] you refer to in this instance. Only add if blending doesn't get you to go, \"oooh! it looks like pancake batter!\"\n\n**\\~80g or 1 loose metric cup protein powder** \\[none of your freedom eagle nonsense here. We're metric, baby. Google the conversion to your weird Imperial ways.\\]\n\n**2 eggs** \\[omg yes you can use egg whites or flax eggs or murloc eggs or whatever you want calm down\\]\n\n**1 very enthusiastic teaspoon baking powder**\n\n**Splash of vanilla if you have it** \\[it's fiiiiine if you don't\\]\n\n**A sneeze of cinnamon** \\[optional\\]\n\nToppings: fresh cut fruit, sugar free or not sugar free maple syrup, lemon sugar, nutella, you do you, kid. I believe in you. Go wild.\n\nThere are three steps to this recipe. If you fuck up three steps, I don't know what to tell you. Maybe call your parents?\n\n**HOW:**\n\n1. Place all ingredients in a blender cup, making sure that the liquid stuff is closest to the blades - whether that means you go powder first or yoghurt first requires your stellar powers of deduction, friendo. Are your blender blades separate to the cup? Great! Go powder-first. Does your blender cup have the blades attached to it? Wheeeee! Add your liquids first.\n2. Blend. What did you think I was going to say? Go to iHop?\n3. Heat your favourite frying implement on LOW, YOU IMPATIENT WRETCH. DON'T FUCK THIS ONE UP. Lube up your pan if needed, and pour in some of your batter to a size that makes you happy. Wait for bubbles to appear on the edges before you flip and remove to a warm plate, or straight into your face. Repeat until PANCAKES.\n\nIn the photos, I've topped mine with some sugar free fake maple-intended syrup, and buffalo yoghurt. I did not let the batter rest for long enough, so mine came out quite thin, but it doesn't impact anything, really. Not pictured: the two kiwifruit I also inhaled as I ate these. These aren't terribly sweet, but if you chew thoughtfully and slowly and don't snorgle them into your gullet like a seagull, you'll find they're quite moreish, they taste 80% the part, and chew pretty much the way pancakes do.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tl79gu15yvve1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ffc4e4de87c9fdf522d2cc47bcfe917a1c7018\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40bc7nz4yvve1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d9a78a79891be602bfeefa18edb335a12e031b4\n\nGOOD LUCK, SOLDIER.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1k3aksd/ya_want_protein_pancakes_fine_ill_give_ya_protein/", "created_utc": 1745109493.0, "score": 48, "author": "Timely--Challenge", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1k3aksd/ya_want_protein_pancakes_fine_ill_give_ya_protein/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Added half a bottle of white wine and better than bouillon to a small pot. Brought to a simmer to cook off alcohol. You can tell this is the case when it gets to around 200 F or hotter.\n\n2. Loosely wrapped garlic cloves in tin foil and roasted for 20 min at 400 f. Allowed to sit in cooling oven until needed.\n\n3. Combined reduced wine mix with spinach in big pot and cooked until all soft, but still green (don\u2019t overcook and watch out for splashing liquid while mixing in). Moved spinach to another bowl and covered for later use. Kept the excess spinach water in pot as the base of the soup/broth.\n\n4. Added 1 liter of water to pot, along with fresh bay leaves, thyme, and sage. Simmered on low medium heat while doing the next step.\n\n5. Prepared / cut onions, celery, and carrots.\n\n6. Removed all herbs from pot and discarded after about 20-25 minutes.\n\n7. Added onions, celery, and carrots to broth - also mushed up the roasted garlic and added that too. Brought to a gentle simmer/boil and allowed to cook. Add water as needed to keep vegetables submerged.\n\n8. Prepped bell peppers and added to pot.\n\n9. Prepped green squash/zucchini and added to pot\n\n10. Prepped cherry tomatoes and added to pot.\n\n11. Rinsed red lentils and added to pot, stirred in thoroughly.\n\n12. Sliced up mushrooms, added some salt and seasoning, and saut\u00e9d in pan with a light amount of avocado oil spray. Added mushrooms and excess water / flavor to the soup.\n\n13. Add in the spinach, bring to 165 F for food safety and then take off heat.\n\n14. Finishing touches: add fresh basil and parsley, spices (garlic, black pepper, hot sauces (I like Bhutila Fire - half a bottle). Also salt if necessary.\n\nAt this point you can portion out the soup, I use stackman 1 pint containers, which store well in the freezer.\n\nTo prepare the soup on a meal basis, I empty 1 pint into a small pot and bring to a simmer. Then I add in one whole egg and allow it to cook/poach in the soup.\n\nOnce it\u2019s all hot and the egg is cooked, I take it off the heat, add in the olive oil and heavy cream and gently stir around.

(Save the excess water/broth from the spinach and mushrooms!)\n\nAlso, you want the spinach to be mushy but still have a vibrant deep green color, it should not be brown.\n\n  \n4. in a huge pot, add the excess broth from the mushrooms and spinach, then fill with more water until around a total volume of about 4.4 Liters or 4400 grams on a scale. Put on high heat to bring to a simmer then lower heat to maintain simmer for about 20 minutes, you can start prepping other ingredients during this stage. Throw in roasted garlic and as a bonus, any parmesan or hard cheese rind you might have (it infuses the broth/soup with a delicious savory flavor). I also add some blackened garlic and bay leaves but this is all extra.\n\n  \n5. Once the water has been simmering for some time, carefully skim the broth to remove the cheese rind and bay leaves before continuing, as they will be difficult to locate after the next step.\n\n  \n6. Thoroughly rinse and add 880 grams of dry red lentils. You can use an other lentil of your choosing, but the red ones soak up enough of the base broth so that draining it is not necessary.\n\n  \n7. At the same time, add in 2 pounds or 900 grams fresh cherry tomatoes. (if you want them softer you can even add them a little before the lentils).\n\n  \n8. Stir until the lentils soften and soak up a majority of the broth (around 15-20 minutes). They won't soak up all of it, but should be close to the surface and easily visible when stirring.\n\n  \n9. Add the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and continue cooking on low heat for another 5-10 min.\n\n  \n10. I really like adding Trader Joe's Garden Vegetable Soup. It's probably not necessary. But I will empty 3 jars of it into a bowl, add garlic and onion powder, along with hot sauce to spice it up until it tastes pretty good. It's alright if it get's pretty spicy as it will be diluted. I usually add around half a bottle or 90 grams of Bhutila Fire Hot Sauce - Chile Lengua de Fuego. But you can use another hot sauce of your choosing or none at all. Once you've got that mix ready, add it to the pot and stir in.\n\n  \n11. I also really like to cut up and add 1-3 jars of Trader Joe's roasted red peppers. You can also roast some yourself but I find this shortcut approach saves a lot of time and doesn't really cost much.\n\n\n\n12. Raise the heat to bring the water to a simmer again, or around 170-180 degrees for food safety.\n\n\n\n13. Add the blanched spinach and briefly bring to around 165+ degrees Fahrenheit for safety, then remove from heat. We don't want to overcook the spinach.\n\n  \n14. Add extra virgin olive oil to your taste preference. I like to add 45 grams to the bulk prep. I also threw in some fresh basil.\n\n  \n15.

{"title": "Best meals or snacks to eat after running or gym at night or salsa?", "selftext": "I work all day, box gym only public opens 7PM. Lately, I\u2019ve been training around 9PM after dinner, finishing by 11:30 PM. My issue is I wake up too early, often feeling like I\u2019ve only had two REM cycles. Even when I sleep until 9-10 AM. I sleep in but I suspect my body clock picks up the sunlight even through my cold dark room, disrupting anything, it would feel like it's just a long light sleep. Some nights, I barely get 3-4 hours of sleep, leading to brain fog all day. I've got my friend to look into the room, says it's good enough, blackout curtains, white noise, balanced temps.\n\nSo it just ends up in a cycle, conceding to naps or having a late coffee. Same issue happens with salsa nights. Intense cardio keeps me wired, home by 1am or even 2aM. I think I burn through my first energy reserve, then tap into a second, which keeps me awake unless I fully exhaust it. Oddly, staying out later (like on salsa nights past 2:30 AM) helps me sleep better. Same goes with hitting the bags, but in salsa, I'd atleast have many multple ~~sparring~~ dance partners, staying sharp and focused on combinations, but on a gently don't hurt anyone version. But just like boxing, I love it.\n\nLate-night workouts are my only option in an expensive city where gyms and venues mostly open at night, because they can also only afford to open at night. Has anyone found a routine that works? Do you eat after training, or skip it? Curious how others manage this lifestyle. it's more to do with cardio, I find that lifting or bulking I can get normal sleep patterns and can even lift 1 hour and eat a light snack then sleep after 2 hours easily. \n\nI think the issue here is inconsistency, I guess just build up a natural pattern and take things such as supplements (creatine, fish oil etc) in the AM and nothing at all in the PM. \n\nBut I'm still wondering what makes me wake up way too early. It's sort of annoying feeling pumped and good the first few hours of waking up, knowing that I've only probably got 1-2 quality REM and the rest of the PM day will be brutal. What's your routine like? Do you still eat after a night workout? I'm in the lightweight category of things if that matters.\n\nOr should I even eat at all right after getting home?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1izt4ic/best_meals_or_snacks_to_eat_after_running_or_gym/", "created_utc": 1740697281.0, "score": 1, "author": "massiel_islas", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1izt4ic/best_meals_or_snacks_to_eat_after_running_or_gym/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Cocoa Sweet Potatoes with Ghee Recipe", "selftext": "This is my favorite sweet treat/dessert portion of a meal while dieting as it provides a good source of healthy carbs and tastes like brownies to me. \n\n\nI take a whole sack of sweet potatoes from Costco and thoroughly scrub with a potato brush.\n\n\nThen I wrap each in tin foil and bake at 400 degrees F for around 1-1.5 hours, thought the big potato here took about 2.5 hours\u2026\n\n\nAfter they\u2019ve cooled a bit I tear off the fibrous ends and then separate out the peels and flesh of each potato into large bowls. It\u2019s at this point that I take the weight of the flesh and skins before proceeding.\n\n\nI usually aim for 150-200 grams of potato flesh per serving and then divide up the skins equally for each serving. In this prep I had around 1450 g of flesh, so enough for around 9-10 servings.\n\n\nYou can scale how you want, but personally I find 5 grams of cocoa and 5 grams of ghee per serving makes for a great chocolatey flavor profile. So for this prep I added 50 grams of cocoa and 50 grams of ghee into the bowl, along with a tablespoon of cinnamon, then mashed the whole thing up. It smells really good at this point. \n\n\nFinally I divide into reusable tubs that are microwave and dishwasher safe. For this prep I added about 155 g of chocolate mash to each tub, then topped with around 20 g of peels in each (had about 200 g of peels in total).\n\n\nI recommend putting these in the fridge overnight, as that allows the starch to turn into \u201cresistant\u201d starch, which just means it has more soluble-fiber like properties, it also improves the consistency in my opinion.\n\n\nThey stay good in the fridge for a couple days, but you can also freeze them, then pull them out and thaw overnight in the fridge as needed for a meal prep schedule (I usually have one per day on exercise days). I\u2019ll have it as a dessert at the end of a  meal complete with plenty of veggies and high quality protein. To prep it I just scarf down the peels (it\u2019s really not bad but let me know if you have a better suggestion on how to make use of them) and then microwave and mix the mash until it\u2019s piping hot.\n\n\nHere are the macros for this prep (per serving): 212 calories, 4 g protein, 6 g fat, 37 g carbs (includes resistant starch/fiber).\n\n\nI also included a photo of a typical meal I\u2019d include them in at the end.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixvbro", "created_utc": 1740491101.0, "score": 41, "author": "Its_Shatter", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1ixvbro/cocoa_sweet_potatoes_with_ghee_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The app then takes that as well as a list of ingredients that you have on hand, and maybe a list of ingredients that you like or don\u2019t like. With that information, the app would develop 5 or so options each for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack each day with exact weights of ingredients to use for each meal option. Ideally the app would have the ability to spit out a grocery list to pick up additional things you may need when those days come around but that\u2019s more or less a feature that would come later.\n\nAs long as you choose an option from the app for each meal of the day you\u2019ll hit your daily macro/micros perfectly for peak optimal performance. Effectively you could have any combination, choosing any of the meals in each category each day and no matter what options you chose, you\u2019ll have hit your goals within a small variance window. This app would effectively remove the thinking/calculating and daily struggle we all face with traditional macro tracking apps and having to constantly piece together weird meals to hit your goals by the end of the day.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to do this with multiple AI tools in the past but they\u2019re all pretty clunky and end up spitting out false information. For example, I\u2019ve taken the meals and if I picked an option that ChatGPT generated for each meal in a day I would have over eaten by 700 calories and still not hit my protein goal.\n\nThis would be an absolute game changer in my life and I feel like others would benefit as well. If there\u2019s currently something like this, I\u2019d love to support and get on board. If not, I may begin going down some avenues for the creation of something like this. Any recommendations, feedback, features, challenges you foresee, or tips that would be handy as I begin this would be warmly welcome.\n\nMerry Christmas!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1hi0jsb/app_recommendation_daiky_meal_creator_with_custom/", "created_utc": 1734635562.0, "score": 0, "author": "B-radfromMalibootay", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1hi0jsb/app_recommendation_daiky_meal_creator_with_custom/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Help with hitting my protein and calorie goals", "selftext": "Hi all, I recently started seeing a personal trainer, and as well as the weights and cardio (3x per week) he's also set me a nutrition goal every day of 140g of protein and maximum 2000 calories.\n\nFor context, I'm 37, weigh 14st 12lbs (95kg), work an office job, but also play football, take walks every day and have 2 small kids who keep me fairly active.\n\nI'm struggling with the nutrition goals; I've mainly been eating a vegetarian diet for the last few years as my wife is veggie and it just makes things easier when doing the food shop, but I've quickly come to realise that I'm going to need some meat and fish going forward in order to hit my goals. I've also bought some whey protein to help.\n\nSo the first couple of days, before I bit the bullet and bought the meat, fish and whey, I hit around 70g protein, whilst also struggling to stay under 2000kcal.\n\nToday was my first day with the whey protein, which has helped, but I'm still only at 100g protein.\n\nBelieve me when I say I've done quite a lot of research over the last few days about protein rich foods, and here are some of the outcomes and concerns I have:\n\n* 2000kcal and 140g proten means that I have to try and get in 7g protein for every 100kcal consumed\n* There are not that many foods that meet this ration, outside of meats, fish and protein powder\n* I don't want to have to pack in meat for every meal if I can avoid it. From a budget point of view and trying to keep saturated fats down. Also it's not logistically easy to be cooking all the time, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to meal prep\n* There are obviosuly veggies, pulses and legumes that have lots of protein, but would seem to reqire eating about 300g per meal in order to actually hit that 140g target\n* Eggs, and more specifically egg whites, keep coming up as 'great sources of protein', and at around 10g protein to 45kcal they sound great. But realistically you'd need to eat 100g of egg whites for those 10g of protein - which just doesn't feel like a good enough return.\n* Fruit seems to be almost completely out the window, with most having very little protein value. A lot of recipes I've seen so far, particulalry for breakfast smoothies, recommend a banana, But at around 1.5g of protein for nearly 100kcal, it's rubbish\n\n  \nAnyway, I know plenty of people post their meal plans on here, but I still find I'm struggling with the requirements. Anyone else find this or have any advice?

{"title": "The Ultimate Guilt-Free Protein Brownie: Delicious, Moist, and Low-Calorie! (<= 220 Cals)", "selftext": "[The Final Result of the Brownie (Image)](https://imgur.com/a/c9HeY6i)\n\nRecipe + Calories + Protein are listed below. \n\nI want to give a shoutout to u/boo9817 for the inspiration! I combined suggestions from their posts and other recipes to get this as close to the perfect brownie as possible. Personally, I find many anabolic recipes use oils, butters, and flours that don't feel low-calorie or convenient. Some may taste fine, but I wanted to achieve a better balance and create a brownie that truly tastes delectable, as it should. But I digress. As for the added ingredients, the coffee enhances the chocolate flavor by deepening its richness. Vanilla, a common ingredient in many protein recipes, elevates the overall flavor profile, adding warmth and balance. The egg whites contribute to a slightly cakier texture and add more volume. If you prefer a different texture, feel free to omit them! That being said. here's what is needed for the recipe:\n\n**DRY INGREDIENTS**\n\n3 Tbsp Cocoa Powder\n\nPinch of Salt\n\n2 Tbsp Chocolate Protein Powder (Others work too! I used Salted Caramel Whey Protein Powder, and it worked fine. If your protein contains sodium, like mine, omit the salt.)\n\n1/6 Tsp Baking Powder\n\n2-2\u00bd Tbsp Flour or Oat Fiber\n\n\u00bc cup Erythritol (or sweetener of choice)\n\n1 Tbsp Instant Coffee\n\n**WET INGREDIENTS**\n\n1 Egg White, whipped to stiff peaks (use 2 for a more cake-like consistency)\n\n\u00bd Tsp Vanilla Extract\n\n\u00bd cup Diet Soda (Flavored diet soda seems to pack more flavor. If you don't prefer the taste of soda, opt out for Carbonated Soda)\n\n**(OPTIONAL TOPPING) PB2 GLAZE:**\n\n2 Tbsp PB2 (powdered peanut butter)\n\n1 Tbsp Almond Milk or water (or adjust to reach desired consistency)\n\n1 Tsp powdered sweetener (like powdered erythritol or Swerve)\n\n\u00bd Tsp vanilla extract\n\n\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS (*****Note: Incorporate egg white mixture last as explained in the recipe*****):**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C)\n\n2. Mix dry ingredients: Combine cocoa powder, salt, protein powder, baking powder, flour/oat fiber, erythritol, and instant coffee in a bowl. The coffee\n\n3. Mix the Vanilla and the Diet Soda together and add to dry ingredients. Mix it all together.\n\n4. Whip egg white(s) to stiff peaks, then gently fold into the dry mixture. \n\n5. Bake for 20-30 minutes (Do the toothpick test)\n\n6. Cool slightly before serving.\n\n7.

{"title": "Advice on cooking egg whites to be similar to a boiled eggs whites", "selftext": "So I've been extremely interested in a high protein, low fat, egg salad. Sadly, this is near impossible if you use the egg yolk within the egg for the egg salad. The mayonnaise already adds a decent chunk of fats to the dish. The solution was to get low fat mayo (35 cal a tbsp), but even then, the boiled yolk still is too high in fats. My best solution for this has been to just use the boiled yolk for 1-2 eggs and not use the rest (4-6) eggs boiled yolk. The taste is surprisingly the same still. I have only done this once because I literally have no idea what to do with the left over boiled egg yolks and eat far too many eggs per day to save them.\n\nThe first obvious thing to do, is just buy liquid egg whites.. Well, weeks later and much wasted egg whites later.. it is extremely hard replicating the texture and firmness of the egg whites you get off of boiling an egg compared to using the liquids outside the egg.. I've tried sous vide at various temps and times for the egg whites, I've tried boiling them in a boil safe container, I've tried baking them. They all come out, off.. to a substantial degree.. substantial enough to where it's not enjoyable to eat, it taste like mushed slop when used for egg salad. And not that firm, boiled egg, egg whites texture.\n\nSous vide was my most expermented device for this, it doesn't work well. The main issue is the temperature to cook an egg white in such a way is around 175-195 degrees F, I've tried at 165 for 2 hours and it was horrible. I've tried at 195 for 2 hours and it was decent. I feel like this approach for 195 degrees would work, but I'd need to do smaller bags. I'd need to do about an egg sized bag of whites. When doing a large bag of egg whites at once, it creates a large roll like shape within the bag, and the center just doesn't get that firmness no matter what. I hypothesis that this is because the whites need to be a thinish layer in order to properly firm the way a boiled eggs whites would. The issue is, many small bags (and even larger bags) are not suited to safely be in 185-195 degree temps for long periods of time.. \n\nThe oven was horrible, I feel like this way could be the best but it is so extremely messy. Which would be fine but direct heat blasting on liquid egg whites creates a film of cooked egg whites over the top, and scraping this off/working around this is a nightmare..\n\nBoiling was similar to the sous vide, except easier to mess up/more messy, and was harder to source containers to that were boil safe to keep the egg whites in. (And I question the safety of the containers to begin with)\n\nTLDR - Anyway to prepare liquid egg whites to very close match the egg whites from a boiled egg? I don't want to waste boiled egg yolks.\n\nI feel like I'm crazy because no one has done this or really expermented with this. I see the egg whites bites, but those are clearly meant to be fluffyish and not like the traditional boiled egg whites texture.\n\nAs someone who loves egg salad (I eat it literally everyday) and notice little change in overall taste when moving to lower fat mayo and reducing the amount of yolk. I feel like others who may love egg salad could greatly utilize a very low fat and high protein version of egg salad. Maybe not many people like egg salad nearly as much as me haha... But if you do! Please give me some recommendations, I'll try anything within reason.\n\nEdit: also worth mentioning that I am not a good cook at all.. so maybe I've been going about my experiments wrong. I literally eat egg salad everyday, a big reason is because it's so easy haha.. I feel like maybe the oven at an exact temperature with the egg whites on a large pan (to create a thin layer) may actually work, but the temperature may be the key, to avoid that egg film from building up all over the top. Or maybe a key temperature, with something like foil over the top of the pan to stop the exposure of direct heat to the whites on top?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1fa03lw/advice_on_cooking_egg_whites_to_be_similar_to_a/", "created_utc": 1725577077.0, "score": 5, "author": "yeah779", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1fa03lw/advice_on_cooking_egg_whites_to_be_similar_to_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Maximizing peanut butter spread volume (for lower cal sandwiches), ideas wanted.", "selftext": "So far here's what ideas I have, aside from the PB powders, which are fine as well for removing some calories, but I find them a bit bland even without extra volumizing.\n\nFirst, get natural as you can, pour out the oil that separates at the top, replace with water. Might be some loss of flavor, but still lots of oil in there.\n\nFor volumizing here's some things that let it mostly preserve its flavor, minus maybe the first:\n\n1. Banana. Mushed up it's going to have a spreadable consistency, pretty low calorie for the volume added.\n\n2. laughing cow cheeses. I love these things. Pretty low cal and much more neutral and more creamy than banana.\n\n3. xantham gum? curious if this adds any calories or what it is like really.\n\n4. Glucomannan, supposedly this turns water into gel and so I think some experimentation is warranted.\n\n5. Gelatin? Can this really produce something that isn't a lot different feeling? Curious if anyone has tried and what the full process is like.\n\n6. Marshmallow fluff, This is a bit iffy, but definitely makes a tasty result.\n\n7. Whipped topping. My experiments with this haven't gone well as it tends to deflate. I imagine keeping it whipped up and then likely refrigerating is key. Otherwise the calories still stack up.\n\n8. Yogurt. This works fine, especially plain, but not everyone is going to like the flavor and it may end up a bit too loose without extra thickening agents for it to be much of a spread. But that being said, there are some yogurts that are inexpensive with excellent macros today.\n\nWell these are my ideas if anyone has others.

However I also have pattypan squash (patison), some type of bottle gourd (lagenaria) and others, which are lets be honest, not that tasty on their on or for baking.

If I dont use the ground meat but still want protein, most of the recipes call for cheese. My boyfriend doesnt eat cheese and I wonder what can I substitute the meal with (like a spinach and sundried tomatoes filled into the squash that I saw, but the main protein source there is the cheese). Sadly he doesnt eat cottage cheese either. He is ok with curd cheese (not called cheese in our language :) ).

There's a lot of information out there that I'm combing through, and very sorry if this is a repeat of lots of similar questions, but I'm currently trying to uplift my health. I've had a lot of unhealthy habits and a difficult relationship with food for quite some time now, and I'm looking to lose weight and gain a healthier perspective. \n\nMy main question is about how to build out a cohesive meal plan. I'm vegetarian, so I tend to eat mostly plant-based meals - though I worry that I can rely too much on carbs to fill me up in the absence of meat. Any advice on how to build meals that sustain throughout the day? Is it a good idea to try and cut out things like bread in the name of losing weight? I've read elsewhere about trying for two full meals and one light one/a shake replacement, is this a healthy weightloss option?\n\nAng advice would be very much appreciated.

It's essentially a searchable database of restaurant chain menus where you can sort items based on nutrients (protein, fat, carbs) or ingredients.\n\nI've got a rough prototype up at https://macromenue.com/.

I don't have any medical conditions. I am a physically active, in-shape male, and do require on average around 2,300 - 2,500 calories per day. So, I'm not seeking low calorie options for diet and weight loss, for example. I'm fairly busy, which is why buying ingredients from the store and cooking is not always within reach for me.

I\u2019ve been tinkering with my recipe for some time now and I\u2019m very happy with where it currently is, so I figured I\u2019d share it here:\n\n* 2 lbs 95% lean ground beef\n* 1 medium onion\n* 2 10 oz. cans Rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles \n* 10 oz (1 can\u2019s worth) water\n* 1 15 oz cans tomato sauce\n* 1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n* 3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, de-veined, de-seeded, and minced\n* 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n* 4 tsp Worcestershire sauce\n* 2 tbsp chili powder\n* 2 tsp cumin\n* 1 tsp garlic powder\n* 1 tsp onion powder\n* 1 tsp paprika\n* 1 tsp oregano\n* 1/2 tsp red chili flakes\n* 1/2 tsp salt\n* 1/4 tsp black pepper\n\nIn a large pot or 12\u201d Dutch oven, brown the ground beef over medium high heat. As the meat begins to brown, stir in the onions and garlic. Continue cooking until the meat has fully browned and onions are tender. If there is a lot of excess grease, drain.\n\nStir in the Rotel, water, tomato sauce, beans, chipotle peppers, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir in the seasonings. Adjust to taste.\n\nCover and cook over medium-high heat until it reaches a boil. Boil a couple minutes, reduce heat, and simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Makes 4 portions that you can serve immediately or store in sturdy freezer bags and freeze. To reheat, place bag in room temp or cool water to thaw, then microwave contents of the bag in a bowl for around 2-3 minutes.\n\n1 serving with this recipe comes to 493 kcal and 58 g. protein. With a couple spoonfuls of light sour cream and about 1/4 cup of grated Colby jack cheese, it comes to 623 kcal and 67 g. protein. I used nonfat unflavored Greek yogurt instead of sour cream once to empty my fridge and it turned out pretty well too, and my girlfriend turned me on to adding a handful of Fritos on top.\n\nSwitching from 80% lean to 95% lean ground beef saves around 200 calories but loses a lot of the flavor, so I adjusted with the Worcestershire sauce and leaned heavily on spice.

{"title": "Ya Want Protein Pancakes? FINE! I'll Give Ya Protein Pancakes.", "selftext": "This recipe is for those people who are a) on the fence about protein recipes pretending to be normal recipes or b) people who struggle to get enough protein in a day without hastily shovelling in the chalkiest, most plastic-flavoured protein brick at 3pm because they can't face another bite of husked-out \"juicy\" baked chicken breast. I'd say you COULD meal-prep these, but they do deflate a little, so be prepared to them to be slightly less exciting and \"pancake stack\"-like the next day. Another thing \\[goddamn, this is starting to look like a white-lady-from-New-York-City-blog-post\\]: don't waste your money running out to buy something just because you think the thing you have in the fridge isn't \"the right one\". Make it work and chill out. You don't have to have protein powder - make oat flour instead. You don't have to have protein yoghurt. I've done this with cottage cheese, I've done it with thin natural yoghurt, and I've done it with protein yoghurt. It's fiiiiiiiiiiine.\n\nONTO THE SHOW!\n\n***EDITED TO ADD MACROS AND SUCH:***\n\n***For the whole serving, MFP gave me a readout of approx. 500 calories, 64g protein, for a quite high-yield protein powder and yoghurt.*** YMMV. Also, I used Macro Mike's White Choc Malt protein powder. It's the best non-dairy/plant-based protein powder I've tried, and BOY have I suffered through many. It doesn't taste chalky, it doesn't feel like you're eating plasterboard, and it has quite a strong flavour profile. Upsides: mixes well, doesn't get chalky, doesn't taste like you're eating the box your baking powder came in. Downsides: It's expensive, no matter where you are, and unless you're specifically looking for that, MOST of the Macro Mike protein powders have a bit of a peanut butter flavour tint to them, because their products are based on peanut, almond, pea and fava bean proteins. \n\n**WHAT:**\n\n**1 x single serve tub your favourite protein yoghurt.** I used Iskey vanilla bean \\[96 cals per 170g tub, 17g protein\\]\n\n**\\~50-100 ml optional liquid, to loosen batter if needed** \\- water, milk, mylk, meeyelk, whatever creamy substance \\[that's what sh---NO!\\] you refer to in this instance. Only add if blending doesn't get you to go, \"oooh! it looks like pancake batter!\"\n\n**\\~80g or 1 loose metric cup protein powder** \\[none of your freedom eagle nonsense here. We're metric, baby. Google the conversion to your weird Imperial ways.\\]\n\n**2 eggs** \\[omg yes you can use egg whites or flax eggs or murloc eggs or whatever you want calm down\\]\n\n**1 very enthusiastic teaspoon baking powder**\n\n**Splash of vanilla if you have it** \\[it's fiiiiine if you don't\\]\n\n**A sneeze of cinnamon** \\[optional\\]\n\nToppings: fresh cut fruit, sugar free or not sugar free maple syrup, lemon sugar, nutella, you do you, kid. I believe in you. Go wild.\n\nThere are three steps to this recipe. If you fuck up three steps, I don't know what to tell you. Maybe call your parents?\n\n**HOW:**\n\n1. Place all ingredients in a blender cup, making sure that the liquid stuff is closest to the blades - whether that means you go powder first or yoghurt first requires your stellar powers of deduction, friendo. Are your blender blades separate to the cup? Great! Go powder-first. Does your blender cup have the blades attached to it? Wheeeee! Add your liquids first.\n2. Blend. What did you think I was going to say? Go to iHop?\n3. Heat your favourite frying implement on LOW, YOU IMPATIENT WRETCH. DON'T FUCK THIS ONE UP. Lube up your pan if needed, and pour in some of your batter to a size that makes you happy. Wait for bubbles to appear on the edges before you flip and remove to a warm plate, or straight into your face. Repeat until PANCAKES.\n\nIn the photos, I've topped mine with some sugar free fake maple-intended syrup, and buffalo yoghurt. I did not let the batter rest for long enough, so mine came out quite thin, but it doesn't impact anything, really. Not pictured: the two kiwifruit I also inhaled as I ate these. These aren't terribly sweet, but if you chew thoughtfully and slowly and don't snorgle them into your gullet like a seagull, you'll find they're quite moreish, they taste 80% the part, and chew pretty much the way pancakes do.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tl79gu15yvve1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ffc4e4de87c9fdf522d2cc47bcfe917a1c7018\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40bc7nz4yvve1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d9a78a79891be602bfeefa18edb335a12e031b4\n\nGOOD LUCK, SOLDIER.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1k3aksd/ya_want_protein_pancakes_fine_ill_give_ya_protein/", "created_utc": 1745109493.0, "score": 43, "author": "Timely--Challenge", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1k3aksd/ya_want_protein_pancakes_fine_ill_give_ya_protein/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Loosely wrapped garlic cloves in tin foil and roasted for 20 min at 400 f. Allowed to sit in cooling oven until needed.\n\n3. Combined reduced wine mix with spinach in big pot and cooked until all soft, but still green (don\u2019t overcook and watch out for splashing liquid while mixing in). Moved spinach to another bowl and covered for later use. Kept the excess spinach water in pot as the base of the soup/broth.\n\n4. Added 1 liter of water to pot, along with fresh bay leaves, thyme, and sage. Simmered on low medium heat while doing the next step.\n\n5. Prepared / cut onions, celery, and carrots.\n\n6. Removed all herbs from pot and discarded after about 20-25 minutes.\n\n7. Added onions, celery, and carrots to broth - also mushed up the roasted garlic and added that too. Brought to a gentle simmer/boil and allowed to cook. Add water as needed to keep vegetables submerged.\n\n8. Prepped bell peppers and added to pot.\n\n9. Prepped green squash/zucchini and added to pot\n\n10. Prepped cherry tomatoes and added to pot.\n\n11. Rinsed red lentils and added to pot, stirred in thoroughly.\n\n12. Sliced up mushrooms, added some salt and seasoning, and saut\u00e9d in pan with a light amount of avocado oil spray. Added mushrooms and excess water / flavor to the soup.\n\n13. Add in the spinach, bring to 165 F for food safety and then take off heat.\n\n14. Finishing touches: add fresh basil and parsley, spices (garlic, black pepper, hot sauces (I like Bhutila Fire - half a bottle). Also salt if necessary.\n\nAt this point you can portion out the soup, I use stackman 1 pint containers, which store well in the freezer.\n\nTo prepare the soup on a meal basis, I empty 1 pint into a small pot and bring to a simmer. Then I add in one whole egg and allow it to cook/poach in the soup.\n\nOnce it\u2019s all hot and the egg is cooked, I take it off the heat, add in the olive oil and heavy cream and gently stir around.

Back with another recipe - I have trialled this so many times and I'm finally happy with the texture! \n\n*Disclaimer* This is still a cookie! It's just a slightly lower calorie option that has double the protein of a normal cookie. I made this recipe with the mindset that when I want a cookie I want a cookie, but if I'm having a cookie it may as well have slightly better macros whilst still being sweet and satisfying!\n\nThis recipe makes 4 medium sized cookies, that are a lil chewy, a lil soft and a lil crispy\ud83c\udf6a\n\n1 cookie (1/4 recipe): KCAL- 198, PROT - 5.3g,  FAT - 10.0g, CARB - 21.6g\n\nIngredients:\n\n\u2022 30g Butter, Salted\n\u2022 25g White Sugar\n\u2022 15g Demerara Sugar\n\u2022 42g McDougalls Plain Flour 1.1kg\n\u2022 1 Egg yolk (18g) Egg Yolk\n\u2022 15g PEScience Select Protein Powder Gourmet Vanilla Flavour** \n\u2022 1/4 Pack (25g) Chocolate Chips (I use a mixture of milk, white and dark for funsies\ud83c\udf6b)\n\u2022 15ml Semi-Skimmed Milk\n\n**(this is a whey, casein blend!

{"title": "Recipe for Veggie Lentil Soup (mass prep)", "selftext": "Feel free to scale ingredients to your choosing.\n\n  \n1. 60 grams of garlic, roasted\n\n  \n2. 1000 grams of fresh mushrooms, cleaned and sauteed in a bit of salt (in advance)\n\n  \n3a. 1800 grams fresh Spinach / Baby Spinach, pre-blanched/cooked slightly in/seasoned with -\n\n  \n3b. 40 g Better than Bouillon Italian Herb mixed with half a bottle of white wine, reduced on low-medium heat until all alcohol has evaporated. (Save the excess water/broth from the spinach and mushrooms!)\n\nAlso, you want the spinach to be mushy but still have a vibrant deep green color, it should not be brown.\n\n  \n4. in a huge pot, add the excess broth from the mushrooms and spinach, then fill with more water until around a total volume of about 4.4 Liters or 4400 grams on a scale. Put on high heat to bring to a simmer then lower heat to maintain simmer for about 20 minutes, you can start prepping other ingredients during this stage. Throw in roasted garlic and as a bonus, any parmesan or hard cheese rind you might have (it infuses the broth/soup with a delicious savory flavor). I also add some blackened garlic and bay leaves but this is all extra.\n\n  \n5. Once the water has been simmering for some time, carefully skim the broth to remove the cheese rind and bay leaves before continuing, as they will be difficult to locate after the next step.\n\n  \n6. Thoroughly rinse and add 880 grams of dry red lentils. You can use an other lentil of your choosing, but the red ones soak up enough of the base broth so that draining it is not necessary.\n\n  \n7. At the same time, add in 2 pounds or 900 grams fresh cherry tomatoes. (if you want them softer you can even add them a little before the lentils).\n\n  \n8. Stir until the lentils soften and soak up a majority of the broth (around 15-20 minutes). They won't soak up all of it, but should be close to the surface and easily visible when stirring.\n\n  \n9. Add the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and continue cooking on low heat for another 5-10 min.\n\n  \n10. I really like adding Trader Joe's Garden Vegetable Soup. It's probably not necessary. But I will empty 3 jars of it into a bowl, add garlic and onion powder, along with hot sauce to spice it up until it tastes pretty good. It's alright if it get's pretty spicy as it will be diluted. I usually add around half a bottle or 90 grams of Bhutila Fire Hot Sauce - Chile Lengua de Fuego. But you can use another hot sauce of your choosing or none at all. Once you've got that mix ready, add it to the pot and stir in.\n\n  \n11. I also really like to cut up and add 1-3 jars of Trader Joe's roasted red peppers. You can also roast some yourself but I find this shortcut approach saves a lot of time and doesn't really cost much.\n\n\n\n12. Raise the heat to bring the water to a simmer again, or around 170-180 degrees for food safety.\n\n\n\n13. Add the blanched spinach and briefly bring to around 165+ degrees Fahrenheit for safety, then remove from heat. We don't want to overcook the spinach.\n\n  \n14. Add extra virgin olive oil to your taste preference. I like to add 45 grams to the bulk prep. I also threw in some fresh basil.\n\n  \n15. Once that is all stirred in, distribute to tubs of your size choice, stirring along the way. I find 1 pint makes a good serving so that is what I use. This recipe is good for between 24 and 25 pints.\n\n  \n16. I really enjoy a poached egg(feel free to add another protein of your choosing) and cream in the finished product, but I add these after thawing out a tub.\n\nFor preparing the meal I empty the contents of a 1 pint tub into a small pot and bring to a simmer, poach an egg in the soup for around 2-3 minutes, take off the heat, add 1.5 teaspoons or 8 grams of heavy cream, top with 14 grams of grated Parmesan cheese and serve.\n\nHere are the macros for the soup prepped in this way:\n\nCalories: 350\n\nProtein: 23 grams\n\nFat: 15 grams\n\nCarbs: 33 grams (includes around 10 grams or more of fiber)\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j0c8q8", "created_utc": 1740761389.0, "score": 56, "author": "Its_Shatter", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1j0c8q8/recipe_for_veggie_lentil_soup_mass_prep/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Best meals or snacks to eat after running or gym at night or salsa?", "selftext": "I work all day, box gym only public opens 7PM. Lately, I\u2019ve been training around 9PM after dinner, finishing by 11:30 PM. My issue is I wake up too early, often feeling like I\u2019ve only had two REM cycles. Even when I sleep until 9-10 AM. I sleep in but I suspect my body clock picks up the sunlight even through my cold dark room, disrupting anything, it would feel like it's just a long light sleep. Some nights, I barely get 3-4 hours of sleep, leading to brain fog all day. I've got my friend to look into the room, says it's good enough, blackout curtains, white noise, balanced temps.\n\nSo it just ends up in a cycle, conceding to naps or having a late coffee. Same issue happens with salsa nights. Intense cardio keeps me wired, home by 1am or even 2aM. I think I burn through my first energy reserve, then tap into a second, which keeps me awake unless I fully exhaust it. Oddly, staying out later (like on salsa nights past 2:30 AM) helps me sleep better. Same goes with hitting the bags, but in salsa, I'd atleast have many multple ~~sparring~~ dance partners, staying sharp and focused on combinations, but on a gently don't hurt anyone version. But just like boxing, I love it.\n\nLate-night workouts are my only option in an expensive city where gyms and venues mostly open at night, because they can also only afford to open at night. Has anyone found a routine that works? Do you eat after training, or skip it? Curious how others manage this lifestyle. it's more to do with cardio, I find that lifting or bulking I can get normal sleep patterns and can even lift 1 hour and eat a light snack then sleep after 2 hours easily. \n\nI think the issue here is inconsistency, I guess just build up a natural pattern and take things such as supplements (creatine, fish oil etc) in the AM and nothing at all in the PM. \n\nBut I'm still wondering what makes me wake up way too early. It's sort of annoying feeling pumped and good the first few hours of waking up, knowing that I've only probably got 1-2 quality REM and the rest of the PM day will be brutal.

{"title": "Cocoa Sweet Potatoes with Ghee Recipe", "selftext": "This is my favorite sweet treat/dessert portion of a meal while dieting as it provides a good source of healthy carbs and tastes like brownies to me. \n\n\nI take a whole sack of sweet potatoes from Costco and thoroughly scrub with a potato brush.\n\n\nThen I wrap each in tin foil and bake at 400 degrees F for around 1-1.5 hours, thought the big potato here took about 2.5 hours\u2026\n\n\nAfter they\u2019ve cooled a bit I tear off the fibrous ends and then separate out the peels and flesh of each potato into large bowls. It\u2019s at this point that I take the weight of the flesh and skins before proceeding.\n\n\nI usually aim for 150-200 grams of potato flesh per serving and then divide up the skins equally for each serving. In this prep I had around 1450 g of flesh, so enough for around 9-10 servings.\n\n\nYou can scale how you want, but personally I find 5 grams of cocoa and 5 grams of ghee per serving makes for a great chocolatey flavor profile. So for this prep I added 50 grams of cocoa and 50 grams of ghee into the bowl, along with a tablespoon of cinnamon, then mashed the whole thing up. It smells really good at this point. \n\n\nFinally I divide into reusable tubs that are microwave and dishwasher safe. For this prep I added about 155 g of chocolate mash to each tub, then topped with around 20 g of peels in each (had about 200 g of peels in total).\n\n\nI recommend putting these in the fridge overnight, as that allows the starch to turn into \u201cresistant\u201d starch, which just means it has more soluble-fiber like properties, it also improves the consistency in my opinion.\n\n\nThey stay good in the fridge for a couple days, but you can also freeze them, then pull them out and thaw overnight in the fridge as needed for a meal prep schedule (I usually have one per day on exercise days). I\u2019ll have it as a dessert at the end of a  meal complete with plenty of veggies and high quality protein. To prep it I just scarf down the peels (it\u2019s really not bad but let me know if you have a better suggestion on how to make use of them) and then microwave and mix the mash until it\u2019s piping hot.\n\n\nHere are the macros for this prep (per serving): 212 calories, 4 g protein, 6 g fat, 37 g carbs (includes resistant starch/fiber).\n\n\nI also included a photo of a typical meal I\u2019d include them in at the end.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixvbro", "created_utc": 1740491101.0, "score": 42, "author": "Its_Shatter", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1ixvbro/cocoa_sweet_potatoes_with_ghee_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

The app then takes that as well as a list of ingredients that you have on hand, and maybe a list of ingredients that you like or don\u2019t like. With that information, the app would develop 5 or so options each for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack each day with exact weights of ingredients to use for each meal option. Ideally the app would have the ability to spit out a grocery list to pick up additional things you may need when those days come around but that\u2019s more or less a feature that would come later.\n\nAs long as you choose an option from the app for each meal of the day you\u2019ll hit your daily macro/micros perfectly for peak optimal performance. Effectively you could have any combination, choosing any of the meals in each category each day and no matter what options you chose, you\u2019ll have hit your goals within a small variance window. This app would effectively remove the thinking/calculating and daily struggle we all face with traditional macro tracking apps and having to constantly piece together weird meals to hit your goals by the end of the day.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to do this with multiple AI tools in the past but they\u2019re all pretty clunky and end up spitting out false information. For example, I\u2019ve taken the meals and if I picked an option that ChatGPT generated for each meal in a day I would have over eaten by 700 calories and still not hit my protein goal.\n\nThis would be an absolute game changer in my life and I feel like others would benefit as well. If there\u2019s currently something like this, I\u2019d love to support and get on board. If not, I may begin going down some avenues for the creation of something like this.

I've also bought some whey protein to help.\n\nSo the first couple of days, before I bit the bullet and bought the meat, fish and whey, I hit around 70g protein, whilst also struggling to stay under 2000kcal.\n\nToday was my first day with the whey protein, which has helped, but I'm still only at 100g protein.\n\nBelieve me when I say I've done quite a lot of research over the last few days about protein rich foods, and here are some of the outcomes and concerns I have:\n\n* 2000kcal and 140g proten means that I have to try and get in 7g protein for every 100kcal consumed\n* There are not that many foods that meet this ration, outside of meats, fish and protein powder\n* I don't want to have to pack in meat for every meal if I can avoid it. From a budget point of view and trying to keep saturated fats down. Also it's not logistically easy to be cooking all the time, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to meal prep\n* There are obviosuly veggies, pulses and legumes that have lots of protein, but would seem to reqire eating about 300g per meal in order to actually hit that 140g target\n* Eggs, and more specifically egg whites, keep coming up as 'great sources of protein', and at around 10g protein to 45kcal they sound great. But realistically you'd need to eat 100g of egg whites for those 10g of protein - which just doesn't feel like a good enough return.\n* Fruit seems to be almost completely out the window, with most having very little protein value. A lot of recipes I've seen so far, particulalry for breakfast smoothies, recommend a banana, But at around 1.5g of protein for nearly 100kcal, it's rubbish\n\n  \nAnyway, I know plenty of people post their meal plans on here, but I still find I'm struggling with the requirements.

{"title": "The Ultimate Guilt-Free Protein Brownie: Delicious, Moist, and Low-Calorie!

I combined suggestions from their posts and other recipes to get this as close to the perfect brownie as possible. Personally, I find many anabolic recipes use oils, butters, and flours that don't feel low-calorie or convenient. Some may taste fine, but I wanted to achieve a better balance and create a brownie that truly tastes delectable, as it should. But I digress. As for the added ingredients, the coffee enhances the chocolate flavor by deepening its richness. Vanilla, a common ingredient in many protein recipes, elevates the overall flavor profile, adding warmth and balance. The egg whites contribute to a slightly cakier texture and add more volume. If you prefer a different texture, feel free to omit them! That being said. here's what is needed for the recipe:\n\n**DRY INGREDIENTS**\n\n3 Tbsp Cocoa Powder\n\nPinch of Salt\n\n2 Tbsp Chocolate Protein Powder (Others work too! I used Salted Caramel Whey Protein Powder, and it worked fine. If your protein contains sodium, like mine, omit the salt.)\n\n1/6 Tsp Baking Powder\n\n2-2\u00bd Tbsp Flour or Oat Fiber\n\n\u00bc cup Erythritol (or sweetener of choice)\n\n1 Tbsp Instant Coffee\n\n**WET INGREDIENTS**\n\n1 Egg White, whipped to stiff peaks (use 2 for a more cake-like consistency)\n\n\u00bd Tsp Vanilla Extract\n\n\u00bd cup Diet Soda (Flavored diet soda seems to pack more flavor. If you don't prefer the taste of soda, opt out for Carbonated Soda)\n\n**(OPTIONAL TOPPING) PB2 GLAZE:**\n\n2 Tbsp PB2 (powdered peanut butter)\n\n1 Tbsp Almond Milk or water (or adjust to reach desired consistency)\n\n1 Tsp powdered sweetener (like powdered erythritol or Swerve)\n\n\u00bd Tsp vanilla extract\n\n\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS (*****Note: Incorporate egg white mixture last as explained in the recipe*****):**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C)\n\n2. Mix dry ingredients: Combine cocoa powder, salt, protein powder, baking powder, flour/oat fiber, erythritol, and instant coffee in a bowl.

{"title": "Advice on cooking egg whites to be similar to a boiled eggs whites", "selftext": "So I've been extremely interested in a high protein, low fat, egg salad. Sadly, this is near impossible if you use the egg yolk within the egg for the egg salad. The mayonnaise already adds a decent chunk of fats to the dish. The solution was to get low fat mayo (35 cal a tbsp), but even then, the boiled yolk still is too high in fats. My best solution for this has been to just use the boiled yolk for 1-2 eggs and not use the rest (4-6) eggs boiled yolk. The taste is surprisingly the same still. I have only done this once because I literally have no idea what to do with the left over boiled egg yolks and eat far too many eggs per day to save them.\n\nThe first obvious thing to do, is just buy liquid egg whites.. Well, weeks later and much wasted egg whites later.. it is extremely hard replicating the texture and firmness of the egg whites you get off of boiling an egg compared to using the liquids outside the egg.. I've tried sous vide at various temps and times for the egg whites, I've tried boiling them in a boil safe container, I've tried baking them. They all come out, off.. to a substantial degree.. substantial enough to where it's not enjoyable to eat, it taste like mushed slop when used for egg salad. And not that firm, boiled egg, egg whites texture.\n\nSous vide was my most expermented device for this, it doesn't work well. The main issue is the temperature to cook an egg white in such a way is around 175-195 degrees F, I've tried at 165 for 2 hours and it was horrible. I've tried at 195 for 2 hours and it was decent. I feel like this approach for 195 degrees would work, but I'd need to do smaller bags. I'd need to do about an egg sized bag of whites. When doing a large bag of egg whites at once, it creates a large roll like shape within the bag, and the center just doesn't get that firmness no matter what. I hypothesis that this is because the whites need to be a thinish layer in order to properly firm the way a boiled eggs whites would. The issue is, many small bags (and even larger bags) are not suited to safely be in 185-195 degree temps for long periods of time.. \n\nThe oven was horrible, I feel like this way could be the best but it is so extremely messy. Which would be fine but direct heat blasting on liquid egg whites creates a film of cooked egg whites over the top, and scraping this off/working around this is a nightmare..\n\nBoiling was similar to the sous vide, except easier to mess up/more messy, and was harder to source containers to that were boil safe to keep the egg whites in. (And I question the safety of the containers to begin with)\n\nTLDR - Anyway to prepare liquid egg whites to very close match the egg whites from a boiled egg? I don't want to waste boiled egg yolks.\n\nI feel like I'm crazy because no one has done this or really expermented with this. I see the egg whites bites, but those are clearly meant to be fluffyish and not like the traditional boiled egg whites texture.\n\nAs someone who loves egg salad (I eat it literally everyday) and notice little change in overall taste when moving to lower fat mayo and reducing the amount of yolk. I feel like others who may love egg salad could greatly utilize a very low fat and high protein version of egg salad. Maybe not many people like egg salad nearly as much as me haha... But if you do! Please give me some recommendations, I'll try anything within reason.\n\nEdit: also worth mentioning that I am not a good cook at all.. so maybe I've been going about my experiments wrong. I literally eat egg salad everyday, a big reason is because it's so easy haha.. I feel like maybe the oven at an exact temperature with the egg whites on a large pan (to create a thin layer) may actually work, but the temperature may be the key, to avoid that egg film from building up all over the top. Or maybe a key temperature, with something like foil over the top of the pan to stop the exposure of direct heat to the whites on top?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1fa03lw/advice_on_cooking_egg_whites_to_be_similar_to_a/", "created_utc": 1725577077.0, "score": 5, "author": "yeah779", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1fa03lw/advice_on_cooking_egg_whites_to_be_similar_to_a/", "html_title": ""}

Might be some loss of flavor, but still lots of oil in there.\n\nFor volumizing here's some things that let it mostly preserve its flavor, minus maybe the first:\n\n1. Banana. Mushed up it's going to have a spreadable consistency, pretty low calorie for the volume added.\n\n2. laughing cow cheeses. I love these things. Pretty low cal and much more neutral and more creamy than banana.\n\n3. xantham gum? curious if this adds any calories or what it is like really.\n\n4. Glucomannan, supposedly this turns water into gel and so I think some experimentation is warranted.\n\n5. Gelatin? Can this really produce something that isn't a lot different feeling? Curious if anyone has tried and what the full process is like.\n\n6. Marshmallow fluff, This is a bit iffy, but definitely makes a tasty result.\n\n7. Whipped topping. My experiments with this haven't gone well as it tends to deflate. I imagine keeping it whipped up and then likely refrigerating is key. Otherwise the calories still stack up.\n\n8. Yogurt. This works fine, especially plain, but not everyone is going to like the flavor and it may end up a bit too loose without extra thickening agents for it to be much of a spread. But that being said, there are some yogurts that are inexpensive with excellent macros today.\n\nWell these are my ideas if anyone has others.

My  3 meals consist of high protein, low calorie  foods while fitting as many veggies where I can (stomach), and a focus on eating as little saturated fat as possible.\n\nBut recently I've read that too much protein intake is a negative and could lead to fat gain and a slew of other problems, prior to this I believed the more the protein intake the better, and on average would have around 160-170 grams of protein from a protein shake that would help me meet my caloric surplus goal. If I were to remove the protein shake from the equation, I end up having around 2100 to 2300 calories, short of even maintenance goals!\n\nSo my question is, what could I look to eat when I've meet my protein intake goals, but need to meet the caloric surplus amount ( need to eat about 500-800 more calories) \n\nOr perhaps should I look to just eating more within my three meals? \n\nThanks for reading my ramblings", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fitmeals/comments/1donzzb/what_to_eat_when_youve_meet_your_protein_intake/", "created_utc": 1719369659.0, "score": 1, "author": "Sweet_Chalupa", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/fitmeals/comments/1donzzb/what_to_eat_when_youve_meet_your_protein_intake/", "html_title": ""}
