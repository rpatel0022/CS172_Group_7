Make it a \"boat\" with raised edges to trap juices.\n\nMarinate the chicken first I like organic boneless chicken thighs, for at least 4 hours, then dry seasoning right before roasting, of your choice. Don't cut up, leave whole.\n\nPick a fresh vegetable. That's where all the water is from, don't use frozen vegetables if you are pan sheet roasting. Broccoli is good, so is asparagus with bell pepper, cauliflower with carrots, etc. Olive oil, lemon juice, garlic salt and dry herb (I usually do dill) is all it needs.\n\nPotatoes. Small mix, or fingerling works best. Cut them in half inch sizes, boil for about 10 minutes. It will precook the starch and allow for more browning in the oven. I just do Montreal Steak seasoning and again olive oil. Drain and dry of course.\n\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0. On one pan sheet, go for about 35 minutes.

I met my wife early in my career and it has caused a lot of damage to our marriage. It made me miss time with my son I'll never get back.

This is a meal I've made hundreds of times and have kind of gotten it down by how I want it to taste at this point. But use this base recipe to make your own!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\- 1 1/2 to 2 LBs ground beef\n\n\\-1/4  cup of heavy cream\n\n\\-2 TBS butter\n\n\\-1 Cup Cheddar Cheese\n\n\\-1 Small can tomato paste\n\n\\-2 TBS steak sauce\n\n\\-1/2 to 1 cup beef broth\n\n\\-1 TBS olive oil\n\n\\-1 bag frozen veggies\n\n\\-2 LBS potatoes\n\n\\-1 clove garlic\n\n\\-1/2 shallot\n\n\\-salt\n\n\\-pepper\n\n\\-dried rosemary\n\n\\-dried parsley\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Fill a pot with water and begin to boil to cook potatoes. Peel and cut potatoes into small pieces. \n2. When water is boiling, salt water and add potatoes. Cook until a knife can be pushed through them.\n3. Drain potatoes  Return to pot and add butter and heavy cream. (I cut my butter into small pieces so it melts fast and evenly throughout potatoes.)\n4. Using a hand mixer, blend potatoes until desired smoothness. (I mixed just until all large lumps were out.)\n5. When potatoes are desired thickness, add salt, pepper, rosemary, and parsley and stir until well incorporated. Set aside. \n6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. \n7. In a large skillet or heavy bottom pot, brown ground beef over medium heat. Season ground beef with salt, pepper, and rosemary as beef cooks.  After ground beef has browned, drain it and set aside.\n8. In same pot ground beef was cooked in, heat olive oil and add garlic and shallot and cook until fragrant. Once fragrant, add mixed vegetables and any additional olive oil that may be needed. Season vegetables with salt and pepper while they cook. \n9. Once vegetables are close to being cooked through, return ground beef to pot containing vegetables. Add tomato paste and steak sauce, stir until well combined over medium heat. \n10. Once combined, add beef broth a little at a time, cooking until most of the broth has evaporated before adding more. (A similar process to making risotto). Complete this process until vegetable and beef mixture is desired moistness. \n11. In a 9 inch cake pan (or other pan/baking dish) add vegetable and ground beef mixture in an even layer. \n12. Spoon mashed potatoes in an even layer over vegetable and ground beef. Using a fork, gently insert into the top of the potatoes and spin the dish, not your hand, to get the lines in the potatoes. Add cheese in even layer on top of potatoes. \n13. Bake for 15 minutes. Then for the last 5 set oven to broil and broil until cheese and potatoes are desired texture.", "That looks wonderful!

It\u2019s the only broth I\u2019ve ever wanted to eat right out of the package. They come in several flavors and last forever in the fridge. So once you get a couple different flavors you can add multiple flavors togethers. I do an Eastern NC pulled pork in the instapot with BTB chicken and roast garlic flavors. I just dip the tip of a butter knife in the jar and measure with my heart. Add a little vinegar, hot sauce, and lots of black pepper, and just cook a pork shoulder until it falls apart. I actually drank the stock straight because it was so good afterwards.", "Looks brilliant and would love to try it myself!!! Kudos to your 16yr old for taking the efforts.", "That looks like a wholesome meal. My tummy rumbling.\n\nGreat skill to have at a young age.", "It doesn't look bad", "My son is 14 and made hamburger helper all by himself a few weeks ago. Waking up to that was so nice.

That\u2019s pretty much the foundation of gastronomy, creating a balance between the basic tastes  (salty, sweet, sour, savory, bitter).

Too much mayo will make it the only thing you can taste and ruin the overall flavor.\n\n3) Mozarella cheese is probably too mild of cheese to be noticed among the rest of the ingredients.

Cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\n\n3. **Create the Sauce:**\n   - If you prefer a thicker sauce, sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir well to coat. Cook for 1 minute to remove the raw flour taste.\n   - Gradually pour in the beef or vegetable broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps if using flour.\n   - Add the heavy cream and stir to combine.\n\n4. **Simmer:**\n   - Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes, until it thickens to your desired consistency. Stir occasionally.\n\n5. **Season and Serve:**\n   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n   - Serve the creamy mushrooms over steak, mashed potatoes, or as a side dish.\n\nEnjoy your delicious creamy mushrooms!", "Looks very tasty.

I used 3 habaneros\n* 1 tbsp soy sauce\n* 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar\n* 1 4 oz. package of slice shitake mushrooms\n* 1 small bunch of baby bok choy (rinsed and small diced)\n* 32 oz ramen or dashi broth (I'm sure homemade would be way better, but this was on short notice). I used[ this brand](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ocean-s-Halo-Organic-and-Vegan-Ramen-Broth-Shelf-Stable-32-fl-oz/785039180?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&wl13=2323&gclsrc=aw.ds&adid=22222222277785039180_161193766053_21214199653&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=697173827980&wl4=pla-2348450966064&wl5=9015359&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=local&wl12=785039180&veh=sem_LIA&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw0t63BhAUEiwA5xP54TuRWq9NtE-y2-L5SPLCb78LK5kMTfh2AKTDmtRhC1A-RzlWkc7ryhoCfy4QAvD_BwE) the broth is key and what makes the broth look sort of creamy\n* 2 individual packages of ramen noodles\n* 1 lb rotisserie chicken\n* chili crisp to taste\n\nDirections\n\n* Brown ginger, garlic, green onions, and hot peppers in sesame oil.\n* remove and blend with soy and rice wine vinegar. I added a dash of fish sauce too.\n* Add the cooked chicken and broth to the empty pot. Bring to a boil. Then reduce to simmer.\n* Within 15 minutes of serving, add reserved blended veggies, noodles, mushrooms, and baby bok choy.\n* for serving, add chili crisp\n\n(using uncooked chicken would certain add depth of flavor that rotisserie chicken lacks. That being said, we still enjoyed this a lot)\n\nEdited to add: if you want to reheat this, you will likely need more \u201cjuice.\u201d I added chicken broth", "Looks great, you have a recipe?", "Sounds so good!

(Or just use store bought taco seasoning)\n* 1 large garlic clove, grated\n* 1.5 cups of chicken stock\n* Can of  chopped hatch green chilies\n* Freshly shredded extra sharp cheddar and pepper jack\n* Goya empanada discs- Found in the freezer section.

Brown meat in a skillet over medium-high. Let meat sit without touching for a few mins to let it get a nice sear. I like to flatten it with my hand to completely cover the bottom of the skillet.

If threatening to burn, add a splash or two of water/stock.\n3. After onions are softened and translucent, add all of the seasonings. Let cook until very fragrant for about 1-2 mins. Add garlic, cook for 30 seconds.\n4. Add chicken stock to pan and stir. Let simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Change temperature so the meat mixture is barely simmering.\n5. After most of the water is absorbed, taste for salt. Add hatch green chilies at the very end. Let cool completely.\n6. Roll out empanada disc to thin out just a bit (if using Goya brand), add couple of tablespoons of beef and shredded cheese.\n7. Wet your finger and go around the edge of dough.

I did about 1/2 a cup at a time at first, then 1 cup at a time until all of the milk was incorporated.\n\n3.\t\u2060\u2060Season the sauce with as much Cajun seasoning as you\u2019d like and some pepper. Wait to salt until after the cheese and pasta are in. Simmer on low heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring from the bottom up to prevent sticking.\n\n4.\t\u2060\u2060Turn off heat and add in grated cheese. Stir until fully melted.\n\n5.\t\u2060\u2060Cook pasta per package instructions until al dente (try to have this done around the time your cheese sauce is, time depends on pasta).\n\n6.\t\u2060\u2060Add pasta to cheese sauce and mix to combine. Taste a couple pieces to adjust for salt. Add in lobster juices if using. **YOU CAN OPT TO SAVE THE SAUT\u00c9ED LOBSTER TO ADD WHEN SERVING, I PREFER IT THIS WAY..**\n\n7.\t\u2060\u2060Top the mac with rest of the grated cheese in a flat layer and bake for 25-30 minutes until top is bubbly.\n\nLast time I left it in there for like 40 so it was way drier than I wanted it to be, this time ~20 was perfect as long as cheese is browned. Adjust time to your preference though. It\u2019s better to use unsalted butter if you want to fully control salt level but I used Kerrygold salted and it was fine.", "Saved this one, thanks!!

I don\u2019t hate cooking nearly as much as I thought. It\u2019s a lot more enjoyable when I get to take my sweet time and am only thinking about what I want and like. \n\n2.

All I did different was doubled the garlic ( I really love garlic,  so do this with most recipes) and sauted a small minced shallot with it. \n\nThe pasta itself I did homemade (not necessary) and the recipe is in the pictures on the back of the flour bag. If you\u2019re doing it by hand like I did, highly recommend really rolling it as thin as you can possibly get it, and also don\u2019t be afraid to lightly flour as you go. Got those tips from someone on YouTube who\u2019s whole channel is just her making pasta lol \n\nThe blueberry crumble: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/uUhuzMG3r5w?si=y5V10m73Y0nFj69r\n\nI just add a dash of vanilla and a shake of cinnamon to the crumble.
