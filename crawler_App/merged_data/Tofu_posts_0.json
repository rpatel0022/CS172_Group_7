Begin by preparing the tofu. Wrap the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and set a heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes to expel excess moisture. After pressing, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.\n2. Cook the jasmine rice as per the package instructions until each grain is separate and tender.

Saut\u00e9, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden and crispy, approximately 8-10 minutes.\n4. As the tofu cooks, prepare the sticky sauce. In a small mixing bowl, combine the minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, gochujang, and rice vinegar. Stir until well mixed.\n5. Once the tofu is cooked, reduce the skillet's heat to low. Carefully pour the sauce mixture over the crispy tofu. Let it simmer gently, frequently stirring, until the sauce thickens and adheres to the tofu, creating a glossy coating (about 5 minutes).\n6. To serve, spoon the fluffy jasmine rice into bowls.

{"title": "Non-vegetarian tofu lover here (yes, we exist!) Looking for interesting recipes to try!", "selftext": "A little backstory: I was vegetarian for a couple of years when I was in high school. But I was doing it for the wrong reasons: to be cool. It's actually a little more complicated than that, but that's the basics. Even though I currently eat meat, I cultivated a lasting love of vegan/vegetarian food. Anytime we go to a restaurant that has an interesting sounding vegetarian dish, I will usually opt for that over meat. And 90% of the time I eat meat sparingly anyway because of a medical condition.\n\nSo. In the last few years I've learned to make good crispy tofu. I marinate it in Asian flavors and fry it with a light dusting of corn starch, and it turns out pretty darn good. I've made it into bahn mi with homemade pickles, and I freaking love it. I've used it on rice bowls. I've tossed it in stir-fry. Crispy tofu is great.\n\nI know I can use tofu in soup as well, but I'm wondering what else I can do with it? When I was a teenager I pretty much just made it into \"scrambled eggs\" because I wasn't very good at cooking. But basically, what I've listed above is pretty much all I know how to do.\n\nI'm not really interested in making my own meat alternatives, so tofurkey and things like that aren't that interesting to me. But surely that's not all there is to tofu, right? Crispy fried, miso soup, and fake meat? There has to be more I can do with this versatile ingredient, right?\n\nTell me your best recipes!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/eqklcl/nonvegetarian_tofu_lover_here_yes_we_exist/", "created_utc": 1579373871.0, "score": 14, "author": "petertmcqueeny", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/eqklcl/nonvegetarian_tofu_lover_here_yes_we_exist/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Tofu by me (a weird problem making tofu)", "selftext": "I've started making tofu this year using lemon as a coagulant and this month I've been experimenting with magnesium chloride. The results have been amazing so far.\n\nThis morning I decided to make a lot of tofu (the most I've done so far has been 500g of dry soy beans) and ventured with 750g of dry soy beans.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the beans looked weird after an overnight soak. Usually the beans change shape from round to kidney shape, this time some grew but stayed round.\n\nI decided to still make the soy milk and tofu. As usual I blended the beans with water and then strained the solids from the milk.\n\nAfter I heated the milk to begin the tofu process and while stirring i noticed the bottom of the pot there was something thick (at this time the milk had only been heating for a few minutes and wasn't even hot, at most is was lukewarm), there were some solid bits coagulating at the bottom that looked like gelatinous bits, very weird and had never happen to me before.\n\nDecided to strain them and keep going since I was already halfway the process.\n\nI boiled the milk while stirring to avoid burning and after it boiled i turned off the heat and let it cool till 80\u00b0C. While waiting i noticed that the Skin the milk always forms looked weird and wasn't really forming, this one looked more like milk foam than skin. When I moved the top the milk already looked curdled and broken without even putting the coagulant yet.\n\nLong story short. I still put the coagulant, but coagulated in tiny bits instead of the big chunks it usually does. The tofu came out too soft and crumbly. (Perhaps the softness is also due to my mold needing more wholes to drain).\n\nI think the problem lies in under soaking the beans??

{"title": "Homemade tofu failure. Help?", "selftext": "So I quick soaked my beans by boiling them for a minute and leaving them a couple hours. Later ill soak a new batch overnight for tomorrow. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I then took 1.5Cups of the beans and added 5Cups water. I then blended them x2\n\n* This is where i think the problem is, because im using a hand blender. But basically there was ALOT of Okara afterwards, however it seemed not as fiberous, it was like ground almonds but soy bean. So I think its not properly blending out the bean into the liquid.\n\nPut it through the cheese cloth and was left with the milky liquid\n\nI then took the milky liquid and boiled it for 5 minutes before allowing to cool to 80Celcius. whilst doing this i prepared my coagulant and mixed 4tsp of Gypsum into 2Cups of water as i worked out it was a 1tsp per litre. \n\nI added the coagulent in half, stirred, added some more and figure 8 stirred. By this point it was already seperating so i left the mixture and cleaned up.\n\n* I then washed up the coagulant mixture and it appeared the powder was pretty much just on the bottom where it didnt mix with al the water despite stirring it in for about 2 minutes.\n\nSo now its been about 5 minutes undisturbed and I pour the mixture through my cheesecloth to catch the curds and wrap up and put a weight to press.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nthis has made literally 25g of tofu if that so im thinking ive gone wrong somewhere down the line because im using large amounts and only getting a miniscule return. I was expecting around 250-500g of tofu to be made out of 4litres of soy milk.\n\nAny ideas what might have happened?\n\nThanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/3qr874/homemade_tofu_failure_help/", "created_utc": 1446152929.0, "score": 3, "author": "ArmouredUnicorn", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/3qr874/homemade_tofu_failure_help/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Korean Style Sticky Spicy Tofu", "selftext": "[Full recipe available here.](https://www.plantifulpalate.com/post/korean-style-spicy-sticky-vegan-tofu)\n\nRecipe:\nIngredients:\n- 400g firm tofu, pressed and cubed\n- 2 cups jasmine rice\n- 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced\n- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger\n- 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n- 2 tablespoons maple syrup\n- 1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean chili paste)\n- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n- Spring onions, thinly sliced, for garnish\n- Sesame seeds, toasted, for garnish\n\nMethod:\n1. Begin by preparing the tofu. Wrap the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and set a heavy object on top for 15-20 minutes to expel excess moisture. After pressing, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes for even cooking.\n2. Cook the jasmine rice as per the package instructions until each grain is separate and tender. Fluff with a fork once done and cover to retain warmth.\n3. In a non-stick skillet, warm the sesame oil over medium flame. Once hot, add the tofu cubes. Saut\u00e9, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden and crispy, approximately 8-10 minutes.\n4. As the tofu cooks, prepare the sticky sauce. In a small mixing bowl, combine the minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, maple syrup, gochujang, and rice vinegar. Stir until well mixed.\n5. Once the tofu is cooked, reduce the skillet's heat to low. Carefully pour the sauce mixture over the crispy tofu. Let it simmer gently, frequently stirring, until the sauce thickens and adheres to the tofu, creating a glossy coating (about 5 minutes).\n6. To serve, spoon the fluffy jasmine rice into bowls. Top with a generous helping of the spicy sticky tofu. Garnish with a sprinkle of sliced spring onions and toasted sesame seeds to enhance flavor and texture.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ui3zfkt5wrbc1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1704962263.0, "score": 30, "author": "Whiterabbit2000", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/193x06p/korean_style_sticky_spicy_tofu/", "html_title": ""}

So my tofu isn't expired. I cooked it 2 days ago. I half fried it in cubes and then I threw it in with some veggies to cook through. I tried the half fried piece and it taste fine (literally just sesame oil no seasoning and mmmm yummy) then I had a taste of my creation and the tofu was fine there then I pack it up and let it sit in the tupperware until it isn't warm any more and put it in fridge. It hasn't even been 48 hours and I heated some up and it taste weird. the veggies and other stuff are all fine still and there is no funny smell and when I smell just a piece of the tofu and nothing seems off but when I tasted it it just tastes weird. kinda like an aftertaste cus its fine and then all of a sudden this off-taste comes on and I just want to spit it out. is it spoiled? Could I have left it out too long? it was only a few hours vcus it was a big tupperwear of food so it took a while to cool off. My mother told me not to put hot food in the fridge because it goes bad faster so that is why I did that.. is she wrong?

{"title": "Tofu by me (a weird problem making tofu)", "selftext": "I've started making tofu this year using lemon as a coagulant and this month I've been experimenting with magnesium chloride. The results have been amazing so far.\n\nThis morning I decided to make a lot of tofu (the most I've done so far has been 500g of dry soy beans) and ventured with 750g of dry soy beans.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the beans looked weird after an overnight soak. Usually the beans change shape from round to kidney shape, this time some grew but stayed round.\n\nI decided to still make the soy milk and tofu. As usual I blended the beans with water and then strained the solids from the milk.\n\nAfter I heated the milk to begin the tofu process and while stirring i noticed the bottom of the pot there was something thick (at this time the milk had only been heating for a few minutes and wasn't even hot, at most is was lukewarm), there were some solid bits coagulating at the bottom that looked like gelatinous bits, very weird and had never happen to me before.\n\nDecided to strain them and keep going since I was already halfway the process.\n\nI boiled the milk while stirring to avoid burning and after it boiled i turned off the heat and let it cool till 80\u00b0C. While waiting i noticed that the Skin the milk always forms looked weird and wasn't really forming, this one looked more like milk foam than skin. When I moved the top the milk already looked curdled and broken without even putting the coagulant yet.\n\nLong story short. I still put the coagulant, but coagulated in tiny bits instead of the big chunks it usually does. The tofu came out too soft and crumbly. (Perhaps the softness is also due to my mold needing more wholes to drain).\n\nI think the problem lies in under soaking the beans?? Even though when I saw the beans the next morning the bowl still had water covering them, i think the bowl was to small for the beans to soak and absorb the water well. \n\nIdk, anyone had this problem before?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/p1x8q0/tofu_by_me_a_weird_problem_making_tofu/", "created_utc": 1628626316.0, "score": 7, "author": "Occasional_lurker29", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/p1x8q0/tofu_by_me_a_weird_problem_making_tofu/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Non-vegetarian tofu lover here (yes, we exist!) Looking for interesting recipes to try!", "selftext": "A little backstory: I was vegetarian for a couple of years when I was in high school. But I was doing it for the wrong reasons: to be cool. It's actually a little more complicated than that, but that's the basics. Even though I currently eat meat, I cultivated a lasting love of vegan/vegetarian food. Anytime we go to a restaurant that has an interesting sounding vegetarian dish, I will usually opt for that over meat. And 90% of the time I eat meat sparingly anyway because of a medical condition.\n\nSo. In the last few years I've learned to make good crispy tofu. I marinate it in Asian flavors and fry it with a light dusting of corn starch, and it turns out pretty darn good. I've made it into bahn mi with homemade pickles, and I freaking love it. I've used it on rice bowls. I've tossed it in stir-fry. Crispy tofu is great.\n\nI know I can use tofu in soup as well, but I'm wondering what else I can do with it? When I was a teenager I pretty much just made it into \"scrambled eggs\" because I wasn't very good at cooking. But basically, what I've listed above is pretty much all I know how to do.\n\nI'm not really interested in making my own meat alternatives, so tofurkey and things like that aren't that interesting to me. But surely that's not all there is to tofu, right? Crispy fried, miso soup, and fake meat? There has to be more I can do with this versatile ingredient, right?\n\nTell me your best recipes!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/eqklcl/nonvegetarian_tofu_lover_here_yes_we_exist/", "created_utc": 1579373871.0, "score": 16, "author": "petertmcqueeny", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/eqklcl/nonvegetarian_tofu_lover_here_yes_we_exist/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Homemade tofu failure. Help?", "selftext": "So I quick soaked my beans by boiling them for a minute and leaving them a couple hours. Later ill soak a new batch overnight for tomorrow. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I then took 1.5Cups of the beans and added 5Cups water. I then blended them x2\n\n* This is where i think the problem is, because im using a hand blender. But basically there was ALOT of Okara afterwards, however it seemed not as fiberous, it was like ground almonds but soy bean. So I think its not properly blending out the bean into the liquid.\n\nPut it through the cheese cloth and was left with the milky liquid\n\nI then took the milky liquid and boiled it for 5 minutes before allowing to cool to 80Celcius. whilst doing this i prepared my coagulant and mixed 4tsp of Gypsum into 2Cups of water as i worked out it was a 1tsp per litre. \n\nI added the coagulent in half, stirred, added some more and figure 8 stirred. By this point it was already seperating so i left the mixture and cleaned up.\n\n* I then washed up the coagulant mixture and it appeared the powder was pretty much just on the bottom where it didnt mix with al the water despite stirring it in for about 2 minutes.\n\nSo now its been about 5 minutes undisturbed and I pour the mixture through my cheesecloth to catch the curds and wrap up and put a weight to press.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nthis has made literally 25g of tofu if that so im thinking ive gone wrong somewhere down the line because im using large amounts and only getting a miniscule return.

It went down the drain. \n\nI'll post my steps, perhaps there is some glaring mistake i am making, and hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.\n\nMethod:\n\n1) Soak 1.5 cups of dried soybeans overnight\n\n2) Drain and rinse soybeans, grind with 2x the amount of water ( i ended up with 4.5 cups soybeans, so about 9 cups water)\n\n3) Strain soymilk with nutmilk bag, let sit for 30 min as i have seen that some starch can settle out, scooped the soymilk into a thick bottom pan, but saw no starch at the bottom to get rid of.\n\n4) Heat soymilk on medium heat until it reaches 185f (85c) then let it cook for about 20 min keeping the temp around 175f (80c)\n\n5) add 1tsp of Nigari and slowly stir in a figure 8 motion for about 15 seconds, let sit for 10 min, repeat, looking for curds, i see none, but soymilk is thickening, add the last tsp (total of 3tsp) and stir figure 8, let sit for another 10 min, total of 30 min.\n\n6) Let sit for 30 more minutes, then ladle out thick cream consistency soymilk into tofu cloth (came with tofu mold) over fine mesh strainer, let sit , then ladle that into the tofu mold that is lined with a wet tofu cloth. \n\n7) Close up the cloth, tighten it (the kind you can turn a knob on top that increases weight), and let sit for 24 hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just opened it, and was greatly disappointed. This is my fourth batch, first two were GDL, third was Nigari, and this was the softest tofu i have ever seen, it almost cannot be called tofu. More of a gravy consistency. Also, a LOT of the soymilk went through the cloth, they whey i was straining out at the end was basically soymilk, though, the initial straining was clear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what i am doing wrong, any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n(very sad camper currently)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/14lgx5x/latest_attempt_at_making_firm_tofu_complete/", "created_utc": 1687976411.0, "score": 3, "author": "Ghotiwon", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/14lgx5x/latest_attempt_at_making_firm_tofu_complete/", "html_title": ""}

It hasn't even been 48 hours and I heated some up and it taste weird. the veggies and other stuff are all fine still and there is no funny smell and when I smell just a piece of the tofu and nothing seems off but when I tasted it it just tastes weird. kinda like an aftertaste cus its fine and then all of a sudden this off-taste comes on and I just want to spit it out. is it spoiled? Could I have left it out too long? it was only a few hours vcus it was a big tupperwear of food so it took a while to cool off.

{"title": "Tofu by me (a weird problem making tofu)", "selftext": "I've started making tofu this year using lemon as a coagulant and this month I've been experimenting with magnesium chloride. The results have been amazing so far.\n\nThis morning I decided to make a lot of tofu (the most I've done so far has been 500g of dry soy beans) and ventured with 750g of dry soy beans.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the beans looked weird after an overnight soak. Usually the beans change shape from round to kidney shape, this time some grew but stayed round.\n\nI decided to still make the soy milk and tofu. As usual I blended the beans with water and then strained the solids from the milk.\n\nAfter I heated the milk to begin the tofu process and while stirring i noticed the bottom of the pot there was something thick (at this time the milk had only been heating for a few minutes and wasn't even hot, at most is was lukewarm), there were some solid bits coagulating at the bottom that looked like gelatinous bits, very weird and had never happen to me before.\n\nDecided to strain them and keep going since I was already halfway the process.\n\nI boiled the milk while stirring to avoid burning and after it boiled i turned off the heat and let it cool till 80\u00b0C. While waiting i noticed that the Skin the milk always forms looked weird and wasn't really forming, this one looked more like milk foam than skin. When I moved the top the milk already looked curdled and broken without even putting the coagulant yet.\n\nLong story short. I still put the coagulant, but coagulated in tiny bits instead of the big chunks it usually does. The tofu came out too soft and crumbly. (Perhaps the softness is also due to my mold needing more wholes to drain).\n\nI think the problem lies in under soaking the beans?? Even though when I saw the beans the next morning the bowl still had water covering them, i think the bowl was to small for the beans to soak and absorb the water well. \n\nIdk, anyone had this problem before?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/p1x8q0/tofu_by_me_a_weird_problem_making_tofu/", "created_utc": 1628626316.0, "score": 7, "author": "Occasional_lurker29", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/p1x8q0/tofu_by_me_a_weird_problem_making_tofu/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Non-vegetarian tofu lover here (yes, we exist!) Looking for interesting recipes to try!", "selftext": "A little backstory: I was vegetarian for a couple of years when I was in high school. But I was doing it for the wrong reasons: to be cool. It's actually a little more complicated than that, but that's the basics. Even though I currently eat meat, I cultivated a lasting love of vegan/vegetarian food. Anytime we go to a restaurant that has an interesting sounding vegetarian dish, I will usually opt for that over meat. And 90% of the time I eat meat sparingly anyway because of a medical condition.\n\nSo. In the last few years I've learned to make good crispy tofu. I marinate it in Asian flavors and fry it with a light dusting of corn starch, and it turns out pretty darn good. I've made it into bahn mi with homemade pickles, and I freaking love it. I've used it on rice bowls. I've tossed it in stir-fry. Crispy tofu is great.\n\nI know I can use tofu in soup as well, but I'm wondering what else I can do with it? When I was a teenager I pretty much just made it into \"scrambled eggs\" because I wasn't very good at cooking.

{"title": "Homemade tofu failure. Help?", "selftext": "So I quick soaked my beans by boiling them for a minute and leaving them a couple hours. Later ill soak a new batch overnight for tomorrow. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I then took 1.5Cups of the beans and added 5Cups water. I then blended them x2\n\n* This is where i think the problem is, because im using a hand blender. But basically there was ALOT of Okara afterwards, however it seemed not as fiberous, it was like ground almonds but soy bean. So I think its not properly blending out the bean into the liquid.\n\nPut it through the cheese cloth and was left with the milky liquid\n\nI then took the milky liquid and boiled it for 5 minutes before allowing to cool to 80Celcius. whilst doing this i prepared my coagulant and mixed 4tsp of Gypsum into 2Cups of water as i worked out it was a 1tsp per litre. \n\nI added the coagulent in half, stirred, added some more and figure 8 stirred. By this point it was already seperating so i left the mixture and cleaned up.\n\n* I then washed up the coagulant mixture and it appeared the powder was pretty much just on the bottom where it didnt mix with al the water despite stirring it in for about 2 minutes.\n\nSo now its been about 5 minutes undisturbed and I pour the mixture through my cheesecloth to catch the curds and wrap up and put a weight to press.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nthis has made literally 25g of tofu if that so im thinking ive gone wrong somewhere down the line because im using large amounts and only getting a miniscule return. I was expecting around 250-500g of tofu to be made out of 4litres of soy milk.\n\nAny ideas what might have happened?\n\nThanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tofu/comments/3qr874/homemade_tofu_failure_help/", "created_utc": 1446152929.0, "score": 3, "author": "ArmouredUnicorn", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/tofu/comments/3qr874/homemade_tofu_failure_help/", "html_title": ""}
