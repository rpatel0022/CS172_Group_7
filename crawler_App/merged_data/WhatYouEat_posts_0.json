{"title": "Coffee", "selftext": "***Health Benefits of Coffee***\n\n* Consumption reduces the risk of Gout ^[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22712/abstract) \n\n* Coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant which helps to reduce pain caused by migraines/headaches. As with Teas, over-consumption of caffeine can cause headaches, sleep issues and anxiety. \n\n* While the process are still unclear as to what causes it, Coffee has been shown to cause a decrease in Cirrhosis of the liver and of hepatocellular carcinoma (A liver cancer commonly found in patients suffering from Cirrhosis).  A study by Harvard Medical School showed a 50% risk reduction in liver cancer among coffee drinkers\n\n* Coffee has been shown to reduce the risk of  oral, esophageal, and pharyngeal cancer.  \n\n*  Coffee has been shown to reduce risk of and the mortality rate of Heat Failure and of Cardiovascular disease.  A study has shown in Japanese men that coffee has an inverse relationship between Triglycerides and blood pressure, and the consumption of coffee.  However, this could not be duplicated in women.\n\n* It is also shown to be a powerful stimulant for peristalsis, causing food and waste to be moved through the digestive tract.  **Research has shown that moderate consumption of coffee does not act as a diuretic, as current evidence shows the body treats it no differently from normal water/ non-caffeinated beverages.** \n\n*  Coffee is a powerful antioxidant, with the espresso extracrion method showing the highest activity. \n\n* Tannins found in Coffee have been shown to reduce the rate of dental cavaties, due in part to it interfering in the glucosyltransferase activity of m. streptococci.  \n\n***Health Risks***\n\n*As it is a stimulant, caffeine in coffee can become addicting, leading to withdrawl symptoms such as anxiety and decreased alertness\n\n* While praised as reducing cancer risks, 19 carcinogenic compounds are found in roasted coffee.  A weak positive relation between bladder cancer and coffee consumption has been found.  Instant coffee has a higher amount of these compounds compared to other brewing methods.\n\n* Coffee can cause the inflammation of the stomach lining and ulcers, so people who are at risk should keep consumption low.\n\n* The tannins in coffee, like tea, cause issues with iron and folic acid absorbtion.  Coupled with the fact that the chemicals in coffee stay in a fetus' body 10 times as long as the mothers, coffee shouldn't be consumed while pregnant. \n\n* 5+ cups of coffee a day has been linked to coronary heart disease.  (This is an oversimplification and to go into all of the research would probably a thread in and of itself.  \n\n* Consuming caffeine with acetomenaphine (Tylenol) can cause liver damage\n\n* Another thing coffee contains is acrylamide, a compound which in animal studies has been shown to be a neurotoxin. Effect in humans is unclear, and since it it's commonly found in high levels in fried starches, it is abundant. Food regulatory agencies do not know how to handle this potential toxin so it is often ignored and most are ignorant of it. (Credit for this addition goes to u/omicr0n .)\n\n***Decaf vs. regular coffee***\nDecaf is a misnomer as it does contain a minute amount of caffeine (5mg vs. 150-160 mg).\n  Decaf is as the name says, coffee without caffeine.  Removing this removes most of the benefits of caffeine, but also removes the downsides to it.  The one area where the two types differ is that decaf causes a small change in blood lipids as where coffee does not. Aside from this small thing, the two a virtually identical.    \n\n***Nutritional Info***\n\n\n* Calories- 2  \n* Fat- 0.05g\n* Sodium- 5 mg\n* Carbs- 0.25g\n* Sugar-0g \n* Protein-0.25g\n\n***Links***\n\n[Studies in the resources part]\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_coffee#Caffeine_and_analgesics)\n\n[Comparison of Decaf to regular]\n(http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food/article/decaf-healthy-choice)\n\n[Nutritional Info]\n(http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/3898/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f33h5/coffee/", "created_utc": 1369584407.0, "score": 106, "author": "Woefinder", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f33h5/coffee/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Avocados", "selftext": "Not all fat is bad for your body, and monounsaturated fat in particular is what constitutes the first health benefit of an avocado. In a typical avocado, most of the calories you receive come from monounsaturated fat. The monounsaturated fat in an avocado is healthy for you. Foods like avocados that contain monounsaturated fat lessen your LDL cholesterol, which is harmful to your body. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol has been called \"good cholesterol,\" and there is speculation that monounsaturated fat actually raises this type of cholesterol.\n\n**Research has shown that certain compounds in avocados are able to seek out pre-cancerous and cancerous oral cancer cells and destroy them without harming healthy cells.**\n\nAvocados are packed with vitamins. The vitamins that you can find in an avocado are B vitamins along with vitamin K and vitamin E. B vitamins help your body's metabolism and its maintenance of a healthy skin tone, while vitamin K plays a fundamental role in making sure that your bones grow properly and that your bone density is maintained in later life. Vitamin E is necessary to avoid conditions like retinopathy.\n\n**The high levels of folate in avocado are also protective against strokes. People who eat diets rich in folate have a much lower risk of stroke than those who don't.**\n\nAvocados are a great source of lutein, a carotenoid that works as an antioxidant and helps protect against eye disease. They also contain the related carotenoids zeaxanthin, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, as well as tocopherol (vitamin E).\n\n**Half an avocado contains 3.4 grams of fiber, including soluble and insoluble, both of which your body needs to keep the digestive system running smoothly. Plus, soluble fiber slows the breakdown of carbohydrates in your body, helping you feel full for longer. Avocados also contain oleic acid, a fat that activates the part of your brain that makes you feel full. Healthier unsaturated fats containing oleic acid have been shown to produce a greater feeling of satiety than less-healthy saturated fats and trans fats found in processed foods.**\n\nRich, creamy, and packed with beneficial monounsaturated fat, avocado slows digestion and helps keep blood sugar from spiking after a meal. A diet high in good fats may even help reverse insulin resistance, which translates to steadier blood sugar long-term.\n\n**One cup of avocado provides almost a quarter of your recommended daily intake of folate, a vitamin which cuts the risk of birth defects. If you\u2019re pregnant\u2014or planning to be\u2014avocados will help protect your unborn baby.**\n\nA high folate intake is also associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and heart disease. Does your family have a history of heart problems, or do you have risk factors (such as being overweight or smoking) for heart disease? Avocados could help keep your heart healthy.\n\n**As well as increasing feelings of fullness, the oleic acid in avocados can help reduce cholesterol levels. In one study, individuals eating an avocado-rich diet had a significant decrease in total cholesterol levels, including a decrease in LDL cholesterol. Their levels of HDL cholesterol (the healthy type) increased by 11 percent.**\n\nThe combination of avocado's high potassium content, 30 percent more than banana, with omega-3 and oleic acid are beneficial toward reducing blood pressure.\n\n**Inflammation is considered the basis of most non-contagious diseases. Avocados have an abundance of plant phytonutrient polyphenols and flavonoids, which have been discovered as anti-inflammatory agents.**\n\nAvocados can help protect against prostate and breast cancers.\n\n**The master antioxidant glutathione supports the liver and the nervous system. It is responsible for replenishing and recycling other antioxidants in the body. It is vital for a strong immune system, and avocado is one of the few foods that contain a considerable amount of glutathione.**\n\nNutrients and enzymes in avocado reduce inflammation in the stomach and small intestine's mucous lining. This also improves the body's ability to absorb carotenoids and nutrients.\n\n**A study's participants who ate salads with avocados absorbed five times the amount of carotenoids than those who did not include avocados. Carotenoids include beta carotene and lycopene. Beta carotene is a precursor to vitamin A, and lycopene is a compound that reduces stroke and prostate cancer risks.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*:\n\nServing Size 1/5 medium avocado (30 g/1 oz.)\nServings Per Container 5\n\nCalories 50 Calories from Fat 35\n\n% Daily Value*\nTotal Fat  4.5g\t7%\nSaturated Fat 0.5g\t3%\nTrans Fat 0g\t \nPolyunsaturated Fat 0.5g\t \nMonounsaturated Fat 3g\t \nCholesterol 0mg\t0%\nSodium  0mg\t0%\nPotassium 150mg\t4%\nTotal Carbohydrate 3g\t1%\nDietary Fiber 2g\t8%\nSugars 0g\t \nProtein  0g\n\nVitamin A 0%\t        \u2022\tVitamin C 4%\nCalcium 0%\t                \u2022\tIron 2%\nVitamin E 4%\t        \u2022\tThiamin 2%\nRiboflavin 4%\t        \u2022\tNiacin 4%\nVitamin B6 4%\t        \u2022      Folate 6%\nPantothenic Acid 4%\t\u2022\tPhosphorus 2%\nMagnesium 2%\t        \u2022      Zinc 2%\nCopper 2%\t                \u2022\tManganese 2%\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/eat-well/healthy-eating/5-surprising-health-benefits-of-eating-avocados)\n[Resource 2](http://www.naturalnews.com/040067_avocado_cancer_prevention_superfood.html)\n[Resource 3](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/avocado-health-benefits-3-reasons-you-should-be-eating-them.html#b)\n[Resource 4](http://www.healthdiaries.com/eatthis/10-health-benefits-of-avocados.html)\n[Resource 5](http://www.avocadocentral.com/nutrition/avocado-nutrition-health-facts-label)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1enlyh/avocados/", "created_utc": 1369001092.0, "score": 70, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1enlyh/avocados/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Bacon", "selftext": "Bacon contains several grams of complete protein per serving, and provides all nine amino acids you need in your diet. Your body uses protein to maintain lean muscle mass and hormone balance, aid in brain function and keep your other tissues healthy and functional. The average American needs approximately 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day, according to Iowa State University. This translates to 60 grams of protein daily for the average 150-pound individual. A 3-ounce serving of bacon contains 29 grams of protein.\n\n**Bacon and provides vitamin B-12, a nutrient important for healthy red blood cells. Vitamin B-12 allows you to make hemoglobin, the protein your blood needs to transport oxygen. Consuming enough B-12 also helps you metabolize fats and protein, plays a role in brain function and protects you from the nerve damage that can result from vitamin B-12 deficiency. A 3-ounce serving of bacon provides 1 microgram of vitamin B-12 -- 42 percent of your daily recommended intake, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements.**\n\nBacon contains iron, an essential mineral also important for hemoglobin production. Each hemoglobin protein contains four iron atoms, and consuming enough iron in your diet helps ensure that you can make enough hemoglobin to support red blood cell function. Iron also makes up a component of myoglobin, a protein your muscles use to store oxygen. A 3-ounce serving of bacon provides 0.8 milligrams of iron. Bacon can help you reach your recommended daily iron intake -- 18 milligrams for women and 8 milligrams for men, according to the Linus Pauling Institute.\n\n**The fats in bacon are about 50% monounsaturated and a large part of those is oleic acid. This is the same fatty acid that olive oil is praised for and generally considered \u201cheart-healthy\u201d.**\n\nAbout 68 percent of the calories in every ounce of bacon stem from fat, about half of which is saturated. Add 30 milligrams of cholesterol, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for high cholesterol, which leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and high blood pressure. A 2009 National Cancer Institute study with 617,000 participants found that men who consumed processed meats often -- including bacon -- had a 27 percent greater risk of heart disease; high-consuming women had a 50 percent greater risk than those who ate processed meats once per month or less. Similarly, a 2010 Harvard study found that consuming just one serving of bacon per day was associated with a 42 percent greater risk of cardiovascular disease over those who only consumed unprocessed meats. The study indicated that bacon\u2019s high levels of nitrites, a preservative, and sodium may play roles in the increased risk of heart disease.\n\n**Bacon consumption may lead to an increased risk of developing diabetes. The 2010 Harvard study indicated that consuming one serving of processed meats \u2013 including bacon -- every day led to a 19 percent greater chance of developing diabetes. Again, the increased risk was tied to bacon\u2019s sky-high levels of sodium and nitrites. According to \"The New York Times,\" processed meats such as bacon contain 400 percent more sodium and 50 percent more nitrites than unprocessed meat. A 2010 meta-study in the journal \u201cCirculation\u201d also linked the intake of processed meats with a 19 percent higher risk of developing diabetes.**\n\nBacon consumption has been linked to higher cancer rates. A 2012 study by the World Cancer Research Fund found a 19 percent increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer per every 50 grams of bacon consumed. Study participants who ate 150 grams \u2013 or six strips \u2013 of bacon each day had a 57 percent greater risk. The National Cancer Institute study also found 20 to 22 percent higher cancer rates among the participants who ate the most processed meats. Findings like these prompted the American Institute for Cancer Research to state that it\u2019s not safe to consume processed meat.\n\n**A 2007 study from Columbia University suggests that eating lots of bacon and other processed meats \u2013 at least 14 servings per month or more \u2013 increased the risk of contracting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. This research indicated that nitrites may be a culprit in COPD, which causes conditions such as emphysema and bronchitis.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 slice (7g) pork, cured, panfried\n\nCalories: 41\nCalories from Fat: 28\nTotal Fat: 3g 5% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 1g 5% of daily value\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 9mg 3% of daily value\nSodium: 188mg 8% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 0g\nDietary Fiber: 0g\nSugars: 0g\nProtein: 3g\nIron: 1% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/good-health-benefits-sausage-bacon-8236.html)\n[Resource 2](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/2681?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=&qlookup=&offset=&sort=&format=Abridged&_action_show=Apply+Changes&Qv=1&Q4968=7.4)\n[Resource 3](http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/harmful-effect-much-bacon-1456.html)\n[Resource 5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2544536/)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/pork-products/7356/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew8wc/bacon/", "created_utc": 1369303947.0, "score": 60, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew8wc/bacon/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Green Tea", "selftext": "Trying to lose weight? Green tea contains catechins, which are a type of antioxidant called polyphenol. Catechins increase metabolism, helping the body to burn fat faster.\n\n**Catechins are also antibacterial and antiviral agents, so green tea can reduce the risk for a variety of infections, dental conditions, and possibly even the spread of disease.**\n\nDiabetic? Green tea can help regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n**Green tea could help lower the risk of high blood pressure, as well as help the body handle changes in blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels. It may also reduce the risk of heart attacks by preventing clots from forming. However, in 2006 the U.S. FDA rejected a petition to allow labels to declare that green teas reduce the risk of heart disease.**\n\nThe antioxidants found in green tea can neutralize free radicals, which are linked to aging, cancer, and other diseases.\n\n**Studies indicate that green tea kills certain cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. It has been linked with lower risk for bladder, breast, and ovarian cancer. There is conflicting evidence about its effects on colon, rectal, esophageal, lung, pancreatic, prostate, skin, and stomach cancers.**\n\nGreen tea has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties than can reduce signs of aging. The anti-inflammatory properties can also be helpful for those suffering from arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. \n\n**Green tea has been shown to reduce bad cholesterol and possibly raise good cholesterol.**\n\nGreen tea can protect and restore brain cells, which delays deterioration caused by degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n**Studies have shown that green tea may increase bone mineral density and reduce fibrosis.**\n\nPeople who drank more than 10 cups of green tea a day were at a reduced risk of liver disease.

{"title": "Hummus", "selftext": "Chickpeas (found in hummus) are legumes that are also called garbanzo beans. Beans such as chickpeas are an excellent source of fiber, which can help you keep cholesterol levels low and promote better heart health. Fiber-rich chickpeas also help diabetics regulate blood sugar levels, making hummus a particularly diabetes-friendly snack as well. The high fiber in chickpeas also helps promote a healthier digestive tract and fend off constipation.\n\n**Thank the fiber in chickpeas for making hummus a snack that fills you up and stays with you. Fiber helps you feel full and stay full, so that you won't be reaching for another snack shortly after you finish eating. Hummus is also very low in calories and fat. A 2 tbsp.-serving has only about 50 calories and 3 g of fat.**\n\nWhen you drizzle olive oil into your food processor with the garbanzo beans to make hummus, you're adding healthy fats. Olive oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are thought to be heart-healthy. These healthy fats help to lower cholesterol levels, promote healthier blood clotting and help manage blood sugar in diabetics.\n\n**Hummus can lower your risk of heart disease by lowering risk factors such as elevated cholesterol and blood pressure. According to a study published in the \"Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism,\" adding chickpeas to your diet can lower total and LDL cholesterol, the so-called \"bad\" cholesterol. The sesame seeds in the tahini paste contain high levels of magnesium, which can also help lower cholesterol as well as blood pressure. The antioxidants from garlic and the monounsaturated fatty acids in olive oil can both lower cholesterol, improve blood flow and reduce risk of atherosclerosis.**\n\nHummus may be able to help reduce the risk of cancer due to the antioxidant activity of chickpeas and garlic. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, garlic contains an abundance of antioxidants which have been reported to reduce the risk of colon and stomach cancers. Among dry beans, chickpeas contain one of the highest levels of polyphenols, a plant chemical which also acts as an antioxidant.\n\n**In some parts of the world (for example, parts of India), garbanzo beans are eaten daily in large amounts and on a year-round basis. But a recent study has shown that we can obtain health benefits from garbanzo beans even when we eat much smaller amounts over a much shorter period of time. In this study, it took only one week of garbanzo bean consumption to improve participants' control of blood sugar and insulin secretion. Equally important, only one-third cup of the beans per day was needed to provide these blood-sugar related health benefits.**\n\nHummus is good for pregnant women. Hummus is rich in folic acid, a vitamin B complex that helps in the brain development of the fetus and promotes well-being for the mother.\n\n**It helps in getting a good mood and sleep: Large amount of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were found in hummus. These amino acids help in promoting well-rested sleep and uplift one\u2019s mood; and so eating hummus everyday can lead to satisfying shut eye.**\n\nAids in controlling glucose levels: Hummus has low glycemic value. This helps in controlling the increase of your glucose levels, which are beneficial to hyperglycemic patients.\n\n**Garbanzos are a food you definitely want to keep on your \"digestive support\" list\u2014especially if you are focusing on the colon. Between 65-75% of the fiber found in garbanzo beans is insoluble fiber, and this type of fiber remains undigested all the way down to the final segment of your large intestine (colon). Recent studies have shown that garbanzo bean fiber can be metabolized by bacteria in the colon to produce relatively large amounts of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic, propionic, and butyric acid. These SCFAs provide fuel to the cells that line your intestinal wall. By supporting the energy needs of our intestinal cells, the SCFAs made from garbanzo fibers can help lower your risk of colon problems, including your risk of colon cancer.**\n\nMany of our body systems are susceptible to oxidative stress and damage from reactive oxygen molecules. These systems include our cardiovascular system, our lungs, and our nervous system. Plentiful amounts of antioxidant nutrients are critical for the support of these body systems, and garbanzo beans are a remarkable food in terms of their antioxidant composition. While containing small but valuable amounts of conventional antioxidant nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, garbanzo beans also contain more concentrated supplies of antioxidant phytonutrients. These phytonutrients include the flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin (usually found in the outer layer of the beans), and the phenolic acids ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and vanillic acid (usually found in the interior portion of the beans). Depending on the type of bean and color/thickness of the outer layer, garbanzo beans can also contain significant amounts of the anthocyanins delphinidin, cyanidin, and petunidin. The mineral manganese\u2014a key antioxidant in the energy-producing mitochondria found inside most cells\u2014is also provided in excellent amounts by garbanzo beans. In fact, just one cup of garbanzos can provide you with nearly 85% of the Daily Value (DV) for this key antioxidant. An increasing number of animal and human studies clearly show the ability of garbanzo beans to reduce our risk of heart disease, and we believe that an important part of this risk reduction is due to the fantastic antioxidant make-up of these legumes.\n\n**Chickpeas cause flatulence (not necessarily a bad thing.)**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (246g) commercial hummus\n\nCalories: 408\nCalories from Fat: 198\nTotal Fat: 24g 36% of daily value \nSaturated Fat: 4g 18% of daily value \nTrans Fat: 0g \nCholesterol: 0mg \nSodium: 932mg 39% of daily value \nTotal Carbohydrate: 35g 12% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 15g 59% of daily value\nSugars: 0g \nProtein: 19g\nVitamin A: 1% of daily value\nCalcium: 9% of daily value\nIron 33% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/446490-what-are-the-health-benefits-of-hummus/)\n[Resource 2](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/hummus-healthy-5821.html)\n[Resource 3](http://www.simple-remedies.com/health-food/benefits-of-eating-hummus.html)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=58)\n[Resource 5](http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-foods-give-you-gas.html#vply=0)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4407/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew9uh/hummus/", "created_utc": 1369305817.0, "score": 48, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew9uh/hummus/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Oats", "selftext": "The soluble fiber in oats absorb a considerable amount of water and when made into oatmeal significantly slows down your digestive process. This result is that you'll feel full longer, i.e. oatmeal can help you control your weight.\n\n**Oats are a very good source of selenium. A necessary cofactor of the important antioxidant, glutathione peroxidase, selenium works with vitamin E in numerous vital antioxidant systems throughout the body. These powerful antioxidant actions make selenium helpful in decreasing asthma symptoms and in the prevention of heart disease. In addition, selenium is involved in DNA repair and is associated with a reduced risk for cancer, especially colon cancer.**\n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL, the \"bad\" cholesterol) is reduced without adverse effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol), or triglyceride concentrations.\n\n**Type 2 diabetes patients given foods high in this type of oat fiber or given oatmeal or oat bran rich foods experienced much lower rises in blood sugar compared to those who were given white rice or bread. Starting out your day with a blood sugar stabilizing food such as oats may make it easier to keep blood sugar levels under control the rest of the day, especially when the rest of your day is also supported with nourishing fiber-rich foods.**\n\nResearch suggests that regular consumption of oats also reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is because oats and other whole grains are a rich source of magnesium, a mineral that acts as a co-factor for more than 300 enzymes, including enzymes involved in the body's use of glucose and insulin secretion.\n\n**Beta-glucan which can be found in oats, significantly enhances the human immune system's response to bacterial infection. Beta-glucan not only helps neutrophils (the most abundant type of non-specific immune cell) navigate to the site of an infection more quickly, it also enhances their ability to eliminate the bacteria they find there.**\n\nStudies have found that when children eat oats it can decrease their chance of developing asthma.\n\n**Although treatment of celiac disease has been thought to require lifelong avoidance of the protein gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley and oats, recent studies of adults have shown that oats, despite the small amount of gluten they contain, are well-tolerated. Now, a double blind, multi-center study involving 8 clinics treating 116 children newly diagnosed celiac disease suggests oats are a good grain choice for children with celiac disease as well. The children were randomly assigned to receive either the standard gluten-free diet (no wheat, barley, rye or oats) or a gluten-free diet with some wheat-free oat products. At the end of the study, which ran for a year, all the children were doing well, and in both groups, the mucosal lining of the small bowel (which is damaged by wheat gluten in celiac disease) had healed and the immune system (which is excessively reactive in celiac patients) had returned to normal.**\n\nConsuming oats can provide favorable changes in the physical characteristics of LDL cholesterol particles, making them less susceptible to oxidation (oxidation is thought to lead to hardening of the arteries.)\n\n**Studies have shown that when postmenopausal women ate oats it slowed the progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows. Eating oats also was shown to lessen the progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.**\n\nWhen women consume oats it greatly decreases their chance of developing breast cancer.\n\n**Oats are on the short list for the highest protein levels of any grain.**\n\nThe only real negative side effect is that eating oats can cause gas and bloating.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (156g)\nCalories: 607\nCalories from Fat: 90\nTotal Fat: 11g 17% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 2g 9% of daily value\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 3mg\nTotal Carbohydrate: 103g 34% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 17g 66% of daily value\nSugars: 0g\nProtein: 26g\nCalcium: 8% of daily value\nIron: 41% of daily value\n\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080108102225.htm)\n[Resource 2](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100216/Eat-heart-healthy-oats-to-prevent-atherosclerosis.aspx)\n[Resource 3](http://www.healthcastle.com/oats-cholesterol.shtml)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=54)\n[Resource 5](http://www.livestrong.com/article/494189-what-are-the-benefits-of-eating-oatmeal-every-morning/)\n[Resource 6](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-814-OATS.aspx?activeIngredientId=814&activeIngredientName=OATS)\n[Resource 7](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5708/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f2wdu/oats/", "created_utc": 1369575457.0, "score": 45, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f2wdu/oats/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Grapes", "selftext": "The most crucial benefit you derive from eating grapes is production of anti-oxidants in your body. Grapes are rich in antioxidants due to the presence of phytonutrients called polyphenols. These antioxidants bind with the \u201cfree radicals\u201d present in  your body and reduce the risk of plague formation on the arteries, thus improving your heart\u2019s health. Grapes also help in the generation of nitric oxide in the body. This compound helps improve heart health by reducing blood clots, platelet aggregation and oxidation of LDL (which causes plagues on the arteries).\n\n**Thanks to their antioxidant properties, grapes also offer some measure of protection against cancer. Studies have found that grape seed extract can kill leukemia cells and head and neck cancer cells, and can prevent the growth of breast, stomach, colon, prostate and lung cancer cells in laboratory experiments.**\n\nResveratrol, a polyphenol found in grape skins and seed, keeps the heart muscles flexible and healthy. Resveratrol also breaks down bad cholesterol. The reason why \u201cred wines\u201d have gained popularity is because of their high concentration of Resveratrol. The French who eat a high fat diet have been found to have low heart disease stats, a phenomenon known as the \u201cFrench Paradox, which is largely owning to their consumption of red wine and grapes.\n\n**Although few large-scale clinical studies have been conducted, evidence points toward consumption of grapes as being beneficial for brain health. An animal study at the University of Houston found that rats fed a grape-enriched diet experienced reduced anxiety and learning and memory problems brought on by anxiety. Another study found that participants who drank a glass of Concord grape juice daily scored better on the California Verbal Learning Test than participants who did not. Key antioxidant components of grapes have also been linked to improved brain health. In 2008, researchers at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University reported that supplementing with resveratrol, commonly found in grapes, reduced plaque formation, a factor associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and other related diseases, in animal brains.**\n\nThanks to presence of antioxidant compounds in grapes, it helps bind free radicals in the body. These free radicals or \u201coxidants\u201d are responsible for instigating cancer formation in various organs of the body. It has been studied that drinking red wine can reduce the risk of lung cancer by 13%, owing to high concentration of antioxidants like resveratrol. You can get the same benefit from eating purple grapes on daily basis, if you don\u2019t want to drink red wine.\n\n**It has been found the grapes have several anti-microbial properties but they are not harmful to the beneficial bacteria in the stomach. Tests have shown that grape extracts inhibited the growth of 14 different types of harmful bacteria commonly found in human intestine and stomach including E coli, Salmonella and H. pylori (which causes stomach ulcers).**\n\nStudies from the University of Missouri-Columbia show that grapes prevent brain damage in the event of a stroke.\n\n**Grapes have a significant amount of potassium and increase brain activity.**\n\nThe fiber found in grapes occurs in two forms, known as soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber is found in the soft part of grapes. In the digestive tract, it forms a gel that can promote regular bowel movements. Grape peels contain insoluble fiber, which helps food move through the digestive tract more quickly. These types of fiber act as natural laxatives, so eating large quantities of grapes may cause loose stools or gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: 100g of grapes\nCalories: 60\nCarbohydrates: 15 g\nSugar: 15 g\nProteins: 21g\nFat: 21g\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.outofstress.com/grapes-good-for-you/)\n[Resource 2](http://www.med.umich.edu/cvc/)\n[Resource 3](http://www.livestrong.com/article/547902-negative-effects-of-eating-grapes/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/inside_fordham/february_6_2012/news/want_better_vision_e_81620.asp)\n[Resource 5](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/eating_purple_grapes_and_potential_health_benefits)\n[Resource 6](http://hsibaltimore.com/2003/12/24/the-health-benefits-of-eating-grapes/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eu1ce/grapes/", "created_utc": 1369231381.0, "score": 40, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eu1ce/grapes/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Soda", "selftext": "One of the benefits of drinking soda is that it contains caffeine, a natural stimulant found in the kola nut, coffee beans and tea leaves. Caffeine makes you feel more alert when you're tired and might increase your performance when embarking on certain tasks. According to the International Food Council Information Foundation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has recognized caffeine as an additive that's Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS, since the late 1950s. Moderate consumption of caffeine -- around 300 mg -- is generally not harmful for healthy adults, although some people are more sensitive to caffeine. A 12 oz. can of Coke contains 34 mg of caffeine, far less than the average cup of coffee, which contains 85 mg of caffeine.\n\n**Danish researchers discovered that drinking non-diet soda leads to dramatic increases in fat buildup around your liver and your skeletal muscles, both of which can contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes. The study revealed that people who drank a regular soda every day for six months saw a 132 to 142 percent increase in liver fat, a 117 to 221 percent jump in skeletal fat, and about a 30 percent increase in both triglyceride blood fats and other organ fat. Their consumption also led to an 11 percent increase in cholesterol, compared with the people who drank other beverages such as water or milk.**\n\nResearchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center monitored 475 adults for 10 years, and found that those who drank diet soda had a 70 percent increase in waist circumference over the 10-year study, compared with those who didn't drink any soda. Those who drank more than two diet sodas per day saw a 500 percent waist expansion! A separate study the same researchers conducted on mice suggested that it was the aspartame, which raised blood glucose levels, that caused the weight gain; when your liver encounters too much glucose, the excess is converted to body fat.\n\n**Beverages with bubbles contain phosphoric acid, which can severely deplete the blood calcium levels; calcium is a key component of the bone matrix. With less concentration of calcium over a long time, it can lower deposition rates so that bone mass and density suffer. This means that drinking sodas and carbonated water increases your risk of osteoporosis.**\n\nTwo contaminants in the coloring of many sodas, 2-methylimidazole and 4-methylimidazole, have been found to cause cancer in animals, a threat deemed unnecessary, considering that the coloring is purely cosmetic. According to California's strict Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer, just 16 micrograms per person per day of 4-methylimidazole is enough to pose a cancer threat, and most popular brown colas, both diet and regular, contain 200 micrograms per 20-ounce bottle.\n\n**Diet or regular, all colas contain phosphates, or phosphoric acid, a weak acid that gives colas their tangy flavor and improves their shelf life. Although it exists in many whole foods, such as meat, dairy, and nuts, too much phosphoric acid can lead to heart and kidney problems, muscle loss, and osteoporosis, and one study suggests it could trigger accelerated aging. The study, published in a 2010 issue of the FASEB Journal, found that the excessive phosphate levels found in sodas caused lab rats to die a full five weeks earlier than the rats whose diets had more normal phosphate levels\u2014a disturbing trend considering that soda manufacturers have been increasing the levels of phosphoric acid in their products over the past few decades.**\n\nResearchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School analyzed data from the Nurses' Health Study II, a trial tracking the health of more than 51,000 women. None of the participants had diabetes at the onset of the study in 1991. Over the following 8 years, 741 women were diagnosed with the disease. Researchers found that women who drank one or more sugary drinks a day gained more weight and were 83% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who imbibed less than once a month.\n\n**Another problem with sodas is that they act as dehydrating diuretics. Both caffeine and sugar cause dehydration. Caffeine is a diuretic and causes an increase in urine volume. High concentration of sugar is drawing off water because your kidneys try to expel the excess sugar out of the blood. When you drink a caffeinated soda to quench your thirst, you will actually become more thirsty.**\n\nDiet soda is filled with artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin. These artificial sweeteners pose a threat to your health. Saccharin, for instance, has been found to be carcinogenic, and studies have found that it produced bladder cancer in rats.\n\n**Soda, no matter who makes it, is the most acidic beverage you can buy, with a pH of about 2.5, about the same as vinegar, but the sugar content disguises the acidity. To put that into perspective, consider that battery acid has a pH of 1 and pure water has a pH level of 7. Why does that matter? Throughout the digestive system, that starts from the mouth and ends up at the anus only the stomach can resist an acidic environment up to pH 2.0. But before the acidity of soft drink reaches the stomach it passes through all the other organs involved in the digestive system thus causing an abnormal acidic environment. The linings of the mouth, pharynx and esophagus are highly sensitive to acids. The phosphoric acid present in soft drink competes with the hydrochloric acid of the stomach and affects its functions. When the stomach becomes ineffective, food remains undigested causing indigestion, gassiness or bloating (swelling of stomach).**\n\ncaffeine usually present in soft drinks, and you are in for even more trouble. Caffeine can deplete the body\u2019s calcium, in addition to stimulating your central nervous system and contributing to stress, a racing mind, and insomnia.\n\n**Rapidly absorbed carbohydrates like high fructose corn syrup put more strain on insulin-producing cells than other foods. When sugar enters the bloodstream quickly, the pancreas has to secrete large amounts of insulin for the body to process it. Some scientists believe that the unceasing demands that a soda habit places on the pancreas may ultimately leave it unable to keep up with the body's need for insulin. Also, insulin itself becomes less effective at processing sugar; both conditions contribute to the risk of developing diabetes.**\n\nTake a look at the ingredients list for any soda and chances are most of those ingredients are derived from corn. As much as 88 percent of the corn grown in the U.S. is genetically modified to resist toxic pesticides or engineered to create pesticides within the plant itself. Thanks to lax government safety regulations, and tight corporate control over who gets to test these proprietary seeds, there are no human studies that can prove or disprove whether these crops are safe. Independent scientists have found that, in animals, genetically modified crops, or GMOs, are linked to digestive tract damage, accelerated aging, and even infertility. Most recently, scientists in France found that rats fed GMO corn for their entire two-year lifespan developed mammary tumors and died earlier than rats that ate non-GMO corn their entire lives.\n\n**Soft drink consumption is a strong predictor of heartburn.**\n\nAspartame, commonly known as nutrasweet, is a chemical that stimulates the brain to think the food is sweet. It breaks down into acpartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol at a temperature of 86 degrees. (Remember, your stomach is somewhere around 98 degrees.) An article put out by the University of Texas found that aspartame has been linked to obesity. The process of stimulating the brain causes more cravings for sweets and leads to carbohydrate loading.\n\n**Soda eats up and dissolves the tooth enamel. Researches say that soft drinks are responsible for doubling or tripling the incidence of tooth decay. The acidity can dissolve the mineral content of the enamel, making the teeth weaker, more sensitive, and more susceptible to decay. Soda's acidity makes it even worse for teeth than the solid sugar found in candy. Dental experts continue to urge that people drink less soda pop, especially between meals, to prevent tooth decay and dental erosion.**\n\nExperts have reasons to believe that overconsumption of fructose, particularly in the form of soft drinks, leads to an increase in blood pressure.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size = 12 fl oz (of coke)\nCalories: 98\nCarbs: 27 g\nSodium: 9 mg\nCaffeine: 24 mg\n\n*Links*: [Source 1](http://www.rodale.com/facts-about-soda?page=1)\n\n[Source 20](http://www.livestrong.com/article/475742-what-are-benefits-of-drinking-coke/)\n\n[Source 3](http://health.yahoo.net/experts/drmao/what-soft-drinks-are-doing-your-body)\n\n[Source 4](http://www.emedexpert.com/tips/soft-drinks.shtml)\n\n[Source 5](http://www.quitehealthy.com/nutrition-facts/coke/SD1771.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en2vr/soda/", "created_utc": 1368985854.0, "score": 44, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en2vr/soda/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Bananas", "selftext": "EDIT - **TL;DR - PROS: Bananas help with alertness, blood sugar, nausea, fever, smoking withdrawal effects, stomach ulcers, acid reflux, digestion issues, swelling, anemia, low mood, sweet cravings, muscles in the heart and nervous system, calcium loss, and more. CONS: None.**\n\n*Pros*\n\nBananas make you smarter and help with learning by making you more alert. Eat a banana before an exam to benefit from the high levels of potassium.\n\n**Bananas are high in antioxidants, providing free radicals and protection from chronic disease.**\n\nEating a banana between meals helps stabilize blood sugar and reduce nausea from morning sickness.\n\n**Control blood sugar and avoid binging between meals by eating a banana.**\n\nEating a banana can lower the body temperature and cool you during a fever or on a hot day.\n\n**Quitting smoking? Bananas contain high levels of B-vitamins as well as potassium and magnesium speed recovery from the effects of withdrawal.**\n\nBananas are the only raw fruit that can be consumed without distress to relieve stomach ulcers by coating the lining of the stomach against corrosive acids.\n\n**Bananas are a natural antacid, providing relief from acid reflux, heartburn and GERD.**\n\nGot the runs? Bananas are soothing to the digestive tract and help restore lost electrolytes after diarrhea.\n\n**Constipated? High fiber in bananas can help normalize bowel motility.**\n\nBananas act as a prebiotic, stimulating the growth of friendly bacteria in the bowel. They also produce digestive enzymes to assist in absorbing nutrients.\n\n**Rich in pectin, bananas aid digestion and gently chelate toxins and heavy metals from the body**\n\nStrengthen your blood and relieve anemia with the added iron from bananas\n\n**Bananas reduce swelling, protect against type II diabetes, aid weight loss, strengthen the nervous system, and help with the production of white blood cells, all due to high levels of vitamin B-6**\n\nBananas contain a natural mood enhancer, tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts to serotonin. Serotonin is known to make the body feel relaxed and improves good mood thus preventing seasonal depression.\n\n**Because of their great taste, they can also serve as a substitute for sweets to satisfy sugar cravings. The convenience and nutritional value of bananas make them good post-exercise snack. During long exercises, bananas can give the immediate energy you need.**\n\nBananas contain a high dose of potassium - an essential ingredient to keep your heart and nervous system in good shape. Potassium is essential for proper muscle contraction and hence plays an important role in muscle-influenced activities including: the normal rhythmic pumping of the heart, digestion, muscular movements, etc., Some studies have also linked low potassium intake to high blood pressure and increased risk of stroke.\n\n**Benefits to the kidneys and the bones are again due to the high potassium content of bananas. A normal intake of potassium suppresses calcium excretion in the urine and minimizes the risk of kidney stones. Also, for the same reason (suppressing of calcium excretion), it minimizes the loss of calcium from the body and thereby reduces the risk of osteoporosis.**\n\nBananas are one of the highest sources of naturally available vitamin B6: Vitamin B6 plays an important role in converting tryptophan to serotonin (read #3 above), and also helps the body to make hemoglobin - a crucial ingredient of your blood. Vitamin B6 is also essential for antibody production and to maintain a healthy immune response. It also helps to convert carbohydrates to glucose and thereby maintains proper blood sugar levels. A medium banana can take care of 1/5 of your daily recommended intake of vitamin B6 and is one of the easiest (and cheapest) ways to increase your dietary intake of the vitamin .\n\n**A single serving (one medium-sized banana) contains 16% of the daily recommended dietary fiber intake for a normal adult - that\u2019s substantial for a single serving of any food. Fiber improves laxation (smooth bowel movements). Fiber-rich diets have also been linked to lower risk of coronary heart disease and of type 2 diabetes.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: \nServing size = 1 medium sufficiently ripe banana [about 7\u2033 long and 126 grams (0.28 pounds) in weight]\n\nTotal Fat = 0 g; Cholesterol = 0 g; Calories = 110\n\nPotassium = 400 mg (10% of daily recommended value)\n\nDietary Fiber = 4 g (16% of daily recommended value)\n\nSugar = 14.8 g; Protein = 1 g (2% of daily recommended value)\n\nVitamin C = 16% of daily recommended value\n\nVitamin B6 = 20% of daily recommended value\n\n\n\n*Links*: \n[Source 1](http://thetaoofgoodhealth.com/6-awesome-health-benefits-of-bananas-9/)\n\n[Source 2](http://www.fnri.dost.gov.ph/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=1036)\n\n[Source 3](http://foodmatters.tv/articles-1/25-powerful-reasons-to-eat-bananas)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1dzktv/bananas/", "created_utc": 1368081649.0, "score": 38, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1dzktv/bananas/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sparkling Water", "selftext": "The most important nutritional benefit of sparkling water is hydration. Water makes up 60 percent of your total body weight. A dehydrated cell dies rapidly. Every system in your body relies on water, and water is needed to flush out toxins and moisten your nose, mouth, throat and lungs. Sparkling water is as effective as regular spring water or tap water in replacing fluids lost in urine or sweat.\n\n**Got an upset stomach? Feeling queasy? Ate too much fatty or spicy food? Rather than reach for the antacids, try drinking a glass of seltzer. Researchers have found that people with both indigestion and constipation who drank at least 1 1/2 liters of carbonated water every day for 15\u201330 days had a big improvement in their symptoms compared to people who drank regular tap water.**\n\nSparkling mineral water is known to reduce LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels. Elevated levels of LDL can cause cardiovascular issues such as high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\n**This may sound odd, but in a study where postmenopausal women were given a carbonated mineral water to drink, after two months, these women had lower LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) and higher HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol level, as well as lower fasting glucose levels, compared to women who drank regular water. The mineral water used in this study contained bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. It\u2019s thought that the alkaline pH of the water affected absorption and excretion of cholesterol.Carbonated waters do not leech calcium from bones, nor do they contribute to kidney stone formation. However, there may be people who need to limit their intake of fizzy water. If you have irritable bowel syndrome, you might want to go easy on all fizzy drinks as they can make you even more bloated than you already may be. People with acid reflux should be careful about carbonated beverages, as drinking them may sometimes aggravate symptoms. Also, if you need to watch your sodium intake, go for seltzer instead of club soda. Club soda contains about 60 to 80 milligrams of sodium per serving, whereas seltzer has none.**\n\nSparkling mineral water contains bicarbonate. Bicarbonate helps balance sodium levels in the body.\n\n**The Journal of Nutrition study found that the drinking of the sodium-rich mineral water did not lead to any increase in blood pressure. One reason for this is that sparkling waters tend to be rich in bicarbonate, which is believed to help balance any negative effects sodium may have in the body.**\n\nOne of the myths out there is that drinking fizzy water will erode tooth enamel. This probably stems from the fact that when carbon dioxide gas is pumped into water, small amounts of carbonic acid are formed. But studies have shown that this small amount of acid doesn\u2019t hurt your teeth. In fact, fizzy waters contain calcium and other minerals (albeit, in small amounts) that can actually buffer the carbonic acid and protect tooth enamel. On the other hand both regular and diet soda contain phosphoric acid and/or citric acid, which can be harmful to dental enamel.\n\n**Sparkling mineral water can help increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Increased levels of HDL (\"good\" cholesterol) can reduce cardiovascular issues such as heart disease and high blood pressure.**\n\nCarbonation found in sparkling mineral water can kill harmful bacteria. Bacteria can cause infections and attack the immune system.\n\n**As the carbonated water fizzes and bubbles in the stomach, it can cause a buildup of air, and this can lead to loud belching. This belching can sometimes become uncontrollable. This buildup of air can also cause abdominal distension, or bloating. If enough carbonated water is consumed, you can suffer from painful, chronic bloating. The pain from bloating can even be mistaken for other illnesses such as appendicitis, and you may even feel the need to seek medical help.**\n\nCarbonated beverages can cause an excess production of stomach acid, which can irritate the stomach lining and cause a peptic ulcer. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, peptic ulcers are open sores in the stomach lining, esophagus or the first part of the intestine, also called the duodenum. This can cause significant pain and even lead to bleeding in the stomach. Some people also vomit blood or have black stools caused by the bleeding in the stomach. This condition requires immediate medical treatment.\n\n**Carbonated water can cause a buildup of air that can move down the digestive tract and into the colon, causing flatulence. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, one sure way to avoid flatulence is to avoid carbonated beverages all together.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size: 1 serving\nCalories: 0 (nothing else to report on)\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.drbriffa.com/2005/01/23/sparkling-water/)\n[Resource 2](http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/Blog/Amy-Campbell/carbonated-water-yes-or-no/)\n[Resource 3](http://www.ehow.com/facts_4869228_health-benefits-sparkling-mineral-water.html)\n[Resource 4](http://www.livestrong.com/article/343521-sparkling-water-nutrition/)\n[Resource 5](http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-olive-garden-san-pellegrino-sparkling-i127844)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epbpk/sparkling_water/", "created_utc": 1369068966.0, "score": 32, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epbpk/sparkling_water/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Kale", "selftext": "Per calorie, kale has more iron than beef. Iron is essential for good health, such as the formation of hemoglobin and enzymes, transporting oxygen to various parts of the body, cell growth, proper liver function and more.\n\n**Eating a diet high in Vitamin K can help protect against various cancers. It is also necessary for a wide variety of bodily functions including normal bone health and the prevention of blood clotting. Also increased levels of vitamin K can help people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Eat More Kale!**\n\nEating more kale can help lower cholesterol levels.\n\n**Sick of spending money on anti-wrinkle creams? Eat more kale.  It's a superstar in the arena of carotenoids and flavonoids, two powerful antioxidants that protect our cells from free radicals that cause oxidative stress. With the addition of high doses of celebrity antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin A, and manganese, kale is a smart choice in the battle against cellular oxidation.**\n\nOne cup of kale provides about 10% of the RDA of omega-3 fatty acids that helps regulate the body\u2019s inflammatory process.  A megadose of vitamin K further aids to fight against excessive inflammatory-related problems, such as arthritis, autoimmune disorders, and asthma. Kale's whopping dose of vitamin K (there's 1327% of the RDA in one cup) is necessary for the synthesis of osteocalcin, a protein that strengthens the composition of our bones.\n\n**With over 192% of the RDA of vitamin A, one cup of kale keeps our eyesight sharp, is an effective antioxidant, boosts immunity, maintains healthy bones and teeth, prevents urinary stones, and is essential to our reproductive organs. Kale also has plenty of star anti-oxidant vitamin C, which lowers blood pressure, ensures a healthy immune system, and fights against age-related ocular diseases, such as cataracts and macular degeneration.**\n\nKale can be likened to the superhero of vegetables, especially green leafy ones. Deep green kale contains the highest levels of antioxidants of all vegetables. Kale's high content of flavonoids and antioxidants work together to prevent and even combat cancer, in particular colon, breast, bladder, prostate, ovarian cancers, and gastric cancer.\n\n**One cup of kale contains nearly 20% of the RDA of dietary fiber, which promotes regular digestion, prevents constipation, lowers blood sugar and curbs overeating. Kale contains the glucosinolate isothiocyanate (ITC) that fights the formation of H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori), a bacterial growth in the stomach lining that can lead to gastric cancer.**\n\nThe high fiber content of kale lowers our cholesterol by binding with bile acids that the liver produces from cholesterol for digesting fat. Because many of these bile acids are coupled with fiber, the liver is charged with producing more bile acid to digest fat, and therefore requires more cholesterol to so, ultimately lowering the amount of cholesterol within our bodies.\n\n**Per calorie, kale has more calcium than milk, which aids in preventing bone loss, preventing osteoporosis and maintaining a healthy metabolism. Vitamin C is also helpful to maintain cartilage and joint flexibility.**\n\nThe healthy balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids keep your body strong, healthy and beautiful from the inside out.

{"title": "Broccoli", "selftext": "Broccoli is a source of many substances called phytochemicals, or plant chemicals, that may have anticancer properties. \n\n**Broccoli contains a high amount of potassium, which helps maintain a healthy nervous system and optimal brain function, as well as promotes regular muscle growth.**\n\nIt contains two fitokemikal compounds called indoles and isothiocyanates. fitokemikal works to increase the activity of enzyme that acts to destroy carcinogenic agents. Broccoli has anti-cancer agents such as glucoraphanin, beta-carotene, diindolylmethane, selenium and other nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, potassium, zinc and amino acids which are able to prevent the growth of cancer cells in the breast, uterus, prostate gland, intestine, kidney, liver and lungs.\n\n**Along with a high amount of potassium, Broccoli also contains magnesium and calcium that help regulate blood pressure.**\n\nOne cup of broccoli contains the RDA of vitamin C, an antioxidant necessary for fighting against free radicals. Moreover, vitamin C is an effective antihistamine for easing the discomfort of the common cold.\n\n**Broccoli contains high levels of both calcium and vitamin K, both of which are important for bone health and prevention of osteoporosis.**\n\nBroccoli is helpful in repairing skin damage thanks to the glucoraphanin it contains which helps the skin to detoxify and repair itself.\n\n**One cup of broccoli bolsters the immune system with a large dose of beta-carotene. Trace minerals, such as zinc and selenium, further act to strengthen immune defense actions.**\n\nBroccoli is high in fiber, which aids in digestion, prevents constipation, maintains low blood sugar, and curbs overeating. Furthermore, a cup of broccoli has as much protein as a cup of rice or corn with half the calories.\n\n**Studies have shown that the carotenoid lutein helps prevent age-related macular degeneration and cataracts, as well as possesses anti-cancer effects. Additionally, broccoli is a good source of vitamin A that is needed to form retinal, the light-absorbing molecule that is essential for both low-light and color vision.**\n\nThe carotenoid lutein may also slow down or prevent the thickening of arteries in the human body, thus fighting against heart disease and stoke. The B6 and folate in broccoli also reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, heart attack, and stroke.\n\n**Broccoli played a role in freeing the body from free radicals and toxins, and also prevents ulcers, itching, arthritis, kidney stones, rashes, gout and eczema.**\n\nIn pregnant period a women need the essential nutrients to maintaining growth fetus health. Broccoli contains all the essential nutrients needed by a pregnant woman such as antioxidants, calcium, protein, vitamins, detoxifiers, phosphorus and iron.\n\n**Broccoli contains mineral called chromium which helps in proper functioning of hormone insulin. This is one way to keep blood sugar levels steady.**\n\nAnemia caused by iron deficiency. Broccoli is a good source of iron, so it can be used as an effective cure for anemia.\n\n\n**Avoid overeating broccoli. Broccoli has been shown to alter how your thyroid operates. Eating too much of any cruciferous vegetable can be unhealthy.

{"title": "Gatorade", "selftext": "Electrolytes, including sodium, potassium and chloride, are nutrients and are essential for the body to function properly. During heavy physical exertion, the human body perspires as a way to eliminate toxins and cool the body through evaporation. Electrolytes are components of perspiration. Heavy sweating can result in a significant loss of electrolytes. Gatorade contains all three of these is essential elements and can help to replenish losses due to excessive perspiration.\n\n**Potassium is the other major electrolyte found in Gatorade, although its overall concentration is quite low when compared to sodium. Potassium losses in perspiration are just a fraction of sodium losses, which is why an 8-ounce serving of Gatorade provides only 30 milligrams of potassium. Despite the smaller quantities, replacing the potassium is important in prolonged exercise lasting more than 90 minutes. Potassium works with sodium to maintain proper fluid balance and also helps to trigger the electrical impulses that signal the muscles to contract and relax.**\n\nAnother downside to excessive perspiration is the loss of fluids within the body. Proper hydration is essential to maintaining high levels of performance, particularly for those involved in athletic activities. Gatorade can provide significant quantities of water to help support hydration requirements while a person is involved in heavy physical activity. The osmality of Gatorade, the number of particles in solution, is slightly higher than that of blood. That, along with the electrolytes and carbohydrates in the drink, provide for rapid absorption, according to Gatorade.com.\n\n**Gatorade also contains a carbohydrates in the form of sucrose and dextrose, which are an essential fuel source for optimal muscle function during physical exertion. These simple carbohydrates break down easily within the body. According to Gatorade.com, the sports drink contains 14 g of carbohydrates per 8 oz. serving, offering a significant source of readily available food energy.**\n\nProbably the most common consequence of drinking too much Gatorade is weight gain. Each 32-oz. bottle of Gatorade has 200 calories. If an athlete burns fewer calories than that, the excess calories will be stored as fat, which will eventually lead to weight gain.\n\n**Gatorade is fortified with a variety of different vitamins and minerals, including some fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A. Fat-soluble vitamins cannot be excreted from the body when they are consumed in quantities too large, so side effects may occur. Drinking too much Gatorade, and consuming much more than your recommended amount of vitamin A, can lead to vitamin toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis A. The National Institutes of Health say that the symptoms of hypervitaminosis A include blurred vision, fatigue, headache and nausea.**\n\nOne bottle of Gatorade can have up to 800mg of sodium, which is 33 percent of your normal daily recommended intake. Drinking too much Gatorade, especially along with eating salty foods, may result in high blood pressure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that too much salt in the diet can lead to high blood pressure and eventually to health problems like heart attacks and strokes.\n\n**Gatorade contains high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup has been linked to obesity and metabolic conditions.**\n\nDrinking a single 20-oz. sports drink every day for a year could cause an individual to gain about 13 lbs., according to a report from the University of California at Berkley's Robert C. and Veronica Akins Center for Weight and Health.\n\n**Brominated vegetable oil can be found in Gatorade and is made by adding bromine to vegetable oil. It's patented as a flame retardant. But when used in drinks, its purpose is to prevent the oil from separating from the other drink ingredients. Because bromine is a halogen, it may displace iodine in the human body and may impair thyroid function. Case studies prior to 1975, when brominated sedatives were in use, indicated bromine may cause side effects that mimic psychosis and brain damage. These include depression, memory loss, hallucinations, violent tendencies, seizures, cerebral atrophy, acute irritability, tremors, ataxia, confusion, loss of peripheral vision, slurred speech, stupor, tendon reflex changes, photophobia due to enlarged pupils, and extensor plantar responses. Animal studies link bromide consumption to heart and kidney damage and fat deposits in those organs. In extreme cases, it's produced testicular damage, stunted growth, lethargy, and fatigue in animals.**\n\nA study conducted by the University of Iowa found that Gatorade erodes teeth faster than Coke, Diet Coke, Red Bull or 100 percent apple juice.\n\n**There are 56g of sugar in each regular sized bottle of Gatorade. Though replacing some sugars lost during exercise is generally a good idea, drinking too much sugar can lead to high blood sugar in the cells which can be very dangerous. Since every person is different, there is no one amount of sugar which is too much to consume for everybody. Some people, such as diabetics, may get high blood sugar from drinking even half of a bottle of Gatorade, while it may take several bottles to cause high blood sugar in others.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 8 fl oz or 240 ml (There are 4 servings in each bottle)\n\nCalories: 50\nTotal Fat: 0g\nSodium: 110mg/5% daily value\nPotassium: 30 mg/1% daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 14g/5%\nSugars: 14g\nProtein: 0g\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/68710-effects-much-gatorade/)\n\n[Resource 2](http://news.yahoo.com/pepsico-ditches-bvo-gatorade-still-drinking-215800296.html)\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.livestrong.com/article/259258-benefits-of-drinking-gatorade/)\n\n[Resource 4](http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/benefits-drinking-gatorade-16510.html)\n\n[Resource 5](http://www.ehow.com/facts_5483622_pros-cons-gatorade.html)\n\n[Resource 6](http://jahnvijp.wordpress.com/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en7ak/gatorade/", "created_utc": 1368989466.0, "score": 37, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en7ak/gatorade/", "html_title": ""}

Cheddar specifically ripens first with lactic acid bacteria, allowing for conversion of lactose into lactic acid (Which is great if you are lactose intolerant!). The curds that form after are filtered of whey protein and set to a pH of about 6.4. After this, it is salted to about 1-3%, packaged and pressed, and then aged for a period of time[^2]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(09%2970500-4/abstract),[^3]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(08%2971439-5/abstract). \nThe biggest difference between light cheddar and cheddar in general is saturated fat content(As well as some differences in cholesterol and calcium content).

{"title": "Tomatoes", "selftext": "Tomatoes are acidic vegetables, so eating too many of them can aggravate preexisting medical conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, also known as acid reflux -- a condition in which the digestive acids in your stomach rise and leak through the muscle acting as a valve between your stomach and esophagus, burning your esophagus. Tomatoes, especially in great quantities, can make this worse. According to the Mayo Clinic, the seeds in tomatoes can also aggravate diverticulitis, by lodging in the diverticula, small pouches formed in your digestive tract, causing inflammation and infection.\n\n**Numerous studies have concluded that the more tomatoes people eat the lower their risks of certain cancers, especially lung, stomach and prostate cancers.  A substance called lycopene, which is responsible for tomatoes red color, is thought to be the reason for this cancer protective effect. Processed tomatoes contain even more lycopene than raw ones. The process of cooking breaks down the cell walls, helping to release the lycopene. Eating tomatoes with a little bit of fat, such as olive oil, helps lycopene to be better absorbed by the body.**\n\nTomatoes can improve your vision. The vitamin A that tomatoes provide can improve vision and help prevent night blindness. Recent research shows that consuming tomatoes may help reduce the risk of macular degeneration, a serious and irreversible eye condition.\n\n**Tomatoes will make your hair look better.The vitamin A found in tomatoes works to make hair strong and shiny. (Sorry, tomatoes cannot help much with thinning hair\u2014but they will make the hair you have look better!)**\n\nTomatoes can help prevent kidney stones and gallstones. Some studies suggest that kidney and gall stones are less likely to form in people who eat tomatoes without the seeds.\n\n**Tomatoes can reduce chronic pain. If you are one of the millions of people who deal with mild to moderate chronic pain (such as from arthritis or back pain), tomatoes may be a pain-buster. Tomatoes are high in bioflavonoids and carotenoids, which are known anti-inflammatory agents. Chronic pain often involves chronic inflammation, so attacking the inflammation is a good way to fight the chronic pain.**\n\nTomatoes are high in important antioxidants such as vitamin C and Vitamin A. These vitamins work to fend of DNA damage from free radicals. Consequently, tomatoes may help to ward off age related diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes.\n\n**Tomatoes can help you lose weight. If you are on a sensible diet and exercise plan, build lots of tomatoes into your everyday eating. They make a great snack and can be used to \u201cbulk up\u201d salads, casseroles, sandwiches and other meals. Because tomatoes contain lots of water and fiber, they are what Weight Watchers calls a \u201cfilling food,\u201d one of those foods that fills you up fast without adding a lot of calories or fat.**\n\nTomatoes contain important nutrients, such as niacin, folate and vitamin B6, that have associated with the reduction of heart disease risk. One study found that women who ate 7 to 10 servings of tomato products per week had a 29 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than women who consumed less than a serving and a half of tomato products each week. Results were even more impressive when the women ate oil-rich tomato products.\n\n**Tomatoes build strong bones.The vitamin K and calcium in tomatoes are both very good for strengthening and repairing bones.\nLycopene also has been shown to improve bone mass, which is a great way to fight osteoporosis.**\n\nOne study showed that drinking 8 ounces of tomato juice daily reduced platelet aggregation significantly, among study subjects. Those drinking a placebo showed no benefit. It\u2019s important to drink low-sodium tomato juice if you are trying to protect against thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessel) , as high sodium levels can cause negative effects for this type of disease.\n\n**A double blind study found that drinking a glass of tomato juice a day can reduce blood levels of TNF-alpha by 34 percent. TNF-alpha causes inflammation. High levels have been found in individuals with most chronic, degenerative diseases such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis and Alzheimer\u2019s.**\n\nTomatoes are a natural cancer fighter. Lycopene can reduce the risk of several cancers, including prostate, cervical, mouth, pharynx, throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectal, prostate and ovarian cancer. Tomatoes\u2019 antioxidants (vitamins A and C) fight the free radicals which can cause cell damage.\n\n**Tomatoes can keep your blood sugar in balance. Tomatoes are a very good source of chromium, which helps to regulate blood sugar.**\n\nTomatoes make your skin look great. Beta-carotene helps protect skin against sun damage.

{"title": "Lamb", "selftext": "Lamb, being a red meat, has high amount of dietary saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which can result in different forms of chronic diseases, including heart diseases and some forms of cancer.\n\n**Like other meat items, lamb also contains naturally occurring substances like purines that are responsible for the health condition called gout and even the formation of kidney stones.Hence, it is advisable for individuals suffering with kidney problems or gout, to limit or avoid intake of purine-containing foods such as lamb.**\n\nAn average serving of lamb is a good source of high quality protein and supplies the body with 60.3% of the daily requirement for protein.\n\n**The meat contains a high amount of zinc, which is required by every living cell in the body for healthy immune function, cell division and overall growth.**\n\nAn area where we would expect to see health benefits from lamb consumption would involve blood sugar regulation. Lamb has long been a part of menus and recipes endorsed by the American Diabetic Association, where it is viewed as a lean meat that is high in protein and that can be beneficially incorporated into recipes in amounts of 3-4 ounces per serving. Lamb is often unranked on lists of glycemic index (GI) values due to its virtually non-existent carb content. This absence of carbs in lamb might allow the very broad B-vitamin content of lamb to help support metabolism of other carbs provided by other foods that were consumed alongside of the lamb. (Vitamins B1, B2 and B3 are especially important in optimal functioning of enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism.)\n\n**The meat is a good source of selenium, a mineral whose deficiency can lead to asthma attacks.**\n\nLamb is a good source of vitamin B12 and also provides important amounts of the B vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline. Vitamins B6, B12, folate and choline are especially important for healthy metabolism of homocysteine and can help prevent unwanted accumulation of excess homocysteine in the body. High blood levels of homocysteine are a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\n**It is a good source of vitamin B12, necessary to prevent a dangerous molecule called homocysteine from harming the body. It also promotes a healthy nervous system, supports the formation of red blood cells and prevents anemia. Moreover, vitamin B12 is found naturally only in animal foods.**\n\nLamb provides antioxidant minerals that have been shown to help lower risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing unwanted oxidative stress. Lamb provides a very good amount of the mineral selenium and good amount of the mineral zinc.\n\n**Despite the fact that about one-third of the fat in lamb comes from saturated fat, lamb (especially when pasture fed) can be a significant source of omega-3 fat and is also contains a large amount of monounsaturated fat (40% of its total fat). Both omega-3 fat and monounsaturated fat have been associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.**\n\nThe niacin (vitamin B3) present in lamb provides protection against Alzheimer's disease, promotes healthy skin and keeps age-related cognitive decline at bay. Moreover, it retards the risk of developing osteoarthritis by as much as half.\n\n**Lamb is rich in iron, which is an integral component of hemoglobin and aids formation of red blood cells in the body. The form in which iron is present in lamb is easily absorbed by the body.**\n\nThe omega-3 content of lamb depends upon the young sheep's diet as well as the mother's diet, but when those diets are nutritionally supportive, the result can be a cut of lamb with a very impressive amount of omega-3s. In regions of some countries without access to a coastline and fish, lamb has sometimes been shown to provide more omega-3s than any other food in the diet. In Australia, where lamb is eaten frequently by both children and adults, recent studies have shown lamb to rank among the top omega-3 foods in the daily diet. In our own nutritional profile of lamb, we use a conservative average estimate of 40 milligrams of omega-3s per ounce of roasted lamb loin. That's 50% of the omega-3s in an ounce of baked cod fish or broiled tuna, and 67% of the amount in an ounce of sesame seeds.\n\n**Selenium has antioxidant properties which help to boost the body\u2019s immune system. It protects body cells from damage by free radicals. Selenium can be found in lamb and is known to enhance thyroid functions and facilitates the activities of various essential enzymes. Selenium has also been found helpful in fighting viral infections. It promotes liver health and prevents certain cancers.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*:\n\nServing Size: 336g\nCalories:739\nCalories from Fat: 267\nTotal Fat: 30g/46% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 11g/57% of daily value\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 1683mg/561% of daily value\nSodium: 188mg/8% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 9g/3% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 0g\nSugars: 0g\nProtein 103g\nVitamin A: 1676% of daily value\nCalcium: 3% of daily value\nVitamin C: 22% of daily value\nIron: 155% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=117)\n[Resource 2](http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/benefits-of-lamb-6426.html)\n[Resource 3](http://www.diethealthclub.com/health-food/lamb.html)\n[Resource 4](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/the-nutrition-of-lamb.html#b)\n[Resource 5](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/lamb-veal-and-game-products/4669/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eodcn/lamb/", "created_utc": 1369025216.0, "score": 28, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eodcn/lamb/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Brown Rice", "selftext": "Brown rice is a good source of magnesium, a mineral that is essential to bone health. Just one cup of brown rice contains 21 percent of the recommended daily value of magnesium. Most of the magnesium in the body is stored on or in the bones, so to keep a high level of magnesium in your bones, and to reap the other health benefits, eat plenty of brown rice each week.\n\n**Brown rice has a rich content of manganese, which helps in the production of energy from carbohydrates and protein. The nutrient also plays a key role in the synthesis of fatty acids, which is necessary for a healthy nervous system. One can get about 88% of the daily needs for manganese by consuming juts one cup of brown rice. The manganese present in brown rice is also required for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase, which protects the mitochondria against the free radicals formed during energy production.**\n\nBrown rice is a rich source of fiber and selenium, both of which help lower the risk of colon cancer significantly. Selenium also works with vitamin E, in several antioxidant systems of the body, which help fight against heart diseases. This is also beneficial against the symptoms of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**The rice also contains insoluble fiber, which helps women avoid developing gallstones.**\n\nThe oil present in brown rice helps in lowering the cholesterol level in the body.\n\n**Brown rice works extremely good for postmenopausal women with complains of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other symptoms of cardiovascular diseases.**\n\nBrown rice is abundant in plant lignans, which get converted into mammalian lignans like enterolactone, in the intestine. Enterolactone is highly protective against breast and other hormone-dependent cancers and also heart diseases.\n\n**The rice helps in reducing the risk of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is associated with symptoms like visceral obesity, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and low level of defensive HDL cholesterol.**\n\nBrown rice reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Brown rice is a good source of magnesium, which reduces the severity of asthma, lowers the frequency of migraine headaches and decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Magnesium balances the action of calcium and thus, helps in regulating nerve and muscle tone.**\n\nBrown rice offers major protection against breast cancer, especially in pre-menopausal women.\n\n**Intake of brown rice can help the body fight against the childhood asthma. It is also protective against obesity, ischemic stroke and insulin resistance.**\n\nOne cup of brown rice will provide you with 88.0% of the daily value for manganese. This trace mineral helps produce energy from protein and carbohydrates and is involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, which are important for a healthy nervous system, and in the production of cholesterol, which is used by the body to produce sex hormones. Manganese is also a critical component of a very important antioxidant enzyme called superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is found inside the body's mitochondria (the oxygen-based energy factories inside most of our cells) where it provides protection against damage from the free radicals produced during energy production.\n\n**Brown Rice is rich in fiber, which contributes towards the reduction of cholesterol level and also the prevention of atherosclerosis. The fiber also binds to the cancer-causing chemicals, protecting the body against colon cancer. The fiber present in brown rice also helps normalize the bowel function and thus, reduces constipation.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size = 195g\nCalories: 216\nCalories from Fat: 15\nTotal Fat: 2g/3% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 10mg/0% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 45g/15% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 4g/14% of daily value\nSugars: 1g\nProtein: 5g\nCalcium: 2%\nIron: 5%\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/benefits-of-brown-rice-6211.html)\n[Resource 2](http://nutritiousfoods.blogspot.kr/2009/10/health-benefits-of-brown-rice.html?m=1)\n[Resource 3](http://www.symptomfind.com/nutrition-supplements/brown-rice-health-benefits/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=128)\n[Resource 5](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5707/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epd7d/brown_rice/", "created_utc": 1369070160.0, "score": 24, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epd7d/brown_rice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Ramen Noodles", "selftext": "Once you have consumed instant noodles, it will take 4 to 5 days to excrete the wax, which is coated on the noodles, from the body. But we can get rid off the wax if the noodles are cooked in the right way.\n\n**A major mark against ramen noodles is the sodium, notes Women Fitness, which put the noodles on its \"Top 10 Foods Worst to Consume\" list. The noodles' flavor packets contain anywhere from the beef's 861 mg of sodium to 3,000 mg in some other flavors. The recommended daily dose of sodium, as per the Dietary Reference Intake, should be no more than 1,440 mg. Another mark against the noodles is they are basically rolled dough that is deep-fried and lack any significant nutritional value.**\n\nThe packet inside of the Ramen noodle package contains large amounts of sodium. The flavor packet also contains monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives MSG the nod as an ingredient that is \"generally recognized as safe.\" Different research groups and individuals have sent the FDA reports of some MSG side effects. According to \"Contemporary Nutrition,\" the food additive industry readily admits that MSG has addictive properties and can cause people to gain weight, but they justify its use by claiming that this can be beneficial to elderly persons who are sometimes malnourished. Glutamate, the main component of MSG, is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and it has been linked to neurological symptoms when taken in excess.\n\n\n**On any diet, you must make sure to get enough protein. Ramen noodles can deliver in this area, with an average of 10 grams of protein per serving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests adult women get at least 46 protein grams per day, while adult men need at least 56 grams daily. Ramen noodles provide you with healthy protein. One package will give you up to one-fourth of the daily intake you need.

{"title": "Spinach", "selftext": "The flavonoids and antioxidants found in spinach, particularly the antioxidant beta-carotene, have been shown in multiple studies to help combat many cancers, including breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. \n\n**A recent study found a bowl of spinach every day increases muscle efficiency. Researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found participants who consumed 300 grams of spinach a day reduced the amount of oxygen required to power their muscles while exercising by five per cent. The effect was noticable after just three days of spinach consumption.**\n\nSpinach may reduce the risk of skin cancer, according to researchers from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. Researchers found green leafy vegetables such as spinach and silverbeet are linked with a  reduction in the risk of skin cancer, particularly among those with a previous history of the disease.\n\n**Spinach is high in oxalic acid, which can bind with iron and calcium and cause your body to absorb less of these nutrients. Consuming foods rich in vitamin C, such as tomatoes, capsicum, lemon juice or orange juice along with spinach can aid this absorption. Spinach is high in fibre, but too much of it can cause digestive problems such as bloating, gas and cramping.**\n\nSpinach is also associated with an increased risk of kidney stones, but only in people who are predisposed to the condition.\n\n**Spinach leaves hold a good amount of soluble dietary fiber and green spinach is one of the finest vegetable sources recommended in cholesterol controlling and weight reduction programs.**\n\nFresh 100 g of spinach contains about 25% of daily intake of iron; one of the richest among green leafy vegetables. Iron is an important trace element required by the human body for red blood cell production and as a co-factor for oxidation-reduction enzyme, cytochrome-oxidase during the cellular metabolism.\n\n**Fresh leaves are rich source of several vital anti-oxidant vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin C, and flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zea-xanthin and beta-carotene. Together, these compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a healing role in aging and various disease processes.**\n\nSpinach contains a considerable amount of vitamin A. vitamin A is essential for maintaining normal eye-sight.\n\n**Spinach leaves are an excellent source of vitamin K. 100 g of fresh greens provides 402% of daily vitamin-K requirements. Vitamin K plays a vital role in strengthening the bone mass by promoting osteotrophic (bone building) activity in the bone.**\n\nThis green leafy vegetable also contains good amounts of many B-complex vitamins such as vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin, folates and niacin. Folates help prevent neural tube defects in the offspring.\n\n**Spinach leaves also contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, magnesium, copper and zinc. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Manganese and copper are used by the body as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper is required in the production of red blood cells. Zinc is a co-factor for many enzymes that regulate growth and development, sperm generation, digestion and nucleic acid synthesis.**\n\nRegular consumption of spinach in the diet helps prevent osteoporosis (weakness of bones), iron-deficiency anemia. Moreover, its soft leaves are believed to protect human body from cardiovascular diseases and cancers of colon and prostate.\n\n**A common, but harmless, side effect of eating spinach is feeling as though your teeth are gritty or slimy. This is caused by the oxalic acid found in spinach. Oxalic acid contains small crystals that do not dissolve in water. The grit is harmless and can be removed easily by brushing your teeth.**\n\nSpinach is high in dietary fiber; a cup of cooked spinach contains 6 g of fiber. Although your body needs fiber to promote proper digestion, eating too much fiber at once can contribute to stomach upset. You may experience gas, bloating and cramping after eating spinach. Eat a large amount of spinach all at once, and you may experience some diarrhea. If you have recently increased the fiber in your diet, your body will eventually adjust and you will experience less stomach pain as you continue to eat high-fiber foods. Try drinking a full glass of water every time you eat spinach to help your body better process the fiber.\n\n**Avoid eating large amounts of spinach on a daily basis (or juicing). Spinach has been shown to have the ability to drastically change your thyroid. If you already have thyroid problems, hypothyroidism in particular, you should talk with your doctor on how much spinach and other cruciferous vegetables you should be eating.**\n\n\n***[Nutritional Facts](http://imgur.com/bSvVbgK)***\n\nLinks: [Resource 1](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=43)\n\n\n[Resource 2](http://urbanext.illinois.edu/veggies/spinach.cfm)\n\n\n[Resource 3](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3214)\n\n\n[Resource 4](http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/spinach.html)\n\n\n[Resource 5](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinach)\n\n\n[Resource 6](http://home.howstuffworks.com/spinach3.htm)\n\n\n[Resource 7](http://www.livestrong.com/article/411787-side-effects-of-spinach/)\n\n\n[Resource 8](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/hypothyroidism)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gpdhr/spinach/", "created_utc": 1410992954.0, "score": 23, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gpdhr/spinach/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Green Peas", "selftext": "Peas contain phytosterols especially \u00df-sitosterol. Studies suggest that vegetables like legumes, fruits and cereals rich in plant sterols help lower cholesterol levels in the body.\n\n**Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are risk factors not only for the development of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, but also for the development of cancers. A recent research study has begun to examine the benefits of green peas with respect to one particular type of cancer\u2014stomach cancer. Stomach cancer (also called gastric cancer) is a disease that occurs more commonly in persons who have very low intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients, including key nutrients called polyphenols. A recent study based in Mexico City has shown that daily consumption of green peas along with other legumes is associated with decreased risk of stomach cancer. In particular, decreased risk of stomach cancer in this study was associated with average daily intake of a polyphenol called coumestrol at a level of 2 milligrams or higher. Pulses (including green peas) were determined to be a key food contributor to coumestrol in this Mexico-based study. Since one cup of green peas contains at least 10 milligrams of coumestrol, green peas are very likely to provide some unique health benefits in this cancer-prevention area. Of course, coumestrol is not the only cancer-protective nutrient present in green peas! The wide variety of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients in green peas is very likely to play a primary role in the cancer-preventive benefits of this food.**\n\nGarden peas are also good in vitamin K. 100 g of fresh leaves contains about 21% of daily requirement of vitamin K-1 (phylloquinone). Vitamin K has found to have a potential role in bone mass building function by promoting osteo-trophic activity in the bone. It also has established role in Alzheimer's disease patients by limiting neuronal damage in the brain.\n\n**Green peas help regulate blood sugar levels.**\n\nThe many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds within peas support healthy blood vessels. The formation of plaque along our blood vessel walls starts with chronic, excessive oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\n**The generous amounts of vitamin B1 and folate, B2, B3, and B6  in green peas help to reduce homocysteine levels  which are  risk factor for heart disease.**\n\nGreen peas are loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients, and these health-supportive nutrients are provided in a wide range of nutrient categories. For example, in the flavonoid category, green peas provide us with the antioxidants catechin and epicatechin. In the carotenoid category, they offer alpha-carotene and beta-carotene. Their phenolic acids include ferulic and caffeic acid. Their polyphenols include coumestrol. Pisumsaponins I and II and pisomosides A and B are anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found almost exclusively in peas. Antioxidant vitamins provided by green peas include vitamin C and vitamin E, and a good amount of the antioxidant mineral zinc is also found in this amazing food. Yet another key anti-inflammatory nutrient needs to be added to this list, and that nutrient is omega-3 fat. Recent research has shown that green peas are a reliable source of omega-3 fat in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In one cup of green peas, you can expect to find about 30 milligrams of ALA. Although large-scale studies on green pea intake and these chronic health problems remain unavailable, researchers have already begun to suggest connections in this area, particularly with respect to type 2 diabetes. We know that chronic, unwanted inflammation and chronic, unwanted oxidative stress increase our risk of type 2 diabetes. We also know that intake of green peas is associated with lowered risk of type 2 diabetes, even though this association has traditionally been understood to involve the strong fiber and protein content of green peas. Researchers now believe that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients in greens peas play an equally important role in lowering our risk of this chronic health problem.\n\n**Fresh green peas also contain adequate amounts of anti-oxidants flavonoids such as carotenes, lutein and zea-xanthin as well as vitamin-A (provide 765 IU or 25.5% of RDA per 100 g). Vitamin A is an essential nutrient required for maintaining health of mucus membranes, skin and eye-sight. Further, consumption of natural fruits rich in flavonoids helps to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.**\n\nIn addition to folates, peas are also good in many other essential B-complex vitamins such as pantothenic acid, niacin, thiamin, and pyridoxine. Furthermore, they are rich source of many minerals such as calcium, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese.\n\n**Peas are relatively low in calories on comparison with beans, and cowpeas. 100 g of green peas provide only 81 calories, and no cholesterol. Nonetheless, the legumes are a good source of proteins, and soluble as well as insoluble fiber.**\n\nFresh pea pods are excellent source of folic acid. 100 g provides 65 \u00b5g or 16% of recommended daily levels of folates. Folates are B-complex vitamins required for DNA synthesis inside the cell. Well established research studies suggest that adequate folate rich foods in expectant mothers would help prevent neural tube defects in the newborn babies.\n\n**Fresh green peas are very good in ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Vitamin C is a powerful natural water-soluble anti-oxidant. Vegetables rich in this vitamin helps body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the body.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (145g)\nCalories: 117\nCalories from Fat: 5\nTotal Fat: 1g 1% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 0g\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 7mg 0% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 21g 7% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 7g 30% of daily value\nSugars: 8g\nProtein: 8g\nVitamin A: 22% of daily value\nCalcium: 4% of daily value\nVitamin C: 97% of daily value\nIron: 12% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=55)\n[Resource 2](http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/green-peas.html)\n[Resource 3](http://realfoodforlife.com/10-health-benefits-of-peas/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033)\n[Resource 5](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/HQ01212)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2520/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f6to5/green_peas/", "created_utc": 1369729785.0, "score": 19, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f6to5/green_peas/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Kimchi", "selftext": "Some doctors have shown that with increased consumption there is evidence that kimchi might also increase the risk of stomach cancer. Scientists have identified some potential carcinogens in the food, but not at extremely high levels. This has led some doctors to suggest that kimchi is fine when eaten in moderation, along with a regular diet of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n**Regular consumption of kimchi has a beneficial effect on the levels of cholesterol. Garlic which is used to prepare kimchi is rich in selenium and allicin. Allicin is an eminent component which helps in lowering the cholesterol levels thereby, reducing the risk of developing cardiac disorders such as strokes and heart attacks. Selenium also exerts a protective effect on the artery walls by preventing the build-up of plaque and decreasing the threat of disorders like atherosclerosis. An investigative study has advocated that fermented kimchi helps in lowering the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol along with the concentrations blood glucose in the body.**\n\nAccording to medical reports, kimchi is an excellent food to promote healthy digestion. It is a source of probiotics attributing to the process of fermentation involved in its preparation. The process of fermentation of kimchi not only enhances the taste but also creates healthy bacteria, Lactobacillus which is required by the body to keep a healthy state of intestinal flora. Kimchi  is made from cabbage which is already well known for its detoxification qualities and helps the body in getting rid of the wastes and toxins. It aids in cleaning up the intestines and stimulates better assimilation of nutrients in the body. Fiber content present in kimchi also assists in stabilizing the bowel movements and prevents constipation.\n\n**Kimchi is a valuable food which helps in reducing the risk of development of various cancers. A study performed on kimchi samples has validated its anti-cancer properties. Cabbage present in kimchi contains healthful flavonoids which are known to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Another powerful cancer fighters present in cruciferous such as cabbage are glucosinolates. Glucosinolates break down to form isothiocyanates which are well known for their effectiveness against the cancer growth.**\n\nThe presence of lactobacillus bacteria in kimchi makes it a multi-talented condiment. It extends its therapeutic effects on various skin ailments such as atopic dermatitis which is characterized by increased levels of immunoglobulin E and skin lesion such as edema and hemorrhage. A study conducted in this regard has shown that healthy bacteria present in fermented kimchi exerts suppressive effects on the mite-induced dermatitis and helps in reducing the inflammation.\n\n**As already stated, kimchi is a source of healthy lactobacillus bacteria which the body utilizes for its healthy functioning. This good bacterium also assists in weight loss by controlling the appetite and reducing the blood sugar levels. The fiber content present in kimchi keeps your body full and hunger satisfied for a longer duration preventing you from frequent and over eating. A study conducted on obese patients has validated the favorable effects of fermented kimchi on the body with respect to body mass index, body fat which helps in reducing the development of factors implicated in metabolic syndrome.**\n\nThe multi-nutrient packed kimchi is rich in a range of flavonoids and phenolic components. The variety of ingredients including ginger, garlic, peppers involved in the preparations of kimchi are super protectors which are renowned for their beneficial effect on the immune system. They help in fighting infections and are valuable in curing cold and flu symptoms.\n\n**Another valuable benefit provided by kimchi is its anti-aging qualities which attributes to the presence of antioxidants and vitamin C. A study evaluating the anti-aging activity of kimchi has revealed that kimchi helps in regulating and attenuating the inflammation that speeds up the aging process. The same study has also shown promising results with regard to factors like reduced oxidative stress in the cells, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and extended life span in the subjects making kimchi a potent anti-aging component.**\n\nKimchi is beneficial in diabetes. A study conducted on high-fat diet-fed type-2 diabetic subjects who were given kimchi revealed the anti-diabetic properties of the Korean delicacy. The study showed better glucose tolerance and lower levels of fasting glucose after eating kimchi-containing diet in the diabetic subjects.  The same study also suggested that kimchi can prove more useful in diabetes if it is eaten with normal or low-fat diet instead of high-fat food. \n\n**Individuals suffering from high blood pressure should be cautious while eating kimchi because of the presence of high salt concentration which gets further accentuated during the fermentation process. However, a study conducted on hypertensive subjects revealed that even under the conditions of hypertension, eating low-sodium kimchi may not exert harmful effects on the blood pressure and cardiac activities.**   \n\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 282g\nCalories: 96\nCalories from Fat: 10\nTotal Fat: 1g (2% of daily value)\nSaturated Fat: 0.g (0% of daily value)\nCholesterol 0mg: (0% of daily value)\nSodium: 2206mg (92% of daily value)\t \nTotal Carbohydrate: 20g (7% of daily value)\nDietary Fiber 2g: (10% of daily value)\nSugars: 1g\t \nProtein: 3g\n\n\nVitamin A: 45% of daily value\nVitamin C: 21% of daily value\nCalcium: 6% of daily value\nIron: 1% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.kscpp.net/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Tpm6kbNBiWE%3D&tabid=140&mid=498)\n\n[Resource 2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456350)\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09333.html)\n\n[Resource 4](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09354.html)\n\nResource 5](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/vitamin-a-retinol)\n\n[Resource 6](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002404.htm)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2a59ei/kimchi/", "created_utc": 1404830032.0, "score": 17, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2a59ei/kimchi/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Honey", "selftext": "* **Honey as an anti-bacterial**:  Perhaps the most common of the things attributed to honey is its anti-bacterial/fungal properties.  This is mainly due to honey being very acidic (average ph of 4.75) and its high Osmolarity (High sugar content).  Most cells need a very balanced ph to survive and also need water to as well.  Honey has such a high Osmolarity that it literally sucks the water out of the bacterial cell and causes it to shrivel up and die. In lab experiments, it has been shown that honey can be effective against MRSA, although this hasnt been repeated in human trials, as well as also being effective again H. Pylori (a major cause of Stomach Ulcers).  It is also due to these two features that allows honey to remain shelf-stable for an extremely long time (if stored right, for 1000's of years.\"\n\n* **Honey to reduce allergies**:  Honey may help some people with allergies, but as a general allergy prevention method, it fails for a couple reasons.  Most allergies are caused by windborne allergens, which bees do not carry.  The other side is that even if it were to work, the acids of your stomach would break down the honey, rendering any benefits null.  There are some studies however that show that honey may relieve a runny nose, which segues to....\n\n* **Honey vs. the common cold**: Honey has been shown in studies to beat out Dextromethorphan in easing night-time coughing in children.  This has not been replicated in adults however, but the results are expected to be similar.\n\n* **Honey and Diabetes**:  Although some people may play into honey being more natural and healthier than regular sugar, in truth its still a sugar and to diabetes, a sugar is a sugar...... Honey is still sugar in the end, which a lot of people somewhat seem to gloss over.  Consuming too much honey, just like just about any other food can be bad for you.  However, there is a darker side to honey\n\n* ** The dark side to honey**: Infant Botulism. While giving an infant honey would be a great thing, it may contain Clostridium Botulinum which causes Botulism (2070ng or 2.07mcg is the average LD50 if inhaled by the average adult male, so we're talking orders of magnitude less if consumed by an infant).  Any health benefits given from honey can be replicated throught breast feeding and as such, * **DO NOT GIVE INFANTS HONEY**\n\nIf any clarification is needed, feel free to post or respond.

{"title": "Potatoes", "selftext": "Fresh potato along with its skin is one of a good source of antioxidant vitamin; vitamin-C. 100 g of fresh tuber provides 11.4 mg or 20% of daily required levels of this vitamin. Regular consumption of foods rich in vitamin-C helps body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals.\n\n**They are very good natural sources of both soluble and insoluble fiber. The dietary fiber in them increases the bulk of the stool, thus, it helps prevent constipation, decrease absorption of dietary cholesterol and thereby, lower plasma LDL cholesterol. Additionally, its rich fiber content also helps protect from colon polyps and cancer.**\n\nIf you eat all of the flesh -- but none of the skin -- of an average-sized baked potato, you\u2019ll get about 145 calories, 3 grams of protein, 34 grams of mostly complex carbohydrates and significant amounts of potassium, vitamin C, vitamin B-6, niacin and thiamine. For about another 15 calories, eating the skin provides you with an extra gram of protein, another 3 grams of carbohydrates and more of most of the vitamins and minerals found in the vegetable\u2019s flesh. Potato skins are particularly rich in iron and potassium -- according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Nutrient Database, an average-sized whole baked potato is approximately 70 percent higher in iron and 35 percent higher in potassium than a peeled one.\n\n**A baked potato served without skin falls short of qualifying as a good source of dietary fiber, with just over 2 grams per average-sized specimen. The root vegetable\u2019s skin is a much better source of these beneficial, indigestible carbohydrates -- an ounce of potato skin delivers more than five times as much fiber as an ounce of potato flesh, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database. You\u2019ll get close to 4 grams of fiber from a whole, average-sized baked potato, or right around 15 percent of the recommended daily value. Whole potatoes are especially rich in insoluble fiber, the kind that stimulates digestion and promotes bowel regularity.**\n\nPotatoes can contain Acrylamide. Acrylamide has been shown to cause cancer in lab animals, but we don't know what levels of acrylamide exposures are dangerous for humans. Frying and baking potatoes at high temperatures for a long time result in the highest levels of acrylamide, but those levels may be reduced when potatoes are boiled first or treated with antioxidant solutions.\n\n**Potatoes are considered a starchy vegetable because they\u2019re rich in complex carbohydrates. Compared to those found in whole grains, beans and other vegetables, the complex carbohydrates in peeled potatoes are more readily broken down into simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream, which is why they tend to cause blood glucose levels to rise more rapidly than other starchy foods. The extra fiber obtained by eating the vegetable\u2019s skin -- a fair amount of which is soluble -- helps mitigate this effect. Soluble fiber keeps digested food in your stomach longer and slows the rate at which simple sugars enter your bloodstream.**\n\nPoatoes that have green skin can contain Solanine. Research shows that solanine may adversely affect the cells that make up the lining of the intestines and can irritate inflammatory bowel disorders. To avoid solanine, don't buy potatoes that have green skin and store them in a dark place in your pantry or kitchen.\n\n\n**Potato skins contain an anti-carcinogenic compound called chlorogenic acid. This particular acid helps the fiber in potatoes absorb carcinogens that are found in grilled foods. Eating potatoes with grilled foods is common and important when preserving health and fighting off cancer-causing substances.**\n\n\nPotatoes can help lower blood pressure.\n\n**If potatoes are cooked by healthy cooking methods then they are good for your heart.

And while it warrants more testing, Sugar Therapy for injuries has been shown to promote healing (Sugar is hydroscopic and if we remember from Honey, that means that it will pull water out of substances, which in this case means bacteria.)\n\n\nBut onto the oft-reported negatives of sugar.  The largest issue with sugar (remember that im talking in regards to pure sugar/candies like Jolly Ranchers), is the lack of other nutrients.  Yes, eating  a chocolate bar isnt healthy, but at least you're gaining the benefits that chocolates bring.  Sugar has no; nutrients, protein, healthy fats, enzymes.  It gets absorbed by the body so fast that it doesn't satiate nearly as much as Fats or proteins do, since they take longer to be digested.  Combine this with the positive \"high\" that sugar gives (Sugar has been shown to raise mood.) and we reach a feedback loop of sugar consumption equating to happiness, which in turn causes the body to crave more.   To quote a source (which will be listed below, and lists PR studies as sources).  Sugar is also loved by acid-producing mouth bacteria, which cause damage to your teeth.\n\n>Stresses the Liver: \u201cWhen we eat fructose, it goes to the liver. If liver glycogen is low, such as after a run, the fructose will be used to replenish it (3).However, most people aren\u2019t consuming fructose after a long workout and their livers are already full of glycogen. When this happens, the liver turns the fructose into fat (2). Some of the fat gets shipped out, but part of it remains in the liver. The fat can build up over time and ultimately lead to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (4, 5, 6).\u201d\n\n>Increases Bad Cholesterol and Triglycerides (source)\n\n>Can contribute to Leptin Resistance (and then weight gain, cravings, sleep trouble, etc) \u2013 source\n\n>Creates an addictive sugar response in the brain (source)\n\n>Doesn\u2019t fill you up and instead encourages you to eat more\n\nOverall, mass consumption of sugar is a massively detremental thing for your everyday person, on the level of cigarette smoking.\n\nI'll end with a fact:  One chemical is  C^12 H^22 O^11. , and another is C^17 H^21 NO^4 .

In short, the study suggested that milk may help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as help lower blood pressure.\n\n**Whole milk has a great combination of sugar, carbs and protein and contributes to post-exercise muscle synthesis and re-hydration, as well as aiding in post-exercise soreness.**\n\nA 2017 review of 13 clinical trials on dairy consumption in the journal Clinical Nutrition found that having 500mL per day of dairy was associated with decreased appetite and desire to eat, while increasing satiety.\n\n**Milk helps exercise buffs burn more fat.

In short, the study suggested that milk may help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as help lower blood pressure.\n\n**Whole milk has a great combination of sugar, carbs and protein and contributes to post-exercise muscle synthesis and re-hydration, as well as aiding in post-exercise soreness.**\n\nA 2017 review of 13 clinical trials on dairy consumption in the journal Clinical Nutrition found that having 500mL per day of dairy was associated with decreased appetite and desire to eat, while increasing satiety.\n\n**Milk helps exercise buffs burn more fat. In a recent study, the milk drinking group came out on top in terms of muscle gain with an estimated 40 per cent or 2.5 pounds more muscle mass than the soy beverage drinkers. In addition, this group gained 63 per cent or 3.3 pounds, more muscle mass than the carbohydrate beverage drinkers.**\n\nPeople who eat a lot of high-fat dairy products actually have the lowest incidence of diabetes, according to a 2015 study of 26,930 people in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Those who ate a lot of low-fat dairy products, on the other hand, had the highest incidence. The researchers speculated that while calcium, protein, vitamin D and other nutrients in yogurt are indeed good for us, we need the fat that goes along with them in order to get their protective effects.\n\n**Whole milk can improve blood pressure and diminish the effects of coronary artery disease.**\n\nMilk is an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and fatty acids, and it helps slow down the absorption of sugar and carbohydrates, leading to consistent energy levels and improved brain function.\n\n**Milk has been linked to causing acne.\u00a0The proteins in milk \u2014 whey and casein \u2014 stimulate growth and hormones. They also release something called IGF-1, a hormone that mimics insulin, and is a catalyst for dreaded breakouts. It's also believed that if you are lactose intolerant, and find your face popping with pimples, it could actually be an allergic reaction.**\n\nMilk has been shown to help lower cholesterol.\n\n**Milk has been proved to relax the body and reduce the negative effects that women experience during their menstrual cycle.**\n\nThere are many foods that contain acids that cause people to experience heartburn. One of the simplest \u2013 and yummiest \u2013 ways to alleviate this pain is drinking a glass of milk. The cooling sensation and the thick consistency of milk helps to coat the esophagus and stomach lining to prevent heartburn.\n\n**Drinking milk can improve eyesight.**\n\nMilk has been shown to be a disease fighter, helping reduce the risk of developing certain forms of cancer.\n\n**Drinking too much milk may still have its negative effects. While the jury is still out in some aspects on the nutritional value of milk, other alternatives such as yogurt and cheese have very low lactose content, which is associated with even better health benefits than some of those that milk can provide.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nutritional Facts](https://imgur.com/a/4g5uslq)\n\nLinks:\n\n[Resource 1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23320900/)\n\n[Resource 2](https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&source=ulg&format=PDF&document_id=1053247551&serialid=MFT6JQWS%2B4FvvuMDBUQ7v9g4cGa84/gpv8mURvaRWdQ%3D)\n\n[Resource 3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24695891/)\n\n[Resource 4](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/what-milk-can-do)\n\n[Resource 5](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2018/08/14/busting-myths-about-milk/)\n\n[Resource 6](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070808104257.htm)\n\n[Resource 7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30379113/)\n\n[Resource 8](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/108/3/476/5052139?guestAccessKey=c18b1acf-2778-42b9-8d72-878c0e86cdbf)\n\n[Resource 9](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/5/1065/4577562)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/lu9uun/whole_milk/", "created_utc": 1614496612.0, "score": 6, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/lu9uun/whole_milk/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Spinach", "selftext": "The flavonoids and antioxidants found in spinach, particularly the antioxidant beta-carotene, have been shown in multiple studies to help combat many cancers, including breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. \n\n**A recent study found a bowl of spinach every day increases muscle efficiency. Researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found participants who consumed 300 grams of spinach a day reduced the amount of oxygen required to power their muscles while exercising by five per cent. The effect was noticable after just three days of spinach consumption.**\n\nSpinach may reduce the risk of skin cancer, according to researchers from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. Researchers found green leafy vegetables such as spinach and silverbeet are linked with a  reduction in the risk of skin cancer, particularly among those with a previous history of the disease.\n\n**Spinach is high in oxalic acid, which can bind with iron and calcium and cause your body to absorb less of these nutrients. Consuming foods rich in vitamin C, such as tomatoes, capsicum, lemon juice or orange juice along with spinach can aid this absorption. Spinach is high in fibre, but too much of it can cause digestive problems such as bloating, gas and cramping.**\n\nSpinach is also associated with an increased risk of kidney stones, but only in people who are predisposed to the condition.\n\n**Spinach leaves hold a good amount of soluble dietary fiber and green spinach is one of the finest vegetable sources recommended in cholesterol controlling and weight reduction programs.**\n\nFresh 100 g of spinach contains about 25% of daily intake of iron; one of the richest among green leafy vegetables. Iron is an important trace element required by the human body for red blood cell production and as a co-factor for oxidation-reduction enzyme, cytochrome-oxidase during the cellular metabolism.\n\n**Fresh leaves are rich source of several vital anti-oxidant vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin C, and flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zea-xanthin and beta-carotene. Together, these compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a healing role in aging and various disease processes.**\n\nSpinach contains a considerable amount of vitamin A. vitamin A is essential for maintaining normal eye-sight.\n\n**Spinach leaves are an excellent source of vitamin K. 100 g of fresh greens provides 402% of daily vitamin-K requirements. Vitamin K plays a vital role in strengthening the bone mass by promoting osteotrophic (bone building) activity in the bone.**\n\nThis green leafy vegetable also contains good amounts of many B-complex vitamins such as vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin, folates and niacin. Folates help prevent neural tube defects in the offspring.\n\n**Spinach leaves also contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, magnesium, copper and zinc. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Manganese and copper are used by the body as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper is required in the production of red blood cells. Zinc is a co-factor for many enzymes that regulate growth and development, sperm generation, digestion and nucleic acid synthesis.**\n\nRegular consumption of spinach in the diet helps prevent osteoporosis (weakness of bones), iron-deficiency anemia. Moreover, its soft leaves are believed to protect human body from cardiovascular diseases and cancers of colon and prostate.\n\n**A common, but harmless, side effect of eating spinach is feeling as though your teeth are gritty or slimy. This is caused by the oxalic acid found in spinach. Oxalic acid contains small crystals that do not dissolve in water. The grit is harmless and can be removed easily by brushing your teeth.**\n\nSpinach is high in dietary fiber; a cup of cooked spinach contains 6 g of fiber. Although your body needs fiber to promote proper digestion, eating too much fiber at once can contribute to stomach upset. You may experience gas, bloating and cramping after eating spinach. Eat a large amount of spinach all at once, and you may experience some diarrhea. If you have recently increased the fiber in your diet, your body will eventually adjust and you will experience less stomach pain as you continue to eat high-fiber foods. Try drinking a full glass of water every time you eat spinach to help your body better process the fiber.\n\n**Avoid eating large amounts of spinach on a daily basis (or juicing). Spinach has been shown to have the ability to drastically change your thyroid. If you already have thyroid problems, hypothyroidism in particular, you should talk with your doctor on how much spinach and other cruciferous vegetables you should be eating.**\n\n\n***[Nutritional Facts](http://imgur.com/bSvVbgK)***\n\nLinks: [Resource 1](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=43)\n\n\n[Resource 2](http://urbanext.illinois.edu/veggies/spinach.cfm)\n\n\n[Resource 3](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3214)\n\n\n[Resource 4](http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/spinach.html)\n\n\n[Resource 5](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinach)\n\n\n[Resource 6](http://home.howstuffworks.com/spinach3.htm)\n\n\n[Resource 7](http://www.livestrong.com/article/411787-side-effects-of-spinach/)\n\n\n[Resource 8](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/hypothyroidism)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gpdhr/spinach/", "created_utc": 1410992954.0, "score": 21, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gpdhr/spinach/", "html_title": ""}

For about another 15 calories, eating the skin provides you with an extra gram of protein, another 3 grams of carbohydrates and more of most of the vitamins and minerals found in the vegetable\u2019s flesh. Potato skins are particularly rich in iron and potassium -- according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Nutrient Database, an average-sized whole baked potato is approximately 70 percent higher in iron and 35 percent higher in potassium than a peeled one.\n\n**A baked potato served without skin falls short of qualifying as a good source of dietary fiber, with just over 2 grams per average-sized specimen. The root vegetable\u2019s skin is a much better source of these beneficial, indigestible carbohydrates -- an ounce of potato skin delivers more than five times as much fiber as an ounce of potato flesh, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database. You\u2019ll get close to 4 grams of fiber from a whole, average-sized baked potato, or right around 15 percent of the recommended daily value. Whole potatoes are especially rich in insoluble fiber, the kind that stimulates digestion and promotes bowel regularity.**\n\nPotatoes can contain Acrylamide. Acrylamide has been shown to cause cancer in lab animals, but we don't know what levels of acrylamide exposures are dangerous for humans. Frying and baking potatoes at high temperatures for a long time result in the highest levels of acrylamide, but those levels may be reduced when potatoes are boiled first or treated with antioxidant solutions.\n\n**Potatoes are considered a starchy vegetable because they\u2019re rich in complex carbohydrates. Compared to those found in whole grains, beans and other vegetables, the complex carbohydrates in peeled potatoes are more readily broken down into simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream, which is why they tend to cause blood glucose levels to rise more rapidly than other starchy foods. The extra fiber obtained by eating the vegetable\u2019s skin -- a fair amount of which is soluble -- helps mitigate this effect. Soluble fiber keeps digested food in your stomach longer and slows the rate at which simple sugars enter your bloodstream.**\n\nPoatoes that have green skin can contain Solanine. Research shows that solanine may adversely affect the cells that make up the lining of the intestines and can irritate inflammatory bowel disorders. To avoid solanine, don't buy potatoes that have green skin and store them in a dark place in your pantry or kitchen.\n\n\n**Potato skins contain an anti-carcinogenic compound called chlorogenic acid. This particular acid helps the fiber in potatoes absorb carcinogens that are found in grilled foods. Eating potatoes with grilled foods is common and important when preserving health and fighting off cancer-causing substances.**\n\n\nPotatoes can help lower blood pressure.\n\n**If potatoes are cooked by healthy cooking methods then they are good for your heart. Vitamin B6 in potatoes help to lower homocysteine levels and help lower risk of heart disease or heart attack.**\n\n\n***[Nutritional Facts](http://imgur.com/ChnBL95)***\n\nLinks: [Resource 1](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/acrylamide-in-food)\n\n\n[Resource 2](http://www.potatogoodness.com/nutrition/)\n\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/potato.aspx)\n\n\n[Resource 4](http://nationalpotatocouncil.org/)\n\n\n[Resource 5](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3137)\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gnk1e/potatoes/", "created_utc": 1410957098.0, "score": 14, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gnk1e/potatoes/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Kimchi", "selftext": "Some doctors have shown that with increased consumption there is evidence that kimchi might also increase the risk of stomach cancer. Scientists have identified some potential carcinogens in the food, but not at extremely high levels. This has led some doctors to suggest that kimchi is fine when eaten in moderation, along with a regular diet of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n**Regular consumption of kimchi has a beneficial effect on the levels of cholesterol. Garlic which is used to prepare kimchi is rich in selenium and allicin. Allicin is an eminent component which helps in lowering the cholesterol levels thereby, reducing the risk of developing cardiac disorders such as strokes and heart attacks. Selenium also exerts a protective effect on the artery walls by preventing the build-up of plaque and decreasing the threat of disorders like atherosclerosis. An investigative study has advocated that fermented kimchi helps in lowering the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol along with the concentrations blood glucose in the body.**\n\nAccording to medical reports, kimchi is an excellent food to promote healthy digestion. It is a source of probiotics attributing to the process of fermentation involved in its preparation. The process of fermentation of kimchi not only enhances the taste but also creates healthy bacteria, Lactobacillus which is required by the body to keep a healthy state of intestinal flora. Kimchi  is made from cabbage which is already well known for its detoxification qualities and helps the body in getting rid of the wastes and toxins. It aids in cleaning up the intestines and stimulates better assimilation of nutrients in the body. Fiber content present in kimchi also assists in stabilizing the bowel movements and prevents constipation.\n\n**Kimchi is a valuable food which helps in reducing the risk of development of various cancers. A study performed on kimchi samples has validated its anti-cancer properties. Cabbage present in kimchi contains healthful flavonoids which are known to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Another powerful cancer fighters present in cruciferous such as cabbage are glucosinolates. Glucosinolates break down to form isothiocyanates which are well known for their effectiveness against the cancer growth.**\n\nThe presence of lactobacillus bacteria in kimchi makes it a multi-talented condiment. It extends its therapeutic effects on various skin ailments such as atopic dermatitis which is characterized by increased levels of immunoglobulin E and skin lesion such as edema and hemorrhage. A study conducted in this regard has shown that healthy bacteria present in fermented kimchi exerts suppressive effects on the mite-induced dermatitis and helps in reducing the inflammation.\n\n**As already stated, kimchi is a source of healthy lactobacillus bacteria which the body utilizes for its healthy functioning. This good bacterium also assists in weight loss by controlling the appetite and reducing the blood sugar levels. The fiber content present in kimchi keeps your body full and hunger satisfied for a longer duration preventing you from frequent and over eating. A study conducted on obese patients has validated the favorable effects of fermented kimchi on the body with respect to body mass index, body fat which helps in reducing the development of factors implicated in metabolic syndrome.**\n\nThe multi-nutrient packed kimchi is rich in a range of flavonoids and phenolic components. The variety of ingredients including ginger, garlic, peppers involved in the preparations of kimchi are super protectors which are renowned for their beneficial effect on the immune system. They help in fighting infections and are valuable in curing cold and flu symptoms.\n\n**Another valuable benefit provided by kimchi is its anti-aging qualities which attributes to the presence of antioxidants and vitamin C. A study evaluating the anti-aging activity of kimchi has revealed that kimchi helps in regulating and attenuating the inflammation that speeds up the aging process. The same study has also shown promising results with regard to factors like reduced oxidative stress in the cells, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and extended life span in the subjects making kimchi a potent anti-aging component.**\n\nKimchi is beneficial in diabetes. A study conducted on high-fat diet-fed type-2 diabetic subjects who were given kimchi revealed the anti-diabetic properties of the Korean delicacy. The study showed better glucose tolerance and lower levels of fasting glucose after eating kimchi-containing diet in the diabetic subjects.  The same study also suggested that kimchi can prove more useful in diabetes if it is eaten with normal or low-fat diet instead of high-fat food. \n\n**Individuals suffering from high blood pressure should be cautious while eating kimchi because of the presence of high salt concentration which gets further accentuated during the fermentation process. However, a study conducted on hypertensive subjects revealed that even under the conditions of hypertension, eating low-sodium kimchi may not exert harmful effects on the blood pressure and cardiac activities.**   \n\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 282g\nCalories: 96\nCalories from Fat: 10\nTotal Fat: 1g (2% of daily value)\nSaturated Fat: 0.g (0% of daily value)\nCholesterol 0mg: (0% of daily value)\nSodium: 2206mg (92% of daily value)\t \nTotal Carbohydrate: 20g (7% of daily value)\nDietary Fiber 2g: (10% of daily value)\nSugars: 1g\t \nProtein: 3g\n\n\nVitamin A: 45% of daily value\nVitamin C: 21% of daily value\nCalcium: 6% of daily value\nIron: 1% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.kscpp.net/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Tpm6kbNBiWE%3D&tabid=140&mid=498)\n\n[Resource 2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456350)\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09333.html)\n\n[Resource 4](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09354.html)\n\nResource 5](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/vitamin-a-retinol)\n\n[Resource 6](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002404.htm)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2a59ei/kimchi/", "created_utc": 1404830032.0, "score": 19, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2a59ei/kimchi/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "\"Copious amounts of Jolly Ranchers\" aka: Sugar and Sugar", "selftext": "A copious amount of Jolly Ranchers is pretty much all just sugar. So, I will be looking at the health benefits of Sugar below, and I will also try another way of writing up these.  Let me know if you perfer point by point or this way:\n\n\nSugar, for all its faults, does have benefits.  Unlike protein or fat, sugar's energy is more readily available to be converted to energy (ATP in the case of the human body).  When entering our bloodstream, it converts into glucose, which besides being the simplest sugar, is the type your cells most easily absorb and use.  Sugar, in moderate amounts, is essential to mood and your brain.  And while it warrants more testing, Sugar Therapy for injuries has been shown to promote healing (Sugar is hydroscopic and if we remember from Honey, that means that it will pull water out of substances, which in this case means bacteria.)\n\n\nBut onto the oft-reported negatives of sugar.  The largest issue with sugar (remember that im talking in regards to pure sugar/candies like Jolly Ranchers), is the lack of other nutrients.  Yes, eating  a chocolate bar isnt healthy, but at least you're gaining the benefits that chocolates bring.  Sugar has no; nutrients, protein, healthy fats, enzymes.  It gets absorbed by the body so fast that it doesn't satiate nearly as much as Fats or proteins do, since they take longer to be digested.  Combine this with the positive \"high\" that sugar gives (Sugar has been shown to raise mood.) and we reach a feedback loop of sugar consumption equating to happiness, which in turn causes the body to crave more.   To quote a source (which will be listed below, and lists PR studies as sources).  Sugar is also loved by acid-producing mouth bacteria, which cause damage to your teeth.\n\n>Stresses the Liver: \u201cWhen we eat fructose, it goes to the liver. If liver glycogen is low, such as after a run, the fructose will be used to replenish it (3).However, most people aren\u2019t consuming fructose after a long workout and their livers are already full of glycogen. When this happens, the liver turns the fructose into fat (2). Some of the fat gets shipped out, but part of it remains in the liver. The fat can build up over time and ultimately lead to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (4, 5, 6).\u201d\n\n>Increases Bad Cholesterol and Triglycerides (source)\n\n>Can contribute to Leptin Resistance (and then weight gain, cravings, sleep trouble, etc) \u2013 source\n\n>Creates an addictive sugar response in the brain (source)\n\n>Doesn\u2019t fill you up and instead encourages you to eat more\n\nOverall, mass consumption of sugar is a massively detremental thing for your everyday person, on the level of cigarette smoking.\n\nI'll end with a fact:  One chemical is  C^12 H^22 O^11. , and another is C^17 H^21 NO^4 .

{"title": "Honey", "selftext": "* **Honey as an anti-bacterial**:  Perhaps the most common of the things attributed to honey is its anti-bacterial/fungal properties.  This is mainly due to honey being very acidic (average ph of 4.75) and its high Osmolarity (High sugar content).  Most cells need a very balanced ph to survive and also need water to as well.  Honey has such a high Osmolarity that it literally sucks the water out of the bacterial cell and causes it to shrivel up and die. In lab experiments, it has been shown that honey can be effective against MRSA, although this hasnt been repeated in human trials, as well as also being effective again H. Pylori (a major cause of Stomach Ulcers).  It is also due to these two features that allows honey to remain shelf-stable for an extremely long time (if stored right, for 1000's of years.\"\n\n* **Honey to reduce allergies**:  Honey may help some people with allergies, but as a general allergy prevention method, it fails for a couple reasons.  Most allergies are caused by windborne allergens, which bees do not carry.  The other side is that even if it were to work, the acids of your stomach would break down the honey, rendering any benefits null.  There are some studies however that show that honey may relieve a runny nose, which segues to....\n\n* **Honey vs. the common cold**: Honey has been shown in studies to beat out Dextromethorphan in easing night-time coughing in children.  This has not been replicated in adults however, but the results are expected to be similar.\n\n* **Honey and Diabetes**:  Although some people may play into honey being more natural and healthier than regular sugar, in truth its still a sugar and to diabetes, a sugar is a sugar...... Honey is still sugar in the end, which a lot of people somewhat seem to gloss over.  Consuming too much honey, just like just about any other food can be bad for you.  However, there is a darker side to honey\n\n* ** The dark side to honey**: Infant Botulism. While giving an infant honey would be a great thing, it may contain Clostridium Botulinum which causes Botulism (2070ng or 2.07mcg is the average LD50 if inhaled by the average adult male, so we're talking orders of magnitude less if consumed by an infant).  Any health benefits given from honey can be replicated throught breast feeding and as such, * **DO NOT GIVE INFANTS HONEY**\n\nIf any clarification is needed, feel free to post or respond.

{"title": "Green Peas", "selftext": "Peas contain phytosterols especially \u00df-sitosterol. Studies suggest that vegetables like legumes, fruits and cereals rich in plant sterols help lower cholesterol levels in the body.\n\n**Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are risk factors not only for the development of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, but also for the development of cancers. A recent research study has begun to examine the benefits of green peas with respect to one particular type of cancer\u2014stomach cancer. Stomach cancer (also called gastric cancer) is a disease that occurs more commonly in persons who have very low intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients, including key nutrients called polyphenols. A recent study based in Mexico City has shown that daily consumption of green peas along with other legumes is associated with decreased risk of stomach cancer. In particular, decreased risk of stomach cancer in this study was associated with average daily intake of a polyphenol called coumestrol at a level of 2 milligrams or higher. Pulses (including green peas) were determined to be a key food contributor to coumestrol in this Mexico-based study. Since one cup of green peas contains at least 10 milligrams of coumestrol, green peas are very likely to provide some unique health benefits in this cancer-prevention area. Of course, coumestrol is not the only cancer-protective nutrient present in green peas! The wide variety of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients in green peas is very likely to play a primary role in the cancer-preventive benefits of this food.**\n\nGarden peas are also good in vitamin K. 100 g of fresh leaves contains about 21% of daily requirement of vitamin K-1 (phylloquinone). Vitamin K has found to have a potential role in bone mass building function by promoting osteo-trophic activity in the bone. It also has established role in Alzheimer's disease patients by limiting neuronal damage in the brain.\n\n**Green peas help regulate blood sugar levels.**\n\nThe many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds within peas support healthy blood vessels. The formation of plaque along our blood vessel walls starts with chronic, excessive oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\n**The generous amounts of vitamin B1 and folate, B2, B3, and B6  in green peas help to reduce homocysteine levels  which are  risk factor for heart disease.**\n\nGreen peas are loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients, and these health-supportive nutrients are provided in a wide range of nutrient categories. For example, in the flavonoid category, green peas provide us with the antioxidants catechin and epicatechin. In the carotenoid category, they offer alpha-carotene and beta-carotene. Their phenolic acids include ferulic and caffeic acid. Their polyphenols include coumestrol. Pisumsaponins I and II and pisomosides A and B are anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found almost exclusively in peas. Antioxidant vitamins provided by green peas include vitamin C and vitamin E, and a good amount of the antioxidant mineral zinc is also found in this amazing food. Yet another key anti-inflammatory nutrient needs to be added to this list, and that nutrient is omega-3 fat. Recent research has shown that green peas are a reliable source of omega-3 fat in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In one cup of green peas, you can expect to find about 30 milligrams of ALA. Although large-scale studies on green pea intake and these chronic health problems remain unavailable, researchers have already begun to suggest connections in this area, particularly with respect to type 2 diabetes. We know that chronic, unwanted inflammation and chronic, unwanted oxidative stress increase our risk of type 2 diabetes. We also know that intake of green peas is associated with lowered risk of type 2 diabetes, even though this association has traditionally been understood to involve the strong fiber and protein content of green peas. Researchers now believe that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients in greens peas play an equally important role in lowering our risk of this chronic health problem.\n\n**Fresh green peas also contain adequate amounts of anti-oxidants flavonoids such as carotenes, lutein and zea-xanthin as well as vitamin-A (provide 765 IU or 25.5% of RDA per 100 g). Vitamin A is an essential nutrient required for maintaining health of mucus membranes, skin and eye-sight. Further, consumption of natural fruits rich in flavonoids helps to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.**\n\nIn addition to folates, peas are also good in many other essential B-complex vitamins such as pantothenic acid, niacin, thiamin, and pyridoxine. Furthermore, they are rich source of many minerals such as calcium, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese.\n\n**Peas are relatively low in calories on comparison with beans, and cowpeas. 100 g of green peas provide only 81 calories, and no cholesterol. Nonetheless, the legumes are a good source of proteins, and soluble as well as insoluble fiber.**\n\nFresh pea pods are excellent source of folic acid. 100 g provides 65 \u00b5g or 16% of recommended daily levels of folates. Folates are B-complex vitamins required for DNA synthesis inside the cell. Well established research studies suggest that adequate folate rich foods in expectant mothers would help prevent neural tube defects in the newborn babies.\n\n**Fresh green peas are very good in ascorbic acid (vitamin C).

As with Teas, over-consumption of caffeine can cause headaches, sleep issues and anxiety. \n\n* While the process are still unclear as to what causes it, Coffee has been shown to cause a decrease in Cirrhosis of the liver and of hepatocellular carcinoma (A liver cancer commonly found in patients suffering from Cirrhosis).  A study by Harvard Medical School showed a 50% risk reduction in liver cancer among coffee drinkers\n\n* Coffee has been shown to reduce the risk of  oral, esophageal, and pharyngeal cancer.  \n\n*  Coffee has been shown to reduce risk of and the mortality rate of Heat Failure and of Cardiovascular disease.  A study has shown in Japanese men that coffee has an inverse relationship between Triglycerides and blood pressure, and the consumption of coffee.  However, this could not be duplicated in women.\n\n* It is also shown to be a powerful stimulant for peristalsis, causing food and waste to be moved through the digestive tract.  **Research has shown that moderate consumption of coffee does not act as a diuretic, as current evidence shows the body treats it no differently from normal water/ non-caffeinated beverages.** \n\n*  Coffee is a powerful antioxidant, with the espresso extracrion method showing the highest activity. \n\n* Tannins found in Coffee have been shown to reduce the rate of dental cavaties, due in part to it interfering in the glucosyltransferase activity of m. streptococci.  \n\n***Health Risks***\n\n*As it is a stimulant, caffeine in coffee can become addicting, leading to withdrawl symptoms such as anxiety and decreased alertness\n\n* While praised as reducing cancer risks, 19 carcinogenic compounds are found in roasted coffee.  A weak positive relation between bladder cancer and coffee consumption has been found.  Instant coffee has a higher amount of these compounds compared to other brewing methods.\n\n* Coffee can cause the inflammation of the stomach lining and ulcers, so people who are at risk should keep consumption low.\n\n* The tannins in coffee, like tea, cause issues with iron and folic acid absorbtion.  Coupled with the fact that the chemicals in coffee stay in a fetus' body 10 times as long as the mothers, coffee shouldn't be consumed while pregnant. \n\n* 5+ cups of coffee a day has been linked to coronary heart disease.  (This is an oversimplification and to go into all of the research would probably a thread in and of itself.  \n\n* Consuming caffeine with acetomenaphine (Tylenol) can cause liver damage\n\n* Another thing coffee contains is acrylamide, a compound which in animal studies has been shown to be a neurotoxin. Effect in humans is unclear, and since it it's commonly found in high levels in fried starches, it is abundant. Food regulatory agencies do not know how to handle this potential toxin so it is often ignored and most are ignorant of it. (Credit for this addition goes to u/omicr0n .)\n\n***Decaf vs. regular coffee***\nDecaf is a misnomer as it does contain a minute amount of caffeine (5mg vs. 150-160 mg).\n  Decaf is as the name says, coffee without caffeine.  Removing this removes most of the benefits of caffeine, but also removes the downsides to it.  The one area where the two types differ is that decaf causes a small change in blood lipids as where coffee does not. Aside from this small thing, the two a virtually identical.    \n\n***Nutritional Info***\n\n\n* Calories- 2  \n* Fat- 0.05g\n* Sodium- 5 mg\n* Carbs- 0.25g\n* Sugar-0g \n* Protein-0.25g\n\n***Links***\n\n[Studies in the resources part]\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_coffee#Caffeine_and_analgesics)\n\n[Comparison of Decaf to regular]\n(http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food/article/decaf-healthy-choice)\n\n[Nutritional Info]\n(http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/3898/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f33h5/coffee/", "created_utc": 1369584407.0, "score": 107, "author": "Woefinder", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f33h5/coffee/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Cheddar specifically ripens first with lactic acid bacteria, allowing for conversion of lactose into lactic acid (Which is great if you are lactose intolerant!). The curds that form after are filtered of whey protein and set to a pH of about 6.4. After this, it is salted to about 1-3%, packaged and pressed, and then aged for a period of time[^2]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(09%2970500-4/abstract),[^3]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(08%2971439-5/abstract). \nThe biggest difference between light cheddar and cheddar in general is saturated fat content(As well as some differences in cholesterol and calcium content). One study has found that flavor is affected from this difference as well, due to distinct ripening biochemistry pathways[^4]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(10%2900547-3/abstract) .

{"title": "Oats", "selftext": "The soluble fiber in oats absorb a considerable amount of water and when made into oatmeal significantly slows down your digestive process. This result is that you'll feel full longer, i.e. oatmeal can help you control your weight.\n\n**Oats are a very good source of selenium. A necessary cofactor of the important antioxidant, glutathione peroxidase, selenium works with vitamin E in numerous vital antioxidant systems throughout the body. These powerful antioxidant actions make selenium helpful in decreasing asthma symptoms and in the prevention of heart disease. In addition, selenium is involved in DNA repair and is associated with a reduced risk for cancer, especially colon cancer.**\n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL, the \"bad\" cholesterol) is reduced without adverse effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol), or triglyceride concentrations.\n\n**Type 2 diabetes patients given foods high in this type of oat fiber or given oatmeal or oat bran rich foods experienced much lower rises in blood sugar compared to those who were given white rice or bread. Starting out your day with a blood sugar stabilizing food such as oats may make it easier to keep blood sugar levels under control the rest of the day, especially when the rest of your day is also supported with nourishing fiber-rich foods.**\n\nResearch suggests that regular consumption of oats also reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is because oats and other whole grains are a rich source of magnesium, a mineral that acts as a co-factor for more than 300 enzymes, including enzymes involved in the body's use of glucose and insulin secretion.\n\n**Beta-glucan which can be found in oats, significantly enhances the human immune system's response to bacterial infection. Beta-glucan not only helps neutrophils (the most abundant type of non-specific immune cell) navigate to the site of an infection more quickly, it also enhances their ability to eliminate the bacteria they find there.**\n\nStudies have found that when children eat oats it can decrease their chance of developing asthma.\n\n**Although treatment of celiac disease has been thought to require lifelong avoidance of the protein gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley and oats, recent studies of adults have shown that oats, despite the small amount of gluten they contain, are well-tolerated. Now, a double blind, multi-center study involving 8 clinics treating 116 children newly diagnosed celiac disease suggests oats are a good grain choice for children with celiac disease as well. The children were randomly assigned to receive either the standard gluten-free diet (no wheat, barley, rye or oats) or a gluten-free diet with some wheat-free oat products. At the end of the study, which ran for a year, all the children were doing well, and in both groups, the mucosal lining of the small bowel (which is damaged by wheat gluten in celiac disease) had healed and the immune system (which is excessively reactive in celiac patients) had returned to normal.**\n\nConsuming oats can provide favorable changes in the physical characteristics of LDL cholesterol particles, making them less susceptible to oxidation (oxidation is thought to lead to hardening of the arteries.)\n\n**Studies have shown that when postmenopausal women ate oats it slowed the progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows. Eating oats also was shown to lessen the progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.**\n\nWhen women consume oats it greatly decreases their chance of developing breast cancer.\n\n**Oats are on the short list for the highest protein levels of any grain.**\n\nThe only real negative side effect is that eating oats can cause gas and bloating.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (156g)\nCalories: 607\nCalories from Fat: 90\nTotal Fat: 11g 17% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 2g 9% of daily value\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 3mg\nTotal Carbohydrate: 103g 34% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 17g 66% of daily value\nSugars: 0g\nProtein: 26g\nCalcium: 8% of daily value\nIron: 41% of daily value\n\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080108102225.htm)\n[Resource 2](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100216/Eat-heart-healthy-oats-to-prevent-atherosclerosis.aspx)\n[Resource 3](http://www.healthcastle.com/oats-cholesterol.shtml)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=54)\n[Resource 5](http://www.livestrong.com/article/494189-what-are-the-benefits-of-eating-oatmeal-every-morning/)\n[Resource 6](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-814-OATS.aspx?activeIngredientId=814&activeIngredientName=OATS)\n[Resource 7](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5708/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f2wdu/oats/", "created_utc": 1369575457.0, "score": 46, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f2wdu/oats/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Bacon", "selftext": "Bacon contains several grams of complete protein per serving, and provides all nine amino acids you need in your diet. Your body uses protein to maintain lean muscle mass and hormone balance, aid in brain function and keep your other tissues healthy and functional. The average American needs approximately 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day, according to Iowa State University. This translates to 60 grams of protein daily for the average 150-pound individual. A 3-ounce serving of bacon contains 29 grams of protein.\n\n**Bacon and provides vitamin B-12, a nutrient important for healthy red blood cells. Vitamin B-12 allows you to make hemoglobin, the protein your blood needs to transport oxygen. Consuming enough B-12 also helps you metabolize fats and protein, plays a role in brain function and protects you from the nerve damage that can result from vitamin B-12 deficiency. A 3-ounce serving of bacon provides 1 microgram of vitamin B-12 -- 42 percent of your daily recommended intake, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements.**\n\nBacon contains iron, an essential mineral also important for hemoglobin production. Each hemoglobin protein contains four iron atoms, and consuming enough iron in your diet helps ensure that you can make enough hemoglobin to support red blood cell function. Iron also makes up a component of myoglobin, a protein your muscles use to store oxygen. A 3-ounce serving of bacon provides 0.8 milligrams of iron. Bacon can help you reach your recommended daily iron intake -- 18 milligrams for women and 8 milligrams for men, according to the Linus Pauling Institute.\n\n**The fats in bacon are about 50% monounsaturated and a large part of those is oleic acid. This is the same fatty acid that olive oil is praised for and generally considered \u201cheart-healthy\u201d.**\n\nAbout 68 percent of the calories in every ounce of bacon stem from fat, about half of which is saturated. Add 30 milligrams of cholesterol, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for high cholesterol, which leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and high blood pressure. A 2009 National Cancer Institute study with 617,000 participants found that men who consumed processed meats often -- including bacon -- had a 27 percent greater risk of heart disease; high-consuming women had a 50 percent greater risk than those who ate processed meats once per month or less. Similarly, a 2010 Harvard study found that consuming just one serving of bacon per day was associated with a 42 percent greater risk of cardiovascular disease over those who only consumed unprocessed meats. The study indicated that bacon\u2019s high levels of nitrites, a preservative, and sodium may play roles in the increased risk of heart disease.\n\n**Bacon consumption may lead to an increased risk of developing diabetes. The 2010 Harvard study indicated that consuming one serving of processed meats \u2013 including bacon -- every day led to a 19 percent greater chance of developing diabetes. Again, the increased risk was tied to bacon\u2019s sky-high levels of sodium and nitrites. According to \"The New York Times,\" processed meats such as bacon contain 400 percent more sodium and 50 percent more nitrites than unprocessed meat. A 2010 meta-study in the journal \u201cCirculation\u201d also linked the intake of processed meats with a 19 percent higher risk of developing diabetes.**\n\nBacon consumption has been linked to higher cancer rates. A 2012 study by the World Cancer Research Fund found a 19 percent increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer per every 50 grams of bacon consumed. Study participants who ate 150 grams \u2013 or six strips \u2013 of bacon each day had a 57 percent greater risk. The National Cancer Institute study also found 20 to 22 percent higher cancer rates among the participants who ate the most processed meats. Findings like these prompted the American Institute for Cancer Research to state that it\u2019s not safe to consume processed meat.\n\n**A 2007 study from Columbia University suggests that eating lots of bacon and other processed meats \u2013 at least 14 servings per month or more \u2013 increased the risk of contracting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. This research indicated that nitrites may be a culprit in COPD, which causes conditions such as emphysema and bronchitis.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 slice (7g) pork, cured, panfried\n\nCalories: 41\nCalories from Fat: 28\nTotal Fat: 3g 5% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 1g 5% of daily value\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 9mg 3% of daily value\nSodium: 188mg 8% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 0g\nDietary Fiber: 0g\nSugars: 0g\nProtein: 3g\nIron: 1% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/good-health-benefits-sausage-bacon-8236.html)\n[Resource 2](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/2681?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=&qlookup=&offset=&sort=&format=Abridged&_action_show=Apply+Changes&Qv=1&Q4968=7.4)\n[Resource 3](http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/harmful-effect-much-bacon-1456.html)\n[Resource 5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2544536/)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/pork-products/7356/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew8wc/bacon/", "created_utc": 1369303947.0, "score": 58, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew8wc/bacon/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Hummus", "selftext": "Chickpeas (found in hummus) are legumes that are also called garbanzo beans. Beans such as chickpeas are an excellent source of fiber, which can help you keep cholesterol levels low and promote better heart health. Fiber-rich chickpeas also help diabetics regulate blood sugar levels, making hummus a particularly diabetes-friendly snack as well. The high fiber in chickpeas also helps promote a healthier digestive tract and fend off constipation.\n\n**Thank the fiber in chickpeas for making hummus a snack that fills you up and stays with you. Fiber helps you feel full and stay full, so that you won't be reaching for another snack shortly after you finish eating. Hummus is also very low in calories and fat. A 2 tbsp.-serving has only about 50 calories and 3 g of fat.**\n\nWhen you drizzle olive oil into your food processor with the garbanzo beans to make hummus, you're adding healthy fats. Olive oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are thought to be heart-healthy. These healthy fats help to lower cholesterol levels, promote healthier blood clotting and help manage blood sugar in diabetics.\n\n**Hummus can lower your risk of heart disease by lowering risk factors such as elevated cholesterol and blood pressure. According to a study published in the \"Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism,\" adding chickpeas to your diet can lower total and LDL cholesterol, the so-called \"bad\" cholesterol. The sesame seeds in the tahini paste contain high levels of magnesium, which can also help lower cholesterol as well as blood pressure. The antioxidants from garlic and the monounsaturated fatty acids in olive oil can both lower cholesterol, improve blood flow and reduce risk of atherosclerosis.**\n\nHummus may be able to help reduce the risk of cancer due to the antioxidant activity of chickpeas and garlic. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, garlic contains an abundance of antioxidants which have been reported to reduce the risk of colon and stomach cancers. Among dry beans, chickpeas contain one of the highest levels of polyphenols, a plant chemical which also acts as an antioxidant.\n\n**In some parts of the world (for example, parts of India), garbanzo beans are eaten daily in large amounts and on a year-round basis. But a recent study has shown that we can obtain health benefits from garbanzo beans even when we eat much smaller amounts over a much shorter period of time. In this study, it took only one week of garbanzo bean consumption to improve participants' control of blood sugar and insulin secretion. Equally important, only one-third cup of the beans per day was needed to provide these blood-sugar related health benefits.**\n\nHummus is good for pregnant women. Hummus is rich in folic acid, a vitamin B complex that helps in the brain development of the fetus and promotes well-being for the mother.\n\n**It helps in getting a good mood and sleep: Large amount of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were found in hummus. These amino acids help in promoting well-rested sleep and uplift one\u2019s mood; and so eating hummus everyday can lead to satisfying shut eye.**\n\nAids in controlling glucose levels: Hummus has low glycemic value. This helps in controlling the increase of your glucose levels, which are beneficial to hyperglycemic patients.\n\n**Garbanzos are a food you definitely want to keep on your \"digestive support\" list\u2014especially if you are focusing on the colon. Between 65-75% of the fiber found in garbanzo beans is insoluble fiber, and this type of fiber remains undigested all the way down to the final segment of your large intestine (colon). Recent studies have shown that garbanzo bean fiber can be metabolized by bacteria in the colon to produce relatively large amounts of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic, propionic, and butyric acid. These SCFAs provide fuel to the cells that line your intestinal wall. By supporting the energy needs of our intestinal cells, the SCFAs made from garbanzo fibers can help lower your risk of colon problems, including your risk of colon cancer.**\n\nMany of our body systems are susceptible to oxidative stress and damage from reactive oxygen molecules. These systems include our cardiovascular system, our lungs, and our nervous system. Plentiful amounts of antioxidant nutrients are critical for the support of these body systems, and garbanzo beans are a remarkable food in terms of their antioxidant composition. While containing small but valuable amounts of conventional antioxidant nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, garbanzo beans also contain more concentrated supplies of antioxidant phytonutrients. These phytonutrients include the flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin (usually found in the outer layer of the beans), and the phenolic acids ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and vanillic acid (usually found in the interior portion of the beans). Depending on the type of bean and color/thickness of the outer layer, garbanzo beans can also contain significant amounts of the anthocyanins delphinidin, cyanidin, and petunidin. The mineral manganese\u2014a key antioxidant in the energy-producing mitochondria found inside most cells\u2014is also provided in excellent amounts by garbanzo beans. In fact, just one cup of garbanzos can provide you with nearly 85% of the Daily Value (DV) for this key antioxidant. An increasing number of animal and human studies clearly show the ability of garbanzo beans to reduce our risk of heart disease, and we believe that an important part of this risk reduction is due to the fantastic antioxidant make-up of these legumes.\n\n**Chickpeas cause flatulence (not necessarily a bad thing.)**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (246g) commercial hummus\n\nCalories: 408\nCalories from Fat: 198\nTotal Fat: 24g 36% of daily value \nSaturated Fat: 4g 18% of daily value \nTrans Fat: 0g \nCholesterol: 0mg \nSodium: 932mg 39% of daily value \nTotal Carbohydrate: 35g 12% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 15g 59% of daily value\nSugars: 0g \nProtein: 19g\nVitamin A: 1% of daily value\nCalcium: 9% of daily value\nIron 33% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/446490-what-are-the-health-benefits-of-hummus/)\n[Resource 2](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/hummus-healthy-5821.html)\n[Resource 3](http://www.simple-remedies.com/health-food/benefits-of-eating-hummus.html)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=58)\n[Resource 5](http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-foods-give-you-gas.html#vply=0)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4407/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew9uh/hummus/", "created_utc": 1369305817.0, "score": 51, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew9uh/hummus/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Grapes", "selftext": "The most crucial benefit you derive from eating grapes is production of anti-oxidants in your body. Grapes are rich in antioxidants due to the presence of phytonutrients called polyphenols. These antioxidants bind with the \u201cfree radicals\u201d present in  your body and reduce the risk of plague formation on the arteries, thus improving your heart\u2019s health. Grapes also help in the generation of nitric oxide in the body. This compound helps improve heart health by reducing blood clots, platelet aggregation and oxidation of LDL (which causes plagues on the arteries).\n\n**Thanks to their antioxidant properties, grapes also offer some measure of protection against cancer. Studies have found that grape seed extract can kill leukemia cells and head and neck cancer cells, and can prevent the growth of breast, stomach, colon, prostate and lung cancer cells in laboratory experiments.**\n\nResveratrol, a polyphenol found in grape skins and seed, keeps the heart muscles flexible and healthy. Resveratrol also breaks down bad cholesterol. The reason why \u201cred wines\u201d have gained popularity is because of their high concentration of Resveratrol. The French who eat a high fat diet have been found to have low heart disease stats, a phenomenon known as the \u201cFrench Paradox, which is largely owning to their consumption of red wine and grapes.\n\n**Although few large-scale clinical studies have been conducted, evidence points toward consumption of grapes as being beneficial for brain health. An animal study at the University of Houston found that rats fed a grape-enriched diet experienced reduced anxiety and learning and memory problems brought on by anxiety. Another study found that participants who drank a glass of Concord grape juice daily scored better on the California Verbal Learning Test than participants who did not. Key antioxidant components of grapes have also been linked to improved brain health. In 2008, researchers at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University reported that supplementing with resveratrol, commonly found in grapes, reduced plaque formation, a factor associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and other related diseases, in animal brains.**\n\nThanks to presence of antioxidant compounds in grapes, it helps bind free radicals in the body. These free radicals or \u201coxidants\u201d are responsible for instigating cancer formation in various organs of the body. It has been studied that drinking red wine can reduce the risk of lung cancer by 13%, owing to high concentration of antioxidants like resveratrol. You can get the same benefit from eating purple grapes on daily basis, if you don\u2019t want to drink red wine.\n\n**It has been found the grapes have several anti-microbial properties but they are not harmful to the beneficial bacteria in the stomach. Tests have shown that grape extracts inhibited the growth of 14 different types of harmful bacteria commonly found in human intestine and stomach including E coli, Salmonella and H. pylori (which causes stomach ulcers).**\n\nStudies from the University of Missouri-Columbia show that grapes prevent brain damage in the event of a stroke.\n\n**Grapes have a significant amount of potassium and increase brain activity.**\n\nThe fiber found in grapes occurs in two forms, known as soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber is found in the soft part of grapes. In the digestive tract, it forms a gel that can promote regular bowel movements. Grape peels contain insoluble fiber, which helps food move through the digestive tract more quickly. These types of fiber act as natural laxatives, so eating large quantities of grapes may cause loose stools or gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: 100g of grapes\nCalories: 60\nCarbohydrates: 15 g\nSugar: 15 g\nProteins: 21g\nFat: 21g\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.outofstress.com/grapes-good-for-you/)\n[Resource 2](http://www.med.umich.edu/cvc/)\n[Resource 3](http://www.livestrong.com/article/547902-negative-effects-of-eating-grapes/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/inside_fordham/february_6_2012/news/want_better_vision_e_81620.asp)\n[Resource 5](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/eating_purple_grapes_and_potential_health_benefits)\n[Resource 6](http://hsibaltimore.com/2003/12/24/the-health-benefits-of-eating-grapes/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eu1ce/grapes/", "created_utc": 1369231381.0, "score": 43, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eu1ce/grapes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Catechins increase metabolism, helping the body to burn fat faster.\n\n**Catechins are also antibacterial and antiviral agents, so green tea can reduce the risk for a variety of infections, dental conditions, and possibly even the spread of disease.**\n\nDiabetic? Green tea can help regulate blood sugar levels.\n\n**Green tea could help lower the risk of high blood pressure, as well as help the body handle changes in blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels. It may also reduce the risk of heart attacks by preventing clots from forming. However, in 2006 the U.S. FDA rejected a petition to allow labels to declare that green teas reduce the risk of heart disease.**\n\nThe antioxidants found in green tea can neutralize free radicals, which are linked to aging, cancer, and other diseases.\n\n**Studies indicate that green tea kills certain cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. It has been linked with lower risk for bladder, breast, and ovarian cancer. There is conflicting evidence about its effects on colon, rectal, esophageal, lung, pancreatic, prostate, skin, and stomach cancers.**\n\nGreen tea has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties than can reduce signs of aging.

{"title": "Sparkling Water", "selftext": "The most important nutritional benefit of sparkling water is hydration. Water makes up 60 percent of your total body weight. A dehydrated cell dies rapidly. Every system in your body relies on water, and water is needed to flush out toxins and moisten your nose, mouth, throat and lungs. Sparkling water is as effective as regular spring water or tap water in replacing fluids lost in urine or sweat.\n\n**Got an upset stomach? Feeling queasy? Ate too much fatty or spicy food? Rather than reach for the antacids, try drinking a glass of seltzer. Researchers have found that people with both indigestion and constipation who drank at least 1 1/2 liters of carbonated water every day for 15\u201330 days had a big improvement in their symptoms compared to people who drank regular tap water.**\n\nSparkling mineral water is known to reduce LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels. Elevated levels of LDL can cause cardiovascular issues such as high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\n**This may sound odd, but in a study where postmenopausal women were given a carbonated mineral water to drink, after two months, these women had lower LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) and higher HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol level, as well as lower fasting glucose levels, compared to women who drank regular water. The mineral water used in this study contained bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. It\u2019s thought that the alkaline pH of the water affected absorption and excretion of cholesterol.Carbonated waters do not leech calcium from bones, nor do they contribute to kidney stone formation. However, there may be people who need to limit their intake of fizzy water. If you have irritable bowel syndrome, you might want to go easy on all fizzy drinks as they can make you even more bloated than you already may be. People with acid reflux should be careful about carbonated beverages, as drinking them may sometimes aggravate symptoms. Also, if you need to watch your sodium intake, go for seltzer instead of club soda. Club soda contains about 60 to 80 milligrams of sodium per serving, whereas seltzer has none.**\n\nSparkling mineral water contains bicarbonate. Bicarbonate helps balance sodium levels in the body.\n\n**The Journal of Nutrition study found that the drinking of the sodium-rich mineral water did not lead to any increase in blood pressure. One reason for this is that sparkling waters tend to be rich in bicarbonate, which is believed to help balance any negative effects sodium may have in the body.**\n\nOne of the myths out there is that drinking fizzy water will erode tooth enamel. This probably stems from the fact that when carbon dioxide gas is pumped into water, small amounts of carbonic acid are formed. But studies have shown that this small amount of acid doesn\u2019t hurt your teeth. In fact, fizzy waters contain calcium and other minerals (albeit, in small amounts) that can actually buffer the carbonic acid and protect tooth enamel. On the other hand both regular and diet soda contain phosphoric acid and/or citric acid, which can be harmful to dental enamel.\n\n**Sparkling mineral water can help increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Increased levels of HDL (\"good\" cholesterol) can reduce cardiovascular issues such as heart disease and high blood pressure.**\n\nCarbonation found in sparkling mineral water can kill harmful bacteria. Bacteria can cause infections and attack the immune system.\n\n**As the carbonated water fizzes and bubbles in the stomach, it can cause a buildup of air, and this can lead to loud belching. This belching can sometimes become uncontrollable. This buildup of air can also cause abdominal distension, or bloating. If enough carbonated water is consumed, you can suffer from painful, chronic bloating. The pain from bloating can even be mistaken for other illnesses such as appendicitis, and you may even feel the need to seek medical help.**\n\nCarbonated beverages can cause an excess production of stomach acid, which can irritate the stomach lining and cause a peptic ulcer. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, peptic ulcers are open sores in the stomach lining, esophagus or the first part of the intestine, also called the duodenum. This can cause significant pain and even lead to bleeding in the stomach. Some people also vomit blood or have black stools caused by the bleeding in the stomach. This condition requires immediate medical treatment.\n\n**Carbonated water can cause a buildup of air that can move down the digestive tract and into the colon, causing flatulence. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, one sure way to avoid flatulence is to avoid carbonated beverages all together.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size: 1 serving\nCalories: 0 (nothing else to report on)\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.drbriffa.com/2005/01/23/sparkling-water/)\n[Resource 2](http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/Blog/Amy-Campbell/carbonated-water-yes-or-no/)\n[Resource 3](http://www.ehow.com/facts_4869228_health-benefits-sparkling-mineral-water.html)\n[Resource 4](http://www.livestrong.com/article/343521-sparkling-water-nutrition/)\n[Resource 5](http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-olive-garden-san-pellegrino-sparkling-i127844)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epbpk/sparkling_water/", "created_utc": 1369068966.0, "score": 35, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epbpk/sparkling_water/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Brown Rice", "selftext": "Brown rice is a good source of magnesium, a mineral that is essential to bone health. Just one cup of brown rice contains 21 percent of the recommended daily value of magnesium. Most of the magnesium in the body is stored on or in the bones, so to keep a high level of magnesium in your bones, and to reap the other health benefits, eat plenty of brown rice each week.\n\n**Brown rice has a rich content of manganese, which helps in the production of energy from carbohydrates and protein. The nutrient also plays a key role in the synthesis of fatty acids, which is necessary for a healthy nervous system. One can get about 88% of the daily needs for manganese by consuming juts one cup of brown rice. The manganese present in brown rice is also required for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase, which protects the mitochondria against the free radicals formed during energy production.**\n\nBrown rice is a rich source of fiber and selenium, both of which help lower the risk of colon cancer significantly. Selenium also works with vitamin E, in several antioxidant systems of the body, which help fight against heart diseases. This is also beneficial against the symptoms of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**The rice also contains insoluble fiber, which helps women avoid developing gallstones.**\n\nThe oil present in brown rice helps in lowering the cholesterol level in the body.\n\n**Brown rice works extremely good for postmenopausal women with complains of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other symptoms of cardiovascular diseases.**\n\nBrown rice is abundant in plant lignans, which get converted into mammalian lignans like enterolactone, in the intestine. Enterolactone is highly protective against breast and other hormone-dependent cancers and also heart diseases.\n\n**The rice helps in reducing the risk of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is associated with symptoms like visceral obesity, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and low level of defensive HDL cholesterol.**\n\nBrown rice reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Brown rice is a good source of magnesium, which reduces the severity of asthma, lowers the frequency of migraine headaches and decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Magnesium balances the action of calcium and thus, helps in regulating nerve and muscle tone.**\n\nBrown rice offers major protection against breast cancer, especially in pre-menopausal women.\n\n**Intake of brown rice can help the body fight against the childhood asthma. It is also protective against obesity, ischemic stroke and insulin resistance.**\n\nOne cup of brown rice will provide you with 88.0% of the daily value for manganese. This trace mineral helps produce energy from protein and carbohydrates and is involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, which are important for a healthy nervous system, and in the production of cholesterol, which is used by the body to produce sex hormones. Manganese is also a critical component of a very important antioxidant enzyme called superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is found inside the body's mitochondria (the oxygen-based energy factories inside most of our cells) where it provides protection against damage from the free radicals produced during energy production.\n\n**Brown Rice is rich in fiber, which contributes towards the reduction of cholesterol level and also the prevention of atherosclerosis. The fiber also binds to the cancer-causing chemicals, protecting the body against colon cancer. The fiber present in brown rice also helps normalize the bowel function and thus, reduces constipation.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size = 195g\nCalories: 216\nCalories from Fat: 15\nTotal Fat: 2g/3% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 10mg/0% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 45g/15% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 4g/14% of daily value\nSugars: 1g\nProtein: 5g\nCalcium: 2%\nIron: 5%\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/benefits-of-brown-rice-6211.html)\n[Resource 2](http://nutritiousfoods.blogspot.kr/2009/10/health-benefits-of-brown-rice.html?m=1)\n[Resource 3](http://www.symptomfind.com/nutrition-supplements/brown-rice-health-benefits/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=128)\n[Resource 5](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5707/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epd7d/brown_rice/", "created_utc": 1369070160.0, "score": 26, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epd7d/brown_rice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Ramen Noodles", "selftext": "Once you have consumed instant noodles, it will take 4 to 5 days to excrete the wax, which is coated on the noodles, from the body. But we can get rid off the wax if the noodles are cooked in the right way.\n\n**A major mark against ramen noodles is the sodium, notes Women Fitness, which put the noodles on its \"Top 10 Foods Worst to Consume\" list. The noodles' flavor packets contain anywhere from the beef's 861 mg of sodium to 3,000 mg in some other flavors. The recommended daily dose of sodium, as per the Dietary Reference Intake, should be no more than 1,440 mg. Another mark against the noodles is they are basically rolled dough that is deep-fried and lack any significant nutritional value.**\n\nThe packet inside of the Ramen noodle package contains large amounts of sodium. The flavor packet also contains monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives MSG the nod as an ingredient that is \"generally recognized as safe.\" Different research groups and individuals have sent the FDA reports of some MSG side effects. According to \"Contemporary Nutrition,\" the food additive industry readily admits that MSG has addictive properties and can cause people to gain weight, but they justify its use by claiming that this can be beneficial to elderly persons who are sometimes malnourished. Glutamate, the main component of MSG, is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and it has been linked to neurological symptoms when taken in excess.\n\n\n**On any diet, you must make sure to get enough protein. Ramen noodles can deliver in this area, with an average of 10 grams of protein per serving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests adult women get at least 46 protein grams per day, while adult men need at least 56 grams daily. Ramen noodles provide you with healthy protein. One package will give you up to one-fourth of the daily intake you need.

{"title": "Lamb", "selftext": "Lamb, being a red meat, has high amount of dietary saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which can result in different forms of chronic diseases, including heart diseases and some forms of cancer.\n\n**Like other meat items, lamb also contains naturally occurring substances like purines that are responsible for the health condition called gout and even the formation of kidney stones.Hence, it is advisable for individuals suffering with kidney problems or gout, to limit or avoid intake of purine-containing foods such as lamb.**\n\nAn average serving of lamb is a good source of high quality protein and supplies the body with 60.3% of the daily requirement for protein.\n\n**The meat contains a high amount of zinc, which is required by every living cell in the body for healthy immune function, cell division and overall growth.**\n\nAn area where we would expect to see health benefits from lamb consumption would involve blood sugar regulation. Lamb has long been a part of menus and recipes endorsed by the American Diabetic Association, where it is viewed as a lean meat that is high in protein and that can be beneficially incorporated into recipes in amounts of 3-4 ounces per serving. Lamb is often unranked on lists of glycemic index (GI) values due to its virtually non-existent carb content. This absence of carbs in lamb might allow the very broad B-vitamin content of lamb to help support metabolism of other carbs provided by other foods that were consumed alongside of the lamb. (Vitamins B1, B2 and B3 are especially important in optimal functioning of enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism.)\n\n**The meat is a good source of selenium, a mineral whose deficiency can lead to asthma attacks.**\n\nLamb is a good source of vitamin B12 and also provides important amounts of the B vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline. Vitamins B6, B12, folate and choline are especially important for healthy metabolism of homocysteine and can help prevent unwanted accumulation of excess homocysteine in the body. High blood levels of homocysteine are a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\n**It is a good source of vitamin B12, necessary to prevent a dangerous molecule called homocysteine from harming the body. It also promotes a healthy nervous system, supports the formation of red blood cells and prevents anemia. Moreover, vitamin B12 is found naturally only in animal foods.**\n\nLamb provides antioxidant minerals that have been shown to help lower risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing unwanted oxidative stress. Lamb provides a very good amount of the mineral selenium and good amount of the mineral zinc.\n\n**Despite the fact that about one-third of the fat in lamb comes from saturated fat, lamb (especially when pasture fed) can be a significant source of omega-3 fat and is also contains a large amount of monounsaturated fat (40% of its total fat). Both omega-3 fat and monounsaturated fat have been associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.**\n\nThe niacin (vitamin B3) present in lamb provides protection against Alzheimer's disease, promotes healthy skin and keeps age-related cognitive decline at bay. Moreover, it retards the risk of developing osteoarthritis by as much as half.\n\n**Lamb is rich in iron, which is an integral component of hemoglobin and aids formation of red blood cells in the body. The form in which iron is present in lamb is easily absorbed by the body.**\n\nThe omega-3 content of lamb depends upon the young sheep's diet as well as the mother's diet, but when those diets are nutritionally supportive, the result can be a cut of lamb with a very impressive amount of omega-3s. In regions of some countries without access to a coastline and fish, lamb has sometimes been shown to provide more omega-3s than any other food in the diet. In Australia, where lamb is eaten frequently by both children and adults, recent studies have shown lamb to rank among the top omega-3 foods in the daily diet. In our own nutritional profile of lamb, we use a conservative average estimate of 40 milligrams of omega-3s per ounce of roasted lamb loin. That's 50% of the omega-3s in an ounce of baked cod fish or broiled tuna, and 67% of the amount in an ounce of sesame seeds.\n\n**Selenium has antioxidant properties which help to boost the body\u2019s immune system. It protects body cells from damage by free radicals. Selenium can be found in lamb and is known to enhance thyroid functions and facilitates the activities of various essential enzymes. Selenium has also been found helpful in fighting viral infections.

{"title": "Avocados", "selftext": "Not all fat is bad for your body, and monounsaturated fat in particular is what constitutes the first health benefit of an avocado. In a typical avocado, most of the calories you receive come from monounsaturated fat. The monounsaturated fat in an avocado is healthy for you. Foods like avocados that contain monounsaturated fat lessen your LDL cholesterol, which is harmful to your body. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol has been called \"good cholesterol,\" and there is speculation that monounsaturated fat actually raises this type of cholesterol.\n\n**Research has shown that certain compounds in avocados are able to seek out pre-cancerous and cancerous oral cancer cells and destroy them without harming healthy cells.**\n\nAvocados are packed with vitamins. The vitamins that you can find in an avocado are B vitamins along with vitamin K and vitamin E. B vitamins help your body's metabolism and its maintenance of a healthy skin tone, while vitamin K plays a fundamental role in making sure that your bones grow properly and that your bone density is maintained in later life. Vitamin E is necessary to avoid conditions like retinopathy.\n\n**The high levels of folate in avocado are also protective against strokes. People who eat diets rich in folate have a much lower risk of stroke than those who don't.**\n\nAvocados are a great source of lutein, a carotenoid that works as an antioxidant and helps protect against eye disease. They also contain the related carotenoids zeaxanthin, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, as well as tocopherol (vitamin E).\n\n**Half an avocado contains 3.4 grams of fiber, including soluble and insoluble, both of which your body needs to keep the digestive system running smoothly. Plus, soluble fiber slows the breakdown of carbohydrates in your body, helping you feel full for longer. Avocados also contain oleic acid, a fat that activates the part of your brain that makes you feel full. Healthier unsaturated fats containing oleic acid have been shown to produce a greater feeling of satiety than less-healthy saturated fats and trans fats found in processed foods.**\n\nRich, creamy, and packed with beneficial monounsaturated fat, avocado slows digestion and helps keep blood sugar from spiking after a meal. A diet high in good fats may even help reverse insulin resistance, which translates to steadier blood sugar long-term.\n\n**One cup of avocado provides almost a quarter of your recommended daily intake of folate, a vitamin which cuts the risk of birth defects. If you\u2019re pregnant\u2014or planning to be\u2014avocados will help protect your unborn baby.**\n\nA high folate intake is also associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and heart disease. Does your family have a history of heart problems, or do you have risk factors (such as being overweight or smoking) for heart disease? Avocados could help keep your heart healthy.\n\n**As well as increasing feelings of fullness, the oleic acid in avocados can help reduce cholesterol levels. In one study, individuals eating an avocado-rich diet had a significant decrease in total cholesterol levels, including a decrease in LDL cholesterol. Their levels of HDL cholesterol (the healthy type) increased by 11 percent.**\n\nThe combination of avocado's high potassium content, 30 percent more than banana, with omega-3 and oleic acid are beneficial toward reducing blood pressure.\n\n**Inflammation is considered the basis of most non-contagious diseases. Avocados have an abundance of plant phytonutrient polyphenols and flavonoids, which have been discovered as anti-inflammatory agents.**\n\nAvocados can help protect against prostate and breast cancers.\n\n**The master antioxidant glutathione supports the liver and the nervous system. It is responsible for replenishing and recycling other antioxidants in the body. It is vital for a strong immune system, and avocado is one of the few foods that contain a considerable amount of glutathione.**\n\nNutrients and enzymes in avocado reduce inflammation in the stomach and small intestine's mucous lining. This also improves the body's ability to absorb carotenoids and nutrients.\n\n**A study's participants who ate salads with avocados absorbed five times the amount of carotenoids than those who did not include avocados. Carotenoids include beta carotene and lycopene. Beta carotene is a precursor to vitamin A, and lycopene is a compound that reduces stroke and prostate cancer risks.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*:\n\nServing Size 1/5 medium avocado (30 g/1 oz.)\nServings Per Container 5\n\nCalories 50 Calories from Fat 35\n\n% Daily Value*\nTotal Fat  4.5g\t7%\nSaturated Fat 0.5g\t3%\nTrans Fat 0g\t \nPolyunsaturated Fat 0.5g\t \nMonounsaturated Fat 3g\t \nCholesterol 0mg\t0%\nSodium  0mg\t0%\nPotassium 150mg\t4%\nTotal Carbohydrate 3g\t1%\nDietary Fiber 2g\t8%\nSugars 0g\t \nProtein  0g\n\nVitamin A 0%\t        \u2022\tVitamin C 4%\nCalcium 0%\t                \u2022\tIron 2%\nVitamin E 4%\t        \u2022\tThiamin 2%\nRiboflavin 4%\t        \u2022\tNiacin 4%\nVitamin B6 4%\t        \u2022      Folate 6%\nPantothenic Acid 4%\t\u2022\tPhosphorus 2%\nMagnesium 2%\t        \u2022      Zinc 2%\nCopper 2%\t                \u2022\tManganese 2%\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/eat-well/healthy-eating/5-surprising-health-benefits-of-eating-avocados)\n[Resource 2](http://www.naturalnews.com/040067_avocado_cancer_prevention_superfood.html)\n[Resource 3](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/avocado-health-benefits-3-reasons-you-should-be-eating-them.html#b)\n[Resource 4](http://www.healthdiaries.com/eatthis/10-health-benefits-of-avocados.html)\n[Resource 5](http://www.avocadocentral.com/nutrition/avocado-nutrition-health-facts-label)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1enlyh/avocados/", "created_utc": 1369001092.0, "score": 70, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1enlyh/avocados/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Soda", "selftext": "One of the benefits of drinking soda is that it contains caffeine, a natural stimulant found in the kola nut, coffee beans and tea leaves. Caffeine makes you feel more alert when you're tired and might increase your performance when embarking on certain tasks. According to the International Food Council Information Foundation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has recognized caffeine as an additive that's Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS, since the late 1950s. Moderate consumption of caffeine -- around 300 mg -- is generally not harmful for healthy adults, although some people are more sensitive to caffeine. A 12 oz. can of Coke contains 34 mg of caffeine, far less than the average cup of coffee, which contains 85 mg of caffeine.\n\n**Danish researchers discovered that drinking non-diet soda leads to dramatic increases in fat buildup around your liver and your skeletal muscles, both of which can contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes. The study revealed that people who drank a regular soda every day for six months saw a 132 to 142 percent increase in liver fat, a 117 to 221 percent jump in skeletal fat, and about a 30 percent increase in both triglyceride blood fats and other organ fat. Their consumption also led to an 11 percent increase in cholesterol, compared with the people who drank other beverages such as water or milk.**\n\nResearchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center monitored 475 adults for 10 years, and found that those who drank diet soda had a 70 percent increase in waist circumference over the 10-year study, compared with those who didn't drink any soda. Those who drank more than two diet sodas per day saw a 500 percent waist expansion! A separate study the same researchers conducted on mice suggested that it was the aspartame, which raised blood glucose levels, that caused the weight gain; when your liver encounters too much glucose, the excess is converted to body fat.\n\n**Beverages with bubbles contain phosphoric acid, which can severely deplete the blood calcium levels; calcium is a key component of the bone matrix. With less concentration of calcium over a long time, it can lower deposition rates so that bone mass and density suffer. This means that drinking sodas and carbonated water increases your risk of osteoporosis.**\n\nTwo contaminants in the coloring of many sodas, 2-methylimidazole and 4-methylimidazole, have been found to cause cancer in animals, a threat deemed unnecessary, considering that the coloring is purely cosmetic. According to California's strict Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer, just 16 micrograms per person per day of 4-methylimidazole is enough to pose a cancer threat, and most popular brown colas, both diet and regular, contain 200 micrograms per 20-ounce bottle.\n\n**Diet or regular, all colas contain phosphates, or phosphoric acid, a weak acid that gives colas their tangy flavor and improves their shelf life. Although it exists in many whole foods, such as meat, dairy, and nuts, too much phosphoric acid can lead to heart and kidney problems, muscle loss, and osteoporosis, and one study suggests it could trigger accelerated aging. The study, published in a 2010 issue of the FASEB Journal, found that the excessive phosphate levels found in sodas caused lab rats to die a full five weeks earlier than the rats whose diets had more normal phosphate levels\u2014a disturbing trend considering that soda manufacturers have been increasing the levels of phosphoric acid in their products over the past few decades.**\n\nResearchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School analyzed data from the Nurses' Health Study II, a trial tracking the health of more than 51,000 women. None of the participants had diabetes at the onset of the study in 1991. Over the following 8 years, 741 women were diagnosed with the disease. Researchers found that women who drank one or more sugary drinks a day gained more weight and were 83% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who imbibed less than once a month.\n\n**Another problem with sodas is that they act as dehydrating diuretics. Both caffeine and sugar cause dehydration. Caffeine is a diuretic and causes an increase in urine volume. High concentration of sugar is drawing off water because your kidneys try to expel the excess sugar out of the blood. When you drink a caffeinated soda to quench your thirst, you will actually become more thirsty.**\n\nDiet soda is filled with artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin. These artificial sweeteners pose a threat to your health. Saccharin, for instance, has been found to be carcinogenic, and studies have found that it produced bladder cancer in rats.\n\n**Soda, no matter who makes it, is the most acidic beverage you can buy, with a pH of about 2.5, about the same as vinegar, but the sugar content disguises the acidity. To put that into perspective, consider that battery acid has a pH of 1 and pure water has a pH level of 7. Why does that matter? Throughout the digestive system, that starts from the mouth and ends up at the anus only the stomach can resist an acidic environment up to pH 2.0. But before the acidity of soft drink reaches the stomach it passes through all the other organs involved in the digestive system thus causing an abnormal acidic environment. The linings of the mouth, pharynx and esophagus are highly sensitive to acids. The phosphoric acid present in soft drink competes with the hydrochloric acid of the stomach and affects its functions. When the stomach becomes ineffective, food remains undigested causing indigestion, gassiness or bloating (swelling of stomach).**\n\ncaffeine usually present in soft drinks, and you are in for even more trouble. Caffeine can deplete the body\u2019s calcium, in addition to stimulating your central nervous system and contributing to stress, a racing mind, and insomnia.\n\n**Rapidly absorbed carbohydrates like high fructose corn syrup put more strain on insulin-producing cells than other foods. When sugar enters the bloodstream quickly, the pancreas has to secrete large amounts of insulin for the body to process it. Some scientists believe that the unceasing demands that a soda habit places on the pancreas may ultimately leave it unable to keep up with the body's need for insulin. Also, insulin itself becomes less effective at processing sugar; both conditions contribute to the risk of developing diabetes.**\n\nTake a look at the ingredients list for any soda and chances are most of those ingredients are derived from corn. As much as 88 percent of the corn grown in the U.S. is genetically modified to resist toxic pesticides or engineered to create pesticides within the plant itself. Thanks to lax government safety regulations, and tight corporate control over who gets to test these proprietary seeds, there are no human studies that can prove or disprove whether these crops are safe. Independent scientists have found that, in animals, genetically modified crops, or GMOs, are linked to digestive tract damage, accelerated aging, and even infertility. Most recently, scientists in France found that rats fed GMO corn for their entire two-year lifespan developed mammary tumors and died earlier than rats that ate non-GMO corn their entire lives.\n\n**Soft drink consumption is a strong predictor of heartburn.**\n\nAspartame, commonly known as nutrasweet, is a chemical that stimulates the brain to think the food is sweet. It breaks down into acpartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol at a temperature of 86 degrees. (Remember, your stomach is somewhere around 98 degrees.) An article put out by the University of Texas found that aspartame has been linked to obesity. The process of stimulating the brain causes more cravings for sweets and leads to carbohydrate loading.\n\n**Soda eats up and dissolves the tooth enamel. Researches say that soft drinks are responsible for doubling or tripling the incidence of tooth decay. The acidity can dissolve the mineral content of the enamel, making the teeth weaker, more sensitive, and more susceptible to decay. Soda's acidity makes it even worse for teeth than the solid sugar found in candy. Dental experts continue to urge that people drink less soda pop, especially between meals, to prevent tooth decay and dental erosion.**\n\nExperts have reasons to believe that overconsumption of fructose, particularly in the form of soft drinks, leads to an increase in blood pressure.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size = 12 fl oz (of coke)\nCalories: 98\nCarbs: 27 g\nSodium: 9 mg\nCaffeine: 24 mg\n\n*Links*: [Source 1](http://www.rodale.com/facts-about-soda?page=1)\n\n[Source 20](http://www.livestrong.com/article/475742-what-are-benefits-of-drinking-coke/)\n\n[Source 3](http://health.yahoo.net/experts/drmao/what-soft-drinks-are-doing-your-body)\n\n[Source 4](http://www.emedexpert.com/tips/soft-drinks.shtml)\n\n[Source 5](http://www.quitehealthy.com/nutrition-facts/coke/SD1771.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en2vr/soda/", "created_utc": 1368985854.0, "score": 37, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en2vr/soda/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Gatorade", "selftext": "Electrolytes, including sodium, potassium and chloride, are nutrients and are essential for the body to function properly. During heavy physical exertion, the human body perspires as a way to eliminate toxins and cool the body through evaporation. Electrolytes are components of perspiration. Heavy sweating can result in a significant loss of electrolytes. Gatorade contains all three of these is essential elements and can help to replenish losses due to excessive perspiration.\n\n**Potassium is the other major electrolyte found in Gatorade, although its overall concentration is quite low when compared to sodium. Potassium losses in perspiration are just a fraction of sodium losses, which is why an 8-ounce serving of Gatorade provides only 30 milligrams of potassium. Despite the smaller quantities, replacing the potassium is important in prolonged exercise lasting more than 90 minutes. Potassium works with sodium to maintain proper fluid balance and also helps to trigger the electrical impulses that signal the muscles to contract and relax.**\n\nAnother downside to excessive perspiration is the loss of fluids within the body. Proper hydration is essential to maintaining high levels of performance, particularly for those involved in athletic activities. Gatorade can provide significant quantities of water to help support hydration requirements while a person is involved in heavy physical activity. The osmality of Gatorade, the number of particles in solution, is slightly higher than that of blood. That, along with the electrolytes and carbohydrates in the drink, provide for rapid absorption, according to Gatorade.com.\n\n**Gatorade also contains a carbohydrates in the form of sucrose and dextrose, which are an essential fuel source for optimal muscle function during physical exertion. These simple carbohydrates break down easily within the body. According to Gatorade.com, the sports drink contains 14 g of carbohydrates per 8 oz. serving, offering a significant source of readily available food energy.**\n\nProbably the most common consequence of drinking too much Gatorade is weight gain. Each 32-oz. bottle of Gatorade has 200 calories. If an athlete burns fewer calories than that, the excess calories will be stored as fat, which will eventually lead to weight gain.\n\n**Gatorade is fortified with a variety of different vitamins and minerals, including some fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A. Fat-soluble vitamins cannot be excreted from the body when they are consumed in quantities too large, so side effects may occur. Drinking too much Gatorade, and consuming much more than your recommended amount of vitamin A, can lead to vitamin toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis A. The National Institutes of Health say that the symptoms of hypervitaminosis A include blurred vision, fatigue, headache and nausea.**\n\nOne bottle of Gatorade can have up to 800mg of sodium, which is 33 percent of your normal daily recommended intake. Drinking too much Gatorade, especially along with eating salty foods, may result in high blood pressure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that too much salt in the diet can lead to high blood pressure and eventually to health problems like heart attacks and strokes.\n\n**Gatorade contains high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup has been linked to obesity and metabolic conditions.**\n\nDrinking a single 20-oz. sports drink every day for a year could cause an individual to gain about 13 lbs., according to a report from the University of California at Berkley's Robert C. and Veronica Akins Center for Weight and Health.\n\n**Brominated vegetable oil can be found in Gatorade and is made by adding bromine to vegetable oil. It's patented as a flame retardant. But when used in drinks, its purpose is to prevent the oil from separating from the other drink ingredients. Because bromine is a halogen, it may displace iodine in the human body and may impair thyroid function. Case studies prior to 1975, when brominated sedatives were in use, indicated bromine may cause side effects that mimic psychosis and brain damage. These include depression, memory loss, hallucinations, violent tendencies, seizures, cerebral atrophy, acute irritability, tremors, ataxia, confusion, loss of peripheral vision, slurred speech, stupor, tendon reflex changes, photophobia due to enlarged pupils, and extensor plantar responses. Animal studies link bromide consumption to heart and kidney damage and fat deposits in those organs. In extreme cases, it's produced testicular damage, stunted growth, lethargy, and fatigue in animals.**\n\nA study conducted by the University of Iowa found that Gatorade erodes teeth faster than Coke, Diet Coke, Red Bull or 100 percent apple juice.\n\n**There are 56g of sugar in each regular sized bottle of Gatorade. Though replacing some sugars lost during exercise is generally a good idea, drinking too much sugar can lead to high blood sugar in the cells which can be very dangerous. Since every person is different, there is no one amount of sugar which is too much to consume for everybody. Some people, such as diabetics, may get high blood sugar from drinking even half of a bottle of Gatorade, while it may take several bottles to cause high blood sugar in others.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 8 fl oz or 240 ml (There are 4 servings in each bottle)\n\nCalories: 50\nTotal Fat: 0g\nSodium: 110mg/5% daily value\nPotassium: 30 mg/1% daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 14g/5%\nSugars: 14g\nProtein: 0g\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/68710-effects-much-gatorade/)\n\n[Resource 2](http://news.yahoo.com/pepsico-ditches-bvo-gatorade-still-drinking-215800296.html)\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.livestrong.com/article/259258-benefits-of-drinking-gatorade/)\n\n[Resource 4](http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/benefits-drinking-gatorade-16510.html)\n\n[Resource 5](http://www.ehow.com/facts_5483622_pros-cons-gatorade.html)\n\n[Resource 6](http://jahnvijp.wordpress.com/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en7ak/gatorade/", "created_utc": 1368989466.0, "score": 33, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en7ak/gatorade/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Tomatoes", "selftext": "Tomatoes are acidic vegetables, so eating too many of them can aggravate preexisting medical conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, also known as acid reflux -- a condition in which the digestive acids in your stomach rise and leak through the muscle acting as a valve between your stomach and esophagus, burning your esophagus. Tomatoes, especially in great quantities, can make this worse. According to the Mayo Clinic, the seeds in tomatoes can also aggravate diverticulitis, by lodging in the diverticula, small pouches formed in your digestive tract, causing inflammation and infection.\n\n**Numerous studies have concluded that the more tomatoes people eat the lower their risks of certain cancers, especially lung, stomach and prostate cancers.  A substance called lycopene, which is responsible for tomatoes red color, is thought to be the reason for this cancer protective effect. Processed tomatoes contain even more lycopene than raw ones. The process of cooking breaks down the cell walls, helping to release the lycopene. Eating tomatoes with a little bit of fat, such as olive oil, helps lycopene to be better absorbed by the body.**\n\nTomatoes can improve your vision. The vitamin A that tomatoes provide can improve vision and help prevent night blindness. Recent research shows that consuming tomatoes may help reduce the risk of macular degeneration, a serious and irreversible eye condition.\n\n**Tomatoes will make your hair look better.The vitamin A found in tomatoes works to make hair strong and shiny. (Sorry, tomatoes cannot help much with thinning hair\u2014but they will make the hair you have look better!)**\n\nTomatoes can help prevent kidney stones and gallstones. Some studies suggest that kidney and gall stones are less likely to form in people who eat tomatoes without the seeds.\n\n**Tomatoes can reduce chronic pain. If you are one of the millions of people who deal with mild to moderate chronic pain (such as from arthritis or back pain), tomatoes may be a pain-buster. Tomatoes are high in bioflavonoids and carotenoids, which are known anti-inflammatory agents. Chronic pain often involves chronic inflammation, so attacking the inflammation is a good way to fight the chronic pain.**\n\nTomatoes are high in important antioxidants such as vitamin C and Vitamin A. These vitamins work to fend of DNA damage from free radicals. Consequently, tomatoes may help to ward off age related diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes.\n\n**Tomatoes can help you lose weight. If you are on a sensible diet and exercise plan, build lots of tomatoes into your everyday eating. They make a great snack and can be used to \u201cbulk up\u201d salads, casseroles, sandwiches and other meals. Because tomatoes contain lots of water and fiber, they are what Weight Watchers calls a \u201cfilling food,\u201d one of those foods that fills you up fast without adding a lot of calories or fat.**\n\nTomatoes contain important nutrients, such as niacin, folate and vitamin B6, that have associated with the reduction of heart disease risk. One study found that women who ate 7 to 10 servings of tomato products per week had a 29 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than women who consumed less than a serving and a half of tomato products each week. Results were even more impressive when the women ate oil-rich tomato products.\n\n**Tomatoes build strong bones.The vitamin K and calcium in tomatoes are both very good for strengthening and repairing bones.\nLycopene also has been shown to improve bone mass, which is a great way to fight osteoporosis.**\n\nOne study showed that drinking 8 ounces of tomato juice daily reduced platelet aggregation significantly, among study subjects. Those drinking a placebo showed no benefit. It\u2019s important to drink low-sodium tomato juice if you are trying to protect against thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessel) , as high sodium levels can cause negative effects for this type of disease.\n\n**A double blind study found that drinking a glass of tomato juice a day can reduce blood levels of TNF-alpha by 34 percent. TNF-alpha causes inflammation. High levels have been found in individuals with most chronic, degenerative diseases such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis and Alzheimer\u2019s.**\n\nTomatoes are a natural cancer fighter. Lycopene can reduce the risk of several cancers, including prostate, cervical, mouth, pharynx, throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectal, prostate and ovarian cancer. Tomatoes\u2019 antioxidants (vitamins A and C) fight the free radicals which can cause cell damage.\n\n**Tomatoes can keep your blood sugar in balance. Tomatoes are a very good source of chromium, which helps to regulate blood sugar.**\n\nTomatoes make your skin look great. Beta-carotene helps protect skin against sun damage. Tomatoes\u2019 lycopene also makes skin less sensitive to UV light damage, a leading cause of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 small whole\n\nCalories: 16\nCalories from fat: 1\nTotal Fat: .2g\nSaturated Fat: 0g\nPolyunsaturated Fat: .1g\nSodium: 4mg\nTotal Carbohydrates: 3.5g (1% of daily value)\nDietary Fiber: 1.1g (4% of daily value)\nSugars: 2.4g\nProtein: .8g\nVitamin C: 32%\nIron: 8%\n\n*Links*: [Source 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/494705-side-effects-of-eating-too-many-tomatoes/)\n\n[Source 2](http://www.beliefnet.com/Health/9-Surprising-Health-Benefits-of-Tomatoes.aspx#)\n\n[Source 3](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/5-health-benefits-of-tomatoes.html#b)\n\n[Source 4](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110301091338.htm)\n\n[Source 5](http://voices.yahoo.com/top-5-health-benefits-eating-tomatoes-5649254.html?cat=5)\n\n[Source 6](http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-tomatoes-red-ripe-i11529)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en4gp/tomatoes/", "created_utc": 1368987145.0, "score": 30, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en4gp/tomatoes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Kale", "selftext": "Per calorie, kale has more iron than beef. Iron is essential for good health, such as the formation of hemoglobin and enzymes, transporting oxygen to various parts of the body, cell growth, proper liver function and more.\n\n**Eating a diet high in Vitamin K can help protect against various cancers. It is also necessary for a wide variety of bodily functions including normal bone health and the prevention of blood clotting. Also increased levels of vitamin K can help people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Eat More Kale!**\n\nEating more kale can help lower cholesterol levels.\n\n**Sick of spending money on anti-wrinkle creams? Eat more kale.  It's a superstar in the arena of carotenoids and flavonoids, two powerful antioxidants that protect our cells from free radicals that cause oxidative stress. With the addition of high doses of celebrity antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin A, and manganese, kale is a smart choice in the battle against cellular oxidation.**\n\nOne cup of kale provides about 10% of the RDA of omega-3 fatty acids that helps regulate the body\u2019s inflammatory process.  A megadose of vitamin K further aids to fight against excessive inflammatory-related problems, such as arthritis, autoimmune disorders, and asthma. Kale's whopping dose of vitamin K (there's 1327% of the RDA in one cup) is necessary for the synthesis of osteocalcin, a protein that strengthens the composition of our bones.\n\n**With over 192% of the RDA of vitamin A, one cup of kale keeps our eyesight sharp, is an effective antioxidant, boosts immunity, maintains healthy bones and teeth, prevents urinary stones, and is essential to our reproductive organs. Kale also has plenty of star anti-oxidant vitamin C, which lowers blood pressure, ensures a healthy immune system, and fights against age-related ocular diseases, such as cataracts and macular degeneration.**\n\nKale can be likened to the superhero of vegetables, especially green leafy ones. Deep green kale contains the highest levels of antioxidants of all vegetables. Kale's high content of flavonoids and antioxidants work together to prevent and even combat cancer, in particular colon, breast, bladder, prostate, ovarian cancers, and gastric cancer.\n\n**One cup of kale contains nearly 20% of the RDA of dietary fiber, which promotes regular digestion, prevents constipation, lowers blood sugar and curbs overeating. Kale contains the glucosinolate isothiocyanate (ITC) that fights the formation of H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori), a bacterial growth in the stomach lining that can lead to gastric cancer.**\n\nThe high fiber content of kale lowers our cholesterol by binding with bile acids that the liver produces from cholesterol for digesting fat. Because many of these bile acids are coupled with fiber, the liver is charged with producing more bile acid to digest fat, and therefore requires more cholesterol to so, ultimately lowering the amount of cholesterol within our bodies.\n\n**Per calorie, kale has more calcium than milk, which aids in preventing bone loss, preventing osteoporosis and maintaining a healthy metabolism. Vitamin C is also helpful to maintain cartilage and joint flexibility.**\n\nThe healthy balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids keep your body strong, healthy and beautiful from the inside out. Kale\u2019s concentration of major nutrients gives your skin\u2019s health and appearance a boost.\n\n\n**Avoid eating large amounts of kale on a daily basis (or juicing). Kale has been shown to have the ability to drastically change your thyroid.

Broccoli has anti-cancer agents such as glucoraphanin, beta-carotene, diindolylmethane, selenium and other nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, potassium, zinc and amino acids which are able to prevent the growth of cancer cells in the breast, uterus, prostate gland, intestine, kidney, liver and lungs.\n\n**Along with a high amount of potassium, Broccoli also contains magnesium and calcium that help regulate blood pressure.**\n\nOne cup of broccoli contains the RDA of vitamin C, an antioxidant necessary for fighting against free radicals. Moreover, vitamin C is an effective antihistamine for easing the discomfort of the common cold.\n\n**Broccoli contains high levels of both calcium and vitamin K, both of which are important for bone health and prevention of osteoporosis.**\n\nBroccoli is helpful in repairing skin damage thanks to the glucoraphanin it contains which helps the skin to detoxify and repair itself.\n\n**One cup of broccoli bolsters the immune system with a large dose of beta-carotene. Trace minerals, such as zinc and selenium, further act to strengthen immune defense actions.**\n\nBroccoli is high in fiber, which aids in digestion, prevents constipation, maintains low blood sugar, and curbs overeating. Furthermore, a cup of broccoli has as much protein as a cup of rice or corn with half the calories.\n\n**Studies have shown that the carotenoid lutein helps prevent age-related macular degeneration and cataracts, as well as possesses anti-cancer effects. Additionally, broccoli is a good source of vitamin A that is needed to form retinal, the light-absorbing molecule that is essential for both low-light and color vision.**\n\nThe carotenoid lutein may also slow down or prevent the thickening of arteries in the human body, thus fighting against heart disease and stoke. The B6 and folate in broccoli also reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, heart attack, and stroke.\n\n**Broccoli played a role in freeing the body from free radicals and toxins, and also prevents ulcers, itching, arthritis, kidney stones, rashes, gout and eczema.**\n\nIn pregnant period a women need the essential nutrients to maintaining growth fetus health.

{"title": "Bananas", "selftext": "EDIT - **TL;DR - PROS: Bananas help with alertness, blood sugar, nausea, fever, smoking withdrawal effects, stomach ulcers, acid reflux, digestion issues, swelling, anemia, low mood, sweet cravings, muscles in the heart and nervous system, calcium loss, and more. CONS: None.**\n\n*Pros*\n\nBananas make you smarter and help with learning by making you more alert. Eat a banana before an exam to benefit from the high levels of potassium.\n\n**Bananas are high in antioxidants, providing free radicals and protection from chronic disease.**\n\nEating a banana between meals helps stabilize blood sugar and reduce nausea from morning sickness.\n\n**Control blood sugar and avoid binging between meals by eating a banana.**\n\nEating a banana can lower the body temperature and cool you during a fever or on a hot day.\n\n**Quitting smoking? Bananas contain high levels of B-vitamins as well as potassium and magnesium speed recovery from the effects of withdrawal.**\n\nBananas are the only raw fruit that can be consumed without distress to relieve stomach ulcers by coating the lining of the stomach against corrosive acids.\n\n**Bananas are a natural antacid, providing relief from acid reflux, heartburn and GERD.**\n\nGot the runs? Bananas are soothing to the digestive tract and help restore lost electrolytes after diarrhea.\n\n**Constipated? High fiber in bananas can help normalize bowel motility.**\n\nBananas act as a prebiotic, stimulating the growth of friendly bacteria in the bowel. They also produce digestive enzymes to assist in absorbing nutrients.\n\n**Rich in pectin, bananas aid digestion and gently chelate toxins and heavy metals from the body**\n\nStrengthen your blood and relieve anemia with the added iron from bananas\n\n**Bananas reduce swelling, protect against type II diabetes, aid weight loss, strengthen the nervous system, and help with the production of white blood cells, all due to high levels of vitamin B-6**\n\nBananas contain a natural mood enhancer, tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts to serotonin. Serotonin is known to make the body feel relaxed and improves good mood thus preventing seasonal depression.\n\n**Because of their great taste, they can also serve as a substitute for sweets to satisfy sugar cravings. The convenience and nutritional value of bananas make them good post-exercise snack. During long exercises, bananas can give the immediate energy you need.**\n\nBananas contain a high dose of potassium - an essential ingredient to keep your heart and nervous system in good shape. Potassium is essential for proper muscle contraction and hence plays an important role in muscle-influenced activities including: the normal rhythmic pumping of the heart, digestion, muscular movements, etc., Some studies have also linked low potassium intake to high blood pressure and increased risk of stroke.\n\n**Benefits to the kidneys and the bones are again due to the high potassium content of bananas. A normal intake of potassium suppresses calcium excretion in the urine and minimizes the risk of kidney stones. Also, for the same reason (suppressing of calcium excretion), it minimizes the loss of calcium from the body and thereby reduces the risk of osteoporosis.**\n\nBananas are one of the highest sources of naturally available vitamin B6: Vitamin B6 plays an important role in converting tryptophan to serotonin (read #3 above), and also helps the body to make hemoglobin - a crucial ingredient of your blood. Vitamin B6 is also essential for antibody production and to maintain a healthy immune response. It also helps to convert carbohydrates to glucose and thereby maintains proper blood sugar levels. A medium banana can take care of 1/5 of your daily recommended intake of vitamin B6 and is one of the easiest (and cheapest) ways to increase your dietary intake of the vitamin .\n\n**A single serving (one medium-sized banana) contains 16% of the daily recommended dietary fiber intake for a normal adult - that\u2019s substantial for a single serving of any food.

In short, the study suggested that milk may help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, as well as help lower blood pressure.\n\n**Whole milk has a great combination of sugar, carbs and protein and contributes to post-exercise muscle synthesis and re-hydration, as well as aiding in post-exercise soreness.**\n\nA 2017 review of 13 clinical trials on dairy consumption in the journal Clinical Nutrition found that having 500mL per day of dairy was associated with decreased appetite and desire to eat, while increasing satiety.\n\n**Milk helps exercise buffs burn more fat. In a recent study, the milk drinking group came out on top in terms of muscle gain with an estimated 40 per cent or 2.5 pounds more muscle mass than the soy beverage drinkers. In addition, this group gained 63 per cent or 3.3 pounds, more muscle mass than the carbohydrate beverage drinkers.**\n\nPeople who eat a lot of high-fat dairy products actually have the lowest incidence of diabetes, according to a 2015 study of 26,930 people in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Those who ate a lot of low-fat dairy products, on the other hand, had the highest incidence. The researchers speculated that while calcium, protein, vitamin D and other nutrients in yogurt are indeed good for us, we need the fat that goes along with them in order to get their protective effects.\n\n**Whole milk can improve blood pressure and diminish the effects of coronary artery disease.**\n\nMilk is an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and fatty acids, and it helps slow down the absorption of sugar and carbohydrates, leading to consistent energy levels and improved brain function.\n\n**Milk has been linked to causing acne.\u00a0The proteins in milk \u2014 whey and casein \u2014 stimulate growth and hormones. They also release something called IGF-1, a hormone that mimics insulin, and is a catalyst for dreaded breakouts. It's also believed that if you are lactose intolerant, and find your face popping with pimples, it could actually be an allergic reaction.**\n\nMilk has been shown to help lower cholesterol.\n\n**Milk has been proved to relax the body and reduce the negative effects that women experience during their menstrual cycle.**\n\nThere are many foods that contain acids that cause people to experience heartburn. One of the simplest \u2013 and yummiest \u2013 ways to alleviate this pain is drinking a glass of milk. The cooling sensation and the thick consistency of milk helps to coat the esophagus and stomach lining to prevent heartburn.\n\n**Drinking milk can improve eyesight.**\n\nMilk has been shown to be a disease fighter, helping reduce the risk of developing certain forms of cancer.\n\n**Drinking too much milk may still have its negative effects.

{"title": "Spinach", "selftext": "The flavonoids and antioxidants found in spinach, particularly the antioxidant beta-carotene, have been shown in multiple studies to help combat many cancers, including breast, prostate and ovarian cancer. \n\n**A recent study found a bowl of spinach every day increases muscle efficiency. Researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found participants who consumed 300 grams of spinach a day reduced the amount of oxygen required to power their muscles while exercising by five per cent. The effect was noticable after just three days of spinach consumption.**\n\nSpinach may reduce the risk of skin cancer, according to researchers from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research. Researchers found green leafy vegetables such as spinach and silverbeet are linked with a  reduction in the risk of skin cancer, particularly among those with a previous history of the disease.\n\n**Spinach is high in oxalic acid, which can bind with iron and calcium and cause your body to absorb less of these nutrients. Consuming foods rich in vitamin C, such as tomatoes, capsicum, lemon juice or orange juice along with spinach can aid this absorption. Spinach is high in fibre, but too much of it can cause digestive problems such as bloating, gas and cramping.**\n\nSpinach is also associated with an increased risk of kidney stones, but only in people who are predisposed to the condition.\n\n**Spinach leaves hold a good amount of soluble dietary fiber and green spinach is one of the finest vegetable sources recommended in cholesterol controlling and weight reduction programs.**\n\nFresh 100 g of spinach contains about 25% of daily intake of iron; one of the richest among green leafy vegetables. Iron is an important trace element required by the human body for red blood cell production and as a co-factor for oxidation-reduction enzyme, cytochrome-oxidase during the cellular metabolism.\n\n**Fresh leaves are rich source of several vital anti-oxidant vitamins like vitamin A, vitamin C, and flavonoid poly phenolic antioxidants such as lutein, zea-xanthin and beta-carotene. Together, these compounds help act as protective scavengers against oxygen-derived free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a healing role in aging and various disease processes.**\n\nSpinach contains a considerable amount of vitamin A. vitamin A is essential for maintaining normal eye-sight.\n\n**Spinach leaves are an excellent source of vitamin K. 100 g of fresh greens provides 402% of daily vitamin-K requirements. Vitamin K plays a vital role in strengthening the bone mass by promoting osteotrophic (bone building) activity in the bone.**\n\nThis green leafy vegetable also contains good amounts of many B-complex vitamins such as vitamin-B6 (pyridoxine), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin, folates and niacin. Folates help prevent neural tube defects in the offspring.\n\n**Spinach leaves also contain a good amount of minerals like potassium, manganese, magnesium, copper and zinc. Potassium is an important component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and blood pressure. Manganese and copper are used by the body as a co-factor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase. Copper is required in the production of red blood cells. Zinc is a co-factor for many enzymes that regulate growth and development, sperm generation, digestion and nucleic acid synthesis.**\n\nRegular consumption of spinach in the diet helps prevent osteoporosis (weakness of bones), iron-deficiency anemia. Moreover, its soft leaves are believed to protect human body from cardiovascular diseases and cancers of colon and prostate.\n\n**A common, but harmless, side effect of eating spinach is feeling as though your teeth are gritty or slimy. This is caused by the oxalic acid found in spinach. Oxalic acid contains small crystals that do not dissolve in water. The grit is harmless and can be removed easily by brushing your teeth.**\n\nSpinach is high in dietary fiber; a cup of cooked spinach contains 6 g of fiber. Although your body needs fiber to promote proper digestion, eating too much fiber at once can contribute to stomach upset. You may experience gas, bloating and cramping after eating spinach. Eat a large amount of spinach all at once, and you may experience some diarrhea. If you have recently increased the fiber in your diet, your body will eventually adjust and you will experience less stomach pain as you continue to eat high-fiber foods. Try drinking a full glass of water every time you eat spinach to help your body better process the fiber.\n\n**Avoid eating large amounts of spinach on a daily basis (or juicing). Spinach has been shown to have the ability to drastically change your thyroid. If you already have thyroid problems, hypothyroidism in particular, you should talk with your doctor on how much spinach and other cruciferous vegetables you should be eating.**\n\n\n***[Nutritional Facts](http://imgur.com/bSvVbgK)***\n\nLinks: [Resource 1](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=43)\n\n\n[Resource 2](http://urbanext.illinois.edu/veggies/spinach.cfm)\n\n\n[Resource 3](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3214)\n\n\n[Resource 4](http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/spinach.html)\n\n\n[Resource 5](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=spinach)\n\n\n[Resource 6](http://home.howstuffworks.com/spinach3.htm)\n\n\n[Resource 7](http://www.livestrong.com/article/411787-side-effects-of-spinach/)\n\n\n[Resource 8](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/hypothyroidism)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gpdhr/spinach/", "created_utc": 1410992954.0, "score": 22, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gpdhr/spinach/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Additionally, its rich fiber content also helps protect from colon polyps and cancer.**\n\nIf you eat all of the flesh -- but none of the skin -- of an average-sized baked potato, you\u2019ll get about 145 calories, 3 grams of protein, 34 grams of mostly complex carbohydrates and significant amounts of potassium, vitamin C, vitamin B-6, niacin and thiamine. For about another 15 calories, eating the skin provides you with an extra gram of protein, another 3 grams of carbohydrates and more of most of the vitamins and minerals found in the vegetable\u2019s flesh. Potato skins are particularly rich in iron and potassium -- according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Nutrient Database, an average-sized whole baked potato is approximately 70 percent higher in iron and 35 percent higher in potassium than a peeled one.\n\n**A baked potato served without skin falls short of qualifying as a good source of dietary fiber, with just over 2 grams per average-sized specimen. The root vegetable\u2019s skin is a much better source of these beneficial, indigestible carbohydrates -- an ounce of potato skin delivers more than five times as much fiber as an ounce of potato flesh, according to the USDA National Nutrient Database. You\u2019ll get close to 4 grams of fiber from a whole, average-sized baked potato, or right around 15 percent of the recommended daily value. Whole potatoes are especially rich in insoluble fiber, the kind that stimulates digestion and promotes bowel regularity.**\n\nPotatoes can contain Acrylamide. Acrylamide has been shown to cause cancer in lab animals, but we don't know what levels of acrylamide exposures are dangerous for humans. Frying and baking potatoes at high temperatures for a long time result in the highest levels of acrylamide, but those levels may be reduced when potatoes are boiled first or treated with antioxidant solutions.\n\n**Potatoes are considered a starchy vegetable because they\u2019re rich in complex carbohydrates. Compared to those found in whole grains, beans and other vegetables, the complex carbohydrates in peeled potatoes are more readily broken down into simple sugars and absorbed into the bloodstream, which is why they tend to cause blood glucose levels to rise more rapidly than other starchy foods. The extra fiber obtained by eating the vegetable\u2019s skin -- a fair amount of which is soluble -- helps mitigate this effect. Soluble fiber keeps digested food in your stomach longer and slows the rate at which simple sugars enter your bloodstream.**\n\nPoatoes that have green skin can contain Solanine. Research shows that solanine may adversely affect the cells that make up the lining of the intestines and can irritate inflammatory bowel disorders. To avoid solanine, don't buy potatoes that have green skin and store them in a dark place in your pantry or kitchen.\n\n\n**Potato skins contain an anti-carcinogenic compound called chlorogenic acid. This particular acid helps the fiber in potatoes absorb carcinogens that are found in grilled foods. Eating potatoes with grilled foods is common and important when preserving health and fighting off cancer-causing substances.**\n\n\nPotatoes can help lower blood pressure.\n\n**If potatoes are cooked by healthy cooking methods then they are good for your heart. Vitamin B6 in potatoes help to lower homocysteine levels and help lower risk of heart disease or heart attack.**\n\n\n***[Nutritional Facts](http://imgur.com/ChnBL95)***\n\nLinks: [Resource 1](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/acrylamide-in-food)\n\n\n[Resource 2](http://www.potatogoodness.com/nutrition/)\n\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/potato.aspx)\n\n\n[Resource 4](http://nationalpotatocouncil.org/)\n\n\n[Resource 5](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3137)\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gnk1e/potatoes/", "created_utc": 1410957098.0, "score": 15, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2gnk1e/potatoes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Kimchi", "selftext": "Some doctors have shown that with increased consumption there is evidence that kimchi might also increase the risk of stomach cancer. Scientists have identified some potential carcinogens in the food, but not at extremely high levels. This has led some doctors to suggest that kimchi is fine when eaten in moderation, along with a regular diet of fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n**Regular consumption of kimchi has a beneficial effect on the levels of cholesterol. Garlic which is used to prepare kimchi is rich in selenium and allicin. Allicin is an eminent component which helps in lowering the cholesterol levels thereby, reducing the risk of developing cardiac disorders such as strokes and heart attacks. Selenium also exerts a protective effect on the artery walls by preventing the build-up of plaque and decreasing the threat of disorders like atherosclerosis. An investigative study has advocated that fermented kimchi helps in lowering the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol along with the concentrations blood glucose in the body.**\n\nAccording to medical reports, kimchi is an excellent food to promote healthy digestion. It is a source of probiotics attributing to the process of fermentation involved in its preparation. The process of fermentation of kimchi not only enhances the taste but also creates healthy bacteria, Lactobacillus which is required by the body to keep a healthy state of intestinal flora. Kimchi  is made from cabbage which is already well known for its detoxification qualities and helps the body in getting rid of the wastes and toxins. It aids in cleaning up the intestines and stimulates better assimilation of nutrients in the body. Fiber content present in kimchi also assists in stabilizing the bowel movements and prevents constipation.\n\n**Kimchi is a valuable food which helps in reducing the risk of development of various cancers. A study performed on kimchi samples has validated its anti-cancer properties. Cabbage present in kimchi contains healthful flavonoids which are known to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Another powerful cancer fighters present in cruciferous such as cabbage are glucosinolates. Glucosinolates break down to form isothiocyanates which are well known for their effectiveness against the cancer growth.**\n\nThe presence of lactobacillus bacteria in kimchi makes it a multi-talented condiment. It extends its therapeutic effects on various skin ailments such as atopic dermatitis which is characterized by increased levels of immunoglobulin E and skin lesion such as edema and hemorrhage. A study conducted in this regard has shown that healthy bacteria present in fermented kimchi exerts suppressive effects on the mite-induced dermatitis and helps in reducing the inflammation.\n\n**As already stated, kimchi is a source of healthy lactobacillus bacteria which the body utilizes for its healthy functioning. This good bacterium also assists in weight loss by controlling the appetite and reducing the blood sugar levels. The fiber content present in kimchi keeps your body full and hunger satisfied for a longer duration preventing you from frequent and over eating. A study conducted on obese patients has validated the favorable effects of fermented kimchi on the body with respect to body mass index, body fat which helps in reducing the development of factors implicated in metabolic syndrome.**\n\nThe multi-nutrient packed kimchi is rich in a range of flavonoids and phenolic components. The variety of ingredients including ginger, garlic, peppers involved in the preparations of kimchi are super protectors which are renowned for their beneficial effect on the immune system. They help in fighting infections and are valuable in curing cold and flu symptoms.\n\n**Another valuable benefit provided by kimchi is its anti-aging qualities which attributes to the presence of antioxidants and vitamin C. A study evaluating the anti-aging activity of kimchi has revealed that kimchi helps in regulating and attenuating the inflammation that speeds up the aging process. The same study has also shown promising results with regard to factors like reduced oxidative stress in the cells, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and extended life span in the subjects making kimchi a potent anti-aging component.**\n\nKimchi is beneficial in diabetes. A study conducted on high-fat diet-fed type-2 diabetic subjects who were given kimchi revealed the anti-diabetic properties of the Korean delicacy. The study showed better glucose tolerance and lower levels of fasting glucose after eating kimchi-containing diet in the diabetic subjects.  The same study also suggested that kimchi can prove more useful in diabetes if it is eaten with normal or low-fat diet instead of high-fat food. \n\n**Individuals suffering from high blood pressure should be cautious while eating kimchi because of the presence of high salt concentration which gets further accentuated during the fermentation process. However, a study conducted on hypertensive subjects revealed that even under the conditions of hypertension, eating low-sodium kimchi may not exert harmful effects on the blood pressure and cardiac activities.**   \n\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 282g\nCalories: 96\nCalories from Fat: 10\nTotal Fat: 1g (2% of daily value)\nSaturated Fat: 0.g (0% of daily value)\nCholesterol 0mg: (0% of daily value)\nSodium: 2206mg (92% of daily value)\t \nTotal Carbohydrate: 20g (7% of daily value)\nDietary Fiber 2g: (10% of daily value)\nSugars: 1g\t \nProtein: 3g\n\n\nVitamin A: 45% of daily value\nVitamin C: 21% of daily value\nCalcium: 6% of daily value\nIron: 1% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.kscpp.net/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Tpm6kbNBiWE%3D&tabid=140&mid=498)\n\n[Resource 2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24456350)\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09333.html)\n\n[Resource 4](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09354.html)\n\nResource 5](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/vitamin-a-retinol)\n\n[Resource 6](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002404.htm)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2a59ei/kimchi/", "created_utc": 1404830032.0, "score": 17, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/2a59ei/kimchi/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "\"Copious amounts of Jolly Ranchers\" aka: Sugar and Sugar", "selftext": "A copious amount of Jolly Ranchers is pretty much all just sugar. So, I will be looking at the health benefits of Sugar below, and I will also try another way of writing up these.  Let me know if you perfer point by point or this way:\n\n\nSugar, for all its faults, does have benefits.  Unlike protein or fat, sugar's energy is more readily available to be converted to energy (ATP in the case of the human body).  When entering our bloodstream, it converts into glucose, which besides being the simplest sugar, is the type your cells most easily absorb and use.  Sugar, in moderate amounts, is essential to mood and your brain.  And while it warrants more testing, Sugar Therapy for injuries has been shown to promote healing (Sugar is hydroscopic and if we remember from Honey, that means that it will pull water out of substances, which in this case means bacteria.)\n\n\nBut onto the oft-reported negatives of sugar.  The largest issue with sugar (remember that im talking in regards to pure sugar/candies like Jolly Ranchers), is the lack of other nutrients.  Yes, eating  a chocolate bar isnt healthy, but at least you're gaining the benefits that chocolates bring.  Sugar has no; nutrients, protein, healthy fats, enzymes.  It gets absorbed by the body so fast that it doesn't satiate nearly as much as Fats or proteins do, since they take longer to be digested.  Combine this with the positive \"high\" that sugar gives (Sugar has been shown to raise mood.) and we reach a feedback loop of sugar consumption equating to happiness, which in turn causes the body to crave more.   To quote a source (which will be listed below, and lists PR studies as sources).  Sugar is also loved by acid-producing mouth bacteria, which cause damage to your teeth.\n\n>Stresses the Liver: \u201cWhen we eat fructose, it goes to the liver. If liver glycogen is low, such as after a run, the fructose will be used to replenish it (3).However, most people aren\u2019t consuming fructose after a long workout and their livers are already full of glycogen. When this happens, the liver turns the fructose into fat (2). Some of the fat gets shipped out, but part of it remains in the liver. The fat can build up over time and ultimately lead to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (4, 5, 6).\u201d\n\n>Increases Bad Cholesterol and Triglycerides (source)\n\n>Can contribute to Leptin Resistance (and then weight gain, cravings, sleep trouble, etc) \u2013 source\n\n>Creates an addictive sugar response in the brain (source)\n\n>Doesn\u2019t fill you up and instead encourages you to eat more\n\nOverall, mass consumption of sugar is a massively detremental thing for your everyday person, on the level of cigarette smoking.\n\nI'll end with a fact:  One chemical is  C^12 H^22 O^11. , and another is C^17 H^21 NO^4 .

{"title": "Honey", "selftext": "* **Honey as an anti-bacterial**:  Perhaps the most common of the things attributed to honey is its anti-bacterial/fungal properties.  This is mainly due to honey being very acidic (average ph of 4.75) and its high Osmolarity (High sugar content).  Most cells need a very balanced ph to survive and also need water to as well.  Honey has such a high Osmolarity that it literally sucks the water out of the bacterial cell and causes it to shrivel up and die. In lab experiments, it has been shown that honey can be effective against MRSA, although this hasnt been repeated in human trials, as well as also being effective again H. Pylori (a major cause of Stomach Ulcers).  It is also due to these two features that allows honey to remain shelf-stable for an extremely long time (if stored right, for 1000's of years.\"\n\n* **Honey to reduce allergies**:  Honey may help some people with allergies, but as a general allergy prevention method, it fails for a couple reasons.  Most allergies are caused by windborne allergens, which bees do not carry.  The other side is that even if it were to work, the acids of your stomach would break down the honey, rendering any benefits null.  There are some studies however that show that honey may relieve a runny nose, which segues to....\n\n* **Honey vs. the common cold**: Honey has been shown in studies to beat out Dextromethorphan in easing night-time coughing in children.  This has not been replicated in adults however, but the results are expected to be similar.\n\n* **Honey and Diabetes**:  Although some people may play into honey being more natural and healthier than regular sugar, in truth its still a sugar and to diabetes, a sugar is a sugar...... Honey is still sugar in the end, which a lot of people somewhat seem to gloss over.  Consuming too much honey, just like just about any other food can be bad for you.  However, there is a darker side to honey\n\n* ** The dark side to honey**: Infant Botulism. While giving an infant honey would be a great thing, it may contain Clostridium Botulinum which causes Botulism (2070ng or 2.07mcg is the average LD50 if inhaled by the average adult male, so we're talking orders of magnitude less if consumed by an infant).  Any health benefits given from honey can be replicated throught breast feeding and as such, * **DO NOT GIVE INFANTS HONEY**\n\nIf any clarification is needed, feel free to post or respond.

{"title": "Green Peas", "selftext": "Peas contain phytosterols especially \u00df-sitosterol. Studies suggest that vegetables like legumes, fruits and cereals rich in plant sterols help lower cholesterol levels in the body.\n\n**Excessive inflammation and oxidative stress are risk factors not only for the development of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, but also for the development of cancers. A recent research study has begun to examine the benefits of green peas with respect to one particular type of cancer\u2014stomach cancer. Stomach cancer (also called gastric cancer) is a disease that occurs more commonly in persons who have very low intake of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients, including key nutrients called polyphenols. A recent study based in Mexico City has shown that daily consumption of green peas along with other legumes is associated with decreased risk of stomach cancer. In particular, decreased risk of stomach cancer in this study was associated with average daily intake of a polyphenol called coumestrol at a level of 2 milligrams or higher. Pulses (including green peas) were determined to be a key food contributor to coumestrol in this Mexico-based study. Since one cup of green peas contains at least 10 milligrams of coumestrol, green peas are very likely to provide some unique health benefits in this cancer-prevention area. Of course, coumestrol is not the only cancer-protective nutrient present in green peas! The wide variety of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients in green peas is very likely to play a primary role in the cancer-preventive benefits of this food.**\n\nGarden peas are also good in vitamin K. 100 g of fresh leaves contains about 21% of daily requirement of vitamin K-1 (phylloquinone). Vitamin K has found to have a potential role in bone mass building function by promoting osteo-trophic activity in the bone. It also has established role in Alzheimer's disease patients by limiting neuronal damage in the brain.\n\n**Green peas help regulate blood sugar levels.**\n\nThe many antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds within peas support healthy blood vessels. The formation of plaque along our blood vessel walls starts with chronic, excessive oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\n**The generous amounts of vitamin B1 and folate, B2, B3, and B6  in green peas help to reduce homocysteine levels  which are  risk factor for heart disease.**\n\nGreen peas are loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients, and these health-supportive nutrients are provided in a wide range of nutrient categories. For example, in the flavonoid category, green peas provide us with the antioxidants catechin and epicatechin. In the carotenoid category, they offer alpha-carotene and beta-carotene. Their phenolic acids include ferulic and caffeic acid. Their polyphenols include coumestrol. Pisumsaponins I and II and pisomosides A and B are anti-inflammatory phytonutrients found almost exclusively in peas. Antioxidant vitamins provided by green peas include vitamin C and vitamin E, and a good amount of the antioxidant mineral zinc is also found in this amazing food. Yet another key anti-inflammatory nutrient needs to be added to this list, and that nutrient is omega-3 fat. Recent research has shown that green peas are a reliable source of omega-3 fat in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). In one cup of green peas, you can expect to find about 30 milligrams of ALA. Although large-scale studies on green pea intake and these chronic health problems remain unavailable, researchers have already begun to suggest connections in this area, particularly with respect to type 2 diabetes. We know that chronic, unwanted inflammation and chronic, unwanted oxidative stress increase our risk of type 2 diabetes. We also know that intake of green peas is associated with lowered risk of type 2 diabetes, even though this association has traditionally been understood to involve the strong fiber and protein content of green peas. Researchers now believe that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients in greens peas play an equally important role in lowering our risk of this chronic health problem.\n\n**Fresh green peas also contain adequate amounts of anti-oxidants flavonoids such as carotenes, lutein and zea-xanthin as well as vitamin-A (provide 765 IU or 25.5% of RDA per 100 g). Vitamin A is an essential nutrient required for maintaining health of mucus membranes, skin and eye-sight. Further, consumption of natural fruits rich in flavonoids helps to protect from lung and oral cavity cancers.**\n\nIn addition to folates, peas are also good in many other essential B-complex vitamins such as pantothenic acid, niacin, thiamin, and pyridoxine. Furthermore, they are rich source of many minerals such as calcium, iron, copper, zinc, and manganese.\n\n**Peas are relatively low in calories on comparison with beans, and cowpeas. 100 g of green peas provide only 81 calories, and no cholesterol. Nonetheless, the legumes are a good source of proteins, and soluble as well as insoluble fiber.**\n\nFresh pea pods are excellent source of folic acid. 100 g provides 65 \u00b5g or 16% of recommended daily levels of folates. Folates are B-complex vitamins required for DNA synthesis inside the cell. Well established research studies suggest that adequate folate rich foods in expectant mothers would help prevent neural tube defects in the newborn babies.\n\n**Fresh green peas are very good in ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Vitamin C is a powerful natural water-soluble anti-oxidant. Vegetables rich in this vitamin helps body develop resistance against infectious agents and scavenge harmful, pro-inflammatory free radicals from the body.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (145g)\nCalories: 117\nCalories from Fat: 5\nTotal Fat: 1g 1% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 0g\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 7mg 0% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 21g 7% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 7g 30% of daily value\nSugars: 8g\nProtein: 8g\nVitamin A: 22% of daily value\nCalcium: 4% of daily value\nVitamin C: 97% of daily value\nIron: 12% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=55)\n[Resource 2](http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/green-peas.html)\n[Resource 3](http://realfoodforlife.com/10-health-benefits-of-peas/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033)\n[Resource 5](http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/HQ01212)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2520/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f6to5/green_peas/", "created_utc": 1369729785.0, "score": 21, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f6to5/green_peas/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Cheddar specifically ripens first with lactic acid bacteria, allowing for conversion of lactose into lactic acid (Which is great if you are lactose intolerant!). The curds that form after are filtered of whey protein and set to a pH of about 6.4. After this, it is salted to about 1-3%, packaged and pressed, and then aged for a period of time[^2]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(09%2970500-4/abstract),[^3]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(08%2971439-5/abstract). \nThe biggest difference between light cheddar and cheddar in general is saturated fat content(As well as some differences in cholesterol and calcium content). One study has found that flavor is affected from this difference as well, due to distinct ripening biochemistry pathways[^4]( http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(10%2900547-3/abstract) .

{"title": "Coffee", "selftext": "***Health Benefits of Coffee***\n\n* Consumption reduces the risk of Gout ^[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22712/abstract) \n\n* Coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant which helps to reduce pain caused by migraines/headaches. As with Teas, over-consumption of caffeine can cause headaches, sleep issues and anxiety. \n\n* While the process are still unclear as to what causes it, Coffee has been shown to cause a decrease in Cirrhosis of the liver and of hepatocellular carcinoma (A liver cancer commonly found in patients suffering from Cirrhosis).  A study by Harvard Medical School showed a 50% risk reduction in liver cancer among coffee drinkers\n\n* Coffee has been shown to reduce the risk of  oral, esophageal, and pharyngeal cancer.  \n\n*  Coffee has been shown to reduce risk of and the mortality rate of Heat Failure and of Cardiovascular disease.  A study has shown in Japanese men that coffee has an inverse relationship between Triglycerides and blood pressure, and the consumption of coffee.  However, this could not be duplicated in women.\n\n* It is also shown to be a powerful stimulant for peristalsis, causing food and waste to be moved through the digestive tract.  **Research has shown that moderate consumption of coffee does not act as a diuretic, as current evidence shows the body treats it no differently from normal water/ non-caffeinated beverages.** \n\n*  Coffee is a powerful antioxidant, with the espresso extracrion method showing the highest activity. \n\n* Tannins found in Coffee have been shown to reduce the rate of dental cavaties, due in part to it interfering in the glucosyltransferase activity of m. streptococci.  \n\n***Health Risks***\n\n*As it is a stimulant, caffeine in coffee can become addicting, leading to withdrawl symptoms such as anxiety and decreased alertness\n\n* While praised as reducing cancer risks, 19 carcinogenic compounds are found in roasted coffee.  A weak positive relation between bladder cancer and coffee consumption has been found.  Instant coffee has a higher amount of these compounds compared to other brewing methods.\n\n* Coffee can cause the inflammation of the stomach lining and ulcers, so people who are at risk should keep consumption low.\n\n* The tannins in coffee, like tea, cause issues with iron and folic acid absorbtion.  Coupled with the fact that the chemicals in coffee stay in a fetus' body 10 times as long as the mothers, coffee shouldn't be consumed while pregnant. \n\n* 5+ cups of coffee a day has been linked to coronary heart disease.  (This is an oversimplification and to go into all of the research would probably a thread in and of itself.  \n\n* Consuming caffeine with acetomenaphine (Tylenol) can cause liver damage\n\n* Another thing coffee contains is acrylamide, a compound which in animal studies has been shown to be a neurotoxin. Effect in humans is unclear, and since it it's commonly found in high levels in fried starches, it is abundant. Food regulatory agencies do not know how to handle this potential toxin so it is often ignored and most are ignorant of it. (Credit for this addition goes to u/omicr0n .)\n\n***Decaf vs. regular coffee***\nDecaf is a misnomer as it does contain a minute amount of caffeine (5mg vs. 150-160 mg).\n  Decaf is as the name says, coffee without caffeine.  Removing this removes most of the benefits of caffeine, but also removes the downsides to it.  The one area where the two types differ is that decaf causes a small change in blood lipids as where coffee does not. Aside from this small thing, the two a virtually identical.    \n\n***Nutritional Info***\n\n\n* Calories- 2  \n* Fat- 0.05g\n* Sodium- 5 mg\n* Carbs- 0.25g\n* Sugar-0g \n* Protein-0.25g\n\n***Links***\n\n[Studies in the resources part]\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_of_coffee#Caffeine_and_analgesics)\n\n[Comparison of Decaf to regular]\n(http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/food/article/decaf-healthy-choice)\n\n[Nutritional Info]\n(http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/3898/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f33h5/coffee/", "created_utc": 1369584407.0, "score": 108, "author": "Woefinder", "num_comments": 35, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f33h5/coffee/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Oats", "selftext": "The soluble fiber in oats absorb a considerable amount of water and when made into oatmeal significantly slows down your digestive process. This result is that you'll feel full longer, i.e. oatmeal can help you control your weight.\n\n**Oats are a very good source of selenium. A necessary cofactor of the important antioxidant, glutathione peroxidase, selenium works with vitamin E in numerous vital antioxidant systems throughout the body. These powerful antioxidant actions make selenium helpful in decreasing asthma symptoms and in the prevention of heart disease. In addition, selenium is involved in DNA repair and is associated with a reduced risk for cancer, especially colon cancer.**\n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL, the \"bad\" cholesterol) is reduced without adverse effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol), or triglyceride concentrations.\n\n**Type 2 diabetes patients given foods high in this type of oat fiber or given oatmeal or oat bran rich foods experienced much lower rises in blood sugar compared to those who were given white rice or bread. Starting out your day with a blood sugar stabilizing food such as oats may make it easier to keep blood sugar levels under control the rest of the day, especially when the rest of your day is also supported with nourishing fiber-rich foods.**\n\nResearch suggests that regular consumption of oats also reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is because oats and other whole grains are a rich source of magnesium, a mineral that acts as a co-factor for more than 300 enzymes, including enzymes involved in the body's use of glucose and insulin secretion.\n\n**Beta-glucan which can be found in oats, significantly enhances the human immune system's response to bacterial infection. Beta-glucan not only helps neutrophils (the most abundant type of non-specific immune cell) navigate to the site of an infection more quickly, it also enhances their ability to eliminate the bacteria they find there.**\n\nStudies have found that when children eat oats it can decrease their chance of developing asthma.\n\n**Although treatment of celiac disease has been thought to require lifelong avoidance of the protein gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley and oats, recent studies of adults have shown that oats, despite the small amount of gluten they contain, are well-tolerated. Now, a double blind, multi-center study involving 8 clinics treating 116 children newly diagnosed celiac disease suggests oats are a good grain choice for children with celiac disease as well. The children were randomly assigned to receive either the standard gluten-free diet (no wheat, barley, rye or oats) or a gluten-free diet with some wheat-free oat products. At the end of the study, which ran for a year, all the children were doing well, and in both groups, the mucosal lining of the small bowel (which is damaged by wheat gluten in celiac disease) had healed and the immune system (which is excessively reactive in celiac patients) had returned to normal.**\n\nConsuming oats can provide favorable changes in the physical characteristics of LDL cholesterol particles, making them less susceptible to oxidation (oxidation is thought to lead to hardening of the arteries.)\n\n**Studies have shown that when postmenopausal women ate oats it slowed the progression of atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaque that narrows the vessels through which blood flows. Eating oats also was shown to lessen the progression in stenosis, the narrowing of the diameter of arterial passageways.**\n\nWhen women consume oats it greatly decreases their chance of developing breast cancer.\n\n**Oats are on the short list for the highest protein levels of any grain.**\n\nThe only real negative side effect is that eating oats can cause gas and bloating.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (156g)\nCalories: 607\nCalories from Fat: 90\nTotal Fat: 11g 17% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 2g 9% of daily value\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 3mg\nTotal Carbohydrate: 103g 34% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 17g 66% of daily value\nSugars: 0g\nProtein: 26g\nCalcium: 8% of daily value\nIron: 41% of daily value\n\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080108102225.htm)\n[Resource 2](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100216/Eat-heart-healthy-oats-to-prevent-atherosclerosis.aspx)\n[Resource 3](http://www.healthcastle.com/oats-cholesterol.shtml)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=54)\n[Resource 5](http://www.livestrong.com/article/494189-what-are-the-benefits-of-eating-oatmeal-every-morning/)\n[Resource 6](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-814-OATS.aspx?activeIngredientId=814&activeIngredientName=OATS)\n[Resource 7](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5708/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f2wdu/oats/", "created_utc": 1369575457.0, "score": 45, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1f2wdu/oats/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Hummus", "selftext": "Chickpeas (found in hummus) are legumes that are also called garbanzo beans. Beans such as chickpeas are an excellent source of fiber, which can help you keep cholesterol levels low and promote better heart health. Fiber-rich chickpeas also help diabetics regulate blood sugar levels, making hummus a particularly diabetes-friendly snack as well. The high fiber in chickpeas also helps promote a healthier digestive tract and fend off constipation.\n\n**Thank the fiber in chickpeas for making hummus a snack that fills you up and stays with you. Fiber helps you feel full and stay full, so that you won't be reaching for another snack shortly after you finish eating. Hummus is also very low in calories and fat. A 2 tbsp.-serving has only about 50 calories and 3 g of fat.**\n\nWhen you drizzle olive oil into your food processor with the garbanzo beans to make hummus, you're adding healthy fats. Olive oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are thought to be heart-healthy. These healthy fats help to lower cholesterol levels, promote healthier blood clotting and help manage blood sugar in diabetics.\n\n**Hummus can lower your risk of heart disease by lowering risk factors such as elevated cholesterol and blood pressure. According to a study published in the \"Annals of Nutrition & Metabolism,\" adding chickpeas to your diet can lower total and LDL cholesterol, the so-called \"bad\" cholesterol. The sesame seeds in the tahini paste contain high levels of magnesium, which can also help lower cholesterol as well as blood pressure. The antioxidants from garlic and the monounsaturated fatty acids in olive oil can both lower cholesterol, improve blood flow and reduce risk of atherosclerosis.**\n\nHummus may be able to help reduce the risk of cancer due to the antioxidant activity of chickpeas and garlic. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, garlic contains an abundance of antioxidants which have been reported to reduce the risk of colon and stomach cancers. Among dry beans, chickpeas contain one of the highest levels of polyphenols, a plant chemical which also acts as an antioxidant.\n\n**In some parts of the world (for example, parts of India), garbanzo beans are eaten daily in large amounts and on a year-round basis. But a recent study has shown that we can obtain health benefits from garbanzo beans even when we eat much smaller amounts over a much shorter period of time. In this study, it took only one week of garbanzo bean consumption to improve participants' control of blood sugar and insulin secretion. Equally important, only one-third cup of the beans per day was needed to provide these blood-sugar related health benefits.**\n\nHummus is good for pregnant women. Hummus is rich in folic acid, a vitamin B complex that helps in the brain development of the fetus and promotes well-being for the mother.\n\n**It helps in getting a good mood and sleep: Large amount of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were found in hummus. These amino acids help in promoting well-rested sleep and uplift one\u2019s mood; and so eating hummus everyday can lead to satisfying shut eye.**\n\nAids in controlling glucose levels: Hummus has low glycemic value. This helps in controlling the increase of your glucose levels, which are beneficial to hyperglycemic patients.\n\n**Garbanzos are a food you definitely want to keep on your \"digestive support\" list\u2014especially if you are focusing on the colon. Between 65-75% of the fiber found in garbanzo beans is insoluble fiber, and this type of fiber remains undigested all the way down to the final segment of your large intestine (colon). Recent studies have shown that garbanzo bean fiber can be metabolized by bacteria in the colon to produce relatively large amounts of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetic, propionic, and butyric acid. These SCFAs provide fuel to the cells that line your intestinal wall. By supporting the energy needs of our intestinal cells, the SCFAs made from garbanzo fibers can help lower your risk of colon problems, including your risk of colon cancer.**\n\nMany of our body systems are susceptible to oxidative stress and damage from reactive oxygen molecules. These systems include our cardiovascular system, our lungs, and our nervous system. Plentiful amounts of antioxidant nutrients are critical for the support of these body systems, and garbanzo beans are a remarkable food in terms of their antioxidant composition. While containing small but valuable amounts of conventional antioxidant nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, garbanzo beans also contain more concentrated supplies of antioxidant phytonutrients. These phytonutrients include the flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin (usually found in the outer layer of the beans), and the phenolic acids ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and vanillic acid (usually found in the interior portion of the beans). Depending on the type of bean and color/thickness of the outer layer, garbanzo beans can also contain significant amounts of the anthocyanins delphinidin, cyanidin, and petunidin. The mineral manganese\u2014a key antioxidant in the energy-producing mitochondria found inside most cells\u2014is also provided in excellent amounts by garbanzo beans. In fact, just one cup of garbanzos can provide you with nearly 85% of the Daily Value (DV) for this key antioxidant. An increasing number of animal and human studies clearly show the ability of garbanzo beans to reduce our risk of heart disease, and we believe that an important part of this risk reduction is due to the fantastic antioxidant make-up of these legumes.\n\n**Chickpeas cause flatulence (not necessarily a bad thing.)**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 cup (246g) commercial hummus\n\nCalories: 408\nCalories from Fat: 198\nTotal Fat: 24g 36% of daily value \nSaturated Fat: 4g 18% of daily value \nTrans Fat: 0g \nCholesterol: 0mg \nSodium: 932mg 39% of daily value \nTotal Carbohydrate: 35g 12% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 15g 59% of daily value\nSugars: 0g \nProtein: 19g\nVitamin A: 1% of daily value\nCalcium: 9% of daily value\nIron 33% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/446490-what-are-the-health-benefits-of-hummus/)\n[Resource 2](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/hummus-healthy-5821.html)\n[Resource 3](http://www.simple-remedies.com/health-food/benefits-of-eating-hummus.html)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=58)\n[Resource 5](http://www.mademan.com/mm/5-foods-give-you-gas.html#vply=0)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4407/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew9uh/hummus/", "created_utc": 1369305817.0, "score": 49, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew9uh/hummus/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Bacon", "selftext": "Bacon contains several grams of complete protein per serving, and provides all nine amino acids you need in your diet. Your body uses protein to maintain lean muscle mass and hormone balance, aid in brain function and keep your other tissues healthy and functional. The average American needs approximately 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day, according to Iowa State University. This translates to 60 grams of protein daily for the average 150-pound individual. A 3-ounce serving of bacon contains 29 grams of protein.\n\n**Bacon and provides vitamin B-12, a nutrient important for healthy red blood cells. Vitamin B-12 allows you to make hemoglobin, the protein your blood needs to transport oxygen. Consuming enough B-12 also helps you metabolize fats and protein, plays a role in brain function and protects you from the nerve damage that can result from vitamin B-12 deficiency. A 3-ounce serving of bacon provides 1 microgram of vitamin B-12 -- 42 percent of your daily recommended intake, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements.**\n\nBacon contains iron, an essential mineral also important for hemoglobin production. Each hemoglobin protein contains four iron atoms, and consuming enough iron in your diet helps ensure that you can make enough hemoglobin to support red blood cell function. Iron also makes up a component of myoglobin, a protein your muscles use to store oxygen. A 3-ounce serving of bacon provides 0.8 milligrams of iron. Bacon can help you reach your recommended daily iron intake -- 18 milligrams for women and 8 milligrams for men, according to the Linus Pauling Institute.\n\n**The fats in bacon are about 50% monounsaturated and a large part of those is oleic acid. This is the same fatty acid that olive oil is praised for and generally considered \u201cheart-healthy\u201d.**\n\nAbout 68 percent of the calories in every ounce of bacon stem from fat, about half of which is saturated. Add 30 milligrams of cholesterol, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for high cholesterol, which leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and high blood pressure. A 2009 National Cancer Institute study with 617,000 participants found that men who consumed processed meats often -- including bacon -- had a 27 percent greater risk of heart disease; high-consuming women had a 50 percent greater risk than those who ate processed meats once per month or less. Similarly, a 2010 Harvard study found that consuming just one serving of bacon per day was associated with a 42 percent greater risk of cardiovascular disease over those who only consumed unprocessed meats. The study indicated that bacon\u2019s high levels of nitrites, a preservative, and sodium may play roles in the increased risk of heart disease.\n\n**Bacon consumption may lead to an increased risk of developing diabetes. The 2010 Harvard study indicated that consuming one serving of processed meats \u2013 including bacon -- every day led to a 19 percent greater chance of developing diabetes. Again, the increased risk was tied to bacon\u2019s sky-high levels of sodium and nitrites. According to \"The New York Times,\" processed meats such as bacon contain 400 percent more sodium and 50 percent more nitrites than unprocessed meat. A 2010 meta-study in the journal \u201cCirculation\u201d also linked the intake of processed meats with a 19 percent higher risk of developing diabetes.**\n\nBacon consumption has been linked to higher cancer rates. A 2012 study by the World Cancer Research Fund found a 19 percent increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer per every 50 grams of bacon consumed. Study participants who ate 150 grams \u2013 or six strips \u2013 of bacon each day had a 57 percent greater risk. The National Cancer Institute study also found 20 to 22 percent higher cancer rates among the participants who ate the most processed meats. Findings like these prompted the American Institute for Cancer Research to state that it\u2019s not safe to consume processed meat.\n\n**A 2007 study from Columbia University suggests that eating lots of bacon and other processed meats \u2013 at least 14 servings per month or more \u2013 increased the risk of contracting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. This research indicated that nitrites may be a culprit in COPD, which causes conditions such as emphysema and bronchitis.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 slice (7g) pork, cured, panfried\n\nCalories: 41\nCalories from Fat: 28\nTotal Fat: 3g 5% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 1g 5% of daily value\nTrans Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 9mg 3% of daily value\nSodium: 188mg 8% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 0g\nDietary Fiber: 0g\nSugars: 0g\nProtein: 3g\nIron: 1% of daily value\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/good-health-benefits-sausage-bacon-8236.html)\n[Resource 2](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/2681?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=&qlookup=&offset=&sort=&format=Abridged&_action_show=Apply+Changes&Qv=1&Q4968=7.4)\n[Resource 3](http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/harmful-effect-much-bacon-1456.html)\n[Resource 5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2544536/)\n[Resource 6](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/pork-products/7356/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew8wc/bacon/", "created_utc": 1369303947.0, "score": 62, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1ew8wc/bacon/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Grapes", "selftext": "The most crucial benefit you derive from eating grapes is production of anti-oxidants in your body. Grapes are rich in antioxidants due to the presence of phytonutrients called polyphenols. These antioxidants bind with the \u201cfree radicals\u201d present in  your body and reduce the risk of plague formation on the arteries, thus improving your heart\u2019s health. Grapes also help in the generation of nitric oxide in the body. This compound helps improve heart health by reducing blood clots, platelet aggregation and oxidation of LDL (which causes plagues on the arteries).\n\n**Thanks to their antioxidant properties, grapes also offer some measure of protection against cancer. Studies have found that grape seed extract can kill leukemia cells and head and neck cancer cells, and can prevent the growth of breast, stomach, colon, prostate and lung cancer cells in laboratory experiments.**\n\nResveratrol, a polyphenol found in grape skins and seed, keeps the heart muscles flexible and healthy. Resveratrol also breaks down bad cholesterol. The reason why \u201cred wines\u201d have gained popularity is because of their high concentration of Resveratrol. The French who eat a high fat diet have been found to have low heart disease stats, a phenomenon known as the \u201cFrench Paradox, which is largely owning to their consumption of red wine and grapes.\n\n**Although few large-scale clinical studies have been conducted, evidence points toward consumption of grapes as being beneficial for brain health. An animal study at the University of Houston found that rats fed a grape-enriched diet experienced reduced anxiety and learning and memory problems brought on by anxiety. Another study found that participants who drank a glass of Concord grape juice daily scored better on the California Verbal Learning Test than participants who did not. Key antioxidant components of grapes have also been linked to improved brain health. In 2008, researchers at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University reported that supplementing with resveratrol, commonly found in grapes, reduced plaque formation, a factor associated with Alzheimer\u2019s and other related diseases, in animal brains.**\n\nThanks to presence of antioxidant compounds in grapes, it helps bind free radicals in the body. These free radicals or \u201coxidants\u201d are responsible for instigating cancer formation in various organs of the body. It has been studied that drinking red wine can reduce the risk of lung cancer by 13%, owing to high concentration of antioxidants like resveratrol. You can get the same benefit from eating purple grapes on daily basis, if you don\u2019t want to drink red wine.\n\n**It has been found the grapes have several anti-microbial properties but they are not harmful to the beneficial bacteria in the stomach. Tests have shown that grape extracts inhibited the growth of 14 different types of harmful bacteria commonly found in human intestine and stomach including E coli, Salmonella and H. pylori (which causes stomach ulcers).**\n\nStudies from the University of Missouri-Columbia show that grapes prevent brain damage in the event of a stroke.\n\n**Grapes have a significant amount of potassium and increase brain activity.**\n\nThe fiber found in grapes occurs in two forms, known as soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber is found in the soft part of grapes. In the digestive tract, it forms a gel that can promote regular bowel movements. Grape peels contain insoluble fiber, which helps food move through the digestive tract more quickly. These types of fiber act as natural laxatives, so eating large quantities of grapes may cause loose stools or gastrointestinal discomfort.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: 100g of grapes\nCalories: 60\nCarbohydrates: 15 g\nSugar: 15 g\nProteins: 21g\nFat: 21g\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.outofstress.com/grapes-good-for-you/)\n[Resource 2](http://www.med.umich.edu/cvc/)\n[Resource 3](http://www.livestrong.com/article/547902-negative-effects-of-eating-grapes/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/inside_fordham/february_6_2012/news/want_better_vision_e_81620.asp)\n[Resource 5](http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/eating_purple_grapes_and_potential_health_benefits)\n[Resource 6](http://hsibaltimore.com/2003/12/24/the-health-benefits-of-eating-grapes/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eu1ce/grapes/", "created_utc": 1369231381.0, "score": 42, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1eu1ce/grapes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Brown Rice", "selftext": "Brown rice is a good source of magnesium, a mineral that is essential to bone health. Just one cup of brown rice contains 21 percent of the recommended daily value of magnesium. Most of the magnesium in the body is stored on or in the bones, so to keep a high level of magnesium in your bones, and to reap the other health benefits, eat plenty of brown rice each week.\n\n**Brown rice has a rich content of manganese, which helps in the production of energy from carbohydrates and protein. The nutrient also plays a key role in the synthesis of fatty acids, which is necessary for a healthy nervous system. One can get about 88% of the daily needs for manganese by consuming juts one cup of brown rice. The manganese present in brown rice is also required for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase, which protects the mitochondria against the free radicals formed during energy production.**\n\nBrown rice is a rich source of fiber and selenium, both of which help lower the risk of colon cancer significantly. Selenium also works with vitamin E, in several antioxidant systems of the body, which help fight against heart diseases. This is also beneficial against the symptoms of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n**The rice also contains insoluble fiber, which helps women avoid developing gallstones.**\n\nThe oil present in brown rice helps in lowering the cholesterol level in the body.\n\n**Brown rice works extremely good for postmenopausal women with complains of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other symptoms of cardiovascular diseases.**\n\nBrown rice is abundant in plant lignans, which get converted into mammalian lignans like enterolactone, in the intestine. Enterolactone is highly protective against breast and other hormone-dependent cancers and also heart diseases.\n\n**The rice helps in reducing the risk of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is associated with symptoms like visceral obesity, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and low level of defensive HDL cholesterol.**\n\nBrown rice reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\n**Brown rice is a good source of magnesium, which reduces the severity of asthma, lowers the frequency of migraine headaches and decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Magnesium balances the action of calcium and thus, helps in regulating nerve and muscle tone.**\n\nBrown rice offers major protection against breast cancer, especially in pre-menopausal women.\n\n**Intake of brown rice can help the body fight against the childhood asthma. It is also protective against obesity, ischemic stroke and insulin resistance.**\n\nOne cup of brown rice will provide you with 88.0% of the daily value for manganese. This trace mineral helps produce energy from protein and carbohydrates and is involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, which are important for a healthy nervous system, and in the production of cholesterol, which is used by the body to produce sex hormones. Manganese is also a critical component of a very important antioxidant enzyme called superoxide dismutase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is found inside the body's mitochondria (the oxygen-based energy factories inside most of our cells) where it provides protection against damage from the free radicals produced during energy production.\n\n**Brown Rice is rich in fiber, which contributes towards the reduction of cholesterol level and also the prevention of atherosclerosis. The fiber also binds to the cancer-causing chemicals, protecting the body against colon cancer. The fiber present in brown rice also helps normalize the bowel function and thus, reduces constipation.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size = 195g\nCalories: 216\nCalories from Fat: 15\nTotal Fat: 2g/3% of daily value\nSaturated Fat: 0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium: 10mg/0% of daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 45g/15% of daily value\nDietary Fiber: 4g/14% of daily value\nSugars: 1g\nProtein: 5g\nCalcium: 2%\nIron: 5%\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/benefits-of-brown-rice-6211.html)\n[Resource 2](http://nutritiousfoods.blogspot.kr/2009/10/health-benefits-of-brown-rice.html?m=1)\n[Resource 3](http://www.symptomfind.com/nutrition-supplements/brown-rice-health-benefits/)\n[Resource 4](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=128)\n[Resource 5](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5707/2)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epd7d/brown_rice/", "created_utc": 1369070160.0, "score": 23, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epd7d/brown_rice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Sparkling Water", "selftext": "The most important nutritional benefit of sparkling water is hydration. Water makes up 60 percent of your total body weight. A dehydrated cell dies rapidly. Every system in your body relies on water, and water is needed to flush out toxins and moisten your nose, mouth, throat and lungs. Sparkling water is as effective as regular spring water or tap water in replacing fluids lost in urine or sweat.\n\n**Got an upset stomach? Feeling queasy? Ate too much fatty or spicy food? Rather than reach for the antacids, try drinking a glass of seltzer. Researchers have found that people with both indigestion and constipation who drank at least 1 1/2 liters of carbonated water every day for 15\u201330 days had a big improvement in their symptoms compared to people who drank regular tap water.**\n\nSparkling mineral water is known to reduce LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels. Elevated levels of LDL can cause cardiovascular issues such as high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\n**This may sound odd, but in a study where postmenopausal women were given a carbonated mineral water to drink, after two months, these women had lower LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) and higher HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol level, as well as lower fasting glucose levels, compared to women who drank regular water. The mineral water used in this study contained bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. It\u2019s thought that the alkaline pH of the water affected absorption and excretion of cholesterol.Carbonated waters do not leech calcium from bones, nor do they contribute to kidney stone formation. However, there may be people who need to limit their intake of fizzy water. If you have irritable bowel syndrome, you might want to go easy on all fizzy drinks as they can make you even more bloated than you already may be. People with acid reflux should be careful about carbonated beverages, as drinking them may sometimes aggravate symptoms. Also, if you need to watch your sodium intake, go for seltzer instead of club soda. Club soda contains about 60 to 80 milligrams of sodium per serving, whereas seltzer has none.**\n\nSparkling mineral water contains bicarbonate. Bicarbonate helps balance sodium levels in the body.\n\n**The Journal of Nutrition study found that the drinking of the sodium-rich mineral water did not lead to any increase in blood pressure. One reason for this is that sparkling waters tend to be rich in bicarbonate, which is believed to help balance any negative effects sodium may have in the body.**\n\nOne of the myths out there is that drinking fizzy water will erode tooth enamel. This probably stems from the fact that when carbon dioxide gas is pumped into water, small amounts of carbonic acid are formed. But studies have shown that this small amount of acid doesn\u2019t hurt your teeth. In fact, fizzy waters contain calcium and other minerals (albeit, in small amounts) that can actually buffer the carbonic acid and protect tooth enamel. On the other hand both regular and diet soda contain phosphoric acid and/or citric acid, which can be harmful to dental enamel.\n\n**Sparkling mineral water can help increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Increased levels of HDL (\"good\" cholesterol) can reduce cardiovascular issues such as heart disease and high blood pressure.**\n\nCarbonation found in sparkling mineral water can kill harmful bacteria. Bacteria can cause infections and attack the immune system.\n\n**As the carbonated water fizzes and bubbles in the stomach, it can cause a buildup of air, and this can lead to loud belching. This belching can sometimes become uncontrollable. This buildup of air can also cause abdominal distension, or bloating. If enough carbonated water is consumed, you can suffer from painful, chronic bloating. The pain from bloating can even be mistaken for other illnesses such as appendicitis, and you may even feel the need to seek medical help.**\n\nCarbonated beverages can cause an excess production of stomach acid, which can irritate the stomach lining and cause a peptic ulcer. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, peptic ulcers are open sores in the stomach lining, esophagus or the first part of the intestine, also called the duodenum. This can cause significant pain and even lead to bleeding in the stomach. Some people also vomit blood or have black stools caused by the bleeding in the stomach. This condition requires immediate medical treatment.\n\n**Carbonated water can cause a buildup of air that can move down the digestive tract and into the colon, causing flatulence. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, one sure way to avoid flatulence is to avoid carbonated beverages all together.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size: 1 serving\nCalories: 0 (nothing else to report on)\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.drbriffa.com/2005/01/23/sparkling-water/)\n[Resource 2](http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/Blog/Amy-Campbell/carbonated-water-yes-or-no/)\n[Resource 3](http://www.ehow.com/facts_4869228_health-benefits-sparkling-mineral-water.html)\n[Resource 4](http://www.livestrong.com/article/343521-sparkling-water-nutrition/)\n[Resource 5](http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-olive-garden-san-pellegrino-sparkling-i127844)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epbpk/sparkling_water/", "created_utc": 1369068966.0, "score": 37, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1epbpk/sparkling_water/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Ramen Noodles", "selftext": "Once you have consumed instant noodles, it will take 4 to 5 days to excrete the wax, which is coated on the noodles, from the body. But we can get rid off the wax if the noodles are cooked in the right way.\n\n**A major mark against ramen noodles is the sodium, notes Women Fitness, which put the noodles on its \"Top 10 Foods Worst to Consume\" list. The noodles' flavor packets contain anywhere from the beef's 861 mg of sodium to 3,000 mg in some other flavors. The recommended daily dose of sodium, as per the Dietary Reference Intake, should be no more than 1,440 mg. Another mark against the noodles is they are basically rolled dough that is deep-fried and lack any significant nutritional value.**\n\nThe packet inside of the Ramen noodle package contains large amounts of sodium. The flavor packet also contains monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gives MSG the nod as an ingredient that is \"generally recognized as safe.\" Different research groups and individuals have sent the FDA reports of some MSG side effects. According to \"Contemporary Nutrition,\" the food additive industry readily admits that MSG has addictive properties and can cause people to gain weight, but they justify its use by claiming that this can be beneficial to elderly persons who are sometimes malnourished. Glutamate, the main component of MSG, is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and it has been linked to neurological symptoms when taken in excess.\n\n\n**On any diet, you must make sure to get enough protein. Ramen noodles can deliver in this area, with an average of 10 grams of protein per serving. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests adult women get at least 46 protein grams per day, while adult men need at least 56 grams daily. Ramen noodles provide you with healthy protein. One package will give you up to one-fourth of the daily intake you need.

{"title": "Lamb", "selftext": "Lamb, being a red meat, has high amount of dietary saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, which can result in different forms of chronic diseases, including heart diseases and some forms of cancer.\n\n**Like other meat items, lamb also contains naturally occurring substances like purines that are responsible for the health condition called gout and even the formation of kidney stones.Hence, it is advisable for individuals suffering with kidney problems or gout, to limit or avoid intake of purine-containing foods such as lamb.**\n\nAn average serving of lamb is a good source of high quality protein and supplies the body with 60.3% of the daily requirement for protein.\n\n**The meat contains a high amount of zinc, which is required by every living cell in the body for healthy immune function, cell division and overall growth.**\n\nAn area where we would expect to see health benefits from lamb consumption would involve blood sugar regulation. Lamb has long been a part of menus and recipes endorsed by the American Diabetic Association, where it is viewed as a lean meat that is high in protein and that can be beneficially incorporated into recipes in amounts of 3-4 ounces per serving. Lamb is often unranked on lists of glycemic index (GI) values due to its virtually non-existent carb content. This absence of carbs in lamb might allow the very broad B-vitamin content of lamb to help support metabolism of other carbs provided by other foods that were consumed alongside of the lamb. (Vitamins B1, B2 and B3 are especially important in optimal functioning of enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism.)\n\n**The meat is a good source of selenium, a mineral whose deficiency can lead to asthma attacks.**\n\nLamb is a good source of vitamin B12 and also provides important amounts of the B vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, folate, biotin, pantothenic acid and choline. Vitamins B6, B12, folate and choline are especially important for healthy metabolism of homocysteine and can help prevent unwanted accumulation of excess homocysteine in the body. High blood levels of homocysteine are a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\n**It is a good source of vitamin B12, necessary to prevent a dangerous molecule called homocysteine from harming the body. It also promotes a healthy nervous system, supports the formation of red blood cells and prevents anemia. Moreover, vitamin B12 is found naturally only in animal foods.**\n\nLamb provides antioxidant minerals that have been shown to help lower risk of cardiovascular disease by reducing unwanted oxidative stress. Lamb provides a very good amount of the mineral selenium and good amount of the mineral zinc.\n\n**Despite the fact that about one-third of the fat in lamb comes from saturated fat, lamb (especially when pasture fed) can be a significant source of omega-3 fat and is also contains a large amount of monounsaturated fat (40% of its total fat). Both omega-3 fat and monounsaturated fat have been associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease.**\n\nThe niacin (vitamin B3) present in lamb provides protection against Alzheimer's disease, promotes healthy skin and keeps age-related cognitive decline at bay. Moreover, it retards the risk of developing osteoarthritis by as much as half.\n\n**Lamb is rich in iron, which is an integral component of hemoglobin and aids formation of red blood cells in the body. The form in which iron is present in lamb is easily absorbed by the body.**\n\nThe omega-3 content of lamb depends upon the young sheep's diet as well as the mother's diet, but when those diets are nutritionally supportive, the result can be a cut of lamb with a very impressive amount of omega-3s. In regions of some countries without access to a coastline and fish, lamb has sometimes been shown to provide more omega-3s than any other food in the diet. In Australia, where lamb is eaten frequently by both children and adults, recent studies have shown lamb to rank among the top omega-3 foods in the daily diet. In our own nutritional profile of lamb, we use a conservative average estimate of 40 milligrams of omega-3s per ounce of roasted lamb loin. That's 50% of the omega-3s in an ounce of baked cod fish or broiled tuna, and 67% of the amount in an ounce of sesame seeds.\n\n**Selenium has antioxidant properties which help to boost the body\u2019s immune system. It protects body cells from damage by free radicals. Selenium can be found in lamb and is known to enhance thyroid functions and facilitates the activities of various essential enzymes. Selenium has also been found helpful in fighting viral infections.

{"title": "Avocados", "selftext": "Not all fat is bad for your body, and monounsaturated fat in particular is what constitutes the first health benefit of an avocado. In a typical avocado, most of the calories you receive come from monounsaturated fat. The monounsaturated fat in an avocado is healthy for you. Foods like avocados that contain monounsaturated fat lessen your LDL cholesterol, which is harmful to your body. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol has been called \"good cholesterol,\" and there is speculation that monounsaturated fat actually raises this type of cholesterol.\n\n**Research has shown that certain compounds in avocados are able to seek out pre-cancerous and cancerous oral cancer cells and destroy them without harming healthy cells.**\n\nAvocados are packed with vitamins. The vitamins that you can find in an avocado are B vitamins along with vitamin K and vitamin E. B vitamins help your body's metabolism and its maintenance of a healthy skin tone, while vitamin K plays a fundamental role in making sure that your bones grow properly and that your bone density is maintained in later life. Vitamin E is necessary to avoid conditions like retinopathy.\n\n**The high levels of folate in avocado are also protective against strokes. People who eat diets rich in folate have a much lower risk of stroke than those who don't.**\n\nAvocados are a great source of lutein, a carotenoid that works as an antioxidant and helps protect against eye disease. They also contain the related carotenoids zeaxanthin, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene, as well as tocopherol (vitamin E).\n\n**Half an avocado contains 3.4 grams of fiber, including soluble and insoluble, both of which your body needs to keep the digestive system running smoothly. Plus, soluble fiber slows the breakdown of carbohydrates in your body, helping you feel full for longer. Avocados also contain oleic acid, a fat that activates the part of your brain that makes you feel full. Healthier unsaturated fats containing oleic acid have been shown to produce a greater feeling of satiety than less-healthy saturated fats and trans fats found in processed foods.**\n\nRich, creamy, and packed with beneficial monounsaturated fat, avocado slows digestion and helps keep blood sugar from spiking after a meal. A diet high in good fats may even help reverse insulin resistance, which translates to steadier blood sugar long-term.\n\n**One cup of avocado provides almost a quarter of your recommended daily intake of folate, a vitamin which cuts the risk of birth defects. If you\u2019re pregnant\u2014or planning to be\u2014avocados will help protect your unborn baby.**\n\nA high folate intake is also associated with a lower risk of heart attacks and heart disease. Does your family have a history of heart problems, or do you have risk factors (such as being overweight or smoking) for heart disease? Avocados could help keep your heart healthy.\n\n**As well as increasing feelings of fullness, the oleic acid in avocados can help reduce cholesterol levels. In one study, individuals eating an avocado-rich diet had a significant decrease in total cholesterol levels, including a decrease in LDL cholesterol. Their levels of HDL cholesterol (the healthy type) increased by 11 percent.**\n\nThe combination of avocado's high potassium content, 30 percent more than banana, with omega-3 and oleic acid are beneficial toward reducing blood pressure.\n\n**Inflammation is considered the basis of most non-contagious diseases. Avocados have an abundance of plant phytonutrient polyphenols and flavonoids, which have been discovered as anti-inflammatory agents.**\n\nAvocados can help protect against prostate and breast cancers.\n\n**The master antioxidant glutathione supports the liver and the nervous system. It is responsible for replenishing and recycling other antioxidants in the body. It is vital for a strong immune system, and avocado is one of the few foods that contain a considerable amount of glutathione.**\n\nNutrients and enzymes in avocado reduce inflammation in the stomach and small intestine's mucous lining. This also improves the body's ability to absorb carotenoids and nutrients.\n\n**A study's participants who ate salads with avocados absorbed five times the amount of carotenoids than those who did not include avocados. Carotenoids include beta carotene and lycopene. Beta carotene is a precursor to vitamin A, and lycopene is a compound that reduces stroke and prostate cancer risks.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*:\n\nServing Size 1/5 medium avocado (30 g/1 oz.)\nServings Per Container 5\n\nCalories 50 Calories from Fat 35\n\n% Daily Value*\nTotal Fat  4.5g\t7%\nSaturated Fat 0.5g\t3%\nTrans Fat 0g\t \nPolyunsaturated Fat 0.5g\t \nMonounsaturated Fat 3g\t \nCholesterol 0mg\t0%\nSodium  0mg\t0%\nPotassium 150mg\t4%\nTotal Carbohydrate 3g\t1%\nDietary Fiber 2g\t8%\nSugars 0g\t \nProtein  0g\n\nVitamin A 0%\t        \u2022\tVitamin C 4%\nCalcium 0%\t                \u2022\tIron 2%\nVitamin E 4%\t        \u2022\tThiamin 2%\nRiboflavin 4%\t        \u2022\tNiacin 4%\nVitamin B6 4%\t        \u2022      Folate 6%\nPantothenic Acid 4%\t\u2022\tPhosphorus 2%\nMagnesium 2%\t        \u2022      Zinc 2%\nCopper 2%\t                \u2022\tManganese 2%\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/eat-well/healthy-eating/5-surprising-health-benefits-of-eating-avocados)\n[Resource 2](http://www.naturalnews.com/040067_avocado_cancer_prevention_superfood.html)\n[Resource 3](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/avocado-health-benefits-3-reasons-you-should-be-eating-them.html#b)\n[Resource 4](http://www.healthdiaries.com/eatthis/10-health-benefits-of-avocados.html)\n[Resource 5](http://www.avocadocentral.com/nutrition/avocado-nutrition-health-facts-label)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1enlyh/avocados/", "created_utc": 1369001092.0, "score": 68, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1enlyh/avocados/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Gatorade", "selftext": "Electrolytes, including sodium, potassium and chloride, are nutrients and are essential for the body to function properly. During heavy physical exertion, the human body perspires as a way to eliminate toxins and cool the body through evaporation. Electrolytes are components of perspiration. Heavy sweating can result in a significant loss of electrolytes. Gatorade contains all three of these is essential elements and can help to replenish losses due to excessive perspiration.\n\n**Potassium is the other major electrolyte found in Gatorade, although its overall concentration is quite low when compared to sodium. Potassium losses in perspiration are just a fraction of sodium losses, which is why an 8-ounce serving of Gatorade provides only 30 milligrams of potassium. Despite the smaller quantities, replacing the potassium is important in prolonged exercise lasting more than 90 minutes. Potassium works with sodium to maintain proper fluid balance and also helps to trigger the electrical impulses that signal the muscles to contract and relax.**\n\nAnother downside to excessive perspiration is the loss of fluids within the body. Proper hydration is essential to maintaining high levels of performance, particularly for those involved in athletic activities. Gatorade can provide significant quantities of water to help support hydration requirements while a person is involved in heavy physical activity. The osmality of Gatorade, the number of particles in solution, is slightly higher than that of blood. That, along with the electrolytes and carbohydrates in the drink, provide for rapid absorption, according to Gatorade.com.\n\n**Gatorade also contains a carbohydrates in the form of sucrose and dextrose, which are an essential fuel source for optimal muscle function during physical exertion. These simple carbohydrates break down easily within the body. According to Gatorade.com, the sports drink contains 14 g of carbohydrates per 8 oz. serving, offering a significant source of readily available food energy.**\n\nProbably the most common consequence of drinking too much Gatorade is weight gain. Each 32-oz. bottle of Gatorade has 200 calories. If an athlete burns fewer calories than that, the excess calories will be stored as fat, which will eventually lead to weight gain.\n\n**Gatorade is fortified with a variety of different vitamins and minerals, including some fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin A. Fat-soluble vitamins cannot be excreted from the body when they are consumed in quantities too large, so side effects may occur. Drinking too much Gatorade, and consuming much more than your recommended amount of vitamin A, can lead to vitamin toxicity, also known as hypervitaminosis A. The National Institutes of Health say that the symptoms of hypervitaminosis A include blurred vision, fatigue, headache and nausea.**\n\nOne bottle of Gatorade can have up to 800mg of sodium, which is 33 percent of your normal daily recommended intake. Drinking too much Gatorade, especially along with eating salty foods, may result in high blood pressure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that too much salt in the diet can lead to high blood pressure and eventually to health problems like heart attacks and strokes.\n\n**Gatorade contains high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrup has been linked to obesity and metabolic conditions.**\n\nDrinking a single 20-oz. sports drink every day for a year could cause an individual to gain about 13 lbs., according to a report from the University of California at Berkley's Robert C. and Veronica Akins Center for Weight and Health.\n\n**Brominated vegetable oil can be found in Gatorade and is made by adding bromine to vegetable oil. It's patented as a flame retardant. But when used in drinks, its purpose is to prevent the oil from separating from the other drink ingredients. Because bromine is a halogen, it may displace iodine in the human body and may impair thyroid function. Case studies prior to 1975, when brominated sedatives were in use, indicated bromine may cause side effects that mimic psychosis and brain damage. These include depression, memory loss, hallucinations, violent tendencies, seizures, cerebral atrophy, acute irritability, tremors, ataxia, confusion, loss of peripheral vision, slurred speech, stupor, tendon reflex changes, photophobia due to enlarged pupils, and extensor plantar responses. Animal studies link bromide consumption to heart and kidney damage and fat deposits in those organs. In extreme cases, it's produced testicular damage, stunted growth, lethargy, and fatigue in animals.**\n\nA study conducted by the University of Iowa found that Gatorade erodes teeth faster than Coke, Diet Coke, Red Bull or 100 percent apple juice.\n\n**There are 56g of sugar in each regular sized bottle of Gatorade. Though replacing some sugars lost during exercise is generally a good idea, drinking too much sugar can lead to high blood sugar in the cells which can be very dangerous. Since every person is different, there is no one amount of sugar which is too much to consume for everybody. Some people, such as diabetics, may get high blood sugar from drinking even half of a bottle of Gatorade, while it may take several bottles to cause high blood sugar in others.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 8 fl oz or 240 ml (There are 4 servings in each bottle)\n\nCalories: 50\nTotal Fat: 0g\nSodium: 110mg/5% daily value\nPotassium: 30 mg/1% daily value\nTotal Carbohydrate: 14g/5%\nSugars: 14g\nProtein: 0g\n\n*Links*: [Resource 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/68710-effects-much-gatorade/)\n\n[Resource 2](http://news.yahoo.com/pepsico-ditches-bvo-gatorade-still-drinking-215800296.html)\n\n[Resource 3](http://www.livestrong.com/article/259258-benefits-of-drinking-gatorade/)\n\n[Resource 4](http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/benefits-drinking-gatorade-16510.html)\n\n[Resource 5](http://www.ehow.com/facts_5483622_pros-cons-gatorade.html)\n\n[Resource 6](http://jahnvijp.wordpress.com/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en7ak/gatorade/", "created_utc": 1368989466.0, "score": 35, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en7ak/gatorade/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Tomatoes", "selftext": "Tomatoes are acidic vegetables, so eating too many of them can aggravate preexisting medical conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, also known as acid reflux -- a condition in which the digestive acids in your stomach rise and leak through the muscle acting as a valve between your stomach and esophagus, burning your esophagus. Tomatoes, especially in great quantities, can make this worse. According to the Mayo Clinic, the seeds in tomatoes can also aggravate diverticulitis, by lodging in the diverticula, small pouches formed in your digestive tract, causing inflammation and infection.\n\n**Numerous studies have concluded that the more tomatoes people eat the lower their risks of certain cancers, especially lung, stomach and prostate cancers.  A substance called lycopene, which is responsible for tomatoes red color, is thought to be the reason for this cancer protective effect. Processed tomatoes contain even more lycopene than raw ones. The process of cooking breaks down the cell walls, helping to release the lycopene. Eating tomatoes with a little bit of fat, such as olive oil, helps lycopene to be better absorbed by the body.**\n\nTomatoes can improve your vision. The vitamin A that tomatoes provide can improve vision and help prevent night blindness. Recent research shows that consuming tomatoes may help reduce the risk of macular degeneration, a serious and irreversible eye condition.\n\n**Tomatoes will make your hair look better.The vitamin A found in tomatoes works to make hair strong and shiny. (Sorry, tomatoes cannot help much with thinning hair\u2014but they will make the hair you have look better!)**\n\nTomatoes can help prevent kidney stones and gallstones. Some studies suggest that kidney and gall stones are less likely to form in people who eat tomatoes without the seeds.\n\n**Tomatoes can reduce chronic pain. If you are one of the millions of people who deal with mild to moderate chronic pain (such as from arthritis or back pain), tomatoes may be a pain-buster. Tomatoes are high in bioflavonoids and carotenoids, which are known anti-inflammatory agents. Chronic pain often involves chronic inflammation, so attacking the inflammation is a good way to fight the chronic pain.**\n\nTomatoes are high in important antioxidants such as vitamin C and Vitamin A. These vitamins work to fend of DNA damage from free radicals. Consequently, tomatoes may help to ward off age related diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes.\n\n**Tomatoes can help you lose weight. If you are on a sensible diet and exercise plan, build lots of tomatoes into your everyday eating. They make a great snack and can be used to \u201cbulk up\u201d salads, casseroles, sandwiches and other meals. Because tomatoes contain lots of water and fiber, they are what Weight Watchers calls a \u201cfilling food,\u201d one of those foods that fills you up fast without adding a lot of calories or fat.**\n\nTomatoes contain important nutrients, such as niacin, folate and vitamin B6, that have associated with the reduction of heart disease risk. One study found that women who ate 7 to 10 servings of tomato products per week had a 29 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than women who consumed less than a serving and a half of tomato products each week. Results were even more impressive when the women ate oil-rich tomato products.\n\n**Tomatoes build strong bones.The vitamin K and calcium in tomatoes are both very good for strengthening and repairing bones.\nLycopene also has been shown to improve bone mass, which is a great way to fight osteoporosis.**\n\nOne study showed that drinking 8 ounces of tomato juice daily reduced platelet aggregation significantly, among study subjects. Those drinking a placebo showed no benefit. It\u2019s important to drink low-sodium tomato juice if you are trying to protect against thrombosis (blood clots in the blood vessel) , as high sodium levels can cause negative effects for this type of disease.\n\n**A double blind study found that drinking a glass of tomato juice a day can reduce blood levels of TNF-alpha by 34 percent. TNF-alpha causes inflammation. High levels have been found in individuals with most chronic, degenerative diseases such as heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis and Alzheimer\u2019s.**\n\nTomatoes are a natural cancer fighter. Lycopene can reduce the risk of several cancers, including prostate, cervical, mouth, pharynx, throat, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectal, prostate and ovarian cancer. Tomatoes\u2019 antioxidants (vitamins A and C) fight the free radicals which can cause cell damage.\n\n**Tomatoes can keep your blood sugar in balance. Tomatoes are a very good source of chromium, which helps to regulate blood sugar.**\n\nTomatoes make your skin look great. Beta-carotene helps protect skin against sun damage. Tomatoes\u2019 lycopene also makes skin less sensitive to UV light damage, a leading cause of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving size = 1 small whole\n\nCalories: 16\nCalories from fat: 1\nTotal Fat: .2g\nSaturated Fat: 0g\nPolyunsaturated Fat: .1g\nSodium: 4mg\nTotal Carbohydrates: 3.5g (1% of daily value)\nDietary Fiber: 1.1g (4% of daily value)\nSugars: 2.4g\nProtein: .8g\nVitamin C: 32%\nIron: 8%\n\n*Links*: [Source 1](http://www.livestrong.com/article/494705-side-effects-of-eating-too-many-tomatoes/)\n\n[Source 2](http://www.beliefnet.com/Health/9-Surprising-Health-Benefits-of-Tomatoes.aspx#)\n\n[Source 3](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/5-health-benefits-of-tomatoes.html#b)\n\n[Source 4](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110301091338.htm)\n\n[Source 5](http://voices.yahoo.com/top-5-health-benefits-eating-tomatoes-5649254.html?cat=5)\n\n[Source 6](http://caloriecount.about.com/calories-tomatoes-red-ripe-i11529)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en4gp/tomatoes/", "created_utc": 1368987145.0, "score": 29, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en4gp/tomatoes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Soda", "selftext": "One of the benefits of drinking soda is that it contains caffeine, a natural stimulant found in the kola nut, coffee beans and tea leaves. Caffeine makes you feel more alert when you're tired and might increase your performance when embarking on certain tasks. According to the International Food Council Information Foundation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has recognized caffeine as an additive that's Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS, since the late 1950s. Moderate consumption of caffeine -- around 300 mg -- is generally not harmful for healthy adults, although some people are more sensitive to caffeine. A 12 oz. can of Coke contains 34 mg of caffeine, far less than the average cup of coffee, which contains 85 mg of caffeine.\n\n**Danish researchers discovered that drinking non-diet soda leads to dramatic increases in fat buildup around your liver and your skeletal muscles, both of which can contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes. The study revealed that people who drank a regular soda every day for six months saw a 132 to 142 percent increase in liver fat, a 117 to 221 percent jump in skeletal fat, and about a 30 percent increase in both triglyceride blood fats and other organ fat. Their consumption also led to an 11 percent increase in cholesterol, compared with the people who drank other beverages such as water or milk.**\n\nResearchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center monitored 475 adults for 10 years, and found that those who drank diet soda had a 70 percent increase in waist circumference over the 10-year study, compared with those who didn't drink any soda. Those who drank more than two diet sodas per day saw a 500 percent waist expansion! A separate study the same researchers conducted on mice suggested that it was the aspartame, which raised blood glucose levels, that caused the weight gain; when your liver encounters too much glucose, the excess is converted to body fat.\n\n**Beverages with bubbles contain phosphoric acid, which can severely deplete the blood calcium levels; calcium is a key component of the bone matrix. With less concentration of calcium over a long time, it can lower deposition rates so that bone mass and density suffer. This means that drinking sodas and carbonated water increases your risk of osteoporosis.**\n\nTwo contaminants in the coloring of many sodas, 2-methylimidazole and 4-methylimidazole, have been found to cause cancer in animals, a threat deemed unnecessary, considering that the coloring is purely cosmetic. According to California's strict Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer, just 16 micrograms per person per day of 4-methylimidazole is enough to pose a cancer threat, and most popular brown colas, both diet and regular, contain 200 micrograms per 20-ounce bottle.\n\n**Diet or regular, all colas contain phosphates, or phosphoric acid, a weak acid that gives colas their tangy flavor and improves their shelf life. Although it exists in many whole foods, such as meat, dairy, and nuts, too much phosphoric acid can lead to heart and kidney problems, muscle loss, and osteoporosis, and one study suggests it could trigger accelerated aging. The study, published in a 2010 issue of the FASEB Journal, found that the excessive phosphate levels found in sodas caused lab rats to die a full five weeks earlier than the rats whose diets had more normal phosphate levels\u2014a disturbing trend considering that soda manufacturers have been increasing the levels of phosphoric acid in their products over the past few decades.**\n\nResearchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School analyzed data from the Nurses' Health Study II, a trial tracking the health of more than 51,000 women. None of the participants had diabetes at the onset of the study in 1991. Over the following 8 years, 741 women were diagnosed with the disease. Researchers found that women who drank one or more sugary drinks a day gained more weight and were 83% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who imbibed less than once a month.\n\n**Another problem with sodas is that they act as dehydrating diuretics. Both caffeine and sugar cause dehydration. Caffeine is a diuretic and causes an increase in urine volume. High concentration of sugar is drawing off water because your kidneys try to expel the excess sugar out of the blood. When you drink a caffeinated soda to quench your thirst, you will actually become more thirsty.**\n\nDiet soda is filled with artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin. These artificial sweeteners pose a threat to your health. Saccharin, for instance, has been found to be carcinogenic, and studies have found that it produced bladder cancer in rats.\n\n**Soda, no matter who makes it, is the most acidic beverage you can buy, with a pH of about 2.5, about the same as vinegar, but the sugar content disguises the acidity. To put that into perspective, consider that battery acid has a pH of 1 and pure water has a pH level of 7. Why does that matter? Throughout the digestive system, that starts from the mouth and ends up at the anus only the stomach can resist an acidic environment up to pH 2.0. But before the acidity of soft drink reaches the stomach it passes through all the other organs involved in the digestive system thus causing an abnormal acidic environment. The linings of the mouth, pharynx and esophagus are highly sensitive to acids. The phosphoric acid present in soft drink competes with the hydrochloric acid of the stomach and affects its functions. When the stomach becomes ineffective, food remains undigested causing indigestion, gassiness or bloating (swelling of stomach).**\n\ncaffeine usually present in soft drinks, and you are in for even more trouble. Caffeine can deplete the body\u2019s calcium, in addition to stimulating your central nervous system and contributing to stress, a racing mind, and insomnia.\n\n**Rapidly absorbed carbohydrates like high fructose corn syrup put more strain on insulin-producing cells than other foods. When sugar enters the bloodstream quickly, the pancreas has to secrete large amounts of insulin for the body to process it. Some scientists believe that the unceasing demands that a soda habit places on the pancreas may ultimately leave it unable to keep up with the body's need for insulin. Also, insulin itself becomes less effective at processing sugar; both conditions contribute to the risk of developing diabetes.**\n\nTake a look at the ingredients list for any soda and chances are most of those ingredients are derived from corn. As much as 88 percent of the corn grown in the U.S. is genetically modified to resist toxic pesticides or engineered to create pesticides within the plant itself. Thanks to lax government safety regulations, and tight corporate control over who gets to test these proprietary seeds, there are no human studies that can prove or disprove whether these crops are safe. Independent scientists have found that, in animals, genetically modified crops, or GMOs, are linked to digestive tract damage, accelerated aging, and even infertility. Most recently, scientists in France found that rats fed GMO corn for their entire two-year lifespan developed mammary tumors and died earlier than rats that ate non-GMO corn their entire lives.\n\n**Soft drink consumption is a strong predictor of heartburn.**\n\nAspartame, commonly known as nutrasweet, is a chemical that stimulates the brain to think the food is sweet. It breaks down into acpartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol at a temperature of 86 degrees. (Remember, your stomach is somewhere around 98 degrees.) An article put out by the University of Texas found that aspartame has been linked to obesity. The process of stimulating the brain causes more cravings for sweets and leads to carbohydrate loading.\n\n**Soda eats up and dissolves the tooth enamel. Researches say that soft drinks are responsible for doubling or tripling the incidence of tooth decay. The acidity can dissolve the mineral content of the enamel, making the teeth weaker, more sensitive, and more susceptible to decay. Soda's acidity makes it even worse for teeth than the solid sugar found in candy. Dental experts continue to urge that people drink less soda pop, especially between meals, to prevent tooth decay and dental erosion.**\n\nExperts have reasons to believe that overconsumption of fructose, particularly in the form of soft drinks, leads to an increase in blood pressure.\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size = 12 fl oz (of coke)\nCalories: 98\nCarbs: 27 g\nSodium: 9 mg\nCaffeine: 24 mg\n\n*Links*: [Source 1](http://www.rodale.com/facts-about-soda?page=1)\n\n[Source 20](http://www.livestrong.com/article/475742-what-are-benefits-of-drinking-coke/)\n\n[Source 3](http://health.yahoo.net/experts/drmao/what-soft-drinks-are-doing-your-body)\n\n[Source 4](http://www.emedexpert.com/tips/soft-drinks.shtml)\n\n[Source 5](http://www.quitehealthy.com/nutrition-facts/coke/SD1771.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en2vr/soda/", "created_utc": 1368985854.0, "score": 44, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 18, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1en2vr/soda/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "Kale", "selftext": "Per calorie, kale has more iron than beef. Iron is essential for good health, such as the formation of hemoglobin and enzymes, transporting oxygen to various parts of the body, cell growth, proper liver function and more.\n\n**Eating a diet high in Vitamin K can help protect against various cancers. It is also necessary for a wide variety of bodily functions including normal bone health and the prevention of blood clotting. Also increased levels of vitamin K can help people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Eat More Kale!**\n\nEating more kale can help lower cholesterol levels.\n\n**Sick of spending money on anti-wrinkle creams? Eat more kale.  It's a superstar in the arena of carotenoids and flavonoids, two powerful antioxidants that protect our cells from free radicals that cause oxidative stress. With the addition of high doses of celebrity antioxidants vitamin C, vitamin A, and manganese, kale is a smart choice in the battle against cellular oxidation.**\n\nOne cup of kale provides about 10% of the RDA of omega-3 fatty acids that helps regulate the body\u2019s inflammatory process.  A megadose of vitamin K further aids to fight against excessive inflammatory-related problems, such as arthritis, autoimmune disorders, and asthma. Kale's whopping dose of vitamin K (there's 1327% of the RDA in one cup) is necessary for the synthesis of osteocalcin, a protein that strengthens the composition of our bones.\n\n**With over 192% of the RDA of vitamin A, one cup of kale keeps our eyesight sharp, is an effective antioxidant, boosts immunity, maintains healthy bones and teeth, prevents urinary stones, and is essential to our reproductive organs. Kale also has plenty of star anti-oxidant vitamin C, which lowers blood pressure, ensures a healthy immune system, and fights against age-related ocular diseases, such as cataracts and macular degeneration.**\n\nKale can be likened to the superhero of vegetables, especially green leafy ones. Deep green kale contains the highest levels of antioxidants of all vegetables. Kale's high content of flavonoids and antioxidants work together to prevent and even combat cancer, in particular colon, breast, bladder, prostate, ovarian cancers, and gastric cancer.\n\n**One cup of kale contains nearly 20% of the RDA of dietary fiber, which promotes regular digestion, prevents constipation, lowers blood sugar and curbs overeating. Kale contains the glucosinolate isothiocyanate (ITC) that fights the formation of H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori), a bacterial growth in the stomach lining that can lead to gastric cancer.**\n\nThe high fiber content of kale lowers our cholesterol by binding with bile acids that the liver produces from cholesterol for digesting fat. Because many of these bile acids are coupled with fiber, the liver is charged with producing more bile acid to digest fat, and therefore requires more cholesterol to so, ultimately lowering the amount of cholesterol within our bodies.\n\n**Per calorie, kale has more calcium than milk, which aids in preventing bone loss, preventing osteoporosis and maintaining a healthy metabolism. Vitamin C is also helpful to maintain cartilage and joint flexibility.**\n\nThe healthy balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids keep your body strong, healthy and beautiful from the inside out. Kale\u2019s concentration of major nutrients gives your skin\u2019s health and appearance a boost.\n\n\n**Avoid eating large amounts of kale on a daily basis (or juicing). Kale has been shown to have the ability to drastically change your thyroid. If you already have thyroid problems, hypothyroidism in particular, you should consult with your doctor on how much kale you should consume on a daily or weekly basis.**\n\n*Nutritional Facts*: Serving Size: 1 cup, chopped (67.0 g) \nCalories: 34\nCalories from fat: 4\nTotal Fat:  0.5g\nSaturated Fat:   0.1g\nPolyunsaturated Fat:   0.2g\nMonounsaturated Fat:   0.0g\nCholesterol: 0mg\nSodium:   29mg1%\nTotal Carbohydrates:  6.7g\nDietary Fiber:  1.3g\nProtein:   2.2g\nVitamin A:   206%\nVitamin B6: 15%\nVitamin C:  134%\nVitamin K:  1,020%\nCalcium:     16%\nIron:          6%\nMagnesium: 40%\n\n*Links*: [Source 1](http://www.vegkitchen.com/nutrition/5-top-health-benefits-of-kale/)\n\n[Source 2](http://www.greensmoothiedietetics.com/2/post/2011/12/kale-6-good-reasons-to-eat-it.html)\n\n[Source 3](http://www.onlyfoods.net/kale.html)\n\n[Source 4](http://www.m.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/the-truth-about-kale)\n\n[Source 5](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-4408/Top-10-Health-Benefits-of-Eating-Kale.html)\n\n[Source 6](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-4408/Top-10-Health-Benefits-of-Eating-Kale.html)\n\n\n[Source 7](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/hypothyroidism)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1e6bro/kale/", "created_utc": 1368347526.0, "score": 32, "author": "gallemore", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/WhatYouEat/comments/1e6bro/kale/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Bananas", "selftext": "EDIT - **TL;DR - PROS: Bananas help with alertness, blood sugar, nausea, fever, smoking withdrawal effects, stomach ulcers, acid reflux, digestion issues, swelling, anemia, low mood, sweet cravings, muscles in the heart and nervous system, calcium loss, and more. CONS: None.**\n\n*Pros*\n\nBananas make you smarter and help with learning by making you more alert. Eat a banana before an exam to benefit from the high levels of potassium.\n\n**Bananas are high in antioxidants, providing free radicals and protection from chronic disease.**\n\nEating a banana between meals helps stabilize blood sugar and reduce nausea from morning sickness.\n\n**Control blood sugar and avoid binging between meals by eating a banana.**\n\nEating a banana can lower the body temperature and cool you during a fever or on a hot day.\n\n**Quitting smoking? Bananas contain high levels of B-vitamins as well as potassium and magnesium speed recovery from the effects of withdrawal.**\n\nBananas are the only raw fruit that can be consumed without distress to relieve stomach ulcers by coating the lining of the stomach against corrosive acids.\n\n**Bananas are a natural antacid, providing relief from acid reflux, heartburn and GERD.**\n\nGot the runs? Bananas are soothing to the digestive tract and help restore lost electrolytes after diarrhea.\n\n**Constipated? High fiber in bananas can help normalize bowel motility.**\n\nBananas act as a prebiotic, stimulating the growth of friendly bacteria in the bowel. They also produce digestive enzymes to assist in absorbing nutrients.\n\n**Rich in pectin, bananas aid digestion and gently chelate toxins and heavy metals from the body**\n\nStrengthen your blood and relieve anemia with the added iron from bananas\n\n**Bananas reduce swelling, protect against type II diabetes, aid weight loss, strengthen the nervous system, and help with the production of white blood cells, all due to high levels of vitamin B-6**\n\nBananas contain a natural mood enhancer, tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts to serotonin. Serotonin is known to make the body feel relaxed and improves good mood thus preventing seasonal depression.\n\n**Because of their great taste, they can also serve as a substitute for sweets to satisfy sugar cravings. The convenience and nutritional value of bananas make them good post-exercise snack. During long exercises, bananas can give the immediate energy you need.**\n\nBananas contain a high dose of potassium - an essential ingredient to keep your heart and nervous system in good shape. Potassium is essential for proper muscle contraction and hence plays an important role in muscle-influenced activities including: the normal rhythmic pumping of the heart, digestion, muscular movements, etc., Some studies have also linked low potassium intake to high blood pressure and increased risk of stroke.\n\n**Benefits to the kidneys and the bones are again due to the high potassium content of bananas. A normal intake of potassium suppresses calcium excretion in the urine and minimizes the risk of kidney stones.
