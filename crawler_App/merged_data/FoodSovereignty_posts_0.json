{"title": "Food Security vs. Food Sovereignty", "selftext": "The terms food security and food sovereignty are often used interchangeably. I have always been a bit confused by these concepts so I did a little research and this is what I have found. Feel free to comment and let me know what you think.\n\nThe state of being food secure is when a community has sufficient availability and access to safe, nutritious foods. \u2018Sufficient,\u2019 in this case, refers to foods being able to meet the dietary needs and preferences of a community. Food security does not always specify the types of foods being provided, where these foods are coming from, or level of community involvement. Many food security projects start as disaster relief projects requiring immediate food sources. In emergency situations it is often easier to bring food in from outside sources than source food from devastated local communities. When food imports increase, local producers lose business, while community food security seemingly increases. But as local producers go out of business the community becomes increasingly dependent on imports, which creates a cycle of perpetual dependence on outside markets. This is where food sovereignty differs from food security. \n\nFood sovereignty is a more specific than food security in that it requires a greater level of community involvement. The state of being food sovereign is when the community itself is capable of producing \u201chealthy and culturally appropriate foods that are produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. This includes the community right to define their own food and agriculture system\u201d(Via Campesina 2009)(Alkon and Mares p. 347).  While food sovereign communities may have varying degrees of independence, they all share the common resources needed to regulate their food systems from within.

{"title": "Food Sovereignty in Puerto Rico", "selftext": "Food Sovereignty advocates for the right of communities to determine how and where they want their food to be produced and processed. It is an international, grassroots movement led by peasant farmers who are educating citizens and challenging companies and governments for change. One of the most prominent groups championing food sovereignty is La V\u00eda Campesina, and since their founding in 1989, many local organizations around the world have joined under their umbrella. One of these organizations is Organizaci\u00f3n Boricu\u00e1 de Agricultura Agroecologica (Boricu\u00e1). Boricu\u00e1 is a group in Puerto Rico that has been promoting agroecological practices on the island for over 30 years. They noticed that local knowledge about agriculture was being lost to industrial food production, and initiated a campaign to re-establish traditional knowledge. Since then, many different farms have joined their network. \n\nA bulk of Boricu\u00e1\u2019s work consists of solidarity brigades, wherein farmers go out to other farms and help establish projects, upkeep, or just provide a helping hand. They also do education and promotion of agroecological practices.\n\nIn 2017, hurricanes Irma and Mar\u00eda collectively destroyed over 80% of Puerto Rico\u2019s agriculture. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, Boricu\u00e1\u2019s farms ensured that their respective communities had food, because their mixed agriculture systems ensured that some of the crop was saved. However, as hurricane recovery shifted into the long terms, and damaged farms struggled to recover, it was other organizations not affiliated with Boricu\u00e1 that took the mantle in organizing relief work. El departamento de la Food, for example, which was a restaurant/ vegetable supplier, set a goal to carry out 200 solidarity brigades over two years. They were able to mobilize people on a level that Boricu\u00e1 never could. \n\nGiven this, some interesting questions arise. Was the effectivity of El Departamento de la Comida solidarity brigades brought on by the hurricane itself, or would they have been able to rally folks regardless? Does the fact that they\u2019re not associated directly with Boricu\u00e1 have sociopolitical implications for their work? Alternatively, can their work be called Food Sovereignty even if it is not explicitly stated as so? In situations like this, how do we value intention versus outcome?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "created_utc": 1557172671.0, "score": 7, "author": "Correct_Customer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

The Niriqatiginnga project has this small, super awesome team of youth and artists who are planning to launch their own food products for sale this fall and winter. They're planning to go out on the tundra and harvest a whole bunch of delicious cloudberries, and then conceptualize and design a whole campaign from start to finish. They're learning to plan events, media, digital and food sector literacy and career skills.\n\nWith all of these activities being developmental and emergent in nature, they are actively looking to build relationships and engage with grocery stores, gift shops and distributors who might want to order their creations. They\u2019re also seeking food sector input and networking to give them a bit of advice and guidance as we collectively learn and grow. \n\nThey're also hoping that people will support in sharing this post, and passing along within their networks. This could make a huge difference to the youth entrepreneurs and their project. Please pass it along to those who might be interested, and encourage them to reach out to them!\n\nIt's a great example of youth contributing to addressing northern food insecurity head on. \n\nYou can read the whole article here: \n\nIndigenous Youth Entrepreneurs plan seasonal food production project  [https://niriqatiginnga.ca/news/manitoba-youth-food-product-development/](https://niriqatiginnga.ca/news/manitoba-youth-food-product-development/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/1ca2re6/indigenous_youth_entrepreneurs_plan_seasonal_food/", "created_utc": 1713763499.0, "score": 5, "author": "Niriqatiginnga", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/1ca2re6/indigenous_youth_entrepreneurs_plan_seasonal_food/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Volunteer writers needed for agricultural database (wiki) on food security website", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI run a small web-site \u2013 [AGROAM](http://www.agroam.org). Primarily, we work on providing technical and informational solutions to problems facing the agricultural community in developing countries. We do this both with an online platform (which I\u2019ve linked to above) and a premium SMS platform which mimics most of the functionality of the site (putting people in contact with buyers, help people check prices, etc).\n\nIn one of our previous [posts](http://www.agroam.org/blog/when-data-isnt-enough-keeping-agriculturalists-informed-via-the-new-traditional/), we discussed how we can provide certain data well, but have issues with other types, where complicated ideas need to be brought forward.\n\nWe thought about some solutions to this, and generally what farmers are looking for in developing countries and we realized a wiki might be useful. We get decent traffic from developing countries and have several large scale projects lined up to bring in even more. Most questions we come across are along the lines of \u201cI grow Y but I am thinking about growing X - does anyone have experience growing X?\u201d\n\nWe think a low level agricultural wiki explaining the basics of how to grow various crops would be a large benefit to the people that stop by our portal. Basic information, such as how to plant, the growth cycle, how to manage the item, what pests to watch out for, etc. We understand that most farming is highly contextual based on various climatic and economic conditions, but even very broad amount of information could help spur some growth.\n\nIf there are people willing to help, we just deployed [our wiki software](http://www.agroam.org/agro_wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) (not linked to on our main site).\n\nI will be answering any questions about this for the next 5 hours.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnthony\n\n**tl;dr \u2013 We run a website for farmers in developing countries and think having basic farming information would help cover a lot of gaps in local knowledge.

{"title": "Call for papers on Geographies of Food ... academia anyone?", "selftext": "Call for Papers\nAssociation of American Geographers Annual Meeting, New York\nFebruary 24\u201328, 2012\n\nSession Organizers: Gina Thornburg (Kansas State University) and Rachelle Beveridge (University of Victoria)\n\nNavigating the Geographies of Food:  People, Place, Culture, and Power\n\nWe seek papers using a diversity of perspectives on agrifood geographies that focus, in particular, on the people, places, cultures, and power relations in emerging hybrid networks of food production, processing, distribution, retailing, and consumption. The notion of hybridity has been used to help conceptualize the \u201cblurring between conventional and alternative food supply systems\u201d (Ilbery & Maye, 2005), since the \u201cbinary opposites\u201d of so-called conventional and alternative food activities \u201care not as simple and clear-cut\u201d as much discourse generated by actors in alternative agrifood movements might indicate. The interconnections arising from both alternative and conventional food activities between and within wild, rural, suburban, and urban areas have a wide range of effects across communities in developed and developing nations. Scholars increasingly turn their attention to examining, measuring, and understanding these effects.\n\nThe cultural and political ecology of human-environment relations comes to life through the subject of food. Critical questions concerning the burgeoning alternative (or hybrid) food economy may encompass the following: Who is included and who is excluded in new alternative or hybrid activities? What actors are attracted and involved in these activities? How durable are new approaches to food production, provisioning, and distribution? What cultures or traditions are being created, attenuated, revived, and/or strengthened through alternative or hybrid agrifood practices and activities? What is the role of the state and/or supranational regulatory bodies in these activities?\n\nThese sessions invite an array of methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of food and food systems at a variety of scales. Accordingly, they will examine interconnections between various actors, places, institutions, and networks related to food production, processing, distribution, preparation, retailing and marketing, and consumption, and their social, cultural, political, and environmental outcomes.\n\nTopics might include alternative agrifood movements and institutions; shortened agrifood-supply chains; food security and sovereignty; local, regional, and global food systems; defensive localism; food availability and accessibility; food and inequality; food trade; food and public health; foodsheds; state policy; supranational and private regulatory bodies; food aid; globalization; food and development; subsistence; food identities and cultures; feminism and food; decommodification of food; alternative distribution systems; farm-to-institution; community-supported agriculture; marketing local foods; food safety and quality; traditional foods; the role of industry and retailers; farmers markets; school food; community gardens; squatters\u2019 gardens; and more.\n\nInstructions: If you are interested in participating in these sessions please register for the 2012 meeting and submit an abstract.  Send your abstract and your Program Identification Number (PIN) to either Gina Thornburg (gkt@ksu.edu) or Rachelle Beveridge (rbeverid@uvic.ca) by Sunday, September 18.\n\nSorry if this is not what you are looking for in r/foodsovereignty.

Sterritt, the executive director of Coastal First Nations, added that \"we unequivocally maintain our ban on oil tankers on the coast.\"It was Mr. Daniels, of Enbridge, who spoke of wanting a fresh start with the Coastal First Nation. Sterritt, on behalf of the board, told Daniels that a fresh start from the Coastal First Nations perspective meant having Enbridge ask the Joint Review Panel (JRP) to stand down.\n\n \n\n\"The Joint Review Process is seen by the Coastal First Nations not as objective, rather as a process that advances the Enbridge Project.\" Subsequently the Coastal First Nations has been informed that Enbridge is not prepared to ask the JRP to stand down or reveal who the other proponents are, he said.\n\n \n\nIn August of 2009, Enbridge stated that the proposed project would not go ahead if First Nations communities opposed it, said Sterritt. \"None of our communities support the project. Nor do any First Nations along the pipeline route.\"\n\n \n\n\"Why would we support a proposal that would put our rivers, oceans and lifesource at risk?\" Sterritt said. \"It's time Pat Daniels and Enbridge take the correct action and give us the fresh start they promised.

Food Sovereignty in Canada explores how communities all over the country are actively engaged in implementing alternative agricul\u00adtural and food models within the framework of food sovereignty \u2014 taking control over food-producing resources, markets and agricultural policy. This framework offers Canadian citizens, researchers and policymakers the opportunity to build alternative agricultural and food models that are less environmentally damaging and that keep farmers on the land while ensuring that those living in cities have access to healthy and safe food.

{"title": "Food Sovereignty in Puerto Rico", "selftext": "Food Sovereignty advocates for the right of communities to determine how and where they want their food to be produced and processed. It is an international, grassroots movement led by peasant farmers who are educating citizens and challenging companies and governments for change. One of the most prominent groups championing food sovereignty is La V\u00eda Campesina, and since their founding in 1989, many local organizations around the world have joined under their umbrella. One of these organizations is Organizaci\u00f3n Boricu\u00e1 de Agricultura Agroecologica (Boricu\u00e1). Boricu\u00e1 is a group in Puerto Rico that has been promoting agroecological practices on the island for over 30 years. They noticed that local knowledge about agriculture was being lost to industrial food production, and initiated a campaign to re-establish traditional knowledge. Since then, many different farms have joined their network. \n\nA bulk of Boricu\u00e1\u2019s work consists of solidarity brigades, wherein farmers go out to other farms and help establish projects, upkeep, or just provide a helping hand. They also do education and promotion of agroecological practices.\n\nIn 2017, hurricanes Irma and Mar\u00eda collectively destroyed over 80% of Puerto Rico\u2019s agriculture. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, Boricu\u00e1\u2019s farms ensured that their respective communities had food, because their mixed agriculture systems ensured that some of the crop was saved. However, as hurricane recovery shifted into the long terms, and damaged farms struggled to recover, it was other organizations not affiliated with Boricu\u00e1 that took the mantle in organizing relief work. El departamento de la Food, for example, which was a restaurant/ vegetable supplier, set a goal to carry out 200 solidarity brigades over two years. They were able to mobilize people on a level that Boricu\u00e1 never could. \n\nGiven this, some interesting questions arise. Was the effectivity of El Departamento de la Comida solidarity brigades brought on by the hurricane itself, or would they have been able to rally folks regardless? Does the fact that they\u2019re not associated directly with Boricu\u00e1 have sociopolitical implications for their work? Alternatively, can their work be called Food Sovereignty even if it is not explicitly stated as so? In situations like this, how do we value intention versus outcome?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "created_utc": 1557172671.0, "score": 9, "author": "Correct_Customer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Food Security vs. Food Sovereignty", "selftext": "The terms food security and food sovereignty are often used interchangeably. I have always been a bit confused by these concepts so I did a little research and this is what I have found. Feel free to comment and let me know what you think.\n\nThe state of being food secure is when a community has sufficient availability and access to safe, nutritious foods. \u2018Sufficient,\u2019 in this case, refers to foods being able to meet the dietary needs and preferences of a community. Food security does not always specify the types of foods being provided, where these foods are coming from, or level of community involvement. Many food security projects start as disaster relief projects requiring immediate food sources. In emergency situations it is often easier to bring food in from outside sources than source food from devastated local communities. When food imports increase, local producers lose business, while community food security seemingly increases. But as local producers go out of business the community becomes increasingly dependent on imports, which creates a cycle of perpetual dependence on outside markets. This is where food sovereignty differs from food security. \n\nFood sovereignty is a more specific than food security in that it requires a greater level of community involvement. The state of being food sovereign is when the community itself is capable of producing \u201chealthy and culturally appropriate foods that are produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. This includes the community right to define their own food and agriculture system\u201d(Via Campesina 2009)(Alkon and Mares p. 347).  While food sovereign communities may have varying degrees of independence, they all share the common resources needed to regulate their food systems from within.

{"title": "Call for papers on Geographies of Food ... academia anyone?", "selftext": "Call for Papers\nAssociation of American Geographers Annual Meeting, New York\nFebruary 24\u201328, 2012\n\nSession Organizers: Gina Thornburg (Kansas State University) and Rachelle Beveridge (University of Victoria)\n\nNavigating the Geographies of Food:  People, Place, Culture, and Power\n\nWe seek papers using a diversity of perspectives on agrifood geographies that focus, in particular, on the people, places, cultures, and power relations in emerging hybrid networks of food production, processing, distribution, retailing, and consumption. The notion of hybridity has been used to help conceptualize the \u201cblurring between conventional and alternative food supply systems\u201d (Ilbery & Maye, 2005), since the \u201cbinary opposites\u201d of so-called conventional and alternative food activities \u201care not as simple and clear-cut\u201d as much discourse generated by actors in alternative agrifood movements might indicate. The interconnections arising from both alternative and conventional food activities between and within wild, rural, suburban, and urban areas have a wide range of effects across communities in developed and developing nations. Scholars increasingly turn their attention to examining, measuring, and understanding these effects.\n\nThe cultural and political ecology of human-environment relations comes to life through the subject of food. Critical questions concerning the burgeoning alternative (or hybrid) food economy may encompass the following: Who is included and who is excluded in new alternative or hybrid activities? What actors are attracted and involved in these activities? How durable are new approaches to food production, provisioning, and distribution? What cultures or traditions are being created, attenuated, revived, and/or strengthened through alternative or hybrid agrifood practices and activities? What is the role of the state and/or supranational regulatory bodies in these activities?\n\nThese sessions invite an array of methodological and theoretical approaches to the study of food and food systems at a variety of scales. Accordingly, they will examine interconnections between various actors, places, institutions, and networks related to food production, processing, distribution, preparation, retailing and marketing, and consumption, and their social, cultural, political, and environmental outcomes.\n\nTopics might include alternative agrifood movements and institutions; shortened agrifood-supply chains; food security and sovereignty; local, regional, and global food systems; defensive localism; food availability and accessibility; food and inequality; food trade; food and public health; foodsheds; state policy; supranational and private regulatory bodies; food aid; globalization; food and development; subsistence; food identities and cultures; feminism and food; decommodification of food; alternative distribution systems; farm-to-institution; community-supported agriculture; marketing local foods; food safety and quality; traditional foods; the role of industry and retailers; farmers markets; school food; community gardens; squatters\u2019 gardens; and more.\n\nInstructions: If you are interested in participating in these sessions please register for the 2012 meeting and submit an abstract.  Send your abstract and your Program Identification Number (PIN) to either Gina Thornburg (gkt@ksu.edu) or Rachelle Beveridge (rbeverid@uvic.ca) by Sunday, September 18.\n\nSorry if this is not what you are looking for in r/foodsovereignty.

{"title": "Food Sovereignty in Puerto Rico", "selftext": "Food Sovereignty advocates for the right of communities to determine how and where they want their food to be produced and processed. It is an international, grassroots movement led by peasant farmers who are educating citizens and challenging companies and governments for change. One of the most prominent groups championing food sovereignty is La V\u00eda Campesina, and since their founding in 1989, many local organizations around the world have joined under their umbrella. One of these organizations is Organizaci\u00f3n Boricu\u00e1 de Agricultura Agroecologica (Boricu\u00e1). Boricu\u00e1 is a group in Puerto Rico that has been promoting agroecological practices on the island for over 30 years. They noticed that local knowledge about agriculture was being lost to industrial food production, and initiated a campaign to re-establish traditional knowledge. Since then, many different farms have joined their network. \n\nA bulk of Boricu\u00e1\u2019s work consists of solidarity brigades, wherein farmers go out to other farms and help establish projects, upkeep, or just provide a helping hand. They also do education and promotion of agroecological practices.\n\nIn 2017, hurricanes Irma and Mar\u00eda collectively destroyed over 80% of Puerto Rico\u2019s agriculture. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, Boricu\u00e1\u2019s farms ensured that their respective communities had food, because their mixed agriculture systems ensured that some of the crop was saved. However, as hurricane recovery shifted into the long terms, and damaged farms struggled to recover, it was other organizations not affiliated with Boricu\u00e1 that took the mantle in organizing relief work. El departamento de la Food, for example, which was a restaurant/ vegetable supplier, set a goal to carry out 200 solidarity brigades over two years. They were able to mobilize people on a level that Boricu\u00e1 never could. \n\nGiven this, some interesting questions arise. Was the effectivity of El Departamento de la Comida solidarity brigades brought on by the hurricane itself, or would they have been able to rally folks regardless? Does the fact that they\u2019re not associated directly with Boricu\u00e1 have sociopolitical implications for their work? Alternatively, can their work be called Food Sovereignty even if it is not explicitly stated as so? In situations like this, how do we value intention versus outcome?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "created_utc": 1557172671.0, "score": 9, "author": "Correct_Customer", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/FoodSovereignty/comments/blguax/food_sovereignty_in_puerto_rico/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
