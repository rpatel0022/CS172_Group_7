I successfully revived my grandma's rye starter that had spent at least a decade in the back of the freezer, and made bread with it!\n\nIt's not the prettiest loaf and the crumb is a bit dense, but I'll chalk that up to my lack of experience. It was still a pleasant slice of bread and I'm satisfied with the results! The taste was fairly mild but enjoyable with noticeable sourness but not a lot of tang. I'll probably add more rye to the dough in the future since I really liked its taste. There's still some of the starter in the freezer and I'll definitely come back to it later! For now I'll keep feeding this starter and make it my own.\n\nI want to thank everyone for your interest, advice and nice words! I was kinda surprised by all the positivity in this community. You guys made this experience even more fun! I still haven't decided on a name for the starter. I might name it after grandma. Either that or Cryo-rye-o.\n\nHere's the recipe:\n\n-100g grandma's frozen rye starter\n\n-300g wheat flour (12% protein)\n\n-40g rye flour (10% protein)\n\n-225g water\n\n-9g salt\n\nI mixed everything up and gave it a couple sets of stretch and folds in the first hour.

{"title": "Currently in tears", "selftext": "So about three weeks ago, I revived a sourdough starter I had in the fridge for a year. This had been a 100 year old starter, the story being it survived even being moved on covered wagon across the Oregon trail. My uncle gave me some a year ago but I never got into baking.\n\nWell, I decided to change that (hence the reviving three weeks ago). It took about a week to get bubbly again and I had renamed her. I made my first two loaves and a batch of bagels shortly thereafter. For about 1 week, it\u2019s been in the fridge between feedings. \n\nWell, a couple of days ago I was working a ten hour shift and I come home to the fridge cleaned, thought nothing of it. Today I go to find some jarred garlic and notice there\u2019s a little more space in the top shelf of the door. Well. Long story short, my stepdad threw out the whole jar- not even dumped it and left it to wash, the whole thing. This was my baby. I\u2019m devastated. This week I was going to make dried discard so I could revive her if need be but now it\u2019s too late. \n\nThe worst part is he saw me making sourdough and even asked \u201cwhat is that?\u201d To my jar with the rubber band around it in the fridge. Either he forgot or simply didn\u2019t care but he threw it out. I\u2019m just sad. \n\nI was just beginning my hobby, bought all of the things and now? I know I could make a new one but that\u2019s not the point. I basically rebirthed that thing from the depths of hell! Anyway, just a little rant to someone who might care. \n\nTl;dr: stepdad threw away my baby\nPicture for memorial.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/zlirh9fqg5oe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1741737824.0, "score": 2727, "author": "justcurrentthoughts", "num_comments": 185, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1j95qql/currently_in_tears/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My first discard bagels", "selftext": "I wanted to use my sourdough discard in my bagels. My starter is 2 weeks old and I still haven\u2019t used it to make bread. I used the following rule to tweak my usual bagel recipe to include the discard : \n\n1. Choose a starter discard quantity you want to add to the recipe (I used 200gr)\n2. Divide that number by 2 (so 100 gr)\n3. Substract this amount of flour AND water of the original recipe (so I remove 100 gr of flour and 100 gr of water from my bagel recipe)\n\nBecause I\u2019m using a dough improver and I wasn\u2019t really sure how the dough would behave with the discard, I did not use all of the water required. My starter was not at peak when used it in the recipe (quite the contrary, it was fed 1:1:1 the day before in the morning). \n\nHere are the quantities I used (for 6 bagels of 137 gr each) : \n\n- Flour (Caputo Manitoba) : 443 gr\n- Room temp water (Evian): 140,7 gr instead of the 158 gr required by the rule mentioned above. \n- Starter : 200 gr\n- Barley malt syrup : 23,7 gr\n- Sunflower oil : 16,3 gr\n- Dark brown sugar : 11,8 gr \n- Salt : 13,6 gr \n- Dough improver : 10,9 gr \n- Yeast (instant dry) : 2,7 gr \n\nThe dough felt a touch too dry, maybe lacking a few grams of water, but that\u2019s not a big deal. Knead this dough for 30 minutes total in my 6,9L KitchenAid, until totally smooth (it passed the windowpane test, very strong gluten network). After shaping, 1 hour room temp proof until it passes the float test, then fridge for 29 hours.\n\nBoiled in barley malt syrup for 25 seconds on each side. Baked at 250\u00baC for 5 minutes, then 13 minutes at 220-230\u00baC.\n\nI think those are the best bagels I\u2019ve ever made. The crust is thin but still noticeable, with a powerful malt flavor.

{"title": "Todays loaf and some advice after making 100+ loaves over 6 years", "selftext": "Would like to add some value to my post, as I typically just post my loaf with a description of the recipe and abbreviated technique.  \n\n1. Wait for your starter to mature.  If it\u2019s doubling jn 3 days, it\u2019s not ready.  Feed and grow your starter for at least 2-3 weeks before using it for the first time\n\n2. Incorporate some sort of rye or whole wheat into your starter.  100% AP flour starters will not be as robust as one with some degree of higher protein flours.  I have found 30% whole wheat to be the sweet spot\n\n3.  Get to know your starter.  Understand what peak rise looks like in your starter so that you know when it\u2019s at peak activity.  My starter will triple when it\u2019s at peak - if I were to use it at double (like most resources say is sufficient), I\u2019d be missing peak activity. \n\n4. Feed your starter for a few days before you\u2019re ready to bake.  Feed it once a day - twice daily feedings, although useful when first starting the starter, won\u2019t usually leave enough of the residual starter to get sufficient growth and you sort of start to work against yourself \n\n5. Find or design a recipe for a loaf and stick to it - if you\u2019re beginning, choose a recipe that\u2019s simple and has no more than 2 different types of flour (ideally 60-75% white flour, and the rest your adjunct of choice).  I would advise against rye until you\u2019re more experienced as it will create a very sticky dough that can be difficult to work with.\n\n6. Hydration - ditch anything over 80-85% unless you\u2019re making ciabatta.  75-78% is all you need to make supple, airy bread.\n\n7. 15-20% starter is ideal.  The exact amount will depend on your environment, leading to my next point:\n\n8. Know your environment.  Know the temperature of your kitchen/wherever you\u2019ll be proofing the dough.  My kitchen is 75 in the summer and 68 in the winter.  This matters and will dictate if I use 15% or 20% starter.  It\u2019s also good to take a few data points - what is the temp of the final dough?  This will guide how long you can expect to ferment.  Most of this can be taken out of the equation if you get a proofer that\u2019ll keep a consistent temp for your bulk fermentation (using this method, I\u2019m able to guarantee 78F the entire bulk).\n\n9. Ditch the stretch and folds.  Coil folds coil folds coil folds.  At least 4 total.  Try to space them every 40 mins during your bulk. \n\n10. Even with data - know what your dough looks like when your bulk is done.  Ferment your dough in the same container and understand what your dough looks like when your bulk is done and it\u2019s ready to be shaped.  The poke test is ok, but is really inconsistent in my experience.  A lot of what leads to a good loaf is just understanding what your dough is trying to tell you.\n\n11.  Batards are easier to shape than boules (in my opinion).  FWSY will have you think differently.  This is subjective. \n\n12. If your bulk takes 7 hours (like mine does), shape the dough at 6 hours, let it continue to rise in the banneton for 30 mins, then start your cold proof at 6:30.  The dough takes time to cool down and will continue to rise a bit in the fridge.\n\n13. The next day, get the oven and your Dutch HOT.  525F.  Put the loaf in the freezer while the oven/dutch preheat.  This will make the dough easier to score.\n\n14. Bake 525 for 1/3 of your baking time and 500 for the rest.  You\u2019d be surprised what the higher heat will do for your oven spring.  \n\n15.  Bake with the lid off for 20 mins around 500.  Once done, let it cool COMPLETELY before slicing.\n\nPlease understand that what I\u2019m describing are methods that work for me - my routine may not be something that resonates with other bakers.  I bake with a goal to achieve consistency with my loaves and results I\u2019m happy with (to me).  I am also very Type-A so consistency and processes are important to me in my hobbies.  Many people enjoy making bread a bit more free-spirited, which is perfectly fine!  My OCD would just not allow it lol.  \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the loaf posted in this post followed all of the above advice with the following recipe: 340g high gluten flour, 110g semolina.  78% hydration (355g water), 20% starter, 2% salt.  \n\nHappy baking ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9uhyr", "created_utc": 1737832440.0, "score": 1712, "author": "southside_jim", "num_comments": 141, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1i9uhyr/todays_loaf_and_some_advice_after_making_100/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

It has a bunch of different weights with two types of flour different each day. And it\u2019s just a lot.\n\nBut like, it\u2019s a sourdough starter. It\u2019s only 2 ingredients at its most simplified state. Why make it more confusing?\n\nHere\u2019s how I started my starter that I use now. I mixed water and bread flour until I had a thick paste. No I did not weigh it out. You do not need to do that later. Now just leave that mixture in covered on your countertop for 3 days.\n\nOn the third day peel back the skin and you\u2019ll notice the fermentation. Take a little bit of that and add water and flour until you have a thick paste (no need to weigh). Repeat that for like 8 days. \n\nNow there are two kinds of feeding I do. One when I\u2019m going to use my starter to make some bread. And one for when I\u2019m gonna let it hibernate in the fridge.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use it to make bread. Use a 2/2/1 ratio by weight. 2 parts flour, 2 parts water, 1 part starter. Let that sit for 10 hours and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna let it hibernate. Add a very tiny bit of starter (like 5 grams but I never weigh). Then like 100g of each flour and water.\n\nAnd there you go. Oh want a rye starter or a WW flour starter? Then just substitute all or some of your regular flour with your flour of choice. No you never need to add any sugar, or apples, or anything to your starter to help it. \n\nI based this method off of Alton Browns method. Very simple, stop making it confusing. Please.

{"title": "My first loaf", "selftext": "I have spent countless hours reading about techniques and recipes as well as watching YouTube videos on how other bakers do their thing because, well, I like to ~try~ nail things the first time (I realize this is very hard to achieve with sourdough).

I let it brown a little more than I\u2019d have liked. My most noticeable struggle was with \u201cthe poke test\u201d to see if my proofing was complete. I thought I may have over proofed it and popped it in the fridge overnight with a \u201cwhat will be will be\u201d mentality. This morning I woke up and baked the darn thing and these are the results. I\u2019m happy with it, but I\u2019m curious to see if any seasoned bakers have any thoughts, feelings, suggestions to share? Anything you notice? \n\nMy thoughts are it was not as \u201cblistery\u201d as I was hoping. Does that have to do with the proofing, my starter, or my stretch and folds?

I used my oven with the light on.\n\u2022 One hour before the levain is done, make the dough. In a large bowl, mix together the bread flour and water.\n\u2022 Mix just until your dough comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm area (70\u201380\u00b0F/21\u201327\u00b0C) for 1 hour.\n\u2022 Mix your dough and levain together. Rest for 20 minutes.\n\u2022 Add the salt and all of the remaining water and mix until incorporated. Slap and fold for 2 to 4 minutes or until your dough is smooth and begins to catch some air. Rest 15 minutes in the same warm area.\n\u2022 Perform 6 sets of stretch and folds spaced out by 15 minutes for the first three, then 30 minutes for the last three. Place the dough back in the warm area for each rest.\n\u2022 Let your dough rest for a couple hours, undisturbed.\n\u2022 Dump out and divide your dough into 2 even pieces. Pre-shape each piece into a light boule and rest for 5 to 10 minutes.\n\u2022 Shape each ball dough into a batard, and place into bannetons dusted with either rice flour or all-purpose flour. \n\u2022 Refrigerate overnight.\n\u2022 Preheat cast-iron combo cooker to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) for 1 hour.\n\u2022 Carefully place a dusted loaf into the hot pan, score the top, spray with water, and place the larger lid on top. Bake for 20 minutes.\n\u2022 Remove the top from the combo cooker and lower the oven temperature to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the loaf is a deep brown color.\n\u2022 Remove the bread and cool on a wire rack until room temperature.

I usually wait about 30 to 45 minutes before each stretch and fold continuing to do them over time until I notice some bubbles on too and it's really smooth.

{"title": "Controlled experiment: King Arthur bread flour vs. Bob's Red Mill bread flour", "selftext": "Eta: You guys are so kind with the awards. Thank you.\n\nTl;dr: [results](https://imgur.com/a/r6r9bSz)\n\nHi sourdough fans! I do most of my baking with bread flour from the grocery store (US based), and have recently noticed some differences in the way my bread bakes up using these two brands. On paper, they look similar; Bob's has a slightly higher protein content (6g per 36g serving vs 4g per 30g serving) but doesn't claim a certain % of protein. The website simply gives the protein content at 12-14%. KA lists its protein content at 12.7%. They are both American hard red wheats and contain added malted barley flour. My gut feeling is that the BRM is milled a bit finer, but I'm just going by feel. This week, I wanted to see if the differences I noticed were incidental to the particular day I baked or whether they were still present when controlling for day-to-day variables. So I made 2 batches of bread at the same time with the same recipe, except for the brand of flour.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou0fz4iwfav71.jpg?width=3829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd3b8a995fc00e5491ff52f05db4dcad659e1f2f\n\nFirst, the recipe and method (one batch per flour):\n\nMake levain 2 days before baking (7pm):\n\n17g whole wheat starter\n\n129g water\n\n129g bread flour, either KA or Bob's Red Mill\n\nLet sit at room temp 12 hours\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 day before baking (7am)\n\nAutolyze 60 min:\n\n218g water\n\n372g bread flour (KA or Bob's Red Mill)\n\nAdd 263g levain and mix, rest 30 min\n\nSprinkle 10g salt on top, rest 30 min\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBulk ferment and proof:\n\nMix and laminate after 1 hour\n\n3x stretch and fold every 45 min\n\nNeglect dough for 2 hours while running errands\n\nPre-shape (I made 2 loaves per batch) and let sit 30 min\n\nShape into floured bannetons and cover\n\nProof at room temp 2 hours and then neglect dough another 3 hours because I went out to dinner\n\nPlace bannetons in the fridge for 11 hours\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBake 7am the next day:\n\nScore, spray with water 4-6 times, and place in DO\n\n20 mins @ 485F, remove lid of DO\n\n15 mins @ 450F (note that these are only 350g loaves)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot surprisingly, my dough was a bit overproofed, but at least both batches were overproofed evenly. Luckily my house wasn't very warm (68F/20C). And science goes on! Here are my observations.\n\nStarter: The KA flour rose a bit faster and higher than the BRM, with more bubbles, although the BRM was stringier and had more structure (thicker gluten strands).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uj1p4op6fav71.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8fef8c987bef34ffbfb681f75672212e5bf9c23\n\nMixing: At the autolyze stage, the 2 balls of dough seemed identical, however, after mixing in the levain, the BRM dough immediately became a silky, homogenous mass while the KA dough needed a bit more massaging to reach that smooth ball stage. The BRM dough seemed \"tougher\" and silkier and remained so throughout the rising and shaping process, and was noticeably firmer when I pulled it out of the fridge to bake.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1krub5offav71.jpg?width=3887&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a585d638ae257b8adc49b0ae47e90a879fd7528\n\nBaking: The BRM loaves baked up taller, fluffier and with a bit more oven spring than the KA loaves. As mentioned, I found both batches a tad overproofed but nonetheless, I-would-serve-this-to-guests acceptable. Taste-wise, there wasn't a big difference but the KA loaves were a bit more sour, perhaps because of the extra yeast activity in the starter phase. It's worth noting that my bread turns out \\*quite\\* sour because of the long feeding time of the levain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/haokfxklfav71.jpg?width=3939&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e9f9116c5dfad94dc38e1713dac105a4a6fffca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ei4iltpfav71.jpg?width=3865&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3885e314da5da454de274e2c7c4515549c972d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t626l6wsfav71.jpg?width=2100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38f0b40cf570d92f403483540113bf30e5a939bd\n\nConclusion: As far as readily available supermarket bread flour, Bob's Red Mill makes a super fluffy bread with a fine crumb while King Arthur bakes up a bit heavier, but with more flavor.  For everyday eating with butter, I would use the BRM, but for dipping in soup, KA might be a better choice. Flavor-wise, a little spelt or other whole grain flour would have been a nice addition, but not my goal today. Also, not forgetting your dough for most of the day would be advisable.  :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/qeh1l6/controlled_experiment_king_arthur_bread_flour_vs/", "created_utc": 1635034919.0, "score": 863, "author": "go_west_til_you_cant", "num_comments": 76, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/qeh1l6/controlled_experiment_king_arthur_bread_flour_vs/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Can I cheer? Can I call it a winner?", "selftext": "I\u2019ll be descriptive! \n\nProbably my 10th loaf. I feed my starter a 1:10:10 ratio, typically with bread flour and warmed spring water. I\u2019ve had my starter in the works for a couple months and saw the best results in its activity and strength when I started feeding it daily with the 1:10:10 ratio. \n\n150 g of starter right after peak, 350 g of warm spring water, 500 g of bread flour (sometimes I do 400 g of bread flour and 100 g of whole wheat flour, but this loaf was all bread flour), and 13 g of salt. That\u2019s my preference with the flavor thus far, anything less seems a little bland to me, but that could be because of other previous errors with flavor development. \n\nI don\u2019t do anything fancy with waiting to add the salt or letting the dough rest once it\u2019s mixed. I pour the water in first, then add the starter, whisk the starter until it looks like milk and is frothy on top, then I add the  flour, then the salt. I \u201cdimple\u201d the mixture, then I stab the mixture down with my bowl scraper, then I mix with my bowl scraper. I used my hands after this and make sure to get it all incorporated together, I look for a shaggy texture.\nI might let it rest once it\u2019s all mixed for about 30 minutes, but I usually start the stretch and folds within the hour of initially mixing the ingredients. I did four sets of stretch and folds 40 minutes apart. I finished my stretch and folds around 11:30 AM and let the dough rest to bulk ferment until 6 PM. My house is very cold, and that\u2019s the timeframe it took for it to look bubbly, jiggly, glossy, and about doubled in size. I also came away from the edges of the bowl without much effort and was slightly domed. Bulk fermentation has been something I\u2019ve been trying to hone in on and I think I\u2019m finally understanding it visually. My house is cold, usually around 65\u00b0 so I rest this near my router and modem (sometimes right on top of them) during the stretch and fold and bulk fermentation time. A clear bowl really helps keep visual track of progress during this time. \n\nOnce the bulk fermentation was done in my opinion, I shaped the dough initially and let it rest on the floured counter under the clear bowl it was in for about a half an hour. I did another final shaping after that, flipped it into my oval proofing basket. I covered it with one of those cling wrap elastic bowl covers throughout the entire process, including this step. I left it in the fridge to proof overnight and baked it this morning around 8 AM. I didn\u2019t really let it warm up to room temperature much, I let it sit on the counter in the basket covered fresh out of the fridge only while the oven preheated. I preheated my pan only slightly, I feel like I preheat it too warm at times.\n\nI bake a cast-iron Dutch oven. I don\u2019t usually use parchment paper because it\u2019s not necessary to prevent sticking in my Dutch oven, but that was something that I wasn\u2019t doing previously that everybody else seemed to be doing. I only tried the parchment paper for the first time with this loaf. (I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any other benefits to using parchment paper because the loaf is the prettiest thus far.) I usually just flip my proofed dough into the pan and score it there, but I did the scoring on the parchment paper on the counter before lowering the dough in the dutch to bake. \n\nThis time I preheated the oven to 450\u00b0, baked the loaf, covered for about 20 minutes at 425\u00b0, then another 8 or so minutes at 450\u00b0, and then uncovered for 25 more minutes. I\u2019m still honing in on what my oven does best. \n\nI think I was overlooking how crucial the shaping and scoring steps are to the final rise/\u201cspring\u201d in the oven when baking. I did a simple score down the center starting about halfway down the edge of the end furthest from me, at about a 45\u00b0 angle or so. I tried to go about 1/2 inch deep. I did some decorative little scores on either side of the main score. As far as shaping goes, I don\u2019t think I was shaping with enough tension previously, and that was resulting in some flat and wide loaves.\n\nAny feedback is welcome!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1uv4u", "created_utc": 1740933232.0, "score": 829, "author": "A-RingAroundTheSun", "num_comments": 54, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1j1uv4u/can_i_cheer_can_i_call_it_a_winner/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Welp, this shouldn\u2019t have worked\u2026", "selftext": "So, yesterday, I learned a very important lesson: sourdough is shockingly forgiving.\n\nI accidentally left my proofing box on top of the oven while it was preheating for another bake. Harmless, right? Wrong. The dough hit 88\u00b0F during autolyse and started cooking itself. Yep, lightly cooked dough before I even got to bulk fermentation.\n\nAfter staring at it for a good minute (because obviously that fixes things), I pulled out the cooked bits, threw the rest in the fridge to cool, and just\u2026 kept going. I added a couple extra sets of coil folds to build back some strength, shaped it, and tucked it into the banneton for an overnight cold retard.\n\nThis morning, I honestly wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but the bake turned out solid. The crust is dark and cocoa-rich (no, I didn\u2019t burn it), and the crumb is soft, open, and shiny with streaks of melted chocolate. The flavor isn\u2019t overly sweet\u2014just enough from the chocolate chips to balance the richness.\n\nA little bit of heat, a whole lotta panic, and somehow\u2026. bread! \n\nRecipe by: Breadstalker: Rich Chocolate Chip Sourdough\n\nhttps://www.breadstalker.com/blog/i8ck0i66a7s6ate0ysg0zq1o7z8zoi", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iihyoo", "created_utc": 1738782501.0, "score": 810, "author": "TheUnfollowedLife", "num_comments": 48, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1iihyoo/welp_this_shouldnt_have_worked/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "The right flour changes everything", "selftext": "I've been struggling a bit for the past 6 months or so because my loaves stopped getting the oven spring I used to get before. Couldn't quite pinpoint the problem - I've tried switching flour brands (all with >11% protein content), tweak the fermentation time and experiment with different techniques. Some of these changes brought slight improvements and ultimately led to me understanding the whole process better but didn't give me the oven spring I was going for and the dough always seemed weak even with 68% hydration.\n\nWhen I finished the last bag of \"old\" flour, I opened one that my mom recommended and it turns out that did the trick. This loaf is 70% hydration and the gluten development was really good. The dough held its shape after proofing in the banneton and I feel like it's a huge step in the direction I want my loaves to go. \n\nSo, the takeaway is this: some flours are not strong enough even if their stated protein content is on the higher side.

{"title": "I'm resigning as a mod here and reminiscing about r/sourdough a bit.", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust wanted to drop a post that I'm resigning as a mod here, and to also perhaps reminisce about r/sourdough a bit.\n\nWhy am I resigning? Ultimately because Reddit has been treating mods shittily lately and I've had enough. I'm sure most of you are aware of the blackout protest from June 12, which started out as an admittedly niche thing and mostly something 3rd party app users, mods and the vision impaired and blind cared about. But man it has been badly handled by Reddit management! There has never been any sign of willigness to accomodate or negotiate from Reddit, rather the opposite with outright lying about the Apollo developer and brute forcing changes and actions instead. I get it, Reddit is a business, needs to make money etc. And I'm all for Reddit succeeding. But, many mods like myself have become despondent about the unwillingness to be heard and considered - after all modding is a large amount of free labour, often a labour of love, and this whole thing has been so super awfully handled by the company, who really should fire their spokesperson and think about the impression it is giving the market about how well a Reddit IPO will do and if this is a company you would want to invest in. There is one silver lining - the blind and vision impaired will eventually get mod tools on the official app. That is such a bare minimum of accomodation when you think about it though.\n\nEnough about the depressing stuff.\n\nWhat fun r/sourdough has been! I was initially helping Zippy with the wiki rewrite. If you've never browsed or made edits to our wiki, check out [our page of sourdough heroes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/wiki/new_index_oct_2020/) and I'm always going on about the [aliquot jar technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/wiki/sourdoughbasics/#wiki_aliquot_jar) if you've never heard of it. We've held three [bake clubs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/wiki/bakeclub/) which have been our version of a community bake. And I've made pretty banners for the subreddit, but maybe you don't realise [that all of the pictures come from posts people have made to the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/wiki/banner/). We've had some fascinating pinned posts, deep dives on topics like bulk fermentation in the [\"let's talk about\" series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/wiki/letstalkabout/) and a couple of AMA type posts, with the [bread code, in 'disguise', Hi I'm Hendrik and I bake a lot of bread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/r82i7z/ama_im_hendrik_and_i_bake_bread/) and even [G\u00e9rard Rubaud's apprentice shared!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/nstj54/what_was_it_like_to_apprentice_under_gerard/)\n\nNever mind rule 5 - where we ask for a recipe/method. What a pain (pun intentional!). Many new readers don't know that this is something that was asked for by the community. And it has made our sub what it is today, our sub has beome a distinct place with its own character, it doesn't have an endless stream of pretty Instagram posts (if you want that go to Instagram!), it helps us to offer help when someone has a problem, and if offering a recipe isn't your thing let me refer you to r/breadit which is lovely too but without the rule. And I do believe this distinctness is one of the things that has helped us to grow into a large community, from the 175,000 subscribers when I joined as mod to the 410,000 we have today.\n\nLastly and firstly, I'd like to thank my fellow mods, it has been so lovely doing this with all of you and we work so well together and you guys are such fabulous people.\n\nAnyways, enough rambling, as always keep well and keep baking beautiful breads.\n\nAdieu,\ndesGroles 26/06/2023.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/14jbqrj/im_resigning_as_a_mod_here_and_reminiscing_about/", "created_utc": 1687769223.0, "score": 783, "author": "desGroles", "num_comments": 49, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/14jbqrj/im_resigning_as_a_mod_here_and_reminiscing_about/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I made an app, so making sourdough is easier, and I'm sharing it for free. It's called Sourdough lab.", "selftext": "When I started making sourdough bread 3 years ago **I couldn't find an app I liked.** Generally, they provide fixed recipes that can't be changed or that are very painful to change. Also, the schedules were fixed and didn't adapt when I did a step earlier or later; they don't understand fermentation. After being frustrated and spend a bunch of money on things I didn't like **I decided to code my own**.\n\nSo I built [**Sourdough Lab**](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1565627733) **(**[**https://apps.apple.com/app/id1565627733**](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1565627733)**) and publish it for free.** If you think it's useful to you **feel free to use it**. Here's what I focused on:\n\n* **Set your recipe and schedule based on parameters we all know**: Instead of doing the maths and setting your recipes and schedules, you give the app the parameters (hydration, salt%, levain %, flours mix, bulk fermentation time, proofing time, number of folds, up to 15 parameters currently implemented) and the app makes the math for you.\n* **Plan your bread ahead:** Set the time you want to make your bread and preview at which time will be all the steps. I implemented that so I could plan my day. I work from home and I can set my bread/meetings accordingly \ud83d\ude02.\n* **The schedule adapts to when you finish steps:** Something I felt is that other apps don't understand fermentation. If I do the autolysis late, that should not affect the time I mix the levain with the dough. If I do a fold earlier, I should not stop the bulk fermentation earlier. But if I mix the levain late, the rest of the steps should adapt so the bulk fermentation is not shorter.\n* **Set your presets:** Even if I like to experiment I have my favorite presets.

{"title": "First timer looking for feedback", "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI'm completely new to sourdough and bread making in general, so this was my very first attempt at baking any kind of bread.\n\nToday, I tried making a sourdough boule. It turned out okay-ish (definitely not the prettiest), but I now have a ton of questions!\n\nStarter:\nFrodough is a 19-day-old 50:50 rye and AP flour starter. After a dormant phase early on (to be expected), it began rising reliably around day 6. At 1:1:1, it peaks at about 2.5x after 2.5 hours. At 1:5:5, it nearly quadruples in 5 hours\u2014so it seems fairly active.\n\nMethod:\n1. Mixed 500g of 13% protein strong white bread flour with 375g water, 10g salt, and 100g active starter. (No autolyse or fermentolyse.) Hydration is about 77%, including the starter. Dough and room temp were both 22\u00b0C.\n\n2. Rested for 30 minutes, then did an initial stretch and fold. Switched to coil folds, 4 sets, spaced 30\u201345 minutes apart (when the dough felt relaxed).\n\n3. Dough felt strong and held shape well. Let it continue bulk fermenting at room temp for another 2\u20133 hours. Total bulk: ~5.5 hours.\n\n4. Floured a silicone banneton (shudders) with plenty of bread flour. Let dough rest 15 min on the counter, shaped it tightly (felt smooth and tight, not sticking to hands), and placed it in the banneton. It didn\u2019t stick at this point and held its shape in the banneton... Initially. \n\n5. Cold-proofed for 22 hours. Preheated oven to 500\u00b0C (for 1 hour), baked with lid on for 25 mins, then lid off for 40 mins.\n\nQuestions:\n1. I did a poke test at 5.5 hours\u2014indent remained slightly, so I assumed it would continue fermenting as it cooled in the fridge. Looking at the final crumb, I suspect it was still underproofed looking at some of the larger tunneling. Should I have let it go longer?\n\n2. The dough felt smooth going into the banneton, but after the cold proof, it stuck badly to the silicon banneton and lost all its shape. I nearly put it in the bin, but i'm glad i didn't. I used bread flour for the banneton, but it all seemed to get absorbed into the dough by the following next day. Would a rattan banneton and rice flour work better? Or is there something else I should try? Perhaps lower hydration? \n\n3. There were darker brown spots on the crust\u2014could these be burnt bits of flour that I didn\u2019t brush off properly?\n\n4. The bottom crust was quite thick. Is that due to a \u201cskin\u201d forming during the cold proof, or could it be from excess flour absorbing into the dough? Or is this just typical?\n\nSorry for all the questions! I've been doing a lot of reading and I'm a little addicted. Can\u2019t wait to bake again soon. Thanks so much! - would appreciate any and all advice/feedback. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke6m4x", "created_utc": 1746316333.0, "score": 19, "author": "WannabeBber", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1ke6m4x/first_timer_looking_for_feedback/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Sourdough Pizza!!", "selftext": "I got tired of loafing around with my starter and needed an easy dinner idea so I decided to throw together a quick pizza dough! AMAZING!!! I\u2019m never going back to any other recipe again. Here\u2019s how I did it. \n\nI used:\n1/2 cup of starter\n1 1/2 cups of warm water \n4 cups of flour (I used AP since it was on hand)\n1.5 tsp salt \n2 tbsp olive oil\n\nI mixed the starter and the warm water (95\u00b0) then added the salt until it dissolved. \nNext I mixed in half of the flour and olive oil\nAfter that I mixed the rest of the flour and stretched the dough for about 10 mins. \nFinally, I laid the dough in an oiled bowl with a lid and let it double. It was close after 6 hours so I called it good enough and rolled it out into 2 pizzas while the oven heated up to 475. \n\nAfter the sauce, cheese and toppings were good to go I put it in and baked it for 22 mins, keeping an eye on it the whole time. \n\nWhen it was done I turned off the oven, leaving the door wide open, and let it sit to finish the toppings as the oven cooled for about 10 mins. Then I let it rest on the pan on top of the oven until it was a palatable temp. \n\nWhat I\u2019d do differently: \n\nBread flour (I just used what I had on hand today)\n\nRoll it out a little thicker. The crust was great thin and had zero flop, and that\u2019s what I was going for this time; but a tad thicker would have been perfect. \n\nA slightly longer bulking period and possibly a fridge rest overnight if I did it the day before would likely yield a fluffier more bubbly dough; but this dough was still more than acceptable for the effort put into it. \n\nBetter sauce (I used leftover jar sauce on hand). It was really good but not my usual go to for homemade pizza. \n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nLike any pizza, the secret is quality ingredients and toppings. I used fresh grated mozzarella and fresh grated Parmesan. It helps a lot. The jar sauce and canned toppings took away from it a bit but it was still great given the time constraints of the day and last minute nature of the dish. \n\nAll in all I\u2019d give it an 8/10 for a quick and easy recipe. If I implement the improvements next time and just do dough prep the day before I feel it will be a 9/10. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke5mbt", "created_utc": 1746313376.0, "score": 10, "author": "Familiar_Priority_59", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1ke5mbt/sourdough_pizza/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I also reset with a clean jar every time I feed (again, this is 1-2x per day). Should I just move things into a larger jar? Is it important to start with a fresh jar at each starter feeding?\n3.

The dough is super sticky and tacky, clinging to the sides of the bowl, stretch and folds don't appear to make it stronger, and although it seems to bulk ferment + rise super quickly, when I come to shaping it in the afternoon it's still completely tacky, getting stuck all over my fingers etc...

During the colder months I would feed 1:3:3 at night so it was ready in the morning, but now that it\u2019s warmer it peaks overnight, so I switched to same-day feeding.\n\nAround 1:00 pm, once the starter peaks, I mix 150 g active starter, 500 g bread flour (I use Sainsbury\u2019s Very Strong Canadian Bread Flour), and 360 g room temperature tap water. I let it autolyse for an hour.\n\nAt 2:00 pm I add 10 g salt, dimple it in with really wet hands, and do one round of stretch and folds.\n\nAt 3:00 pm I do a a set of coil folds.\n\nAt 4:00 pm I do the final set coil folds.\n\nThis is the warmest part of the day. I live in Bristol and we had a bit of a late April heat wave. My kitchen gets a lot of afternoon sun, and the bulk fermentation has been going really really quickly. The dough was jiggly and pulling away cleanly from the sides after only 90 minutes.\n\nI did one pre-shape, let it rest for 30 minutes, then did a tight final shape with good surface tension and placed it into the banneton. I covered it and put it straight into the fridge overnight.\n\nI baked it at 10:00 am the next morning. I preheated my Challenger Bread Pan for an hour at 225\u00b0C.

{"title": "UK bread flour question", "selftext": "As far as I\u2019m aware, in general, the protein content in flour from the US and Canada are a LOT higher than in the UK, which shows in people\u2019s bread baking because their high hydration dough maintains much more of a structure. Even in their starters, the consistency is a lot thicker. For anyone in the UK, which brand of flour do you find has the highest protein content or produces the best bread? I have tried Lidl and then Sainsbury\u2019s, which is what led me to notice the difference in protein contents for the first time. The Lidl strong white bread flour must have an extremely low protein content, as it made my starter very thin and my dough always more sticky and loose than it ever should be. Sainsbury\u2019s on the other hand, while still not being comparable to US bread flour, completely changed the texture of my starter and the manageability of my dough. Does anyone baking in the UK have any insight on this? \n\nEdit: wow! Thank you so much to everyone who commented!

Combine all the ingredients together to form a rough dough.\nTurn the dough out on to a clean surface and knead for approximately 10 minutes or until the windowpane effect has been achieved. The dough should be smooth, soft and elastic.\nWhen kneading, do not worry if the dough is slightly wet or sticky. Resist the temptation to add any extra flour.\n\nReturn the dough to the mixing bowl, cover with cling film and allow the dough to prove for 4 hours at room temperature. Optionally, do some stretch and folds every thirty minutes for the first 2 hours. \n\nAfter 4 hours turn the dough onto a clean work surface and knock the dough back. Knocking back the dough simple involves knocking the air from the dough which helps to equalise the temperature within the dough. Take about 130g of the dough and mix in the activated charcoal. I let my stand mixer do this as it\u2019s fairly messy. \n\nForm the dough into a tight round ball. Spritz lightly with water and decorate with sesame seeds. \n\nRoll out the black dough into a thin circle large enough to encase the dough ball. Place it over the dough ball, flip and seal the bottom. Trim any excess so that there\u2019s a thin layer. Small gaps on the bottom are fine. \n\nTo proof & bake using a proving basket:\n\nPrepare a proving basket by lightly dusting with flour. Place the dough, seamed side facing up, into the proving basket. Loosely cover the proving basket with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for another 3 \u2013 3\u00bd hours.\n\nAlternatively, to prove overnight for baking first thing in the morning, place into a fridge and leave overnight.\n\nTurn out onto a baking peel and decorate the black with stencils. A light mist of water will help flour stick. I used an airbrush with edible gold dust in vodka. I generally make 4 stencils and then slash in between, cutting first only through the black layer. I messed up on spacing on this one so it\u2019s a little off with extra slashes. Picture is of the best side. \n\nThen slash the inner white dough ball in the same places. Peeling back the black layer a little can help them curl up. Mine here are tighter. \n\nBake using your preferred method. I use a Anova Steam Oven 425\u00b0F 100% Steam for 10 - 15 minutes and then 375\u00b0F another 10-15 minutes, until the internal temperature is 210\u00b0F\n\nOriginal basic recipe Source: https://www.ilovecooking.ie/features/sourdough-bread-masterclass-with-patrick-ryan/\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/jtbn9vif98ye1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1746130151.0, "score": 223, "author": "scott_d59", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1kcib6j/layered_dough_techique/", "html_title": ""}

Let me start from the beginning\u2026\nI\u2019m using Elaine Boddy\u2019s step by step method for making a starter (foodbodsourdough.com). \n50g KA BF + 50g tap water on day one\nDay 2: fed 30g tap water + 30 g KA BF\nDay 3: fed 30g tap water + 30 g KA BF\n(1st pic shows some growth several hours after my day 3 feed.

Fortunately it was a measuring cup and I remembered that before I poured the 30g of water into the correct vessel, it contained 1/2 c water. So I figured out the weight in grams of that much water, subtracted 30, and realized that I had just flooded Aloysius with 79g of water.

{"title": "Confusing bread", "selftext": "Hokay. \n\nI have been working on this bread recipe for a long-ass time, several years now, and I am still struggling with what I think is proving (and possibly an acidic starter) but at this point I don\u2019t even know anymore. \n\nTo start with:\n\nMy starter is several years old, got it from a friend. At one time it lived in the fridge and got fed 1/1/1 rye flour; surprise surprise, it got acidic. It now lives on the counter and gets fed white flour twice-ish a day; I think it has mostly recovered but honestly I\u2019m not sure- I feel like my crumb still tends to be a little gummy, which (I think) points to acidic starter. I feed it peak to peak (as close as my ADHD will allow, that is, but it never collapses completely) with HEB all purpose flour and filtered water, anywhere from a 1/2/2 to a 1/5/5 depending on when I expect I\u2019ll next be able to feed it. My kitchen swings anywhere from 70-75 (possibly more in the summer) and I don\u2019t have a way to moderate the temp of the starter. It doesn\u2019t get refrigerated unless I\u2019m gonna be out of town for awhile. \n\nThis recipe is what I normally do:\n[Recipe:\n\n-585g warm water, 30g reserved \n-100g Bob\u2019s Red Mill 10 grain cereal \n-100g white bread flour\n-75g oat flour\n-75g einkorn flour \n-300g whole wheat bread flour (KA)\n-150g starter \n-50g honey\n-14g unsalted butter\n-20g salt \n\n(91% hydration)\n\nHeat 150g of the water in a teapot till boiling. Put cereal into a large mixing bowl. Add boiling water. Let sit a few minutes. Add the rest of the water at room temp, then flours. \n\nAutolyse for an hour, then mix starter, butter, honey in with reserved water with pinch & folds. Do a round or two, then sprinkle salt on top. Do additional gluten formation till it behaves (usually pinch/stretch and folds at first, then coil folds till it feels bouncy.)\n\nTemp dough. Prove to needed %, then fridge. \n\nPour out & shape, let it do a bench rest, then final shape and put in banneton. Into the fridge for a cold retard. \n\nOven to 450 half an hour before you want to bake, cloche in oven. \n\nScore- at least one big slash down the middle. \n\nClosed cloche for 30 mins, open for another 20. When it hits 205\u00b0 it\u2019s done.] \n\nAnd I\u2019m still fighting to get it to oven spring properly. The first photo on 3/22 was my last photographed attempt before yesterday- the alveoli are nice and open, but it still has very square shoulders and the oven spring just\u2026kinda didn\u2019t. It was temped at 78\u00b0, did a counter rise to about 35% (to my understanding, because it\u2019s whole grain, it will rise faster than white flour and has to be stopped sooner), was shaped and did a cold retard overnight, baked the next day straight from the fridge. \n\nThe last several photos on 5/1 were from a bake yesterday. I started dough on Tuesday evening and followed my recipe until we got to the BF- I didn\u2019t have time for it to do its full ferment before I had to go to bed, so it fermented for about 3h at 72\u00b0 (should have taken about 10ish), had risen at most 10% between gluten formation? I chucked it in the fridge after the GF was done, intending to get it out \u201csoon\u201d, finish the BF, shape, and either cold retard or bake. \n\nDidn\u2019t have time to bake Weds- was basically not home. I don\u2019t think I even opened the fridge Weds. \n\nYesterday morning around 8a or so I finally checked the bread in the fridge and instead of it being around the 20% risen I expected it had risen over 100%. Ack!! I didn\u2019t think it could do that!! Had to go to work but came home at 4:30ish and pre-shaped it, let it rest, shaped it again, slashed it DEEPLY down the center, then threw it into the preheated cloche at 475\u00b0. Took the lid off at half an hour, dropped the temp to 450, and baked it to 205\u00b0. \n\nAs the photos showed, the cracking is UNREAL. This bread went KABLOOEY- like holy oven spring Batman. \n\nAnd like- I have no idea how to read that crumb. That is not underproved crumb from what I can tell. \n\nTo my understanding, that much oven spring and cracking happens when your bread is *underproved*. The decent crumb but disappointing oven spring from the first photo points to overproving (or possibly acidic starter, or both)- but the first loaf proved WAY LESS than this one! \n\nWhat did I do??? What do I need to do to get the oven spring without the massive cracking/exploding? Why is my less-proved bread acting so overproved while my more-proved bread acts underproved?? \n\nBoth loaves taste amazing, just for the record, but the science here is baffling me. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdae68", "created_utc": 1746216214.0, "score": 1, "author": "killerblackberrypie", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1kdae68/confusing_bread/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Shaping dough is actually impossible", "selftext": "Hi so I have tried various recipes now at different hydration levels, ranging from around 60-80% hydration. I've probably baked around 8 loaves at this stage and I run into the same problem every single time which is that it is impossible to shape them. They still turn out fine, maybe a little underproofed mostly although I have had one that was overproofed.\n\nI generally follow the sourdough journeys guide on bulk fermentation but no matter what I do whenever I pour out my dough to do the preshaping it's always like sludge. I consistently cannot shape it into a boule. I have tried all manner of things; using floured hands and surface, using a floured surface and wet hands, various different shaping techniques etc. But they ALL just end up flopping back out flat on the table. The dough just doesn't hold its shape at all.\n\nNormally I try for an hour then I just give up because nothing is working and just pick up the dough and dump into a bowl with a silicon baking mat inside, which allows me to transfer it straight to the Dutch oven without having done any shaping. This is my only solution but I swear it's so frustrating it makes me want to give up making sourdough altogether. Does anyone have any tips? \n\nAnd before you say the problem is overproofing, I might be wrong but I'm fairly sure it isn't. My dough is usually 20\u00b0-24\u00b0C and I only ever proof to 1.5x volume max. I have also tried adding extra sets of stretch and folds but they never seem to do anything.

{"title": "Advice - sourdough pan loaf", "selftext": "(Please ignore my brutalized cast iron pan)\nHello! I\u2019ve made this bread three times now (once with the seeds, twice without) and have made a couple variations on bulk fermentation time (first time exactly as indicated, second time slightly less time on the counter, third time slightly more with more stretch and folds) but the loaves don\u2019t come out looking how they do in the photo the recipe developer provided. \nI way prefer the closeness of the crumb in her loaf, and it appears far paler than mine, despite supposedly being 50% whole wheat. \nAm I over-proofing? Under-proofing? Should I try different flours? \n\nHere is the recipe: \n\nMakes 1 loaf \nStarter, 200g\nWhite flour, 200g \nWholemeal flour, 200g\nWater, 400g\nPumpkin seeds, 25g\nSunflower seeds, 25g\nLinseeds, 50g\nSalt, 10g \nWeigh starter, both flours and water in a big bowl. I start with the starter, add the flour and then the water. Mix together with a wooden spoon until combined. Leave for 20 minutes.\nWeigh all seeds and salt in a separate bowl. Add to dough and mix until all ingredients are folded through. I use my hands. Don\u2019t overmix. The seeds and salt just need to be worked evenly through the dough.\nLeave the dough to proof for about 3 hours, folding it every 45 minutes. This strengthens the dough. Think of the dough as a square and fold its four corners inwards and over itself. If it is a cold day I use the oven to proof. Turn the oven on 50C for 5 minutes. Then turn it OFF and leave the bowl inside.\nIn 3 hours or so the dough will be light and stretchy. Drop the dough into a greased 1lb loaf tin lined with baking paper cut to size. Leave somewhere warm until the dough has risen and is 1cm away from the tin\u2019s lip or until it looks puffy. If it\u2019s a cold day, I use the oven method again. Store in the fridge overnight.\nThe next day, heat oven to 220C with a fan. Sprinkle water over the top of the loaf and score it longways down the middle with a sharp knife. A serrated one works well. Don\u2019t score the loaf right to its edges. Bake for 50 minutes.\n\nAny suggestions or advice super appreciated!

I\u2019ve been adding my starter usually right as it\u2019s post peak but this one I added while it was still at the peak or maybe even rising a bit so maybe that has something to do with it but I figured overproof would mean a flat loaf or just not a good loaf.\n\n\nA lot of the time making bread interferes with my schedule but getting a result like this and just leaving whenever I needed while still roughly staying the course makes me happy that I can still get a good result and makes me think I don\u2019t really need to have my day revolve around bread when I want to make some.  \n\nOne thing I am not getting ever is..really good surface tension on my dough whether I follow a strict protocol or something like this so I would like to figure that out.

{"title": "I really need guidance--doughs keep overproofing but not rising, my starter is a year old", "selftext": "**My starter is over a year old** (March 2024), and every week on Friday or Saturday I take it out the fridge, let it warm up, and feed it. I don't measure the flour and water anymore, cause I've done it so often that I know what consistency is right. I always feed with all GV all purpose flour and bottled purified water. It always doubles at the least. I've made at least 5 loaves, bagels even more, and have made sourdough cinnamon rolls; so I'm still a beginner, but I'm not new to this completely. I always used KA bread flour for my loaves, and use either GV all purpose or KA bread flour for bagels (both successful). Starter was made here in Charlotte, which gets warmer and more-humid earlier in the year (than NY, where I'm from).\n\n  \nOn Saturday I made my first loaf with whole wheat flour (30%). I was confused on if it was under/overproofed, but based on some photos and articles I saw earlier, I now know it was overproofed (first photo). I'm not asking for guidance on [that recipe](https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2020/06/whole-wheat-sourdough-bread/#comments) specifically, **although I am confused on how** because after I found out that WW ferments faster, I put my dough in the fridge Friday night to slow down the fermentation. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I took it out the fridge, saw the dough was at same level, poked it, and set it out on top of the fridge to warm up. The recipe said it needed to double, and by like 4pm, it was a little under the doubled mark; but really wet, sticky, and not airy at all. If anything I thought it was be underproofed because of that. That was really depressing, but the results of my loaves have been all over the place, and that was WW and high hydration so I gave myself grace.\n\n  \nHowever, my bagels **ALWAYS** turn out great--aside from one overproofing a couple of months ago after putting it in the fridge to slow down and that messing up the process I guess. I made another batch between then and now that came out perfect. I needed to make more so I made the dough last night. Let me start by saying I've used [this recipe](https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-bagels-recipe/) about every 1-2 months in the last year, so I am **very familiar** with the recipe and my process. I feed my starter same day, and then between 11pm-12am I make the dough, I set an alarm usually around 10am to check the dough, I bulk ferment for 10-12 hours, and then shape and do 2nd rise, etc. Every time I do this, my dough doubles at the least, is light and airy, and rises to near the top of the bowl. I started the bulk ferment at 12:15am, checked it at 10am, and it didn't rise AT ALL. In the hours since, I moved it to the top of the fridge, kept doing the poke test, and at 1pm finally decided to shape and bake even though it still didn't really rise (second photo). The dough was sticky, dense, and wouldn't hold shape; so I immediately knew it was overproofed (based on that experience a few weeks ago). What I can't figure out is HOW, when I keep checking my dough and am not seeing a rise!!\n\nKitchen temp was 79 last night and 77 when I woke up this morning, so although it's getting warmer outside, I've made bagels in these temps and higher in the last year. I use a metal bowl (cause that's what I have, third photo).\n\n  \nCan anyone shed some light on what might be going on? Why are my doughs not rising?? My bagels are the one thing I can rely on, and even they're not doing what they're supposed to and I'm starting to lose hope. I'm also unemployed and flour is notttt cheap.

I started my starter Friday April 18th and by Friday April 25th she was doing great and over doubling after feeding. I figured it was time to bake my first loaf. Saturday was busy so found a post from msemilyrose11 on same day sourdough and figured I would try that.

From what I\u2019ve read, looks like under fermentation. But it is that my starter is under fermented (she\u2019s too young to bake with yet) or she didn\u2019t proof enough on counter or in fridge?\n\nAdditional information - we have windows and doors open to the outside as much as possible. The temp dropped Saturday night so Sunday morning was significantly chillier than ideal. When I started about 6am feeding starter it was 55F but had the windows and doors closed, as it warmed up around 11 we opened the doors and windows and it was about 63F and reached high of 70F around 3 during bulk fermentation on the counter. \n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9vy3q", "created_utc": 1745848016.0, "score": 1, "author": "-what_the_elle-", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k9vy3q/waxy_gummy_air_pockets/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Mine on the other hand is flat!\n\nCreated my leaven last night as the recipe states, did the float test this morning at 8:15am. Mixed my dough, did the autolyse period.

{"title": "First attempt! Not bad, not great", "selftext": "I began my starter about 8 days ago and it\u2019s more than doubling in size every day. I made my first attempt at a loaf of sourdough today. It\u2019s honestly delicious and looks great from the outside! I\u2019m super proud of the outcome and this is a great starting point to improve from!\n\nWould love any feedback from the community on how I did and where I could improve. Admittedly, I messed up on one potentially crucial part, I fed my started 24 hours before using it instead of 12. I was too excited to wake up today and try my first loaf by the time I realized my mistake, so I decided to just give it a go anyways knowing this would be a learning experience.\n\nI followed the recipe in this video and used a Dutch oven to bake it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dtWFkODWxBg?si=lLOAiS-FKU-jnLlc\n\nRECIPE:\nFor accuracy, I highly recommend using measurements in grams as listed below rather than volumetric (cups/tsp). \n\nIngredients:\n\u25aaLeaven (make this 12 hours before mixing your dough)\n\u25aa100g (7T) water at 90\u00b0F / 32\u00b0C\n\u25aa25g (1T) ripe sourdough starter (fed 10-12 hours before mixing leaven)\n\u25aa100g (3/4c) bread flour (12.7% protein) \n\nBread: \n\u25aa275g (1c + 2T) water at 92\u00b0F/33C\n\u25aaRipe leaven (see above)\n\u25aa400g (3 1/4c) bread flour (12.7% protein)\n\u25aa50g (1/3c) whole wheat flour (14% protein) \n\u25aa12g (2t) salt\n\nStep 1: Build the Leaven (do this about 12 hours before mixing dough)\n1. In a bowl, mix 100g of 90F water with 25g  ripe sourdough starter.\n2. Add 100g bread flour to the mixture and stir until well combined and no lumps remain.\n3. Cover the bowl and let it sit at room temperature for 12-14 hours. The leaven should become frothy, bubbly, and increase in size.\n\nStep 2: Mix the Dough\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine 275g 92F water with all of the ripe leaven. Stir until the leaven is dissolved in the water.\n2. Add 400g bread flour, 50g whole wheat flour, and 12g salt to the mixture.\n3. Use a sturdy spoon to mix the ingredients until a dry clump forms. Then, wet your hand and use it to squeeze and fold the dough until it is homogeneous and there are no dry spots.\n\nStep 3: Bulk Fermentation\n1. First Rest: Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.\n2. First Fold: After 30 minutes, grab a portion of the dough, stretch it until you feel resistance, then fold it over itself. Repeat 5-6 times, then flip the dough and round it into a ball. Cover and let rest (a second time) for another 30 minutes.\n3. Second Fold/Final Ferment: Repeat the folding process one more time after the second 30-minute rest. After this, cover the dough and place it in a warm spot (about 90-95\u00b0F/35C) to ferment for 2 more hours.\n\nStep 4: Shaping Dough\n1. Lightly flour a cutting board and flip the dough out onto the floured surface. Grab opposite sides of the dough, pull them out, and fold over each other. Rotate the dough and repeat a total of at least 4 times.\n2. Flip the dough over onto the folds and round it while stretching the top down and under to create tension.\n3. If using a proofing basket, dust it with flour. If using a bowl, line it with a tea towel (kitchen towel) and dust with flour.\n4. Place the shaped dough seam side up in the basket. Give it a few more pull out and folds as shown in the video to create added tension. \n\nStep 5: Proofing\n1. Cover and let proof in a warm place for 60-90 minutes.\n2.  After 60-90 minutes, the dough should have increased in size by about 60%. To test, gently poke the dough; if it slowly bounces back, it is ready to bake. Judge proofing by the way the dough looks, reacts to the poke not the time. Proofing in a cool room will take much longer than in a warm room. \n\nStep 6: Baking\n1. Preheat your Dutch oven in a 475\u00b0F/245C oven. \n2. Carefully flip the proofed dough onto a piece of parchment paper sprinkled with semolina flour. \n3. Use scissors to make 5-6 angled snips on the dough. \n4. Initial bake:  Place the dough and parchment paper into the preheated Dutch oven, cover with the lid, and bake for 15 minutes. \n5. Final bake: Remove the lid and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9edbi", "created_utc": 1745787626.0, "score": 6, "author": "Ryukun", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k9edbi/first_attempt_not_bad_not_great/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Cover it with plastic wrap or a bag, and let it rest for 30 minutes. Then, fold the dough by pulling each of its four sides and folding them toward the center (stretch and fold). Repeat this process every 30 minutes for a total of 4 times.\n\nRoom Temperature Fermentation: After completing the folds, let the dough ferment at room temperature (around 22-24\u00b0C) for 2 hours. (If your room is very warm, the fermentation time may shorten.)\n\nShaping: Shape the dough lightly and transfer it to a bread basket sprinkled with rice flour or a floured towel. Cover it with a bag and refrigerate it.\n\nCold Fermentation: Let the dough rest in the refrigerator (at 5\u00b0C) for about 18-20 hours.\n\nBaking: Preheat your oven to 250\u00b0C. Also, preheat a cast iron pot in the oven. Carefully transfer the cold dough into the preheated cast iron pot, and score the top with a razor or sharp knife.\n\nBake with the lid on for 15 minutes at 250\u00b0C.\n\nThen, remove the lid and bake for an additional 30 minutes at 200\u00b0C.\n\nCooling: Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack.

{"title": "Maybe a bit underproofed?", "selftext": "The loaf tastes great but I feel like it didn\u2019t fully rise any feedback is appreciated \n\nDOUGH INGREDIENTS\nFlour - 600g\nWater - 450g (75% of the flour weight) **\nStarter - 90g (15% of the four weight)\nSalt - 18g (3% of the flour weight)\n**TIP - One variation to consider. The amount of water can vary between 70-80%. The more you hydrate, the harder/stickier it is to work with the dough. But the 80% hydration is (in my opinion) better tasting and moist. I would recommend you use 75%, but I use a generous amount of water when I fold the dough to help with hydration. It is still fantastic either way.\nWhen making the dough I mix the starter and water thoroughly, then add the flour gradually and the salt is added with the last 1/3 of flour. You do not need to mix vigorously, but you do want the flour completely mixed into the dough. It may be slightly lumpy. Cover bowl with dish towel and let sit for an hour.\nThe dough will need to be folded at least 2-3 times every 30 minutes after the first hour. You will feel the consistency change each time. Use You-Tube videos to see how to do this, but basically you want to get your hands wet, then grab the dough from the bottom/ middle and pull it straight up and fold it over the top. I shake the dough slightly to see its elasticity. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and do the same thing until you get to the starting point. Once completed, I take the whole loaf up and flip it over, seam side down. Cover with dish towel, keep in warm dry place and set timer for 30 minutes and repeat.\nOnce folded 3+ times, cover and let rest for 6+ hrs or overnight. The dough will double in size.\n\nBAKING THE BREAD\nWhen you are ready to cook preheat the oven and pan (with lid) to 450 degrees. You can use ceramic or Dutch oven, but you need to have a secure fit for the lid.\nWhile they are preheating, scrape dough onto a floured flat surface and fold similarly to the earlier version, but I elongate the dough so final shape looks like a loaf of bread. Transfer loaf, seam side down on parchment paper and let rest for 30-60 minutes in a separate loaf pan. When the oven, pan and loaf are all ready, transfer dough into preheated pan, slice a line down the middle for split, recover pan and place a lower center rack. Ovens vary, but I set my alarm for 24-25 minutes. Once ready, remove cover and cook an additional 18-19 minutes. The loaf will have risen to its full height with a crack down the middle will have appeared. The second half of the cooking is to brown the bread\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/gbjl22s9vfxe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745786396.0, "score": 2, "author": "Impossible_Rip7514", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k9dwtd/maybe_a_bit_underproofed/", "html_title": ""}

My starter is only about 2 weeks old but was doubling and falling in about 4 hours so hopefully it was strong enough!\n\nI used King Arthur boom of bread book Pain de Campagne recipe - link to online version . The book version states 4 sets of fold and stretches - so that\u2019s what I did. I used this as it said it was beginner friendly, not realising how difficult to handle high hydration doughs are! Anyway , I really really struggled to do any real shaping due to how slack the dough was as how much it stuck to my hands . \n\nFinal result - quite a flat loaf. Looking at my crumb I think this is due to poor structure - is this from not doing enough stretch and folds - or is this from terrible attempt at shaping?

{"title": "Need input to fix sourdough", "selftext": "Haven\u2019t been baking sourdough for too long (since Feb?). I made my own starter with AP flour (no yeast just the natural way) and no I don\u2019t think it\u2019s floats tbh but it\u2019s been making something of a bread so it can\u2019t be too far off. Need advice on how to make it float. It does grow after feeds like normal. As for the bread itself\u2026\n\nMy current process is: \n\n3.5 cups AP flour \n1 1/3 cups water\n1/2 cup starter \n2 tsp salt\nCombine and let sit in the bowl with a wet dish towel over it for 30 mins. Then I do 4 sets of stretch and folds where I (you guessed it) stretch and fold it 4 times, turning the bowl after each stretch and fold. \n\nI do this process in the evening. After the last stretch and fold, I make sure the dish towel is still damp and I put the bowl in the oven (off) with the light on overnight. In the morning, first thing, I take the bowl out of the oven and get my dough on a floured surface (my wood cutting board). So far, there\u2019s only been one time where I took it out in the morning and the top layer of the dough had become almost hardened(?), I still used it anyways thinking it would rehydrate but after the bake I could see it as like a layer when I cut the loaf. That was a bit weird. Anyways. I turn it into a ball and let it hang out while I make my breakfast and eat. Then I flour the now dry dish towel, shape the dough by bringing the sides together in both directions, put the dough on the towel, and plop it into the bowl. I fold the towel over the dough, and then put the whole bowl in a plastic bag and tie it up. I put the bowl in the fridge and go to work. I then bake it that night. (I work normal 9-5 hrs) When I bake it, I preheat my ENAMELED dutch oven filled with water in the oven at 450\u00b0F for 30 mins. Then I toss the water, quickly dry the dutch oven, lightly flour the inside of the dutch oven, and plop my dough in (I don\u2019t take it out of the fridge until this point). To score it, I use a knife because I don\u2019t have a scorer (don\u2019t judge lol). I bake it for 30-40mins (I\u2019ve been testing that range) with the lid on and then 10mins with the lid off still at 450\u00b0F. \n\nI think it doesn\u2019t rise enough and it ends up more dense/moist than I think is normal for sourdough. Also looking for advice about how to score with a knife if possible, trying not to buy a bunch of accessories. Open to all advice, but like I said I\u2019m not looking to spend too much on more accessories, more focused on technique and ingredients/measurements. I only have an enameled dutch oven I\u2019m not buying another one so please don\u2019t say to just buy a different vessel.

I\u2019ve tried making a deeper expansion score, but it wound of expanding ONLY at that point, got so tall that I couldn\u2019t store it without slicing it, and with the design area not expanding it kind of looked like it was just scratched into the crust.

{"title": "Failing constantly", "selftext": "Hello everyone. Im having some issues with my bread that I believe are caused by my starter. My starter is about I would say 3-4 months old now. This is my 5th time restarting due to mold growing on my first one (RIP) which was the only starter I had any luck baking with. The others I had trouble building up into a strong starter because I was unknowingly using bleached flour (I can't believe it took me that many attempts to figure it out \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). All my loaves turned out flat.\n\nIve since changed to my current one which is made of AP and sometimes I mix in some Whole Wheat for a boost. Ive also tried Rye but dont want to use too often since I seem to be allergic to it. There's some good webbing on it and it does double in size and has even more than doubled. The problem is it takes a REALLY long time to double. It takes about 16 or more hours to rise and I noticed that it rarely falls back down in time for the next feed. Maybe my house is just too cold at 68-70? Am I feeding too early? It already smells like acetone by the time it doubles but Im not sure. \n\nWhenever I bake, it just always turns out flat. I bulk ferment for about 12 or more hours and even then it feels very under fermented. The dough rises but I dont think it rises near enough. Im at the end of my rope and Im desperate \ud83e\udd72 \n\nAlso I would try the stater in the oven with the light on trick but I measured and temps reach to about 92 or more in there sometimes.

With Robin Hood's Unbleached AP Flour, the dough is always very elastic and easy to work with. But when I use Arva's Daisy flour, I had to lower the hydration to 61% to avoid a goopy mess.\n\nHowever, even at 61% hydration, the dough was still extremely slack when I poured it out to the bench for the final shaping after bulk fermentation was done. \n\nThe dough didn't rise as much during the bulk fermentation, and in the final proof, it took less time to finish proofing compared to my usual dough made with Robin Hood's Unbleached AP flour.\n\nI think the gluten in the Daisy flour seems to degrade throughout the fermentation process much more quickly. This might be why when I feed my starter with the Daisy flour, it would always collapse really shortly after it peaked.\n\nI still ended up with a loaf that has nice oven spring, crumb, structure, and flavour, but the dough wasn't easy to work with at all, and due to the much lower hydration, the crumb was not as soft as I wanted, and the crust was also thicker and harder.\n\nI'm absolutely not saying you shouldn't buy Arva's Daisy flour or that the flour isn't good; just wanted to give you a heads-up that you might need to drastically decrease the hydration of your usual recipes.\n\n# Recipe for the loaf\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 320g Arva Daisy white flour\n* 80g Arva Red Fife whole wheat flour\n* 247g water\n* 9g salt\n* 80g matured starter\n* 20g oil\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1.

{"title": "6th Loaf what do I need? :)", "selftext": "Hi! The taste is delightful and so is the texture but I feel like the bubbles are tiny. Is this fine? How do I make them bigger? \n\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine 310g 92F water with the ripe leaven 200g. Stir until the leaven is dissolved in the water. \n2. Add 400g bread flour, 50g whole wheat flour, and 12g salt to the mixture. \n3. Use a sturdy spoon to mix the ingredients until a dry clump forms. Then, wet your hand and use it to squeeze and fold the dough until it is homogeneous and there are no dry spots. \n\nStep 3: \nBulk Fermentation \n1. First Rest: Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes. \n\n2. First Fold: After 30 minutes, grab a portion of the dough, stretch it until you feel resistance, then fold it over itself. Repeat 5-6 times, then flip the dough and round it into a ball. Cover and let rest (a second time) for another 30 minutes. \n\n3. Second Fold/Final Ferment: Repeat the folding process one more time after the second 30-minute rest. After this, cover the dough and place it in a warm spot (about 90-95\u00b0F/35C) to ferment for 2-3 more hours. \n\nStep 4: \nShaping Dough \n\n1. Lightly flour a cutting board and flip the dough out onto the floured surface. Grab opposite sides of the dough, pull them out, and fold over each other. Rotate the dough and repeat a total of at least 4 times. \n2. Flip the dough over onto the folds and round it while stretching the top down and under to create tension. \n3. If using a proofing basket, dust it with flour. If using a bowl, line it with a tea towel (kitchen towel) and dust with flour. \n4. Place the shaped dough seam side up in the basket. Give it a few more pull out and folds as shown in the video to create added tension. \n\nStep 5: \nProofing \n1. Cover and let proof in a warm place for 60-90 minutes. \n2. After 60-90 minutes, the dough should have increased in size by about 60%. To test, gently poke the dough; if it slowly bounces back, it is ready to bake. Judge proofing by the way the dough looks, reacts to the poke not the time. Proofing in a cool room will take much longer than in a warm room. \n\nStep 6: \nBaking: \n\nBaking in a Dutch Oven \n1. Preheat your Dutch oven in a 500 degree oven. \n2. Carefully flip the proofed dough onto a piece of parchment paper sprinkled with semolina flour. \n3. Use scissors to make 5-6 angled snips on the dough. \n4. Initial bake: Place the dough and parchment paper into the preheated Dutch oven, cover with the lid, and bake for 16 minutes at 485 degrees.\n5. Final bake: Remove the lid and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes at 465 degrees.l\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/aijxc1y6g2xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745623939.0, "score": 4, "author": "Alert_Raccoon7", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k7z3ax/6th_loaf_what_do_i_need/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Reawakening neglected starter with acid?", "selftext": "So, before my starter goes into the fridge for however long between baking,  I give it a good 2:2:1 feeding. \n\nThe last time I refreshed it after having neglected it in the fridge for 4 months,  I gave it a 2:2:1 feeding twice, 24hrs apart,  and nothing happened.  I wondered if I'd overdiluted the starter with a 2:2:1 feeding and swapped to a 1:1:1 feeding daily. There was a little activity,  but it wouldn't double at all. After 5 days,  I got worried I'd basically have to restart the whole thing. I mean a week had already passed,  but the smell wasn't the usual weird nonsense you get when you start a starter, so I figured it was still alive. \n\nThen I thought about that lady who had popularized using pineapple juice to start a new starter.  It gave sugar and increased the acidity to help create selection pressure for the right bacteria and yeast. So I thought at the very least,  some acid might help.  I splashed in about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with the next feeding. In 3 days of normal feeding after, it went to almost tripling in size. It was insanely active. \n\nWell,  I've gone and neglected it again for about 3 months,  and this time I added a teaspoon vinegar on the second feeding to see if it was a fluke.  First day/feeding had shown a little bubbling, but barely any growth, but 10 hours after the second feeding with the vinegar,  and it has already doubled.  I'm going to keep doing regular feedings for a few days without vinegar to dilute out the vinegar smell, but I haven't seen anything in here about this and thought I'd share. \n\nI searched 'vinegar' in the search bar and only came up with people complaining about their starters having a vinegar smell.

Grind it up and save it for disasters.\n\n(For example, if it gets contaminated by mold or you drop your glass \"Mother\" jar, you can \"rehydrate\" and bring it back to life.)\n\n\n\n\\#3 Even if you have a Proofing Box (Brod & Taylor), measure everything to the exact gram and follow every step to the minute.\n\nSome loaves will still be \"only fair\".\n\n(Here in Kentucky) Humidity changes A LOT in the apartment between winter (10%) and summer (40%-65%).\n\nWhether I have the Heat, fan, nothing, or Air Conditioner on makes a difference.\n\nIn the winter, I tend to get more \"big, round, beautiful, turkey-shaped\" battards.\n\n\n\nIn the Spring/Summer . . . I might get flatter/pyramidal loaves.  (like this #500)\n\n\n\n\\#4 Not including air in the Stretch and Fold segments (and the Final Shaping) is essential.\n\n(Naturally, since #500 was important . . . I managed to get one big air bubble in the middle of the loaf.  LOL.)\n\n\n\n\\#5 Once you find a starter recipe you like . . . you can adjust timing by adjusting Hydration %, and \n\nStarter% % (both in the Levain and the main batch) to better match the timing of your life schedule.\n\nThe above times are quite different from the original Culinary Exploration times.  \n\nBut it leaves me more midday time free to run errands. \n\nAnd Time after 5 pm if I choose to go out to eat.\n\nIt also makes it easier to bake two days in a row (for me at least), for the rare times I do that.\n\nI've got that \"gap\" between 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. to clean the battards, mix the bowls, and measure another batch of water/flour into the containers.\n\n  \n\n\\#6 sourdough's \"low glycemic index\" doesn't spike my blood sugar.  And it is easier to digest.  (It digests more slowly.)\n\n\n\n\\#6 It's rewarding. It's gratifying to find a few friends or club members who like your bread and occasionally bring them a surprise loaf.\n\nIt's just nice to be able to Make Something that's valuable.\n\n\n\nIf you have the time, give it a shot.\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/574a8637wzwe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745593350.0, "score": 3, "author": "PhesteringSoars", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k7n4zj/loaves_499_and_500/", "html_title": ""}

I cut the original recipe I had in half and made one loaf: \n\nOLD RECIPE FOR FIRST LOAF (FIGURE 1):\n\n1. 8am: Mix 500g flour and 375g water. Let it rest for an hour \n\n2. 9am: An hr later, pinch in 110g active starter (I used after peak) and 10g salt with a tiny splash of water. \n\n3. 10 min later: stretch the living shit out of it for 10 min. \n\n4. 10:30ish Am: An hour later: Stretch and folds continuously every hour until consistency is right. \n\n5. 2:30pm I think I got my consistency all right (so I did about 5-6 stretch and folds). \n\n6. I checked every 30 min to do poke test with a wet finger, look at bubbles, pull away from sides.. at 6pm (9 hours later), I believe my dough had bulk fermented correctly. I tried all the above methods and it pulled away from the bowl nicely. \n\n7. Shaped like twice with a 7 min break in between lol cuz I didn\u2019t know what I was doing but I figured more couldn\u2019t hurt..? \n\n8. 7pm: Cold proof\n\n9. NEXT MORNING: 7am: put Dutch oven into oven, at 450\u00b0 F, only put it in there until oven was done preheating. Scored dough and put it into Dutch oven with a silicon mat with those flaps. \n\n10. Baked for 25 min with lid on. Did NOT turn down temp. Baked for 25-30 min with lid off. I wanted it to be brown haha..\ud83e\udee0 but it looks GOOD. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: \n\n- I bought new flour! King Arthur\u2019s Unbleached all purpose (not bread flour). I wanted to try cookies later so I thought if I bought this one it would work out and I wanted to try name brand since everyone raves about it. \n\n- Yday I decided I wanted to make two loaves and I was following a girl from TikTok (gigis eloise). \n\nRecipe: \n\n725g warm filtered water\n250g active sourdough starter (eloise)\n30g salt\n1000g bread flour\nmix ingredients together\n- let sit for one hour\n- perform 4 sets of stretch and folds or coil and folds every 30 mins for 2 hours\n- bulk ferment on counter for 4 hours\n- split dough into 2 loafs and roll into their balls, can add inclusions here\n- refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 4 days\n- when ready to bake, score and bake at 500 degrees with the lid on for 35 mins, then lower to 450 degrees and bake for 10 mins with the lid off (watching for color)\n \n(This is copy and pasted from her page, I take no credit). \n\nSo I watched some videos and her loaves come out perfect. I saw that she didn\u2019t autolyse her dough like I did last time, she did beat it a bit which I didn\u2019t see till now I was rewatching. So I tried it out because I felt like my last recipe was too complicated with the waiting an extra hour and THEN incorporating the starter and salt even if it worked out great. \n\nSo I made the shaggy dough, it was wet. Very wet. I did some stretching and kneeding with my hands (5 min worth) after making the dough. It was liquidy but I decided to anyways let it go through. I did about 8 stretch and folds (Every 30 min) and this dough WOULD NOT GET STRONGER. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the flour I used, the temp was fairly similar to last week, my starter is STRONG (i got it from my aunt and I see her loaves are always amazing but she lives in pennsylvania and she said she follows the tiktok recipe above). I live in NJ, the humidity is fairly similar to here and Philly. Anyways it was just a liquid mess and it was NOT because of overproofing (I don\u2019t think so). Anyways I decided I lost hope with this dough and let it overproof overnight, and made focaccia at 5am. \n\nIts taste is sour because I used pickled jalape\u00f1os - like extremely sour (esp to my parents that are old and don\u2019t like tasty stuff anymore\ud83e\udd28). And I also made a brown butter cinnamon focaccia. It was eh. I just know both of them are gonna taste so bad when they lose the \u201cwarm bread\u201d feeling. \n\nAnyways I feel so beaten up after the worst two days of baking I\u2019ve ever had. I was really beating that dough yday. Can someone tell me why it was really liquidy and what I can do to make it work?? And I need some hopecore to inspire me again. Should I switch my flour to bread flour?? Why did it work with wegmans bread but not King Arthur and I wasted money\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso the first loaf I did make, it was alright but the crust was REALLY chewy and hard. I liked it, my parents weren\u2019t a fan after it cooled down.

{"title": "The Misadventures of Loof the Loaf", "selftext": "Ladies, Gents, and Scoundrels!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI present to you... Loof the Loaf! While she may not seem very impressive in her size, shape, colour, or ear, the entire life story of Loof is quite extraordinary! So bear with me while I stretch and I fold you a tall tale of the trials and tribulations of a loaf's life.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLoof the Loaf had all the cards set against her from the beginning... She started out from a half dead starter in a cold cold kitchen (about 17C), that was then placed in a slowly cooling oven in hopes of reviving it. However, the oven was not as cool as the mighty Creator had thought (at least 50C), and the Mother Starter was liquified and separated. The mighty Creator (a 22 year old with ADHD living in a large and wild Dutch student house), then decided that the worst that could happen is just another failed loaf and went forward with the making of Loof anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSometimes the power of creation lands in the wrong hands...\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn her most evil and careless ways the creator measured out about 300g of flour, 200g of water, and 100g of questionable Mother Starter, which she mixed well in a bowl, to be forgotten for 2.5h while she helped decorate her roommate\u2019s birthday cake. When poor, neglected, foetal Loof was remembered, she had already developed a very nice window worthy gluten structure. However, that was when creator remembered that she had forgotten the salt...\n\n\u00a0\n\nTruth is, the decade old digital scale of questionable origins is not able to accurately measure out 20 grams of salt, and tends to read 0 up until you put something at least 7g on it. So in her infinite wisdom the wicked creator simply eyeballed the salt, which she combined with the dough by pinching it in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLoof the Loaf was then stretched and folded several times whenever Creator remembered her in between talking with her roommates and decorating a glorious Bibble cake. At that point Loof was beginning to think that her life might turn for the better. She was transferred to the kitchen table where she was folded once again, and let to relax. However, that is when one of the creator\u2019s housemates birthday began and she was forgotten once again!\n\n\u00a0\n\nPoor, neglected Loof\u2026.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter a 1.5h ritual sacrificing the amazing Bibble cake to the Barbie gods, the Creator remembered her project once again, so Loof was folded and let to relax once again. This process was repeated one more time, at which point midnight was approaching and it had been more than 6 hours since the start of the creation process. Thus, the creator decided to just put it in a bowl to leave on the counter overnight so that it might rise at least a little bit\u2026 (at this point it was looking like Loof might never grow\u2026)\n\n\u00a0\n\nLoof the Loaf did her best to rise\u2026 But there is only so much you can do when the world has shown you so little care.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo the Creator awoke to disappointment; despite the having been left for 9 hours, Loof was not looking ready to be born, and the creator had to leave for work at 2 pm.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDisappointed the Creator turned her attention away from her ruined child, towards her other, more successful offspring \u2013 a sweater she had finished knitting. It was time to block it. So she took out her foam blocking board and pins. That is when a brilliant idea struck her\u2026 The blocking board was made of foam! A brilliant insulation material! If Loof the Loaf\u2019s and Mother Starter\u2019s biggest problem was a cold house, an insulation chamber could be built for them from the pieces of the blocking mat!\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that was what the creator did \u2013 she connected the pieces of her blocking board into a cube, into which she put 2 large jars of very hot water, and her bowl with Loof. Finaly! Loof was given what she needed to thrive. And so she did! In just 2 hours, she had (almost) risen enough. Due to time constraints, the creator decided to shape her right then (she accidentally trapped some dry flour in the loaf here - oops), and put her in the preheated oven just 30 minutes after shaping.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the exact temperature of the oven is hard to determine (it, too, is at least a decade old, and wasn\u2019t good even when it was originally bought), the creator\u2019s best guess is that it was preheated to at least 250C.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA content, if not entirely ready Loof was transferred into a Dutch oven, where it was left to grow for 20 minutes. The lid was then taken off and Loof was cooked for another 25 minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter that Loof was taken out of the oven and rested on a cutting board, where the creator and some of her friends stared at her longingly. As the creator was running late for work, she decided to cut Loof after 40 minutes, while she was still a little warm. And oh! What a beauty! Sometimes things thrive despite all odds. One can only imagine what Loof could have become if she had been treated with the appropriate amount of love!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the creator ran to work, her housemates praised and enjoyed the loaf;\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d declared housemate 1.\n\n\u201cReminds me of an artisanal loaf I once had in Austria,\u201d texted housemate 2.\n\n\u201cthe bread turned out AMAZING I love it omg proud <3\u201d whatsapped housemate 3.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo there you have it, a story of triumph\u2026 sort of\u2026 against all odds. May this inspire you in your own journey of creation. If you have an oven and some time you too can create a Loof!\n\nSometimes the pursuit of perfection goes against the pursuit of happiness, but you embrace flaws you can still have nice things.\n\n  \nIn the pictures you can see:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me working on the loaf,\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The loaf straight out of the oven\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The loaf cut 40 mins after it came out of the oven\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My blocking matt warm box setup\n\n5-6.

I don't remember exactly what I did, but I think I bulk fermented overnight, but it was taking forever because it was winter and my kitchen was cold and I couldn't tell what was qoing on. I think I used the basic recipe from the book Artisan Sourdough Made Simple. The inside of my first loaf was very unsightly and it didn't have much tang, but it was still edible and tasted fine. \n\nAfter not touching my starter for weeks, I decided to wake it up the other day and make a loaf for sandwiches. Looked at my jar, oops, last fed 3/15. But after stirring in the hooch and doing two feeds, it was very bubbly and begging me to use it. So I pulled up this recipe: https://alexandracooks.com/2017/10/24/artisan-sourdough -made-simple-sourdough-bread-demystified-a-beginners-guide -to-sourdough-baking/ and got going. I mixed it up Tuesday morning and did 3 stretch and folds, beginning BF around 1:15. It was a warm day and I had all the windows opened, so at about 8:45 it was looking increased by 50%, so I went for it and did my shaping. Then I covered it up nicely and put it in the fridge overnight. I pulled it out and got ready to bake around 11 the next day. I have a baking steel and dome and let the steel preheat with the oven, but I only heated the oven to 500 F rather than the 550 in the recipe because that's what I felt more comfortable with.

{"title": "Very first loaf", "selftext": "\n\nThis is my very first loaf. I was pretty overwhelmed with the process, and decided to just get this first bake out of the way. I fed my starter in the morning at 6:00 am. My starter was active, bubbly and seemed to be peaked after work, so I started my process about 3:30 pm. My dough temped at 76 degrees, so looking at charts, it seemed I should be looking for at least 30% increase (I ended BF at 40%). At 10:30 pm last night, I shaped my loaf, and placed it in the fridge. This evening after making dinner (so approximately 20 hours in the fridge). I used a pampered chef stone loaf pan covered with a run of the mill loaf pan (that's what I had on hand - didn't seem wise to invest a bunch of $ if I end up not enjoying this process). I was going for sandwich bread, so overall I think I am happy with how this turned out.\nCan I please get some feedback on my first loaf? Below is the recipe I used. \n\nMix 150g starter, 325g water.  Add 20g olive oil, 25g honey mix until milky. Add 500g unbleached flour and 10g salt, mix until you get a shaggy dough. Let rest 1 hour. \n\nPerform 2 sets of stretch and folds and two sets of stretch and coils, 30 minutes apart. Spray or wet your hands to prevent sticking. \n\nCover and let the dough continue to bulk ferment at room temperature for 4\u20138 hours (or overnight if your home is cooler). Bulk Fermentation time will depend on your dough temperature. Check chart. \n\nDump the dough from the bowl onto a clean surface. Spray or wet hands with water to prevent sticking. Gently shape the dough into a loaf by stretching it into a rectangle, folding in the right side to the middle, then the left side into the middle, and rolling upward into a log. Place it seam-side down in a well greased loaf pan. \n\nTwo options for second rise: \n\n1. Same day option:\u00a0Let it proof at room temperature for\u00a0about 2 more hours before baking.\n2. Overnight cold proof:\u00a0Let it cold proof in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24hrs. \n\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Score the top of the dough and spray it lightly with water. Cover with an inverted second loaf pan to trap steam for the softest loaf. If desired, line pan with parchment, pop 4 ice cubes underneath for steaming. Bake for 30 minutes at 400\u00b0F, then uncover and bake for 15 minutes at 375\u00b0F.\n\nUse a digital thermometer to check for doneness. Bread is fully baked when the internal temperature reaches 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0C).\n\nCool completely before slicing. \n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k79pyd", "created_utc": 1745546758.0, "score": 2, "author": "Vegetable_Active4813", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k79pyd/very_first_loaf/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Second attempt!", "selftext": "So last week I attempted sourdough bread for the first time, today I made my second loaf, while still not perfect, we are getting better. I picked up a Dutch oven and the crust definitely did better, I still dont have a bread lame though, so the scoring is crap, and despite the score I did with a knife, it still split on top. Wither way, it is MILES better than my last loaf. Recipe is the same as last time. I included a picture of my last loaf and my new loaf \"together\" for comparison sake. Recipe below. \n\n150 g sourdough starter\n300 g water\n480 g white bread flour (I personally used 400 g bread flour and 80 grams whole wheat)\n2 tsp salt\n\n1. Measure the starter to a large bowl and pour in the water. Stir well to combine\n\n2. Add the flour and salt. Stir again to combine and make sure there are no dry pockets of flour. Your dough will be sticky and shaggy. Cover with a clean towel to rest.\n\n3. After 30 minutes, grab a corner of the dough and pull it up and into the center. Repeat until you\u2019ve performed this series of folds 4 to 5 times with the dough. Let dough rest for another 30 minutes and repeat the stretching and folding action. Repeat this step 3 times every 30 minutes.\n\n4. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise at room temperature, approximately 8 to 10 hours at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), maybe even less if you live in a warm environment. The dough is ready when it has increased by 50% in volume, has a few bubbles on the surface, and jiggles when you move the bowl from side to side.\n\n5. Coax the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into a round: fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, and repeat until you\u2019ve come full circle. If you have a bench scraper, use it to push and pull the dough to create tension.\n\n6. Let the dough rest seam side up rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line an 8-inch (20-cm) bowl or proofing basket with a towel (flour sack towels are ideal) and dust with flour (preferably rice flour, which doesn\u2019t burn the way all-purpose flour does). Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape it again as described in step 4. Place the round into your lined bowl, seam side up.\n\n7. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 1 hour or for as long as 48 hours.\n\n8. Place a Dutch oven in your oven, and preheat your oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). Cut a piece of parchment to fit the size of your baking pot.\n\n9. Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Using the tip of a small knife or a razor blade, score the dough however you wish \u2014 a simple \u201cX\u201d is nice. Use the parchment to carefully transfer the dough into the preheated baking pot.\n\n10. Lower the oven to temperature to 450\u00baF (230\u00baC). Carefully cover the pot. Bake the dough for 30 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, lower the temperature to 400\u00baF (200\u00baC) and continue to bake for 10 \u2013 15 minutes more.

{"title": "Help please", "selftext": "Okay. I was making great sourdough bread that was tasty and pretty enough to give away but then the weck jar my starter was in broke when I was trying to take off a stuck on lid. So I had to trash it. I had some starter in the fridge that I tried to use but for some reason it looked like it had some mold after feeding it on the counter so I went back to square 1. For a week I would do 1:1:1 then discard and 1:1:1. For baking bread I like doing 25 g starter 75 flour and 70 water. The recipe I\u2019ve used in the past and got great results with just isn\u2019t working this time around or my starter isn\u2019t ready. Something. \nWhat I do is feed my starter at night 10 pm \nAround 8 am it usually has double so I do \n100 g of starter \n325 g of 80 degree water \nMix until its frothy - add in 500 g of flour \nOnce it looks incorporated in shaggy ball I cover with moist towel and wait 30 min then I add 10 g of salt and incorporate by pressing it in with my fingers and do the first stretch. I did a total of 3 stretches every 30 min. Then I let it rest on the counter for 6-8 hours. This is where I do feel like maybe I\u2019m messing up my dough had never appeared to \u201cdouble\u201d however it has 100% over proofed on my counter before with leaving it out longer and I ended up having a pancake loaf from it \ud83d\ude02 \nThen after the 6-8 hours on the counter I shaped it my doing the super basic shape you typically see. I call it envelope style \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f then it cold proofed for almost 34 hours in a banneton in the fridge. I preheated the oven to 500 and for about 30 minutes then scored loaf from fridge bake for 25 min at 500 degrees for 25 min and then removed lid and cut over to 425 and baked another 20 minutes. \n\nThis was the first loaf I had with decent spring and nice ear since starting over. However the crust was almost as sharp as glass and the dough was kind of dark in color despite using KA AP white organic flour. The bread was tasty but almost too chewy this is what I think people mean when they say gummy.

I've tried baking a loaf 4 times now and each time I end with a sloppy mess. Some info:\n\n* **Starter:** I use a 50% WW / 50% bread flour starter\n   * Smelled acidic for awhile early on but fixed that with a couple 1:5:5 feed\n   * Had a nice sweet, yeasty smell for a few days, but in the last couple weeks has smelled funky (smelly feet /  maybe vomit?)\n   * No visible signs of mold. I use a new jar every time I feed\n   * Doubling reliably\n   * Feed it every day 2-3x/d depending on peaks. Does usually deflate a bit before I get to it\n* **Recipe:** I use 100g active/peaked starter, 500g bread flour, 375g 85 degree F filtered water (reduced this down to 348g on most recent batch)\n* **Process (where my issue is I think):**  I let the dough sit for 30 min after mixing. Begin stretch and folds, repeating 4x every 30 minutes. Then, let the dough bulk ferment for 8ish hours (as far as I've gotten)\n* **Environment:** My kitchen is kept at around 74 degrees F\n\nMy dough doesn't seem to be strengthening during the stretch and folds at all. Volume expands a bit (but certainly could be more), but it's still relatively sticky and \"wet\" by the end of the two hours and doesn't hold its shape.

{"title": "My first loaf :\u2019)", "selftext": "Hello all!! After a long time wading through what seems like endless information about sourdough on this sub and on the internet, I finally bit the bullet and made a loaf with my starter (just over 3 weeks old). \n\nI don\u2019t have a Dutch oven nor a baking stone so I decided to go with the double loaf pan method and- fully expecting a flop- I got this thing of beauty!!

I did make some tweaks however:\n\nFirstly my starter is made with chakki atta (Indian wholewheat flour for making roti) which clearly works very well but I am thinking of switching to rye once I\u2019ve finished the bag. Secondly instead of three sets of stretch and folds I did five. The total BF time was roughly 10 hours I think? To be honest I wasn\u2019t super vigilant with it. I did temp the dough so that I could use the sourdough journey bulk fermentation chart but again I wasn\u2019t overly scientific about it. And of course instead of shaping into a batard I did a sandwich loaf. \n\nI\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s slightly underproofed judging by the crumb (enjoy the cat cameos) but to be honest I don\u2019t really care as it\u2019s delicious. I actually thought it was a bit overproofed when I ended bulk fermentation as it was a little bit sticky with some webbing but hopefully with more practice I\u2019ll get better at telling. \n\nI am so excited to make more sourdough and start experimenting with recipes :) thank you to everyone on this sub.

{"title": "Struggling with whole grain buckwheat (gluten-free)", "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI am usually working with rye sourdough and I have a healthy batch I am feeding and using to bake bread.\n\nNow I have to keep a second batch with whole grain buckwheat flour, completely gluten-free.\n\nI made the starter and kept it rather wet. It has been over a week now and it tastes sour, but absolutely doesn't rise. Bubbles could be seen now and then on a few days.\n\nI read that because of the absent of gluten, buckwheat doesn't rise well - especially when the starter is kept wet.\n\nDaily, the surface became a bit dark. If my research was done correctly, it is because of buckwheat being very active and always starving for more.\n\nThat was a sign for me for it being ready, so I took out around 500g and mixed it with 1kg whole grain buckwheat flour, added water and salt, and made dough. It was rather creamy, since I had added a bit too much water.\n\nI put a clean cloth over it and wanted to let it ripe for ~48h. (That's what I usually do with my rye dough). After around 18h, I checked the dough and was happy to see it rising, since the dough wasn't as watery as the sourdough starter I had made.\n\nThe smell was pleasant and it reminded me of sausage. Now later, it is probably 26h now I think, the surface looked a bit dry and the smell was a kind of different, and I thought: Why not just stirr it again. And then it happened: It stank of rotten eggs/sulfur. Under the surface, it was all risen with lots of trapped air - that's how my rye dough also looks like after 1-2 days ripening. Stirring it made the smell go away.\n\nBut yeah, it is the smell that made me wonder whether something went wrong. After stirring it, the smell was gone and it smelled of buckwheat-sausage again.\n\nHere are a few of my ideas on what could have happened:\n\n- So, can a healthy buckwheat starter cause something like this, or did my starter secretly fail and isn't actually healthy? Like, was I too early and my starter needed more time to balance out bacteria? Is it still in the stage of developing and the current state is a fake result?\n\n- Is buckwheat so extremely active, that only 15h of dough ripening is already enough and the sourdough starved already even with 1kg buckwheat flour within such a short time and I definitely shouldn't try to ripen buckwheat dough for 24-48h?\n\n- Did I use too much sourdough starter, so it ripened so fast, that it started to starve? I think I accidently used around 600g of it with 1kg whole grain buckwheat flour and 800ml water.\n\n- Do I need to stirr buckwheat more frequently, even the ripening dough, after it had risen?\n\nI would appreciate it, if someone could share their experience with whole grain buckwheat sourdough. I tried to look for already given advice, but they were more about other grains than buckwheat, like to use a healthy starter and to feed it with buckwheat, until it turns into a gluten-free starter. Or to mix it with white rice flour, since it is easier to handle. That's the kind of advice I am unfortunately not looking for. It has to be about pure whole grain buckwheat flour.\n\nThank you for reading. If you need more details, please feel free to ask. I am usually not following strict rules when creating a new sourdough starter, but go with my gut feeling, which always worked until now. But I am really unsure about buckwheat, since the usual signs grains with gluten give, do not seem to apply the same way for buckwheat. I also watched videos and I didn't really do anything different from them, and my buckwheat sourdough batch still smells and tastes fine (it is in the fridge by now). It seems to be the dough I put away for ripening, that developed that rotten egg smell after a certain time. But to admit it, when creating the buckwheat starter, I never discarded anything but fed it a little bit every time. Nothing seemed off, smell was fine, taste was sour-fine and the bubbles were fine. Before using the starter, I fed and observed it for a bit more than a week (maybe 8 or 9 days) and everything seemed fine. Did I actually keep the bad cultures within my sourdough without noticing it?\n\nIdeally, I hope someone who handles buckheat could answer. But still, any helpful soul is welcome and I am thankful for your comments!\n\nEDIT: And in case someone knows more about chemical reactions during rementation: Can any of the nutritions in buckwheat cause such a smell? [Here](https://i.imgur.com/UHAH40W.jpeg) is the data of wohle grain buckwheat flour. The reason I am so stubborn with this, is, because the sourdough starter itself smells and tastes wonderful. It is the dough that turned out like this, but after the first 15h when it rose, it smelled and tasted wonderful, too. It just happened like at 26h or so. That makes me wonder, if I have to handle it very differently with times and stuff, since buckwheat is not really a classical grain.\n\nBook Source of the data: Food Composition and Nutrition Tables 9th edition.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/1k6b35u/struggling_with_whole_grain_buckwheat_glutenfree/", "created_utc": 1745444032.0, "score": 4, "author": "DontAskForTheMoon", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k6b35u/struggling_with_whole_grain_buckwheat_glutenfree/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Baking Sourdough in a Warm Climate (Part 1)", "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Maintaining a sourdough starter is *highly* dependent on your local climate. In tropical heat? It\u2019s a whole different game.\n\n**Background**\n\nI\u2019m a home baker based in Singapore, selling sourdough bread through a local online marketplace (think Amazon, but just for locals). I have no professional training and zero fancy equipment\u2014just my hands, a lot of practice, and a standard home oven. I bake about 10 to 15 loaves a day. Oh, and I also have a full-time corporate job. Baking started as a hobby\u2026 and kind of took over my life.\n\nAfter 30 years in London\u2014and 20 of those spent baking sourdough (plus the occasional pizza... but let\u2019s not go down that rabbit hole)\u2014I recently moved back to my hometown, Singapore.\n\nNaturally, I jumped straight back into baking. But wow\u2026 it felt like I\u2019d forgotten everything. My dough was overproofing, my timing was completely off, and my starter\u2014Stevie\u2014was having a full-blown identity crisis.\n\nSo, I went back to basics. This post kicks off a series where I\u2019ll share how I\u2019ve adapted my sourdough routine to life in a tropical climate.\n\n**First question: How do you even keep a sourdough starter alive in this heat?**\n\nBack in London, where kitchen temperatures ranged from 5\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C, I followed the usual advice: feed at a 1:1:1 ratio, leave the starter on the counter in summer, or in the oven with warm water during winter. Stevie usually doubled in 8\u201312 hours. Simple.\n\nThen came Singapore. Here, room temperature hovers around 28\u00b0C (on a rainy day) and climbs to 35\u00b0C on a sunny afternoon. I tried the same 1:1:1 routine and left Stevie on the counter\u2026 Rookie mistake. A few hours later, he had gone completely rogue\u2014overflowed the jar, made a mess, and looked ready to escape out the window. My mum was not impressed.\n\n# After weeks of trial, error, and sourdough soul-searching, here\u2019s what finally works for me:\n\n* Take Stevie out of the fridge\n* Use him straight from cold\u2014no warm-up needed\n* After baking, feed him using tap water (\\~27\u00b0C). I am not too hung up with the ratio. There is usually about couple of spoonful of Stevie left in the container. I will just add about 200g of water and 200g of flour. Stir. (btw, I have more than 1 container of Stevie in the fridge - this is for another post)\n* Pop him straight back into the fridge\n\nThat\u2019s it. Stevie now lives full-time in the fridge. No more counter time.\n\nI know this might sound very different from what most YouTube bakers recommend, but my setup is unique:\n\n* My kitchen stays between 27\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C\n* \u201cCold\u201d tap water is about 27\u00b0C\n* I bake 10\u201320 loaves a day, Monday to Friday\n\nSo if you're baking in the tropics and your starter\u2019s going haywire\u2014don\u2019t panic. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong. You just need to adjust your routine to your environment. Trust your instincts, experiment a little, and maybe give your starter a name. It helps.

{"title": "Help with bulk fermentation", "selftext": "Hello, I am new to sourdough and have a starter that is nearly 3 months old. I have been attempting to make some loafs and they kept coming out super dense and gummy (still tasted great though). I noticed whenever I decided to stop bulk fermenting the dough it was incredibly sticky - to the point that no matter how much flour I used or water I covered my hands and scraper with it was impossible to shape and just turned into a glob. I did a bit more research and found that the dough temperature is very very important and I hadn\u2019t been taking that into account at ALL. I was just following how long the person from whose recipe I used was bulk fermenting their dough. I have an incredibly warm home and my dough temperature is at around 81\u00b0. I took a look at the charts for bulk fermentation times according to dough temperature and inferred that I should let it bulk ferment around 3-4.5 hours. This seems to be a step in the right direction because this is my best loaf yet! The crumb feels less gummy and more airy when eating and it rose more in the oven.

Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. It should get nice and bubbly.\n2. To the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, add the sourdough discard, honey, salt and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes.\n3.

Alternatively, you can turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough by hand for 5-10 minutes.\n4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, a beeswax wrap, plastic wrap, or a wet tea towel. This keeps it from drying out on top. \n5. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes, or until doubled in size. The amount of time can depend on how warm your kitchen is.\n6. After rising, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. These absolutely do not need to be perfect, but they will each be about 137-140 grams.\n7.

{"title": "First timer looking for feedback", "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI'm completely new to sourdough and bread making in general, so this was my very first attempt at baking any kind of bread.\n\nToday, I tried making a sourdough boule. It turned out okay-ish (definitely not the prettiest), but I now have a ton of questions!\n\nStarter:\nFrodough is a 19-day-old 50:50 rye and AP flour starter. After a dormant phase early on (to be expected), it began rising reliably around day 6. At 1:1:1, it peaks at about 2.5x after 2.5 hours. At 1:5:5, it nearly quadruples in 5 hours\u2014so it seems fairly active.\n\nMethod:\n1. Mixed 500g of 13% protein strong white bread flour with 375g water, 10g salt, and 100g active starter. (No autolyse or fermentolyse.) Hydration is about 77%, including the starter. Dough and room temp were both 22\u00b0C.\n\n2. Rested for 30 minutes, then did an initial stretch and fold. Switched to coil folds, 4 sets, spaced 30\u201345 minutes apart (when the dough felt relaxed).\n\n3. Dough felt strong and held shape well. Let it continue bulk fermenting at room temp for another 2\u20133 hours. Total bulk: ~5.5 hours.\n\n4. Floured a silicone banneton (shudders) with plenty of bread flour. Let dough rest 15 min on the counter, shaped it tightly (felt smooth and tight, not sticking to hands), and placed it in the banneton. It didn\u2019t stick at this point and held its shape in the banneton... Initially. \n\n5. Cold-proofed for 22 hours. Preheated oven to 500\u00b0C (for 1 hour), baked with lid on for 25 mins, then lid off for 40 mins.\n\nQuestions:\n1. I did a poke test at 5.5 hours\u2014indent remained slightly, so I assumed it would continue fermenting as it cooled in the fridge. Looking at the final crumb, I suspect it was still underproofed looking at some of the larger tunneling. Should I have let it go longer?\n\n2. The dough felt smooth going into the banneton, but after the cold proof, it stuck badly to the silicon banneton and lost all its shape. I nearly put it in the bin, but i'm glad i didn't. I used bread flour for the banneton, but it all seemed to get absorbed into the dough by the following next day. Would a rattan banneton and rice flour work better? Or is there something else I should try? Perhaps lower hydration? \n\n3. There were darker brown spots on the crust\u2014could these be burnt bits of flour that I didn\u2019t brush off properly?\n\n4. The bottom crust was quite thick. Is that due to a \u201cskin\u201d forming during the cold proof, or could it be from excess flour absorbing into the dough? Or is this just typical?\n\nSorry for all the questions! I've been doing a lot of reading and I'm a little addicted. Can\u2019t wait to bake again soon. Thanks so much! - would appreciate any and all advice/feedback. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke6m4x", "created_utc": 1746316333.0, "score": 19, "author": "WannabeBber", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1ke6m4x/first_timer_looking_for_feedback/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Sourdough Pizza!!", "selftext": "I got tired of loafing around with my starter and needed an easy dinner idea so I decided to throw together a quick pizza dough! AMAZING!!! I\u2019m never going back to any other recipe again. Here\u2019s how I did it. \n\nI used:\n1/2 cup of starter\n1 1/2 cups of warm water \n4 cups of flour (I used AP since it was on hand)\n1.5 tsp salt \n2 tbsp olive oil\n\nI mixed the starter and the warm water (95\u00b0) then added the salt until it dissolved. \nNext I mixed in half of the flour and olive oil\nAfter that I mixed the rest of the flour and stretched the dough for about 10 mins. \nFinally, I laid the dough in an oiled bowl with a lid and let it double. It was close after 6 hours so I called it good enough and rolled it out into 2 pizzas while the oven heated up to 475. \n\nAfter the sauce, cheese and toppings were good to go I put it in and baked it for 22 mins, keeping an eye on it the whole time. \n\nWhen it was done I turned off the oven, leaving the door wide open, and let it sit to finish the toppings as the oven cooled for about 10 mins. Then I let it rest on the pan on top of the oven until it was a palatable temp. \n\nWhat I\u2019d do differently: \n\nBread flour (I just used what I had on hand today)\n\nRoll it out a little thicker. The crust was great thin and had zero flop, and that\u2019s what I was going for this time; but a tad thicker would have been perfect. \n\nA slightly longer bulking period and possibly a fridge rest overnight if I did it the day before would likely yield a fluffier more bubbly dough; but this dough was still more than acceptable for the effort put into it. \n\nBetter sauce (I used leftover jar sauce on hand). It was really good but not my usual go to for homemade pizza. \n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nLike any pizza, the secret is quality ingredients and toppings. I used fresh grated mozzarella and fresh grated Parmesan. It helps a lot. The jar sauce and canned toppings took away from it a bit but it was still great given the time constraints of the day and last minute nature of the dish. \n\nAll in all I\u2019d give it an 8/10 for a quick and easy recipe. If I implement the improvements next time and just do dough prep the day before I feel it will be a 9/10. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke5mbt", "created_utc": 1746313376.0, "score": 9, "author": "Familiar_Priority_59", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1ke5mbt/sourdough_pizza/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Flatter Loaves in Warmer Weather - troubleshooting help, please!", "selftext": "Hi all! I\u2019ve been baking sourdough for about a year and a half, but only the last four months have been in a new kitchen and oven. My loaves had been turning out really nicely until the last two bakes, which have both ended up a lot flatter than usual. Not terrible, but definitely less oven spring than I\u2019m used to.\n\nI\u2019m trying to troubleshoot what might be going on and would really appreciate any advice or insight.\n\nI\u2019m following Conely Kipp\u2019s method and ratio (TikTok link: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdjG416N/).\n\nAt 8:00 am, I feed my starter 1:1:1. During the colder months I would feed 1:3:3 at night so it was ready in the morning, but now that it\u2019s warmer it peaks overnight, so I switched to same-day feeding.\n\nAround 1:00 pm, once the starter peaks, I mix 150 g active starter, 500 g bread flour (I use Sainsbury\u2019s Very Strong Canadian Bread Flour), and 360 g room temperature tap water. I let it autolyse for an hour.\n\nAt 2:00 pm I add 10 g salt, dimple it in with really wet hands, and do one round of stretch and folds.\n\nAt 3:00 pm I do a a set of coil folds.\n\nAt 4:00 pm I do the final set coil folds.\n\nThis is the warmest part of the day. I live in Bristol and we had a bit of a late April heat wave. My kitchen gets a lot of afternoon sun, and the bulk fermentation has been going really really quickly. The dough was jiggly and pulling away cleanly from the sides after only 90 minutes.\n\nI did one pre-shape, let it rest for 30 minutes, then did a tight final shape with good surface tension and placed it into the banneton. I covered it and put it straight into the fridge overnight.\n\nI baked it at 10:00 am the next morning. I preheated my Challenger Bread Pan for an hour at 225\u00b0C. I scored the loaf and baked it for 25 minutes with the lid on, then removed the lid, lowered the oven to 195\u00b0C, and baked it for another 15 minutes. We let this one cool on a cooling rack for 3 hours before my husband cut into it.\n\nIt\u2019s not a disaster, but this is the second loaf in a row that came out flatter than usual. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s being overproofed in the fridge because it\u2019s still warm when it goes in and might be taking too long to cool down.\n\nAny tips, advice, or theories are welcome.

{"title": "UK bread flour question", "selftext": "As far as I\u2019m aware, in general, the protein content in flour from the US and Canada are a LOT higher than in the UK, which shows in people\u2019s bread baking because their high hydration dough maintains much more of a structure. Even in their starters, the consistency is a lot thicker. For anyone in the UK, which brand of flour do you find has the highest protein content or produces the best bread? I have tried Lidl and then Sainsbury\u2019s, which is what led me to notice the difference in protein contents for the first time. The Lidl strong white bread flour must have an extremely low protein content, as it made my starter very thin and my dough always more sticky and loose than it ever should be. Sainsbury\u2019s on the other hand, while still not being comparable to US bread flour, completely changed the texture of my starter and the manageability of my dough. Does anyone baking in the UK have any insight on this? \n\nEdit: wow! Thank you so much to everyone who commented!

{"title": "Hooch (?) , a mistake, and a now giant starter", "selftext": "Well, when I fist decided to post today it was with a mix of excited and uncertainty because I thought I had some hooch, although it was more transparent than I expected, but in my excitement I screwed up my measurements and now have way more starter than I\u2019m supposed to. Let me start from the beginning\u2026\nI\u2019m using Elaine Boddy\u2019s step by step method for making a starter (foodbodsourdough.com). \n50g KA BF + 50g tap water on day one\nDay 2: fed 30g tap water + 30 g KA BF\nDay 3: fed 30g tap water + 30 g KA BF\n(1st pic shows some growth several hours after my day 3 feed. Aloysius is very bubbly already on that day)!\nDay 4: discarded half the starter then fed 30g tap water + 30 g KA BF\nDay 5: found no growth and a thin layer of liquid at the top. According to Elaine, sometimes starter gets a little less active at day 4 and is nothing to be concerned about, nor is a little hooch. I did expect hooch to be more gray than transparent, but figured its hooch anyway and stirred it in. Then I really screwed up\u2026I always pre-weigh my water, and in my excitement about the hooch, after adding my 30 g KA BF, I accidentally picked up the wrong water vessel and dumped way too much water in. Fortunately it was a measuring cup and I remembered that before I poured the 30g of water into the correct vessel, it contained 1/2 c water. So I figured out the weight in grams of that much water, subtracted 30, and realized that I had just flooded Aloysius with 79g of water. Rather than dumping her and starting over, I quickly added 49 g of flour to even out the amounts. I hope I haven\u2019t ruined her. She still has some bubbles. Tomorrow is a discard day\u2026should I just discard more than half to get back down to a reasonably sized starter? Or is she doomed altogether?

{"title": "Confusing bread", "selftext": "Hokay. \n\nI have been working on this bread recipe for a long-ass time, several years now, and I am still struggling with what I think is proving (and possibly an acidic starter) but at this point I don\u2019t even know anymore. \n\nTo start with:\n\nMy starter is several years old, got it from a friend. At one time it lived in the fridge and got fed 1/1/1 rye flour; surprise surprise, it got acidic. It now lives on the counter and gets fed white flour twice-ish a day; I think it has mostly recovered but honestly I\u2019m not sure- I feel like my crumb still tends to be a little gummy, which (I think) points to acidic starter. I feed it peak to peak (as close as my ADHD will allow, that is, but it never collapses completely) with HEB all purpose flour and filtered water, anywhere from a 1/2/2 to a 1/5/5 depending on when I expect I\u2019ll next be able to feed it. My kitchen swings anywhere from 70-75 (possibly more in the summer) and I don\u2019t have a way to moderate the temp of the starter. It doesn\u2019t get refrigerated unless I\u2019m gonna be out of town for awhile. \n\nThis recipe is what I normally do:\n[Recipe:\n\n-585g warm water, 30g reserved \n-100g Bob\u2019s Red Mill 10 grain cereal \n-100g white bread flour\n-75g oat flour\n-75g einkorn flour \n-300g whole wheat bread flour (KA)\n-150g starter \n-50g honey\n-14g unsalted butter\n-20g salt \n\n(91% hydration)\n\nHeat 150g of the water in a teapot till boiling. Put cereal into a large mixing bowl. Add boiling water. Let sit a few minutes. Add the rest of the water at room temp, then flours. \n\nAutolyse for an hour, then mix starter, butter, honey in with reserved water with pinch & folds. Do a round or two, then sprinkle salt on top. Do additional gluten formation till it behaves (usually pinch/stretch and folds at first, then coil folds till it feels bouncy.)\n\nTemp dough. Prove to needed %, then fridge. \n\nPour out & shape, let it do a bench rest, then final shape and put in banneton. Into the fridge for a cold retard. \n\nOven to 450 half an hour before you want to bake, cloche in oven. \n\nScore- at least one big slash down the middle. \n\nClosed cloche for 30 mins, open for another 20. When it hits 205\u00b0 it\u2019s done.] \n\nAnd I\u2019m still fighting to get it to oven spring properly. The first photo on 3/22 was my last photographed attempt before yesterday- the alveoli are nice and open, but it still has very square shoulders and the oven spring just\u2026kinda didn\u2019t. It was temped at 78\u00b0, did a counter rise to about 35% (to my understanding, because it\u2019s whole grain, it will rise faster than white flour and has to be stopped sooner), was shaped and did a cold retard overnight, baked the next day straight from the fridge. \n\nThe last several photos on 5/1 were from a bake yesterday. I started dough on Tuesday evening and followed my recipe until we got to the BF- I didn\u2019t have time for it to do its full ferment before I had to go to bed, so it fermented for about 3h at 72\u00b0 (should have taken about 10ish), had risen at most 10% between gluten formation? I chucked it in the fridge after the GF was done, intending to get it out \u201csoon\u201d, finish the BF, shape, and either cold retard or bake. \n\nDidn\u2019t have time to bake Weds- was basically not home. I don\u2019t think I even opened the fridge Weds. \n\nYesterday morning around 8a or so I finally checked the bread in the fridge and instead of it being around the 20% risen I expected it had risen over 100%. Ack!! I didn\u2019t think it could do that!! Had to go to work but came home at 4:30ish and pre-shaped it, let it rest, shaped it again, slashed it DEEPLY down the center, then threw it into the preheated cloche at 475\u00b0. Took the lid off at half an hour, dropped the temp to 450, and baked it to 205\u00b0. \n\nAs the photos showed, the cracking is UNREAL. This bread went KABLOOEY- like holy oven spring Batman. \n\nAnd like- I have no idea how to read that crumb. That is not underproved crumb from what I can tell. \n\nTo my understanding, that much oven spring and cracking happens when your bread is *underproved*. The decent crumb but disappointing oven spring from the first photo points to overproving (or possibly acidic starter, or both)- but the first loaf proved WAY LESS than this one! \n\nWhat did I do??? What do I need to do to get the oven spring without the massive cracking/exploding? Why is my less-proved bread acting so overproved while my more-proved bread acts underproved?? \n\nBoth loaves taste amazing, just for the record, but the science here is baffling me. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdae68", "created_utc": 1746216214.0, "score": 1, "author": "killerblackberrypie", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1kdae68/confusing_bread/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Do I need a Dutch oven? Really?", "selftext": "So, recently started in this pursuit. Bought a couple packs of dehydrated starter, and grew them in 2 Mason jars. Yesterday, after failing to read the recipe beforehand, I started an 11 hour recipe for pretzel bites at 10am. I was a few drinks in when it got close to oven time. I then suddenly realized that only about 1/3 would fit on the baking pan, and I was not trying to stay up an extra hour baking. So I pulled out the bigger pizza sheet. This was a mistake. But flat surface, easily fit the other 2/3 of the dough. But the pizza sheet has a thermal conductor in the middle, for a nice crisp dough... Or burned pretzel bites, you know, whatever you prefer. The ones on the baking pan were OK, considering the rush to just get it done at the end. \n\nSo what's next? Bread seems logical. But every recipe that includes \"beginner\" or \"easy\" wants me to use a Dutch oven. I don't currently own one. And adding a 400\u00b0F heavy pot into the mix doesn't seem easy to me... So, do I really need one? Or is this a trick by big cast iron to dupe newbies into supporting them?

{"title": "Layered dough techique", "selftext": "It\u2019s been a while since I did this layered dough technique. This is the first time I used my airbrush with edible gold dust though. \n\nBlack layered sourdough based on Patrick Ryan\u2019s original recipe\n\nIngredients:\n300g white flour\n25g Kernza flour or whole wheat\n75g Semola Rimancinata (finely ground semolina)\n10g salt\n232ml water\n160g sourdough starter\n1 tsp black sesame seeds\n1-2 tsp. Food grade activated charcoal powder\n\nDirections:\nAdd the flour to a clean mixing bowl. Mix the salt through the flour. Add the water and sourdough starter to the flour. Combine all the ingredients together to form a rough dough.\nTurn the dough out on to a clean surface and knead for approximately 10 minutes or until the windowpane effect has been achieved. The dough should be smooth, soft and elastic.\nWhen kneading, do not worry if the dough is slightly wet or sticky. Resist the temptation to add any extra flour.\n\nReturn the dough to the mixing bowl, cover with cling film and allow the dough to prove for 4 hours at room temperature. Optionally, do some stretch and folds every thirty minutes for the first 2 hours. \n\nAfter 4 hours turn the dough onto a clean work surface and knock the dough back. Knocking back the dough simple involves knocking the air from the dough which helps to equalise the temperature within the dough. Take about 130g of the dough and mix in the activated charcoal. I let my stand mixer do this as it\u2019s fairly messy. \n\nForm the dough into a tight round ball. Spritz lightly with water and decorate with sesame seeds. \n\nRoll out the black dough into a thin circle large enough to encase the dough ball. Place it over the dough ball, flip and seal the bottom. Trim any excess so that there\u2019s a thin layer. Small gaps on the bottom are fine. \n\nTo proof & bake using a proving basket:\n\nPrepare a proving basket by lightly dusting with flour. Place the dough, seamed side facing up, into the proving basket. Loosely cover the proving basket with a clean tea towel and leave to prove for another 3 \u2013 3\u00bd hours.\n\nAlternatively, to prove overnight for baking first thing in the morning, place into a fridge and leave overnight.\n\nTurn out onto a baking peel and decorate the black with stencils. A light mist of water will help flour stick. I used an airbrush with edible gold dust in vodka. I generally make 4 stencils and then slash in between, cutting first only through the black layer. I messed up on spacing on this one so it\u2019s a little off with extra slashes. Picture is of the best side. \n\nThen slash the inner white dough ball in the same places. Peeling back the black layer a little can help them curl up. Mine here are tighter. \n\nBake using your preferred method. I use a Anova Steam Oven 425\u00b0F 100% Steam for 10 - 15 minutes and then 375\u00b0F another 10-15 minutes, until the internal temperature is 210\u00b0F\n\nOriginal basic recipe Source: https://www.ilovecooking.ie/features/sourdough-bread-masterclass-with-patrick-ryan/\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/jtbn9vif98ye1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1746130151.0, "score": 223, "author": "scott_d59", "num_comments": 17, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1kcib6j/layered_dough_techique/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Shaping dough is actually impossible", "selftext": "Hi so I have tried various recipes now at different hydration levels, ranging from around 60-80% hydration. I've probably baked around 8 loaves at this stage and I run into the same problem every single time which is that it is impossible to shape them. They still turn out fine, maybe a little underproofed mostly although I have had one that was overproofed.\n\nI generally follow the sourdough journeys guide on bulk fermentation but no matter what I do whenever I pour out my dough to do the preshaping it's always like sludge. I consistently cannot shape it into a boule. I have tried all manner of things; using floured hands and surface, using a floured surface and wet hands, various different shaping techniques etc. But they ALL just end up flopping back out flat on the table. The dough just doesn't hold its shape at all.\n\nNormally I try for an hour then I just give up because nothing is working and just pick up the dough and dump into a bowl with a silicon baking mat inside, which allows me to transfer it straight to the Dutch oven without having done any shaping. This is my only solution but I swear it's so frustrating it makes me want to give up making sourdough altogether. Does anyone have any tips? \n\nAnd before you say the problem is overproofing, I might be wrong but I'm fairly sure it isn't. My dough is usually 20\u00b0-24\u00b0C and I only ever proof to 1.5x volume max. I have also tried adding extra sets of stretch and folds but they never seem to do anything.

{"title": "Advice - sourdough pan loaf", "selftext": "(Please ignore my brutalized cast iron pan)\nHello! I\u2019ve made this bread three times now (once with the seeds, twice without) and have made a couple variations on bulk fermentation time (first time exactly as indicated, second time slightly less time on the counter, third time slightly more with more stretch and folds) but the loaves don\u2019t come out looking how they do in the photo the recipe developer provided. \nI way prefer the closeness of the crumb in her loaf, and it appears far paler than mine, despite supposedly being 50% whole wheat. \nAm I over-proofing? Under-proofing? Should I try different flours? \n\nHere is the recipe: \n\nMakes 1 loaf \nStarter, 200g\nWhite flour, 200g \nWholemeal flour, 200g\nWater, 400g\nPumpkin seeds, 25g\nSunflower seeds, 25g\nLinseeds, 50g\nSalt, 10g \nWeigh starter, both flours and water in a big bowl. I start with the starter, add the flour and then the water. Mix together with a wooden spoon until combined. Leave for 20 minutes.\nWeigh all seeds and salt in a separate bowl. Add to dough and mix until all ingredients are folded through. I use my hands. Don\u2019t overmix. The seeds and salt just need to be worked evenly through the dough.\nLeave the dough to proof for about 3 hours, folding it every 45 minutes. This strengthens the dough. Think of the dough as a square and fold its four corners inwards and over itself. If it is a cold day I use the oven to proof. Turn the oven on 50C for 5 minutes. Then turn it OFF and leave the bowl inside.\nIn 3 hours or so the dough will be light and stretchy. Drop the dough into a greased 1lb loaf tin lined with baking paper cut to size. Leave somewhere warm until the dough has risen and is 1cm away from the tin\u2019s lip or until it looks puffy. If it\u2019s a cold day, I use the oven method again. Store in the fridge overnight.\nThe next day, heat oven to 220C with a fan. Sprinkle water over the top of the loaf and score it longways down the middle with a sharp knife. A serrated one works well. Don\u2019t score the loaf right to its edges. Bake for 50 minutes.\n\nAny suggestions or advice super appreciated!

I made one yesterday that was significantly overproofed. So I cut my process to about 9 hours to try and find the right range again that works in my house conditions.

Short story long, I initially was following @msemilrose11 TikTok starter recipe for maybe 4 days? Then I realized 1 cup of APF  was just too much. I had a giant case of starter (pic 1) and I figured it was ridiculous to keep this much flour. My ratios were discard half, 1 cup flour, and 1 cup water and feed for 24 hours.

{"title": "I really need guidance--doughs keep overproofing but not rising, my starter is a year old", "selftext": "**My starter is over a year old** (March 2024), and every week on Friday or Saturday I take it out the fridge, let it warm up, and feed it. I don't measure the flour and water anymore, cause I've done it so often that I know what consistency is right. I always feed with all GV all purpose flour and bottled purified water. It always doubles at the least. I've made at least 5 loaves, bagels even more, and have made sourdough cinnamon rolls; so I'm still a beginner, but I'm not new to this completely. I always used KA bread flour for my loaves, and use either GV all purpose or KA bread flour for bagels (both successful). Starter was made here in Charlotte, which gets warmer and more-humid earlier in the year (than NY, where I'm from).\n\n  \nOn Saturday I made my first loaf with whole wheat flour (30%). I was confused on if it was under/overproofed, but based on some photos and articles I saw earlier, I now know it was overproofed (first photo). I'm not asking for guidance on [that recipe](https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2020/06/whole-wheat-sourdough-bread/#comments) specifically, **although I am confused on how** because after I found out that WW ferments faster, I put my dough in the fridge Friday night to slow down the fermentation. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I took it out the fridge, saw the dough was at same level, poked it, and set it out on top of the fridge to warm up. The recipe said it needed to double, and by like 4pm, it was a little under the doubled mark; but really wet, sticky, and not airy at all. If anything I thought it was be underproofed because of that. That was really depressing, but the results of my loaves have been all over the place, and that was WW and high hydration so I gave myself grace.\n\n  \nHowever, my bagels **ALWAYS** turn out great--aside from one overproofing a couple of months ago after putting it in the fridge to slow down and that messing up the process I guess. I made another batch between then and now that came out perfect. I needed to make more so I made the dough last night. Let me start by saying I've used [this recipe](https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-bagels-recipe/) about every 1-2 months in the last year, so I am **very familiar** with the recipe and my process. I feed my starter same day, and then between 11pm-12am I make the dough, I set an alarm usually around 10am to check the dough, I bulk ferment for 10-12 hours, and then shape and do 2nd rise, etc. Every time I do this, my dough doubles at the least, is light and airy, and rises to near the top of the bowl. I started the bulk ferment at 12:15am, checked it at 10am, and it didn't rise AT ALL. In the hours since, I moved it to the top of the fridge, kept doing the poke test, and at 1pm finally decided to shape and bake even though it still didn't really rise (second photo). The dough was sticky, dense, and wouldn't hold shape; so I immediately knew it was overproofed (based on that experience a few weeks ago). What I can't figure out is HOW, when I keep checking my dough and am not seeing a rise!!\n\nKitchen temp was 79 last night and 77 when I woke up this morning, so although it's getting warmer outside, I've made bagels in these temps and higher in the last year. I use a metal bowl (cause that's what I have, third photo).\n\n  \nCan anyone shed some light on what might be going on? Why are my doughs not rising?? My bagels are the one thing I can rely on, and even they're not doing what they're supposed to and I'm starting to lose hope. I'm also unemployed and flour is notttt cheap.

Especially given my demoralizing first frisbee attempt.\n\nI moved to Iceland since the first attempt and no longer have access to a Dutch oven so I\u2019ve been trying baking it covered with parchment paper and then uncovered on a baking sheet as well as in a pot (don\u2019t have a lid for it) I found in the house.

After 25 mins you put the oven on 210 degrees, take off the paper and bake for 15-30 min.\u201d\n\nOther Notes:\n\n- I don\u2019t have a kitchen aid mixer so instead of blending I basically did what most videos show and mixed until a shaggy dough. The first loaf I put in the fridge overnight but the second I left on the counter overnight.\n\n- Tap water here in Iceland is amazing so I just use warm tap water.\n\n- Since looking at other recipes I might do 500g flour like I\u2019ve seen in other recipes because of hydration or something but it still seems to come out ok using 550g.\n\n- The bottom layer is a bit dense and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because of how I\u2019m cooking it or if it\u2019s something else.

I've only made 14 loaves so far and you can see in my collage (image 1) my progress.

However, I want to get them even better, specifically I would like them a bit puffier/rounder.  \nThere is a lot of variation on each loaf on the collage since I have been experimenting. Most of the flat ones were made with my starter used at it's peak, so I went back to using it hungry (I seem to be getting better results that way).\n\nFor my most recent loaf (image 2), i used [Preppy Kitchen's Recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/sourdough-bread/),   \n310 grams warm water  \n120 grams active starter   \n500 grams bread flour   \n10 grams fine sea salt (I don't like them very salty)\n\nI mix the starter with the water, then add the flour and the salt and let it rest at room temp for 1 hour, then I do 4 sets of 4 strech and folds every 20 mins. I let it bulk ferment for 6-7 hours at 22C (72F), it rose to about 150%. Then I shaped it, let it rest at room temp for 30 mins, then in the fridge for an hour and then I baked it. I do that by preheating the over at 250C (482F), when I insert the loaf I turn it down to 230C (446F). I bake about 20' covered and another 20' uncovered  \nI have been experimenting with BF times and rising levels, especially after I saw lots of people here talking about how most people are under fermenting.\n\nUsing the exact same recipe, loaf 11 was BF-ed until 75% rise, and loaves 12 & 13 to 100%.\n\nI have noticed that no matter how much i let it BF I have never gotten big bubbles and a smooth surface. Image 3 of the dough of my most recent loaf was taken at 6-7 hours of BF, right before I shaped it. You can see holes of where bubbles have burst but no actual bubbles holding shape.

{"title": "Waxy / gummy air pockets?", "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post on Reddit ever about my first sourdough loaf ever. \n\nI follow several tik tok sourdough-ers.

From what I\u2019ve read, looks like under fermentation. But it is that my starter is under fermented (she\u2019s too young to bake with yet) or she didn\u2019t proof enough on counter or in fridge?\n\nAdditional information - we have windows and doors open to the outside as much as possible. The temp dropped Saturday night so Sunday morning was significantly chillier than ideal. When I started about 6am feeding starter it was 55F but had the windows and doors closed, as it warmed up around 11 we opened the doors and windows and it was about 63F and reached high of 70F around 3 during bulk fermentation on the counter. \n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9vy3q", "created_utc": 1745848016.0, "score": 1, "author": "-what_the_elle-", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k9vy3q/waxy_gummy_air_pockets/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Need input to fix sourdough", "selftext": "Haven\u2019t been baking sourdough for too long (since Feb?). I made my own starter with AP flour (no yeast just the natural way) and no I don\u2019t think it\u2019s floats tbh but it\u2019s been making something of a bread so it can\u2019t be too far off. Need advice on how to make it float. It does grow after feeds like normal. As for the bread itself\u2026\n\nMy current process is: \n\n3.5 cups AP flour \n1 1/3 cups water\n1/2 cup starter \n2 tsp salt\nCombine and let sit in the bowl with a wet dish towel over it for 30 mins. Then I do 4 sets of stretch and folds where I (you guessed it) stretch and fold it 4 times, turning the bowl after each stretch and fold. \n\nI do this process in the evening. After the last stretch and fold, I make sure the dish towel is still damp and I put the bowl in the oven (off) with the light on overnight. In the morning, first thing, I take the bowl out of the oven and get my dough on a floured surface (my wood cutting board). So far, there\u2019s only been one time where I took it out in the morning and the top layer of the dough had become almost hardened(?), I still used it anyways thinking it would rehydrate but after the bake I could see it as like a layer when I cut the loaf. That was a bit weird. Anyways. I turn it into a ball and let it hang out while I make my breakfast and eat. Then I flour the now dry dish towel, shape the dough by bringing the sides together in both directions, put the dough on the towel, and plop it into the bowl. I fold the towel over the dough, and then put the whole bowl in a plastic bag and tie it up. I put the bowl in the fridge and go to work. I then bake it that night. (I work normal 9-5 hrs) When I bake it, I preheat my ENAMELED dutch oven filled with water in the oven at 450\u00b0F for 30 mins. Then I toss the water, quickly dry the dutch oven, lightly flour the inside of the dutch oven, and plop my dough in (I don\u2019t take it out of the fridge until this point). To score it, I use a knife because I don\u2019t have a scorer (don\u2019t judge lol).

Also looking for advice about how to score with a knife if possible, trying not to buy a bunch of accessories.

Overnight proof in the oven with the light on. Rose beautifully but CRAZY sticky. Went to go shape it and had no choice but to add flour. It was literally soup, before the overnight rise it was a fantastic texture. Added maybe 1/4 cup of flour and it was a good texture again. Folded it up into its shape. Put it back in the oven with the light on for the final rise and nothing. Waited an hour. Then waited another hour. And then one more just to be sure, my house is kinda cold. Huh. Weird. Warmed the oven a little bit and then turned it off. Waited about 2 more hours, nothing  like at all. It looked exactly like it looked when I put it in there. \n\nI\u2019m about to just bake it and see what happens but what am I doing wrong?! Did adding more flour ruin it? Then why was it a dud the first time? Because no stretch and folds? Why does everything else come out good but bread is not?

{"title": "First attempt! Not bad, not great", "selftext": "I began my starter about 8 days ago and it\u2019s more than doubling in size every day. I made my first attempt at a loaf of sourdough today. It\u2019s honestly delicious and looks great from the outside! I\u2019m super proud of the outcome and this is a great starting point to improve from!\n\nWould love any feedback from the community on how I did and where I could improve. Admittedly, I messed up on one potentially crucial part, I fed my started 24 hours before using it instead of 12. I was too excited to wake up today and try my first loaf by the time I realized my mistake, so I decided to just give it a go anyways knowing this would be a learning experience.\n\nI followed the recipe in this video and used a Dutch oven to bake it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dtWFkODWxBg?si=lLOAiS-FKU-jnLlc\n\nRECIPE:\nFor accuracy, I highly recommend using measurements in grams as listed below rather than volumetric (cups/tsp). \n\nIngredients:\n\u25aaLeaven (make this 12 hours before mixing your dough)\n\u25aa100g (7T) water at 90\u00b0F / 32\u00b0C\n\u25aa25g (1T) ripe sourdough starter (fed 10-12 hours before mixing leaven)\n\u25aa100g (3/4c) bread flour (12.7% protein) \n\nBread: \n\u25aa275g (1c + 2T) water at 92\u00b0F/33C\n\u25aaRipe leaven (see above)\n\u25aa400g (3 1/4c) bread flour (12.7% protein)\n\u25aa50g (1/3c) whole wheat flour (14% protein) \n\u25aa12g (2t) salt\n\nStep 1: Build the Leaven (do this about 12 hours before mixing dough)\n1. In a bowl, mix 100g of 90F water with 25g  ripe sourdough starter.\n2. Add 100g bread flour to the mixture and stir until well combined and no lumps remain.\n3. Cover the bowl and let it sit at room temperature for 12-14 hours. The leaven should become frothy, bubbly, and increase in size.\n\nStep 2: Mix the Dough\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine 275g 92F water with all of the ripe leaven. Stir until the leaven is dissolved in the water.\n2. Add 400g bread flour, 50g whole wheat flour, and 12g salt to the mixture.\n3. Use a sturdy spoon to mix the ingredients until a dry clump forms. Then, wet your hand and use it to squeeze and fold the dough until it is homogeneous and there are no dry spots.\n\nStep 3: Bulk Fermentation\n1. First Rest: Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.\n2. First Fold: After 30 minutes, grab a portion of the dough, stretch it until you feel resistance, then fold it over itself. Repeat 5-6 times, then flip the dough and round it into a ball. Cover and let rest (a second time) for another 30 minutes.\n3. Second Fold/Final Ferment: Repeat the folding process one more time after the second 30-minute rest. After this, cover the dough and place it in a warm spot (about 90-95\u00b0F/35C) to ferment for 2 more hours.\n\nStep 4: Shaping Dough\n1. Lightly flour a cutting board and flip the dough out onto the floured surface. Grab opposite sides of the dough, pull them out, and fold over each other. Rotate the dough and repeat a total of at least 4 times.\n2. Flip the dough over onto the folds and round it while stretching the top down and under to create tension.\n3. If using a proofing basket, dust it with flour. If using a bowl, line it with a tea towel (kitchen towel) and dust with flour.\n4. Place the shaped dough seam side up in the basket. Give it a few more pull out and folds as shown in the video to create added tension. \n\nStep 5: Proofing\n1. Cover and let proof in a warm place for 60-90 minutes.\n2.  After 60-90 minutes, the dough should have increased in size by about 60%. To test, gently poke the dough; if it slowly bounces back, it is ready to bake. Judge proofing by the way the dough looks, reacts to the poke not the time. Proofing in a cool room will take much longer than in a warm room. \n\nStep 6: Baking\n1. Preheat your Dutch oven in a 475\u00b0F/245C oven. \n2. Carefully flip the proofed dough onto a piece of parchment paper sprinkled with semolina flour. \n3. Use scissors to make 5-6 angled snips on the dough. \n4. Initial bake:  Place the dough and parchment paper into the preheated Dutch oven, cover with the lid, and bake for 15 minutes. \n5. Final bake: Remove the lid and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k9edbi", "created_utc": 1745787626.0, "score": 7, "author": "Ryukun", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k9edbi/first_attempt_not_bad_not_great/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Maybe a bit underproofed?", "selftext": "The loaf tastes great but I feel like it didn\u2019t fully rise any feedback is appreciated \n\nDOUGH INGREDIENTS\nFlour - 600g\nWater - 450g (75% of the flour weight) **\nStarter - 90g (15% of the four weight)\nSalt - 18g (3% of the flour weight)\n**TIP - One variation to consider. The amount of water can vary between 70-80%. The more you hydrate, the harder/stickier it is to work with the dough. But the 80% hydration is (in my opinion) better tasting and moist. I would recommend you use 75%, but I use a generous amount of water when I fold the dough to help with hydration. It is still fantastic either way.\nWhen making the dough I mix the starter and water thoroughly, then add the flour gradually and the salt is added with the last 1/3 of flour. You do not need to mix vigorously, but you do want the flour completely mixed into the dough. It may be slightly lumpy. Cover bowl with dish towel and let sit for an hour.\nThe dough will need to be folded at least 2-3 times every 30 minutes after the first hour. You will feel the consistency change each time. Use You-Tube videos to see how to do this, but basically you want to get your hands wet, then grab the dough from the bottom/ middle and pull it straight up and fold it over the top. I shake the dough slightly to see its elasticity. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and do the same thing until you get to the starting point. Once completed, I take the whole loaf up and flip it over, seam side down. Cover with dish towel, keep in warm dry place and set timer for 30 minutes and repeat.\nOnce folded 3+ times, cover and let rest for 6+ hrs or overnight. The dough will double in size.\n\nBAKING THE BREAD\nWhen you are ready to cook preheat the oven and pan (with lid) to 450 degrees. You can use ceramic or Dutch oven, but you need to have a secure fit for the lid.\nWhile they are preheating, scrape dough onto a floured flat surface and fold similarly to the earlier version, but I elongate the dough so final shape looks like a loaf of bread. Transfer loaf, seam side down on parchment paper and let rest for 30-60 minutes in a separate loaf pan. When the oven, pan and loaf are all ready, transfer dough into preheated pan, slice a line down the middle for split, recover pan and place a lower center rack. Ovens vary, but I set my alarm for 24-25 minutes. Once ready, remove cover and cook an additional 18-19 minutes. The loaf will have risen to its full height with a crack down the middle will have appeared.

Anyway , I really really struggled to do any real shaping due to how slack the dough was as how much it stuck to my hands . \n\nFinal result - quite a flat loaf.

If I tweaked anything, it was minor.\n\nI did 4 stretch and folds every 30 minutes after mixing. I bulk fermented for about 7-8 hours total (waited til I saw 40-50 percent of growth, air bubbles, and a jiggle). Did my 1st shaping (stretched the dough out into a square without tearing, folded in the right side, folded in the left, and rolled from the bottom as I tucked the sides in simultaneously, then I did about 8 candy can coils). Let it bench rest for 25 minutes. Did the 2nd shaping and put it in the proofing basket dusted with rice flour. Covered with a plastic clear shower cap. Cold proofed for 14 hours.\n\nThe tweaks I made during that part of the process were a longer bulk fermentation and a longer cold proof. \n\nI followed the cooking instructions from the recipe as well but I added an extra 15 minutes of uncovered bake time to allow for a more golden crust. \n\nThere was a definite improvement in the crumb! And crust color!\n\nMy first loaf\u2019s bottom was pretty tough and hard to cut through. Not burnt, just hard. With my first loaf, I preheated my dutch oven for 1 hour. This time, I only preheated for 30 minutes and I also placed a cookie sheet on the rack below my dutch oven to stop the heat from directly hitting the bottom. There was an improvement, but still needs some work. \n\n\nOverall, I\u2019m super proud and happy with the results of my 2nd one and the little improvements I\u2019m seeing from the little tweaks!\n\nAny tips or suggestions?

It gave sugar and increased the acidity to help create selection pressure for the right bacteria and yeast. So I thought at the very least,  some acid might help.  I splashed in about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with the next feeding. In 3 days of normal feeding after, it went to almost tripling in size.

{"title": "6th Loaf what do I need? :)", "selftext": "Hi! The taste is delightful and so is the texture but I feel like the bubbles are tiny. Is this fine? How do I make them bigger? \n\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine 310g 92F water with the ripe leaven 200g. Stir until the leaven is dissolved in the water. \n2. Add 400g bread flour, 50g whole wheat flour, and 12g salt to the mixture. \n3. Use a sturdy spoon to mix the ingredients until a dry clump forms. Then, wet your hand and use it to squeeze and fold the dough until it is homogeneous and there are no dry spots. \n\nStep 3: \nBulk Fermentation \n1. First Rest: Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes. \n\n2. First Fold: After 30 minutes, grab a portion of the dough, stretch it until you feel resistance, then fold it over itself. Repeat 5-6 times, then flip the dough and round it into a ball. Cover and let rest (a second time) for another 30 minutes. \n\n3. Second Fold/Final Ferment: Repeat the folding process one more time after the second 30-minute rest. After this, cover the dough and place it in a warm spot (about 90-95\u00b0F/35C) to ferment for 2-3 more hours. \n\nStep 4: \nShaping Dough \n\n1. Lightly flour a cutting board and flip the dough out onto the floured surface. Grab opposite sides of the dough, pull them out, and fold over each other. Rotate the dough and repeat a total of at least 4 times. \n2. Flip the dough over onto the folds and round it while stretching the top down and under to create tension. \n3. If using a proofing basket, dust it with flour. If using a bowl, line it with a tea towel (kitchen towel) and dust with flour. \n4. Place the shaped dough seam side up in the basket. Give it a few more pull out and folds as shown in the video to create added tension. \n\nStep 5: \nProofing \n1. Cover and let proof in a warm place for 60-90 minutes. \n2. After 60-90 minutes, the dough should have increased in size by about 60%. To test, gently poke the dough; if it slowly bounces back, it is ready to bake. Judge proofing by the way the dough looks, reacts to the poke not the time. Proofing in a cool room will take much longer than in a warm room. \n\nStep 6: \nBaking: \n\nBaking in a Dutch Oven \n1. Preheat your Dutch oven in a 500 degree oven. \n2. Carefully flip the proofed dough onto a piece of parchment paper sprinkled with semolina flour. \n3. Use scissors to make 5-6 angled snips on the dough. \n4. Initial bake: Place the dough and parchment paper into the preheated Dutch oven, cover with the lid, and bake for 16 minutes at 485 degrees.\n5. Final bake: Remove the lid and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes at 465 degrees.l\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/aijxc1y6g2xe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745623939.0, "score": 4, "author": "Alert_Raccoon7", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k7z3ax/6th_loaf_what_do_i_need/", "html_title": ""}

With Robin Hood's Unbleached AP Flour, the dough is always very elastic and easy to work with. But when I use Arva's Daisy flour, I had to lower the hydration to 61% to avoid a goopy mess.\n\nHowever, even at 61% hydration, the dough was still extremely slack when I poured it out to the bench for the final shaping after bulk fermentation was done. \n\nThe dough didn't rise as much during the bulk fermentation, and in the final proof, it took less time to finish proofing compared to my usual dough made with Robin Hood's Unbleached AP flour.\n\nI think the gluten in the Daisy flour seems to degrade throughout the fermentation process much more quickly. This might be why when I feed my starter with the Daisy flour, it would always collapse really shortly after it peaked.\n\nI still ended up with a loaf that has nice oven spring, crumb, structure, and flavour, but the dough wasn't easy to work with at all, and due to the much lower hydration, the crumb was not as soft as I wanted, and the crust was also thicker and harder.\n\nI'm absolutely not saying you shouldn't buy Arva's Daisy flour or that the flour isn't good; just wanted to give you a heads-up that you might need to drastically decrease the hydration of your usual recipes.\n\n# Recipe for the loaf\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 320g Arva Daisy white flour\n* 80g Arva Red Fife whole wheat flour\n* 247g water\n* 9g salt\n* 80g matured starter\n* 20g oil\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1.

Grind it up and save it for disasters.\n\n(For example, if it gets contaminated by mold or you drop your glass \"Mother\" jar, you can \"rehydrate\" and bring it back to life.)\n\n\n\n\\#3 Even if you have a Proofing Box (Brod & Taylor), measure everything to the exact gram and follow every step to the minute.\n\nSome loaves will still be \"only fair\".\n\n(Here in Kentucky) Humidity changes A LOT in the apartment between winter (10%) and summer (40%-65%).\n\nWhether I have the Heat, fan, nothing, or Air Conditioner on makes a difference.\n\nIn the winter, I tend to get more \"big, round, beautiful, turkey-shaped\" battards.\n\n\n\nIn the Spring/Summer . . . I might get flatter/pyramidal loaves.  (like this #500)\n\n\n\n\\#4 Not including air in the Stretch and Fold segments (and the Final Shaping) is essential.\n\n(Naturally, since #500 was important . . . I managed to get one big air bubble in the middle of the loaf.  LOL.)\n\n\n\n\\#5 Once you find a starter recipe you like . . . you can adjust timing by adjusting Hydration %, and \n\nStarter% % (both in the Levain and the main batch) to better match the timing of your life schedule.\n\nThe above times are quite different from the original Culinary Exploration times.  \n\nBut it leaves me more midday time free to run errands. \n\nAnd Time after 5 pm if I choose to go out to eat.\n\nIt also makes it easier to bake two days in a row (for me at least), for the rare times I do that.\n\nI've got that \"gap\" between 9:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. to clean the battards, mix the bowls, and measure another batch of water/flour into the containers.\n\n  \n\n\\#6 sourdough's \"low glycemic index\" doesn't spike my blood sugar.  And it is easier to digest.  (It digests more slowly.)\n\n\n\n\\#6 It's rewarding. It's gratifying to find a few friends or club members who like your bread and occasionally bring them a surprise loaf.\n\nIt's just nice to be able to Make Something that's valuable.\n\n\n\nIf you have the time, give it a shot.\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/574a8637wzwe1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1745593350.0, "score": 3, "author": "PhesteringSoars", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k7n4zj/loaves_499_and_500/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "failure + a bit success but still failure.", "selftext": "I made my first loaf about a week ago and I\u2019d say it turned out pretty good for my first loaf. I\u2019ll insert a picture below (Figure 1). I used All Purpose flour (wegmans bread) Unbleached because I had some leftover and I used it for my starter too. I cut the original recipe I had in half and made one loaf: \n\nOLD RECIPE FOR FIRST LOAF (FIGURE 1):\n\n1. 8am: Mix 500g flour and 375g water. Let it rest for an hour \n\n2. 9am: An hr later, pinch in 110g active starter (I used after peak) and 10g salt with a tiny splash of water. \n\n3. 10 min later: stretch the living shit out of it for 10 min. \n\n4. 10:30ish Am: An hour later: Stretch and folds continuously every hour until consistency is right. \n\n5. 2:30pm I think I got my consistency all right (so I did about 5-6 stretch and folds). \n\n6. I checked every 30 min to do poke test with a wet finger, look at bubbles, pull away from sides.. at 6pm (9 hours later), I believe my dough had bulk fermented correctly. I tried all the above methods and it pulled away from the bowl nicely. \n\n7. Shaped like twice with a 7 min break in between lol cuz I didn\u2019t know what I was doing but I figured more couldn\u2019t hurt..? \n\n8. 7pm: Cold proof\n\n9. NEXT MORNING: 7am: put Dutch oven into oven, at 450\u00b0 F, only put it in there until oven was done preheating. Scored dough and put it into Dutch oven with a silicon mat with those flaps. \n\n10. Baked for 25 min with lid on. Did NOT turn down temp. Baked for 25-30 min with lid off. I wanted it to be brown haha..\ud83e\udee0 but it looks GOOD. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: \n\n- I bought new flour! King Arthur\u2019s Unbleached all purpose (not bread flour). I wanted to try cookies later so I thought if I bought this one it would work out and I wanted to try name brand since everyone raves about it. \n\n- Yday I decided I wanted to make two loaves and I was following a girl from TikTok (gigis eloise). \n\nRecipe: \n\n725g warm filtered water\n250g active sourdough starter (eloise)\n30g salt\n1000g bread flour\nmix ingredients together\n- let sit for one hour\n- perform 4 sets of stretch and folds or coil and folds every 30 mins for 2 hours\n- bulk ferment on counter for 4 hours\n- split dough into 2 loafs and roll into their balls, can add inclusions here\n- refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 4 days\n- when ready to bake, score and bake at 500 degrees with the lid on for 35 mins, then lower to 450 degrees and bake for 10 mins with the lid off (watching for color)\n \n(This is copy and pasted from her page, I take no credit). \n\nSo I watched some videos and her loaves come out perfect. I saw that she didn\u2019t autolyse her dough like I did last time, she did beat it a bit which I didn\u2019t see till now I was rewatching. So I tried it out because I felt like my last recipe was too complicated with the waiting an extra hour and THEN incorporating the starter and salt even if it worked out great. \n\nSo I made the shaggy dough, it was wet. Very wet. I did some stretching and kneeding with my hands (5 min worth) after making the dough. It was liquidy but I decided to anyways let it go through. I did about 8 stretch and folds (Every 30 min) and this dough WOULD NOT GET STRONGER. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the flour I used, the temp was fairly similar to last week, my starter is STRONG (i got it from my aunt and I see her loaves are always amazing but she lives in pennsylvania and she said she follows the tiktok recipe above). I live in NJ, the humidity is fairly similar to here and Philly. Anyways it was just a liquid mess and it was NOT because of overproofing (I don\u2019t think so). Anyways I decided I lost hope with this dough and let it overproof overnight, and made focaccia at 5am. \n\nIts taste is sour because I used pickled jalape\u00f1os - like extremely sour (esp to my parents that are old and don\u2019t like tasty stuff anymore\ud83e\udd28). And I also made a brown butter cinnamon focaccia. It was eh. I just know both of them are gonna taste so bad when they lose the \u201cwarm bread\u201d feeling. \n\nAnyways I feel so beaten up after the worst two days of baking I\u2019ve ever had. I was really beating that dough yday. Can someone tell me why it was really liquidy and what I can do to make it work?? And I need some hopecore to inspire me again. Should I switch my flour to bread flour?? Why did it work with wegmans bread but not King Arthur and I wasted money\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso the first loaf I did make, it was alright but the crust was REALLY chewy and hard.

{"title": "The Misadventures of Loof the Loaf", "selftext": "Ladies, Gents, and Scoundrels!\n\n\u00a0\n\nI present to you... Loof the Loaf! While she may not seem very impressive in her size, shape, colour, or ear, the entire life story of Loof is quite extraordinary! So bear with me while I stretch and I fold you a tall tale of the trials and tribulations of a loaf's life.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLoof the Loaf had all the cards set against her from the beginning... She started out from a half dead starter in a cold cold kitchen (about 17C), that was then placed in a slowly cooling oven in hopes of reviving it. However, the oven was not as cool as the mighty Creator had thought (at least 50C), and the Mother Starter was liquified and separated. The mighty Creator (a 22 year old with ADHD living in a large and wild Dutch student house), then decided that the worst that could happen is just another failed loaf and went forward with the making of Loof anyway.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSometimes the power of creation lands in the wrong hands...\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn her most evil and careless ways the creator measured out about 300g of flour, 200g of water, and 100g of questionable Mother Starter, which she mixed well in a bowl, to be forgotten for 2.5h while she helped decorate her roommate\u2019s birthday cake. When poor, neglected, foetal Loof was remembered, she had already developed a very nice window worthy gluten structure. However, that was when creator remembered that she had forgotten the salt...\n\n\u00a0\n\nTruth is, the decade old digital scale of questionable origins is not able to accurately measure out 20 grams of salt, and tends to read 0 up until you put something at least 7g on it. So in her infinite wisdom the wicked creator simply eyeballed the salt, which she combined with the dough by pinching it in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLoof the Loaf was then stretched and folded several times whenever Creator remembered her in between talking with her roommates and decorating a glorious Bibble cake. At that point Loof was beginning to think that her life might turn for the better. She was transferred to the kitchen table where she was folded once again, and let to relax. However, that is when one of the creator\u2019s housemates birthday began and she was forgotten once again!\n\n\u00a0\n\nPoor, neglected Loof\u2026.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter a 1.5h ritual sacrificing the amazing Bibble cake to the Barbie gods, the Creator remembered her project once again, so Loof was folded and let to relax once again. This process was repeated one more time, at which point midnight was approaching and it had been more than 6 hours since the start of the creation process. Thus, the creator decided to just put it in a bowl to leave on the counter overnight so that it might rise at least a little bit\u2026 (at this point it was looking like Loof might never grow\u2026)\n\n\u00a0\n\nLoof the Loaf did her best to rise\u2026 But there is only so much you can do when the world has shown you so little care.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo the Creator awoke to disappointment; despite the having been left for 9 hours, Loof was not looking ready to be born, and the creator had to leave for work at 2 pm.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDisappointed the Creator turned her attention away from her ruined child, towards her other, more successful offspring \u2013 a sweater she had finished knitting. It was time to block it. So she took out her foam blocking board and pins. That is when a brilliant idea struck her\u2026 The blocking board was made of foam! A brilliant insulation material! If Loof the Loaf\u2019s and Mother Starter\u2019s biggest problem was a cold house, an insulation chamber could be built for them from the pieces of the blocking mat!\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd that was what the creator did \u2013 she connected the pieces of her blocking board into a cube, into which she put 2 large jars of very hot water, and her bowl with Loof. Finaly! Loof was given what she needed to thrive. And so she did! In just 2 hours, she had (almost) risen enough. Due to time constraints, the creator decided to shape her right then (she accidentally trapped some dry flour in the loaf here - oops), and put her in the preheated oven just 30 minutes after shaping.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the exact temperature of the oven is hard to determine (it, too, is at least a decade old, and wasn\u2019t good even when it was originally bought), the creator\u2019s best guess is that it was preheated to at least 250C.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA content, if not entirely ready Loof was transferred into a Dutch oven, where it was left to grow for 20 minutes. The lid was then taken off and Loof was cooked for another 25 minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter that Loof was taken out of the oven and rested on a cutting board, where the creator and some of her friends stared at her longingly. As the creator was running late for work, she decided to cut Loof after 40 minutes, while she was still a little warm. And oh! What a beauty! Sometimes things thrive despite all odds. One can only imagine what Loof could have become if she had been treated with the appropriate amount of love!\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile the creator ran to work, her housemates praised and enjoyed the loaf;\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d declared housemate 1.\n\n\u201cReminds me of an artisanal loaf I once had in Austria,\u201d texted housemate 2.\n\n\u201cthe bread turned out AMAZING I love it omg proud <3\u201d whatsapped housemate 3.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo there you have it, a story of triumph\u2026 sort of\u2026 against all odds. May this inspire you in your own journey of creation. If you have an oven and some time you too can create a Loof!\n\nSometimes the pursuit of perfection goes against the pursuit of happiness, but you embrace flaws you can still have nice things.\n\n  \nIn the pictures you can see:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me working on the loaf,\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The loaf straight out of the oven\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The loaf cut 40 mins after it came out of the oven\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My blocking matt warm box setup\n\n5-6.

{"title": "Very first loaf", "selftext": "\n\nThis is my very first loaf. I was pretty overwhelmed with the process, and decided to just get this first bake out of the way. I fed my starter in the morning at 6:00 am. My starter was active, bubbly and seemed to be peaked after work, so I started my process about 3:30 pm. My dough temped at 76 degrees, so looking at charts, it seemed I should be looking for at least 30% increase (I ended BF at 40%). At 10:30 pm last night, I shaped my loaf, and placed it in the fridge. This evening after making dinner (so approximately 20 hours in the fridge). I used a pampered chef stone loaf pan covered with a run of the mill loaf pan (that's what I had on hand - didn't seem wise to invest a bunch of $ if I end up not enjoying this process). I was going for sandwich bread, so overall I think I am happy with how this turned out.\nCan I please get some feedback on my first loaf? Below is the recipe I used. \n\nMix 150g starter, 325g water.  Add 20g olive oil, 25g honey mix until milky. Add 500g unbleached flour and 10g salt, mix until you get a shaggy dough. Let rest 1 hour. \n\nPerform 2 sets of stretch and folds and two sets of stretch and coils, 30 minutes apart. Spray or wet your hands to prevent sticking. \n\nCover and let the dough continue to bulk ferment at room temperature for 4\u20138 hours (or overnight if your home is cooler). Bulk Fermentation time will depend on your dough temperature. Check chart. \n\nDump the dough from the bowl onto a clean surface. Spray or wet hands with water to prevent sticking. Gently shape the dough into a loaf by stretching it into a rectangle, folding in the right side to the middle, then the left side into the middle, and rolling upward into a log. Place it seam-side down in a well greased loaf pan. \n\nTwo options for second rise: \n\n1. Same day option:\u00a0Let it proof at room temperature for\u00a0about 2 more hours before baking.\n2. Overnight cold proof:\u00a0Let it cold proof in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24hrs. \n\nPreheat oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Score the top of the dough and spray it lightly with water. Cover with an inverted second loaf pan to trap steam for the softest loaf. If desired, line pan with parchment, pop 4 ice cubes underneath for steaming. Bake for 30 minutes at 400\u00b0F, then uncover and bake for 15 minutes at 375\u00b0F.\n\nUse a digital thermometer to check for doneness. Bread is fully baked when the internal temperature reaches 205\u00b0F (96\u00b0C).\n\nCool completely before slicing. \n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k79pyd", "created_utc": 1745546758.0, "score": 2, "author": "Vegetable_Active4813", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k79pyd/very_first_loaf/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "First loaf vs Fourth loaf", "selftext": "I birthed my sourdough starter at the beginning of the year. I baked my first loaf January 25... I don't remember exactly what I did, but I think I bulk fermented overnight, but it was taking forever because it was winter and my kitchen was cold and I couldn't tell what was qoing on. I think I used the basic recipe from the book Artisan Sourdough Made Simple. The inside of my first loaf was very unsightly and it didn't have much tang, but it was still edible and tasted fine. \n\nAfter not touching my starter for weeks, I decided to wake it up the other day and make a loaf for sandwiches. Looked at my jar, oops, last fed 3/15. But after stirring in the hooch and doing two feeds, it was very bubbly and begging me to use it. So I pulled up this recipe: https://alexandracooks.com/2017/10/24/artisan-sourdough -made-simple-sourdough-bread-demystified-a-beginners-guide -to-sourdough-baking/ and got going. I mixed it up Tuesday morning and did 3 stretch and folds, beginning BF around 1:15. It was a warm day and I had all the windows opened, so at about 8:45 it was looking increased by 50%, so I went for it and did my shaping. Then I covered it up nicely and put it in the fridge overnight. I pulled it out and got ready to bake around 11 the next day. I have a baking steel and dome and let the steel preheat with the oven, but I only heated the oven to 500 F rather than the 550 in the recipe because that's what I felt more comfortable with. I put two ice cubes in under the dome, then after removing the dome, I pulled the baking steel out and cooked on the rack for the last 13 minutes. \n\nI think it's my most delicious loaf yet! It has some big weird bubbles, but when I look at my first loaf, I see a big difference! (Loaves 2 and 3 were probably just 25% more attractive than loaf 1) \n\nTakeaways: \n- sourdough starters can take some neglect, apparently\n- I really like the BF during the day and proof in the fridge overnight schedule\n- bread being delicious is the most important thing ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k79e48", "created_utc": 1745545750.0, "score": 5, "author": "bt_phonehome", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k79e48/first_loaf_vs_fourth_loaf/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Second attempt!", "selftext": "So last week I attempted sourdough bread for the first time, today I made my second loaf, while still not perfect, we are getting better. I picked up a Dutch oven and the crust definitely did better, I still dont have a bread lame though, so the scoring is crap, and despite the score I did with a knife, it still split on top. Wither way, it is MILES better than my last loaf. Recipe is the same as last time. I included a picture of my last loaf and my new loaf \"together\" for comparison sake. Recipe below. \n\n150 g sourdough starter\n300 g water\n480 g white bread flour (I personally used 400 g bread flour and 80 grams whole wheat)\n2 tsp salt\n\n1. Measure the starter to a large bowl and pour in the water. Stir well to combine\n\n2. Add the flour and salt. Stir again to combine and make sure there are no dry pockets of flour. Your dough will be sticky and shaggy. Cover with a clean towel to rest.\n\n3. After 30 minutes, grab a corner of the dough and pull it up and into the center. Repeat until you\u2019ve performed this series of folds 4 to 5 times with the dough. Let dough rest for another 30 minutes and repeat the stretching and folding action. Repeat this step 3 times every 30 minutes.\n\n4. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rise at room temperature, approximately 8 to 10 hours at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C), maybe even less if you live in a warm environment. The dough is ready when it has increased by 50% in volume, has a few bubbles on the surface, and jiggles when you move the bowl from side to side.\n\n5. Coax the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently shape it into a round: fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, fold the top down to the center, turn the dough, and repeat until you\u2019ve come full circle. If you have a bench scraper, use it to push and pull the dough to create tension.\n\n6. Let the dough rest seam side up rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, line an 8-inch (20-cm) bowl or proofing basket with a towel (flour sack towels are ideal) and dust with flour (preferably rice flour, which doesn\u2019t burn the way all-purpose flour does). Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape it again as described in step 4. Place the round into your lined bowl, seam side up.\n\n7. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 1 hour or for as long as 48 hours.\n\n8. Place a Dutch oven in your oven, and preheat your oven to 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C). Cut a piece of parchment to fit the size of your baking pot.\n\n9. Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Using the tip of a small knife or a razor blade, score the dough however you wish \u2014 a simple \u201cX\u201d is nice. Use the parchment to carefully transfer the dough into the preheated baking pot.\n\n10. Lower the oven to temperature to 450\u00baF (230\u00baC). Carefully cover the pot. Bake the dough for 30 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, lower the temperature to 400\u00baF (200\u00baC) and continue to bake for 10 \u2013 15 minutes more.

{"title": "Stretch and Folds Not Working?", "selftext": "TLDR: Dough not strengthening with stretch and folds, can't shape it well for rest of bulk fermentation / proofing. Looking for advice\n\nI began my sourdough journey 40 days ago and got to the point where I could start baking a couple weeks ago (starter consistently doubling every 4-6 hours with 1:2:2 feeding). I've tried baking a loaf 4 times now and each time I end with a sloppy mess. Some info:\n\n* **Starter:** I use a 50% WW / 50% bread flour starter\n   * Smelled acidic for awhile early on but fixed that with a couple 1:5:5 feed\n   * Had a nice sweet, yeasty smell for a few days, but in the last couple weeks has smelled funky (smelly feet /  maybe vomit?)\n   * No visible signs of mold. I use a new jar every time I feed\n   * Doubling reliably\n   * Feed it every day 2-3x/d depending on peaks. Does usually deflate a bit before I get to it\n* **Recipe:** I use 100g active/peaked starter, 500g bread flour, 375g 85 degree F filtered water (reduced this down to 348g on most recent batch)\n* **Process (where my issue is I think):**  I let the dough sit for 30 min after mixing. Begin stretch and folds, repeating 4x every 30 minutes. Then, let the dough bulk ferment for 8ish hours (as far as I've gotten)\n* **Environment:** My kitchen is kept at around 74 degrees F\n\nMy dough doesn't seem to be strengthening during the stretch and folds at all. Volume expands a bit (but certainly could be more), but it's still relatively sticky and \"wet\" by the end of the two hours and doesn't hold its shape. By the end of bulk fermentation, the dough sometimes seems even STICKIER and like the gluten broke down over the course of the 8 hours\n\nWhat is happening? How can I fix this?

{"title": "Struggling with whole grain buckwheat (gluten-free)", "selftext": "Hello.\n\nI am usually working with rye sourdough and I have a healthy batch I am feeding and using to bake bread.\n\nNow I have to keep a second batch with whole grain buckwheat flour, completely gluten-free.\n\nI made the starter and kept it rather wet. It has been over a week now and it tastes sour, but absolutely doesn't rise. Bubbles could be seen now and then on a few days.\n\nI read that because of the absent of gluten, buckwheat doesn't rise well - especially when the starter is kept wet.\n\nDaily, the surface became a bit dark. If my research was done correctly, it is because of buckwheat being very active and always starving for more.\n\nThat was a sign for me for it being ready, so I took out around 500g and mixed it with 1kg whole grain buckwheat flour, added water and salt, and made dough. It was rather creamy, since I had added a bit too much water.\n\nI put a clean cloth over it and wanted to let it ripe for ~48h. (That's what I usually do with my rye dough). After around 18h, I checked the dough and was happy to see it rising, since the dough wasn't as watery as the sourdough starter I had made.\n\nThe smell was pleasant and it reminded me of sausage. Now later, it is probably 26h now I think, the surface looked a bit dry and the smell was a kind of different, and I thought: Why not just stirr it again. And then it happened: It stank of rotten eggs/sulfur. Under the surface, it was all risen with lots of trapped air - that's how my rye dough also looks like after 1-2 days ripening. Stirring it made the smell go away.\n\nBut yeah, it is the smell that made me wonder whether something went wrong. After stirring it, the smell was gone and it smelled of buckwheat-sausage again.\n\nHere are a few of my ideas on what could have happened:\n\n- So, can a healthy buckwheat starter cause something like this, or did my starter secretly fail and isn't actually healthy? Like, was I too early and my starter needed more time to balance out bacteria? Is it still in the stage of developing and the current state is a fake result?\n\n- Is buckwheat so extremely active, that only 15h of dough ripening is already enough and the sourdough starved already even with 1kg buckwheat flour within such a short time and I definitely shouldn't try to ripen buckwheat dough for 24-48h?\n\n- Did I use too much sourdough starter, so it ripened so fast, that it started to starve? I think I accidently used around 600g of it with 1kg whole grain buckwheat flour and 800ml water.\n\n- Do I need to stirr buckwheat more frequently, even the ripening dough, after it had risen?\n\nI would appreciate it, if someone could share their experience with whole grain buckwheat sourdough. I tried to look for already given advice, but they were more about other grains than buckwheat, like to use a healthy starter and to feed it with buckwheat, until it turns into a gluten-free starter. Or to mix it with white rice flour, since it is easier to handle. That's the kind of advice I am unfortunately not looking for. It has to be about pure whole grain buckwheat flour.\n\nThank you for reading. If you need more details, please feel free to ask. I am usually not following strict rules when creating a new sourdough starter, but go with my gut feeling, which always worked until now. But I am really unsure about buckwheat, since the usual signs grains with gluten give, do not seem to apply the same way for buckwheat. I also watched videos and I didn't really do anything different from them, and my buckwheat sourdough batch still smells and tastes fine (it is in the fridge by now). It seems to be the dough I put away for ripening, that developed that rotten egg smell after a certain time. But to admit it, when creating the buckwheat starter, I never discarded anything but fed it a little bit every time. Nothing seemed off, smell was fine, taste was sour-fine and the bubbles were fine. Before using the starter, I fed and observed it for a bit more than a week (maybe 8 or 9 days) and everything seemed fine. Did I actually keep the bad cultures within my sourdough without noticing it?\n\nIdeally, I hope someone who handles buckheat could answer. But still, any helpful soul is welcome and I am thankful for your comments!\n\nEDIT: And in case someone knows more about chemical reactions during rementation: Can any of the nutritions in buckwheat cause such a smell? [Here](https://i.imgur.com/UHAH40W.jpeg) is the data of wohle grain buckwheat flour. The reason I am so stubborn with this, is, because the sourdough starter itself smells and tastes wonderful. It is the dough that turned out like this, but after the first 15h when it rose, it smelled and tasted wonderful, too. It just happened like at 26h or so. That makes me wonder, if I have to handle it very differently with times and stuff, since buckwheat is not really a classical grain.\n\nBook Source of the data: Food Composition and Nutrition Tables 9th edition.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/1k6b35u/struggling_with_whole_grain_buckwheat_glutenfree/", "created_utc": 1745444032.0, "score": 5, "author": "DontAskForTheMoon", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k6b35u/struggling_with_whole_grain_buckwheat_glutenfree/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Baking Sourdough in a Warm Climate (Part 1)", "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Maintaining a sourdough starter is *highly* dependent on your local climate. In tropical heat? It\u2019s a whole different game.\n\n**Background**\n\nI\u2019m a home baker based in Singapore, selling sourdough bread through a local online marketplace (think Amazon, but just for locals). I have no professional training and zero fancy equipment\u2014just my hands, a lot of practice, and a standard home oven. I bake about 10 to 15 loaves a day. Oh, and I also have a full-time corporate job. Baking started as a hobby\u2026 and kind of took over my life.\n\nAfter 30 years in London\u2014and 20 of those spent baking sourdough (plus the occasional pizza... but let\u2019s not go down that rabbit hole)\u2014I recently moved back to my hometown, Singapore.\n\nNaturally, I jumped straight back into baking. But wow\u2026 it felt like I\u2019d forgotten everything. My dough was overproofing, my timing was completely off, and my starter\u2014Stevie\u2014was having a full-blown identity crisis.\n\nSo, I went back to basics. This post kicks off a series where I\u2019ll share how I\u2019ve adapted my sourdough routine to life in a tropical climate.\n\n**First question: How do you even keep a sourdough starter alive in this heat?**\n\nBack in London, where kitchen temperatures ranged from 5\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C, I followed the usual advice: feed at a 1:1:1 ratio, leave the starter on the counter in summer, or in the oven with warm water during winter. Stevie usually doubled in 8\u201312 hours. Simple.\n\nThen came Singapore. Here, room temperature hovers around 28\u00b0C (on a rainy day) and climbs to 35\u00b0C on a sunny afternoon. I tried the same 1:1:1 routine and left Stevie on the counter\u2026 Rookie mistake. A few hours later, he had gone completely rogue\u2014overflowed the jar, made a mess, and looked ready to escape out the window. My mum was not impressed.\n\n# After weeks of trial, error, and sourdough soul-searching, here\u2019s what finally works for me:\n\n* Take Stevie out of the fridge\n* Use him straight from cold\u2014no warm-up needed\n* After baking, feed him using tap water (\\~27\u00b0C). I am not too hung up with the ratio. There is usually about couple of spoonful of Stevie left in the container. I will just add about 200g of water and 200g of flour. Stir. (btw, I have more than 1 container of Stevie in the fridge - this is for another post)\n* Pop him straight back into the fridge\n\nThat\u2019s it. Stevie now lives full-time in the fridge. No more counter time.\n\nI know this might sound very different from what most YouTube bakers recommend, but my setup is unique:\n\n* My kitchen stays between 27\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C\n* \u201cCold\u201d tap water is about 27\u00b0C\n* I bake 10\u201320 loaves a day, Monday to Friday\n\nSo if you're baking in the tropics and your starter\u2019s going haywire\u2014don\u2019t panic. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong. You just need to adjust your routine to your environment. Trust your instincts, experiment a little, and maybe give your starter a name. It helps.

{"title": "Help with bulk fermentation", "selftext": "Hello, I am new to sourdough and have a starter that is nearly 3 months old. I have been attempting to make some loafs and they kept coming out super dense and gummy (still tasted great though). I noticed whenever I decided to stop bulk fermenting the dough it was incredibly sticky - to the point that no matter how much flour I used or water I covered my hands and scraper with it was impossible to shape and just turned into a glob. I did a bit more research and found that the dough temperature is very very important and I hadn\u2019t been taking that into account at ALL. I was just following how long the person from whose recipe I used was bulk fermenting their dough. I have an incredibly warm home and my dough temperature is at around 81\u00b0. I took a look at the charts for bulk fermentation times according to dough temperature and inferred that I should let it bulk ferment around 3-4.5 hours. This seems to be a step in the right direction because this is my best loaf yet! The crumb feels less gummy and more airy when eating and it rose more in the oven. I know that it isn\u2019t perfect yet so I was wondering what you guys thought - is this under or over fermented? I will post pics some of my first attempts and the last couple will be todays loaf. Here is the recipe I used:\n\n500g bread flour\n320g room temperature water\n120g starter\n10g salt\n\nFinished mixing at 7:44 AM, let it rest an hour and did 3 sets of stretch and folds and 1 coil because the dough was quite resistant every 30 minutes. Let it keep bulk fermenting from 9:44 AM to 12:00 PM. Shaped and put in the fridge until the next day at 8:30 AM. Preheated dutch oven to 500\u00b0, then baked the loaf covered at 450\u00b0 for 20 minutes and uncovered for 20 more minutes. \n\n\nDid this need more time fermenting?

Secondly instead of three sets of stretch and folds I did five. The total BF time was roughly 10 hours I think? To be honest I wasn\u2019t super vigilant with it. I did temp the dough so that I could use the sourdough journey bulk fermentation chart but again I wasn\u2019t overly scientific about it.

Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. It should get nice and bubbly.\n2. To the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, add the sourdough discard, honey, salt and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes.\n3.

Alternatively, you can turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough by hand for 5-10 minutes.\n4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl.

{"title": "I killed my 5 year old starter", "selftext": "Hi guys, just wanted to tell what happened to see if someone has any advice. \n\nI had my boy for 5 years, made delicious bread with it. It was SO strong, usually tripling or cuadrupling in size with each feed. It was used to neglect, could be up to 3 months in the fridge, but with just one feed he would bounce as if nothing had happened.\n\nI fed him last time in December, then life happened and I only had time to start baking last week. Well the guy was DRY, like a stone dry. I think the lid of the container was off so some aired leaked and time did the rest. It also had a new smell, like old cheese? Not horrible but definitely not what I was used to when he was hungry. I submerged it in water for hours and scratched what I could (because it was a stone, fully dry) and used that for a new feed.\n\nIt has been 8 days since that. I have tried EVERYTHING. Old flour, new flour, adding whole wheat. I had like 4 jars with different feeding ratios. It did ferment somehow because it became runny and has some bubbles on the sides of the jar, and after 24 hours the whole thing smells funny. But there has been no rise whatsoever. I even thought \"well if I have to start over then it is better to start from somewhere\" but now I feel it is actually making it worse? Today I decided to just keep going with one jar with 1:2:2 ratio and the regular flour, and start a new one from scratch. But to be honest I feel truly lost and hopeless. When I first made it, it was rising by day 7. And fyi, I live in a tropical country so it definitely has the temperature it needs.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? apart from the regular \"just keep feeding it\". Do you guys think it had mold or something and that is why it never revived? Or any other ideas? What is the best feeding ratio for this case?

{"title": "Starter stopped doubling", "selftext": "Hello dear bread addicts!\n\nI need some guidance understanding what\u2019s going on with Lou.\n\nSo - Lou is not exactly a baby, he was born 16th Oct \u201823. Since then, he made beautiful loaves of bread.\nHowever, recently my levain stopped even doubling - it used to triple.\n\nI did change something in the way I feed it: I\u2019m no longer measuring the water/flour ratio, but rather I look to get the consistency I want. \nSince it\u2019s fed once/week and kept in the frigde, I wanted a thicker consistency for it, so it has more to eat (it was going quite runny by the end of the week). So it has a lower water intake than what it used to.\n\nI kept the same flour mixture: bread flour and whole grain (about 2/3 and 1/3).\n\nAnother thing I noticed when I was experimenting with some higher protein white flour: whenever I fed the levain with 13% white flour and whole grain (also around 13%) he LOVED it. The starter was fed with the exact same flour mixture since infancy, so nothing changed there.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if these two things are related, but they are the only things that stood out.\n\nSo, to sum up, my two questions would be:\n- is it possible that giving up the \u201cstrict\u201d measuring feedings created some bacteria unbalance, resulting in it not tripling/doubling anymore? \n- why does Lou all of the sudden prefer higher protein flour? (he now gets more flour during the regular feedings)\n\nThanks a lot!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/1k53ogs/starter_stopped_doubling/", "created_utc": 1745320396.0, "score": 2, "author": "StrawberryOwn6978", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Sourdough/comments/1k53ogs/starter_stopped_doubling/", "html_title": ""}
