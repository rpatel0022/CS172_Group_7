{"title": "/r/Charcuterie FAQ and beginners guide to cured and air dried meats", "selftext": "I have been looking through a list of all of the posts in /r/Charcuterie looking for some threads with good information to cobble together a beginners reading list for the sub. I have noticed (and you probably have noticed too!) we have a lot of the same questions pop up from people wanting to get into the hobby of producing homemade cured and air dried meats.  We also have a lot of firsts! We have had just over 6k posts in the 7 years this sub has been around, 11% of them contain the word 'first'.\n\nAnd duck prosciutto is [really](https://i.imgur.com/ZSkB3Eq.png), [really](https://i.imgur.com/pDw7kh2.png), [popular](https://i.imgur.com/4WM0LTi.png).\n\nThis isn't a big sub and self posts don't get a lot of views or generate a lot of discussion.  So the purpose of this thread is collate some of the community expertise into one place for the people who come here with questions about their first projects.\n\nIf anyone wants to expand on any of these points feel free to do so and I will update them.  If there is a popular beginner question or resource I have missed or something is wrong let me know in the comments.  Hopefully together we can build this into a fairly complete beginners resource.\n\nThis is not intended to be a detailed step by step guide or a substitute for doing your own research.\n\n# Curing/drying chamber - what is it and how do I make one?\n\nA curing/drying chamber is an area that creates the ideal temperature and humidity conditions for drying whole muscles or salami.  The exact temperature and humidity will vary by preference to but ranges from refrigerator temperatures (less than 4C/39F) to 15C/59F (Staphylococcus aureus can multiply and produce toxins at temperatures above 15.6C (60.08F) so it is important to keep your curing chamber below this temperature). Generally they are kept at at 10-15C (50-59F) and 60-80% humidity. As most of us don't live in an area that has these ambient conditions, we need to create an artificial environment that does.\n\nMost people do this by modifying a refrigerator or freezer to run warmer than usual by interrupting the cooling cycle with a temperature controller, and using humidifiers/dehumidifiers to keep the humidity at the required level.  A higher humidity is preferred at the start of drying, especially when making sausages and cased whole muscle as it helps prevent case hardening, allows the casing to adhere to the meat (if the humidity is too low the casing will dry out, creating air pockets between the casing and the meat), and encourages mold growth.\n\n## Things to consider when choosing a fridge/freezer to convert into a meat curing chamber:\n\n* It needs to be frost free (dehumidifies as it cools).  Otherwise water collecting on the sides of the fridge will drop onto the meat.\n* Refrigerators with glass doors are a nice aesthetic and a popular choice, just be aware prolonged exposure to the light will cause fat to go rancid, so you might need to cover the door or keep it in a dark room.\n* It needs to be big enough to hold a humidifier and/or dehumidifier as well as the product you will be making. An overcrowded chamber can cause airflow problems so it's a good idea to go bigger if possible.\n* Wine fridges are popular as they are made to sit in the temperature range for curing (and they look pretty stylish with blue lights and a glass window).  However depending on your ambient conditions the cooling cycle runs very frequently to keep the temperature constant.  A small beverage fridge and temperature controller might be a better choice.\n\nThe exact setup is going to vary depending on the ambient conditions in the room you will be keeping the chamber and your climate - for example extremes of heat may cause the cooling cycle in the refrigerator to run too often, causing case hardening.  You might need to run the AC or consider packing everything down over the summer months.  Ideally you don't want the cooling cycle to run much more than 5 minutes in every half an hour.  Some airflow is required for the moisture to evaporate from the surface of the meat, so if the refrigerator powers on too infrequently, you might need to use a small fan on a timer to make sure there is some air movement inside the chamber.\n\nSo as you can see the temperature and humidity readings are only one part of the conditions inside the chamber, something like a [sensorpush](http://www.sensorpush.com/) can give you a better picture of what is going on.\n\nAlthough the more professional looking chambers have holes drilled into the side of the appliance for the humidity/temp probes and appliance power cords, it isn't essential.  You can pass the probes through the door seal.\n\nLinks to previous examples of curing chambers and discussions can be found at the bottom of this post.\n\n# General steps for making cured and dried whole muscles\n\n1. Weigh the piece of meat you intend to cure.\n2. Cure the meat - you can do this in two ways:  \n**Salt box (excess salt cure):** The meat is dredged in a cure mixture of salt and spices (enough to coat the surface), and left for a period of time about 1 day per pound (or 2 days per kg),  flipping the meat and redistributing the cure at the halfway point. This timing will change depending on the shape of the meat, and whether there is skin on or off. This is a very traditional method, and is as much an art as a science - too much time on the salt will cause the dried product to be over salty, not enough time and the meat will not cure properly, and is at risk of spoilage.  \n**Equilibrium Cure**: This is where the desired about of salt content of the finished produced is measured out (approx 2.75 %) as well as nitrates (.25% Prague powder #2 - note that as the vast majority of PP#2 is salt, so this will result in a product with very close to 3% salt content), and rubbed onto the meat, then sealed (generally using a vacuum sealer) and left for a much longer time to ensure the cure has had sufficient time to penetrate.  Nitrates should always be used when equilibrium curing.  It will take longer for the meat to cure than with an excess salt cure, a general rule is one week per inch of meat, with a minimum of two weeks. Flip the bag occasionally to ensure the whole surface of the meat comes in contact with the cure. Some more discussion on equilibrium curing here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/8i2vzi/how\\_long\\_to\\_cure\\_for\\_equilibrium/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/8i2vzi/how_long_to_cure_for_equilibrium/)\n3. Dredge with a second flavouring spice layer (optional)\n4. Apply a casing (optional)\n5. Truss the meat and hang it to dry.\n6. Rest under vacuum seal in the refrigerator to equalise moisture (optional)\n\n## How do I know when it is ready?\n\nPeriodically weigh the meat, and pull it from the chamber when it has reached the desired dryness (water weight loss).  This will differ depending on the product.  Fat contains less water than muscle and therefore doesn't need to lose as much weight, so a fatty duck breast or pancetta will have a different texture at 35% weight loss than lean muscle like a loin or bresaola.  A figure of 35% is given as a rule of thumb for many recipes, however most people find this too 'raw' in texture and will take it further - to 40-45%.  With practice you will get a feel what you prefer.\n\n# What is case hardening?\n\nCase hardening is caused by low humidity, or too much airflow within the drying environment.  The water in the meat needs to travel outwards from the middle to the surface, where it evaporates. If the humidity is too low or there is too much airflow the surface will dry out too quickly (harden) and the internal moisture is no longer able to exit.  In extreme cases this can cause rotting within the meat.  You can tell by texture when squeezing the muscle - there should be a bit of 'give' - if it feels completely hard (but hasn't lost much weight), you may have a problem with case hardening.\n\nSometimes uneven drying can be remedied by vac sealing the meat and refrigerating it for some time, but in extreme cases or if the meat has spoiled inside, it will not be salvageable.  It is best to prevent it getting out of control by monitoring your curing chamber conditions and regularly checking on the state of the products inside.\n\nPrevious /r/Charcuterie post showing case hardening: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/5jxypy/first\\_cured\\_meat\\_lost\\_more\\_then\\_35\\_but\\_definitely/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/5jxypy/first_cured_meat_lost_more_then_35_but_definitely/)\n\n# What are nitrites, and do I really need to use them?\n\nMost experienced people here would say yes, especially as a beginner and when making salami, smoked products, or rolled pancetta.  Nitrites inhibit the growth of clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that creates the botulism toxin.  C. botulinum requires an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment to grow and produce the toxin, and likes moist and warm conditions - so basically the inside of a sausage or salami being hung at temperatures above refrigeration.  Botulism should be taken very seriously.\n\nAs the botulism bacteria are only found on the outside of the meat and do not become a problem until they are introduced into the inside through cutting or grinding, nitrites/nitrates are not essential for whole muscle cures, however many people choose to use them anyway as they provide other benefits such as improving colour, and slowing rancidity and spoilage.\n\n**What is the difference between Prague Powder #1 and Prague Powder #2**\n\nPrague Powder #1 contains 6.5% sodium nitrite (93.5% salt), and is used when the curing time is short, the product is to be smoked, or cooked or a cured flavour and colour is desired - for example bacon or ham.  As the nitrites get quickly used up, if a product is to be air dried for longer, then Prague Powder #2 needs to be used, PP#2 contains 6.25% sodium nitrite and 4% sodium nitrate which eventually converts to nitrite.  Think of PP#2 as a \"slow release\" curing salt. PP#2 should be used for all salami and for whole muscles that will be air dried.\n\nIt is important to use the correct curing salt for the application - sodium nitrate cannot be safely consumed until the nitrates have converted to nitrites, so PP#2 can only be used in products that will be air dried for a long time (weeks + months).  Do not use PP#2 in fresh or cooked products.\n\nAs a general rule, both Prague Powders are added at 0.25% of the starting weight of the meat. There are also European style curing salts such as \"Peklosol\" that have a much lower concentration of nitrite (0.6%), and they are used as a replacement for all of the salt in the recipe (around 3%).\n\n*Curing salts are often dyed pink to distinguish them from regular salt, and therefore can sometimes referred to as \"pink salt\".  They are not interchangeable with Himalayan \"pink salt\" which is rock salt with a natural pink colour.*\n\n# Mold.\n\nThe oft-repeated mantra about mold here is white powdery = good, white and fuzzy or green = wipe it off, black = throw it out without question.  This is overly cautious, although white powdery mold is desired, some green molds are okay (the problem is figuring out yours is the good or bad kind...), and a small amount of black mold isn't necessarily enough to justify abandoning a project.  One way around the mold issue is to use a commercial freeze dried mold culture (such as bactoferm-600).  This way you can cultivate good mold growth early on as it will prevent less desirable molds taking over.  Undesirable mold can grow out of control very quickly if the conditions are conducive (high humidity, low airflow), so it is best to keep an eye on things, and use a 50/50 solution of water and vinegar to wipe off any undesirable mold that starts to form.  Even black mold is salvageable if it is caught early enough.\n\nIf freeze dried Penicillum Nagliovese (Bactoferm-600) is not available where you live, Penicillum Candidum (the mold found on the rind of white bloomed cheese) can be substituted.  You can also try hanging some commercial salami with white mold to seed the chamber.  I find it isn't necessary to reapply the Bactoferm-600 to everything - once a good level of growth is established it will spread around quite well by itself.\n\nMeat that has been smoked before hanging will resist growing mold as smoking acidifies the surface slightly.\n\nHere are some examples showing you that the mold issue isn't as clear cut as just colour: [http://wedlinydomowe.pl/en/viewtopic.php?t=7840&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0](http://wedlinydomowe.pl/en/viewtopic.php?t=7840&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0)\n\nWe've seen some gnarly mold here over the years, some good discussions to read: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/9h103q/fil\\_insists\\_this\\_is\\_still\\_good\\_everything\\_ive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/9h103q/fil_insists_this_is_still_good_everything_ive/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/500pn2/prosciutto\\_after\\_3\\_months\\_need\\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/500pn2/prosciutto_after_3_months_need_help/)\n\n# Lastly, do your research, and follow a recipe\n\nWhen you are starting out it is important to follow a recipe, and make sure you understand the reasoning behind the process, and the purpose of the ingredients.  Do more research before you create your own recipe or modify anything.  This isn't like other kinds of fermentation where there isn't too much that can go wrong - incorrectly cured meat has the potential to make people very sick. Even more so for salami (which is why we suggest whole muscle cures for beginners).  Don't be afraid to start small, there is nothing worse than making a huge batch of a product only to have something go wrong in the process and have to throw it out.  Be patient, this is slow food after all.\n\n## Some popular projects for beginners:\n\n* [Cured Egg Yolk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/7e2582/salt_cured_egg_yolk/) \\- no curing chamber needed, just salt and dehydrate or cook in a low oven.

{"title": "The current state of /r/charcuterie", "selftext": "Hey guys and gals,\n\nConsensus used to be around here that this sub was for the propagation of information pertaining to the creation of charcuterie, ie how to transform meat into delicious products in a home setting in a safe manner. Emphasis has been on demystifying technique with safety in mind to show how just about anybody could apply a bit of food science at home to produce delicious products. Many of us have spent numerous hours here teaching others and learning a few things ourselves (we\u2019re always learning! No one knows everything!).\n\nPeriodically posts show up here that are just cold cuts thrown on a plate buried in fruit and nuts and cheese and such. \u201cLook what I bought\u201d posts as I refer to them. Personally I find that they cheapen the sub. The posters aren\u2019t putting any effort in to learn what charcuterie actually is, instead just posting a platter of junk then heading off to r/food or r/foodporn or wherever to try to get more imaginary internet points. These posters aren't actually a part of the community.\n\nThere are also posts which show up with complete disregard for proper handling and/or food safety aspects. These can be dangerous if they are left as is and not correctly moderated by passing along misinformation to beginners. \n\nWe currently only have one moderator on the sub. The mod is making the argument that if we didn\u2019t want those types of posts then they simply wouldn\u2019t be upvoted, so no moderation is required. Some of us are making the argument that the upvotes are not coming from the core community, just coming from people looking for pretty pictures with little to no knowledge of the sub and of the subject.\n\nI would like to ask those here who post often what they actually think. Do you want more posts or do you want quality posts? Do you want to see just plated products and who cares where them came from or do you want to see projects in all stages of their development from curing chamber builds to experimental batches to complete failures as well as the beautiful finished products?\n\nPersonally I would like to see the mod team expanded and stricter moderation. The current one and only mod has never actually contributed to a single conversation here and never showcased their own products. Do they even cure? If not then why do they have complete control over this community? If they're too busy to do the job they volunteered to do and cant actually moderate then why not hand the job off to someone who actually will??\n\nI have stopped posting my own products here because of the direction of the sub and would like to see it back as the collaborative community that it used to be. /u/redshoes has already volunteered to be a mod here and personally I think that she would be an excellent candidate. Or do we just leave and try to create a new sub just for us who want to talk about curing and abandon this sub to just be filled with [subway platters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/c1bb4z/does_getting_bored_early_morning_on_fathers_day/) and [bots who converse with each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/cbpyec/soapy/etik970/)?\n\nWhat does the community have to say about this?\n\nHFXGeo / TheSaltedHog / Peter\n\n\nEdit: Added links", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/cdmmjj/the_current_state_of_rcharcuterie/", "created_utc": 1563220889.0, "score": 202, "author": "HFXGeo", "num_comments": 121, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/cdmmjj/the_current_state_of_rcharcuterie/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Hi /r/Charcuterie, I am your new mod! Let's talk about platters.", "selftext": "Hi everyone, /u/ForensicUnit has kindly granted me mod privileges on this sub, so I wanted to introduce myself and explain some of the ideas I have going forward:\n\nA little bit about me - I have been actively posting here for 3 years, although I lurked for probably 3 years before I moved out of a tiny city apartment and was able to start making my own cured and dried meats.  I have an instagram charcuterie blog (which I won't link to here for obvious reasons) and some of you might recognise me from there, I see some regular posters both instagram and reddit.  I am a software developer and have css skills as well so I can also help out with any funky css or automod things that need doing.\n\nThis is the biggest charcuterie forum online, the only others that come close being the facebook groups such as The Salt Cured Pig with > 20k subscribers - and those of you that follow the group on facebook will appreciate that reddit is a much better platform for this kind of discussion! But unfortunately looking at the [reddit stats for this sub](https://subredditstats.com/r/charcuterie)  you can see that we have very low engagement levels.  Much lower than other similar subs.  So I think it is even more important that we foster the community and encourage the contributors that we do have (and hopefully attract more!)\n\nSo, let's talk about platters:\n\nThe majority of 'pre-made charcuterie platter posts' are 'hit and run' posts. They are posted by people who have never contributed to the community, don't bother to read the sidebar, and their only goal is to farm a bit of karma.  The op never returns to answer questions or continue the discussion. \n\nSo I submit the following rules for consideration regarding 'platter posts':\n\n* **No \"nibble plates\"**.  The focus must be on charcuterie.\n\n* All pictures of charcuterie platters must include a text description of the contents in the comments.\n\n* Platters where op didn't make the charcuterie are okay if the op wants to generate a charcuterie-related discussion or even just share something they thought the community would enjoy i.e:\n\n    \u2714\ufe0f \"I visited a farm today and was served this amazing plate of house made charcuterie\" (with a comment about the farm and charcuterie program \n          and explanation of what is on the plate)\n\n    \u274c \"Look at this charcuterie platter I made at work today\" (With no comment) \n\n    \u2714\ufe0f \"I'm really excited about this charcuterie platter I made for my date night\" (With a comment describing the contents as well as the Pata Negra \n          they ordered in and included tasting notes for...)   \n\n    \u2714\ufe0f \"Help me put together a charcuterie plate for my brother's wedding\" (Generates discussion. Who are your favourite \n         commercial charcuterie producers? How do you plate and serve charcuterie?)\n\nIntention and context are important here.  I think these rules would strike a nice balance between encouraging newcomers while not rewarding 'hit and run' posters and trolls.  But how does this sound to you? Looking forward to hearing your views in the comments. \n\nI have more ideas that I want to run past you all, but this post is already getting quite wordy and the 'platter posts' are the big issue at the moment, so I will stop here.  But please share any ideas you have below and hopefully we can all work together to build this community \ud83d\udc16\ud83d\udc16", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/cef1n5/hi_rcharcuterie_i_am_your_new_mod_lets_talk_about/", "created_utc": 1563380403.0, "score": 168, "author": "redshoes", "num_comments": 76, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/cef1n5/hi_rcharcuterie_i_am_your_new_mod_lets_talk_about/", "html_title": ""}

It doesn't have to be a recipe - just a couple of sentences describing the product and the processes that went into making it is enough.

{"title": "Hello From Chef Brian Polcyn, Author of \"Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing\"", "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\nMy name is Dylan Polcyn and I am the son/promoter of Chef Brian Polcyn. He is the author, teacher, and Charcuterie/whole-animal butchery expert from Detroit, Michigan. I wanted to stop by and drop off some PSAs from our world to yours (I hope this is okay. Please let me know, Mods, if this isn't *kosher* with the side bar rules).\n\n1. On February 24th and 25th there is an event in New York City called Charcuterie Masters where both amateur and professional individuals can submit their Charcuterie items in a variety of categories to win first place. Chef Polcyn will be lead judge along with some REALLY impressive individuals from the New York area. This event is a great way to see if your products are *worth their salt* since a premier group of judges will be reviewing it. Visit their website for more info www.nyepicureanevents.com\n\n2. Chef Brian teaches whole-hog butchery and Charcuterie courses all around the country. I really appreciate the specific questions and thoughtful responses on this sub. Reddit and The Salt Cured Pig (a facebook page for Charcuterie fanatics) can only do so much, so if you're interested in some hands on learning with Charcuterie let me know. I apologize if this is sort of \"self-advertising\" but I would be suggesting this regardless if I worked for my father or not. He's been doing these classes for 5 years and famous Chefs and serious home cooks alike have left his classes with enhanced knowledge and inspiration to try new and exciting things. I just want you all to know of opportunities to gain more education and improve your craft.\n\n3. Chef Brian is working on his third book with co-author Michael Ruhlman on the subject of pates, terrines, and rillettes. It's going really well and they are close to finishing the manuscript. In a follow up post I'll show some pictures of what Chef has been working on.\n\nA part of Chef Brian and I's mission is to help keep Charcuterie as a part of the modern American menu. We see passionate people like you all as essential to that, so please feel free to reach out to me through reddit or you can email/facebook us with questions you have about what you're working on. Good luck to you all and remember,\n\nPRAISE THE LARD!!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/7u1r28/hello_from_chef_brian_polcyn_author_of/", "created_utc": 1517326050.0, "score": 145, "author": "Dpol911", "num_comments": 20, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/7u1r28/hello_from_chef_brian_polcyn_author_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

This the same time that the Smithfield, VA processing plant transformed into a export facility rather than a processing plant.  The Smithfield, VA plant was totally revamped and they simply do a 6-way cut to hogs and ship them all off to China for further processing (where they're cheaper to butcher).\n\nSo this now means that only Smithfield, Inc can produce \"Genuine Smithfield \\[dry cured\\] Hams\" and not only do they not have to conform to any Standard of Identity (such as aging times and cures), but that they don't even come from Smithfield, VA.\n\nFurthermore, any other small Smithfield Ham producers in Smithfield county are now barred from labeling their Hams \"Genuine Smithfield Hams\" as there is no legal exception and would therefore be a trademark infringement.\n\nAs usual, our Government works for the Big Corporations,  and screws everyone else.

Coated them in black and ground white pepper (which I don\u2019t think looks great now and may have contributed to over drying) I stupidly forgot to weigh them so was keen to leave at least 3 months but have actually left them about 4 and a half months in the fridge.

Hopefully together we can build this into a fairly complete beginners resource.\n\nThis is not intended to be a detailed step by step guide or a substitute for doing your own research.\n\n# Curing/drying chamber - what is it and how do I make one?\n\nA curing/drying chamber is an area that creates the ideal temperature and humidity conditions for drying whole muscles or salami.  The exact temperature and humidity will vary by preference to but ranges from refrigerator temperatures (less than 4C/39F) to 15C/59F (Staphylococcus aureus can multiply and produce toxins at temperatures above 15.6C (60.08F) so it is important to keep your curing chamber below this temperature). Generally they are kept at at 10-15C (50-59F) and 60-80% humidity. As most of us don't live in an area that has these ambient conditions, we need to create an artificial environment that does.\n\nMost people do this by modifying a refrigerator or freezer to run warmer than usual by interrupting the cooling cycle with a temperature controller, and using humidifiers/dehumidifiers to keep the humidity at the required level.  A higher humidity is preferred at the start of drying, especially when making sausages and cased whole muscle as it helps prevent case hardening, allows the casing to adhere to the meat (if the humidity is too low the casing will dry out, creating air pockets between the casing and the meat), and encourages mold growth.\n\n## Things to consider when choosing a fridge/freezer to convert into a meat curing chamber:\n\n* It needs to be frost free (dehumidifies as it cools).  Otherwise water collecting on the sides of the fridge will drop onto the meat.\n* Refrigerators with glass doors are a nice aesthetic and a popular choice, just be aware prolonged exposure to the light will cause fat to go rancid, so you might need to cover the door or keep it in a dark room.\n* It needs to be big enough to hold a humidifier and/or dehumidifier as well as the product you will be making. An overcrowded chamber can cause airflow problems so it's a good idea to go bigger if possible.\n* Wine fridges are popular as they are made to sit in the temperature range for curing (and they look pretty stylish with blue lights and a glass window).  However depending on your ambient conditions the cooling cycle runs very frequently to keep the temperature constant.  A small beverage fridge and temperature controller might be a better choice.\n\nThe exact setup is going to vary depending on the ambient conditions in the room you will be keeping the chamber and your climate - for example extremes of heat may cause the cooling cycle in the refrigerator to run too often, causing case hardening.  You might need to run the AC or consider packing everything down over the summer months.  Ideally you don't want the cooling cycle to run much more than 5 minutes in every half an hour.  Some airflow is required for the moisture to evaporate from the surface of the meat, so if the refrigerator powers on too infrequently, you might need to use a small fan on a timer to make sure there is some air movement inside the chamber.\n\nSo as you can see the temperature and humidity readings are only one part of the conditions inside the chamber, something like a [sensorpush](http://www.sensorpush.com/) can give you a better picture of what is going on.\n\nAlthough the more professional looking chambers have holes drilled into the side of the appliance for the humidity/temp probes and appliance power cords, it isn't essential.  You can pass the probes through the door seal.\n\nLinks to previous examples of curing chambers and discussions can be found at the bottom of this post.\n\n# General steps for making cured and dried whole muscles\n\n1. Weigh the piece of meat you intend to cure.\n2. Cure the meat - you can do this in two ways:  \n**Salt box (excess salt cure):** The meat is dredged in a cure mixture of salt and spices (enough to coat the surface), and left for a period of time about 1 day per pound (or 2 days per kg),  flipping the meat and redistributing the cure at the halfway point. This timing will change depending on the shape of the meat, and whether there is skin on or off. This is a very traditional method, and is as much an art as a science - too much time on the salt will cause the dried product to be over salty, not enough time and the meat will not cure properly, and is at risk of spoilage.  \n**Equilibrium Cure**: This is where the desired about of salt content of the finished produced is measured out (approx 2.75 %) as well as nitrates (.25% Prague powder #2 - note that as the vast majority of PP#2 is salt, so this will result in a product with very close to 3% salt content), and rubbed onto the meat, then sealed (generally using a vacuum sealer) and left for a much longer time to ensure the cure has had sufficient time to penetrate.  Nitrates should always be used when equilibrium curing.  It will take longer for the meat to cure than with an excess salt cure, a general rule is one week per inch of meat, with a minimum of two weeks. Flip the bag occasionally to ensure the whole surface of the meat comes in contact with the cure. Some more discussion on equilibrium curing here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/8i2vzi/how\\_long\\_to\\_cure\\_for\\_equilibrium/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/8i2vzi/how_long_to_cure_for_equilibrium/)\n3. Dredge with a second flavouring spice layer (optional)\n4. Apply a casing (optional)\n5. Truss the meat and hang it to dry.\n6. Rest under vacuum seal in the refrigerator to equalise moisture (optional)\n\n## How do I know when it is ready?\n\nPeriodically weigh the meat, and pull it from the chamber when it has reached the desired dryness (water weight loss).  This will differ depending on the product.  Fat contains less water than muscle and therefore doesn't need to lose as much weight, so a fatty duck breast or pancetta will have a different texture at 35% weight loss than lean muscle like a loin or bresaola.  A figure of 35% is given as a rule of thumb for many recipes, however most people find this too 'raw' in texture and will take it further - to 40-45%.  With practice you will get a feel what you prefer.\n\n# What is case hardening?\n\nCase hardening is caused by low humidity, or too much airflow within the drying environment.  The water in the meat needs to travel outwards from the middle to the surface, where it evaporates. If the humidity is too low or there is too much airflow the surface will dry out too quickly (harden) and the internal moisture is no longer able to exit.  In extreme cases this can cause rotting within the meat.  You can tell by texture when squeezing the muscle - there should be a bit of 'give' - if it feels completely hard (but hasn't lost much weight), you may have a problem with case hardening.\n\nSometimes uneven drying can be remedied by vac sealing the meat and refrigerating it for some time, but in extreme cases or if the meat has spoiled inside, it will not be salvageable.  It is best to prevent it getting out of control by monitoring your curing chamber conditions and regularly checking on the state of the products inside.\n\nPrevious /r/Charcuterie post showing case hardening: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/5jxypy/first\\_cured\\_meat\\_lost\\_more\\_then\\_35\\_but\\_definitely/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/5jxypy/first_cured_meat_lost_more_then_35_but_definitely/)\n\n# What are nitrites, and do I really need to use them?\n\nMost experienced people here would say yes, especially as a beginner and when making salami, smoked products, or rolled pancetta.  Nitrites inhibit the growth of clostridium botulinum, the bacteria that creates the botulism toxin.  C. botulinum requires an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment to grow and produce the toxin, and likes moist and warm conditions - so basically the inside of a sausage or salami being hung at temperatures above refrigeration.  Botulism should be taken very seriously.\n\nAs the botulism bacteria are only found on the outside of the meat and do not become a problem until they are introduced into the inside through cutting or grinding, nitrites/nitrates are not essential for whole muscle cures, however many people choose to use them anyway as they provide other benefits such as improving colour, and slowing rancidity and spoilage.\n\n**What is the difference between Prague Powder #1 and Prague Powder #2**\n\nPrague Powder #1 contains 6.5% sodium nitrite (93.5% salt), and is used when the curing time is short, the product is to be smoked, or cooked or a cured flavour and colour is desired - for example bacon or ham.  As the nitrites get quickly used up, if a product is to be air dried for longer, then Prague Powder #2 needs to be used, PP#2 contains 6.25% sodium nitrite and 4% sodium nitrate which eventually converts to nitrite.  Think of PP#2 as a \"slow release\" curing salt. PP#2 should be used for all salami and for whole muscles that will be air dried.\n\nIt is important to use the correct curing salt for the application - sodium nitrate cannot be safely consumed until the nitrates have converted to nitrites, so PP#2 can only be used in products that will be air dried for a long time (weeks + months).  Do not use PP#2 in fresh or cooked products.\n\nAs a general rule, both Prague Powders are added at 0.25% of the starting weight of the meat. There are also European style curing salts such as \"Peklosol\" that have a much lower concentration of nitrite (0.6%), and they are used as a replacement for all of the salt in the recipe (around 3%).\n\n*Curing salts are often dyed pink to distinguish them from regular salt, and therefore can sometimes referred to as \"pink salt\".  They are not interchangeable with Himalayan \"pink salt\" which is rock salt with a natural pink colour.*\n\n# Mold.\n\nThe oft-repeated mantra about mold here is white powdery = good, white and fuzzy or green = wipe it off, black = throw it out without question.  This is overly cautious, although white powdery mold is desired, some green molds are okay (the problem is figuring out yours is the good or bad kind...), and a small amount of black mold isn't necessarily enough to justify abandoning a project.  One way around the mold issue is to use a commercial freeze dried mold culture (such as bactoferm-600).  This way you can cultivate good mold growth early on as it will prevent less desirable molds taking over.  Undesirable mold can grow out of control very quickly if the conditions are conducive (high humidity, low airflow), so it is best to keep an eye on things, and use a 50/50 solution of water and vinegar to wipe off any undesirable mold that starts to form.  Even black mold is salvageable if it is caught early enough.\n\nIf freeze dried Penicillum Nagliovese (Bactoferm-600) is not available where you live, Penicillum Candidum (the mold found on the rind of white bloomed cheese) can be substituted.  You can also try hanging some commercial salami with white mold to seed the chamber.  I find it isn't necessary to reapply the Bactoferm-600 to everything - once a good level of growth is established it will spread around quite well by itself.\n\nMeat that has been smoked before hanging will resist growing mold as smoking acidifies the surface slightly.\n\nHere are some examples showing you that the mold issue isn't as clear cut as just colour: [http://wedlinydomowe.pl/en/viewtopic.php?t=7840&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0](http://wedlinydomowe.pl/en/viewtopic.php?t=7840&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0)\n\nWe've seen some gnarly mold here over the years, some good discussions to read: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/9h103q/fil\\_insists\\_this\\_is\\_still\\_good\\_everything\\_ive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/9h103q/fil_insists_this_is_still_good_everything_ive/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/500pn2/prosciutto\\_after\\_3\\_months\\_need\\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/500pn2/prosciutto_after_3_months_need_help/)\n\n# Lastly, do your research, and follow a recipe\n\nWhen you are starting out it is important to follow a recipe, and make sure you understand the reasoning behind the process, and the purpose of the ingredients.  Do more research before you create your own recipe or modify anything.  This isn't like other kinds of fermentation where there isn't too much that can go wrong - incorrectly cured meat has the potential to make people very sick. Even more so for salami (which is why we suggest whole muscle cures for beginners).  Don't be afraid to start small, there is nothing worse than making a huge batch of a product only to have something go wrong in the process and have to throw it out.  Be patient, this is slow food after all.\n\n## Some popular projects for beginners:\n\n* [Cured Egg Yolk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/7e2582/salt_cured_egg_yolk/) \\- no curing chamber needed, just salt and dehydrate or cook in a low oven.

{"title": "Another nitrite debate : what about the flavour ?", "selftext": "Hi. I'm super new to charcuterie, in fact never made a single one yet. But I love fermentation and after reading Koji Alchemy chapter on charcuterie I wanted to deep dive on the subject.  \n  \nI was surprised to see how in the book they were very precautionous about having to use nitrite in charcuterie, as something you \\*must\\* do. And as an european millenial, I was taught that nitrite was evil.\n\nSo I started to dig, and started to read countless of debates, especially here in this subreddit. And I saw many, many contradictory informations. And honestly both sides were having good points. I do know that nitrites are only a problem when heated high temp and producing nitrosamines (and only if eaten very oftenly), I do know that contradictory to a lot of beliefs, people from ancient times actually used the nitrites inside saltpetres, that a lot used to cure their meat. I know that \"nitrite-free\" products are a marketing joke, and I know nitrites help preventing botulism. But frankly, I also know that it's actually \\*\\*extremely\\*\\* unlikely anyway and that a \\*ton\\* of people are doing it without them on a daily basis since generations and generations.\n\nThis morning, I bought a dried sausage. It was gorgeous with a lovely pink-hue and the flavour was excellent. But while I was enjoying my slices, I thought that flavour was very predictable. And I remembered that time I went to southern Corsica, and when an old folk gave me a chunk of his homemade charcuterie. And how I was blown away.  \nIt was not like something I ever tasted anywhere. First of all it was grey-ish, and it had an aroma complexity and funky flavours that was out of this world. The fat was kinda rancid-ish but not in a bad way, more in a Patanegra/Iberico ham fat way. I couldn't stop myself eating more and more and every bites seemed to develop new layers after new layers of very satisfying aromatic compounds. Umami kick that was way \\*waaaaay\\* over any other charcuterie I've ever tasted.\n\nSeeing who gave it to me and the color of the product, I'm 99% sure it was made without nitrites, using only salt. And after digging a bit more online, I want to adress the nitrite problem another way : I'm afraid it actually standardizes flavor profile, and restrain funky flavours to get in.\n\nThere is a company making \"properoni\", apparently crazy good pepperoni without nitrites and they have a very very solid reputation. If they can sell a nitrite-free product at a commercial scale, I guess they are acting safely and know what they are doing. There must be a way to make nitrite-free charcuterie that are 100% safe from botulism. And I wanted you guys insights about what that way could possibly be. Especially since I have ordered a brisket that is actually sitting in my freezer and I don't know if I should order #1 or not yet.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting a standardized, easy to scale product, that have a consistent flavor profile. And I love bacon and all kind of charcuteries with nitrates.

{"title": "Pepperoni Help, Please.", "selftext": "I bought some 50mm casings and T-SPX from Umai to make pepperoni, and eventually other salamis. At the Umai website, they have salami (no specific type) instructions all over the place. The amount of T-SPX for 5 lbs of meat varies from \u215b, \u00bc, \u00bd tsp dissolved in 1, 2, 8 tbsp of water. So the amount of water that could end up in the pepperoni varies a lot. Additionally, and this is the big confusion factor, the instructions say to dissolve, in the same T-SPX water, \u00bc-\u00bd tsp of powdered dextrose. Their pepperoni recipe has no additional dextrose listed but has 6g sugar. Now, at The Sausage Maker website, in a Q&A response, they specify 2% dextrose by meat weight. This is equivalent to about 10 tbsp for 5 lbs.

Tomorrow would be 4 weeks in the Umai bag and since last Saturday had dropped only 35g. The jowls were fairly small and I trimmed most if not all the glands so some sections were fairly thin. I had read another post that said 30% loss could be difficult for guanciale and that 20%-25% was acceptable. So at almost 23.5% I decided it was time.\n\nI first removed the small triangular piece (pic 1 near white espresso maker) I had cut off to make everything fit better in the bag. I trimmed off the skin and hard egdes and cut it into smaller pieces which my wife then started frying up for a taste test. Since trimming seemed do easy I decided to do the rest instead of letting the bigger one dry more. My wife, unfortunately, cooked the guanciale as if it were the bacon I like, crunchy. It tasted like pork rinds.\n\nSo, I have a few questions for others who have made guanciale.\n1) Even if it had been cooked properly, I don't think it would have tasted much different than bacon. So what's the big hoopla? Did I not do enough spices or the wrong ones (2 Guys & a Cooler recipe)?\n2) On pic 3 you can see a piece of hard, dark, almost black, meat with very little fat I cut off. Is this edible? It was so hard I ended up tossing it but wonder if cooking would have softened it?\n3) Pic 4 shows a glistening, clear paper like covering. In one spot, I peeled of a little bit and it is tough as leather, just clear. Is this normal or possibly the result of the Umai bag?\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Umai bag worked and, having read 150g of guanciale is a good amount for Roman style pastas, have four 165g batches.

In a nation that prides itself on freedom --- where you can purchase tactical assault rifles with less paperwork than cold medicine -> I cannot, for the life of me, procure a simple bag of DRIED PIG'S BLOOD.\n\nWe're talking about a country spanning an entire continent! A melting pot of global gastronomy! Home to every conceivable vice and virtue! And yet, when a man develops a perfectly reasonable need for dehydrated porcine hemoglobin, he's treated like he's requesting weapons-grade plutonium.\n\nI've exhausted the obvious channels. The Asian markets with their suspiciously uniform blood cubes won't do! I need the real thing, the genuine article, the pure powdered essence. I've called farms that claim to provide liquid pig's blood, only to be met with confused silence or nervous laughter. \"Sir, this is a petting zoo\" was perhaps the most coherent response.\n\nIs this the American Dream? To be denied the fundamental right to blood powder? What would the founding fathers say if they knew their constitution protected the right to bear arms but not the right to bear blood (in powdered form)?\n\nSo I turn to you, my digital compatriots, in this desperate hour. Somewhere in this vast conspiracy of American commerce, there must be a source. A pig blood underground. A hemoglobin highway. A black market for the red market.\n\nHelp a fellow traveler navigate this strange and savage journey. Where, in the name of all that is holy and profane, can a man purchase food-grade dried pig's blood in these United States?\n\nWe can't stop here. This is blood country.\n\nP.S.

I've been making Droewors in the dry curing chamber I built. But I've been getting inconsistent results with it. After slowly drying for about 2 weeks, some sections of the sausage turn out to be a nice red colour with a delicious biltong like flavour, but other parts of the sausage are more of a brown colour and taste very bland, kinda like dehydrated raw mince. See the picture above for a comparison of two sections in the same batch, the desired result is on the right. The last batch I left the brown sections in for an additional 2 weeks, and the brown sections mostly just remained brown and dried out more, without going red.\n\nI've got my dry curing chamber set to 21 degrees C and 55% relative humidity. The temperature stays within about +- 2 degrees of the setpoint, and the humidity within about +- 5% of the setpoint. I verified this with a calibrated temperature & RH meter to be within a percent or two. The dry-curing chamber is based on a commercial refrigerator and my own controller, which controls the refrigerator and an internal desiccant-based dehumidifier (blowing away from the product). There is not much airflow, as the condenser fans only turn on when the compressor is running.\n\nI'm roughly following the recipe from 2 guys and a cooler, except that since I'm doing a strict Carnivore diet, I've left out all the spices, and just used the salt with apple-cider vinegar (ACV might not be strictly carnivore but I'm OK with it)  [https://twoguysandacooler.com/south-african-droewors/](https://twoguysandacooler.com/south-african-droewors/) Basically it just has 2% salt and 1.5% vinegar added to the mix by weight. I make the mince myself (in this case I used grassfed beef rump and grassfed beef fat with a 30% fat ratio), and I lightly mix the salt & vinegar in with a mince mixer, then vac-seal and leave in the refrigerator to cure overnight to allow the salt to distribute. The next day I stuff it into sheep casings, and into the chamber.\n\nThe reason I'm doing it in my dry curing chamber rather than a biltong box is because I want to be able to make it year-round regardless of the weather. \n\nAny advice on what I can do to get it to consistently have that nice red colour and biltong flavour? I've been thinking maybe I might need to put a starter culture in it, cause maybe the beneficial bacteria that make the flavour don't have time to multiply everywhere before it gets too dry and thus too salty for them to survive?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1jdbsgo/inconsistent_results_with_droewors_any_advice/", "created_utc": 1742215599.0, "score": 3, "author": "carnivore_1024", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1jdbsgo/inconsistent_results_with_droewors_any_advice/", "html_title": ""}

I am using an inkbird humidity controller, cold humidifier, and recent addition a dehumidifier. My fridge regulates temp to 46 degrees F so that\u2019s where I leave it and I have humidity set to 75%. \n\nWe made this batch of sausage using my families cured recipe. I checked the recipe based on all the information I could find and it has 3% regular salt by weight and .25% Prague powder #2. I cased it in 38mm casings (next time I\u2019ll go larger).

{"title": "Advice on wild boar prosciutto", "selftext": "I'm embarking on a project I have been planning for several years. I go wild hog hunting in Texas about once a year, and I've made some charcuterie with the meat, but I've really wanted to do a whole prosciutto. Two years ago, I made the effort to scrape the hair off the leg of a good sized sow I shot. By the way, scraping a hog may be easy when you have the ability to scald the whole thing in a big tub, but doing it with a pot of boiling water, towels to try to hold the hot water against the skin long enough to loosen the hair, outdoors when the weather is in the low 20s F and windy... Anyway, quite a bit of effort went into this. So I got the ham scraped, butchered it cleanly, cleaned it up once I got it back home, and vacuum sealed it to deep freeze. Side note, I know there are always concerns raised regarding trichinella, but I have researched the strains that are present in Texas hogs, and they are killed/deactivated by a long enough deep freeze. \n\nSo here we are two years later, and I finally decided to thaw and cure this leg to hang for prosciutto. I did an equilibrium cure with 3% salt and 0.25% cure #2. It has now been in the cure for about 35 days. I know I can leave it longer if needed, but I'm also chomping at the bit to get this thing hung up in my chamber. The leg is about 3 inches thick, and I've been flipping and massaging it every few days. Anyone have any experience regarding whether the salt and cure should have fully penetrated and done it's thing after 35 days? Think I ought to give it a few more weeks to be safe?\n\nAlso, this is my first bone in, full leg project. Any other advice from anyone? Thanks!

Not \"salami\"\n\n*Disclaimer Nothing in the post is intended to skirt modern practices or food safety measures, traditionally made cured meats can pose health risks even if they've been \"made forever like that\". This sub has great resources to reference good manufacturing procedures.*\n\nMy family makes \"Kobasica/Kolbas\" in Midwest US like they learned in the villages pre refrigeration, no electronic humidity/temp control, no starter cultures, maybe using cures, sometimes sugar, no ph or weight testing, just made with salt, cure spices, smoked and hung in outdoor sheds or attics during early winter for weeks. It didn't always turn out good, some years better than others, case hardening and sometimes oxidized off taste.\n\nI'm looking for clarification on how the steps/methods in traditionally made dry sausage cumulate all together to make a (somewhat) safe product and how? Modern USDA procedures have specific safety hurdles that the traditional methods don't seem to meet.\n\nTheres 2 variations of the traditional dry sausage I\u2019ve seen.\n\n1. My family currently uses salt, cure and sometimes sugar (no starter culture), either lets it sit overnight in the fridge before stuffing or stuff and then hang in the shed overnight, cold smoke for a few hours and back to hang in the shed outside for a few weeks.\n2. The really old way (without refrigeration) they would use salt, stuff and cold smoke it continouosly for weeks to dry it.\n\n\\-\u00a0Does any meaningful fermentation even occur? The temperature outside is cold that time of year which affects it. Sugar is added to help the natural bacteria there but there\u2019s a risk of feeding the bad bacteria as well right? Did they just live with the bad bacteria hoping it didn\u2019t hurt them?\n\n\\- Was higher concentrations of salt/cure used? I\u2019m not sure how much time is needed for cure to be effective\n\n\\-\u00a0 Did spices like garlic and paprika help prevent against spoilage as a sort of safety measure? Adding wine dropped the PH too\n\n\\-\u00a0 Other than the size/style of the sausage, is there a reason why the sausage would be smoked for a few hours/days or weeks historically? I get cold smoking help dry, keep the product above freezing temp and acted as a barrier to bacteria/mold, but was this used as the main safety hurdle to dry the product?\n\nI'm not sure if (non fermented) cold smoked dry sausage even allowed to be produced commercially in the US, I dont see a USDA classification this product falls under? The USDA RTE-SS Process Familiarization mentions non acidified dried sausages as no starter culture/fermentation but cooked internally to 146F and dried to <0.85 Aw.

{"title": "First ferment, and a question", "selftext": "Hello fellow meat nerds. \n\nAfter years of being too chicken to try, this weekend, I finally started my first fermented sausage: Hank Shaw\u2019s venison boerenmetworst recipe. \n\nI\u2019ve had a couple rounds of summer sausage and link sausages over the last several months, with excellent results. So, since I had the basic sausage-making skills down, I figured it was time to jump into my first minced cure.  \n\nI really wanted to do droewors, because I\u2019m a biltong fiend.  But making a dried sausage without a started culture for my first bid was a bit too intimidating. Boerenmetworst has several of the same seasonings, so figured that would be a reasonable alternative.  \n\nThe recipe call for wide hog casings, but I went with fibrous collagen for the simplicity of it, and because I wanted a wider sausage.  \n\nI have it fermenting at 75*F +\\- 5* on the PID settings, and at 85%rh +\\- 3% on the setting.  \n\nI bought one of the cheap-o Yinmik ph probes off Amazon, and got it calibrated and ready to use.  Question is, how do I test the ph of the sausages? Seems like stabbing them with the probe would just invite bad bacteria/molds. Pry the hog ring off the bottom of one, remove some meat, and re-ring?  \n\nThe after thought was I should have saved the leftover chub from the stuffer for testing\u2014but that thought came after it\u2019s been sitting in my trashcan outside for the last 18 hours, while the sausages have been in the chamber.

{"title": "Would appreciate a bit advice / opinions on curing", "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nFound his reddit a few weeks ago, checked some posts, and thought it could be a good place to share this.\n\nI started curing / drying a few years ago, but didn't do much pieces. I ate most of them, but I'm no expert, neither have good equipment.\n\nMy technique always was \"cover in salt\", and more or less guess when to take the piece out, depending on how big it was. The result was OK many times, but some times oversalted.\n\nRecently I read about the 3% salt technique, to avoid oversalting. So now that I felt like curing again after some years not doing it, I decied to try it. I've been feeding my self some info both from internet posts and blogs, and from ChatGPT, so my knowledge may be a bit \"broken\".\n\nSomething I learned recently is that salt requires time to spread around the meat, meaning the cover in salt method somehow forces it to happen faster (therefore requires less time), but the 3% salt method requires time, because salt is there, but needs time to spread, if I got the idea right.\n\nMy current \"equipment\" for this method is a ZIP bag I had around in the kitchen, and a small wine fridge.\n\nJust as a sidenote to my real question, I post a couple pictures of the half cow tongue I took out of the fridge today, after resting for 5 days. I flipped it twice a day, massaging it a bit, and making sure all parts received some brine. Now I left it hanging in the wine fridge, after covering it with a bit of powdered paprika and pepper.\n\nNow to my main concern. Today I put a new piece in the bag. I'm not sure if this is the proper translation to english, but I think it's a rolled pork shoulder (in spanish the name is \"roti de aguja\").\n\nThe piece is 1.1Kg, so I added 33gr of salt. As shown in the pictures, I put it in the ZIP bag, and it's currently resting in the fridge.\n\nThis is the first piece of this size that I try to cure with the 3% salt method. I'll make sure to massage and spread any brine created the first hours so all the piece gets some, because it's hard to spread so \"little\" salt in such a big piece, or I don't know how to do it.\n\nThe thing is... how long should I let this big boy absorb the salts and let them cure it? Is 7 days ridiculous, or would it be an acceptable minimum? Or is 14 days the minimum needed?\n\nThanks for your time in reading this, and for any input.\n\nI'll post some updates.\n\nRegards and happy curing!\n\n[Rolled pork showlder before curing](https://preview.redd.it/d815sv1olmde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdb87f7efbc07a5a949bbf48888882dcdc94ebfc)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1i3rhz4/would_appreciate_a_bit_advice_opinions_on_curing/", "created_utc": 1737149992.0, "score": 3, "author": "Irreo", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1i3rhz4/would_appreciate_a_bit_advice_opinions_on_curing/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Adding California Reaper to homemade sausages", "selftext": "I recently tried making homemade sausages with Carolina Reaper powder and concentrate to give them a spicy kick, but I feel like the process could use some improvement.\n\nDad and I used a mix of pork cuts: 1 kg of pork shank and 3 kg of lean, skinless pork belly, both finely ground, along with 4 kg of ham and 4 kg of pork loin, which were coarsely ground. We first mixed it all thoroughly, added curing salt and let the mixture sit in a cold environment for some time. Then, we added the rendered fat, which I had infused with 10 g of Carolina Reaper powder and 4 drops of Reaper concentrate.\n\nFor the fat, I rendered it from 0.8 kg of pork back fat and dissolved the Reaper powder and concentrate into it while it was still warm. After chilling it to solidify it, I massaged it into the meat mixture by hand, little by little, to incorporate it evenly. For seasoning, we used black pepper, both granulated and fresh garlic, marjoram, mustard seeds, and a bit of cold, boiled water. The final mixture was stuffed into natural casings (26\u201328 mm).\n\nRaw meat from the bowl had a very decent heat level, but the real issue arose during cooking. When pan-fried, the sausages lost much of their heat as the fat rendered out, seemingly taking a lot of the capsaicin with it. On the other hand, boiling the sausages or cooking them in soups worked better, as the heat stayed more or less intact.\n\nAnother problem was that some of the Reaper powder settled at the bottom of the bowl during the fat-chilling process, so the distribution of heat wasn\u2019t as even as I\u2019d hoped. I thought using the rendered fat as a carrier would work well since capsaicin dissolves in fat, but now I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a better way to incorporate the spice.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for retaining the heat during cooking or ensuring more even spice distribution? Would blending the powder directly into the meat work better, or is there another method I should consider?

Chamber is just a beverage cooler with a temp and RH controller and a humidifier in the bottom. I will eventually drill a hole in the side for better wire management, but I'm concerned that I'm going to hit a wire or something and brick my fridge so for now the wires are just closed in the door making a decent seal. My first attempt went pretty well, I made a Copa and a Bresaola. Bresaola was left a bit too long (work was crazy) and ended up a bit dryer than I'd prefer. I did not case either of them or use nitrates my first time nor this time.  Both times I did an EQ cure for about 15 days vacuum sealed in the fridge, rotating every day and massaging. Curing chamber conditions were kept at 55F and 75% RH with target of 65% original weight.\n\nThis go around the two pieces were both hung on 11/23/2024 - 19 days ago. This time before throwing in the chamber I bought some Bactoferm-600 and applied to each piece of meat since last time I had sparse mold coverage and it looked a little suspect (some fluffy, some powdery and some small green spots that I removed with vinegar as I noticed them). As you can see in the pics the Bactoferm definitely did its job. The issue is that the meat smells strongly of ammonia. I read online that ammonia is a byproduct of the mold and not harmful, however it can impact the flavor of the meat. To mitigate this, two days ago I lowered the temperature to 50F (kept RH at 75% per recommendations online to avoid case hardening). When I checked on it today as soon as I opened the door I got a strong whiff of ammonia. My curing chamber does not have a fan or any airflow. The fan you see in the pics is one I just added in an attempt to air it out for a bit to see if I can get the ammonia smell to dissipate. The plan is to leave the door cracked with the fan running for about 2 hours and then close it back up and see if the ammonia I smelled today was residual from the chamber, or if I am still generating ammonia. If the smell does not go away, what is the move? Brush off as much mold as possible and see how it turns out? Let it be and ammonia will go away naturally? Air out a few times a week to prevent accumulation of ammonia?\n\nSecondary concern - in one of the photos you can see a dark red almost purple ooze from the Bresaola. It looks like congealing blood. It doesn't smell rotten, but WTF? is this a concern? Normal? I didn't see anything like this at all the first go around and do not want to fuck around with something that can get myself or my loved ones sick. Anybody know what this could be caused by and what to do?\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated.

{"title": "Salt/nitrate safe percentage to be calculated after drying guanciale", "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI recently decided to make guanciale for the first time and went to my local butcher to get some curing salt (coloroso, 0.6 % nitrate).

Following that, I sealed the pork cheek with the coloroso and some herbs in a vacuum bag and left it in the fridge for 8 days. After curing, I rinsed it off, coated it with pepper, and hung it to dry.\n\nNow here\u2019s where my concern comes in: After doing some research online about food safety (I\u2019m based in Europe), I noticed that many recipes recommend 2.5%\u20133% curing salt.

I faced some molds, but everything worked relatively ok, but when I tried using beef to do BRESAOLA (with fenugreek, paprika, black pepper and some other) it doesn't worked as expected, and although I ate it, I needed to discard almost everything as it started to show some weird mold and also was smelling bed.\n\nSo I decided to buy the device to measure some variables, and it's the first time I'm measuring the humidity and temperature levels;\n\nI have positioned the device in the top and in the bottom of the wine and the temperature is always varying... Sometimes it's in 12.5 \\~ 13, and today it was 15 in the top and 17 when I put the device on the bottom;\n\nTo try to deal with the humidity problem, I have added a pot with water, but it's not reaching the ideal of 80%. As I did note that in the top the temperature was lower I thought in a way to hold the meal in the top part as you can see in one of the images.\n\nWhat I would like to know:\n\nCan I go ahead with these values, or should I try increasing the humidity and decreasing the temperature?\n\nThere's a more effective way to increase the humidity inside the chamber?\n\nThe idea of holding the pieces sidewise, as you can see in one of the pictures?\n\nPS: I have added pictures of my first piece that was curated in the same chamber around a 7 \\~ 8 months ago\n\n[2 pieces with Total 1176g ](https://preview.redd.it/yua6f5hi542e1.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d206e5f323cfef0ae6e032a5011946f1693dc695)\n\n[The ideal I had](https://preview.redd.it/e176w5hi542e1.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78fc8f8ca33437c99e00f5cfae30f1abc646b182)\n\n[bottom temperature](https://preview.redd.it/5c3m58hi542e1.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e6923f57080f8d7d367a9b1a1bcec204fe1ab15)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qpu9epja642e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613b168f74402734edb98f4c6a95ca93414e57ce\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9aw1k9b642e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c9bdd5e8af9bb010539b252a10fcfdf2f79b412\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/py0omk3c642e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b89a5f2d6eed8715fd2d28d1bd233baf6a822cd7\n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1gvyt00/my_third_attempt_at_charcuterie_some_questions/", "created_utc": 1732133128.0, "score": 3, "author": "bububu14", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1gvyt00/my_third_attempt_at_charcuterie_some_questions/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Weight loss from when/what?", "selftext": "So I understand the standard guidance to be to dry until 30-40% weight loss. And for very fatty cuts like pancetta, sometimes less weight loss is also ok, especially if cooking. However, I'm not sure I understand \"when\" the starting weight is measured. Is it measured based on the initial weight of the muscle pre-curing, muscle including the cure mixture but before curing, muscle after curing but before rinsing, muscle after curing and rinsing, or muscle after wrapping/casing and trussing?\n\nGiven a 1kg muscle, once just salt, curing salt, and sugar are added, the weight would be up to ~1050g, add spices for curing and you could get up to 1100g. After equilibrium curing, I find that there is ~1-2% of the initial weight as liquid in the bag, leaving 1080g. After rinsing/picking off the spices, closer to say 1040g. Depending on whether using collagen wraps or a beef bung/etc, the weight after trussing could be just 1050g or could be 1200g+. Here, 35% weight loss would be 650g based on the initial muscle weight of 1000g, all the way up to 780g assuming the trussed weight is 1200g. But 650g is 54% of 1200g, and 780g is 78% of 1000g, so if you don't know what the weight loss is from, you could end up with an end product that is too dry and tough or too moist and unsafe. This disparity is far less when using collagen wraps, which I have used for all my charcuterie so far, but I want to experiment with natural casings and the weight difference is quite significant there.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1g6kkkm/weight_loss_from_whenwhat/", "created_utc": 1729264784.0, "score": 2, "author": "mediocre_student1217", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1g6kkkm/weight_loss_from_whenwhat/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Question on fermented sausagea", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI tried making a batch of fermented sausages last week. The previous batch I made, I used Flavor of Italy as a starter culture. When using that, I was surprised how fast the pH dropped (below 5 within 16 hours). While this batch turned out great, I did find the end result a bit too tangy. So for my latest project, I wanted to use a slower starter culture.\n\nI used T-SPX this time and fermented the sausages at around 23 degrees Celsius. This time, it actually took too long to ferment. I checked the pH daily and after 72 hours it was still (barely) above 5.3. Since I was worried leaving the meat at those temperatures any longer than 72 hours, I decided to move them all to my curing chamber (at 13 degrees). I was a bit worried that they would be spoiled by being at high temperature for so long. They did not smell good and the smell got worse over the next two days: I decided to toss the batch since I don't want to take any risks. I'll treat this as a learning experience :)\n\nDoes anyone know what I could have done better in this case? I still would like to use T-SPX (or another slow starter culture), but I want to make sure I don't run into the same problem again.\n\nI thought of a few things to try differently next time:\n- using more sugar (dextrose) in attempt to make the pH drop faster \n- using more starter culture\n- fermenting at a lower temperature (20 degrees?) to prevent spoilage\n\nAre there other things I could try?\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1frex9l/question_on_fermented_sausagea/", "created_utc": 1727532011.0, "score": 3, "author": "phuibers", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1frex9l/question_on_fermented_sausagea/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "mini \"bresaola\" drying too fast?", "selftext": "I wanted to try my hand at making some charcuterie, but didn't want to invest so much that I was buying a whole eye of round, so I got a 556 gram bottom round steak. I did a 1 week dry cure with 2.5% salt, .25% cure#2, 2%black pepper, and some fresh thyme and rosemary. After that, 2 weeks in a 2.5% brine of red wine (300g wine, 7.5g salt) and more fresh thyme and rosemary. After the cure was rinsed off, I wrapped in collagen sheet, tied it up, and poked holes all around. Weight was now 540g. Placed in mini-fridge to dry.\n\n  \nMy minifridge has the cold plate on the inside and frost/humidity builds up inside, I have a small dish of kosher salt in there to hopefully dry it out a little. I have a small usb fan in there to help circulate the air. This setup seems to have worked for the duck breast prosciutto I tried, though I'm assuming the fat layer helped slow the drying to 22 days in that case.\n\n  \nIt has been 5 days since my \"bresaola\" went in, and I am already at my target weight of 325g (40% weight loss). The humidity range during this time was 40-78% humidity, closer to 70% whenever I was actually checking to weigh, and the temperature was 33-41 degrees. The weight dropped by \\~40 grams a day, 60g after the first day, and closer to 20g between yesterday and today.\n\n  \nObviously this dried too fast (probably case hardening too), and I cannot eat it yet because the cure#2 hasn't had enough time to break down. Should I just vacuum seal it and wait 3-4 weeks for it to be safe to eat?\n\n  \nI'm guessing the fan is moving too much air and accelerating the drying too much, so I'm not going to use it for future projects. I use this fridge to store other foods for charcuterie like cheeses, bottled cornichons/olives, jams/spreads, etc. so modifying with an inkbird doesn't feel like an option for me at this time. \n\nWhat should I do to prevent such rapid drying in the future?

{"title": "Heartbroken", "selftext": "Well, the worst happened. Some of you may renege a while back I was describing our \"rv meat chamber.\" As the temperatures here went up, we moved everything into the rv fridge, completely gutting it to make it into our charcuterie solution. Everything was perfect, and things were finishing up wonderfully. I had just finished packaging up the Salami and pepperoni into vacuum bags, and we went on vacation. I was looking forward to coming home, as the pancetta, lardo, coppa, and Guanciale were all due to finish up about the time we made it back two weeks later, and the prosciutto should have just hit weight to put the sunga on.\n\nApparently, the night after we left, there was a power surge that tripped the fridge. It went to propane back up, but the tank was fairly low, and it didn't make it. We came back to maggots, smells, and death ooze from inside the fridge/freezer, soaking into the walls/floor, and dripping through the cracks onto the ground outside. As texas is 106 rn, the freezer was at least 130 when I opened it. Ask the meat in the freezer was gone, and I mean the vacuum bags were death filled balloons floating on a lake of despair. Lost easily 200 lbs of meat between the 4 legs of prosciutto, 2 of everything else, dozen sticks of Salami and pepperoni, and all the yet untapped meat in the freezer.  We ended up having to dump the entire fridge/freezer, as maggots and goo had gotten in the cracks around the pieces and we couldn't get the smells out.\n\nSo... how do I make this not happen again? I'd love to finish diving this cellar, but even if my plan completely finishes, did I mention 106\u00b0?

{"title": "First Coppa - discoloration on one side", "selftext": "Just weighed our first batch of coppa and it was right at 35% weight loss!  There were two muscles, and the first one we cut into looked amazing (and tasted delicious).  The second one is pictured here, but one side has us a bit worried.  Looking at it from the outside, I noticed a couple of white/yellow spots.  These were sticking out from/running along the meat similar to pieces of fat, but a slightly different color.  I cut into the meat and noticed that there was some white \"gunk\" between the meat and the casing in that spot.  The meat directly under this is discolored, a bit dark.  I am thinking what happened here is that some of the bactoferm 600 I applied got under the casing where I had poked holes around the air bubbles, grew thick in the pocket, and dried out the meat under it similar to case hardening in that spot.\n\nI'm curious if anyone has seen this before, or knows of risks I may not be thinking of.

In my research I've come across varying times and rules of thumb for how long to cure a piece of meat and was wondering what other people settled on.\n\n\nThe two main channels I've been comparing are 2 Guys And A Cooler and Davide Fantinati. Here's what I found when comparing a few different cuts:\n\n\nDavide Fantinati\nCoppa ~2kg 3.5% 4 days \nhttps://youtu.be/gw8KEHbNYE0?si=jo5AWufHa9iYi5hA\n\n\nBresaola 2.5kg 3% 6 day cure\nhttps://youtu.be/V07XhOt_r8Y?si=Yn6Fo0YYoO7PwugJ\n\n\nLonza 1.8kg 3.5% 5 days\nhttps://youtu.be/wYfBDONVVvE?si=tRKwjMA8MorHMFuQ\n\n\n2 guys and a cooler\nCoppa 2kg 2.5% 2 weeks\nhttps://youtu.be/vFfqwyxC_Zo?si=8hCMtNB_JU2cQKlT\n\n\nBresaola 1kg 3% 11 days\nhttps://youtu.be/39zrfnqMMIA?si=gvKqzluAunMC0WPT\n\n\nLonza 1.1kg 3% 6 days\nhttps://youtu.be/_YkP5l8B3Ww?si=k86DB1SpQ_RzXp4J\n\n\nDavide seems to rely on experience/past projects (or I've missed where he explains his curing process) where as 2 Guys uses [this] (https://genuineideas.com/ArticlesIndex/saltbrinecalculator.html) site. Overall Davide seems to cure his meat anywhere from two, to three times as fast, and in the end has an edible product (no nitrates either so the salt is doing 100% of the work). \n\n\nOne thing I think is happening is that the website does its calculations with I think a max 6% brine. Whereas the salt we apply to the surface of the meat will saturate any liquid coming out, quickly making a 26% brine. The surface salt will eventually be depleted, at that point the highest concentration of brine will decrease from 26% and equalize to whatever salt % you applied to the meat. A higher brine % means a higher rate of osmosis so that could account for the difference between the two.\n\n\nAgain, just curious what other people do when curing their meat.

{"title": "Characterization of dry-cured ham microbiota at 12 months of seasoning ", "selftext": "Conclusion\n\nThis study characterized the microbiota of Italian PDO dry-cured hams produced using three alternative rearing strategies compared to the control one. The results highlighted that the HP9M rearing strategy differed in terms of \u03b1-diversity from C. As for \u03b2-diversity, the PERMANOVA highlighted significant differences in the microbial communities. However, they have shown a common core, consisting of three genera Tetragenococcus, Brevibacterium, and Staphylococcus, representing 72.2% of the relative abundance of all genera and contributing to the formation of the aromatic profile of dry-cured hams, concordant with previous findings. The rearing strategy with the largest number of peculiar communities was HP9M, which is associated with the production of the best dry-cured ham. Despite this, the HP9M strategy showed most of the spoilage and unknown bacteria, for which further controls are therefore needed. Future studies should investigate whether observed differences in the microbiota of different rearing strategies are able to modulate the chemical and physical characteristics of dry-cured hams during the production process and possible associations with flavour compounds typical of the sensory profile of dry-cured hams.\n\n\nI was curious about what grows on different cured meats and found an interesting study on prosciutto. Big take away is that lactic acid bacteria are present and make up the majority of the micro biome. Also interesting how a change in diet can affect what grows during the cure.", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002024000960?dgcid=rss_sd_all", "created_utc": 1718209392.0, "score": 7, "author": "thainebednar", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1deaqwc/characterization_of_drycured_ham_microbiota_at_12/", "html_title": "ScienceDirect"}

{"title": "Another nitrite debate : what about the flavour ?", "selftext": "Hi. I'm super new to charcuterie, in fact never made a single one yet. But I love fermentation and after reading Koji Alchemy chapter on charcuterie I wanted to deep dive on the subject.  \n  \nI was surprised to see how in the book they were very precautionous about having to use nitrite in charcuterie, as something you \\*must\\* do. And as an european millenial, I was taught that nitrite was evil.\n\nSo I started to dig, and started to read countless of debates, especially here in this subreddit. And I saw many, many contradictory informations. And honestly both sides were having good points. I do know that nitrites are only a problem when heated high temp and producing nitrosamines (and only if eaten very oftenly), I do know that contradictory to a lot of beliefs, people from ancient times actually used the nitrites inside saltpetres, that a lot used to cure their meat. I know that \"nitrite-free\" products are a marketing joke, and I know nitrites help preventing botulism. But frankly, I also know that it's actually \\*\\*extremely\\*\\* unlikely anyway and that a \\*ton\\* of people are doing it without them on a daily basis since generations and generations.\n\nThis morning, I bought a dried sausage. It was gorgeous with a lovely pink-hue and the flavour was excellent. But while I was enjoying my slices, I thought that flavour was very predictable. And I remembered that time I went to southern Corsica, and when an old folk gave me a chunk of his homemade charcuterie. And how I was blown away.  \nIt was not like something I ever tasted anywhere. First of all it was grey-ish, and it had an aroma complexity and funky flavours that was out of this world. The fat was kinda rancid-ish but not in a bad way, more in a Patanegra/Iberico ham fat way. I couldn't stop myself eating more and more and every bites seemed to develop new layers after new layers of very satisfying aromatic compounds. Umami kick that was way \\*waaaaay\\* over any other charcuterie I've ever tasted.\n\nSeeing who gave it to me and the color of the product, I'm 99% sure it was made without nitrites, using only salt. And after digging a bit more online, I want to adress the nitrite problem another way : I'm afraid it actually standardizes flavor profile, and restrain funky flavours to get in.\n\nThere is a company making \"properoni\", apparently crazy good pepperoni without nitrites and they have a very very solid reputation. If they can sell a nitrite-free product at a commercial scale, I guess they are acting safely and know what they are doing. There must be a way to make nitrite-free charcuterie that are 100% safe from botulism. And I wanted you guys insights about what that way could possibly be. Especially since I have ordered a brisket that is actually sitting in my freezer and I don't know if I should order #1 or not yet.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting a standardized, easy to scale product, that have a consistent flavor profile. And I love bacon and all kind of charcuteries with nitrates. But I adore wild fermentation because of unexpecting aromas kicking in and want to find a third way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1kdt0xp/another_nitrite_debate_what_about_the_flavour/", "created_utc": 1746279037.0, "score": 1, "author": "valzbeul", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1kdt0xp/another_nitrite_debate_what_about_the_flavour/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pepperoni Help, Please.", "selftext": "I bought some 50mm casings and T-SPX from Umai to make pepperoni, and eventually other salamis. At the Umai website, they have salami (no specific type) instructions all over the place. The amount of T-SPX for 5 lbs of meat varies from \u215b, \u00bc, \u00bd tsp dissolved in 1, 2, 8 tbsp of water. So the amount of water that could end up in the pepperoni varies a lot. Additionally, and this is the big confusion factor, the instructions say to dissolve, in the same T-SPX water, \u00bc-\u00bd tsp of powdered dextrose. Their pepperoni recipe has no additional dextrose listed but has 6g sugar. Now, at The Sausage Maker website, in a Q&A response, they specify 2% dextrose by meat weight. This is equivalent to about 10 tbsp for 5 lbs. A big difference between \u00bd tsp and 10 tbsp. \nHowever, I notice that if the Umai pepperoni spice blend is used it has dextrose as the first ingredient which sort of indicates more than the \u00bc-\u00bd tsp specified is preferred. \n\nSo, please, if anyone could help here:\n1) For 5 lbs of meat, how much water should I dissolve the T-SPX in so as to not make the meat too wet, if that's a concern?\n2) I'll use \u00bc-\u00bd tsp amount of dextrose in the water as that seems to be a kickstarter for the culture.

Tomorrow would be 4 weeks in the Umai bag and since last Saturday had dropped only 35g. The jowls were fairly small and I trimmed most if not all the glands so some sections were fairly thin. I had read another post that said 30% loss could be difficult for guanciale and that 20%-25% was acceptable. So at almost 23.5% I decided it was time.\n\nI first removed the small triangular piece (pic 1 near white espresso maker) I had cut off to make everything fit better in the bag. I trimmed off the skin and hard egdes and cut it into smaller pieces which my wife then started frying up for a taste test. Since trimming seemed do easy I decided to do the rest instead of letting the bigger one dry more. My wife, unfortunately, cooked the guanciale as if it were the bacon I like, crunchy. It tasted like pork rinds.\n\nSo, I have a few questions for others who have made guanciale.\n1) Even if it had been cooked properly, I don't think it would have tasted much different than bacon. So what's the big hoopla? Did I not do enough spices or the wrong ones (2 Guys & a Cooler recipe)?\n2) On pic 3 you can see a piece of hard, dark, almost black, meat with very little fat I cut off.

In a nation that prides itself on freedom --- where you can purchase tactical assault rifles with less paperwork than cold medicine -> I cannot, for the life of me, procure a simple bag of DRIED PIG'S BLOOD.\n\nWe're talking about a country spanning an entire continent! A melting pot of global gastronomy! Home to every conceivable vice and virtue! And yet, when a man develops a perfectly reasonable need for dehydrated porcine hemoglobin, he's treated like he's requesting weapons-grade plutonium.\n\nI've exhausted the obvious channels. The Asian markets with their suspiciously uniform blood cubes won't do! I need the real thing, the genuine article, the pure powdered essence. I've called farms that claim to provide liquid pig's blood, only to be met with confused silence or nervous laughter. \"Sir, this is a petting zoo\" was perhaps the most coherent response.\n\nIs this the American Dream? To be denied the fundamental right to blood powder? What would the founding fathers say if they knew their constitution protected the right to bear arms but not the right to bear blood (in powdered form)?\n\nSo I turn to you, my digital compatriots, in this desperate hour. Somewhere in this vast conspiracy of American commerce, there must be a source. A pig blood underground. A hemoglobin highway. A black market for the red market.\n\nHelp a fellow traveler navigate this strange and savage journey. Where, in the name of all that is holy and profane, can a man purchase food-grade dried pig's blood in these United States?\n\nWe can't stop here. This is blood country.\n\nP.S.

I've been making Droewors in the dry curing chamber I built. But I've been getting inconsistent results with it. After slowly drying for about 2 weeks, some sections of the sausage turn out to be a nice red colour with a delicious biltong like flavour, but other parts of the sausage are more of a brown colour and taste very bland, kinda like dehydrated raw mince. See the picture above for a comparison of two sections in the same batch, the desired result is on the right. The last batch I left the brown sections in for an additional 2 weeks, and the brown sections mostly just remained brown and dried out more, without going red.\n\nI've got my dry curing chamber set to 21 degrees C and 55% relative humidity. The temperature stays within about +- 2 degrees of the setpoint, and the humidity within about +- 5% of the setpoint. I verified this with a calibrated temperature & RH meter to be within a percent or two. The dry-curing chamber is based on a commercial refrigerator and my own controller, which controls the refrigerator and an internal desiccant-based dehumidifier (blowing away from the product). There is not much airflow, as the condenser fans only turn on when the compressor is running.\n\nI'm roughly following the recipe from 2 guys and a cooler, except that since I'm doing a strict Carnivore diet, I've left out all the spices, and just used the salt with apple-cider vinegar (ACV might not be strictly carnivore but I'm OK with it)  [https://twoguysandacooler.com/south-african-droewors/](https://twoguysandacooler.com/south-african-droewors/) Basically it just has 2% salt and 1.5% vinegar added to the mix by weight. I make the mince myself (in this case I used grassfed beef rump and grassfed beef fat with a 30% fat ratio), and I lightly mix the salt & vinegar in with a mince mixer, then vac-seal and leave in the refrigerator to cure overnight to allow the salt to distribute. The next day I stuff it into sheep casings, and into the chamber.\n\nThe reason I'm doing it in my dry curing chamber rather than a biltong box is because I want to be able to make it year-round regardless of the weather. \n\nAny advice on what I can do to get it to consistently have that nice red colour and biltong flavour? I've been thinking maybe I might need to put a starter culture in it, cause maybe the beneficial bacteria that make the flavour don't have time to multiply everywhere before it gets too dry and thus too salty for them to survive?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1jdbsgo/inconsistent_results_with_droewors_any_advice/", "created_utc": 1742215599.0, "score": 3, "author": "carnivore_1024", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1jdbsgo/inconsistent_results_with_droewors_any_advice/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I also see it may be best to add it in once the brine is cooled anyways.\n\nThe brine tastes just about right currently, but I assume the sodium nitrite will up the salt flavor levels too.\n\nSo far, here's the recipe I've gone with but looking for what I should be adding in terms of PP#1:\n\n\\-23.17lbs of brisket (\\~10,510g)\n\n\\-5 gallons of water (\\~20,000g)\n\n\\-4.5 cups of brown sugar (855g)\n\n\\-5 cups of mortons kosher salt (1200g)\n\n\\-11 tablespoons of pickling spice\n\n\\-11 cloves of garlic\n\n**-Prague powder #1:** 26.1g according to the the package (ratio with only meat weight - regardless of wet or dry cure) OR 70.9g (ratio including meat + water weight)\n\nAny advice would be great, I need to start the corning process tomorrow at the latest but ideally in the next few hours. I am aiming for at least 5 days in the cure.

{"title": "Advice on wild boar prosciutto", "selftext": "I'm embarking on a project I have been planning for several years. I go wild hog hunting in Texas about once a year, and I've made some charcuterie with the meat, but I've really wanted to do a whole prosciutto. Two years ago, I made the effort to scrape the hair off the leg of a good sized sow I shot. By the way, scraping a hog may be easy when you have the ability to scald the whole thing in a big tub, but doing it with a pot of boiling water, towels to try to hold the hot water against the skin long enough to loosen the hair, outdoors when the weather is in the low 20s F and windy... Anyway, quite a bit of effort went into this. So I got the ham scraped, butchered it cleanly, cleaned it up once I got it back home, and vacuum sealed it to deep freeze. Side note, I know there are always concerns raised regarding trichinella, but I have researched the strains that are present in Texas hogs, and they are killed/deactivated by a long enough deep freeze. \n\nSo here we are two years later, and I finally decided to thaw and cure this leg to hang for prosciutto. I did an equilibrium cure with 3% salt and 0.25% cure #2. It has now been in the cure for about 35 days. I know I can leave it longer if needed, but I'm also chomping at the bit to get this thing hung up in my chamber. The leg is about 3 inches thick, and I've been flipping and massaging it every few days. Anyone have any experience regarding whether the salt and cure should have fully penetrated and done it's thing after 35 days? Think I ought to give it a few more weeks to be safe?\n\nAlso, this is my first bone in, full leg project. Any other advice from anyone? Thanks!

Not \"salami\"\n\n*Disclaimer Nothing in the post is intended to skirt modern practices or food safety measures, traditionally made cured meats can pose health risks even if they've been \"made forever like that\". This sub has great resources to reference good manufacturing procedures.*\n\nMy family makes \"Kobasica/Kolbas\" in Midwest US like they learned in the villages pre refrigeration, no electronic humidity/temp control, no starter cultures, maybe using cures, sometimes sugar, no ph or weight testing, just made with salt, cure spices, smoked and hung in outdoor sheds or attics during early winter for weeks. It didn't always turn out good, some years better than others, case hardening and sometimes oxidized off taste.\n\nI'm looking for clarification on how the steps/methods in traditionally made dry sausage cumulate all together to make a (somewhat) safe product and how? Modern USDA procedures have specific safety hurdles that the traditional methods don't seem to meet.\n\nTheres 2 variations of the traditional dry sausage I\u2019ve seen.\n\n1. My family currently uses salt, cure and sometimes sugar (no starter culture), either lets it sit overnight in the fridge before stuffing or stuff and then hang in the shed overnight, cold smoke for a few hours and back to hang in the shed outside for a few weeks.\n2. The really old way (without refrigeration) they would use salt, stuff and cold smoke it continouosly for weeks to dry it.\n\n\\-\u00a0Does any meaningful fermentation even occur? The temperature outside is cold that time of year which affects it. Sugar is added to help the natural bacteria there but there\u2019s a risk of feeding the bad bacteria as well right? Did they just live with the bad bacteria hoping it didn\u2019t hurt them?\n\n\\- Was higher concentrations of salt/cure used? I\u2019m not sure how much time is needed for cure to be effective\n\n\\-\u00a0 Did spices like garlic and paprika help prevent against spoilage as a sort of safety measure? Adding wine dropped the PH too\n\n\\-\u00a0 Other than the size/style of the sausage, is there a reason why the sausage would be smoked for a few hours/days or weeks historically? I get cold smoking help dry, keep the product above freezing temp and acted as a barrier to bacteria/mold, but was this used as the main safety hurdle to dry the product?\n\nI'm not sure if (non fermented) cold smoked dry sausage even allowed to be produced commercially in the US, I dont see a USDA classification this product falls under? The USDA RTE-SS Process Familiarization mentions non acidified dried sausages as no starter culture/fermentation but cooked internally to 146F and dried to <0.85 Aw.

Again I think this is fine but I\u2019d like reassurance from other more experienced users here. Also I\u2019ve read that penicilium should smell like ammonia. If I get close, it smells mildly like piss, is that what the ammonia smell is supposed to be?\n\nMy chamber is around 10C and has been between 75% and 79% humidity over the past few days. When I first started, the humidity was well above 80% and I did notice a bit of green fuzzy mold on one piece. I wiped it off with vinegar and have since re-inoculated with mold 600 and have dropped the humidity to below 80% and I\u2019ve only seen pure white mold growing otherwise. \n\nI\u2019ve been checking my chamber twice a day and if I see anything more suspicious growing, I will wipe it off, but I\u2019m just wondering if I need to take proactive measures with anything that is growing here.

It was on a zip bag, no vacuum, but I'm not sure it was 100% air-tight.\n\nThing is, when I opened it, it first came this typical weird smell, not sure if rotten, but when opening an enclosing container with meat... sulphur? I don't know. It smelled weird, nothing nauseus, but as if some bacteria took over inside.\n\nAfter a few minutes open, I took the piece out, thinking on tossing it to the bin, but I realized that neither the piece of meat, nor the zip bag, smelled at all. The smell faded away. I put my nose close to the piece, smelled, and did the same on the zip bag, but nothing. And when something is rotten or decomposing, it doesn't just go away that easy, in my experience.\n\nSo I'm at a place where I'm not sure if that smell was just becuase \"some bacteria\" (reasonable I mean) grew inside the zip bag after so long closed... but the meat is good because it was salted.... or if the meat is indeed ruined, even if it doesn't smell bad.\n\nI also noticed that the meat texture was a bit like soft. The tissue would break easily, it was really tender.\n\nIn any case, I covered it in a mix of ground pepper and paprika, and hang for drying.\n\nI would just like to know if it's relatively \"normal\" to smell something after having the meat curing for several days, or if I should just discard this piece. I just use regular sea salt (no aditives or anything), without nitrites.\n\nAs a sidenote. When the piece started curing, the zip bag filled a bit with some brine, and I turned the piece 2-3 times a day, but after some days, the brine was gone.\n\nThanks for any input.\n\nRegards!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1ietvh4/pork_roll_to_drying_opinions_on_smell/", "created_utc": 1738369664.0, "score": 1, "author": "Irreo", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1ietvh4/pork_roll_to_drying_opinions_on_smell/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "First ferment, and a question", "selftext": "Hello fellow meat nerds. \n\nAfter years of being too chicken to try, this weekend, I finally started my first fermented sausage: Hank Shaw\u2019s venison boerenmetworst recipe. \n\nI\u2019ve had a couple rounds of summer sausage and link sausages over the last several months, with excellent results. So, since I had the basic sausage-making skills down, I figured it was time to jump into my first minced cure.  \n\nI really wanted to do droewors, because I\u2019m a biltong fiend.  But making a dried sausage without a started culture for my first bid was a bit too intimidating. Boerenmetworst has several of the same seasonings, so figured that would be a reasonable alternative.  \n\nThe recipe call for wide hog casings, but I went with fibrous collagen for the simplicity of it, and because I wanted a wider sausage.  \n\nI have it fermenting at 75*F +\\- 5* on the PID settings, and at 85%rh +\\- 3% on the setting.  \n\nI bought one of the cheap-o Yinmik ph probes off Amazon, and got it calibrated and ready to use.  Question is, how do I test the ph of the sausages? Seems like stabbing them with the probe would just invite bad bacteria/molds. Pry the hog ring off the bottom of one, remove some meat, and re-ring?  \n\nThe after thought was I should have saved the leftover chub from the stuffer for testing\u2014but that thought came after it\u2019s been sitting in my trashcan outside for the last 18 hours, while the sausages have been in the chamber.

{"title": "Would appreciate a bit advice / opinions on curing", "selftext": "Hey there,\n\nFound his reddit a few weeks ago, checked some posts, and thought it could be a good place to share this.\n\nI started curing / drying a few years ago, but didn't do much pieces. I ate most of them, but I'm no expert, neither have good equipment.\n\nMy technique always was \"cover in salt\", and more or less guess when to take the piece out, depending on how big it was. The result was OK many times, but some times oversalted.\n\nRecently I read about the 3% salt technique, to avoid oversalting. So now that I felt like curing again after some years not doing it, I decied to try it. I've been feeding my self some info both from internet posts and blogs, and from ChatGPT, so my knowledge may be a bit \"broken\".\n\nSomething I learned recently is that salt requires time to spread around the meat, meaning the cover in salt method somehow forces it to happen faster (therefore requires less time), but the 3% salt method requires time, because salt is there, but needs time to spread, if I got the idea right.\n\nMy current \"equipment\" for this method is a ZIP bag I had around in the kitchen, and a small wine fridge.\n\nJust as a sidenote to my real question, I post a couple pictures of the half cow tongue I took out of the fridge today, after resting for 5 days. I flipped it twice a day, massaging it a bit, and making sure all parts received some brine. Now I left it hanging in the wine fridge, after covering it with a bit of powdered paprika and pepper.\n\nNow to my main concern. Today I put a new piece in the bag. I'm not sure if this is the proper translation to english, but I think it's a rolled pork shoulder (in spanish the name is \"roti de aguja\").\n\nThe piece is 1.1Kg, so I added 33gr of salt. As shown in the pictures, I put it in the ZIP bag, and it's currently resting in the fridge.\n\nThis is the first piece of this size that I try to cure with the 3% salt method. I'll make sure to massage and spread any brine created the first hours so all the piece gets some, because it's hard to spread so \"little\" salt in such a big piece, or I don't know how to do it.\n\nThe thing is... how long should I let this big boy absorb the salts and let them cure it? Is 7 days ridiculous, or would it be an acceptable minimum? Or is 14 days the minimum needed?\n\nThanks for your time in reading this, and for any input.\n\nI'll post some updates.\n\nRegards and happy curing!\n\n[Rolled pork showlder before curing](https://preview.redd.it/d815sv1olmde1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdb87f7efbc07a5a949bbf48888882dcdc94ebfc)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1i3rhz4/would_appreciate_a_bit_advice_opinions_on_curing/", "created_utc": 1737149992.0, "score": 2, "author": "Irreo", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1i3rhz4/would_appreciate_a_bit_advice_opinions_on_curing/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Adding California Reaper to homemade sausages", "selftext": "I recently tried making homemade sausages with Carolina Reaper powder and concentrate to give them a spicy kick, but I feel like the process could use some improvement.\n\nDad and I used a mix of pork cuts: 1 kg of pork shank and 3 kg of lean, skinless pork belly, both finely ground, along with 4 kg of ham and 4 kg of pork loin, which were coarsely ground. We first mixed it all thoroughly, added curing salt and let the mixture sit in a cold environment for some time. Then, we added the rendered fat, which I had infused with 10 g of Carolina Reaper powder and 4 drops of Reaper concentrate.\n\nFor the fat, I rendered it from 0.8 kg of pork back fat and dissolved the Reaper powder and concentrate into it while it was still warm. After chilling it to solidify it, I massaged it into the meat mixture by hand, little by little, to incorporate it evenly. For seasoning, we used black pepper, both granulated and fresh garlic, marjoram, mustard seeds, and a bit of cold, boiled water. The final mixture was stuffed into natural casings (26\u201328 mm).\n\nRaw meat from the bowl had a very decent heat level, but the real issue arose during cooking. When pan-fried, the sausages lost much of their heat as the fat rendered out, seemingly taking a lot of the capsaicin with it. On the other hand, boiling the sausages or cooking them in soups worked better, as the heat stayed more or less intact.\n\nAnother problem was that some of the Reaper powder settled at the bottom of the bowl during the fat-chilling process, so the distribution of heat wasn\u2019t as even as I\u2019d hoped. I thought using the rendered fat as a carrier would work well since capsaicin dissolves in fat, but now I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a better way to incorporate the spice.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for retaining the heat during cooking or ensuring more even spice distribution? Would blending the powder directly into the meat work better, or is there another method I should consider?

{"title": "Advice needed - Ammonia and Ooze??", "selftext": "Hello, this is my second time attempting to make some cured meats. Chamber is just a beverage cooler with a temp and RH controller and a humidifier in the bottom. I will eventually drill a hole in the side for better wire management, but I'm concerned that I'm going to hit a wire or something and brick my fridge so for now the wires are just closed in the door making a decent seal. My first attempt went pretty well, I made a Copa and a Bresaola. Bresaola was left a bit too long (work was crazy) and ended up a bit dryer than I'd prefer. I did not case either of them or use nitrates my first time nor this time.  Both times I did an EQ cure for about 15 days vacuum sealed in the fridge, rotating every day and massaging. Curing chamber conditions were kept at 55F and 75% RH with target of 65% original weight.\n\nThis go around the two pieces were both hung on 11/23/2024 - 19 days ago. This time before throwing in the chamber I bought some Bactoferm-600 and applied to each piece of meat since last time I had sparse mold coverage and it looked a little suspect (some fluffy, some powdery and some small green spots that I removed with vinegar as I noticed them). As you can see in the pics the Bactoferm definitely did its job. The issue is that the meat smells strongly of ammonia. I read online that ammonia is a byproduct of the mold and not harmful, however it can impact the flavor of the meat. To mitigate this, two days ago I lowered the temperature to 50F (kept RH at 75% per recommendations online to avoid case hardening). When I checked on it today as soon as I opened the door I got a strong whiff of ammonia. My curing chamber does not have a fan or any airflow. The fan you see in the pics is one I just added in an attempt to air it out for a bit to see if I can get the ammonia smell to dissipate. The plan is to leave the door cracked with the fan running for about 2 hours and then close it back up and see if the ammonia I smelled today was residual from the chamber, or if I am still generating ammonia. If the smell does not go away, what is the move? Brush off as much mold as possible and see how it turns out? Let it be and ammonia will go away naturally? Air out a few times a week to prevent accumulation of ammonia?\n\nSecondary concern - in one of the photos you can see a dark red almost purple ooze from the Bresaola. It looks like congealing blood. It doesn't smell rotten, but WTF? is this a concern? Normal? I didn't see anything like this at all the first go around and do not want to fuck around with something that can get myself or my loved ones sick. Anybody know what this could be caused by and what to do?\n\nAny and all help is much appreciated.

{"title": "Salt/nitrate safe percentage to be calculated after drying guanciale", "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI recently decided to make guanciale for the first time and went to my local butcher to get some curing salt (coloroso, 0.6 % nitrate). For a pork cheek weighing 1 kilogram, the butcher gave me 20 grams of coloroso (2%). Following that, I sealed the pork cheek with the coloroso and some herbs in a vacuum bag and left it in the fridge for 8 days. After curing, I rinsed it off, coated it with pepper, and hung it to dry.\n\nNow here\u2019s where my concern comes in: After doing some research online about food safety (I\u2019m based in Europe), I noticed that many recipes recommend 2.5%\u20133% curing salt.

{"title": "Weight loss from when/what?", "selftext": "So I understand the standard guidance to be to dry until 30-40% weight loss. And for very fatty cuts like pancetta, sometimes less weight loss is also ok, especially if cooking. However, I'm not sure I understand \"when\" the starting weight is measured. Is it measured based on the initial weight of the muscle pre-curing, muscle including the cure mixture but before curing, muscle after curing but before rinsing, muscle after curing and rinsing, or muscle after wrapping/casing and trussing?\n\nGiven a 1kg muscle, once just salt, curing salt, and sugar are added, the weight would be up to ~1050g, add spices for curing and you could get up to 1100g. After equilibrium curing, I find that there is ~1-2% of the initial weight as liquid in the bag, leaving 1080g. After rinsing/picking off the spices, closer to say 1040g. Depending on whether using collagen wraps or a beef bung/etc, the weight after trussing could be just 1050g or could be 1200g+. Here, 35% weight loss would be 650g based on the initial muscle weight of 1000g, all the way up to 780g assuming the trussed weight is 1200g. But 650g is 54% of 1200g, and 780g is 78% of 1000g, so if you don't know what the weight loss is from, you could end up with an end product that is too dry and tough or too moist and unsafe. This disparity is far less when using collagen wraps, which I have used for all my charcuterie so far, but I want to experiment with natural casings and the weight difference is quite significant there.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1g6kkkm/weight_loss_from_whenwhat/", "created_utc": 1729264784.0, "score": 2, "author": "mediocre_student1217", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1g6kkkm/weight_loss_from_whenwhat/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Question on fermented sausagea", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI tried making a batch of fermented sausages last week. The previous batch I made, I used Flavor of Italy as a starter culture. When using that, I was surprised how fast the pH dropped (below 5 within 16 hours). While this batch turned out great, I did find the end result a bit too tangy. So for my latest project, I wanted to use a slower starter culture.\n\nI used T-SPX this time and fermented the sausages at around 23 degrees Celsius. This time, it actually took too long to ferment. I checked the pH daily and after 72 hours it was still (barely) above 5.3. Since I was worried leaving the meat at those temperatures any longer than 72 hours, I decided to move them all to my curing chamber (at 13 degrees). I was a bit worried that they would be spoiled by being at high temperature for so long. They did not smell good and the smell got worse over the next two days: I decided to toss the batch since I don't want to take any risks. I'll treat this as a learning experience :)\n\nDoes anyone know what I could have done better in this case? I still would like to use T-SPX (or another slow starter culture), but I want to make sure I don't run into the same problem again.\n\nI thought of a few things to try differently next time:\n- using more sugar (dextrose) in attempt to make the pH drop faster \n- using more starter culture\n- fermenting at a lower temperature (20 degrees?) to prevent spoilage\n\nAre there other things I could try?\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1frex9l/question_on_fermented_sausagea/", "created_utc": 1727532011.0, "score": 3, "author": "phuibers", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1frex9l/question_on_fermented_sausagea/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Whole pork belly has a \"squishy\" spot.  Does it just need more time?", "selftext": "This is my first time curing a whole belly and it's to hung for pancetta.  Previously, I've just done sections of belly in a gallon baggie for bacon and the whole piece had firmed up uniformly.

(It's sat for the correct amount of time to cure, but the texture is throwing me off).\n3. If I try some of your suggestions and it's squishy, can I just cut off the part that's not acceptable and hang the rest?\n\n  \nThanks in advance for your help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/1fmh8ww/whole_pork_belly_has_a_squishy_spot_does_it_just/", "created_utc": 1726965823.0, "score": 3, "author": "FoxForceG", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1fmh8ww/whole_pork_belly_has_a_squishy_spot_does_it_just/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "mini \"bresaola\" drying too fast?", "selftext": "I wanted to try my hand at making some charcuterie, but didn't want to invest so much that I was buying a whole eye of round, so I got a 556 gram bottom round steak. I did a 1 week dry cure with 2.5% salt, .25% cure#2, 2%black pepper, and some fresh thyme and rosemary. After that, 2 weeks in a 2.5% brine of red wine (300g wine, 7.5g salt) and more fresh thyme and rosemary. After the cure was rinsed off, I wrapped in collagen sheet, tied it up, and poked holes all around. Weight was now 540g. Placed in mini-fridge to dry.\n\n  \nMy minifridge has the cold plate on the inside and frost/humidity builds up inside, I have a small dish of kosher salt in there to hopefully dry it out a little. I have a small usb fan in there to help circulate the air. This setup seems to have worked for the duck breast prosciutto I tried, though I'm assuming the fat layer helped slow the drying to 22 days in that case.\n\n  \nIt has been 5 days since my \"bresaola\" went in, and I am already at my target weight of 325g (40% weight loss). The humidity range during this time was 40-78% humidity, closer to 70% whenever I was actually checking to weigh, and the temperature was 33-41 degrees. The weight dropped by \\~40 grams a day, 60g after the first day, and closer to 20g between yesterday and today.\n\n  \nObviously this dried too fast (probably case hardening too), and I cannot eat it yet because the cure#2 hasn't had enough time to break down. Should I just vacuum seal it and wait 3-4 weeks for it to be safe to eat?\n\n  \nI'm guessing the fan is moving too much air and accelerating the drying too much, so I'm not going to use it for future projects. I use this fridge to store other foods for charcuterie like cheeses, bottled cornichons/olives, jams/spreads, etc. so modifying with an inkbird doesn't feel like an option for me at this time. \n\nWhat should I do to prevent such rapid drying in the future?

{"title": "Heartbroken", "selftext": "Well, the worst happened. Some of you may renege a while back I was describing our \"rv meat chamber.\" As the temperatures here went up, we moved everything into the rv fridge, completely gutting it to make it into our charcuterie solution. Everything was perfect, and things were finishing up wonderfully. I had just finished packaging up the Salami and pepperoni into vacuum bags, and we went on vacation. I was looking forward to coming home, as the pancetta, lardo, coppa, and Guanciale were all due to finish up about the time we made it back two weeks later, and the prosciutto should have just hit weight to put the sunga on.\n\nApparently, the night after we left, there was a power surge that tripped the fridge. It went to propane back up, but the tank was fairly low, and it didn't make it. We came back to maggots, smells, and death ooze from inside the fridge/freezer, soaking into the walls/floor, and dripping through the cracks onto the ground outside. As texas is 106 rn, the freezer was at least 130 when I opened it. Ask the meat in the freezer was gone, and I mean the vacuum bags were death filled balloons floating on a lake of despair. Lost easily 200 lbs of meat between the 4 legs of prosciutto, 2 of everything else, dozen sticks of Salami and pepperoni, and all the yet untapped meat in the freezer.  We ended up having to dump the entire fridge/freezer, as maggots and goo had gotten in the cracks around the pieces and we couldn't get the smells out.\n\nSo... how do I make this not happen again? I'd love to finish diving this cellar, but even if my plan completely finishes, did I mention 106\u00b0? I don't WANT to spend months nursing all this amazing looking for along just to lose it all when I turn my back. Should I just wait to try again until I don't live in the fiery pits of he'll?

The surface salt will eventually be depleted, at that point the highest concentration of brine will decrease from 26% and equalize to whatever salt % you applied to the meat. A higher brine % means a higher rate of osmosis so that could account for the difference between the two.\n\n\nAgain, just curious what other people do when curing their meat.

{"title": "How much cheesecloth cloth is too much?", "selftext": "I've only made biltong so far, which was fairly straightforward. So I moved on to lonzino and am following [this](https://youtu.be/dIcBRyChRSo?si=_55uxfs1QrFbQBF2) video. In it he uses dishcloths to wrap his tenderloin and the results looked very good. I've diverted slightly from the video in using cheesecloth instead of dishcloth, a 24hr room temp hang (that I've seen done in other videos),  and right now my meats are sitting in the veggie drawer not the top of the fridge.\n\nMy concern is that the lonzinos won't dry properly with both the cheesecloth and veggie drawer. After the 24hr room temp hang all the lonzinos lost ~15% of their weight. After I moved them to the drawer I checked them again after another 8 hours but they hadn't lost any more weight, they were just the same as 8 hours before. So I just don't know if I'm suing too much cheesecloth (about 3 layers), my veggie drawer is too cold/humid (4\u00b0C 70-80% RH) or if I just didn't wait long enough to weigh them again. \n\nThe cheesecloth does feel slightly damp/moist, nothing I can remove with a paper towel, but enough that it's noticible.

{"title": "Characterization of dry-cured ham microbiota at 12 months of seasoning ", "selftext": "Conclusion\n\nThis study characterized the microbiota of Italian PDO dry-cured hams produced using three alternative rearing strategies compared to the control one. The results highlighted that the HP9M rearing strategy differed in terms of \u03b1-diversity from C. As for \u03b2-diversity, the PERMANOVA highlighted significant differences in the microbial communities. However, they have shown a common core, consisting of three genera Tetragenococcus, Brevibacterium, and Staphylococcus, representing 72.2% of the relative abundance of all genera and contributing to the formation of the aromatic profile of dry-cured hams, concordant with previous findings. The rearing strategy with the largest number of peculiar communities was HP9M, which is associated with the production of the best dry-cured ham. Despite this, the HP9M strategy showed most of the spoilage and unknown bacteria, for which further controls are therefore needed. Future studies should investigate whether observed differences in the microbiota of different rearing strategies are able to modulate the chemical and physical characteristics of dry-cured hams during the production process and possible associations with flavour compounds typical of the sensory profile of dry-cured hams.\n\n\nI was curious about what grows on different cured meats and found an interesting study on prosciutto. Big take away is that lactic acid bacteria are present and make up the majority of the micro biome. Also interesting how a change in diet can affect what grows during the cure.", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002024000960?dgcid=rss_sd_all", "created_utc": 1718209392.0, "score": 8, "author": "thainebednar", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/Charcuterie/comments/1deaqwc/characterization_of_drycured_ham_microbiota_at_12/", "html_title": "ScienceDirect"}
