{"title": "Crockpot chicken recipes that have changed my life! (Also includes a beef recipe)", "selftext": "Without crockpot chicken I genuinely do not know how I would get through the week feeding my family. I struggle with depression and finding time or motivation to cook, but it\u2019s still my responsibility to get dinner on the table every day. \n\nYou can put any kind of chicken into the crock pot. Breasts, thighs, quarters, drumsticks, really anything. I also put frozen chicken straight into my crock pot and I have never had any issues. Thawed I cook for 6 hours on low, frozen I do 6 hours on high. Then it sits on the warm setting until dinner time. \n\nHere are my amazing EASY combinations that I shuffle through over the week:\n\n-Italian Salad Dressing + Chicken \n\n-Barbecue Sauce + Chicken\n\n-Brown Sugar + Soy Sauce + Chicken \n\n-Salsa + Chicken \n\n-Cream of anything soup + Onion soup mix packet + chicken\n\nI serve most of them over rice (thrown together in a rice cooker), except barbecue chicken which always goes over potatoes- \u201cbaked\u201d in the microwave (also easy) or instant. On the side I will do a veggie steam packet which is also just microwaved. Altogether, everything considered, on these nights I spend about 10 minutes on cooking dinner. \n\nIf I am feeling good I will chop root vegetables to sit in the bottom of the crock pot, which always really adds something, but it\u2019s still great if I don\u2019t do that. \n\nAnother bonus recipe that I consider easy and use on the days I forget to set the crock pot up in time:\n\nFrozen burger patties arranged on a cookie sheet, baked at 425 for 15 mins, topped with cheese, and baked again for up to 5 more minutes. At the same time I put the burgers in, I also put in a cookie sheet of frozen French fries or tots and just leave them in until they\u2019re done (they take about 10 more mins than the burgers do). \n\nAfter minimal effort and about half an hour, all that\u2019s left is for individuals to build their own burgers and scoop some fries. \n\nI hope this helps someone else as much as it has helped me!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/hurb07/crockpot_chicken_recipes_that_have_changed_my/", "created_utc": 1595271590.0, "score": 642, "author": "Hazel_Payson", "num_comments": 106, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/hurb07/crockpot_chicken_recipes_that_have_changed_my/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Aglio e olio", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/kqXRket\n\n*As made famous by the movie [Chef](https://youtu.be/CzpVmyzbYLg).*\n\nSimple and delicious, aglio e olio remains a date-night favorite for my girlfriend and I. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1# spaghetti noodles\n- 1 bunch parsley\n- 6 cloves fresh garlic\n- Olive oil\n- Red pepper flakes\n- Parmesan cheese\n- 1 lemon\n\n**Directions:**\n\nThinly slice the garlic while your pot of water comes to a boil. The thinner you can get the garlic, the better, but also remember that thinner garlic will cook (and subsequently burn) faster. \n\nAt medium-low heat, coat the bottom of a large pan (everything is going to end up in this pan, so chose wisely) with oil. I always eyeball this, but I would estimate it to be about 1/2 - 3/4 of a cup of oil. If you can swing it, make sure this is high quality, fresh olive oil as it will make it a noticeable difference. Now is also a good time to toss the noodles into the pot. \n\nToss the garlic into the oil and gently, constantly stir it until it starts to turn golden. Cook the garlic for too little and its flavor won\u2019t infuse into the oil, but cook it too long and you\u2019ve got bitter, burnt garlic. It\u2019s a balancing game and once garlic starts to go, it goes fast, so be super attentive for this step. \n\nOnce the garlic is almost done cooking, toss in the red pepper flakes to taste, finish cooking the garlic, and then immediately transfer over the noodles from the pot. Don\u2019t bother straining them, we want some of the pasta water to help make the sauce. \n\nSqueeze in the lemon and toss in the parsley to taste. Remember, though, parsley is an important part of the dish, so don\u2019t be afraid of a heavy hand. I use 3/4 - 1 whole bunch, usually. Last night\u2019s attempt didn\u2019t have enough parsley, and you can see it in the picture (forgot to buy enough, whoops).\n\nTaste and season as necessary.

Bake them until they're turning golden brown, about 10 minutes. By using roasted peanuts, you'll end up with a deeper, richer flavor, but it's up to you! We like it both ways.\n* Once the peanuts are roasted, add them and your preferred amount of salt to a  high-speed blender or food processor. Pulse or turn on low for 1 minute to grind the nuts together into a gritty-looking mixture. Stop and  scrape down the sides and bottom with a spatula or spoon.\n* Then,  turn the blender or food processor back on to continue mixing for  another 1-2 minutes. It will look like a dry peanut clump at this point.  Don't you worry, we're not done yet!\n* Stop  and scrape down the sides and bottom once more, then blend again until  the mixture starts to appear smooth and glossy, about 2-3 minutes.  You're going to be shocked at the transformation at this point.\n* Last  but not least, add in any other optional flavors you want and blend to  combine. Transfer your homemade peanut butter to a jar or a container  for storage!\n\n### Notes\n\n* If you prefer a lighter peanut flavor, opt for raw instead of roasted peanuts.\n* We personally use pink Himalayan salt for our peanut butter, but any  type will do. If you have salted peanuts, omit the extra salt  altogether.\n* Optional ingredients are not reflected in the price or calories of our recipes.\n* Nutritional information is a rough estimate.\n* Recipe cost calculations are based on ingredients local to us and may vary from recipe-to-recipe.\n* All prices are in USD.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/kl80b6/2ingredient_5minute_peanut_butter_stop_buying_it/", "created_utc": 1609091846.0, "score": 503, "author": "BrokeBankVegan", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/kl80b6/2ingredient_5minute_peanut_butter_stop_buying_it/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Since the pandemic, work has been super slow. And, like most chefs, I find it hard to not do something with my time. So, I started documenting a lot of my experiments in the kitchen, a lot of recreations of famous chain restaurants, and some of my own concoctions too! I have a full year planned out of how I want to make videos of each of these for my YT channel - which is also something I started doing with full force due to the pandemic!\n\nThere is the video of the [Popeye's Fried chicken recipe](https://youtu.be/elynVq6YINk), and on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/honestcooks) you will also find other recreations like [Shake Shack Shroom Burger](https://youtu.be/B8PVw-TEs0c),  [Panda Express Firecracker Shrimp](https://youtu.be/1gxlXqUJwXg), [Ikea Meatballs](https://youtu.be/xm3Xy3Ycnpc) and others. I do an extensive research on all my recipes and I also try to keep them simple for home-cooking, and for that reason, I vouch for the taste and authenticity. If you enjoy the written recipe below, it would be mighty awesome of you if you considered watching the video too, please. :) If not, no big deal - I am happy to bring you the recipe either way. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHere we go -\n\n**Ingredients for Popeye's Fried Chicken Sandwich for 2 portions.** You can easily multiply this recipe if you're making more.\n\n1. Brioche Buns: 2 \n\n2. Chicken Breast: 1 breast, weighing between 10 and 12 oz. If you have smaller ones, use two. If you're using thighs, use one for each, total 2. \n\n3. Pickles: 6 slices each, total 12. \n\n4. Oil, to fry the chicken \n\n**To marinade the chicken:**\n\n1. Buttermilk: 1.5 cups, full cream or full fat buttermilk \n\n2. Sriracha or any other hot sauce: 2 tsp \n\n3. Garlic Powder: 1 tsp \n\n4. Paprika: 1 tsp \\*adjust this as per your heat level. \n\n5. Salt and pepper: to taste \n\n**For the Spicy Mayo sauce that goes on the buns:** \n\n1. Mayo: 2 heaped tablespoons \n\n2. Sriracha or any other hot sauce: 2 tsp \n\n3. Old bay seasoning or any other cajun mix: 2 tsp \n\n4. Cayenne: 1 tsp \\*adjust this as per your heat level. \n\n**To dredge the chicken before frying**: \n\n1. AP flour: 3-4 oz \n\n2. Salt/Pepper/Paprika: to season the flour, about half tsp each OR a couple shakes. \n\n   \n \n\n**Steps:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Clean the breast and divide it into 2 equal      portions. If it is too thick, whack it a bit with a rolling pin to even      out the width so it cooks evenly later on.\n2. Mix all the marinade stuff in a bowl and      whisk to combine. Add the chicken and rest in fridge for a minimum of 45      mins OR up to 3 hours.\n3. In the meantime, get the sauce ready by      mixing all the ingredients and mixing to combine.\n4. Also, mix the dredging ingredients in a      separate bowl. \n5. when the chicken has rested enough, remove      from the fridge. Heat oil in pan. Let chicken come to room temp while the      oil heats.\n6. when the oil is hot, between 350 and 360 F,      take 2 tbsp of the chicken marinade and add to the dredging flour mixture.      Mix with a fork. \n7. Now, take the chicken from the marinade and      put in the bowl with the dredging flour. Coat with flour by pressing it      down so its well coated. Lift the chicken and shake to remove extra flour.      \n8. drop in hot oil. repeat step 7 for all      pieces. \n9. Do Not overcrowd the pan when frying. Add      only up to 4 pcs if frying in a deep and wide pan. Or else stick to      batches of 2.\n10. Dont touch the chicken for a good 2-3 mins      till it is lightly crispy on one side. Then, FLIP. Follow this step again      for the other side. Once you have some color on both sides, now you have      to flip it often to avoid burning.\n11. cook till internal temp is 165 f. OR until      juices run 100% clear.\n12. Toast brioche buns with butter.\n13. To assemble: Smear on the sauce on both top      and bottom bread. Add pickles to the bottom part. Add on the fried chicken      and cover with the top bread part.\n14. Serve with fries and ketchup/\n15.

Salt (I use pink Himalayan) \n6. Black pepper \n7. Optional - cracked red pepper \n8. Canned tomato \u201csauce\u201d (such as Hunts). (Not jar premade sauce, just the straight canned tomato that\u2019s not cooked or anything, I use Hunts in the states)\n\nSteps:\n\nWe eye everything. So unfortunately I don\u2019t have exact measurements, you get a feel for it over time which is part of the fun imo as you can customize. \n\n1. Slice up onion (like a quarter of an onion if using the large hunt size). I make moon sliver shapes. \n\n2. In a pot, pour some olive oil. Medium heat. \n\n3. Put your onions in there and sweat them for a few min. Also add some butter (idk like half a tablespoon)\n\n4. Once onions are saut\u00e9ed, pour in the tomato sauce. Next, take your tomato sauce can and \u201crinse\u201d it with a bit of fresh water to get all the sauce stuck on the bottom and the sides. NOT a full can of water, just rinse it. Pour this tomatoey water into the pot as well. This effects consistency of the sauce later so def do it\n\n5. Turn heat to around 8 or so (out of 10)\n\n6. Put in your fresh basil leaves. If you want a little cracked red pepper, add it now. \n\n7. Allow the sauce to start bubbling. Once you see bubbling, give it a good stir and turn heat down to like 4. \n\n8. Stir every few min or so. Adjust heat as needed (if top layer of sauce is cooking super fast and tons of bubbling, turn it down, as an example) \n\n9. Now just do this for a bit to let it cook. Just remember to stir every few min. Overtime, the sauce will go from super liquid to a bit \u201cthicker.\u201d Usually like 20-30 min depending on your heat and quantity. \n\n10. Once it\u2019s the consistency you like, turn your heat to low. Now add your salt and pepper. Taste as you add until you achieve the taste you want. Hint - more salt/pepper than a lot of people realize. \n\nYay you\u2019re done. You can make any kind of Italian pasta with this. We recommend to top pasta with pecorino cheese. \n\nGoes great on three cheese Buitoni tortellini (if you do this, don\u2019t add pecorino on top)\n\nYou can also use this with zucchini for another classic Italian recipe. \n\nUsing this as base for pink sauce? Just mix with heavy cream or half and half. More red pepper if you\u2019d like too. \n\n\nDo you need garlic, oregano, tomato paste, etc? Noooooope.

Very creamy and savory.  I had it over rice but next time I think I'll make mashed potatoes.  \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n - 2 cloves garlic \n - 8 oz. mushrooms \n - 2 Tbsp olive oil \n - 1 cup brown lentils \n - 1/2 tsp dried thyme \n - 3/4 tsp rubbed (dried) sage\n - Freshly cracked black pepper \n - 2 cups vegetable broth \n - 1 13.5 oz. can coconut milk \n - salt to taste (about 1/2 tsp) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n- Mince the garlic and slice the mushrooms. Add the olive oil and garlic to a large skillet and saut\u00e9 for about one minute. Add the sliced mushrooms and continue to saut\u00e9 until the mushrooms have released all their moisture and begin to brown.\n - Add the lentils, sage, thyme, freshly cracked pepper, and vegetable broth to the skillet with the mushrooms. Stir to combine. Place a lid on the skillet, let the broth come up to a boil, then turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the lentils simmer for 20 minutes (with lid), stirring occasionally.\n - After simmering for 20 minutes, the lentils should be tender and most of the broth absorbed. Add the coconut milk, stir to combine, turn the heat back up to medium, and let the lentils simmer for about five more minutes (without lid), or until the mixture in the skillet has thickened to a gravy.\n - Once the mixture has thickened, turn the heat off. Taste the mixture and add salt to your liking. I added about 1/2 tsp. The salt will help the herbal flavors pop and reduce the sweetness of the coconut milk.\n - Serve hot with crusty bread for dipping or over mashed potatoes, rice, or pasta.\n\nFull info here: https://www.budgetbytes.com/lentils-with-creamy-mushroom-gravy/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/f43f54/lentils_with_creamy_mushroom_gravy_i_made_this/", "created_utc": 1581735568.0, "score": 311, "author": "Chtorrr", "num_comments": 22, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/f43f54/lentils_with_creamy_mushroom_gravy_i_made_this/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

This is hard to fuck up.", "selftext": "First - get a jar or can of spaghetti sauce that looks good to you.  Any kind is fine - don't get the super expensive ones.  You can also use plain canned crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce but you will need to season it more.  \n\nThen you can choose to use meat - ground beef, chicken breast, italian sausage, bacon, ground turkey, or ground chicken are all good choices.  If you don't want meat skip right to choosing veggies.  Sausage or chicken can be left whole or cut up, either way is fine.  \n\nIf you want to have meat in your sauce you should saute it in a pot or large skillet until cooked all the way.  If it's a leaner meat like chicken or turkey add a little oil - olive oil or any vegetable oil is fine.   Use medium heat here - we don't want to burn the hell out of anything, if things start to look too brown or are sizzling too hard turn it down.   Once your meat is cooked you'll be adding veggies.  \n\nThen you can pick 2-3 of the below veggies to add to your pot: \n\n - onions (any kind) \n - olives \n - canned cannellini beans \n - spinach (frozen is fine) \n - kale \n - mushrooms\n - bell pepper (any color)\n - zucchini\n - yellow squash  \n - eggplant \n - carrots \n - asparagus \n\nYou can also add extra seasonings at this point: \n\n - red pepper flakes\n - italian seasoning \n - garlic or garlic powder \n - oregano \n - basil \n - black pepper \n\nDo not add salt until you have tasted the sauce + mixins.  \n\nOnce your meat and veggies have cooked together for a few minutes it's time to add your jar of sauce - open it and pour it right in on top of everything.  Then fill about 1/4 of the jar with water, put the lid back on and shake it up.  Pour this into the pot, this way all the sauce remnants make it in.  Allow it to heat all the way through and cook together for a few minutes.  Taste things and add salt or other seasoning as needed. \n\nServe on your favorite pasta, follow the directions on the box and make sure water is boiling before you add the noodles.

Wash the rice and set aside. Doing this will partly hydrate the rice which is said to improve the texture and flavor.2. Slice the vegetables and set aside.

Slice the chicken, with skin, into bite sized pieces and add the soy sauce, mirin, and sake. \n4. Prepare your dashi.\n5. Now that all of your ingredients are ready, combine them either in a rice cooker or a deep sauce pan. \n6. The rice MUST go into the pan first. Make sure it is evenly spread along the bottom.\n7. Place the rest of the ingredients into the pot in any order but do not mix.\n8. Add the dashi. \n9. Set into your rice cooker. (Japanese rice cookers will have a special setting labeled \u708a\u304d\u8fbc\u307f.)\n10.

Add in water, one tablespoon at a time. I used 45ml (3 tbsp.) for the perfect consistency. Your icing should be thick enough to remain on your cake, but thin enough to spread easily.\n\n8. Remove your cake from the oven, let it cool to room temperature, spread your chocolate icing over the top and let the icing set. If you want to dress your cake up, feel free to add sprinkles, chocolate shavings or your favourite candy on top!\n\n9. Cut into equal squares with a sharp knife \u2013 and serve!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is one of the best vegan chocolate cakes I've ever baked. It's rich, chocolatey and really moist!

{"title": "Apple Caramel Mini Cheesecakes", "selftext": "I made some mini cheesecakes with apples and caramel.\n\nI think cheesecake is my favorite dessert because is so customizable, and there are so many ways to make it.\n\nIngredients and procedure for 12 mini cheesecakes:\n\n- Biscuit Base\n\n180gr biscuits, 15-16gr vanilla sugar, 125-150gr melted butter and cinnamon to taste.\n\nSimple put your biscuits in a food processor or give them a smashy smash, add some vanilla sugar, cinnamon and melted butter.\n\nYou add butter until you get the consistency you want to have, but they at least should stick together when you press on them.\n\n- Caramel\n\n200gr sugar, 50ml water, 120ml heavy cream 20% fat, 60gr butter 80% fat and salt if you want to.\n\nThe \"Secret\" for the caramel, I found out to be your fat percentage of the heavy cream and the temperature.\n\nI usually put the heavy cream on low flame for a while, and turn it off right before it starts to simmer.\n\nThe butter, I warm a cup of water in the microwave, then remove the water, and put the cup on top of the butter for almost 1 minute. It should be a little warm, but not melted.\n\nAfter you put the sugar with the water on medium-high flame, don't touch it at all. I had mine on medium flame, and when it starts to get the color you want, just remove it from the flame. Add the heavy cream and mix. After that mixed, add your butter and mix until it melts.\n\nAnd that should be it. I'm not sure you can get the caramel done 100% of the time, but I found out that this procedure gives me the best results.\n\n- Apples\n\n220/250gr apples, 25gr butter, 1tbls sugar, cinnamon to taste. Cook them in a pan at low-medium heat. After they get soft while cooking, mix them with some caramel in another bowl.\n\n-Cheesecake\n\n600gr fresh cow's cheese(soft cow cheese), 100gr semolina, 200gr sugar, 2 eggs, Vanilla and Pistachio essence.\n\nFor this, you mix the eggs, then add the sugar, essences and mix them again. Add the cheese, mix, and then add 50 grams of semolina at the time.\n\nI'm not 100% sure that you can skip it, because this will retain some of that moisture and help the cheesecake maintain its shape, and will add a nice fluffy texture.\n\nAnyway, you get your cupcake forms, add the biscuits base as thicc as you want them to be, and top it off with cheesecake mixture.\n\nCook them at 180\u00b0C for around 20 minutes with fan off, and the last 10 minutes with fan on or put your temp to 190\u00b0C if you don't have the fan option in the last 10 minutes.\n\nThese minutes are what it took to me, depending on how much cheesecake you put in, or how moist or not is your composition, it can take less, or more.\n\nThe point is to watch them, and when they start to crack on top a little they're 90-95% done. I prefer them to crack on top when\n\nI use a topping like caramel, because those cracks will keep the caramel better.\n\n\nOff so much of a wall text. I'm not that good at formatting so much text.

{"title": "Have a bunch of bananas that are getting old? Make Banana Bread!", "selftext": "**Ingredients**\n\n* Cooking spray\n* 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 large eggs\n* 1/4 cup milk\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 3 medium bananas, very ripe\n* 2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1/4 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 cup chopped nuts or chocolate chips (optional)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F and prep the pan. Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, letting the excess hang over the long sides to form a sling. Spray the inside with cooking spray.  If using nuts, toast them in the oven for 10 minutes as the oven is pre-heating.\n1. Melt the butter. Melt the butter in the microwave or over low heat on the stovetop. \u2192 Alternatively, for a more cake-like banana bread, soften the butter (but do not melt) and cream it with the sugar in a stand mixer in the next step.\n1. Combine the butter and sugar. Place the melted butter and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until combined. (Or cream the softened butter and sugar in a mixer until fluffy.)\n1. Add the eggs. Crack the eggs into the bowl. Whisk until completely combined and the mixture is smooth.\n1. Add the milk and vanilla. Whisk the milk and vanilla into the batter.\n1. Mash in the bananas. Peel the bananas and add them to the bowl. Using the end of the whisk or a dinner fork, mash them into the batter. Leave the bananas as chunky or as smooth as you prefer. If you prefer an entirely smooth banana bread, mash the bananas separately until no more lumps remain, and then whisk them into the batter.\n1. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Measure the flour, baking soda, and salt into the bowl. Switch to using a spatula and gently stir until the ingredients are just barely combined and no more dry flour is visible.\n1. Fold in the nuts or chocolate, if using. Last but not least, scatter the nuts or chocolate over the batter and gently fold them in.\n1. Pour the batter into the pan. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, using the spatula to scrape all the batter from the bowl. Smooth the top of the batter.\n1. Bake for 50 to 65 minutes. Bake until the top of the cake is caramelized dark brown with some yellow interior peeking through and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the middle comes out clean, 50 to 65 minutes. Baking time will vary slightly depending on the moisture and sugar content of your bananas \u2014 start checking around 50 minutes and then every 5 minutes after.\n1. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Set the loaf, still in the pan, on a wire cooling rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes \u2014 this helps the loaf solidify and makes it easier to remove from the pan.\n1. Remove from pan and cool another 10 minutes. Grasping the parchment paper sling, lift the loaf out of the pan and place on the cooling rack. Cool for another 10 minutes before slicing.\n\nSource: https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-banana-bread-the-simplest-easiest-recipe-139900", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/fvhc6v/have_a_bunch_of_bananas_that_are_getting_old_make/", "created_utc": 1586106983.0, "score": 236, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/fvhc6v/have_a_bunch_of_bananas_that_are_getting_old_make/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Sushi rice is optional but I believe it makes this taste 10x better. This dish is super easy to make, quick, and delicious. A perfect picnic food for summer or anytime. Spam Musubi originates from Hawaii so I decided to wear a Hawaiian shirt today :)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 6 slices of spam (1 cm each)\n* 1.5 sheet of sushi nori (roasted seaweed)\n* 1 tbs soy sauce\n* 2 tbs sugar\n* 2 tbs water\n\n**Sushi Rice Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 cups short grain white rice\n* 2.5 cups water 4 tbs rice vinegar\n* 2 tbs sugar\n* 1 tsp salt\n\n**Sushi Rice Alternative:**\n\n* 2 cups short grain white rice + drizzle of sesame oil + 1 tsp salt\n\n**Recipe for sushi rice:**\n\n1. Cook rice until fluffy\n2. Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt thoroughly until sugar is dissolved.\n3. Mix vinegar with rice, mix thoroughly while cooling rice down with a fan.\n4. Cover with damp paper towel to keep from drying.\n\n**Recipe of Spam Musubi:**\n\n1. Cut spam into 1 cm thickness. Cut seaweed sheet into fourths.\n2. Mix soy sauce, sugar, and water until sugar is dissolved\n3. Fry spam until crispy, then take out to coat with sauce mixture, then place back into pan on low heat. Cook each side 30 seconds.\n4. Using the mold or by hand, make the rice base, add spam on top, then wrap around with seaweed. Shiny side face up, rough side face down.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Put in vinegar into sushi rice when rice is hot, you want to try to rapidly cool down the rice while mixing so the mixture coats the rice without getting it soggy.\n* Sauce mixture for spam burns easily so make sure to cook on low heat and keep an eye on it!\n* If you do not have a mold, wet your hands a little with water or bit of sesame oil and make a rounded rectangular shape.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/grosyr/spam_musubi_with_sushi_rice_\u30b9\u30d1\u30e0\u3080\u3059\u3073\u3068\u9162\u98ef/", "created_utc": 1590602562.0, "score": 219, "author": "ODNR_Kitchen", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/grosyr/spam_musubi_with_sushi_rice_\u30b9\u30d1\u30e0\u3080\u3059\u3073\u3068\u9162\u98ef/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

These were the most chewy bagels I've had and it was just a pleasure to eat them.\n\n[Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/O9txHMi)\n[Recipe Video](https://youtu.be/XrybqrOn0b0)\n\nIngredients : \n\n - 500gr flour\n - 300ml water\n - 8-10gr yeast\n - 5-10gr sugar\n - salt\n - 1-2tbls honey\n - A mix of seeds\n - 1 egg for egg wash\n\nProcedure :\n\nTake 100ml of warm water and put the yeast in it with the sugar. Let it there for 5-10 minutes. It should bubble up.\nNow take the flour, the rest of 200ml of water and put it into a bowl. Add the yeast with the rest of the water. \nIf you want to avoid some stickiness use a wooden spoon at the beginning, or a dough mixer. Kneed until you get a dough that's not sticky.\nYou may need to either add a little more flour or a little more water depending on the flour you gonna use. I personally had to add 10-20 more grams of flour.\nI put the dough into a bowl that I oiled before. Let it rest for 1 to 2 hours depending on your room temp.\n\nAfter this, I divided the dough in portions of 140-150 grams. Make them into a ball shape and then poke your finger through the center of the ball of dough, then use 2 fingers to widen the hole.\nDon't push too hard or you may brake the dough and you have\nto start over. You need to make that hole bigger than you'd think. After you're done with the shape, cover the bagels for another 1 or 2 hours. \nWhen the shape grow in size, that hole will be 2-3x smaller than you made it.\n\nNow prepare your water. I added 2tbs of honey after the water was boiling and mix it. Then put your bagels in there, but don't overcrowd them, and let them boil for \n2 minutes per side. The more they boil the chewy they get after. Also these are big bagels, but 2 minutes is enough.\n\nLet them cool a bit before you egg wash them, and use your favorite mix of seeds on top of them.\nThey should go in the oven at 180 degree Celsius with fan on for around 20-25 minutes. \n\nAnd now, enjoy. You can eat them as sandwiches with creamcheese, or simple. Or don't put seeds on them when you cook them in the oven, and when they're done brush them\nwith some melted butter and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top. Eat them with jam or whatever your hearth tells you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/jvvqop/chewy_bagels/", "created_utc": 1605629620.0, "score": 216, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/jvvqop/chewy_bagels/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Join me today to learn how to make onion rings in the oven and you will be rewarded with an addictively crunchy snack that is easy, healthy and low in calories.

Preheat the Oven to 200 degrees Celcius (or 392 degrees Fahrenheit).\n2. Take a medium-sized Ziploc bag and put 0.5 Cup of the All-purpose Flour and set aside.\n3. Take a sharp knife, and slice off the top and bottom of the Onion. Remove the papery skin and the first layer of the Onion. Start making thin slices of the Onion that are about 0.5 cm (0.2\u201d) thick, and carefully separate the other rings from the inner rings. We will only be using the outer rings today (you may reserve the smaller rings for another meal).\n4. Place the Onion Rings into the Ziploc bag and seal the Ziploc bag. Give it a good shake and allow the flour to evenly coat the Onion Rings.\n5. Take a shallow bowl and put in the Panko Bread Crumbs, Onion Powder, Smoked Paprika, Garlic Power and Chilli Powder. Mix till evenly combined and set aside.\n6. Take 2 Eggs and separate the Egg Whites from the Egg Yolks.\n7. Take a bowl and put in 2 Tbsp of All-purpose Flour. Next add 1/3 Cup of Milk and the 2 Egg Whites, some Salt and Pepper, and whisk till fully incorporated into a uniform batter and set aside. Always remember to add the Flour before adding any wet ingredients as this prevents the Flour from clumping and makes the mixing process easier.\n8. Neatly arrange your ingredients into an assembly line. Starting with the bag of Onion Rings on one end, followed by the batter, the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture and the baking tray.\n9. Next, taking 1 Onion Ring at a time, shake off the excess flour and dip the Onion Ring into the batter, making sure that the Onion Ring is evenly coated.\n10. Drain off any excess batter and place the Onion Ring on one side of the bowl which contains the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture. Gently toss the mixture over the Onion Ring and allow the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture to naturally stick to the batter. Make sure you do not push down the Panko Bread Crumbs mixture over the Onion Ring as this will cause the Onion Rings to become soggy. Set the breaded Onion Ring onto the baking tray.\n11. Repeat Steps 8 and 9 with all the Onion Rings in the bag of Flour. You should be able to get 40 \u2013 50 Onion Rings from this recipe. When breading the Onion Rings in Step 9, a good tip would be to alternate the places where you place the Onion Rings when you bread them. This allows the Panko Bread Crumbs to stay dry.\n12. Once all the Onion Rings are ready on the baking tray. Give the Onion Rings a light and even coat of Non-stick Cooking Spray (this will allow the Onion Rings to brown and crisp up in the oven).\n13. Place the baking tray into the oven for 12-15 minutes. After 10 minutes, I want you to stay close to the oven and do not walk away as the Onion Rings may burn very quickly. Once you see the Onion Rings start to form a nice brown colour, take the baking tray out of the oven. You can now cook any excess Onion Rings by repeating Step 12.\n14.

A common dish I ate growing up as a kid. A big juicy bite of the burger with the savory sauce, makes this dish one of my favorites.\n\nBurger Mixture:\n\n* 2 cups ground pork\n* 1.5 cup ground beef\n* 2 tbs soy sauce\n* 2 eggs\n* 1 tbs ketchup\n* \u00bd onion + 2-3 minced garlic (caramelized)\n* 2 minced garlic\n* 1 cup panko bread crumbs\n\nSauce Ingredient:\n\n* \u00bd onion \n* 2-3 mushrooms (white, portobello, oyster, king, your preference)\n* 2 tbs unsalted butter\n* \u2153 cup red wine\n* \u2153 cup water\n* \u2153 cup ketchup\n* \u2153 cup tonkatsu sauce\n* 1-2 tbs heavy cream\n\nAdditional Ingredients:\n\nRice, fried egg, and parsley\n\nRecipe:\n\n1. Julienne 1/2 onion & chop mushrooms and set aside. Chop the other 1/2 onion finely and cook on medium low heat with cooking oil. Add minced garlic, butter, & salt midway and cook until onions are caramelized. Cool down.\n2. In a bowl, mix burger ingredients together with the onion/garlic you just cooked.\n3. Shape the mixture into a patty. Size is to your preference. Mix sauce ingredients in a bowl, omitting onions, mushroom, and cream.\n4. On a pan on medium heat, add in oil. Place patty and cook for a minute and add in water. Steam and cover with lid until bottom has formed a crust and water is mostly evaporated. Flip and repeat the steaming step.\n5. After both sides has cooked, you can cook a bit longer to add more texture on the top and bottom. Burger is done cooking when the juices have turned clear. Set aside after done.\n6. In the same pan, cook in onions and mushrooms. Then after onions have softened, add in sauce mixture and stir.\n7. Cook until alcohol have cooked off and add in heavy cream. Cook until thickened and its done.\n8. Plate with rice, burger, sauce, and a fried egg.\n\nTips:\n\n* Refrigerate burger mixture for 15 minutes to help keep its shape.\n* Quail eggs are often eaten on top, but regular egg is just as good.\n* If juices don't come out, it means you have overcooked it :(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/gae7r6/how_to_make_hamburg_steak_\ud568\ubc15\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\ud06c_\u30cf\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0/", "created_utc": 1588183425.0, "score": 192, "author": "ODNR_Kitchen", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/gae7r6/how_to_make_hamburg_steak_\ud568\ubc15\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\ud06c_\u30cf\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0/", "html_title": ""}

It's inspired by one of my favorite frozen dinners because I thought \"hey, this would be incredibly easy to make for people who don't like to cook\". We are basically just heating things up to make this. \n\nBasically you just need prepackaged frozen meatballs, Bob Evans mashed potatoes, a jar or packet of mushroom gravy , and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.\n\nNow, if you want this to he more involved, you can [make your own meatballs ](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/meatball-recipe/).

Microwave the mashed potatoes (Bob Evans mashed potatoes are very good btw, they are not instant and taste exactly like the restaurant)\n\n3. Heat the gravy. If in a jar, heat it on the stove in a small pot or pan, if packet, follow the instructions on the back for the proper ratio of water and mix. McCormick mushroom gravy calls for 1 cup of water for the packet. \n\n4. The meatballs should be done soon depending on if you did the skillet or oven method basically just wait. \n\n5. On a plate, mashed potatoes go first, then meatballs, then gravy. Cheese is last. If you want the cheese extra melted, it can go in the microwave for 10 seconds, don't worry, it won't negatively affect anything.\n\nAs I said above you can choose to do some or all of the ingredients homemade.

I know this may sound like a LOT when you read the ingredients, but I made this in a 25 by 20CM pan, and I wanted to share it with some friends and family. So cut this in half, or 25% less, but make sure, you get thick layers. It is really important to get thick layers.\n\n[A video recipe](https://youtu.be/s73CRe-cqxM)if anyone's interested\n\nRecipe :\n\nCookie layer : \n\n \\- 240gr choco chips \n\n \\- 420gr flour\n\n \\- 340gr butter\n\n \\- 3 eggs\n\n \\- 200gr brown sugar\n\n \\- 200gr white sugar\n\nMelt the butter and add it to a bowl. Add the white+brown sugar to it, give it a good mix, until combined nicely. Add some vanilla essence depending on your taste, 4 eggs and mix it again. Make sure the butter is not hot, we don't want to cook the eggs.\n\nAdd the flour, pinch of salt and mix it. Scrape the edges mix, add chocolate chips and mix it again with the hand mixer or spatula. Rest in the fridge for half an hour to 1 hour.\n\nOreos for Oreo layer.\n\nBrownie layer:\n\n \\- 225gr butter\n\n \\- 350gr melted chocolate\n\n \\- 4 eggs\n\n \\- 200gr white sugar\n\n \\- 200gr brown sugar\n\n \\- 90gr flour\n\n \\- 50gr cacao\n\nOn top of 4 eggs, add white and brown sugar give it a mix. Melt the butter, make sure is hot, and add the chocolate in it. Make sure you cut your chocolate as small as you can. After you put the chocolate in the hot butter, cover it with a plate for around 1 minute. Not more than 1 minute. Then take a spatula and mix slowly. It should melt pretty easy and combine nicely.\n\nAlso make sure to have the chocolate around room temp and not cold from the fridge. Now on that mixture of eggs + sugar, add some vanilla and pistachio or almond essence, and the melted chocolate with the butter. Give it a mix, add your flour and cocoa powder and mix it again. \n\nAlign a baking sheet on your baking pan that's already greased with the non stick spray or a little butter. You do this if you want nice edges, it helps the baking sheet to stick better to the pan. Add the cookie mixture first, use a spatula to even it out on the pan, add Oreos on top of it, and then add the brownie mixture.\n\nCook for around 50 minutes at 180 degree Celsius without fan. NO MORE THAN 50 minutes.\n\nYou can't do any test to be sure if this is cooked trough or not. At any time you gonna try to put a toothpick in it to check it is gonna come out with a lot of melted chocolate on it. If the top started to crack that means is cooked. And don't worry, the brownie layer will be fudgy and not cakey or overcooked. At least mine wasn't overcooked.\n\nThe most important thing is to let this rest overnight.

Whisk the yeast into warm water. Allow to sit for 1 minute. Whisk in salt, brown sugar, and melted butter. Slowly add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix with a wooden spoon (or dough hook attached to stand mixer) until dough is thick. Add 3/4 cup more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. If it is still sticky, add 1/4 \u2013 1/2 cup more, as needed. Poke the dough with your finger \u2013 if it bounces back, it is ready to knead.\n1. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough for 3 minutes and shape into a ball. Cover lightly with a towel and allow to rest for 10 minutes. (Meanwhile, I like to get the water + baking soda boiling as instructed in step 6.)\n1. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Silicone baking mats are highly recommended over parchment paper. If using parchment paper, lightly spray with nonstick spray or grease with butter. Set aside.\n1. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into 1/3 cup sections.\n1. Roll the dough into a 20-22 inch rope. Take the ends and draw them together so the dough forms a circle. Twist the ends, then bring them towards yourself and press them down into a pretzel shape.\n1. (This step is optional, but promises a chewier pretzel and helps provide that traditional soft pretzel taste. See recipe note.) Bring baking soda and 9 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Drop 1-2 pretzels into the boiling water for 20-30 seconds. Any more than that and your pretzels will have a metallic taste. Using a slotted spatula, lift the pretzel out of the water and allow as much of the excess water to drip off. Place pretzel onto prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each with coarse sea salt. Repeat with remaining pretzels.\n1. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.\n1. Remove from the oven and serve warm with spicy nacho cheese sauce. Pretzels may be stored in an airtight container or zipped top bag for up to 3 days (they lose a little softness).\n\nSource: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-homemade-soft-pretzels/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/gmpgzz/30_minute_homemade_soft_pretzels/", "created_utc": 1589898046.0, "score": 183, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/gmpgzz/30_minute_homemade_soft_pretzels/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to make Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e | Easy dessert recipe to make at home | Only 3 ingredients tasty dessert", "selftext": "Making Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e is very easy as it takes only 3 ingredients to make this easy dessert recipe at home beforehand. You can make this 1-2 days in advance and I am sure that if you love cooking this will be on top of your list of cold desserts. It is the yummiest, easiest and quickest dessert to make at home. This is what you need to make it:\n\nIngredients for the Custard\n\n* 6 Large Egg Yolks\n* 100 g Vanilla Infused Sugar\n* 1 tbsp Vanilla Extract\n* 2 cups Heavy cream (35% fat)\n* Sugar as required for caramelizing the top\n\nDirection:\n\n1. Pre-heat oven at 300 F or 150 C\n2. Mix the Egg yolk with the Vanilla sugar and Vanilla extract until thick & light yellow in color.\n3. Heat the heavy cream until its simmering. Remove from the heat.\n4. Add a little bit, about 1/4 cup of hot cream at a time to the egg mixture and mix. Slowly combine everything together bringing the temperature of the egg mixture up without overcooking it. Strain the liquid.\n5. Put the ramekins in a large pan and fill them until almost full. Similarly, fill the big baking dish to the brim. I used an aluminum foil baking dish to bake it. The big dish requires one batch of the full recipe and 4 small dishes can be filled with half of this recipe.\n6. Put both the pans in the pre-heated oven and fill the pan with boiling water until it is high as the half of the baking dish. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the edges are set and the center is still jiggly. The bigger dish can take 5-10 minutes longer, just keep your eye on it... don't overcook! The custard will firm up in the refrigerator overnight.\n7. Take out the pans from the oven and let sit for some time until the water has cooled down a little. Remove the ramekins from the pan using a spatula and let them cool on the rack or countertop for 10 minutes. Drain the pan and put the ramekins again in and wrap with the foil paper or cling wrap. Refrigerate for a minimum of 3 hours. I like to leave them overnight for enhanced flavor.\n8. When its time to serve, take out the custards from the fridge 30 minutes early as it takes some time to caramelize the top. Spread a layer of sugar and melt it with a blow torch. The heat will caramelize the sugar and make a crispy sweet layer that will create that \"Tap Tap\" sound.\n\nMake it for your elegant dinner party in individual serving ramekins or for a homestyle dinner with family in the big dish for everyone to share. Rest assured will be a hit with everyone who can appreciate its caramelized sweet top and yellow pillowy vanilla-infused custard beneath it.

{"title": "Lemon Bars", "selftext": "I make these every summer for parties. I'm excited it's starting to warm up and almost outdoor party season again!\n\nRecipe from this blog: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-bars-recipe/#tasty-recipes-67259\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Shortbread Crust**\n\n* 1 cup (230g; 2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted\n* 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar\n* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 2 cups + 2 Tablespoons (265g) all-purpose flour\n\n**Lemon Filling**\n\n* 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar\n* 6 Tablespoons (46g) all-purpose flour\n* 6 large eggs\n* 1 cup (240ml) lemon juice (about 4 lemons)\n* optional: confectioners\u2019 sugar for dusting\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9\u00d713 glass baking pan (do not use metal) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.\n\n2. Make the crust: Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 4.\n\n3. Make the filling: Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.\n\n4. Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.\n\n5. Once cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\n\n6. Freezing Instructions: Lemon bars can be frozen for up to 3-4 months. Cut the cooled bars (without confectioners\u2019 sugar topping) into squares, then place onto a baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour. Individually wrap each bar in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and place into a large bag or freezer container to freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator, then dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar before serving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/127qidr/lemon_bars/", "created_utc": 1680279429.0, "score": 179, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/127qidr/lemon_bars/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Maple Candy", "selftext": "(The reason why i consider this to be easy, is because you only need one food ingredient. And i myself am an amateur cook. The entire process is mainly boiling and stirring, in a nutshell that is. Having said that, if you feel like this recipe doesnt belong here, let me know.)\n\nFor all you \u2018Friends\u2019 fans. Be sure to read all of this before making.\n\n1. Get a digital thermometer. The temperature needs to be as precise as possible.\n2. Get a cooking pot with high sides (a large spaghetti or stew pot).\n3. Get 100% pure organic maple syrup. 2 cups worth. No sugars or salts or any additives. Maple syrup should be the only ingredient.\n4. Get a whisk (or whatever you\u2019d prefer to stir with. Whisk always felt easier to me.)\n5. Get molds, a cupcake tin, or something to pour the finished product into to let it cool. \n5. Warm water for cleanup. The warmer the better. Its gonna seem like a sticky mess, but maple syrup does not like to be soaked in warm water.\n\n(Here\u2019s how to)\n\nPut two cups of maple syrup in the pot. \n\nBoil over medium or high heat. Stir occasionally. \n\nAs soon as its starts frothing and bubbling, check the temperature every few minutes using the thermometer.\n\nAs soon as it gets to 110 degrees celsius, immediately take it off the heat.\n\nContinue checking the temperature until it lowers to 80 degrees celsius.\n\nAs soon as it gets to 80 degrees celsius, stir the heck out of it. Quickly and assertively. The dark color of the syrup will slowly (very slowly), start to get lighter and lighter.\n\nOnce it reaches a bright gold color, immediately pour it into a mold/cupcake tin/vessel of your choice.\n\nNow, walk away, and let it cool at room temperature. I normally come back to it after about an hour. The more cool it is, the better.\n\nWhen its cool and hardened, pop it out of the molds or cupcake tin and eat it! If you poured it out into something like a casserole dish, then id recommend using a spatula to break it into pieces. It wont look as nice, but it\u2019ll still be edible.\n\nNotes:\n\nDo not leave the kitchen at all while doing this. It\u2019s way too easy for it to boil over, and you need to be on standby for when it reaches the desired temperatures. \n\nDo not cover at all during the entire cooking process.\n\nWhen it starts to boil, it bubbles immensely and can easily boil over. This is why a pot with high sides is necessary. \n\nMaple candy is extremely sweet. Many people will not like that. You are literally eating a chunk of maple syrup. It\u2019s supposed to be a little chewy and crumbly, but not hard like rock candy.\n\nI normally store the candy in a closed container in the fridge.\n\nThe temperature of your kitchen is also a factor. I personally dont have AC in my kitchen. I know from experience that if its up to 75 degrees fahrenheit  in my kitchen, then the candy probably wont cool correctly, if at all.\n\nThis process will test your patience....but most of all, your self esteem. The first time i made this, it came out perfect. Second time i made this, it wouldnt cool at all. Third time, i nearly got it right, with half of it cooling, and the other half a runny mess. Sometimes i get it right, other times i have to start over with new maple syrup.\n\nMaybe the room isnt the right temperature, maybe the boiling process was too hot or too cold, maybe it was under-stirred. There are too many things (some of which not within your control) that could mess it up. Dont be discouraged. Its worth it to try again. At the very least, your kitchen will smell amazing!\n\nIf this is allowed, here\u2019s a link that i frequently use to help keep me on track during the process. Just scroll halfway down the page until you see the video, for a visual. As great as this video is, it doesnt tell you a lot of little details you\u2019d need. \n\nhttps://littlehouseontheprairie.com/diy-maple-sugar-candy/\n\nOnce again, i can take this recipe off this reddit, if you guys feel it isnt simple enough.

{"title": "My version of Chicken Parm with Smoky Cheese and Pecorino", "selftext": "Before beginning, I want to say it again that this is MY take on Chicken Parm. I love the original, traditional recipe, but sometimes I change things around depending on what I wanna eat in terms of flavors.\n\nSadly I don't have an exact quantity for this recipe, you will mostly have to eyeball it no matter what. Don't worry, you don't need the exact quantity for it anyway and you'll see why.\n\nI do have a [video recipe](https://youtu.be/ldEuAD0a7k8) if anyone's interested\n\nOr maybe you wanna see just [some pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/FcEOv9n)\n\nSo I like to eat this chicken parm on a bed of nice boiled and baked potatoes with some cheese.\n\nFor that we gonna need some potatoes that you cut in cubes and let it boil until you can put your fork trough them but not too easy. You don't want to make them puree, you want them to maintain their shape. Add them to a small pan, add shredded smoked cheese and heavy cream. Make sure you have a nice cheese layer at the top so it melts nice. I also added salt, pepper and paprika (you can add as much or little as you want) You cook it at 180 degree C for around 10-15 minutes, and then broil them for another 5 minutes or so to get that crisp on top. \n\nNow the chicken. I think everyone knows how to make a schnitzel right ? As spices I added: a little of dried onion, and then like a teaspoon of each paprika, onion powder, salt, black pepper, dill and smoked paprika. You rub the chicken with some of this mixture.\n\nThen you need flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. For the flour I added salt and black pepper.\n\nFor bread crumbs I added some of the mixture from the chicken but a little more smoked paprika and onion powder. Also some smoked cheese. Don't put too much in it because it will fry fast and you risk to burn it. Also it helps if you shredded really small.\n\nNow you get your chicken trough flour, egg and then breadcrumbs. I personally think this is the best way to coat a schnitzel. Fry it until it gets a nice golden - golden brown color. \n\nNow the tomato sauce, we gonna keep it simple.\n\nTake a pan, a tablespoon or 2 of olive oil, and like 30-50 grams of butter.\n\nAdd some onion (I used yellow + red onion) that's cut in cubes (I cut it in cubes because I want to feel it in the sauce when I bite into it) and cook it until translucent on low-medium heat. Now add your garlic and cook that for like 1 minute or so. Add the tomato sauce, oregano, black pepper, salt and some sugar to balance that acidity in the sauce. I usually add like 1 tablespoon of sugar for around 600ml of tomato sauce.\n\nYou need this to simmer for around 15-20 minutes depending on how thick you want it to be. I personally like the sauce to get thicker.\n\nNow take a baking pan, put the schnitzel in it, top it with the sauce, add mozzarella, a little mixture of smoky + pecorino cheese and broil it until that cheese on top gets crispy.\n\nYou can always add tomato sauce later when you it.\n\nTo serve it, I took lots of potatoes and put a schnitzel on top of it with a little more oregano. \n\nI personally love this recipe, because of the smoky flavors. As I said, this is not the traditional recipe, but I personally really like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yea, I hope you gonna give it a try if you like how it sounds!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/kzib8w/my_version_of_chicken_parm_with_smoky_cheese_and/", "created_utc": 1610927912.0, "score": 171, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/kzib8w/my_version_of_chicken_parm_with_smoky_cheese_and/", "html_title": ""}

Cook again over medium heat and stir for 1-2 minutes until it forms a dough ball.\n3. Remove from heat and chill it to lukewarm.\n4. Once cool, gradually add 3 beaten eggs into the dough while mixing with a spatula. Dough will break but eventually come together into a smooth thick paste. \n5. Transfer dough into a piping bag equipped with a large star tip.\n6. Option 1: cut out ten 3\u00d73\" squares of parchment paper. Pipe a circle of dough onto each parchment square. If you choose this option, you can fry them right away without freezing. \n7. Option 2: pipe 10 circles (space them out) onto a tray with parchment paper. Freeze them until solid (about 20 minutes) before frying. \n8. Heat at least 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pot to 370\u00b0F (188\u00b0C). \n9. If you did option 1: place one dough at a time into the oil (paper side up). Remove the paper with tongs once it detaches from the dough. \n10. If you did option 2: gently pull one chilled dough away from its paper (it should release easily). Place it right into the oil with the pretty side facing down. If you are frying them in batches, freeze the rest of the dough again until needed. \n11. Fry the one side until golden brown, 2-3 minutes.

{"title": "Babi pangang (it's easier than it sounds) (no bumbu)", "selftext": "Babi pangang is an indonesian pork dish that is often eaten with rice. I make this recipe from mind, so it doesn't have exact measurements, I hope that is okay.\n\nFirst you want to marinade your pork. I often buy 700 gr to 1 kg for 5/6 people. I like to buy pork with skin, but this also works for pork without skin. (Google translate says the part of the pork I'm referring to, the back of the pig, is called bacon, I'm not sure if that's true) \n\nIn a bowl you will put the following ingredients; \n- ketchap manis (enough to cover both sides of all the pork)\n- cut op garlic (I use garlic paste, about a teaspoon) \n- cut up ginger (for this I also use a paste, also about a teaspoon)\n- a little bit of lime grass (for this I also use a paste)\n- half a spoon of sambal (I use oelek, but you can use whatever) \n- chili peper flakes (this is optional, tare pretty spicy, you can add as much as you want)\nStir it all together and rub the pork in with it. Make sure to not get any on the skin or top of the pork. \n\nAfter marinating the pork you want to put it in a fitted aluminium tray. If you have pork without skin you want to put salt on top of the pork to make it crispy. If the meat has no skin you also want to use a lid for your tray so the meat won't burn. Make sure that every side of you meat is covered. \nPut it in an oven at 200 degrees Celsius for 2 hours.  \n\nAfter this we will start making the pangang sauce, this won't take long. I like to make the sauce immediately instead of waiting till the pork is ready. You can also start making nasi while waiting. \n\nFor the sauce you will need; \n- cut up onion \n- cut up garlic or garlic paste (a teaspoon) \n- cut up ginger or ginger paste (a teaspoon) \n- tomato paste (I use bell peper paste because I'm allergic to tomato, it has the same taste when heated up) (about 2 spoonfuls, add more if you want more sauce)\n- sweet chili sauce (idk how much I use, I just squirt some in out of the bottle) \n- sambal (a spoon, more if you like spicy) \n- a bit of lemon juice (for the sour taste)\n- a little bit of rice vinegar (normal vinegar works too)\n- a little bit brown sugar or gula djawa (for the sweet taste) \n- some chili peper powder, Laos powder and djahe powder (this is optional)\n\nYou start with baking your onion, garlic, and ginger in a sauce pan. You can use any oil you like. If you like spicy you can also put some chili pepers in it. \nAfter the union starts to get a brown colour you add the tomato or Bell peper paste. \nStir this together and add you sambal.  \nStir again and at the chili sauce (your sauce will now become thinner). Add as much as you like, I add a lot because I like the taste of it :). \nAdd the brown sugar, but don't put in too much. The chili sauce and brown sugar are both sweet, so the more you add of one of them, the less you need to add of the other.\nAdd the lemon juice and vinegar.\nStir it all together and taste you sauce.  If it's too sweet for you, you can add more vinegar or lime juice.  If it's too sour you can add more brown sugar or sweet chili sauce. \nLastly add the spices/powders. \nYou can add water if you're not a fan of thick sauces to make it thinner.  \n\nAfter the pork is ready you can cut it in small pieces and stir it through the sauce or serve it both separately. \nIf you do serve it separately, you should wipe of the salt from the top. (I always put the pork in the sauce and keep the salt on it because I don't add salt to the sauce itself ). \n\nBe careful when you get the pork out of the oven, the aluminium tray will be filled with fat and water. (I like to stir a bit of this through my nasi for extra taste and through the sauces of other dishes). \n\nI hope this was easy to follow,  if you have questions feel free to ask. Sorry if the English is bad (I'm dutch).\n\n\n** I'm not from indonesia, but I am partially indonesian.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/n7wngr/babi_pangang_its_easier_than_it_sounds_no_bumbu/", "created_utc": 1620502337.0, "score": 154, "author": "GdeGraafd", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/n7wngr/babi_pangang_its_easier_than_it_sounds_no_bumbu/", "html_title": ""}

You want to get a paste like consistency out of it.\nThen add it to a bowl and mix all the condiments in with the addition of 40gr of breadcrumbs. Mix it really well, and form your sticks. Wet your hands a little it will help you to make this easier.\nDon't make thicker than your finger. You can go as thin as you'd like, but not too thick. If for some reason you made them too thick don't worry, you'll finish them in the oven.\n\nTake a baking pan or something that fits in your freezer, and put the chicken sticks in there for 2-3 hours before cooking. You can make more and keep them for days.\n\nWhile their in the freezer prepare your tzatziki sauce. This sauce needs some time in the fridge to develop those flavors. Cut the cucumber in half and remove the seeds using a spoon. Use a shredder (Smaller holes) for the cucumber. Add it to a bowl, along with the Greek yogurt, 3-4 cloves of minced garlic, the olive oil, squeeze of lemon (Just take a lemon and cut like 25% of it and squeeze that, doesn't matter how big or small is), add the dill and black pepper. Salt if you want more salty. Mix it really good and let it sit in the fridge for those 2-3 hours while the chicken sits in the freezer.\n\nNow prepare your coating. Cornstarch (use flor if  you want) > 2-3eggs > breadcrumbs. Coat your chicken in that order\nand have a pan with hot oil ready. Cook it and if you kept the finger thickens correctly they should be ready when you get the nice golden brown color on them. If you're scared that these aren't ready, pop them in the oven fan on at 170\u00b0C for 5-10 more minutes. But just don't make them too thick. \n\nI didn't had any other spices in the breadcrumbs because I think the chicken has enough. \n\nNow I have to tell you, you can avoid all the veggies in the chicken and just make Chicken Fries basically. I personally like those veggies in there. But everyone should customize their food. You can also try another combination of spices, or play with more veggies. You can add some carrot for example.\nI had some gouda cheese on top of this, and hey you can add some cheese in them. \n\nAnyway I hope you gonna enjoy them!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/nh4yi0/chicken_sticks_with_tzatziki_sauce/", "created_utc": 1621528749.0, "score": 160, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/nh4yi0/chicken_sticks_with_tzatziki_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Puff Pastry Christmas Tree, 2 Ways Cream Cheese or Chocolate Spread Recipe", "selftext": "Finally I made these Christmas Puff Pastry Trees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think they're really great to make when you have people over as they have a nice impact when you see them for the first time.\n\nThe filling of these is pretty simple, and what I like is that you can customize them with more spices, or different cheeses and so on.\n\nThe sweet one, you can add different fruit jam, or whatever chocolate you may like...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you buy puff pastry, it will take you around 40 minutes with cooking and prep time. I personally avoid to make puff pastry at home.\n\nWhen you have it homemade is better, but the time it takes to do it...I prefer to use store bought. But you do you.\n\n[A video recipe](https://youtu.be/A7n00Sg52yg)\n\nOk so for savory one :\n\n\\- 200gr creamcheese with herbs\n\n\\- 150gr creamcheese with red chili pepper\n\n\\- 200gr white cheese\n\n\\- 200gr gouda cheese\n\n\\- 150gr spinach\n\n\\- puff pastry\n\n\\- basil, garlic powder, onion powder\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Sweet one :\n\n\\- hazelnut chocolate spread\n\n\\- coconut flakes\n\n\\- powder sugar on top after is done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth cooked at 180\u00b0C with fan on, for around 20 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProcedure :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is self explanatory. Cut a triangle from your puff pastry, and you should have 2 other sides left that you will have to form in another triangle by sealing them in the middle. Use that as the base.\n\nFor the savory one, you mix everything in a bowl except the gouda cheese. Spread that onto your base, then top everything with cheese.\n\nPut the other triangle on top, and put a spatula or something in the middle of it on top, to help you cut the tree shape.\n\nLet the middle intact and cut left and right. From the bottom to the top, you will rotate the pastry 2-3 times depending on the length.\n\nWith the top ones, you will rotate only once or let them like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the sweet one, spread the chocolate on the base, then top it off with coconut flakes. Same thing with cutting it.\n\nThis is way easier to rotate than the other one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yea, Christmas is around the corner, and for sure I'll make these again for my mother.

{"title": "\"Perfect French Fries\"- Soak potatoes, dry potatoes, fry potatoes, drain potatoes, then fry again!", "selftext": "These homemade french fries are potatoes that are cut into sticks and deep fried until golden brown, then sprinkled with seasonings. Homemade fries are WAY better than anything you\u2019d get at a restaurant, and are fun and easy to make.\n\nCLICK [HERE](https://youtu.be/A9tjuaE0-Oc) for step-by-step video recipe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor Chili Salt Seasoning:\n\n\u2022 Chilli Powder - 1/2 tsp\n\n\u2022 Salt - 1/4 tsp\n\n\u2022 Garlic Powder (Optional) - 1/4 tsp\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther:\n\n\u2022 Potatoes (Washed & Peeled) - 4 Large\n\n\u2022 Cold Water (For Rinsing)\n\n\u2022 Oil (For Frying)\n\n\u2022 Juice of 1 Lemon/Lime (Optional)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Wash and peel the potatoes.\n\n2. If you want square fries, trim off a little of the round parts of the potato to square it up a little. Then cut into finger shape batons. \n\n3. The ideal size is 1 square cm or slightly less than half an inch. Place them cut batons into a large bowl full of fresh water. This will help remove the starch. \n\n4. Rinse well, then drain the water, re fill the bowl with cold water add lemon/lime juice and give them a second rinse. I have added lemon/lime juice to add mild tanginess to the fries.\n\n5. Drain once more and using a clean absorbent kitchen towel, pat dry in kitchen towel to remove excess moisture.\n\n6. Place your oil on high heat and bring to a temperature of 270\u00b0F \u2013 130\u00b0C.\n\n7. Blanch the fries for 7 to 8 mins or until the potatoes turn tender. they will not go brown at this stage.\n\n8. Drain off over kitchen towel and cool completely. \n\n9. Now that the fries have cooled down, bring back the oil to a temperature of 350\u00b0F \u2013 180\u00b0C.\n\n10. Deep fry in hot oil. Or fry the frozen fries (as shown in the video recipe).\n\n11. Stir occasionally. \n\n12. Fry in oil for approx 4 minutes, or until they are crisp and reach you desired color. Light golden brown is best.\n\n13. Drain off to remove excess oil.\n\n14. Sprinkle chilli salt seasoning. This step is optional. If you're a purist at heart, then simply use a fine salt.\n\nEnjoy fries with tomato ketchup or eat it as is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTIPS: \n\n\u2022 If you are looking to freeze the potatoes, then you can freeze the fries in zip lock bag upto 3 months.\n\n\u2022 Once finished, let the oil cool down then filter using a paper towel or coffee filter in a funnel and pour back into their original containers. Filtering will make your oil last longer.\n\n\u2022 Avoid over heating your oil as you will damage it's integrity. Never use a smoking oil.\n\n\u2022 Potatoes with high sugar content will give you the worse results. They will brown too quick and be floppy. Usually new potatoes are best. Try and buy low sugar content potatoes for perfect fries.

Halve and peel the onions. Halve each onion through the root. Peel away the skins.\n1. Thinly slice the onions. Thinly slice the onions into half-moons.\n1. Cut the half moon slices in half. Cut the onion slices in half. You should have at least 6 cups of sliced onions. But don't worry too much about quantities with this recipe; if you have an extra onion to use up, throw it in!\n1. Melt the butter with the oil. Place the butter and oil in a Dutch oven or large saut\u00e9 pan with deep sides over medium-low heat.\n1. Add the onions. After the butter foams up and then settles down, add the onions and stir to combine.\n1. Cover and cook for 15 minutes. Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 15 minutes.\n1. Season the onions. Uncover. The onions should have wilted down somewhat. Stir in the salt, a generous quantity of black pepper, and the sugar (this helps the onions caramelize).\n1. Cook the onions for 40 minutes to 1 hour. Turn the heat up to medium and cook uncovered, stirring every few minutes, until the onions are deeply browned. Turn down the heat if the onions scorch or stick to the pan; the browning doesn't come through burning, but through slow, even caramelization.\n1. Heat the broth. As the onions approach a deep walnut color, heat the broth in a separate pot.\n1. Add the flour. Add the flour to the caramelized onions and cook and stir for about 1 minute.\n1. Add broth and simmer for at least 1 hour. Add the hot broth to the caramelized onions and bring to a boil. If using wine, add this now too. Lower the heat and partially cover the pan. (If you want to add other aromatics such as herbs or spices, do so now.) Cook gently over low heat until the broth is slightly reduced, at least 1 hour.\n1. Taste and season. Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Add a finishing splash of brandy, if desired!\n1. Top with toast and cheese. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 350\u00b0F. Divide the soup between small but deep oven-safe bowls. Top each with a slice or two of toasted baguette and sprinkle grated cheese in a thick layer over the bread and up to the edge of the bowl.\n1. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes. Place the bowls on a rimmed baking sheet or in a casserole dish. Bake until the cheese is completely melted, 20 to 30 minutes.\n1. Broil until the cheese is browned. Turn the oven up to broil. Broil until the cheese is browned and bubbling, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove carefully from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving on heatproof dishes or trivets.

{"title": "A Healthier Low(er) Calorie Chicken Crunchwrap Supreme-Inspired Meal", "selftext": " An original chicken Crunchwrap supreme from Taco Bell is 580 calories/ 17 ww points (on the green plan). My version is 297 calories/ 6 ww smart points per serving. \n\nOne of my secrets is swapping out the ground beef for lean ground chicken breast. I also opted for fat-free Greek Yogurt, rather than sour cream. Now, keep in mind that to create this recipe, I did stick with the following branded tortillas, as they had lower calorie and point amounts. However, if you find another brand with comparable figures, go for that! \n\n  \n\nIngredients:\n\n\\-1-pound lean ground chicken breast\n\n\\-1 package of low-sodium store-brought taco seasoning-OR-a homemade seasoning with the following ingredients:\n\no \u00bd tsp. red chili powder (to your heat preference)\n\no 1 tsp. cumin\n\no 1 tsp. smoked paprika\n\no \u00bd tsp. salt\n\no 1 tsp. cracked black pepper\n\n\\-7 La Banderita Carb Counter White tortillas\n\n\\-6 Mission Street Tacos corn tortillas\n\n\\-7.5 ounces shredded cheddar cheese\n\n\\-6 tablespoons nonfat Greek yogurt\n\n\\-1 large onion, diced\n\n\\-1 large tomato, diced \n\n\\-1.5 cups shredded iceberg lettuce\n\n\\-1/3 cup water\n\nCooking spray\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Prepping the tostada shells:\n\na. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. While the oven is pre-heating, lightly coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Gently place each of the Mission street taco corn tortillas in a single-lined row, and lightly salt and coat the top with cooking spray. Bake the tortillas for a total of 6 minutes, and flip halfway. Immediately remove from oven to cool off and crisp, once finished baking (to avoid burning the tostadas). \n\n2. While the toastadas are baking, heat up a skillet to medium-high, lightly coating with cooking spray. Add ground chicken, onion, taco seasoning, and 1/3 cup of water into mixture and cook the chicken for about 10-15 minutes until, the water has evaporated, and the meat reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. Make sure to stir frequently.\n\n3. While the chicken is cooking, take one La Banderita tortilla and cut that into equal portions, Set aside.\n\n4. Crunchy wrap assembly time! Be sure to assemble the crunchy wraps in the following order:\n\na. La Banderita tortilla\n\nb. Add about 1/3 cup of ground chicken mixture to center of tortilla\n\nc. Top the chicken with 2 tbsp. of shredded cheese\n\nd. Top the cheese with a tostada shell.\n\ne. Layer tostada shell with 1 tbsp. Greek yogurt\n\nf. Sprinkle 1 tbsp diced tomatoes and 1 tbsp. lettuce over the sour cream.\n\ng. Add the 1/6 piece of La Banderita tortilla piece over the lettuce and tomatoes.\n\nh. Sprinkle \u00bd tbsp. cheese over the La Banderita tortilla slice. \n\ni. Gently fold all the sides of the large La Banderita Tortilla over the wrap, until only the top of the La Banderita slice is showing (see picture). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Grill the Crunchwrap in one of two ways:\n\na. Panini press (preferred method): Lightly coat a panini press with cooking spray, and toast for about 2-3 minutes, or until the wrap is a light golden brown on the outside. \n\nb. Skillet: Lightly coat a skillet with cooking spray and GENTLY place your wrap folded side down. Allow each side to grill on medium-high for about 2 minutes, or until lightly golden brown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6.

It makes me happy.\n\nWe have some [Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/OMjcoJV) and a [Recipe Video](https://youtu.be/TFWfpcWNL7A) if you'd like to check it out.\n\nIngredients :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n250gr pasta\n\n100gr yellow bell pepper (you can use red, or kapia pepper) I prefer these for their sweetness\n\n1 yellow onion (I forgot to measure this, but around 100 grams should be enough)\n\n5 cloves of garlic\n\n150-200gr bacon (but don't let anyone to tell you how much bacon you should put in your pasta, as someone said, measure that shit with your heart)\n\n1/2-1tsp White pepper, smoked paprika and salt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Cheesy sauce we gonna need : 70gr butter, 60gr flour, 700ml milk, black pepper, salt and 200gr cheese\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to start with, I recommend doing the sauce first. Take a pan, get the butter in, when it melts add the flour. Mix it and cook it for around 5 minutes, but you don't want to brown it so be careful. Have the milk to be warm, or at least room temp. Add little by little and mix with a whisk. After you added like half of it, just add the rest and continue to mix.\n\nYou should get a nice creamy sauce at this point, but a LITTLE thicker than a b\u00e9chamel. At this point add black pepper and salt, and start to add your cheese in. I added the cheese in 3 parts so I can make sure it melts nicely and I can get the consistency I wanted to. You can also add it all at once, but you may want to have less cheese in there.\n\nNow pasta. Have some water to boil with salt, and cook the past in it between 7 to 10 minutes, depending on what pasta you gonna use, or how cooked you want them. I personally don't like al dente pasta, so I cooked it for around 9 minutes.\n\nIn a cold pan, add your bacon and let it cook in its own fat. When it get nice and crispy or how you like it, remove it from the pan, but keep that fat there. Now have the onion finely chopped and the yellow red bell pepper bite size pieces. Add it to that fat and cook it until the onion starts to get color, and add your finely chopped garlic. Cook it for around half-1 minute, and add some butter in. Around 30grams of butter. Put your pasta in, and coat it with that butter.\n\nNow add the sauce and like 2-3 tbsp. of that pasta water and cook it for 1 more minute while mixing to coat everything nicely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it! Serve it with some pecorino or parmigiano, or even more normal cheese will work. \n\nI hope you gonna like these as much as I do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/l9h11g/easy_cheesy_bacon_pasta/", "created_utc": 1612114051.0, "score": 150, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/l9h11g/easy_cheesy_bacon_pasta/", "html_title": ""}

Easy, fast, and delicious, especially during the tomato season. \n\nIngredients list: \n\n1 tbsp Olive oil \n\n10-15 cherry tomatoes ore one regular GOOD tomato (if in season) \n\n1 piece of quality bread or ciabatta \n\n2 tsp of cream cheese \n\n1-2 cloves of garlic \n\nBunch of rocket salad \n\n1 tsp balsamic glaze \n\n1 egg \n\n4-5 asparagus stems (optional) \n\nShavings of parmesan (optional) \n\nFew basil leaves (optional) \n\nMethod: \n\n1. Place a non-stick pan on medium heat. Wash and add cherry tomatoes to the pan (uncut), lightly drizzle with olive oil and salt, crush 1-2 cloves of garlic and throw them in the pan as well just to give out flavor. This is one place where you could also add the basil - if using \n2. If using asparagus, place it near the tomatoes in the pan, since it cooks a little longer \n3. Move the pan around to roll the tomatoes for more or less even caramelization. You can cook them for as long or little as you want. When they've given some liquid, get your bread and toast in in the pan, collecting some of that tomato juice with it. If you fancy, you could grab the toasted garlic and rub it onto the toast afterwards \n4. When the bread is toasted, take it out of the pan and make a sunny-side up egg (or a scramble, or even a poached egg - that's up to you) \n5. Smother the cream cheese (e.g. Philadelphia) onto the toast. Then on the toast go the tomatoes (and few torn leaves of basil - if using), then the rocket salad. Bunch it all up, crack some black pepper onto the rocket, shave some parmesan (if using). Lightly drizzle everything with the balsamic \n6. Plate up the toast with the egg and the asparagus with some parmesan shaved on top. Consume \n\nThis is one of the simplest (except for a regular scramble of course) and tastiest breakfast dishes I've had for the past months, and very versatile. Change up the bread, go for fresh, not toasted tomatoes (if in season, otherwise charred cherries are the best option), leave out the parmesan, basil and asparagus for a really basic and quick yet tasty breakfast \u2013 the whole process takes place in one pan and takes about 15 minutes, and you can even brew some coffee on the side at the same time. \n\nIt looks too good not to share a pic, so here you are: [https://imgur.com/a/ZY0SZRe](https://imgur.com/a/ZY0SZRe)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/nppxnv/tomato_toast_my_top_breakfast_of_2021/", "created_utc": 1622539540.0, "score": 150, "author": "timmeh129", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/nppxnv/tomato_toast_my_top_breakfast_of_2021/", "html_title": ""}

In a non stick pan, heat up cooking oil until its hot and add in the batter about the size of a palm. \n3. While the first side is cooking, twirl your pan around so the jeon swirls around the pan, this is to try to let the oil get to the bottom. \n4. Flip, then cook both sides until crispy\n5.

Pumpkin seeds can be roasted with the white shell on it or as just the green nut part (Pepitas!), but this is the easy quick way with the white shell like you might find at the store.

Get them all separated as best you can.\n\nPut them out on a baking sheet and try to pat them dry as much as possible. They will probably stick to your paper towel/rag, but just shake them or brush them off. They will still be a little bit slimy and wet, we just want to make sure there isn't water all over the place.\n\nOnce they are sufficiently dry, put them in a bowl and drizz some olive oil or sesame oil on them and add your seasonings. Salt and pepper work fine but you can go nuts with it. I have some Amish popcorn seasoning that reminds me of the stuff at the bottom of a bag of sunflower seeds so I made a batch with Ranch and another with Salt, Pepper, and garlic powder.\n\nPut the seasoned seeds on a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for a total of **15 minutes**, tossing them every 5 minutes to encourage browning.

{"title": "My Italian Mom's Eggplant Parmigiana! (Eggplant Parmesan!) \ud83c\udf46\ud83e\uddc0", "selftext": "Eggplant parmigiana, also known as eggplant parmesan, is a vegetarian lasagna that's made with thin slices of eggplant (in place of the pasta!), a beautifully rich tomato sauce, and plenty of molten mozzarella and parmesan cheese!  \ud83c\udf46\ud83e\uddc0 \n\nThis is my wife's Mom's recipe, and she shows you how to make this the traditional way by frying the eggplant. However we also mention how to bake them too, in case you want to make this dish a little healthier! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\n\nIf you're a visual learner, her recipe video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuXpyUv7bE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuXpyUv7bE)\n\n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**\n\n500g flour (all purpose or plain)  \n3 medium eggplants (aubergines)  \n20g (3 1/2 tsp.) salt  \n2g (1/4 tsp.) pepper  \n200g parmesan cheese  \n500g mozzarella, grated or cubed  \n1 litre tomato sauce  \nvegetable oil, for frying  \n**This recipe serves 4-6 people!**  \n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Chop your 3 eggplants into 1cm thin slices and lay the cutlets out on a large, clean kitchen towel. Discard the top and bottom pieces of the eggplant. Once your eggplant cutlets are all laid out, sprinkle some salt over them to help draw out the moisture in preparation for dredging. Your eggplant cutlets will brown due to oxidisation; this is fine!\n\n2. To a bowl, add 500g all purpose or plain flour, 20g salt and 2g pepper. Give this a stir to combine. Dredge your eggplant cutlets by placing them into the flour mix, thoroughly covering both sides. Place your flour-covered cutlets onto a baking tray in preparation for frying or baking! Important: Don\u2019t let the cutlets overlap; they\u2019ll stick to each other!\n\n3. Cook your eggplant cutlets ...\n\n**Option 1 - Frying (Traditional):** Fill a large saut\u00e9 pan with vegetable oil - approximately 1 inch deep \u2013 and bring up to temperature. How do you know when the oil is hot enough? Simply sprinkle some flour into the oil and it should \u2018crackle\u2019! That means it\u2019s hot enough to begin cooking your eggplant cutlets! Carefully place your cutlets into the oil away from you to prevent splash back. Once you see browning on the edges, flip the cutlets over. It\u2019ll take a few minutes each side for the eggplant to cook! Once brown on both sides, remove from the oil and place onto a tray lined with kitchen roll. The kitchen roll will help soak up any excess oil.\n\n**Option 2 \u2013 Baking (Healthier):** Bake your eggplant cutlets in the oven at 220C | 425F until they look crispy and golden brown.\n\n4. Let\u2019s assemble! Add a thin layer of tomato sauce to the bottom of your baking dish. Now add a layer of your eggplant slices, making sure they overlap and cover the majority of the sauce. If you need to cut or break some of the slices to make them fit, that\u2019s fine! Push down on the completed layer of eggplants.\n\n5. Add another layer of sauce, but more so than the first layer. Then generously sprinkle with mozzarella and parmesan! Add another layer of eggplant slices, cover with more tomato sauce and then sprinkle on more mozzarella and parmesan.\n\n6. Continue building in this order until you run of out of space \u2013 or ingredients!\n\n7. Cover your baking dish with aluminium foil and bake in a preheated oven for 45 minutes at 180C | 350F. With 10 minutes left on the timer, remove the foil to crisp up that top layer of cheese!\n\n8. Remove from the oven and let your eggplant parmigiana cool for around 10-15 minutes.\n\n9. Serve and enjoy!  \n\n\nIf you have any questions about this recipe, please do feel free to ask below!!

Pour one cup (16 tbsp.) all-purpose flour into a wide dish and season with salt and ground black pepper. Give it a quick stir and set aside.\n2. Prepare your chicken! I like to slice mine into cutlets, so place a chicken breast down on your cutting board and slice horizontally through, approximately half way up the chicken breast. You want try and cut these pieces as evenly as possible in order for them to cook at the same rate.\n3. Bring a large saut\u00e9 pan up to medium-high heat and add 2 tbsp. olive oil \u2013 or use the oil from your sundried tomatoes! Add 2 tbsp. butter to the pan.\n4. Pick up one of your chicken cutlets and drop it into your flour mix. Give it a good press down and then flip it over. Ensure the chicken cutlet is fully covered before you place it into your sizzling saut\u00e9 pan! Do this for all your cutlets.\n5. Now for the sauce! Crush 3 cloves of garlic, chop you sundried tomatoes into ribbons, and chiffonade your basil. This process might sound fancy, but it\u2019s really easy! All of you need to do is stack your basil leaves on top of each other, roll into a tight cylinder and gently cut very thin slices of the cylinder crosswise.\n6. Once your chicken is starting to brown, flip your cutlets over and continue to cook. Once your cutlets are almost finished, remove them from the pan and let them rest.\n7. Add your crushed garlic into the pan and cook for around 20 seconds \u2013 just long enough for the garlic to lose it\u2019s sharpness. Add in 1 tsp. oregano and 1 tsp. dried thyme and give that a stir to allow these to toast up in the buttery oil. Add 1 cup (250ml) of a good quality chicken stock.\n8. Once the chicken stock has reduced by half, turn down the heat to medium-low and add in 1 cup (250ml) of heavy/double cream. Give that a good stir, then add in \u00bd cup of parmesan cheese.\n9. Once the cheese has melted and the sauce is looking smooth and creamy, add in your sundried tomatoes. Give your sauce a taste and season accordingly. Now add your chicken cutlets \u2013 including any juices!!\n10. Let all of those favours \u2018marry\u2019 for approximately 5 minutes, then sprinkle your basil on top and serve!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, feel free to ask me below!

Take 6-10 hard boiled eggs and place them on a smoker for 1 hour. Temp should not exceed 200 degees (F). We're not trying to cook them any further than they already are, it's all about infusing with smoke. I use Apple wood but feel free to choose the smoking wood you prefer for flavor. (Also, if you don't own a smoker, this isn't required and you can skip this step, though you'd be missing out on the whole smoky flavor component for the recipe)\n2. After 30 minutes on the smoker, make sure to check the eggs and flip them over for even smoke distribution. \n3. After 1 hour, check on eggs and remove if they've picked up enough smoke to your liking. They should appear darker and yellowed from the process. \n4. Place your smoked eggs into a 1 Quart mason jar. \n5. Also add the rosemary, thyme jalapeno peppers, and pepper flakes into the jar. \n6. In a small to medium sauce pan combine the water, vinegar, pepper, salt, garlic, and pickling spice. \n7. Bring the pan to a boil and then immediately pour the brine into your jar. Make sure all solids are transferred into the jar and leave an inch of head space at the top.\n8. Carefully wipe off the rim of your jar and then take a new sanitized mason jar lid and screw on until finger tight. \n9. Let cool on counter for 15 or so minutes until you can safely handle it and transfer it into your fridge. \n10. Leave the jar in your fridge for a minimum of 1 week before opening and tasting. \n11.

Peel, slice, and cut into finger-size strips, about 3 inches. Soak in salt water for at least 30 mins. Set aside.   \n2. Prepare the breading mix. In one bowl, crack an egg, add salt, pepper, paprika, and Italian seasoning/herbs, mix well. Set aside.   \n3. In another bowl, mix 1 cup of cornstarch with salt and pepper  \n4. I ran out of bread crumbs so I use corn flakes in this recipe. Simply grind 1 cup of corn flakes and pour in a separate bowl. Now, this completes your breading.   \n5. Now pat dry the eggplant using a paper towel, dip in the egg mixture first, dredge in cornstarch mixture, back in egg mixture then coat with cornflakes crumbs. just repeat with the rest of the eggplants. 6. Heat oil in a pan, and fry it until golden brown..serve hot with favorite dipping sauce.

You don\u2019t have to be neat here. Go ahead and make it rustic\n\n2) Add the lemon juice into the strawberries. Make sure you remove any seeds that may end up in the bowl. The lemon juice not only helps by mellowing the overall sweetness of the jam, it also helps activate the pectins in the strawberry which is what gives jam its thick consistency.\n\n3) Add the sugar to the strawberries. Mix well and allow to macerate for one hour. This helps break down the fruit and pulls out the liquid that helps dissolve the sugar.\n\n4) Add the strawberry mixture into a small pot, making sure that there is enough room in the pot such that it will not overboil. Heat the strawberry mixture over medium heat.\n\n5) Make sure you do not walk away and do not let the jam burn. Stir and scrap the bottom of the pot constantly. Once the jam is bubbling, lower the heat to medium. Remove any foam that appears at the top of the pot.\n\n6) Put a plate into the freezer for at least 10 minutes. Next, remove the plate from the freezer and add a teaspoon worth of jam to the plate and gently spread it around. When the jam has cooled, run your finger through the jam and gently share the plate. If the mark you left with your finger in the jam holds firm, your jam is ready.\n\n7) Before you bottle your jam, sterilise your jar. Preheat your oven to 160 Degrees Celcius or 320 Degrees Fahrenheit. Wash the jar and the lid in hot soapy water but don\u2019t dry them. Place the Jar and the lid into the oven for 15 minutes. Take the jar and lid out of the oven and allow to cool. \n\n8) You can now start bottling the strawberry jam. Use a funnel if you have one. Be careful as the strawberry jam may still be very hot.\n\n9) Enjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/iasye3/how_to_make_strawberry_jam_with_only_3_ingredients/", "created_utc": 1597587027.0, "score": 142, "author": "tedteo", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/iasye3/how_to_make_strawberry_jam_with_only_3_ingredients/", "html_title": ""}

Add in 1/3 of egg mixture and when halfway cooked, roll forwards. \n3. Reapply oil, add egg mixture,  roll, repeat. \n4. Let omelette rest for a minute so the insides cook.  \n\nTips: \n\n* If the first roll breaks or overcooks, its okay, it is there to mainly make the shape. \n* Lift up the omelette and let the egg go under for the second and third roll to help them stick together. \n* Use VERY VERY low heat, it is easier and also lowers the chance of overcooking.

Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese", "selftext": "Hey again, I guess I just like posting here anytime I think of something randomly that is extremely easy, but that's somewhat part of the point, no?\n\nI LOVE buffalo mac and cheese, but I also like the most minimal effort possible when making food most of the time.\n\nYou only need three ingredients. \n\nKraft Mac and Cheese Deluxe (I like this because you don't have to deal with all that \"add milk and butter\" stuff, just pour that cheese on and eat). You can also do the Velveeta equivalent. \n\nFrank's Buffalo Sauce (if you know a spicier brand then please tell me! Frank's is delicious but I'd like some mac and cheese that destroys me) \n\nWhatever premade chicken nugget/tenders/strips you can get in the frozen aisle. \n\nYou probably already know what to do with all of these, but for the sake of sub tradition:\n\n1. Boil that kraft macaroni until done ( 11 - 12 minutes) while heating up the pre-cooked chicken. I don't care if you use skillet, microwave, or oven, that is up to you.  \n2. Drain\n3. Pour that cheese packet on\n4. Mix\n5. Pour that buffalo sauce in (be careful, you can always add more, but you can't take the sauce out. You'll know when it's the right amount for you). You'll want an orange color, but not too orange that you can't taste the cheese anymore and the entire thing is too vinegary. Add a little, stir, add a bit more, stir, taste along the way if you need to. With spicier buffalo sauce, you'll need to be more careful with this step. I don't have measurements, sorry, but this is a \"recipe\" that is so simple that you don't really need that. Heck, you can simply mix in buffalo sauce while on the plate, it's not that serious. \n6. Throw the chicken on the buffalo mac.\n\nIf you want even easier, use Kraft easy mac and put the buffalo and chicken in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do know that you can make homemade mac and cheese quite easily with just some milk, sharp cheddar, and macaroni (I'm probably gonna try this one day while throwing hamburger in it, in fact.) but I am going for REALLY easy with these posts, you basically just boil some noodles and put everything in it.

{"title": "2 Types of Garlic Bread", "selftext": "So...garlic bread! Is there anyone who doesn't love garlic bread? Seriously! There are many ways to make your garlic bread, and I'm here to share my \"fancy\" garlic bread recipe. We're not gonna make bread from scratch for this, but you can totally do it if you want.\n\nThere are really simple ways to make garlic bread. Put the bread in the oven or in a hot pan to get some crisp and rub a garlic on it.\n\nOr just mix room temp butter + chopped garlic + parsley or other herbs and put it on a bread, put it in the oven to crisp and boom you have it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what about something fancier ? A [recipe video](https://youtu.be/Lv2OkDoAlF4) and [some pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/o7oMVla)\n\nFor ingredients you gonna need enough butter to cover the garlic while cooking. Then onion powder, black pepper, dried basil, dried tomatoes. Bacon or smoked salty ham. This really depends on how much you wanna make. For 200grams of butter I used like 1 teaspoon for condiments.  \n\nGet some bacon or a smoked salty ham and cook it in the oven until crisp. We gonna use it as topping after the garlic bread is done.\n\nTake A LOT of butter and melt it on low flame. When it melts, add your garlic and let it on low flame until the garlic gets really, really soft. When that's done, remove the garlic from the butter, but don't discard the butter. You gonna need it a little later. Use a knife to smash the garlic, it should be very easy, chop it and press it to form a paste.\n\nTake some dried tomatoes. This is not the type that's crunchy. They're a little soft. I'm sure you can use the kind that's stored in oil. Anyway, take like 1 or 2 dried tomatoes, depending on how much garlic you gonna use. The dried tomatoes should be like a third of the garlic quantity. Chop it in very small pieces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, after that melted butter got to room temp, add like a table spoon of olive oil, put the garlic in, some onion powder, black pepper, dried basil, and the dried tomatoes. Mix it, and you should get a more paste like consistency. If you don't, let it cool a little more. Now spread this on your bread and cook it at 180 degree Celsius until crisp.\n\nYou can also use some shredded cheese on top of your choice. I had tried one with a mix of pecorino and a nice cheddar, but I didn't like it as much, because the cheese take a lot of space when it come to taste. When is done, get some of that crispy ham and smash it in little pieces to make a topping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sweetness of the dried tomatoes, with the saltiness of the ham, with the garlic taste and all those spices combined works REALLY really well. At least I like it, this is by far my favorite garlic bread recipe. \n\nI love this kind of garlic bread because is so versatile and you can never have too many recipes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/l40y8t/2_types_of_garlic_bread/", "created_utc": 1611500657.0, "score": 140, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/l40y8t/2_types_of_garlic_bread/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Fried Semolina Pudding with Strawberry Sauce", "selftext": " \n\nI made fried semolina pudding! I don't know how popular this thing is in your area, but semolina pudding was a very popular desert for kids in my country many years ago. I still make myself from time to time because I just love it. It is super easy to customize with fresh fruits, jams, fruit sauce, cinnamon, peanut butter, caramel...and so on. You can eat it warm, cold, have a thicker texture or a smoother one, fried like this...is just a really great dessert.  \nAnyway recipe right?\n\n[Video recipe!](https://youtu.be/yBYnEhSW5TU)\n\nFor the pudding :  \n\\- 220gr semolina  \n\\- 1L milk 3,5%fat (The fat percentage will only make the pudding to feel more \"rich\")  \n\\- 5gr vanilla extract  \n\\- 5ml almond extract (Be careful this is strong, you can avoid it)  \n\\- 65gr sugar  \nCoating  \n\\- Breadcrumbs, 2eggs, cornstarch or flour  \nFor the Sauce  \n\\- 350gr Strawberries  \n\\- 150gr sugar  \n\\- Squeeze of lemon  \nExtra  \n\\- Some fresh strawberries to eat this with.\n\nSo you need a pan, with a thicker bottom. Add the milk, vanilla, almond extract, sugar and semolina. Put it on medium heat and mix it well. You can use a wooden spoon or a whisk, it is up to you. I use a spoon because is easier to wash after. You will have to mix this to not stick to the bottom. I don't have an exact time of this to cook.\n\nThe thing is, it will thicken and it will be harder and harder to mix. At the point where it sticks to the spoon it should be ready. But as I said it before you can eat it in many ways. But for fried pudding we need to have a thick texture. So when it starts to get thicker, put the heat on low and continue to mix 1 more minute. Transfer it to a pan that you spread some butter to it, so it would be easier to unstuck the pudding later.\n\nWhen this thing gets cold it will harden enough. It doesn't matter the thickness when you poor it in the pan, you only need to cook the coating later. It is really up to you. Make it cubes and serve it for a small party, make it squares, sticks...whatever you feel. It is best to let it rest till the next day. Let it sit overnight in the fridge. Then cut it in the forms you want, and let them in the freezer 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile prepare your coating, Cornstarch > Eggs > Breadcrumbs. I use cornstarch because it sticks way better than flour in my opinion. Deep fry them in hot oil until you get the nice golden-golden brown color on them. You don't have to worry about cooking anything else but the coating.\n\nPut them on a kitchen towel or something to drain the excess oil from them, and enjoy them warm or cold. I prefer them a little warm. Of course, now it gets to the customization part which is up to you.\n\nI made a strawberry sauce for them. Put the strawberries in a pan with the sugar, and a squeeze of lemon (It really doesn't matter how little you put). I never measure that, I just cut like 25% of a lemon and squeeze that in. You can squeeze less or more. Have all this on low-medium heat and give them a small mix from time to time. When the strawberries get mushy, transfer them to a blender and make the sauce. Don't use it hot, let it cool down a little.  \nYou can avoid the sauce and use a jam. You can skip all these and use just fruits, peanut butter or other sweet dipping sauces. It is up to you, go and explore!\n\nI hope you gonna enjoy this!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/nbn2h2/fried_semolina_pudding_with_strawberry_sauce/", "created_utc": 1620929169.0, "score": 135, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/nbn2h2/fried_semolina_pudding_with_strawberry_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Green Serrano Pepper Hot Sauce | How to Make Easy and Delicious Homemade Hot Sauce", "selftext": "This is my absolute favorite Green Hot Sauce recipe. It's great on a multitude of dishes as a dab of sharpness and heat, and extremely easy to make. I typically use Green Serrano peppers, as for whatever reason they are abundant in my local grocery stores, but you can sub them for green Jalapeno peppers if you prefer. I've found them to be very similar in flavor profile. Also, Jalapenos are milder...\n\nI created a step by step video walking through this recipe that can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPGTkiuuDxM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPGTkiuuDxM)\n\nIf you like what you see, please make sure to like the video and subscribe to my channel. I post weekly recipes and would love to have you along for the journey. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients List:\n\n1 lb Green Serrano Peppers (Use Green Jalapenos if you prefer)\n\n1-2 Super hot chili peppers, Ghost Pepper, Carolina Reaper, etc. (optional)\n\n4 cloves garlic\n\nOlive Oil\n\n1/2 Tbsp salt (more to taste)\n\n1/2 tsp minced ginger\n\n1 cup White Vinegar (more to taste)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSupplies List:\n\nBlender\n\nWorking oven\n\nBaking Pan\n\nKnife\n\nSieve/fine mesh strainer\n\nLarge bowl\n\nSilicone Spatula\n\nFunnel\n\nSkewer (optional)\n\nBottles for finished sauce\n\nLatex Gloves or Tongs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Take a knife and cut the tops off of all peppers\n2. Place the peppers and garlic in baking pan\n3. Cover peppers and garlic in an even coating of olive oil\n4. Roast your peppers for 20 minutes at 400 degrees (F). You're welcome to scorch them over fire, or even smoke them, but I wanted to share the simplest method for this recipe using an oven. \n5. take the peppers and garlic out the oven and place into a blender. \n6. Add 1/2 teaspoon minced/grated ginger and 1/2 Tablespoon of kosher salt to blender. \n7. Roughly chop the ingredients in the blender\n8. Add 1 cup of white vinegar and blend until completely smooth. Taste your sauce and add whatever comes to mind, to taste. (great thing about this sauce is you can build so many personal flavor profiles from the basic recipe, but try the basic one first go around)\n9. Pour the blender's contents through a fine sieve gently pressing it through using a silicone spatula. (save the leftover mash and seeds in your freezer because I have a quick recipe video coming out on how to dehydrate that waste into a chili pepper seasoning. \n10. Once the sauce has been filtered, use a funnel and pour into bottles of your liking. Make sure to stir the sauce in between pours to ensure consistent thickness. \n11. Store in the fridge and enjoy! \n\nLet me know if you give this recipe a try. I love hot sauce, peppers, and all things cooking. I use this sauce daily and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

{"title": "You you want easy? I got you: Part 3. Chicken parm and fettuccine Alfredo with brocolli.", "selftext": "I am not sure if these are usually eaten together, but I love then both and I think this makes for a nice easy meal. \n\nIf you've seen my last two posts I keep things as simple as humanly possible, they are barely recipes but have just enough effort that they are not prepackaged frozen dinners. I also don't give measurements because I don't have measurements, but don't worry, this will be easy to slap together and it is delicious. \n\nYou will need Tyson air fried frozen chicken patties, some shredded parm and mozzarella, a jar of Alfredo sauce, a jar of marinara, and a frozen steam able brocolli bag. I also suggest cracked black pepper.\n\n1. Follow cooking instructions on chicken bag: spray pan with pam and bake for 23 minutes at 425f (remember to preheat oven of course).\n\n\n\n2. Boil water in a pot and add a dash of salt.\n\n\n\n3. Put  the fettuccine in the water and let it sit in \nthere for 10-ish minutes or desired doneness.\n\n\n\n4. After noodles are done, drain and put back into pot.\n\n\n\n5. Pour in the Alfredo. Don't go crazy! Remember, I didn't specify how MUCH noodles to use. This will vary on how many people you are feeding or how hungry you are. Pour in a little, stir, pour in some more, stir. You'll know when there is enough, it shouldn't be cream noodle soup, but it should be enough to cover everything. Leave the heat on a lower setting so it can be warm when the other stuff is ready. \n\n\n\n6. By now the chicken needs to be flipped. Flip and spoon on the marinara and the cheese. It can be however much you want, but you probably don't want marinara soup. \n\n\n\n7. Microwave that steamed brocolli. After done, open bag and put in a little bit of salt and pepper, just a BIT, the Alfredo sauce is already rich and flavorful. Close and shake the bag. \n\n\n\n8. Throw however much brocolli you like into pasta. You might want to chop it up if you don't like whole mouthfuls of brocolli. Plus you'll feel like you are making something harder than it actually is!\n\n\n\n9. If you are like me you can go crazy on cracked black pepper, if not, you don't need it or can just add however much you want.\n\n\n\n10. Chicken's ready! \n\n11. Plate your meal. (Chicken should probably rest for 5-10 minutes so you don't burn your mouth).\n\n\n\nVery easy and delicious American-Italian dinner. It may not be as fast as my last two posts but we used the oven this time and so the chicken will be nice! \n\nAlso, I believe this recipe is vegetarian friendly if you use Gardein chicken patties. But these companies like to be hard on vegetarians a lot of the times so check the ingredients for everything you are using.\n\nI have fun sharing these and I bet I'll continue having more ideas. \n\nSome people like to put bacon into their Alfredo and so if you want to do that, simply grab another pan and cook bacon for 2 minutes on medium on each side. But I think the chicken parm and Alfredo already make for a rich meal with the brcolli aiding to have something delicious and healthy tasting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/lezm9k/you_you_want_easy_i_got_you_part_3_chicken_parm/", "created_utc": 1612743836.0, "score": 126, "author": "Earthy_Eagle", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/lezm9k/you_you_want_easy_i_got_you_part_3_chicken_parm/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Quick and Easy Tuna Salad on Toast (For when you have to rush or don't have much money)", "selftext": "When I'm hungry with little money and time, one of the things I love to eat most is tuna on toast.

You can always double the recipe.\n\nHere's what you'll need:\n\n* 1 5 oz. can of tuna, drained (I know it looks like 15, it's not. Trust me. Also, I personally use Aldi brand tuna since it's cheap, but feel free to use any kind you want.)\n* 2 baby dill pickles, or sliced pickles, finely chopped (You can substitute relish if you want)\n* 3 tbsp. mayonnaise (Kraft is my absolute favorite, but feel free to use miracle whip or whatever you want\n* 2 pieces of bread, toasted\n\nHow to make: \n\n* Start off with your toast. Place it in the toaster. While you wait, you can make the tuna salad.\n* Place your mayo in a bowl. \n* Finely chop your pickles, combine with the mayo. It helps to more evenly mix everything if you mix part of it first and then add in the rest.\n* Drain your tuna and add it in. \n* Mix until evenly distributed.\n* Get your toast out of the toaster and spoon it onto the bread.

{"title": "Russian Meatballs in a Sweet and Sour Tomato Sauce", "selftext": "\nYou have never eaten meatballs like this before! They are not fried but cooked directly in the sauce. They are juicy,\u00a0 tender, flavorful and have a little par-boiled rice in the filling for an amazing texture. The sauce is slightly sour and slightly sweet. You HAVE to try these! In Russia and the Ukraine,\u00a0 these meatballs are typically served over mashed potatoes. You can definitely serve these over pasta, rice or just a crusty loaf of French bread for dipping as well! \n\nClick on the link to watch a quick video to see just how easy this is to make. [Russian Meatballs in a Sweet and Sour Tomato Sauce](https://youtu.be/VPa7D0hKvNQ)\n\n\nIngredients: \n\nFor the Meatballs: \n\n\u2022 Ground Beef - 2 pounds \n\n\u2022 Bread Crumbs\u00a0 - 1/2 of a cup \n\n\u2022 Rice - 1/3 of a cup \n\n\u2022 Milk - 1/2 of a cup \n\n\u2022 Crushed Garlic - 5 to 6 cloves \n\n\u2022 Eggs - 2 \n\n\u2022 Parsley - 1 Bunch - Thick ends of the stems removed, Finely Chopped. \n\n\u2022 Salt and Pepper to taste \n\nFor the Tomato Sauce: \n\n\u2022 Chicken Stock - 2 Quarts. You can also use Beef Stock, Vegetabl3 Stock or Water if you dont have any Chicken Stock on hand. If your using water, just season the sauce a little bit heavier so it doesn't lack in flavor. \n\n\u2022\u00a0 Pureed Tomatoes- 16 ounces \n\n\u2022 Sugar - 1/3 of a cup \n\n\u2022 Dried Parsley - 2 teaspoons \n\n\u2022 Dried Dill - 2 Tablespoons \n\n\u2022 Salt - 2 teaspoons \n\n\u2022 Pepper - 1 teaspoon\n\n\n\nDirections: \n\n\u2022 Step 1 - Start by par-boiling your rice. In a microwave safe bowl,\u00a0 add 1/3 of a cup of long grain rice and 1 cup of water. Place in the microwave for 2.5 minutes on high power. Let it stand in the microwave for another 2 minutes before removing. \n\n\u2022 Step 2 - Remove rice from the microwave and take a few grains with your fingers and pinch the rice. It should be semi-soft. You will still have water left in the bowl. Drain the rice well and set aside. \n\n\u2022 Step 3 - Start making the Sauce. In a large pot or Dutch Oven, Turn the heat onto high, Add your stock, Tomato Puree, Sugar, Dried Parsley, Dried Dill, Salt and Pepper. Whisk well to combine and bring to a boil. \nThis will reduce the sauce and enhance the flavors before we put the meatballs in the sauce to cook. \n\n\u2022 Step 4 - Start making the Meatball mixture. Place your ground beef in a large mixing bowl. Add Salt and Pepper, bread crumbs,\u00a0 Milk, crushed Garlic, chopped parsley and the par-boiled rice. Mix with your hands until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.\u00a0 \n\u2022 Step 5 - Line a baking sheet with tin foil and brush will oil so the meatballs dont stick. \n\n\u2022 Step 6 - Take a medium sized, spring loaded Ice Cream scoop (about 2 Tablespoons capacity), and fill the scoop with the ground beef mixture. Try not to overfill the scoop so all of your meatballs are the same size. Drop the scooped meatball onto your baking sheet. Continue doing this until all of the ground beef mixture is finished. I ended up with 22 meatballs. \n\n\u2022 Step 7 - Time to form the Meatballs. Fill a cup or small bowl of water for wetting your hands. This will make it easier to form and roll the Meatballs. Wet your hands and take a meatball of the sheet pan. Roll it into a ball with the palms of your hands and place it back on the sheet pan. Wet your hands each time you roll a new meatball. Continue this process until you have formed all of your meatballs. \n\u2022 Step 8 - Reduce the sauce to a simmer and whisk. Try to get all of the spices off the sides of the pot so they don't burn. \n\n\u2022 Step 9 - Slowly lower your meatballs into the sauce working in a circle. Continue layering your meatballs in the sauce until they are all in the pot. DO NOT STIR. You will break up the meatballs. Turrn the heat back up to high and bring to a boil, uncovered. \n\n\u2022 Step 10 - Once the meatballs have come to a boil, lower the heat back down to simmer and carefully take any spices off the sides of the pot and very gently mix them back into the sauce. \n\n\u2022 Step 11 - Paertially cover your pot with a lid leaving about an inch of the lid open. Simmer for about 35 minutes.\u00a0 Keep an eye on it so it doesn't start boiling over. If it does start boiling over, just remove the lid and simmer for an additional 5 minutes longer. \n\n\u2022 Step 12 - When the meatballs have been boiling for 35-40 minutes and they are ready, Gently stir the meatballs around and mix the sauce. Taste for salt and pepper and add more if needed. The sauce is a little thinner than what you are used to but its perfect for dipping your bread in.

{"title": "Pop Tarts? Personal Pies? Strawberries Pineapple Peach Jam and Apple Pie Filling", "selftext": "So first of all, let me start by saying that I don't know if having icing is a MUST for poptarts. All I know that for me, it is not. They're already sweet enough, but even if I saw this, I added powdered sugar on top. I probably should have made some icing at least for the recipe but I will write the recipe for it anyway.\n\nAnd now, back to these things. We will make 2 different fillings for them. I personally call them poptarts, a friend of mine called them personal pies because they're kinda big, and 1 is enough for a person. So you decide if these are poptarts or not, what's important is the filling. \n\n[Some pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/3gokauN) if you'd like to see them\n\nSo ingredients :\n\nStore Bought Pie Dough. Use homemade if you really want to waste time making one. I personally don't find it necessary. It is better? Depends on what butter you use it can be better or not. But the time consumed, even if is not as much as making puff pastry, is still a NONO for me. \n\nIf you want to make it homemade I'm sure you can find recipes online for it, as they will be better than mine since I didn't made any in a long time. I refuse to make home-made pie dough and puff pastry.\n\nFirst is gonna be a nice Strawberry-Peach-Pineapple jam :\n\n350gr strawberries, 320gr peach, 150gr pineapple, 180gr sugar, 15gr vanilla sugar and vanilla essence, 20gr cornstarch.\n\nJust add all the fruits together in a pan, along with the sugar on low-medium heat and let them cook until they're super soft (between 10-20 minutes). Smash them with whatever you find at home, and add your cornstarch. I mixed mine with enough water to form a paste first. \n\nCook for another 5 minutes and you're set. I personally found this to be a little sweet (I used canned peach and pineapple) and those already had more sugar added to them.\n\nIf you used canned like mine, I think 100gr of sugar will be better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple pie filling. 470gr apples, 100gr sugar, 1 tbsp. cinnamon (you can use less), 10gr vanilla sugar, 25gr butter, 10gr cornstarch.\n\nNow I don't want to smash these. Cook them for around 15 minutes or so, add the cornstarch, cook for another 5 minute and that's it. I didn't smash these because I wanted to feel the apples when I bite into them.\n\nAfter you make these, let them cool down a bit, and cut your pie dough in the shapes you want. Add the filling in the middle, don't overfill, and let the sides empty so you can seal them. \n\nEgg wash, and cook at 190 degree Celsius for around 20 minutes. Just look after them after 15 minutes, because you only need to cook the pie crust. And when you get a nice brown color on them, they're done.\n\nNow Icing. If you want to put icing on them, you just mix fine powder sugar with very little water.\n\nTake like 100gr of fine powder sugar and mix with a teaspoon of water.

{"title": "Schupfnudeln! My new favourite way to eat potatoes! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "My new favourite way to eat potatoes! Schupfnudeln, also known as fingernudel, are beautiful and delicate potato dumplings pan fried in butter and sage! This schupfnudeln recipe only requires 4 ingredients, most of which you probably already have at hand!\n\nSchupfnudeln are a specialty from the Baden region of southern Germany and are also popular in Austrian cuisine! These potato dumplings are similar to the Central European kopytka, or Italian gnocchi!\n\nIf you\u2019re a visual learner, check out my video recipe here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmrNYAVRwRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmrNYAVRwRU)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n750g potatoes  \n1 egg  \n200g flour  \na good grating of nutmeg  \n2 tbsp. butter  \n12 sage leaves (5 whole, 5 chopped)  \n3 tsp. salt  \n\n\n**Serves:** 2 people as a main, 4 people as a side\n\n\\-----  \n**Method**  \n\n\n1. Add 750g potatoes to a large pot of cold water. Add a generous amount of salt to the water and cook at maximum heat for 35-40 minutes. No need to peel or chop just yet!\n2. Once a knife goes into a potato smoothly \u2013 and/or the potato skins are beginning to split \u2013 drain your potatoes. Place the colander over the pot you cooked them in; any excess steam will help dry the potatoes! Let them cool to the point where you can handle the potatoes and then peel the skins. A knife works really well and the skins should come off easily.\n3. For the best results, use a potato ricer to mash your potatoes. However you can use a potato masher too! Create a little well in the middle of your mashed potato. Grate a good amount of nutmeg (nutmeg is the key ingredient!), salt generously and add a lightly whisked egg into the well.\n4. Bring the mixture together with your hands, almost as if you\u2019re kneading bread! Add a few tablespoons of flour at a time and continue kneading. Add flour as you need \u2013 up to around 200grams. Once the dough forms a smooth ball and does not stick to your counter, it\u2019s done! Be sure not to over-knead the dough.\n5. Fill a large pot of water and bring it up to a boil on maximum heat. Dust a baking tray with flour, which will prevent your schupfnudeln from sticking! Cut off a quarter of your dough and start rolling it into a log. Your potato log should around \u00bd - 1 inch thick. Now slice your log into 1 inch pieces!\n6. Now for the \u2018schupf\u2019! Start by rolling each potato piece into a small ball, and then gently rub your hands back and forth to create a \u2018baguette\u2019 shape! Place your schupfnudeln onto your dusted baking tray. I like to shake my baking tray back and forth to ensure each schupfnudeln is covered in flour, so they don\u2019t stick together!\n7. Now generously salt your boiling water. Drop your schupfnudeln into the water. Stir gently with a slotted spoon. Once they float to the top, they\u2019re ready to come out! This usually takes around 2-3 minutes. Place onto a clean tea towel to dry.\n8. Now for the sauce! Pick 5 sage leaves and set aside. Slice a further 5 sage leaves. To a hot frying pan, add 2 tbsp. butter and 2 whole sage leaves. Your schupfnudeln should now be dry. Once your butter is bubbling, add your sliced sage leaves and your schupfnudeln!\n9. Once the schupfnudeln begin to brown on one side, use tongs to turn them gently, until golden all over. \n10. Serve and enjoy!!    \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, please do feel free to ask below! I hope you enjoy this dish as much as I do!

{"title": "Spaghetti and Meatballs with Roasted Pepper Sauce!", "selftext": "Some spaghetti and meatballs but with Roasted Pepper Sauce\n\nI know this is a classic but I wanted a different sauce for it, and I just love red bell pepper sauce. I couldn't find red bell peppers so I used Kapia Peppers. They do fine, but you should taste them and be sure that they are sweet. The peppers can make the sauce delicious or bitter.\n\nAnyway I have a written recipe and a [Video Recipe](https://youtu.be/VBlNWoNhmWY)  :\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor Meatballs we gonna use : \n\n*  200-220ml milk, 100gr breadcrumbs and mix them in a bowl.\n*  850gr Ground chicken (you can use other type of meat if you like to), fresh parsley to taste.\n*  1/2tbsp basil, oregano, garlic powder, black pepper, salt.\n*  1tbsp onion powder\n*  1tsp chili powder\n\nMaking the meatballs is mixing everything together in a bowl, and at the end add the breadcrumb mixture and mix it very well so everything combines nicely. Form 40-50gr meatballs and cook them at 180\u00b0C  for around 35-40 minutes fan OFF.\n\nFor Sauce : \n\n*  150gr onion\n*  380gr red bell peppers/kapia peppers\n*  6 garlic cloves\n*  1tsp sugar, smoked paprika, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper\n*  500ml tomato sauce\n*  100ml water\n* (If you want it more creamy, you can add some heavy cream when you simmer it)\n\nYou want to clean and remove the seeds and the white part of your peppers. Cut the onion in 4. Add them together in a baking pan, and in the oven it goes at 180\u00b0C  for around 30 minutes. I had mine along with the meatballs. After they're done, you want a blender. Put everything in the blender, and blend it until smooth. Taste it a little and see if it needs more salt or other spices. Transfer it to a pot, and let it simmer for around 15-20 minutes, mixing occasionally.\n\nNow...I think everyone knows to boil pasta. The way I do it, is to let the water boil with some salt in it, and when it boils I add my pasta to it and let the cook for around 8-10 minutes. I used whole wheat pasta. After the sauce is done, add some of your pasta to it and some meatballs. Mix them around to coat them and serve them with some nice mature cheddar. You can use other kind of cheese. \n\nThe amount of sauce is good for 200-250grams of spaghetti. This is before I boiled them. So keep that in mind. But you can store the sauce in the fridge covered for a few days. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you gonna enjoy it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/md4ob1/spaghetti_and_meatballs_with_roasted_pepper_sauce/", "created_utc": 1616696199.0, "score": 125, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/md4ob1/spaghetti_and_meatballs_with_roasted_pepper_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

I've been eating Eggs in purgatory for years; it's my go-to quick dish! I know you're going to love it, so give it a go!\n\n**If you're a visual learner, feel free to watch my recipe video here!** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTfqvA5mt24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTfqvA5mt24)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 eggs\n* 4 garlic cloves (2 for the toast!)\n* 1 tin of tomatoes\n* 1/4 white onion, chopped into cubes\n* 1 tbsp. thyme (or oregano)\n* 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar\n* approx. 100g mozzarella cheese, grated or cubed\n* a good squeeze of tomato paste\n* a few pinches of salt\n* olive oil, for cooking\n* good quality bread, for dipping!\n\n**Serves: 2 people**\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Peel and thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat and add in a few tablespoons of olive oil. Once your oil has started to sizzle, add in one quarter of a white onion, chopped into cubes. As soon as the onions begin browning, add in your sliced garlic.\n2. Add in 1 tbsp. dried thyme. I normally add oregano rather than thyme, but unfortunately I ran out of oregano \u2013 and my local supermarket was out of stock too!\n3. Once both the onions and garlic are picking up colour, add in 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar and a good squeeze (a couple of tablespoons) of tomato paste. Give this a good stir until the paste breaks down into the onions.\n4. Add in 1 can of tomatoes. You can use any canned tomato, but I\u2019m using chopped/diced tomatoes. I also like to add in 1/3 of the can of water, just to loosen up the sauce!\n5. Set your pan to medium-low heat, cover your pan with a lid (if possible) and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.\n6. Add a few pinches of salt and taste your sauce to ensure it\u2019s seasoned to your liking! Feel free to add black pepper if you wish! Let it cook with the lid off for just a few more minutes.\n7. Turn the heat back up to medium and drop in 4 eggs - and maybe not traditional, but I love to add in 100g mozzarella cheese, grated or cubed!\n8. Pop your lid back on and cook until your eggs are done to your preference. Mine took around 10-15 minutes on an electric stove, but if you\u2019re using gas, your cooking time will reduce.\n9. Let\u2019s toast up our bread! Place a frying pan on medium-high heat and drizzle in some olive oil. Place your bread into your pan and swish them around, allowing them to soak up some of that oil. Once they\u2019re nicely toasted, flip and toast the other side.\n10. Once done, pull your toast out and rub a peeled garlic clove across the top of your bread!

Remove the first ring of lobster armor completely, and then gently work the split open exposing the meat. \n3. Take your fingers and carefully run them along the inside of the shell detaching the meat from the exoskeleton, until you can pull the meat out from the tail resting it atop the shell. (There should be a piece still attached way in the back that you more than likely can't get to with your fingers. That's fine)\n4. Once the meat is sitting over the shell. Brush with olive oil. \n5. To create your basting sauce, melt 1/2 stick of butter in a small bowl. \n6. Add the juice and zest of 1 lemon\n7. Add 4 minced cloves of garlic and then mix well. \n8. Place your lobster tails, shell down, on to a grill or smoker set at 350 degrees (F), with no open flames beneath the tails. \n9. Immediately begin basting with sauce, being careful not to drip too much onto the coals beneath. This will cause flare ups which could overcook/burn your tails. \n10. Continue to baste and cook the lobster tails until the shells turn red, the meat turns white and opaque, and the texture turns firm to a poke test. (Typical time frame 5 minutes cooking over coals at 350 degrees)\n11. Once you see those signs quickly remove from the grill and take back inside for plating. \n12. I then brush the remainder of the basting sauce over the meat and  salt & pepper to taste. \n13. For garnish I typically mince parsley and sprinkle over the meat which is a nice pop of color. You can also nestle the finished tails onto a serving platter covered in parsley, so they're sitting on a bed of green. \n14. Serve and Enjoy! \n\nLet me know if you try the recipe out or give it any tweaks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/idf1vy/grilled_lobster_tails_how_to_grill_perfect/", "created_utc": 1597945605.0, "score": 118, "author": "OutdoorIndoorTexan", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/idf1vy/grilled_lobster_tails_how_to_grill_perfect/", "html_title": ""}

You can store this in the fridge and then transfer it to the pipping bag once the cake is at room temperature to decorate, or my advice would be that after your cake gets at room temp, and still in the baking pan, make the ganache and put everything on top. You will get more chocolate on top than I had. I kept a little of that ganache to put it on top of slices when I eat it.\n\nYou can use a strawberry sauce on top too. It works well but it depends on you.\n\nAlso you can change the white chocolate for the ganache to dark or milk chocolate.

{"title": "How To Make Chicken Egg Drop Soup", "selftext": "[https://youtu.be/S9eeHGns8sk](https://youtu.be/S9eeHGns8sk)\n\nLearning how to make Chicken Egg Drop Soup will equip you with the secrets for a fast healthy & easy Chinese recipe perfect for rainy days. The best part is it only requires ingredients that are already in your pantry.  \n\nYou will need: \n\n2 Eggs   \n1 Spring Onion (or Green Onion)   \n2 Cups of Chicken Stock (Psst, you can swop the Chicken Stock to a Vegetable Stock to make this recipe suitable for Vegetarians!)   \n1.5 Tbsp of Corn Starch (or Corn Flour)   \n1/4 Tsp of White Pepper   \n1/2 Tsp of Salt (Make sure to taste your Chicken Stock. If the Chicken Stock is already well seasoned, you may omit the extra Salt)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo make this Egg Drop Soup:  \n\n1) Crack 2 Eggs into a large bowl and whisk until the egg yolks and egg whites are well combined.    \n\n\n2) Finely slice your Spring Onion. You will notice that the Spring Onion starts off white at its roots and gradually becomes green. Separate the white parts and the green parts of the Spring Onion and set aside. In general, the white parts of the Spring Onion are more pungent and can be cooked for a period of time to extract its flavour. The green parts of the Spring Onion however tend to be milder in flavor and is usually used as a garnish at the end to preserve its flavor.    \n\n\n3) Prepare 2 cups of Chicken Stock. This is the most important ingredient in this recipe and homemade Chicken Stock is always preferable. In a pinch, store bought packets or stock cubes are still acceptable given the convenience though the flavor will be compromised.  \n\n4) Combine 1.5 Tbsp of Corn Starch with 1.5 Tbsp of the Chicken Stock that you have prepared. Mix well until you get a white and milky mixture (also known as a slurry).  \n\n5) Bring the Chicken Stock up to a boil.   \n\n6) Once the Chicken Stock is boiling, add the white parts of the Spring Onion and the Corn Starch mixture. Stir continuously until the soup comes back up to a boil.  \n\n7) As the soup comes back up to a boil and thickens, continue stirring the soup in one uniform and circular direction to create a vortex.  \n\n8) Pour the egg mixture slowly into the pot as you continue stirring. Your eggs will start forming beautiful silky strands almost instantly.   \n\n9) Take your Egg Drop Soup off the heat and season with 1/4 Tsp of White Pepper and 1/2 Tsp of Salt (make sure you taste the soup first before adding the Salt. If your Chicken Stock was already very well-seasoned, you may omit the extra Salt).  \n\n10) The Egg Drop Soup is ready!

{"title": "\"Masala Vada\"- a crispy, very flavorful and additive in taste fritters made from chana dal and spices is a MUST have dish!", "selftext": "Masala Vada, a crispy and savory deep fried fritter made from chana dal and spices, is a popular street food. Process for making chana dal vada is very simple and takes very less time except for the time required for soaking the chana dal. Serve it as an evening snack with tea/coffee or with green chutney and tomato ketchup. It can also be served as a side dish with south Indian meal.\n\nCLICK [HERE](https://youtu.be/OxxO5Td226g) for step-by-step video recipe.\n\nIngredients:\n\n\u2022 Oil for frying\n\n\u2022 Green Chilli (Finely Chopped) - 2\n\n\u2022 Cilantro/Coriander (Finely Chopped) - 2 to 3 tbsp\n\n\u2022 Salt to taste\n\n\u2022 Curry Leaves (Finely Chopped) - 1 t\n\n\u2022 Hing/Asafoetida - Pinch\n\n\u2022 Ginger (Finely Chopped) - 1/2 Inch\n\n\u2022 Onion (Finely Chopped) - 1 Small\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Grinding:\n\n\u2022 Chana Dal/Bengal Gram - 1 cup\n\n\u2022 Dried Red Chilli - 1\n\n\u2022 Garlic (Chopped) -  5 to 6 Cloves\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Wash and soak chana dal in water for 2 hours. Transfer soaked dal to a colander and drain the water.\n\n2. Transfer drained dal to the small jar of a mixer grinder.\n\n3. To it add dried red chilli & garlic cloves.\n\n4. Grind until medium coarse texture. If required, scrape the sides and grind the mixture again. It should be okay if a few whole dal remains (this would give a nice chunky texture to vada).\n\n5. Transfer it to a medium bowl. Add finely chopped onion, green chilli, ginger, curry leaves, coriander leaves and salt.\n\n6. Mix all ingredients well. Mixture should not be very moist or dry. If the mixture is too crumbly and it\u2019s difficult to make vadas from it, then grind 1/4 cup mixture again until smooth and mix with the remaining mixture. If the mixture is too moist and it\u2019s hard to shape vadas, add 2-3 teaspoons of rice flour or gram flour in the mixture.\n\n7. Refrigerate the mixture for 15 - 20 minutes. This makes crispy vadas. This step is optional. Cooking immediately tastes good too!\n\n8. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium flame. When oil is medium hot, slide 2-3 vadas in oil from the side of pan and deep fry them until golden brown and crispy.\n\n9. Transfer them to a plate on paper napkin. Deep-fry remaining vadas. Masala Vadas are ready to serve.\n\nServe it with tea/coffee or with green chutney and tomato ketchup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTips:\n\n1. Don\u2019t add water while grinding the dal.\n\n2. Do not deep-fry vadas on high flame otherwise they will turn dark brown fast and remains uncooked from inside.\n\n3. Place mixture in refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before making vadas in step-5. This would make crispier masala vada.\n\n4. If you add water, then it becomes difficult to shape the chana dal vada. If you are not able to blend at all, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and then blend.\n\n5.

Stir the eggs.\n\nNow add half of a teaspoon honey to it and stir again.\n\nAfter stiring for a second time add a little bit of milk to it. (This will prevent the omelette to stick on the pan and you can easily move it around)\n\nStir again and add some salt and pepper to it.\n\nLast time stiring now.\n\nStep 3:\n\nHeat up a pan with lots of olive oil. (The whole pan should be covered with oil)\n\nAfter the oil is heaten up enough add the vegetables first, because sucuk cooks really fast.\n\nStep 4:\n\nAfter the vegetables look good to you add the sucuk sausage to the pan. After 1 minute should be ready to flip the sausage around. After another minute you can add the eggs you mixed.\n\nStep 5:\n\nThe omelette should take about 4 minutes on medium heat. Depending what you use (gas, electric, etc)\n\nAt the end you can add some oregano to the omelette.\n\n\nDisclaimer: You can also cook sucuk without any oil. The sausage itself is full of fat and can be used for fatting the pan.\n\nI had a discussion about this with my syrian friend. He said it is better to cook it with olive oil and i said it\u2019s not necessary. He proofed me wrong, because it tastes so much better with olive oil.\n\n\nAnyways, hope you like my recipe!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/nifqdp/turkish_garlic_sausage_sucuk_with_egg/", "created_utc": 1621679455.0, "score": 103, "author": "dpanther93", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/nifqdp/turkish_garlic_sausage_sucuk_with_egg/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "3-ingredient Chicken Corn Soup!", "selftext": "  \nRecipe + Video [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqKMnu6WYoI)  \nIngredients: ONLY 3 MAIN INGREDIENTS   \n1. Chicken breast:  1.5 lb (2 small or 1 large, we used tenders)   \n2. Sweet corn, cream style: 1, 14-oz can   \n3. Garlic cloves: 4-5 \n\nAdditionally you will need   \n4 cups water   \n1 tsp salt (or to taste)  \n1 tsp black pepper (or to taste) \n\nDirections:\n\n1. In a pot, add chicken breast pieces and 4 cups of water. Cover, and bring to a boil on medium high heat. \n\n2. Once it comes to a boil, uncover and let it simmer for 10 minutes. Using a spoon, clear off any foam you see gathering on the top.  \n\n3. After 10 minutes, turn off the stove off. Remove the pieces of chicken and shred. \n\n4. Return shredded chicken to the broth along with 4-5 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. Turn the stove on to medium high. With the lid slightly ajar, let this simmer for 10 minutes. \n\n5. After 10 minutes, add 1 can of cream style corn. Adjust salt and pepper per taste. Let this simmer with the lid slightly ajar for 15 minutes. \n\nQuick, simple, easy chicken corn soup is ready!  \n\nOptional: Garnish with some soy sauce, sesame oil, crunchy Chinese noodles, and enjoy! It is also good all on its own without any of these additions. \n\nNotes/Tips:\n\n1. We prefer not to add cornstarch to get the slightly thicker texture you classically see in chicken corn soup. The soup is pretty hearty already with all the chicken and corn. But, if that's how you prefer to have it, it's an easy addition--making it a 4-ingredient chicken corn soup. Simply add 1-2 tsp cornstarch to 1-2 tbsp water, and add it in based on preferred thickness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/l2am0p/3ingredient_chicken_corn_soup/", "created_utc": 1611271621.0, "score": 107, "author": "Stamha", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/l2am0p/3ingredient_chicken_corn_soup/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Easy and tasty Indian potato-cashew-curry recipe and Naan bread", "selftext": "Today I want to share an amazing Indian potato and cashew curry recipe and the accommodating naan recipe as well. The recipe is easy but requires some specific spices. \n\nServes about 4 people and takes about 45 minutes.\n\nI also made a [Video](https://youtu.be/vjWvnCBM-54) if you like a visual comparison or guide. \n\nI\u00b4ll split the recipe into 2 parts the curry and the naan. \n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the curry\n\n4 medium sized potatoes\n\n1 large onion\n\n200ml of milk / a cup\n\n125gramms of cr\u00e8me fraiche / half a cup\n\n2 tablespoons of unseasoned cashew nuts\n\n1 teaspoon of chili powder\n\n2 teaspoons o smoked paprika\n\n3/4 of a teaspoon of ground coriander and cumin\n\n2 teaspoons of garam Masala\n\n1 teaspoon of salt\n\nA clove of garlic can be subsidized 1 teaspoon of garlic\n\nA piece of ginger can be subsidized1 teaspoon ginger powder\n\nFirst we got to cook the potatoes so we wash them to get rid of any remaining dirt and then put them into a pot without water, then we fill the pot until the potatoes are submerged in the water after the pot is filled with water we can put it onto the stove at high to medium heat at the beginning which you can turn down once the water is boiling.\n\nBefore we proceed with the onion we can add together all the spices we need later in a small bowl. Mix the chili powder, the smoked paprika, the coriander, the cumin, the garam masala, the salt, and if you chose garlic and ginger powder than those as well. \n\nOnce we took care of the spices we can start with the onion. First we cut away the opposite side of the root and then we halve the onion. Now we got to remove the most other shell of both onion halves. Now we can cut the halves vertically 5-6 times towards the root and then 1 more cut horizontally. Make sure to not cut into the root of the onion to keep the stability that the root provides. Now slice the onion really thin. \n\nAfter we\u00b4ve cut the onion we can put another pot onto the stove in which we will make the curry. Add some vegetable oil to the pot and set the plate to medium heat. Once the oil is hot add the onions to the pot and let them get glassy. \n\nIn the meantime, if you chose to use a garlic clove and a ginger piece. Remove the shell of the clove and cut it into small bits. Peel the ginger and cut it up as well. Otherwise proceed straight with crushing and chopping the cashew nuts. Once crushed add them to the spice bowl. \n\nWhen the onion turns glassy we can add the spices, the crushed cashews and the garlic and ginger. Let it fry for a short while as you constantly stir it, so the spices don\u2019t get burned. Now add half of the milk, let it boil and simmer for a short while. If you want a homogenous curry you can blend everything in the pot now, with a hand blender, but be very very careful there is a high risk of splatter. Whatever you chose after that we can add the cr\u00e8me fraiche and the rest of the milk while constantly stirring. Bring it to a boil and then let is simmer on low heat.\n\nLastly we got to take care of the boiled potatoes. You can check those by piercing them with a fork or any other spikey utensil if they have almost no resistance while piercing they are done. Take the pot of the stove and drain the water. Now we can wait a little bit to let the potatoes cool. Add them to the curry or pour the curry over them on the plate. your choice. and with that we are finished with the curry. enjoy. \n\nNow onwards to the naan bread. \n\nIngredients:\n\n150 grams of flour / \u00be of a cup \n\nhalf a teaspoon of baking soda\n\nhalf a teaspoon of sugar \n\nhalf a teaspoon of salt \n\n50ml of milk / \u00bc of a cup\n\n3 tablespoons of butter or 25grams / an ounce\n\n65 grams of yogurt / \u00bc of a cup\n\nFirst we got to mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl, the flour, the baking soda, the sugar, and the salt. After that we got to melt the butter you can do that in a microwave but be sure to cut the piece of butter into small bits, so they don\u2019t pop while they get heated. We let the butter cool and add it to a separate bowl with the milk and the yogurt once added we got to mix them together. After that we can add them to the dry ingredients. Once everything is in one bowl we must mix it and knead it thoroughly until we get a nice homogenous clump of dough. Let the dough rest for at least half an hour underneath the bowl. \n\nAfter the dough is finished with resting we can sever it into 4 equally sized pieces. Those pieces we got to roll out thin about 2 mm thick we strive to achieve a round shape for the pan. Put a suitable sized pan on the stove at medium heat and add some butter or vegetable oil try to spread it before adding the rolled-out dough. Once the dough is added we just got to wait until there are bubble rising on the surface of the dough. than flip it around and give it about the same time. once both sides are partially browned the naan is finished and we can enjoy a really nice Indian curry and homemade naan bread. Enjoy.\n\nTime Calculations\n\n30minutes naan rising / 25-30 minutes potato boiling\n\nCan be done in the meantime.\n\nCutting the onion 3min \n\nMixing the spices 1min\n\nFrying the onion 3min / crushing the cashew nuts\n\nBoiling and simmering 10min 1. time 3min 2. Time 7min\n\nOnly Possible after!\n\nPeeling potatoes 5-10min\n\nRolling the Naan 5min \n\nFrying the naan 2-3min each side, 4 naans = 8 sides = 16-24min depending on the frying speed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/xaptj7/easy_and_tasty_indian_potatocashewcurry_recipe/", "created_utc": 1662817563.0, "score": 103, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/xaptj7/easy_and_tasty_indian_potatocashewcurry_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Combine the Brown Sugar and Cinnamon Powder. Mix well and sprinkle evenly over a wide and shallow dish\n2. Crack the Eggs into the dish and whisk well. Try your best to make sure that the Egg Whites and Egg Yolks are combined.\u00a0\n3. Add the Vanilla Essence to the Milk and add the mixture to the dish. Mix everything well and make sure that the Brown Sugar is dissolved into the Egg Mixture. The reason why I add the Milk mixture after whisking my eggs is to give the Brown Sugar a better chance to dissolve properly if your Milk came straight from the fridge and is not room temperature.\u00a0\n4. Heat your pan on medium-low and add some Butter. Let the Butter heat up gently.\n5. Dunk a slice of Bread into the Egg mixture briefly on both sides. Make sure both sides are well coated. As you lift the Bread, drain off the excess Egg mixture and gently lay the Bread over the Butter that has been heating up in the pan.\n6. Gently fry the Bread for around 2 minutes on each side. The key is to go low and slow so that you can build up a nice caramelised crust on the outside without burning the Bread.\n7. Once both sides are cooked, take the French Toast out of the pan and set aside.\n8. Repeat the above process until all the Bread has been cooked.\u00a0\n9.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling for 13 by 9-inch baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of aluminum foil; first sheet should be 13 inches wide and second sheet should be 9 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Lightly spray foil with vegetable oil spray.\n2. Pulse walnuts in food processor until finely chopped, 8 to 10 pulses. Spread walnuts, oats, and sunflower seeds on rimmed baking sheet and toast until lightly browned and fragrant, 12 to 15 minutes, stirring halfway through toasting. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.\n3. While oat mixture is toasting, process apricots, sugar, and salt in food processor until apricots are very finely ground, about 15 seconds. With processor running, add oil and water. Continue to process until homogeneous paste forms, about 1 minute longer. Transfer paste to large, wide bowl.\n4. Add warm oat mixture to bowl and stir with rubber spatula until well coated. Add cereal and cranberries and stir gently until ingredients are evenly mixed. Transfer mixture to prepared pan and spread into even layer. Place 14-inch sheet of parchment or waxed paper on top of granola and press and smooth very firmly with your hands, especially at edges and corners, until granola is level and compact. Remove parchment and bake granola until fragrant and just beginning to brown around edges, about 25 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack and let cool for 1 hour. Using foil overhang, lift granola out of pan. Return to wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour.\n5. Discard foil and transfer granola to cutting board. Using chef's knife, cut granola in half crosswise to create two 6\u00bd by 9-inch rectangles. Cut each rectangle in half to make four 3\u00bc by 9-inch strips. Cut each strip crosswise into 6 equal pieces.

{"title": "My Nonna's Stuffed Shells | Conchiglioni with Ricotta and Spinach! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "Stuffed shells are a favourite in Italian homes for Sunday lunch! I used to make this pasta dish with my Nonna all the time! It's cheesy, creamy, comforting and so easy to make! Everyone in Italy loves these stuffed shells, and your family will too!\n\nLet me show you how to make a quick, easy and rich tomato sauce, a creamy spinach and ricotta filling, and how to fill your giant conchiglioni pasta shells! We then bring all these elements together, bake for a few minutes, and the result is one of the most amazing pasta dishes you've ever devoured!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, feel free to check out my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzCcX1UqXBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzCcX1UqXBY)  \n\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n500g conchiglioni pasta shells\n\n**Sauce:**  \n1 jar (700ml) passata  \n3 tbsp. olive oil  \n3 garlic cloves  \n2 tbsp. tomato paste  \nsugar to taste (optional)  \nsalt to taste (optional)  \n\n\n**Stuffing:**  \n100g parmesan cheese, grated  \n100g mozzarella cheese, grated  \n500g ricotta cheese  \n300g frozen spinach, thawed  \n2 eggs  \na good grating of nutmeg  \nsalt (to taste, optional)  \n\n\n**Topping:**  \n150g mozzarella cheese, grated  \n50g parmesan cheese, grated  \n\n\n\\-----  \n\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with a simple tomato sauce! In a saucepan heat 3 tbsp. olive oil and 2 tbsp. tomato paste. Cook those together until the tomato paste starts to melt into the olive oil and begins caramelising. Add 3 cloves of lightly crushed garlic, one 700ml jar of passata and season with salt. Let it slowly reduce on medium/low heat for around 25-30 minutes.\n\n2. Cook your 500g conchiglioni pasta in a pot of boiling water. Remember to add generous amounts of salt to your water! Cook your pasta just a few minutes less than instructed on the packet. Mine called for 14 minutes, so I cooked them for 12 minutes. When the timer goes off, drain your pasta and rinse them under cold water.\n\n3. Remove the garlic cloves from your tomato sauce. Give your sauce a taste and season accordingly. If your tomato sauce is a bit too bitter to tart, add some sugar to help balance it!\n\n4. Now to prepare your 300g thawed spinach! Squeeze your spinach to remove as much water as possible. I like to place my spinach in a clean tea towel, bring the edges of the tea towel up and together, then twist the ball of spinach to help remove any moisture. Once done, roughly chop your spinach into smaller pieces.\n\n5. Onto the filling! Into a bowl, add 500g ricotta cheese, one grated garlic clove, 100g grated parmesan, 100g grated mozzarella, the spinach you\u2019ve drained and chopped up, and a healthy grating of nutmeg! Give this a good mix together and season to taste. To finish, add 2 eggs and mix well!\n\n6. Preheat your oven to 190C | 375F. \n\n7. Pour some of your sauce into a 20cm x 30cm pan. You want around 1cm sauce in the bottom. Take one of your conchiglioni pasta shells and use a tablespoon to stuff it with your filling! Once the shell is full, place it in the sauce \\*filling side up\\*. Do the same with the remaining shells - until you run out of filling \u2013 or shells!\n\n8. Pour your remaining sauce over your shells and then top with 150g mozzarella and 50g parmesan.\n\n9. Bake for 25-30 minutes \u2013 or until it\u2019s bubbling up and the cheese topping is lovely and golden!\n\n10. Serve and enjoy!  \n\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, please feel free to ask me in the comments below! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b  \n\n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki \u2013 Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/tz6ch5/my_nonnas_stuffed_shells_conchiglioni_with/", "created_utc": 1649432446.0, "score": 97, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/tz6ch5/my_nonnas_stuffed_shells_conchiglioni_with/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Break eggs into a bowl. To it add some salt and pepper. \n\n2. Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs briskly for 30-60 seconds, making sure the eggs are fully broken up and mixed well with the seasonings. \n\n3. Lightly grease your hot skillet/non-stick pan, coating the surface with a thin layer of oil.\n\n4. On medium flame, pour the eggs into the skillet.\n\n5. Move the spatula around the edge of the skillet, pulling the cooked edges towards the center. Cooked scrambled eggs will gather in the center of the skillet.\n\n6. When fully cooked, using spatula break the scrambled eggs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 2: Cook Rice\n\n1. Soak 1 cup rice for 10 to 20 mins. If you are a large family, you can make more rice(upto 3 cups) following the same method. Add rice to a large bowl. I have used 3 cups long grain basmati rice. You can also use any long grain or medium grain like Jasmine rice, Sona masoori.\n\n2. Meanwhile pour about 10 cups of water for 3 cups of rice to a large pot and bring it to a rolling boil on a medium high flame. When the water begins to boil add the rice\n\n3. Add 1 tablespoon salt to the boiling water. Add rice.\n\n4. Keep checking so you don\u2019t overcook. This only takes a few minutes. Cook the rice and not mushy. Grains must be separated yet fully cooked.\n\n5. Quickly drain the rice to a colander. Cool it until all of the steam vanishes. Fluff it up with a fork. If the rice is perfect you can cover and set aside. This prevents the rice from drying & becoming hard.\n\n6. When completely cooled add \u00bd tablespoon of Vinegar to rice. Mix well. Leave in the fridge for 10 mins. This is optional. Doing so will give rice a good texture that best suits for Chinese fried rice\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStep 3: Fried Rice\n\n1. Heat oil in a wok or pan on the highest flame. Add green onion bulbs, carrots & green peas.\n\n2. Saute for 2-3 mins.\n\n3. Add the cooked rice. Mix well.\n\n4. To it add, soy sauce & vinegar.

{"title": "Lava Cake!", "selftext": "Lava Cake! So first of all I'm not a huge fan of dark chocolate desserts. But I don't know, I really like this one, especially the \nway I make it since is more sweet, but you can adjust things to make it to your taste.\n\n[Video Recipe](https://youtu.be/kshYDHh7kog)\n\nIngredients: \n\n - 50gr flour\n - 70gr sugar\n - 85gr butter\n - 4 eggs\n - 170gr chocolate (Half milk half 50% dark) \n - Vanilla extract\n\nFor the middle ganache we gonna use \n\n - 135ml heavy cream\n - 105gr chocolate again a mix.\n\nSo you can adjust your chocolate to your tasting. Use only dark chocolate and use whatever percentage of it you want. As I said I'm not a fan of dark chocolate so I used milk + 50% dark. \n\nAnyway I start with the ganache. Put the heavy cream in a pan, and put it on medium heat. When it starts to bubble or gets hot enough remove it from heat, and add your chocolate in smaller pieces to it.\nLet it sit for 20-30 seconds then start to mix around with a spatula and it should melt easy. I hate doing bain-marie and I think this is way easier. Transfer it to a bowl and in the freezer it goes for at least 2 hours.\n\nNow to make the cake part of the lava cakes, chop the chocolate in smaller pieces. \nMelt the butter in a pan, remove it form heat and add that chocolate to it. Let it sit a few seconds and mix with spatula to help it melt and combine.\nIn another bowl, have 4 eggs and use a hand mixer to beat them until fluffy. Around 2-3 minutes. Add a pinch of salt, vanilla extract, sugar and mix again.\nNow when the melted chocolate is not hot anymore, add the eggs over it and fold until it combines. \n\nUse ramekins to make the lava cake. I tried using muffin pans but it doesn't work really well because those are too small.\nThis mixture should give you like 4 lava cakes. I use butter to spread on the ramekins and parchment paper on the base.\nYou have to use half of the mixture you have to pour into 4 ramekins, then take your ganache out of the freezer and form some balls. \nThese should go right into the middle. Then use the rest of the mixture to cover them. So be careful of how big or small are the balls you make.\nI personally just used a teaspoon of chocolate in the middle and it was just very cold but not near to be frozen. \n\nCook them at 190 degree Celsius for 15 minutes. Let them sit 1 minute before removing them from ramekins, and make sure these don't have any stuck edges.\nI served mine with some ice-cream and powdered sugar.\n\nYou can server yours with cocoa powder, chocolate, caramel, strawberry/raspberry sauce and so on. Make the best out of it and enjoy!\nDon't forget to add the chocolate you love. \n\nI prefer this lava cake over the one that you have to underbake.

Cut everything in bite size pieces and the onion should be cut in thin slices. In a bowl we're gonna toss the chicken, with 1tbsp cornstarch and 1 egg. Mix it well and be sure the egg/cornstarch mixture coat the chicken really well in there.\n\nTake a pan, medium heat, and when the oil gets hot we deep fry the chicken. Take it piece by piece out of the bowl, and don't overcrowd your pan. When it gets crisp and that nice golden color it should be done. While the chicken is cooking, let's make the sauce. Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, and you could also add some sesame seeds in it.\n\nAfter that's done, take another pan, add 1-2 tablespoon of oil, add the veggies at medium heat and let the cook until you get brown spots of color on them. Mix from time to time. When the veggies are cooked, add the chicken and the pineapple. Mix for a few seconds, and add your sauce. Cook everything for around 2 more minutes and that's it.\n\nServe it with some rice and enjoy! \n\nThe sugar and ketchup will add the sweet taste, the vinegar will give you that sour taste and soy sauce the salt needed.

This is something I make often because I tend to always have the ingredients on hand. It\u2019s super hearty and great for cold winter nights. This can easily be made vegetarian by using veggie stock and omitting the meat. I am sure it can be made vegan with dairy substitutes too. It makes a TON, I eat off of it for days.\n(I am new to Reddit so please forgive me if I haven\u2019t done this correctly!)\n\nINGREDIENTS\n* 5TBSP. of salted butter\n* 1lb ground beef (optional)\n* One large Hungarian wax pepper or banana pepper, diced up very small\n* 2 cups white onions, diced\n* 2lb Cremini and white mushrooms (I\u2019ve also used baby bella before) stems removed and chopped up \n* 1 heaping TBSP dried dill weed (maybe an extra Tsp if you\u2019re like me and love dill) If possible grind in a mortar and pestle but not necessary. \n* 2 Tsp dried thyme (also grind)\n* 2 Tsp dried mushroom powder (I used Trader Joe\u2019s mushroom Umami seasoning)\n* 1 TBSP.

Lemon juice\n* 1 tsp cayenne pepper\n* 3 or 4 garlic cloves mashed in a garlic press or diced as small as possible\n* 4 cups Beef Stock (I\u2019ve also used chicken and veggie stock before)\n* 2 TBSP. low sodium soy sauce\n* 2 tsp maggi w\u00fcrze seasoning (optional but oh so good, I also add some after serving)\n* 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce\n* 4 TBSP. all-purpose flour (use 3TBSP if you prefer thinner soup)\n* 1/2 cup half and half\n* 1/2 Cup whole milk\n* 1 cup room temp. sour cream\n* Egg noodles, the kind you use for stroganoff but it\u2019s optional (If you don\u2019t use noodles cut stock down to about 2 cups). I used half a 16oz bag and you cook it directly in the soup). Rice is also good too. \n* salt and pepper to taste \n\nSteps:\n\n1.) Brown the meat (and drain if needed) add butter garlic and onions, and saut\u00e9 for like six minutes then add the pepper, and mushrooms in the buttery mix over Low/Medium heat for 10 mins. Then add the dry seasonings and let it cook for ten to fifteen minutes more, stirring often.\n\n2.) Pour in half the stock, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire, maggi, and bring to a low simmer and let it cook for about ten more minutes. \n\n3.) In another bowl add the milk and heavy cream and let it get room temperature while soup is simmering. Slowly pour into the soup while whisking and stir well. Sporadically scrape the bottom of the pot to make sure nothing is sticking. Simmer for a few more moments.\n\n4.) Ladle about a cup of liquid out of the soup (it\u2019s okay if some mushroom/meat bits come along)  and put it the bowl you used for the milk and whisk in the flour until there are no lumps. Then pour back into the soup and cook until the soup gets thicker, like five to ten more minutes, stirring often.\n\n5.) Add the rest of the stock and then add the noodles and cook according to the package\n\n6.) Remove the soup from heat.

[Video](https://youtu.be/gPWTQ8zZWxM)\n\nFor the ingredients we need \n\n1 pound of soup meat beef you can use 2 pounds if you want it more meaty \n\n3 bell peppers \n\n2 large onions \n\n2 carrots \n\n2 stems of celery \n\n2 cloves of garlic \n\na bottle of wine \n\n2 tablespoons of tomato paste \n\n250ml /1 cup of beef broth \n\n1 tablespoon of Salt \n\n1 tablespoon of ground black pepper \n\n1 tablespoon of smoke paprika\n\n1 tablespoon cayenne pepper for heat \n\nHalf the onions, remove opposite side of the root and then remove the most outer shell. After that cut the onion halves with your knife towards the root 3-4 times and then once more horizontal cut towards the root of the onion. Make sure that you do not cut the root or you\u00b4ll lose the stability. Now we can chop up the onion into large chunks and put them aside.\n\nafter that chop up the garlic cloves into small pieces, we can crush the cloves with the broadside of the knife to remove the shell more easily. chop of the ends, halve the cloves and start to slice them along the long side. After that chop the garlic slices into small pieces and add them to the bowl with the onion chunks.\n\nonce we are done with the garlic we can put a pot onto the stove at medium to high heat and add some vegetable oil. While the oil in the pot heats up we can start to slice the meat into chunks.\n\nI like to cut away some of the harder meat parts but in theory you don\u2019t need to because the stew will boil for a long time which will make the meat tender. We cut the soup meat into thump size pieces. While we do that we need to keep in mind the oil in the pot.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough we can add the onion chunks and the garlic bits. Stir them thoroughly so they don\u2019t burn immediately. After the onions turned glassy add the tomato paste and the smoked paprika and stir it as well. Do not let the tomato paste get burned just a little bit heated.\n\nNow we need to open the wine bottle and deglaze the onion garlic tomato paste mix with about 350ml or 1 and half cup of wine and stir it a bit. Add about 250ml or a cup of beef stock to the goulash as well. After we added the wine and the stock we can add the meat.\n\nI cleaned the chopping board and the knife after I chopped the meat which is just a safety precaution. I don\u2019t like to work on surfaces that came in contact with raw meat.\n\nOnce the meat is added we can start with the carrots and the celery, peel the carrots, and chop them into disks, wash the celery stems and then chop them into equally thick pieces as the carrots. add both the carrots and the celery stem pieces to the goulash.\n\nAfter that we need to add the spices before simmering. Add about a tablespoon of salt, a tablespoon of ground black pepper and a tablespoon of cayenne pepper.\n\nNow the goulash must simmer for about 2 hours. We can leave the lid a little bit open so some of the moisture can escape and the goulash thickens. While the goulash is simmering we can chop up the bell pepper.\n\nChop of the head and remove the core than remove the inner white parts. Chop of the bottom as well and cut all the bell pepper pieces into slices about half a centimeter or a quarter inch thick and put them aside. The bell pepper gets added about 20-30 minutes before the goulash is finished. this will let the bell pepper stay a bit firmer once we serve the goulash.\n\nWe can Test the meat inside the goulash by squishing it with something blunt if we are able to tear it apart the goulash is finished, and you can enjoy a hearty meat stew.

Cut the brie fresh out of the fridge, it will be easier to cut. But, to achieve optimal melty gooey cheesiness---let the brie come to room temperature for 20 minutes before baking. \n\n3.

{"title": "Homemade Vinaigrette dressing may be one of the easiest recipes there is. Plus it's fun to experiment with!", "selftext": "[Here's a short video on it](https://youtu.be/2m2FIC1nqBc)\n\nI've always loved a good tangy vinaigrette dressing on a salad, but for some reason went through years of cooking without bothering to learn to make my own. Once I finally did, I was a bit surprised at how insanely simple it is: combine oil and something acidic, like vinegar or lemon juice, and season it how you want. This recipe is for the most basic of vinaigrettes. It's tasty on its own, but it's a perfect foundation for experimenting with different ingredients to create your own signature dressing.\n\n**Ingredients:**  \n\u00bd to \u00be cup oil of choice\n\n\u00bc cup lemon juice or vinegar of choice\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nDijon Mustard (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**  \nAdd ingredients to a jar or other lidded container. Close the lid tightly and vigorously shake until the ingredients have combined. Use a piece of lettuce or other salad veggie to taste the dressing and adjust seasoning or oil/vinegar ratio to taste. For a more mellow flavor, add more oil. For more tanginess, add more of the vinegar or lemon juice.\n\n**Notes:**  \nStore in the fridge for up to a week. The oil and vinegar will separate back out over time, which is completely normal. Just shake it up before using to re-combine. Some oils will begin to solidify in the fridge. If this happens, set it out on the counter a few minutes before use to let it loosen back up. If no perishables were used in the dressing (i.e. only oil, vinegar, and seasoning), refrigeration is not necessary.\n\nI would avoid using white vinegar if possible as the acidity is very strong but it adds no flavor. If you need to for whatever reason, mix in lemon juice as well. Or maybe you could add a splash of it if you want an extra-tangy dressing.\n\nUse this recipe as a jumping off point to experiment! Try different combinations of oils, acids, spices, and herbs. One of my favorite versions uses rice vinegar, miso, and a bit of sesame oil. When I'm trying out new combos, I add a small amount of ingredients a time, tasting as I go. Mustard in particular is a great addition because of the one-two punch of adding flavor and texture, as well as helping the dressing stay emulsified for longer.\n\nWhat are y'alls favorite variations?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/kxur4k/homemade_vinaigrette_dressing_may_be_one_of_the/", "created_utc": 1610718145.0, "score": 97, "author": "southerngentleman90", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/kxur4k/homemade_vinaigrette_dressing_may_be_one_of_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Chicken thighs simmered in creamy tomato sauce (one pan)", "selftext": "Last evening my wife was working, and that leaves three of us for dinner.  I had three frozen chicken thighs that I did not use for a dish I made a week or so ago (I thawed them of course).  So, I decided to improvise a simmered chicken dish with what I had.  Most of my experiments in simple cooking are not worthy of writing down or sharing, but this one was really good.  It takes a while, but most of that is the simmering, which is when you can get side dishes ready.  Or enjoy a glass of wine, it's up to you.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 3 to 5 chicken thighs (I use skin-on, but skinless boneless is fine, just not as flavorful without the skin and fat)\n* 1 Can condensed Cream of Mushroom soup (or Cream of Chicken)\n* 1 Can (14 oz) diced tomatoes, drained, any variety you like (plain, Italian, fire roasted)\n* salt and pepper\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n* 1/2 tsp oregano\n* 1 Tbsp cooking oil (I prefer canola when searing)\n* 1/4 tsp chili flakes for a little zing (optional)\n* 1 Cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)\n\n(This may look like a lot of steps, but the basic steps are sear the meat for 8-10 minutes, make sauce with soup and tomatoes, simmer for 30-35 minutes.)\n\n# Instructions\n \n1. Bring 1 Tbsp oil to medium-high heat in a large, deep skillet.\n2. Salt and pepper both sides of chicken to taste\n3. Sear the chicken for about 4 minutes per side, and remove from pan, set aside on a plate\n4. Adding a little more oil if needed, saute mushrooms (if using) for a few minutes until they release their water\n5. Empty cans of soup and tomatoes, and the spices, into the skillet over the mushrooms, stir well, and bring to a simmer\n6. Reduce heat to medium-low\n7. Add chicken to the sauce, skin side down, spoon some of the sauce over the thighs.\n8. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.  Be sure this is a medium-low simmer.\n9. Remove cover, turn thighs over, spoon sauce over thighs again.\n10. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  Time is not super critical, so they can simmer a little longer if you're waiting on a side dish.\n\nTo serve, arrange chicken on plates, spoon sauce over. \n\n\n#Notes:\n\n* Italian Seasoning can be substituted for oregano and garlic if you want.\n\n* For my sides, while the chicken was simmering, I made steak-cut french fries in an air fryer and heated up a can of spinach.  This chicken and sauce would go GREAT with mashed potatoes, rice, or even over pasta, plus any green side you like.\n\n* I got both the cans of soup and tomatoes on sale for $1 each, so not only is this easy, it was inexpensive.\n\n* Hopefully you are familiar with your stove-top.  I have found that when many recipes call for \"saute on medium-high\", I need to use just medium on my stove.  Likewise, \"simmer at medium-low\" really means \"low\" for me.  Most important here is not to overcook the chicken skin when searing.\n\n* I recommend a nonstick pan for this.  Even with cooking spray and cooking oil, I've had chicken skin stick to my stainless pans before when searing, and this puts me in a bad mood.  \n\n* I only used three thighs, since that's what I had, but there was plenty of sauce for two more (maybe even three).  I usually can't fit six thighs into my largest pan, though.\n\n* While eating this, the sauce reminded me very much of the sauce on a breakfast skillet I used to get at a restaurant near here.  So, today for breakfast, I cut up the leftover fries, fried them in oil to crisp them up, then scrambled some eggs, and spooned some of he leftover sauce over the eggs in the pan stirring until everything was heated through.  It was just a wonderful hearty breakfast.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/zms8vs/chicken_thighs_simmered_in_creamy_tomato_sauce/", "created_utc": 1671128878.0, "score": 95, "author": "brock_lee", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/zms8vs/chicken_thighs_simmered_in_creamy_tomato_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chocolate Caramel Poke Cake with Coconut Mousse Recipe", "selftext": "So I made a really great dessert this week. Of course I have to share!\n\n[Video Recipe for those who prefer it!](https://youtu.be/k_TMUL7rXBI)\n\nIngredients for the cake:\n\n - 200gr sugar\n - 125ml coconut milk\n - 30ml milk\n - 3 eggs\n - 150gr butter\n - 160gr flour\n - 50gr cocoa powder\n - 6gr baking powder\n - Vanilla Extract\n - 100gr dark chocolate\n \n\nWe're starting with making the cake.\nWill be the best to use a hand mixer. You can use a kitchen robot. \nAnyway, into a bowl, add the room temp butter, granulated sugar and vanilla extract. Mix that for 1-2 minutes, and \nadd cocoa powder. Mix again for around 2-3 minutes. Now add 3 eggs and mix again for 2 minutes.\nAfter that, add coconut cream, milk, sift the flour, baking powder and a little salt. Give it a mix until everything its incorporated.\nIf some flour will be on the sides of the bowl, use a spatula and just scrape the sides and fold it in. Don't keep the mixer on for too long.\nEverything should mix in under 1 minute. Add your dark chocolate now and fold. The dark chocolate should be cut in small cubes.\nWe cook the cake at 175\u00b0C for 35 minutes FAN OFF preheated oven. Do a toothpick test, but be careful because you have melty chocolate in there.\nBut after that time the cake should be done. After the cake its done, let it cool down to room temp. \n\nCaramel Ingredients: \n \n - 400gr Sugar\n - 100ml Water\n - 240ml Heavy Cream 20% fat\n - 120gr butter 80% fat\n\nAfter that, let's make the caramel.\nSugar+water in a sauce pan and put it on a medium heat. Let it cook there and don't touch it till it gets the color you want.\nMeanwhile get your heavy cream and put it on low heat to warm it up. The butter should also be at room temperature and not cold.\nWhen the sugar gets to that caramel color, put the heat on lowest possible, and add your warm heavy cream. \nMix with a wooden spoon, and remove it from the heat as soon as possible. Now its time to add your butter\nand mix till it melts. You should have the butter in smaller cubes so it melts faster. If any of these ingredients are cold you will give the caramel a temperature shock and risk crystallization.\n\nNow poke your cake using the back of a spatula, a straw or the back of a small honey spoon. I used the back of a small honey spoon.\nThis is more about preference. Have as many holes in there as you want. Add a thin layer of that warm caramel and fill the holes.\nPut it in the fridge for around 2 hours.\n\nMousse Ingredients:\n \n - 250ml coconut milk\n - 350ml whipping cream\n - 9gr gelatine\n - 30ml water\n - vanilla extract\n\nAfter those 2 hours, its time to make the mousse. Before removing it from the fridge, take a bowl, sweetened whipping cream and the rest of the coconut cream/milk.\nHave the coconut cream on low heat to warm it up. It should be warm but not hot to burn your finger.\nWhile that gets hot, take a glass with around 30ml of cold water and add your gelatin to it. Then place the glass into a bowl with boiling water. This will help that gelatin to melt.\nUse a hand mixer to mix the whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Add your gelatin to the coconut cream after removing it from the heat and mix.\nAdd a little whipping cream in there too and give it another mix. This will help to cool down the mixture even more and it will make it easier to incorporate.\nAdd the coconut cream mixture over the whipping cream and fold using a spatula. \n\nThat's the mousse. Add it over the cold cake. BUT after you remove the cake from the fridge, some of the holes \nmay be \"empty\" since the cake will absorb some of the caramel. Don't worry, add more caramel into the holes and THEN add your coconut mousse. That mouse really needs to set.\n\nI had on the cake some toasted coconut flakes, coconut chips and more caramel. \n\nSome TIPS:\n\nNow I know some people don't like gelatin. You can use agar-agar but I didn't so I don't know the amounts.\nYou can't make this mousse without because its too runny and it won't set. \nIt really needs to sit in the fridge as long as possible. 12hours will be the best, you could let it sit just around 6 hours, but do it at your own risk.\nJust don't use heavy cream or butter that its not warm or room temp in the caramel. You will most likely ruin it.\nWooden spoon also helps in there because the metal spoon or spatula are usually more cold.\nMake sure the sweetened whipping cream its not oversweet. The base cake its already sweet enough, the caramel its as sweet as it gets, and you don't want another super sweet mousse on top.\n\nNow I really hope you gonna enjoy this cake!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/occ9yy/chocolate_caramel_poke_cake_with_coconut_mousse/", "created_utc": 1625239186.0, "score": 94, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/occ9yy/chocolate_caramel_poke_cake_with_coconut_mousse/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Traditional Moldavian Mucenici", "selftext": "So I usually post lots of recipes and stuff, and today I decided to make a traditional one from my country. For those who don't know me, I'm from Romania. On 9th March we have a tradition where we make a dessert named Mucenici. There are 2 types of it. One of it is Moldavian Mucenici, that I made today. As you may get from the name these are more popular in Moldavian part.\n\nTo describe them a little...is a really fluffy sweet \"bread\"? that's also chewy and has walnuts and honey on it with some nice sweet syrup with citric taste. Anyway, these are SUPER great and delicious, and I hope some of you will try to make it. \n\nI don't know how great I will describe this whole recipe but I'll try.   \nI do have a [video recipe](https://youtu.be/dkeQB6HPXYg) that's easier to understand\n\nAnd some [pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/g9sEm39) if you just want to see them\n\nIngredients :\n\n \\- 500gr flour, 60gr sugar, 20gr vanilla sugar, 7gr salt, 330ml warm milk, 75gr melted butter, 7-10gr dried yeast, 1tbsp oil, 2tbsp honey, vanilla extract, lemon zest, 1 egg, walnuts\n\n \\- for the syrup 70gr sugar, 175ml water, lemon/orange slices, 1tsp cinnamon\n\nAnd ok where do I start. Add the flour, sugar, vanilla sugar and salt into a bowl. If you can't get vanilla sugar, just add more sugar. \n\nIn another bowl, we gonna have the warm milk, and we gonna add the warm melted butter on top of it. (It should be warm, not hot). Add the dried yeast, along with the honey, vanilla extract and lemon zest. Give them a nice mix, and let them sit for 5 minutes.\n\nAdd them to the dry ingredients, and use a stand mixer to kneed these. You can also use your own hands. You have to kneed this until it gets smooth. While kneading, you can add 1tbsp of oil to help you around. Try to not add anymore flour, because adding more will result in a heavier dough and we don't want that. After kneading it, cover it and let it sit at room temp for 1-2 hours. It should at least double in size. \n\nNow add some little flour on your working space, and roll the dough. Try to get a rectangle shape out of it, and it should be around 1cm thick. Cut it in 5-6 stripes(preferably equal stripes, but if not, that's not a problem, we gonna shape them in 2 different ways). The long stripes, roll them with your hand to form a long string. Take it from the middle and keep it in the air, while you twist it. After you twist the whole thing, seal the end, and form an 8 out of it.\n\nThe second form and the simpler one that's better for the smaller stripes, is to form a string, and roll it from the both ends at the same time towards the middle kinda like a cinnamon roll I guess. I really don't know how to explain these better, I do have a video out of it but I can't post it everywhere.\n\nAnyway, after you form them, put them in a baking pan that has baking paper on it of course, and cover them for another 30 minutes. After that, give them a nice egg wash, and put some crushed walnuts on top. As many as you want. Bake it for around 25-30 minutes at 180\u00b0C fan OFF. \n\nWhile they're baking, make the syrup. Add the sugar with A LITTLE water on a pan and put it on medium heat until it change the color. When the color change, add those 175ml of water and try to mix it a little and \"cook\" it until the sugar dissolve. Turn the heat off and add 3-4 slices of orange or lemon and cinnamon. Mix it, and let it sit until the Mucenici are done.\n\nWhen the Mucenici are done, put some of that syrup on them with a tablespoon, little by little. I personally prefer them with lots of syrup, but if you make more Mucenici, add them in different plates, and put different quantities of Syrup on each of them to see which one you prefer more.\n\nOof I know this was a huge wall of text. I would love any feedback on how to write these recipes better for you, I try to make them as friendly as possible for everyone to understand. Anyway, I really hope you gonna try these and if you like them, let me know!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/lzxzec/traditional_moldavian_mucenici/", "created_utc": 1615146169.0, "score": 94, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/lzxzec/traditional_moldavian_mucenici/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "GARLIC BUTTER CHICKEN THIGHS. This recipe is super easy; delicious; it always comes out perfectly; and it uses very common ingredients that you probably already have.", "selftext": "This recipe:\n\n\\* Is super easy\n\n\\* Is delicious -- it always turns out perfectly, and everyone loves it.\n\n\\* Uses ingredients you probably have around the kitchen already\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Equipment:**\n\nA skillet that can go in the oven; ideally, one with a lid.  I use one of those handle-less cast iron pans lined with ceramic. It's 13 or 14 inches across, and holds about 7 thighs. But I think a plain cast-iron skillet would work just as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, thawed. I get the Foster Farms frozen ones, very cheap at Costco (and I assume other places as well). I cook 7 at a time because that is what my cast-iron skillet will hold.\n\n2. Olive oil or any other cooking oil\n\n3. About 2 TBSP minced garlic. (I've taken to just buying the big jars of it. I put half in a mason jar in my fridge, and freeze the rest.)\n\n4. About 1/4 cup butter\n\n5. Salt and pepper\n\n6. Parsley (Strictly optional, mainly just for appearance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400F\n\n2. Heat some olive oil at medium high in an oven-proof skillet (ideally one with a lid).\n\n3. Pat dry the chicken thighs. Generously salt and pepper both sides.\n\n4. When the oil is hot, put the thighs in SKIN SIDE DOWN. Cook them at med-high for 10 minutes, or long enough to make the skin crispy and golden-brown. Resist the urge to move them around!\n\n5. Flip the thighs over, so the skin is up. Reduce heat (because you are about to put in garlic, and don't want to burn it).\n\n6. Make some space in the pan and put in the butter and the garlic. (You can also brown the garlic in a separate pan and then add it to the skillet, if that works better for you.) Move the thighs around so the oil/butter/garlic mixture is spread more or less evenly around the pan.\n\n7. Cook on stove at reduced heat for 5-6 minutes, enough to brown the garlic.\n\n8. Cover the skillet and place in oven for 40 minutes. It will come out perfectly. During this time you can make a salad or rice or whatever else you want.\n\n9. When ready to serve, spoon some of the oil/butter/garlic sauce over the chicken and sprinkle a little parsley on it.\n\nCredit: I got this recipe from [primaverakitchen.com](https://primaverakitchen.com) \n\nI hope you like it!

I'm actually surprised of how good this actually is.\n\n[Video Recipe](https://youtu.be/9ev69PlH6Ng) if you'd like to help me with a click.\n\nFor this recipe to work, we gonna need eggs, spring onion, carrot, cabbage, american cheese,\nsome ham of your choice, bread, ketchup and mayo. And of course some butter to cook our things in it.\nThere's not really a measurement for these, you just add how much you want of each, but I used 4 eggs for 2 sandwiches.\n\n 1. Prep the veggies by cutting the spring onion as small as you can. For the carrot, you want medium-long thin stripes and same for the cabbage.\n 2. Mix the eggs, add your veggies to them and mix again to coat everything in egg. \n 3. Season it with salt and pepper and cook it as you'd cook your omelette in a little butter. The veggies don't need to cook, so when the eggs are ready to eat, you're done.\n 4. Toast your bread slices in a little butter until nice and crisp on both sides.\n 5. To make your sandwich, you need to add ketchup + mayo on the bread, then your omelette. \n 6. At this point add your favorite ham in the pan to cook it a little. I use 2 slices of ham. When you flip it, is time to also add your slice of cheese.\n 7. You top your omelette with that ham and cheese and top it with another slice of bread that should also be coated with ketchup + mayo.\n\nThe original recipe has sugar in it before you add your ham...but the ketchup is sweet enough so I'm personally not gonna add any sugar in this.\n\nAnd that's it!

Pairs beautifully with white rice. \u2063\u2063\n\n\u2063\u2063A dish you don't find in Korean restaurants, but a dish you have created with love by a Korean Mom or Grandma.\n\n\u2063\u2063INGREDIENTS:\n\n* 590g kimchi, VERY fermented with juices intact (1 large bowl amount)\\*\n* 1 package of sausages (8 sausages, we used Beef Franks)\n* 7.3 oz pork shoulder, chopped into 1 inch cubes (208g)\n* \u00bd Tbsp Dasida Beef Stock Powder ([We use CJ Dasida](https://www.amazon.com/Dasida-Beef-Flavor-Stock-17-63/dp/B00UZU9XJY))\n* 1 tsp sugar\n* \u00bd Tbsp Korean Red Pepper Flakes\n* 1 cup kimchi juice (250g)\n* 1 cup water\n* \u00bd Tbsp garlic, minced\n* Handful green onions, chopped\n* Oil\n* Optional: Tofu (firm), Fish Cake, Spam, Rice Cakes, Canned Tuna\n\n### INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Boil water in a large pot. Cut a package of sausages (8 sausages, we used Beef Franks) into \u00bd inch slices (don\u2019t cut the sausages too thin!) and add to boiling water. Let the sausages boil in the water for 2-3 minutes. We are boiling the nasty stuff out of the the sausages. Remove sausages and strain water out. Set aside.\n2. In the same pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add in 7oz (208g) of cubed pork shoulder. Mix around until it\u2019s just about to be fully cooked. Leave it in the pot.\n3. Add in 590g of napa kimchi (one large bowl size) with kimchi juices intact. Again, it needs to VERY fermented. Add into pot with pork. Mix.\n4. Then add in the following ingredients and mix: \u00bd Tbsp Dasida Beef Stock Powder ([We use CJ Dasida](https://www.amazon.com/Dasida-Beef-Flavor-Stock-17-63/dp/B00UZU9XJY)), 1 tsp sugar, \u00bd Tbsp Korean Red Pepper Flakes, 1 cup kimchi juice (250g), Sausages (drained earlier).\n5. Add in 1 cup of water. Increase heat to medium high and wait for the stew to boil. Reduce heat to medium, and gently boil for 10 minutes.\n6. After 10 minutes, add in \u00bd Tbsp minced garlic and a handful of chopped green onions. Serve immediately with rice or reheat when ready to serve. Refrigerate any leftovers.\n\n### NOTES:\n\n\\*All kimchi differs. Some are saltier. Some are sweeter. Some are spicier, so use this recipe as a guide and adjust accordingly. My Mom\u2019s kimchi is not overly salty or spicy. That\u2019s why we did not add salt and added in Korean Red Pepper Flakes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/glnz0k/classic_kimchi_stew_kimchi_jjigae_one_pot/", "created_utc": 1589751454.0, "score": 93, "author": "yummyonoff", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/glnz0k/classic_kimchi_stew_kimchi_jjigae_one_pot/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Hi Everyone Made these amazing soft chewy Bagels. You can easily make at Home. Really Simple!!!", "selftext": " Today we are gonna make easy home made bagels that anyone can make at home and in their kitchen. You only need a few basic ingredients like flour, salt, yeast, and sugar and the rest of it comes down to the technique. Homemade bagels taste better and are cheaper. The other day I  bought bagels from the store. And they were not that great. So I thought I can do better, and so I did! Here is my recipe.    \n\nFull Recipe with instructions here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1\\_i4ZK\\_7KXY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_i4ZK_7KXY)\n\n Ingredients   \n\n1 and 1/3 cup of warm water or about 310 ml  \n\n1.5 tablespoons or 18g sugar  \n\n1 tablespoon active dry yeast or 7g  \n\n3.5 cups or 445g bread flour (about 3.5 cups) \n\n1.5 teaspoons salt or 7g  \n\nSeasoning: \n\n1 tbsp white sesame seeds \n\n1 tbsp black sesame seeds  \n\nToppings  \n\n1/4 cup or 25g of Cheddar Cheese  \n\n1/4 cup or 25g of mozzarella cheese   \n\nInstructions  \n\n We are going to take about 1 and 1/3 cup or 310 ml of warm water and then add about 1.5 tbsp or 18g of sugar, add 1 packet, or 7g of dry active yeast. Then stir it up and put it to the side for 10 mins. Next, we\u2019re going to add 3.5 cups or 445g of flour in a bowl to which we will add about 1.5 tsp or 9g of salt. We will pour in our yeast mixture and start mixing everything up. If you have a mixer then kneed the dough for about 5 mins. If kneading by hand then do it for about 8-10 mins or until you get a smooth texture. Coat your hands with oil and create a firm dough ball, cover your bowl up and place it in a warm place for 1 hour. Next, take out the dough and kneed it until air comes out. You are going to divide this dough into 8 individual balls. To shape the bagels, pinch your finger and create a hole in the center and stretch out the dough until a loop forms. (You have to see the video for better instructions). Again set the dough aside for 30 mins and let the bagels rise. After 30 mins, you are going to boil the bagels. For the perfect chewy texture, boil for 1 min on each side.  Next, we\u2019re gonna make the egg wash. To make the egg wash I use the splash of milk and one egg white. for some reason, I wasn\u2019t in the mood of an egg yolk. Next season your bagel by sprinkling a 50/50 mixture of black and white sesame seeds. I used about 1tbsp for each seed. You can use any season like garlic and poppy seeds. You can also find a bagel seasoning at the store. It\u2019s really up to you how you wanna season your bagels. Then To take my bagels up to the next level I topped it with a 50-50 mix of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. I used about 1/4 cup of mozzarella and 1/4 cup of cheddar to 4 of my bagels.  Finally, bake this at 400f or 200c for about 20 mins. The bagels should come out nice and golden. A good way to tell if things are baked properly is by looking at the bottom. It should be nicely toasted. And that\u2019s pretty much it for making bagels. I hope you try it out and let me know how it turned out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/hfd8jn/hi_everyone_made_these_amazing_soft_chewy_bagels/", "created_utc": 1593047684.0, "score": 91, "author": "toastyfoodsus", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/hfd8jn/hi_everyone_made_these_amazing_soft_chewy_bagels/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Any oil will do, but I love using a bit of sesame oil for this step. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan as the goal here is to try and get some color (which brings flavor + texture) on the chicken. Don\u2019t worry about cooking it all the way through; just worry about your crust. \n\nOnce the chicken is ready, add in the coconut milk, curry paste (start with 1 Tbsp), chilies, and fish sauce (careful, it\u2019s potent and a little goes a long way). Simmer and stew that chicken in that fatty goodness. Once the flavor is where you like, toss in the basil and bring to a low simmer, stirring frequently to keep the coconut milk from burning. \n\nOnce your about twenty minutes out from starving, toss* in the broccoli and other veggies and let them stew a bit until at your preference if tender. **If you can swing it, saut\u00e9 the veggies ahead of time to pull out their water before throwing them in the curry.

Milk rice is often eaten with lunu miris.\n\nFor the Sinhalese, Kiribath plays a crucial role in the celebration of the Sinhalese New Year, as it is consumed as the first meal of the year. Also, It is traditionally offered for breakfast on the first day of each month, but it also has the added meaning of being eaten at an auspicious juncture in one\u2019s life that marks a transitional period. It is one of Sri Lanka\u2019s most well-known traditional foods.\n\nLunu miris is a spicy paste or sauce created from a variety of fresh ingredients, sometimes known as a sambol.

Don\u2019t use a knife to remove the seed; you can easily injure yourself! Remove the avocado pulp and place it into a bowl.\n\n3.

A classic dish thats popular in the US. The spicy soup with the soft tofu has been a warm and comfortable dish to hungry eaters or as a hangover cure. I remember eating this at 4 AM after a night of drinking. Happy times\\~  \n\n*1 Serving* \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\n* 1 pack of extra soft/silken tofu (350g) \n* 1 cup of water, anchovy stock, or beef bone stock \n* 1 egg  \n\n**Paste Ingredients:** \n\n* sesame oil\n* 1 piece of pork belly (75g) \n* 1/4 onion \n* 1 green onion \n* pinch of salt \n* 1 tbs minced garlic \n* 2 tbs soy sauce\n* 1 tsp sugar \n* 2 tbs gochugaru (fine red pepper powder)\n\n**Recipe:** \n\n1. Chop onion and green onion finely, and chop pork belly \n2. Pan on medium heat, add in sesame oil, onion, green onion, and pork belly. Cook until onions soften. Add in minced garlic and salt. Lower the heat then add in soy sauce, sugar, and gochugaru. Mix together until it forms something like a paste.  \n3. In a Ttukbaegi (\ub69d\ubc30\uae30) or a small pot, add in a cup of water or stock and the paste. Bring to a boil. \n4. Add in tofu and let that simmer for a few minutes.

Add the yeast, mix it and let it sit for 5 minutes or so. You don't really have to do this, but it is more to make sure the yeast is working.\n\nIn a bowl of a stand mixer, or a normal bowl if you want to work this with your hands, add the flour, along with the rest of the sugar and salt. Tiny whisk to mix these together.\n\nNow add the water with the yeast, the buttermilk and melted butter. Mix this with the dough hook for 3-4 minutes. After that check if the dough is still sticky. If it is (Mine was) add a little more flour. I think I added 10-20gr more. Also 1-2tsp of oil may also help here. Anyway, you don't want this to be perfectly smooth and not sticky. This needs to be just a little sticky. Spread some oil into the bowl, put the dough back in, cover it and let it sit for 1-1:30 hours.\n\nAfter this, spread the dough in a rectangular shape or a square, or something that looks a little equal in all parts. It doesn't have to be perfect. Spread some shredded cheese on top. You can use whatever cheese you prefer. You can use a mix of 2 if you'd like to. Anyway spread the cheese, add some dried basil, oregano and dill, and roll everything up from an end to the other as you'd prepare a cinnamon roll. Cut the whole roll in half lengthwise and keep both parts near each other. Seal them at one end, and then twist them once or twice, then seal the other end.\n\nPut it in the loaf baking pan. Cover it again in plastic and let it sit 20-30 more minutes. Cook it at 175\u00b0C for around 40-50 minutes. FAN OFF. After 40 minutes, just check it out to be sure you're not gonna burn it.

The dipping sauce is a classic that takes these sweet and juicy cabbage fritters to the next level. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have all the ingredients for the sauce- only the soy sauce, apple cider vinegar and sugar are essential!\n\nIngredients\n\n**Baechu Jeon Batter**\n\n* 1 egg\n* \u00bc tsp salt\n* \u00be cup flour (115g) (for batter)\n* 1 cup water (240ml)\n\n**Other**\n\n* \\~8-10 napa cabbage leaves\n* cooking oil\n* \u00bc-\u00bd cup flour (for dredging)\n\n**Jeon Dipping Sauce**\n\n* 2 tbsp soy sauce\n* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar\n* 1 tbsp sugar (Muscovado sugar)\n* 1 tsp gochujang\n* 1 scallion, chopped\n* 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Make the Korean jeon dipping sauce by mixing 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp gochujang, 1 chopped scallion, and 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds. \n2. Prepare the batter by whisking 1 egg in a stainless-steel pan. Season with salt and gradually add \u00be cup flour (115g) flour while whisking. \n3. Slowly pour in 1 cup (240ml) water while continuing to whisk. Don\u2019t worry if there are small lumps in the batter- this is normal. \n4. Take 8-10 napa cabbage leaves and gently snap the stem to flatten. Wash and shake until damp.\n5. Dredge two leaves on a large plate with \u00bc-\u00bd cup flour added. Dip flour-coated leaves in jeon batter and completely coat. \n6. On high heat, pour 2 tbsp oil (or more) into a non-stick pan. Once the oil is hot enough, use tongs to transfer cabbage leaves to pan, ensuring excess batter drips off. Pan-fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp.  Serve this first batch straight away with dipping sauce. \n7. Repeat Step 5-6 until batter has been used up. Alternatively, refrigerate the batter and continue making baechu jeon the next day- making sure to stir the batter before re-using. \n\nRECIPE LINK: https://londonishungry.com/baechu-jeon-cabbage-pancake/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/xnmodr/korean_napa_cabbage_fritter_pancakes_baechu_jeon/", "created_utc": 1664110623.0, "score": 83, "author": "londonishungry", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/xnmodr/korean_napa_cabbage_fritter_pancakes_baechu_jeon/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Place batter into a pan, and flatten it out to form a pancake shape. Fill any holes and gaps with more batter so that you do not see the pan throughout the pancake. Add more oil if necessary (my Mom always adds more oil to the edges as she forms the pancake). Total fry time will be 7-8 minutes per pancake.\n4. Flip the pancake once the bottom is just about to be golden. Continue to flip until the entire pancake is crispy and golden (3-4 flips).\n5.

Add 60ml water and whisk until the batter is smooth\n9. Wrap the batter bowl and let it chill in the fridge for 20 minutes\n10. After 20 minutes, heat up your non stick pan under low heat for a few minutes (3-4 minutes)\n11. Use a small spoon, scoop the batter and gently drop it to the non stick pan\n12. Make mini dorayaki about 5-6 cm(2-2,5 inches) or make it the size you desire\n13. Cook under low heat until you see the bubbles on the surface pop and stay open then flip the pancakes\n14.

I put together the below recipe as a fast easy guide to making perfect grilled shrimp, every time. \n\nI also created a step by step video on this recipe that you can watch here:  [https://youtu.be/6W-ngypdvCE](https://youtu.be/6W-ngypdvCE)  If you like what you see, please make sure to like and subscribe! I make weekly recipes for inside and outside the kitchen cooking. \n\n Ingredients:  \n\n* \\-1-2 pounds of raw peeled shrimp (Jumbo or Colossal)\n*  \\-Olive Oil, -1/2 stick of butter\n* \\-1 lemon\n* \\-Lemon zest\n* \\-1Tbsp. Cayenne pepper\n* \\-4 Cloves minced garlic\n* \\-Minced parsley (garnish)\n\nSupplies:  \n\n* \\-Bamboo skewers soaked in water, or metal skewers\n* \\-small bowl for sauce \n* \\-Basting brush \n* \\-Knife \n* \\-Plate \n* \\-Grill or smoker able to hold 300-350 degrees \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Skewer shrimp, starting with a C shaped skewered shrimp at the base then skewer the rest only through the head layered atop. (See video, because that's tough to explain)\n2. Brush olive oil over the shrimp\n3. Salt and pepper shrimp and set aside to make basting sauce\n4. Melt 1/2 stick of butter in bowl. \n5. Add Cayenne, lemon juice, lemon zest, and garlic. Mix well\n6. Heat grill/smoker to 300-350 degrees. \n7. Place skewers over hot coals (no flames) \n8. Baste shrimp gently ensuring little drip onto coals, because that causes flare ups. (If fire does pop up, simply smother the fire by closing the grill top briefly. \n9. Flip skewers and continue to baste\n10. Remove shrimp once tails turn reddish pink, meat turns white and opaque, and everything firms up. Do not overcook, or it will turn rubbery (Cook time typically takes 5-8 minutes top)\n11. Remove shrimp from skewers and baste with remaining sauce. Salt pepper to taste. \n12. Serve with lemon wedges and cocktail sauce\n13. Enjoy!\n\nI hope this helps demystify grilling shrimp for some and please let me know if you have a different way of cooking them.

{"title": "The Best Smoked Cauliflower Recipe | How to Smoke a Whole Head of Cauliflower", "selftext": "Hey y'all! I'm back again and this time I'm sharing one of my favorite Veggie BBQ recipes, Smoked Cauliflower!\n\nIt's a fun twist to the usual BBQ fare, and makes for a wonderful appetizer or side, especially if you're already rolling smoke on something and have the room to toss this in as well. It's always a big hit at our BBQ get togethers, so let me know what you think if you give it a try.\n\nIf you prefer a visual aid, here's the step by step video: [CLICK HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3o5TmI6nuk)\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 Whole Head of Cauliflower\n* 1 Tbsp. Smoked Paprika\n* 1 Heaping Tbsp. Ranch Seasoning (roughly half a packet)\n* 1 tsp. Cumin\n* 1 tsp. Salt\n* 1 tsp. Garlic Powder\n* Olive Oil (4 Tbsp in mixing bowl, and more poured over the cauliflower)\n* Salt and Pepper to taste\n\nSupplies:\n\n* Foil Pan or Cast Iron Pan\n* Smoker (250 degrees F indirect)\n* Mixing Bowl\n* Sharp Knife\n* Boiling Water in a Pot or Microwave and Large Bowl with Water in it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Place the cauliflower in boiling water for 5 minutes over a stove, or steam it over boiling water in the microwave for about the same time frame. This will give the cauliflower a head start in softening, and make the smoking portion much simpler.\n2. Combine all other ingredients in a mixing bowl. Whisk until well mixed.\n3. Place cauliflower in a small cast iron pan or foil pan. Pour olive oil over the head making sure it soaks into the nooks and crannies. \n4. Baste the entire head with the seasoning paste. Make a second batch if there's not enough to cover everything.\n5. Set your cauliflower in your smoker set to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove once it is probe tender, where a probe or skewer slides in and out like butter.\n6. Let the cauliflower rest until it has cooled enough to handle.\n7. Cut into steak like cross sections, quarters, or simply cut all florets off and pile them high for grab and dip bites.\n8. (optional) Smother in melted seasoned butter, queso, you name it.

A \u201csmashed potato\u201d is a crispy potato medallions that are stacked after cooking and then smashed vertically to make a crispy version of a mashed like potato with a baked potato like consistency and are easier and in some ways better and more flavorful than mashed potatoes.\n\nAnd these smashers are so well.\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 Bangers (Sweet Italian, Bratwurst, or Spicy Italian, etc.)\n1/2 Onion.\n1 Large Russet Potato or 5 Yukon Gold or other small potatoes.\nCumin, Chili, Paprika, Cayenne, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, depending on whether bangers are already spicy or not, and whether banger grease will be used to flavor the banger gravy.\nItalian Seasoning & Onion Powder (for onions).\nThyme, Chili, Paprika for Smashed Potatoes.\nSalt & Black Pepper\nWorcester Shire Sauce\nBeef Broth, or Beef Stock, or Milk, or 1:1 Evaporated Milk & Water (if you don\u2019t have Beef Broth or want to make a country gravy instead of a more proper banger sauce).\nOlive Oil.\n\nPrep:\n\nPotatoes: Scrub, Peel, and cut in half short-wise and then each half in half again making medallions and caps. Cut each in half again, and then again if desired to shorten cooking time. Toss potatoes in 1/2 Tbsp Thyme, 1/3 Tsp Chili, 1/3 Tsp Salt, 1/3 Tsp Black Pepper, 1 Tsp Paprika (optional), 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil.\n\nBangers:\n\nOptionally coat bland bangers in spices. Sweet Italian in 1/2 Tbsp Paprika. Bratwurst in 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder. Hot Italian in 1 Tsp Italian Seasoning. Depending on which banger variety is used. Pre-bake if health conscious to remove some grease.\n\nOnion:\n\nSlice 1/2 Onion into strips. Optionally mince stubborn portions that won\u2019t go into to strips. Toss in 1/2 Tsp Italian Seasoning, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder, 1/3 Tsp Salt, 1/3 Tsp Black Pepper.\n\nCook:\n\nPan fry onions until just soft. Mild color is okay. Do not burn. Pour excess grease out, or, add banger grease or butter until 2 Tbsp flour can be used to soak up all the fat. The amount of flour necessary to soak up the fat will determine how much gravy will be made so it is not too unhealthy.\nOnce the flour is cooked, and before it turns brown, pour in 1/8 Cup Beef Stock or Beef Broth and stir. Milk or 1 to 1 Evaporated Milk and Water can be used to make a country gravy instead of a proper banger sauce. Keep it thick, pour in more Beef Stock (or Milk) until the desired amount of gravy is produced.\nAdd 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder, 1/3 Tsp Cumin, 1/3 Tsp Chili, 1/3 Tsp Paprika, 1/5 Tsp Cayenne Pepper as desired particularly if the banger grease was not used, or if the bangers are a bland variety. Pour in 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce.\nIt is better to make a more flavorful gravy and then need to dilute it with Beef Broth (or milk) than to make a too bland gravy and then need to dump in Black Pepper at the end until it livens up, but, Black Pepper can be added at the end until it livens up.\nPut bangers in the sauce as it starts to thicken and bubble until it thickens.\n\nGravy is done when scraping the spoon leaves a clean trace because gravy is thick enough.\n\nNOTE: If the potatoes are not cooked in one go to begin with they will dry out and then never taste cooked no matter how often you take them out and back into the oven so it is best to blast them for sufficient duration approximately 20-25 minutes and until they are golden brown.\n\nServe:\n\nBangers slathered in delicious onions and banger sauce.\nPotatoes stacked and smashed once vertically.\n1/4 Tsp extra salt on potatoes (if necessary)\n1/4 Tsp extra pepper on gravy (if necessary).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ywct9k/bangers_and_smash_w_delicious_onion_banger_sauce/", "created_utc": 1668554208.0, "score": 78, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ywct9k/bangers_and_smash_w_delicious_onion_banger_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

I\u2019m bringing you the only brioche buns recipe you need today to make the softest, fluffy and buttery brioche burger buns at home. All of these simple ingredients might already have in your pantry so I hope you give a try soon.\n\n[Full recipe and how to make the best brioche buns here:](https://youtu.be/iWOhtIS6Mf4)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 330g bread flour\n* 150g milk (lukewarm)\n* 30g sugar\n* 5g yeast\n* 1 large egg (room temperature)\n* \u00bd tsp salt\n* 70g unsalted butter\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Pour 150g warm milk and crack 1 large egg (room temperature) to a large bowl, add in 30g sugar and 5g yeast. Stir until sugar and yeast are dissolved.\n2. Add in the same bowl 330g bread flour. Roughly mix until all of ingredients are combined. Gently knead the dough for 2-3 mins, then cover and let it rest for 20 minutes.\n3. After 20 minutes, gluten has started to form so it\u2019s easier to knead by now. If you use stand mixer, add the dough and 70g butter (divide to 2-3 times) to knead for 12- 15 minutes or until the dough is elastic and pass windowpane test. If kneading by hands, add in 70g butter and knead until the butter is melted and knead for 12- 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and stretchable.\n4. Form into a smooth round ball, cover and let the dough proof for 1 \u2013 1hour and 20 minutes in room temperature or until double in size.\n5. Deflate and get all of the air bubbles out, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Make the dough into small round balls, put into a large baking tray to proof for another 50 minutes \u2013 1 hour until double in size.\n6. Prepare egg wash: 1 large egg yolk, 1 tbsp milk, brush all of the brioche buns with egg wash. Sprinkle with sesame seeds (optional)\n7. Bake in preheated oven at 375F for 13- 15 minutes or until dark golden brown. Cool the brioche buns in a cooling rack.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you want to use milk and egg straight out of fridge, mix them up and microwave for 40-45 seconds in the microwave to make it lukewarm.\n* Brioche buns have more butter than usual buns, so the kneading time might be a bit longer than usual buns.\n* Brioche hamburger buns can be stored in the freezer for 3 months. You can make it ahead of time, freeze them in Ziploc bags and after defrosting it it\u2019d still be soft and bouncy just as freshly made brioche buns.\n* If you like the brioche buns has darker golden-brown colour, brush with egg wash twice.

{"title": "Tiramisu bread. Super soft coffee bread with Tiramisu filling melt in your mouth.", "selftext": "I love Tiramisu, I love coffee and bread. So I made Tiramisu bread. This Tiramisu bread is a perfect combination of soft pillowy bread and tiramisu cream with mascarpone cheese, coffee flavour in the bread and a tiny bit of bitterness from cocoa powder. It\u2019s a favour bomb in a tiny bread waiting to explode in your mouth.\n\n[Full recipe with visual instructions here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYCa4OmAUMY)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**For the bread:**\n\n* 250g (1 \u00be cup) bread flour\n* 1tsp (5g) instant yeast\n* 1tsp (5g) instant coffee\n* 25g (5tsp) sugar\n* 110ml warm milk\n* 1 large egg\n* 3g (1/2 tsp) salt\n* 30g (2tbsp) butter (room temperature)\n\n**For the filling:**\n\n* 1 large egg yolk\n* 25g (5tsp) sugar\n* 20ml milk\n* 150g(2/3 cup) mascarpone cheese (room temperature)\n* 120ml whipping cream (heavy cream)\n* 1tsp (5g) dark rum, or kahlua coffee liqueur ( optional \u2013 skip it if you make for kids)\n* Cocoa powder (for topping)\n* Whipped cream (for topping \u2013 optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Pour 5g instant coffee to warm milk (Luke warm \u2013 heat it in the microwave 10-15 secs if it\u2019s straight out of the fridge). Stir until instant coffee is fully dissolved into the milk\n2. Crack one large egg in a big bowl, add coffee and coffee milk mixture to the same bowl. Add sugar and instant yeast in. Stir well and let it rest for 5 minutes.\n3. Add in the same bowl 250g bread flour, 3g salt. Stir to mix well and knead for 2-3 minutes until all of the ingredients are combined.\n4. If using stand mixer: Add 30g butter in the dough and knead in medium for 8 -10 minutes depending on your mixer\u2019s power or until the dough is smooth and stretchable. Do the window pane test, stretch your dough and see when if it\u2019s not break and you can see through it\u2019s done. If using hand to knead: Add 30g butter in the dough and knead for 10 minutes or until your dough is smooth and do the window pane test to see if it\u2019s ready as above.\n5. Let the dough rest in a bowl in a warm place until it\u2019s double or triple in size. ( 1 hour \u2013 1 and half hour depending how cold is your place). If your house is cold, put the dough into your oven with the oven light on, do not turn on the heat.\n6. Making the Tiramisu filling: Add 1 large egg yolk in a bowl, add 25g sugar and mix well. Put the egg mixture to a double boiler to make sure the raw egg yolk is cooked. Keep stirring under medium heat until you see the egg turn to light yellow and get thicker it\u2019s done. Add in 20ml warm milk to the same bowl. Mix well. Add mascarpone cheese (room temperature) to mix until smooth. In a clean separated bowl, whisk 120g heavy cream until stiff peaks. Gently fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture, add 5g dark rum or your choice of liqueur in if you prefer. Mix until the filling is smooth. Refrigerated for at least an hour.\n7. After 1 hour proofing, deflate the dough and divided into 6 equal pieces (use kitchen scale if you have). Turn the dough inside out and make it into 6 round balls, cover and let it proof for another 35 \u2013 45 minutes or until double in size. Spray some water on top of the bread and bake in the oven at 330F for 12 minutes.\n8. Take the bread out, let it cool down and put the Tiramisu filling into a pastry bag. Poke a hole on the side of the bread using a chopstick, gently making some room for the filling inside. Fill the Tiramisu filling inside the bread. Top the bread with some whipped cream and/or cocoa powder to finish our Tiramisu bread. Now enjoy this delicious bread. It can be stored in the air tight container in the fridge for a few days but mine don\u2019t last for more than 2 days.\n\nThank you everyone and if you wanna give it a try someday, please let me know in the comment down below.

{"title": "My Mothers Scone Bread Recipe", "selftext": "So this is a recipe that my whole family grew up on. It was originally my grandmothers recipe and my mum tweaked it a little bit over the years. When I came across this subreddit a while back I decided I wanted to post this to spread my mums baking to others! We've always called it scone bread, but I think it's my grans version of a soda bread.\n\n\nNeither my mum nor my gran were particularly precise with measurements, in fact the original recipe was just a list of ingredients with no quantities, but my sister sat down with my mum one evening and measured out everything she was adding (best give credit on the off chance she comes across this post!). I've also taken the liberty of converting it into metric measurements since that's what everything in my kitchen uses. I've kept both in the post.\n        \nINGREDIENTS & TOOLS\n\n* Ovenproof dish with lid (we use a casserole dish)\n\n* 450g self-raising flour (about 1lb in imperial)\n\n* Teaspoon of salt\n\n* 2 Dessert spoons of sugar (about 20g)\n\n* Buttermilk (about 450 - 500ml or 16-17fl. oz)\n\nMETHOD\n\nPreheat oven to 200\u00b0C with dish in the oven\n\nSift flour and salt into bowl, add sugar and mix.\n\nAdd buttermilk and stir until a stiff dough is formed.\n\nRemove dough from bowl onto a floured surface and knead gently to bring everything together.\n\nTake dish from oven, add dough and press gently to fit dish.\n\nMark a cross into the top of the dough with a knife.\n\nAdd to oven and cook for about 30 minutes.\n\nRemove lid from dish and cook for another 15 minutes.\n\nRemove from oven, press out onto a wire rack and leave to cool.\n\nThe finished version should look like this: [**scone bread**](https://i.imgur.com/otR43Xd.jpg)\n\nI also created a short video just to show the process in case that makes it easier for people (please ignore my very basic editing): [**youtube video**](https://youtu.be/AWqMisJX0dU)\n\nFor serving it's good with just butter, or butter and jam, and especially good with butter and bacon.

This lemon drizzle cake is super moist, light and zesty, partly due to the lemon syrup that we pour on top of the cake after baking. Then, to top it off, a crunchy and zingy lemon glaze! It's a lemon lover's dream come true!\n\nIf you\u2019re a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpp5eJv7khw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpp5eJv7khw)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Cake**  \n200g butter, softened  \n200g caster sugar  \n1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice  \nzest of two lemons  \n3 eggs  \n50ml whole milk  \n220g self raising flour  \n1/8 tsp salt  \n1/4 tsp baking soda\n\n**Lemon Drizzle**  \n60g caster sugar  \n2 tbsp fresh lemon juice\n\n**Lemon Glaze**  \n50g icing sugar (also known as confectioner's sugar)  \n2 tsp fresh lemon juice (add more or less depending on consistency)  \n\n\n**Note:** If you do not have self raising flour, you can use plain or all purpose flour mixed in with baking powder. For every 100g of flour, add 1 tsp baking powder. As such, for this recipe, you would need to add 2 and 1/4 tsp. of baking powder to your plain or all purpose flour.)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 180C (350F). Grate the zest of 2 lemons. Into your mixing bowl, add 200g butter (softened) and 200g caster sugar. Cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. You can do this with a stand mixer, or by hand!\n2. Squeeze 20ml of fresh lemon juice. Into a bowl, add 3 eggs, 50ml of milk and \u00bd tsp. of your lemon juice. Give that a little mix to break up the eggs! Pour this mixture into your butter/egg mix in 3 increments. It may look curdled at this stage, but don\u2019t panic!\n3. In another bowl, add 220g self-raising flour add 1/8th tsp. salt and \u00bc tsp. baking soda. Pour this into your egg/butter/sugar mixture. Now add your lemon zest. Mix until all the ingredients just about come together, and then finish by hand. It\u2019s important not to over mix!\n4. Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line with parchment paper. Pour the mixture into your loaf tin and smooth the mixture out so it\u2019s nice and flat!\n5. Bake for 50-60 minutes.\n6. Now for the lemon drizzle! Into a bowl, add 60g caster sugar and 2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice. Give that a good stir until the sugar has fully dissolved.\n7. Once you remove your loaf from the oven, push a skewer into the cake and remove. If the skewer comes out clean, your lemon drizzle cake is baked! Continue to poke holes with your skewer across the entire loaf and then pour your lemon drizzle all over the top! The drizzle will seep into the skewer holes, ensuring your lemon drizzle cake is lovely and moist.\n8. Let your cake cool.\n9. Now for the lemon glaze! Sieve 50g icing sugar (also known as confectioner\u2019s sugar) into a bowl and add 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice. The glaze should be opaque, but still run off your spoon. Add more or less lemon juice to adjust the runniness of the glaze.\n10. Drizzle your glaze over your cake \u2013 and enjoy!!  \n\n\nIf you have any questions about this recipe, please do feel free to ask below!

Chop onions, peel and cut carrots into 1 inch pieces. Mince garlic. Now, peel pearl onions. I am a big fan of pearl onions, so I am using quite a bit more as the recipe requires. As Julia once said  \u201c it is hard to imagine civilization without onions \u201c\n\nCut mushrooms. Get the bacon ready. We need to pre-cut bacon into \u00bd inch slices. As you can see, everything is fair, I am using the same amount of ingredients for both Instant Pot and Dutch oven methods. \n\n**Step#2**  \n\n**Let's get Instant Pot ready**. Put bacon in a cold Instant Pot Pan and Start Instant Pot on Saut\u00e9 mode. **Pro Tip:** Always put bacon on the cold pan, it will allow fat to slowly melt and not burn.  \n\nCook bacon until crispy, remember to stir in the process. When bacon is crispy, take it out from the pan using a slotted spoon. Leave the bacon fat inside, we will use it to cook chicken and vegetables. \n\nNow, season the chicken with salt and pepper and cook until brown on both sides. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pot, do it in 2 batches. When ready, remove chicken to the plate. \n\n**For dutch oven**, I will follow the same process of cooking bacon and browning chicken on both sides. I do like the searing in a dutch oven better than instant pot. It is a bit faster and the skin looks crispier. \n\n**Step#3**\n\n**Instant Pot:**\n\nNow, add chopped onions and carrots to the pan and cook until the onion is translucent. Cook for about 6-7 minutes, then add garlic and mushrooms and cook for 2 more minutes. Now, add tomato paste and cook for another minute.  \n\nNow we can add pearl onions, thyme bundles and cover with wine, brandy and chicken stock. I am using my favorite French wine, but you can use any red wine of your choice. \n\nAnd finally, layer the chicken inside the instant pot, close the lid, set on high manual pressure for 8 minutes and wait for natural release. \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nIn the meanwhile I am following almost the same process with Dutch Oven. Except I have decided to cook mushrooms on a separate skillet with oil and then added pearl onions to cook them as well. Since I am not cooking under pressure, I wanted to make sure pearl onions and mushrooms would cook through. \n\nThen I followed the same process of cooking onion, carrots, garlic and tomato paste in the dutch oven. Cover it up with wine, brandy, and chicken stock. Layered the chicken on top along with the thyme bundle and let it simmer on medium low for 30 minutes. 30 minutes is enough to cook the chicken through, but if you want it to fall off the bone, you can simmer it for up to 1 hour on low heat. \n\nAll in all cooking this dish in the Instant Pot vs Dutch Oven takes about the same time. Instant Pot is a bit easier, as I cook everything in the same pot at once. If I were to slow cook lamb or beef, instant Pot would be a much faster alternative, but for chicken it takes about the same time.  \n\nInstant Pot: 10 min to pressurize + 8 min cook time + 15 min to depressurize\n\nDutch Oven: 30 min simmering on medium low.  \n\n**Step#4**\n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nWait for natural pressure release. Remove chicken and vegetables to the serving platter. Sauce looks a bit watery. Now we need to make it look like a gravy by adding Beurre Manie which is a combination of \u00bc stick of melted butter with 2 tablespoons of flour. Mix it well with the sauce, add bacon and set Instant Pot to Saute mode. In about 7 minutes, your sauce will thicken to desired texture. Remember to add salt and pepper if needed. Then add chicken back in and it is ready.  \n\nAlternatively you can sprinkle bacon on top of your final dish instead. \n\nDon't be afraid of butter. Julia famously said, \u201c**With enough butter, anything is good**.\u201d \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nAfter 30 minutes of simmering, take out chicken, add the butter mix, mushrooms, onions and  bacon.  \n\nSimmer for about 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Add chicken back in and it is ready. \n\nAnd finally, tasting. I did a blind tasting. We felt that texture and flavor are very similar in both plates.  Instant Pot was a bit less salty. After fixing the salt issue we settled that both versions taste very similar. Onions and mushrooms looked slightly better in dutch version since I cooked them separately. \n\nOverall Coq Au Van turned out really good. So all in all use either method\u2026\u2026they both good and take about the same time for this particular recipe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ui90wz/coq_au_vin_recipe_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "created_utc": 1651677677.0, "score": 77, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ui90wz/coq_au_vin_recipe_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "html_title": ""}

Once your protein is browned (and drained if relevant), season with salt & pepper, add 1-2 Tbsp of your prepared sauce, and stir to combine. Then push the protein to the sides, and add the garlic & ginger. Cook until fragrant (30-60 sec). Mix it, then add the chopped green tops of the green onion. Stir to combine, and cook another 30 seconds.

Also leave out the smaller amount spices if you do not have them. Do not put more trust me.\n\n2. Mix spice mix really well into defrosted Ground Beef.\n\n3. Heat a wok or skillet to 300^o Fahrenheit (150^o Celsius) with melted Olive Oil and Butter.\n\n4. Fry meat in 1 big brick 2 min. each side for 80/20 ground beef or 1 minute each side for 90/10 ground beef (because the less fat content makes it brown faster) or until nicely grizzled.\n\n5. Cut the meat brick in half and grizzle its exposed inside making note of how pink it remains.\n\n6. Continue cutting and grizzling meat until you cut the meat and it is no longer pink in the middle (a total time of approximately 12 minutes). (Perhaps let it sit covered for a couple minutes if you want to be reassured it is going to be fully cooked).\n\n7. Serve with warm Pita Bread (or Naan), Tzatziki Sauce, Hummus, Kalamata Olives, Sliced White Onion, Sliced Tomato.\n\nNOTE: This dish requires \\*NO MARINATION\\*, \\*NO PRE-BAKING\\*.

This should be enough to cook them even and nicely just in the pan.\nIf you make them bigger, after cooking them, you will probably need to put them in another pan, cover them with a parchment paper and cook them in the oven for 15-20 more minutes at 170\u00b0C fan off to be sure they're done.\n\nBut if you stick to 20grams, they should be fine. Use a pan, medium heat some butter and a little oil. When the butter melts, add your meatballs.\nDon't overcrowd the pan! Really important so you can get that nice crisp brown color on them. \n\nAfter they're done, make the sauce in the same pan. Add 35-40gr of butter and when it melts add 15gr of flour. Continue to mix with a wooden spoon or a whisk, to not get clumps. Really important to keep mixing. Cook it for 1-2 minutes. After that, add your veggie stock. You can use beef or chicken stock.\nMake sure the stock is warm and add little by little while mixing so you avoid lumps, and it should incorporate nicely. Cook for 1-2 minutes.\n\nAfter that add your heavy cream, mix and cook it for 1 more minute add 1 teaspoon of barbeque sauce, mix and it should be done at this point.\n\nServe the meatballs over some puree or baked potatoes, or whatever you'd like, add some sauce on top and enjoy! And because of Ikea got me into this, some cranberry jam goes well with it too.\n\nI really love this recipe and I had fun making it. Hope you gonna enjoy it!\nOhh and you can make this vegetarian if you use plant based meat...so that's up to you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/nw2v7n/swedish_meatballs/", "created_utc": 1623263602.0, "score": 71, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/nw2v7n/swedish_meatballs/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Battered and fried zucchini", "selftext": "Okay, this one might be a little less easy but still not that hard. \n\nThis recipe is for battered and fried zucchini slices. It\u2019s not that quick but it tastes quite good. Like everything else that is fried. \n\n I also made a video explaining every step.  [Video](https://youtu.be/kmba1SIDyzI) (recipe starts at 1:03 and ends at about 4:35)\n\nEstimated time: 18-24min, serving 2 people.\n\nIngredients: \n\n1 Zucchini\n\n3 Eggs\n\nHalf a cup of Flour\n\n100 grams of Cornstarch / little less than half a cup\n\n2 teaspoons of smoked paprika\n\n1 teaspoon of salt\n\n1 teaspoon of ground black pepper\n\n1 teaspoon of garlic powder\n\n   \n \n\nSlice the zucchini into slices that are about 1-1,5 cm (half an inch) thick.\n\nCrack the eggs and put them into a deep plate where you can whisk them with the smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and garlic. Add the cornstarch to the mix. I would advise you to sieve the starch in, to reduce the number of clumps. Once the batter is prepared you need one more deep plate in which you can pour the Flour. \n\nPut a pan on the stove at medium to high heat and pour some oil in. Not too much you can add more later. \n\nTake the zucchini slices and thoroughly cover them with flour on both sides and then put them into the batter, flip them once and take them out. Hover the slice over the batter to drain the excess batter. Then and the battered slice to the frying pan. About 2-3 min per side but that heavily depends on the thickness of the slices. Once the batter is gold brown on both sides you are finished. Enjoy. \n\nSome Notes: \n\nYou can salt the zucchini slices once cut to reduce the moisture and probably prevent them from becoming overly soggy after frying but you don\u00b4t have to.\n\nYou can add any other spices you want to the batter.\n\nFor adding the corn starch, you could dissolve it in water to avoid clumps but that will make the batter more watery and less thick. \n\nIf the battered slice starts to fry immediately upon putting it into the pan, perfect if not the oil was not hot enough. You can test this with anything wooden. Just hold it into the oil and if there are bubbles forming at the wood the temperature is good. \n\nIf you want a reference on how I made it, I\u2019ll happily share my video with you just DM me. \n\nSlicing zucchini: 3min\n\nmixing the batter: 3min\n\nfrying the zucchini: 12-18 min (depends on the size of zucchini and therefore the number of slices and the size of the pan. 1 Zucchini = 10-15 slices, 5-6 slices fit in a pan. 2-3 min each side.

You don\u2019t need to use chicken breast sausage, eggs, or bacon you can use some kind of cheese if you want to. The Tomato slices are optional as well. You can even exchange the salad-mayo-mustard mixture for coleslaw. I just want to encourage you to try it out and develop a good understanding for yourself. \n\nSharing an easy and tasty sandwich recipe, everyone can make.\n\n I also made a video explaining every step.

Each of the tasks can be done simultaneously. Boil the eggs for at least 8min to make sure they are cooked through. I fry the bacon inside the microwave on a plate with a paper towel to soak the excessive fat that the bacon releases while cooking. Depending on your microwaves power it can take between 1 1/2 min - 3 min. If you do it for the first time watch the bacon closely. Wash the tomato and the salad leaves. Cut the tomato into thin slices starting from the bottom and chop towards where the stem used to be. Make sure to get rid of as much excess water as possible from the salad leaves after washing. Chop the salad leaves into thin strips and add them to a bowl. Mix them with the mayo and the mustard until the salad strips are covered. If the eggs are finished boiling put them in some cold water or rinse them under a cold-water stream. Once the eggs are cool enough to handle, crack the shell and start peeling them once peeled try to cut them thinly. Cutting eggs thin is not easy just try your best. Once the bacon is finished frying we can start the assembling process. \n\nStart with a slice of toast. Add 2 slices of chicken breast sausage. On top that add a loaded spoon of the salad, mayo, mustard mixture. Top it with another slice of toast. Add the salad, mayo, mustard mixture again. Then a slice of the tomato, some of the egg slices. Once the eggs are on you can season them with some salt and pepper. Add the Bacon stripes and finish the sandwich with a slice of toast. To make it stable you can pierce the sandwich with 2 toothpicks diagonally. Cut the sandwich diagonally between the 2 toothpicks.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n   \n \n\nI would advise you to at least make a couple of sandwiches to justify the amount of work you got to do.\n\nThe time calculations are pretty depending on how many you want to make. With the minimum time depending on the boiling time for the eggs and the maximum depending on the amount of toast you got to toast. So, my calculations are for about 6 sandwiches. Which is almost equal to a pack of toast.\n\nCan be done at the same time:\n\n\\[\n\n20min Toasting.\n\n10-20min for the bacon, this varies greatly.\n\n10-12 min cooking eggs\n\n15min for cleaning and chopping vegetables.\n\n\\]\n\n10min assembling the sandwiches", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wby7ua/easy_and_amazing_sandwich/", "created_utc": 1659189683.0, "score": 75, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wby7ua/easy_and_amazing_sandwich/", "html_title": ""}

Bring to a boil and cook uncovered for 25 to 30 minutes. \n\n\u2022 While the soup is coming to a boil, chop the fresh Dill and parsley and set aside.\n\n\u2022 Now, add the potatoes, shredded cabbage and 3/4 of the fresh Dill and parsley (save the rest for garnishing the Borsht when ready to serve). Add sugar, salt and pepper. Stir. Lower the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid. Simmer for 15 minutes and the Borsht is ready to serve! Serve with a large dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with fresh Dill and Parsley. Enjoy!\n\n***** GTEAT TIP! To save on prep time, buy pre-shredded carrots and pre-shredded cabbage at the grocery store. \n\nShort step-by-step video recipe available upon request incase you need visual.

It's quick and easy to make (40 minutes and one pot!), it's packed with the delicious flavours of fresh peaches, fresh basil, runny honey and a reduced balsamic vinegar, and it's healthy!\n\nYou can find the recipe video here, which includes a few handy tips and tricks! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyGD9mwdumg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyGD9mwdumg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 1Kg (2.2lbs) chicken thighs\n* 4 peaches\n* 30ml (2 tbsp.) runny honey\n* 120ml (1/2 cup) balsamic vinegar \n* 130-160ml (2/3 cup) chicken stock\n* 6 garlic cloves, minced\n* 60ml (4 tbsp.) olive oil\n* 1g (1/2 tsp.) black pepper\n* 11g (2 tsp.) salt\n* a few basil leaves (for decoration)\n\n\\-----\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200C (400F). De-stone 4 peaches and slice them into wedges. I like to leave the skins on, as this adds a beautiful colour to the dish! Now skin and crush 6 cloves of garlic.  \n\n2. Pat down your chicken thighs (or breasts!) with kitchen roll to remove any moisture and then season generously with salt and black pepper.\n\n3. To a large oven-safe pan, add 60ml (4 tbsp.) olive oil and heat on medium-high. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add your chicken skin side down. Season the other side of the chicken thighs/breasts with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. Once the skin begins to brown, flip the chicken over \u2013 and when the underneath has also browned, move the thighs/breasts to a clean plate. The chicken will not be cooked through at this stage.\n\n4. Let\u2019s make the sauce! Into the pan we\u2019ve just used, add your crushed garlic to the chicken fat. Let it cook for around 60 seconds before adding 130-160ml (2/3 cup) chicken stock, 30ml (2 tbsp.) runny honey and 120ml (1/2 cup) balsamic vinegar. Let the sauce reduce down by half. \n\n5. Now add in your peaches! Let them cook in the sauce for 5 minutes before adding the chicken. If there\u2019s any chicken juice on the plate, pour that in too! It\u2019s all flavour! Nestle the chicken into the peaches, but be sure the top of the chicken pieces are exposed. \n\n6. Place the pan into your pre-heated oven and cook for 25-30 minutes \u2013 or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165F (74C).\n\n7. For the finishing touch, let\u2019s chiffonade some basil! Take approximately 10 leaves of basil, stack them, roll them into a cigar shape and then finely chop into thin slices. You should be left with strings of basil!\n\n8. As soon as your chicken comes out of the oven, sprinkle on your basil \u2026 and serve!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love the ease and convenience of one pot chicken dishes! A delicious meal followed by less washing up afterwards is always a winner in my book! If you don\u2019t like peaches, be sure to check out my \u2018Marry Me\u2019 chicken recipe, which is very similar to Tuscan chicken.

{"title": "The NOT Jennifer Aniston Salad! \ud83c\udf4b\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "This is my take on the famous and trending Jennifer Aniston salad recipe! Jennifer has recently debunked the myth that she ate this salad on the set of Friends everyday for 10 years, so you could say this is the 'Not Jennifer Aniston Salad'! However all I can say is, she's missing out! This salad is healthy, delicious and super easy to make!\n\nYou can easily make this Jennifer Aniston salad recipe vegan by omitting the feta cheese - and if you still want that briny salty flavor, add olives instead! Want to make this gluten free? Substitute the bulger wheat for quinoa!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, my recipe video is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mqdp713ZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mqdp713ZE)\n\n\\-----**Ingredients**  \n\n\n* 200g (1 cup) bulger wheat, uncooked\n* 120g (1 cup) cucumber\n* 52g (1/2 cup) red onion\n* 30g (1/2 cup) parsley\n* 8g (1/4 cup) mint\n* 250g (1 cup) feta cheese\n* 425g (15oz) chickpeas\n* 50g (1/2 cup) pistachios\n* 60ml (1/4 cup) lemon juice\n* 30ml (2 tbsp.) olive oil\n* salt and pepper to season\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. To a saucepan full of boiling water, add a good sprinkling of salt - as if you were cooking pasta - and the add 200g bulger wheat. Be sure to check the cooking times on the packaging of your bulger wheat, but mine took around 10-15 minutes to cook.\n2. Prep your vegetables! I like to cut my cucumbers lengthwise and then remove the seeds within with a teaspoon. I then cut the de-seeded cucumbers widthwise into semi-circles. Next, finely chop 50g of red onion. **Tip:** If you find raw onion a bit too strong in terms of flavour, simply soak the onion pieces in a bowl of water for 15 minutes, before you use them in this (or any other!) recipe!\n3. Deshell and finely chop your pistachios. If you can find pistachios that have already been deshelled, this will save you some time! Next, wash and chop your parsley and mint.\n4. Onto the dressing! Freshly squeeze 60ml of lemon juice and sieve the liquid to ensure no pips are included! **Tip:** A great way to get the most juice out of a lemon is to simply microwave the lemon for 20 seconds!\n5. To the lemon juice, add 2 tbsp. good quality extra virgin olive oil, 2 tsp. salt and a good amount of freshly cracked black pepper.\n6. Your bulger wheat should be ready! Simply strain the bulger wheat in a sieve and then place the sieve over the hot, empty pan. Any excess steam will help dry out the bulger wheat.\n7. Into a large bowl, add your bulger wheat and all of your vegetables! Next, add in 425g chickpeas and crumble 250g feta cheese over the top. Pour in your dressing and give the salad a good toss!\n8.

{"title": "GARLIC BUTTER CHICKEN THIGHS. This recipe is super easy; delicious; it always comes out perfectly; and it uses very common ingredients that you probably already have. ", "selftext": "This recipe:\n\n\\* Is super easy\n\n\\* Is delicious -- it always turns out perfectly, and everyone loves it.\n\n\\* Uses ingredients you probably have around the kitchen already\n\n\n\n**Equipment:**\n\nA skillet that can go in the oven. I use one of those handle-less cast iron pans lined with ceramic. It's 13 or 14 inches across, and holds about 7 thighs. But I think a plain cast-iron skillet would work just as well.\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, thawed. I get the Foster Farms frozen ones, very cheap at Costco (and I assume other places as well). I cook 7 at a time because that is what my cast-iron skillet will hold.\n2. Olive oil or any other cooking oil\n3. About 2 TBSP minced garlic. (I've taken to just buying the big jars of it. I put half in a mason jar in my fridge, and freeze the rest.)\n4. About 1/4 cup butter\n5. Salt and pepper\n6. Parsley (Strictly optional, mainly just for appearance)\n\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400F\n2. Heat some olive oil at medium high in an oven-proof skillet (ideally one with a lid).\n3. Pat dry the chicken thighs. Generously salt and pepper both sides.\n4. When the oil is hot, put the thighs in SKIN SIDE DOWN. Cook them at med-high for 10 minutes, or long enough to make the skin crispy and golden-brown. Resist the urge to move them around!\n5. Flip the thighs over, so the skin is up. Reduce heat (because you are about to put in garlic, and don't want to burn it).\n6. Make some space in the pan and put in the butter and the garlic. (You can also brown the garlic in a separate pan and then add it to the skillet, if that works better for you.) Move the thighs around so the oil/butter/garlic mixture is spread more or less evenly around the pan.\n7. Cook on stove at reduced heat for 5-6 minutes, enough to brown the garlic.\n8. Pplace in oven for 40 minutes. It will come out perfectly. During this time you can make a salad or rice or whatever else you want.\n9. When ready to serve, spoon some of the oil/butter/garlic sauce over the chicken and sprinkle a little parsley on it.\n\nCredit: I got this recipe from [primaverakitchen.com](https://primaverakitchen.com)\n\nI hope you like it!

{"title": "Granola Using Instant Oatmeal", "selftext": "I had a lot of leftover instant oatmeal packets in my house that was just past the best by date or in flavors that my household didn't really like and weren't eating. Solution - turn it into granola to eat on yogurt. Much, much cheaper than storebought granola, and the flavor that wasn't good in the texture of oatmeal was better when baked on something crunchy!  \n\n\nINGREDIENTS:  \n\\- Instant oatmeal - flavored is fine, unflavored is fine, whatever you have in the house.  \n\\- Maple syrup and/or honey - about 1 Tablespoon per cup of oatmeal.  \n\\- If oatmeal is unflavored: cinnamon, nutmeg, salt.  \n\\- Optional: chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans are good), dried fruit (raisins or craisins)  \n\n\nDIRECTIONS:  \n\\-Preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit.  \n\\-Pour oatmeal into a large bowl. If using flavored oatmeal, remove any large clumps of sugar/cinnamon/flavor mix. If using unflavored, add a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg per cup of oatmeal and a pinch of salt per cup of oatmeal. If adding nuts, add nuts now.  \n\\- Add maple syrup and/or honey, about 1 tablespoon per cup of oatmeal, and mix well. I like to use half maple syrup, half honey as I don't like an overpowering maple flavor but also saves me from using so much honey as it's expensive!  \n\\- Add the syrup/honey slowly and mix between each spoonful - you want enough that the oatmeal begins to stick together, but not enough that there are any pools of liquid. Add a few more spoonfuls if necessary. It's okay if there are a few dry spots.  \n\\- Spread out evenly on a baking sheet (with parchment paper is best to avoid sticking).  \n\\- Bake for 20-30 minutes, giving it a stir every 10 minutes. It will be harder to spread out evenly as it begins to harden and stick together, this is okay and creates those yummy chunks of granola, but do spread as evenly as possible after each stir.  \n\\- When the oatmeal begins to turn golden brown and most of it is this color, remove from the oven. It may still be a little sticky, but let it sit for 10 minutes and see if it becomes crunchy. If not, you can put back in for 10 more minutes.  \n\\- After cooling, if adding dried fruit, add now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/13jonth/granola_using_instant_oatmeal/", "created_utc": 1684290234.0, "score": 70, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/13jonth/granola_using_instant_oatmeal/", "html_title": ""}

My easy cinnamon buns recipe can be baked to be devoured the same day, or you can store them raw overnight in the fridge, ready to be baked hot and fresh the next morning!  \n\n\nIf you're a visual learner, be sure to check out my recipe demonstration video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMFcMHipYIQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMFcMHipYIQ)\n\n\\-------  \n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n**Dough**  \n11g active dry yeast or instant yeast  \n244ml whole milk, lukewarm   \n100g granulated sugar  \n75g butter, unsalted, softened  \n1 tsp. salt  \n2 eggs  \n500g plain flour (or all-purpose flour)   \n\n\n**Filling**  \n220g  brown sugar   \n5 tbsp. cinnamon   \n100g butter, unsalted, softened   \n\n\n**Cream Cheese Frosting**  \n89g butter, unsalted, softened   \n180g powdered sugar (also known as icing sugar or confectioner's sugar)    \n100g cream cheese, at room temperature   \n1/2 tsp. vanilla extract   \na pinch of salt  \n\n\n**Time:** 3 hours (including proving time)  \n**Baking:** 25-30 minutes at 180C / 350F  \n**Serves:** 12 cinnamon rolls\n\n\\-------  \n\n\n**Method:**  \n\n\n*Dough*\n\n1. Warm milk to body temperature. Add yeast to warm milk, stir and let it start to bubble. To a large bowl (or a stand mixer) add flour, sugar, and salt. Mix until combined. Add in the milk/yeast mixture, and your eggs, and stir (or mix on medium low in your mixer) until a dough begins to form.\n2. Once all of your ingredients have come together, slowly add in pieces of your butter. If doing this by hand, I like to turn it out onto my work surface and use my hands to bring it all together. Once the butter is incorporated, continue kneading your dough until it is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes. You can check it\u2019s fully kneaded by doing a window pan test \u2013 pull up a piece of your dough with both hands, and gently stretch it apart until you can see the light through it. If it doesn\u2019t tear, you\u2019re ready for your dough to rest. Let it rest in a buttered or oiled bowl for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. \n3. Lightly flour your work surface, and roll your dough until it\u2019s an 18 inch wide rectangle, about \u00bc inch thick. Keep your edges as straight as possible for the most even buns.  \n\n\n*Filling*\n\n1. Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon.\n2. Thinly spread softened butter onto your rolled out dough, leaving about an inch closest to you with no butter. Generously sprinkle with the brown sugar mix and pat it down so it sticks to the butter.\n3. Beginning at the farthest edge, roll the dough toward you as tightly as possible, to make that classic swirl. Once you reach the uncovered inch, pinch the uncovered bit of dough to your roll to seal it together.\n4. Mark your dough in 2 inch segments. Using unwaxed dental floss or strong thread, slide it under the dough log and bring the ends together to slice through. This will give you the cleanest cut.\n5. *(Now is a perfect time to refrigerate them in you want them in the morning! Pull them out in the morning and let them come to room temperature while you preheat the oven.)*\n6. Cover the buns and let them rest for 30 minutes. Preheat your oven to 180C / 350F. These will bake for 25-30 minutes until they are golden brown.  \n\n\n*Cream Cheese Frosting*\n\n1. Mix together butter and cream cheese until very smooth. Sift in your powdered sugar (we don\u2019t want any lumps!). To this, add a pinch of salt and your vanilla. Mix on low speed until all of the sugar has been absorbed. Then whip the icing for 5-8 minutes, until it looks like whipped cream.\n2. Once your buns come out of the oven, slice between them to make it easier to pull them out. Slather the buns with half of the frosting while still hot. Once they\u2019ve cooled slightly, spread remaining icing on top.  \n\n\nThe hardest part is not eating the whole pan at one time!

This French alpine dish is creamy, luxuriously cheesy, and super easy to make at home! This is a traditional French tartiflette recipe, but I offer a few suggestions and variations, so don't worry if you don't have Reblochon cheese at hand, or you'd rather keep this dish alcohol free. \n\nIf you're a visual learner, be sure to check out my recipe demonstration video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGqq0oRBvFU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGqq0oRBvFU)\n\n\\-------  \n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n* 1Kg (approx. 5 large) potatoes\n* 250g smoked bacon lardons\n* 40g butter\n* 1 large white onion\n* 60ml white wine (or chicken stock)\n* 200g Reblochon cheese (or alternative cheese)\n* a grating of nutmeg\n* salt and pepper to season\n\n**Time:** 40 minutes  \n**Baking:** 20 minutes at 180C / 350F  \n**Serves:** 2 people\n\n\\-------\n\n**Method:**  \n\n\n1. Peel and slice your potatoes into 1cm thick slices. Place your potato slices into a pot of cold water, making sure the potatoes are thoroughly covered, salt generously and bring to a boil.\n2. Add your smoked bacon lardons to a saut\u00e9 pan and cook on a medium heat, until the fat begins to render.\n3. Now to prepare your onion! Cut it in half, cut the top and bottom off, peel the skin, and then slice in the opposite direction of the top and bottom of the onion. You'll want to slice the onion as thinly as possible. The result should be long, thin strips of onion!\n4. Once your potatoes yield to a knife, drain them, and then place the colander back onto the pot to steam the potatoes further.\n5. Remove your lardons and place them onto a plate. Add the butter to the saut\u00e9 pan. Be sure to scrap off the fond left behind from the lardons! That's where all the flavour is! Add in your onions. Your onions will take around 10-15 minutes to cook.\n6. Now for the cheese! It's traditional to use Reblochon cheese, but you can use Raclette or a strong triple cream Brie. It's also traditional to cut the cheese in half horizontally - and that's it! However I like to cut mine into 1cm cubes, so that the cheese mixes in with all the other ingredients and melts throughout the dish!\n7. Season your onions with pepper and a grating of nutmeg, then add in your wine! I like to use a Cave de Beblenheim Kleinfels Riesling (\u00a310.99, Waitrose UK), which comes from the same region of France as the Reblochon! If you'd like to keep this dish alcohol free, use chicken stock instead.\n8. Once the wine has reduced by half, add in your bacon lardons, potatoes and cheese! Mix thoroughly, then bake for 20 minutes at 180C / 350F.\n9.

{"title": "One of my favorite Easy Veggie Soup Recipe!", "selftext": "So soup... anyone loves soup? I know I do, especially when is kinda cold outside, I always like to have some soup every week.\n\nFor me there's the simple way of making soup of getting the vegetables cut in some cubes or shapes and put them in the water to boil with some spices, or put them in a pan with a little butter to brown them a little and then in the water.\n\nI prefer browning them in the pan most of the time for some extra flavors. And well I know there are more ways to make a soup, but these are my main 2 simple ways of making it.\n\n[Recipe video](https://youtu.be/ZywPU4JJOqY) if needed  \n[Pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/0pjMKcf)\n\nIngredients : \n\n120gr parsnip, 260gr yellow/red bell pepper, 150gr carrots, 330gr potato, 220gr yellow onion, 10gr hot green pepper, 5 garlic cloves (or more).\n\nThen we have 1tsp of Dill, Basil, Pepper, Smoked Paprika (Or simple paprika, but the smoked flavor goes great in the soup), and 2-4 tsp of salt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor additional flavors I like to add instant soup cubes (Bouillon cubes veggie flavor) and even instant ramen flavor packs. I used a chicken and a hot chili instant ramen condiments. You can totally skip these if you just want a nice soup, but I really recommend playing with them as they're usually really cheap, and add a lot of flavor to your soup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I did for this soup. Cut everything in small bite size cubes or pieces, put some butter in a pan with a little oil, and add the vegetables to it. Let them cook at medium to high heat, mix occasionally and let them get little of that brown color. Put them in around 1L of water and let them cook there for another 20-30 minutes. Check on them, and when the carrot/potato is soft enough the soup is ready. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA small tip, don't have random sizes of vegetables, especially in parsnip, carrot or potato. These takes the most time to cook and you want them in equal pieces.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nServe everything on some olive oil on top or skip that step, add some croutons maybe, or garlic bread :) and enjoy it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/l736t0/one_of_my_favorite_easy_veggie_soup_recipe/", "created_utc": 1611855022.0, "score": 65, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/l736t0/one_of_my_favorite_easy_veggie_soup_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

A mixture of quality veal, pork mince and beef mince, combined with good sprinkling of parsley, breadcrumbs, and parmesan cheese, results in the most delicious and moist Italian meatballs you've ever had!  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhNkvgpyps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhNkvgpyps)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n800g ground veal  \n800g ground beef  \n400g ground pork  \n4 eggs  \n240g parmesan cheese, grated  \n340g breadcrumbs  \n2 tsp. onion flakes  \n4 tsp. garlic powder  \n2 tsp. salt  \n8 tsp. parsley, finely chopped  \n220ml milk  \nolive oil, for hands/rolling\n\n\\-----  \n\n\n**Method**\n\n1. To a large bowl, add 800g ground veal, 800g ground beef and 400g ground pork. Give this a thorough mix by hand until all the meats are fully combined! \n\n2. Finely chop your parsley and add it to your meat mixture, along with 4 eggs, 2 tsp. onion flakes, 4 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. salt, 240g parmesan cheese (grated), 340g breadcrumbs and 220ml milk. Thoroughly combine these ingredients altogether. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when the mixture is cohesive in colour throughout!\n\n3. I\u2019d recommend cooking a small amount of your mixture in a frying pan, to check to see if it needs any additional seasonings. A great tip is to flatten the meat in the frying pan, so it cooks quicker! Adjust to your taste.\n\n4. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F.\n\n5. Pour some olive oil into a small bowl and dip your fingers into it before you begin rolling your meatballs. Squeeze the mixture tightly in your hands, otherwise you run the risk of your meatball falling apart whilst baking! I usually make my meatballs approx. 2\u201d in diameter \u2013 between a golf ball and a tennis ball!\n\n6. Place on a baking tray and cook for 45 minutes, or until they have a nice golden crust on top.\n\n7. And enjoy!! I like to place my meatballs into a rich, homemade tomato sauce for a minimum of 20-30 minutes to absorb additional flavours, and then I serve with my favourite pasta and a generous grating of parmesan!  \n\n\n**Storage:**\n\n**This recipe makes a lot of meatballs!** Meatballs need to be stored raw; not after cooking. Store your raw meatballs by lining a baking tray with parchment paper, placing the meatballs onto the paper, and then freeze them for 12 hours. Once 12 hours has elapsed, transfer the meatballs into zip lock bag and they will keep for up to 2 months. I\u2019d recommend writing the date you made the meatballs on the side of the bag!\n\n**Cooking from Frozen:**\n\nBake in the oven at 180C | 375F for 45 minutes, then transfer to a tomato sauce and cook for a further 20-30 minutes \u2013 and enjoy!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a firm favourite and has been passed down through generations of my family. Give these Italian meatballs a try and I bet they will become a favourite with your family too!

{"title": "Tagliatelle Bolognese", "selftext": "This is based on [Gennaro Contaldo\u2019s Tagliatelle Bolognese](https://youtu.be/qdZEhkJcJe4) and produced a dish I would rate as \u2018f\u2014ing delicious\u2019 my highest rating. The lowest part of my highest rating. I do not reproduce things exactly, instead I get a general impression and then make things in a way I am comfortable with using ingredients I have on hand. In particular I used store bought flavored tomato pasta sauce and beef stock. I believe that those alone do not make a dish and so there is some technique depicted here and that those also prevent the dish from needing to simmer for an hour to develop flavor.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 2 Cups Tagliatelle (or Spaghetti, Linguine, Penne or etc.)\n* 2 Cups Tomato Pasta Sauce (or 2 Tbsp Tomato paste)\n* 4 Cups Beef Stock (or Water)\n* 0.25 Pounds Ground Beef\n* 1 Cup Mushrooms\n* 1.5 Teaspoon Butter\n* 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil\n* 2 Tablespoons Parsley\n* 2 Tablespoons Cheese (Parmesan, Romano)\n* 1 Teaspoon Italian Seasoning (Marjoram, Rosemary, Thyme, Savory, Sage, Oregano, Basil)\n* 1 Teaspoon Red Pepper Chili Flakes (or Cayenne, Paprika, Chili, etc.)\n* 1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder\n* 1/2 Teaspoon Cumin\n* 1/4 Teaspoon Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Teaspoon Salt\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Bring the Beef Stock to a boil and add rinsed Tagliatelle pasta. Boil for 4 minutes or as instructed. Pasta should be \u2018almost done\u2019. I use the Beef Stock here to simplify the steps. Set aside.\n\n2. Mix Mushrooms with Italian Seasoning, Garlic Powder, 1/2 of the Salt and Black Pepper, and Olive Oil, and stir fry the Mushrooms at 300^o until they give up their water, at 1 minute intervals to produce caramelization. Approximately 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\n3. Mix ground beef with Cumin, Salt, Pepper, and Red Pepper Chili flakes, and stir fry at 300^o until browned at 2 minute intervals to produce caramelization. Approximately 6 minutes. Set aside.\n\n4. Bring 1/2 Cup of Beef Broth (from pasta water) to a boil and reduce halfway until it becomes nearly a syrup. Add Tomato Sauce. Mixture should be \u2018too runny\u2019 but not watery and need to be boiled down to make a sauce. If it is watery boil it down vigorously. If it is done too soon add more Beef Stock because it\u2019s important to boil it down to develop flavor.\n\n5. Add mushrooms and ground beef and continue boiling down more gently. Here you can get the sauce perfect because at this stage the sauce can be simmered for a long time to reduce.\n\n6. When sauce is essentially done add 1/2 of the cheese. Add parsley, and butter. Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper as desired.\n\n7. Add pasta, toss together and continue boiling down if necessary until pasta is fully cooked and sauce reaches desired consistency.\n\n8. Serve on a plate with remaining cheese.\n\nEnjoy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10km1lq/tagliatelle_bolognese/", "created_utc": 1674609114.0, "score": 65, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10km1lq/tagliatelle_bolognese/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How To Make Perfect Vegetable Tempura At Home! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "According to my husband, vegetable tempura is the tastiest way to eat vegetables! Tempura is a favourite appetizer in Japanese restaurants, and a dish I used to order on a regular basis, but it's surprisingly cheap and simple to make at home!\n\nI also show you how to make Tentsuyu, a traditional dipping sauce for tempura, which is full of umami! This isn't the healthiest way to eat vegetables, but it's a lovely treat to enjoy from time to time!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my vegetable tempura recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azP5Sf66Pfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azP5Sf66Pfs)\n\n\\-----\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Tempura**140g cornflour / cornstarch60g plain flour (*plus more for dusting!*)160ml sparkling watervegetable oil (*for frying*)vegetables! (*I'm using carrots, eggplant, broccoli, king mushrooms, sweet potatoes, asparagus and potatoes*)\n\n**Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce**250ml dashi60ml (1/4 cup) soy sauce60ml (1/4 cup) mirin rice wine\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with our Tentsuyu dipping sauce! To a sauce pan, add your dashi\\*, mirin rice wine and soy sauce. Gently heat this mixture up to bring all the flavours together and then set it aside for later. \\**I use dashi concentrate. If you have dashi concentrate, follow the instructions to make a 250ml mixture. In my case, it was roughly 1:10 dash to water mix, so I did 25ml dashi and 225ml water. You can also find dashi pre-made, so just use 250ml of the liquid! Alternatively, you can cook shiitake mushrooms in hot water until the water turns a dark brown colour. You can then use 250ml of this water as your dashi substitute!*\n2. Prep your vegetables! I\u2019m using carrots, eggplant, broccoli, king mushrooms, sweet potatoes, asparagus and potatoes. I like to cut my carrots and mushrooms into thin 5mm thick strips, the eggplant and sweet potatoes into thin roundels, and I grate my potatoes with a cheese grater!\n3. Fill a large saut\u00e9 pan with vegetable oil, approximately 1 inch deep, and heat. You\u2019ll want the oil to reach 180C | 360F in temperature. You can also test to ensure the oil is hot enough by dropping some of your tempura batter into the oil. If the batter sizzles and rises to the surface, your oil is ready for cooking!\n4. Now for the tempura batter! In a bowl, add 140g cornflour (or cornstarch) and 60g plain flour. Give it a quick mix, then add 160ml sparkling water and a handful of crushed ice. Keeping your batter cold is very important!\n5. The best method to mix this batter is with 4 chopsticks held together. You then make a \u2018stabbing\u2019 motion up and down to mix the ingredients; do not stir! If you don\u2019t have chopsticks, I\u2019d highly recommend getting some for this step! However if you really cannot find any chopsticks, I\u2019d use the handle end of a wooden spoon \u2026\n6. Once your mixture looks like double cream / heavy cream in consistency, it\u2019s ready! Simply dip your vegetables into a bowl of plain flour, covering them generously, and then place your vegetables into your batter, making sure to cover every surface! Carefully place them into the oil. I like using my chopsticks to \u2018sprinkle\u2019 some additional batter mix onto the cooking vegetables, as this adds some lovely crispy and crunchy bits!\n7. Turn your vegetables every now and again. The batter is quite light in colour, but it should turn to a light golden brown. Once light golden brown, place on a cooling rack with some paper towels beneath, just to allow any excess oil to drip off!\n8. Every now and again, scoop out any excess batter pieces floating in your oil \u2013 and continue cooking your vegetables! I like to dip a large amount of the grated potato into the flour, then the batter, and then I take small handfuls and fry individually as little \u2018nests\u2019!\n9. Reheat your sauce, serve and enjoy! (*If you like your tempura as warm as possible, you can place your finished fried vegetables into an oven at a low temperature, whilst you continue frying the other vegetables!*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, feel free to ask below and I'll try and answer them as soon as possible!

Easy recipe", "selftext": "**Ingredients ( 8 flat breads ):**  \nPotatoes (mashed ) - 400g ( 2-3 medium size potatoes )  \nMilk ( warm temperature ) - 1 cup  \nInstant dry yeast - 2 \u00bd teaspoon ( make sure it is not expired )  \nSalt - 1 \u00bc teaspoon  \nFlour ( all purpose ) - 3 \u00bd cup  \nSugar - 1 tablespoon  \nAvocado or olive oil - 1 tablespoon for the dough  \nFor frying: large skillet, avocado or canola oil.  \nFor toppings: \u2153 stick of butter, 4-5 garlic cloves, chopped dill and sour cream\n\n**if you are a visual learner, I have a step by step video as well:** [**https://youtu.be/E\\_KBfxq5bHg**](https://youtu.be/E_KBfxq5bHg)\n\n**Step#1**\n\nCombine mashed potatoes, warm milk, dry yeast, salt, sugar, flour and 1 tablespoon of oil in the large mixing bowl. Combine all the ingredients and using a stand mixer knead the dough. It could take up to 10min. Kneading with hands will take a lot longer. Knead the dough until it gets smooth and doesn't stick to your hands. You might need to add a bit more flour in the process. Now, transfer the dough into a greased bowl, cover with a towel and let it rest in the warm place for about 1 hour.\n\n**Step#2**\n\nDough is doubled in size. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, shape them in a smooth ball and put on the floured board to rest for another 20 minutes, cover it with the towel. Now we can start making our Langos. Flatten the dough into a circle shape about 6\u201d diameter with your hands. Stretch dough so the center is thinner than the edges. Make a few slits in the middle of the circle, this way bread will not bubble in the center, so you will achieve more consistent frying across the entire surface.\n\n**Step#3**\n\nHeat up the skillet with avocado or canola oil on medium high. Normally you need to deep fry langos, but I will use less oil just enough to cover the surface. Fry the Langos for 2 minutes or until golden on each side.  \nCombine minced garlic with melted butter. Brush Langos with garlic infused butter, sprinkle some salt and now get creative with toppings. For mine, I am using sourcream and dill.  \nNow, let\u2019s do an experiment, and try making Langos in the AirFryer. After playing with temperature and timing I got the best results in 8 minutes frying at 330\u00b0F. I had to flip it half way through.  \nNow, in my opinion the Air Fryer version doesn't look as presentable, bubbly and puffy as the original classic version, it is a bit more dense inside. But it still has an amazing taste, so I would consider it as a much healthier alternative to deep fried langos.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ueo4rj/homemade_langos_in_skillet_vs_air_fryer_l\u00e1ngos/", "created_utc": 1651245289.0, "score": 61, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ueo4rj/homemade_langos_in_skillet_vs_air_fryer_l\u00e1ngos/", "html_title": ""}

Try buying a fresher batch of dried chickpeas next time and make sure you soak them until they're doubled in size and slightly tender.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Some people like to add baking powder or baking soda to the mix to lighten up the texture inside of the falafel balls. I don\u2019t usually add it, since the falafel is generally pretty fluffy on its own. If you would like to add it, stir 1 tsp of baking powder into the falafel mixture after it has been refrigerated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDO NOT substitute with CANNED chickpeas.

The gluten is developed when mixing the flour and water and by later stretching the dough with wet hands. This is a no mess bread, a so called wet-dough, that stays moist for several days after baking. Enjoy.\n\nIngredients  \n550 grams bread flour (mine has between 11-12% gluten)  \n430 ml warm water  \n2 grams dry yeast  \n8 grams salt\n\n1. Mix the yeast and salt with the warm water and let it sit for a couple of minutes to rehydrate.\n2. With a fork, begin to beat in the flour. As in the video, the more flour you add in, the more you'll be able to turn the batter over onto itself. This it to help form the gluten.\n3. Once you've added all the flour, cover and let it rest for half an hour.\n4. Take a bowl of water and place it near your dough. Dip your hands into the water then reach in and pull the dough. Stretch and pull that dough until it's tight. If the dough ever feels sticky, dip your hands back in the water.\n5. Let the dough rest another half hour and repeat the process.\n6. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured workspace and shape the dough (I prefer a loaf pan but round loaf works well.. Dip your hands in water and use a pastry scraper to help you. Resist the urge to add flour!\n7. Let the dough rest for 60-90 minutes, till it has almost trippled.\n8. Bake in a hot 220C/430F for 20 minutes, then turn down the oven to 190C/380F. (Throw a few ice cubes in the oven at the beginning to create steam which helps the bread rise further.)\n9. Let cook on a wire rack and enjoy.  \nNote: I often bake this bread when I have a free morning or afternoon. I let the dough rise 90 minutes each time while I run errands and take care of things, coming back to beat it down. In my opinion, the longer rising times improve the flavor of the finished bread.  \nI also make this early evening and put it in the fridge for the final rise.

This sweet, sticky bacon jam is perfect on burgers as a relish, in your favourite pasta dishes, and will take your BLT, grilled cheese and PB&J sandwiches to the next level!!\n\nI also love adding a good helping of bacon jam to my baked potatoes, as well as on top of cheese and cracker bites! This bacon jam recipe is super easy to make includes maple syrup and bourbon, but bourbon is optional, so feel free to leave it out!\n\nCheck out my recipe video here for more tips and tricks!! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juAz0EjoaUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juAz0EjoaUM)\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 500g smoked bacon\n* 1 white onion\n* 6 shallots\n* 4 dried chilis\n* 2 garlic cloves\n* a healthy grating of nutmeg\n* 2 tbsp. maple syrup\n* 85g brown sugar\n* 2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar\n* 1 tbsp. bourbon (optional)\n* 1 tbsp. soy sauce\n* 100ml strong, black coffee\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Slice 500g of smoked bacon into small pieces and drop into a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat.\n2. Finely chop 1 white onion and 6 shallots.\n3. Be sure to stir the bacon occasionally. If there are any large clumps of bacon, break these up with a wooden spoon. Once the bacon has rendered out the majority of it\u2019s fat, remove the bacon pieces from the pan and place onto a dish.\n4. Add your onions and shallots to the saut\u00e9 pan, and grate into 2 cloves of garlic. These will begin to cook in the bacon fat. Continue cooking until the onions become caramelized.\n5. Now add your bacon pieces back into the saut\u00e9 pan! Add 4 dried chilis. I\u2019ve deseeded my chilis, as I\u2019m not keen on heat, but you can leave the seeds in \u2013 or add a few more chilis!\n6. Add a healthy grating of nutmeg, as well as 2 tbsp. maple syrup, and stir thoroughly.\n7. Once the maple syrup has cooked off and there is no liquid visible in your saut\u00e9 pan, add 85g brown sugar,  2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp. bourbon (optional), 1 tbsp. soy sauce and 100ml strong, black coffee.\n8. Lower your heat to medium-low and let the mixture simmer for 20 minutes \u2013 or until the liquid has become thick and syrupy! You can test this by running a wooden spoon through the mixture; the liquid will take a second or two to return to the centre of the pan.\n9. I like to remove my chilis at this stage, but you can leave them in! Remove the saut\u00e9 pan from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.\n10. **Transfer your bacon jam to a jar and refrigerate**. **Your bacon jam will keep for up to a month.** **Enjoy!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you love this bacon jam as much as I do!

Grind your oats. I made them in a fine powder\n\n 1. Mix the dry ingredients into a bowl\n\n 2. Add the butter that should be COLD and cut in small cubes\n\n 3. Add your vanilla essence, you can use pistachio or almond essence\n\n 4. Brake the butter in the dry ingredients between your fingers, until you get a crumbling consistency\n\n 5. Add your milk 30ml at first and try to make a ball of dough. The milk should also be cold\n\n 6. You should get a dough that sticks together. Of course it is crumbling but it should keep is form. If you need the rest of 10ml of milk add it. \n\n 7. Cover the dough with a plastic sheet, and put it in the fridge for around 1 hour\n\n 8. Put the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper, and press on it with a dough roller to kinda even it out\n\n 9. Start from the middle with the roller and roll your dough. It really depends on how thicc or thin you want your biscuits to be. I really suggest going with thicc boys.\n\n 10. Get something from your home to help with the shape. Go round, rectangle whatever you want. \n\n 11. Add them to a baking tray and be sure their cold before baking them. Also make some small pokes on them but not all the way trough.\n\n 12. Bake them at 180\u00b0C for around 20 minutes. After 15 minutes check on them.\n\n 13. Melt the chocolate and after the biscuits get to room temp, spread some on their back. \n\n 14. If you want a chocolate pattern, take a toothpick and drag it on top of the chocolate to form it.\n\n 15. Put them in the fridge for around 2-3 hours so the chocolate can set.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have some of them more \"burned\" than the others cuz I really need to change the fan of my oven or the whole oven I don't know yet. All I know is that it is super expensive but I'll figure it out. I have uneven heat..so if you know you have problems like this, try to rotate your baking tray in there. Anyway you really need to check on them after 15 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso you can use brown sugar for these, cover the chocolate with coconut flakes, ground almonds, nuts...Add dark or white chocolate to them, be creative!

Prepare your vegetables! I\u2019m cutting my carrots into thin strips, shredding a savoy cabbage, slicing my onions into rounds and finely chopping 3 cloves of garlic! \n\n2. Chop 450g of your favourite protein into bite sized cubes. For this recipe, I\u2019ve chosen to use pork. Add your protein to a hot wok. The fat from the pork will help to cook the meat, but if you\u2019re using a leaner protein or tofu, you\u2019ll want to add some vegetable oil to the wok.\n\n3. Once your pork (or protein) is cooked through and brown, transfer onto a plate and set aside. To the wok, add a splash of vegetable and your onions. Give them a good toss. Once your onions begin to soften, add your garlic \u2013 and 30 seconds later, add in your pork (or protein!). Add a pinch of salt and pepper to season.\n\n4. Tip in all of your vegetables!\n\n5. Once your vegetables have started to wilt, it\u2019s time to make the sauce! Add to the wok 1 tbsp. sugar, 2 tbsp. dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp. oyster sauce (or more soy sauce and sugar if keeping this vegetarian) and 2 tbsp. soy sauce. Give this a little mix before adding 500ml good quality chicken stock (or water if vegetarian).\n\n6. Now for the bihon! Add 225g rice vermicelli noodles to the wok. Press them down to help them absorb the sauce. Your noodles will begin to soften, which is when you\u2019ll want to push them underneath the vegetables and sauce mixture, allowing them to nestle in all those delicious flavours! The noodles won\u2019t take long to cook, but keep your wok on the heat until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed.\n\n7. Once done, add some chopped spring onions to the mix (the green bits only!) and give it a quick stir!\n\n8. Serve with half a lime (Calamansi is traditional) in each dish, to be squeezed over your pancit bihon \u2013 and enjoy! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis dish was so delicious, I've made it a few times since! I might try adding chicken and shrimp next time! As said, Filipino food isn't a cuisine I cook often, but I made this as part of a collaboration challenge. Let me know how I did!

Let natural pressure release for 10 minutes and then release remaining pressure manually. \n\nNow, brush your favorite BBQ sauce on the ribs. I am using sweet and spicy pineapple sauce from Trader Joes. \n\nPut ribs in the oven on a high broil setting for about 5 minutes.

Just mix the cheeses together and fill your cannelloni with it\nYou can either put the use the simple tomato juice as it is, or pre-pare it before hand for a better result.\nTo prepare it before hand, put it in a pan, and get it to a simmer/boil. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar to balance that accidity\nor a spoon depends on how much you gonna use, add some paprika, smoked paprika, basil, oregano, salt, pepper...or just\ncustomize with your favorite spices.\n\nThen add a layer of tomato juice, put your cannelloni filled with cheese, cover them with more cheese. You can do a double layer like I did\nor just cook 1 single layer. I don't really know if there are different sizes of cannelloni out there so you may have\nto adjust the amount of ingredients for yourself.\n\nCover everything with a tin foil and cook into the oven at 180 Celsius for around 20 minutes. Take the foil down\nand see if your cannelloni are soft (they should be covered in tomato juice before putting the tin foil).\nIf they're soft, remove the tin foil, add some cheese on top and cook it for another 5-10 minutes with fan on\nuntil the cheese on top melts or get crispy. And enjoy a warm cheesy meal.\n\nYou can pre-boil the cannelloni, let them cool a bit and then fill them with cheese. But I think that's more work and harder to fill them.\nSo do what you think works better for you.\n\nI hope you gonna enjoy them. \n\nSometimes I love to precook some chicken, and add it to the cheese mixture. Or add spinach. Play with different kind of cheese and get different taste.\nIs really easy to customize this recipe and get something great out of it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/k37so1/easy_cheesy_cannelloni/", "created_utc": 1606648590.0, "score": 57, "author": "zippopwnage", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/k37so1/easy_cheesy_cannelloni/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Hot smoked fish is a great appetizer. How to smoke fish without smoker indoors using 3 easy methods: Air Fryer, Stovetop and Dutch Oven", "selftext": "If you were thinking of making your own smoked fish at home, but don\u2019t have an outdoor smoker or ability to smoke fish outdoors\u2026..don\u2019t look further. I will walk you through 3 simple methods on how to make an amazing smoked fish at the convenience of your own home without need of any specialty smoking equipment. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nSteelhead - 4lb ( you can also use salmon, trout or mackerel )\n\nKosher salt - \u00be of the cup\n\nBrown sugar - \u00be of the cup\n\nGarlic powder - 1 tablespoon ( you can experiment with other spices of your choice )\n\nHoney ( or maple syrup ) - for glazing the fish\n\nWood chips - I am using hickory flavor ( you can also use cherry, maple or apple wood )\n\nLiquid smoke - \u00bd teaspoon ( for Air fryer method only )   \n\n**If you are a visual learner, I do have step by step video guide along with some useful smoking tips:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY) \n\n**Let\u2019s start with brining the fish.** \n\nTake the fish from the fridge. Let\u2019s start by cutting the fish into equal pieces. If you see any bones on the surface, take them out. \n\nMake the brine out of equal proportions of kosher salt and brown sugar. If you like fish that are more salty or more sweet, you can adjust proportions accordingly. Mix in 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. Generously cover the fish with the mixture, close the lid on an air tight container and send it to the fridge for 6-12 hours. I normally do this process the night before. \n\nTake the fish out from the fridge, rinse it well with the cold water, dry it with the paper towel, set it on the rack skin side down and send it to the fridge to dry for about 1 hour. \n\nOk, now the fish are ready for smoking. \n\n**Method #1** Air Fryer: \n\nBefore smoking we need to coat the fish with honey and liquid smoke. \n\nFor this piece of fish use \u00bd teaspoon of liquid smoke, it is highly concentrated, so you don\u2019t need much. \n\nNow, send the fish to the air fryer at 170\u00b0F for at least 1h. It took me 1 hours and 20 minutes for this piece as it is about 2 inch thick. Remember to coat fish again in the middle of the process. When ready, the fish should be at 160F. \n\n**Method #2** Using a stovetop smoker made by Cameron. \n\nGlaze fish with some honey. I like to use sawdust chips, which start to create smoke pretty much right away. I am using hickory flavor, but you can also experiment with cherry, maple or apple wood. \n\nSet the smoker on the stove at medium heat for about 25 minutes. Time will vary based on the size of the fish. \n\n**Method #3** Homemade smoker made out of Dutch oven and some foil\n\nIn this method we will replicate a Cameron stovetop, with dutch oven and a little bit of foil. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have dutch oven, you can also use a deep skillet or a pot.  \n\nTake 2 pieces of foil and lay them inside Dutch Oven with some foil sticking out. Sprinkle sawdust wood chips and cover them up with a piece of foil.  Now put the grilling rack on top. I am using a trivet from my instant pot. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have one available, you can crumble up few pieces of foil and put at the bottom which will elevate the fish inside in a similar way. \n\nNow put glazed fish on top of the rack, fold remaining pieces of the foil very tight, so smoke will not escape and then close the lid of the dutch oven. \n\nSet it on the stove for or 25 minutes or until the fish is 160\u00b0F. Due to the very tight lid and foil, there is almost no smoke going outside the dutch oven, which is a plus when smoking in a less ventilated area.  \n\nAll three versions of the smoked steelhead look and smell amazing. The one from the air fryer looks a bit brighter in color compared to the other 2.  \n\nYou can serve smoked fish hot or cold.  \n\nAs far as a taste, we were not able to see the difference\u2026..all 3 options turned out really good. Personally I didn\u2019t expect that air fryer with liquid smoke version will be on par with traditional stovetop smoking. So, I am quite impressed with the results! \n\nIn summary, all 3 cooking methods work really well and with a minimum amount of effort or cleanup. Air Fryer version took a bit longer compared to stove top but results of all 3 methods were equally good, so use the one you are more comfortable with.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/v8kdgv/hot_smoked_fish_is_a_great_appetizer_how_to_smoke/", "created_utc": 1654791256.0, "score": 53, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/v8kdgv/hot_smoked_fish_is_a_great_appetizer_how_to_smoke/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Usually it will come cooked in a Ttukbaegi (\ub69d\ubc30\uae30) to keep it always hot. This dish is very common in Korea and is eaten a lot for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! One of my childhood foods, I will show you how to make the most basic version. This dish is very customizable and growing up, my mother would put leftover vegetables into the soup.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1.5 - 2 cups of anchovy stock or water\n* 1.5 tbs doenjang (\ub41c\uc7a5) soy bean paste\n* \u00bd onion\n* \u00bd potato\n* 1/4 of the packet tofu\n* 2 pieces of pork belly\n* 2 minced garlic\n* 1 green onion\n* pinch of sugar\n* 1 jalape\u00f1o (spicy version)\n* 1 tbs red pepper powder (spicy version)\n* daikon radish (optional)\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n1. Chop onions and potatoes into small-medium pieces. Chop green onion, jalape\u00f1o, and pork belly. Cube tofu.\n2. In a pot or ttukbaegi (\ub69d\ubc30\uae30), add in onions and stock and bring to a boil. Then add in pork belly, potatoes, and garlic.\n3. Add in doenjang and mix thoroughly into the soup and simmer until potatoes are 75% done.\n4. Add in sugar, jalape\u00f1o, green onions, and red pepper powder, and mix well, simmer for a minute.\n5.

Line the bottom and sides of a 10\" cake pan with parchment/baking paper. \n\n2) Beat eggs in stand/bench mixer with the whisk attachment until they have doubled in size. \n\n3) Melt butter and chocolate together by combining them and putting them into the microwave for 30 second bursts (mixing in between each burst). \n\n4) Fold in a third of the egg mixture into the chocolate mixture. \n\n5) Transfer the chocolate mixture to the remaining egg mixture and fold in. \n\n6) Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and cover the outsides of the pan with foil (see my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zdaH7tmQXA) if you're unsure how to do this). Place pan in a baking dish or roasting pan and add warm water that reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan. \n\n7) Bake the cake for 30-40 minutes. \n\n8) Let the cake cool for about 20 minutes before taking it out of the pan.

Line the bottom and sides of an 8\" cake pan with parchment/baking paper. \n\n2) Place white chocolate in a heatproof bowl and heat in microwave in 30-second intervals (or melt the chocolate over a double boiler), stirring occasionally, until melted. \n\n3) Once the chocolate has melted, stir in the cream cheese. \n\n4) Let the mixture cool slightly, then mix in the egg yolks.\n\n5) Using a bench/stand mixer, whip egg whites until stiff peaks form. \n\n6) Once the stiff peaks have formed, add a 1/3 of the egg whites to the chocolate mixture and stir until lightened in colour. Gently fold in remaining egg whites in 2 additions until just combined.\n\n7) Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and cover the outsides of the pan with foil (see my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zdaH7tmQXA) if you're unsure how to do this).

{"title": "The Very Best Roast Potatoes! (My Tips, Tricks & Secret Ingredient!)", "selftext": "This is an essential side dish for any great Christmas, Sunday Roast or Thanksgiving! The recipe and method is fairly simple, but there are a few tips and tricks to ensure you make the very best roast potatoes every time - including my secret ingredient!\n\nFor my crispy roasted potatoes, I've used duck fat, as it helps prevent the potatoes from becoming soggy and has a fantastic flavour too! If you cannot find duck fat, you can use lard instead. If you'd rather not use any animal products, then vegetable oil is a great substitute!\n\nThe great thing about these crispy roasted potatoes is that you can make them a day in advance! Let them cool to room temperature, cover them, store them in your fridge and reheat in a hot oven for 10-15 minutes the next day.\n\nBe sure to check out my video demonstration here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf88np7BSPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf88np7BSPI)\n\n\\------------------------\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n5 large potatoes, approximately 500g (Red skinned, yellow flesh potatoes are best!)\n\n3 tbsp. duck fat (or lard if you can't find duck fat! Want to keep this animal free? Use vegetable oil!)\n\n1 lemon\n\nPinch of salt\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Serves:** 2-3 people, but you can double the ingredients to serve 5-6 people.\n\n**Time:**  Start to finish, 60 minutes, cooked at 230C (450F).\n\n\\------------------------\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 230C (450F).\n2. Wash and peel your potatoes! I like to use a yellow fleshed, red skinned potato because they hold their shape well when roasted, and remain creamy . You could use a Yukon Gold or Maris Piper potato.\n3. Cut your potatoes at an angle, and only make 2-3 cuts per large potato. The bigger the surface area, the more crispy and crunchy the roast potato!\n4. Place your potatoes into a large pot, cover thoroughly with cold water and turn the heat to high. The cold water helps cook the potatoes more evenly. Add 2 tbsp. salt to the water.\n5. Prep your roasting tin; add 3 tbsp. of duck fat (or alternatives listed above). This is where all the flavour comes from! Place the roasting tin into your oven, so that the fat gets nice and bubbly!\n6. Once your water has started to boil, turn it down to medium heat, so that it's on a gentle simmer. Cook for a further 6-8 minutes, just until your fork will start to go through the potato. Drain in a colander and then place the colander over your pot, allowing the residual steam to dry the potatoes.\n7. Shake your colander to rough up the potato edges, creating additional fluffiness! Now my secret ingredient; squeeze half a lemon over the potatoes!\n8. Place your potatoes in your roasting tin. Flip your potato pieces to ensure a thorough covering of duck fat (or alternative fat).\n9. Into the oven for 25 minutes. Then take them out, give them a flip, season with flaky salt (optional) and back into the oven for another 20 minutes.\n10. Serve and enjoy!\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment! :)\n\nDani, Gordon and Kiki \u2013 Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/rmh3ss/the_very_best_roast_potatoes_my_tips_tricks/", "created_utc": 1640213893.0, "score": 54, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/rmh3ss/the_very_best_roast_potatoes_my_tips_tricks/", "html_title": ""}

Golden brown and crispy everywhere except the breast skin, which can be browned in the last 10-15 minutes by turning the chicken back over.\n\nAn easy recipe because it does not involve flipping or basting the bird every 15 minutes. The only improvement would be to rotisserie the chicken in the bread pan if notches could be cut to let the rotisserie blades rotate and it made to fit so that it picks up and self bastes in its juices.\n\nShown here is a Lemon Pepper, Rosemary and Thyme recipe.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 1 Small Chicken\n* 2 Tbsp Lemon Pepper Seasoning (Lemon Zest, Black Pepper, Salt)\n* 0.125oz Rosemary or 2 Tsp Dried Rosemary\n* 0.125oz Thyme or 2 Tsp Dried Thyme\n* 1 Lemon\n* 1 Tbsp Butter\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Apply Lemon Pepper, Butter, Rosemary and Thyme to the surface, crevices, and to the inside of the Chicken. (NOTE: Fresh herbs are more grassy and full bodied while dried herbs are more roasted and sharp. Dried herbs will burn so possibly place them underneath (which is coincidentally the \u201ctop\u201d of the actual chicken as sitting when served i.e. breast side up)).\n2. Wrap a Lemon in Rosemary and Thyme and stuff into Chicken. (OPTIONAL: This brings out a sweetness mostly to inner parts of chicken.)\n3.

Bake in a preheated oven at 350^o for 50 minutes or until Chicken is golden brown and cooked all the way through.\n\nNOTES:\n\n* As an extra bonus you are righted with a delicious chicken jous in the pan that you can pour out for use in sauces, gravies, rice, and/or (recommended) over the top of the chicken when it is done cooking.\n\n* Some pans such as glass or ceramic have a lower heat conductivity than metal. The time shown was based on a glass bread pan. A metal bread pan may require a time or temperature adjustment.\n\n* I did see a similar technique on a French restaurant show hence the Frenchified English naming, and cooking the chicken upside down was also seen as a tip from some other chef video on television.\n\nEnjoy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10nroac/chicken_in_a_boat_poulet_en_bateau_whole_roast/", "created_utc": 1674945441.0, "score": 55, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10nroac/chicken_in_a_boat_poulet_en_bateau_whole_roast/", "html_title": ""}

Blend everything very well on high to the smooth texture. \n\n**Step#2**\n\nGenerously season the ribs on all sides with kosher salt and pepper. \n\nNow we need to give a good sear to our ribs, caramelize it to a nice brown color. I will start with Instant Pot. Turn Saute mode on Instant Pot, add some oil and when hot add ribs. We need to give ribs a really good sear on all sides. Don\u2019t overcrowd meat, I normally do it in a few batches. \n\nI will follow the same process in the Dutch Oven. On a medium high add ribs to a hot oil and sear on each side. \n\n**Comparison #1** \n\nSearing in a dutch oven is a lot better than Instant Pot. Look at a nice caramelized color from Dutch Oven.    \n\n**Step#3**\n\nNow put meat into the Instant Pot, cover it well with the sauce, and set Instant Pot to manual high pressure for 50 minutes. We will wait for natural release.  So in total time 15min to come to pressure, 50min cook time and 20 min to depresurase, total 1 hour and 30 minutes. \n\nIn the meanwhile we will set up our dutch oven.  Follow the same process by covering meat with the sauce, close the lid and put ribs in the oven for 3 - 4  hours at 290\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Check meat in the process, it is ready when meat is soft and flaking apart. \n\n**Comparison #2** \n\nNothing new, but cooking under pressure in the Instant pot is quite a bit faster then Dutch Oven. 1.5 hours vs 3-4 hours depending on the oven type. \n\n**Step#4**\n\nOpen up Instant Pot when pressure is fully released. Now we can take the ribs out\u2026.meat looks very soft and falls off the bone. As you can see the sauce is quite liquidy, to make it thicker we want to set Instant Pot to Saute mode again for about 15 minutes. Add remaining ginger to the pot and stir it well. While simmering a lot of liquid will evaporate and the sauce will get to desired texture.  \n\nNow, since slow cooking ribs produce a lot of fat, we can reduce sauce fat consistency by getting it through a fat separator.  Alternatively you pour  sauce in the bowl, let it cool down and use the spoon to take out the fat which will float to the top. \n\nI would follow the same process with Dutch Oven. Take the ribs from the oven. They look amazing, and the meat is very soft. Put dutch oven on the stove on low heat, stear in remaining ginger and let it simmer on low heat for another 5-10min. Adding ginger at the end adds a nice flavor to the final product. Sauce from the dutch oven has a much thicker structure compared to Instant Pot so technically you don't need to thicken it. \n\n**Comparison #3** \n\nDue to the longer cooking process in the dutch oven, sauce in the dutch oven has the right consistency already so you don\u2019t need to thicken it. \n\nI like to serve ribs on the bone, it just looks more presentable. It also goes really well with mashed potatoes. Pure some sauce on top, sprinkle green scallions and sesame seeds. \n\nAnd finally conclusion on the taste. Collectively all my guests like the Dutch oven version as it has a bit more flavor. I am not sure if it is related to the presentation of the dish, longer cooking time or better searing. But honestly, the Instant Pot version is not too far apart from dutch oven. \n\nIf I don't have enough time for cooking, the Instant Pot option would be my preference as it is also really really good.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ud5rhz/korean_style_sweet_and_sour_beef_short_ribs_in/", "created_utc": 1651072076.0, "score": 53, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ud5rhz/korean_style_sweet_and_sour_beef_short_ribs_in/", "html_title": ""}

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnalRl661w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnalRl661w)  \n\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Base**\n\n115g (1/2 cup) butter  \n50g (1/4 cup) sugar  \n1 egg  \n38g (5 tbsp.) cocoa powder  \n235g (2 cups) ground digestive biscuits (or Graham crackers)  \n85g (1 cup) desiccated/shredded coconut  \n50g (1/2 cup) walnuts, finely chopped\n\n**Custard Filling**\n\n60g (1/4 cup) butter  \n44ml (3 tbsp.) heavy/double cream  \n30g (2 tbsp.) custard powder  \n245g (2 cups) icing sugar\n\n**Chocolate Topping**\n\n115 (4oz.) dark/bittersweet chocolate, chopped  \n28g (2 tbsp.) butter  \nflaky sea salt\n\n  \n**Serves: Around 12-15 bars**\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Line an 8\u201d square baking pan with parchment paper and place your Digestive biscuits (or Graham crackers) into a food processor. Blend until the mixture resembles a sand-like consistency. You can do this by hand, by placing the biscuits in a food safe bag and hitting them with a rolling pin, but be sure to break up any large pieces of biscuit!\n2. Add 50g walnuts to your processor \u2013 or finely chop with a knife/smash with a rolling pin! Add 85g desiccated coconut to the biscuit-walnut combination and mix!\n3. Place a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of boiling water and after ensuring the water is at a gentle simmer, add 115g butter, 50g sugar and 38g cocoa powder. Stir this mixture until all of the ingredients have melted together and the liquid is smooth and velvety.\n4. Add 2 eggs to the heatproof bowl and stir continuously for 15-30 seconds. Once combined, carefully remove the heatproof bowl from the saucepan and add in your ground biscuit mixture! Stir thoroughly until everything is covered in the chocolate mix.\n5. Pour into your prepared pan. Push the mixture down with a spatula to create a solid first layer. Be sure to get the mixture into each corner.\n6. Time for the custard buttercream! In a bowl, cream 60g butter until smooth, and then stir in 30g custard powder until the mixture is smooth again. Now pour in 245g icing sugar and 44ml double (heavy) cream. Keep stiring until the mixture becomes thick and bright yellow! You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready if you push your finger into the buttercream and it leaves an imprint.\n7. Dollop your custard filling all over your biscuit base. The buttercream can be tricky to spread, so I like to run a metal spoon under some hot water, quickly dry it and use the heat to push the buttercream around. If you lift up any of the biscuit base below, just push it back. Don\u2019t worry; it won\u2019t affect the taste! Push your buttercream layer into all the corners, creating a second flat layer!\n8. Chop 115g dark (semi-sweet) chocolate and add it to a heatproof bowl atop a saucepan filled with water on a low simmer. Add 28g butter and stir until the chocolate has fully melted. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let the chocolate cool to around body temperature.\n9. Pour the chocolate layer onto your custard layer and spread with a spatula. Sprinkle with some sea salt (optional) and chill in a refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\n10. Slice your Nanaimo bars into \u2018brownie-sized\u2019 squares and enjoy!  \n\n\nThere's a reason these are a classic across Canada! I hope you'll love them too! **I do realise there are quite a few ingredients involved and you might not class this as an 'easy' recipe. Apologies if so!** But this recipe is really easy to make and difficult to get wrong!

Start whisking until water becomes frothy.\n* Once all your flavor bases are done, top up with condensed milk so the total liquid is 200 ml.\n* For regular egg tart, just use 200 ml of condensed milK.\n* To the milk and flavor base, add two egg yolks, 2 tbsp sugar, then sift in 2 tsp of cornstarch.\n* Whisk then run mix through a seive to remove any clumps.\n* After 30 min, remove the frozen puff pastry log from the freezer and cut into 12 equal size pieces.\n* With the swirl facing up, press down with the heel of your hand or fingers so the dough gets flattened into a disk.\n* Gently place into a muffin tin (no need to butter or oil), then press into the edges, making sure there are no gaps in the dough.\n* Place the whole muffin tin with dough into the freezer for at least 35 min.\n* Preheat oven to 425F in the meantime.\n* After the dough has been chilled, gently spoon your custard fillings into the cups. No need to chill the custard fillings.\n* Tap the muffin tin against the table so as to remove bubbles from inside the custard, then place in oven.\n* Decrease temperature to 400F and bake for 20 min. check to see how browned tarts are getting after 20 min.\n* If there are brown spots already appearing on the custard, you just have 5 min to go.\n* If tarts are browning too quickly, turn heat off and let tarts sit in the fridge for another 10 min to set.\n* Remove tarts from the oven and let cool for 10-15 min. custards are super hot so be careful!\n* Enjoy while they're still warm but you can easily reheat for 5-6 min at 350F.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/gvgdxo/rose_matcha_milk_tea_and_regular_flavored_egg/", "created_utc": 1591133648.0, "score": 50, "author": "alicecsun", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/gvgdxo/rose_matcha_milk_tea_and_regular_flavored_egg/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Help! Husband only likes processed foods...", "selftext": "My husband and I have totally opposite taste buds. He was raised on highly processed junk foods. I'm not here to argue the health issues around that. I do believe there are no \"bad\" foods, but you ideally should live off of Dino nuggets, mini corn dogs, mac and cheese, frozen Pizzas, and other frozen processed meals. If it were up to him, he'd live off of it. We have a 2 year old now and I want to raise her eating a balanced menu. It would be nice to eat meals as a family, but my husband is beyond picky. I have accepted that I may just need to cook for my daughter and I and he does his own thing, but that isn't without challenges. She is noticing he eats different and asking questions. I don't want to demonize how he eats because I do believe that will just make her want to eat like him. I don't think creating food hierarchy mentality is helpful. However, I also don't want her eating like him. So, I'm attempting to find easy meals that are maybe dupes of \"junky\" food, or recipes that could check his boxes. \n\nWhen not eating highly processed foods, he does like some classic meat and potatoes type meals. Meatloaf, burgers, Shepherd pie, tatertot hot dish (i have a less processed recipe i make), lasagna, spaghetti, tacos, homemade hamburger helper, alfredo, steak... thats about all I can think of. \n\nAny suggestions or recipes would be greatly appreciated!!!\n\nEditing to add: wanting to make it clear my daughter does eat a balanced diet right now. Again, I'm more trying to prevent that from shifting by hopefully finding more meals my husband will eat with us. She loves a variety of fresh and cooked veggies and fruits. She even eats salad haha. She likes soups too. So far, she has a pretty healthy and ideal approach to the processed foods. I think this is because I minimize the stigma around them. I don't talk about them badly or as special treats. They're just other foods we sometimes eat, but not a lot of because eating a lot of them don't make us feel good. She's recently taken a liking to dove chocolate. Sometimes I give her one with dinner, sometimes I tell her it's not on the menu and she accepts it. I'm trying to vary it so she doesn't think we eat sweets with every meal. I also give it to her whenever she wants during the meal. Again, chocolate isn't a special gift she gets after eating what I determine enough food for her. If she asks mid meal, I make sure to tell her she can eat it then, but there isn't more coming after. So far, she eats the small piece and then eats the rest of her dinner.

Add all of the flour to a pan and turn the pan on medium high heat. Using a whisk, start mixing and shaking the pan ever so often.\n2. Continue to roast until the flour is heated through and has darkened ever so slightly. The flour is ready when it smells similar to popcorn and doesn't appear dusty anymore - it should develop some texture. About 12-15 minutes.\n3. Once done, immediately move the pan off the heat. Mix every 2-3 minutes to prevent any residual heat from burning the flour.  \nMaking the cookie dough\n4. Soften the butter by microwaving for 20-30 seconds on high. In a large bowl, add in the sugars and butter. Start your stand mixer with the paddle attachment and run on medium speed. It will take about 30 seconds to a minute. You can also use a hand mixer.\n5. When you have a smooth texture like peanut butter, add the 1/2 of the milk and all of the vanilla and mix again. Mix until the dough looks nice and fluffy and the colour is much paler. It will take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes.\n6. Start adding in the flour, little bit at a time while you continue to mix on low speed. Continue to mix until you have added all of the flour and the dough has come together. If the dough appears crumbly or dry, add more milk, 1 Tbsp at a time.\n7. Once the dough has come together, stop the mixer and add in the chocolate chips. Continue mixing until they are well combined. The dough should be soft and smooth - add more milk as required to achieve this texture.\n8. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. Scoop the cookie dough and enjoy!  \nNotes: Don't leave the pan unsupervised at any point, the flour will burn and turn the cookie dough bitter.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/tixqfj/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/", "created_utc": 1647818483.0, "score": 44, "author": "cookingwithanadi", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/tixqfj/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Turn This Humble Vegetable Into Something Resembling A Dessert! Honey Roasted Parsnips!", "selftext": "Parsnips are undeservedly unloved in the world of vegetables. They don\u2019t have the sweetness or striking colour of a carrot, nor do they have the versatility of the potato. You may immediately dismiss them as being bland, but you\u2019d be wrong \u2026\n\nMy honey roasted parsnip recipes takes this humble vegetable and transforms it into something you would class more as a dessert or a delicious snack! This recipe will ensure that your honey roasted parsnips are crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and sweet all over!\n\nBest of all, you can make these honey roasted parsnips ahead of time, put them in the fridge overnight and re-heat the parsnips the next day. In essence, this is the perfect side for Christmas or any Sunday Roast!\n\nIf you have vegan guests, swap out the honey for maple or guava syrup!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see a video demonstration on how to make these honey roasted parsnips, be sure to watch by step-by-step video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhikC8uxts4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhikC8uxts4)\n\n\\------------------------\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nApproximately 5 parsnips\n\n3 tbsp. Vegetable oil\n\n3 tbsp. Honey (or maple syrup/guava syrup if vegan!)\n\nA good pinch of salt\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Serves:** 3-4 people, but you can double the ingredients for more.\n\n**Time:** 5 minutes to prep, 35-40 minutes to cook at 190C (375F).\n\n\\------------------------\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Prepare your parsnips by washing, peeling and removing the top and bottom (topping and tailing) the vegetables.\n2. Cut your parsnips in half width-wise, then cut the two sections length-wise. If you have a particularly large piece after your second cut, cut this piece again length-wise. You\u2019re aiming for all your parsnip pieces to be similar in size!\n3. Place your parsnips in a deep pan and cover with plenty of boiling water. Add a good pinch of salt and turn your stove onto maximum heat.\n4. Into a roasting pan, add 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil and 3 tablespoons of runny honey. Give that a little mix together! At the same time, preheat your oven to 190C (375F).\n5. After a few minutes, check that the parsnips yield to your fork. We don\u2019t want them to be too soft at this stage. Drain your parsnips in a colander and then place the colander back over the pan you\u2019ve been using. The steam will help dry the parsnips and ensure a nice, crispy exterior!\n6. Tip the parsnips into your roasting pan and turn them to ensure they are thoroughly covered in the honey sauce. Spread them out in the pan so no pieces overlap and sprinkle a little more salt!\n7. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, toss the parsnip pieces and bake again for a further 15-20 minutes.\n8.

{"title": "Creamy Tomato Soup in an Instant Pot with store bought Puff Pastry Top. Very Easy to make", "selftext": "step by step video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjfM57-y\\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjfM57-y_8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo prepare this soup I will be using Instant Pot which makes the preparation process faster and easier. Entire cooking process should take you about 40 minutes including pressurizing and natural pressure release of the pressure cooker. \n\nIngredients: ( servings 8 ) \n\nSan Marzano tomatoes - 2 cans ( 28 oz each ) \n\nChicken broth - 4 cups\n\nHeavy whipping cream - 1 cup\n\nPotatoes ( medium ) - 2pcs ( peeled and cut on medium cubes ) \n\nSweet potatoes ( small ) - 5 pcs ( peeled and cut on medium cubes ) \n\nGarlic - 5 cloves ( finely chopped )\n\nAvocado oil - 2 tablespoons  \n\nOnion - 1pcs ( finely chopped ) \n\nSalt and Pepper - to taste \n\nDry basil - 1 teaspoon \n\nRed chili pepper flakes  - 1 teaspoon \n\n  For serving: fresh basil \n\nPastry top: \n\n* Puff pastry dough ( defrost before use )  \n* Egg - 1pcs ( we need egg white only ) \n\n**Preparation steps**\n\n**Step#1** \n\nChop onion and garlic, cut potatoes in medium cubes. Turn on Instant Pot on saute mode and fry onion until translucent ( about 5 minutes ), then garlic and fry for another minute. \n\nNow you can start adding the rest of the ingredients: potatoes, tomatoes and 4 cups of chicken broth. For the vegetarian version you can use water or vegetable broth instead. Then add spices: salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and some dried basil. Since broth is already salty, don't add too much salt. You can always add more at the final stages of the cooking process. Now close the instant pot, turn on manual cooking mode and set for 10 minutes. \n\n**Step#2**\n\nWait for natural release to open up Instant Pot. You don't want to do manual release with a lot of hot liquid inside, it could go all over your kitchen. Using a hand held blender, mix soup on high until it becomes a very smooth, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to spill, it is very hot. Now you can taste it to make sure you have enough spices. Then stir in 1 cup of heavy cream, it will make the soup creamy. Sprinkle some fresh basil and it is ready to serve. \n\nIf you want to create a special experience for your family or guests I would recommend adding a pastry top which will make the presentation of this soup amazing. \n\nI am using store bought puff pastry from Trader Joe\u2019s. \n\n1. Put soup into ovenproof bowls\n2. Preheat oven to 375-400\u00b0F \n3. Cut out circles from the dough. Diameter of the circles should be about 1 inch larger than the diameter of the bowls.  This way the dough could be attached to the sides. I am using a larger plate to make a perfect circle. \n4. Put the egg white into a small bowl, add 1 tablespoon of water and beat lightly. \n5. Now using a pastry brush, paint one side of the circle with the egg wash and attach it on top of the bowl with the egg wash side down. Gently pull dough on all sides so it sits very tight on top of the bowl. Gently brush the top of the dough with egg wash and send it to the oven for \\~15 min or until the dough puffs and turns golden brown. \n\nBefore you serve, let it sit for 5-10 minutes. It is very hot. \n\nI hope you will enjoy this recipe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/u4m6ct/creamy_tomato_soup_in_an_instant_pot_with_store/", "created_utc": 1650070260.0, "score": 43, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/u4m6ct/creamy_tomato_soup_in_an_instant_pot_with_store/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This soda bread recipe only takes 5 minutes to throw together, does not require any kneading, and doesn't need yeast! This budget soda bread is also a lot cheaper to make than buying a loaf from your local supermarket!  \n\n\nI've also included some ingredient substitutes, in case you don't have all the ingredients to hand!  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re a visual learner, be sure to watch my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ\\_ILOUQfc8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ_ILOUQfc8)\n\n  \n\\------------------\n\n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n475ml whole milk  \n565g plain or all-purpose flour  \n1 tbsp. white vinegar  \n1 1/2 tsp. baking soda  \n1 1/2 tsp. salt  \n\n\nYou can substitute the 475ml whole milk and 1 tbsp. white vinegar for 500ml buttermilk.

Preheat your oven to 220C/425F (200C Fan) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.  \n\n2. To a jug, add 475ml whole milk and 1 tbsp. white vinegar. Alternatively, you can replace both of these ingredients with 500ml buttermilk. No vinegar? Add 1 tbsp. of lemon juice to your milk!  \n\n3. Into a mixing bowl, add 565g of plain or all-purpose flour, 1 \u00bd tsp. baking soda, and 1 \u00bd tsp. of salt.

It is a very easy recipe which I will make in Instant Pot and Dutch oven side by side to compare simplicity of cooking, taste and preparation time.\n\nIt is a great dinner or a party dish.\n\n**Ingredients: ( 6-7 servings )**\n\nWhite beans - 2 cans ( 15.5oz each ). I am using Great Northern beans from Trader Joe\u2019s. Drained and rinsed.\n\nChicken thighs ( bone-in & skin-on ) - 6pcs\n\nYellow onion ( medium ) - 2pcs ( finely chopped )\n\nItalian Sausage ( uncooked ) - 5pcs\n\nBacon - 8oz (225g) cut into 1 inch pieces.\n\nTomato paste - 3 tablespoons\n\nGarlic - 8-9 cloves ( minced )\n\nCarrots ( medium size ) - 3pcs ( chopped 1 inch pieces )\n\nFresh thyme - 2 sprigs\n\nBay leaves - 3pcs\n\nSalt & Pepper - to taste and seasoning chicken\n\nAvocado or Olive oil - 2 tablespoons ( for frying )\n\nChicken broth - 3 \u00bd cups\n\nBreadcrumbs - 1 \u00bd cup\n\nWhite wine - \u00bc cup ( or red wine )\n\nFor decoration: parsley\n\nYou can serve it with french baguette and green salad\n\n**if you are visual learner, check out step by step and comparison:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-twxTj6YmY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-twxTj6YmY)\n\n**Step #1**\n\nLet\u2019s start by cutting carrots, chopping onions and mincing garlic. Now, cut bacon into 1 inch pieces.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with Instant Pot:**\n\nTurn on Saute mode, and fry bacon for 5-6 minutes, remember to stir in the process. Cook until crispy.\n\nPro Tip: alway put bacon on the cold pan and cook on medium low, this way bacon will crisp evenly and not burn.\n\nWhen bacon is ready, take it out with a slotted spoon. Leave all the bacon grease inside the pan, we will use it to cook other ingredients.\n\nNow, season chicken with salt and pepper and fry starting with skin side down on Saute mode until golden brown on both sides\u2026.you don\u2019t need to cook chicken through. Don't overcrowd and cook it in several batches. Then take out the chicken and sear italian sausage until golden brown on all sides. Before cooking sausage, make a few cuts with a knife to prevent it from bursting when frying. When seared on all sides, take it out from the pan.\n\nKeep Saute mode on, add some oil and cook onions and carrots. After the onions are translucent, add garlic, cook for 1 minute, then add tomato paste and cook for another minute. Turn off Saute mode.\n\n**Dutch Oven:**\n\nWith dutch oven the process is identical.\n\nOverall for the frying, my preference goes to dutch oven. Instant Pot does the job, but Dutch Oven makes skin crispier and nothing sticks in the process. Let\u2019s see if it will make any impact on the taste of the dish.\n\n**Step #2**\n\n**Instant Pot:**\n\nNow, put all the ingredients in the instant pot except breadcrumbs. Pro Tip: I recommend draining and rinsing canned beans to reduce the amount of sodium and starch. Close the lid and set the pressure cooker for 20 minutes on manual high pressure and wait for natural pressure release.\n\nI added sauvignon blanc but you can also substitute it with white or red wine of your choice. As Julia sad:\n\n\u201cI enjoy cooking with wine. Sometimes, I even put it in the food.\u201d Julia Child\n\n**Dutch Oven:**\n\nProcess is the same. Add all ingredients in the dutch oven except bread crumbs and bring it to a simmer. Now, lower the temperature, cover with the lid and simmer for another 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through to 165\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nSo overall cooking this dish in Instant Pot and Dutch Oven takes about the same amount of time. Advantage of Instant Pot is that you can turn it on and leave the house. Please, never do it with the oven.\n\n**Instant Pot: 10min to come to pressure + 20 min cooking time + 10 min natural pressure release = 40min**\n\n**Dutch Oven: 10 min bring to seamer + 25min cooking time = 35min**\n\n**Step#3**\n\nNow the final step.\n\n**Instant Pot:**\n\nRemove thyme sprigs. Move the cassoulet to the casserole dish. Mix store bought breadcrumbs with some parsley and a little bit of oil and sprinkle evenly on top of the casserole. Turn on the oven to broiler setting ( 450\u00b0F) and bake for 5-10 minutes or until the top browns and looks crispy. Be careful not to overdo it.\n\nBy the way, if you want to make your own breadcrumbs, it is very simple:\n\n\\-Grind down bread in the food processor to desired size\n\n\\-Bake breadcrumbs on the baking sheet for about 7-8 min at 325\u00b0F\n\n\\-Stir in the process until toasted and dry\n\n**Dutch Oven:**\n\nWith dutch oven the process is identical, except you don\u2019t need to move the dish to another vessel, broil directly in the dutch oven. So with Dutch Oven one less dish to clean!\n\n**Tasing:**\n\nDuring blind testing process I had multiple family members to taste both options. Everyone was impressed with the art of french cooking, the amazing flavor and taste of this dish. However both Instant Pot and Dutch oven versions of this dish were equally good.\n\nConclusion: for this particular recipe both cooking methods are great, and take the same amount of time. Use the one you personally prefer.\n\nYou can serve this dish with french baguette and green salad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/uost81/easy_cassoulet_in_dutch_oven_vs_instant_pot_side/", "created_utc": 1652451579.0, "score": 46, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/uost81/easy_cassoulet_in_dutch_oven_vs_instant_pot_side/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Heat a pan on medium heat and add butter. Once the butter melts, mix in the flour and whisk for 2-3 mins until the rawness of the flour is cooked out.

Once all your milk is mixed in, wait until your sauce starts to come up to a simmer.\n3. As soon as the sauce comes to a simmer, it will begin to thicken.

Add cream cheese and mix well to blend with the sauce.\n5. Add cheese, lower the heat and stir to melt the cheese. Set aside while you prepare the veggies and chorizo.\n\n**For the pasta**\n\n1. Bring water up to a boil and season with salt once boiling. Add pasta and cook until al dente.\n2. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water to adjust consistency of sauce as required.\n3. In the meanwhile, heat up a pan/saucepan on medium heat and add olive oil.\n4. Once the oil is hot, add onions and saute for 1-2 minutes. Add the chorizo and continue cooking until onions have softened and chorizo is golden brown. Set aside once ready.\n5. In the same pot/saucepan add mushrooms and a pinch of salt and cook until mushrooms have lost most of their water content, reduced by about half in volume.\n6.

Slice onions half moons about \u00bc inch thick slices. I would recommend pounding chicken breast or tights for this recipe, this way you make sure your chicken is cooking evenly\u2026.as result it will make your chicken more tender. \n\n**You can do it in a ziplock bag or use plastic wrap on both sides. If you don\u2019t have a mallet, you can use a skillet instead, and gently pound the meat.** \n\nSeason chicken on all sides with salt, pepper and dry thyme. Now, we are going to brown chicken, I will do it side by side in Instant Pot and Dutch Oven. Turn on Saute mode on Instant Pot and heat plate for the dutch oven, and then add some oil. **Pot should be very hot, when adding the oil**. When oil gets hot, add chicken and brown for about 4-5 minutes on each side. **Also brown the meat long enough on each side before moving around, it will help to avoid getting meat stuck to the pot.** \n\nI have to say that I do like browning on dutch oven a bit more than Instant pot.   \n\nNow, take the chicken out to a separate dish. \n\n**Step#2  Caramelizing onion**  \n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nUsing silicon or wooden spatula, remove all the bits from the bottom of the pot. \n\nNow, start your Instant Pot on Sautee mode. Melt \u00bc stick of butter and then add sliced onions.     \n\nTurn off the Saute function, set Instant Pot to high manual pressure for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes cycle is over, keep it for another 2 minutes and do manual release. Now, turn Instant Pot to Saute mode. Add \u00bd teaspoon of salt and \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar, cook for 10 minutes or until onions get golden brown color, remember to stir in the process.\n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nHit up \u00bc stick of unsalted butter, add sliced onions and cook on low-medium for 25 minutes. Onions should reduce in size. Now raise the heat to medium high, add \u00bd teaspoon of salt, \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar and cook for another 30 minutes or until onions are golden brown color. \n\nCaramelizing onions in Instant Pot is a super convenient feature which allows us to save a significant amount of time. \n\n**Step#3**\n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nLet\u2019s make sure our instant pot is deglazed. Add 1 cup of beef broth, bay leaves, teaspoon of thyme and red wine. Add chicken and cover it up with sauce. Close the lid, turn on Instant Pot on 10 min at high pressure and then wait for natural pressure release. \n\nWhen chicken is ready, take it out from the Instant Pot to the casserole dish, and turn on saute mode. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water and add it to the pot. Also, if you want a more authentic French flavor, add 3 tablespoons of cognac ( or sub cognac for brandy, sherry or white wine ). Seamer on saute mode for 5-10 min or until sauce will thicken. \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nIn dutch oven the process is the same. Layer the same ingredients in the dutch oven. Set heat on medium low and simmer for 30-40 minutes under a closed lid. At the end add some cognac and cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce. \n\nIn this method a lot of liquid got evaporated during the cooking process, so not much time required for sauce thickening. In most cases you don\u2019t even need to add cornstarch. \n\n**Step#4** \n\nCover chicken with sauce in the casserole dish, and then cover it up with shredded cheeses. Send it to the oven on a broil setting for 5 to 10 minutes or until the cheese will brown a bit. \n\nThe final thing left is to taste it. It tasted amazing and we were not able to see the difference in flavor between both cooking methods. \n\nAll in all, Instant Pot is a bit faster, especially for caramelizing onions. It saved me about 15-20 minutes in cooking time. Taste and flavor was equally amazing with both cooking methods. \n\nBon Appetit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vnqugn/french_onion_chicken_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "created_utc": 1656538256.0, "score": 40, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vnqugn/french_onion_chicken_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Pat dry the chicken breast fillets and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in flour and shake off the excess (this is important). ***NOTE*** \\- Cook your pasta now and reserve a little bit of the pasta water if you'd like to use it to thicken your sauce later. To help keep your pasta from drying out, add a little olive oil and toss it in a bowl, then keep the bowl in a microwave to keep it insulate.\n2. In a large skillet over medium high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the butter and oil start to sizzle, add the chicken in batches, 2 pieces at a time, and cook the chicken until it's browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and transfer chicken to a foil-lined plate after it's browned and melt 2 more tablespoons butter before starting the second batch. ***NOTE*** \\- The chicken stays  tender and juicy as long as there is enough butter/oil in the pan, so make sure to top up the skillet with a little extra olive oil if it looks dry. If you don't shake the excess flour off the chicken, the oil will become gummy and gross.\n3. After all the chicken is cooked and removed from the pan, add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the lemon juice, stock, and capers to the pan and bring to boil, scraping up fond from the pan (the burny bits left from the chicken). Once the sauce is boiling, return all chicken to the pan and reduce heat, simmering for 5 minutes. ***NOTE*** *-* Using fresh lemon juice is key, and adding the capers with a bit of their brine will also help add brightness to the sauce. A lot of recipes will tell you to rinse the capers, but I think this makes the sauce worse. It does make the sauce saltier, though, so use unsalted butter if you can.\n4. Remove the chicken from the skillet and move to a platter. Add the remaining butter (\\~2 tbs) to the sauce and stir until thickened. Remove sauce from heat and add half the parsley, reserving the rest for garnish.

{"title": "Help! Husband only likes processed foods...", "selftext": "My husband and I have totally opposite taste buds. He was raised on highly processed junk foods. I'm not here to argue the health issues around that. I do believe there are no \"bad\" foods, but you ideally should live off of Dino nuggets, mini corn dogs, mac and cheese, frozen Pizzas, and other frozen processed meals. If it were up to him, he'd live off of it. We have a 2 year old now and I want to raise her eating a balanced menu. It would be nice to eat meals as a family, but my husband is beyond picky. I have accepted that I may just need to cook for my daughter and I and he does his own thing, but that isn't without challenges. She is noticing he eats different and asking questions. I don't want to demonize how he eats because I do believe that will just make her want to eat like him. I don't think creating food hierarchy mentality is helpful. However, I also don't want her eating like him. So, I'm attempting to find easy meals that are maybe dupes of \"junky\" food, or recipes that could check his boxes. \n\nWhen not eating highly processed foods, he does like some classic meat and potatoes type meals. Meatloaf, burgers, Shepherd pie, tatertot hot dish (i have a less processed recipe i make), lasagna, spaghetti, tacos, homemade hamburger helper, alfredo, steak... thats about all I can think of. \n\nAny suggestions or recipes would be greatly appreciated!!!\n\nEditing to add: wanting to make it clear my daughter does eat a balanced diet right now. Again, I'm more trying to prevent that from shifting by hopefully finding more meals my husband will eat with us. She loves a variety of fresh and cooked veggies and fruits. She even eats salad haha. She likes soups too. So far, she has a pretty healthy and ideal approach to the processed foods. I think this is because I minimize the stigma around them. I don't talk about them badly or as special treats. They're just other foods we sometimes eat, but not a lot of because eating a lot of them don't make us feel good. She's recently taken a liking to dove chocolate. Sometimes I give her one with dinner, sometimes I tell her it's not on the menu and she accepts it. I'm trying to vary it so she doesn't think we eat sweets with every meal. I also give it to her whenever she wants during the meal. Again, chocolate isn't a special gift she gets after eating what I determine enough food for her. If she asks mid meal, I make sure to tell her she can eat it then, but there isn't more coming after. So far, she eats the small piece and then eats the rest of her dinner.

", "selftext": "This recipe:\n\n\\* Is super easy\n\n\\* Is delicious -- it always turns out perfectly, and everyone loves it.\n\n\\* Uses ingredients you probably have around the kitchen already\n\n\n\n**Equipment:**\n\nA skillet that can go in the oven. I use one of those handle-less cast iron pans lined with ceramic. It's 13 or 14 inches across, and holds about 7 thighs. But I think a plain cast-iron skillet would work just as well.\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, thawed. I get the Foster Farms frozen ones, very cheap at Costco (and I assume other places as well). I cook 7 at a time because that is what my cast-iron skillet will hold.\n2. Olive oil or any other cooking oil\n3. About 2 TBSP minced garlic. (I've taken to just buying the big jars of it. I put half in a mason jar in my fridge, and freeze the rest.)\n4. About 1/4 cup butter\n5. Salt and pepper\n6. Parsley (Strictly optional, mainly just for appearance)\n\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400F\n2. Heat some olive oil at medium high in an oven-proof skillet (ideally one with a lid).\n3. Pat dry the chicken thighs. Generously salt and pepper both sides.\n4. When the oil is hot, put the thighs in SKIN SIDE DOWN. Cook them at med-high for 10 minutes, or long enough to make the skin crispy and golden-brown. Resist the urge to move them around!\n5. Flip the thighs over, so the skin is up. Reduce heat (because you are about to put in garlic, and don't want to burn it).\n6. Make some space in the pan and put in the butter and the garlic. (You can also brown the garlic in a separate pan and then add it to the skillet, if that works better for you.) Move the thighs around so the oil/butter/garlic mixture is spread more or less evenly around the pan.\n7. Cook on stove at reduced heat for 5-6 minutes, enough to brown the garlic.\n8. Pplace in oven for 40 minutes. It will come out perfectly. During this time you can make a salad or rice or whatever else you want.\n9. When ready to serve, spoon some of the oil/butter/garlic sauce over the chicken and sprinkle a little parsley on it.\n\nCredit: I got this recipe from [primaverakitchen.com](https://primaverakitchen.com)\n\nI hope you like it!

{"title": "Slow-cooker French Dip Sandwiches", "selftext": "Requires very little cooking know-how. This recipe only has one annoying step, slicing the meat, but the time investment is overall low (10 minutes max plus however long it takes to slice) aside from the ~5-6 hour total slow cook time, and you can even save any extra roast beef and/or au jus for leftovers or roast beef sandwiches later. A million times better than the Arby's slop.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n- 1 (3- to 4-lb) boneless chuck or rump roast, trimmed\n- 1 Tbs olive oil\n- 6 French rolls or hoagie buns (semi-firm is perhaps best)\n- sliced Provolone cheese (or preference)\n- 1/3 cup soy sauce\n- 1 cup Coke (NOT Diet coke, but the amount is not super critical. The can or small bottle is fine)\n- 2 10.5-oz can beef consomm\u00e9 (if you've never seen it, looks like [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Campbell-s-Condensed-Beef-Consomme-Soup-10-5-oz-Can/10321653?wl13=5270&selectedSellerId=0&wmlspartner=wlpa) but if you can't find it beef broth works too for a less strong flavor)\n- 1/4 cup dry chopped/minced onions (sometimes called onion flakes)\n- 1 Tbs beef bouillon\n- 1 tsp garlic powder\n- 1/2 tsp onion powder\n- 1/2 tsp dried oregano\n- 1/2 tsp salt\n- 1/2 tsp pepper\n- 1/2 tsp dried thyme\n- 1 bay leaf\n\nTrim any unwanted excess fat from meat. Heat olive oil (non-extra virgin probably best to smoke less) on medium-high heat in large skillet. Sear roast on all sides until lightly browned. No need to overthink this too much, it doesn't need to be perfect - you might want some tongs to grab and rotate the meat. Add to slow cooker and top with all remaining ingredients. Yes, really - you don't even need to mix them around that much, if at all. I personally tend to add the dry ingredients first on top and then pour the liquids over the top.\n\nCook on LOW for 4 hours then remove roast to a cutting board. Thinly slice roast ACROSS the grain. This is the annoying part, because the meat will be hot! You might need some tongs and/or a carving fork to hold it in place. Thinner is better but not a huge deal. Place sliced meat back in slow cooker (now everything will be fully covered by the au jus) and continue to cook on LOW for 1-2 additional hours.\n\nWhen ready to serve, remove roast and (optionally) strain fat from broth left in the slow cooker (there will be a lot) for dipping, which is your au jus!\n\nYou can now split the rolls and top each with beef and 2 slices of cheese, baking at 350 until cheese is melted. Alternatively, you can put the rolls and cheese to broil and add the meat after. Serve with reserved au jus - we like to use some mugs, small bowls, or what have you for individual dipping.

{"title": "Burrito Casserole a.k.a. Mexican Lasagne", "selftext": "I name-dropped a recipe I like in a meme subreddit completely unrelated to cooking, ended up sharing the recipe, and people seemed to really like it, so I thought I'd share in a cooking subreddit. I first saw a video on YouTube about it, but it was so long ago now. Spent a lot of time experimenting to refine it to suit myself.\n\nI really like this recipe because it tastes good, it's fairly quick, plus it gives me time to prep and clean while it's still cooking. When I'm alone it lasts me 4-5 meals. Kids and teens will love it. They love burritos right? Even my elderly parents like it.\n\nBurrito casserole (but my family calls it \"Mexican Lasagne\")\n\nPrep + cooking time: 90 minutes (optional rest time an additional 120 minutes), since the cooking phase is a lot of waiting, I usually chop my next ingredients while the previous ones are cooking\n\nDifficulty: Beginner-suitable (I am a beginner)\n\nEssential equipment: Oven, deep stovetop pan, round casserole dish about the size of a tortilla wrap\n\nServes: 4-5 people\n\nIngredients:\n\n* olive oil\n* 3 medium-to-large onions\n* 500g mince meat\n* 1 bell pepper (Red is good for colour, green or yellow acceptable)\n* 1 jar of preserved jalapenos\n* approximately 300g frozen peas/corn/carrots mix (I say approximately because I buy a 1kg bag of frozen mixed chopped veggies at a time and always eyeball it)\n* 1 can of four-bean mix or other canned beans. Which four beans are in the four-bean mix don't really matter. For reference, the one I use is a mix of cannellini beans, spagna beans, red kidney beans and chick peas. I've tried another one with a different four beans, but both were good.\n* melting cheese, approximately 700-800g (I usually have a 1kg bag on hand, probably the most expensive item on the list)\n* packet of tortillas, about 8 pieces (I usually only end up using 6)\n* taco spice mix (one part ground coriander, one part ground cumin, one part paprika, one part garlic powder, one part onion powder, and optionally, one part chicken bouillon) -- mix it yourself, it's SO much cheaper than the little ready-made packets which are 10-20x the cost by weight\n* bucket of Greek yoghurt as a 'side' to eat with the casserole, won't go into the actual cooking\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Dice three medium to large onions and caramelise in a deep pan with a splash of olive oil or other cooking oil. (Optional: once caramelised, remove from pan and put aside. This allows you to cook the meat in the next step fully without risk of burning the onions.)\n2. Cook 500g mince meat through fully, gradually breaking it up using your wooden spatula. Ensure all juices are evaporated. Re-add the caramelised onions if removed earlier.\n3. Add one chopped bell pepper, and add a large amount of chopped jalapenos (roughly 2/3 of the amount of onions), more is better than less.\n4. Once heated through, add mix of peas/chopped carrots/corns to the same volume as the jalapenos (frozen vegetable mix is convenient, but thaw by boiling or steaming first before adding).\n5. Add a drained can of four-bean mix (or other canned beans).\n6. Add approximately 6 tablespoons of taco spice mix (one part ground coriander, one part ground cumin, one part paprika, one part garlic powder, one part onion powder). Optional: add a tablespoon of mushroom or chicken bouillon. Stir through. The meat/vegetable mix (henceforth, the burrito mix) should thicken up with the addition of the spices. Add more spice to taste if needed.\n7. Ensure the spices don't stick to the bottom of the pan. If it does, add a few drops of hot water and scrape the bottom with your wooden spatula and it should come right off and mix with the rest of the burrito mix. Don't add too much water; burrito mix should be relatively dry, so if it ends up wet, continue heating and stirring until the burrito mix becomes quite dry again. Once mixed through and the taste is ideal, remove from heat source.\n8. In a round casserole dish, lay down a tortilla wrap. Use a knife to cut the tortilla so it fits the base of the dish perfectly. Spoon in a THIN layer of the burrito mix, then a layer of melting cheese. Lay the next tortilla wrap, pressing down on the previous layers to compress, to fit as much as possible in the dish. Repeat until dish is filled to the top. Top-most layer should be cheese, then the burrito mix under it. Do not put a tortilla on the top layer. (Optional: instead of using a tortilla wrap as the bottom-most layer, start with a thin layer of burrito mix, then tortilla, then burrito mix, then cheese.)\n9. Bake in an oven at 200 degrees Celsius, until cheese on top starts to brown (no more than 20 minutes), or to prevent the cheese from burning while ensuring the tortillas are cooked, bake for 10 minutes before adding top-most layer of cheese, adding the cheese layer and then baking another 10 minutes. \n10. Optional: Allow to cool for about two hours or more (like a pie) -- cutting and serving too quickly can cause the casserole to fall apart when served.

{"title": "~ Buttered Cinnamon Pretzels ~", "selftext": "This is a recipe I made at home to make some damn good pretzels that are just amazing. This will turn any store bought bland pretzel into an amazing desert. What you need:  \n\\~**Store bought Pretzels** (Frozen or whatnot, doesn't matter. I use frozen ones you get at any grocery store.)  \n\\~ **Butter** (Not Spray Butter)  \n\\~ **Pure Cane Granulated Sugar** (White Sugar)  \n\\~ **Cinnamon** (Powdered)  \n\\~ **Vanilla Powder** (This might be a bit tougher to find but it is a white powder you may find in the spice isle of most known grocery stores. Usually isn't next to the vanilla extract but instead with the herbs.)  \n\\~ **Granulated Maple Sugar** (Generally the only one you will find of this in stores is Maple Joe Organic Maple Sugar in a green bag.)  \n\n\n\\~Now for how to make this. First off you want to make the sugar mixture and this is gonna go taste by taste. Some don't like too much cinnamon and some love it. I personally like a hint of the taste. So first get a bowl and pour in 1/3 Cup of Sugar. Next is to mix in cinnamon by putting in 1/8 Tsp to start out. You are gonna mix this finely with a spoon then give it a taste. Afterwards mix in another 1/8 Tsp if you want it a little stronger (I went with 2/4 Tsp). If not move on to the next step. For the Vanilla Powder add 1/4 Tsp. For the Maple Sugar add 3/4 Tsp (I went with 4/4 Tsp for a stronger flavor). With everything in the bowl, turn the bowl to one side and take the back of your spoon and crush the mixture to get any chunks crushed down. Mix once all the chunks are out and you are good.\n\n\\~Follow the instructions for the pretzels you have. Generally it is 400 degrees for 3-4 minutes. Sometimes longer for thicker pretzels. I go by a touch and feel method around 2-3 minutes where I feel the top of the pretzel and if it is warm and soft, it is ready to take out. \n\n\\~While the pretzels are in the oven, take another bowl, get a new spoon, and start scooping some butter into that bowl to microwave. How much butter depends on how many pretzels you are making and how big they are. You really cannot get too much butter with this recipe so don't be scared to overdo it. Once you got your butter in the bowl, throw it in the microwave for about 20-40 seconds depending on how much you have. You want it to fully melt. Once out of the microwave, stir the butter with the spoon and it is ready to lather on the pretzels. \n\n\\~With your pretzels out on a plate, start lathering on butter onto the pretzels (Butter these one at a time. Once one is buttered fully, put the sugar mix on them) with either the spoon or a brush that you would use for cooking. Don't be scared to ruin the pretzels with too much butter as excess will fall off the pretzels onto the plate. Now, with the sugar mixture in a spoon, pour the sugar mixture onto the pretzels at every inch you can find on the top surface. You will generally eye this and the rule of thumb is \"If you see sugar mixture that is dry, that area has a bit too much\" as you will want all the sugar mixture on the pretzel to be wet by the butter.\n\n\\~With all your pretzels buttered and topped with the sugar mixture, pop them into the microwave on that plate. Put them in for about 20-40, maybe 60 seconds, depending on how many you have. You want them to get to the point where they are hot to the touch or steaming. Once that is done, grab a fork and a knife and get to eating. Cut them as you eat to keep them warm. If they start getting cold again on the plate, just pop them back into the microwave as these things taste best when hot.

These friends are all decent to excellent chefs. I have consulted them many times and they give me advice like keep it simple, make stews, use garlic and onion and so on, but i feel like i lack the slightest sensitiviy when it comes to cooking. I cant predict what something will taste like. These people have honed skills over the years. I am still on square one.   \n\n\nDespite this, i do find it meditative and relaxing and a kind of joy to cook. I have hopes that are dashed every time.

Very corny!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 6 ears corn, husks and silks removed\n* 1 1/2 quarts low-sodium canned or homemade chicken or vegetable stock\n* 1 bay leaf\n* 1 teaspoon whole fennel seeds\n* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds\n* 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n* 1 medium onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)\n* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced\n* 3 tablespoons flour\n* 1 to 2 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 1 1/2 cups diced potato)\n* 2 cups half-and-half\n* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n* Sugar\n* 3 green onions, finely sliced\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Hold one corn cob upright in a large bowl and cut off kernels with a sharp knife. Repeat with remaining cobs and reserve kernels and cobs separately.\n\n2. Use the back of a knife to scrape corn cobs into a medium saucepan to collect any milk left in the bases of the kernels. Break corn cobs in half and add to saucepan. Add chicken or vegetable stock, bay leaf, fennel seed, coriander seed, and whole black peppercorns. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to just below a simmer, and let steep for 10 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and discard cobs and spices.\n\n3. While stock infuses, melt butter in a separate 3 quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, and corn kernels, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and kernels are tender, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat if butter begins to brown. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.\n\n4. Stirring constantly, gradually add infused corn stock, letting mixture come to a simmer. Add potatoes and 1 teaspoon salt. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add half and half and stir to combine. Soup may look broken with melted butter floating on top at this stage.\n\n5. Transfer 1/4 of soup to a blender and blend on high heat until smooth, about 1 minute. Return to pot and whisk to combine. Alternatively, use a hand blender to blend in the pot until desired consistency is reached. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and sugar (with very fresh picked corn, sugar should not be necessary). Serve immediately, sprinkled with sliced scallions, or chill and serve cold.

You won\u2019t want to have it any other way as reheating it invigorates it with spices while remaining moist and juicy.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 3lb Roast: Beef (Eye of Round, Top Round), Pork (Roast), Chicken\n* 2tsp each Salt, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper\n\n* 8 Servings: Carrot, Onion, Celery\n* Finishing Spices: Ginger, Garlic Powder, Red Pepper Chili Flake\n\n#Equipment\n\n* Meat Thermometer\n* Food Slicer\n* Rice Cooker\n* Roasting Pan\n* Oven\n* Microwave\n* Food Wrap or Food Bags\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Coat roast in a generous portion of Salt, Pepper, and Garlic Powder.\n\n2. Cook roast at 350^o (177C) to 145^o (63C) internal temperature Beef, 165^o (74C) Chicken, Pork. NOTE: The roast will continue to heat up to 20^o (14C) more degrees so pull it out a little sooner at your discretion. TIP: Put a little Chicken or Beef Broth, or Olive Oil at the bottom to the roasting pan to collect juices and to prevent scorching. (It should take 1 to 1.5 Hours or longer depending on size of roast).\n\n3. Clean and chop Carrot, Celery, and Onion into bite size pieces.\n\n4. Let the Roast cool up to an hour.\n\n5. Cut Roast into small serving size pieces. (Smaller than you think).\n\n6. Bag up roast pieces with RAW Carrot, Celery, Onion, and pour in a little juice from the roasting pan (Protects veggies from over freezing!)\n\n7. Freeze the individual bags in another bag. This can make 8 Servings from a 3lb Roast.\n\n8. When preparing the plate simply defrost the contents in a small bowl and then pour a little sprinkle of Ginger, Garlic Powder, Red Pepper Chili Flake or other spices, a little Soy Sauce and heat the mixture up in the Microwave until hot.

Easy to make on a weeknight, and kids usually love it.  The dish is just a few steps of boiling pasta, poaching the chicken, mixing ingredients, and baking. \n\n\n# INGREDIENTS\n\n* 1.5 lbs skinless boneless whole chicken breasts (a little more or less is fine)\n* 1 jar (15 or 16 ounces) Alfredo sauce\n* 8 oz small \"tube\" pasta, like penne, mostaccioli, ziti, etc.\n* 6 oz shredded mozzarella, divided\n* 4 oz shredded cheddar\n* 2 Tbsp milk\n* 1 Tbsp onion powder (NOT onion salt)\n* 1 Tbsp garlic powder (NOT garlic salt)\n* Pinch of nutmeg, optional, there may be some in the sauce.\n\n# METHOD\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees\n\n2. Place whole chicken breasts in a pot, add water to cover the breasts by about 1/2 inch.  Bring pot to a boil, reduce to medium heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then drain.\n\n3. While the chicken boils, also boil the pasta in a second pot for about 10 or 11 minutes, then drain.  Pasta should be a little bit firm still, more cooking takes place in the oven.\n\n4. Cut cooked chicken into bite-sized chunks.\n\n5. In a large bowl, mix chicken, pasta, spices, Alfredo sauce, milk, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese until well blended.  \n\n6. Place mixture in a greased casserole dish, preferably 8\"x11\", or a deeper 9\" round baking dish.\n\n7. Mix remaining mozzarella and cheddar together and sprinkle evenly over the top.\n\n8. Bake at 350 degress for 30 to 40 minutes.  Cheese should be turning golden brown.\n\n# NOTES\n\nSave more time by using pre-grated cheeses.  You can add some broccoli florets to this for a \"complete meal\" as my home-ec teacher used to say.  Be sure to use the onion and garlic *powders* and not the salt, using salted ones will make this dish too salty.

Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally so the edges don't burn, until the sugar syrup is a dark amber, about 8 minutes.\n\nWhisk in the butter, then the cream. Return to a simmer, just to combine, then remove from the heat. Whisk in the vanilla. Pour the caramel into a spouted glass measuring cup and let cool until the mixture is thick enough to drizzle, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\nDrizzle the caramel over the brownies and sprinkle lightly with the coarse salt. Let cool completely in the baking dish before cutting into squares, each with a whole pretzel on top. Serve topped with whipped cream.\n\nLink: https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/eddie-jackson/gooey-chocolate-salted-caramel-pretzel-brownie-4624648", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/164xvcp/easy_recipe_for_gooey_carmel_salted_pretzel/", "created_utc": 1693351076.0, "score": 33, "author": "_Mr_Serious", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/164xvcp/easy_recipe_for_gooey_carmel_salted_pretzel/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chicken Strip Fettuccine: 1-Dish Wonder", "selftext": "Can't say I've actually had or made chicken spaghetti or chicken fettuccine alfredo, so I don't know if this would be similar to those.\n\nIt's a simple and easy dish suitable for anyone with basic cooking skills. If you can boil noodles and bake pre-packaged chicken strips, you can do this.\n\nDo note that I usually do this in a 5 qt pot and share it at work. You can either experiment to reduce the amount to suit your particular situation (single, couple, etc) or just make the 5 qt pot and deal with the leftovers.\n\nWhat you'll need:\n\n\\- Some Tyson (or your preference) Southern Style Chicken Strips and Buffalo Style Chicken Strips. I usually use 3 of each variety, of considerable size (4\" or longer). Note the Honey BBQ may not go well with this. I haven't tried it, because I'm not a fan of that variety. Obviously you can also use your own raw (cooked to your liking) chicken variety, but I find the breading adds to it.\n\n\\- 1 can Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup, 1 can any other Cream Of soup variety (celery, mushroom, etc). These two will easily manage a 5qt pot of noodles, especially when you add water.\n\n\\-Fettuccine (obviously). How much is up to you. I always do either way too much or not enough.\n\nBoil the noodles in a 5qt pot until they're done (this depends on how soft or how chewy you like them).\n\nDrain most of the water out, or you can add some back in later.\n\nAdd the two cans of Cream Of whatever, (and 1/2 can of water if needed) stir and simmer while the chicken cooks.\n\nBake the chicken strips according to the bag. Cut into chunks when they're done. Add chicken to noodles. Stir to distribute the chicken evenly. Boil for maybe 5 minutes so the flavors can really blend, especially the Buffalo chicken seasoning.\n\nServe with garlic bread, maybe some mixed vegetables.\n\nI have tried this with regular spaghetti noodles and was not a fan. I'm not a noodle scholar, but I'm guessing it's more than the shape that defines them.\n\nAlso, the \"alfredo\" thing I don't really do, but I understand it's an additional sauce component, or a particular type of sauce (according to the jars I see on store shelves)? Anyway, I have no idea how that would work here.\n\nAlso note that an inherent aspect of ready-made chicken strips is that the breading will likely have very hard bits, usually towards the ends. Try to keep these out of the noodles, if you value your teeth. The sauce does nothing to soften these up.\n\nA nice variation on this is to replace the noodles with mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, etc) and you end up with something fairly similar to the contents of a chicken pot pie.

Since you liked the spinach and ricotta quiche, I want to share with you this other recipe which is so easy and taste to make! Unfortunately it's not vegetarian. Hope you like it!\n\nFor me this recipe is special since my mother always prepared it as an appetizer for my birthdays when I was a kid. It's easy to make, fast and delicous!\n\nThe name **Valdostana** comes from Valle d'Aosta, an Italian region from which the Fontina cheese comes from. I suggested mozzarella as a substitute since Fontina may be hard to be found outside Italy, however, the success is guaranteed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients:\n\n1.32 pounds (600g) Puff Pastry\n\n3.53 ounces (100g) Cooked Ham\n\n2.37 fluid ounces (70ml) Tomato Passata\n\n5.29 ounces (150g) Mozzarella (even better: Fontina cheese)\n\n1 Egg Yolk\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. To make this recipe, you will need two puff pastry discs of approximately 11.81 inches (30 centimeters) in diameter. You can use ready-made puff pastry.\n2. Place the first puff pastry disc on a work surface (on which you have already placed a sheet of parchment paper to facilitate transferring the savory pie to the baking sheet).\n3. Inside the puff pastry disc, arrange a layer of cooked ham, making sure to leave at least 1.18 inches (3 centimeters) from the outer edge of the disc.\n4. Place the mozzarella, either sliced or shredded, on top of the cooked ham, being careful not to go beyond the 1.18 inches (3 centimeters) border of the disc.\n5. Spread a thin layer of tomato passata evenly over the mozzarella using a spoon.\n6. Cover the first disc and its contents with the second puff pastry disc, and use your fingers to seal the edges of the upper disc to the lower one (which is why I advised you to leave a 1.18 inches/3 centimeters border free from the filling). This step will help cook the filling without it leaking out of the pie.\n7. Lightly beat the egg yolk and brush the surface of the pie with a kitchen brush. Then transfer the parchment paper with the pie on top to a baking sheet. Place the Valdostana-style savory pie in a preheated oven at 356\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and bake for 20 minutes. Once it's cooked, let the pie cool, and then serve it when it's still warm or at room temperature.\n\nEDIT sorry guys I don't live in the US and I don't know what is the best alternative to tomato passata", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/14t3e4j/valdostana_savory_pie_the_taste_of_my_birthdays/", "created_utc": 1688725859.0, "score": 30, "author": "ehiwtf", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/14t3e4j/valdostana_savory_pie_the_taste_of_my_birthdays/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Easy Chicken Divan", "selftext": "I swear, once you do this, you see it really is easy.  It's basically browning chicken, making a sauce, and simmering.  And, this is a great dish to have fun with, not being so concerned with precise amounts, and just having fun making the sauce to taste. I will give measurements for some things, but that's a guideline, not a rule.  When I make this, I just kind of \"add some wine\" and \"add some cream.\"  This also works well with pork chops, see Notes.  Prep time is usually less than 5 minutes and cook time is about 12 minutes. \n\nServes 4.\n\n# Ingredients\n\n* Two boneless chicken breasts, sliced horizontally to make four thin cutlets\n* One medium head of broccoli cut into florets (discard thick stems)\n* White wine (about 6 ounces)\n* Cream (about 6 ounces)\n* Grated cheddar (about 1/4 cup)\n* Dijon mustard (about 1 heaping tablespoon)\n* Garlic, minced (about 2 or 3 cloves, or more to taste)\n* Butter\n* Flour\n* Salt\n* Pepper\n\n# Method\n\n* Bring a large skillet to temp over medium-high heat and add about 3 TBSP of butter.\n\n* While the butter is melting, dredge each side of the chicken through the flour, shake off excess, and salt and pepper both sides to taste. \n\n* When the butter is getting bubbly, add the cutlets to the butter and saute each side until brown, about 90 seconds per side.  Color should be a deep golden brown, so cook a little longer if needed, but be careful not to overcook.\n\n* Remove the cutlets to a plate (keep warm in a warm oven if possible.)\n\n* Add more butter to the skillet, and when melted, add the garlic and broccoli and saute for 2 minutes.\n\n* Add the wine, cream, dijon mustard, cheese, and a little salt and pepper, and stir until smooth and bubbly.  \n\n* Reduce heat to medium.  *Carefully* take a taste of the sauce and add more of anything you feel may be lacking.  \n\n* Return the chicken cutlets to the pan, make sure they are covered with the sauce, cover the skillet and let simmer on medium heat for about 3 minutes.\n\n* Place cutlets and broccoli on a platter, but leave at least half of the sauce in the pan.  Return the pan to the heat, add another splash of wine, and scrape any wonderful brown bits off the bottom of the pan.\n\n* Pour remaining sauce over chicken and broccoli.\n\n\nThat's it.  \n\n# Notes\n\nI serve this with a side of rice and it's just a wonderful, rich comfort meal. I usually buy fresh broccoli florets in a bag when using broccoli, as it saves time cutting, and I don't need to throw away the thick stems.  When I use these, I use about 1 1/2 cups of florets for this recipe.  I do not recommend frozen florets, as these generally include far too many stem pieces that don't cook at the same rate as the florets.  You CAN make this same recipe with *thin* pork chops, as well.  Just make sure they are no thicker than 1/2 inch.\n\nAs Chef John from Food Wishes says \"Can you use half-and-half?  You can, but don't.\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/14aznd5/easy_chicken_divan/", "created_utc": 1686928934.0, "score": 19, "author": "brock_lee", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/14aznd5/easy_chicken_divan/", "html_title": ""}

Anyone here have suggestions for me?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit:  I found a YouTube video where they used cottage cheese, instant pudding and CoolWhip to make a dessert.  Going from that, I blended the 16 oz of cottage cheese until smooth and added in 1/2 package of instant banana pudding (I would have preferred chocolate but I had banana so...).  It was super thick so I added a couple tablespoons of half and half.  Then, I added in 1/2 an 8 oz container of cool whip and blended again.

I will put the rest of the Cool Whip on top once it is well set.\n\nI have friends who are elderly and whose appetites aren't great.  I think this will be a great treat to take them tomorrow.

{"title": "Granola Using Instant Oatmeal", "selftext": "I had a lot of leftover instant oatmeal packets in my house that was just past the best by date or in flavors that my household didn't really like and weren't eating. Solution - turn it into granola to eat on yogurt. Much, much cheaper than storebought granola, and the flavor that wasn't good in the texture of oatmeal was better when baked on something crunchy!  \n\n\nINGREDIENTS:  \n\\- Instant oatmeal - flavored is fine, unflavored is fine, whatever you have in the house.  \n\\- Maple syrup and/or honey - about 1 Tablespoon per cup of oatmeal.  \n\\- If oatmeal is unflavored: cinnamon, nutmeg, salt.  \n\\- Optional: chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans are good), dried fruit (raisins or craisins)  \n\n\nDIRECTIONS:  \n\\-Preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit.  \n\\-Pour oatmeal into a large bowl. If using flavored oatmeal, remove any large clumps of sugar/cinnamon/flavor mix. If using unflavored, add a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg per cup of oatmeal and a pinch of salt per cup of oatmeal. If adding nuts, add nuts now.  \n\\- Add maple syrup and/or honey, about 1 tablespoon per cup of oatmeal, and mix well. I like to use half maple syrup, half honey as I don't like an overpowering maple flavor but also saves me from using so much honey as it's expensive!  \n\\- Add the syrup/honey slowly and mix between each spoonful - you want enough that the oatmeal begins to stick together, but not enough that there are any pools of liquid. Add a few more spoonfuls if necessary. It's okay if there are a few dry spots.  \n\\- Spread out evenly on a baking sheet (with parchment paper is best to avoid sticking).  \n\\- Bake for 20-30 minutes, giving it a stir every 10 minutes.

{"title": "Lemon Bars", "selftext": "I make these every summer for parties. I'm excited it's starting to warm up and almost outdoor party season again!\n\nRecipe from this blog: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-bars-recipe/#tasty-recipes-67259\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Shortbread Crust**\n\n* 1 cup (230g; 2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted\n* 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar\n* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 2 cups + 2 Tablespoons (265g) all-purpose flour\n\n**Lemon Filling**\n\n* 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar\n* 6 Tablespoons (46g) all-purpose flour\n* 6 large eggs\n* 1 cup (240ml) lemon juice (about 4 lemons)\n* optional: confectioners\u2019 sugar for dusting\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9\u00d713 glass baking pan (do not use metal) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.\n\n2. Make the crust: Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 4.\n\n3. Make the filling: Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.\n\n4. Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.\n\n5. Once cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\n\n6. Freezing Instructions: Lemon bars can be frozen for up to 3-4 months. Cut the cooled bars (without confectioners\u2019 sugar topping) into squares, then place onto a baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour. Individually wrap each bar in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and place into a large bag or freezer container to freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator, then dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar before serving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/127qidr/lemon_bars/", "created_utc": 1680279429.0, "score": 179, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/127qidr/lemon_bars/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "GARLIC BUTTER CHICKEN THIGHS. This recipe is super easy; delicious; it always comes out perfectly; and it uses very common ingredients that you probably already have.", "selftext": "This recipe:\n\n\\* Is super easy\n\n\\* Is delicious -- it always turns out perfectly, and everyone loves it.\n\n\\* Uses ingredients you probably have around the kitchen already\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Equipment:**\n\nA skillet that can go in the oven; ideally, one with a lid.  I use one of those handle-less cast iron pans lined with ceramic. It's 13 or 14 inches across, and holds about 7 thighs. But I think a plain cast-iron skillet would work just as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, thawed. I get the Foster Farms frozen ones, very cheap at Costco (and I assume other places as well). I cook 7 at a time because that is what my cast-iron skillet will hold.\n\n2. Olive oil or any other cooking oil\n\n3. About 2 TBSP minced garlic. (I've taken to just buying the big jars of it. I put half in a mason jar in my fridge, and freeze the rest.)\n\n4. About 1/4 cup butter\n\n5. Salt and pepper\n\n6. Parsley (Strictly optional, mainly just for appearance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400F\n\n2. Heat some olive oil at medium high in an oven-proof skillet (ideally one with a lid).\n\n3. Pat dry the chicken thighs. Generously salt and pepper both sides.\n\n4. When the oil is hot, put the thighs in SKIN SIDE DOWN. Cook them at med-high for 10 minutes, or long enough to make the skin crispy and golden-brown. Resist the urge to move them around!\n\n5. Flip the thighs over, so the skin is up. Reduce heat (because you are about to put in garlic, and don't want to burn it).\n\n6. Make some space in the pan and put in the butter and the garlic. (You can also brown the garlic in a separate pan and then add it to the skillet, if that works better for you.) Move the thighs around so the oil/butter/garlic mixture is spread more or less evenly around the pan.\n\n7. Cook on stove at reduced heat for 5-6 minutes, enough to brown the garlic.\n\n8. Cover the skillet and place in oven for 40 minutes. It will come out perfectly. During this time you can make a salad or rice or whatever else you want.\n\n9. When ready to serve, spoon some of the oil/butter/garlic sauce over the chicken and sprinkle a little parsley on it.\n\nCredit: I got this recipe from [primaverakitchen.com](https://primaverakitchen.com) \n\nI hope you like it!

Easy if you have the ingredients.\n\nFind yourself a 16oz can of Texas Baked Beans, add a Shallot, some Bacon, a Poblano Pepper, Texas Barbecue Sauce, and Lee & Perrin\u2019s Worcestershire Sauce, top with Italian or Mexican Cheese, and you will have yourself a fantastic treat that will have the cow girls going yee haw.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 16oz Texas Baked Beans (Bacon Brown Sugar)\n* 2Tbsp Texas Barbecue Sauce\n* 2Tsp Lee & Perrin\u2019s Worcestershire Sauce\n* 4 Strips Bacon\n* 1 Shallot\n* 1 Poblano Pepper (or Anaheim, or Bell, or Jalape\u00f1o)\n* 1/8Cup Italian or Mexican Cheese (Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, etc.)\n* 2Pcs Naan (or Pita, or Tortilla)\n* 1/2Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 1Tsp Black Pepper\n* 1Tsp Salt\n\n#Instructions\n\n1.

Dry Rubbed\n3. Dry Rubbed Sauced\n4. Dry Rubbed Glazed\n5. Breaded\n\nThis Chef Jean-Pierre [recipe](https://youtu.be/-bRHMZcDUOE) shows a fantastic Dry Rubbed Glazed method. The real secret is not in the seasoning (which is complex) but in the method, which is simple, and has produced a fantastic chicken wing\u2014 Crispy, flavor throughout, somehow still moist and saucy. Shown here is approximation of the full recipe based on ingredients I actually have and description of the full technique.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 1lb Chicken Wings\n* 2tsp Olive Oil\n* Dry Rub: 2tsp Paprika, 1tsp Onion Powder (I used crushed dried minced onion), 1tsp Herb de Provence, 1tsp Garlic Powder, 1/4tsp Cayenne, 1/4tsp Cumin.\n* Glaze: Use your imagination and whatever you have on hand: 1Tbsp Oyster Sauce, 1Tbsp Lee & Perrin\u2019s, 2tsp Sriracha (I used Frank\u2019s), 1Tbsp Honey, 2tsp Maple Syrup, 1tsp Sesame Oil (I used 1Tbsp Melted Butter)\u2014 You could also use Texas Barbecue Sauce, Black Pepper Teriyaki Sauce, or any other glaze of your choice.\n* Dipping Sauce: It is essential to have some kind of cream sauce if you will be making a hot glaze otherwise it\u2019s not necessary. Use your imagination: 1Tbsp Sour Cream, 1Tbsp Yogurt, 1Tbsp Blue Cheese, 2tsp Dijon Mustard, 1Tbsp Mayonnaise, 2tsp Hot Sauce, 1tsp Garlic, 2Tbsp Parsley\u2014 You could also just use Ranch Dip to great effect.\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. If necessary cut and discard tips \u201cscratchers\u201d, and separate wings \u201cflappers\u201d from the drumettes.\n\n2. In a mixing bowl coat in 2tsp Olive Oil.\n\n3. Coat in dry rub.\n\n4. Bake in a preheated oven 350^o Fahrenheit (177 Celsius) for 45 minutes. (375^o / 191^c if you are farther from the burner element or are using regular chicken leg drum sticks or large chicken\u2019s wings, or according to package instructions). I placed mine on a flat metal rack and flipped them after 20 minutes. They came out very dry and somewhat shrunken. I thought they were overcooked but the glaze softened them up preventing them from drying out and they were actually perfect and still moist.\n\n5. In a clean mixing bowl toss them in the glaze. I think this is important to make them not dry out. The glaze should be slightly wet at this point. When tasting a little bit of the glaze if it is safe to taste you should go mmm not eww.\n\n6. Broil under the broiler for 4 to 5 minutes. Chicken wings should be crispy, and look sparkling and glazed.\n\n7.

{"title": "Asian Ginger Pork over Rice", "selftext": "Seriously wonderful to live with a genius. How do you get Chinese style Pork pieces while ensuring they are tender on the inside while golden brown on the outside? One way of course is to Wok at high heat. Another way has to do with how they are cut for cooking. Preparing the entire filet is not wise because it cooks unevenly. Preparing as cubes if not done properly is not wise because they can overcook before flavor has a chance to penetrate the meat.\n\nThe technique revealed here is to cut your pork into strips that are the size of the cubes you want, but the strips will be cut into cubes at the end. That will allow the Pork to cook more evenly while remaining juicy on the inside and allow them to get nicely golden brown on the outside, and cook at a lower temperature, 300^o, so that the flavors have time to penetrate the meat during cooking.\n\nThis technique and the steps described below has fantastically delivered full flavored meat through the whole meat while remaining tender and also golden brown on the outside. How can you do the dish better?\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 16 Oz Pork Filet\n* 1/4 Tsp Ginger\n* 1/4 Tsp Mustard Powder\n* 1 Tsp Garlic Powder\n* 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper\n* 1 Tbsp Butter\n* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 8 Oz Rice\n* 1/4 Tsp Black Pepper\n* OPTIONAL: 2 Tsp Turmeric, 1 Tsp Tarragon, 1.5 Tbsp Dried Parsley\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Defrost the Pork to just under frozen. Cut the Pork into strips as described above. Coat the Pork in Ginger, Mustard Powder, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper and Soy Sauce and let soak for 15 minutes.\n2. Fry the Pork strips in Olive Oil and Butter at 300^o for 2 minute intervals turning on each of the 4 sides to get them golden brown. Approximately 8 minutes.\n3. Pour in the rest of the Soy Sauce, Spices and Resting Juices from the marination bowl and cover allowing Pork to complete cooking. Approximately 2 minutes or as desired.\n4. Cube Pork onto Rice. (OPTIONAL: Treat Rice with Turmeric, Tarragon, Black Pepper, Dried Parsley). Pour 1/2 of pan juices onto rice. Heat up rice in microwave if necessary until billowing steam and fluff until acceptably dry and added spices are cooked.

Golden brown and crispy everywhere except the breast skin, which can be browned in the last 10-15 minutes by turning the chicken back over.\n\nAn easy recipe because it does not involve flipping or basting the bird every 15 minutes. The only improvement would be to rotisserie the chicken in the bread pan if notches could be cut to let the rotisserie blades rotate and it made to fit so that it picks up and self bastes in its juices.\n\nShown here is a Lemon Pepper, Rosemary and Thyme recipe.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 1 Small Chicken\n* 2 Tbsp Lemon Pepper Seasoning (Lemon Zest, Black Pepper, Salt)\n* 0.125oz Rosemary or 2 Tsp Dried Rosemary\n* 0.125oz Thyme or 2 Tsp Dried Thyme\n* 1 Lemon\n* 1 Tbsp Butter\n\n#Instructions\n\n1.

Wrap a Lemon in Rosemary and Thyme and stuff into Chicken. (OPTIONAL: This brings out a sweetness mostly to inner parts of chicken.)\n3.

{"title": "How my grandma in Italy taught me to make red sauce (staple for all week, easy)", "selftext": "My grandma was born in Puglia, raised in Milan where my mother was born. I\u2019ve seen a lot of recipes for American forums that seem to complicate red sauce. So figured I\u2019d share how I was taught in Italy to make an \u201ceasy red sauce\u201d that can be used as a staple all week (can be used by itself, or as a base for pink sauce, etc). \n\nIngredients:\n1. Fresh yellow sweet onion \n2. Fresh basil\n3. Good quality Olive oil (NOT extra virgin, we don\u2019t cook with extra virgin and it will change flavor)\n4. Real Butter (I use salted)\n5. Salt (I use pink Himalayan) \n6. Black pepper \n7. Optional - cracked red pepper \n8. Canned tomato \u201csauce\u201d (such as Hunts). (Not jar premade sauce, just the straight canned tomato that\u2019s not cooked or anything, I use Hunts in the states)\n\nSteps:\n\nWe eye everything. So unfortunately I don\u2019t have exact measurements, you get a feel for it over time which is part of the fun imo as you can customize. \n\n1. Slice up onion (like a quarter of an onion if using the large hunt size). I make moon sliver shapes. \n\n2. In a pot, pour some olive oil. Medium heat. \n\n3. Put your onions in there and sweat them for a few min. Also add some butter (idk like half a tablespoon)\n\n4. Once onions are saut\u00e9ed, pour in the tomato sauce. Next, take your tomato sauce can and \u201crinse\u201d it with a bit of fresh water to get all the sauce stuck on the bottom and the sides. NOT a full can of water, just rinse it. Pour this tomatoey water into the pot as well. This effects consistency of the sauce later so def do it\n\n5. Turn heat to around 8 or so (out of 10)\n\n6. Put in your fresh basil leaves. If you want a little cracked red pepper, add it now. \n\n7. Allow the sauce to start bubbling. Once you see bubbling, give it a good stir and turn heat down to like 4. \n\n8. Stir every few min or so. Adjust heat as needed (if top layer of sauce is cooking super fast and tons of bubbling, turn it down, as an example) \n\n9. Now just do this for a bit to let it cook. Just remember to stir every few min. Overtime, the sauce will go from super liquid to a bit \u201cthicker.\u201d Usually like 20-30 min depending on your heat and quantity. \n\n10. Once it\u2019s the consistency you like, turn your heat to low. Now add your salt and pepper. Taste as you add until you achieve the taste you want. Hint - more salt/pepper than a lot of people realize. \n\nYay you\u2019re done. You can make any kind of Italian pasta with this.

{"title": "Gyros", "selftext": "It\u2019s surprising how simple it is to make Gyros once you have collected the various ingredients.\n\nMixing spices into ground beef, is something one does without thinking about it when making Mexican beef, a Meatloaf, a Hamburger, or etc., and yet, mixing spices is basically the only real step to making Gyros. Simply bake the meat in a bread pan for 45 minutes to 1 hour, and you are basically ready to eat Gyros. No slaving over the stove. No real techniques (except spicing).\n\nEven the Tzatziki and Hummus are easy to make, although, provided those are pre-made, putting a platter together of Pita bread, Kalamata Olives, Feta Cheese, Hummus, Tzatziki Sauce, Tomatoes, and Onions is only a matter of opening the relevant packages, washing and slicing the relevant vegetables.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 1 Lb Ground Beef\n* 1 Lb Ground Lamb\n* 20 Kalamata Olives\n* 5 Oz Hummus\n* 5 Oz Tzatziki Sauce\n* 2 Oz Feta Cheese\n* 1 Tomato\n* 1/2 Onion\n(RECIPE UPDATE: De-emphasize chili and cumin and emphasize coriander, minced onion, and parsley, salt and pepper, original shown below)\n* Gyros Seasoning: (2Tbsp Parsley,\n2/3 Tbsp Chili,\n2/3 Tbsp Cumin,\n1Tbsp Ground Coriander,\n1Tbsp Minced Onion,\n2/3Tbsp Oregano,\n2/3Tbsp Thyme,\n1/2Tbsp Paprika,\n1/2Tbsp Garlic Powder,\n1Tsp Cinnamon,\n1Tsp Sea Salt,\n1/2Tsp Black Pepper)\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Mix the Gyros seasoning into the ground beef and ground lamb.\n\n2. Let the mixture rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.\n\n3. Press the mixture into a bread pan and bake in a preheated oven at 325^o for 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\n4. When the Gyros loaf comes out (if it is no longer pink in the middle), you are ready to eat it alongside a platter of: Pita Bread, Hummus, Tzatziki, Kalamata Olives, Onion, Tomato, and Feta Cheese. (You can also pan fry the Gyros meat after baking to complete it or for extra crispiness).\n\nIt really is that simple. I made mine without Onion and Tomato, and I let it cook for the whole hour. It came out crispy, somewhat dry, and very well done. I also did not marinade it for the hour and it did taste like it needed some time marinading for the spices to settle. Although it seemed like a lot of spices at the time it came out tasting somewhat mild. That was fine though as the Hummus and Tzatziki, Kalamata Olives, and the soft delicious Pita Bread all pulled through to deliver that classic Gyros taste. Almost like what you get in your favorite Gyros restaurant.\n\nIf anybody knows how to improve or to spice the Gyros differently or better please tell us in the comments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10maa40/gyros/", "created_utc": 1674788253.0, "score": 2, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10maa40/gyros/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Tagliatelle Bolognese", "selftext": "This is based on [Gennaro Contaldo\u2019s Tagliatelle Bolognese](https://youtu.be/qdZEhkJcJe4) and produced a dish I would rate as \u2018f\u2014ing delicious\u2019 my highest rating. The lowest part of my highest rating. I do not reproduce things exactly, instead I get a general impression and then make things in a way I am comfortable with using ingredients I have on hand. In particular I used store bought flavored tomato pasta sauce and beef stock. I believe that those alone do not make a dish and so there is some technique depicted here and that those also prevent the dish from needing to simmer for an hour to develop flavor.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 2 Cups Tagliatelle (or Spaghetti, Linguine, Penne or etc.)\n* 2 Cups Tomato Pasta Sauce (or 2 Tbsp Tomato paste)\n* 4 Cups Beef Stock (or Water)\n* 0.25 Pounds Ground Beef\n* 1 Cup Mushrooms\n* 1.5 Teaspoon Butter\n* 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil\n* 2 Tablespoons Parsley\n* 2 Tablespoons Cheese (Parmesan, Romano)\n* 1 Teaspoon Italian Seasoning (Marjoram, Rosemary, Thyme, Savory, Sage, Oregano, Basil)\n* 1 Teaspoon Red Pepper Chili Flakes (or Cayenne, Paprika, Chili, etc.)\n* 1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder\n* 1/2 Teaspoon Cumin\n* 1/4 Teaspoon Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Teaspoon Salt\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Bring the Beef Stock to a boil and add rinsed Tagliatelle pasta. Boil for 4 minutes or as instructed. Pasta should be \u2018almost done\u2019. I use the Beef Stock here to simplify the steps. Set aside.\n\n2. Mix Mushrooms with Italian Seasoning, Garlic Powder, 1/2 of the Salt and Black Pepper, and Olive Oil, and stir fry the Mushrooms at 300^o until they give up their water, at 1 minute intervals to produce caramelization. Approximately 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\n3. Mix ground beef with Cumin, Salt, Pepper, and Red Pepper Chili flakes, and stir fry at 300^o until browned at 2 minute intervals to produce caramelization. Approximately 6 minutes. Set aside.\n\n4. Bring 1/2 Cup of Beef Broth (from pasta water) to a boil and reduce halfway until it becomes nearly a syrup. Add Tomato Sauce. Mixture should be \u2018too runny\u2019 but not watery and need to be boiled down to make a sauce. If it is watery boil it down vigorously. If it is done too soon add more Beef Stock because it\u2019s important to boil it down to develop flavor.\n\n5. Add mushrooms and ground beef and continue boiling down more gently. Here you can get the sauce perfect because at this stage the sauce can be simmered for a long time to reduce.\n\n6. When sauce is essentially done add 1/2 of the cheese. Add parsley, and butter. Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper as desired.\n\n7. Add pasta, toss together and continue boiling down if necessary until pasta is fully cooked and sauce reaches desired consistency.\n\n8. Serve on a plate with remaining cheese.\n\nEnjoy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10km1lq/tagliatelle_bolognese/", "created_utc": 1674609114.0, "score": 60, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10km1lq/tagliatelle_bolognese/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Easy mushroom rice pilaf for leftover cooked rice.", "selftext": "This recipe is great if you want to zip up some plain leftover rice you have. The place where we order Asian food from throws in a large container of white rice no matter what we get, and we often don't eat much of it with the meal.  One good thing about this recipe is that it can revitalize older cooked rice that's drying out a bit, as well. I've made it with nine-day-old leftover rice that was in a carton and not truly sealed, and it was great.\n\nThis recipe is for each cup of cooked rice you have.  Each cup serves about 2 to 3 people as a side dish.  You can easily scale the recipe for how much rice you have, for instance, simply doubling everything for two cups of rice.  \n\nIncluding prep, this takes about 18-20 minutes.\n\n#For each cup of *cooked* white or brown rice you need:\n\n* 1 Tbsp (a healthy Tbsp) of butter\n* 1 shallot, chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 4 oz mushrooms of your choice, sliced (I usually coarsely chop them instead)\n* 1/2 tsp dried thyme\n* 1/2 tsp kosher salt\n* 1/4 Cup chicken stock/broth\n\n#Directions\n\n1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.\n2. Add shallot and garlic and cook until the shallot is soft, about 3 minutes.\n3. Add mushrooms, thyme, and salt, and cook while stirring often, until mushrooms release their water, about 8 minutes.\n4. Add broth, scrape the wonderful bits off the bottom of the pan, and cook for about 1 minute. Add a little more broth (or water) if it looks like too much has evaporated.\n5. Add the rice, and cook while stirring until heated through, about 2 more minutes.\n\n#Notes\n\nI prefer a shallot for its flavor but also because it's easier to measure for this recipe.  You can substitute about 1/4 large onion per cup of rice if you prefer.\n\nIf need be, remove from heat and cover the skillet, and this will stay warm while you finish other parts of the meal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10jfbtn/easy_mushroom_rice_pilaf_for_leftover_cooked_rice/", "created_utc": 1674488271.0, "score": 37, "author": "brock_lee", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10jfbtn/easy_mushroom_rice_pilaf_for_leftover_cooked_rice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chicken thighs simmered in creamy tomato sauce (one pan)", "selftext": "Last evening my wife was working, and that leaves three of us for dinner.  I had three frozen chicken thighs that I did not use for a dish I made a week or so ago (I thawed them of course).  So, I decided to improvise a simmered chicken dish with what I had.  Most of my experiments in simple cooking are not worthy of writing down or sharing, but this one was really good.  It takes a while, but most of that is the simmering, which is when you can get side dishes ready.  Or enjoy a glass of wine, it's up to you.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 3 to 5 chicken thighs (I use skin-on, but skinless boneless is fine, just not as flavorful without the skin and fat)\n* 1 Can condensed Cream of Mushroom soup (or Cream of Chicken)\n* 1 Can (14 oz) diced tomatoes, drained, any variety you like (plain, Italian, fire roasted)\n* salt and pepper\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n* 1/2 tsp oregano\n* 1 Tbsp cooking oil (I prefer canola when searing)\n* 1/4 tsp chili flakes for a little zing (optional)\n* 1 Cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)\n\n(This may look like a lot of steps, but the basic steps are sear the meat for 8-10 minutes, make sauce with soup and tomatoes, simmer for 30-35 minutes.)\n\n# Instructions\n \n1. Bring 1 Tbsp oil to medium-high heat in a large, deep skillet.\n2. Salt and pepper both sides of chicken to taste\n3. Sear the chicken for about 4 minutes per side, and remove from pan, set aside on a plate\n4. Adding a little more oil if needed, saute mushrooms (if using) for a few minutes until they release their water\n5. Empty cans of soup and tomatoes, and the spices, into the skillet over the mushrooms, stir well, and bring to a simmer\n6. Reduce heat to medium-low\n7. Add chicken to the sauce, skin side down, spoon some of the sauce over the thighs.\n8. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.  Be sure this is a medium-low simmer.\n9. Remove cover, turn thighs over, spoon sauce over thighs again.\n10. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  Time is not super critical, so they can simmer a little longer if you're waiting on a side dish.\n\nTo serve, arrange chicken on plates, spoon sauce over. \n\n\n#Notes:\n\n* Italian Seasoning can be substituted for oregano and garlic if you want.\n\n* For my sides, while the chicken was simmering, I made steak-cut french fries in an air fryer and heated up a can of spinach.  This chicken and sauce would go GREAT with mashed potatoes, rice, or even over pasta, plus any green side you like.\n\n* I got both the cans of soup and tomatoes on sale for $1 each, so not only is this easy, it was inexpensive.\n\n* Hopefully you are familiar with your stove-top.  I have found that when many recipes call for \"saute on medium-high\", I need to use just medium on my stove.  Likewise, \"simmer at medium-low\" really means \"low\" for me.  Most important here is not to overcook the chicken skin when searing.\n\n* I recommend a nonstick pan for this.  Even with cooking spray and cooking oil, I've had chicken skin stick to my stainless pans before when searing, and this puts me in a bad mood.  \n\n* I only used three thighs, since that's what I had, but there was plenty of sauce for two more (maybe even three).

{"title": "Bangers and Smash w/ delicious Onion Banger Sauce", "selftext": "Bangers and Smash w/ Onion Gravy\n\nBangers in this classic dish are sausages so named because sausages of old had fillers that caused them to burst when they were done cooking, but they are really just regular Italian or German style sausages.\n\nSmash in this dish refers to the cooking method of potato. A \u201csmashed potato\u201d is a crispy potato medallions that are stacked after cooking and then smashed vertically to make a crispy version of a mashed like potato with a baked potato like consistency and are easier and in some ways better and more flavorful than mashed potatoes.\n\nAnd these smashers are so well.\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 Bangers (Sweet Italian, Bratwurst, or Spicy Italian, etc.)\n1/2 Onion.\n1 Large Russet Potato or 5 Yukon Gold or other small potatoes.\nCumin, Chili, Paprika, Cayenne, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, depending on whether bangers are already spicy or not, and whether banger grease will be used to flavor the banger gravy.\nItalian Seasoning & Onion Powder (for onions).\nThyme, Chili, Paprika for Smashed Potatoes.\nSalt & Black Pepper\nWorcester Shire Sauce\nBeef Broth, or Beef Stock, or Milk, or 1:1 Evaporated Milk & Water (if you don\u2019t have Beef Broth or want to make a country gravy instead of a more proper banger sauce).\nOlive Oil.\n\nPrep:\n\nPotatoes: Scrub, Peel, and cut in half short-wise and then each half in half again making medallions and caps. Cut each in half again, and then again if desired to shorten cooking time. Toss potatoes in 1/2 Tbsp Thyme, 1/3 Tsp Chili, 1/3 Tsp Salt, 1/3 Tsp Black Pepper, 1 Tsp Paprika (optional), 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil.\n\nBangers:\n\nOptionally coat bland bangers in spices. Sweet Italian in 1/2 Tbsp Paprika. Bratwurst in 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder. Hot Italian in 1 Tsp Italian Seasoning. Depending on which banger variety is used. Pre-bake if health conscious to remove some grease.\n\nOnion:\n\nSlice 1/2 Onion into strips. Optionally mince stubborn portions that won\u2019t go into to strips. Toss in 1/2 Tsp Italian Seasoning, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder, 1/3 Tsp Salt, 1/3 Tsp Black Pepper.\n\nCook:\n\nPan fry onions until just soft. Mild color is okay. Do not burn. Pour excess grease out, or, add banger grease or butter until 2 Tbsp flour can be used to soak up all the fat. The amount of flour necessary to soak up the fat will determine how much gravy will be made so it is not too unhealthy.\nOnce the flour is cooked, and before it turns brown, pour in 1/8 Cup Beef Stock or Beef Broth and stir. Milk or 1 to 1 Evaporated Milk and Water can be used to make a country gravy instead of a proper banger sauce. Keep it thick, pour in more Beef Stock (or Milk) until the desired amount of gravy is produced.\nAdd 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder, 1/3 Tsp Cumin, 1/3 Tsp Chili, 1/3 Tsp Paprika, 1/5 Tsp Cayenne Pepper as desired particularly if the banger grease was not used, or if the bangers are a bland variety. Pour in 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce.\nIt is better to make a more flavorful gravy and then need to dilute it with Beef Broth (or milk) than to make a too bland gravy and then need to dump in Black Pepper at the end until it livens up, but, Black Pepper can be added at the end until it livens up.\nPut bangers in the sauce as it starts to thicken and bubble until it thickens.\n\nGravy is done when scraping the spoon leaves a clean trace because gravy is thick enough.\n\nNOTE: If the potatoes are not cooked in one go to begin with they will dry out and then never taste cooked no matter how often you take them out and back into the oven so it is best to blast them for sufficient duration approximately 20-25 minutes and until they are golden brown.\n\nServe:\n\nBangers slathered in delicious onions and banger sauce.\nPotatoes stacked and smashed once vertically.\n1/4 Tsp extra salt on potatoes (if necessary)\n1/4 Tsp extra pepper on gravy (if necessary).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ywct9k/bangers_and_smash_w_delicious_onion_banger_sauce/", "created_utc": 1668554208.0, "score": 76, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ywct9k/bangers_and_smash_w_delicious_onion_banger_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

You will notice that some seeds are still held together by said fibers and flesh (usually 4-6). Get them all separated as best you can.\n\nPut them out on a baking sheet and try to pat them dry as much as possible. They will probably stick to your paper towel/rag, but just shake them or brush them off. They will still be a little bit slimy and wet, we just want to make sure there isn't water all over the place.\n\nOnce they are sufficiently dry, put them in a bowl and drizz some olive oil or sesame oil on them and add your seasonings. Salt and pepper work fine but you can go nuts with it. I have some Amish popcorn seasoning that reminds me of the stuff at the bottom of a bag of sunflower seeds so I made a batch with Ranch and another with Salt, Pepper, and garlic powder.\n\nPut the seasoned seeds on a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for a total of **15 minutes**, tossing them every 5 minutes to encourage browning.

I've been eating Eggs in purgatory for years; it's my go-to quick dish! I know you're going to love it, so give it a go!\n\n**If you're a visual learner, feel free to watch my recipe video here!** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTfqvA5mt24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTfqvA5mt24)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 eggs\n* 4 garlic cloves (2 for the toast!)\n* 1 tin of tomatoes\n* 1/4 white onion, chopped into cubes\n* 1 tbsp. thyme (or oregano)\n* 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar\n* approx. 100g mozzarella cheese, grated or cubed\n* a good squeeze of tomato paste\n* a few pinches of salt\n* olive oil, for cooking\n* good quality bread, for dipping!\n\n**Serves: 2 people**\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Peel and thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat and add in a few tablespoons of olive oil. Once your oil has started to sizzle, add in one quarter of a white onion, chopped into cubes. As soon as the onions begin browning, add in your sliced garlic.\n2. Add in 1 tbsp. dried thyme. I normally add oregano rather than thyme, but unfortunately I ran out of oregano \u2013 and my local supermarket was out of stock too!\n3. Once both the onions and garlic are picking up colour, add in 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar and a good squeeze (a couple of tablespoons) of tomato paste. Give this a good stir until the paste breaks down into the onions.\n4. Add in 1 can of tomatoes. You can use any canned tomato, but I\u2019m using chopped/diced tomatoes. I also like to add in 1/3 of the can of water, just to loosen up the sauce!\n5. Set your pan to medium-low heat, cover your pan with a lid (if possible) and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.\n6. Add a few pinches of salt and taste your sauce to ensure it\u2019s seasoned to your liking! Feel free to add black pepper if you wish! Let it cook with the lid off for just a few more minutes.\n7. Turn the heat back up to medium and drop in 4 eggs - and maybe not traditional, but I love to add in 100g mozzarella cheese, grated or cubed!\n8. Pop your lid back on and cook until your eggs are done to your preference. Mine took around 10-15 minutes on an electric stove, but if you\u2019re using gas, your cooking time will reduce.\n9. Let\u2019s toast up our bread! Place a frying pan on medium-high heat and drizzle in some olive oil. Place your bread into your pan and swish them around, allowing them to soak up some of that oil. Once they\u2019re nicely toasted, flip and toast the other side.\n10. Once done, pull your toast out and rub a peeled garlic clove across the top of your bread!

Garlic Powder\n* Olive Oil (4 Tbsp in mixing bowl, and more poured over the cauliflower)\n* Salt and Pepper to taste\n\nSupplies:\n\n* Foil Pan or Cast Iron Pan\n* Smoker (250 degrees F indirect)\n* Mixing Bowl\n* Sharp Knife\n* Boiling Water in a Pot or Microwave and Large Bowl with Water in it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Place the cauliflower in boiling water for 5 minutes over a stove, or steam it over boiling water in the microwave for about the same time frame. This will give the cauliflower a head start in softening, and make the smoking portion much simpler.\n2. Combine all other ingredients in a mixing bowl. Whisk until well mixed.\n3. Place cauliflower in a small cast iron pan or foil pan. Pour olive oil over the head making sure it soaks into the nooks and crannies. \n4. Baste the entire head with the seasoning paste. Make a second batch if there's not enough to cover everything.\n5. Set your cauliflower in your smoker set to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove once it is probe tender, where a probe or skewer slides in and out like butter.\n6. Let the cauliflower rest until it has cooled enough to handle.\n7. Cut into steak like cross sections, quarters, or simply cut all florets off and pile them high for grab and dip bites.\n8. (optional) Smother in melted seasoned butter, queso, you name it.

Garlic Powder\n\n***OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS***\n\nYou can do so many things with this dish - We've sliced cherry tomatoes to put in the bottom, Put salsa in the bottom; sliced garlic; whatever floats your tastes buds. We've even cut a tortilla the size of the ramekin and laid it on top like a 'pot-pie'. Whatever you want to try just add to the bottom before you put the avocado in.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n**1.** Set oven to 425 degrees\n\n2. Spray the inside of two ramekins with a non-stick spray (I use olive oil) - this keeps the melted cheese from sticking to it and makes for easier clean up)\n\n3. In the bottom of the ramekin, add your additional items. Try it with your favorite salsa - simply put enough in the bottom to cover it. Or, slice 4 cherry tomatoes and place them around the outer edge of the bottom (sliced garlic also tastes great)\n\n4. Slice your avocado in half and remove the seed. A tip I learned on pealing them is to lay the avocado flat and slice a bit off the tip and bottom where it's rounded, then simply peel the skin off..\n\n5. Place avocado cut side up to see the pit hole.\n\n6. Separate the egg yolk from the white and gently lay in the pit hole (You don't want the yolk to break).  Then pour the whites along the outer edge of the ramekin to let the white fill in around avocado\n\n7. Add your seasoning - I love garlic powder so I'll sprinkle some on the avocado and egg yolk8. Take about 1 to 2 TPSP of shredded cheese and lay over the top of the egg and avocado being careful with the yolk.\n\nPlace both on a baking dish and put in oven for about 13 minutes (I've found on my oven, that two of these at 13 minutes gets the whites cooked while still keeping yolk soft.

{"title": "Easy and tasty Indian potato-cashew-curry recipe and Naan bread", "selftext": "Today I want to share an amazing Indian potato and cashew curry recipe and the accommodating naan recipe as well. The recipe is easy but requires some specific spices. \n\nServes about 4 people and takes about 45 minutes.\n\nI also made a [Video](https://youtu.be/vjWvnCBM-54) if you like a visual comparison or guide. \n\nI\u00b4ll split the recipe into 2 parts the curry and the naan. \n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the curry\n\n4 medium sized potatoes\n\n1 large onion\n\n200ml of milk / a cup\n\n125gramms of cr\u00e8me fraiche / half a cup\n\n2 tablespoons of unseasoned cashew nuts\n\n1 teaspoon of chili powder\n\n2 teaspoons o smoked paprika\n\n3/4 of a teaspoon of ground coriander and cumin\n\n2 teaspoons of garam Masala\n\n1 teaspoon of salt\n\nA clove of garlic can be subsidized 1 teaspoon of garlic\n\nA piece of ginger can be subsidized1 teaspoon ginger powder\n\nFirst we got to cook the potatoes so we wash them to get rid of any remaining dirt and then put them into a pot without water, then we fill the pot until the potatoes are submerged in the water after the pot is filled with water we can put it onto the stove at high to medium heat at the beginning which you can turn down once the water is boiling.\n\nBefore we proceed with the onion we can add together all the spices we need later in a small bowl. Mix the chili powder, the smoked paprika, the coriander, the cumin, the garam masala, the salt, and if you chose garlic and ginger powder than those as well. \n\nOnce we took care of the spices we can start with the onion. First we cut away the opposite side of the root and then we halve the onion. Now we got to remove the most other shell of both onion halves. Now we can cut the halves vertically 5-6 times towards the root and then 1 more cut horizontally. Make sure to not cut into the root of the onion to keep the stability that the root provides. Now slice the onion really thin. \n\nAfter we\u00b4ve cut the onion we can put another pot onto the stove in which we will make the curry. Add some vegetable oil to the pot and set the plate to medium heat. Once the oil is hot add the onions to the pot and let them get glassy. \n\nIn the meantime, if you chose to use a garlic clove and a ginger piece. Remove the shell of the clove and cut it into small bits. Peel the ginger and cut it up as well. Otherwise proceed straight with crushing and chopping the cashew nuts. Once crushed add them to the spice bowl. \n\nWhen the onion turns glassy we can add the spices, the crushed cashews and the garlic and ginger. Let it fry for a short while as you constantly stir it, so the spices don\u2019t get burned. Now add half of the milk, let it boil and simmer for a short while. If you want a homogenous curry you can blend everything in the pot now, with a hand blender, but be very very careful there is a high risk of splatter. Whatever you chose after that we can add the cr\u00e8me fraiche and the rest of the milk while constantly stirring. Bring it to a boil and then let is simmer on low heat.\n\nLastly we got to take care of the boiled potatoes. You can check those by piercing them with a fork or any other spikey utensil if they have almost no resistance while piercing they are done. Take the pot of the stove and drain the water. Now we can wait a little bit to let the potatoes cool. Add them to the curry or pour the curry over them on the plate. your choice. and with that we are finished with the curry. enjoy. \n\nNow onwards to the naan bread. \n\nIngredients:\n\n150 grams of flour / \u00be of a cup \n\nhalf a teaspoon of baking soda\n\nhalf a teaspoon of sugar \n\nhalf a teaspoon of salt \n\n50ml of milk / \u00bc of a cup\n\n3 tablespoons of butter or 25grams / an ounce\n\n65 grams of yogurt / \u00bc of a cup\n\nFirst we got to mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl, the flour, the baking soda, the sugar, and the salt. After that we got to melt the butter you can do that in a microwave but be sure to cut the piece of butter into small bits, so they don\u2019t pop while they get heated. We let the butter cool and add it to a separate bowl with the milk and the yogurt once added we got to mix them together. After that we can add them to the dry ingredients. Once everything is in one bowl we must mix it and knead it thoroughly until we get a nice homogenous clump of dough. Let the dough rest for at least half an hour underneath the bowl. \n\nAfter the dough is finished with resting we can sever it into 4 equally sized pieces. Those pieces we got to roll out thin about 2 mm thick we strive to achieve a round shape for the pan. Put a suitable sized pan on the stove at medium heat and add some butter or vegetable oil try to spread it before adding the rolled-out dough. Once the dough is added we just got to wait until there are bubble rising on the surface of the dough. than flip it around and give it about the same time. once both sides are partially browned the naan is finished and we can enjoy a really nice Indian curry and homemade naan bread. Enjoy.\n\nTime Calculations\n\n30minutes naan rising / 25-30 minutes potato boiling\n\nCan be done in the meantime.\n\nCutting the onion 3min \n\nMixing the spices 1min\n\nFrying the onion 3min / crushing the cashew nuts\n\nBoiling and simmering 10min 1. time 3min 2.

{"title": "Easy and simple recipe for Goulash a eastern European meat stew.", "selftext": "Today I wanted to share a really easy recipe for goulash, a hearty meat stew form eastern Europe.  \n\nThis recipe serves about 4 people if you add some side dish.\n\nEstimated time: at least 2h 25min\n\n I also made a video explaining every step. [Video](https://youtu.be/gPWTQ8zZWxM)\n\nFor the ingredients we need \n\n1 pound of soup meat beef you can use 2 pounds if you want it more meaty \n\n3 bell peppers \n\n2 large onions \n\n2 carrots \n\n2 stems of celery \n\n2 cloves of garlic \n\na bottle of wine \n\n2 tablespoons of tomato paste \n\n250ml /1 cup of beef broth \n\n1 tablespoon of Salt \n\n1 tablespoon of ground black pepper \n\n1 tablespoon of smoke paprika\n\n1 tablespoon cayenne pepper for heat \n\nHalf the onions, remove opposite side of the root and then remove the most outer shell. After that cut the onion halves with your knife towards the root 3-4 times and then once more horizontal cut towards the root of the onion. Make sure that you do not cut the root or you\u00b4ll lose the stability. Now we can chop up the onion into large chunks and put them aside.\n\nafter that chop up the garlic cloves into small pieces, we can crush the cloves with the broadside of the knife to remove the shell more easily. chop of the ends, halve the cloves and start to slice them along the long side. After that chop the garlic slices into small pieces and add them to the bowl with the onion chunks.\n\nonce we are done with the garlic we can put a pot onto the stove at medium to high heat and add some vegetable oil. While the oil in the pot heats up we can start to slice the meat into chunks.\n\nI like to cut away some of the harder meat parts but in theory you don\u2019t need to because the stew will boil for a long time which will make the meat tender. We cut the soup meat into thump size pieces. While we do that we need to keep in mind the oil in the pot.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough we can add the onion chunks and the garlic bits. Stir them thoroughly so they don\u2019t burn immediately. After the onions turned glassy add the tomato paste and the smoked paprika and stir it as well. Do not let the tomato paste get burned just a little bit heated.\n\nNow we need to open the wine bottle and deglaze the onion garlic tomato paste mix with about 350ml or 1 and half cup of wine and stir it a bit. Add about 250ml or a cup of beef stock to the goulash as well. After we added the wine and the stock we can add the meat.\n\nI cleaned the chopping board and the knife after I chopped the meat which is just a safety precaution. I don\u2019t like to work on surfaces that came in contact with raw meat.\n\nOnce the meat is added we can start with the carrots and the celery, peel the carrots, and chop them into disks, wash the celery stems and then chop them into equally thick pieces as the carrots. add both the carrots and the celery stem pieces to the goulash.\n\nAfter that we need to add the spices before simmering. Add about a tablespoon of salt, a tablespoon of ground black pepper and a tablespoon of cayenne pepper.\n\nNow the goulash must simmer for about 2 hours. We can leave the lid a little bit open so some of the moisture can escape and the goulash thickens. While the goulash is simmering we can chop up the bell pepper.\n\nChop of the head and remove the core than remove the inner white parts. Chop of the bottom as well and cut all the bell pepper pieces into slices about half a centimeter or a quarter inch thick and put them aside. The bell pepper gets added about 20-30 minutes before the goulash is finished. this will let the bell pepper stay a bit firmer once we serve the goulash.\n\nWe can Test the meat inside the goulash by squishing it with something blunt if we are able to tear it apart the goulash is finished, and you can enjoy a hearty meat stew.

Vegan Friendly!", "selftext": "Chocolate Depression Cake was developed during the Great Depression when ingredients were scarce and money was tight. In 2022, with living costs at an all time high, this is the chocolate cake we all need! This depression cake is so chocolatey, you won't believe it has no eggs, no milk and no butter in it! Even the chocolate icing is dairy free and vegan friendly!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here, which includes a few additional tips! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Chocolate Cake**\n\n* 180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour\n* 198g (1 cup) granulated sugar\n* 6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda)\n* 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\n* 40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder\n* 80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil)\n* 15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or other light vinegar such as white vinegar or rice vinegar)\n* 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\n* 236ml (1 cup) water\n\n**Chocolate Icing**\n\n* 170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar)\n* 30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder\n* 45ml (3 tbsp.) water\n* 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\n\n\\-----\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F and line an 8\u201d square pan with parchment paper. \n\n2. To a mixing bowl add 180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour, 198g (1 cup) granulated sugar, 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt, 6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda) and 40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder. Whisk this together until thoroughly combined and the mixture is uniform in colour.\n\n3. To 236ml (1 cup) water add 15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or alternative light vinegar) and 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract. Just give that a little stir!\n\n4. Add your water-vinegar liquid to the dry ingredients, along with 80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil). **Mix this quickly.** You want to get this batter into the oven as fast as possible in order to achieve the best rise! A few lumps in the batter is fine, but try to get as much of the flour mixture combined as possible.\n\n5. Pour your deliciously chocolate cake batter into your prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes.\n\n6. Now onto the vegan chocolate icing! To a mixing bowl add 170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar) and 30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder. Mix these ingredients together and then add 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract.\n\n7. Add in water, one tablespoon at a time. I used 45ml (3 tbsp.) for the perfect consistency. Your icing should be thick enough to remain on your cake, but thin enough to spread easily.\n\n8. Remove your cake from the oven, let it cool to room temperature, spread your chocolate icing over the top and let the icing set. If you want to dress your cake up, feel free to add sprinkles, chocolate shavings or your favourite candy on top!\n\n9. Cut into equal squares with a sharp knife \u2013 and serve!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is one of the best vegan chocolate cakes I've ever baked. It's rich, chocolatey and really moist!

Cook the bacon until most of the fat has been rendered and the bacon has started to become crispy.\n3. Add garlic and onions and stir well.

{"title": "How to make your own spice mix or paste. 3 Easy recipes: Za'atar, Harissa and Garam Masala", "selftext": "I will show you how to make several popular spice blends and spice paste at the convenience of your own home. In addition I will share with you some useful techniques and tips which you can apply to make your own spice creations. \n\nWhy would you make your own spice blends: \n\n* First of all, it is very easy\n* It is a lot fresher than a store bought.   \n* Once you try homemade blend or paste/sauce, you will not buy one in a store. \n\nBefore we start making out first blend, let me give you several tips: \n\n* Don\u2019t make a lot of spice blend at once, spices lose their flavor as soon as you grind them\u2026so make as much as you need for a short period of time. \n* Store spices in a cool and dark place in an airtight container \n* Always label your spice mix with the date\u2026..so you know how long it has been around. \n\n**if you are a visual learner, I have quick video tutorial on my channel:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoJ5qKRgRk4**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoJ5qKRgRk4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First, let\u2019s start with Za\u2019atar spice blend** \n\nWhat is Za\u2019atar blend\n\n* It is very popular spice mix in Mediterranean cuisine \n* Za\u2019atar has a lot of health benefits and anti-inflammatory properties. \n* You can use it as seasoning and condiment. It gives a very well rounded herbal flavor. \n\nFor this spice blend you only need 4 ingredients\u2026so it is super simple to make. \n\nIngredients to make it ( makes 2 \u00bd tablespoons ) \n\nThyme - 2 tbsp\n\nSesame seeds - 1 \u00bd tsp\n\nSumac - 1 tsp\n\nTable salt - pinch  \n\n* Collect all the spices. \n* I highly recommend toasting whole and ground spices to release aromatic oils. Plus, toasting spices dries them out a bit, which makes them easier to grind. Toast spices on the skillet for a few minutes until you start feeling an aromatic flavor.\n* Cool them down and then transfer spices to a spice grinder or a coffee grinder to finely ground. All done, our Za\u2019atar mix is ready! \n\nHow to use Za\u2019atar: \n\n* Sprinkle it over eggs \n* Combine with olive oil to make a paste to bake on top of the bread\n* It also goes well with roasted potatoes or fries \n* You can even combine it with breading \n\n**Ok, now let\u2019s make Harissa paste:**\n\nHarissa paste is a North African chili paste or a hot sauce ( if you want, you can make it a little or a very spicy ) \n\nIngredients ( makes 1 cup ) \n\nExtra-virgin olive oil - \u00bd cup\n\nGarlic cloves - 6 pcs\n\nLemon juice - 2 tbsp ( half a lemon ) \n\nPaprika ( sweet or smokey ) - 2 tbsp \n\nMix of Aleppo & Chili peppers - 3-4 dried peppers ( or 2 \u00bd tbsp of dried red pepper ) \n\nSweet red bell pepper ( roasted ) - 1 pcs\n\nTomato paste - 2 tbsp\n\nCoriander - 2 tbsp\n\nCumin - 2 tsp\n\nTable salt - 1 tsp \n\n* Roast bell pepper in the oven for 20 min at 400\u00b0F\n* Rehydrate dried peppers. Put them in hot water under the lid for 30 minutes. Remove seeds if you want less spicy paste. If you want more heat, keep some seeds in. \n* Peel garlic.\n* Toast cumin and coriander to enhance flavor. When cooled down, finely crush them in the spice grinder. \n\nCooking tip: If you don\u2019t have a spice grinder or coffee grinder, use manual methods such as mortar and pestle, rolling pin or bottom of the skillet against the wooden board. Manual method works well for small amounts of spices.  \n\n* Now, mix all ingredients in the food processor until it becomes a paste. Stream in oil in the process. Now, taste it to see if it needs more salt. \n\nHow to use Harissa: \n\nUse with chicken, vegetables, meat or fish. Also, it works great as a marinade.  Eat with bread and olive oil. You can add it to shakshuka and pretty much use it as a hot sauce. \n\n**Last, but not least Garam Masala spice blend**\n\nGaram masala is a spice blend widely used in Indian cuisine, from curries and lentil dishes to soups. Also, Garam Masala makes a great seasoning for meat. \n\nIngredients ( makes 3 \u00bd  tbsp )\n\nBlack peppercorns - 1 tbsp\n\nCoriander seeds - 2 \u00bd tsp\n\nCardamom pods - 1 \u00bd tsp \n\nCumin seeds - 1tsp \n\nCinnamon stick - 3 inch \n\nBay leaves - 2 pcs\n\nStar anise pods - 6pcs \n\n* Collect all spices \n* Toast spices on the skillet to bring out the flavor \n* Process all ingredients in the spice grinder for 20-30 seconds until finely groud\n\nAll done, your spice mix is ready! \n\nAdd this spice mix at the end of the cooking process to add more amazing flavor and aroma to your dish!\n\nAnd final cooking tip for today: \n\nSprinkle food with seasoning from about a foot hight above the dish.....it makes seasoning distribute more evenly and as result your dish will taste better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wxqfxh/how_to_make_your_own_spice_mix_or_paste_3_easy/", "created_utc": 1661463817.0, "score": 27, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wxqfxh/how_to_make_your_own_spice_mix_or_paste_3_easy/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Thinnest pizza out there.", "selftext": "Okay, this one takes a little more time but is really easy. \n\nThis recipe is for the thinnest pizza dough you can make.\n\nI also made a video explaining every step. [Video](https://youtu.be/MSPr7DJBniw) (recipe starts at 0:08 and ends at about 7:41)\n\nEstimated time: 2-8 Hours for the dough to rise after that about 30-40min, serving 4 people.\n\nDough Mix\n\n250 gram flour \n\n1 tea spoon sugar\n\n1 tea spoon salt\n\n1 tea spoon yeast\n\n2 table spoons of olive oil \n\nand about 130-150 ml water (room temperature)\n\nSauce \n\npureed Tomatoes / caned tomatoes \n\n1 teaspoon of salt \n\ndried oregano, basil, rosemary, savory and thyme (only dried basil valid as well) \n\nCheese \n\n320g young gouda, 80g for each pizza\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis amounts to 4 really thin medium pizzas originally the amount was meant for 2 large pizzas. \n\nAfter mixing everything I\u00b4ll let the dough get knead by a kneading machine but you can mix by hand as well. Make sure when you mix the dough by hand to knead it thoroughly and fold the dough upon itself. After about 5-10 min of kneading with the machine or 10-15 min by hand the dough should be ready to rest. Lightly cover the dough and the bowl with some olive oil this will prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl to much. Than cover the dough with a wet towel and let the it rest for at least 2 hours, 8 hours is the ideal time. You can also split the dough after 2 hours into smaller pieces and let them rise individually, for me that made no significant difference to the result to justify using more dishes. \n\nAfter the dough has risen long enough you just got to make a tomato sauce, choose your toping and get some shredded cheese. \n\nIf you start making the sauce you can turn on your oven best would be maximum heat. For me this is 250\u00b0C but this differs between ovens. A Oven with upper and lower heat would be best but a convection oven is fine. Also Preheat your backing tray. \n\nFor the tomato sauce I used, pureed tomatoes without any additives. You can also use caned tomatoes and puree them yourself. I would advice against premade sauce but this is up you. pour the pureed tomatoes into a bowl, as I bough it in a package I rinse the inside with a little bit of water and shake the package and pour it into the puree as well. To compensate the water in the puree I add about a table spoon of tomato paste. Next I add 1 tablespoon of a mixture of spices that are a specific combination for pizza, consisting of dried oregano, basil, rosemary, savory and thyme. I am not sure how available this mixture of spices is but in my experience adding only 1 table spoon of dried basil to the tomato puree is a valid substitute. Add about 1 tea spoon of salt and mix the sauce. You can add garlic powder and ground black pepper or chili flakes if you want to spice up the sauce. As Cheese I use a young gouda in big slices, I cut them in half twice and than shred it myself. Pre shred cheese sometimes has something added that prevents it from clumping that impacts its melting capabilities. While shredding I make sure to shred the cheese vertical and horizontal to get longer cheese stripes and small bit in a nice proportion to each other. The amount of cheese you wanna use is totally up to you. I like a little less cheese. \n\nNow with everything ready its time to roll out the dough. First put down some backing sheet, add some flour and start to cover the dough piece you want to roll out in flour. I like to start stretching the dough by hand, where I softly pinch it and than stretch it gently and this all around while holding the dough up. Once the dough is bigger than my stretched palm I put it down, now you can use a rolling pin to stretch the dough further and even out the thickness. I sometimes like to use my hands to stretch the dough all the way because it give it a unevenness which has an appeal of its own. Both methods are fine your choice which ever you prefer. Now that the dough is spread add about 3 stable spoons of the tomato sauce spread the sauce on the dough by grabbing the spoon close to the big part and than try to spread the sauce with circular movements and tilt the spoon, tilt it inward to the center of the dough if you want to spread the sauce outwards. Tilt it outwards to the edge of the dough if you want to reduce the amount of sauce near the edge. try to make it as homogenous as possible and than add the toping you want. there are two ways of how to handle the toping. you can either put the toping beneath or above the cheese both methods have its pros and cons. I like it beneath the cheese. If you spread the cheese beyond the pizza onto the backing sheet you can use the backing sheet to get the cheese bits back onto the pizza. \n\nNow comes the most difficult part. I am able to do it alone because I have a lot of experience doing it. I take out the pre heated backing tray and pull the pizza onto it by garbing the backing sheet beneath it. I rest the backing try on the edge of the counter because I know it can withstand the heat of the tray for a couple of seconds. You can take the hot tray out and put it on the stove so you can use both your hand to grab the backing sheet, if you have another Person by your side they can support you as well. Once the pizza is on the tray you can put it back into the oven. For a temperature of 250\u00b0C it takes between 7-8 mins. Always make sure you check upon your pizza. If the cheese looks good to you check if the dough also has become a little brown. If both the cheese and the underside of the dough are to your likening you can take the pizza out. Let it rest for a short while and than cut it. I use a pizza scissors.\n\nAnd finished. Enjoy your thinnest pizza.\n\nThere is no pizza tag =/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wtxg1r/thinnest_pizza_out_there/", "created_utc": 1661081607.0, "score": 4, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wtxg1r/thinnest_pizza_out_there/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Peach Chicken | The Ultimate Chicken Dinner?", "selftext": "My peach chicken recipe is the ultimate chicken dinner! Why?! It's quick and easy to make (40 minutes and one pot!), it's packed with the delicious flavours of fresh peaches, fresh basil, runny honey and a reduced balsamic vinegar, and it's healthy!\n\nYou can find the recipe video here, which includes a few handy tips and tricks! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyGD9mwdumg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyGD9mwdumg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 1Kg (2.2lbs) chicken thighs\n* 4 peaches\n* 30ml (2 tbsp.) runny honey\n* 120ml (1/2 cup) balsamic vinegar \n* 130-160ml (2/3 cup) chicken stock\n* 6 garlic cloves, minced\n* 60ml (4 tbsp.) olive oil\n* 1g (1/2 tsp.) black pepper\n* 11g (2 tsp.) salt\n* a few basil leaves (for decoration)\n\n\\-----\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200C (400F). De-stone 4 peaches and slice them into wedges. I like to leave the skins on, as this adds a beautiful colour to the dish! Now skin and crush 6 cloves of garlic.  \n\n2. Pat down your chicken thighs (or breasts!) with kitchen roll to remove any moisture and then season generously with salt and black pepper.\n\n3. To a large oven-safe pan, add 60ml (4 tbsp.) olive oil and heat on medium-high. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add your chicken skin side down. Season the other side of the chicken thighs/breasts with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. Once the skin begins to brown, flip the chicken over \u2013 and when the underneath has also browned, move the thighs/breasts to a clean plate. The chicken will not be cooked through at this stage.\n\n4. Let\u2019s make the sauce! Into the pan we\u2019ve just used, add your crushed garlic to the chicken fat. Let it cook for around 60 seconds before adding 130-160ml (2/3 cup) chicken stock, 30ml (2 tbsp.) runny honey and 120ml (1/2 cup) balsamic vinegar. Let the sauce reduce down by half. \n\n5. Now add in your peaches! Let them cook in the sauce for 5 minutes before adding the chicken. If there\u2019s any chicken juice on the plate, pour that in too! It\u2019s all flavour! Nestle the chicken into the peaches, but be sure the top of the chicken pieces are exposed. \n\n6. Place the pan into your pre-heated oven and cook for 25-30 minutes \u2013 or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165F (74C).\n\n7. For the finishing touch, let\u2019s chiffonade some basil! Take approximately 10 leaves of basil, stack them, roll them into a cigar shape and then finely chop into thin slices. You should be left with strings of basil!\n\n8. As soon as your chicken comes out of the oven, sprinkle on your basil \u2026 and serve!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love the ease and convenience of one pot chicken dishes! A delicious meal followed by less washing up afterwards is always a winner in my book! If you don\u2019t like peaches, be sure to check out my \u2018Marry Me\u2019 chicken recipe, which is very similar to Tuscan chicken. You can find it on my YouTube channel, or here on Reddit! \n\nI hope you love this recipe \u2013 and if you do make it, let me know how you get on!! If you have a picture of your dish, share it with me and I\u2019ll post it on my socials!

{"title": "Battered and fried zucchini", "selftext": "Okay, this one might be a little less easy but still not that hard. \n\nThis recipe is for battered and fried zucchini slices. It\u2019s not that quick but it tastes quite good. Like everything else that is fried. \n\n I also made a video explaining every step.  [Video](https://youtu.be/kmba1SIDyzI) (recipe starts at 1:03 and ends at about 4:35)\n\nEstimated time: 18-24min, serving 2 people.\n\nIngredients: \n\n1 Zucchini\n\n3 Eggs\n\nHalf a cup of Flour\n\n100 grams of Cornstarch / little less than half a cup\n\n2 teaspoons of smoked paprika\n\n1 teaspoon of salt\n\n1 teaspoon of ground black pepper\n\n1 teaspoon of garlic powder\n\n   \n \n\nSlice the zucchini into slices that are about 1-1,5 cm (half an inch) thick.\n\nCrack the eggs and put them into a deep plate where you can whisk them with the smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and garlic. Add the cornstarch to the mix. I would advise you to sieve the starch in, to reduce the number of clumps. Once the batter is prepared you need one more deep plate in which you can pour the Flour. \n\nPut a pan on the stove at medium to high heat and pour some oil in. Not too much you can add more later. \n\nTake the zucchini slices and thoroughly cover them with flour on both sides and then put them into the batter, flip them once and take them out. Hover the slice over the batter to drain the excess batter. Then and the battered slice to the frying pan. About 2-3 min per side but that heavily depends on the thickness of the slices. Once the batter is gold brown on both sides you are finished. Enjoy. \n\nSome Notes: \n\nYou can salt the zucchini slices once cut to reduce the moisture and probably prevent them from becoming overly soggy after frying but you don\u00b4t have to.\n\nYou can add any other spices you want to the batter.\n\nFor adding the corn starch, you could dissolve it in water to avoid clumps but that will make the batter more watery and less thick. \n\nIf the battered slice starts to fry immediately upon putting it into the pan, perfect if not the oil was not hot enough. You can test this with anything wooden. Just hold it into the oil and if there are bubbles forming at the wood the temperature is good. \n\nIf you want a reference on how I made it, I\u2019ll happily share my video with you just DM me. \n\nSlicing zucchini: 3min\n\nmixing the batter: 3min\n\nfrying the zucchini: 12-18 min (depends on the size of zucchini and therefore the number of slices and the size of the pan. 1 Zucchini = 10-15 slices, 5-6 slices fit in a pan. 2-3 min each side. More slices = thinner slices, less slices = thicker slices.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wp37dc/battered_and_fried_zucchini/", "created_utc": 1660579095.0, "score": 70, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wp37dc/battered_and_fried_zucchini/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Slice 500g of smoked bacon into small pieces and drop into a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat.\n2. Finely chop 1 white onion and 6 shallots.\n3. Be sure to stir the bacon occasionally. If there are any large clumps of bacon, break these up with a wooden spoon. Once the bacon has rendered out the majority of it\u2019s fat, remove the bacon pieces from the pan and place onto a dish.\n4. Add your onions and shallots to the saut\u00e9 pan, and grate into 2 cloves of garlic. These will begin to cook in the bacon fat. Continue cooking until the onions become caramelized.\n5. Now add your bacon pieces back into the saut\u00e9 pan! Add 4 dried chilis. I\u2019ve deseeded my chilis, as I\u2019m not keen on heat, but you can leave the seeds in \u2013 or add a few more chilis!\n6. Add a healthy grating of nutmeg, as well as 2 tbsp. maple syrup, and stir thoroughly.\n7.

The recipe comes together in **20 minutes**, so it\u2019s the perfect mid-week meal!    \n\nIf you\u2019d prefer to make you pasta puttanesca **vegetarian**, leave out the fish and add a squeeze of tomato paste! \ud83e\udd1f     \n\n\u2705**Full recipe here, with some additional tips and tricks!** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KESS7MTaQ-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KESS7MTaQ-8)\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccd **Ingredients**\n\n* 500g spaghetti\n* 4 garlic cloves\n* 160g black olives, pitted\n* 95g sardines in tomato sauce (or anchovies)\n* 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil\n* 60g capers, washed\n* 400g diced tomatoes\n* a good grating of parmesan to serve (optional)\n* salt, for the pasta water  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **Method:**  \n\n1. Put a big pot of water onto boil for the spaghetti (or any other pasta you have at hand)! Next crush 4 cloves of garlic and roughly chop 160g of black olives that have been pitted.\n\n2. To a large saut\u00e9 pan, add \u00bc cup (60ml) olive oil and let it begin to heat. Then add in your garlic and stir for around 20 seconds. Now add in your fish! I\u2019m using sardines in tomato sauce \u2013 and I always like to double check to ensure the sardines have no bones hidden inside!\n\n3. Add in 60g of capers. I like to rinse my capers in a bowl of cold water, just to remove some of the excess saltiness. Next, add in your black olives and cook the mixture for 1-2 minutes, allowing for all those beautiful flavours to mingle!\n\n4. Add in 1 can (400g) of diced tomatoes and give it a good stir!\n\n5. Generously salt your boiling water and add in your pasta \u2013 500g spaghetti or similar. Cook to al dente (firm to the bite), as per the instructions on your pasta packet. Then straight from the boiling water, use a spaghetti spoon (or tongs!) to add your pasta to your puttanesca sauce. The starch from the pasta water helps to create a creamy sauce!\n\n6. Give your pasta a good stir to cover it thoroughly in the sauce! Your sauce will likely still be too thick at this stage, so we\u2019ll loosen it up with more of the pasta water. I like to start with \u00bd cup (120ml) and add more if needed.\n\n7. It\u2019s not traditional, but I like to add a good grating of parmesan before serving \u2013 optional, but recommended!\n\n8. Serve on a plate and top with fresh parsley \u2013 and enjoy! \ud83d\ude0b     \n\n\nI hope you enjoy this pasta puttanesca as much as my family does!

Cook rice. I am using Nishiki rice for my recipe ( use short or medium grain rice which sticks well together ). You can cook rice the traditional way or use Instant Pot which makes it quite simple, instructions below: \n   1. Measure 2 cups and rinse rice well to remove extra starch. \n   2. Add 1 cup of water to the instant pot then add trivet and place the insert pan with rice on it. Add 2 cups of water and 2 tsp of salt inside the rice. I always use a 1 to 1 ratio of rice to water when cooking rice in the Instant Pot, it always works great! \n   3. Set Instant Pot on high temperature for 6 minutes and wait for natural pressure release. \n   4. When rice is ready, carefully mix in 2 tbsp of rice vinegar, 2 tsp of coconut aminos and 2 tsp of toasted sesame oil. \n   5. Let the rice cool down a bit for \\~5 minutes on the parchment paper. \n2. When rice cools down, make 16-18 round shaped balls and flatten them with your hands to create small rice cakes. Constantly wet your hands with water, so rice doesn't stick to your hands. \n\n**Optional step: if you have more time on your hands and want to create a more perfect rice square shape cakes, I will recommend several extra steps:** \n\n1. **Place rice in the glass container lined with plastic wrap, compress the rice with hands or spoon to flatten it out to about 1 inch thick layer and cover with the lid.** \n2. **Refrigerate rice for at least a couple of hours or ideally overnight.** \n3. **remove rice from the container on the flat surface, remove plastic wrap and cut with a knife in square or rectangular pieces.** \n4. To make crispy rice sushi cakes, I will use an air fryer. Gently spray the air fryer tray and rice cakes with oil on both sides. Air fry rice cakes for 16-18 minutes ( depending on the air fryer model ) at 350\u00b0F. Check in the middle if you need to flip them, I didn\u2019t have to.  \n5. Make sauce: mix mayo, sriracha sauce and lime juice. Use a plastic squeeze bottle, to make it easier to mix and for precision dispensing\n6. Prepare toppings: thinly slice cucumbers, jalape\u00f1o and avocado. You can use any smoked fish of your choice: I am using 2 kinds of smoked salmon and smoked trout. \n7. Place your toppings on the rice cakes starting with the sauce, cucumber, avocado, smoked fish and top it off with jalape\u00f1o pepper. Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top. Decorate plate with cilantro and lime slices. \n\nServe right away.

Cut a piece of plastic wrap large enough to loosely cover the plate of potato wedges\n5. Depending on your on the power of your microwave, you'll microwave the potato wedges for 4 to 6 minutes\n6. Add 2 tablespoons of potato starch to a small bowl\n7. Add 2 pinches each of salt & black pepper to the bowl\n8. Mix everything in the bowl\n9. After the microwave is done cooking the potato wedges, check if it's fully cooked by poking a fork through a wedge. If the fork tines easily go through the wedge then it's done cooking.\n10. Put the wedges in a bag big enough to hold them all and to shake them around too.\n11. Add potato starch mixture into the bag\n12. Seal the bag so nothing comes out.\n\n13 Toss the wedges around in the bag to coat each wedge with the potato starch mixture\n\n14. Put a large pan on the stovetop\n\n15.

{"title": "Easy and Amazing Sandwich", "selftext": " This sandwich is really easy you just got to prepare some ingredients and then assemble everything. \n\nMost ingredients are interchangeable. You don\u2019t need to use chicken breast sausage, eggs, or bacon you can use some kind of cheese if you want to. The Tomato slices are optional as well. You can even exchange the salad-mayo-mustard mixture for coleslaw. I just want to encourage you to try it out and develop a good understanding for yourself. \n\nSharing an easy and tasty sandwich recipe, everyone can make.\n\n I also made a video explaining every step.  [Video](https://youtu.be/xDnRJKgMrJ0)\n\nEstimated time: 20-35min. Calculations at the end.\n\n1 Sandwich needs:\n\n3 Slices of Toast \n\n2 Slices of chicken breast sausage\n\n2 Bacon strips\n\n2 salad leaves\n\n1 slice of tomato \n\nhalf of a boiled egg\n\n1 Tablespoon of mayo \n\n1/4 of a teaspoon of mustard \n\nPinch of salt and black pepper\n\n   \n \n\nDepending on the number of sandwiches you want to make you can either start with boiling the eggs, toasting the toast, or frying the bacon. Each of the tasks can be done simultaneously. Boil the eggs for at least 8min to make sure they are cooked through. I fry the bacon inside the microwave on a plate with a paper towel to soak the excessive fat that the bacon releases while cooking. Depending on your microwaves power it can take between 1 1/2 min - 3 min. If you do it for the first time watch the bacon closely. Wash the tomato and the salad leaves. Cut the tomato into thin slices starting from the bottom and chop towards where the stem used to be. Make sure to get rid of as much excess water as possible from the salad leaves after washing. Chop the salad leaves into thin strips and add them to a bowl. Mix them with the mayo and the mustard until the salad strips are covered. If the eggs are finished boiling put them in some cold water or rinse them under a cold-water stream. Once the eggs are cool enough to handle, crack the shell and start peeling them once peeled try to cut them thinly. Cutting eggs thin is not easy just try your best. Once the bacon is finished frying we can start the assembling process. \n\nStart with a slice of toast. Add 2 slices of chicken breast sausage. On top that add a loaded spoon of the salad, mayo, mustard mixture. Top it with another slice of toast. Add the salad, mayo, mustard mixture again. Then a slice of the tomato, some of the egg slices. Once the eggs are on you can season them with some salt and pepper. Add the Bacon stripes and finish the sandwich with a slice of toast. To make it stable you can pierce the sandwich with 2 toothpicks diagonally. Cut the sandwich diagonally between the 2 toothpicks.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n   \n \n\nI would advise you to at least make a couple of sandwiches to justify the amount of work you got to do.\n\nThe time calculations are pretty depending on how many you want to make. With the minimum time depending on the boiling time for the eggs and the maximum depending on the amount of toast you got to toast. So, my calculations are for about 6 sandwiches. Which is almost equal to a pack of toast.\n\nCan be done at the same time:\n\n\\[\n\n20min Toasting.\n\n10-20min for the bacon, this varies greatly.\n\n10-12 min cooking eggs\n\n15min for cleaning and chopping vegetables.\n\n\\]\n\n10min assembling the sandwiches", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wby7ua/easy_and_amazing_sandwich/", "created_utc": 1659189683.0, "score": 71, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wby7ua/easy_and_amazing_sandwich/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Panzanella - A Classic Bread and Tomato Salad From Tuscany, Italy!", "selftext": "Panzanella salad combines leftover stale bread, beautiful tomatoes and a range of vegetables to create the most delicious, fresh and flavoursome salad! It's a traditional Italian salad that originates from the Tuscany region and is perfect for these warmer evenings!\n\nThere are many ways to make a good Panzanella salad, but I love to use heirloom tomatoes for colour and sweetness, as well as artichokes, which are not a traditional addition, but work really well in this salad! Optional, but highly recommended!\n\nI've also topped my Panzanella with mozzarella di bufala, but you can use any kind of mozzarella, or omit the cheese to keep this salad vegan friendly! \n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyie-KENDxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyie-KENDxc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 1/2 loaf stale good quality bread (approx. 2 cups worth)\n* 4 heirloom tomatoes\n* 1/2 cucumber\n* 1/2 red onion\n* 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar\n* 6 tbsp. olive oil\n* 2 tbsp. (35g) capers\n* 1 jar (380g) artichokes (optional)\n* basil leaves\n* salt and pepper to season\n* 1 mozzarella di bufala ball, ripped into pieces (optional)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200C (400F). Tear up your (stale) bread into large chunks and place them into a baking tray. You can use any bread, but I\u2019d recommend a sourdough or a crispy Italian loaf! Pour over 2 tbsp. of a good quality olive oil, season generously with salt and combine this altogether! \n\n2. Bake your bread chunks for 5-10 minutes, or until nice and toasty! You can also fry your bread chunks in a frying pan if you don\u2019t have an oven.\n\n3. Slice 4 heirloom tomatoes into chunks. If you can\u2019t find heirloom tomatoes, try to find a tomato that\u2019s on the vine! Add these to a large bowl. \n\n4. Slice half a cucumber length-wise and deseed with a small spoon. Then chop your cucumber halves width-wise to create half-moon slices. Place these into a bowl with your chopped tomatoes.\n\n5. Artichokes are not traditional, but I love adding them to my panzanella for that salty, briny flavour and additional texture! Slice half a red onion into rounds. **Tip:** Soak your onion pieces in water for 15 minutes, just to remove some of the sharpness. Add the artichokes and onion to your large bowl.\n\n6. Once your bread is ready, take it out of the oven and allow it to cool slightly. Rinse off 2 tbsp. capers and add them to your bowl of vegetables. Pick and wash some fresh basil leaves and add to your salad.\n\n7. Now for the dressing! Into a bowl, add 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar, 4 tbsp. olive oil, a good sprinkling of salt and a crack of black pepper. Give your dressing a really good stir!\n\n8. Add your bread chunks to your vegetable and mix together. Now add your dressing and give your salad another good mix!\n\n9. It\u2019s ready to serve! I like to add some torn up pieces of mozzarella di bufala to mine, but you can use any kind of mozzarella \u2013 or omit the cheese to keep this salad vegan friendly!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to add protein to this salad, tuna packed in olive oil is a family favourite! It's so warm here in the UK, we've been making salads most evenings and this one is a classic for a reason! There's a small amount of oven usage, but it's a super easy salad and hopefully will help you keep cool through this heatwave! If you do make this, let me know! I'd love to know how you get on!! \n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/w0ijep/panzanella_a_classic_bread_and_tomato_salad_from/", "created_utc": 1657983501.0, "score": 4, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/w0ijep/panzanella_a_classic_bread_and_tomato_salad_from/", "html_title": ""}

Pat dry the chicken breast fillets and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in flour and shake off the excess (this is important). ***NOTE*** \\- Cook your pasta now and reserve a little bit of the pasta water if you'd like to use it to thicken your sauce later. To help keep your pasta from drying out, add a little olive oil and toss it in a bowl, then keep the bowl in a microwave to keep it insulate.\n2. In a large skillet over medium high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the butter and oil start to sizzle, add the chicken in batches, 2 pieces at a time, and cook the chicken until it's browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and transfer chicken to a foil-lined plate after it's browned and melt 2 more tablespoons butter before starting the second batch. ***NOTE*** \\- The chicken stays  tender and juicy as long as there is enough butter/oil in the pan, so make sure to top up the skillet with a little extra olive oil if it looks dry. If you don't shake the excess flour off the chicken, the oil will become gummy and gross.\n3. After all the chicken is cooked and removed from the pan, add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the lemon juice, stock, and capers to the pan and bring to boil, scraping up fond from the pan (the burny bits left from the chicken). Once the sauce is boiling, return all chicken to the pan and reduce heat, simmering for 5 minutes. ***NOTE*** *-* Using fresh lemon juice is key, and adding the capers with a bit of their brine will also help add brightness to the sauce. A lot of recipes will tell you to rinse the capers, but I think this makes the sauce worse. It does make the sauce saltier, though, so use unsalted butter if you can.\n4. Remove the chicken from the skillet and move to a platter. Add the remaining butter (\\~2 tbs) to the sauce and stir until thickened. Remove sauce from heat and add half the parsley, reserving the rest for garnish.

Preheat the oven to 475 F.\n2. In the meanwhile, cut the potatoes into slices 1/4 inch thick. In a large bowl, add the fries and fill with water. Let the fries soak for at least 25 minutes.\n3. In the meanwhile, set a large pot of water to boil.\n4. Add soaked fries to the boiling water and boil for 3-5 minutes, or until the potatoes are partly cooked but still firm.\n5. Drain the potatoes onto paper towel and gently pat dry.\n6. Transfer fries to a large enough bowl and season with salt and olive oil. Layer a large baking tray with parchment paper and place the fries on it. Bake the fries on the middle rack for 20 minutes or until they are light golden brown\n7. Once lightly browned, move the rack and tray to the lowest oven rack bake until crispy, about 15-20 minutes flipping once to ensure each side is crisp.  \nFor the cheese sauce\n8. When the fries are almost done, start the sauce. Heat a pan on medium heat and add butter. Once the butter melts, mix in the flour and whisk for 2-3 mins until the rawness of the flour is cooked out. The rue will begin to smell nutty, which is a good indicator.\n9. Pour in your milk, little bit at a time while whisking to work out any lumps. Once all your milk is mixed in, wait until your sauce starts to come up to a simmer.\n10. As soon as the sauce comes to a simmer, it will begin to thicken. Once the b\u00e9chamel is thick enough to evenly coat the back of a spoon, season with cayenne pepper, salt and pepper.\n11. Remove the pan off the heat and add in all of the cheese. Whisk well to combine until the cheese is molten.  \nTo assemble the cheese fries\n12. Remove the fries from the oven and arrange in a bowl or plate.\n13. Pour the cheese sauce over the fries and garnish with chopped chives.

{"title": "The NOT Jennifer Aniston Salad! \ud83c\udf4b\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "This is my take on the famous and trending Jennifer Aniston salad recipe! Jennifer has recently debunked the myth that she ate this salad on the set of Friends everyday for 10 years, so you could say this is the 'Not Jennifer Aniston Salad'! However all I can say is, she's missing out! This salad is healthy, delicious and super easy to make!\n\nYou can easily make this Jennifer Aniston salad recipe vegan by omitting the feta cheese - and if you still want that briny salty flavor, add olives instead! Want to make this gluten free? Substitute the bulger wheat for quinoa!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, my recipe video is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mqdp713ZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mqdp713ZE)\n\n\\-----**Ingredients**  \n\n\n* 200g (1 cup) bulger wheat, uncooked\n* 120g (1 cup) cucumber\n* 52g (1/2 cup) red onion\n* 30g (1/2 cup) parsley\n* 8g (1/4 cup) mint\n* 250g (1 cup) feta cheese\n* 425g (15oz) chickpeas\n* 50g (1/2 cup) pistachios\n* 60ml (1/4 cup) lemon juice\n* 30ml (2 tbsp.) olive oil\n* salt and pepper to season\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. To a saucepan full of boiling water, add a good sprinkling of salt - as if you were cooking pasta - and the add 200g bulger wheat. Be sure to check the cooking times on the packaging of your bulger wheat, but mine took around 10-15 minutes to cook.\n2. Prep your vegetables! I like to cut my cucumbers lengthwise and then remove the seeds within with a teaspoon. I then cut the de-seeded cucumbers widthwise into semi-circles. Next, finely chop 50g of red onion. **Tip:** If you find raw onion a bit too strong in terms of flavour, simply soak the onion pieces in a bowl of water for 15 minutes, before you use them in this (or any other!) recipe!\n3. Deshell and finely chop your pistachios. If you can find pistachios that have already been deshelled, this will save you some time! Next, wash and chop your parsley and mint.\n4. Onto the dressing! Freshly squeeze 60ml of lemon juice and sieve the liquid to ensure no pips are included! **Tip:** A great way to get the most juice out of a lemon is to simply microwave the lemon for 20 seconds!\n5. To the lemon juice, add 2 tbsp. good quality extra virgin olive oil, 2 tsp. salt and a good amount of freshly cracked black pepper.\n6. Your bulger wheat should be ready! Simply strain the bulger wheat in a sieve and then place the sieve over the hot, empty pan. Any excess steam will help dry out the bulger wheat.\n7. Into a large bowl, add your bulger wheat and all of your vegetables! Next, add in 425g chickpeas and crumble 250g feta cheese over the top. Pour in your dressing and give the salad a good toss!\n8. Serve - and enjoy!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis recipe serves 4 people generously, but if you have any leftovers, they'll last in the fridge for up to 3 days!

Line an 8\u201d square baking pan with parchment paper and place your Digestive biscuits (or Graham crackers) into a food processor. Blend until the mixture resembles a sand-like consistency. You can do this by hand, by placing the biscuits in a food safe bag and hitting them with a rolling pin, but be sure to break up any large pieces of biscuit!\n2. Add 50g walnuts to your processor \u2013 or finely chop with a knife/smash with a rolling pin! Add 85g desiccated coconut to the biscuit-walnut combination and mix!\n3. Place a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of boiling water and after ensuring the water is at a gentle simmer, add 115g butter, 50g sugar and 38g cocoa powder. Stir this mixture until all of the ingredients have melted together and the liquid is smooth and velvety.\n4. Add 2 eggs to the heatproof bowl and stir continuously for 15-30 seconds. Once combined, carefully remove the heatproof bowl from the saucepan and add in your ground biscuit mixture! Stir thoroughly until everything is covered in the chocolate mix.\n5. Pour into your prepared pan. Push the mixture down with a spatula to create a solid first layer. Be sure to get the mixture into each corner.\n6. Time for the custard buttercream! In a bowl, cream 60g butter until smooth, and then stir in 30g custard powder until the mixture is smooth again. Now pour in 245g icing sugar and 44ml double (heavy) cream. Keep stiring until the mixture becomes thick and bright yellow! You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready if you push your finger into the buttercream and it leaves an imprint.\n7. Dollop your custard filling all over your biscuit base. The buttercream can be tricky to spread, so I like to run a metal spoon under some hot water, quickly dry it and use the heat to push the buttercream around. If you lift up any of the biscuit base below, just push it back. Don\u2019t worry; it won\u2019t affect the taste! Push your buttercream layer into all the corners, creating a second flat layer!\n8. Chop 115g dark (semi-sweet) chocolate and add it to a heatproof bowl atop a saucepan filled with water on a low simmer. Add 28g butter and stir until the chocolate has fully melted. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let the chocolate cool to around body temperature.\n9. Pour the chocolate layer onto your custard layer and spread with a spatula. Sprinkle with some sea salt (optional) and chill in a refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\n10. Slice your Nanaimo bars into \u2018brownie-sized\u2019 squares and enjoy!  \n\n\nThere's a reason these are a classic across Canada! I hope you'll love them too! **I do realise there are quite a few ingredients involved and you might not class this as an 'easy' recipe. Apologies if so!** But this recipe is really easy to make and difficult to get wrong!

Eggs, sugar, peanut butter (Skippy natural with honey), flour, baking soda, almond milk, and butter was my last attempt and the batter was definitely tasty.  \n\nBut the cookies keep ending up very hard, the texture is always very off and very rough.  The cookie never tastes as good as the batter, when they don't expand and merge together into like pancakes.  I've seen videos on Youtube about how to make cookies, and there people can mold the batter into little balls.  I've never managed that, they're always too runny, even when I put them in the fridge for several hours.  They always stick to the pan.  Admittedly I don't have non-stick pans or the special paper, but I've been putting olive oil and butter on the plate, which helps it stop stick but also tends to make the cookie greasy.  I wonder also how much of this is due to using a microwave oven?  \n\nI figure I have to be making a lot of mistakes, so I'd appreciate any guidance into if it's possible to make a decent cookie how I've been trying or if this is very mistaken and how I rectify it.  Thank you so much for your time and Happy Wednesday!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vsgiul/suggestions_for_making_peanut_butter_cookies_with/", "created_utc": 1657079051.0, "score": 6, "author": "Rompiendome_lacabeza", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vsgiul/suggestions_for_making_peanut_butter_cookies_with/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Almond Slices - Like Bakewell Slices, But Better!! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "This almond slice recipe is a take on the traditional English Bakewell slice, but I've substituted the pastry base with a buttery shortbread biscuit base! Atop this shortbread base sits a delicious and inviting raspberry jam layer, followed by a layer of frangipane sponge, and finished with a sprinkling of flaked almonds!\n\nIt's the perfect treat all year round and a new favourite amongst my family and friends!! If you don't like raspberry jam, feel free to experiment with other flavours of jam! Apricot jam would be amazing in these slices!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-QSrbb4eck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-QSrbb4eck)\n\n\\-----\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Shortbread Base:**\n\n* 175g butter, room temperature\n* 75g caster sugar\n* 225g plain or all purpose flour\n\n**Frangipane Sponge / Jam Layers:**\n\n* 100g butter, room temperature\n* 100g caster sugar\n* 2 eggs\n* 50g almond flour (or ground almonds)\n* 50g plain flour\n* 1/2 tsp. almond extract\n* 150g raspberry jam, seedless\n* a big handful of flaked almonds\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**  \n\n\n**Shortbread Base**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 170C (325F) and line a 20cm x 30cm pan with butter and parchment paper.\n2. Into a mixing bowl, cream together 175g butter (room temperature) and 75g caster sugar. You\u2019ll know when both ingredients are fully combined, as the mixture will lighten in colour and become smoother to mix!\n3. At this point, add 225g plain flour (or all purpose) and combine until it\u2019s a stiff, but crumbly dough. I find the best way to do this is with my hands! You don\u2019t want to over mix at this stage; otherwise your shortbread base will be tough and chewy.\n4. Sprinkle your base layer into your prepared pan and then press down to create a layer of even thickness. Be sure to get your dough into the corners and edges too! If you don\u2019t want to push down with your hands, use the flat bottom of a large glass. Finally, with a fork, generously prick the shortbread dough. This will help with the rise and allow for an even bake.\n5. Bake for 20 \u2013 25 minutes, until light golden!\n\n**Frangipane Sponge**\n\n6. Into a mixing bowl, cream together 100g butter (room temperature) and 100g caster sugar. Once fully combined, swap your spoon for a whisk, add in 2 eggs and whisk until fully combined and smooth.\n\n7. Add 50g almond flour, 50g plain flour and \u00bd tsp. almond extract. Mix together.\n\n8. Remove your shortbread layer from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Dollop on the seedless raspberry jam (or any other flavour!) onto the shortbread. I find blasting the jam in a microwave for 10-20 seconds makes it easier to spread! With the back of a spoon, spread your jam across the shortbread to create an even layer.\n\n9. Dollop on your sponge batter and then gently spread it across the jam layer. You don\u2019t want the jam and sponge to combine and you don\u2019t want any jam poking through! Finally, sprinkle on a handful of flaked almonds.\n\n10. Bake for another 20 \u2013 25 minutes. Once out of the oven, allow your bake to cool to room temperature. Cut your slices as big or as small as you like, but this should make around 16 slices/portions! Enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you love this recipe as much as I do!!

Slice onions half moons about \u00bc inch thick slices. I would recommend pounding chicken breast or tights for this recipe, this way you make sure your chicken is cooking evenly\u2026.as result it will make your chicken more tender. \n\n**You can do it in a ziplock bag or use plastic wrap on both sides. If you don\u2019t have a mallet, you can use a skillet instead, and gently pound the meat.** \n\nSeason chicken on all sides with salt, pepper and dry thyme. Now, we are going to brown chicken, I will do it side by side in Instant Pot and Dutch Oven. Turn on Saute mode on Instant Pot and heat plate for the dutch oven, and then add some oil. **Pot should be very hot, when adding the oil**. When oil gets hot, add chicken and brown for about 4-5 minutes on each side. **Also brown the meat long enough on each side before moving around, it will help to avoid getting meat stuck to the pot.** \n\nI have to say that I do like browning on dutch oven a bit more than Instant pot.   \n\nNow, take the chicken out to a separate dish. \n\n**Step#2  Caramelizing onion**  \n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nUsing silicon or wooden spatula, remove all the bits from the bottom of the pot. \n\nNow, start your Instant Pot on Sautee mode. Melt \u00bc stick of butter and then add sliced onions.     \n\nTurn off the Saute function, set Instant Pot to high manual pressure for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes cycle is over, keep it for another 2 minutes and do manual release. Now, turn Instant Pot to Saute mode. Add \u00bd teaspoon of salt and \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar, cook for 10 minutes or until onions get golden brown color, remember to stir in the process.\n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nHit up \u00bc stick of unsalted butter, add sliced onions and cook on low-medium for 25 minutes. Onions should reduce in size. Now raise the heat to medium high, add \u00bd teaspoon of salt, \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar and cook for another 30 minutes or until onions are golden brown color. \n\nCaramelizing onions in Instant Pot is a super convenient feature which allows us to save a significant amount of time. \n\n**Step#3**\n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nLet\u2019s make sure our instant pot is deglazed. Add 1 cup of beef broth, bay leaves, teaspoon of thyme and red wine. Add chicken and cover it up with sauce. Close the lid, turn on Instant Pot on 10 min at high pressure and then wait for natural pressure release. \n\nWhen chicken is ready, take it out from the Instant Pot to the casserole dish, and turn on saute mode. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water and add it to the pot. Also, if you want a more authentic French flavor, add 3 tablespoons of cognac ( or sub cognac for brandy, sherry or white wine ). Seamer on saute mode for 5-10 min or until sauce will thicken. \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nIn dutch oven the process is the same. Layer the same ingredients in the dutch oven. Set heat on medium low and simmer for 30-40 minutes under a closed lid. At the end add some cognac and cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce. \n\nIn this method a lot of liquid got evaporated during the cooking process, so not much time required for sauce thickening. In most cases you don\u2019t even need to add cornstarch. \n\n**Step#4** \n\nCover chicken with sauce in the casserole dish, and then cover it up with shredded cheeses. Send it to the oven on a broil setting for 5 to 10 minutes or until the cheese will brown a bit. \n\nThe final thing left is to taste it. It tasted amazing and we were not able to see the difference in flavor between both cooking methods. \n\nAll in all, Instant Pot is a bit faster, especially for caramelizing onions. It saved me about 15-20 minutes in cooking time. Taste and flavor was equally amazing with both cooking methods. \n\nBon Appetit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vnqugn/french_onion_chicken_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "created_utc": 1656538256.0, "score": 41, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vnqugn/french_onion_chicken_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My Easy One Pot Pancit Bihon (with a vegetarian option)! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "My Pancit bihon recipe is designed to be super easy to make! It might not be completely traditional, but I\u2019ve specifically chosen ingredients that are easy to find in most supermarkets! Filipino food isn't a cuisine I cook often, so if you make your pancit differently to me, let me know in the comments below!\n\nIf you'd like to make this pancit bihon vegetarian, swap the pork for tofu, the oyster sauce for a bit more soy sauce and sugar, and finally, replace the chicken stock with water!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIoeMppeG2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIoeMppeG2A)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Stir Fry**\n\n* 2 small carrots, sliced into strips\n* 300g fine green beans\n* a handful of spring onions\n* 1 savoy cabbage, shredded (or other cabbage)\n* 1 small onion, sliced\n* 3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped\n* 225g (8oz) rice vermicelli noodles\n* 450g (1lb) pork, cubed (or chicken, tofu)\n* a splash of vegetable oil (for frying)\n\n**Sauce**\n\n* 1 tbsp. sugar\n* 2 tbsp. dark soy sauce\n* 1 tbsp. oyster sauce (or more soy sauce and sugar)\n* 2 tbsp. soy sauce\n* 500ml chicken stock (or water)\n* pinch of salt\n* pinch of pepper\n* 1 lime (optional)\n\n\\-----\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Prepare your vegetables! I\u2019m cutting my carrots into thin strips, shredding a savoy cabbage, slicing my onions into rounds and finely chopping 3 cloves of garlic! \n\n2. Chop 450g of your favourite protein into bite sized cubes. For this recipe, I\u2019ve chosen to use pork. Add your protein to a hot wok. The fat from the pork will help to cook the meat, but if you\u2019re using a leaner protein or tofu, you\u2019ll want to add some vegetable oil to the wok.\n\n3. Once your pork (or protein) is cooked through and brown, transfer onto a plate and set aside. To the wok, add a splash of vegetable and your onions. Give them a good toss. Once your onions begin to soften, add your garlic \u2013 and 30 seconds later, add in your pork (or protein!). Add a pinch of salt and pepper to season.\n\n4. Tip in all of your vegetables!\n\n5. Once your vegetables have started to wilt, it\u2019s time to make the sauce! Add to the wok 1 tbsp. sugar, 2 tbsp. dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp. oyster sauce (or more soy sauce and sugar if keeping this vegetarian) and 2 tbsp. soy sauce. Give this a little mix before adding 500ml good quality chicken stock (or water if vegetarian).\n\n6. Now for the bihon! Add 225g rice vermicelli noodles to the wok. Press them down to help them absorb the sauce. Your noodles will begin to soften, which is when you\u2019ll want to push them underneath the vegetables and sauce mixture, allowing them to nestle in all those delicious flavours! The noodles won\u2019t take long to cook, but keep your wok on the heat until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed.\n\n7. Once done, add some chopped spring onions to the mix (the green bits only!) and give it a quick stir!\n\n8. Serve with half a lime (Calamansi is traditional) in each dish, to be squeezed over your pancit bihon \u2013 and enjoy! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis dish was so delicious, I've made it a few times since! I might try adding chicken and shrimp next time! As said, Filipino food isn't a cuisine I cook often, but I made this as part of a collaboration challenge. Let me know how I did! If you make yours different, let me know below! If you have any tips, you know where to add them! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b  \n\n\nDani, Gordon and Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vlszkl/my_easy_one_pot_pancit_bihon_with_a_vegetarian/", "created_utc": 1656328048.0, "score": 56, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vlszkl/my_easy_one_pot_pancit_bihon_with_a_vegetarian/", "html_title": ""}

Heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil on medium heat and once hot, add the diced squash and eggplant. Toss well to coat in oil and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Cook the veggies until they have a light sear and have become soft. To help speed up the process, you can add a splash of water and cover the pan with a lid to let the steam cook the veggies.\n3. Set the veggies aside to serve later.\n4. In the same pan, add 1 tsp olive oil. Once hot, add the chopped onions, garlic and chillies. Saute the onions until they have softened.\n5. Add the coconut milk, fish sauce and vinegar. Mix well and bring to a simmer. Reduce the sauce until it has thickened slightly and season with salt to taste.\n6. Once the sauce has thickened, add spinach and cook until the spinach has wilted.\n7. While the sauce is cooking, prepare the salmon by using a sharp knife and descaling the skin side of the salmon.Then cut 2-3 slits on the skin side, about 1/2 inch deep with a sharp knife.\n8. Heat a non stick pan and once hot add 2 Tbsp of the olive oil. Season the salmon on each side with salt and then add to the pan skin side down.\n9. Cook the salmon skin side down 90% of the time, you can see colour change along the side of the fillet.\n10. When the skin has a light golden brown colour and is crispy and the fish is done cooking about 80-90% all the way, flip the fish carefully and cook the top side of the fish for 30 seconds to a minute. Then flip the fish back on the skin side, turn off the heat and leave the fish on the pan while you finish preparing the rest of the dish.\n11. To serve, add a bed a rice on a plant, top with salmon, skin side up. Scatter the veggies around the plate and then finish with a few spoonfuls of sauce.

Original recipe calls for the whole chicken, but to save time on carving up and since we are starting a swimsuit season I will use boneless and skinless chicken breast. Cut chicken breast to 2\u201d slices. \n\nTurn on Instant Pot on saute mode, add some oil and brown chicken on all sides. Season chicken with salt and pepper. No need to cook it through, just brown for about 5-6 minutes. \n\nTake the chicken out to a separate dish, add a bit more oil to the instant pot and saute onions until soft and translucent. Add some salt in the process. \n\nNow you can add minced garlic, tomato sauce, hot peppers, Adjika sauce which is Georgian style chili paste and Khmeli Suneli which is a Georgian style spice mix. Cook it all for another minute. \n\nYou can find Adjika and Khmeli Suneli spices on Amazon. These spices are very flavorful and you can also use them in most other Georgian dishes\u2026..so it is a good investment. \n\nNow you can add diced canned tomatoes together with liquid from the can. Original recipe calls for fresh skinless chopped tomatoes, but I have decided to cut the corner here.   \n\nNow, we are ready for pressure cooking. Add chicken to the pot. Close the lid, turn on pressure on manual high for 15 minutes and wait for natural pressure release. Total cooking time: 10 minutes to come to pressure + 15 minutes under pressure + 10 minutes natural pressure release, in total 35 minutes. \n\nNow, if you want to make this dish in the dutch oven, the process is identical. You will cook chicken under a closed lead in dutch oven until the chicken reaches 165\u00b0 Fahrenheit.  Cooking this dish in Dutch oven or Instant Pot takes about the same amount of time. \n\nAnd finally add fresh cilantro or parsley to the dish and it is ready to serve.

Arrange the eggs in a pot in a single layer and fill the pan with water (at least 1 inch in depth)\n2. Cover the pot and bring the water up to a boil.\n3. As soon as the water comes up to a boil, start your egg timer, turn off the heat and remove the pan from the heat.\n4. In the meanwhile, prepare an ice water bath by filling a large bowl with water and ice. After 10 minutes, remove the eggs from the pot of hot water and transfer to the iced water bath.\n5. Cool the eggs for at least 5 minutes and then lightly crack the shell with the back of a spoon. To peel the eggs, either peel it under a stream of cold running water, or submerge the eggs in the water bath and start peeling.  \nTo boil eggs in Instant Pot\n6. Place a trivet in the Instant Pot. Carefully arrange the eggs over the trivet, making sure not to overcrowd the pot.\n7. Add 1 Cup of water. If you are making multiple batches of eggs, make sure after each batch, you have at least 1 cup of water remaining in the Instant Pot.\n8.

Then, add the mayonnaise, dijon mustard, vinegar, chopped pickles, cheese, small pinch of salt and pepper.\n13. Whisk well until the deviled egg mixture has a smooth consistency throughout. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper if necessary.\n14. Arrange the egg white halves on a serving platter and using a pair of spoons scoop an egg yolk sized deviled mixture with one spoon, and scoop this portion with another.\n15.

Alternatively you can make your own rub, directions below.\n* Apple juice - 2 cups ( alternatively you can use water ) \n* Liquid smoke - 1 teaspoon\n* Apple cider vinegar - 2 tablespoons\n* BBQ sauce of your choice \n\n**How to make your own rub ( optional )** \n\nMix the following ingredients, you can substitute or adjust spices to your own liking:\n\nBrown sugar - 2 teaspoon \n\nKosher salt - 1 \u00bd   teaspoon\n\nGarlic powder - 1 teaspoon \n\nChili powder - 1 teaspoon\n\nGround mustard - 1 teaspoon \n\nPaprika - 1 teaspoon\n\nGround cumin - \u00bd teaspoon \n\nGround black pepper - \u00bd teaspoon  \n\nCayan pepper - \u00bc teaspoon \n\nOk, let\u2019s go through the simple steps. \n\n**Step #1**\n\nTake the ribs from the fridge and pat them dry with the paper towel. Now, you can make your own rub seasoning ( see list of ingredients above ) or you can use the store bought one. Season the ribs really well on both sides with the rub. Don\u2019t be shy, rub it in with your hands. \n\nPro tip: use disposable food preparation gloves, it will keep the process a lot cleaner. \n\n**Step #2**\n\nPure 2 cups of apple juice ( alternatively you can use water ), 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke inside the instant pot. \n\nAdding apple juice and vinegar makes ribs act like salt making ribs moist and also adds a nice apple flavor. \n\nAdd Instant Pot trivet to the bottom of the pot, it will elevate the ribs so they are not submerged in a liquid while cooking. \n\nSet Instant Pot for 25 minutes at manual high pressure. Let natural pressure release for 10 minutes and then release remaining pressure manually. \n\nNow, brush your favorite BBQ sauce on the ribs. I am using sweet and spicy pineapple sauce from Trader Joes. \n\nPut ribs in the oven on a high broil setting for about 5 minutes. When ready, brush a bit more BBQ sauce on top.    \n\nThis is it, we are done. Quick and simple. Your family and friends will be impressed with these ribs.

{"title": "How To Make Perfect Vegetable Tempura At Home! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "According to my husband, vegetable tempura is the tastiest way to eat vegetables! Tempura is a favourite appetizer in Japanese restaurants, and a dish I used to order on a regular basis, but it's surprisingly cheap and simple to make at home!\n\nI also show you how to make Tentsuyu, a traditional dipping sauce for tempura, which is full of umami! This isn't the healthiest way to eat vegetables, but it's a lovely treat to enjoy from time to time!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my vegetable tempura recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azP5Sf66Pfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azP5Sf66Pfs)\n\n\\-----\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Tempura**140g cornflour / cornstarch60g plain flour (*plus more for dusting!*)160ml sparkling watervegetable oil (*for frying*)vegetables! (*I'm using carrots, eggplant, broccoli, king mushrooms, sweet potatoes, asparagus and potatoes*)\n\n**Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce**250ml dashi60ml (1/4 cup) soy sauce60ml (1/4 cup) mirin rice wine\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with our Tentsuyu dipping sauce! To a sauce pan, add your dashi\\*, mirin rice wine and soy sauce. Gently heat this mixture up to bring all the flavours together and then set it aside for later. \\**I use dashi concentrate. If you have dashi concentrate, follow the instructions to make a 250ml mixture. In my case, it was roughly 1:10 dash to water mix, so I did 25ml dashi and 225ml water. You can also find dashi pre-made, so just use 250ml of the liquid! Alternatively, you can cook shiitake mushrooms in hot water until the water turns a dark brown colour. You can then use 250ml of this water as your dashi substitute!*\n2. Prep your vegetables! I\u2019m using carrots, eggplant, broccoli, king mushrooms, sweet potatoes, asparagus and potatoes. I like to cut my carrots and mushrooms into thin 5mm thick strips, the eggplant and sweet potatoes into thin roundels, and I grate my potatoes with a cheese grater!\n3. Fill a large saut\u00e9 pan with vegetable oil, approximately 1 inch deep, and heat. You\u2019ll want the oil to reach 180C | 360F in temperature. You can also test to ensure the oil is hot enough by dropping some of your tempura batter into the oil. If the batter sizzles and rises to the surface, your oil is ready for cooking!\n4. Now for the tempura batter! In a bowl, add 140g cornflour (or cornstarch) and 60g plain flour. Give it a quick mix, then add 160ml sparkling water and a handful of crushed ice. Keeping your batter cold is very important!\n5. The best method to mix this batter is with 4 chopsticks held together. You then make a \u2018stabbing\u2019 motion up and down to mix the ingredients; do not stir! If you don\u2019t have chopsticks, I\u2019d highly recommend getting some for this step! However if you really cannot find any chopsticks, I\u2019d use the handle end of a wooden spoon \u2026\n6. Once your mixture looks like double cream / heavy cream in consistency, it\u2019s ready! Simply dip your vegetables into a bowl of plain flour, covering them generously, and then place your vegetables into your batter, making sure to cover every surface! Carefully place them into the oil. I like using my chopsticks to \u2018sprinkle\u2019 some additional batter mix onto the cooking vegetables, as this adds some lovely crispy and crunchy bits!\n7. Turn your vegetables every now and again. The batter is quite light in colour, but it should turn to a light golden brown. Once light golden brown, place on a cooling rack with some paper towels beneath, just to allow any excess oil to drip off!\n8. Every now and again, scoop out any excess batter pieces floating in your oil \u2013 and continue cooking your vegetables! I like to dip a large amount of the grated potato into the flour, then the batter, and then I take small handfuls and fry individually as little \u2018nests\u2019!\n9. Reheat your sauce, serve and enjoy! (*If you like your tempura as warm as possible, you can place your finished fried vegetables into an oven at a low temperature, whilst you continue frying the other vegetables!*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, feel free to ask below and I'll try and answer them as soon as possible!

{"title": "3 easy ways to make smoked chicken at home without a smoker.", "selftext": "In the recipe I will be using 3 indoor smoking methods: AirFryer, Stovetop and homemade smoker made out of Dutch Oven. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nChicken breast - 4lb ( total for all 3 methods combined )  \n\nBrine: \n\n1. Kosher salt - 3 tablespoons \n2. Brown sugar - 1 tablespoon \n3. Red chili flakes ( optional ) - 1 teaspoon ( only if you like to add a spicy kick to it )\n\nSeasoning: ( you can use any chicken seasoning or rub of your choice ) \n\n1. Garlic salt ( from Trader Joe\u2019s ) \n2. Adjika ( Georgian seasoning blend from Trader Joe\u2019s )\n3. Lemon pepper seasoning ( from Trader Joe\u2019s )\n4. Avocado or olive oil\n\nWood chips ( for stovetop and dutch oven methods ) - I am using cherry flavor ( you can also use pecan, mesquite or apple wood )\n\nLiquid smoke - \u00bd teaspoon ( for Air fryer method only )\n\nOptional: you can add BBQ sauce after the chicken is ready\n\n**If you are visual learner, I have step by step guide, cooking tips and comparison of cooking methods in this video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du82gomTmP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du82gomTmP0) \n\nFor smoking I prefer to use whole chicken, thighs or chicken breast. For today's recipe I will be using chicken breast. \n\n**Step#1 Brining process**\n\nWe do need to brine chicken before smoking. You can do wet or dry brining. For meat with less fat ( such as chicken breast\u2026which is one of the leanest meats ) use wet brine, this way meat will get juicier in a smoking process. \n\nAlso I recommend skinless chicken for smoking, this way smoke will get inside the meat vs staying in the skin only. \n\nBrining makes cooked meat more moist by hydrating the cells of its muscle tissue before cooking. \n\nFor the simple brine use Kosher salt and brown sugar. You can always add other aromatic spices or liquids. I am adding some chili flakes, but it is optional. You can always get more creative by adding bourbon, wine, lemon juice, garlic cloves, herbs or apples. \n\nAdd 3 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in the warm water and mix well to dissolve. Let water cool down or add some ice to speed it up. Now you can add chicken in the ziplock bag or vacuum sealed bag, cover it with brine and send it to the fridge for at least 3 hours. You can go up to 8 hours, but don\u2019t go longer than 8.  \n\n**Step#2 Seasoning chicken.** \n\nAfter 4 hours in the brine, dry chicken with the paper towel, spray with avocado oil and season it with your favorite spices on both sides. I am using a nice mix of spices from trader Joe\u2019s. \n\n**Method #1 Air Fryer**\n\nFor this method in addition to seasoning I will splash a little bit of liquid smoke. I am using \u00bd teaspoon. Don\u2019t use too much as it is highly concentrated. \n\nNow, put chicken in the Air Fryer at 220\u00b0F. It will be ready when chicken is at 165\u00b0F internal temperature. In the process open the Air Fryer a few times to check internal temperature with the termometr. In my case, it took me about 30 minutes. \n\n**Method #2 Stovetop smoker**\n\nFollow instructions of your Stovetop smoker. I am using the one made by Cameron. \n\nCherry sawdust is always a popular choice for smoked chicken. But, you can also use apple, pecan or maple wood chips or sawdust. \n\nI also recommend using foil to cover the base and dripping tray, which will make it a lot easier to clean up. Set it up on the stove on medium heat. It took me about 30 minutes to get it to 165\u00b0F. \n\nOptionally I like to put an aluminum disposable cup with some water or apple juice on the tray. It will add additional flavor and help to keep the meat moist. \n\n**Method #3 Do it yourself, a smoker made out of Dutch oven and some foil.** \n\nLay 2 pieces of foil inside the Dutch oven with sides sticking out. Sprinkle food chips and cover them up with loose pieces of foil. Now put a tray inside the dutch oven. Lay chicken on the trey, tighten up foil and close the lid. Set the stove to medium heat. It took me about 20-25 minutes. Open up the foil in the process to check the temperature so you don\u2019t overcook the chicken. \n\nNow, let\u2019s taste it. All 3 pieces look about the same. After a very demanding testing process we arrived at consensus that the Stovetop version had the most amount of flavor, maybe that cup of apple juice worked the magic.\n\nHowever Dutch oven and Air Fryer were not far apart, very tasty, moist and full of flavor. \n\nOptionally you can brush chicken with BBQ sauce before serving. \n\nIn summary, all 3 methods worked out quite well, took about the same amount of time and about the same amount of effort and cleanup. \n\n**If you want to know how to smoke fish without a smoker at home, I have link in the description of this video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vcwud1/3_easy_ways_to_make_smoked_chicken_at_home/", "created_utc": 1655306172.0, "score": 5, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vcwud1/3_easy_ways_to_make_smoked_chicken_at_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Salted Honey Pie! \ud83c\udf6f\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": " If you have a sweet tooth, then look no further! Salted honey pie is a buttery pie crust filled with a super smooth caramel custard, comprising of honey, brown sugar and double cream. The honey pie is then garnished with sea salt to finish! This is the perfect pie for summer, as it's served cold out of the fridge!   \n\n\n**If you're a visual learner, be sure to check out our video recipe here:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en0Fk9x-XcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en0Fk9x-XcQ)  \n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**\n\n* a single pie crust (pre-made, roll out or homemade!)\n* 4 egg yolks\n* 600ml (2 1/2 cups) double cream / heavy cream\n* 144g (1 cup) brown sugar\n* 37g (1/3 cup) cornflour\n* 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\n* 120ml (1/2 cup) runny honey\n* 10ml ( 2 tsp.) vanilla extract\n* sea salt to garnish\n\n\\-----  \n**Method**  \n1. Preheat oven to 190C | 375F and line an 8\u201d pie dish with your crust. Chill your pie crust in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. You can use a pre-made pie crust from the store, roll out pie pastry, or make your pie pastry from scratch, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous!  \n\n\n2. To a medium bowl, add 4 egg yolks and give them a quick whisk to combine the egg yolks together.  \n\n\n3. To a saucepan, sieve 37g corn flour (also known as corn starch). I like to sieve the corn flour to prevent any lumps in the custard! Now add 144g brown sugar and 3g salt to the corn flour. Break up any lumps of sugar with a wooden spoon or plastic spatula and give the mixture a quick stir.  \n\n\n4. Add 600ml double cream (also known as heavy cream) to the mixture and turn the heat to medium. You\u2019ll want to stir the mixture constantly, so that it doesn\u2019t burn to the bottom of your pan! As the temperature increases, the mixture will thin out. However it\u2019ll then begin to thicken \u2013 and you\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when you see bubbles forming underneath and on the surface.  \n\n\n5. Now we need to carefully temper our egg yolks! Add a small amount of your warm cream mixture to the yolks whilst whisking. Keep adding small amounts and whisk consistently until you\u2019ve added all of the warm cream mixture. If you add the mixture too fast, you\u2019ll cook the egg yolks, which will result in a scrambled egg custard mess!  \n\n\n6. Once combined, add in 10ml (2 tsp.) vanilla extract and 120ml runny honey. Stir to melt the honey into the mixture.  \n\n\n7. Sieve the mixture into your chilled pie crust. This ensures your custard filling is as smooth as smooth can be!! Carefully carry it to your oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.  \n\n\n8. When the pie comes out of the oven, the filling will still be really jiggly. Don\u2019t worry; it will set! Let the pie cool to room temperature and then chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours.  \n\n\n9.

{"title": "A 107 Year Old Recipe - Gingerbread Cake!!", "selftext": "This beautifully delicate, moist and spicy gingerbread cake recipe was kindly given to me by a family friend! It's a recipe that has been passed down through generations and likely dates back to the Victorian era, over 100 years ago! And it shows, as the original recipe calls for shortening to be used!\n\nThis gingerbread cake packs a punch in terms of flavour, but it's not overly sweet. I've added a dollop of whipped cream to add some sweetness to this dessert, topped with crystallised candied ginger pieces for decoration - and to let everyone know it's definitely a ginger cake!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, check out my recipe video here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KenqSVmfn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KenqSVmfn0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n3 eggs  \n227g butter, melted  \n1 tsp cinnamon  \n1 tsp ground ginger  \n1/2 tsp ground cloves  \n200g sugar  \n240g plain flour  \n236ml water, boiling  \n320g black treacle/molasses  \n2 tsp. baking soda  \n2 tbsp. hot water  \nsugar (to top)  \nwhipped cream and crystalised candied ginger (optional)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**  \n\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F, then grease a 9\u201d x 13\u201d baking with butter and line it with parchment paper.\n2. Into a large bowl, add 3 eggs, 200g sugar, 320g black treacle (or molasses), 227g melted butter, 1 tsp. ground ginger, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. ground cloves. Stir this together until the mixture is nice and smooth.\n3. In a small bowl, add 2 tbsp. hot water to 2 tsp. baking soda. Give this a quick stir to dissolve the baking soda, and then pour the mixture into your wet cake batter.\n4. Sieve 240g plain flour (or all-purpose flour) into the wet ingredients. Sieving is important in this recipe, as it\u2019s a very delicate cake! You don\u2019t want any lumps of flour in your mixture! Stir in the flour to combine.\n5. Add in 236ml of boiling hot water and stir to combine. Your cake mix will look very thin at this stage, but don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be!\n6. Pour the mixture into your pre-prepared pan and bake for around 35-45 minutes.\n7. Once out of the oven, gently press on the centre of your cake. If it springs back, it\u2019s done! Now cover your cake with a generous sprinkling (approx. 50g) of granulated sugar!\n8. Cut into equal sized squares and serve on a plate with whipped cream and chopped crystallized/candied ginger! Alternatively, this gingerbread cake goes great with warm vanilla custard or a cold scoop of vanilla ice cream!  \n\n\nLet me know what you think of this recipe, especially if you give it a go!

How to smoke fish without smoker indoors using 3 easy methods: Air Fryer, Stovetop and Dutch Oven", "selftext": "If you were thinking of making your own smoked fish at home, but don\u2019t have an outdoor smoker or ability to smoke fish outdoors\u2026..don\u2019t look further. I will walk you through 3 simple methods on how to make an amazing smoked fish at the convenience of your own home without need of any specialty smoking equipment. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nSteelhead - 4lb ( you can also use salmon, trout or mackerel )\n\nKosher salt - \u00be of the cup\n\nBrown sugar - \u00be of the cup\n\nGarlic powder - 1 tablespoon ( you can experiment with other spices of your choice )\n\nHoney ( or maple syrup ) - for glazing the fish\n\nWood chips - I am using hickory flavor ( you can also use cherry, maple or apple wood )\n\nLiquid smoke - \u00bd teaspoon ( for Air fryer method only )   \n\n**If you are a visual learner, I do have step by step video guide along with some useful smoking tips:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY) \n\n**Let\u2019s start with brining the fish.** \n\nTake the fish from the fridge. Let\u2019s start by cutting the fish into equal pieces. If you see any bones on the surface, take them out. \n\nMake the brine out of equal proportions of kosher salt and brown sugar. If you like fish that are more salty or more sweet, you can adjust proportions accordingly. Mix in 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. Generously cover the fish with the mixture, close the lid on an air tight container and send it to the fridge for 6-12 hours. I normally do this process the night before. \n\nTake the fish out from the fridge, rinse it well with the cold water, dry it with the paper towel, set it on the rack skin side down and send it to the fridge to dry for about 1 hour. \n\nOk, now the fish are ready for smoking. \n\n**Method #1** Air Fryer: \n\nBefore smoking we need to coat the fish with honey and liquid smoke. \n\nFor this piece of fish use \u00bd teaspoon of liquid smoke, it is highly concentrated, so you don\u2019t need much. \n\nNow, send the fish to the air fryer at 170\u00b0F for at least 1h. It took me 1 hours and 20 minutes for this piece as it is about 2 inch thick. Remember to coat fish again in the middle of the process. When ready, the fish should be at 160F. \n\n**Method #2** Using a stovetop smoker made by Cameron. \n\nGlaze fish with some honey. I like to use sawdust chips, which start to create smoke pretty much right away. I am using hickory flavor, but you can also experiment with cherry, maple or apple wood. \n\nSet the smoker on the stove at medium heat for about 25 minutes. Time will vary based on the size of the fish. \n\n**Method #3** Homemade smoker made out of Dutch oven and some foil\n\nIn this method we will replicate a Cameron stovetop, with dutch oven and a little bit of foil. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have dutch oven, you can also use a deep skillet or a pot.  \n\nTake 2 pieces of foil and lay them inside Dutch Oven with some foil sticking out. Sprinkle sawdust wood chips and cover them up with a piece of foil.  Now put the grilling rack on top. I am using a trivet from my instant pot. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have one available, you can crumble up few pieces of foil and put at the bottom which will elevate the fish inside in a similar way. \n\nNow put glazed fish on top of the rack, fold remaining pieces of the foil very tight, so smoke will not escape and then close the lid of the dutch oven. \n\nSet it on the stove for or 25 minutes or until the fish is 160\u00b0F. Due to the very tight lid and foil, there is almost no smoke going outside the dutch oven, which is a plus when smoking in a less ventilated area.  \n\nAll three versions of the smoked steelhead look and smell amazing. The one from the air fryer looks a bit brighter in color compared to the other 2.  \n\nYou can serve smoked fish hot or cold.  \n\nAs far as a taste, we were not able to see the difference\u2026..all 3 options turned out really good. Personally I didn\u2019t expect that air fryer with liquid smoke version will be on par with traditional stovetop smoking.

These types of potatoes have thick skin, high starch content and are lower in moisture, which makes them perfect to achieve an outside crispines when making french fries. \n\nNow, wash potatoes really well with the brush. Cut them as evenly as possible so they will cook through at the same time. I prefer larger wedges which are about \u00bd inch thick ( aka Steak fries ), but you can adjust it based on your preference. \n\nRinse potatoes with cold water until the water is clear. We need to remove all the starch from the outside, this way potatoes are less likely to stick together. Now soak potatoes in cold water, add some ice and put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. \n\nSoaking potatoes in water before frying is a secret of crispy potatoes. \n\nNow, dry potatoes well with paper or kitchen towel. If you like your potatoes crispy, you want to avoid putting wet fries in an Air Fryer.  \n\nToss potatoes in the bowl with 1 \u00bd tablespoon of oil. I prefer to use Avocado oil. I have about 3 layers of potatoes in the basket. Cook for about 7 to 10 minutes at 375\u00b0F. If you have less potatoes, time needs to be adjusted. Remember to toss potatoes halfway . \n\nNow, take potatoes out, toss them in the bowl, add a bit more oil, salt, pepper and some spices of your choice. I am using paprika, garlic powder and this new pickle seasoning from Trader Joes. it will add a nice kick to the fries. \n\nToss it well and send it to an Air Fryer for another 7 to 10 minutes at 400\u00b0F, toss a few times in the process so everything is cooking evenly. Final product should be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\n**Step#2 Making beer battered fish**\n\nFor fish and chips you can use pretty much any white fish such as cod, halibut, pollock or haddock. \n\nToday I am using frozen cod which is more traditional for this recipe. \n\nTake fish straight from the fridge. Dry it well with the paper towel. \n\nWe need 3 medium size containers to deep the fish in the coatings.  \n\nContainer #1:  1 \u00bd cup of all purpose flour. You can also use rice flour which is supposed to add more crispines. Mix in sugar, salt and pepper. \n\nContainer#2: We will use it to make coating batter. Sift flour and mix it up with 1 egg. Slowly mix in beer to get batter to desired consistency. It needs to be heavy, not too liquidy. And yes, you can drink it too, Cheers! \n\nContainer#3: Mix breadcrumbs with some salt and pepper. This last layer will add some nice crispiness to the fish. \n\nNow coat fish with flour, then beer batter and finish with breadcrumbs. To avoid mess I recommend using a fork to dip fish in the coatings\u2026..I personally forget to do that and create a lot of mess.  Spray fish with the oil on all sides and send it to the air fryer for \\~10min at 375-400\u00b0F ( or until internal temperature is 145\u00b0F )  and gently flip half way. Also remember to spray some oil on the Air Fryer basket. Don't overcrowd the fish and do it in a few batches. \n\nAll done, it is crispy on the outside and nice and flaky on the inside. \n\n**Step#3 final step, making Tartar sauce**  \n\nMix well all the ingredients listed in the description and it is all done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/v65wth/fish_and_chips_in_the_air_fryer_easy_recipe_and/", "created_utc": 1654528739.0, "score": 21, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/v65wth/fish_and_chips_in_the_air_fryer_easy_recipe_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Perfect Scones Every Time! Fit For Royalty!! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "Scones! No matter how you pronounce scones, or whether you prefer jam first or clotted cream first, scones are the cornerstone of every afternoon tea!   \n\n\nScones are so wonderfully British! They're the perfect treat to enjoy on warm summer days, in celebration of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, or just alongside a really good cup of tea!   \n\n\nIf you're a visual learner, check out my scone recipe video here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpZWVtw95fg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpZWVtw95fg)\n\n  \n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 400g '00' flour (also known as pasta flour!)\n* 115g butter, frozen and grated\n* 1 egg\n* 175ml whole milk\n* 80g caster sugar\n* 20g baking powder\n* 1/2 tsp. salt\n\nOptional, but recommended:\n\n* Lots of clotted cream!\n* Lots of jam!! \n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Into a large bowl, sieve 400g \u201800\u2019 flour, 20g baking powder and \u00bd tsp. salt. \u201800\u2019 flour is typically reserved for pasta, but it results in the lightest and fluffiest scones! If you don\u2019t have \u201800\u2019 flour at hand, you can use plain flour, but they won\u2019t be as fluffy.\n\n2. Add 115g of grated butter to your flour mix. I highly recommend freezing your butter overnight, as this makes grating it a lot easier! Using your fingertips, rub the butter and flour together until you have a cohesive sand-like consistency throughout. It\u2019s okay if some butter is still showing within the flour!\n\n3. Add in 80g caster sugar and stir to combine. This is also the time to add in any dried fruits \u2013 if you\u2019d like! I\u2019d recommend up to 50g of your chosen dried fruit. No caster sugar? Superfine sugar works well, or you can use granulated sugar, but give it a few pulses in a food processor first!\n\n4. Add in 175ml of whole milk and gently combine with a wooden spoon. You just want the milk to absorb into the flour to form a soft and shaggy dough. You don\u2019t want to over mix at this point! \n\n5. Now cover your bowl with cling film (saran wrap) and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.\n\n6. Dust your work surface with flour and turn out your dough! Using the heat of your hands, bring the dough together into a roll-able consistency. I like to pat mine into a large flat square, which I then divide into 4 smaller equal squares. Stack the squares of dough on top of each other, squish them down and then gently roll out into a 2cm thick flat square. This technique helps create a nice flaky finish to your scones and is similar to pastry lamination!\n\n7. Use a 5.5 \u2013 6.5cm diameter cutter to cut out your scones. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Unlike most bakes, I recommend placing your scones close together, albeit not touching! Once you\u2019ve cut out your first batch of scones, you\u2019ll want to bring the remaining dough back together into a square shape, cut into 4 equal sized smaller squares, stack, squish and roll out again! Then cut out your second batch of scones.\n\n8. In a small bowl, whisk up one egg and brush this onto the tops of your scones!\n\n9. Let your scones rest for another 30 minutes, uncovered. Preheat your oven to 220C (425F)\n\n10. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden on top! Let them cool, and enjoy!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you pronounce scones? 'S-cone' or 'Sc-on'? Also, jam first or cream first? Tell me in the comments below!

{"title": "How to make the softest and fluffiest homemade brioche burger buns", "selftext": "Does anyone agree with me that we all love hamburgers but it\u2019d be way better with a brioche bun than regular hamburger buns. I\u2019m bringing you the only brioche buns recipe you need today to make the softest, fluffy and buttery brioche burger buns at home. All of these simple ingredients might already have in your pantry so I hope you give a try soon.\n\n[Full recipe and how to make the best brioche buns here:](https://youtu.be/iWOhtIS6Mf4)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 330g bread flour\n* 150g milk (lukewarm)\n* 30g sugar\n* 5g yeast\n* 1 large egg (room temperature)\n* \u00bd tsp salt\n* 70g unsalted butter\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Pour 150g warm milk and crack 1 large egg (room temperature) to a large bowl, add in 30g sugar and 5g yeast. Stir until sugar and yeast are dissolved.\n2. Add in the same bowl 330g bread flour. Roughly mix until all of ingredients are combined. Gently knead the dough for 2-3 mins, then cover and let it rest for 20 minutes.\n3. After 20 minutes, gluten has started to form so it\u2019s easier to knead by now. If you use stand mixer, add the dough and 70g butter (divide to 2-3 times) to knead for 12- 15 minutes or until the dough is elastic and pass windowpane test. If kneading by hands, add in 70g butter and knead until the butter is melted and knead for 12- 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and stretchable.\n4. Form into a smooth round ball, cover and let the dough proof for 1 \u2013 1hour and 20 minutes in room temperature or until double in size.\n5. Deflate and get all of the air bubbles out, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Make the dough into small round balls, put into a large baking tray to proof for another 50 minutes \u2013 1 hour until double in size.\n6. Prepare egg wash: 1 large egg yolk, 1 tbsp milk, brush all of the brioche buns with egg wash. Sprinkle with sesame seeds (optional)\n7. Bake in preheated oven at 375F for 13- 15 minutes or until dark golden brown. Cool the brioche buns in a cooling rack.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you want to use milk and egg straight out of fridge, mix them up and microwave for 40-45 seconds in the microwave to make it lukewarm.\n* Brioche buns have more butter than usual buns, so the kneading time might be a bit longer than usual buns.\n* Brioche hamburger buns can be stored in the freezer for 3 months. You can make it ahead of time, freeze them in Ziploc bags and after defrosting it it\u2019d still be soft and bouncy just as freshly made brioche buns.\n* If you like the brioche buns has darker golden-brown colour, brush with egg wash twice.

A mixture of quality veal, pork mince and beef mince, combined with good sprinkling of parsley, breadcrumbs, and parmesan cheese, results in the most delicious and moist Italian meatballs you've ever had!  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhNkvgpyps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhNkvgpyps)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n800g ground veal  \n800g ground beef  \n400g ground pork  \n4 eggs  \n240g parmesan cheese, grated  \n340g breadcrumbs  \n2 tsp. onion flakes  \n4 tsp. garlic powder  \n2 tsp. salt  \n8 tsp. parsley, finely chopped  \n220ml milk  \nolive oil, for hands/rolling\n\n\\-----  \n\n\n**Method**\n\n1. To a large bowl, add 800g ground veal, 800g ground beef and 400g ground pork. Give this a thorough mix by hand until all the meats are fully combined! \n\n2. Finely chop your parsley and add it to your meat mixture, along with 4 eggs, 2 tsp. onion flakes, 4 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. salt, 240g parmesan cheese (grated), 340g breadcrumbs and 220ml milk. Thoroughly combine these ingredients altogether. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when the mixture is cohesive in colour throughout!\n\n3. I\u2019d recommend cooking a small amount of your mixture in a frying pan, to check to see if it needs any additional seasonings. A great tip is to flatten the meat in the frying pan, so it cooks quicker! Adjust to your taste.\n\n4. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F.\n\n5. Pour some olive oil into a small bowl and dip your fingers into it before you begin rolling your meatballs. Squeeze the mixture tightly in your hands, otherwise you run the risk of your meatball falling apart whilst baking! I usually make my meatballs approx. 2\u201d in diameter \u2013 between a golf ball and a tennis ball!\n\n6. Place on a baking tray and cook for 45 minutes, or until they have a nice golden crust on top.\n\n7. And enjoy!! I like to place my meatballs into a rich, homemade tomato sauce for a minimum of 20-30 minutes to absorb additional flavours, and then I serve with my favourite pasta and a generous grating of parmesan!  \n\n\n**Storage:**\n\n**This recipe makes a lot of meatballs!** Meatballs need to be stored raw; not after cooking. Store your raw meatballs by lining a baking tray with parchment paper, placing the meatballs onto the paper, and then freeze them for 12 hours. Once 12 hours has elapsed, transfer the meatballs into zip lock bag and they will keep for up to 2 months. I\u2019d recommend writing the date you made the meatballs on the side of the bag!\n\n**Cooking from Frozen:**\n\nBake in the oven at 180C | 375F for 45 minutes, then transfer to a tomato sauce and cook for a further 20-30 minutes \u2013 and enjoy!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a firm favourite and has been passed down through generations of my family. Give these Italian meatballs a try and I bet they will become a favourite with your family too!

{"title": "Easy Recipe of Hungarian Goulash in Instant Pot or Dutch Oven.", "selftext": "After making a very traditional Hungarian dish called Chicken Paprikash a few weeks ago, I have received multiple requests to make another even more famous classic Hungarian dish called Goulash.  \n\n**Ingredients: ( as a stew or soup \\~5; in combination with noodles or dumplings 7-8 )** \n\n* Stew beef - 3 lb\n* Onions ( chopped, medium size ) - 2 pcs\n* Bell peppers ( chopped ) - 2pcs\n* Garlic ( minced ) - 5-6 cloves \n* Carrots ( chopped, medium size ) - 2pcs\n* Potatoes ( cut on 1\u201d cubes, medium size ) - 5pcs \n* Avocado or olive oil ( to brown meat and saute vegetables ) - 2 tablespoons \n* Hungarian paprika ( sweet ) - \u00bc cup ( feel free to add even more if you like ) \n* Beef stock - 2 \u00bd - 3 cups ( if you want more soupy texture, add 1 more cup ) \n* Diced tomatoes - 1 can ( 14.5oz )\n* Salt and pepper - season meat and + to taste \n* Flour - 2 tablespoons ( mixed with 1 tablespoon of water ), alternatively use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch \n* Caraway seeds ( optional ) - 1 teaspoon \n* To garnish:  parsley and sour cream\n\nServe with: with fresh bread as a stew or soup, or with noodles, potatoes, or spaetzle  \n\n**If you are visual learner, I have step by step video recipe + cooking tips:**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Kxe3nC0IA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Kxe3nC0IA) \n\n**Step #1** \n\nChop onions, bell peppers and carrots. Mince garlic and cut potatoes on 1 inch cubes. \n\nTurn on Instant Pot to saute mode, add some oil and brown the meat in batches. Season the meat in the process. Cook for about 5 minutes, just to brown, no need to cook it through. \n\nWhen browned, remove the meat from the Instant Pot. \n\nAdd remaining oil to the pan and saute onions and peppers until onions are translucent. Now add garlic and saute for another minute. \n\nAdd a little bit of beef broth and deglaze Instant Pot. Always remember to deglaze after sauteing and before pressure cooking to avoid burn message on your Instant Pot. \n\nNow, turn off your Instant Pot. \n\n**Step #2**\n\nNow you can add remaining ingredients to the pot except flour. I added 2 \u00bd cups of broth, but if you want to make a more soupy texture of this dish add 3 \u00bd or even 4 cups of broth instead. \n\nFor this recipe use original sweet Hungarian paprika which has a nice, rich and sweet red pepper flavor. \n\nPro tip: Never put paprika in a very hot pot, paprika burns very easily and will become bitter. So add it to a cooler pot or to a liquid.   \n\nNow, close the lid, turn on Instant Pot on high pressure for 25 minutes. Allow Instant Pot to release pressure naturally for about 15 minutes, and then release remaining pressure manually.  \n\nTaste to see if you need to add more salt.  \n\nAnd finally, if you want to thicken the sauce, turn on saute mode, add flour or cornstarch mixture and simmer it for about 5-7 minutes or until sauce thickens.   \n\nYou can serve it with fresh bread as a stew or a soup, or with noodles, potatoes, or Hungarian dumplings. \n\nNow, if you don\u2019t have an instant pot and want to make this dish in a dutch oven, the process is almost the same. For the Dutch oven I will need to add more broth, about 5 cups, since during the long simmering process a lot of liquid will evaporate.  Simmer meat in a broth with spices for about 40 minutes and then add potatoes and carrots and simmer for another 40 minutes or until beef is nice and tender.\n\nSo for this recipe using instant pot I was able to save myself about 30-40 minutes in cooking time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/uz62mh/easy_recipe_of_hungarian_goulash_in_instant_pot/", "created_utc": 1653680480.0, "score": 10, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/uz62mh/easy_recipe_of_hungarian_goulash_in_instant_pot/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Leeks have an onion flavor, but much milder. When cooked, it becomes sweeter and gives a buttery flavor. \n\nNow, turn on saute mode in Instant Pot, add olive oil and simmer peppers and leeks until softened ( about 6-7 minutes ) and then add minced garlic and simmer for another minute. \n\nAdd a can of diced tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook for another few minutes. \n\nNow turn off saute mode.\n\nAlways remember to deglaze your instant pot after sauteeing and before pressure cooking. \n\nNow, rinse the rice really well, you need to remove all the starch so the rice doesn't get too sticky. You want to use short grain rice for paella, as it is great to absorb flavor from all the spices in this dish. \n\nNow you can throw the rest of the ingredients in the instant pot. A big plus of this recipe is that in 25 minutes your dish is ready, all ingredients go in almost at the same time. \n\nTypically seafood cooks really fast\n\nSince everything is cooked at the same time, **the key for this recipe** is to use frozen seafood ingredients, this way seafood doesn\u2019t overcook in the pressure cooker\u2026.  Alternatively you can use non frozen ingredients, but it will require cooking seafood in a separate step. I am going for simplicity in this recipe. \n\nSaffron is a key spice which adds a nice flavor to paella, however if you for some reason are out of it, don\u2019t get too upset, replace it with ground turmeric, it will add a nice golden color to the dish. \n\nAfter you put all remaining ingredients in the instant pot, close the lid, select the rice setting ( which is between 10 - 12 minutes ). \n\nSpanish cuisine is not spicy, but personally I like to add some kick to most of my recipes ( so adding red pepper flakes and chile pepper is optional ) \n\nAfter time is up, let it naturally release for 10 minutes and then release remaining pressure and turn off Instant Pot. \n\nYour dish is ready\u2026.it looks and tastes amazing.

{"title": "My Italian Mom's Eggplant Parmigiana! (Eggplant Parmesan!) \ud83c\udf46\ud83e\uddc0", "selftext": "Eggplant parmigiana, also known as eggplant parmesan, is a vegetarian lasagna that's made with thin slices of eggplant (in place of the pasta!), a beautifully rich tomato sauce, and plenty of molten mozzarella and parmesan cheese!  \ud83c\udf46\ud83e\uddc0 \n\nThis is my wife's Mom's recipe, and she shows you how to make this the traditional way by frying the eggplant. However we also mention how to bake them too, in case you want to make this dish a little healthier! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\n\nIf you're a visual learner, her recipe video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuXpyUv7bE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuXpyUv7bE)\n\n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**\n\n500g flour (all purpose or plain)  \n3 medium eggplants (aubergines)  \n20g (3 1/2 tsp.) salt  \n2g (1/4 tsp.) pepper  \n200g parmesan cheese  \n500g mozzarella, grated or cubed  \n1 litre tomato sauce  \nvegetable oil, for frying  \n**This recipe serves 4-6 people!**  \n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Chop your 3 eggplants into 1cm thin slices and lay the cutlets out on a large, clean kitchen towel. Discard the top and bottom pieces of the eggplant. Once your eggplant cutlets are all laid out, sprinkle some salt over them to help draw out the moisture in preparation for dredging. Your eggplant cutlets will brown due to oxidisation; this is fine!\n\n2. To a bowl, add 500g all purpose or plain flour, 20g salt and 2g pepper. Give this a stir to combine. Dredge your eggplant cutlets by placing them into the flour mix, thoroughly covering both sides. Place your flour-covered cutlets onto a baking tray in preparation for frying or baking! Important: Don\u2019t let the cutlets overlap; they\u2019ll stick to each other!\n\n3. Cook your eggplant cutlets ...\n\n**Option 1 - Frying (Traditional):** Fill a large saut\u00e9 pan with vegetable oil - approximately 1 inch deep \u2013 and bring up to temperature. How do you know when the oil is hot enough? Simply sprinkle some flour into the oil and it should \u2018crackle\u2019! That means it\u2019s hot enough to begin cooking your eggplant cutlets! Carefully place your cutlets into the oil away from you to prevent splash back. Once you see browning on the edges, flip the cutlets over. It\u2019ll take a few minutes each side for the eggplant to cook! Once brown on both sides, remove from the oil and place onto a tray lined with kitchen roll. The kitchen roll will help soak up any excess oil.\n\n**Option 2 \u2013 Baking (Healthier):** Bake your eggplant cutlets in the oven at 220C | 425F until they look crispy and golden brown.\n\n4. Let\u2019s assemble! Add a thin layer of tomato sauce to the bottom of your baking dish. Now add a layer of your eggplant slices, making sure they overlap and cover the majority of the sauce. If you need to cut or break some of the slices to make them fit, that\u2019s fine! Push down on the completed layer of eggplants.\n\n5. Add another layer of sauce, but more so than the first layer. Then generously sprinkle with mozzarella and parmesan! Add another layer of eggplant slices, cover with more tomato sauce and then sprinkle on more mozzarella and parmesan.\n\n6. Continue building in this order until you run of out of space \u2013 or ingredients!\n\n7. Cover your baking dish with aluminium foil and bake in a preheated oven for 45 minutes at 180C | 350F. With 10 minutes left on the timer, remove the foil to crisp up that top layer of cheese!\n\n8. Remove from the oven and let your eggplant parmigiana cool for around 10-15 minutes.\n\n9. Serve and enjoy!  \n\n\nIf you have any questions about this recipe, please do feel free to ask below!!

Add \u00bd cup of chicken broth ( or other liquid ) and using a silicon or wooden spatula scrape everything from the bottom. This step will help to avoid the burn message on the Instant Pot. \n\nNow, you can turn off saute mode. \n\n**Step #2**\n\nAdd paprika. Make sure to use fresh high quality paprika since it is the main ingredient of this dish. Ideally try to find sweet Hungarian paprika which has a nice rich sweet pepper flavor. It is not traditional, but I like to make this dish a bit spicy by adding some hot and smoked paprika and even some red pepper flakes ( but this is optional ). \n\nNow, add chicken broth and place chicken back into the pot. Close the lid and set Instant Pot to 15 minutes on high pressure.

It is a very easy recipe which I will make in Instant Pot and Dutch oven side by side to compare simplicity of cooking, taste and preparation time.\n\nIt is a great dinner or a party dish.\n\n**Ingredients: ( 6-7 servings )**\n\nWhite beans - 2 cans ( 15.5oz each ). I am using Great Northern beans from Trader Joe\u2019s. Drained and rinsed.\n\nChicken thighs ( bone-in & skin-on ) - 6pcs\n\nYellow onion ( medium ) - 2pcs ( finely chopped )\n\nItalian Sausage ( uncooked ) - 5pcs\n\nBacon - 8oz (225g) cut into 1 inch pieces.\n\nTomato paste - 3 tablespoons\n\nGarlic - 8-9 cloves ( minced )\n\nCarrots ( medium size ) - 3pcs ( chopped 1 inch pieces )\n\nFresh thyme - 2 sprigs\n\nBay leaves - 3pcs\n\nSalt & Pepper - to taste and seasoning chicken\n\nAvocado or Olive oil - 2 tablespoons ( for frying )\n\nChicken broth - 3 \u00bd cups\n\nBreadcrumbs - 1 \u00bd cup\n\nWhite wine - \u00bc cup ( or red wine )\n\nFor decoration: parsley\n\nYou can serve it with french baguette and green salad\n\n**if you are visual learner, check out step by step and comparison:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-twxTj6YmY**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-twxTj6YmY)\n\n**Step #1**\n\nLet\u2019s start by cutting carrots, chopping onions and mincing garlic. Now, cut bacon into 1 inch pieces.\n\n**Let\u2019s start with Instant Pot:**\n\nTurn on Saute mode, and fry bacon for 5-6 minutes, remember to stir in the process. Cook until crispy.\n\nPro Tip: alway put bacon on the cold pan and cook on medium low, this way bacon will crisp evenly and not burn.\n\nWhen bacon is ready, take it out with a slotted spoon. Leave all the bacon grease inside the pan, we will use it to cook other ingredients.\n\nNow, season chicken with salt and pepper and fry starting with skin side down on Saute mode until golden brown on both sides\u2026.you don\u2019t need to cook chicken through. Don't overcrowd and cook it in several batches. Then take out the chicken and sear italian sausage until golden brown on all sides. Before cooking sausage, make a few cuts with a knife to prevent it from bursting when frying. When seared on all sides, take it out from the pan.\n\nKeep Saute mode on, add some oil and cook onions and carrots. After the onions are translucent, add garlic, cook for 1 minute, then add tomato paste and cook for another minute. Turn off Saute mode.\n\n**Dutch Oven:**\n\nWith dutch oven the process is identical.\n\nOverall for the frying, my preference goes to dutch oven. Instant Pot does the job, but Dutch Oven makes skin crispier and nothing sticks in the process. Let\u2019s see if it will make any impact on the taste of the dish.\n\n**Step #2**\n\n**Instant Pot:**\n\nNow, put all the ingredients in the instant pot except breadcrumbs. Pro Tip: I recommend draining and rinsing canned beans to reduce the amount of sodium and starch. Close the lid and set the pressure cooker for 20 minutes on manual high pressure and wait for natural pressure release.\n\nI added sauvignon blanc but you can also substitute it with white or red wine of your choice. As Julia sad:\n\n\u201cI enjoy cooking with wine. Sometimes, I even put it in the food.\u201d Julia Child\n\n**Dutch Oven:**\n\nProcess is the same. Add all ingredients in the dutch oven except bread crumbs and bring it to a simmer. Now, lower the temperature, cover with the lid and simmer for another 25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through to 165\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nSo overall cooking this dish in Instant Pot and Dutch Oven takes about the same amount of time. Advantage of Instant Pot is that you can turn it on and leave the house. Please, never do it with the oven.\n\n**Instant Pot: 10min to come to pressure + 20 min cooking time + 10 min natural pressure release = 40min**\n\n**Dutch Oven: 10 min bring to seamer + 25min cooking time = 35min**\n\n**Step#3**\n\nNow the final step.\n\n**Instant Pot:**\n\nRemove thyme sprigs. Move the cassoulet to the casserole dish. Mix store bought breadcrumbs with some parsley and a little bit of oil and sprinkle evenly on top of the casserole. Turn on the oven to broiler setting ( 450\u00b0F) and bake for 5-10 minutes or until the top browns and looks crispy. Be careful not to overdo it.\n\nBy the way, if you want to make your own breadcrumbs, it is very simple:\n\n\\-Grind down bread in the food processor to desired size\n\n\\-Bake breadcrumbs on the baking sheet for about 7-8 min at 325\u00b0F\n\n\\-Stir in the process until toasted and dry\n\n**Dutch Oven:**\n\nWith dutch oven the process is identical, except you don\u2019t need to move the dish to another vessel, broil directly in the dutch oven. So with Dutch Oven one less dish to clean!\n\n**Tasing:**\n\nDuring blind testing process I had multiple family members to taste both options. Everyone was impressed with the art of french cooking, the amazing flavor and taste of this dish. However both Instant Pot and Dutch oven versions of this dish were equally good.\n\nConclusion: for this particular recipe both cooking methods are great, and take the same amount of time. Use the one you personally prefer.\n\nYou can serve this dish with french baguette and green salad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/uost81/easy_cassoulet_in_dutch_oven_vs_instant_pot_side/", "created_utc": 1652451579.0, "score": 42, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/uost81/easy_cassoulet_in_dutch_oven_vs_instant_pot_side/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Thoroughly butter an 8\u201d baking tin (including sides!) and line with parchment paper. Preheat your oven to 170C / 325F.\n2. To a small saucepan, add about an inch of water and bring it to a simmer. Place a heatproof bowl on top, ensuring it doesn\u2019t touch the water! Add your 85g chopped dark chocolate and 85g butter. Let the butter and chocolate melt together, giving it a stir every now and again to help speed up the process!\n3. Once fully melted and smooth, remove the bowl from the heat and pour in 198g granulated sugar and \u00bd tsp. salt. Stir together. The heat of the mixture will melt the sugar; this makes the brownies super fudgy! Set aside.\n4. To a separate bowl, sieve together 12g cocoa powder, 56g cornstarch/cornflour and \u00bc tsp. baking powder. Use a whisk to help sieve the ingredients, and then mix the dry ingredients together.\n5. Back to our chocolate/butter mix! Pour in 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and two large eggs, one at a time.

{"title": "Simplified recipe of French Onion Soup inspired by Julia Child. I have made this soup in Instant Pot and Dutch Oven to compare results.", "selftext": "As you know I am a big fan of simple and fast cooking, using modern appliances such as Instant Pot and Airfryer. So today I will try to make this amazing French Onion Soup using Instant Pot and compare it to a more traditional method of cooking this soup in the Dutch Oven. I am very curious to see which option is better, testier and easier. \n\nI will also slightly modify an original recipe to simplify it a bit without sacrificing the taste. \n\nIf you are visual learner, I have step by step video and comparison: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDvMClHMXHM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDvMClHMXHM) \n\n**Ingredients: ( 5-6 servings )** \n\n* Yellow and red onions ( mix ) - 5 cups \n* Butter unsalted ( separated ) - \u00bd stick ( 4 tablespoons ). \n* Salt and Pepper - to taste \n* Brown sugar - \u00bd teaspoon \n* Flour ( all purpose ) - 2 tablespoons \n* Beef stock - 5 cups \n* Wine ( red or white ) - \u00bc cup ( use the wine you are actually like ) \n* Cognac - 3 tablespoons ( optional )\n* Bay leaf - 2pcs\n* Thyme - \u00bd teaspoon \n* French bread - \u00bd loaf ( alternatively use croutons or parmesan crisps )\n* Avocado or olive oil ( to brush french bread ) - 2 tablespoons \n* Swiss Gruyere cheese ( grated ) - 1 cup \n* Parmesan cheese ( grated ) - 2 cups \n\nFor serving: green scallions. \n\n**Step#1 Caramelizing onions** \n\nStart by cutting your onions. I have quite a few onions to cut, so let\u2019s make sure we are using the right strategy to minimize onion tears\n\n1. Cut onions outside - if such option is available \n2. Chill your onions in the fridge or under cold water before cutting  \n3. Make sure you have a very sharp knife\n4. Wear goggles  \n\nI am slicing onions parallel to the root. \n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nNow, start your Instant Pot on Sautee mode. Melt \u00bc stick of butter and then add sliced onions.     \n\nTurn off the Saute function, set Instant Pot to high manual pressure for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes cycle is over, keep it for another 2 minutes and do manual release. Now, turn Instant Pot to Saute mode. Add \u00bd teaspoon of salt and \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar, cook for 10 minutes or until onions get golden brown color, remember to stir in the process. \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nHit up \u00bc stick of unsalted butter, add sliced onions and cook on low-medium for 25 minutes. Onions should reduce in size. Now raise the heat to medium high, add \u00bd teaspoon of salt, \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar and cook for another 30 minutes or until onions are golden brown color. \n\nCaramelizing onions in Instant Pot is a super convenient feature which allows us to save a significant amount of time.  \n\n**Instant Pot:** 6 min to come to pressure + 4 min ( 2+2 ) under pressure + 10 min to get golden brown = 20min\n\n**Dutch Oven:** 25 min on low medium + 30 min on medium-high = 55min \n\n**Step#2 Soup preparation** \n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nLeave the instant pot on Saute mode and stir in 2 tablespoons of flour and \u00bc stick of butter, cook it for 3 minutes, stir it well in the process.  It will give soup a nice texture. Then add beef stock, red wine, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper to taste. Seal the lid, set Instant Pot for 8 minutes at manual high pressure and do a quick release at the end. When the dish is ready add 3 tablespoons of cognac to bring more flavor.\n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nProcess is pretty much the same. \n\nFollow the same process of adding flour and butter and cook for 3 minutes. Then add beef stock, red wine, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper to taste, bring it to simmer on medium high. Then simmer under the lid for another 30 minutes on a low heat. When the dish is ready add 3 tablespoons of cognac.   \n\nSoup cooking time is also quite a bit faster in Instant Pot. \n\n**Instant Pot:** 10 min to come to pressure + 8 min cook time under pressure = 18min\n\n**Dutch Oven:** 30 min\n\n**Step #3 Serving**\n\nNormally you serve onion soup with french bread. Slice bread, put on the baking sheet, brush with some oil and bake at 350\u00b0F for 10 min on each side. Unfortunately I forgot to buy one, so I am using store bought parmesan crisp as a nice substitute, alternatively you can also use croutons. \n\nSo for serving, add some grated Swiss Gruyere cheese in the serving bowl, put a few parmesan crisps and cover it up with grated parmesan cheese. Make sure your serving bowls are oven safe. Bake it in the oven on the metal tray on a broil setting 450\u00b0F for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese melts and turns slightly brown. \n\nYou can serve it with chopped green scallions on top.  \n\nI am doing blind testing, after very demanding testing :) The conclusion was that soup is amazing, but the results of both cooking methods taste the same.\n\nSo for this recipe, my preference goes to Instant Pot, because it saves me about 30-35 minutes in cooking time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ultw1l/simplified_recipe_of_french_onion_soup_inspired/", "created_utc": 1652110380.0, "score": 8, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ultw1l/simplified_recipe_of_french_onion_soup_inspired/", "html_title": ""}

Chop onions, peel and cut carrots into 1 inch pieces. Mince garlic. Now, peel pearl onions. I am a big fan of pearl onions, so I am using quite a bit more as the recipe requires. As Julia once said  \u201c it is hard to imagine civilization without onions \u201c\n\nCut mushrooms. Get the bacon ready. We need to pre-cut bacon into \u00bd inch slices. As you can see, everything is fair, I am using the same amount of ingredients for both Instant Pot and Dutch oven methods. \n\n**Step#2**  \n\n**Let's get Instant Pot ready**. Put bacon in a cold Instant Pot Pan and Start Instant Pot on Saut\u00e9 mode. **Pro Tip:** Always put bacon on the cold pan, it will allow fat to slowly melt and not burn.  \n\nCook bacon until crispy, remember to stir in the process. When bacon is crispy, take it out from the pan using a slotted spoon. Leave the bacon fat inside, we will use it to cook chicken and vegetables. \n\nNow, season the chicken with salt and pepper and cook until brown on both sides. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pot, do it in 2 batches. When ready, remove chicken to the plate. \n\n**For dutch oven**, I will follow the same process of cooking bacon and browning chicken on both sides. I do like the searing in a dutch oven better than instant pot. It is a bit faster and the skin looks crispier. \n\n**Step#3**\n\n**Instant Pot:**\n\nNow, add chopped onions and carrots to the pan and cook until the onion is translucent. Cook for about 6-7 minutes, then add garlic and mushrooms and cook for 2 more minutes. Now, add tomato paste and cook for another minute.  \n\nNow we can add pearl onions, thyme bundles and cover with wine, brandy and chicken stock. I am using my favorite French wine, but you can use any red wine of your choice. \n\nAnd finally, layer the chicken inside the instant pot, close the lid, set on high manual pressure for 8 minutes and wait for natural release. \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nIn the meanwhile I am following almost the same process with Dutch Oven. Except I have decided to cook mushrooms on a separate skillet with oil and then added pearl onions to cook them as well. Since I am not cooking under pressure, I wanted to make sure pearl onions and mushrooms would cook through. \n\nThen I followed the same process of cooking onion, carrots, garlic and tomato paste in the dutch oven. Cover it up with wine, brandy, and chicken stock. Layered the chicken on top along with the thyme bundle and let it simmer on medium low for 30 minutes. 30 minutes is enough to cook the chicken through, but if you want it to fall off the bone, you can simmer it for up to 1 hour on low heat. \n\nAll in all cooking this dish in the Instant Pot vs Dutch Oven takes about the same time. Instant Pot is a bit easier, as I cook everything in the same pot at once. If I were to slow cook lamb or beef, instant Pot would be a much faster alternative, but for chicken it takes about the same time.  \n\nInstant Pot: 10 min to pressurize + 8 min cook time + 15 min to depressurize\n\nDutch Oven: 30 min simmering on medium low.  \n\n**Step#4**\n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nWait for natural pressure release. Remove chicken and vegetables to the serving platter. Sauce looks a bit watery. Now we need to make it look like a gravy by adding Beurre Manie which is a combination of \u00bc stick of melted butter with 2 tablespoons of flour. Mix it well with the sauce, add bacon and set Instant Pot to Saute mode. In about 7 minutes, your sauce will thicken to desired texture. Remember to add salt and pepper if needed. Then add chicken back in and it is ready.  \n\nAlternatively you can sprinkle bacon on top of your final dish instead. \n\nDon't be afraid of butter. Julia famously said, \u201c**With enough butter, anything is good**.\u201d \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nAfter 30 minutes of simmering, take out chicken, add the butter mix, mushrooms, onions and  bacon.  \n\nSimmer for about 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Add chicken back in and it is ready. \n\nAnd finally, tasting. I did a blind tasting. We felt that texture and flavor are very similar in both plates.  Instant Pot was a bit less salty. After fixing the salt issue we settled that both versions taste very similar. Onions and mushrooms looked slightly better in dutch version since I cooked them separately. \n\nOverall Coq Au Van turned out really good. So all in all use either method\u2026\u2026they both good and take about the same time for this particular recipe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ui90wz/coq_au_vin_recipe_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "created_utc": 1651677677.0, "score": 71, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ui90wz/coq_au_vin_recipe_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "html_title": ""}

Combine all the ingredients and using a stand mixer knead the dough. It could take up to 10min. Kneading with hands will take a lot longer. Knead the dough until it gets smooth and doesn't stick to your hands. You might need to add a bit more flour in the process. Now, transfer the dough into a greased bowl, cover with a towel and let it rest in the warm place for about 1 hour.\n\n**Step#2**\n\nDough is doubled in size. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, shape them in a smooth ball and put on the floured board to rest for another 20 minutes, cover it with the towel. Now we can start making our Langos. Flatten the dough into a circle shape about 6\u201d diameter with your hands. Stretch dough so the center is thinner than the edges. Make a few slits in the middle of the circle, this way bread will not bubble in the center, so you will achieve more consistent frying across the entire surface.\n\n**Step#3**\n\nHeat up the skillet with avocado or canola oil on medium high. Normally you need to deep fry langos, but I will use less oil just enough to cover the surface. Fry the Langos for 2 minutes or until golden on each side.  \nCombine minced garlic with melted butter. Brush Langos with garlic infused butter, sprinkle some salt and now get creative with toppings. For mine, I am using sourcream and dill.  \nNow, let\u2019s do an experiment, and try making Langos in the AirFryer. After playing with temperature and timing I got the best results in 8 minutes frying at 330\u00b0F. I had to flip it half way through.  \nNow, in my opinion the Air Fryer version doesn't look as presentable, bubbly and puffy as the original classic version, it is a bit more dense inside. But it still has an amazing taste, so I would consider it as a much healthier alternative to deep fried langos.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ueo4rj/homemade_langos_in_skillet_vs_air_fryer_l\u00e1ngos/", "created_utc": 1651245289.0, "score": 63, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ueo4rj/homemade_langos_in_skillet_vs_air_fryer_l\u00e1ngos/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Korean style sweet and sour beef Short Ribs in the Instant Pot vs Dutch Oven easy recipe.", "selftext": "In this recipe I will make ribs side by side in Instant Pot and Dutch Oven....just to compare results. \n\nIf you are visual learner, I have detailed step by step video instructions: [https://youtu.be/AIEGE8MJeH4](https://youtu.be/AIEGE8MJeH4) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients: ( serving 8 )** \n\nList of ingredients and qty below is total for both Instant Pot and Dutch Oven. \n\nBeef chuck short ribs ( bone-in, 12pcs total ) - 6lb \n\nGinger ( cut and minced, divided in half ) - 4 tablespoons ( you can use fresh or dry )\n\nGarlic - 7 cloves\n\nScallions ( chopped, divided on white and green ) - 1 bunch\n\nKorean radish ( cut in small cubes ) - 1 \u00bd cup ( if you can\u2019t find it in your local market, use traditional radish instead, but it will not give it the proper flavor )\n\nApple ( peeled, cored and cut ) - 2pcs ( 1 \u00bd cup )\n\nBosc pear  ( peeled, cored and cut ) - 2pcs ( 1 \u00bd cup )\n\nSesame oil - 2 \u00bd tablespoons\n\nSoy sauce - 1  cup \n\nApple juice -  \u00be cup\n\nKosher salt ( to season the ribs ) - 2 tablespoons \n\nBlack pepper ( to season the ribs ) - 1 tablespoon \n\nAvocado oil ( for frying the ribs ) - 3 tablespoons \n\nFor decoration: sesame seeds and green onion. \n\nServe with mashed potatoes. \n\nLet\u2019s cook. This recipe is very easy and I will break everything into simple step by step instructions. \n\n**Step#1**\n\nPeel, core and cut apples and pears. Peel and cut korean radish in small cubes. Peel garlic.\n\nChop scallions and separate it into whites and greens. Peel ginger, separate in half, cut one part in small cubes and mince the remaining part using a grinder. \n\nNow using a food processor or blender we can make the sauce. Since we have quite a few ingredients, we might need to do it in two batches. \n\nAdd apples, radish, pears, garlic, white scallions and ginger cubes into the blender. Now add sesame oil, soy sauce and apple juice. Blend everything very well on high to the smooth texture. \n\n**Step#2**\n\nGenerously season the ribs on all sides with kosher salt and pepper. \n\nNow we need to give a good sear to our ribs, caramelize it to a nice brown color. I will start with Instant Pot. Turn Saute mode on Instant Pot, add some oil and when hot add ribs. We need to give ribs a really good sear on all sides. Don\u2019t overcrowd meat, I normally do it in a few batches. \n\nI will follow the same process in the Dutch Oven. On a medium high add ribs to a hot oil and sear on each side. \n\n**Comparison #1** \n\nSearing in a dutch oven is a lot better than Instant Pot. Look at a nice caramelized color from Dutch Oven.    \n\n**Step#3**\n\nNow put meat into the Instant Pot, cover it well with the sauce, and set Instant Pot to manual high pressure for 50 minutes. We will wait for natural release.  So in total time 15min to come to pressure, 50min cook time and 20 min to depresurase, total 1 hour and 30 minutes. \n\nIn the meanwhile we will set up our dutch oven.  Follow the same process by covering meat with the sauce, close the lid and put ribs in the oven for 3 - 4  hours at 290\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Check meat in the process, it is ready when meat is soft and flaking apart. \n\n**Comparison #2** \n\nNothing new, but cooking under pressure in the Instant pot is quite a bit faster then Dutch Oven. 1.5 hours vs 3-4 hours depending on the oven type. \n\n**Step#4**\n\nOpen up Instant Pot when pressure is fully released. Now we can take the ribs out\u2026.meat looks very soft and falls off the bone. As you can see the sauce is quite liquidy, to make it thicker we want to set Instant Pot to Saute mode again for about 15 minutes. Add remaining ginger to the pot and stir it well. While simmering a lot of liquid will evaporate and the sauce will get to desired texture.  \n\nNow, since slow cooking ribs produce a lot of fat, we can reduce sauce fat consistency by getting it through a fat separator.  Alternatively you pour  sauce in the bowl, let it cool down and use the spoon to take out the fat which will float to the top. \n\nI would follow the same process with Dutch Oven. Take the ribs from the oven. They look amazing, and the meat is very soft. Put dutch oven on the stove on low heat, stear in remaining ginger and let it simmer on low heat for another 5-10min. Adding ginger at the end adds a nice flavor to the final product. Sauce from the dutch oven has a much thicker structure compared to Instant Pot so technically you don't need to thicken it. \n\n**Comparison #3** \n\nDue to the longer cooking process in the dutch oven, sauce in the dutch oven has the right consistency already so you don\u2019t need to thicken it. \n\nI like to serve ribs on the bone, it just looks more presentable. It also goes really well with mashed potatoes. Pure some sauce on top, sprinkle green scallions and sesame seeds. \n\nAnd finally conclusion on the taste. Collectively all my guests like the Dutch oven version as it has a bit more flavor. I am not sure if it is related to the presentation of the dish, longer cooking time or better searing. But honestly, the Instant Pot version is not too far apart from dutch oven. \n\nIf I don't have enough time for cooking, the Instant Pot option would be my preference as it is also really really good.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ud5rhz/korean_style_sweet_and_sour_beef_short_ribs_in/", "created_utc": 1651072076.0, "score": 50, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ud5rhz/korean_style_sweet_and_sour_beef_short_ribs_in/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "No Bake Keto Cheesecake", "selftext": "We offer you the opportunity to eat cheesecake without breaking your keto diet, who cannot give up cheesecake these days, where keto nutrition is gaining more and more importance. Here is the No Bake Keto Cheesecake.\n\n[FULL RECIPE WITH IMAGES](https://besthomemade.recipes/no-bake-keto-cheesecake/)\n\nFirst of all, the ketogenic diet; A diet low in carbohydrates and high in fat. It is effective in weight loss as well as showing positive effects on health. While providing all these, we will also make the cheesecake without baking, yes, you read it right, without baking. If you're one of those who say they don't have time, let's do it quickly, you don't want to waste time with the cooking time, then you are in the right place. Let's move on to the recipe for a healthy, fast and three-colored aesthetic cheesecake.\n\n### Ingredients\n\n**Cake** \n\n* 200 g almond flour \n* 35 g raw cocoa \n* 65 g powdered erythritol \n* 75 g butter\n\n**Cream** \n\n* 12 g powder gelatin \n* 50 ml hot water \n* 200 g heavy cream \n* 300 g cream cheese \n* 80 g erythritol \n* 50 g home yogurt (optional) \n* 1 tsp lemon juice (optional) \n* 1 unsweetened vanilla (optional)\n\n### Instructions\n\n* Mix 200 g almond flour, 5 g raw cocoa, 65 g powdered erythritol in a mixing bowl. Almond flour is a must-have in keto cuisine for so many reasons: it has serious health benefits, it's a good source of vitamin E. Therefore, never give up almond flour in your recipes.\n* Then melt the butter and pour it over it. Knead with a spoon and then with your hands until it forms a dough.\n* If you can't get a consistency like in the photo, you can use more butter.  \nTip: When the base becomes doughy, taste it, if you want it to be sweeter, you can add a little more powdered erythritol.\n* Pour the base cake you made into the cheesecake mold and spread it well with the help of a spoon. Keep it in the refrigerator.\n* Let's prepare the cream while waiting in the refrigerator. First, let's leave the powder gelatin in warm water to dissolve.\n* Now let's move on to making the cream. Mix the cream cheese with the erythritol. Let's make sure it's smooth. Let's add home yogurt on it. After adding the lemon juice and unsweetened vanilla, let's mix it well.\n* Let's whip the cream with a mixer in another bowl, the cream will swell a little because it is whipped, which is our aim.\n* Add the cream cheese mixture we prepared before to the cream.  \nTip: Do not use a mixer while mixing these two mixtures, if you use them, the volume will decrease. The fluffy cream that we got earlier will disappear. Therefore, it is useful to mix it gently with a spatula.\n* Add the melted gelatin to the cream.  \nTip: When you add this gelatin, the cream will get the consistency of pastry cream. Since it will be difficult to pour it into the cheesecake mold in this way, we will warm it up soon.\n* You can also make cheesecake in one color if you wish. But because I wanted to make a three-color cheesecake, I mixed the cream and cocoa in different proportions in two different bowls. As a result, I got white cream, low cocoa cream and cocoa cream.\n* Divide our white cream, which has become the pastry cream we prepared before, into three. We add the cocoa mortars we have prepared and heat them on the stove, they will melt immediately. When we complete this step, we will have liquid creams in three different shades in three different pans.\n* Our base cake, which we kept in the refrigerator to freeze, froze while we were making these preparations. Now pour these fluid creams into the mold in the order and in any way you wish.\n* Now that we've followed every step required for the cheesecake, we can leave it in the fridge for three or four hours. When the waiting time is over, you can take it out of the mold and serve.

We will start the recipe by first preparing the bottom layer. Get a bowl and a medium banana right away. We will not use any sugar for the cheesecake so we will meet the need for sugar naturally. For this reason, mash the banana with the help of a fork. Add peanut butter, cocoa, and oatmeal to the mashed banana.\n* Mix well so that the mixture is evenly distributed. Thanks to the ingredients you add, it will become like a dough. You can take it in your hand and give it a little more shape and leave it to wait on the side.\n* Now it's time for the cream that we will spread on the banana dough. Take a new bowl and add mild cream cheese, honey and peanut butter for the middle layer. Mix well until the mixture becomes creamy. After the ingredients are homogenized, take the banana layer and add the cream on it. The reason we prefer honey here is to add natural sweeteners instead of using sugar. Honey is the most ideal consistency and delicious of these natural sweeteners.\n* One last step for service! Pour melted dark chocolate and peanut butter on it. If you want, you can add nice appearance by creating shapes on the cheesecake.\n* By the way, one advice from us, don't forget to brew coffee. Filter coffee will go very well with this Flour & Sugar Free, Low-Fat Cheesecake.

Preheat oven to 180C / 350F. Into a bowl, add 488g flour, 2 tsp. baking soda and \u00be tsp. salt and give it a quick mix to combine the ingredients.   \n\n\n2. To a mixing bowl, 225g unsalted butter (softened), 362g granulated sugar and the zest of 1 lemon. Set your lemon aside for later! Cream together your butter and sugar until it\u2019s smooth and fluffy. Be sure to scrape down the sides (if using a mixer) to ensure everything is fully incorporated!  \n\n\n3. Mix in 2 eggs, one at a time, and 1 tsp. lemon extract. Mix until a cake-like batter is formed.  \n\n\n4. Drain any excess water from your soft ricotta cheese. It\u2019s okay if some liquid remains, but try to remove as much of the liquid as you can! Add your 425g soft whole milk ricotta cheese to your butter and sugar mix and stir until it just comes together.  \n\n\n5. Add your dry ingredients to your batter mixture. Fold by hand to bring all the ingredients together. However try not to over mix at this point; over mixing will result in a less delicate cookie!  \n\n\n6. Use a cookie scoop (or two spoons) to portion out your cookies onto a baking tray. Bake for 9 \u2013 12 minutes. Once the cookies have a light golden colour around the edges, they\u2019re done!  \n\n\n7. Once out of the oven, let them cool on the baking tray for 2-3 minutes, before moving them to a cooling rack.  \n\n\n8. Let\u2019s make our lemon icing!! To a bowl, sieve 230g icing sugar and add the juice of 1 lemon (the lemon you used earlier!), as well as 3 tbsp. melted butter. Whisk together until this makes a lovely icing! If the icing is too thick, add some water. You want the ribbon off the whisk to disappear almost instantly when it drips back into the bowl of icing!  \n\n\n9. Now dip the tops of your cookies into the icing, swirl around to ensure the top is fully covered, and then set aside to allow the icing to firm up. The icing doesn\u2019t harden fully due to the butter. This is also the perfect time to add any sprinkles or other decoration!  \n\n\n10.

{"title": "Keto Chocolate Eclairs", "selftext": "You may have eaten eclairs in different flavors before. But we don't think you've ever eaten like this. Because these eclairs are a great dessert option for those on a ketogenic diet. Here it is with all the details; Keto Chocolate Eclairs!\n\n[Full Recipe with Images](https://besthomemade.recipes/keto-chocolate-eclairs/)\n\nThe ketogenic diet is a diet that aims to meet as little of the daily calorie requirement as possible from sugar and carbohydrates, and the majority of fats, in order to enable the body to produce and burn ketones instead of glucose.\u00a0\n\nIn the ketogenic diet, which is one of today's popular diets, the most difficult stage for those who apply it is desserts. But that doesn't mean it's not possible to make ketogenic desserts. Let's take a look at our practical recipe that will cheer the palate.\n\nThis recipe greets you with the lightness of almond flour and the legendary cream of eclairs. With its fluffy dough, legendary cream and frozen chocolate coating, every bite you take will take you to a completely different world. What are you waiting for to try! Check out the recipe and share your comments with us!\n\n### Ingredients\n\n**For the dough:** \n\n* 45 g water \n* 45 g cream \n* 35 g butter \n* 70 g almond flour \n* \u00bd tbsp xanthan gum \n* 2 eggs\n\n**For the cream:** \n\n* 2 egg yolks \n* 80 g sweetener (erythritol) \n* 1 pinch salt \n* 240 ml cream \n* 25 g butter \n* 1 tsp xanthan gum sugar free vanilla (optional)\n\n**For the chocolate sauce:** \n\n* 60 g dark chocolate (over 80% cacao) \n* 80 g butter erythritol\n\n### Instructions\n\n**Start by preparing the dough:1**\n\n* We start by adding water and cream to the butter and melting it. When all the ingredients are melted, we add the almond flour and xanthan gum mixture and fry it like flour halva. After roasting, set the dough aside to cool. If you don't want to wait, you can mix it with a mixer and let it cool in a short time.\n* Crack an egg on the cooled dough and mix it with a mixer. Then crack another egg and continue mixing. The dough may disperse at first, but then it will come together. As a result, we get a paste-like dough. Adding two eggs will be difficult to get the ideal consistency. Therefore, be careful to add the eggs one by one.\n* We pour the dough mixture we prepared into the dough piping bags. We squeeze the eclair dough into short strips on the tray on which we put parchment paper. When the dough rises during baking, you can leave distances between them so that it does not deform. To shape the edges of the dough, you can shape it by wetting your hand. Bake at 180 \u00b0C / 355 \u00b0F for 30 minutes. Then turn off the oven and leave it in it for 10 minutes.\n\n**Proceed with preparing the cream:4**\n\n* While the eclairs are baking in the oven, add erythritol to 2 egg yolks and whisk until they turn white.\n* We begin to heat the cream in a saucepan. Be careful, we don't want the cream to boil. We add a pinch of salt to balance the sugar ratio and mix it. Slowly add the egg and erythritol mixture you have just prepared to the heated cream. Keep stirring constantly as you add the egg mixture to the cream. Otherwise, the eggs may be cooked. When you add the egg, you will see that the consistency of the cream begins to thicken. When the cream thickens, turn off the stove and add butter. We are waiting for the butter to melt with the heat of the cream itself. In the meantime, you can add your sugar-free vanilla but it is optional. If you don't want to add vanilla, you don\u2019t have to add it.\n* It is necessary to thicken the consistency of the cream a little more. This way it can be fluid. We add xanthan gum to activate it. To activate xanthan gum more quickly, you can mix it with a mixer after taking it from the stove. It will also cool faster. Then you can keep it in the refrigerator to solidify the butter inside.\n\n**Time to serve:**\n\n* This recipe makes about 15 eclairs. But you can adjust the eclairs size according to you by preparing larger or smaller eclairs. We take the eclair dough out of the oven. The outer crust of the right eclair dough needs to be very hard. Cut in half with a knife so you can see the gaps in the eclairs. Squeeze the cream into it with the help of the piping bags. You can also use a spoon if you want, but the piping bags will make it easier. At the same time, if you want without cutting it, you can drill two holes from the bottom and squeeze the cream from here.\n* As the last step, we will prepare the chocolate sauce on it. Melt the butter and crumble the 80 percent keto-friendly chocolate on it. You can turn off the stove. With the heat of the butter, the chocolate will melt. When the sauce and dough have cooled down slightly, dip your hands into the sauce. Pouring the chocolate sauce over can make it difficult to achieve the classic eclair look. After dipping the eclairs in chocolate sauce, we will let them freeze quickly. We can cover it and put it in the refrigerator so the cream and chocolate can freeze. The dark color of the eclairs is due to the fact that the almond flour is ground with their shells. If you use unshelled almond flour, the dough for the eclairs will be light.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/u8q492/keto_chocolate_eclairs/", "created_utc": 1650554708.0, "score": 4, "author": "erhndemr", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/u8q492/keto_chocolate_eclairs/", "html_title": ""}

Very Easy to make", "selftext": "step by step video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjfM57-y\\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajjfM57-y_8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo prepare this soup I will be using Instant Pot which makes the preparation process faster and easier. Entire cooking process should take you about 40 minutes including pressurizing and natural pressure release of the pressure cooker. \n\nIngredients: ( servings 8 ) \n\nSan Marzano tomatoes - 2 cans ( 28 oz each ) \n\nChicken broth - 4 cups\n\nHeavy whipping cream - 1 cup\n\nPotatoes ( medium ) - 2pcs ( peeled and cut on medium cubes ) \n\nSweet potatoes ( small ) - 5 pcs ( peeled and cut on medium cubes ) \n\nGarlic - 5 cloves ( finely chopped )\n\nAvocado oil - 2 tablespoons  \n\nOnion - 1pcs ( finely chopped ) \n\nSalt and Pepper - to taste \n\nDry basil - 1 teaspoon \n\nRed chili pepper flakes  - 1 teaspoon \n\n  For serving: fresh basil \n\nPastry top: \n\n* Puff pastry dough ( defrost before use )  \n* Egg - 1pcs ( we need egg white only ) \n\n**Preparation steps**\n\n**Step#1** \n\nChop onion and garlic, cut potatoes in medium cubes. Turn on Instant Pot on saute mode and fry onion until translucent ( about 5 minutes ), then garlic and fry for another minute. \n\nNow you can start adding the rest of the ingredients: potatoes, tomatoes and 4 cups of chicken broth. For the vegetarian version you can use water or vegetable broth instead. Then add spices: salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes and some dried basil. Since broth is already salty, don't add too much salt. You can always add more at the final stages of the cooking process. Now close the instant pot, turn on manual cooking mode and set for 10 minutes. \n\n**Step#2**\n\nWait for natural release to open up Instant Pot. You don't want to do manual release with a lot of hot liquid inside, it could go all over your kitchen. Using a hand held blender, mix soup on high until it becomes a very smooth, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to spill, it is very hot. Now you can taste it to make sure you have enough spices. Then stir in 1 cup of heavy cream, it will make the soup creamy. Sprinkle some fresh basil and it is ready to serve. \n\nIf you want to create a special experience for your family or guests I would recommend adding a pastry top which will make the presentation of this soup amazing. \n\nI am using store bought puff pastry from Trader Joe\u2019s. \n\n1. Put soup into ovenproof bowls\n2. Preheat oven to 375-400\u00b0F \n3. Cut out circles from the dough. Diameter of the circles should be about 1 inch larger than the diameter of the bowls.  This way the dough could be attached to the sides. I am using a larger plate to make a perfect circle. \n4. Put the egg white into a small bowl, add 1 tablespoon of water and beat lightly. \n5. Now using a pastry brush, paint one side of the circle with the egg wash and attach it on top of the bowl with the egg wash side down. Gently pull dough on all sides so it sits very tight on top of the bowl. Gently brush the top of the dough with egg wash and send it to the oven for \\~15 min or until the dough puffs and turns golden brown. \n\nBefore you serve, let it sit for 5-10 minutes. It is very hot. \n\nI hope you will enjoy this recipe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/u4m6ct/creamy_tomato_soup_in_an_instant_pot_with_store/", "created_utc": 1650070260.0, "score": 45, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/u4m6ct/creamy_tomato_soup_in_an_instant_pot_with_store/", "html_title": ""}

Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F and smash up 100g of Mini Eggs into small-medium pieces!\n\n2. In a bowl, add 165g flour, 1 \u00bc tsp. baking powder and a \u00bd tsp. salt. Whisk to combine and set aside. Into a mixing bowl, add 115g unsalted, softened butter and 200g sugar and cream this together. Make sure to scrape down your bowl every now and again to ensure all of your ingredients are fully incorporated.\n\n3. Now add 2 eggs, one at a time and combine. Then add 2 tsp. vanilla extract and combine. Finally, add 120g sour cream and mix!\n\n4. Stir your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients, but be sure not to over mix! Once your cupcake batter is just coming together, pour in your 100g crushed Mini Eggs and finish by mixing all the ingredients together by hand. \n\n5. Prepare your cupcake tins with cupcake papers and portion out your batter. Just be sure to fill them no more than two thirds full!\n\n6. Bake for 18 \u2013 22 minutes.\n\n7. Let\u2019s now make a beautifully decadent chocolate ganache! Heat a pan on medium-high and pour in 300ml of double / heavy cream. Finely, but roughly chop 300g dark chocolate. Place this chocolate into a bowl.\n\n8. Once you see steam and bubbles in your cream, that\u2019s when it\u2019s ready! Pour this over your chocolate! Give it a good mix together so the warm cream melts the chocolate! Keep mixing until your chocolate is smooth and has no lumps of residual chocolate.\n\n9. The ganache now needs to cool; you can place your bowl into a fridge, or set your mixer on low and let it continue to mix in order to help dissipate the heat. Once your ganache is cool and pretty firm, whip it up on a mixer at full speed until it resembles frosting! You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when your chocolate mixture lightens in colour!\n\n10. Pipe on your ganache frosting, add some whole Mini Eggs on top for decoration, some sprinkles (optional!) and serve!  \n\n\nIf you have any questions about the recipe, please do feel free to ask me here!

Before slicing onions, we would like to share a tip with you. If you leave your onions in the freezer for 1-2 hours without peeling, you will notice that onion rings will be more crispy when you eat them. Take the onions that are kept in the freezer for 1-2 hours and peel them. Cut the onions into rings about \u00bc inch thick by separating the layers. Choosing medium and large onions instead of small ones will make the recipe better. Take the sliced \u200b\u200bonions in a bowl and pour a bottle of soda from the refrigerator on it.\n2. As a second step, we take a whole egg and 2 egg yolks in a bowl and mix it well. Then we put flour on a plate and after that we start coating our onion slices. First of all, we apply this process one by one so that all the ingredients are covered with each onion ring. We take the onions one by one and blend it with the egg first. Then we combine the onion rings covered in eggs with flour. After dipping all the onion rings in egg and flour, we move on to the next step.\n3. Are you ready for the final stage before the frying part? We will coat the onion rings first with the egg and then with the breadcrumbs. So the breadcrumbs will make the onion rings more crispy. Then sprinkle the salt before frying.\n4. Lastly, fry the onion rings in hot oil until they turn golden. That\u2019s all! Your crispy and delicious snack is ready in only 20 minutes!\n\n# [Recipe Source](https://besthomemade.recipes/crispiest-homemade-onion-rings/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/u16n7v/recipe_used_by_5star_hotels_crispiest_homemade/", "created_utc": 1649680237.0, "score": 6, "author": "erhndemr", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/u16n7v/recipe_used_by_5star_hotels_crispiest_homemade/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My Nonna's Stuffed Shells | Conchiglioni with Ricotta and Spinach! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "Stuffed shells are a favourite in Italian homes for Sunday lunch! I used to make this pasta dish with my Nonna all the time! It's cheesy, creamy, comforting and so easy to make! Everyone in Italy loves these stuffed shells, and your family will too!\n\nLet me show you how to make a quick, easy and rich tomato sauce, a creamy spinach and ricotta filling, and how to fill your giant conchiglioni pasta shells! We then bring all these elements together, bake for a few minutes, and the result is one of the most amazing pasta dishes you've ever devoured!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, feel free to check out my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzCcX1UqXBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzCcX1UqXBY)  \n\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n500g conchiglioni pasta shells\n\n**Sauce:**  \n1 jar (700ml) passata  \n3 tbsp. olive oil  \n3 garlic cloves  \n2 tbsp. tomato paste  \nsugar to taste (optional)  \nsalt to taste (optional)  \n\n\n**Stuffing:**  \n100g parmesan cheese, grated  \n100g mozzarella cheese, grated  \n500g ricotta cheese  \n300g frozen spinach, thawed  \n2 eggs  \na good grating of nutmeg  \nsalt (to taste, optional)  \n\n\n**Topping:**  \n150g mozzarella cheese, grated  \n50g parmesan cheese, grated  \n\n\n\\-----  \n\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with a simple tomato sauce! In a saucepan heat 3 tbsp. olive oil and 2 tbsp. tomato paste. Cook those together until the tomato paste starts to melt into the olive oil and begins caramelising. Add 3 cloves of lightly crushed garlic, one 700ml jar of passata and season with salt. Let it slowly reduce on medium/low heat for around 25-30 minutes.\n\n2. Cook your 500g conchiglioni pasta in a pot of boiling water. Remember to add generous amounts of salt to your water! Cook your pasta just a few minutes less than instructed on the packet. Mine called for 14 minutes, so I cooked them for 12 minutes. When the timer goes off, drain your pasta and rinse them under cold water.\n\n3. Remove the garlic cloves from your tomato sauce. Give your sauce a taste and season accordingly. If your tomato sauce is a bit too bitter to tart, add some sugar to help balance it!\n\n4. Now to prepare your 300g thawed spinach! Squeeze your spinach to remove as much water as possible. I like to place my spinach in a clean tea towel, bring the edges of the tea towel up and together, then twist the ball of spinach to help remove any moisture. Once done, roughly chop your spinach into smaller pieces.\n\n5. Onto the filling! Into a bowl, add 500g ricotta cheese, one grated garlic clove, 100g grated parmesan, 100g grated mozzarella, the spinach you\u2019ve drained and chopped up, and a healthy grating of nutmeg! Give this a good mix together and season to taste. To finish, add 2 eggs and mix well!\n\n6. Preheat your oven to 190C | 375F. \n\n7. Pour some of your sauce into a 20cm x 30cm pan. You want around 1cm sauce in the bottom. Take one of your conchiglioni pasta shells and use a tablespoon to stuff it with your filling! Once the shell is full, place it in the sauce \\*filling side up\\*. Do the same with the remaining shells - until you run out of filling \u2013 or shells!\n\n8. Pour your remaining sauce over your shells and then top with 150g mozzarella and 50g parmesan.\n\n9. Bake for 25-30 minutes \u2013 or until it\u2019s bubbling up and the cheese topping is lovely and golden!\n\n10.

These mini cheesecakes take 5 minutes to make, there's no baking required and can be easily customised with your favourite mix-ins and toppings!  \n\n\nFor my mini cheesecakes, I'm making a vanilla mini cheesecake topped with biscuit sprinkles, a mini raspberry cheesecake with raspberries combined into the cheese mix, and I show you how to make a sauce (blueberries for me!) to make your mini cheesecakes look super fancy!  \n\n\nIf you're a visual learner, check out my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bYPWiTXTow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bYPWiTXTow)  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n**INGREDIENTS**  \n\n\n50g cream cheese  \n50ml double / heavy cream  \n1 tbsp. icing sugar  \n1/2 tsp. vanilla extract  \n2 biscuits (30g) (I used Digestives, but you can use Graham crackers)  \n1.5 tsp. butter\n\nBlueberry Sauce:  \n8 blueberries  \n1 tbsp. icing sugar  \na good squeeze of lemon juice (approximately 1 tsp.)  \n\n\n**Serves:** This creates one mini cheesecake! If you'd like to make 2 mini cheesecakes, double all the ingredients. You can scale up the ingredients for a larger cheesecake!  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Method:**  \n\n\n1. Melt 1.5 tsp. butter (microwave for 20-30 seconds) and thoroughly smash up 2 biscuits (30g) into small pieces!\n\n2. Pour your melted butter onto the biscuit pieces and stir until the butter is evenly distributed.\n\n3. Tip the biscuit pieces into a glass (or other serving vessel) and tamp down with a smaller glass, a spoon or other flat based implement.\n\n4. Into a bowl goes 50g cream cheese, 1 tbsp. icing sugar and \u00bd tsp. vanilla. Combine the mixture until smooth! Now add 50ml double / heavy cream and whisk, just until the cream becomes fluffy in texture.\n\n5. Add the cheesecake layer to your glass. You can easily do this with two spoons or a piping bag, if you have one!\n\n6. Sprinkle some more crushed biscuits on top for decoration and then chill for 30 minutes. \n\n7. Serve and enjoy!!   \n\n\nYou can store these cheesecakes in the fridge for up to 24 hours. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to add mix-ins (e.g. fruit, chocolate, caramel sauce etc.) to your cheesecake, do this at the end of step 4. Give the mixture a quick stir to ensure the mix-in is fully incorporated into the cheesecake. If you\u2019d like to add fruit, I usually crush it down with a fork before adding. \n\nWant to add a fruit sauce? Simply heat your fruit with a 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice and 1 tbsp. icing sugar. Mash the fruit down with a fork and cook on medium heat until the sauce begins to take the colour of the fruit. Then sieve the sauce to remove any unwanted detritus. Let it cool slightly, but whilst still warm, pour it over your finished cheesecake \u2013 and chill!  \n\n\nIf you have any questions about this recipe, please do feel free to ask!

After baking it for my family I felt so satisfied and happy because everyone loved this cute and super soft and delicious Oreo cream bread. Don\u2019t be intimidated by the detailed instructions, it\u2019s easier than you think. I hope it can warm your day\n\n[Full recipe and detailed instructions here](https://youtu.be/5yHzQwiRudY)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 210g bread flour\n* 20g sugar\n* 4g yeast\n* 3g salt\n* 80g warm milk\n* 1 large egg\n* 35g butter\n* 8 finely crushed oreos\n\n**Oreo cream filling:**\n\n* 150g cream cheese (room temperature)\n* 50g melted butter\n* 1tsp vanilla extract\n* 160g whipping cream\n* 20g sugar\n* 4 finely crushed oreos\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. In a large bowl, mix 210g bread flour, 20g sugar, 4g yeast, 80g warm milk, 1 large egg and 3 g salt. Roughly mix together until they form to a large piece of dough.\n2. Knead the dough for 2-3 minutes until all of the ingredients are well combined.\n3. Add in 35g soft unsalted butter in room temperature. You can knead the dough by hands (or stand mixer \u2013 in medium speed) for 10 -12 minutes depending on your speed and stand mixer\u2019s power until the dough is smooth and not stick to your hands (or the stand mixer\u2019s bowl) anymore. Try windowpane test, if the dough is stretchable and not tear easily when you stretch it\u2019s done.\n4. Let the dough rest in a warm place for 1 \u2013 1,5 hour\n5. Finely crush 8 original oreos ( without oreo cream) in a large bowl. Keep the oreo cream on the side for the oreo cream filling later **Make Oreo cream filling**\n6. Add 150g cream cheese (room temp) in a large bowl, and 50g melted butter, oreo cream above. Put the bowl to a double boiler and whisk until cream cheese and melted butter fully combine. Remove from heat and put aside. Add 1 tsp vanilla extract to the same bowl and whisk well until combined.\n7. In another bowl, beat 160g whipping cream and 20g sugar until stiff peaks. Gently fold in whipped cream to cream cheese. Mix in 4 finely crushed oreo. Chill this oreo cream in the fridge while making our oreo bread\n8. After 1 hour proofing, deflate the dough and divide into 6 equal pieces. Roll the dough flat using a rolling pin into a rectangular shape, scoop in 2 tsp crushed oreo and gently spread all over the bread dough, use the rolling pin to make the oreo stick to the bread dough. Then gently roll the dough lengthwise as tightly as possible, pin the ends to seal the bread. Let the oreo bread proof for another 30-40 minutes. Brush with melted butter and milk, bake at 350F for 13 minutes.\n9. After the oreo bread is baked and cooled down. Make a hole on two sides of the bread using a chopstick. Fill in oreo cream.\n10. Top with whipped cream mixed with oreo crumbs and decorate with more oreo (optional)\n\nOne bite of this sweet sweet Oreo bread can (temporarily) cure your sadness.

{"title": "Help! Husband only likes processed foods...", "selftext": "My husband and I have totally opposite taste buds. He was raised on highly processed junk foods. I'm not here to argue the health issues around that. I do believe there are no \"bad\" foods, but you ideally should live off of Dino nuggets, mini corn dogs, mac and cheese, frozen Pizzas, and other frozen processed meals. If it were up to him, he'd live off of it. We have a 2 year old now and I want to raise her eating a balanced menu. It would be nice to eat meals as a family, but my husband is beyond picky. I have accepted that I may just need to cook for my daughter and I and he does his own thing, but that isn't without challenges. She is noticing he eats different and asking questions. I don't want to demonize how he eats because I do believe that will just make her want to eat like him. I don't think creating food hierarchy mentality is helpful. However, I also don't want her eating like him. So, I'm attempting to find easy meals that are maybe dupes of \"junky\" food, or recipes that could check his boxes. \n\nWhen not eating highly processed foods, he does like some classic meat and potatoes type meals. Meatloaf, burgers, Shepherd pie, tatertot hot dish (i have a less processed recipe i make), lasagna, spaghetti, tacos, homemade hamburger helper, alfredo, steak... thats about all I can think of. \n\nAny suggestions or recipes would be greatly appreciated!!!\n\nEditing to add: wanting to make it clear my daughter does eat a balanced diet right now. Again, I'm more trying to prevent that from shifting by hopefully finding more meals my husband will eat with us. She loves a variety of fresh and cooked veggies and fruits. She even eats salad haha. She likes soups too. So far, she has a pretty healthy and ideal approach to the processed foods. I think this is because I minimize the stigma around them. I don't talk about them badly or as special treats. They're just other foods we sometimes eat, but not a lot of because eating a lot of them don't make us feel good. She's recently taken a liking to dove chocolate. Sometimes I give her one with dinner, sometimes I tell her it's not on the menu and she accepts it. I'm trying to vary it so she doesn't think we eat sweets with every meal. I also give it to her whenever she wants during the meal. Again, chocolate isn't a special gift she gets after eating what I determine enough food for her. If she asks mid meal, I make sure to tell her she can eat it then, but there isn't more coming after. So far, she eats the small piece and then eats the rest of her dinner.

", "selftext": "This recipe:\n\n\\* Is super easy\n\n\\* Is delicious -- it always turns out perfectly, and everyone loves it.\n\n\\* Uses ingredients you probably have around the kitchen already\n\n\n\n**Equipment:**\n\nA skillet that can go in the oven. I use one of those handle-less cast iron pans lined with ceramic. It's 13 or 14 inches across, and holds about 7 thighs. But I think a plain cast-iron skillet would work just as well.\n\n\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, thawed. I get the Foster Farms frozen ones, very cheap at Costco (and I assume other places as well). I cook 7 at a time because that is what my cast-iron skillet will hold.\n2. Olive oil or any other cooking oil\n3. About 2 TBSP minced garlic. (I've taken to just buying the big jars of it. I put half in a mason jar in my fridge, and freeze the rest.)\n4. About 1/4 cup butter\n5. Salt and pepper\n6. Parsley (Strictly optional, mainly just for appearance)\n\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400F\n2. Heat some olive oil at medium high in an oven-proof skillet (ideally one with a lid).\n3. Pat dry the chicken thighs. Generously salt and pepper both sides.\n4. When the oil is hot, put the thighs in SKIN SIDE DOWN. Cook them at med-high for 10 minutes, or long enough to make the skin crispy and golden-brown. Resist the urge to move them around!\n5. Flip the thighs over, so the skin is up. Reduce heat (because you are about to put in garlic, and don't want to burn it).\n6. Make some space in the pan and put in the butter and the garlic. (You can also brown the garlic in a separate pan and then add it to the skillet, if that works better for you.) Move the thighs around so the oil/butter/garlic mixture is spread more or less evenly around the pan.\n7. Cook on stove at reduced heat for 5-6 minutes, enough to brown the garlic.\n8. Pplace in oven for 40 minutes. It will come out perfectly. During this time you can make a salad or rice or whatever else you want.\n9. When ready to serve, spoon some of the oil/butter/garlic sauce over the chicken and sprinkle a little parsley on it.\n\nCredit: I got this recipe from [primaverakitchen.com](https://primaverakitchen.com)\n\nI hope you like it!

{"title": "Slow-cooker French Dip Sandwiches", "selftext": "Requires very little cooking know-how. This recipe only has one annoying step, slicing the meat, but the time investment is overall low (10 minutes max plus however long it takes to slice) aside from the ~5-6 hour total slow cook time, and you can even save any extra roast beef and/or au jus for leftovers or roast beef sandwiches later. A million times better than the Arby's slop.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n- 1 (3- to 4-lb) boneless chuck or rump roast, trimmed\n- 1 Tbs olive oil\n- 6 French rolls or hoagie buns (semi-firm is perhaps best)\n- sliced Provolone cheese (or preference)\n- 1/3 cup soy sauce\n- 1 cup Coke (NOT Diet coke, but the amount is not super critical. The can or small bottle is fine)\n- 2 10.5-oz can beef consomm\u00e9 (if you've never seen it, looks like [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Campbell-s-Condensed-Beef-Consomme-Soup-10-5-oz-Can/10321653?wl13=5270&selectedSellerId=0&wmlspartner=wlpa) but if you can't find it beef broth works too for a less strong flavor)\n- 1/4 cup dry chopped/minced onions (sometimes called onion flakes)\n- 1 Tbs beef bouillon\n- 1 tsp garlic powder\n- 1/2 tsp onion powder\n- 1/2 tsp dried oregano\n- 1/2 tsp salt\n- 1/2 tsp pepper\n- 1/2 tsp dried thyme\n- 1 bay leaf\n\nTrim any unwanted excess fat from meat. Heat olive oil (non-extra virgin probably best to smoke less) on medium-high heat in large skillet. Sear roast on all sides until lightly browned. No need to overthink this too much, it doesn't need to be perfect - you might want some tongs to grab and rotate the meat. Add to slow cooker and top with all remaining ingredients. Yes, really - you don't even need to mix them around that much, if at all. I personally tend to add the dry ingredients first on top and then pour the liquids over the top.\n\nCook on LOW for 4 hours then remove roast to a cutting board. Thinly slice roast ACROSS the grain. This is the annoying part, because the meat will be hot! You might need some tongs and/or a carving fork to hold it in place. Thinner is better but not a huge deal. Place sliced meat back in slow cooker (now everything will be fully covered by the au jus) and continue to cook on LOW for 1-2 additional hours.\n\nWhen ready to serve, remove roast and (optionally) strain fat from broth left in the slow cooker (there will be a lot) for dipping, which is your au jus!\n\nYou can now split the rolls and top each with beef and 2 slices of cheese, baking at 350 until cheese is melted. Alternatively, you can put the rolls and cheese to broil and add the meat after. Serve with reserved au jus - we like to use some mugs, small bowls, or what have you for individual dipping.

{"title": "Burrito Casserole a.k.a. Mexican Lasagne", "selftext": "I name-dropped a recipe I like in a meme subreddit completely unrelated to cooking, ended up sharing the recipe, and people seemed to really like it, so I thought I'd share in a cooking subreddit. I first saw a video on YouTube about it, but it was so long ago now. Spent a lot of time experimenting to refine it to suit myself.\n\nI really like this recipe because it tastes good, it's fairly quick, plus it gives me time to prep and clean while it's still cooking. When I'm alone it lasts me 4-5 meals. Kids and teens will love it. They love burritos right? Even my elderly parents like it.\n\nBurrito casserole (but my family calls it \"Mexican Lasagne\")\n\nPrep + cooking time: 90 minutes (optional rest time an additional 120 minutes), since the cooking phase is a lot of waiting, I usually chop my next ingredients while the previous ones are cooking\n\nDifficulty: Beginner-suitable (I am a beginner)\n\nEssential equipment: Oven, deep stovetop pan, round casserole dish about the size of a tortilla wrap\n\nServes: 4-5 people\n\nIngredients:\n\n* olive oil\n* 3 medium-to-large onions\n* 500g mince meat\n* 1 bell pepper (Red is good for colour, green or yellow acceptable)\n* 1 jar of preserved jalapenos\n* approximately 300g frozen peas/corn/carrots mix (I say approximately because I buy a 1kg bag of frozen mixed chopped veggies at a time and always eyeball it)\n* 1 can of four-bean mix or other canned beans. Which four beans are in the four-bean mix don't really matter. For reference, the one I use is a mix of cannellini beans, spagna beans, red kidney beans and chick peas. I've tried another one with a different four beans, but both were good.\n* melting cheese, approximately 700-800g (I usually have a 1kg bag on hand, probably the most expensive item on the list)\n* packet of tortillas, about 8 pieces (I usually only end up using 6)\n* taco spice mix (one part ground coriander, one part ground cumin, one part paprika, one part garlic powder, one part onion powder, and optionally, one part chicken bouillon) -- mix it yourself, it's SO much cheaper than the little ready-made packets which are 10-20x the cost by weight\n* bucket of Greek yoghurt as a 'side' to eat with the casserole, won't go into the actual cooking\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Dice three medium to large onions and caramelise in a deep pan with a splash of olive oil or other cooking oil. (Optional: once caramelised, remove from pan and put aside. This allows you to cook the meat in the next step fully without risk of burning the onions.)\n2. Cook 500g mince meat through fully, gradually breaking it up using your wooden spatula. Ensure all juices are evaporated. Re-add the caramelised onions if removed earlier.\n3. Add one chopped bell pepper, and add a large amount of chopped jalapenos (roughly 2/3 of the amount of onions), more is better than less.\n4. Once heated through, add mix of peas/chopped carrots/corns to the same volume as the jalapenos (frozen vegetable mix is convenient, but thaw by boiling or steaming first before adding).\n5. Add a drained can of four-bean mix (or other canned beans).\n6. Add approximately 6 tablespoons of taco spice mix (one part ground coriander, one part ground cumin, one part paprika, one part garlic powder, one part onion powder). Optional: add a tablespoon of mushroom or chicken bouillon. Stir through. The meat/vegetable mix (henceforth, the burrito mix) should thicken up with the addition of the spices. Add more spice to taste if needed.\n7. Ensure the spices don't stick to the bottom of the pan. If it does, add a few drops of hot water and scrape the bottom with your wooden spatula and it should come right off and mix with the rest of the burrito mix. Don't add too much water; burrito mix should be relatively dry, so if it ends up wet, continue heating and stirring until the burrito mix becomes quite dry again. Once mixed through and the taste is ideal, remove from heat source.\n8. In a round casserole dish, lay down a tortilla wrap. Use a knife to cut the tortilla so it fits the base of the dish perfectly. Spoon in a THIN layer of the burrito mix, then a layer of melting cheese. Lay the next tortilla wrap, pressing down on the previous layers to compress, to fit as much as possible in the dish. Repeat until dish is filled to the top. Top-most layer should be cheese, then the burrito mix under it. Do not put a tortilla on the top layer. (Optional: instead of using a tortilla wrap as the bottom-most layer, start with a thin layer of burrito mix, then tortilla, then burrito mix, then cheese.)\n9. Bake in an oven at 200 degrees Celsius, until cheese on top starts to brown (no more than 20 minutes), or to prevent the cheese from burning while ensuring the tortillas are cooked, bake for 10 minutes before adding top-most layer of cheese, adding the cheese layer and then baking another 10 minutes. \n10. Optional: Allow to cool for about two hours or more (like a pie) -- cutting and serving too quickly can cause the casserole to fall apart when served. If allowed to sit for a while, the 'lasagne' is more likely to keep its shape and look more presentable. (Casserole should still be warm after a couple hours.)\n11. Cut into large square slices like a lasagne.

Quarter Cup Of Barilla Elbow Pasta \n\nRecipe: \n1. In a large pot cook Barilla Pasta on high. \n2. Mix wine and sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg together in a bowl. \n3. Drain pasta. Do not turn heat off. \n4. Put butter into large pot. \n5. Wait 2 minutes. \n6. Turn to low. \n7. Pour in mixture from step 2 and pasta into pot. Use a spoon to scrape off the nutmeg. \n8. Mix for about 15 seconds. \n9. Pour everything into bowl. \n10. Garnish with 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. \n\nDone! \n\nWhen the heat has been on high for a while, butter gets to brown butter or almost brown butter much more quickly.

Usually isn't next to the vanilla extract but instead with the herbs.)  \n\\~ **Granulated Maple Sugar** (Generally the only one you will find of this in stores is Maple Joe Organic Maple Sugar in a green bag.)  \n\n\n\\~Now for how to make this. First off you want to make the sugar mixture and this is gonna go taste by taste. Some don't like too much cinnamon and some love it. I personally like a hint of the taste. So first get a bowl and pour in 1/3 Cup of Sugar. Next is to mix in cinnamon by putting in 1/8 Tsp to start out. You are gonna mix this finely with a spoon then give it a taste. Afterwards mix in another 1/8 Tsp if you want it a little stronger (I went with 2/4 Tsp). If not move on to the next step. For the Vanilla Powder add 1/4 Tsp. For the Maple Sugar add 3/4 Tsp (I went with 4/4 Tsp for a stronger flavor). With everything in the bowl, turn the bowl to one side and take the back of your spoon and crush the mixture to get any chunks crushed down. Mix once all the chunks are out and you are good.\n\n\\~Follow the instructions for the pretzels you have. Generally it is 400 degrees for 3-4 minutes. Sometimes longer for thicker pretzels. I go by a touch and feel method around 2-3 minutes where I feel the top of the pretzel and if it is warm and soft, it is ready to take out. \n\n\\~While the pretzels are in the oven, take another bowl, get a new spoon, and start scooping some butter into that bowl to microwave. How much butter depends on how many pretzels you are making and how big they are. You really cannot get too much butter with this recipe so don't be scared to overdo it. Once you got your butter in the bowl, throw it in the microwave for about 20-40 seconds depending on how much you have. You want it to fully melt. Once out of the microwave, stir the butter with the spoon and it is ready to lather on the pretzels. \n\n\\~With your pretzels out on a plate, start lathering on butter onto the pretzels (Butter these one at a time. Once one is buttered fully, put the sugar mix on them) with either the spoon or a brush that you would use for cooking. Don't be scared to ruin the pretzels with too much butter as excess will fall off the pretzels onto the plate. Now, with the sugar mixture in a spoon, pour the sugar mixture onto the pretzels at every inch you can find on the top surface. You will generally eye this and the rule of thumb is \"If you see sugar mixture that is dry, that area has a bit too much\" as you will want all the sugar mixture on the pretzel to be wet by the butter.\n\n\\~With all your pretzels buttered and topped with the sugar mixture, pop them into the microwave on that plate. Put them in for about 20-40, maybe 60 seconds, depending on how many you have. You want them to get to the point where they are hot to the touch or steaming. Once that is done, grab a fork and a knife and get to eating. Cut them as you eat to keep them warm. If they start getting cold again on the plate, just pop them back into the microwave as these things taste best when hot.

I work a regular 9-5 and would like to make bulks of food that i can keep in tupperware and bring to work. What i make is disgusting imo. I often through dinner ive made out and then brood in self-loathing about my lack of ability, despite all my efforts. I refuse to rely on heating up frozen pre-cooked food you buy in the store and fast food. Pre-made food in general is not an option, since i like having money. \n\nMy parents never taught me anything about cooking as a kid, whereas all my friends learned their basics growing up, usually from their mom. These friends are all decent to excellent chefs. I have consulted them many times and they give me advice like keep it simple, make stews, use garlic and onion and so on, but i feel like i lack the slightest sensitiviy when it comes to cooking. I cant predict what something will taste like. These people have honed skills over the years. I am still on square one.   \n\n\nDespite this, i do find it meditative and relaxing and a kind of joy to cook. I have hopes that are dashed every time.

I really wanted soup and I had corn cobs in the freezer but no chicken stock. I used water and it came out just fine. Very corny!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 6 ears corn, husks and silks removed\n* 1 1/2 quarts low-sodium canned or homemade chicken or vegetable stock\n* 1 bay leaf\n* 1 teaspoon whole fennel seeds\n* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds\n* 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n* 1 medium onion, finely diced (about 1 cup)\n* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced\n* 3 tablespoons flour\n* 1 to 2 russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 1 1/2 cups diced potato)\n* 2 cups half-and-half\n* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n* Sugar\n* 3 green onions, finely sliced\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Hold one corn cob upright in a large bowl and cut off kernels with a sharp knife. Repeat with remaining cobs and reserve kernels and cobs separately.\n\n2. Use the back of a knife to scrape corn cobs into a medium saucepan to collect any milk left in the bases of the kernels. Break corn cobs in half and add to saucepan. Add chicken or vegetable stock, bay leaf, fennel seed, coriander seed, and whole black peppercorns. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to just below a simmer, and let steep for 10 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and discard cobs and spices.\n\n3. While stock infuses, melt butter in a separate 3 quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, and corn kernels, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and kernels are tender, about 7 minutes. Reduce heat if butter begins to brown. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.\n\n4. Stirring constantly, gradually add infused corn stock, letting mixture come to a simmer. Add potatoes and 1 teaspoon salt. Let simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add half and half and stir to combine. Soup may look broken with melted butter floating on top at this stage.\n\n5. Transfer 1/4 of soup to a blender and blend on high heat until smooth, about 1 minute. Return to pot and whisk to combine. Alternatively, use a hand blender to blend in the pot until desired consistency is reached. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and sugar (with very fresh picked corn, sugar should not be necessary). Serve immediately, sprinkled with sliced scallions, or chill and serve cold. (Once chilled, you can adjust the texture by whisking in water a tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/17ln86t/serious_eats_corn_chowder/", "created_utc": 1698875262.0, "score": 17, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/17ln86t/serious_eats_corn_chowder/", "html_title": ""}

This easy recipe has you creating a roast: Beef, Pork, or Chicken, and then packaging up serving size pieces of that roast with RAW carrot, celery, and onion, freezing it, and later microwaving it first to dethaw and then to heat it up with spices and Soy Sauce. You won\u2019t want to have it any other way as reheating it invigorates it with spices while remaining moist and juicy.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 3lb Roast: Beef (Eye of Round, Top Round), Pork (Roast), Chicken\n* 2tsp each Salt, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper\n\n* 8 Servings: Carrot, Onion, Celery\n* Finishing Spices: Ginger, Garlic Powder, Red Pepper Chili Flake\n\n#Equipment\n\n* Meat Thermometer\n* Food Slicer\n* Rice Cooker\n* Roasting Pan\n* Oven\n* Microwave\n* Food Wrap or Food Bags\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Coat roast in a generous portion of Salt, Pepper, and Garlic Powder.\n\n2. Cook roast at 350^o (177C) to 145^o (63C) internal temperature Beef, 165^o (74C) Chicken, Pork. NOTE: The roast will continue to heat up to 20^o (14C) more degrees so pull it out a little sooner at your discretion. TIP: Put a little Chicken or Beef Broth, or Olive Oil at the bottom to the roasting pan to collect juices and to prevent scorching. (It should take 1 to 1.5 Hours or longer depending on size of roast).\n\n3. Clean and chop Carrot, Celery, and Onion into bite size pieces.\n\n4. Let the Roast cool up to an hour.\n\n5. Cut Roast into small serving size pieces. (Smaller than you think).\n\n6. Bag up roast pieces with RAW Carrot, Celery, Onion, and pour in a little juice from the roasting pan (Protects veggies from over freezing!)\n\n7. Freeze the individual bags in another bag. This can make 8 Servings from a 3lb Roast.\n\n8. When preparing the plate simply defrost the contents in a small bowl and then pour a little sprinkle of Ginger, Garlic Powder, Red Pepper Chili Flake or other spices, a little Soy Sauce and heat the mixture up in the Microwave until hot.

RECOMMENDED: Use \u201cthin slicer\u201d.\n* Collect Roast Aromatics (Celery, Carrot, Onion) into deep roasting pan. (This is called Mirepoix).\n* Rinse off and pat dry roast. Coat with a little Olive Oil. Season all over with Salt and Pepper, and place on top of Mirepoix (Celery, Carrot, Onion) in Roasting Pan.\n* IMPORTANT: Pour 1 Cup Beef Broth in pan to facilitate collection of Beef Jus. Do not use water. Lightly cover with Aluminum Foil or Parchment Paper.\n* Insert Meat Probe and bake at 325F (163C) until 125F (52C).\n* RECOMMENDED: Remove Aluminum Foil or Parchment Paper at 100F (38C) to let develop dry crust.\n* When finished cooking, wrap roast in Aluminum Foil or Parchment Paper and let cool 15 Minutes, and then into Freezer for 1 hour, and then into Refrigerator over night. (Watch temperature as it cools 15 Minutes and if it gets to 140F (60C) put it in the Freezer sooner). Since roast is so big it will continue to heat up in the center after removed and could over cook.\n* Pour the Beef Jus Mirepoix from the roasting pan into Jam Jars or other containers, along with Raw Mirepoix (The quality uncooked Celery, Carrot, Onion) and freeze over night. These are for reheating meals later.\n\n- OR - If you are using Thinly Sliced Ph\u1edf Steak or Skirt Steak.\n\n* Prepare Beef Jus Mirepoix differently by boiling Celery, Carrot, and Onion in Beef Broth until very soft, and then straining REMOVING the mushy vegetables.\n* Store the Beef Jus Mirepoix as before in Jam Jars along with fresh uncooked Celery, Carrot, and Onion.\n\nAfter roast has Refrigerated over night:\n\n* Cut roast into thin slices with \u201cThin Slicer\u201d.\n* Store thin slices along with raw Mirepoix (Celery, Carrot, Onion), and a little Beef Jus de Mirepoix, in single serving containers and freeze.\n\n#Meal Preparation\n\n* Make the best Chinese by gently defrosting and then reheating the Beef jus de Mirepoix in the Microwave and serving over rice. Use Chinese spices: Ginger, Red Pepper Chili Flake, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper, and optionally Hoisin and/or Oyster Sauce during defrosting and reheating.\n\n* Make the best soup by boiling Raman or Rice Noodles in Chicken Broth and adding 4oz Beef jus de Mirepoix.\n\n* Use Beef jus de Mirepoix as the best Au Jus dip for sandwiches or meat.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/16wdosj/beef_b\u0153uf_jus_de_mirepoix_magnificent/", "created_utc": 1696097544.0, "score": 6, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/16wdosj/beef_b\u0153uf_jus_de_mirepoix_magnificent/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Easy to make on a weeknight, and kids usually love it.  The dish is just a few steps of boiling pasta, poaching the chicken, mixing ingredients, and baking. \n\n\n# INGREDIENTS\n\n* 1.5 lbs skinless boneless whole chicken breasts (a little more or less is fine)\n* 1 jar (15 or 16 ounces) Alfredo sauce\n* 8 oz small \"tube\" pasta, like penne, mostaccioli, ziti, etc.\n* 6 oz shredded mozzarella, divided\n* 4 oz shredded cheddar\n* 2 Tbsp milk\n* 1 Tbsp onion powder (NOT onion salt)\n* 1 Tbsp garlic powder (NOT garlic salt)\n* Pinch of nutmeg, optional, there may be some in the sauce.\n\n# METHOD\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees\n\n2. Place whole chicken breasts in a pot, add water to cover the breasts by about 1/2 inch.  Bring pot to a boil, reduce to medium heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then drain.\n\n3. While the chicken boils, also boil the pasta in a second pot for about 10 or 11 minutes, then drain.  Pasta should be a little bit firm still, more cooking takes place in the oven.\n\n4. Cut cooked chicken into bite-sized chunks.\n\n5. In a large bowl, mix chicken, pasta, spices, Alfredo sauce, milk, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese until well blended.  \n\n6. Place mixture in a greased casserole dish, preferably 8\"x11\", or a deeper 9\" round baking dish.\n\n7. Mix remaining mozzarella and cheddar together and sprinkle evenly over the top.\n\n8. Bake at 350 degress for 30 to 40 minutes.  Cheese should be turning golden brown.\n\n# NOTES\n\nSave more time by using pre-grated cheeses.  You can add some broccoli florets to this for a \"complete meal\" as my home-ec teacher used to say.  Be sure to use the onion and garlic *powders* and not the salt, using salted ones will make this dish too salty.

{"title": "Chicken Strip Fettuccine: 1-Dish Wonder", "selftext": "Can't say I've actually had or made chicken spaghetti or chicken fettuccine alfredo, so I don't know if this would be similar to those.\n\nIt's a simple and easy dish suitable for anyone with basic cooking skills. If you can boil noodles and bake pre-packaged chicken strips, you can do this.\n\nDo note that I usually do this in a 5 qt pot and share it at work. You can either experiment to reduce the amount to suit your particular situation (single, couple, etc) or just make the 5 qt pot and deal with the leftovers.\n\nWhat you'll need:\n\n\\- Some Tyson (or your preference) Southern Style Chicken Strips and Buffalo Style Chicken Strips. I usually use 3 of each variety, of considerable size (4\" or longer). Note the Honey BBQ may not go well with this. I haven't tried it, because I'm not a fan of that variety. Obviously you can also use your own raw (cooked to your liking) chicken variety, but I find the breading adds to it.\n\n\\- 1 can Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup, 1 can any other Cream Of soup variety (celery, mushroom, etc). These two will easily manage a 5qt pot of noodles, especially when you add water.\n\n\\-Fettuccine (obviously). How much is up to you. I always do either way too much or not enough.\n\nBoil the noodles in a 5qt pot until they're done (this depends on how soft or how chewy you like them).\n\nDrain most of the water out, or you can add some back in later.\n\nAdd the two cans of Cream Of whatever, (and 1/2 can of water if needed) stir and simmer while the chicken cooks.\n\nBake the chicken strips according to the bag. Cut into chunks when they're done. Add chicken to noodles. Stir to distribute the chicken evenly. Boil for maybe 5 minutes so the flavors can really blend, especially the Buffalo chicken seasoning.\n\nServe with garlic bread, maybe some mixed vegetables.\n\nI have tried this with regular spaghetti noodles and was not a fan. I'm not a noodle scholar, but I'm guessing it's more than the shape that defines them.\n\nAlso, the \"alfredo\" thing I don't really do, but I understand it's an additional sauce component, or a particular type of sauce (according to the jars I see on store shelves)? Anyway, I have no idea how that would work here.\n\nAlso note that an inherent aspect of ready-made chicken strips is that the breading will likely have very hard bits, usually towards the ends. Try to keep these out of the noodles, if you value your teeth. The sauce does nothing to soften these up.\n\nA nice variation on this is to replace the noodles with mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, etc) and you end up with something fairly similar to the contents of a chicken pot pie.

Since you liked the spinach and ricotta quiche, I want to share with you this other recipe which is so easy and taste to make! Unfortunately it's not vegetarian. Hope you like it!\n\nFor me this recipe is special since my mother always prepared it as an appetizer for my birthdays when I was a kid. It's easy to make, fast and delicous!\n\nThe name **Valdostana** comes from Valle d'Aosta, an Italian region from which the Fontina cheese comes from. I suggested mozzarella as a substitute since Fontina may be hard to be found outside Italy, however, the success is guaranteed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients:\n\n1.32 pounds (600g) Puff Pastry\n\n3.53 ounces (100g) Cooked Ham\n\n2.37 fluid ounces (70ml) Tomato Passata\n\n5.29 ounces (150g) Mozzarella (even better: Fontina cheese)\n\n1 Egg Yolk\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. To make this recipe, you will need two puff pastry discs of approximately 11.81 inches (30 centimeters) in diameter. You can use ready-made puff pastry.\n2. Place the first puff pastry disc on a work surface (on which you have already placed a sheet of parchment paper to facilitate transferring the savory pie to the baking sheet).\n3. Inside the puff pastry disc, arrange a layer of cooked ham, making sure to leave at least 1.18 inches (3 centimeters) from the outer edge of the disc.\n4. Place the mozzarella, either sliced or shredded, on top of the cooked ham, being careful not to go beyond the 1.18 inches (3 centimeters) border of the disc.\n5. Spread a thin layer of tomato passata evenly over the mozzarella using a spoon.\n6. Cover the first disc and its contents with the second puff pastry disc, and use your fingers to seal the edges of the upper disc to the lower one (which is why I advised you to leave a 1.18 inches/3 centimeters border free from the filling). This step will help cook the filling without it leaking out of the pie.\n7. Lightly beat the egg yolk and brush the surface of the pie with a kitchen brush. Then transfer the parchment paper with the pie on top to a baking sheet. Place the Valdostana-style savory pie in a preheated oven at 356\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and bake for 20 minutes. Once it's cooked, let the pie cool, and then serve it when it's still warm or at room temperature.\n\nEDIT sorry guys I don't live in the US and I don't know what is the best alternative to tomato passata", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/14t3e4j/valdostana_savory_pie_the_taste_of_my_birthdays/", "created_utc": 1688725859.0, "score": 28, "author": "ehiwtf", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/14t3e4j/valdostana_savory_pie_the_taste_of_my_birthdays/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "One-pan sausage and zucchini skillet meal", "selftext": "I was looking for something a little different the other day, and came across this sausage and zuchini skillet recipe.  It was wonderfully flavorful, even using mild italian sausage.  I'm very eager to try other kinds of sausage like half-and-half hot and mild italian, or maybe even chorizo.\n\nTrust me, this is easy.  It's just browning the sausage, sauteing some vegetables, and then simmering all the ingredients for a few minutes. \n\nThis recipe calls for a package of ready-to-eat rice, but if you want to make the rice, start with 1/2 cup dry rice and cook normally, or use about 1 1/4 cup of already-cooked rice.  I used a package of brown rice, because I don't normally stock brown rice, and it was very good.\n\nThis serves 6, about 400 calories per serving.  Overall time is about 30 minutes (more if you're pre-cooking your own rice).\n\n\n# Ingredients\n\n* 1 lb ground/bulk pork sausage\n* 2 medium zucchinis, sliced into about 1/8-inch wheels\n* 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped\n* 1 can (14.5 oz) stewed tomatoes\n* 1 package (8.8 oz) ready-to-eat rice, aka \"90-second\" rice\n* 1 Tablespoon Dijon mustard\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1/4 teaspoon pepper\n* 1/4 Cup water\n* 1 Cup shredded sharp cheddar\n* 1 teaspoon cooking oil (if needed)\n\n# Method\n\n0. Pre-cook the rice if not using the package.\n\n1. In a LARGE skillet, break up and cook the sausage over medium heat for 5 to 7 minutes, until no pink remains and sausage is in crumbles.  Leaving some large crumble pieces is good.\n\n2. Remove sausage to a plate with a large spoon, leaving as much grease/oil in the pan as you can.  Add another teaspoon of oil to the pan if needed.  Return pan to heat.\n\n3. Add zucchini and onion to the pan and saute for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\n4. Stir in sausage, tomatoes (and juices), rice, mustard, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Break up the stewed tomatoes into small pieces.  \n\n5. When bubbly, reduce heat to medium-low, add water and stir, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n6. Place into large serving dish, sprinkle grated cheese on top, and let sit for 2 or 3 minutes, covered if possible, for cheese to melt.  (Make sure the cover is not touching the cheese.)\n\n# Notes\n\nYou can bypass the serving dish, add the cheese to the skillet, cover, let sit off the heat, and serve right from the skillet, but my wife does not like skillets on the table.\n\nIf using a serving dish, you can use that for the sausage when sauteing the veggies, one less dish to wash.\n\nAlthough this is quite flavorful, a 1/4 tsp chili pepper flakes may add a really nice zing.

{"title": "Easy Chicken Divan", "selftext": "I swear, once you do this, you see it really is easy.  It's basically browning chicken, making a sauce, and simmering.  And, this is a great dish to have fun with, not being so concerned with precise amounts, and just having fun making the sauce to taste. I will give measurements for some things, but that's a guideline, not a rule.  When I make this, I just kind of \"add some wine\" and \"add some cream.\"  This also works well with pork chops, see Notes.  Prep time is usually less than 5 minutes and cook time is about 12 minutes. \n\nServes 4.\n\n# Ingredients\n\n* Two boneless chicken breasts, sliced horizontally to make four thin cutlets\n* One medium head of broccoli cut into florets (discard thick stems)\n* White wine (about 6 ounces)\n* Cream (about 6 ounces)\n* Grated cheddar (about 1/4 cup)\n* Dijon mustard (about 1 heaping tablespoon)\n* Garlic, minced (about 2 or 3 cloves, or more to taste)\n* Butter\n* Flour\n* Salt\n* Pepper\n\n# Method\n\n* Bring a large skillet to temp over medium-high heat and add about 3 TBSP of butter.\n\n* While the butter is melting, dredge each side of the chicken through the flour, shake off excess, and salt and pepper both sides to taste. \n\n* When the butter is getting bubbly, add the cutlets to the butter and saute each side until brown, about 90 seconds per side.  Color should be a deep golden brown, so cook a little longer if needed, but be careful not to overcook.\n\n* Remove the cutlets to a plate (keep warm in a warm oven if possible.)\n\n* Add more butter to the skillet, and when melted, add the garlic and broccoli and saute for 2 minutes.\n\n* Add the wine, cream, dijon mustard, cheese, and a little salt and pepper, and stir until smooth and bubbly.  \n\n* Reduce heat to medium.  *Carefully* take a taste of the sauce and add more of anything you feel may be lacking.  \n\n* Return the chicken cutlets to the pan, make sure they are covered with the sauce, cover the skillet and let simmer on medium heat for about 3 minutes.\n\n* Place cutlets and broccoli on a platter, but leave at least half of the sauce in the pan.  Return the pan to the heat, add another splash of wine, and scrape any wonderful brown bits off the bottom of the pan.\n\n* Pour remaining sauce over chicken and broccoli.\n\n\nThat's it.  \n\n# Notes\n\nI serve this with a side of rice and it's just a wonderful, rich comfort meal. I usually buy fresh broccoli florets in a bag when using broccoli, as it saves time cutting, and I don't need to throw away the thick stems.  When I use these, I use about 1 1/2 cups of florets for this recipe.  I do not recommend frozen florets, as these generally include far too many stem pieces that don't cook at the same rate as the florets.  You CAN make this same recipe with *thin* pork chops, as well.  Just make sure they are no thicker than 1/2 inch.\n\nAs Chef John from Food Wishes says \"Can you use half-and-half?

{"title": "Looking for an easy recipe using cottage cheese", "selftext": "Afternoon, all.\n\nI am looking to use up some cottage cheese I have and I thought I could make a kind of sweet refrigerator pie from it.  I rarely follow recipes, using them more as starting points and substituting what I have on hand.  For some reason, I thought if I used the cottage cheese (blended?) and some instant pudding, maybe some cool whip, I should be able to make an easy filling for a cookie crust (which will also use up some cookies that need to be used.)  But I can't find a recipe online for something like that.  I have been on SuperCook, as well but still no luck.  Anyone here have suggestions for me?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit:  I found a YouTube video where they used cottage cheese, instant pudding and CoolWhip to make a dessert.  Going from that, I blended the 16 oz of cottage cheese until smooth and added in 1/2 package of instant banana pudding (I would have preferred chocolate but I had banana so...).  It was super thick so I added a couple tablespoons of half and half.  Then, I added in 1/2 an 8 oz container of cool whip and blended again.  Seemed like a good consistency, so I sliced a banana and stirred it in.  Tastes pretty good.  Dumped in into a cookie crumb crust I made from sandwich cookies and chilled it.  I will put the rest of the Cool Whip on top once it is well set.\n\nI have friends who are elderly and whose appetites aren't great.  I think this will be a great treat to take them tomorrow.  Protein from the cottage cheese and some fruit plus just some calories, all of which they need.\n\nThanks everyone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/143jz9d/looking_for_an_easy_recipe_using_cottage_cheese/", "created_utc": 1686160306.0, "score": 17, "author": "WAFLcurious", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/143jz9d/looking_for_an_easy_recipe_using_cottage_cheese/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Granola Using Instant Oatmeal", "selftext": "I had a lot of leftover instant oatmeal packets in my house that was just past the best by date or in flavors that my household didn't really like and weren't eating. Solution - turn it into granola to eat on yogurt. Much, much cheaper than storebought granola, and the flavor that wasn't good in the texture of oatmeal was better when baked on something crunchy!  \n\n\nINGREDIENTS:  \n\\- Instant oatmeal - flavored is fine, unflavored is fine, whatever you have in the house.  \n\\- Maple syrup and/or honey - about 1 Tablespoon per cup of oatmeal.  \n\\- If oatmeal is unflavored: cinnamon, nutmeg, salt.  \n\\- Optional: chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans are good), dried fruit (raisins or craisins)  \n\n\nDIRECTIONS:  \n\\-Preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit.  \n\\-Pour oatmeal into a large bowl. If using flavored oatmeal, remove any large clumps of sugar/cinnamon/flavor mix. If using unflavored, add a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg per cup of oatmeal and a pinch of salt per cup of oatmeal. If adding nuts, add nuts now.  \n\\- Add maple syrup and/or honey, about 1 tablespoon per cup of oatmeal, and mix well. I like to use half maple syrup, half honey as I don't like an overpowering maple flavor but also saves me from using so much honey as it's expensive!  \n\\- Add the syrup/honey slowly and mix between each spoonful - you want enough that the oatmeal begins to stick together, but not enough that there are any pools of liquid. Add a few more spoonfuls if necessary. It's okay if there are a few dry spots.  \n\\- Spread out evenly on a baking sheet (with parchment paper is best to avoid sticking).  \n\\- Bake for 20-30 minutes, giving it a stir every 10 minutes. It will be harder to spread out evenly as it begins to harden and stick together, this is okay and creates those yummy chunks of granola, but do spread as evenly as possible after each stir.  \n\\- When the oatmeal begins to turn golden brown and most of it is this color, remove from the oven. It may still be a little sticky, but let it sit for 10 minutes and see if it becomes crunchy. If not, you can put back in for 10 more minutes.  \n\\- After cooling, if adding dried fruit, add now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/13jonth/granola_using_instant_oatmeal/", "created_utc": 1684290234.0, "score": 69, "author": "None", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/13jonth/granola_using_instant_oatmeal/", "html_title": ""}

I'm excited it's starting to warm up and almost outdoor party season again!\n\nRecipe from this blog: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-bars-recipe/#tasty-recipes-67259\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Shortbread Crust**\n\n* 1 cup (230g; 2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted\n* 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar\n* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 2 cups + 2 Tablespoons (265g) all-purpose flour\n\n**Lemon Filling**\n\n* 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar\n* 6 Tablespoons (46g) all-purpose flour\n* 6 large eggs\n* 1 cup (240ml) lemon juice (about 4 lemons)\n* optional: confectioners\u2019 sugar for dusting\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9\u00d713 glass baking pan (do not use metal) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.\n\n2. Make the crust: Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 4.\n\n3. Make the filling: Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.\n\n4. Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.\n\n5. Once cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\n\n6. Freezing Instructions: Lemon bars can be frozen for up to 3-4 months. Cut the cooled bars (without confectioners\u2019 sugar topping) into squares, then place onto a baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour. Individually wrap each bar in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and place into a large bag or freezer container to freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator, then dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar before serving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/127qidr/lemon_bars/", "created_utc": 1680279429.0, "score": 181, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/127qidr/lemon_bars/", "html_title": ""}

Finely dice a red onion and use it instead of the pickled sliced red onions.\u00a0\n4. Use an envelope or 2 Tbsp of purchased **Taco Seasoning** instead of making your own.\u00a0\n\n## Step by Step Instructions for Quinoa Tacos\n\n1. Make the **Vegan Cilantro-Lime Creme** ahead of time and refrigerate until ready to serve.\u00a0 To make the Cilantro-Lime Creme blend, raw cashews, water, cilantro, roasted garlic, salt, nutritional yeast, and lime juice.\u00a0\u00a0\n2.

The Quinoa is toasted, rinsed, and then cooked for simple step-by-step instructions on **How to Cook** fluffy, perfect Quinoa every time.\u00a0\n4. While the Quinoa is cooking, make the sweet red pepper slaw.\u00a0 Thinly slice the peppers and toss them with a tablespoon of lime juice and a pinch of salt.\u00a0 Set aside.\n5. Melt the coconut oil in a frying pan on medium heat.\n6. Add the cooked Quinoa and ***DIY Taco Seasonings***. \u00a0If you don\u2019t have DIY taco seasoning, add (2 tsp Cumin, 2 tsp Chilli powder, 2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 2 tsp umami powder).\n7. Cook for about 5 minutes or until the bottom is slightly crispy.\n8. Add the remaining lime juice(about 2 Tbsp.), sliced scallions, and optional green dragon sauce.\u00a0 Mix and cook for another minute.\n9. Heat the tortillas in a **hot skillet** until lightly browned.\u00a0 Don\u2019t overcook them; they will break when you try to stuff them.\n10. Set out the Cilantro Lime Creme, red onion pickles, slices of avocado, pepper slaw, lettuce, and a jar of the Best Homemade Salsa.\n11. Assemble the Tacos: Add the Quinoa to the warmed taco and top it with the toppings.\u00a0 Serve immediately.\n12.

But I think a plain cast-iron skillet would work just as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, thawed.

Heat some olive oil at medium high in an oven-proof skillet (ideally one with a lid).\n\n3. Pat dry the chicken thighs. Generously salt and pepper both sides.\n\n4. When the oil is hot, put the thighs in SKIN SIDE DOWN. Cook them at med-high for 10 minutes, or long enough to make the skin crispy and golden-brown. Resist the urge to move them around!\n\n5. Flip the thighs over, so the skin is up. Reduce heat (because you are about to put in garlic, and don't want to burn it).\n\n6. Make some space in the pan and put in the butter and the garlic. (You can also brown the garlic in a separate pan and then add it to the skillet, if that works better for you.) Move the thighs around so the oil/butter/garlic mixture is spread more or less evenly around the pan.\n\n7. Cook on stove at reduced heat for 5-6 minutes, enough to brown the garlic.\n\n8. Cover the skillet and place in oven for 40 minutes. It will come out perfectly. During this time you can make a salad or rice or whatever else you want.\n\n9.

Mix spices together into a spice mix (NOT the oil or butter that is for non-sticking the pan). This makes VERY flavorful meat. Leave out some spice mix if you do not want super flavorful meat. Also leave out the smaller amount spices if you do not have them. Do not put more trust me.\n\n2. Mix spice mix really well into defrosted Ground Beef.\n\n3. Heat a wok or skillet to 300^o Fahrenheit (150^o Celsius) with melted Olive Oil and Butter.\n\n4. Fry meat in 1 big brick 2 min. each side for 80/20 ground beef or 1 minute each side for 90/10 ground beef (because the less fat content makes it brown faster) or until nicely grizzled.\n\n5. Cut the meat brick in half and grizzle its exposed inside making note of how pink it remains.\n\n6. Continue cutting and grizzling meat until you cut the meat and it is no longer pink in the middle (a total time of approximately 12 minutes). (Perhaps let it sit covered for a couple minutes if you want to be reassured it is going to be fully cooked).\n\n7. Serve with warm Pita Bread (or Naan), Tzatziki Sauce, Hummus, Kalamata Olives, Sliced White Onion, Sliced Tomato.\n\nNOTE: This dish requires \\*NO MARINATION\\*, \\*NO PRE-BAKING\\*.

Dry Rubbed\n3. Dry Rubbed Sauced\n4. Dry Rubbed Glazed\n5. Breaded\n\nThis Chef Jean-Pierre [recipe](https://youtu.be/-bRHMZcDUOE) shows a fantastic Dry Rubbed Glazed method. The real secret is not in the seasoning (which is complex) but in the method, which is simple, and has produced a fantastic chicken wing\u2014 Crispy, flavor throughout, somehow still moist and saucy. Shown here is approximation of the full recipe based on ingredients I actually have and description of the full technique.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 1lb Chicken Wings\n* 2tsp Olive Oil\n* Dry Rub: 2tsp Paprika, 1tsp Onion Powder (I used crushed dried minced onion), 1tsp Herb de Provence, 1tsp Garlic Powder, 1/4tsp Cayenne, 1/4tsp Cumin.\n* Glaze: Use your imagination and whatever you have on hand: 1Tbsp Oyster Sauce, 1Tbsp Lee & Perrin\u2019s, 2tsp Sriracha (I used Frank\u2019s), 1Tbsp Honey, 2tsp Maple Syrup, 1tsp Sesame Oil (I used 1Tbsp Melted Butter)\u2014 You could also use Texas Barbecue Sauce, Black Pepper Teriyaki Sauce, or any other glaze of your choice.\n* Dipping Sauce: It is essential to have some kind of cream sauce if you will be making a hot glaze otherwise it\u2019s not necessary. Use your imagination: 1Tbsp Sour Cream, 1Tbsp Yogurt, 1Tbsp Blue Cheese, 2tsp Dijon Mustard, 1Tbsp Mayonnaise, 2tsp Hot Sauce, 1tsp Garlic, 2Tbsp Parsley\u2014 You could also just use Ranch Dip to great effect.\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. If necessary cut and discard tips \u201cscratchers\u201d, and separate wings \u201cflappers\u201d from the drumettes.\n\n2. In a mixing bowl coat in 2tsp Olive Oil.\n\n3. Coat in dry rub.\n\n4. Bake in a preheated oven 350^o Fahrenheit (177 Celsius) for 45 minutes. (375^o / 191^c if you are farther from the burner element or are using regular chicken leg drum sticks or large chicken\u2019s wings, or according to package instructions). I placed mine on a flat metal rack and flipped them after 20 minutes. They came out very dry and somewhat shrunken. I thought they were overcooked but the glaze softened them up preventing them from drying out and they were actually perfect and still moist.\n\n5. In a clean mixing bowl toss them in the glaze. I think this is important to make them not dry out. The glaze should be slightly wet at this point. When tasting a little bit of the glaze if it is safe to taste you should go mmm not eww.\n\n6. Broil under the broiler for 4 to 5 minutes. Chicken wings should be crispy, and look sparkling and glazed.\n\n7. Serve with celery, carrot and (if hot variety) cream based dipping sauce.\n\nEnjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/113yx1c/chef_jeanpierre_style_chicken_wings_aile_de_poulet/", "created_utc": 1676575948.0, "score": 18, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/113yx1c/chef_jeanpierre_style_chicken_wings_aile_de_poulet/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Asian Ginger Pork over Rice", "selftext": "Seriously wonderful to live with a genius. How do you get Chinese style Pork pieces while ensuring they are tender on the inside while golden brown on the outside? One way of course is to Wok at high heat. Another way has to do with how they are cut for cooking. Preparing the entire filet is not wise because it cooks unevenly. Preparing as cubes if not done properly is not wise because they can overcook before flavor has a chance to penetrate the meat.\n\nThe technique revealed here is to cut your pork into strips that are the size of the cubes you want, but the strips will be cut into cubes at the end. That will allow the Pork to cook more evenly while remaining juicy on the inside and allow them to get nicely golden brown on the outside, and cook at a lower temperature, 300^o, so that the flavors have time to penetrate the meat during cooking.\n\nThis technique and the steps described below has fantastically delivered full flavored meat through the whole meat while remaining tender and also golden brown on the outside. How can you do the dish better?\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 16 Oz Pork Filet\n* 1/4 Tsp Ginger\n* 1/4 Tsp Mustard Powder\n* 1 Tsp Garlic Powder\n* 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper\n* 1 Tbsp Butter\n* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 8 Oz Rice\n* 1/4 Tsp Black Pepper\n* OPTIONAL: 2 Tsp Turmeric, 1 Tsp Tarragon, 1.5 Tbsp Dried Parsley\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Defrost the Pork to just under frozen. Cut the Pork into strips as described above. Coat the Pork in Ginger, Mustard Powder, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper and Soy Sauce and let soak for 15 minutes.\n2. Fry the Pork strips in Olive Oil and Butter at 300^o for 2 minute intervals turning on each of the 4 sides to get them golden brown. Approximately 8 minutes.\n3. Pour in the rest of the Soy Sauce, Spices and Resting Juices from the marination bowl and cover allowing Pork to complete cooking. Approximately 2 minutes or as desired.\n4. Cube Pork onto Rice. (OPTIONAL: Treat Rice with Turmeric, Tarragon, Black Pepper, Dried Parsley). Pour 1/2 of pan juices onto rice. Heat up rice in microwave if necessary until billowing steam and fluff until acceptably dry and added spices are cooked.

Golden brown and crispy everywhere except the breast skin, which can be browned in the last 10-15 minutes by turning the chicken back over.\n\nAn easy recipe because it does not involve flipping or basting the bird every 15 minutes. The only improvement would be to rotisserie the chicken in the bread pan if notches could be cut to let the rotisserie blades rotate and it made to fit so that it picks up and self bastes in its juices.\n\nShown here is a Lemon Pepper, Rosemary and Thyme recipe.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 1 Small Chicken\n* 2 Tbsp Lemon Pepper Seasoning (Lemon Zest, Black Pepper, Salt)\n* 0.125oz Rosemary or 2 Tsp Dried Rosemary\n* 0.125oz Thyme or 2 Tsp Dried Thyme\n* 1 Lemon\n* 1 Tbsp Butter\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Apply Lemon Pepper, Butter, Rosemary and Thyme to the surface, crevices, and to the inside of the Chicken. (NOTE: Fresh herbs are more grassy and full bodied while dried herbs are more roasted and sharp. Dried herbs will burn so possibly place them underneath (which is coincidentally the \u201ctop\u201d of the actual chicken as sitting when served i.e. breast side up)).\n2. Wrap a Lemon in Rosemary and Thyme and stuff into Chicken. (OPTIONAL: This brings out a sweetness mostly to inner parts of chicken.)\n3.

The time shown was based on a glass bread pan.

Simply bake the meat in a bread pan for 45 minutes to 1 hour, and you are basically ready to eat Gyros. No slaving over the stove. No real techniques (except spicing).\n\nEven the Tzatziki and Hummus are easy to make, although, provided those are pre-made, putting a platter together of Pita bread, Kalamata Olives, Feta Cheese, Hummus, Tzatziki Sauce, Tomatoes, and Onions is only a matter of opening the relevant packages, washing and slicing the relevant vegetables.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 1 Lb Ground Beef\n* 1 Lb Ground Lamb\n* 20 Kalamata Olives\n* 5 Oz Hummus\n* 5 Oz Tzatziki Sauce\n* 2 Oz Feta Cheese\n* 1 Tomato\n* 1/2 Onion\n(RECIPE UPDATE: De-emphasize chili and cumin and emphasize coriander, minced onion, and parsley, salt and pepper, original shown below)\n* Gyros Seasoning: (2Tbsp Parsley,\n2/3 Tbsp Chili,\n2/3 Tbsp Cumin,\n1Tbsp Ground Coriander,\n1Tbsp Minced Onion,\n2/3Tbsp Oregano,\n2/3Tbsp Thyme,\n1/2Tbsp Paprika,\n1/2Tbsp Garlic Powder,\n1Tsp Cinnamon,\n1Tsp Sea Salt,\n1/2Tsp Black Pepper)\n\n#Instructions\n\n1.

When the Gyros loaf comes out (if it is no longer pink in the middle), you are ready to eat it alongside a platter of: Pita Bread, Hummus, Tzatziki, Kalamata Olives, Onion, Tomato, and Feta Cheese. (You can also pan fry the Gyros meat after baking to complete it or for extra crispiness).\n\nIt really is that simple. I made mine without Onion and Tomato, and I let it cook for the whole hour. It came out crispy, somewhat dry, and very well done. I also did not marinade it for the hour and it did taste like it needed some time marinading for the spices to settle. Although it seemed like a lot of spices at the time it came out tasting somewhat mild. That was fine though as the Hummus and Tzatziki, Kalamata Olives, and the soft delicious Pita Bread all pulled through to deliver that classic Gyros taste. Almost like what you get in your favorite Gyros restaurant.\n\nIf anybody knows how to improve or to spice the Gyros differently or better please tell us in the comments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10maa40/gyros/", "created_utc": 1674788253.0, "score": 3, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10maa40/gyros/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
{"title": "How my grandma in Italy taught me to make red sauce (staple for all week, easy)", "selftext": "My grandma was born in Puglia, raised in Milan where my mother was born. I\u2019ve seen a lot of recipes for American forums that seem to complicate red sauce. So figured I\u2019d share how I was taught in Italy to make an \u201ceasy red sauce\u201d that can be used as a staple all week (can be used by itself, or as a base for pink sauce, etc). \n\nIngredients:\n1. Fresh yellow sweet onion \n2. Fresh basil\n3. Good quality Olive oil (NOT extra virgin, we don\u2019t cook with extra virgin and it will change flavor)\n4. Real Butter (I use salted)\n5. Salt (I use pink Himalayan) \n6. Black pepper \n7. Optional - cracked red pepper \n8. Canned tomato \u201csauce\u201d (such as Hunts). (Not jar premade sauce, just the straight canned tomato that\u2019s not cooked or anything, I use Hunts in the states)\n\nSteps:\n\nWe eye everything. So unfortunately I don\u2019t have exact measurements, you get a feel for it over time which is part of the fun imo as you can customize. \n\n1. Slice up onion (like a quarter of an onion if using the large hunt size). I make moon sliver shapes. \n\n2. In a pot, pour some olive oil. Medium heat. \n\n3. Put your onions in there and sweat them for a few min. Also add some butter (idk like half a tablespoon)\n\n4. Once onions are saut\u00e9ed, pour in the tomato sauce. Next, take your tomato sauce can and \u201crinse\u201d it with a bit of fresh water to get all the sauce stuck on the bottom and the sides. NOT a full can of water, just rinse it. Pour this tomatoey water into the pot as well. This effects consistency of the sauce later so def do it\n\n5. Turn heat to around 8 or so (out of 10)\n\n6. Put in your fresh basil leaves. If you want a little cracked red pepper, add it now. \n\n7. Allow the sauce to start bubbling. Once you see bubbling, give it a good stir and turn heat down to like 4. \n\n8. Stir every few min or so. Adjust heat as needed (if top layer of sauce is cooking super fast and tons of bubbling, turn it down, as an example) \n\n9. Now just do this for a bit to let it cook. Just remember to stir every few min. Overtime, the sauce will go from super liquid to a bit \u201cthicker.\u201d Usually like 20-30 min depending on your heat and quantity. \n\n10. Once it\u2019s the consistency you like, turn your heat to low. Now add your salt and pepper. Taste as you add until you achieve the taste you want. Hint - more salt/pepper than a lot of people realize. \n\nYay you\u2019re done. You can make any kind of Italian pasta with this. We recommend to top pasta with pecorino cheese. \n\nGoes great on three cheese Buitoni tortellini (if you do this, don\u2019t add pecorino on top)\n\nYou can also use this with zucchini for another classic Italian recipe. \n\nUsing this as base for pink sauce? Just mix with heavy cream or half and half. More red pepper if you\u2019d like too. \n\n\nDo you need garlic, oregano, tomato paste, etc? Noooooope.

{"title": "Tagliatelle Bolognese", "selftext": "This is based on [Gennaro Contaldo\u2019s Tagliatelle Bolognese](https://youtu.be/qdZEhkJcJe4) and produced a dish I would rate as \u2018f\u2014ing delicious\u2019 my highest rating. The lowest part of my highest rating. I do not reproduce things exactly, instead I get a general impression and then make things in a way I am comfortable with using ingredients I have on hand. In particular I used store bought flavored tomato pasta sauce and beef stock. I believe that those alone do not make a dish and so there is some technique depicted here and that those also prevent the dish from needing to simmer for an hour to develop flavor.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 2 Cups Tagliatelle (or Spaghetti, Linguine, Penne or etc.)\n* 2 Cups Tomato Pasta Sauce (or 2 Tbsp Tomato paste)\n* 4 Cups Beef Stock (or Water)\n* 0.25 Pounds Ground Beef\n* 1 Cup Mushrooms\n* 1.5 Teaspoon Butter\n* 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil\n* 2 Tablespoons Parsley\n* 2 Tablespoons Cheese (Parmesan, Romano)\n* 1 Teaspoon Italian Seasoning (Marjoram, Rosemary, Thyme, Savory, Sage, Oregano, Basil)\n* 1 Teaspoon Red Pepper Chili Flakes (or Cayenne, Paprika, Chili, etc.)\n* 1/2 Teaspoon Garlic Powder\n* 1/2 Teaspoon Cumin\n* 1/4 Teaspoon Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Teaspoon Salt\n\n#Instructions\n\n1. Bring the Beef Stock to a boil and add rinsed Tagliatelle pasta. Boil for 4 minutes or as instructed. Pasta should be \u2018almost done\u2019. I use the Beef Stock here to simplify the steps. Set aside.\n\n2. Mix Mushrooms with Italian Seasoning, Garlic Powder, 1/2 of the Salt and Black Pepper, and Olive Oil, and stir fry the Mushrooms at 300^o until they give up their water, at 1 minute intervals to produce caramelization. Approximately 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\n3. Mix ground beef with Cumin, Salt, Pepper, and Red Pepper Chili flakes, and stir fry at 300^o until browned at 2 minute intervals to produce caramelization. Approximately 6 minutes. Set aside.\n\n4. Bring 1/2 Cup of Beef Broth (from pasta water) to a boil and reduce halfway until it becomes nearly a syrup. Add Tomato Sauce. Mixture should be \u2018too runny\u2019 but not watery and need to be boiled down to make a sauce. If it is watery boil it down vigorously. If it is done too soon add more Beef Stock because it\u2019s important to boil it down to develop flavor.\n\n5. Add mushrooms and ground beef and continue boiling down more gently. Here you can get the sauce perfect because at this stage the sauce can be simmered for a long time to reduce.\n\n6. When sauce is essentially done add 1/2 of the cheese. Add parsley, and butter. Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper as desired.\n\n7. Add pasta, toss together and continue boiling down if necessary until pasta is fully cooked and sauce reaches desired consistency.\n\n8. Serve on a plate with remaining cheese.\n\nEnjoy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10km1lq/tagliatelle_bolognese/", "created_utc": 1674609114.0, "score": 66, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10km1lq/tagliatelle_bolognese/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Easy mushroom rice pilaf for leftover cooked rice.", "selftext": "This recipe is great if you want to zip up some plain leftover rice you have. The place where we order Asian food from throws in a large container of white rice no matter what we get, and we often don't eat much of it with the meal.  One good thing about this recipe is that it can revitalize older cooked rice that's drying out a bit, as well. I've made it with nine-day-old leftover rice that was in a carton and not truly sealed, and it was great.\n\nThis recipe is for each cup of cooked rice you have.  Each cup serves about 2 to 3 people as a side dish.  You can easily scale the recipe for how much rice you have, for instance, simply doubling everything for two cups of rice.  \n\nIncluding prep, this takes about 18-20 minutes.\n\n#For each cup of *cooked* white or brown rice you need:\n\n* 1 Tbsp (a healthy Tbsp) of butter\n* 1 shallot, chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 4 oz mushrooms of your choice, sliced (I usually coarsely chop them instead)\n* 1/2 tsp dried thyme\n* 1/2 tsp kosher salt\n* 1/4 Cup chicken stock/broth\n\n#Directions\n\n1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.\n2. Add shallot and garlic and cook until the shallot is soft, about 3 minutes.\n3.

Add the rice, and cook while stirring until heated through, about 2 more minutes.\n\n#Notes\n\nI prefer a shallot for its flavor but also because it's easier to measure for this recipe.  You can substitute about 1/4 large onion per cup of rice if you prefer.\n\nIf need be, remove from heat and cover the skillet, and this will stay warm while you finish other parts of the meal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10jfbtn/easy_mushroom_rice_pilaf_for_leftover_cooked_rice/", "created_utc": 1674488271.0, "score": 37, "author": "brock_lee", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10jfbtn/easy_mushroom_rice_pilaf_for_leftover_cooked_rice/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Beef Enchiladas Verde (Western Style)", "selftext": "Few things are more satisfying than a delicious Enchilada. Crispy tortilla with crunchy cheese give way to a soft and delectable meat all slathered in a juicy sauce.\n\nUsually served with Pico de Gallo, Avocado, Lime, Sour Cream, or other accoutrements, this recipe shows that you do not need to have a lot of ingredients to make a delicious Enchilada.\n\nAuthentic Mexican Verde Enchilada Sauce, made from fresh Green Chilis has a distinct and wonderful flavor that really cannot be beat, whereas the cheap Green Enchilada Sauce (which is what I used in this recipe) needs a little help to taste good as I will show you.\n\nIngredients:\n\n- Beef (0.5lb Hamburger or 10oz Steak).\n\n- 12oz Verdes Enchiladas Sauce (\u201cGreen\u201d).\n\nEDIT: Apparently American \u201cGorditas\u201d tortillas although pretty good\u2014 These ones were basically like a fattier flour tortilla variety\u2014 are not at all like authentic Mexican Gorditas which are corn and totally different. So it appears to be a potential mis-use of the terminology although quite delicious.

Season with Salt, Pepper, Cumin, Chili, Cayenne, and half of the Garlic. Mix the Hamburger with the spices. Steak leave whole.\n\nFry the Hamburger at 300^o in a little Olive Oil for approximately 6 minutes turning every 2 minutes or until brown and slightly caramelized. Or the steak in Butter and Olive Oil approximately 6 minutes turning at 3 minute intervals. Set aside. TIP: Add a pinch of Garlic and/or Chili just before finished. NOTE: The Steak or Hamburger will be pretty much cooked at this point to ensure it is not under cooked.\n\nHeat Tortillas in Microwave for 1 to 2 minutes at 30 second to 1 minute intervals depending on wattage. This is to get the Tortillas warmed up so they will not be too raw.\n\nWrap the Hamburger, or Steak, in Tortillas and set in a baking dish.\n\nCover in Enchilada Sauce. TIP: Pour the pan juices over the top to retain flavor.\n\nBake in oven at 500^o for 15 Minutes or until crispy and golden brown.\n\nSprinkle a pinch of Garlic, a small handful of Parsley, and cover in Cheese. Return to the oven for 5 minutes. TIP: Spoon sauce back over top before baking for a softer cheese, or leave as is for a crispier cheese.\n\nPacked with flavor you will be surprised it\u2019s just meat in a tortilla with sauce and cheese, and your wallet will thank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/10iwevs/beef_enchiladas_verde_western_style/", "created_utc": 1674426945.0, "score": 8, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/10iwevs/beef_enchiladas_verde_western_style/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chicken thighs simmered in creamy tomato sauce (one pan)", "selftext": "Last evening my wife was working, and that leaves three of us for dinner.  I had three frozen chicken thighs that I did not use for a dish I made a week or so ago (I thawed them of course).  So, I decided to improvise a simmered chicken dish with what I had.  Most of my experiments in simple cooking are not worthy of writing down or sharing, but this one was really good.  It takes a while, but most of that is the simmering, which is when you can get side dishes ready.  Or enjoy a glass of wine, it's up to you.\n\n#Ingredients\n\n* 3 to 5 chicken thighs (I use skin-on, but skinless boneless is fine, just not as flavorful without the skin and fat)\n* 1 Can condensed Cream of Mushroom soup (or Cream of Chicken)\n* 1 Can (14 oz) diced tomatoes, drained, any variety you like (plain, Italian, fire roasted)\n* salt and pepper\n* 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n* 1/2 tsp oregano\n* 1 Tbsp cooking oil (I prefer canola when searing)\n* 1/4 tsp chili flakes for a little zing (optional)\n* 1 Cup sliced fresh mushrooms (optional)\n\n(This may look like a lot of steps, but the basic steps are sear the meat for 8-10 minutes, make sauce with soup and tomatoes, simmer for 30-35 minutes.)\n\n# Instructions\n \n1. Bring 1 Tbsp oil to medium-high heat in a large, deep skillet.\n2. Salt and pepper both sides of chicken to taste\n3. Sear the chicken for about 4 minutes per side, and remove from pan, set aside on a plate\n4. Adding a little more oil if needed, saute mushrooms (if using) for a few minutes until they release their water\n5. Empty cans of soup and tomatoes, and the spices, into the skillet over the mushrooms, stir well, and bring to a simmer\n6. Reduce heat to medium-low\n7. Add chicken to the sauce, skin side down, spoon some of the sauce over the thighs.\n8. Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.  Be sure this is a medium-low simmer.\n9. Remove cover, turn thighs over, spoon sauce over thighs again.\n10. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  Time is not super critical, so they can simmer a little longer if you're waiting on a side dish.\n\nTo serve, arrange chicken on plates, spoon sauce over. \n\n\n#Notes:\n\n* Italian Seasoning can be substituted for oregano and garlic if you want.\n\n* For my sides, while the chicken was simmering, I made steak-cut french fries in an air fryer and heated up a can of spinach.  This chicken and sauce would go GREAT with mashed potatoes, rice, or even over pasta, plus any green side you like.\n\n* I got both the cans of soup and tomatoes on sale for $1 each, so not only is this easy, it was inexpensive.\n\n* Hopefully you are familiar with your stove-top.  I have found that when many recipes call for \"saute on medium-high\", I need to use just medium on my stove.  Likewise, \"simmer at medium-low\" really means \"low\" for me.  Most important here is not to overcook the chicken skin when searing.\n\n* I recommend a nonstick pan for this.  Even with cooking spray and cooking oil, I've had chicken skin stick to my stainless pans before when searing, and this puts me in a bad mood.  \n\n* I only used three thighs, since that's what I had, but there was plenty of sauce for two more (maybe even three).  I usually can't fit six thighs into my largest pan, though.\n\n* While eating this, the sauce reminded me very much of the sauce on a breakfast skillet I used to get at a restaurant near here.  So, today for breakfast, I cut up the leftover fries, fried them in oil to crisp them up, then scrambled some eggs, and spooned some of he leftover sauce over the eggs in the pan stirring until everything was heated through.  It was just a wonderful hearty breakfast.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/zms8vs/chicken_thighs_simmered_in_creamy_tomato_sauce/", "created_utc": 1671128878.0, "score": 95, "author": "brock_lee", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/zms8vs/chicken_thighs_simmered_in_creamy_tomato_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

Soak at room temperature for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse well.\n2. Place the beans in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Skim any foam off the top, then add the shallots, garlic, fennel, salt, lots of freshly ground black pepper, and the kombu, if using.\n3. Continue simmering until tender, up to 2 more hours, stirring occasionally. The timing will depend on the type and freshness of your beans (older beans will take longer than fresher beans). Add more water to the pot, as needed, as it starts to evaporate.\n4. When the beans are tender, remove the garlic, fennel stalks, and kombu. Discard the garlic papers. Use the back of a knife to mash the soft garlic cloves into a paste, then return it to the pot.\n5. Stir in the olive oil and lemon juice, and season to taste. I like to add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon more salt, more pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.\n6. Add the chard leaves and cook until the chard is just wilted. Season to taste and serve in bowls with drizzles of olive oil and crusty bread. Sprinkle with parsley.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/z95h5r/cannellini_beans_and_greens/", "created_utc": 1669847242.0, "score": 63, "author": "bob-the-cook", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/z95h5r/cannellini_beans_and_greens/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Bangers and Smash w/ delicious Onion Banger Sauce", "selftext": "Bangers and Smash w/ Onion Gravy\n\nBangers in this classic dish are sausages so named because sausages of old had fillers that caused them to burst when they were done cooking, but they are really just regular Italian or German style sausages.\n\nSmash in this dish refers to the cooking method of potato. A \u201csmashed potato\u201d is a crispy potato medallions that are stacked after cooking and then smashed vertically to make a crispy version of a mashed like potato with a baked potato like consistency and are easier and in some ways better and more flavorful than mashed potatoes.\n\nAnd these smashers are so well.\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 Bangers (Sweet Italian, Bratwurst, or Spicy Italian, etc.)\n1/2 Onion.\n1 Large Russet Potato or 5 Yukon Gold or other small potatoes.\nCumin, Chili, Paprika, Cayenne, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, depending on whether bangers are already spicy or not, and whether banger grease will be used to flavor the banger gravy.\nItalian Seasoning & Onion Powder (for onions).\nThyme, Chili, Paprika for Smashed Potatoes.\nSalt & Black Pepper\nWorcester Shire Sauce\nBeef Broth, or Beef Stock, or Milk, or 1:1 Evaporated Milk & Water (if you don\u2019t have Beef Broth or want to make a country gravy instead of a more proper banger sauce).\nOlive Oil.\n\nPrep:\n\nPotatoes: Scrub, Peel, and cut in half short-wise and then each half in half again making medallions and caps. Cut each in half again, and then again if desired to shorten cooking time. Toss potatoes in 1/2 Tbsp Thyme, 1/3 Tsp Chili, 1/3 Tsp Salt, 1/3 Tsp Black Pepper, 1 Tsp Paprika (optional), 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil.\n\nBangers:\n\nOptionally coat bland bangers in spices. Sweet Italian in 1/2 Tbsp Paprika. Bratwurst in 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder. Hot Italian in 1 Tsp Italian Seasoning. Depending on which banger variety is used. Pre-bake if health conscious to remove some grease.\n\nOnion:\n\nSlice 1/2 Onion into strips. Optionally mince stubborn portions that won\u2019t go into to strips. Toss in 1/2 Tsp Italian Seasoning, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder, 1/3 Tsp Salt, 1/3 Tsp Black Pepper.\n\nCook:\n\nPan fry onions until just soft. Mild color is okay. Do not burn. Pour excess grease out, or, add banger grease or butter until 2 Tbsp flour can be used to soak up all the fat. The amount of flour necessary to soak up the fat will determine how much gravy will be made so it is not too unhealthy.\nOnce the flour is cooked, and before it turns brown, pour in 1/8 Cup Beef Stock or Beef Broth and stir. Milk or 1 to 1 Evaporated Milk and Water can be used to make a country gravy instead of a proper banger sauce. Keep it thick, pour in more Beef Stock (or Milk) until the desired amount of gravy is produced.\nAdd 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder, 1/2 Tsp Onion Powder, 1/3 Tsp Cumin, 1/3 Tsp Chili, 1/3 Tsp Paprika, 1/5 Tsp Cayenne Pepper as desired particularly if the banger grease was not used, or if the bangers are a bland variety. Pour in 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce.\nIt is better to make a more flavorful gravy and then need to dilute it with Beef Broth (or milk) than to make a too bland gravy and then need to dump in Black Pepper at the end until it livens up, but, Black Pepper can be added at the end until it livens up.\nPut bangers in the sauce as it starts to thicken and bubble until it thickens.\n\nGravy is done when scraping the spoon leaves a clean trace because gravy is thick enough.\n\nNOTE: If the potatoes are not cooked in one go to begin with they will dry out and then never taste cooked no matter how often you take them out and back into the oven so it is best to blast them for sufficient duration approximately 20-25 minutes and until they are golden brown.\n\nServe:\n\nBangers slathered in delicious onions and banger sauce.\nPotatoes stacked and smashed once vertically.\n1/4 Tsp extra salt on potatoes (if necessary)\n1/4 Tsp extra pepper on gravy (if necessary).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/ywct9k/bangers_and_smash_w_delicious_onion_banger_sauce/", "created_utc": 1668554208.0, "score": 75, "author": "_W1T3W1N3_", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/ywct9k/bangers_and_smash_w_delicious_onion_banger_sauce/", "html_title": ""}

Get them all separated as best you can.\n\nPut them out on a baking sheet and try to pat them dry as much as possible.

First dice the tomatoes and put them in a bowl. Cut the cucumber into slices cut in half and add it to the tomatoes. Cut the pepper into small strips and add it to the bowl. Cut the onion into small strips as in the photo and add it to the rest of the cut vegetables. Cut the parsley, add to the bowl, salt, pour olive oil and mix.  \n\n\nGrate the white cheese directly into the bowl that already contains the vegetables. Add the olives and serve like this. We can mix directly before putting in smaller dishes. We can serve as a salad with the second course. In the recipe I did not mention the amount of oil, salt, vinegar or olives to add, because we add these products to our liking.  \n\n\nAs a curiosity I would like to add that in Bulgaria, many times this and many salads are served before the main course or dinner with a glass of rakia. Maybe explain to the uninitiated that rakia is Bulgarian homemade alcohol similar to hard liquor (very good), which is made from fruits such as grapes or plums.

Make the Korean jeon dipping sauce by mixing 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp gochujang, 1 chopped scallion, and 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds. \n2. Prepare the batter by whisking 1 egg in a stainless-steel pan. Season with salt and gradually add \u00be cup flour (115g) flour while whisking. \n3. Slowly pour in 1 cup (240ml) water while continuing to whisk. Don\u2019t worry if there are small lumps in the batter- this is normal. \n4. Take 8-10 napa cabbage leaves and gently snap the stem to flatten. Wash and shake until damp.\n5. Dredge two leaves on a large plate with \u00bc-\u00bd cup flour added. Dip flour-coated leaves in jeon batter and completely coat. \n6. On high heat, pour 2 tbsp oil (or more) into a non-stick pan. Once the oil is hot enough, use tongs to transfer cabbage leaves to pan, ensuring excess batter drips off. Pan-fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp.  Serve this first batch straight away with dipping sauce. \n7. Repeat Step 5-6 until batter has been used up.

This dish is essentially an Italian shakshuka, with eggs poached in a rich tomato sauce, best enjoyed with a few slices of a good quality bread!\n\nIn this video, I show you how to make eggs in purgatory on the stove, but I also mention how you can make this dish in the oven! I've been eating Eggs in purgatory for years; it's my go-to quick dish! I know you're going to love it, so give it a go!\n\n**If you're a visual learner, feel free to watch my recipe video here!** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTfqvA5mt24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTfqvA5mt24)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 eggs\n* 4 garlic cloves (2 for the toast!)\n* 1 tin of tomatoes\n* 1/4 white onion, chopped into cubes\n* 1 tbsp. thyme (or oregano)\n* 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar\n* approx. 100g mozzarella cheese, grated or cubed\n* a good squeeze of tomato paste\n* a few pinches of salt\n* olive oil, for cooking\n* good quality bread, for dipping!\n\n**Serves: 2 people**\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Peel and thinly slice 2 cloves of garlic. Place a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat and add in a few tablespoons of olive oil. Once your oil has started to sizzle, add in one quarter of a white onion, chopped into cubes. As soon as the onions begin browning, add in your sliced garlic.\n2. Add in 1 tbsp. dried thyme. I normally add oregano rather than thyme, but unfortunately I ran out of oregano \u2013 and my local supermarket was out of stock too!\n3. Once both the onions and garlic are picking up colour, add in 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar and a good squeeze (a couple of tablespoons) of tomato paste. Give this a good stir until the paste breaks down into the onions.\n4. Add in 1 can of tomatoes. You can use any canned tomato, but I\u2019m using chopped/diced tomatoes. I also like to add in 1/3 of the can of water, just to loosen up the sauce!\n5. Set your pan to medium-low heat, cover your pan with a lid (if possible) and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.\n6. Add a few pinches of salt and taste your sauce to ensure it\u2019s seasoned to your liking! Feel free to add black pepper if you wish! Let it cook with the lid off for just a few more minutes.\n7. Turn the heat back up to medium and drop in 4 eggs - and maybe not traditional, but I love to add in 100g mozzarella cheese, grated or cubed!\n8. Pop your lid back on and cook until your eggs are done to your preference. Mine took around 10-15 minutes on an electric stove, but if you\u2019re using gas, your cooking time will reduce.\n9. Let\u2019s toast up our bread! Place a frying pan on medium-high heat and drizzle in some olive oil. Place your bread into your pan and swish them around, allowing them to soak up some of that oil. Once they\u2019re nicely toasted, flip and toast the other side.\n10. Once done, pull your toast out and rub a peeled garlic clove across the top of your bread!

{"title": "A Sunday Morning Favorite - Avocado Egg Boat!", "selftext": "This breakfast idea takes a little bit of time, but the taste is worth it. Here's what you'll need:\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n1. Avocado - halved and peeled\n2. Two Eggs - (yolk and white separated)\n3. Shredded sharp cheddar cheese (about 2 TBSP per boat)\n4. Garlic Powder\n\n***OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS***\n\nYou can do so many things with this dish - We've sliced cherry tomatoes to put in the bottom, Put salsa in the bottom; sliced garlic; whatever floats your tastes buds. We've even cut a tortilla the size of the ramekin and laid it on top like a 'pot-pie'. Whatever you want to try just add to the bottom before you put the avocado in.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n**1.** Set oven to 425 degrees\n\n2. Spray the inside of two ramekins with a non-stick spray (I use olive oil) - this keeps the melted cheese from sticking to it and makes for easier clean up)\n\n3. In the bottom of the ramekin, add your additional items. Try it with your favorite salsa - simply put enough in the bottom to cover it. Or, slice 4 cherry tomatoes and place them around the outer edge of the bottom (sliced garlic also tastes great)\n\n4. Slice your avocado in half and remove the seed. A tip I learned on pealing them is to lay the avocado flat and slice a bit off the tip and bottom where it's rounded, then simply peel the skin off..\n\n5. Place avocado cut side up to see the pit hole.\n\n6. Separate the egg yolk from the white and gently lay in the pit hole (You don't want the yolk to break).  Then pour the whites along the outer edge of the ramekin to let the white fill in around avocado\n\n7. Add your seasoning - I love garlic powder so I'll sprinkle some on the avocado and egg yolk8. Take about 1 to 2 TPSP of shredded cheese and lay over the top of the egg and avocado being careful with the yolk.\n\nPlace both on a baking dish and put in oven for about 13 minutes (I've found on my oven, that two of these at 13 minutes gets the whites cooked while still keeping yolk soft. One Egg Boat - adjust time down to 12 minutes. If you do more than 2 at a time, you will probably need to adjust your time up.\n\nRemove from oven and garnish with whatever you have.. cilantro, parsley, another cherry tomato..Eat hot with a knife and fork - as you cut into it, the yellow yolk will cover the avocado - combining avocado, cheese, eggs and your extras into a great bite of healthy goodness!\n\nHere's a few photos:  \n[Avocado Egg Boat](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lr26yl8stumlxd0/avocado%20egg%20boat.jpeg?dl=0)\n\n[Avocado Egg Boat 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtvgql107k1g83m/Avocado%20Egg%20Boat%202.jpeg?dl=0)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/xceo40/a_sunday_morning_favorite_avocado_egg_boat/", "created_utc": 1662993866.0, "score": 35, "author": "rjfkgf", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/xceo40/a_sunday_morning_favorite_avocado_egg_boat/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Easy and tasty Indian potato-cashew-curry recipe and Naan bread", "selftext": "Today I want to share an amazing Indian potato and cashew curry recipe and the accommodating naan recipe as well. The recipe is easy but requires some specific spices. \n\nServes about 4 people and takes about 45 minutes.\n\nI also made a [Video](https://youtu.be/vjWvnCBM-54) if you like a visual comparison or guide. \n\nI\u00b4ll split the recipe into 2 parts the curry and the naan. \n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the curry\n\n4 medium sized potatoes\n\n1 large onion\n\n200ml of milk / a cup\n\n125gramms of cr\u00e8me fraiche / half a cup\n\n2 tablespoons of unseasoned cashew nuts\n\n1 teaspoon of chili powder\n\n2 teaspoons o smoked paprika\n\n3/4 of a teaspoon of ground coriander and cumin\n\n2 teaspoons of garam Masala\n\n1 teaspoon of salt\n\nA clove of garlic can be subsidized 1 teaspoon of garlic\n\nA piece of ginger can be subsidized1 teaspoon ginger powder\n\nFirst we got to cook the potatoes so we wash them to get rid of any remaining dirt and then put them into a pot without water, then we fill the pot until the potatoes are submerged in the water after the pot is filled with water we can put it onto the stove at high to medium heat at the beginning which you can turn down once the water is boiling.\n\nBefore we proceed with the onion we can add together all the spices we need later in a small bowl. Mix the chili powder, the smoked paprika, the coriander, the cumin, the garam masala, the salt, and if you chose garlic and ginger powder than those as well. \n\nOnce we took care of the spices we can start with the onion. First we cut away the opposite side of the root and then we halve the onion. Now we got to remove the most other shell of both onion halves. Now we can cut the halves vertically 5-6 times towards the root and then 1 more cut horizontally. Make sure to not cut into the root of the onion to keep the stability that the root provides. Now slice the onion really thin. \n\nAfter we\u00b4ve cut the onion we can put another pot onto the stove in which we will make the curry. Add some vegetable oil to the pot and set the plate to medium heat. Once the oil is hot add the onions to the pot and let them get glassy. \n\nIn the meantime, if you chose to use a garlic clove and a ginger piece. Remove the shell of the clove and cut it into small bits. Peel the ginger and cut it up as well. Otherwise proceed straight with crushing and chopping the cashew nuts. Once crushed add them to the spice bowl. \n\nWhen the onion turns glassy we can add the spices, the crushed cashews and the garlic and ginger. Let it fry for a short while as you constantly stir it, so the spices don\u2019t get burned. Now add half of the milk, let it boil and simmer for a short while. If you want a homogenous curry you can blend everything in the pot now, with a hand blender, but be very very careful there is a high risk of splatter. Whatever you chose after that we can add the cr\u00e8me fraiche and the rest of the milk while constantly stirring. Bring it to a boil and then let is simmer on low heat.\n\nLastly we got to take care of the boiled potatoes. You can check those by piercing them with a fork or any other spikey utensil if they have almost no resistance while piercing they are done. Take the pot of the stove and drain the water. Now we can wait a little bit to let the potatoes cool. Add them to the curry or pour the curry over them on the plate. your choice. and with that we are finished with the curry. enjoy. \n\nNow onwards to the naan bread. \n\nIngredients:\n\n150 grams of flour / \u00be of a cup \n\nhalf a teaspoon of baking soda\n\nhalf a teaspoon of sugar \n\nhalf a teaspoon of salt \n\n50ml of milk / \u00bc of a cup\n\n3 tablespoons of butter or 25grams / an ounce\n\n65 grams of yogurt / \u00bc of a cup\n\nFirst we got to mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl, the flour, the baking soda, the sugar, and the salt. After that we got to melt the butter you can do that in a microwave but be sure to cut the piece of butter into small bits, so they don\u2019t pop while they get heated. We let the butter cool and add it to a separate bowl with the milk and the yogurt once added we got to mix them together. After that we can add them to the dry ingredients. Once everything is in one bowl we must mix it and knead it thoroughly until we get a nice homogenous clump of dough. Let the dough rest for at least half an hour underneath the bowl. \n\nAfter the dough is finished with resting we can sever it into 4 equally sized pieces. Those pieces we got to roll out thin about 2 mm thick we strive to achieve a round shape for the pan. Put a suitable sized pan on the stove at medium heat and add some butter or vegetable oil try to spread it before adding the rolled-out dough. Once the dough is added we just got to wait until there are bubble rising on the surface of the dough. than flip it around and give it about the same time. once both sides are partially browned the naan is finished and we can enjoy a really nice Indian curry and homemade naan bread. Enjoy.\n\nTime Calculations\n\n30minutes naan rising / 25-30 minutes potato boiling\n\nCan be done in the meantime.\n\nCutting the onion 3min \n\nMixing the spices 1min\n\nFrying the onion 3min / crushing the cashew nuts\n\nBoiling and simmering 10min 1. time 3min 2.

[Video](https://youtu.be/gPWTQ8zZWxM)\n\nFor the ingredients we need \n\n1 pound of soup meat beef you can use 2 pounds if you want it more meaty \n\n3 bell peppers \n\n2 large onions \n\n2 carrots \n\n2 stems of celery \n\n2 cloves of garlic \n\na bottle of wine \n\n2 tablespoons of tomato paste \n\n250ml /1 cup of beef broth \n\n1 tablespoon of Salt \n\n1 tablespoon of ground black pepper \n\n1 tablespoon of smoke paprika\n\n1 tablespoon cayenne pepper for heat \n\nHalf the onions, remove opposite side of the root and then remove the most outer shell. After that cut the onion halves with your knife towards the root 3-4 times and then once more horizontal cut towards the root of the onion. Make sure that you do not cut the root or you\u00b4ll lose the stability. Now we can chop up the onion into large chunks and put them aside.\n\nafter that chop up the garlic cloves into small pieces, we can crush the cloves with the broadside of the knife to remove the shell more easily. chop of the ends, halve the cloves and start to slice them along the long side. After that chop the garlic slices into small pieces and add them to the bowl with the onion chunks.\n\nonce we are done with the garlic we can put a pot onto the stove at medium to high heat and add some vegetable oil. While the oil in the pot heats up we can start to slice the meat into chunks.\n\nI like to cut away some of the harder meat parts but in theory you don\u2019t need to because the stew will boil for a long time which will make the meat tender. We cut the soup meat into thump size pieces. While we do that we need to keep in mind the oil in the pot.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough we can add the onion chunks and the garlic bits. Stir them thoroughly so they don\u2019t burn immediately. After the onions turned glassy add the tomato paste and the smoked paprika and stir it as well. Do not let the tomato paste get burned just a little bit heated.\n\nNow we need to open the wine bottle and deglaze the onion garlic tomato paste mix with about 350ml or 1 and half cup of wine and stir it a bit. Add about 250ml or a cup of beef stock to the goulash as well. After we added the wine and the stock we can add the meat.\n\nI cleaned the chopping board and the knife after I chopped the meat which is just a safety precaution. I don\u2019t like to work on surfaces that came in contact with raw meat.\n\nOnce the meat is added we can start with the carrots and the celery, peel the carrots, and chop them into disks, wash the celery stems and then chop them into equally thick pieces as the carrots. add both the carrots and the celery stem pieces to the goulash.\n\nAfter that we need to add the spices before simmering. Add about a tablespoon of salt, a tablespoon of ground black pepper and a tablespoon of cayenne pepper.\n\nNow the goulash must simmer for about 2 hours. We can leave the lid a little bit open so some of the moisture can escape and the goulash thickens. While the goulash is simmering we can chop up the bell pepper.\n\nChop of the head and remove the core than remove the inner white parts. Chop of the bottom as well and cut all the bell pepper pieces into slices about half a centimeter or a quarter inch thick and put them aside. The bell pepper gets added about 20-30 minutes before the goulash is finished. this will let the bell pepper stay a bit firmer once we serve the goulash.\n\nWe can Test the meat inside the goulash by squishing it with something blunt if we are able to tear it apart the goulash is finished, and you can enjoy a hearty meat stew.

{"title": "Chocolate Depression Cake - No Milk, No Butter, No Eggs! Vegan Friendly!", "selftext": "Chocolate Depression Cake was developed during the Great Depression when ingredients were scarce and money was tight. In 2022, with living costs at an all time high, this is the chocolate cake we all need! This depression cake is so chocolatey, you won't believe it has no eggs, no milk and no butter in it! Even the chocolate icing is dairy free and vegan friendly!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here, which includes a few additional tips! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGH2ZRPBtCw)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Chocolate Cake**\n\n* 180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour\n* 198g (1 cup) granulated sugar\n* 6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda)\n* 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\n* 40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder\n* 80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil)\n* 15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or other light vinegar such as white vinegar or rice vinegar)\n* 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\n* 236ml (1 cup) water\n\n**Chocolate Icing**\n\n* 170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar)\n* 30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder\n* 45ml (3 tbsp.) water\n* 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract\n\n\\-----\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F and line an 8\u201d square pan with parchment paper. \n\n2. To a mixing bowl add 180g (1 1/2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour, 198g (1 cup) granulated sugar, 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt, 6g (1 tsp.) baking soda (or bicarbonate soda) and 40g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder. Whisk this together until thoroughly combined and the mixture is uniform in colour.\n\n3. To 236ml (1 cup) water add 15ml (1 tbsp.) apple cider vinegar (or alternative light vinegar) and 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract. Just give that a little stir!\n\n4. Add your water-vinegar liquid to the dry ingredients, along with 80ml (1/3 cup) vegetable oil (or other neutral cooking oil). **Mix this quickly.** You want to get this batter into the oven as fast as possible in order to achieve the best rise! A few lumps in the batter is fine, but try to get as much of the flour mixture combined as possible.\n\n5. Pour your deliciously chocolate cake batter into your prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes.\n\n6. Now onto the vegan chocolate icing! To a mixing bowl add 170g (1 1/2 cups) icing sugar (also known as powdered sugar) and 30g (1/4 cup) cocoa powder. Mix these ingredients together and then add 5ml (1 tsp.) vanilla extract.\n\n7. Add in water, one tablespoon at a time. I used 45ml (3 tbsp.) for the perfect consistency. Your icing should be thick enough to remain on your cake, but thin enough to spread easily.\n\n8. Remove your cake from the oven, let it cool to room temperature, spread your chocolate icing over the top and let the icing set. If you want to dress your cake up, feel free to add sprinkles, chocolate shavings or your favourite candy on top!\n\n9. Cut into equal squares with a sharp knife \u2013 and serve!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is one of the best vegan chocolate cakes I've ever baked. It's rich, chocolatey and really moist! It's also great a few days after baking and surprisingly, remains moist! I gave a few squares of this cake to my friends and none of them could tell it was a vegan recipe. Honestly, if you love chocolate cake, give this recipe a go!!\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask below! \n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/x4qid1/chocolate_depression_cake_no_milk_no_butter_no/", "created_utc": 1662198252.0, "score": 241, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/x4qid1/chocolate_depression_cake_no_milk_no_butter_no/", "html_title": ""}

It gives a very well rounded herbal flavor. \n\nFor this spice blend you only need 4 ingredients\u2026so it is super simple to make. \n\nIngredients to make it ( makes 2 \u00bd tablespoons ) \n\nThyme - 2 tbsp\n\nSesame seeds - 1 \u00bd tsp\n\nSumac - 1 tsp\n\nTable salt - pinch  \n\n* Collect all the spices. \n* I highly recommend toasting whole and ground spices to release aromatic oils. Plus, toasting spices dries them out a bit, which makes them easier to grind. Toast spices on the skillet for a few minutes until you start feeling an aromatic flavor.\n* Cool them down and then transfer spices to a spice grinder or a coffee grinder to finely ground. All done, our Za\u2019atar mix is ready! \n\nHow to use Za\u2019atar: \n\n* Sprinkle it over eggs \n* Combine with olive oil to make a paste to bake on top of the bread\n* It also goes well with roasted potatoes or fries \n* You can even combine it with breading \n\n**Ok, now let\u2019s make Harissa paste:**\n\nHarissa paste is a North African chili paste or a hot sauce ( if you want, you can make it a little or a very spicy ) \n\nIngredients ( makes 1 cup ) \n\nExtra-virgin olive oil - \u00bd cup\n\nGarlic cloves - 6 pcs\n\nLemon juice - 2 tbsp ( half a lemon ) \n\nPaprika ( sweet or smokey ) - 2 tbsp \n\nMix of Aleppo & Chili peppers - 3-4 dried peppers ( or 2 \u00bd tbsp of dried red pepper ) \n\nSweet red bell pepper ( roasted ) - 1 pcs\n\nTomato paste - 2 tbsp\n\nCoriander - 2 tbsp\n\nCumin - 2 tsp\n\nTable salt - 1 tsp \n\n* Roast bell pepper in the oven for 20 min at 400\u00b0F\n* Rehydrate dried peppers. Put them in hot water under the lid for 30 minutes. Remove seeds if you want less spicy paste. If you want more heat, keep some seeds in. \n* Peel garlic.\n* Toast cumin and coriander to enhance flavor. When cooled down, finely crush them in the spice grinder. \n\nCooking tip: If you don\u2019t have a spice grinder or coffee grinder, use manual methods such as mortar and pestle, rolling pin or bottom of the skillet against the wooden board. Manual method works well for small amounts of spices.  \n\n* Now, mix all ingredients in the food processor until it becomes a paste. Stream in oil in the process. Now, taste it to see if it needs more salt. \n\nHow to use Harissa: \n\nUse with chicken, vegetables, meat or fish. Also, it works great as a marinade.  Eat with bread and olive oil. You can add it to shakshuka and pretty much use it as a hot sauce. \n\n**Last, but not least Garam Masala spice blend**\n\nGaram masala is a spice blend widely used in Indian cuisine, from curries and lentil dishes to soups. Also, Garam Masala makes a great seasoning for meat. \n\nIngredients ( makes 3 \u00bd  tbsp )\n\nBlack peppercorns - 1 tbsp\n\nCoriander seeds - 2 \u00bd tsp\n\nCardamom pods - 1 \u00bd tsp \n\nCumin seeds - 1tsp \n\nCinnamon stick - 3 inch \n\nBay leaves - 2 pcs\n\nStar anise pods - 6pcs \n\n* Collect all spices \n* Toast spices on the skillet to bring out the flavor \n* Process all ingredients in the spice grinder for 20-30 seconds until finely groud\n\nAll done, your spice mix is ready! \n\nAdd this spice mix at the end of the cooking process to add more amazing flavor and aroma to your dish!\n\nAnd final cooking tip for today: \n\nSprinkle food with seasoning from about a foot hight above the dish.....it makes seasoning distribute more evenly and as result your dish will taste better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wxqfxh/how_to_make_your_own_spice_mix_or_paste_3_easy/", "created_utc": 1661463817.0, "score": 29, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wxqfxh/how_to_make_your_own_spice_mix_or_paste_3_easy/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Thinnest pizza out there.", "selftext": "Okay, this one takes a little more time but is really easy. \n\nThis recipe is for the thinnest pizza dough you can make.\n\nI also made a video explaining every step. [Video](https://youtu.be/MSPr7DJBniw) (recipe starts at 0:08 and ends at about 7:41)\n\nEstimated time: 2-8 Hours for the dough to rise after that about 30-40min, serving 4 people.\n\nDough Mix\n\n250 gram flour \n\n1 tea spoon sugar\n\n1 tea spoon salt\n\n1 tea spoon yeast\n\n2 table spoons of olive oil \n\nand about 130-150 ml water (room temperature)\n\nSauce \n\npureed Tomatoes / caned tomatoes \n\n1 teaspoon of salt \n\ndried oregano, basil, rosemary, savory and thyme (only dried basil valid as well) \n\nCheese \n\n320g young gouda, 80g for each pizza\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis amounts to 4 really thin medium pizzas originally the amount was meant for 2 large pizzas. \n\nAfter mixing everything I\u00b4ll let the dough get knead by a kneading machine but you can mix by hand as well. Make sure when you mix the dough by hand to knead it thoroughly and fold the dough upon itself. After about 5-10 min of kneading with the machine or 10-15 min by hand the dough should be ready to rest. Lightly cover the dough and the bowl with some olive oil this will prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl to much. Than cover the dough with a wet towel and let the it rest for at least 2 hours, 8 hours is the ideal time. You can also split the dough after 2 hours into smaller pieces and let them rise individually, for me that made no significant difference to the result to justify using more dishes. \n\nAfter the dough has risen long enough you just got to make a tomato sauce, choose your toping and get some shredded cheese. \n\nIf you start making the sauce you can turn on your oven best would be maximum heat. For me this is 250\u00b0C but this differs between ovens. A Oven with upper and lower heat would be best but a convection oven is fine. Also Preheat your backing tray. \n\nFor the tomato sauce I used, pureed tomatoes without any additives. You can also use caned tomatoes and puree them yourself. I would advice against premade sauce but this is up you. pour the pureed tomatoes into a bowl, as I bough it in a package I rinse the inside with a little bit of water and shake the package and pour it into the puree as well. To compensate the water in the puree I add about a table spoon of tomato paste. Next I add 1 tablespoon of a mixture of spices that are a specific combination for pizza, consisting of dried oregano, basil, rosemary, savory and thyme. I am not sure how available this mixture of spices is but in my experience adding only 1 table spoon of dried basil to the tomato puree is a valid substitute. Add about 1 tea spoon of salt and mix the sauce. You can add garlic powder and ground black pepper or chili flakes if you want to spice up the sauce. As Cheese I use a young gouda in big slices, I cut them in half twice and than shred it myself. Pre shred cheese sometimes has something added that prevents it from clumping that impacts its melting capabilities. While shredding I make sure to shred the cheese vertical and horizontal to get longer cheese stripes and small bit in a nice proportion to each other. The amount of cheese you wanna use is totally up to you. I like a little less cheese. \n\nNow with everything ready its time to roll out the dough. First put down some backing sheet, add some flour and start to cover the dough piece you want to roll out in flour. I like to start stretching the dough by hand, where I softly pinch it and than stretch it gently and this all around while holding the dough up. Once the dough is bigger than my stretched palm I put it down, now you can use a rolling pin to stretch the dough further and even out the thickness. I sometimes like to use my hands to stretch the dough all the way because it give it a unevenness which has an appeal of its own. Both methods are fine your choice which ever you prefer. Now that the dough is spread add about 3 stable spoons of the tomato sauce spread the sauce on the dough by grabbing the spoon close to the big part and than try to spread the sauce with circular movements and tilt the spoon, tilt it inward to the center of the dough if you want to spread the sauce outwards. Tilt it outwards to the edge of the dough if you want to reduce the amount of sauce near the edge. try to make it as homogenous as possible and than add the toping you want. there are two ways of how to handle the toping. you can either put the toping beneath or above the cheese both methods have its pros and cons. I like it beneath the cheese. If you spread the cheese beyond the pizza onto the backing sheet you can use the backing sheet to get the cheese bits back onto the pizza. \n\nNow comes the most difficult part. I am able to do it alone because I have a lot of experience doing it. I take out the pre heated backing tray and pull the pizza onto it by garbing the backing sheet beneath it. I rest the backing try on the edge of the counter because I know it can withstand the heat of the tray for a couple of seconds. You can take the hot tray out and put it on the stove so you can use both your hand to grab the backing sheet, if you have another Person by your side they can support you as well. Once the pizza is on the tray you can put it back into the oven. For a temperature of 250\u00b0C it takes between 7-8 mins. Always make sure you check upon your pizza. If the cheese looks good to you check if the dough also has become a little brown. If both the cheese and the underside of the dough are to your likening you can take the pizza out. Let it rest for a short while and than cut it. I use a pizza scissors.\n\nAnd finished. Enjoy your thinnest pizza.\n\nThere is no pizza tag =/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wtxg1r/thinnest_pizza_out_there/", "created_utc": 1661081607.0, "score": 6, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wtxg1r/thinnest_pizza_out_there/", "html_title": ""}

Preheat your oven to 200C (400F). De-stone 4 peaches and slice them into wedges. I like to leave the skins on, as this adds a beautiful colour to the dish! Now skin and crush 6 cloves of garlic.  \n\n2. Pat down your chicken thighs (or breasts!) with kitchen roll to remove any moisture and then season generously with salt and black pepper.\n\n3. To a large oven-safe pan, add 60ml (4 tbsp.) olive oil and heat on medium-high. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add your chicken skin side down. Season the other side of the chicken thighs/breasts with a generous pinch of salt and black pepper. Once the skin begins to brown, flip the chicken over \u2013 and when the underneath has also browned, move the thighs/breasts to a clean plate. The chicken will not be cooked through at this stage.\n\n4. Let\u2019s make the sauce! Into the pan we\u2019ve just used, add your crushed garlic to the chicken fat. Let it cook for around 60 seconds before adding 130-160ml (2/3 cup) chicken stock, 30ml (2 tbsp.) runny honey and 120ml (1/2 cup) balsamic vinegar. Let the sauce reduce down by half. \n\n5. Now add in your peaches! Let them cook in the sauce for 5 minutes before adding the chicken. If there\u2019s any chicken juice on the plate, pour that in too! It\u2019s all flavour! Nestle the chicken into the peaches, but be sure the top of the chicken pieces are exposed. \n\n6. Place the pan into your pre-heated oven and cook for 25-30 minutes \u2013 or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165F (74C).\n\n7. For the finishing touch, let\u2019s chiffonade some basil! Take approximately 10 leaves of basil, stack them, roll them into a cigar shape and then finely chop into thin slices. You should be left with strings of basil!\n\n8. As soon as your chicken comes out of the oven, sprinkle on your basil \u2026 and serve!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love the ease and convenience of one pot chicken dishes! A delicious meal followed by less washing up afterwards is always a winner in my book! If you don\u2019t like peaches, be sure to check out my \u2018Marry Me\u2019 chicken recipe, which is very similar to Tuscan chicken. You can find it on my YouTube channel, or here on Reddit! \n\nI hope you love this recipe \u2013 and if you do make it, let me know how you get on!! If you have a picture of your dish, share it with me and I\u2019ll post it on my socials!

{"title": "Battered and fried zucchini", "selftext": "Okay, this one might be a little less easy but still not that hard. \n\nThis recipe is for battered and fried zucchini slices. It\u2019s not that quick but it tastes quite good. Like everything else that is fried. \n\n I also made a video explaining every step.  [Video](https://youtu.be/kmba1SIDyzI) (recipe starts at 1:03 and ends at about 4:35)\n\nEstimated time: 18-24min, serving 2 people.\n\nIngredients: \n\n1 Zucchini\n\n3 Eggs\n\nHalf a cup of Flour\n\n100 grams of Cornstarch / little less than half a cup\n\n2 teaspoons of smoked paprika\n\n1 teaspoon of salt\n\n1 teaspoon of ground black pepper\n\n1 teaspoon of garlic powder\n\n   \n \n\nSlice the zucchini into slices that are about 1-1,5 cm (half an inch) thick.\n\nCrack the eggs and put them into a deep plate where you can whisk them with the smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and garlic. Add the cornstarch to the mix. I would advise you to sieve the starch in, to reduce the number of clumps. Once the batter is prepared you need one more deep plate in which you can pour the Flour. \n\nPut a pan on the stove at medium to high heat and pour some oil in. Not too much you can add more later. \n\nTake the zucchini slices and thoroughly cover them with flour on both sides and then put them into the batter, flip them once and take them out. Hover the slice over the batter to drain the excess batter. Then and the battered slice to the frying pan. About 2-3 min per side but that heavily depends on the thickness of the slices. Once the batter is gold brown on both sides you are finished. Enjoy. \n\nSome Notes: \n\nYou can salt the zucchini slices once cut to reduce the moisture and probably prevent them from becoming overly soggy after frying but you don\u00b4t have to.\n\nYou can add any other spices you want to the batter.\n\nFor adding the corn starch, you could dissolve it in water to avoid clumps but that will make the batter more watery and less thick. \n\nIf the battered slice starts to fry immediately upon putting it into the pan, perfect if not the oil was not hot enough. You can test this with anything wooden. Just hold it into the oil and if there are bubbles forming at the wood the temperature is good. \n\nIf you want a reference on how I made it, I\u2019ll happily share my video with you just DM me. \n\nSlicing zucchini: 3min\n\nmixing the batter: 3min\n\nfrying the zucchini: 12-18 min (depends on the size of zucchini and therefore the number of slices and the size of the pan. 1 Zucchini = 10-15 slices, 5-6 slices fit in a pan. 2-3 min each side. More slices = thinner slices, less slices = thicker slices.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wp37dc/battered_and_fried_zucchini/", "created_utc": 1660579095.0, "score": 72, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wp37dc/battered_and_fried_zucchini/", "html_title": ""}

Slice 500g of smoked bacon into small pieces and drop into a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat.\n2. Finely chop 1 white onion and 6 shallots.\n3. Be sure to stir the bacon occasionally. If there are any large clumps of bacon, break these up with a wooden spoon. Once the bacon has rendered out the majority of it\u2019s fat, remove the bacon pieces from the pan and place onto a dish.\n4. Add your onions and shallots to the saut\u00e9 pan, and grate into 2 cloves of garlic. These will begin to cook in the bacon fat. Continue cooking until the onions become caramelized.\n5. Now add your bacon pieces back into the saut\u00e9 pan! Add 4 dried chilis. I\u2019ve deseeded my chilis, as I\u2019m not keen on heat, but you can leave the seeds in \u2013 or add a few more chilis!\n6. Add a healthy grating of nutmeg, as well as 2 tbsp. maple syrup, and stir thoroughly.\n7. Once the maple syrup has cooked off and there is no liquid visible in your saut\u00e9 pan, add 85g brown sugar,  2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp. bourbon (optional), 1 tbsp. soy sauce and 100ml strong, black coffee.\n8. Lower your heat to medium-low and let the mixture simmer for 20 minutes \u2013 or until the liquid has become thick and syrupy! You can test this by running a wooden spoon through the mixture; the liquid will take a second or two to return to the centre of the pan.\n9. I like to remove my chilis at this stage, but you can leave them in! Remove the saut\u00e9 pan from the heat and let it cool to room temperature.\n10. **Transfer your bacon jam to a jar and refrigerate**. **Your bacon jam will keep for up to a month.** **Enjoy!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you love this bacon jam as much as I do!

To a large saut\u00e9 pan, add \u00bc cup (60ml) olive oil and let it begin to heat. Then add in your garlic and stir for around 20 seconds. Now add in your fish! I\u2019m using sardines in tomato sauce \u2013 and I always like to double check to ensure the sardines have no bones hidden inside!\n\n3. Add in 60g of capers. I like to rinse my capers in a bowl of cold water, just to remove some of the excess saltiness. Next, add in your black olives and cook the mixture for 1-2 minutes, allowing for all those beautiful flavours to mingle!\n\n4. Add in 1 can (400g) of diced tomatoes and give it a good stir!\n\n5. Generously salt your boiling water and add in your pasta \u2013 500g spaghetti or similar. Cook to al dente (firm to the bite), as per the instructions on your pasta packet. Then straight from the boiling water, use a spaghetti spoon (or tongs!) to add your pasta to your puttanesca sauce. The starch from the pasta water helps to create a creamy sauce!\n\n6. Give your pasta a good stir to cover it thoroughly in the sauce! Your sauce will likely still be too thick at this stage, so we\u2019ll loosen it up with more of the pasta water. I like to start with \u00bd cup (120ml) and add more if needed.\n\n7. It\u2019s not traditional, but I like to add a good grating of parmesan before serving \u2013 optional, but recommended!\n\n8. Serve on a plate and top with fresh parsley \u2013 and enjoy! \ud83d\ude0b     \n\n\nI hope you enjoy this pasta puttanesca as much as my family does! If you make yours differently, let me know what you do differently below! \ud83d\udc47 If you have any questions, feel free to ask! \u2753 **And if you love pasta**, be sure to check out my Nonna\u2019s stuffed shells recipe with conchiglioni pasta, and a ricotta and spinach filling here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzCcX1UqXBY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzCcX1UqXBY) \ud83d\ude3b   \n\n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wih511/pasta_puttanesca_in_20_minutes/", "created_utc": 1659882875.0, "score": 2, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wih511/pasta_puttanesca_in_20_minutes/", "html_title": ""}

Cook rice. I am using Nishiki rice for my recipe ( use short or medium grain rice which sticks well together ). You can cook rice the traditional way or use Instant Pot which makes it quite simple, instructions below: \n   1. Measure 2 cups and rinse rice well to remove extra starch. \n   2. Add 1 cup of water to the instant pot then add trivet and place the insert pan with rice on it. Add 2 cups of water and 2 tsp of salt inside the rice. I always use a 1 to 1 ratio of rice to water when cooking rice in the Instant Pot, it always works great! \n   3. Set Instant Pot on high temperature for 6 minutes and wait for natural pressure release. \n   4. When rice is ready, carefully mix in 2 tbsp of rice vinegar, 2 tsp of coconut aminos and 2 tsp of toasted sesame oil. \n   5. Let the rice cool down a bit for \\~5 minutes on the parchment paper. \n2. When rice cools down, make 16-18 round shaped balls and flatten them with your hands to create small rice cakes. Constantly wet your hands with water, so rice doesn't stick to your hands. \n\n**Optional step: if you have more time on your hands and want to create a more perfect rice square shape cakes, I will recommend several extra steps:** \n\n1. **Place rice in the glass container lined with plastic wrap, compress the rice with hands or spoon to flatten it out to about 1 inch thick layer and cover with the lid.** \n2. **Refrigerate rice for at least a couple of hours or ideally overnight.** \n3. **remove rice from the container on the flat surface, remove plastic wrap and cut with a knife in square or rectangular pieces.** \n4. To make crispy rice sushi cakes, I will use an air fryer. Gently spray the air fryer tray and rice cakes with oil on both sides. Air fry rice cakes for 16-18 minutes ( depending on the air fryer model ) at 350\u00b0F. Check in the middle if you need to flip them, I didn\u2019t have to.  \n5. Make sauce: mix mayo, sriracha sauce and lime juice. Use a plastic squeeze bottle, to make it easier to mix and for precision dispensing\n6. Prepare toppings: thinly slice cucumbers, jalape\u00f1o and avocado. You can use any smoked fish of your choice: I am using 2 kinds of smoked salmon and smoked trout. \n7. Place your toppings on the rice cakes starting with the sauce, cucumber, avocado, smoked fish and top it off with jalape\u00f1o pepper. Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top.

{"title": "Easy and Amazing Sandwich", "selftext": " This sandwich is really easy you just got to prepare some ingredients and then assemble everything. \n\nMost ingredients are interchangeable. You don\u2019t need to use chicken breast sausage, eggs, or bacon you can use some kind of cheese if you want to. The Tomato slices are optional as well. You can even exchange the salad-mayo-mustard mixture for coleslaw. I just want to encourage you to try it out and develop a good understanding for yourself. \n\nSharing an easy and tasty sandwich recipe, everyone can make.\n\n I also made a video explaining every step.  [Video](https://youtu.be/xDnRJKgMrJ0)\n\nEstimated time: 20-35min. Calculations at the end.\n\n1 Sandwich needs:\n\n3 Slices of Toast \n\n2 Slices of chicken breast sausage\n\n2 Bacon strips\n\n2 salad leaves\n\n1 slice of tomato \n\nhalf of a boiled egg\n\n1 Tablespoon of mayo \n\n1/4 of a teaspoon of mustard \n\nPinch of salt and black pepper\n\n   \n \n\nDepending on the number of sandwiches you want to make you can either start with boiling the eggs, toasting the toast, or frying the bacon. Each of the tasks can be done simultaneously. Boil the eggs for at least 8min to make sure they are cooked through. I fry the bacon inside the microwave on a plate with a paper towel to soak the excessive fat that the bacon releases while cooking. Depending on your microwaves power it can take between 1 1/2 min - 3 min. If you do it for the first time watch the bacon closely. Wash the tomato and the salad leaves. Cut the tomato into thin slices starting from the bottom and chop towards where the stem used to be. Make sure to get rid of as much excess water as possible from the salad leaves after washing. Chop the salad leaves into thin strips and add them to a bowl. Mix them with the mayo and the mustard until the salad strips are covered. If the eggs are finished boiling put them in some cold water or rinse them under a cold-water stream. Once the eggs are cool enough to handle, crack the shell and start peeling them once peeled try to cut them thinly. Cutting eggs thin is not easy just try your best. Once the bacon is finished frying we can start the assembling process. \n\nStart with a slice of toast. Add 2 slices of chicken breast sausage. On top that add a loaded spoon of the salad, mayo, mustard mixture. Top it with another slice of toast. Add the salad, mayo, mustard mixture again. Then a slice of the tomato, some of the egg slices. Once the eggs are on you can season them with some salt and pepper. Add the Bacon stripes and finish the sandwich with a slice of toast. To make it stable you can pierce the sandwich with 2 toothpicks diagonally. Cut the sandwich diagonally between the 2 toothpicks.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n   \n \n\nI would advise you to at least make a couple of sandwiches to justify the amount of work you got to do.\n\nThe time calculations are pretty depending on how many you want to make. With the minimum time depending on the boiling time for the eggs and the maximum depending on the amount of toast you got to toast. So, my calculations are for about 6 sandwiches. Which is almost equal to a pack of toast.\n\nCan be done at the same time:\n\n\\[\n\n20min Toasting.\n\n10-20min for the bacon, this varies greatly.\n\n10-12 min cooking eggs\n\n15min for cleaning and chopping vegetables.\n\n\\]\n\n10min assembling the sandwiches", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/wby7ua/easy_and_amazing_sandwich/", "created_utc": 1659189683.0, "score": 71, "author": "silverrick222", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/wby7ua/easy_and_amazing_sandwich/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Panzanella - A Classic Bread and Tomato Salad From Tuscany, Italy!", "selftext": "Panzanella salad combines leftover stale bread, beautiful tomatoes and a range of vegetables to create the most delicious, fresh and flavoursome salad! It's a traditional Italian salad that originates from the Tuscany region and is perfect for these warmer evenings!\n\nThere are many ways to make a good Panzanella salad, but I love to use heirloom tomatoes for colour and sweetness, as well as artichokes, which are not a traditional addition, but work really well in this salad! Optional, but highly recommended!\n\nI've also topped my Panzanella with mozzarella di bufala, but you can use any kind of mozzarella, or omit the cheese to keep this salad vegan friendly! \n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyie-KENDxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyie-KENDxc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 1/2 loaf stale good quality bread (approx. 2 cups worth)\n* 4 heirloom tomatoes\n* 1/2 cucumber\n* 1/2 red onion\n* 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar\n* 6 tbsp. olive oil\n* 2 tbsp. (35g) capers\n* 1 jar (380g) artichokes (optional)\n* basil leaves\n* salt and pepper to season\n* 1 mozzarella di bufala ball, ripped into pieces (optional)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 200C (400F). Tear up your (stale) bread into large chunks and place them into a baking tray. You can use any bread, but I\u2019d recommend a sourdough or a crispy Italian loaf! Pour over 2 tbsp. of a good quality olive oil, season generously with salt and combine this altogether! \n\n2. Bake your bread chunks for 5-10 minutes, or until nice and toasty! You can also fry your bread chunks in a frying pan if you don\u2019t have an oven.\n\n3. Slice 4 heirloom tomatoes into chunks. If you can\u2019t find heirloom tomatoes, try to find a tomato that\u2019s on the vine! Add these to a large bowl. \n\n4. Slice half a cucumber length-wise and deseed with a small spoon. Then chop your cucumber halves width-wise to create half-moon slices. Place these into a bowl with your chopped tomatoes.\n\n5. Artichokes are not traditional, but I love adding them to my panzanella for that salty, briny flavour and additional texture! Slice half a red onion into rounds. **Tip:** Soak your onion pieces in water for 15 minutes, just to remove some of the sharpness. Add the artichokes and onion to your large bowl.\n\n6. Once your bread is ready, take it out of the oven and allow it to cool slightly. Rinse off 2 tbsp. capers and add them to your bowl of vegetables. Pick and wash some fresh basil leaves and add to your salad.\n\n7. Now for the dressing! Into a bowl, add 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar, 4 tbsp. olive oil, a good sprinkling of salt and a crack of black pepper. Give your dressing a really good stir!\n\n8. Add your bread chunks to your vegetable and mix together. Now add your dressing and give your salad another good mix!\n\n9. It\u2019s ready to serve! I like to add some torn up pieces of mozzarella di bufala to mine, but you can use any kind of mozzarella \u2013 or omit the cheese to keep this salad vegan friendly!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to add protein to this salad, tuna packed in olive oil is a family favourite! It's so warm here in the UK, we've been making salads most evenings and this one is a classic for a reason! There's a small amount of oven usage, but it's a super easy salad and hopefully will help you keep cool through this heatwave! If you do make this, let me know! I'd love to know how you get on!! \n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/w0ijep/panzanella_a_classic_bread_and_tomato_salad_from/", "created_utc": 1657983501.0, "score": 5, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/w0ijep/panzanella_a_classic_bread_and_tomato_salad_from/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Reliable Chicken Piccata", "selftext": "**Ingredients**\n\n\\- 2 Chicken breasts, cut horizontally\n\n\\- 6 Tbs unsalted butter\n\n\\- \\~4 Tbs olive oil\n\n\\- 1/3 Cup fresh lemon juice\n\n\\- 1/2 Cup chicken stock\n\n\\- 1/4 Cup brined capers\n\n\\- 2 Tbs fresh garlic, minced\n\n\\- 1/4 Cup shallots or onion, minced\n\n\\- 1/3 Cup fresh parsley, chopped\n\n\\- Salt and pepper as needed\n\n\\- 1/4 Cup Flour, for dredging\n\n\\- Pasta of your choice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recipe**\n\n1. Pat dry the chicken breast fillets and season with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken in flour and shake off the excess (this is important). ***NOTE*** \\- Cook your pasta now and reserve a little bit of the pasta water if you'd like to use it to thicken your sauce later. To help keep your pasta from drying out, add a little olive oil and toss it in a bowl, then keep the bowl in a microwave to keep it insulate.\n2. In a large skillet over medium high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil. When the butter and oil start to sizzle, add the chicken in batches, 2 pieces at a time, and cook the chicken until it's browned on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Remove and transfer chicken to a foil-lined plate after it's browned and melt 2 more tablespoons butter before starting the second batch. ***NOTE*** \\- The chicken stays  tender and juicy as long as there is enough butter/oil in the pan, so make sure to top up the skillet with a little extra olive oil if it looks dry. If you don't shake the excess flour off the chicken, the oil will become gummy and gross.\n3. After all the chicken is cooked and removed from the pan, add the onion and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the lemon juice, stock, and capers to the pan and bring to boil, scraping up fond from the pan (the burny bits left from the chicken). Once the sauce is boiling, return all chicken to the pan and reduce heat, simmering for 5 minutes. ***NOTE*** *-* Using fresh lemon juice is key, and adding the capers with a bit of their brine will also help add brightness to the sauce. A lot of recipes will tell you to rinse the capers, but I think this makes the sauce worse. It does make the sauce saltier, though, so use unsalted butter if you can.\n4. Remove the chicken from the skillet and move to a platter. Add the remaining butter (\\~2 tbs) to the sauce and stir until thickened. Remove sauce from heat and add half the parsley, reserving the rest for garnish.

{"title": "The NOT Jennifer Aniston Salad! \ud83c\udf4b\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "This is my take on the famous and trending Jennifer Aniston salad recipe! Jennifer has recently debunked the myth that she ate this salad on the set of Friends everyday for 10 years, so you could say this is the 'Not Jennifer Aniston Salad'! However all I can say is, she's missing out! This salad is healthy, delicious and super easy to make!\n\nYou can easily make this Jennifer Aniston salad recipe vegan by omitting the feta cheese - and if you still want that briny salty flavor, add olives instead! Want to make this gluten free? Substitute the bulger wheat for quinoa!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, my recipe video is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mqdp713ZE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9mqdp713ZE)\n\n\\-----**Ingredients**  \n\n\n* 200g (1 cup) bulger wheat, uncooked\n* 120g (1 cup) cucumber\n* 52g (1/2 cup) red onion\n* 30g (1/2 cup) parsley\n* 8g (1/4 cup) mint\n* 250g (1 cup) feta cheese\n* 425g (15oz) chickpeas\n* 50g (1/2 cup) pistachios\n* 60ml (1/4 cup) lemon juice\n* 30ml (2 tbsp.) olive oil\n* salt and pepper to season\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. To a saucepan full of boiling water, add a good sprinkling of salt - as if you were cooking pasta - and the add 200g bulger wheat. Be sure to check the cooking times on the packaging of your bulger wheat, but mine took around 10-15 minutes to cook.\n2. Prep your vegetables! I like to cut my cucumbers lengthwise and then remove the seeds within with a teaspoon. I then cut the de-seeded cucumbers widthwise into semi-circles. Next, finely chop 50g of red onion. **Tip:** If you find raw onion a bit too strong in terms of flavour, simply soak the onion pieces in a bowl of water for 15 minutes, before you use them in this (or any other!) recipe!\n3. Deshell and finely chop your pistachios. If you can find pistachios that have already been deshelled, this will save you some time! Next, wash and chop your parsley and mint.\n4. Onto the dressing! Freshly squeeze 60ml of lemon juice and sieve the liquid to ensure no pips are included! **Tip:** A great way to get the most juice out of a lemon is to simply microwave the lemon for 20 seconds!\n5. To the lemon juice, add 2 tbsp. good quality extra virgin olive oil, 2 tsp. salt and a good amount of freshly cracked black pepper.\n6. Your bulger wheat should be ready! Simply strain the bulger wheat in a sieve and then place the sieve over the hot, empty pan. Any excess steam will help dry out the bulger wheat.\n7. Into a large bowl, add your bulger wheat and all of your vegetables! Next, add in 425g chickpeas and crumble 250g feta cheese over the top. Pour in your dressing and give the salad a good toss!\n8. Serve - and enjoy!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis recipe serves 4 people generously, but if you have any leftovers, they'll last in the fridge for up to 3 days!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnalRl661w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcnalRl661w)  \n\n\n\\-----  \n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Base**\n\n115g (1/2 cup) butter  \n50g (1/4 cup) sugar  \n1 egg  \n38g (5 tbsp.) cocoa powder  \n235g (2 cups) ground digestive biscuits (or Graham crackers)  \n85g (1 cup) desiccated/shredded coconut  \n50g (1/2 cup) walnuts, finely chopped\n\n**Custard Filling**\n\n60g (1/4 cup) butter  \n44ml (3 tbsp.) heavy/double cream  \n30g (2 tbsp.) custard powder  \n245g (2 cups) icing sugar\n\n**Chocolate Topping**\n\n115 (4oz.) dark/bittersweet chocolate, chopped  \n28g (2 tbsp.) butter  \nflaky sea salt\n\n  \n**Serves: Around 12-15 bars**\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Line an 8\u201d square baking pan with parchment paper and place your Digestive biscuits (or Graham crackers) into a food processor. Blend until the mixture resembles a sand-like consistency. You can do this by hand, by placing the biscuits in a food safe bag and hitting them with a rolling pin, but be sure to break up any large pieces of biscuit!\n2. Add 50g walnuts to your processor \u2013 or finely chop with a knife/smash with a rolling pin! Add 85g desiccated coconut to the biscuit-walnut combination and mix!\n3. Place a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of boiling water and after ensuring the water is at a gentle simmer, add 115g butter, 50g sugar and 38g cocoa powder. Stir this mixture until all of the ingredients have melted together and the liquid is smooth and velvety.\n4. Add 2 eggs to the heatproof bowl and stir continuously for 15-30 seconds. Once combined, carefully remove the heatproof bowl from the saucepan and add in your ground biscuit mixture! Stir thoroughly until everything is covered in the chocolate mix.\n5. Pour into your prepared pan. Push the mixture down with a spatula to create a solid first layer. Be sure to get the mixture into each corner.\n6. Time for the custard buttercream! In a bowl, cream 60g butter until smooth, and then stir in 30g custard powder until the mixture is smooth again. Now pour in 245g icing sugar and 44ml double (heavy) cream. Keep stiring until the mixture becomes thick and bright yellow! You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready if you push your finger into the buttercream and it leaves an imprint.\n7. Dollop your custard filling all over your biscuit base. The buttercream can be tricky to spread, so I like to run a metal spoon under some hot water, quickly dry it and use the heat to push the buttercream around. If you lift up any of the biscuit base below, just push it back. Don\u2019t worry; it won\u2019t affect the taste! Push your buttercream layer into all the corners, creating a second flat layer!\n8. Chop 115g dark (semi-sweet) chocolate and add it to a heatproof bowl atop a saucepan filled with water on a low simmer. Add 28g butter and stir until the chocolate has fully melted. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let the chocolate cool to around body temperature.\n9. Pour the chocolate layer onto your custard layer and spread with a spatula. Sprinkle with some sea salt (optional) and chill in a refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\n10. Slice your Nanaimo bars into \u2018brownie-sized\u2019 squares and enjoy!  \n\n\nThere's a reason these are a classic across Canada! I hope you'll love them too! **I do realise there are quite a few ingredients involved and you might not class this as an 'easy' recipe. Apologies if so!** But this recipe is really easy to make and difficult to get wrong!

{"title": "Suggestions for making peanut butter cookies with almond milk?", "selftext": "So I've only recently begun actually cooking for the first couple months in my life, things like salmon and steak.  By which I mean I'm very new to cooking and possibly am making huge mistakes.  \n\nLast week I decided I wanted to try to make cookies.  I tried a couple recipes I found online for peanut butter cookies. Eggs, sugar, peanut butter (Skippy natural with honey), flour, baking soda, almond milk, and butter was my last attempt and the batter was definitely tasty.  \n\nBut the cookies keep ending up very hard, the texture is always very off and very rough.  The cookie never tastes as good as the batter, when they don't expand and merge together into like pancakes.  I've seen videos on Youtube about how to make cookies, and there people can mold the batter into little balls.  I've never managed that, they're always too runny, even when I put them in the fridge for several hours.  They always stick to the pan.  Admittedly I don't have non-stick pans or the special paper, but I've been putting olive oil and butter on the plate, which helps it stop stick but also tends to make the cookie greasy.  I wonder also how much of this is due to using a microwave oven?  \n\nI figure I have to be making a lot of mistakes, so I'd appreciate any guidance into if it's possible to make a decent cookie how I've been trying or if this is very mistaken and how I rectify it.

{"title": "Almond Slices - Like Bakewell Slices, But Better!! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "This almond slice recipe is a take on the traditional English Bakewell slice, but I've substituted the pastry base with a buttery shortbread biscuit base! Atop this shortbread base sits a delicious and inviting raspberry jam layer, followed by a layer of frangipane sponge, and finished with a sprinkling of flaked almonds!\n\nIt's the perfect treat all year round and a new favourite amongst my family and friends!! If you don't like raspberry jam, feel free to experiment with other flavours of jam! Apricot jam would be amazing in these slices!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-QSrbb4eck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-QSrbb4eck)\n\n\\-----\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Shortbread Base:**\n\n* 175g butter, room temperature\n* 75g caster sugar\n* 225g plain or all purpose flour\n\n**Frangipane Sponge / Jam Layers:**\n\n* 100g butter, room temperature\n* 100g caster sugar\n* 2 eggs\n* 50g almond flour (or ground almonds)\n* 50g plain flour\n* 1/2 tsp. almond extract\n* 150g raspberry jam, seedless\n* a big handful of flaked almonds\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**  \n\n\n**Shortbread Base**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 170C (325F) and line a 20cm x 30cm pan with butter and parchment paper.\n2. Into a mixing bowl, cream together 175g butter (room temperature) and 75g caster sugar. You\u2019ll know when both ingredients are fully combined, as the mixture will lighten in colour and become smoother to mix!\n3. At this point, add 225g plain flour (or all purpose) and combine until it\u2019s a stiff, but crumbly dough. I find the best way to do this is with my hands! You don\u2019t want to over mix at this stage; otherwise your shortbread base will be tough and chewy.\n4. Sprinkle your base layer into your prepared pan and then press down to create a layer of even thickness. Be sure to get your dough into the corners and edges too! If you don\u2019t want to push down with your hands, use the flat bottom of a large glass. Finally, with a fork, generously prick the shortbread dough. This will help with the rise and allow for an even bake.\n5. Bake for 20 \u2013 25 minutes, until light golden!\n\n**Frangipane Sponge**\n\n6. Into a mixing bowl, cream together 100g butter (room temperature) and 100g caster sugar. Once fully combined, swap your spoon for a whisk, add in 2 eggs and whisk until fully combined and smooth.\n\n7. Add 50g almond flour, 50g plain flour and \u00bd tsp. almond extract. Mix together.\n\n8. Remove your shortbread layer from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes. Dollop on the seedless raspberry jam (or any other flavour!) onto the shortbread. I find blasting the jam in a microwave for 10-20 seconds makes it easier to spread! With the back of a spoon, spread your jam across the shortbread to create an even layer.\n\n9. Dollop on your sponge batter and then gently spread it across the jam layer. You don\u2019t want the jam and sponge to combine and you don\u2019t want any jam poking through! Finally, sprinkle on a handful of flaked almonds.\n\n10. Bake for another 20 \u2013 25 minutes. Once out of the oven, allow your bake to cool to room temperature. Cut your slices as big or as small as you like, but this should make around 16 slices/portions! Enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you love this recipe as much as I do!!

Easy recipe + cooking tips and comparison of cooking methods.", "selftext": "If you like French onion soup and if you like chicken, you will be blown away with this amazing chicken recipe. \n\n**Ingredients: ( 4-6 people )** \n\n* Boneless and skinless chicken thighs or chicken breasts - 4-6 pcs ( I am using chicken thighs ) \n* Onions ( large ) - 2pcs ( yellow or red ) \n* Dried thyme leaves - 1 teaspoon \n* Cornstarch - 1 tablespoon ( mixed  with 2 tablespoons of water ) \n* Beef stock - 1 cup\n* Bay leaves - 2-3 pcs\n* Kosher Salt & Black pepper - to taste \n* Brown sugar - 1 teaspoon \n* Avocado or olive oil - 2 tablespoons \n* Butter - 2 tablespoons \n* Swiss Gruyere cheese ( grated ) - \u00be  cup \n* Parmesan cheese ( grated ) - \u00be  cup \n* *Red wine ( optional ) -  \u00bc cup*\n* *Cognac ( optional ) - 3 tablespoons* \n\nFor garnish: green scallions \n\nServe with: french baguette and grilled vegetables. \n\n**if you are visual learner and want to see step by step video instructions, check out video recipe + cooking tips:**[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rAHpyXftfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rAHpyXftfs)\n\n**Step#1** \n\nPretty much any onion will work for this recipe. Slice onions half moons about \u00bc inch thick slices. I would recommend pounding chicken breast or tights for this recipe, this way you make sure your chicken is cooking evenly\u2026.as result it will make your chicken more tender. \n\n**You can do it in a ziplock bag or use plastic wrap on both sides. If you don\u2019t have a mallet, you can use a skillet instead, and gently pound the meat.** \n\nSeason chicken on all sides with salt, pepper and dry thyme. Now, we are going to brown chicken, I will do it side by side in Instant Pot and Dutch Oven. Turn on Saute mode on Instant Pot and heat plate for the dutch oven, and then add some oil. **Pot should be very hot, when adding the oil**. When oil gets hot, add chicken and brown for about 4-5 minutes on each side. **Also brown the meat long enough on each side before moving around, it will help to avoid getting meat stuck to the pot.** \n\nI have to say that I do like browning on dutch oven a bit more than Instant pot.   \n\nNow, take the chicken out to a separate dish. \n\n**Step#2  Caramelizing onion**  \n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nUsing silicon or wooden spatula, remove all the bits from the bottom of the pot. \n\nNow, start your Instant Pot on Sautee mode. Melt \u00bc stick of butter and then add sliced onions.     \n\nTurn off the Saute function, set Instant Pot to high manual pressure for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes cycle is over, keep it for another 2 minutes and do manual release. Now, turn Instant Pot to Saute mode. Add \u00bd teaspoon of salt and \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar, cook for 10 minutes or until onions get golden brown color, remember to stir in the process.\n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nHit up \u00bc stick of unsalted butter, add sliced onions and cook on low-medium for 25 minutes. Onions should reduce in size. Now raise the heat to medium high, add \u00bd teaspoon of salt, \u00bc teaspoon of brown sugar and cook for another 30 minutes or until onions are golden brown color. \n\nCaramelizing onions in Instant Pot is a super convenient feature which allows us to save a significant amount of time. \n\n**Step#3**\n\n**Instant Pot:** \n\nLet\u2019s make sure our instant pot is deglazed. Add 1 cup of beef broth, bay leaves, teaspoon of thyme and red wine. Add chicken and cover it up with sauce. Close the lid, turn on Instant Pot on 10 min at high pressure and then wait for natural pressure release. \n\nWhen chicken is ready, take it out from the Instant Pot to the casserole dish, and turn on saute mode. Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water and add it to the pot. Also, if you want a more authentic French flavor, add 3 tablespoons of cognac ( or sub cognac for brandy, sherry or white wine ). Seamer on saute mode for 5-10 min or until sauce will thicken. \n\n**Dutch Oven:** \n\nIn dutch oven the process is the same. Layer the same ingredients in the dutch oven. Set heat on medium low and simmer for 30-40 minutes under a closed lid. At the end add some cognac and cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce. \n\nIn this method a lot of liquid got evaporated during the cooking process, so not much time required for sauce thickening. In most cases you don\u2019t even need to add cornstarch. \n\n**Step#4** \n\nCover chicken with sauce in the casserole dish, and then cover it up with shredded cheeses. Send it to the oven on a broil setting for 5 to 10 minutes or until the cheese will brown a bit. \n\nThe final thing left is to taste it. It tasted amazing and we were not able to see the difference in flavor between both cooking methods. \n\nAll in all, Instant Pot is a bit faster, especially for caramelizing onions. It saved me about 15-20 minutes in cooking time. Taste and flavor was equally amazing with both cooking methods. \n\nBon Appetit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vnqugn/french_onion_chicken_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "created_utc": 1656538256.0, "score": 39, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vnqugn/french_onion_chicken_in_instant_pot_vs_dutch_oven/", "html_title": ""}

Prepare your vegetables! I\u2019m cutting my carrots into thin strips, shredding a savoy cabbage, slicing my onions into rounds and finely chopping 3 cloves of garlic! \n\n2. Chop 450g of your favourite protein into bite sized cubes. For this recipe, I\u2019ve chosen to use pork. Add your protein to a hot wok. The fat from the pork will help to cook the meat, but if you\u2019re using a leaner protein or tofu, you\u2019ll want to add some vegetable oil to the wok.\n\n3. Once your pork (or protein) is cooked through and brown, transfer onto a plate and set aside. To the wok, add a splash of vegetable and your onions. Give them a good toss. Once your onions begin to soften, add your garlic \u2013 and 30 seconds later, add in your pork (or protein!). Add a pinch of salt and pepper to season.\n\n4. Tip in all of your vegetables!\n\n5. Once your vegetables have started to wilt, it\u2019s time to make the sauce! Add to the wok 1 tbsp. sugar, 2 tbsp. dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp. oyster sauce (or more soy sauce and sugar if keeping this vegetarian) and 2 tbsp. soy sauce. Give this a little mix before adding 500ml good quality chicken stock (or water if vegetarian).\n\n6. Now for the bihon! Add 225g rice vermicelli noodles to the wok. Press them down to help them absorb the sauce. Your noodles will begin to soften, which is when you\u2019ll want to push them underneath the vegetables and sauce mixture, allowing them to nestle in all those delicious flavours! The noodles won\u2019t take long to cook, but keep your wok on the heat until the majority of the liquid has been absorbed.\n\n7. Once done, add some chopped spring onions to the mix (the green bits only!) and give it a quick stir!\n\n8. Serve with half a lime (Calamansi is traditional) in each dish, to be squeezed over your pancit bihon \u2013 and enjoy! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis dish was so delicious, I've made it a few times since! I might try adding chicken and shrimp next time! As said, Filipino food isn't a cuisine I cook often, but I made this as part of a collaboration challenge. Let me know how I did!

Original recipe calls for the whole chicken, but to save time on carving up and since we are starting a swimsuit season I will use boneless and skinless chicken breast. Cut chicken breast to 2\u201d slices. \n\nTurn on Instant Pot on saute mode, add some oil and brown chicken on all sides. Season chicken with salt and pepper. No need to cook it through, just brown for about 5-6 minutes. \n\nTake the chicken out to a separate dish, add a bit more oil to the instant pot and saute onions until soft and translucent. Add some salt in the process. \n\nNow you can add minced garlic, tomato sauce, hot peppers, Adjika sauce which is Georgian style chili paste and Khmeli Suneli which is a Georgian style spice mix. Cook it all for another minute. \n\nYou can find Adjika and Khmeli Suneli spices on Amazon. These spices are very flavorful and you can also use them in most other Georgian dishes\u2026..so it is a good investment. \n\nNow you can add diced canned tomatoes together with liquid from the can. Original recipe calls for fresh skinless chopped tomatoes, but I have decided to cut the corner here.   \n\nNow, we are ready for pressure cooking. Add chicken to the pot. Close the lid, turn on pressure on manual high for 15 minutes and wait for natural pressure release. Total cooking time: 10 minutes to come to pressure + 15 minutes under pressure + 10 minutes natural pressure release, in total 35 minutes. \n\nNow, if you want to make this dish in the dutch oven, the process is identical. You will cook chicken under a closed lead in dutch oven until the chicken reaches 165\u00b0 Fahrenheit.  Cooking this dish in Dutch oven or Instant Pot takes about the same amount of time. \n\nAnd finally add fresh cilantro or parsley to the dish and it is ready to serve.

Peeling the eggs will be a breeze, and this Instant Pot pressure cooking method will save so much time for your important special occasions!  \n[video recipe](https://youtu.be/yn-_eLyU8OE)  \n**INGREDIENTS**  \n\\* 6 eggs  \n\\* 3 Tbsp Mayonnaise  \n\\* 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard  \n\\* 1/4 tsp apple cider vinegar  \n\\* 2-3 Tbsp cheddar cheese, finely shredded  \n\\* 8-10 thin dill pickles slices, chopped fine  \n\\* salt & pepper, to taste  \n\\* Paprika, sprinkle for garnish  \n\\* Dill, for garnish  \n**INSTRUCTIONS**  \nTo boil eggs on Stovetop\n\n1. Arrange the eggs in a pot in a single layer and fill the pan with water (at least 1 inch in depth)\n2. Cover the pot and bring the water up to a boil.\n3. As soon as the water comes up to a boil, start your egg timer, turn off the heat and remove the pan from the heat.\n4. In the meanwhile, prepare an ice water bath by filling a large bowl with water and ice. After 10 minutes, remove the eggs from the pot of hot water and transfer to the iced water bath.\n5. Cool the eggs for at least 5 minutes and then lightly crack the shell with the back of a spoon. To peel the eggs, either peel it under a stream of cold running water, or submerge the eggs in the water bath and start peeling.  \nTo boil eggs in Instant Pot\n6. Place a trivet in the Instant Pot. Carefully arrange the eggs over the trivet, making sure not to overcrowd the pot.\n7. Add 1 Cup of water. If you are making multiple batches of eggs, make sure after each batch, you have at least 1 cup of water remaining in the Instant Pot.\n8. Close the lid, turn the valve to\u00a0Sealing\u00a0mode and press on the\u00a0Egg\u00a0setting. If your Instant Pot does not have an\u00a0Egg\u00a0setting, select\u00a0Pressure Cook\u00a0or\u00a0Manual\u00a0mode and set the heat to\u00a0Normal\u00a0and pressure to\u00a0High.\u00a0Set the cook time to 2 minutes.\n9. Once the timer has gone off, for hard boiled eggs, let pressure release naturally for 8 minutes. In the meanwhile prepare an ice water bath in a large bowl.\n10. Then manually release any remaining pressure and transfer the eggs to the iced water bath. Let cool for at least 5 minutes.\n11. Crack the shell and peel out shell from the egg. Peeling the egg while submerged or under running water helps the egg to come off easier.  \nTo prepare the deviled eggs\n12. Slice each egg in half and scoop out the egg yolks to a large bowl. Then, add the mayonnaise, dijon mustard, vinegar, chopped pickles, cheese, small pinch of salt and pepper.\n13. Whisk well until the deviled egg mixture has a smooth consistency throughout. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper if necessary.\n14. Arrange the egg white halves on a serving platter and using a pair of spoons scoop an egg yolk sized deviled mixture with one spoon, and scoop this portion with another.\n15. Repeat this process until the portion is smooth and has an appealing look. Once happy, gently scoop this mixture into the egg white half. Repeat the same for the remaining mixture.\n16.

{"title": "Easy recipe of BBQ ribs in the pressure cooker or instant pot.", "selftext": "With 4th of July coming up it is now time for me to share my favorite recipe, BBQ ribs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you are a visual learner, check out this video with step by step instructions:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjZPRB\\_\\_2U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjZPRB__2U) \n\n**Ingredients ( servings 4-5 )** \n\n* Pork back ribs - 3lb\n* BBQ rub and seasoning of your choice ( I prefer Trader Joe\u2019s BBQ rub and seasoning with coffee and garlic ). Alternatively you can make your own rub, directions below.\n* Apple juice - 2 cups ( alternatively you can use water ) \n* Liquid smoke - 1 teaspoon\n* Apple cider vinegar - 2 tablespoons\n* BBQ sauce of your choice \n\n**How to make your own rub ( optional )** \n\nMix the following ingredients, you can substitute or adjust spices to your own liking:\n\nBrown sugar - 2 teaspoon \n\nKosher salt - 1 \u00bd   teaspoon\n\nGarlic powder - 1 teaspoon \n\nChili powder - 1 teaspoon\n\nGround mustard - 1 teaspoon \n\nPaprika - 1 teaspoon\n\nGround cumin - \u00bd teaspoon \n\nGround black pepper - \u00bd teaspoon  \n\nCayan pepper - \u00bc teaspoon \n\nOk, let\u2019s go through the simple steps. \n\n**Step #1**\n\nTake the ribs from the fridge and pat them dry with the paper towel. Now, you can make your own rub seasoning ( see list of ingredients above ) or you can use the store bought one. Season the ribs really well on both sides with the rub. Don\u2019t be shy, rub it in with your hands. \n\nPro tip: use disposable food preparation gloves, it will keep the process a lot cleaner. \n\n**Step #2**\n\nPure 2 cups of apple juice ( alternatively you can use water ), 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke inside the instant pot. \n\nAdding apple juice and vinegar makes ribs act like salt making ribs moist and also adds a nice apple flavor. \n\nAdd Instant Pot trivet to the bottom of the pot, it will elevate the ribs so they are not submerged in a liquid while cooking. \n\nSet Instant Pot for 25 minutes at manual high pressure. Let natural pressure release for 10 minutes and then release remaining pressure manually. \n\nNow, brush your favorite BBQ sauce on the ribs. I am using sweet and spicy pineapple sauce from Trader Joes. \n\nPut ribs in the oven on a high broil setting for about 5 minutes. When ready, brush a bit more BBQ sauce on top.    \n\nThis is it, we are done. Quick and simple. Your family and friends will be impressed with these ribs. You can serve them with baked potatoes, corn, greens or potato salad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vg31aw/easy_recipe_of_bbq_ribs_in_the_pressure_cooker_or/", "created_utc": 1655668124.0, "score": 59, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vg31aw/easy_recipe_of_bbq_ribs_in_the_pressure_cooker_or/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How To Make Perfect Vegetable Tempura At Home! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "According to my husband, vegetable tempura is the tastiest way to eat vegetables! Tempura is a favourite appetizer in Japanese restaurants, and a dish I used to order on a regular basis, but it's surprisingly cheap and simple to make at home!\n\nI also show you how to make Tentsuyu, a traditional dipping sauce for tempura, which is full of umami! This isn't the healthiest way to eat vegetables, but it's a lovely treat to enjoy from time to time!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, you can watch my vegetable tempura recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azP5Sf66Pfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azP5Sf66Pfs)\n\n\\-----\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Tempura**140g cornflour / cornstarch60g plain flour (*plus more for dusting!*)160ml sparkling watervegetable oil (*for frying*)vegetables! (*I'm using carrots, eggplant, broccoli, king mushrooms, sweet potatoes, asparagus and potatoes*)\n\n**Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce**250ml dashi60ml (1/4 cup) soy sauce60ml (1/4 cup) mirin rice wine\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Let\u2019s start with our Tentsuyu dipping sauce! To a sauce pan, add your dashi\\*, mirin rice wine and soy sauce. Gently heat this mixture up to bring all the flavours together and then set it aside for later. \\**I use dashi concentrate. If you have dashi concentrate, follow the instructions to make a 250ml mixture. In my case, it was roughly 1:10 dash to water mix, so I did 25ml dashi and 225ml water. You can also find dashi pre-made, so just use 250ml of the liquid! Alternatively, you can cook shiitake mushrooms in hot water until the water turns a dark brown colour. You can then use 250ml of this water as your dashi substitute!*\n2. Prep your vegetables! I\u2019m using carrots, eggplant, broccoli, king mushrooms, sweet potatoes, asparagus and potatoes. I like to cut my carrots and mushrooms into thin 5mm thick strips, the eggplant and sweet potatoes into thin roundels, and I grate my potatoes with a cheese grater!\n3. Fill a large saut\u00e9 pan with vegetable oil, approximately 1 inch deep, and heat. You\u2019ll want the oil to reach 180C | 360F in temperature. You can also test to ensure the oil is hot enough by dropping some of your tempura batter into the oil. If the batter sizzles and rises to the surface, your oil is ready for cooking!\n4. Now for the tempura batter! In a bowl, add 140g cornflour (or cornstarch) and 60g plain flour. Give it a quick mix, then add 160ml sparkling water and a handful of crushed ice. Keeping your batter cold is very important!\n5. The best method to mix this batter is with 4 chopsticks held together. You then make a \u2018stabbing\u2019 motion up and down to mix the ingredients; do not stir! If you don\u2019t have chopsticks, I\u2019d highly recommend getting some for this step! However if you really cannot find any chopsticks, I\u2019d use the handle end of a wooden spoon \u2026\n6. Once your mixture looks like double cream / heavy cream in consistency, it\u2019s ready! Simply dip your vegetables into a bowl of plain flour, covering them generously, and then place your vegetables into your batter, making sure to cover every surface! Carefully place them into the oil. I like using my chopsticks to \u2018sprinkle\u2019 some additional batter mix onto the cooking vegetables, as this adds some lovely crispy and crunchy bits!\n7. Turn your vegetables every now and again. The batter is quite light in colour, but it should turn to a light golden brown. Once light golden brown, place on a cooling rack with some paper towels beneath, just to allow any excess oil to drip off!\n8. Every now and again, scoop out any excess batter pieces floating in your oil \u2013 and continue cooking your vegetables! I like to dip a large amount of the grated potato into the flour, then the batter, and then I take small handfuls and fry individually as little \u2018nests\u2019!\n9. Reheat your sauce, serve and enjoy! (*If you like your tempura as warm as possible, you can place your finished fried vegetables into an oven at a low temperature, whilst you continue frying the other vegetables!*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, feel free to ask below and I'll try and answer them as soon as possible!

{"title": "3 easy ways to make smoked chicken at home without a smoker.", "selftext": "In the recipe I will be using 3 indoor smoking methods: AirFryer, Stovetop and homemade smoker made out of Dutch Oven. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nChicken breast - 4lb ( total for all 3 methods combined )  \n\nBrine: \n\n1. Kosher salt - 3 tablespoons \n2. Brown sugar - 1 tablespoon \n3. Red chili flakes ( optional ) - 1 teaspoon ( only if you like to add a spicy kick to it )\n\nSeasoning: ( you can use any chicken seasoning or rub of your choice ) \n\n1. Garlic salt ( from Trader Joe\u2019s ) \n2. Adjika ( Georgian seasoning blend from Trader Joe\u2019s )\n3. Lemon pepper seasoning ( from Trader Joe\u2019s )\n4. Avocado or olive oil\n\nWood chips ( for stovetop and dutch oven methods ) - I am using cherry flavor ( you can also use pecan, mesquite or apple wood )\n\nLiquid smoke - \u00bd teaspoon ( for Air fryer method only )\n\nOptional: you can add BBQ sauce after the chicken is ready\n\n**If you are visual learner, I have step by step guide, cooking tips and comparison of cooking methods in this video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du82gomTmP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du82gomTmP0) \n\nFor smoking I prefer to use whole chicken, thighs or chicken breast. For today's recipe I will be using chicken breast. \n\n**Step#1 Brining process**\n\nWe do need to brine chicken before smoking. You can do wet or dry brining. For meat with less fat ( such as chicken breast\u2026which is one of the leanest meats ) use wet brine, this way meat will get juicier in a smoking process. \n\nAlso I recommend skinless chicken for smoking, this way smoke will get inside the meat vs staying in the skin only. \n\nBrining makes cooked meat more moist by hydrating the cells of its muscle tissue before cooking. \n\nFor the simple brine use Kosher salt and brown sugar. You can always add other aromatic spices or liquids. I am adding some chili flakes, but it is optional. You can always get more creative by adding bourbon, wine, lemon juice, garlic cloves, herbs or apples. \n\nAdd 3 tablespoons of salt and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in the warm water and mix well to dissolve. Let water cool down or add some ice to speed it up. Now you can add chicken in the ziplock bag or vacuum sealed bag, cover it with brine and send it to the fridge for at least 3 hours. You can go up to 8 hours, but don\u2019t go longer than 8.  \n\n**Step#2 Seasoning chicken.** \n\nAfter 4 hours in the brine, dry chicken with the paper towel, spray with avocado oil and season it with your favorite spices on both sides. I am using a nice mix of spices from trader Joe\u2019s. \n\n**Method #1 Air Fryer**\n\nFor this method in addition to seasoning I will splash a little bit of liquid smoke. I am using \u00bd teaspoon. Don\u2019t use too much as it is highly concentrated. \n\nNow, put chicken in the Air Fryer at 220\u00b0F. It will be ready when chicken is at 165\u00b0F internal temperature. In the process open the Air Fryer a few times to check internal temperature with the termometr. In my case, it took me about 30 minutes. \n\n**Method #2 Stovetop smoker**\n\nFollow instructions of your Stovetop smoker. I am using the one made by Cameron. \n\nCherry sawdust is always a popular choice for smoked chicken. But, you can also use apple, pecan or maple wood chips or sawdust. \n\nI also recommend using foil to cover the base and dripping tray, which will make it a lot easier to clean up. Set it up on the stove on medium heat. It took me about 30 minutes to get it to 165\u00b0F. \n\nOptionally I like to put an aluminum disposable cup with some water or apple juice on the tray. It will add additional flavor and help to keep the meat moist. \n\n**Method #3 Do it yourself, a smoker made out of Dutch oven and some foil.** \n\nLay 2 pieces of foil inside the Dutch oven with sides sticking out. Sprinkle food chips and cover them up with loose pieces of foil. Now put a tray inside the dutch oven. Lay chicken on the trey, tighten up foil and close the lid. Set the stove to medium heat. It took me about 20-25 minutes. Open up the foil in the process to check the temperature so you don\u2019t overcook the chicken. \n\nNow, let\u2019s taste it. All 3 pieces look about the same. After a very demanding testing process we arrived at consensus that the Stovetop version had the most amount of flavor, maybe that cup of apple juice worked the magic.\n\nHowever Dutch oven and Air Fryer were not far apart, very tasty, moist and full of flavor. \n\nOptionally you can brush chicken with BBQ sauce before serving. \n\nIn summary, all 3 methods worked out quite well, took about the same amount of time and about the same amount of effort and cleanup. \n\n**If you want to know how to smoke fish without a smoker at home, I have link in the description of this video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vcwud1/3_easy_ways_to_make_smoked_chicken_at_home/", "created_utc": 1655306172.0, "score": 3, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vcwud1/3_easy_ways_to_make_smoked_chicken_at_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Salted Honey Pie! \ud83c\udf6f\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": " If you have a sweet tooth, then look no further! Salted honey pie is a buttery pie crust filled with a super smooth caramel custard, comprising of honey, brown sugar and double cream. The honey pie is then garnished with sea salt to finish! This is the perfect pie for summer, as it's served cold out of the fridge!   \n\n\n**If you're a visual learner, be sure to check out our video recipe here:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en0Fk9x-XcQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en0Fk9x-XcQ)  \n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**\n\n* a single pie crust (pre-made, roll out or homemade!)\n* 4 egg yolks\n* 600ml (2 1/2 cups) double cream / heavy cream\n* 144g (1 cup) brown sugar\n* 37g (1/3 cup) cornflour\n* 3g (1/2 tsp.) salt\n* 120ml (1/2 cup) runny honey\n* 10ml ( 2 tsp.) vanilla extract\n* sea salt to garnish\n\n\\-----  \n**Method**  \n1. Preheat oven to 190C | 375F and line an 8\u201d pie dish with your crust. Chill your pie crust in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. You can use a pre-made pie crust from the store, roll out pie pastry, or make your pie pastry from scratch, if you\u2019re feeling adventurous!  \n\n\n2. To a medium bowl, add 4 egg yolks and give them a quick whisk to combine the egg yolks together.  \n\n\n3. To a saucepan, sieve 37g corn flour (also known as corn starch). I like to sieve the corn flour to prevent any lumps in the custard! Now add 144g brown sugar and 3g salt to the corn flour. Break up any lumps of sugar with a wooden spoon or plastic spatula and give the mixture a quick stir.  \n\n\n4. Add 600ml double cream (also known as heavy cream) to the mixture and turn the heat to medium. You\u2019ll want to stir the mixture constantly, so that it doesn\u2019t burn to the bottom of your pan! As the temperature increases, the mixture will thin out. However it\u2019ll then begin to thicken \u2013 and you\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when you see bubbles forming underneath and on the surface.  \n\n\n5. Now we need to carefully temper our egg yolks! Add a small amount of your warm cream mixture to the yolks whilst whisking. Keep adding small amounts and whisk consistently until you\u2019ve added all of the warm cream mixture. If you add the mixture too fast, you\u2019ll cook the egg yolks, which will result in a scrambled egg custard mess!  \n\n\n6. Once combined, add in 10ml (2 tsp.) vanilla extract and 120ml runny honey. Stir to melt the honey into the mixture.  \n\n\n7. Sieve the mixture into your chilled pie crust. This ensures your custard filling is as smooth as smooth can be!! Carefully carry it to your oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.  \n\n\n8. When the pie comes out of the oven, the filling will still be really jiggly. Don\u2019t worry; it will set! Let the pie cool to room temperature and then chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours.  \n\n\n9. Remove from the fridge, garnish with sea salt (optional) and serve!   \n\n\n  \nIf you have any questions regarding this recipe, feel free to ask me below!  \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b \n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/vb96dx/salted_honey_pie/", "created_utc": 1655116673.0, "score": 28, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/vb96dx/salted_honey_pie/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "A 107 Year Old Recipe - Gingerbread Cake!!", "selftext": "This beautifully delicate, moist and spicy gingerbread cake recipe was kindly given to me by a family friend! It's a recipe that has been passed down through generations and likely dates back to the Victorian era, over 100 years ago! And it shows, as the original recipe calls for shortening to be used!\n\nThis gingerbread cake packs a punch in terms of flavour, but it's not overly sweet. I've added a dollop of whipped cream to add some sweetness to this dessert, topped with crystallised candied ginger pieces for decoration - and to let everyone know it's definitely a ginger cake!\n\nIf you're a visual learner, check out my recipe video here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KenqSVmfn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KenqSVmfn0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n3 eggs  \n227g butter, melted  \n1 tsp cinnamon  \n1 tsp ground ginger  \n1/2 tsp ground cloves  \n200g sugar  \n240g plain flour  \n236ml water, boiling  \n320g black treacle/molasses  \n2 tsp. baking soda  \n2 tbsp. hot water  \nsugar (to top)  \nwhipped cream and crystalised candied ginger (optional)\n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**  \n\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F, then grease a 9\u201d x 13\u201d baking with butter and line it with parchment paper.\n2. Into a large bowl, add 3 eggs, 200g sugar, 320g black treacle (or molasses), 227g melted butter, 1 tsp. ground ginger, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. ground cloves. Stir this together until the mixture is nice and smooth.\n3. In a small bowl, add 2 tbsp. hot water to 2 tsp. baking soda. Give this a quick stir to dissolve the baking soda, and then pour the mixture into your wet cake batter.\n4. Sieve 240g plain flour (or all-purpose flour) into the wet ingredients. Sieving is important in this recipe, as it\u2019s a very delicate cake! You don\u2019t want any lumps of flour in your mixture! Stir in the flour to combine.\n5. Add in 236ml of boiling hot water and stir to combine. Your cake mix will look very thin at this stage, but don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be!\n6. Pour the mixture into your pre-prepared pan and bake for around 35-45 minutes.\n7. Once out of the oven, gently press on the centre of your cake. If it springs back, it\u2019s done! Now cover your cake with a generous sprinkling (approx. 50g) of granulated sugar!\n8. Cut into equal sized squares and serve on a plate with whipped cream and chopped crystallized/candied ginger! Alternatively, this gingerbread cake goes great with warm vanilla custard or a cold scoop of vanilla ice cream!  \n\n\nLet me know what you think of this recipe, especially if you give it a go! It's super easy to make, a bit different, but so delicious!

{"title": "Hot smoked fish is a great appetizer. How to smoke fish without smoker indoors using 3 easy methods: Air Fryer, Stovetop and Dutch Oven", "selftext": "If you were thinking of making your own smoked fish at home, but don\u2019t have an outdoor smoker or ability to smoke fish outdoors\u2026..don\u2019t look further. I will walk you through 3 simple methods on how to make an amazing smoked fish at the convenience of your own home without need of any specialty smoking equipment. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nSteelhead - 4lb ( you can also use salmon, trout or mackerel )\n\nKosher salt - \u00be of the cup\n\nBrown sugar - \u00be of the cup\n\nGarlic powder - 1 tablespoon ( you can experiment with other spices of your choice )\n\nHoney ( or maple syrup ) - for glazing the fish\n\nWood chips - I am using hickory flavor ( you can also use cherry, maple or apple wood )\n\nLiquid smoke - \u00bd teaspoon ( for Air fryer method only )   \n\n**If you are a visual learner, I do have step by step video guide along with some useful smoking tips:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MefBVrwPIY) \n\n**Let\u2019s start with brining the fish.** \n\nTake the fish from the fridge. Let\u2019s start by cutting the fish into equal pieces. If you see any bones on the surface, take them out. \n\nMake the brine out of equal proportions of kosher salt and brown sugar. If you like fish that are more salty or more sweet, you can adjust proportions accordingly. Mix in 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. Generously cover the fish with the mixture, close the lid on an air tight container and send it to the fridge for 6-12 hours. I normally do this process the night before. \n\nTake the fish out from the fridge, rinse it well with the cold water, dry it with the paper towel, set it on the rack skin side down and send it to the fridge to dry for about 1 hour. \n\nOk, now the fish are ready for smoking. \n\n**Method #1** Air Fryer: \n\nBefore smoking we need to coat the fish with honey and liquid smoke. \n\nFor this piece of fish use \u00bd teaspoon of liquid smoke, it is highly concentrated, so you don\u2019t need much. \n\nNow, send the fish to the air fryer at 170\u00b0F for at least 1h. It took me 1 hours and 20 minutes for this piece as it is about 2 inch thick. Remember to coat fish again in the middle of the process. When ready, the fish should be at 160F. \n\n**Method #2** Using a stovetop smoker made by Cameron. \n\nGlaze fish with some honey. I like to use sawdust chips, which start to create smoke pretty much right away. I am using hickory flavor, but you can also experiment with cherry, maple or apple wood. \n\nSet the smoker on the stove at medium heat for about 25 minutes. Time will vary based on the size of the fish. \n\n**Method #3** Homemade smoker made out of Dutch oven and some foil\n\nIn this method we will replicate a Cameron stovetop, with dutch oven and a little bit of foil. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have dutch oven, you can also use a deep skillet or a pot.  \n\nTake 2 pieces of foil and lay them inside Dutch Oven with some foil sticking out. Sprinkle sawdust wood chips and cover them up with a piece of foil.  Now put the grilling rack on top. I am using a trivet from my instant pot. \n\nIf you don\u2019t have one available, you can crumble up few pieces of foil and put at the bottom which will elevate the fish inside in a similar way. \n\nNow put glazed fish on top of the rack, fold remaining pieces of the foil very tight, so smoke will not escape and then close the lid of the dutch oven. \n\nSet it on the stove for or 25 minutes or until the fish is 160\u00b0F. Due to the very tight lid and foil, there is almost no smoke going outside the dutch oven, which is a plus when smoking in a less ventilated area.  \n\nAll three versions of the smoked steelhead look and smell amazing. The one from the air fryer looks a bit brighter in color compared to the other 2.  \n\nYou can serve smoked fish hot or cold.  \n\nAs far as a taste, we were not able to see the difference\u2026..all 3 options turned out really good. Personally I didn\u2019t expect that air fryer with liquid smoke version will be on par with traditional stovetop smoking. So, I am quite impressed with the results! \n\nIn summary, all 3 cooking methods work really well and with a minimum amount of effort or cleanup. Air Fryer version took a bit longer compared to stove top but results of all 3 methods were equally good, so use the one you are more comfortable with.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/v8kdgv/hot_smoked_fish_is_a_great_appetizer_how_to_smoke/", "created_utc": 1654791256.0, "score": 53, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/v8kdgv/hot_smoked_fish_is_a_great_appetizer_how_to_smoke/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

These types of potatoes have thick skin, high starch content and are lower in moisture, which makes them perfect to achieve an outside crispines when making french fries. \n\nNow, wash potatoes really well with the brush. Cut them as evenly as possible so they will cook through at the same time. I prefer larger wedges which are about \u00bd inch thick ( aka Steak fries ), but you can adjust it based on your preference. \n\nRinse potatoes with cold water until the water is clear. We need to remove all the starch from the outside, this way potatoes are less likely to stick together. Now soak potatoes in cold water, add some ice and put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. \n\nSoaking potatoes in water before frying is a secret of crispy potatoes. \n\nNow, dry potatoes well with paper or kitchen towel. If you like your potatoes crispy, you want to avoid putting wet fries in an Air Fryer.  \n\nToss potatoes in the bowl with 1 \u00bd tablespoon of oil. I prefer to use Avocado oil. I have about 3 layers of potatoes in the basket. Cook for about 7 to 10 minutes at 375\u00b0F. If you have less potatoes, time needs to be adjusted. Remember to toss potatoes halfway . \n\nNow, take potatoes out, toss them in the bowl, add a bit more oil, salt, pepper and some spices of your choice. I am using paprika, garlic powder and this new pickle seasoning from Trader Joes. it will add a nice kick to the fries. \n\nToss it well and send it to an Air Fryer for another 7 to 10 minutes at 400\u00b0F, toss a few times in the process so everything is cooking evenly. Final product should be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\n**Step#2 Making beer battered fish**\n\nFor fish and chips you can use pretty much any white fish such as cod, halibut, pollock or haddock. \n\nToday I am using frozen cod which is more traditional for this recipe. \n\nTake fish straight from the fridge. Dry it well with the paper towel. \n\nWe need 3 medium size containers to deep the fish in the coatings.  \n\nContainer #1:  1 \u00bd cup of all purpose flour. You can also use rice flour which is supposed to add more crispines. Mix in sugar, salt and pepper. \n\nContainer#2: We will use it to make coating batter. Sift flour and mix it up with 1 egg. Slowly mix in beer to get batter to desired consistency. It needs to be heavy, not too liquidy. And yes, you can drink it too, Cheers! \n\nContainer#3: Mix breadcrumbs with some salt and pepper. This last layer will add some nice crispiness to the fish. \n\nNow coat fish with flour, then beer batter and finish with breadcrumbs. To avoid mess I recommend using a fork to dip fish in the coatings\u2026..I personally forget to do that and create a lot of mess.  Spray fish with the oil on all sides and send it to the air fryer for \\~10min at 375-400\u00b0F ( or until internal temperature is 145\u00b0F )  and gently flip half way. Also remember to spray some oil on the Air Fryer basket. Don't overcrowd the fish and do it in a few batches. \n\nAll done, it is crispy on the outside and nice and flaky on the inside. \n\n**Step#3 final step, making Tartar sauce**  \n\nMix well all the ingredients listed in the description and it is all done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/v65wth/fish_and_chips_in_the_air_fryer_easy_recipe_and/", "created_utc": 1654528739.0, "score": 22, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/v65wth/fish_and_chips_in_the_air_fryer_easy_recipe_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Perfect Scones Every Time! Fit For Royalty!! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude3b", "selftext": "Scones! No matter how you pronounce scones, or whether you prefer jam first or clotted cream first, scones are the cornerstone of every afternoon tea!   \n\n\nScones are so wonderfully British! They're the perfect treat to enjoy on warm summer days, in celebration of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, or just alongside a really good cup of tea!   \n\n\nIf you're a visual learner, check out my scone recipe video here! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpZWVtw95fg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpZWVtw95fg)\n\n  \n\\-----\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 400g '00' flour (also known as pasta flour!)\n* 115g butter, frozen and grated\n* 1 egg\n* 175ml whole milk\n* 80g caster sugar\n* 20g baking powder\n* 1/2 tsp. salt\n\nOptional, but recommended:\n\n* Lots of clotted cream!\n* Lots of jam!! \n\n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Into a large bowl, sieve 400g \u201800\u2019 flour, 20g baking powder and \u00bd tsp. salt. \u201800\u2019 flour is typically reserved for pasta, but it results in the lightest and fluffiest scones! If you don\u2019t have \u201800\u2019 flour at hand, you can use plain flour, but they won\u2019t be as fluffy.\n\n2. Add 115g of grated butter to your flour mix. I highly recommend freezing your butter overnight, as this makes grating it a lot easier! Using your fingertips, rub the butter and flour together until you have a cohesive sand-like consistency throughout. It\u2019s okay if some butter is still showing within the flour!\n\n3. Add in 80g caster sugar and stir to combine. This is also the time to add in any dried fruits \u2013 if you\u2019d like! I\u2019d recommend up to 50g of your chosen dried fruit. No caster sugar? Superfine sugar works well, or you can use granulated sugar, but give it a few pulses in a food processor first!\n\n4. Add in 175ml of whole milk and gently combine with a wooden spoon. You just want the milk to absorb into the flour to form a soft and shaggy dough. You don\u2019t want to over mix at this point! \n\n5. Now cover your bowl with cling film (saran wrap) and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.\n\n6. Dust your work surface with flour and turn out your dough! Using the heat of your hands, bring the dough together into a roll-able consistency. I like to pat mine into a large flat square, which I then divide into 4 smaller equal squares. Stack the squares of dough on top of each other, squish them down and then gently roll out into a 2cm thick flat square. This technique helps create a nice flaky finish to your scones and is similar to pastry lamination!\n\n7. Use a 5.5 \u2013 6.5cm diameter cutter to cut out your scones. Place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Unlike most bakes, I recommend placing your scones close together, albeit not touching! Once you\u2019ve cut out your first batch of scones, you\u2019ll want to bring the remaining dough back together into a square shape, cut into 4 equal sized smaller squares, stack, squish and roll out again! Then cut out your second batch of scones.\n\n8. In a small bowl, whisk up one egg and brush this onto the tops of your scones!\n\n9. Let your scones rest for another 30 minutes, uncovered. Preheat your oven to 220C (425F)\n\n10. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden on top! Let them cool, and enjoy!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you pronounce scones? 'S-cone' or 'Sc-on'? Also, jam first or cream first? Tell me in the comments below! If you have any other questions, free free to ask!! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b \n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/v40h4x/perfect_scones_every_time_fit_for_royalty/", "created_utc": 1654266060.0, "score": 33, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/v40h4x/perfect_scones_every_time_fit_for_royalty/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "How to make the softest and fluffiest homemade brioche burger buns", "selftext": "Does anyone agree with me that we all love hamburgers but it\u2019d be way better with a brioche bun than regular hamburger buns. I\u2019m bringing you the only brioche buns recipe you need today to make the softest, fluffy and buttery brioche burger buns at home. All of these simple ingredients might already have in your pantry so I hope you give a try soon.\n\n[Full recipe and how to make the best brioche buns here:](https://youtu.be/iWOhtIS6Mf4)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 330g bread flour\n* 150g milk (lukewarm)\n* 30g sugar\n* 5g yeast\n* 1 large egg (room temperature)\n* \u00bd tsp salt\n* 70g unsalted butter\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Pour 150g warm milk and crack 1 large egg (room temperature) to a large bowl, add in 30g sugar and 5g yeast. Stir until sugar and yeast are dissolved.\n2. Add in the same bowl 330g bread flour. Roughly mix until all of ingredients are combined. Gently knead the dough for 2-3 mins, then cover and let it rest for 20 minutes.\n3. After 20 minutes, gluten has started to form so it\u2019s easier to knead by now. If you use stand mixer, add the dough and 70g butter (divide to 2-3 times) to knead for 12- 15 minutes or until the dough is elastic and pass windowpane test. If kneading by hands, add in 70g butter and knead until the butter is melted and knead for 12- 15 minutes until the dough is smooth and stretchable.\n4. Form into a smooth round ball, cover and let the dough proof for 1 \u2013 1hour and 20 minutes in room temperature or until double in size.\n5. Deflate and get all of the air bubbles out, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. Make the dough into small round balls, put into a large baking tray to proof for another 50 minutes \u2013 1 hour until double in size.\n6. Prepare egg wash: 1 large egg yolk, 1 tbsp milk, brush all of the brioche buns with egg wash. Sprinkle with sesame seeds (optional)\n7. Bake in preheated oven at 375F for 13- 15 minutes or until dark golden brown. Cool the brioche buns in a cooling rack.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* If you want to use milk and egg straight out of fridge, mix them up and microwave for 40-45 seconds in the microwave to make it lukewarm.\n* Brioche buns have more butter than usual buns, so the kneading time might be a bit longer than usual buns.\n* Brioche hamburger buns can be stored in the freezer for 3 months.

{"title": "Easy Recipe of Hungarian Goulash in Instant Pot or Dutch Oven.", "selftext": "After making a very traditional Hungarian dish called Chicken Paprikash a few weeks ago, I have received multiple requests to make another even more famous classic Hungarian dish called Goulash.  \n\n**Ingredients: ( as a stew or soup \\~5; in combination with noodles or dumplings 7-8 )** \n\n* Stew beef - 3 lb\n* Onions ( chopped, medium size ) - 2 pcs\n* Bell peppers ( chopped ) - 2pcs\n* Garlic ( minced ) - 5-6 cloves \n* Carrots ( chopped, medium size ) - 2pcs\n* Potatoes ( cut on 1\u201d cubes, medium size ) - 5pcs \n* Avocado or olive oil ( to brown meat and saute vegetables ) - 2 tablespoons \n* Hungarian paprika ( sweet ) - \u00bc cup ( feel free to add even more if you like ) \n* Beef stock - 2 \u00bd - 3 cups ( if you want more soupy texture, add 1 more cup ) \n* Diced tomatoes - 1 can ( 14.5oz )\n* Salt and pepper - season meat and + to taste \n* Flour - 2 tablespoons ( mixed with 1 tablespoon of water ), alternatively use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch \n* Caraway seeds ( optional ) - 1 teaspoon \n* To garnish:  parsley and sour cream\n\nServe with: with fresh bread as a stew or soup, or with noodles, potatoes, or spaetzle  \n\n**If you are visual learner, I have step by step video recipe + cooking tips:**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Kxe3nC0IA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Kxe3nC0IA) \n\n**Step #1** \n\nChop onions, bell peppers and carrots. Mince garlic and cut potatoes on 1 inch cubes. \n\nTurn on Instant Pot to saute mode, add some oil and brown the meat in batches. Season the meat in the process. Cook for about 5 minutes, just to brown, no need to cook it through. \n\nWhen browned, remove the meat from the Instant Pot. \n\nAdd remaining oil to the pan and saute onions and peppers until onions are translucent. Now add garlic and saute for another minute. \n\nAdd a little bit of beef broth and deglaze Instant Pot. Always remember to deglaze after sauteing and before pressure cooking to avoid burn message on your Instant Pot. \n\nNow, turn off your Instant Pot. \n\n**Step #2**\n\nNow you can add remaining ingredients to the pot except flour. I added 2 \u00bd cups of broth, but if you want to make a more soupy texture of this dish add 3 \u00bd or even 4 cups of broth instead. \n\nFor this recipe use original sweet Hungarian paprika which has a nice, rich and sweet red pepper flavor. \n\nPro tip: Never put paprika in a very hot pot, paprika burns very easily and will become bitter. So add it to a cooler pot or to a liquid.   \n\nNow, close the lid, turn on Instant Pot on high pressure for 25 minutes. Allow Instant Pot to release pressure naturally for about 15 minutes, and then release remaining pressure manually.  \n\nTaste to see if you need to add more salt.  \n\nAnd finally, if you want to thicken the sauce, turn on saute mode, add flour or cornstarch mixture and simmer it for about 5-7 minutes or until sauce thickens.   \n\nYou can serve it with fresh bread as a stew or a soup, or with noodles, potatoes, or Hungarian dumplings. \n\nNow, if you don\u2019t have an instant pot and want to make this dish in a dutch oven, the process is almost the same. For the Dutch oven I will need to add more broth, about 5 cups, since during the long simmering process a lot of liquid will evaporate.  Simmer meat in a broth with spices for about 40 minutes and then add potatoes and carrots and simmer for another 40 minutes or until beef is nice and tender.\n\nSo for this recipe using instant pot I was able to save myself about 30-40 minutes in cooking time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/uz62mh/easy_recipe_of_hungarian_goulash_in_instant_pot/", "created_utc": 1653680480.0, "score": 8, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/uz62mh/easy_recipe_of_hungarian_goulash_in_instant_pot/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

A mixture of quality veal, pork mince and beef mince, combined with good sprinkling of parsley, breadcrumbs, and parmesan cheese, results in the most delicious and moist Italian meatballs you've ever had!  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re a visual learner, you can watch my recipe video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhNkvgpyps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhNkvgpyps)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n800g ground veal  \n800g ground beef  \n400g ground pork  \n4 eggs  \n240g parmesan cheese, grated  \n340g breadcrumbs  \n2 tsp. onion flakes  \n4 tsp. garlic powder  \n2 tsp. salt  \n8 tsp. parsley, finely chopped  \n220ml milk  \nolive oil, for hands/rolling\n\n\\-----  \n\n\n**Method**\n\n1. To a large bowl, add 800g ground veal, 800g ground beef and 400g ground pork. Give this a thorough mix by hand until all the meats are fully combined! \n\n2. Finely chop your parsley and add it to your meat mixture, along with 4 eggs, 2 tsp. onion flakes, 4 tsp. garlic powder, 2 tsp. salt, 240g parmesan cheese (grated), 340g breadcrumbs and 220ml milk. Thoroughly combine these ingredients altogether. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when the mixture is cohesive in colour throughout!\n\n3. I\u2019d recommend cooking a small amount of your mixture in a frying pan, to check to see if it needs any additional seasonings. A great tip is to flatten the meat in the frying pan, so it cooks quicker! Adjust to your taste.\n\n4. Preheat your oven to 180C | 350F.\n\n5. Pour some olive oil into a small bowl and dip your fingers into it before you begin rolling your meatballs. Squeeze the mixture tightly in your hands, otherwise you run the risk of your meatball falling apart whilst baking! I usually make my meatballs approx. 2\u201d in diameter \u2013 between a golf ball and a tennis ball!\n\n6. Place on a baking tray and cook for 45 minutes, or until they have a nice golden crust on top.\n\n7. And enjoy!! I like to place my meatballs into a rich, homemade tomato sauce for a minimum of 20-30 minutes to absorb additional flavours, and then I serve with my favourite pasta and a generous grating of parmesan!  \n\n\n**Storage:**\n\n**This recipe makes a lot of meatballs!** Meatballs need to be stored raw; not after cooking. Store your raw meatballs by lining a baking tray with parchment paper, placing the meatballs onto the paper, and then freeze them for 12 hours. Once 12 hours has elapsed, transfer the meatballs into zip lock bag and they will keep for up to 2 months. I\u2019d recommend writing the date you made the meatballs on the side of the bag!\n\n**Cooking from Frozen:**\n\nBake in the oven at 180C | 375F for 45 minutes, then transfer to a tomato sauce and cook for a further 20-30 minutes \u2013 and enjoy!  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a firm favourite and has been passed down through generations of my family. Give these Italian meatballs a try and I bet they will become a favourite with your family too!

Leeks have an onion flavor, but much milder. When cooked, it becomes sweeter and gives a buttery flavor. \n\nNow, turn on saute mode in Instant Pot, add olive oil and simmer peppers and leeks until softened ( about 6-7 minutes ) and then add minced garlic and simmer for another minute. \n\nAdd a can of diced tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook for another few minutes. \n\nNow turn off saute mode.\n\nAlways remember to deglaze your instant pot after sauteeing and before pressure cooking. \n\nNow, rinse the rice really well, you need to remove all the starch so the rice doesn't get too sticky. You want to use short grain rice for paella, as it is great to absorb flavor from all the spices in this dish. \n\nNow you can throw the rest of the ingredients in the instant pot. A big plus of this recipe is that in 25 minutes your dish is ready, all ingredients go in almost at the same time. \n\nTypically seafood cooks really fast\n\nSince everything is cooked at the same time, **the key for this recipe** is to use frozen seafood ingredients, this way seafood doesn\u2019t overcook in the pressure cooker\u2026.  Alternatively you can use non frozen ingredients, but it will require cooking seafood in a separate step. I am going for simplicity in this recipe. \n\nSaffron is a key spice which adds a nice flavor to paella, however if you for some reason are out of it, don\u2019t get too upset, replace it with ground turmeric, it will add a nice golden color to the dish. \n\nAfter you put all remaining ingredients in the instant pot, close the lid, select the rice setting ( which is between 10 - 12 minutes ). \n\nSpanish cuisine is not spicy, but personally I like to add some kick to most of my recipes ( so adding red pepper flakes and chile pepper is optional ) \n\nAfter time is up, let it naturally release for 10 minutes and then release remaining pressure and turn off Instant Pot. \n\nYour dish is ready\u2026.it looks and tastes amazing.

Invert cake onto a wire rack over waxed paper.  \nFor sauce, combine the sugar, butter and water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat just until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Remove from the heat; stir in extracts.  \nPoke holes in the top of the warm cake; spoon 1/4 cup sauce over cake. Let stand until sauce is absorbed. Repeat twice. Poke holes into sides of cake; brush remaining sauce over sides. Cool completely.  \nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/uwy9hv/kentucky_butter_cake_a_recipe_you_dont_wanna_miss/", "created_utc": 1653418877.0, "score": 106, "author": "marie-buckland", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/uwy9hv/kentucky_butter_cake_a_recipe_you_dont_wanna_miss/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Easy Comfort Food Recipe", "selftext": "Today I will be making a very famous and traditional Hungarian comfort food called Chicken Paprikash. \n\n**If you are visual learner, check out step by step video recipe + useful cooking tips:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKTBHYf8wAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKTBHYf8wAk) \n\n**Ingredients: ( servings 8-10 )**\n\n* Chicken thighs ( bone-in & skin-on ) - 4pcs ( you can use other chicken parts as well )   \n* Chicken drumsticks - 6pcs ( you can use other chicken parts as well )   \n* Yellow onion ( diced ) - 2pcs\n* Garlic ( minced ) - 5 cloves\n* Tomato paste - 2 tablespoons\n* Sweet paprika ( sweet Hungarian paprika ) - \u00bc cup \n* Smoked paprika - 1 teaspoon \n* Hot paprika & pepper flakes - \u00bd  teaspoon of each **( only if you like spicy )** \n* Chicken broth - 2 \u00bd cups \n* Sour cream - 1 cup ( room temperature ) \n* Kosher salt & black ground pepper - to season chicken + to taste. \n* Avocado or any frying oil - 2 tablespoons ( for frying ) \n* Corn starch - 2 tablespoons ( mixed with 2 tablespoons of cold water ) \n\nFor decoration: some chopped cilantro or chives. \n\nTo serve: egg noodles, Hungarian dumplings ( nokedli ), mashed potatoes or rice.   \n\n**Step #1**\n\nDice onions and mince garlic.  \n\nSeason chicken with salt and pepper. \n\nTurn on Instant Pot to Saute mode, add a little bit of oil and brown chicken on both sides.   \n\nTake out the chicken in a separate plate, add a little more oil if needed and saute onions for 3-4 minutes or until translucent, then stir in garlic and tomato paste and cook for another minute. \n\nAfter sauteing and before pressure cooking, we always need to deglaze the instant pot. Add \u00bd cup of chicken broth ( or other liquid ) and using a silicon or wooden spatula scrape everything from the bottom. This step will help to avoid the burn message on the Instant Pot. \n\nNow, you can turn off saute mode. \n\n**Step #2**\n\nAdd paprika. Make sure to use fresh high quality paprika since it is the main ingredient of this dish. Ideally try to find sweet Hungarian paprika which has a nice rich sweet pepper flavor. It is not traditional, but I like to make this dish a bit spicy by adding some hot and smoked paprika and even some red pepper flakes ( but this is optional ). \n\nNow, add chicken broth and place chicken back into the pot. Close the lid and set Instant Pot to 15 minutes on high pressure.  Once cook time ends, allow natural release for 10 minutes, then remove remaining pressure and open up the lid. \n\n**Step #3** \n\nTake the chicken out to the serving plate. Taste the sauce to see if it needs more salt or pepper. Now, we need to thicken the sauce. \n\nMix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water, mix it well and add it to the Instant Pot. turn on Saute mode and let it simmer for about 3-5 minutes or until sauce thickens. \n\nTurn off saute mode and stir in 1 cup of room temperature sour cream right before serving. \n\nYou can serve it with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/uu914w/how_to_make_chicken_paprikash_in_instant_or_pot/", "created_utc": 1653084557.0, "score": 27, "author": "Barbos_17", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/uu914w/how_to_make_chicken_paprikash_in_instant_or_pot/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "My Italian Mom's Eggplant Parmigiana! (Eggplant Parmesan!) \ud83c\udf46\ud83e\uddc0", "selftext": "Eggplant parmigiana, also known as eggplant parmesan, is a vegetarian lasagna that's made with thin slices of eggplant (in place of the pasta!), a beautifully rich tomato sauce, and plenty of molten mozzarella and parmesan cheese!  \ud83c\udf46\ud83e\uddc0 \n\nThis is my wife's Mom's recipe, and she shows you how to make this the traditional way by frying the eggplant. However we also mention how to bake them too, in case you want to make this dish a little healthier! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\n\nIf you're a visual learner, her recipe video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuXpyUv7bE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDuXpyUv7bE)\n\n\\-----  \n**Ingredients**\n\n500g flour (all purpose or plain)  \n3 medium eggplants (aubergines)  \n20g (3 1/2 tsp.) salt  \n2g (1/4 tsp.) pepper  \n200g parmesan cheese  \n500g mozzarella, grated or cubed  \n1 litre tomato sauce  \nvegetable oil, for frying  \n**This recipe serves 4-6 people!**  \n\\-----\n\n**Method**\n\n1. Chop your 3 eggplants into 1cm thin slices and lay the cutlets out on a large, clean kitchen towel. Discard the top and bottom pieces of the eggplant. Once your eggplant cutlets are all laid out, sprinkle some salt over them to help draw out the moisture in preparation for dredging. Your eggplant cutlets will brown due to oxidisation; this is fine!\n\n2. To a bowl, add 500g all purpose or plain flour, 20g salt and 2g pepper. Give this a stir to combine. Dredge your eggplant cutlets by placing them into the flour mix, thoroughly covering both sides. Place your flour-covered cutlets onto a baking tray in preparation for frying or baking! Important: Don\u2019t let the cutlets overlap; they\u2019ll stick to each other!\n\n3. Cook your eggplant cutlets ...\n\n**Option 1 - Frying (Traditional):** Fill a large saut\u00e9 pan with vegetable oil - approximately 1 inch deep \u2013 and bring up to temperature. How do you know when the oil is hot enough? Simply sprinkle some flour into the oil and it should \u2018crackle\u2019! That means it\u2019s hot enough to begin cooking your eggplant cutlets! Carefully place your cutlets into the oil away from you to prevent splash back. Once you see browning on the edges, flip the cutlets over. It\u2019ll take a few minutes each side for the eggplant to cook! Once brown on both sides, remove from the oil and place onto a tray lined with kitchen roll. The kitchen roll will help soak up any excess oil.\n\n**Option 2 \u2013 Baking (Healthier):** Bake your eggplant cutlets in the oven at 220C | 425F until they look crispy and golden brown.\n\n4. Let\u2019s assemble! Add a thin layer of tomato sauce to the bottom of your baking dish. Now add a layer of your eggplant slices, making sure they overlap and cover the majority of the sauce. If you need to cut or break some of the slices to make them fit, that\u2019s fine! Push down on the completed layer of eggplants.\n\n5. Add another layer of sauce, but more so than the first layer. Then generously sprinkle with mozzarella and parmesan! Add another layer of eggplant slices, cover with more tomato sauce and then sprinkle on more mozzarella and parmesan.\n\n6. Continue building in this order until you run of out of space \u2013 or ingredients!\n\n7. Cover your baking dish with aluminium foil and bake in a preheated oven for 45 minutes at 180C | 350F. With 10 minutes left on the timer, remove the foil to crisp up that top layer of cheese!\n\n8. Remove from the oven and let your eggplant parmigiana cool for around 10-15 minutes.\n\n9. Serve and enjoy!  \n\n\nIf you have any questions about this recipe, please do feel free to ask below!! We really hope you enjoy this recipe!  \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b \n\nDani, Gordon & Kiki - Black Cat Kitchen", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/uu2bam/my_italian_moms_eggplant_parmigiana_eggplant/", "created_utc": 1653066276.0, "score": 145, "author": "BlackCatKitchen", "num_comments": 24, "permalink": "/r/easyrecipes/comments/uu2bam/my_italian_moms_eggplant_parmigiana_eggplant/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
