{"title": "New Karen neighbor tried to destroy my water line", "selftext": "So I got notice in October that my apartment was raising my rent $200 in a single year come December. I like renting. Genuinely. \"Hey my water heater is broken.\" Come home and it's fixed. Never had a problem, but a 20%rise in rent in one year? Not doing that.\n\nThe morning I opened up the rent increase notice I happened to see a cute manufactured home with a for sale sign on my way to work. I pulled it up on my phone and called the realtor. This was Monday, she indicated the sellers didn't want it shown until Wednesday and we scheduled a showing. I put in an offer the next day and they accepted 10 minutes later. YAY!! Signed and closed 10 days later. It was an incredibly easy transaction/process and that made me very happy.\n\nWell on my move-in day in early November the retiree neighbor on my left comes up to me while I'm helping the movers move my stuff and the first words out of her mouth were \"are you going to do anything about these leaves that keep blowing into my yard from yours?\" \n\nEventually it came to a head where I told her \"I understand that you like to keep your lawn tidy. Can you at least try to understand that I have been working 60 and 70 hour weeks while moving and I am doing my very best\". The property management company that runs the park straight up told me I was in the clear and not in violation of anything.\n\nI've had no contact since with her when she realized I'm not going to capitulate to her.\n\nThis most recent Friday when we had frigid temperatures and high winds in the evening I flush my toilet and I realize it isn't refilling. I test my taps. No water. It's already too dark so I go to the store to get water for me and the cats. In the morning once it's light out i put on my coveralls and head out into the -3\u00b0f (-22\u00b0f windchill) and investigate. \n\nThe water supply comes out of the ground outside of the trailer skirt then goes through the skirt to the supply. The previous owners had built a well-insulated box around the water supply, but the access hatch was unlocked and cracked open. \n*sigh* I call my father and tell him I need to borrow his heat gun. He offers to drive it over but the weather is so bad with blowing snow I told him even in his truck he'd get stuck so I went trekking over there.\n\nI'm fuming the whole way. I could have sworn I latched that door when I was checking my winterizing list. I could have sworn. Eventually after 15 minutes of using the heat gun the water started flowing. I get back inside and get under my blankets to get warm after being in the arctic conditions for nearly 2 hours at that point.\n\nI still can't get over it. I KNOW I latched the door. So on a whim I propped my laptop in the window and set it up to video record and went on with my day.\n\nI woke up Sunday morning to temperatures of -7\u00b0f (-33\u00b0f windchill) and go to fill up the cat's water bowl. No water. WTF!!! I Put on my coveralls and head out, the access door was cracked open again! I get the heat gun out again and get the water going again. So I check my laptop and not 2 hours after I started the laptop recording the neighbor Karin comes waddling across her driveway and walks over to my trailer and leans over by the water and messes with the door before waddling back to her trailer.\n\nI get my coat on and walk over there with my laptop. When she answers \"Oh hi [my name], what brings you over today?\" All cheery and two-faced. I just open my laptop without saying a word and hit play. She just starts stuttering trying to come up with some bullshit. I just interrupt her and tell her I'll be forwarding it to the office and walked away.\n\nMonday the office called me and told me they will be addressing the issue and it would be incredibly helpful if there was a police report. I gladly called the non-emergency line and scheduled a time for an officer to come out after work. They cops were pulling up just as I was walking home. We came in and I detailed everything and showed them the video. They wanted a copy so I gave it to them. They asked me to show them the water line so we head out around there. They took some photos while we were out there. The whole time we were out there Karen was looking out her kitchen window. They see she's home as well and offer to trespass her. I head back in and they eventually come knock telling me they spoke to her and trespassed her, gave me a copy of the police report number and forwarded it to the office.\n\nWhile we were out there a neighbor couple across the street were out and asked me if everything was OK. I said it was, that I had video proof that Karen had actually opened my water access to freeze my pipes. Their eyes went wide. Their cover over the water line was also removed (broken off) and his water line froze too on Friday and the repairs were broken again on Saturday. Turns out Karen has an ongoing beef with them because they have a pride flag they refuse to take down. So the police went over there to get their statements too.\n\nKaren's husband came home an hour ago, came over shortly after to ask me to retract my complaint against them with the office as a \"misunderstanding\".\n\nMisunderstanding? Your fucking wife was intending to destroy my water lines in the middle of a winter storm which would have cost me thousands of dollars to fix. He pulls out his checkbook \"So what's this going to cost me?\"  \"Well, I bought the place for $40 thousand, so let's call it an even 45 thousand and I'll straight up tell the office i fabricated the whole thing.\" He said he was serious. I said I was too. He says they're on the verge of being evicted and kicked off the lot and she '*has problems*'. \"Sounds like the neighbors and I should go in on a bunch of security cameras to ensure that happens then\"\n\nSo we'll see. I wasn't going to set up my server, but I'm going to be doing that tonight with a couple of my Webcams on some raspberry pi computers. I just can't trust this woman.\n\nAll because of some fucking leaves, and a gay pride flag.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1982qb5/new_karen_neighbor_tried_to_destroy_my_water_line/", "created_utc": 1705411180.0, "score": 3902, "author": "None", "num_comments": 489, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1982qb5/new_karen_neighbor_tried_to_destroy_my_water_line/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "This is your reminder to reseal your grout minimum once a year", "selftext": "Hi howdy folks, resident tile&grout almost expert here who shifted careers to go into the construction defect industry. Which means I see a lot of fucked up houses.\n\nThe easiest fastest way I see homes need to be gutted isn't catastrophies. It's not fires or asbestos or earthquakes. \n\nIt's people getting mold because they don't spend $15 to reseal their grout.\n\nThey don't know they even need to reseal grout. Then the water wears away the sealant, seeps through the now exposed grout, grows a flourishing mold colony that the homeowners scrub and bleach and remove on the surface while it eats their homes away from the backside.\n\nThey had no idea their grout getting wet was a bad sign. When you flick water onto grout, it's SUPPOSED to bead up. If it absorbs in, you need more grout sealant reapplied. \n\nGrout sealant comes in a handy dandy spray you can pick up at any supply store or online. I don't have brand recommendations and I'm loyal to no product except the one I can grab closest to the door. With inflation it's like $15 near me so even though everything's more expensive that's a hell of a lot cheaper than ripping out your entire bathroom to the studs.\n\nGO CHECK YOUR GROUT. NOW. Flick some water onto it. Everywhere you have grout, flick flick flick.\n\nThose of you with unused guest bathrooms probably discovered that some of your grout is totally watertight still while you master bathroom has no sealant left.\n\nSealant wears away with water, so obviously the more frequently a place gets wet the more you need to reseal. My thread title is a filthy lie btw. For most master bathrooms it can need to be refreshed in as little as six months. A year is really pushing it. But for your kitchen backsplash you could probably get away with idk 3,4 years? Maybe even longer depending on the acidity of the disinfectant spray you use every so often on your backsplash.\n\nLook at me. Look at me dead in the eye. I am a lazy bastard. I am a terrible homeowner. I deliberately don't have grass not because it's cool trendy xeriscaping but because I knew I couldn't be fucked to mow.\n\nEven I can keep up with how easy it is to maintain grout. And that my friends is SAYING something.\n\nStep 1: Clean your surfaces. Use mold killer. Do you not see mold? Use mold killer anyways. I hate mold. Murder those spores just in case some of those bastards can reactivate if your sealant wears away slightly too fast.\n\nStep 2: Read the instructions on your bottle of grout sealant and follow that. I use the spray bottle stuff so my instructions are spritz it on the grout and wipe off the excess. If you don't get all of it wiped off, not a big deal because it'll wear off eventually. Worst thing that'll happen is you'll have some streaky tile for half a year. If that drives you nuts then just be sure to wipe it off before it sets. You can use a paper towel, don't be fooled with YouTube videos showing sponges and whatnot. Those are construction guys who have those giant sponges anyways so they put that in the video because it's already in their house. You can just use paper towels and not buy a sponge the size of your head you'll never use again. \n\nStep 3: You're literally done. When bored throughout the year keep flicking water on your grout lines including the tricky spots. This'll help you spot when it's beginning to need a refresh, the water won't seep in but the water beads might be less defined. If it doesn't look as round as Ghibli tears then it's on the edge of needing another spritz.\n\nThat's it. I just saved you potential hospital bills and gutting your house. Thank me by actually sealing your grout so I never have to take another easily avoided mold litigation case again.

Everything seemed to be working as far as I could tell (no leaking, no smell of gas, ignitor was functioning, etc.) so I chalked it up to just maybe needing to be replaced due to age- it's a 10 year old unit, they usually last 8-12 years... I wasn't excited to spend like $2600 on a new water heater, but shit happens.  \n\nI work in facilities, so I mentioned it to a couple of my coworkers at work yesterday. They said they'd pop over on their lunch break to see if they could trouble-shoot the unit. So I end up with an electrician, a plumber, and a maintenance mechanic in my (extremely messy) basement. They looked at it for all of 5 minutes before saying \"looks like the exhaust isn't working\". One of them pointed at the exhaust pipe and followed it outside to see if it was blocked by anything.  \n\nAs SOON as my coworker said that, I looked at the pipe and thought, omg that goes into our backyard... We've been spending more time outside because the weather is getting nice again... I saw our kid putzing around by the exhaust vent the other day while I was doing yard work... *lightbulb moment*. I told my coworkers, I think my kid has been putting rocks in that pipe.  \n\nAnd sure enough- they disconnect the vent from the water heater, hooked my shop vac up to it and used the blower feature... I shit you not, like 8 rocks SHOOT out of the side of our house.  \n\nOur water heater works just fine. It took all of 5 minutes to fix. And now I have a very funny story, and a pipe cover to make sure this doesn't happen again.

This will give you, proof of purchase/ownership, the serial number, and the date of purchase so you can pull up the price if needed.

{"title": "[Update] Karen who tried to destroy my water pipes", "selftext": "So I posted about my neighbor deliberately trying to freeze my pipes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1982qb5/new_karen_neighbor_tried_to_destroy_my_water_line/\n\nCliff notes. Grandmother Karen got upset about leaves blowing over from my lot onto her lot during my purchasing of the home. She deliberately tried to freeze my pipes during a snow storm.\n\nWell it's been interesting. I installed 4 cameras, one on each corner of my trailer and one in my covered porch. I took my other cameras and installed them over at the neighbors across the street who had their water line frozen too (most likely by Karen as well. She watched me install them from her kitchen window and waddled over a little later to look at them and flip me off. She keeps flipping the cameras off.\n\nTrash day last week she cheerfully asked me to help her move her trash cans to the curb when I was walking by with my groceries. I'll admit I snorted and was petty. I put my groceries down and went to every lot on the street and pulled their trash to the curb except for hers.\n\nThe nice old lady across the street invited me to Rummikub night. At first I declined. She said they were going to dish about Karen. I said I already had my shoes off and that I was in for the night. \"We drink wine, smoke pot and play rummikub\". Ok. I'll get my shoes.\n\nThese ladies were AWESOME. New friends acquired. I got all the gossip about Karen and my head was spinning after it all so some highlights.\n\nKaren has 4 adult children. Her 3 daughters haven't spoken to her in more than 12 years. The last daughter to speak to her actually lived on the other side of my place but they has a falling out so huge her daughter sold her home and moved across town to get away from her. Her son is the only one in the family speaking to her.\n\nKaren used to be part of another monthly gathering/social of a bunch of retirees in the community but she was kicked out after she kept going on tirades about the guy who owned my place before and harassing a gay couple that lived on the street.\n\nThe beef she had with the previous owner of my place started over, of all things, yard waste. Grass clippings to be exact, so at least she's reliable I suppose. It also explains her deal with the leaves. In response to her bullshit about him leaving grass clippings on the lawn he also stopped raking up leaves. So that explains that in a way.\n\nIn short she's just a toxic AF old woman who gets off on starting shit with her neighbors.\n\n And her husband paying people off is also apparently a theme as well as he tried to do with me. The most egregious that made my blood boil just hearing it: A few years ago she got off on this rant about a young guy in the park walking his dog twice every day. She kept going on about \"he better not let that dog shit in my grass\". Well one day the dog decided to relieve itself there and as the guy was picking up his dog's waste she maced both of them with pepper spray. Hubby paid the guy off. \n\nThe lady hosting Rummy night talks to Karen. She says that Karen was bitching about me putting up cameras and how gauche it makes the neighborhood look. After taking a literal bong rip (these ladies are fucking awesome) she says \"So I says to her, Karen honey, if you're so worried about what's gauche you probably shouldn't have tried to freeze his pipes in the middle of the worst winter storm weve had this decade and then he wouldn't be installing cameras to protect his property\". Apparently Karen's response to that was that I should have taken care of my leaves.\n\nSo Karen hates grass clippings, leaves, gays and lesbians, and being a decent human being. She's been taken care of by her husband covering up her bullshit, and she's just so incredibly toxic that three of her own children don't speak to her or let her grandchildren see her. \n\nAs far as the property managers go I was assured \"they are taking this very seriously\" but cannot disclose what actions they are taking to me. Fortunately Karen can't help herself from gossiping or throwing herself under the bus, and after another bong rip the Rummy host told me that she received a letter from their lawyers with a correct or quit notice that any more complaints will result in an eviction. \n\nSo yeah. I'm looking forward to seeing how long she can last before getting evicted. But not as much as I'm looking forward to hosting these awesome old ladies this Friday. I'm going to teach them how to play Settlers of Catan!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1allosl/update_karen_who_tried_to_destroy_my_water_pipes/", "created_utc": 1707361555.0, "score": 1888, "author": "None", "num_comments": 129, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1allosl/update_karen_who_tried_to_destroy_my_water_pipes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "I think my neighbor is the reason our house was for sale\u2026", "selftext": "I (23 F) and my spouse (24 M) bought a house in a newer construction neighborhood. The neighborhood seemed quiet, clean and overall a nice place. To paint a picture, the houses are all close together and all the yards touch with privacy fences. About a month or two after moving in we noticed our neighbor behind us had a dog, the dog almost never went inside and if we went in our yard he\u2019d bark nonstop. I work a lot and different hours, when I\u2019d go to work and come home the dog would still be outside barking, even at 2 AM. One afternoon it was almost 100 degrees out and I can hear the dog panting and barking. I go up to the fence and try and get a look at him. The dog is sickly skinny and paces so vigorously around the yard that he\u2019s created a track of dirt around the perimeter. I give him some water under the fence because it looks like he has no food, water, or shelter. I chose to call animal control because I\u2019m concerned for his well being, I didn\u2019t even care about the barking. They come out and agree he doesn\u2019t look great and I hear nothing else from animal control from then on. A month passed, the dog is still there, and we have brought home a puppy. The dog paces our fence and pees all over it every time my puppy goes near it and still won\u2019t stop barking. One day the dog just disappears, idk what happened but he\u2019s gone. We think our issues have stopped, they haven\u2019t. \n\nRandomly trash is being thrown in our yard (chip bags, wrappers, a medication syringe) and we can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s coming from but it\u2019s concerning because our puppy tries to eat everything. The neighbors have children, they\u2019ve never bothered me and I don\u2019t care when they\u2019re playing in their yard. But all of a sudden they\u2019ve decided to put their trampoline right up against our fence, again, this doesn\u2019t bother me they\u2019re playing having fun whatever. But one day they decide they\u2019re going to climb up that trampoline and shout at my dog while he\u2019s in the yard. My dog is losing it jumping at the fence freaking out because they\u2019re leaning over into our yard. Then they start dangling things at him; toys, plastic bats, food and shouting at him. My husband politely asks them to stop because they\u2019re making our dog stressed out and they\u2019re going to get hurt like that. They ignore him, so he says again if you fall into the yard he\u2019s going to accidentally get you and you need to stop. Our dog isn\u2019t small he\u2019s 60 pounds at 8 months old and he doesn\u2019t like strangers. This doesn\u2019t phase them they continue so my husband threatens to call the police if they don\u2019t get off our fence. This gets them down for all of five minutes, so we bring our dog back in because he\u2019s getting more irritated. All of sudden the kids immediately go inside when they see the dog go in. We bring the dog back out to play and the kids immediately come back out and start doing it again. We have friends over and I\u2019m furious, everyone is irritated by them. I say to my friends some colorful words, well one of the kids starts screaming at us going \u201cSTOP CUSSING!!\u201d They say this over and over again so I tell them to mind their d*mn business and get in their own yard and they just continue so we all go inside. All day they continue to peer over our fence to see if our dog is outside. \n\nFast forward, our dog leaves for training for a month, we still see the kids peering over the fence but ignore it. I\u2019m watching my friend\u2019s dogs while they visit family. They\u2019re good dogs they like to relax all day and only want to be outside to potty. I let them out for not even two minutes and they start barking so I tell them no, bring them in and go back to my business. I let them out again and they start barking so I run out there immediately and I hear my neighbor screaming \u201cshut the f up!!!! Shut those f\u2019in dogs up!!!! Good thing I installed this camera back here\u201d and just continues ranting (I\u2019m pretty sure they were on the phone). It\u2019s 9 in the morning in the middle of the week, we don\u2019t have an HOA and we have no rules about noises. One of our other neighbors had a party the other night and the music was so loud I could hear (and feel) the bass through the windows, but I didn\u2019t hear anyone complain about that. I\u2019m livid, we haven\u2019t even lived here long and these neighbors are infuriating. None of our other neighbors bother us, but we do have another neighbor who has been frustrated by this same neighbor. We keep to ourselves and just want to be able to be in our own yard without an issue. This neighbor is not one who seems friendly enough to go speak to, as I said she was swearing at dogs for barking.

Both of their fences are on their property line. \n\nWe had planned on eventually fencing our backyard. And have talked to both Neighbor #1 and Neighbor #2 about just closing off our back yard.

You should put up your own fence on the side that borders our property.

{"title": "Can I keep the balls that my neighbor kicks into my yard?", "selftext": "My neighbor runs a soccer training business in his yard. I was already at my wit's end with this neighbor due to the obnoxious,  bass-thumping music he blasts outside all day long while he plays soccer. He also kicks soccer balls into my garden, smashes my flowers, and trespasses over my fence and onto my property to retrieve the balls every day. But the last straw occurred recently when he (or one of his students) bent the wire part of my fence to the ground to make it easier to trespass on my property to retrieve balls, and then left it that way. \n\nI have two dogs who could have escaped through this section of fence had I not noticed this. I tried messaging the neighbor, who I have already spoken to many times about the music, mentioning the damaged fence and asking him not to come on my property to retrieve balls, and said I would return them (he has at least 40 balls out there-- he can wait). \n\nHe completely ignored my message and has continued trespassing over the fence and onto my property. I hate to be that grouch, but the balls are hitting my house,  hurting my plants,  he damaged my fence,  is putting my dogs at risk,  and I have security footage of him coming within a foot of my house after dark to retrieve these fucking balls. \n\nCan I just start keeping the balls that come into my yard? He doesn't always retrieve them immediately,  so I'd probably have time to go grab them and take them inside. Would it be considered stealing, or is it fine because it's on my property and he's an asshole and deserves it? My stepmom suggested stabbing the balls and returning them deflated but I feel that may be taking it a bit too far lol\n\nHow would you all handle this?\n\n\nEDIT #1: \nSince it's been mentioned a lot,  there's already a 12 foot net behind the goal facing my property, and a 6 foot pvc fence on our property line. The problem is his yard is too small to be running a full scale soccer business. Balls are being kicked towards my yard, right at the property line, hundreds if not thousands of times per day. His yard does not have enough space to contain those balls, so he thinks he can just use mine. My front fence is just a simple, wire,  4ft fence with metal stakes. It wasn't expensive and it didn't cost me anything to bend it back into shape. My issue is the disrespect he showed in bending it to the ground and leaving it that way so my dogs could have escaped. I don't think I can send a bill for damages to the fence. \n\n\nEDIT #2:\nI looked into town zoning laws and I don't think it's legal for him to be running a business in this district. Even if he has a special permit for a recreation business, he's still supposed to keep noise and all other environmental impact within the boundary of his property. His property is simply not large enough to contain a business of this scale. I hesitated going to the town hall to confirm all of this because I didn't want to escalate the situation into hostile territory by trying to have his business shut down (after all, he's still going to be my neighbor afterwards) but if he's not going to respond to my polite, reasonable attempts to negotiate,  he may leave me no choice.

{"title": "I regret buying our \u201cdream house\u201d\n", "selftext": "3 years ago we bought a house in a HCOL area. I made the mistake of involving my parents in the house hunting process.\n\nIt was during the crazy time when people were offering 200 & 300K and more above asking so it was really hard to get an offer accepted. We would have 15 minutes to look at a house and then have to decide if we are going to make an offer.\u00a0\n\nLooking back we had no clue what we were doing, so of course we leaned on my parents to help us. Initially I went in wanting to buy a smaller home in the 700s price range about 20 minutes from a major city. WELL\u2026..they talked me into buying a MUCH larger home for over 1M in a more rural ( 1 hour from the city). They strongly pushed me into buying the home \"oh no this is the perfect house for you!\u201d \u201cIt can be your forever home!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret it so much if you buy a smaller house!!\u201d \"you have to get this house!\" \u00a0 They made it an emotional decision and did not paint any type of realistic picture of the reality of owning this home. Because of the low interest rate the mortgage was about the same that we paid in rent so it seemed like it made sense. I thought they knew better than me and let them convince me. Oh how naive I was back then!! Everything happened so quickly I really didn\u2019t a chance to even process it.\u00a0\n\nNow every single day.... I regret NOT buying that much smaller house 20 minutes from the city. Im angry with myself for going against my gut and what I originally wanted to do because now we are priced out of that area. Those homes have gone up much more than ours and we\u2019ve had to make so many repairs and things like adding solar (since our electricity is so high), 3 HVAC systems. The house is over 30 years old so a lot of things needed to be replaced.\u00a0Now it is a beautiful home in a nice area and partner loves the house. We would lose money if we moved plus we can\u2019t afford a house in those other areas.\n\nA lot of our friends and family live an hour away (we drive to see them all the time!) which we didn\u2019t think was a big deal but now we\u2019re realizing that most of them think we live too far since we\u2019re in a country area. They don\u2019t want to make the drive (or complain about it to other family members when they do) which also hurts my feelings. We bought this large house thinking everyone would be excited to come visit more often. I\u2019ve made some new friends too but they also all live at least 45 minutes away. The area we live doesn\u2019t have many young families - it\u2019s mostly older/retired folks.\u00a0\n\nPart of me just thinks I should shut up and be happy we even have a house. We both worked very hard for many years and received zero help from anyone to pay for it.\u00a0 My partner thinks it\u2019s fine and not to much to take care of and that any house would be a lot of work. Moving is NOT an option as we have had to invest heavily in the house and would\u00a0 lose money if we left now. We also can\u2019t afford to move at this point.\u00a0We do have a cleaner come 2x a month but we really can\u2019t afford to hire anymore help. We do mostly everything ourselves since everything home services has become so expensive.\u00a0\n\nBefore we had our baby I managed to upkeep everything but it\u2019s much harder now to keep things the way I like them to be. Everyday I find myself frustrated, overwhelmed, and regretful with everything which makes me depressed. I thought this was our dream house but I\u2019m really struggling to see that now. It\u2019s starting to impact our marriage and I don\u2019t want that.\u00a0\n\nWe are doing ok and can technically afford the house because we got such a good rate but everyday I think wow, WHY did we buy this huge house so far from everything??\u00a0\n\nIf my partner loses his job we are in trouble. We COULD HAVE saved so much money, paid our house off faster, and been much closer to everything. I\u2019ve realized my parents DO NOT make great financial decisions(as recently somethings have come to light) about and they influenced me and I feel so stupid about that. They\u2019re NOT the ones paying the mortgage - we are - so why did I let them talk me into such an expensive home??\n\nI NEED to figure out a way to move past these feelings but it\u2019s something I\u2019m having a really hard time with since it was such a huge purchase and changed everything about our entire life.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1ep0xor/i_regret_buying_our_dream_house/", "created_utc": 1723317260.0, "score": 1534, "author": "Humble-Ad8326", "num_comments": 624, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1ep0xor/i_regret_buying_our_dream_house/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I happened to get up when they were on the last strip and saw them mowing. I grabbed some cash for a tip and ran out to inform them of the mistake at that point.

They apologized for the reps behavior and offered a discounted rate if I chose to use their services in the future. Which after this hassle, I will not be doing.\n\nEdit again to add: I went outside to play with the dog during my lunch break.

This is all I know.\n\nMy daughter and I are quiet and keep to ourselves, my husband died in January and I am pretty much still in an active grief stage plus my daughter has a toddler.\n\nWe have a wooden fence around the back and sides, the front isn't fenced. I noticed on the ring the kid looked in my mailbox Saturday, my daughter laughed and said the parents are probably missing mail and sent him to check because it's less suspicious, that's the kind of thing you did to me. I agreed and we chuckled. Not really an issue, right?\n\nI just ran an errand, and came home and was outside in the backyard talking to my daughter about something. I got a notification of the ring going off twice and first ignored because all the dog walkers set it off (urban neighborhood, small yard.)\n\nI looked when it went off again. First the kid checked the mailbox. He's around maybe eight? Then, he rang the doorbell, gave it the finger and called me some pretty nasty names. What the hell do I do?\n\nI am literally completely stumped. Do I print a photo of the finger giving and write a note and give it to his parents when I see them? What on earth. I have literally had nothing to do with these people, they haven't been here for even a month and like I said, urban so there's people in and out of rentals all the time.\n\nI'm mind blown.

{"title": "Found out my neighbors moved their fence up to the backside of mine. How to approach?", "selftext": "About 8 months ago we surveyed our property and installed a 6 ft privacy fence. In our borough, we are allowed to build the fence up to our property line if we desire. To avoid encroaching or even feeling like we were encroaching on our neighbors, we left a ~3  foot wide perimeter around our fence away from our property line. We did this very specifically to also allow us easy access to behind the fence to correct any maintenance needs the fence may have. \n\nI just noticed today that very recently, the neighbor behind our fence, dug up their old fence posts in their yard (there was about a 4 foot passage between our fences) and moved their corner posts to butt right into our fences corners.

We had survey spikes still in the ground so they clearly just ignored those. I don\u2019t want their dog and their kid using my fence as it could be easily damaged. I very purposefully left 3 feet around my fence for a reason, and the fact they just did this without even asking has infuriated me. \n\nWe haven\u2019t talked to them since slightly before the fence went in, so I have no care to maintain any relationship with them. \n\nI am considering going over to their house tomorrow during the day and hoping to speak to the wife or husband. \n\nIs it wrong to tell them that I\u2019m giving them 2 weeks to remove the fence and return it to their property line? If they don\u2019t agree to return the fence to its rightful position, can I legally remove the portion up to my property line? \n\nUpdate 1: I walked over to the neighbors house today and actually saw the wife FaceTiming her mom showing her all of the progress with the fence with a big smile. Kind of awkward timing! I asked her to come to the side of the fence and we chatted a bit. \n\nHonestly, it came across that they were playing dumb, and what they were saying didn\u2019t make sense. I showed her the boundary spike at the corner and how they built outwards from it and past it by close to 3 feet. I also told them there was a middle of fence line property marker that seems like they removed it. She claimed that they thought they were their property markers so they just moved it. She was actually pretty convinced that the marker was hers to do what she pleased with. Basically said \u201cso you thought they were your property markers? And you still, thinking that went past them?\u201d \n\nShe got a bit defensive and said the space between the fence wasn\u2019t big enough to fit their tractor so they just wanted to remove the hassle of maintaining the small portion. She claimed our portion over grew and we didn\u2019t care cause we didn\u2019t have to look at it. \n\nAt this point I became a bit irritated because it just seemed excuse after excuse. I told her I did maintain my portion and part of that was constantly cutting back their bushes that they weren\u2019t maintaining. \n\nWhere is seems to get tricky is they are claiming they also had a survey down and the opposite corner showed their property entered part of my other neighbors decorative rock and shed area (mine does too) but it seems the two surveys are possibly conflicting (unless she is lying as she didn\u2019t actually provide the survey). So, there may be a case where the property line to my fence would basically create a super long isosceles  triangle. The nice part of this is my plan to set the fence back may have potentially avoided a property dispute requesting my fence be moved. This is just on very back corner and my fence def is still not crossing the line, but that part may only have 10 inches or so. \n\nAnyhow- the wife was really pushing towards an easement agreement basically documenting that they are aware that this is our land, not there\u2019s. I said for me to even consider that the fence posts they put up to my fence would need replaced with a gate to allow me to access my land when I want. \n\nMy wife is insistent that we do not share any part of our fence with the neighbors. I am supportive of that as well. I think when the husband comes home we may suggest that we landscape and put pea gravel down between my fence and property line and they can either return their fence back to its position (the majority of the posts are still in ground) or we can run a field fence along our real property line with some agreement on what to do with the confusing corner (assuming they are lying about their previous survey) \n\nUpdate 2: we emailed the neighbor a copy of the survey plat and I put a visual Birds Eye map showing the potential options they could do without removing the entire work they did (I figured it could be helpful maybe). I said no matter what we decided to proceed with between our line, without question the fences need pulled back off my property. This is the text from my neighbor after the email:\n\n\u201cHey, sorry we should have talked before we built our fence up against yours. We will rectify it today and ensure we are off of your property entirely. We had only removed our portion to make it easier to maintain as you had not gone back there and maintained the grass once since the fence was erected- it is an eyesore when it becomes over grown. Removing that section of fence allows us to cut the grass up against it cleanly - it would have been easier for both of us- that was our train of thought especially since there is no gate for u to easily access that area\n\nSorry again. (Husband name) wishes you would have just approached him while he was out there and it could have never gotten to this point. You did not need to waste hours putting together a lengthy email that could have been resolved quickly face to face in a neighborly way- the email makes it clear what kind of neighbors you wish to be.\n\nLastly, we would never remove the pins placed when you had your survey done as we have had one done ourselves and know how expensive it can be. We did however remove the wooden stake with the flag on it as it was also an eyesore that you aren\u2019t able to see behind your fence. The pins are all still in place and are protruding from the ground and have pink paint on them.\u201d\n\n\nI had some issues with this text as we did maintain the space in accordance with borough height limits on grass. There was one time I went back to weed whack and the neighbor had already done it, but it wasn\u2019t over code anyhow when he decided to do that. \n\nIn this text she admitted they purposely threw away our property stake (wooden one) in the middle of the fence line as it was \u201can eyesore\u201d. This is one small flag orange flag in a giant lot. \n\nShe also implied that we knew they were doing this and waited until complete to complain despite us not seeing it til last evening. \n\nShe also said an email wasn\u2019t necessary as it could have been a quick face-to-face chat. Despite us having a chat with her earlier and her making junk up. \n\nAdditionally, my email was firm but very non-aggressive. \n\nIMO they knew they fucked up and were defensive over it. They were reaching for a justification. \n\nI will give them a couple days to remove the fence encroachments before examining the lot again. If it\u2019s not been completed, I will go to an attorney. \n\nUpdate 3- went outside to find the encroaching fence was removed on both the left and right side of the property. I heard a lot of work going on around the corner and noticed a string running along the property line. Neighbors are now constructing a privacy fence about 1 inch inside their line. Because the property wedges it leaves about 1.5 feet open at the corner where there is some discrepancy and quickly opens back to the 3 foot wide section. I asked him if he could start building on the far side to allow me time to put down weed barrier and fabric along the smaller section. He responded that he doesn\u2019t think either of us will need to worry about the section as not much should grow between two fences. \n\nI said \u201cprobably not but I\u2019ll still landscape it for less to worry about when I maintain back here. He started making passive aggressive comments about how that\u2019s funny since we never once took care of it. I asked him why he didn\u2019t simply knock on my door if it was upsetting him. He said \u201cit wasn\u2019t upsetting, It took two minutes to trim it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\nI said \u201cit seemed like enough of a big deal that you felt the need to fence this in though, I\u2019m just saying if it wasn\u2019t to your standards, just come speak to me.\u201d \n\nHe kept saying \u201cwhatever man.\u201d I started to leave but turned and asked \u201cI really just want to know, what\u2019s the excuse you have for just not coming to talk to me? Why did you feel that this was appropriate? Cause from my view this was underhanded and I think you guys are being passive aggressive because you were caught doing something you knew was not cool.\u201d \n\nThis is when things escalated to him repeatedly laughing and saying \u201cyou weren\u2019t enough of a man to come talk to me when I was doing this!\u201d I informed him we had no clue what he was doing. He kept yelling bullshit and claiming I knew exactly what he was doing but I\u2019m not a man and was too scared to say something. \n\nI said \u201cbuddy, you were too scared to simply knock on my door to the point you tried to fence my property. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Can you not see the hypocrisy?\u201d \n\nHe cussed at me, I cussed back. I told him his dog is cool, but he sucks \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1een4qs/found_out_my_neighbors_moved_their_fence_up_to/", "created_utc": 1722215792.0, "score": 1452, "author": "McJumpington", "num_comments": 821, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1een4qs/found_out_my_neighbors_moved_their_fence_up_to/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Recently she had her whole front yard professionally landscaped.  We started chopping down a small tree and clearing some brush near our mailbox which is by our property lines. W explained we were over our boundary and removed the brush from her property, not ours. We apologized for clearing some of her brush and said we would clean it as soon as we could, we have a rent a trailer. She told us she would try to see if her landscaper would take it for free since they had a bunch of yard waste from her project anyway. Yesterday, she saw my husband outside and told him we needed to give a check to her landscaper for $250 for clearing the brush. Neither she nor the landscaper contacted us before he started taking the brush away. He took less than half so we told her to tell the landscaper we would only pay half. Today she gave my son (18) while he was in our driveway an invoice for $175 from her landscaper and asked us to put the check in her mailbox because he was coming today to get her final payment. On the one hand, I want to keep the peace and just pay it, but I'm also super annoyed that they decided on a price without consulting us. I'm asking for any advice. \n\nUPDATE: I spoke with the landscaper directly today. He just stopped over and told me not to worry about the money and he will finish getting the yard debris.

{"title": "Neighbors\u2019 kids in my front yard - Am I being crazy?!", "selftext": "Edit: Thank you for all of your comments and advice! I\u2019m going to leave the landscaping and ignore them all completely. \n\nHi all, I\u2019m devastated. I moved into this 1950s townhome in a family-centered neighborhood last April. It\u2019s my first home. I\u2019m a single 24f with a small dog. It fit all of my needs. However, after moving in, I realized the neighborhood kids play in the front yard every day, using it as a playground field to play football, soccer and baseball. I\u2019ve put up solar pathway lights that have been knocked down and broken so many times that I just gave up on them. The grass died and the ground was so compacted. This has been ruining my mental health. I heard balls bouncing whenever I got home from work and kids screaming constantly. My dad and I have asked the kids numerous times to please play somewhere else, only to be answered with them rudely saying no or that they can\u2019t. Last week, I decided to have landscaping put in to try to deter them from playing in my front. (I\u2019m an extremely anxious and non-confrontational person and didn\u2019t want to have to talk to the parents about the issue). I had the landscapers remove the sod and render the soil, they put in 5 small redbud trees with 4 stakes around each them and some boulders, azaleas and barberry bushes- all with the sole purpose of keeping the kids out. My community association has no rules about landscaping. We aren\u2019t allowed to have fences in the front of the house. \nAfter the landscaping was put in, I went to my parents\u2019 house for a week for the holidays. When I returned, I was immediately confronted by my next door neighbor yelling at me saying that I had ruined the yard, that her husband and son will now have nowhere to \u201cinnocently\u201d play baseball, she insulted my dad saying he was the one behind all of this, complained about my dog barking and told me that everyone hates me. She kept stating how she wished I had just come to her and told her I didn\u2019t want the kids in my yard. While she did this, most of my others neighbors came outside and agreed with her. I apologized and told her I would have all of the landscaping removed, which will cost thousands of dollars.. I\u2019m beyond devastated. I feel shunned and humiliated. A couple of days after she confronted me, I texted her and she shames me for having my parents come often and I guess she knows that they bought me the house. I\u2019m the only single person on my block, the rest are families and seem to all be friends with each other and agree with this woman to hate me. What do I do?!???

{"title": "within a month of owning our first home, we are drowning. ", "selftext": "My husband and I bought our first home after years of saving. We figured we did everything right. We had a home inspection done, everything looked and seemed fine. Until we had a ton of rain 27 days after we got our keys. \n\nThe house we bought was built in 1915 or 16. It had been fixed up over the years and we fell in love right away. The biggest issue for us with this house was the bedrooms. We have 3 kids and it\u2019s a 2 bedroom home (used to be a 3 bed but someone over the years converted it into a 2 bedroom so there was a large primary bedroom. The basement was finished and was being used as a bedroom. We thought, okay.. we can be downstairs and the younger ones can share the bigger room and the oldest can have her own room. \n\nI noticed my middle daughter 6yo (asthmatic) coughing a lot since moving in. She has a ton of allergies and I figured it was the carpets upstairs because the previous owners had a large dog. We were planning on ripping them out and putting in laminate. \n\nFast forward a couple of weeks. I was heading downstairs into the basement after lunch and noticed a bunch of water coming out of a floor drain (there was a hole in the flooring panel to put the dehumidifier drain line in and the line from the water softener). I called my husband who came from work with a wet vac (we pulled out around 600+ litres of water within 6-7 hours. During that time, a plumber had come in to snake that line to see if there was a blockage. There wasn\u2019t one. Line was clear to the street. He said we will need a weeping tile to prevent this from happening again. We ended up getting a pump and had it sitting on the hole and it pulled out water for over 30 hours. We called insurance that night and they sent someone over to see how much was needed in repairs. The man who came told my husband to help get rid of the moisture to start pulling up the flooring. Well, black mold everywhere. Subfloor was black. My husband (also asthmatic) started ripping apart the subfloor and we found even more mold (an entire ecosystem with mushrooms) under the subfloor. Now insurance won\u2019t cover a damn thing because it was \u201cpre-existing\u201d. Mold crew started last week and did a crap job so now they are coming back tomorrow to finish what they should\u2019ve already. We have not been living in the home due to the mold and my husband and child having asthma. We have been living with my parents over an hour away from our house and constantly driving back and forth. \n\nWe came into the house today to make sure that it was ready for the mold people to come in and actually clean everything properly. Well now everything is worse. The foundation is trash. There are multiple wet spots all around the perimeter of the house. \n\nWe had saved an additional 10k for \u201cunexpected expenses\u201d for when we moved. The mold remediation is $3000 alone. \n\nNow we need the foundation to be fixed \nWeeping tiles, sump pump (and whatever else to keep the basement dry) \nThen we need to put it all back together again so we can actually function as a family in this place. \n\nWe contacted our lawyer who we used for closing and we may be able to go to small claims court with the previous homeowners for failure to disclose but who knows, we may not win and waste more money. \n\nHow do we fix everything when we can\u2019t afford everything that needs to be done?! \n\nAny insight is appreciated. \n\nETA: thank you for all of the helpful, supportive comments.

I told him I\u2019ve been dealing with this situation for a year, that the neighbor has been told to move the shed by the inspector and town attorney, that I\u2019ve already had 3 surveys of the land to prove the encroachment, and that the property is properly demarcated with pins. He asked why the building inspector was having yet another surveyor go out there and said he would \u201cjust have someone measure where the shed needs to be moved using the survey\u201d. He says he will personally get involved in this and will \u201cgive neighbor 1 week to get his shed moved\u201d.\n\nI get a call back with him later that day with a junior building inspector (taking direction from the senior inspector while he\u2019s out of town) on the line and womp womp, he totally changes his tune. He said I have to get a surveyor to go out there to pin the property line again but specifically next to the shed. They could never answer me why it was my responsibility to pin a specific spot on my property for a shed that shouldn\u2019t exist there in the first place solely for the benefit of the neighbor figuring out how far back to move his shed to get it into compliance.\n\nI\u2019m fuming now and I also figured out that the senior inspector forgot that I had sent him the third survey showing the encroachment in the spring which should have began the penalty violations. He also didn\u2019t provide that to the neighbor who needed it and had been asking for it. He just thought I didn\u2019t provide the survey. Even the junior inspector was embarrassed and frustrated for his lack of help and thoroughness with my case.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m still adamant that I don\u2019t want to get another surveyor out there, it will just take too long. I talked to a lawyer that would be less expensive than a surveyor and pretty much said this was a slam dunk win that would enforce the removal asap. We\u2019re still trying to tread lightly though so we don\u2019t piss off my future home\u2019s building inspector too much with the threats of using an attorney, but we desperately need results.\n\nMy dad\u2019s an engineer and comes up with an idea that we present to the junior inspector. We\u2019ll use the shed AS the property line pin to mark the setback for the neighbor. The shed is shown on the survey and we can see where the property line crosses through the shed, so we just need to measure and mark those places IRL. It\u2019s stupidly simple and similar to an idea I mentioned months ago about measuring the setback from the shed, but they approved it. I used the survey\u2019s CAD files to set up the measurements for where to pin the property line and 6\u2019 setback lines. (In my last post the setbacks were at 12\u2019 but changed at some point that month, another piece of important information that the building inspector forgot to mention to me.)\n\nWhen my dad and husband went out to go mark the shed using line of sight they met up with the neighbor and he was SO unbelievably nice. Mind you, we\u2019ve all been blocked, ignored, had our No Trespassing signs taken down, and been told in the past that we should just \u201csell him the property\u201d. Now he\u2019s making friends with my husband, giving him a tour of his house, talking scotch, sharing contractor info with him, etc. I\u2019m BAFFLED hearing this and don\u2019t trust it but welcome it for the moment. Then my husband tells me the neighbors wife is rude to him and pissed that we didn\u2019t get the additional survey, didn\u2019t like that we were doing it this way, etc. The neighbor hushes her and she goes off to pout the rest of the day.\n\nMy theory is that maybe the wife is the one doing all the blocking and snagging this up? The neighbor apparently had a heart attack earlier this year so I wonder if she took over his communications. When this first started last year they mentioned that they tried to buy our property so their son could live on it. Apparently it\u2019s just HER son, his step son. I think she drove some of this conflict and he may be giving it up or just changing his tune after his heart attack. Ever since then he\u2019s been friendly toward us which I\u2019m relieved about.\n\nSo after the pinning of the property line and marking the 6\u2019 setback the building inspector approved our work and then gave the neighbor ANOTHER month to get this scheduled with a mover and finally moved.\n\nAfter about a month and a half I didn\u2019t hear from the inspector so we gave the town a call. It had been moved!!\n\nWe went forward with our final survey to confirm that our land is clear of encroachments. It\u2019s cleared, but neighbor only moved it 3.6\u2019 off the property line \u2013 short of the 6\u2019 setback. WTAF? I got a letter today from the building inspector saying he passed it and the case is officially closed.\n\nI absolutely DO NOT care that it\u2019s only 3.6\u2019 back instead of 6\u2019, I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s off my land and can now move forward, but seriously? I don\u2019t know how this got approved but I\u2019m in awe of the incompetence of the inspector. I guess I\u2019ll just have to see what all I can get away with too.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s my shed saga. Thanks for reading.\n\nTLDR: I escalated the issue of my neighbor's encroaching shed to the town, finally reaching the supervisor who sympathized with my year-long frustration over the shed encroaching on our property. Despite previous surveys proving the encroachment, the building inspector asked for yet another surveyor to pin the property, which made no sense.\n\nAfter much back and forth, my dad, an engineer, suggested using the shed itself as a marker for the property line. Surprisingly, the junior inspector approved this. When my dad and husband marked the property line, the neighbor, once uncooperative, was suddenly friendly. After some delays, the shed was moved, though only 3.6 feet instead of the required 6 feet. Despite the inspector closing the case, I\u2019m relieved it's off my land and can finally move forward, though baffled by the whole ordeal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1feoyj9/update_neighbors_shed_encroaches_on_our_property/", "created_utc": 1726099019.0, "score": 1340, "author": "ginger_dominion", "num_comments": 137, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1feoyj9/update_neighbors_shed_encroaches_on_our_property/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Neighbor set my house on fire, what can I do?", "selftext": "So today my neighbor set my car and house on fire by pouring gasoline on them and lighting them on fire.\n\nLong story short, we were evacuated from the house, swat showed up, the neighbor was detained and our house was put out.\n\nThe house has some minor damage that we haven't really had a chance to inspect but the fence dividing our property was first burned down and then flattened by swat.\n\nNow I don't know what to do next. Police said a victims advocate would contact us tonight, but that was 5 hours ago and it is now 1am and no call. Our water is currently off because either the fire or swat breaking through our house/yard has caused damage to the pipes.\n\nI'm mostly afraid of him getting out on bail or something and setting our house on fire again or worse. He owns his home and the police did mention that there was nothing they could really do to stop him from returning to his home.\n\nIf anyone has any advice I would appreciate it, because I am at a loss. At this point we are considering just selling and moving somewhere else.\n\nWe live in Mesa, Arizona if that is relevant.\n\n*Update: We confirmed the guy is in custody and has not seen a judge yet. He was charged with two counts of arson, a count of assaulting a police officer and two counts of endangerment. Still no word from victim advocates and it seems like the county prosecutors office doesn't open until Monday. It looks like our pipes were melted by the fire so we are without water until we get that fixed. After examining the exterior in the daylight it looks like we got lucky as he spread more gas on the side of the house, it just didn't light up. It looks like all the neighbors houses were damaged in one way or another. They boarded up his house this morning as swat did a number on his walls and windows. It is really surreal never in a million years did I think I would be the victim of a hate crime. As a fair sized white male I have never really known what its like to not feel safe in my home and it super sucks. Hopefully we can get our house fixed, sold and move to a country where the advice that makes the most sense is not \"shoot a mentally unwell person because the state will not protect you.\"*\n\n*Update 2: We contacted homeowner insurance last night after the police left and we were allowed in the home. The guy informed me he would send someone out in 2-3 days. We have had previous claims with the company and are still waiting for them to fix wind damage from last year. Our previous experience with them has been less than stellar, so we are not expecting much.*\n\n*Update 3: He just had his arraignment, they set bond at 150k we didn't even get to watch since the live stream went down and they never restarted it. I'm absolutely floored, the man set our home on fire, he could do so again at any time. He threatened children in the neighborhood, bit a police office and now gets to get out on bond? I'm beside myself, the courts aren't even open for me to put in an injunction of harassment. The guy could be walking around while I still have my water, the thing that saved my home from the arson, off. I'm making arrangements to go stay with friends or family and am just resigning that my home may be burnt down while I am gone.*\n\n*Update 4: The officer that first responded to the scene has called us and informed us that we were given bad information. One of the things he was charged with is a non-bond able offense. So we are safe for now and not moving! Hopefully this will be the last update!

Some kids would play in their front yard from time to time but never together, and AFAIK the adults barely spoke to one another. There wasn\u2019t any animosity, everyone just kept to themselves.\n\nAs a young adult I mostly lived in cities in apartments, and it was the unspoken rule that you barely acknowledged your neighbors except if they made noise (which thankfully most of mine didn\u2019t).\n\nNow as a homeowner in the suburbs I\u2019ve just kept this up because it\u2019s what always seemed normal to me.

{"title": "Neighbor suing for $3,000 for the cost of half of a fence", "selftext": "Our neighbor is suing us for the cost of 1/2 of $6,000. When we moved into the house almost 2 years ago she approached us within the week we moved in introducing herself, very friendly and then proceeded to say she wanted to replace the fence. We let her know we wouldn't be able to at that time because we had just bought the house and did not have the extra money. We hadn't talked to her about the fence since then except one time when my husband repaired the pickets with brand new ones to make sure our dogs didn't bother her. Her son saw we were replacing pickets and praised my husband for it, stating that as long as we can just replace pickets as needed it would save us all money; we agreed. \n\nFast forward to last  summer our neighbor we share our back fence with gave us a 3 month notice she was going to replace the fence entirely due to her huskies getting out all sides of her fencing. We asked her if she needed us to cover any part so that we could save for it. She let us know we wouldn't need to pay for it and we thanked her. Three months later when it was the weekend to replace the fence our neighbor let us know the day and hours the company would come to work and just asked us to let our side neighbors know construction would be happening, which we did. Upon going to the ladies house on our side and letting her know as a courtesy, she tells us \"well then I want to replace my fence as well\". We let her know weren't the ones replacing our back fence. She then stated that she didn't care and that she wanted the fence replaced and she was going to have a company come do it within 2 days and we would owe her half for of a brand new redwood fence that would match the rest of the fencing in her backyard. We shared a cedar fence prior. We told her we wouldn't be able to do it on such short notice, and that we weren't going to split the difference for premium materials. \n\nShe didn't listen and that Saturday we woke up to someone tearing down our back gate and replacing the fence. They even came to knock on our backdoor asking to borrow axes and shovels because they didn't bring any tools. We weren't going to but she started screaming we were trying to hinder her fence build so we let them borrow tools. It took them almost 3 complete days to replace the one side of the fence. They never put our gate back onto the fence because they said they weren't paid to, so my husband had to go buy materials to reattach our gate and fill in pickets between our gate and the fence. \n\nWe later received a certified letter stating we owed her $3,000. We emailed her asking for an itemized receipt that we never received. A month after the fence was installed we had a lot of rain. The fence started bowing, and falling over, and her landscaping company had to fix it. Almost a year later she is now suing us for half the cost of a fence build.

Every realtor I talked to played the \"Well, what do YOU want to get out of it?\" BS. Listed for $550,000 and hired a seller agent at 2.5%. She stood to make $13,500! I own a business and to make that kind of money I'd be working for a month of 8 hours days during the busy season! Well, this lady hired the cheapest photographer that took shitty pics, whined constantly about how she couldn't do anything to sell the house, and basically started to refuse to do any more open houses. When we expressed the slightest bit of dissatisfaction with her to another agent that agent ratted us out back to her! She sent us an angry email basically telling us to f#$ck off. I had a friend tell us they had a good experience with a different agent so I asked him to come over. He was honest it seemed in that he wasn't trying to tell me what ever I wanted to hear so that I'd hire him. He said most I could get was $500,000, so I took it off the market \n\n\nNow we want to sell again, even though the market is worse. I was going to make a killing at $550, so that's ok. He came in September and said at that time he could get $430,000, but if we painted the inside all white, put all our stuff in storage and waited until February we could get \"substantially more\" we took his advice and did even more, painting the outside as well. \n\n\nWe come back to this realtor and say \"ok, we did everything you asked us and more. What can we get now?\" Trying to get him to answer was like pulling teeth, just like all the others last time. Finally after much back and forth he said $453,000. He said at that price he'd get us an offer in two weeks. Not exactly substantially more. He also says he's a premium guy and so is his firm (Vanguard) and so deserves 3% because we'd get it back when he negotiated a higher price for us. Ok, prove it. \n\n\nTo his credit we have gotten a lot of views and saves in Zillow, but I am suspicious. You can pay people on the Internet to fake that stuff up, and it hasn't translated to a single offer. Hell, we have barely got any traffic. Three open houses in four weeks and only one realtor showing. We just zoomed the guy along with the underling he gets to actually sit in the open houses. To hear him tell it there is absolutely nothing he or anyone else can do to get buyers, he was completely wrong about the direction of the market, totally not his fault of course, and our only option was to lower our price. But he's an expert and worth paying $13,500 to. He paid for the pics, maybe $500 max. He's sat down with us for about 2 hours total, and his person sat in our house for a combined total of 6 hours. If we sell it today thats $1625 an hour!!! For what?!? He basically admitted he's worthless!\n\n\nIts such BS! No one deserve this much pay for so little work. I could hire a Redfin agent, 1.5%, but I'm sure I'd get even less for that and it's still f$#@king $7750!!! I would totally sell it myself, I bought it that way and everything worked out fine, but at this point I'm afraid of being blackballed by all the agents around me. The previous agent hates me, and this guy didn't like me questioning his genius very much either. Its a small town. I feel like I'm dealing with the freaking mob! \n\n\nAlright, rant over. All the real estate agents are going to post about how they would do much better (no specifics of course) and down vote me now. Screw 'em.

{"title": "$150 lesson about garage doors.", "selftext": "Well, I just learned a $150 lesson about my garage door, and I thought I'd share it here in hopes of saving someone else from feeling as stupid as I do now.\n\nI just paid that as a service fee for a garage door technician to come out and solve my problem with a simple turn of a dial.  My garage door was intermittently having trouble closing.  It would shut 6 inches and then reverse itself and go back up.  I couldn't figure out why.  I probably spent two hours watching youtube videos and who knows how much longer googling trying to figure out what was wrong.  The sensors were working and properly aligned.  The door wasn't binding on anything.  The rails were parallel and properly aligned.  I even kept a log of times a day I encountered the issue to rule out that it was from shadows on the sensors.  \n\nI couldn't figure it out on my own, so after a month of troubleshooting and brainstorming, I called out a serviceman and he walked right up the box and said \"Yep, your force is set really low\".  He then took out a screwdriver and turned the two force dials up a couple of notches and fixed the issue in less than two minutes.  \n\nNone of the videos I watched on youtube or threads I found on reddit mentioned the force dials.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done/figured out so far:\n\n- The symptoms start about 10 minutes after he enters the house. They go away about an hour after he leaves.\n\n- He has been allergy tested. He\u2019s extremely allergic to trees and grasses and a little allergic to a specific kind of mold. No other allergies.\n\n- We have had the house tested for mold 3 times, nothing has come up.\n\n- We have had the house tested for VOCs once, there were virtually none. The guys testing were shocked that a newer build had so little VOC.\n\n- We have had the vents cleaned. No improvements and they weren\u2019t that dirty.\n\n- We replaced the carpets with hardwood last week. We were really hopeful this would solve the problem and it hasn\u2019t :(\n\n- We have done carbon monoxide testing and there is no issue. We also have plug in and ceiling carbon monoxide monitors in the house.\n\n- There is a radon mitigation system and the house has been tested for radon with no issue.\n\n- He has started to feel bad in our cars that stay in the garage now too. Ugh.\n\n- Sometimes he feels better with windows open, sometimes he feels better with the windows in the house closed.\n\n- He feels better in the house at night, worse in the middle of the day. There are some days where his symptoms are terrible, some days where they are fine and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any consistency in it. We created a chart of his symptoms with weather, outdoor allergen levels, humidity, etc. and can\u2019t find anything consistent.\n\n- He feels a little better now that he\u2019s added charcoal filters to the HVAC system with the fan constantly blowing. \n\n- He feels better when the house is kept below 67 degrees. lol you have to bundle up.\n\n- He feels better for a bit after showering.\n\n- He feels the worst in his office, that is a smaller bedroom space with 3 windows in it. \n\n- In addition to the HVAC system, we have air filter throughout the house.\n\n- He went to our neighbors other side of the duplex for a few hours, and he still had his same symptoms.\n\n- He took anti-anxiety medicine for a month to make sure it wasn\u2019t a psychological thing. It didn\u2019t help his symptoms.\n\n- There\u2019s a radon mitigation system in the house. It has been tested for radon once for the house inspection and there wasn\u2019t any radon.\n\n- He\u2019s had a full physical panel, and nothing came up.\n\nPossible issues we haven\u2019t tested:\n\n- Turf was installed about 1.5 years ago, just before he bought the house. Could this make him feel bad?\n\n- There is a really old, worn down house next to us. Our air intake pipe is on that side of the house, we have a state of the art air filtration/HVAC system though. The house is about 5 feet from ours (city living) The neighbor blows glass in a make-shift glass blowing studio they created in their garage. Not sure if their old house or the glass blowing could be creating his symptoms? It is not a sophisticated set up at all for the glass blowing.\n\n- He has a large titanium rod in his back due to scoliosis surgery. Any chance that could be interacting with any chemicals and the reason he is the only one impacted?\n\n- We haven\u2019t had electricity tested for anything but not sure if that could cause the symptoms?\n\n- The windows are double glass pane noise cancelling windows. We are wondering if escaping gas from the windows could be the culprit? But everything we read says that the gas in the windows is incredibly benign. Has anyone experienced issues with double pane windows?\n\nIf anyone has went through this or has ideas, please comment!! We are so drained from all of this and he is sick of feeling sick! Also he isn\u2019t a drama queen lol he never complains about anything so I know it\u2019s really bothering him for him to feel this strongly. If anyone knows of specialists in this etc. would love to hear that too.\n\nEdit: THANK YOU so much to everyone for all of your suggestions and sharing what you have experienced, we are so appreciative and now have a list of different things to try. I can\u2019t respond to everyone but we just wanted to say we are reading everyone\u2019s suggestions and taking notes. I will post an update as we go through and try different things. Reddit rocks \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit #2: We are 99.9999% sure meth was never cooked in the duplex. The duplex was built in 2016. Our side of the house has only had one previous owner who lived there for 6 years. They had 2 young kids and were very social with neighbors, having them over etc. We\u2019ve met them, they\u2019re super normal, they moved to be closer to grandma in California. Our neighbors on the other side of the duplex have lived there since it was built. They are also definitely not meth cooks and the nicest people we\u2019ve ever met haha. We\u2019ve been to their house, they are probably in their late 50s, early 60s. We also go over there when they are out of town to water their plants. They don\u2019t have any other family members living there or anyone else coming or going.\n\nThere have never been any reported meth labs near us according to police. But, if meth was being cooked across the street or 2 blocks away or something and it hasn\u2019t been caught, is it possible it would be impacting our house?

{"title": "How many of us had a previous homeowner who was so bad at DIY that their name has become a noun, adjective, and verb for shoddy handiwork?", "selftext": "Mine\u2019s name is Franz. We have taken to calling his work \u201cfranzes\u201d and \u201cfranz jobs,\u201d with a verb form of \u201cto franz\u201d (e.g., \u201cthat toilet is really franzed up\u201d).\n\nEvidently, Franz is an avid DIYer. He also deeply, deeply sucks at it. He has the reverse Midas touch: Everything he touches turns to shit.\n\nWe believe Franz is a danger to himself and others. He should be on some kind of watchlist of people who are prohibited from living within 1,000 feet of a hardware store.\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of all the franz jobs we have found and fixed:\n\n - I posted about this one [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1bgvxjy/unflipping_the_flip_my_bathroom_remodel_horror/). Long story short, Franz tried his hand at a full bathroom remodel prior to selling the home to us. He franzed things up so badly that things started leaking and clogging within a few months of our moving in. We ended up having to tear the bathroom down to the studs and rebuild it from scratch.\n- As a result of the East Coast earthquake of 2011, the chimney suffered some structural damage. Franz evidently tried his hand at brick masonry and attempted to fix it. Once again, we had to tear down this franz job and rebuild it from scratch, it was so badly done.\n- Approximately 3 out of every 4 electrical outlets were burned out or nonfunctional due to Franz\u2019s handiwork. We had all the outlets checked and replaced by a licensed electrician, because even if Franz was lucky enough not to have burned the house down, we didn\u2019t want to test our luck. \n- Franz attempted to \u201chack\u201d the toilets to turn them into low-flows. He did not succeed. The toilets use the same amount of water, but you have to hold down the plunger for several seconds to make sure they fully flush and do not run. We are slowly replacing the toilets. \n- If a set of install instructions called for three screws, Franz used two. If they called for five screws, Franz used three. Who skimps on screws? Franz does, that\u2019s who. We have started calling things like this \u201cmini-franzes.\u201d\n- We have had no fewer than three contractors tell us, \u201cYou know that\u2019s installed upside down, right?\" Yes, we know. Upside down locks, shelves, outlets, etc. Franz is too avant-garde to do something so pedestrian as install things right side up.\n\nThankfully, my wife and I are decent enough at DIY to fix all the mini-franzes, and know our limits and when to call in professionals. We\u2019ve fixed most of the egregious franz jobs over the past 2 years,  but we\u2019re still finding them.\n\nHow many of you have had to deal with the handiwork of a Franz?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1icu6ry/how_many_of_us_had_a_previous_homeowner_who_was/", "created_utc": 1738158672.0, "score": 1161, "author": "DblePlusUngood", "num_comments": 428, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1icu6ry/how_many_of_us_had_a_previous_homeowner_who_was/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

", "selftext": "We live in a LCOL area but purposefully chose an expensive area to live due to the good schools and amenities the community has to offer. The taxes are pretty high (property taxes alone are around 10k for a 1600sqft home). \n\nWhen we first moved in, the neighbor situation was an absolute dream. One neighbor uses his house as his second home and only visits a few times a week, super quiet, respectful, and chill guy. The house on the other side was converted into a daycare and people were only there during normal business hours. All our other neighbors across the street and down the street have kids and we would all regularly hang out in our driveways together. \n\nThen\u2026 the owner of the daycare building decided to change it to residential and rented it out. First set of renters turned out to be meth heads and destroyed the entire house. They had 4-5 dogs and just left them in the house for 3 months, urinating and deficating everywhere. \n\nThe landlord tried to sell the house for a ridiculous price and no one made any offers. Then came the second renters\u2026. We call them \u2018Shameless\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s a family of 6-8 people in poverty living in a 2 bedroom house and they have 5-6 untrained, aggressive pit bulls. They sell drugs and are constantly outside smoking weed or meth in their cars. Two of them have rap sheets 30+ pages long with a dozen felonies varying from aggravated assault, domestic violence, B&R\u2019s, you name it. Their yard has rusty, unused cars and piles of trash and debris. They\u2019re constantly loud, blasting music, yelling, swearing. The police /emergency services are constantly at their house. Sometimes for overdoses, other times it\u2019s just the Mom laying out in the driveway drunk, naked and screaming. Their dogs keep breaking our fence and have almost gotten through the fence and attacked my service dog while we were sitting in our backyard. \n\nThey have zero consideration for other people. Their dogs have escaped multiple times and almost attacked 10+ people around the neighborhood, including children. \n\nIt\u2019s now gotten to a point where none of our neighbors let their kids play outside for fear of their safety from the aggressive dogs. The people across the street moved out of their house and left it vacant because they felt so unsafe for their kids. \n\nBut the saddest part is, my partner and I chose this specific house and area to start a family.

They\u2019re aware (to an extent), but there\u2019s not much they can do but issue citations. Weirdest thing is the cops told us the house was condemned years ago, so I\u2019m not sure how these people are able to rent it.

We\u2019re claiming adverse possession since we\u2019ve been using that property for years.\u201d I said No. No letters or any kind of notice in writing ever not even during the purchase transaction . She says, \u201dwell we are so we\u2019re not moving anything.\u201d \n\nI had our lot professionally surveyed. They happened to be gone with their boat. The surveyors clearly marked the property lines. A couple weeks later I hired a tow truck & fence guy to move the fence. Called the non emergency police line requesting a civil stand by after explaining the situation. Dropped my son at school (1st day of kindergarten) went home and started the work. Fence guy showed up first and he began taking the fence down. The tow truck & police arrived about 30 minutes later right at the same time. I explained the situation again to them. They asked where I wanted these things towed and I said the nearest legal parking spot. As the tow truck began hooking up the boat the neighbor came out in their bathrobe yelling their head off. The Officer explained the situation to the neighbor asking him & his wife for any kind of legal documents showing the property was in fact theirs or that it was in litigation. They couldn\u2019t because it was BS. The tow truck hooked up that boat and parked it on the street. Next was the snow machine trailer. While this was happening the fence guy was working away putting the fence back up along the clearly marked property line. Fence moved. Problem solved.  We weren\u2019t friends. They were mean & snarky from the beginning. They moved a year later after a fire. \n\nAdverse possession is a thing. Disrupting the \u201ccontinuous use\u201d is the solution. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/s/0eASRm1l3E](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/s/0eASRm1l3E)\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1axquxs/adverse_possession_move_that_fence/", "created_utc": 1708660086.0, "score": 1079, "author": "Public-Requirement99", "num_comments": 168, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1axquxs/adverse_possession_move_that_fence/", "html_title": ""}

We agreed he would that weekend...\n\nThe update: I didn't hear from him at all that weekend. Come Wednesday the following week, I worked up an itemized list of materials and labor costs and went over to his house to give it to him. \n\nOf course he was shocked by the amount. It came to about $500. We said, that's fine. If he doesn't have it, we could go through insurance or, he still has the chance to fix it himself. He was all, \"I'm sorry I didn't come tell you. My dad is going to come help me with it this weekend.\"\n\nSaturday, we were working in the yard and saw him come home in a truck packed with 6 people like they had been and were continuing the party. We caught eyes for a second and I heard him say, \"Oh Shit.\" Whatever. There is still Sunday.\n\n4:30 PM Sunday, I'm coming to the conclusion that it isn't happening, reach out to him and he says, \"Oh Sorry I didn't tell you. Something came up and my dad couldn't make it.\" So I say we just want to get things done before its too late to make an insurance claim... Wouldn't you know, the response is, \"My dad will be here in an hour and a half\"\n\nSo his dad shows up to wipe his ass for him.\nMy mailbox is fixed now.\n\nEdit: The Mailbox pics for reddit drama https://imgur.com/a/4Y1VpU5\n\nEdit for Clarity: I had just put in 8 hours replacing the post, refurbishing the mailbox, and refreshing the whole garden area around it, in June.

Because the previous owner built this ridiculous rock/cement/brick/dirt formation outside 4\u2019 high and 6\u2019 wide up against the foundation and WOODEN SIDING, and water was leaking down the foundation behind it and coming up the crawlspace dirt floor.

The previous owner removed old carpet and placed new pad/carpet on top of the urine, and now the new carpet and pad reek. I managed to save the carpet, but I replaced the MDF and pad. \n\nLike I said, I will work till I fall over. I don\u2019t even mind if I have to spend a lot of money to fix something.

{"title": "Things I wish I knew before buying a rural property.", "selftext": "Hi there. My wife and I decided to move out of the city two years ago and bought a home built in 1980 with 8 acres of wooded land. We're experienced homeowners. This is my 3rd house and I've completely gutted and renovated the two prior with my own hands. There's a few big mistakes that were avoidable if we would have looked into it and done more homework. We thankfully had (I stress had) a big contingency fund saved up since all new homes have *something* that goes wrong. I'm hoping this helps someone else:\n\n* Well Water: We had the well water tested by a certified lab before the purchase. The results came back \"safe for drinking\" but we really should have sent those results to a well water specialist. The pH was 5.0 which is REALLY FREAKING LOW and basically destroys copper piping and faucet hardware. It's also not great for your body. This cost us an $1800 pH neutralizing system. \n\n* Well Productivity: The well is low producing in the peak summer months. This means quick showers and spreading out the laundry loads so it doesn't run dry and fry the well pump. There's no way to really measure this but I could have asked the previous homeowner if I knew this was a thing that existed. \n\n* Generator: We lose power quite often. We're also on the low priority list after a major storm just due to the number of affected households. The house did not have a standby generator. In the first year of ownership we had to purge our refrigerator 3 times. This cost us a $3000 generator and transfer switch setup. \n\n* Tree & land Management: I think we were enamored with the idea of having so much land that we really never thought about the maintenance for that much land. I'm okay cutting down and sawing up some trees, but fully mature 75 footers are way beyond my comfort zone and leaning a little too close to the house/driveway/power lines for comfort. In my area it's about $1000 per tree for removal. Just take a look for this sort of thing if you're shopping.\n* Electric Rates: Our electric rates went up about 15% just because the distribution fee per kW/h is higher out in the sticks. \n* Septic System: We paid for a separate septic system inspection by a licensed specialist. There were some red flags which were noted in the inspection, but the system was deemed functional after a $2000 cleaning and enzyme treatment (paid for by the previous owner). It wasn't good enough. The septic system backs up and floods the leech field after heavy rain. We're having a new $16k septic system put in in the Spring. Basically, I should have just used my brain and said \"this septic system is 40 years old and hasn't been well cared for\" instead of putting my faith in an enzyme treatment. We still would have purchased the house but the previous owner would have had to cough up some cash for a replacement. \n* Ticks: We live in Lyme disease central. These woods are crawling with ticks, to the point that I had at least one on me every time I went out there during my first summer. We have small children and I don't want them to have a lifelong disease. It took a lot of smart planning of the property and landscaping to make it less attractive to deer and rodents. We also decided to spray a few times a year to keep it at bay. All of this is pretty expensive, though if you do it right you only have to do it once. So far the tick population appears to have gone way down. \n\nWe love it out here and we're not naive to think there wouldn't be unplanned expenses. It's just...ALL OF THEM....combined that kind of sucks. We would have rather spent that money on nice things to make it feel like ours rather than a poop tank.\n\nEDIT - A few people are surprised by the cost of the septic. There's a few factors to talk about here. One is that it's a 4 bedroom house so it forces our hand into buying a large 1500 gallon system. Two is that we live in coastal New England - one of the most expensive parts of the US for just about everything, but particularly skilled trades. $16k is on the lower end of the price range. I have a friend who lives on the coast and his multi stage septic was $60k so we're lucky. Three is that this includes the mandatory decommissioning and filling of the old tank. They take wastewater treatment very seriously around here due to population density and historic pollution problems. The first thing we had to do is hire a civil PE to design the system and then have it approved by the DEM. That alone is $1000.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/lys63z/things_i_wish_i_knew_before_buying_a_rural/", "created_utc": 1614998243.0, "score": 977, "author": "dweeb_plus_plus", "num_comments": 251, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/lys63z/things_i_wish_i_knew_before_buying_a_rural/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Ashley's Furniture is an absolute nightmare, NEVER EVER buy from them!!", "selftext": "This has been the single worst customer service experience I have ever had. We purchased a $2,350 sectional from this store, and from there, it\u2019s been nothing but problems. The initial delivery was fine, but when we decided to change the layout from Left Arm Facing (LAF) to Right Arm Facing (RAF), the nightmare began.\n\nFirst, the team from Diverse Logistics & Distribution, Inc. scheduled to pick up the sectional was supposed to arrive between 3\u20137 PM. They showed up at 10:30 PM, with no tools, so I had to provide my own! While moving the sectional, they cracked my window\u2014a fact I only noticed days later since it was a little stress crack. When I reported it, Ashley\u2019s outright refused to take responsibility, saying it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to file a claim.\n\nBy the third delivery attempt, it got even worse. The crew insisted the sectional wouldn\u2019t fit through our door, despite the fact it had already been inside! The sectional is 28 inches, and our door is 31.5 inches. But did they listen? No. They spoke no English, and we had to communicate through Google Translate. After arguing, they finally tried but forced it through, tearing the fabric, and then turned around and blamed us, saying it was \u201cundeliverable.\u201d\n\nWe have been patient long enough and are sick of being treated horribly. Every time we call, they tell us it\u2019s being \u201cescalated\u201d or that \u201csomeone will call us back.\u201d No one ever calls. We just get passed off from one person to the next, with the same empty promises and zero accountability.\n\nMonths later, we still don\u2019t have the sectional we paid for, my window is still broken, and we\u2019re stuck with Ashley\u2019s pathetic excuse for customer service. Do yourself a favor and avoid Ashley\u2019s like the plague.

Ashley\u2019s used Diverse Logistics & Distribution, Inc. as their delivery company, and let me tell you, they are absolutely trash. They broke my window, blamed me for it, and outright refused to take responsibility. If you ever see this company handling your delivery, run away and refuse the delivery on the spot!\n\nI ended up purchasing a sectional from Jordan\u2019s Furniture instead, and the difference was night and day. Jordan\u2019s was amazing at every step\u2014professional, communicative, and actually cared about customer service.\n\nLong story short, tell everyone you know to NEVER, EVER buy anything from Ashley\u2019s. This company has zero accountability, zero respect for their customers, and does not deserve anyone\u2019s business. Avoid them at all costs!\n\nEDIT:  \nLooks like I missed the last part where on the 4th delivery, the team from Ashleys own crop delivered the sectional and it was smooth no problem at all.

{"title": "PSA: Don\u2019t do the free water tests from Home Depot", "selftext": "TLDR at the bottom (since it\u2019s a long post, I know most people just want to get to the point)\n\nMy wife and I just bought our house and were making one of our seemingly never ending runs to Home Depot when we noticed a free water test at the checkout. We knew the new house had hard water, although we had a water softener already, but figured we\u2019d get it tested and such just to see what the quality was, it was free after all!\n\nSo we send the sample in and a couple of weeks later get the results. They called and said it was 254 TDS and \u201chard\u201d water. The lady on the phone said that she can send someone out next week in the evening to run more thorough tests, as you can\u2019t send much water through the post office to do thorough testing to find out what was in the water, and the person can take a look at our softener for us as well. She said it should take about 45 minutes to an hour and wants both of the home owners there. It made sense to me, I figured it was some city sponsored test thing and figured more information was better than none. Oh boy was I wrong. Basically they misled me on the phone and it turned into a giant sales pitch (I should have known, nothing is free unless you\u2019re the product after all\u2026). \n\nThe guy rolls up with a briefcase and pulls out an iPad and starts on a spiel explaining publicly available data from every water treatment plant in the country, and pulls up the plant that we\u2019re connected to and shows how we have a bunch of arsenic and radon in the water (below legal limit, but significantly higher than the recommended amount). This whole thing takes about 20 minutes then we finally get onto testing the actual water, which is what I figured he was there for. He does his tests and they show that the water is indeed hard, and we compared it to the outside spigot that wasn\u2019t on the softener, which also showed the same hardness, which implied the softener wasn\u2019t really working. (For reference, our hardness was 19, which is very hard)\n\nCool, I figure we\u2019re done, as we\u2019re now at the hour mark and the testing is done. Our water is hard. I knew this. I learned nothing except that the water softener probably needs to be replaced (which now I am doubting I even need to do that, the kitchen sink might not even be hooked up to the softener since it\u2019s an older house lol). \n\nBut yet he continues, he then goes \u201cwell now you\u2019re obviously going to go out and buy bottled water knowing how hard and unsafe your water is\u201d (no we\u2019re not, and no it\u2019s not dangerous, it\u2019s just hard). He then starts to pull numbers up of spending say $15 a month on bottled water, $25 a month on cleaning supplies, etc. Basically it all amounted to \u201chard water is bad and will kill your appliances and cause wear and tear and unexpected costs\u201d said in 20 different ways. Which yes, we knew this, it all made sense. I looked at the clock, it had gone on for an hour and a half at this point.\n\nAfter we agreed the water was hard on his stupid little power point, he starts talking about Rain Soft water softeners and how they\u2019re superior to everyone else because of the lifetime warranty (they\u2019re the only ones that have one! Don\u2019t worry, I got this the first 4 times he said this, he was very proud of it) and how every other softener is literally a piece of crap and can cause cancer because they don\u2019t filter out the chlorine. Which fine, it makes sense to choose something that filters out chlorine.\n\nHe then starts comparing the costs from earlier about how much hard water is theoretically costing us, and then brings up a chart explaining how much  hard water can cost you in appliances every 5 years. According to the spiel, they were practically guaranteed to break every 5 years, as was the cheap water softeners, he was saying this standing in front of a Bosch dishwasher from like 2005. The water heater is from 2013, same with the washer machine. Anyways, he basically claimed it was costing you roughly $5000 every 5 years in new appliances, or $40/mo with an extra $40/mo in unexpected wear and tear of things like pipes and such.\n\nThat\u2019s when he pulls out the cost for this super fancy Rain Soft system. $9800 (without the Home Depot discount). I should have kicked him out an hour ago, I really should have just kicked him out then. Regardless, I\u2019m too nice and let him continue, I figured he was almost done. The amount of times he would say \u201cwe\u2019re almost done\u201d was insane.\n\nHe continued to explain the cost was justified, as it was $122 a month for 10 (!) years with their financing at a fixed 9% rate (lmao, I wouldn\u2019t finance a fucking water softener anyways) and then brought up the costs of the hard water added together with the costs of replacing the appliances every 5 years and claimed that you\u2019re still saving money in the long run. I could tell around this point that he realized he wasn\u2019t going to make this sale, because he started to get desperate. He also clearly started trying to appeal to my wife, mostly trying to talk to her, which is quite annoying (and obvious what you\u2019re trying to do)\n\nHe started explaining *again* how hard water was bad for us and causing unnecessary cleaning costs (again, we know!) and brings out a flyer that says they\u2019ll give us a lifetime supply of cleaning costs for signing on. He starts explaining how other customers are satisfied and think the return on investment is worth it and they get 90% of their business from these leads. He brings up that he\u2019s driven only 3 Toyotas in the last 40 years and basically explains the buy it for life principle to us. Basically he\u2019s spraying and praying.\n\nAnyways, he goes onto say that the Home Depot discount knocks $1000 off the price, but it\u2019s only available on this first initial demo and won\u2019t be available again. We told him we want to think on it, that we are not dropping $8800 on a water softener on a whim, plus we literally just bought this house and already had unexpected expenses. He then REALLY tried to hit home that this discount would not be available if he left the house, and offered to give us as long as we need to talk it out (even offered to stay an extra hour while we chat, like dude, no). \n\nHe then finished by saying he doesn\u2019t like it when salesmen hold a gun to people\u2019s heads and rush people into making a decision by offering a 30% discount. He then continued to do literally exactly that and also ask if we could comfortably pay for it right now. He again tried to get us to sign on and convince us that most of their deals are done on the first demo (I have no idea why people would drop $8800 on a water softener after an hour sales pitch, I guess the scare tactics worked). \n\nWhen I finally made it clear that no, I was not doing this without at least sleeping on it and that I was fine with eating the $1000 discount if for some reason I decided that I would spend that much money on a water softener, he started to guilt trip and also admitted that he can get us a discount, but \u201cjust not as good\u201d if we do decide to go with the system. He again mentioned that most people buy during the first pitch and then seemed resigned to his fate, literally saying \u201cif I wasn\u2019t successful enough at this, I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford my car payments\u201d and seemed pretty upset. He also said he\u2019s gotten his spiel down 30 minutes and that he couldn\u2019t get it down any lower without compromising anything. He literally repeated himself about how bad hard water was 20 times. It became almost unprofessional how seemingly upset this 60 year old man was when we said no.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s how I spent 2 and a half hours of my Monday evening (basically my entire evening). I really should have kicked him out after the tests were done. I found out my water was hard, that my softener probably wasn\u2019t working (or just not hooked up to the kitchen sink plumbing, our soap seems to work fine in the shower lol), and found out publicly available data about what was in my water. I\u2019m genuinely wondering if the chemical tests were fraudulent, our water being \u201c19\u201d for hardness seems insane. The only thing that makes me think they weren\u2019t is my wife is a food scientist and was just debugging a water quality issue at work and seemed to understand the tests, but I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if it\u2019s all just bullshit. The whole thing felt like a giant scam. I literally just wanted my water tested man\u2026\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nTL;DR Got free water tests from Home Depot. Tests said water was hard, they offered to send someone out to run further tests.

Shortly after closing, the previous owner reached out by leaving a letter saying he had some things he found that belong with the house and if it was okay to drop them off.

{"title": "Random neighbors walking through our property. Unsure if I\u2019m being a Karen or a responsible homeowner.", "selftext": "Wife and I purchased our first (and likely forever home) a few months ago. 1.2 acres in an urban-ish part of Raleigh NC. The property sat vacant for 2 years prior to our purchase. There is a communal well easement that extends into both ours and the neighbors property which is accessible by both a small footpath from a nearby cul-de-sac and a gravel road extending the opposite direction from the footpath to a nearby neighborhood street. There is also a nature trail/footpath sorta-thing that comes from our neighbor\u2019s property and connects to what we have now learned is our gravel driveway. We (and apparently others in the neighborhood) thought the gravel driveway was easement for maintenance of the communal well however we paid for a survey which indicates the gravel driveway is our property and the short trail/footpath leading to the cul-de-sac is designated for maintenance.\n\nEver since buying the home we\u2019ve been seeing 5-10ish people per day walking to and from from an adjoining trail, down our gravel auxiliary driveway, and continuing on down the neighborhood street. I\u2019ve walked down to explore the trailing they\u2019re coming from and it connects to a dozen or so back yards and several neighborhood streets. Admittedly it is a serene walk. \n\nOur auxiliary/gravel driveway has a drainage tunnel running perpendicular underneath it with a ~10\u2019 steep drop-off on either side. I worry the day may come where a clumsy kid falls and we somehow end up getting sued.\n\nI\u2019ve put up No Trespassing signs along with a note that reads \u201cThis property sat vacant for an extended period of time prior to our purchase. We had a survey performed which indicated the well easement extending out in a 46\u2019 circular radius from the concrete box/communal well and the gravel drive being our property. Maintenance access to said well is via walking path from cul-de-sac. Our attorney advised us not to permit people walking through our property despite our insistence they are friendly neighbors merely passing through. As first time homebuyers, we are doing things by the book and trying to cover our butts wherever possible. We recognize this has been a serene shortcut to walk through for quite some time and appreciate your understanding.\u201d\n\nAnd yet people are still walking through our property. In their defense, the trail they\u2019re coming in through goes for a 1/2 mile or so before it dead ends at our No Trespassing sign, from which one can easily see the neighborhood street they\u2019re trying to access not far away. So they now have to turn around and back track from where they came.\n\nAm I being a Karen or is my concern of being sued legitimate? People walking by also makes my dogs go crazy.

{"title": "Almost 5 years of Ding Dong Ditch (banging on front door). How do I stop it?", "selftext": "NY state here (Long Island)\n\nIt started during the beginning of Covid. We have 4 children and it began with some kids from my oldest child's grade (HS freshman at the time.) She was not friends with them, but she also had no issues with them either. It started happening frequently and we were able to identify kids through the Ring camera and my oldest's SnapChat SnapMap (I would take photos of her screen indicating that the kids were right in front of my house and none of them live in the area.)\n\nIt happened over a dozen times and we tried handling it personally with the parents. Some parents were great and got their kids to stop, others not so much. It continued and we eventually decided to call the cops to file a report. The officer was very understanding, spoke with the families and then updated us after his conversations. As expected, some parents were argumentative with him.\n\nAs time has gone on, it has continued, but now with those kids' siblings taking on the role. It wasn't as frequent (4-5 times a year), so we had been ignoring it hoping they would get bored and it would fizzle out.  It happened again last night with kids from my 3rd child's grade (HS freshman). They've done it in the past, but I didn't address it because I'm trying to make sure my kids don't have issues with these kids in school as well. Last night we decided to address it. We went to the house, the one kid admitted it was his friend from \"out of town\". We waited for his mom to return home, whom I'm on friendly terms with, but we're not friends per se. When we tried to speak with her she argued it wasn't her kids and she wanted to see the video of her kids. Then she told us to get a grip, that we were being ridiculous. We decided to go home and I had my husband call the cops because I wanted a police report.

I've installed a dishwasher before and it wasn't difficult but it was annoying so I said yes. They rang me up and put everything through the POS system. One line item said \"Permit fee\" ($40) which I took queried because a permit seemed unnecessary for the install of a dishwasher but whatever.\n\nI called my town hall and they confirmed that contractors are required to pull a permit for a dishwasher install because of the electrical work. \n\nThe Lowe's subcontractor comes and does the install. It looks okay and they leave. I decide to call town hall to schedule the inspection and close the permit out.... \n\nTurns out they didn't file one. \n\nI call Lowe's back and the person on the phone first tries giving me the phone number of the installer before I interject and remind them that my relationship is with them not the sub so(since no permit was filed) I expect to be refunded. He promised to have a manager call me back(didn't happen) so I ended up calling corporate who assured me that a permit has been filed \"but not uploaded\"(whatever the fuck that means). They then promised to call me back tomorrow.\n\nI also called town Hall again and spoke to the the town building commissioner who was VERY interested to hear about Lowe's sending subs out to do what amounts to unpermitted work. \n\nIn the meantime I called my credit card company to look into a partial dispute for the permit fee amount. \n\nIn addition, I suspect the install is going to fail inspection because there's no GFCI on the dishwasher. I'm wondering if I'm going to have to have another electrician come in and fix some of this and if so if I'd be the asshole for asking Lowe's to pay for that? \n\n\nInterested to hear thoughts... \n\n\nEDIT: You can stop telling me that needing a permit to install a dishwasher is dumb.

I also noticed the same thing with the convection oven.  It has a Frigidaire sticker inside but Viking emblem on the outside.\n\nAfter doing a quick search on Amazon, looks like you can buy the Viking emblem and just stick it on anything: www.amazon.com/dp/B01548JP08/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_MZS2ZWSC3P92RB8GM296.\n\nI doubt I have any recourse on this but figured I would post to make others aware.

My current plan is to at least talk to a lawyer but also keep realistic expectations that it might not be worth it to pursue legal action.  It is what it is and I may just remove the emblems since they are definitely tacky.  Clearly I need to learn more about the kitchen appliance game because it should have been obvious to me they weren't viking.\n\nAlso, the seller bought the house in 2018 from a local real estate guy and I did find that listing.  It clearly shows the fake Viking appliances in the pictures so I think my seller got duped too which is kind of what I suspected.  However, it doesn't mention Viking appliances in the listing like my listing did.  I heard from a neighbor that the real estate guy bought it as a foreclosure from a guy who went bankrupt after a divorce.

As the top comment suggests- I am in Denver, and ended up finding a local program through contacting a shelter called STAR. It's a new humane first response program that sends a mental health professional with homeless resource knowledge, EMT, and police officer to help individuals who are either homeless, dealing with mental illnesses, or who are not sober and unwell VS just a police response, as that often just leads to violence or arrest. The folks who came have helped the people (there ended up being 2 people, one of which was naked and pretty obviously not with it) clean up their things, and are taking them to a homeless resource center in the city. The police officer asked if I wanted to press charges which I declined.\n\nI'll be taking a look back there to see what kind of cleanup is needed and if I need to call a professional bio-waste company or not, and go from there.

In 2010 the house was on the list for sale due to back taxes, but USDA paid them and has been every years since. Also USDA purchases insurance for the house evey year. Here it is 2024 and the home is still in my name sitting empty. I have called several times over the years to see what can be done about this issue and everyone acts like the house doesn't exist. I always get transferred to different departments and they all say call the bank...... But they never give a bank name. And its not just me, in 2020 I filed bankruptcy. The lawyer couldn't even get anywhere with USDA. Truth be told it doesn't even come up on my credit, but if you look at the public records in my town, I own this house.

{"title": "New almost 3 year neighbor thinks they own part of my property because seller told them they do.", "selftext": "There is so much to this story but the simplified version is this. \n\nI\u2019m in New Jersey. It\u2019s my mother\u2019s house, soon to be mine. 30 year adverse posession law applies.  \nEdit-they have not been there 30 years, neither was the person before, and it doesn\u2019t equal 30 years combined. \n\nOld man lived Nextdoor for a long time. During that time fences changed a few times, and apparently so did the natural grade to his property. He built it up 2\u2019 and put down pavers. \n\nMy mother used to complain about his noise over there (we live on small lots 75x100) but what can you do?\n\nThe last fence started to tip towards us. Meanwhile flooding came in gradually, but worsened over time. Mom\u2019s in Florida most of the year and I want to \u2018repair\u2019 the fence. So I tell the family and a son of the old man\u2019s cuts the fence with a chain saw. So I worked around it. Built my fence 7\u20193\u201d with 15\u201d of board on the bottom. Hoped to keep the pavers from spreading farther. Also trying to keep the peace. I live here, I don\u2019t want bad feelings. \n\nOld man dies. New family moves in. One night during a windstorm the fence cracks at ground level of 4, 4x4 ground contact posts and the fence is hanging. \n\nNow I get an official survey. I had a small copy, but I wanted markers. Survey shows I own a few feet onto that property. They get a survey (didn\u2019t before the sale though). Survey shows my guy was right. \n\nI explain to them about the flooding and the few feet of yard and ask that they remove the pavers form my two feet and I\u2019ll take care of the fence. \n\nNope. They tell me to call the town. I wait, but eventually I call. I did not file a complaint, but they did. Well, now zoning is involved. Great. No more, move your stone, I\u2019ll build an illegal 7\u20193 fence. Now everything has to be to code. \n\nI explain to them and zoning how bad their yard is. Whole yard is pavers and it\u2019s built up two feet. \n\nTo get it to code they have to have the pavers 5 feet from the property line and the yard has to be to original grade. I tell them I have a plan that doesn\u2019t require them ripping out 5 feet of pavers all around their yard and dig back down to grade. \n\nZoning said he\u2019ll consider my plan if I draw it up. It does not benefit me. It makes everything more expensive and still have to have an obnoxious tall wall in my yard. But it saves them thousands. And it will work. \n\nWent there for the second time to ask for access to (my own yard) via their gate. And explain my idea. \n\nAfter much screaming on the wife\u2019s part, I gave up. Husband won\u2019t work with me because wife thinks the seller knows best. \n\nThey said this is a \u2018land grab\u2019 (it\u2019s a two foot strip which is a lot considering the lot sizes, and it\u2019s not theirs) and I can\u2019t get away with it. They Said Kenny (old man\u2019s son and across the street  neighbor) said \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 that they own it. \nClaim there is a process. Zoning disagrees, I was told to call the police, ask for supervision and cut their side gate off my property. They said I can\u2019t because they have dogs and can\u2019t have the gate open two feet. They think I owe them a fenced in yard. \n\nI said get a fence around your own property, I don\u2019t owe you a fence. They said I can\u2019t tell them what to do and they don\u2019t want a fence. \n\nDo I just call a real estate attorney or call the cops and chop my way into my yard???\n\nEDIT-thank you everyone for taking the time to give me insight and advice. I will update as I go. \n\nUPDATE-\nNeighbor is removing all encroaching pavers from the perimeter of his yard (including by my fence. \n\nHe\u2019s also getting a fence of his own, so we will be double walled off from each other.  \n\nWhen he removes whatever he\u2019s going to remove, I\u2019m going to put my fence on that (ground height) and build a retaining wall on my side, (it won\u2019t be very high once some material is gone, and that will allow me to go as high as necessary to prevent flooding. \n\nThanks everyone for your advice and support.

{"title": "Neighbors thinks they owns land we bought", "selftext": "So my fianc\u00e9e bought a house in September of last year that included four parcels of land. One the house sits on, two others enclosed by a fence, and a fourth dilapidated, dumped on, and overgrown plot behind the house and the other two fenced in lots. The dilapidated lot is what our neighbors are giving us problems over. We want to clean and improve our land as we see fit.\n\nThese neighbors want to cut down the trees on the property to control mosquito populations, and while I personally don\u2019t like the trees there either, since they\u2019re invasive, them making any improvements to that land might give them an avenue to claim it through adverse possession. Especially considering they\u2019ve lived there for 12 years. Though the land is unimproved at all.\n\nSee, the houses on their street own a strip or block of land behind them as a separate parcel, and the pattern is only broken when it comes to their houses, of which they each only own their house and maybe 8 ft behind them as part of a driveway that goes between the houses and the land each house owns behind them (except for the parcel my fianc\u00e9e owns). They keep pointing towards the other houses as the basis for their claim.\n\nI tried to explain to them that the situation the other houses have over ownership of the land behind them is not necessarily true for them, and we have the deed and title to the land they\u2019re talking about. I looked up their names on the country recorder of deeds, and the GIS map confirmed, with references to landmarks, that both of them only have one deed each that only described their house, and that we own the land I\u2019m talking about in this post. There are still survey stakes in place that the previous owner put in when selling the property to us (my fianc\u00e9e, really).\n\nNot only that, but the ownership history of that parcel of land never described their name or the names of those who lived in their house before them.\n\nThey won\u2019t listen to me. Apparently one of them went to the borough council and someone likely erroneously told her she did own a piece of our land despite having no titles to it (and the fact that the council doesn\u2019t deal with property titles in the first place).\n\nI\u2019ve put up no trespassing signs and asked them to not dump anything on our land, as I found out today her son was doing. I\u2019m thinking of placing cameras on the property and filing a police report if they continue to treat the land as theirs. Especially if they keep dumping on it or remove the trees.\n\nDo I have any other recourse that won\u2019t cost an arm and a leg like getting a second survey done or retaining a lawyer? Or should I ignore them, go to the city council and present the overwhelming evidence of ownership we have, or just carry on without any additional actions?\n\nI think the documents speak for themselves, and as far as I can tell, they\u2019re just going by what they \u201cfeel like\u201d is theirs.\n\n\n======================================\n**!! Update !!**\n\nWe have the survey that was conducted before the sale. The property being disputed is 100% ours. There are stakes and pins denoting property boundary. I doubt the neighbor will accept the survey but my next recourse will be to fence the area in, which we\u2019re already planning to do.\n\nSince we have the survey that shows the property is ours, we\u2019re just going to proceed as normal. Nothing the city council can say, if they ever said anything at all. If the neighbors still dispute it, they\u2019ll have to perform their own survey. We plan on cleaning a strip of the land and moving part of our fence there, in compliance with the deed restriction that said we must allow a portion of that land to function as a driveway joint with all of our other neighbors. If they trespass, police report and lawsuit. Simple as that. I don\u2019t doubt that they\u2019ll probably be more covert with their dumping so we gotta put up our fence ASAP and we already have a camera pointed at the lot (I\u2019m planning on getting a wired camera for a better direct feed). Today (Sunday) would have been the perfect opportunity to do some of the groundwork for this, but we were busy pretty much all day.

{"title": "I live in a cardboard box", "selftext": "My goal is to get commiseration. And to vent. And maybe be a cautionary tale. If that's not allowed, let me know. \n\nTL;DR: My house is made of paper and cardboard. And I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege.\n\nWhen we bought this house 10 yrs ago, I wasn't in love with the exterior. Someone described it as burnt orange and having burnt anything in the name of your exterior house color is bad, personal opinion. But the inside was great and there was potential for the outside so I said to myself with the naive optimism of a first time home buyer, \"it's okay that it's the color of diarrhea poo, we'll change it!\"\n\nWe knew going in that our house had a type of compressed paper siding that was all the rage for a year or two in the 70s but then quickly fell out of favor when people realized it was absolute trash. They said \"just keep it painted, you'll be fine.\" That is not in fact true.\n\nWhen we first bought the place I wanted to paint it but it was expensive ($12k) and we had just bought a house and weren't flush with cash. So I waited. I got a few more quotes and was ready to pull the trigger in late 2017 but then the painter told me he couldn't in good conscience take my money because most of my siding was rotted. You can apparently still get the siding for minor repairs but it's fairly expensive and he showed me at least four large spots where the siding sounded different and he said it was rot. He told me to just replace everything. Painting wouldn't even buy us 2 years because most likely the old owners painted over what was already rotting and you can't undo rot with paint.\n\nI ended up getting a quote for replacement siding in mid 2019 on the order of $25k. I was like fine, we'll save another few months and do siding plus some other exterior stuff. Then the pandemic hit and we're like \"we might lose a job!\" (we luckily didn't) and we waited until early 2021. Signed a contract in January, had a woodpecker incident in March, but I didn't care because finally, no more games of \"is this dog shit the same color as our house?\". \n\nWe're good little savers so we made sure we saved for the cost of the reno ($40k) plus the 10% contingency because this isn't our first rodeo. I'm so ready for this. All projects have scope and cost creep but I know that, so I make sure we're budgeting for it. I talk to my friends about renovations with authority because I've been there, I've done that. \n\nThey started yesterday. \n\nI meet the crew with breakfast burritos because I know how to ingratiate myself with people and because I'm just so damn happy to see them. All chipper and happy I leave my husband to deal with the real project management while I go to work, having done my part.\n\nJust as I pull in to my work he calls. He goes \"there's a problem\". Now I'm kind of laughing because when we redid the bathroom he greeted me with \"there's a leek in our bathroom\" and I run up there all freaked out to find a fucking leek in the fucking bathroom and him laughing his ass off. I know his games.\n\nSo as he tells me that our sheathing is made of cardboard I'm only half paying attention, wondering what vegetable is sheathing. Because it can't be that sheathing would be made of cardboard, that's ludicrous. What builder would do that? Probably the builder that went out of business for cutting so many corners, like installing recalled electrical panels that don't actually flip the breaker but just go halfway, causing arcing and house fires (replaced in 2012). Or the kind that use a single 4x4, resting directly on the dirt, as a support pole for the main beam because a metal pole in concrete is not worth it (fixed in 2016). But cardboard sheathing? No way. That's not a real thing.\n\nMy husband and my conversation goes something like:\n\nHim: \"Our house's sheathing is made of cardboard.\"\n\nMe: \"Like Amazon boxes?\" \n\nHim: \"no, not like Amazon boxes. Like poster board.\"\n\nMe: \"Good because those boxes are pretty flimsy.\"\n\nHim: \"This is not like the leek thing. This is serious.\"\n\nAnyway, normal sheathing is apparently made of lumber. Do you know what there is a major shortage of? Lumber! For some reason my house has 3/16th cardboard where there should be lumber. This is also unique to my house because both my neighbors had their siding redone and I don't remember there being cardboard instead of plywood, there was fucking plywood. The same shitty paper siding but legit sheathing underneath. (They do have another house style so maybe they had a different builder than we did)\n\nThe best part is that in the background I can hear the project manager and foreman cursing in both English and Spanish which is always reassuring. The best is when I hear \"fuuuuuck, even under the deck?!\" because I know that this means it's bad.\n\nWhy are they upset, you might ask. It's another 2 days of guaranteed work and they know I can't go anywhere else. But they didn't count on having to sheath a house in addition to the siding and apparently a different crew does sheathing and they are doing new builds. And we have the deck crew, which is yet another set of people, scheduled to come today to start pouring concrete for the supports but now they can't because instead they have to reroute the sheathing crew to come out and clad my house in OSB.\n\nSo it's really like an extra two weeks of my house being a trash heap because they can't get the lumber until tomorrow and they aren't going to start Friday afternoon because they don't work weekends so we're looking at sheathing being completed Monday afternoon, hopefully Monday + 2 days to actually put on new siding, then the deck crew is already busy so we'll have to wait until that following Monday to start on the deck.\n\nAnd it's $10k in extra cost for me, which is fun. It's not like I can be like \"nah, let's call the whole thing off\" because there's no siding in places and there's woodpecker damage (incidentally, the only place where there is wood sheathing because it was added in the early aughts) and it's not like I can return the materials I already bought and they can't (and shouldn't) mount to cardboard.\n\nSo here I am. Blew through my contingency and then some within an hour of starting my project. Got the scope creep crept. My whole schedule is now stretched from 1 week to almost three. But hey, at least at the end of this I won't have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to live in a shit-colored cardboard box!\n\n(Just for your peace of mind: we have the money in savings,. we'll be okay, I know this isn't the end of the world, but right at this moment, it sure feels that way to me)\n\nHope your day is better than mine!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/n17fx8/i_live_in_a_cardboard_box/", "created_utc": 1619711750.0, "score": 816, "author": "BaaBaaTurtle", "num_comments": 232, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/n17fx8/i_live_in_a_cardboard_box/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Neighbor using our yard", "selftext": "My husband and I are building a house on a lot that was gifted to us by my parents. My parents had 5 acres and gifted us 1. It's a long rectangular lot, with my parents house on one end and ours on the other.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, the previous neighbor (behind the lot that I'm building on now) cut down woods on my parents property to extend their own yard. They cut about 20 feet onto the property, totaling a space of 0.1 acre. My parents talked to the homeowner at the time (who claimed they thought it was theirs), but did not pursue legal action. \n\nFastforward 20 years and the new owners have been in the house for 10 years. These neighbors have apparently used that property since they moved in - they've mowed it, have a firepit on it, and have been dumping their yard waste well onto our lot. I had a brief (and slightly hostile) interaction with one of the homeowners, who said she was aware that section of land wasn't hers. Additionally, the property was staked out by a surveyor three years ago so it is clear where the property lines are. \n\nI want to go talk with these neighbors about how I am the new owner and would like them to stop using that section of our property. I want to know what my rights are and if there is anything I need to be prepared for before I go speak with them - or if I should go straight to lawyer first.

{"title": "Had a neighbor\u2019s car towed and feel bad now", "selftext": "Just need to share this with others who may understand. \n\nI have a driveway in a busier residential area, and have had frequent issues with cars blocking some or all of my driveway lately. Usually it just makes a really hard entrance / exit for my truck if they park too close, but once in a while someone parks halfway across the driveway (and it\u2019s a visitor). \n\nI came home tonight and there was a car parked over the edge of the curb (into my driveway), and I couldn\u2019t get into the driveway without doing a 10-point turn.  I went across the street but no one answered, and texted another neighbor (not his) - they were the most likely owners. I called down to the local police station to see if they could come help me get someone to move it. When the officer came, he told me the registration was expired and they would have to tow it. \n\nShortly after, two of my young neighbors were at my door asking what had happened. I explained the situation and told them I had tried to find anyone at their house, but they didn\u2019t hear the doorbells (multiple). They\u2019re young kids and didn\u2019t realize what had happened, and I felt bad about it all in hindsight. I helped them track it down at the lot and gave them advice about the registration, and offered to give them a ride the next day to get their car. \n\nJust sharing because I feel torn about the situation. It\u2019s been happening more and more to many on our street with visitors or renters parking multiple cars without permits, and blocking driveways or taking spots from people with permits. So we\u2019re all a little on edge when it makes it hard to come and go from our homes, and want to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen more frequently - but I feel a little bad about how it all turned out for the neighbors (I remember being that young and having a car towed was a major cost / inconvenience to get through).\n\nEdit;  You all are awesome!  Thanks for giving me some good perspective on the whole situation. \n\nPS: the worst part of it all - there was about 5-6 feet between them and the car behind them, so it wasn\u2019t a case of them trying really hard to squeeze into a spot and not extend into my driveway.

{"title": "Update: Neighbor cut down my 30 + ft oak tree and trimmed 3 others without my permission.", "selftext": "First I want to say if you are reading this and replied to my last post, I am so deeply appreciative of all the support I received. You all gave me a lot of courage to move forward and do more digging.\n\nSo, last weekend I knocked on my neighbors door and he invited me inside. I wanted to hear what he had to say before I made any movements. His first question was, \"Well, what do you think?!?!\" Then I proceeded to give him a dressing down. I told him plainly, I don't see my tree anymore, the 3 others have been completely hacked away at and that he wasn't given my permission to do any of this. He just acted dumbfounded and said that he was sorry and thought he had my permission. I then proceeded to push at why I wasn't notified like his two adjacent neighbors that there would be tree work happening that day. He had the nerve to tell me, well it wasn't really on your property. I asked how so, because there is no fence? And that was his reasoning. I called bullshit and said the tree and the land they were on is my property and I deserved that much of a heads up even if he'd had my permission. We surprisingly went back and forth on this point a little bit because he just didn't understand how that was necessary, then he apologized again. Then I asked for his report he had done on my tree before he decided to chop it down. He said he didn't have one but he had the quote for the work and he shared it with me. So I made note of the company's name and told him how disappointing this whole ordeal was, that I was still digesting everything and when I was ready to speak again he would be hearing from me. \n\nThe company finally answered my call today and I heard there side of the story. They said he didn't tell them the property the oaks were on wasn't his, and it's written into his contract that he was responsible for falsely identifying his land. I told them I wasn't satisfied with this answer since it was across the road from him. They said it was a pretty common occurrence in rural areas for folks to own land across the road from them. I pushed back and asked that it hadn't even crossed their minds it might not be his and to double check? They said he seemed like an honest older man and he told them the adjacent properties weren't his but made no mention of mine not being his land. I then asked where my wood from the tree was and they said he wrote it into the contract to have it taken to the dump!!! Luckily a fellow neighbor down the road drove by and asked if they could have it.... so at least it didn't go to waste. I just couldn't believe thats where he was going to send the wood. There are so many people who can benefit from firewood. I asked them to send me a copy of the contract since it involves my property and they agreed they would send it over asap. I have yet to receive it, but the company quickly brought over seasoned oak firewood and asked me to let them know if there was anything else they could do, to reach out at anytime and that they were sincerely sorry for what happened to my trees. \n\nSo as of now, I'm still mulling everything over. I'm pleased the tree company has as far as I know been transparent and that they are making an effort to make the wrong right. I get the sense they know they are in hot water.  My rulings not out and I want to see this contract. I have an arborist coming out this week to do a report on the damages then I will be consulting with a lawyer to take a civil suit out against my neighbor. Put simply he marginalized me, disrespected me and my property and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have happened if I had a man living on my land. So that's where I'm at. I miss my old oaks and just wish none of this ever happened.

{"title": "Facing $ tens of thousands in costs after sinkhole. In sixth year of mortgage. Insurance denied claim. Terrified and seeking advice.", "selftext": "I'll try to start with a brief summation:\n\n1) Sinkhole appeared in driveway one morning a couple of months ago. It's about 3 ft in diameter at the surface and goes ~14 ft deep. The very relevant part here is that it's dangerously close in proximity to part of my home's foundation.\n\n\n2) Immediately filed homeowners insurance claim and was swiftly denied, citing exclusions in my policy. Sinkholes are part of an exclusion group with \"earthquakes, landslides and other earth movements\". \n\n\n3) Frustrated and panicked, proceeded to get in touch with local contractors for quotes on how to deal with this type of problem. Had one foundation company essentially say, \"I mean, we can fill this hole for you. But we cannot be held liable if the hole opens up more down the line. You should first obtain the services of a geotechnical engineer to survey the sinkhole and go from there.\"\n\n\n4) Hired a geotechnical engineering company for $3500. They came out and surveyed our property a few weeks ago and gave us their report a couple of days ago. The bottom line of their findings is this: \n\n[Based on the conditions observed, it is probable that the existing karst feature spatially extends beneath the existing home (which would result in a stability issue for the structure and a critical safety issue). We strongly recommend the homeowner IMMEDIATELY engages a contractor with experience in the \r\nstabilization of karst features for remediation and underpinning of the structure as necessary. A structural engineer should also examine the house to identify structural issues caused as the result of the sinkhole formation.]\n\n\nThat brings this to today. My head is spinning and I feel so defeated. I am desperately seeking a practical way forward and I don't know how to navigate this. The home is small (1200 SQ ft) but it's our life. We don't have anything significant in savings. Coming up with the $3500 for the first engineering fee was a massive feat for me. My wife has extreme anxiety over this. Like, borderline compromising her ability to be a functional adult at times. I have two kids. It hit me today for the first time that one possible outcome to all of this is the abandonment of our property. \n\n\nShould I tell my mortgage company what's going on and let them know that homeowners insurance denied helping me with anything? It's been suggested to me that some of these impending costs to make my property and home safe could potentially cost nearly what my home itself is worth. \n\n\nI just need help organizing my options and how to make sense of all of this. If you have any ideas or advice, I'd greatly appreciate your time. Thank you.\n\nEDIT (following morning): I'm overwhelmed by the range of responses! Thank you so much. I have a lot to sift through and I need to arrange some time off just to make calls and visit different offices. I will update as I can for anyone interested in following.\n\nEDIT 2: today at work I was able to forward the engineering report to three different contractors for review and ideas. I also spoke to one of the engineers who echoed what the report said, and advised me not to panic, but to definitely begin remediation work ASAP and get the house stabilized. I asked him point blank that if this were his house would he vacate for immediate safety? He said would pay close attention to weird sounds within the house and for any visible changes to the structure (there are none as far as I can tell -- no cracks, etc), and to secure a contractor quickly. \n\nI plan to take a day off next week from work just to make tons of calls and to visit a few offices in my area, thanks to all of your suggestions.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/15hp089/facing_tens_of_thousands_in_costs_after_sinkhole/", "created_utc": 1691120309.0, "score": 786, "author": "RenegadeSteak", "num_comments": 367, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/15hp089/facing_tens_of_thousands_in_costs_after_sinkhole/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Our neighbors naked children in their backyard are causing an issue for us (and others)", "selftext": "**EDITING: I\u2019m going to use my backyard. I\u2019m sitting out here now. If the woman says anything, she can kick rocks. We pay a mortgage here the same way she does. Thank you for those giving me the confidence to stand up for myself. It\u2019s nice being able to enjoy our water fountains and watch my dog run around for more than just potty time. And yes, she\u2019s currently watching me. Hope she enjoys the view of me in my Adirondack chair. Cheers!**\n\nPurchased our house a decade ago. A couple moved in about 6-7 years ago and have three children aged (now) 8 and under. \n\nThis couple allows their children to run around naked in their backyard. There was a chain link fence between our backyard and theirs, so we invested in a privacy fence to avoid seeing their children without clothing all the time. We have approached the female about this and she doesn\u2019t seem to care. There was one time I was on FaceTime with my father and later the woman asked me if I was out filming her kids. Because of this, I no longer take my phone out back with me. No, I\u2019m not exaggerating. \n\nOnce we put up a $13,000 privacy fence, they purchased a trampoline and put it up against the fence line. Which is totally fine. Except now we\u2019re seeing naked children jumping in the air. She not only has an 8, 5 and 4 year old running around naked - but she also seems to have play dates where **other** children are back there without any clothing on. These children are outside, some days, starting at 7-8am and goes until sun down 5 out of 7 days if not more. \n\nBecause of this, my husband refuses to go in the backyard. Being a male, he doesn\u2019t want to be viewed as someone who purposely goes out back with these children (still) in view, naked. I\u2019ve now had to resort to taking my dogs out for potty time and not take my phone with me. Otherwise I don\u2019t want the neighbor asking if I\u2019m recording them. It\u2019s getting a little out of hand. \n\nWe\u2019ve put so much money and time into our backyard. Especially during Covid, we made it our oasis. Furniture, gazebo, water fountains, landscaping. Now it\u2019s sitting unless we go out to do yard work like cutting the lawn. We\u2019re terrified to go back there because it\u2019s all we see \u2014 naked children. When we do go out there, they\u2019ve also put up a large playhouse next to the fence line where sometimes the mother will sit and watch me when I come outside. Almost as if to say, \u201cyou better not\u201d. It\u2019s weird. It\u2019s strange. And there are a few other neighbors who\u2019ve since put up privacy fences for this very reason. \n\nWe have to close all our blinds on the back side of our home now as well because of this. One? We don\u2019t want to see it. Two? Because we don\u2019t want to walk by a window, look out at something and be accused of ogling these naked children. Our backyard and their backyard back up to one another. They see the back of our house and we see theirs. So you have an idea of the setup. \n\nKeep in mind we\u2019ve already tried to address it with this woman and have gotten nowhere. Is there anything else we can do? Her husband is military and never home, so we\u2019ve never spoken to him. To be frank and as polite as possible, I don\u2019t see him being of any assistance either. \n\nWe don\u2019t want them to feel like they cannot do as they please with their home and backyard. But right now them doing what they want is at our expense and others. We are now the third neighbors that have put up a privacy fence because of these children running around naked. I have only seen them on with clothes when there is snow on the ground.\n\nThank you for your time in advance getting through this novel.

My neighbors gf/friend/idk came out asking what happened and stood there the entire time.

They kept brushing us off saying they\u2019d move them once he came out to do the work. Not super shocking but not a single vehicle ran, they said they had injuries and couldn\u2019t help.

He downed a bottle of tequila, cut my bushes, redecorated my fence panels(like why?), and mowed my grass all at 3am. I drove home and called the non emergency line, they expressed how busy they were and that emergencies come first. I was able to have a phone call with an officer but he said no one could come out that day and he wouldn\u2019t be able to use my ring footage anyway. He said I can work on getting him trespassed, I just need to call the non emergency # when he\u2019s in my yard, BUT my neighbor has to stay there long enough for them to see he was there themselves. I did a little google search and saw this neighbor has felonies and charges ranging from DUIs to assaulting police officers to animal cruelty.

The neighbor was informed that the first 20\u2019 from the curb is township ROW and not his property and we are free to put our trashcan there. He went on to say that the neighbor went to the next township meeting and wanted a new ordinance passed that states that trashcans must be placed directly in front of the owner\u2019s property. He was told that the supervisors would not do that.  He also said that the same neighbor complained that we didn\u2019t rake the leaves in our front yard. It is a heavily wooded area that would be almost impossible to rake. There is no ordinance that leaves have to be raked and also said that he did get a call from the fencing contractor to make sure we can put up a fence. He suggested that we definitely follow through with that. \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nOur house was the first built in our neighborhood. We have almost no restrictions except those that are law in our municipality. Every house built after has lots of restrictions and an hoa was formed to enforce. It is voluntary and we have not joined nor participated in their yearly meetings (yes, one a year and dues are $10) We received a call from someone we knew even before buying our house who is on the board that we will be getting a letter telling us to clean up our yard. We had a fire 2 years ago and are just moving back in. The trash our neighbor is complaining about is the frame for our hammock, the basketball net and a small plastic storage shed that had to be moved while the outside of the house was worked on.  \nafter the fire, no one offered assistance. They did complain to the township that our yard was messy because pieces of our house were in the back yard for 6 weeks while insurance did everything needed for their investimation and we had to wait for their ok to clean up or they would not pay for the clean up and rebuilding.  \nthe things in our yard have been there for 18 months. The only difference now is that we have moved back in with3 teenagers who all drive.  They do not want us here because everyone around us but one family is all retired couples. when we had the fire we had one teen that drove my car. Everyone now has their own so we have 5 cars coming and going.

I\u2019m not sure the model because he just bought it.  \nwe had a next door neighbor run at me across his front yard while yelling at me that I can\u2019t put my trash can where I put it as I took our trash down the driveway for the first time since we moved back in. The trash can was in the street in front of the curb. I was home alone with 3 teen girls so I called the police.

{"title": "Why is everything about resale?", "selftext": "At what point did Americans stop seeing their homes as a place to live and start seeing their homes as a liquid asset/investment? So many people make decisions on how to live in their homes based on resale value. It feels so... Weird to me. Impersonal. They aren't homes anymore, just a hot commodity.\n\nHouses use to be filled with charm and personal style and family photos and now everything is just gray and standard and empty. Because of \"resale.\"\n\nJust an observation. We are getting ready to gut our kitchen. I am designing the kitchen I was to cook in. Resale be damned.\n\nETA: I never expected this conversation to take off like it has, so thank you for all of the interesting discussion.\n\nIt's seems like, in summary, the general consensus is: the concept of a \"forever home\" doesn't really exist anymore. This is due to a number of inter-related factors, most notably: a lack of job longevity, HGTV and its influence on culture, our move away from a savings economy and our growing reliance on homeownership as a \"savings\" or retirement mechanism, a lack of arts/design education, the dissolution of many community mechanisms that might anchor families or individuals to a single community, social media, and the boom of flipping houses as a business model.\n\nThere is also a wide range/spectrum of philosophies among the comments, everything from those \"going against the grain\" and making their homes truly their own, to those who understand for their own personal circumstances, it just doesn't make sense to get attached to a house.\n\nIn some of the comments, I do think I failed to properly explain my POV, so I gave it some thought last night and here's what I mean by \"resale be damned\": I am pouring far more money into my house than I will ever see back. This house is a 1940s cape cod with 1400 sq ft of living space. By today's standards, it is small. When we redo the kitchen and replace the wiring and the plumbing and remediate the lead and the asbestos and put in the countertops we want, and the flooring we want (greenish blue hex tile because I think it's pretty), we will end up with a home that is beautiful to us and our family, but it will not be the best \"investment\" - we are doing it for our every day living, not for a return should we ever be forced to sell. \n\nI am not, contrary to some of the comments here, advocating for trashing one's house or letting it go to pot. Quite the opposite, actually. Many here are using replacing the roof as an example of resale value return - but you should replace the roof of your house, not because of resale, but because your house needs a new roof and water damage/mold is far more expensive to deal with. If you can afford it, do it - take care of your space.\n\nI do think, after reading these comments, that people have a very short memory when it comes to real estate. We have seen tremendous growth in recent times in home prices, but I very much remember a time when the market tanked and tons of people were \"upside down\" in their houses. This is where I think the investment mindset can hurt people, if they think their home is always going to appreciate. It's tied to market trends like anything else. If you want to truly save, without risk - put your money in bonds or in a high yield savings account. Don't put it in a house. When we start blindly assuming that more house = higher return - I think that is a dangerous expectation.\n\nBut I think those who hold onto their houses longer, those who don't treat them as investments, but as places to live, can usually weather the market better because they can ride out the ups and downs. From my own personal perspective (and I am happy to hear others on this), the real \"investment\" of homeownership is that, unlike rent, your mortgage payment stays relatively the same, save for taxes. We bought our house 15 years ago and have a sub-3% interest rate. Our mortgage, with taxes, is less than what it would cost to rent a 1 BR apartment in our market today. Our fixed expenses are controlled. \n\nFinally - I think one big downside of the investment mindset, which we are already seeing (and which I haven't communicated very effectively until now) is that when people see housing as something for \"the next guy\" - it can becomes a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Like \"I am not going to stay here long, so rather than do the work that is needed, I am going to slap a bandaid on it because I won't see a return on that.\" And, so, you end up passing the buck to the next guy.\n\nAs I mentioned previously - when we gut our kitchen, we are doing all of the \"stuff\" that is needed to bring that space up to modern code. We will never see that money back. And I doubt that, if I had a short-term mindset, that I would bother. \n\nAnd finally, I think some of what I am seeing and not communicating effectively is \"pride of ownership\" but also - the lack of personal affects in spaces. I mentioned cookbooks somewhere and someone pointed out, rightfully, that books on shelves is not about resale. So I asked myself why the books stood out to me and realized - people don't bother to personalize their spaces unless they expect to be there for a while. My friend with the joyful house bursting with color and books - she admitted she could never move because packing up would be a nightmare. And I do think it's related to this discussion because I am realizing - I just don't see a lot of personalization anymore and it's probably indicative of the fluidity of home ownership. But I miss it, whether it's logical or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1gdz1yd/why_is_everything_about_resale/", "created_utc": 1730112610.0, "score": 737, "author": "None", "num_comments": 527, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1gdz1yd/why_is_everything_about_resale/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This morning they kicked my storm door in and I have questions about how to handle the situation.\n\n\nI have a Ring doorbell and every morning I see a group of three young boys (probably around 12 or 13 years old) cut across my front yard on their way to catch the bus. I don\u2019t know where they live, but I do know it\u2019s somewhere behind me. My backyard is fenced but my neighbor\u2019s is not, so they walk through my neighbor\u2019s backyard, up between our houses, and then across my front yard. At first I didn\u2019t mind too much, but it made me a little nervous because there\u2019s a steep slope from my yard to my driveway that I\u2019ve personally slipped down more times than I\u2019d like to admit, and the last thing I wanted was for a kid to slip and bust their head. These kids have now started to walk across my garden stones, across my porch, and down the stairs. I\u2019ve caught them on the camera many times messing around in the garden bed, messing with the stuff on my porch, and sometimes even throwing things at my front door. This all happens after my fianc\u00e9 and I leave for work so we\u2019ve never had the opportunity to confront them, and because I don\u2019t know where exactly they live, I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s door to knock on to talk to their parents. \n\nThis morning, the boys took their shortcut but stopped in my driveway and huddled up for a few seconds. Then one of them turned around, ran up the stairs, and donkey kicked my storm door. It\u2019s cold here and the kid was wearing a balaclava over his face so I don\u2019t know which one did it. I went home to check it out and I now have a sizable dent in my door. I can let it slide if they\u2019re messing around with my porch decorations, but I\u2019m pissed about the property damage. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do about the situation. This is my first home and I bought it earlier this year, so I don\u2019t have any experience dealing with anything like this. Do I shrug it off and hope it doesn\u2019t continue to happen? Do I file a police report? The police aren\u2019t going to care at all, but should it be documented in the event they become more brazen and damage more of my property? How can I deter them from walking through my garden/porch, or stay off of my property all together? I know I sound like a crotchety old man by saying that, but after today I do not want them near my house anymore. I\u2019ve had zero interaction with these kids. I don\u2019t know who they are or why they seem to be targeting my house. From what I can see on my Ring, they don\u2019t seem to bother any of my neighbors. My fianc\u00e9 wants to stay home tomorrow morning to confront them, but I\u2019m sure that will just paint a bigger target on our house.\n\nHas anyone had to deal with something similar?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/186v5k4/unknown_neighbor_kids_kickedin_my_storm_door_and/", "created_utc": 1701279427.0, "score": 729, "author": "chalamets_pesca", "num_comments": 510, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/186v5k4/unknown_neighbor_kids_kickedin_my_storm_door_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

We got an offer for $279k after only 2 days on the market. Agent pushed us to accept. Buyers were using VA loan.

We would have also been responsible to fix the landscape. Our basements never flooded or had any water issues in the past 5 years we lived here. Our prior inspection also notes basement is in above average condition. We got our own inspection done and were advised there was just a little moisture in a corner of the basement wall due to clogged downspout. Would cost less than $500 to unclog and again no other crazy issues. We sent back our counter and said no way to waterproofing the basement but would credit them $1000 to have the basement drylocked and downspout unclogged. Happy to say they cancelled the deal!

{"title": "A little extra cash may save your life", "selftext": "I\u2019m posting this here in the homeowner sub but this cautionary tale goes for anyone living in an inclosed space. \n\nA week ago I started to have furnace troubles.  My furnace would not light.  I called the appropriate repair people and the diagnosis was that a gas valve was going bad.  As most of everyone knows, the US is experiencing a polar vortex and I was not an exception to that.  I knew of a way to keep the furnace lit and it seemed safe.  I would just tap on the gas valve when I knew it would need to turn on and usually it would light up.  I\u2019m cheap so instead of fixing or replacing my furnace, I wanted to see what my home protection plan would cover.  I figured a week of this would not be horrible, as sometimes it would take 24 hours for it to repeat the failure.  \n\nOn the same day my furnace started having problems, the smoke alarm in my daughters room started acting up.  I removed the alarm and the alarm defect stopped.  That was in the morning and after work I stopped at a big box store to look for a replacement smoke detector.  I never realized there were so many different types and I stood in the isle wonder what I should do.  For some reason I had it set in my mind that I should get smoke detector and carbon monoxide combo.  Also, since my home is 15 years old, I decided I should just replace all my alarms.  Looking at my options, each detector was 26 bucks.  I needed 7 and bought 2 4 packs.  \n\nI am notorious for putting off tasks around the house.  Some is laziness some is I work a lot.  I told my wife on Friday that I would get to installing the new detectors sometime.  Usually that means in a week to 3 months.\n\nSunday was a lazy day/cleaning day for my family.  In a break from my chores my son asked if I would install 1 alarm.  He\u2019s autistic and hyper focuses on things like that and he REALLY REALLY wanted to hear the detectors talk since I got the talking version.  So I obliged him and installed one.  I had to remove the old wiring as it didn\u2019t match up to the new one, but was much easier than expected so I decided to just install all of them.  In an hour and a half they were all up.  On a side note, I found out 3 of them were not wired into the house wiring.  Awesome I thought, as I had peace of mind that they all were new and installed properly. \n\nLast night my furnace was giving me more fits.  I decided that I was done waiting for insurance and I will pay to replace the furnace and hopefully get reimbursed if the failure was covered.  I finally got the furnace to light and I cranked the heat so the temp would be higher if it turned off.  I went to bed with out a second thought in my mind.  \n\nAround 2 am this morning I was awoken to the alarms.  \u201cBeep beep beep Carbon Monoxide detected\u201d. I sprung out of bed and flew to the basement and turned the furnace off.  Not sure why but that was my first thought.  As I raced back up stairs my wife was getting my kids out of bed and dressed.  I was out of it having been woken up out of a amazingly deep sleep.  I was not in the right mind and my wife said we needed to get in our car.  I didn\u2019t think there was a problem, but for some reason my stubborn self didn\u2019t argue.  We went to our garage got in the car and started warming it up (with the garage door open).  My wife is a safely sally and demanded we call the fire department.  While she called I went back in to open a door and window to air the place out.  I made it half way up my upstairs when I hear my name bing called.  I hollered back but no answer.  I walked 3 more steps and heard my name CLEARLY and hollered unmistakenly loud.  No answer.  It was then I realized that there was for sure a CO leak in my house and I booked it as fast as I could back outside.  My wife had already talked to the fire department and they said they were on their way and in 5-8 minutes they showed up.  I told the fire fighters what was up and they entered my house.  In less than 2 minutes they were back out.  They said they didn\u2019t even make it to my furnace when their meters were going off.  They cautioned me in what I should and shouldn\u2019t do.  We decided to stay with family for the night and left my home safely.  \n\nIf you made it this far in my story you really don\u2019t need a summary but I\u2019ll give one.  Had I not bought combo alarms, My family and I might be dead.  Had I procrastinated on installing the smoke/CO alarms, my family might be dead.  Had I not followed my wife\u2019s lead, we all might be dead.  Had I wanted to save some money and bought cheaper alarms, we all might be dead.  Honestly it was the best 200 bucks I\u2019ve ever spent and the alarms have already paid for themself.  If your alarms are old, look into replacing them.  If you don\u2019t have CO alarms, get one for every floor.  Thanks for reading and stay safe in this frigid weather!\n\nTLDR: I installed smoke/CO alarms on Sunday.  Last night the CO alarm went off from a bad furnace, likely saving me and my family\u2019s lives.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/llgo6a/a_little_extra_cash_may_save_your_life/", "created_utc": 1613518346.0, "score": 711, "author": "None", "num_comments": 140, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/llgo6a/a_little_extra_cash_may_save_your_life/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Pro tip: Don\u2019t skimp on primer for old walls!\n* Cleaning supplies & restocking: $500. Kept what we could, but needed new brooms, mops, and pantry staples. Moving from rentals, we didn\u2019t own much household stuff.\n* New drill for TV mounting: $200. Snagged a solid Milwaukee DIY set with bits. My car tools didn\u2019t cut it for household projects\u2014new game, new gear (plus about $80 for the TV mounts).\n* Electrical upgrade for home office: $450. Some of the house is modernized (panel, appliances), but my office had ungrounded outlets. Ran a new line to the breaker. Safety first!\n* Gutters: $900. The dry basement and crawlspace had minor seepage from water pooling at the foundation. Gutters were a must to protect the house long-term.\n* Crawlspace TLC: $800. Fixed an exterior wall crack, laid a proper vapor barrier, and installed a commercial-grade dehumidifier with a pump to the basement sink. Had to buy a bucket, shovel, etc., to clean it out. Not glamorous, but no regrets.\n* Lawn care gear: $750. With spring here, I needed a mower, trimmer, edger, and a high-end leaf blower (small yard, so one battery works for all\u2014saved some cash!). The sidewalk and driveway look crisp now.\n\nThe furnace and water heater are only \\~5 years old, so we\u2019re good there.

My Dad always said, \u201cThere\u2019s always something to do when you own a home,\u201d and damn, he wasn\u2019t kidding. What I\u2019ve learned:\n\n* DIY is awesome but costly upfront. My car tools helped, but household tools were a whole new investment. Budget for basics if you\u2019re starting fresh.\n* Old houses = surprises. This 1950s gem needed electrical and water protection fixes we didn\u2019t expect. Prioritize safety and structural stuff over cosmetics.\n* Seasonal costs sneak up. Spring meant lawn gear.

{"title": "Neighbor's shed encroaches on our property, preventing us from building our house. How do I get this finally removed after battling him for a year?", "selftext": "My dad owns a vacant but desirable property in NY (neither of us currently reside there). He is passing the property along to me so I can build a house to live there. The property has been in my family since 1937. It took about $10k for him to get the title cleaned up with a lawyer.\n\nLast spring I had a survey done that showed the neighbors shed encroaches on the property by about 7' (setback is 12', so needs to move around 19' back). The neighbor even said to my surveyor that my dad \u201cshould just sell him the land\u201d. With this encroachment my dad is unable to pass along a clean title to me, and without a clean title I'm not able to secure a home-building loan.\n\nI was going to work with the neighbor to amicably remove the shed but he swiftly blocked my number and didn't answer his door when I was in town last August. I looked into the town codes and the penalty for the violation is $100 a week. He also does not have a permit for this shed, which is necessary per the towns code of any structure over 120sqft requiring a permit.\n\nSince I didn't live there I got the city involved. The building inspector told him to remove the shed from our property. Neighbor ignored and refused for about 5 months. Then the building inspector had the city attorney write him a letter in January giving him 60 days to respond. The inspector has not given us a copy of the letter, we've requested it multiple times now so I'm unsure of what all was said in the letter. I\u2019ve also requested that the inspector enforces the penalties as well as an injunction to padlock his shed for further use, those requests were ignored as well.\n\nWe didn't hear back for about 90 days from the neighbor after the attorneys letter, but he agreed to move the shed. Woohoo right? He then said we need to get surveyors to pin where he should move his shed so he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to do it twice\u201d. We have 3 different surveys of the property, and there are pins at each corner. I called our surveyor and it would be $700 to mark where he should move the shed. I felt that I shouldn\u2019t be responsible for getting his shed into compliance, this is his violation and I\u2019ve been patiently waiting and delaying an entire year. I don\u2019t care if he isn\u2019t within the full means of the 12\u2019 setback, he just needs it off my property to appease me at this point.\n\nInitially I was willing to get the surveyor out again and pay for it, but my concern is that if we do that he\u2019s still not going to move it in a timely manner and keep moving the goal posts for us. Neighbor even said it would \u201ctake 5 months after we pin the property\u201d. I don\u2019t know why he thinks it will take 5 months to move the shed, I called around and got quote from shed movers, one said they could do it next week for $575.\n\nI\u2019ve got a lawyer in my back pocket who will be my last ditch effort. It\u2019s expensive (a letter alone will be $1500) and will take a long time, so I don\u2019t love that idea. He said we could do a revokable license for the bit of land, but I\u2019m not giving the neighbor anything at this point. I want to put a driveway and definitely a fence there now too, so I\u2019ll need that land.\n\nAt this point I understand why my neighbor is being a jerk, he wants to get away with whatever he can. But I CAN\u2019T understand why the building inspector is letting him get away with everything. Why no penalties? Why no injunctions? He was very unhappy when I called the town clerk and asked for more information because the inspector doesn\u2019t answer mine. He\u2019s been so ineffective on this and it\u2019s having real repercussions for us. We\u2019re renting in HCOL area that we don\u2019t like and would love to have made progress this year to move asap. The neighbor should have racked up at least $4400 in penalties so far (and an additional $2k for the 5 months he wants to tack on). I feel like that would invoke actual pressure for him to move it, right?\n\nSo what is my next step here to get this done asap? Is there someone above the inspector with the city that can help me with this? How can I get the town to actually enforce the movement of this shed and its penalties without being such wet noodles about it?

My dog hates him, and barks like crazy. He told her to calm down last week which pissed me off. She is literally doing her job protecting my property. I told him exactly that, and not to give her any commands. He ignored me cause he is creepy, old, misogynistic? Apparently he looks into my backyard often as he was asking questions about current projects going on that he would only know about by spying when I'm not home. I get that he is lonely and isolated because all the neighborhood hates him. But it makes me feel so uncomfortable, invasion of my privacy. I don't want to go in the backyard at all. I kinda lost my temper yesterday when I was just bringing my trash bins back in. He kept yelling \"knock knock\" which I ignored as I wasn't in the mood to chat. He pops his head over the fence anyway. I snapped and told him to stop invading my privacy. He said he called out knock, knock. I told him that didn't matter as I didn't answer with any welcome. \n\nAm I being unrealistic here? I want to replace the fence soon, which will require his cooperation for worker access. I'll be paying the entire cost for it, so nothing is required from him but permission and access.I don't think there is a good solution, but the 7ft tall cinderblock fence will help.

She doesn't bark at any people on either side of the fence, even the dog in another neighbors yard who barks at her alllll the time. She only barks when he is climbing the fence with his head over it and his arms hanging down on my side.

I'm a nurse, work 12 hr shifts and am honestly exhausted when I get home. I told him that and he just asked gross questions about me being a nurse. When the male neighbor on the other side told him to piss off and never speak to them again, he left them alone.

{"title": "Reminder: For those living in 4 season climates winter is coming! Don't forget to prep your home!", "selftext": "So I live in a 4 season climate and as the weather gets cooler it is a great reminder of fall tasks that need, should, and would be nice to do prior to winter's arrival. Here are some things that I thought of that need to  be done if you live somewhere that gets cold winters:\n\n1. Remove (and drain) hoses from any outdoor faucets & store them\n2. Buy ice melt before you need it- if you have pets (& kids) make sure it is pet safe & stored properly\n3. Check your gutters for leaves & debris that could collect water and freeze it cracking the gutters\n4. Test that your furnace & thermostat work before you need to turn them on for those winter days- better to find out now, then when you'll freeze without it\n5. Insulate outdoor pipes, or ones in your garage.\n6. If you have a sprinkler system winterize that too.\n\nHere are some things you should do but are not must do's:\n\n1. Get insulating faucet covers for your outdoor faucets\n2. Check your windows and doors for drafts- caulk windows, and weatherstrip doors that need it\n3. Reverse any ceiling fans - DUST FIRST (Thanks other reddit user for pointing that out!)\n4. Check downspouts for potential ice puddles in the future and reroute any potential hazards (can be as simple as buying those gutter tubes, doesn't have to be a big project)\n5. Clean your chimney if you have one\n6. Prep your lawn care items for storage- Use up the gas for your lawn mower/leaf blower/etc. before putting it in storage\n\nHere are some would be nice/beneficial if you decide to do:\n\n1. Prep your landscaping, lay fall fertilizer, trim back shrubs and other plants (particularly bulbed plants)\n2. Place bubblewrap in unused windows for extra insulation (don't put it anywhere you want to see out the window)\n   1. You can also buy those plastic window kits but I find they don't work, or they leave residue on the windows. But some people swear by them!\n3. Test all outdoor lightbulbs and replace ones that aren't working\n4. insulate outlets if your house is old/drafty-yes outlets can cause drafts\n5. If you know you have poor insulation in your attic, now is a great time to tackle it!\n6. Put any lawn items (patio sets, fire pits, etc.) in storage/a shed to prevent weather damage\n7. Finish up those yard projects you haven't gotten around to because it's been too hot, or nice, or busy to complete them.

{"title": "Neighbors Insisting We Cut Down Our Trees", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nWe have lived in our current house for over 25 years. We have a lovely property with numerous beautiful, tall trees. A year ago, a new couple moved in next door. We have enjoyed a friendly neighborly camaraderie with them since they arrived. Last week, however, we had an incident in which a tree from our property fell during a wind storm and caused minor damage to the exterior of their home. We immediately reached out and were willing to work with them to pay for the damages, but they took care of it themselves without any fuss.\n\nYesterday, we received an email from our neighbors requesting that we now cut down any trees bordering our two properties that could potentially reach their house if they happen to fall. This request felt extreme, but we replied with understanding and offered to have an arborist come out to assess the health of any trees they have concerns over. We thought this was a kind gesture and would resolve their concerns.\n\nOur neighbors responded today with significant upset to our offer. They accused us of putting their safety at risk if we did not cut down many of the bordering trees. They also mentioned that they had already \u201cattempted to put things right\u201d in this situation by paying for the damages our tree caused to their house a couple weeks back, even though we had offered to cover the costs.\n\nWe were very taken aback by their reply, and are currently struggling with how to respond to this. Where do we go from here? We have no desire to remove perfectly healthy trees that we love and have had on our property for many, many years. We also do not want to cause any additional strife between us. We thought the offer to have the trees assessed for damage/rot would be enough to appease their concerns, but they seem adamant in their desire to have most of these trees removed (at our expense) and have no qualms about guilting us into doing so. Are we in the wrong or are they?\n\n**EDIT: Wow, this post generated way more comments than I was expecting. Thanks for the replies and advice - it sounds like there\u2018s a resounding cry to stick to our guns in this situation and we are indeed NOT being jerks for not \u201cconsidering their safety\u201d.

{"title": "Advise from an HVAC technician to homeowners", "selftext": "I feel bad for you guys. But my industry doesn\u2019t. Residential HVAC industry has been on a trend for the last 20 years to make record amounts of profit. The price increases that came with COVID have given even more momentum to massive profits. This is how I see it as a journeyman service technician who has been doing this work for over 25 years. \n\nA lot of the smaller shops that provided the type of service I was taught as an apprentice have disappeared. When I started in the late 90\u2019s a lot of the owners were baby boomers. These owners started to want to retire in the early 2000\u2019s and that\u2019s when private equity began to buy shops up because they were essentially recession proof. With all the influx of money more people jumped in purely to profit. Then the cycle of private equity turning smaller companies into giant regional companies began. They charged unreal amounts to the customers and mainly preyed off homeowners ignorance and lack of patience. It became more about getting into a service call purely for maximum profit without real intentions of looking out for the customers. This lead to record profits and a trend just about every owner in my industry regardless of size jumped on. It became a money grab. \n\nTechnicians became selling technicians. They are paid by commission and incentivized to sell new equipment. Companies started offering \u201cclub membership\u201d programs with auto renewing monthly payments just to be a regular customer. Now a furnace that\u2019s over 10 years old should be replaced in the eyes of service managers. Minimum ticket sales averages became a thing. You now had to charge an average of $700 - $1200 a call. Technicians became less informed and if the equipment was not replaced the solutions they offered for repairs were only band aids and fixed symptoms but often not the root cause of the problem. In short the system you have in your house now has become obsolete in the eyes of our industry regardless of age or condition. The system you buy next will only have a shelf life in the eyes of our industry for another decade. \n\nI truly mourn the death of the industry I knew. Now I\u2019m on my way out since I\u2019m basically a dinosaur in this industry with my ethics. My ask to anyone who can answer what is a good industry for a guy with mechanical skills and ethics?

{"title": "Parents are offering to live with my wife and I in exchange for a house. What would you do?", "selftext": "FINAL UPDATE!!\nMy wife and I spent much of yesterday talking and using all of your comments / opinions to provide additional perspective to our conversations. I then spent time talking with my parents about our concerns and they are open to the idea of duplex, in law suite, buy a piece of land and build a house with a design that works, or two houses on one piece of property. This would give us and them our own separate living spaces and something my wife and I would both be happy with :)! Thank you for all the people who had helpful suggestions, we were able to use those ideas for a constructive conversation with each other and my parents! \n\nI feel bad for all the people who left negative comments and projected their insecurities. I wish you the best! \n\n\n\nOriginal Post: \nHi Reddit, could use some advice and perspective here. My (30 M) wife (30 F) and I live together in a 2 bed / 2 bath, 1,100sqft condo with our 2 month old daughter that we bought in 2021 when mortgage rates were low. We love the city we are in but are frustrated sharing walls with folks, outgrowing the space limiting any future children, and recognize that the school system of our city is not good at all. It has been a goal of ours to move into a single family home to have a place of our own, a yard for our daughter to play in, and a great school system to be a part of. Financially this is not possible and will not be for a very long time, if ever. \n\nMy parents (mid 60s) have generously offered to buy a place in one of the top school districts in Massachusetts (Newton, Wayland, Weston, Belmont, etc..) if we would live with them in the house, and the house would be ours when they moved out or moved on. My parents love spending time with our daughter and want her and any future grandchildren to go to the best schools possible. The house would be big enough that we would not be on top of each other (6,000+ sqft and minimum 6 bedrooms) and agreed that we would all need to agree on the house before moving forward. \n\nI see this as huge win. A house we could never afford in a city we could never afford! I have always gotten along well with my parents and lived with them for 6 years after college, saving up for the condo. My wife enjoys spending time with my parents as well and we usually do 2-3 family vacations together a year. So being together in the same space with one another is not new to us. \n\nI am leaning towards yes but my wife is much more apprehensive. I completely understand where she is coming from and know that living with your parents / in-laws is no one\u2019s ideal scenario. There are downfalls and concerns that 100% acknowledge (lack of privacy, etc..). However, I think the benefits and ability to have a house we would literally never be able to afford otherwise, in a top school district, is too great of a benefit to pass up. We still have a LOT to discuss as a team but my gut tells me we would live to regret not taking them up on this offer. \n\nI am curious to know peoples thoughts and perspective on this. Has anyone been through this or something similar? Any cautionary tales? \n\nTLDR: Parents want my wife and I to move in with them in exchange for a house. I think the benefits outweigh the cons.\n\n\nUPDATE: really appreciate everyone\u2019s comments and thoughts on the matter. I\u2019m slowly making my way through the comments. If I\u2019ve been able to glean anything from the variety of responses it\u2019s that there is no right answer, I need to ask my parents a lot of questions (many of which you all have provided), and that this is a decision where both my wife and I need to be in lock step. \n\nI\u2019ll be seeing my parents this weekend and will have an in depth conversation with them on many of the questions brought up. I\u2019ll provide any updates to a lot of the key questions that I can after talking to them. \n\nAdding some additional background: \n- my parents have told us to take our time in deciding and to not rush what\u2019s clearly a HUGE decision. \n- The house would be paid for in full in cash, and would be setup through attorneys to mitigate any type of large tax when transferred to us (I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s possible but I\u2019m sure they will hire the right people to figure it out). \n- my wife and I are in the early stages of thinking through this. I told her we should look at a house and maybe that will help us with our feelings? We can ask ourselves if this is something that feels right or wrong when touring a place. I figure at the very least it will be 45 mins of our time and give us an additional perceptive. \n- 100% agree that good schools are not the end all be all, and it comes down to parenting.\n- Two houses next to each other, townhomes, or other living arrangements are not on the table for my parents. They would only consider a place that has a first floor bedroom. They are getting older and don\u2019t want to do stairs.

Attached is an album full of the things we found. \n\nBecause of the encouragement of fellow redditors, I did more research and found the obituary for the father of the original family that lived here at the local historical society. This gave me the names of his living relatives. I reached out to his grandson and have since been able to talk with most of the family. On Saturday I met the 89 year old daughter who spent her entire childhood in our home. I gave her a tour and she told me all kinds of stories about the house. I learned that the house was built in the 1910's (about 20 years earlier than we'd originally thought), that the additions were done using lumber milled from the property in the 1930s, that before the addition they cooked in the basement and the kids slept in the attic (this explained the old bed frames still left in the attic), that our pond in the backyard was hand dug by her father, etc, etc etc. Most importantly, I was able to return all of the letters, photos, and items back to the family.\n\n&#x200B;\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/a3ffn7/bought_a_house_from_the_early_1900s_that_came/", "created_utc": 1544036911.0, "score": 663, "author": "MancubJG", "num_comments": 72, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/a3ffn7/bought_a_house_from_the_early_1900s_that_came/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Anyone else feeling crushed by constant rising cost?", "selftext": "I bought a house 2 years ago and it was the absolute dream. I felt like I had the extra income to do virtually anything I wanted. Bought tools, could replace any appliance that was outdated or broken. Could enjoy myself and go out with friends anytime I felt like it. Over the past year however, cost in every aspect of life is rising rapidly. I used to pay 1000 $ in housing payments, and now it's up to 1700 $. Now add the rising electricity, utility, food costs etc. I'm easily over 2100 $ just for existing. The costs for basic living has far exceeded 50 % my paycheck of 3400 $ after taxes. Having shit break down on you feels like another step towards despair. My car is near the end of its life and I've had to pay for emergency repairs more than a couple of times now. I want to replace my water heater before it goes, and if my 25 year old heat pump dies I think I'm actually just fucked. I've cut down my spending on everything. Quit energy drinks, takeout to a bare minimum, only a couple of streaming services that I share the cost with five other people and I even feel somewhat bad visiting my girlfriend that lives 3 hours away due to the expense of visiting her. Are any of your home owner dreams turned into a nightmare too?\n\nEdit: As people are pointing out my \"ridiculous\" spending before the price hikes, I thought I might clear up what my spending was like. When I took out the loan it was only 1K and every cost associated with the house was low. I even bought it 20K under market price at the tlme. The first year I paid an ekstra 200-300 $ a month on the house because I was happy with my spending and I felt comfortable. I spent money and effort to raise the value of the house to eventually negotiate a better loan. So there weren't any vanity projects going on, however, as everything got more expensive, I had to stop putting money into the house. There weren't any reckless spending. What makes me depressed is that even though I accept I can no longer afford upgrading the house nor buy myself anything nice, I feel somewhat fucked by the economic system in how I nearly have to pay double for the same maintenance costs as two years ago. It's no longer a debate whether or not I'm going to a restaurant after going to the cinema, but rather can I afford to keep up my relationship with girlfriend studying in the big city and when I go should I bring my own coffee beans?\n\nEDIT 2: Lots of people think I'm stupid for not fixing my rate, but I asked around and nobody has a fixed rate here in Norway. Everyone has an adjustable rate, which sucks. I've talked to some banks today and I'm going to get a better rate at another bank bringing, which is going to save me around 2700 $ a year.\n\n\nEDIT 3: Apparently there's a big difference in fixed rates between the US and Norway. In the US more than 90 % of loans are fixed, while only 5 % of loans in Norway are fixed. Why that is, I have no idea. I don't I was even offered a fixed rate when I took out the mortgage.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/16z17pb/anyone_else_feeling_crushed_by_constant_rising/", "created_utc": 1696361785.0, "score": 663, "author": "TheRealBalder", "num_comments": 411, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/16z17pb/anyone_else_feeling_crushed_by_constant_rising/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "The county's taking my house", "selftext": "We bought our house a few months ago. No problems were disclosed, the title was clean, inspections went great, everything seemed fine. We moved in, got comfy, no nasty surprises... until now.\n\nToday, a surveyor knocked on my door to let me know he'd be taking measurements for the retention pond the county wants to replace my house with, as part of a road widening project that was approved in Jan 2020.\n\nThey mailed notices a year ago, but the elderly previous owner was in hospice for several years before dying and passing the house to his kids, who we bought it from. I'd really like to believe this information just got lost in all of their paperwork and stress...\n\nEither way, this sale clearly should not have happened at all. There's a snowball's chance in hell that we'll get a full recovery from the county's offer, which they haven't made yet. I'm hoping this falls under title insurance somehow.\n\nI'm talking to an eminent domain lawyer next week, but I'll be stewing over this all weekend til then... anyone been through this or similar, or have other insights they can share? Good or bad, I'd really appreciate knowing anything that helps me understand what the next couple of years will look like. \n\nI'm just hoping we can end up in a similar house to our current one, reasonably close to breaking even financially. We're already tight in savings after dumping much of it into (what we thought were) some critical maintenance projects - including a new roof. What a waste.\n\nUPDATE Oct 18:\n\nWe talked to the lawyer, it'll be a year or two before things really kick up but he's confident that we'll be able to achieve our main goal of ending up in a similar financial position and quality of home to where we are now. Also my state is apparently pretty decent about eminent domain cases: I won't have to pay any of the legal or professional fees involved in processing my case or in relocating. I may even be able to get permission to continue living in the house after the county has bought it, without mortgage payments or rent, up until they actually need to start tearing it down - could be a year or so without that monthly expense, and plenty of time to find a new place after we know what the final numbers are. \n\nGetting compensation for the difference between my current interest rate and whatever higher one I'll have to take (assuming rates don't drop by then) is less likely, but not impossible - the lawyer has some ideas we'll explore. He also says the outlook for a law suit against anyone I think ought to have warned me about the road project is pretty poor, he's seen people try and it's a long battle most of them ended up losing because it's really quite a gray area. But hopefully things should go well enough that it wouldn't be necessary anyway.\n\nWe've recovered from the initial shock and are cautiously optimistic at this point. Still kinda sucks as there are comfort issues with the house that we had originally planned to fix (replace windows, build privacy fence, upgrade flooring, etc) but now will have to live with for a few years. On the bright side, my home improvement project backlog is basically empty now, and we don't have to worry about putting in any work to improve its marketability as the sale is basically guaranteed. We're just stuck waiting for the process to percolate, watching house prices continue to rise, hoping things don't take a turn for the worse in the meantime.

{"title": "My dog was killed on camera by my neighbors dog!!", "selftext": "My toy chihuahua was killed yesterday by my neighbors black lab. I bought this home a little over 2 years ago and I've had issues with my neighbors labs getting into my back yard several times. He usually replaces the wooden board on the fence and apologizes for his dogs getting into my yard. The dogs break the bottom part of the fence and squeeze their way through the tiny hole. The last incident happened in January of this year. I have a toddler and 7 year old daughter and I'm always nervous about letting them play in our backyard. The dogs (5 adult labs and 2 puppies) bark at my gate and hit the fence a lot. I tell my girls to stay away from that fence but I hate that we live in fear inside our backyard. \n\nI found my chihuahua laying lifeless in the middle of my yard yesterday. She would've been 17 years old in 2 weeks so I figured she passed away from old age until I looked at my camera footage. It looks like the black lab bit or broke my dogs neck, maybe suffocation?! She didn't stand up after that. Watching that video footage has caused so much sadness and trauma. The video keeps playing over and over in my head. She had no chance up against a dog that size. \n\nYes, my cameras alerted me about movement in my yard but I assumed it was just my dog walking around so I didn't think anything of it. After the January event, I saw additional alterations on my neighbors fence.. it was a metal wire/fence of some sort so I felt more confident with letting my dog roam outdoors. I assumed he placed this barrier along our fence line, because at this point.. you have to escalate the situation. Your dogs are menace.\n\nAnimal control came out to my home yesterday to do a thorough investigation. Once they arrived, the dog was inside my backyard and animal control got footage of it all. My neighbor surrendered his dog to animal control and it was euthanized this morning. \n\nI want justice for my dog. She didn't deserve to pass away this way. This could've been prevented. He has 6 more dogs I have to worry about. I spoke with my neighbor serval times about this issue but he didn't take me serious. I'm a single mom with 2 daughters. He knows my girls play outside. He's tried to give my girls a lab puppy a couple times this year. He knew I had a small dog and I only like smaller breeds.\n\nMy neighbor took 3 days to block off the fence in January so his dogs were in/out my yards for 3 days and he was aware. We live in a HOA subdivision so we don't have a large backyard. I would find the dogs in my yard.. and they would bark and go crazy until him or his wife would call them back to their yard. This went on for 3 days until he finally fixed the fence. I'm sad and exhausted. What can I do? I live in Houston Tx. I have video footage of every time these dogs have come into my backyard. \n\n*** Update! *** \n\nThank you for the outpouring amount of information and insight. I will contact our HOA on Monday regarding this situation. I wish I would\u2019ve contacted them sooner but I honestly thought my neighbor would/did make the proper amendments to his side of the fence with the metal wire/fencing that he put up in January. He even mentioned getting an electric fence so I was happy he was being proactive. I will look into building a fence or barrier for my family\u2019s safety. I will also protect my daughters at all cost if another dog crosses into my yard with all of the options that you guys gave me. \n\n1. The dog is a black lab. My neighbor breeds labradors. I don\u2019t think he does it for a living BUT he does have a website he advertises and sells them on. He just sold a litter of 9 black labs and he\u2019s keeping 2 from this litter.\n\n2. We share a joint fence. It\u2019s staggered so he knows which part of the fence belongs to me vs. him. His dogs break my wooden boards as well as his. \n\n3. We live in a new subdivision and our houses were built about 3 years ago. The wooden fence is fairly new. \n\n4. I do not think the HOA is aware that he owns 6 dogs now.. let alone, breeds them. I know first hand because he chats with me every blue moon and I hear/see the dogs through the fence. We\u2019re only allowed to have 3 adults dogs in our neighborhood. \n\n5. I have not spoken directly to my neighbor nor have I seen him. He was away from home whenever this incident occurred and his adult son spoke to animal control and surrendered the dog. His son most likely got instructions from his dad to release the dog. \n\n6. His yellow lab was also inside my yard that day but it did not harm my dog. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k32n1k/my_dog_was_killed_on_camera_by_my_neighbors_dog/", "created_utc": 1745086594.0, "score": 639, "author": "Flat-Preference6349", "num_comments": 291, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1k32n1k/my_dog_was_killed_on_camera_by_my_neighbors_dog/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

If I ask her in writing to confirm she didn't pay for the fence, can I just remove it and not put anything back so I can continue on with the real repairs I need to be focusing on?\n\nOther info: the fence has been there over 20 years and she's an original property owner.\n\nOkay so some extra info, we're in MD and from my research it seems we both share responsibility of the fence because it's connected to more fencing on both sides so in MD that makes it a shared fence.\n\nSo since I don't care what happens with the fence, I'm just going to offer to pay half the removal cost and let her do the leg work from there.

{"title": "Neighbor waters & dries road multiple times a day", "selftext": "We are confused about what our neighbor does and how it helps his property, we just don\u2019t know why he\u2019s doing it.\n\nFor the past year or so our neighbor, we\u2019ll just call him hoseman, waters down the street in front of his house, scrubs the line in the middle, and then uses a leaf blower to dry out the road. We thought okay maybe he just wants it to be clean or maybe the pavement is hot. But he does it more than once a day and even at nighttime he\u2019s using the leaf blower to dry off the road again. He also does this every day.\n\nThe neighbor right in front of him moved in recently, we\u2019ll call him blow boy, it was vacant before, and was an airbnb at some point. Hoseman would water the street and use the leaf blower to move debris to blow boy\u2019s house. Until blow boy started taking care of his lawn and they would come out together at the same time with their leaf blowers to blow debris now to the main road working together.\n\nHoseman waters the road, scrubs the road, and dries it off. Blow boy only blows the leaves off his grass. This goes on multiple times a day, even into the late evening around 10pm-2am. We live in Florida so it\u2019s not like it never rains or that the sun can\u2019t dry the pavement on its own.\n\nIs there a beneficial reason for watering a road and then drying it off throughout the day or using a leaf blower into the wee hours of the night? We just laugh about it at this point because we have no idea what is happening.\n\nThis is my first time using Reddit so my mistake for not knowing how to use this, but thought this might be the correct place to ask.\n\n\nUPDATE #1:\n\nI did get to ask him today and found a reason to have him talk to me besides straight up asking. When I saw he was using the leaf blower I went outside and took a lap around the neighborhood waving hello to him. On the way back waved hello again and asked if I could borrow some of the water from his hose to wipe off my face because I was overheating. Made small talk and he said he\u2019s watering down his lawn because it\u2019s so hot and trying to keep it clean to show his neighbors how to keep their home clean too. I asked why he watered the road too and he said he cut the lawn so he didn\u2019t want the grass blowing back in. Didn\u2019t ask about the leaf blower since he didn\u2019t have it out. He owns a pressure washing company and uses the photo of his home on his website to show how your home can be as clean too.\n\nThanks for all the feedback from everyone. Want to answer some questions and also provide what\u2019s happened since.\n\nWe didn\u2019t initially ask him why he was watering the road and blowing it off because I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a normal thing to do at your house. I felt like if I asked it would be equivalent to asking why do you mow the lawn and water the grass. The one time we did try to ask he walked away into his backyard so I wasn\u2019t chasing after him.\n\nAnd his name is not Fred from California.

Not just some building you inhabit. Take the time to really enjoy it with your family and friends, go make a fire pit or paint your room or whatever makes it feel home for you.

I took his concern to heart and had an arborist come look at the tree and they gave it a good bill of health and gave Many reasons to show that the tree was healthy, strong and growing. I then communicated all this to my neighbor and gave him permission to have his own tree guy come look at it if he wasn't satisfied with my answer.

I was doing some gardening and noticed that we had 1 basement window that was surrounded by plywood and not brick like every other one. I drill a little hole and noticed after the first second there was a significant opening between what was on the outside of my house to what was in my basement, which lead to drilling an even bigger hole. My friends, there was a 4 inch gap from the front of the house to what met my basement wall and was 13 inches by 10 inches on each side of the window, I fucking found it. I go ahead and seal it up with vapor barrier, foam board, and a bunch of great stuff.

Inside was the letter in the link.\n\nMy partner and I moved into this place two years ago and have had normal interactions with this neighbor. We have said hi, exchanged pleasantries if we bump into each other getting the mail or bringing trash barrels out, normal stuff. Never an unpleasant word, never been inside each others' homes.\n\nThe neighbor is old (letter says 77) and she lives with her disabled husband. Her house is about 6' away from ours, separated from ours by a gated paved alley-like area that we own. At first I was not sure if the letter was really written by her, but my partner read it and said that she had in fact bumped the neighbor's exterior wall a couple times on one occasion while sweeping the alley area. She used a pushbroom like the one the neighbor strangely included in her letter. The neighbor did come out and ask her what was going on.\n\nWe did not do any of the things she is accusing us of.\n\nI forwarded the first page to our HOA association guy mentioned in the letter to ask if he any knowledge. No response yet.\n\nI'm thinking dementia, and not sure how to proceed. If I see the neighbor, and I will not go out of my way to do so, I plan to ask her if she wrote the letter and if there's anything she'd like to discuss. What do you think? I don't think she's a threat but this letter is pretty disturbing.\n\n=====================  \nEDIT: Thanks for all the good responses. I\u2019m going to try to contact the daughter before escalating further.\n\nThe HOA guy mentioned in the letter got back to me.

{"title": "New house neighbors using my property", "selftext": "I am about to move into a house that has been vacant for about a year.  The house I am buying is tiny and a long skinny parcel that is about 1.5 aces.  The neighbor's parcel is even skinnier and they seem to have been parking and putting their stuff on the back end of my new property. They have a lot of cars- some of them seem like junk,  It has mostly been cleared away during the selling prep but whenever I drive by the house I see that they have pick ups parked on my property.  The property was surveyed and it's clear that they have been spilling over into my new property with their driveway and parking and stuff.  They got in a little fight with the surveyer who warned me about them.  In the last two days they have come and put Trump flags on what will be my new fence (built about 6 feet into my property.). It seems like an agressive move after their fight with the surveyor. I need some advice.  They are my new neighbors and I don't want to go in blazing but my plan is to resolve the property boundary issues- first by putting up a fence along the boundary lines where there is no driveway and then working on the driveway issue with them- whether we resolve it with a shared easement or I just finish the fence.  I don't want to start by putting a fence down the middle of the driveway. My house has a seperate driveway on the opposite side of the property.  I knocked a bunch of money off of the price knowing I'd have to wok towards a solution with them.  I'm really happy with the purchase- now I just need a strategy for making the property line more normal so when I go to sell it or get a loan based on the house equity it won't be weird anymore.  I close on Friday.  What is my first step?  Introductions then Pie? then Ask them to move their cars and move their politcal flags off my fence? I'm not looking for friendship here just mveing towards a more regular nieghbor relationship.  Any ideas?\n\n\n\nUpdate #1:\n\nSo I want you to now that the wide range of advice that I have received has been really helpful.  So thank you! The different perspectives have given me a lot to consider and some different paths depending on how things go.  Here is how it is going so far.   I closed last Friday and have been moving stuff in with a uhaul for the past 5 day in between work.  I've been wanting to meet the neighbors in person but hadn't managed it yet. I've been ignoring the stuff moving thisngs and playing with my dog in the yard when I get a chance and trying to just meet.  I decided to grey rock trump and just really address all stuff being on the right side of the property lines.  I've been carrying a copy of the survey in my pocket so I could give it to them once we met.  I'm sure they haven't seen it yet.  But no luck.  In fact one of the residents has gone inside a couple times when I've gone out.  I think she was avoiding me.  She is the one who got in the fight with the surveyor.  I decided today that if I didn't manage to connect face to face that I would take down all their flag and move their trash cans to the other side and leave a note with the survey saying hello I'm looking forward to meeting, that I know we have some things to discuss about the property line and the driveway and I know they probably haven't see the survey yet.  So please take a look at it and then we can talk.  I'm hope we can figure it out together.  Please keep your belongings on your side of the property.  I wanted the note to be short and to the point but friendly and hopeful.  I wrote a lot of drafts for such a short note and decided to give it until tonight to deliver it.  Then an hour ago our dogs met and I got to meet the husband.  I'm glad I spent the time I did on the note because I hit all my points calmly.  We talked about dogs and it was a pretty respectful conversation.  He took the survey and promised to look at it and I told him I wanted all the flags and lawn art and cars they had on my side moved off.  He said okay.  I don't know that he was agreeing to move it or whether he was saying he understood what I wanted, but it was an okay start.  The woman was watching from the window and she shouted at him once to come inside. So we'll see.  He told me about animals in the neighborhood and some dog stories.

{"title": "Watch out for Miele appliances", "selftext": "When our last (American-brand) dishwasher self-immolated in 2019 we went to our local appliance store and ultimately decided on a Miele model replacement. It's considered a \"premium\" brand and indeed it was pretty nice in terms of features. We have kids and try to cook frequently and avoid disposables, so we produce a good amount of dirty dishes. We've used the Miele pretty much daily since we bought it. Up until the past couple weeks I would have honestly given it high marks and considered buying from the brand again.\n\nWell, a week ago the unit seems to have died suddenly. Filled the cabinet, went to turn it on, and it's just dead. No power, no lights, nada. Circuit breaker is fine. Definitely annoying, but hey, stuff happens to appliances now and then, right?\n\nI called Miele customer service and they opened a support ticket with their regional repair company that they work with. I was told they'd call within the next couple days to set up the appointment. A few days go by and... nothing. So I call the repair company directly. The first person tells me their office doesn't serve my area, call some other number. I call the other number, the person who answers says they have no record of my work order. OK fine.\n\nCall Miele support a second time, and the person I speak to this time says the work order was cancelled for some reason. Let's open another one. So we do. This time I try to get ahead of things by calling the repair company again. I'm told they don't have a work order for me, but even if they did they don't support my area. I call Miele yet again, and my work order was once again mysteriously closed with *no notice*. \n\nIt's pretty clear at this point that the repair outfit Miele contracts with just doesn't want to come to my zip code, but it's infuriating that the way this is handled is by stealth closing the work orders without any notice at all. For what it's worth, we're in a 'burb of a major metro area. I guess you could call it a blue collar area, so it's not the part where all the rich people with high end appliances live, but it's still a major metro area. Not exactly a dirt farm in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAnyway, it's becoming pretty clear the Miele direct support thing isn't working out, and I just want the damn dish washer to work again, so I go and Google local appliance repair outfits.  There's a well reviewed one not too far away and they list Miele on their website, so I put in a request with them. Not long after I get a call from a guy at this company saying he's very sorry, but they can't work on Miele stuff any more. Miele cut their parts distributor off from getting replacement parts. They (Miele) want everyone to go to Miele support directly. \n\n*Fucking hell.*\n\nAnd this pretty much brings us up to today. At this point the issue is still unresolved, but it's starting to look like a new non-Miele dishwasher is my only hope. The current one is only \\~4 years old, but apparently Miele makes their products unserviceable, and are unable or unwilling to provide their own service unless you live in very, very specific zip codes.

{"title": "I have worked in title insurance and lending for 30 years, I have a few things I would like to tell you.", "selftext": "Edit: Thank you for all your nice comments! You all are lovely. My kid (whom I am unsuccessfully hiding from) told me it was bad Reddit manners not to say thank you for the awards, so thank you!.\n\nHello homeowners! I am a title insurance agent, and have worked in this industry for thirty years. I currently work in the title department for a very large lender. I have a few things I would like to tell you that may save you (and me) heartache in the future.\n\nFirst, SAVE YOUR PAPERWORK! I know in this day of computers that is not easy. The most common issue we have to solve for homeowners and borrowers is that your mortgage, while paid off was not satisfied on the public record in the local county courthouse. My first recourse is to go to the homeowner and ask them to produce the letter they received stating it was paid. Most folks do not have this because they did not keep it. Keep it!!!!! If I have to hunt down a satisfaction of mortgage from 10 years ago, your refinance will take a long time, or the sale of your home can be delayed. The issue of having a mortgage that is open in the public record is not something I can ignore as a title agent. If you took out a loan that has been sold a few times, the research and investigation to get the right paperwork on record can take weeks, even months. If you have this letter stating it was paid off can reduce the heartache significantly for both of us.\n\nSecond, did you get divorced? Do you hold your property in a trust? Both your lender and title company need to see those documents! While I understand you may not want to let me see those personal details, we honestly do not care! We read thousands of these documents all day every day, and when I am looking through your docs, I can assure you that it is nothing I have not seen over and over again.\n\nFinally, especially in this day and age. Be nice! Look, I know that you may get asked for the same thing over and over. I know that you have been waiting a long time to get your refinance done. I can assure you, I have been working twelve hours days for a very long time to get it done. If you are going to be mean to me, your file will end up sitting on my desk because I cannot take being yelled at any more. Kindness goes a very long way when you need my help or I need yours. This goes both ways, I know you have been waiting, and I know you are frustrated, and I am going to do whatever I can to help.\n\nThe rates are low, low, low. If you have been thinking about refinancing now may be the time. If you can make sure you have all your paperwork, and you are ready to hand it over when asked, that is half the battle.\n\nI have now taken too much time giving this public service announcement, and I am getting back to the grind. Have a great day homeowners!!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/kx5wgt/i_have_worked_in_title_insurance_and_lending_for/", "created_utc": 1610631939.0, "score": 574, "author": "None", "num_comments": 85, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/kx5wgt/i_have_worked_in_title_insurance_and_lending_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Do I need to clear out of my yard so that a dog owner can walk past?", "selftext": "If anyone has any good thoughts about dealing with dog owners, I would love to hear your opinion on my recent experience with a dog owner who seemed to expect me to clear out of my yard so she could walk past with her dog.\n\nHere is what happened:\n\nI took my dog into my front yard on a leash the other morning, and while I was out there waiting for him to take care of business so to speak, I noticed someone way down at the end of the street with a big dog who kept standing there looking back at me.\n\nI did not know why this person kept standing down there staring back, but I went about taking care of my own dog and then I brought out a little weed spray to take care of a few weeds in my driveway while my dog was leashed and close with me. (Don't worry, I use vinegar.)\n\nAfter a little time passed, the above mentioned person was still standing way down at the end of the street with their dog... staring down at me. They seemed to be standing down there a very long time, but I had no idea why, so I kept going about doing what I was doing.\n\nMy dog decided to share one of his little doggie presents with the world right by the curb on my lawn, and so I took him inside to get a little bag. When I came back out, and got down to the curb to pick up his little \"gift,\" I noticed that the person in question had walked a substantial distance towards my house in the intervening time and was now standing frozen across the street and just down a little ways from me. She had stopped, and appeared to be holding her dog back.\n\nShe called over to me and said that she could not pass me and my dog with her dog, because her dog does not like little dogs and pulls too much and it becomes very difficult for her to control her dog.\n\nI understood that she seemed to want me to move, so I politely said for her to just give me a moment while I picked up his poop. The words were barely out of my mouth when she repeated the same thing a second time, saying that she could not pass me and my dog because her dog does not like little dogs and was too difficult to control.\n\nI repeated for her to just let me pick up the poop, which I did quickly, and then headed up the driveway into my garage. I wanted to go back out in the yard to do a few other things, so I sat my dog on the front seat of my car with the door open and waited there as she walked in front of my house.\n\nAs she was going by, I just tried to be friendly and asked her dogs name. She said that she could not hear me, so I repeated my question, at which she said she still could not hear me. I asked her if it was ok if I came a little closer (keep in mind my dog was in the front seat, so I would assume it was clear I was not offering to approach with him), at which time she replied that she would rather I do not. So, I wished her a good day and she went in her house. (She lives right by me, and I did not realize who she was until she went into her house.)\n\nNow, I do not mind doing a favor for someone, but the situation felt a little questionable. I have never had anyone seemingly expect me to clear out of my lawn so that they could pass my house with their dog, so I asked a family member who promptly told me that this woman was entirely out of line to seemingly expect me to clear out of my front yard so that she could pass with her dog. I was strongly advised to not do that the next time she mentions it, or it could set a precedent where she expects me to share in the responsibility of controlling her dog in the future by always having to move out of her way.\n\nI am curious what others might think about this, in case it should happen again in the future. **I am happy to be helpful for a neighbor, and can empathize with how hard big dogs can be to control, and of course safety always comes first regardless of who might be right or wrong.**\n\n**My question is if my family member is right, and that the neighbor was wrong to seemingly expect me to move so that she and her dog could pass?**\n\nAny thoughts?

{"title": "Our energy audit ended up landing us a free water heater, super excited rn!", "selftext": "My husband and I bought our first house back in April, and knew that since it was built in the 70s it could probably be more energy efficient, but figured we'd put off those types of issues until we'd gotten some other projects squared away. Now that it's colder out we noticed the house is pretty drafty, and way too humid. Our electric company has a home energy audit program, so we had them over on the 16th to check things out. Well wouldn't you know it, they told us our water heater was leaking! We had no idea, we aren't down there often and hadn't noticed a leak before, but sure enough there was a small puddle behind it and the tiles near it squish when you step on them. Great...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe previous owner left the manual for the water heater, and when I checked it to try and figure out how old the thing was I saw a 9-year manufacturer warranty on the back. The warranty said if it leaked they would replace it for free. But there's no way this thing is still under warranty, right? So I check out the unit and find out it's a 2011(!), but there's no installation date, and the warranty is for 9 years from install. My husband called customer support, but the guy thought we were talking about a home warranty or something and just kept repeating that we didn't have one, it wasn't covered, etc. Suuuuuuper helpful. I used the company's chat feature the next day (the 17th) to try and figure out if they had any record of when the water heater was installed, and the woman there was really helpful. She found out the water heater was installed on **October 18th, 2011.** It had one day left on the warranty! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe had an appointment with a repairman yesterday, and he agreed that the water heater should be replaced. He called someone and was like \"is this really still under warranty??\" and they told him it was. So now we'll be getting a new water heater! The repairman also said water heaters are normally installed with a drip pan, and something to cut down on the water pressure between the well pump and the heater (we had neither) so we'll be getting those too! We're so excited to have it replaced for just the cost of labor, and feel so lucky that the home energy auditors pointed it out to us when they did. We definitely wouldn't have noticed the water heater until it was out of warranty, then we'd have to pay for it ourselves. Now I'm (impatiently) waiting for the company to call us back and give us the date of the repair. Until then, we'll just have to keep walking down there to mop up and change out the rags we left to collect any dripping water.

I wonder when those feelings will start to go away.\n\nThe actual structure could use a lot of work (built around 1950) and it's pretty small (1300 square feet), but it feels huge.  We also have a private backyard that feels enormous even though the land is only a third of an acre.\n\nI don't know *why* everything feels so spacious, but it does.  Maybe it's really just the freedom of knowing that we can change whatever we want however we want (finances permitting).\n\nAnd speaking of finances, we've never felt so safe.  It's weird that we can look at our $392,551 mortgage balance - a huge sum - with indifference.  It's a 30-year fixed at 2.625%, the total monthly payment (PITI) is 31% of our take-home pay, and the property itself is worth over $500,000.  We have no other debt, a solid emergency fund and don't have to bother with escrow (I trust myself to pay the taxes and insurance more than some other company).  We just don't have that house poor feeling which was one of our biggest concerns.\n\nThe location is exceptional.

{"title": "Pro-life tip if you need work done on your house.", "selftext": "Always, always, always get multiple inspections and bids from different contractors, you never know if someone's trying to bamboozle you! \n\nWe're currently in the process of selling our existing home, and the buyer had the roof inspected. They brought in someone from a reputable company, and his report came back showing extensive hail and wind damage as well as significant age related problems, and his recommendation was immediate replacement of the entire roof. He felt that repair wouldn't last long and it wouldn't be worth the time or money. As a result the buyers wanted us to replace the roof or knock $10,000 off the price of the house.\n\nWe filed an insurance claim due to the hail and wind damage. The insurance adjuster disagreed with the roofer's evaluation, and two other roofers we brought in for estimates disagreed with it as well, and felt that the roof is in excellent condition for its age, and just needs a couple of minor repairs. They all felt the wind damage was minimal and there was no hail damage that effected the integrity of the roof and that it still has several years left before it needs to be replaced.\n\nWe happen to be friends with the owners of the roofing company that the buyers used, so we contacted them to find out what was going on. When they went to look up our file, they could not locate our names or address in their system, which it should have been since their company was used. They sent out another employee to inspect our roof, and his evaluation was the same as all the others we received from the people we brought in. \n\nTurns out the 1st inspector was best friends with the buyers. Against company policy, he did the inspection has a side gig, \"as a favor for his friends.\" \n\nThe buyers had already haggled us on our asking price, and we had dropped the price significantly. But they weren't satisfied, and wanted to swindle us out of $10,000 more. They opted to do it that way, instead of trying to negotiate with us.\n\nOur friends who own the roofing company guard their reputation jealously, and told us that the employee \"faced the worst possible consequences.\" We're assuming he got fired.\n\nInitially we assumed that the buyers' inspection report was legitimate because we know the owners and the excellent reputation of the company they used. It never occurred to us that their employee was colluding with the buyers and we could be victims of a scam.\n\nTDLR - Even if you know you're dealing with a reputable company, always get a second opinion/bids on any work that may need to be done on your house. You never know if someone is trying to rip you off.\n\n\nEdited for additional thoughts: \n\nI've calmed down some and have a more even head to contemplate the whole thing. \n\nThe short answer to legal recourse, for those interested, is they can argue it was done in good faith. The roofer that wrote the report can argue that in HIS professional judgement the roof needed replacing immediately. Just because he disagrees with the other inspections doesn't *legally* discount his evaluation. We would also have to prove there was collusion, just the connection with them being friends is purely cicumstantial. \n\nIt's enough that he faced the consequences from his employer for violating the terms of his employment which expressly forbade side jobs, for just this reason. The fact he did the inspection under the auspices of doing business on their behalf, by showing up in his company truck and sending the report from his company email didn't help his cause. Furthering the case for the consequences he faced, when we reviewed his emailed report, aside from his company email address, he scrubbed all contact info for the company and listed his private number to call if we had any questions. Take what you will from that tidbit, but still not enough to prove he had malicious intent.\n\nThe buyers backed out, and we're back on the market.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/j9dkg2/prolife_tip_if_you_need_work_done_on_your_house/", "created_utc": 1602450483.0, "score": 564, "author": "Finklemaier", "num_comments": 52, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/j9dkg2/prolife_tip_if_you_need_work_done_on_your_house/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Is my neighbor running a property encroachment SCAM?", "selftext": "Today is Wednesday. Yesterday I came home to our neighbors hammering stakes into our backyard. I was utterly confused on why they were in our yard hammering stakes. I rush in the house to alert my husband of the confusing site and he walks out there to chat with them.\n\nHe claimed to my husband that he had a surveyor out earlier that morning and he told them to put them there. Now this makes no sense to me because when I cleared the corner of the garage to see what all the banging was, the husband was hammering a wooden marker with pink ribbon, and his wife was nearby holding two more. This was almost 10am and no surveyor in sight. That was the first weird statement that didn't add up. \n\nThe second was physical proof that their surveyor buddy created a whole new landmarker 10 feet from the original with brand new rebar and claimed that the original land marker was damaged so his buddy put a new one there.\n\nSo, as we are inside looking for the deed paperwork so we can verify our suspicions that they are trying to scam us out of land and force us to move or possess our established structures that we've been paying property taxes on for over 20 years, as they were claiming, we look out our window and see he had successfully chopped down two and a half of our trees on the encroached protion of land. He did this without warning...less than 2 hours after his buddy was supposedly there surveying. \n\nSo we go out back where he's in the middle of cutting the 3rd tree on our property, and start up a conversation about us getting our own survey to verify before he cuts anything else down. He proceeds to tell us that he has a group of men coming to build a fence on Saturday ON TOP OF his new imaginary property line, which will require that they cut down two very large shade trees that fall on the encroached portion of property. The maths not mathing and the lines not straight. When that was said, we threw our hands up and walked back into the house to do some more research. \n\nWithin 10 minutes of that, their interpretters come flying into the neighborhood and arrive to their home. \n\nAnd within 10 minutes of their interpretors arriving, we're being approached by 2 county sherriff deputies. \n\nThey told us to get a survery, which we already were on several waiting lists by this point in the day and told us we couldn't stop him from building the fence or moving things off \"his\" new stretch of property. They totally dismissed me when I pointed out the tampering of the county landmark. Police shrugged their shoulders and said that if they do as they say they will do on Saturday and our survey contradicts theirs after the fence is built and they do all the damage to our trees and buildings, we can go to court blah blah blah we own a fence and dismissed us. \n\nThe neighbors are still holding up that a fence is being built Saturday. \n\nThe maths not mathing and the lines not straight. I beleive were being scammed and refuse to move my structures until I can get a court notice and am given ample time to have my own surveyor verify the county landmarkers. \n\nWe're anxiously waiting to see if their going to do as they told us they would do last night and that is move or take ownership of our property and buildings come Saturday, or if they will build the fence in a non-contested edge and allow us ample time for a survey. \n\nDon't they have to give us a better warning that 3 business days to get us our own surveyor before building? \n\nAnd if not, I would love for someone to recommend any licensed surveyor in the state of North Carolina that can come out for an ESTIMATE in 3 business days or less! Seriously, because everywhere we called said they wouldn't be able to schedule a site visit for at LEAST 3-6 weeks. Oh, and one that will come out for less than my biweekly paycheck? \n\nThe whole thing is crazy and I fully believe that their trying to scam us out of land and buildings. I'm thankful for an assertive husband for asking what the stakes were for because otherwise, we would have came home from Saturday morning sports with quite the surprise. \n\nAny advise on how we can protect our buildings and shade trees before a surveryor can get out here would be really appreciated.

I have no doubt that was her goal but she has only resided there for 7 years and never paid a dime in taxes on that portion. \n\n\nBought a house a few weeks ago. Got a really bad vibe from the neighbor lady who basically forced us to sit down and chat with her just so she could  complain in the most polite southern way about how how our tree guy was cutting the dead trees down and trimming the overgrown ones. When fencing was brought up we said we were building a privacy fence around our property, would she mind if we just stopped at her fence instead of building all the way down the line. She then proceeds to tell us that \"oh absolutely not, I own 4 feet beyond my fence and I need to be able to get to those bushes\". Mind you, nobody has maintained these bushes she speaks of. They are a mess. Anyway, we leave and I tell my husband that we are getting a survey immediately cause I don't trust her. We get the survey and find out that not only is she 21 feet encroached on our property with her fence, but she also had concrete slab and a large shed like thing built that is very much on our property by 21 feet!!!! Not 6\" or even 10\". 21 feet! Very small town, which she is not from (nor are we) the surveyor who did our property also did hers a couple of years ago when she bought and she clearly knew what the property lines were. The house we bought was never lived in by the owner so I don't think he even knew his property lines. He never had a survey. She is also encroaching 4 feet to her hind neighbor, which is a business office, but not my business. We already know we have to contact a lawyer, she either has to pay for the portion of land she thought she was going to steal or tear a portion of her 2 story shed thing down, tear out her cement patio and take down her fence. Who in their right mind would do these things and how long is this going to take. Will I get in trouble if I just take the fence down that is on my property and pull up my beach chair to her crappy patio that is on my land. Start parking in her driveway, that has also been created on my land.

Yesterday when they poured the concrete they destroyed a bunch of my landscaping. I'm selling my house and the first showing is today at 4pm. I literally just dolled-up my landscaping last weekend so it looked real nice.\n\nThis morning I show up to start doing some final touch-up stuff and they're getting ready to remove the concrete forms. I tell the guy to stay off my property because of the damage they caused yesterday. The guy says they'll put it all back right, and HE offers to sign a contract saying they won't do further damage to my property (his idea). I hastily wrote a note saying they'd return everything to original condition before 4pm and offered it to him to sign. That's when he starts taking off his safety vest and jacket like he wants to fight me.\n\nI walked away, talked to my neighbor, and filed a police report. Is there any other recourse I should follow?\n\nEdit: Since this thread blew up, I'll add some clarification and resolution. First of all, I'm in the construction trades so, all you keyboard warriors saying \"that's just part of construction\"  can gtfo this thread - these guys ripped a 70-80lb corner stone out of a 4ft rock retaining wall that was 10ft away from any of the work being performed. I honestly have no idea how they moved it without a piece of machinery. There was also concreted muck boot footprints in my lawn 30ft away and droplets of concrete splattered across my shed more than 30ft away. The concrete truck also washed out his chute on the back slope of my property and left a 2ft mound of solid concrete.\n\nFor those of you accusing me of antagonizing the guy (who also appeared to be the foreman), I came out and told him he needed to make sure his crew did a good job of cleaning up after themselves today. He immediately got in my face and told me he'd sign a contract if I wrote one. So I did. And when I presented it to him he started ripping his safety vest and jacket off and telling me to follow him down the alley because he knew how to deal with guys like me. I initially followed because I thought he wanted to talk away from his crew but then he put his fists up and started saying, \"come on, let's go!\"\n\nHere's how it resolved: I didn't see the \"foreman\" for the rest of the day, but I talked to my neighbor, the owner of the company, and one of the workers. The worker ran the job for the rest of the day and made sure they cleaned everything up and repaired the rock wall best they could - they couldn't get the original stone back into place, but they managed to wedge 2 smaller rocks into place. My neighbor and I also spent the afternoon masking any other signs of damage so it looked decent for the afternoon showing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/px8m7n/neighbors_concrete_contractor_just_threatened_to/", "created_utc": 1632842284.0, "score": 544, "author": "sassmo", "num_comments": 158, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/px8m7n/neighbors_concrete_contractor_just_threatened_to/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The parents will even put chairs right beside my driveway on my lawn to watch the kids. They\u2019ve left trash, the smaller kids rip up my grass, and just the fact that they\u2019re in my yard when they can sit in their yard a few feet away is so frustrating. \n\nThe main thing is one of my neighbors is the biggest culprit and not even his kids. He will walk through my yard all the time and have no reason to, have friends over and somehow end up in my yard chatting(??), etc. It\u2019s funny because he was also very insistent that I not cross his property when he first moved in last year. He even got a surveyor and had posts (which are still up) marked in the front yard so we know who\u2019s property is who\u2019s.

We bought our house in a small town in NJ last year, and the first thing we needed to do was take down a couple of massive trees on the edge of our property line bordering our neighbors front and back yards. In our town, we have to submit a formal request to take down any tree in the city with a 7 day notice period to your neighborhood with a little note they print out and give you to put in your window. We had an arborist come out and he told us that the front yard Oak was going to fall in the coming 2 years, and it would basically destroy our house sitting only about 25 feet down front entrance to our house. The backyard tree had to go since it was growing directly into our basement and pushing up the tiles in our downstairs bathroom. We  told both our neighbors that we were planning on taking down the trees about 3-4 weeks before we did so. They didn't say anything other than express that that was a bit sad for them but that they understood.\n\nFast forward to the day that we're cutting the trees down. Our right hand side neighbor texts my wife freaking out that she's in hell and that the tree cutting service was infringing on her lawn space, and that they were dropping things in her back yard. My wife was apologetic and went as far as to get her and her husband a nice bottle of wine. As she walks up to my neighbors house she comes out and starts screaming at her (I didn't witness it unfortunately), and yelling that she was so disappointed in us and that she can't believe that we did this. Then it's radio silence. Nothing. Not a word from them or any acknowledgement that we even exist. Our other neighbor could care less, because it wasn't on his side and said nothing about it in general. \n\nI'm just not sure how to make things whole with them, it was such an insane display of emotional imbalance that both my wife and I unanimously decided we couldn't really come back from this so we just don't talk now.

{"title": "A message from a contractor", "selftext": "I do Industrial and commercial HVAC service now but when I started, I was doing residential work.  I just wanted to give you all some advice for when guys like me or other contractors show up.\n\nDont lie:  Don't tell me you change your air filter when it has a date on it from 1986. Don't tell me you didn't try and fix it on your own and that you didn't touch it when It's really obvious to me that you had your hands in there. Be honest. I really don't mind if you tried to fix something on your own but tell me if you did.\n\nClean the work area:  Remove your cat's litter Box from in front of your furnace(better yet, dont put it there in the first place). Give me plenty of room to work.  I don't like touching your stuff and if I have to move a mountain of boxes and old clothes that just increases the price because I'm irritated and it takes time. Billable time. \n\nDon't bug me:  If you wanna watch while at work that's fine. Don't stand over my shoulder to the point I can feel you breathing.  It takes things twice as long if I have to ask you to move every time I go to reach for a tool.  I'm more than OK if you want to ask me questions.  Long term it means I'm probly gonna be at your house less. That's OK. I have plenty of other work. I'm gonna be honest with you and you might even the sort your problems out on your own without having to call me next time.\n\nI know your upset: Let's be honest. If I'm at your house it's probably not a great time for you. The running joke in my trade is \"hope I don't see you soon\" as I walk out the door.  I can deal with your frustrations, just know that I'm a person too and if you're gonna be a Dick to me than I can make your bill a lot bigger. If you are really nice to me sometimes I go out of my way to do you a favor if I can. Sometimes I fix stuff in 5 minutes. That doesn't mean it's free. Read the next point.\n\n Basic maintenance goes a long way:  Change your air filter. Keep your condenser(the outside part of your AC) free of grass clippings and don't let your dogs pee on it.  Don't completely block the air flow from it with plants create I know it's ugly but you're only hurting yourself. Keep the vent pipes for your furnace free and clear of snow ice and other debris.  Back when I did residential calls come up this was 50% of the issues. It's really expensive for me to come out and fix stuff in 5 minutes and it just makes you upset.  Also make sure their power is on to the equipment. The amount times I show up and it's just because somebody accidentally turned power off was way too many. It's embarrassing for you and the waste of my time. \n\n I know contractors are expensive: Don't try and look up the part on eBay or Amazon and complain about the price of it because we have to put a mark up on it. The hourly rate that your paying isn't just my wages.  That's the years of training, expertise, tools in the truck, insurance and fuel for the truck, and our office costs.  Trust me I get it. The reason I don't do residential anymore is because I hated giving people that bill. It's expensive and you can't exactly go without heat so you don't really have a choice. I've had people break down and cry when I hand them a bill. It's not my choice.\n\nStuff doesn't last forever: Average lifespan and on a residential furnace and air conditioner is 15 to 20 years.  There's a point of diminishing  Returns when it comes to repair over replace. I'll be honest with you about that period I'm not just trying to sell you a new furnace. You're 1967 furnace is costing 3 times as much to heat your house is a new 1. When it is time to replace the age back, you don't have to go top of the line.  Parts are expensive and even pricier on the high end stuff. You will never have a positive ROI  Even with the highest efficiency equipment out there. Mid range. That's what I would put in my house. When it comes to looking at different options for appointment, keep in mind the majority of equipment is made in the same factory, or has parts that are all made in the same factory. Do some research. Figure out what supply houses are nearest to you and what those supply houses distribute for brands. Don't buy Carrier furnace if there's not a Carrier distributor within 50 miles of you.  That could be the difference of I can get you heat right now versus I can get you heat in 2 days once the parts come in. Also, if I don't have the part of my truck you're paying for me to go to that supply house and come back. The less I have to drive the cheaper it is.\n\nI'm sure there's other things that I should be telling you guys but I can't think of them right now. If you have any questions about your HVAC system just ask. I'll answer them if I can and when I have time.\n\nEdit: I thought of a few more points.\n\nOh look a puppy:  I love my dogs. I don't mind my friends cats. I don't have kids but my nieces and nephews are my little homies.  You're children are terrible. I hate your dog. I wanna murder your cat. I don't know your animals and don't trust them. I really have nothing against your pets but keep them locked up. I've been bit by a few dogs and cats climbing all over me drive me nuts. Also pick up your dog shit. Sometimes I'm carrying too much stuff into your backyard to keep an eye out for yard bombs and I step on a terd. I don't wanna drag it in your house, in my Van, my house, my next customers home.  Keep your kids away from me. I have sharp tools and kids enjoy trying to kill themselves on a regular basis. I was working with live electricity at 1 point in a kid tried to stick his hand it where I was working. I don't wanna kill your kid. Keep him occupied while I'm at your house.\n\n Keep your dick beaters off my tools:  My tool is organized.  If something's not where it's supposed to be I assume its loss. Sometimes things go wrong and I need a very particular to a very quick. I don't dig through your closet, dont dig through my toolbag.\n\nReading is fundamental:  All those books and manuals that came with your furnace, air conditioner, thermostat, and any other equipment in your home are important.  They include data that I sometimes need to help troubleshoot breakdowns. If you can keep it at or within arms reach of the furnace. If that's not feasible keep them in a file and give me that file when I show up.\n\nBack to the regular maintenance rant: change the batteries in your thermostat once a year. Do it when you do your smoke alarms and CO detectors.  If your thermostat is powered from your furnace but still has batteries, change them.  They will corrode and damage the thermostat. It's typically just a couple AAs or AAAs. Maybe a 9 volt. A whole lot cheaper than a service call. \n\nBack to not bugging me:  I have a process but I troubleshoot equipment. If I'm sitting staring at your furnace or air conditioner not doing anything, I'm probably thinking. And if you see me on my phone,  There's a good chance I'm looking of a manual for using a pressure temperature chart  so I can properly charge your air conditioner with refrigerant.\n\nGas and go:   You're refrigerant doesn't go bad(usually).   It doesn't have to be topped off every few years.  If it's low, you have a leak.  Get the leak fixed. Refrigerant is expensive. \n\n How to find a good technician:  Talk to your friends and neighbors. Word-of-mouth is huge in our trade.  If a company is super gimmicky and spends a shit load on advertising, that's probably because they can't keep customers.  If a company advertises no trip charge, they're going to rape you on everything they can. If you ever hear that a company pays their technicians commission, that technician is not looking out for your best interests. Good technicians are paid hourly. They're are there to fix problems, not sell you stuff.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/ctwvtk/a_message_from_a_contractor/", "created_utc": 1566477662.0, "score": 536, "author": "Farmchuck", "num_comments": 263, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/ctwvtk/a_message_from_a_contractor/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

So I read on how to prep, what supplies to get, what finishes do best where, etc. Then came the hard part. The painting part. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started with a roller brush. But the wall has a little texture to it so I had to push on the roller so hard it wasn't worth it. Then I switched to a paint brush. That hurt my hands trying to dig into the wall to get between the texture. Then I used the paint sprayer. That's great for large coverage, however, the air flow from the machine kept moving the drop cloth all over the place even though I taped it down.  The small pieces that I didn't tape were opening up exposing the floor.  Paint was splattering over the edge even where I taped, it's going beyond the tape. Forget the sprayer. It's too messy. Then I used the pro-edging tool. That went on pretty smooth so I stuck with that. I think I was getting too much paint on the edging tool because it kept bleeding off the edge and dripping. The higher up places I had to keep climbing up a ladder, paint, then climb down to re-dip my edger with more paint.

{"title": "The $30000 duct damper", "selftext": "PSA: If you have bad airflow, check your ducts before spending money.\n\nClickbait title: HVAC technicians hate this one $30000-saving trick\n\nStory/vent time:\n\nFor a couple of decades (according to the previous owners of our house) the rooms furthest form the furnace (which were an expansion to the original house) had very little air pressure from the pushed air ducts. In our 1 year here, indeed the pressure was low, and the room near the furnace got a ton of pressure, making the whole house very uncomfortable. They supplemented heat with a fireplace, and AC with ceiling fans.\n\nWe've had \\~10 HVAC/inspectors/contractors come through the house, that all acknowledge the very poor flow and all blamed it on the length/organization of the ducts, and maybe the age of the blower (25 years). All disagreed on how to solve it, but all agreed this is the problem, **unequivocally**. All seemed reasonable. Solutions were in the range of $15000 (replace blower/furnace/AC but no guarantee it'll help airflow -- in fact it likely wouldn't) to $60000 (new blower/furnace/AC + complete redo of ducts), **with a few in the 20-40k range**. About half were adamant another system (minisplit) was needed for the further rooms, and that the ducts would never work (too far from furnace). Again, it all made sense.\n\nAlthough we were thinking to sign with one of these (furnace is old, after all, let's just get it all fixed), it was a ton of money. I thought I'd first try to tinker with the ducts myself one last time (although both I and some professionals had looked at them already). Maybe get another 5-10% of pressure with tinkering, sealing, etc, I thought. After quite a lot of work (long story by itself here...) I also managed to get a picture of the inside of the ducts coming out of the furnace, hoping to see how much dust and debris there is and... **there's a** [closed damper](https://imgur.com/a/QznyU1b) **blocking the main trunk to the house**! The location is hidden and v hard to get to, and it's hard to detect it because \\*some\\* air does gets through. But, basically, this one damper has been turned off (from what I gather for maybe decades -- since the previous owners complained of airflow and the location is super hard/awkward to access/open).\n\nThe pressure is great now -- much higher in the further rooms, much lower in the near rooms. No supplement really needed. None of the professionals suggested this possibility (I don't really blame them, except I wish they'd have suggested it).\n\nThis doesn't solve all the problems -- the furnace and blower are is still old, and might die. But we definitely don't need the duct work redone, don't need an extra system for the far room, and no need for tens of thousands of dollars spent!\n\nLessons (I guess?): check your ducts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: apologies if you saw this on homeimprovement, apparently it didn't meat the guidelines there :(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/yy1mh9/the_30000_duct_damper/", "created_utc": 1668719220.0, "score": 516, "author": "buyingacarTA", "num_comments": 112, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/yy1mh9/the_30000_duct_damper/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "If you're gonna buy a house in the country, do some research. (Kind of long but could save you some headaches)", "selftext": "I grew up on a farm. I've since moved off of that farm but my parents still live there and farm the land. At least for now they do. That will be changing soon. Around 5 or 6 years ago my parents and the farm behind ours where approached by a company that wanted to put in around 500 acres of solar panels.  After a bit of deliberation, my parents agreed as it sounded like a pretty good opportunity for retirement. While my parents will still own the land and live on the farm, it is a long term lease to rent the land to the solar panel operating company.  At the end of the lease the land will be returned to  the original condition.\n\nThis has been pretty much public knowledge for 3 years now.  For the last year the solar company has been doing meet and greets at town board meetings and speaking with the neighbors, doing surveys and environmental impact studies on the land.  While a few of the neighbors aren't pleased with the situation, most of them understand what's going on and have no real issues. There's a few people around who are really dumb about the entire situation, like the guy who is afraid that the solar panels will ruin his view of the sunset but happens to live south west if the solor panels. \n\n My parents newest neighbor, is also very upset. While I agree that the view from their house is spectacular and the solar panels would likely ruin part of that view, they bought their house less than a year ago. As I said before this has been public knowledge for the last 3 years.  They're also very concerned about resale value of their home and are trying to demand some kind of compensation from either my parents or the solar company.\n\nThis is not the 1st time this issue has came up with my parents. We used to raise beef cattle and would spread manure on our fields along with some other nearby land. People would buy their dream home out in the country only to find that a few times a year, if the wind was right it stank like cow shit really bad.  \n\n\nSimply talking to your potential new neighbors about noise and smells or asking about any proposed new infrastructure in the area around your house at the local town hall could prevent you from having this issue.  Do some exploring around the area and see what you're surrounded by. I bought a house in the country about a year and a 1/2 ago.  Within a mile of my house, there is probably close to 4000 head of beef and dairy spread out between about 15 farms of various sizes. \n\n From speaking to my neighbors I learned that the dairy farms closest to me never really smell, most of the traffic on the road is farm equipment, and the roads don't get plowed worth a shit even though the Town Hall (where the plows get parked) is a 1/2 mile away from me, on my road.\n\n This is been a constant battle for people who I grew up with. Somebody who has lived in a larger city buys or builds a house near by because they want to live in the country and are immediately upset by the sounds and smells of farms and are enraged about the fact that they get stuck behind farm equipment on the road sometimes. \n\n I'm not saying this to discourage you from buying your dream home in the country, just don't be a dick about it to the families that have likely been around you for generations.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/fh0p8c/if_youre_gonna_buy_a_house_in_the_country_do_some/", "created_utc": 1583947142.0, "score": 512, "author": "Farmchuck", "num_comments": 142, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/fh0p8c/if_youre_gonna_buy_a_house_in_the_country_do_some/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Saved for several years, battled the current real estate gauntlet and was able to close on a home. We didn't immediately move in as we had been doing work on the house (painting, refinishing floors, etc.). Less than 2 weeks after close (and about 2 weeks before moving in), a huge oak tree fell onto our family room addition during a windstorm, causing significant damage.\n\nOK, sorry for the delay on updates, the past couple of days have been extremely busy, stressful, unexpected, crazy and it has wore me TF out, for real.\n\nTree was removed today and roof was tarped professionally to stop water ingress during the next round of storms over the next couple of days.\n\nTree company was absolutely top notch. Because of the way it was laying, and to prevent further damage, it took them 8 guys, 2 cranes, 1 bucket truck, and 10 hours to remove the felled portion as well as the portion that was still standing.\n\nArborist said the red oak had 97 rings (called it \"high and tight\" growth). Estimated to be 80' tall and weighed about 9.5 tons (19,000 lbs).\n\nHere are the pictures that I took that are in no particular order. ~~For some reason, Imgur wasn't letting me upload them, so I uploaded them to Flickr. I found it ironically funny that Flickr has decided to present the photos as though they are some sort of art piece. (Best way to view them is to click on the first one and then use the arrows to move forward)~~\n\n[~~https://flic.kr/s/aHsmVgK4H2~~](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmVgK4H2)\n\nIMGUR Link Instead: [https://imgur.com/gallery/S0wu8mi](https://imgur.com/gallery/S0wu8mi) \n\nFinally got them uploaded to Imgur. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome interesting, potentially scandalous, information came out when talking to the tree company owner. When you look at the Google Maps street view, you will notice it is an older image and there are about 7 huge red oak trees in the front yard that are no longer on the property. We were told that the seller had them *preemptively* cut down. Well, when I talked to the tree company owner (huge company in the area), he said he knew the address well because he removed every single on of those trees...he didn't cut them down, they all fell down over the course of 4 years in various storms. He *also* told me that he told the seller there were several other trees that we potentially hazardous to life and property and submitted estimates and plans on what to do with those trees. He (the seller) refused the service and the house went on the market about 2 months after this encounter. One of those trees, and the second most concerning to the arborist...the one that fell on my new house.\n\nI knew *nothing* about any of this. It was not disclosed. According to the arborist, the trees do not look like problems to the untrained eyes, and home inspections do not usually include trees unless there is something extremely obvious, which there wasn't. Additionally, no one gets an arborist to inspect the trees before buying a home, at least no one I have ever heard of.\n\nI talked to my agent and he immediately said \"Holy shit, they didn't disclose this to us\". He said this has never happened in his 30 years in real estate (specifically related to trees, that is) and suggested I speak with an attorney as to if there is anything that can be done here, because had it been disclosed, which it absolutely should have been IMO, it would have absolutely affected my buying decision and at the very least, my negotiating. I don't know where this will lead, or what I would even want at this point, but it is an interesting twist in the story. I somewhat assume the seller didn't think any of these trees would fall anytime soon, nor that when they did, I'd talk with the very guy who pointed out the dangerous trees to begin with.\n\nThe damage to the windowed wall where the tree fell doesn't come across well in the images. You can kinda see that the top of the wall it bowed in at the top. The miracle here is that none of the windows broke except for the inside window of one of the bedrooms where there are 2 panes that are cracked.\n\nI have to call in a structural engineer, per the GC and my adjuster as there could clearly be damage that can't readily be seen. So far, estimated damages are $30k - $75k. For reference, this is a LCOL area and I did get a great deal on the house for $250k \\*(\\*appraised for $268).\n\nI posted this in a response to a comment down below, but I felt like maybe I should add it to the post for some clarification.\n\nEdit: to clarify, the issue or question isn't whether or not the sellers are liable for the tree falling, because clearly they aren't It was a wind storm thus they aren't responsible for that. However, there is a reason that disclosures exist in the home buying process, and if they failed to disclose something potentially dangerous to life or property that they knew about and can be proven that they knew about that's the actual issue. So it wouldn't mean me going to them saying hey your responsible for this tree falling on my house and now you're responsible for taking care of that. Instead, it would be me saying hey why didn't you disclose this information that you knew about these trees because it absolutely would have affected my approach to this sale whether it be walking away completely or, and at the very least, it would have impacted my negotiating the deal. If this isn't an issue, what the heck is the point for disclosures in the home buying process to begin with?\n\nEDIT: Added Imgur link.

{"title": "Neighbor doesn\u2019t have an easement or right of way, but claims they have the right to use my driveway. ", "selftext": "Some context before I go into it, I have a driveway that leads to two properties. Mine, and my next door neighbors which is vacant and has been for the year that I\u2019ve been here. When we first moved in we noticed the neighbors on the opposite side of the neighboring property were using our driveway A LOT to go behind the property behind our house. So we started parking out in the driveway because nobody asked us for permission and nobody is offering to help with maintaining the driveway which it so desperately needed at the time. A few days of doing this, the neighbor in question comes and knocks on the door and asks what the deal was. I told him, we have no easement with any of the properties, even the one directly beside us because it\u2019s vacant. I told him that if he was willing to help with gravel and maintaining the driveway, and we set up a curfew then I\u2019d be more than happy to share the driveway because when I say they were tearing ass up and down the driveway all hours of the day I MEAN ALL HOURS. He agreed but fast forward a year, there was absolutely no effort on their part. We ended up getting the gravel and having it spread on our own dime. We have told them to stop. We have tried parking in the driveway, our next steps is to build a fence to the end of our property around the driveway. He claims he had an easement with the property beside us but it specifically states in my closing agreement that \u201cthere is a shared driveway with a vacant property, there will need to be a sharing agreement if the property becomes inhabited\u201d. Do y\u2019all think I\u2019m gonna get in trouble if I completely block the driveway off? I\u2019ve been nice for a year and I\u2019m tired of my driveway getting tore up by their big ass trucks and then being disrespectful. I\u2019m calling planning and zoning tomorrow to confirm everything I\u2019m saying is correct but for now, what are y\u2019all\u2019s opinions \n\nEDIT: for the record, I\u2019m in Tennessee. The only reason they go back there is because they\u2019re using the vacant properties back yard as a junk yard for old cars and car parts. \n\nAnother edit: I looked up the vacant properties assessment and turns out\u2026 wait for it\u2026 the owners been dead since 2014. So now I have to find out what THAT means and find out if there\u2019s an easement on that property from before she passed away. \n\nUPDATE: I called the planning commission and I\u2019m not within city limits so she couldn\u2019t tell me much BUT the lady was super helpful andsaid he\u2019s 100% trespassing and from the satellite view she could see the junkyard. She has advised me to take it to the sheriffs office. I\u2019ll add the next update as soon as I am able. I\u2019m probably going to hold off until my security cameras get here, im not going to stir the pot anymore until I have something recording constantly for not only my safety, but to show the sheriff when I do make the call. \n\n\nUpdate 2: I called the trustees office, the lady said the property taxes were paid last year but hasn\u2019t been paid for the current year. She told me the name of the owner was the deceased lady mentioned above but didn\u2019t have any details on who\u2019s paying it. That\u2019s my next mission, I found the daughter of the deceased lady on Facebook but I don\u2019t know how appropriate it would be to message her and tell her they\u2019re trashing her mothers property and to ask her if she knows who is paying the property taxes. \n\nUpdate 3: 3-17-22 they got a goddamn excavator over there digging a path from their property to the vacant property I guess?

She would occasionally rub me the wrong way by making comments about how our cabinets get dirty so fast or our stove has baked on food. However we've worked together pretty well over four years. I pay her $150 per clean, extra if she does extra. I pay her double for Christmas every year.\n\nThe last six months, every time she comes to clean she says she'll be at my house at 10am.

I've told her I don't prefer evening cleans because we host a lot. But it still happens. She's no-showed two times in the past 2 months.

I just want to say \"no worries girl come when you can\" but tbh I'm sick of having to chase after her, nail down the time she's coming, deal with waiting to make dinner until she's done, tidy up the house for her to clean but she doesn't show, etc. What would you do?\n\nedit: thanks all!

{"title": "Less than a year in this house and I\u2019m just about at my breaking point.", "selftext": "We bought our house in September 2020 and I just feel like the world\u2019s biggest idiot and fool. I\u2019m about to throw in the towel and sell before the bubble bursts. \n\nI preface this by saying all of these house troubles are compounded with the recent very brutal murder of my best friend (April 2021) on top of being promoted to her supervisor position in our office. I was talking with her right before it happened. I\u2019m pretty traumatized. If you have any advice or thoughts, please read it through that lens that I\u2019m pretty screwed up now. \n\nThe house we bought is in a lovely neighborhood. It was a flip\u2014a full gutting and redo, everything new from top to bottom. The only original thing is the brickwork. I feel like such an idiot. I only found this subreddit after the deal was signed & ink dried. I was just too damn trusting of our buyer\u2019s agent and extensive inspections performed by our inspectors. They loved the house and said it was great. I don\u2019t have anyone in my life like a parent who can be that helpful guiding voice or knows anything about home maintenance. I\u2019m completely on my own and all I\u2019ve got is Google and hindsight. \n\nThe buying process was an up and down. The inspectors flagged a lot of stuff, but everyone told me that was normal. I asked along the way \u201cis this more than normal?\u201d And no one seemed concerned. \n\nWe got a new roof (there was not damage\u2026 just 5 layers of roof). New sewer because it was clay and had a house trap. We knew going in that the HVAC system would need a full replacement because the mini split system they installed was done so poorly it wasn\u2019t worth ripping it out and redoing it properly. I got the price of the house lowered to account for that. \n\nWe got five different local HVAC contractors to look at it. All of their bids uniformly put it way over the cost of converting to a traditional furnace and AC system. So we did that. I went almost the whole winter with no heat as we waited for parts and everything to come in. Three weeks of install\u2014every single step. It was a blank slate. Ductwork, electrical, plumbing, getting a gas line in. The good news is it works great and all that\u2019s left is ugly wall art waiting to get ripped off the walls. We barely got it finished in time before that epic cold snap earlier in January. Only had frozen pipes once. \n\nHere\u2019s some of the OTHER stuff since September:\n\n1. The water line to the fridge was installed incorrectly. It had a very small drip that wrecked our wood floors. We only noticed because of the work the HVAC people did uncovered it. The whole thing will likely need to be replaced. \n2. All of the grout in between the tile in our downstairs area is falling apart. It looked perfect when we got it and then every other day there\u2019s a new crack or a new chunk of grout just put in the open waiting to be stepped on. \n3. Our kitchen sink just\u2026 all fell apart one day. \n4. I discovered two \u201cNarnia Holes\u201d inside cabinets in our house that lead inside of walls. Which would be\u2026 fine\u2026 but we have asshole cats. And I\u2019d prefer not to lose them in the walls. \n5. Our tile shower drain appears to have a clog. Except the covers are grouted down and you can\u2019t just pick them up and snake or investigate. I\u2019ve been doing research and some people say \u201cdon\u2019t do draino/thrift it will ruin your pipes!\u201d Others say it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m overwhelmed there never seems to be an answer. I\u2019ve got so much going on I don\u2019t want to screw up even more stuff by doing the wrong thing.\n\nThe CATALYST to this absolute utter breakdown is we have a laundry closet of sorts upstairs for stacking laundry units. I don\u2019t have stackable ones and there\u2019s a side by side hook up downstairs that I use. Earlier last week I noticed a stale, musty smell I can only describe as \u201cthe farts a lactose intolerant person would have after eating a gallon of queso.\u201d I was so proud to have a problem I thought I knew how to fix! P-traps are probably dry, put some water down the drain. Except after dumping a cup of water down the drain, I come downstairs to find all of that water cascading out of a light fixture on the ceiling. Turns out (I presume) pipes aren\u2019t fully connected in the ceiling? We knew the washer drain on the wall had that problem during our inspection but the seller fixed it and the inspectors cleared it. Who would have thought connecting pipes together would be so difficult?\n\nGood thing we got the warranty right?! Well not so fast. Initiate a claim, pay the $100 service fee. They send a plumber. He spends about 5 minutes looking around and determined he isn\u2019t going to open the ceiling because he doesn\u2019t do carpentry and isn\u2019t going to try and open the grout sealed drain pipe because he doesn\u2019t mess with tile, but if we aren\u2019t going to use that closet we might as well just plug it up with a stopper and forget about it. Call me crazy but I don\u2019t think I should have to tell a veteran plumber of at least 26 years that \u201cwell, there sure seemed to be a lot of water coming down, if we don\u2019t know if the pipes are fully connected or not, it\u2019s probably not good to have methane gas pumping in our walls. Something about being flammable.\u201d He\u2019s like \u201cHuh, yeah that makes total sense. well I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d No shit Buddy. At least the cheese fart smell is gone for now.  I told the damn warranty company water was coming from the ceiling. I guess that didn\u2019t get passed along. \n\nI\u2019m just so overwhelmed. I have done nothing with this house because it\u2019s chasing problem after problem. I don\u2019t even have blinds or curtains on any windows yet. I think a wax seal on a toilet is bad too because a spot is developing on the ceiling elsewhere. The ventilation in the attic appears to not be meshed so we get wasps coming down to say what\u2019s up. Our windows don\u2019t reliably lock. So many issues, I can\u2019t even list them all. \n\nI paid so much for inspections. I picked (what I believed to be) the best of the best with an impressive CV to review. I know inspectors can\u2019t pick up EVERYTHING until something\u2019s lived in. But damn. I asked around. I did loads of research. I thought I had a handle on things. \n\nIt\u2019s not even the money that weighs on me.  It will suck but I\u2019ve got savings squared away for things like this. It\u2019s the constant calling people, following up, leaving voicemails, getting no return call, getting contractors out who shrug and say \u201csorry can\u2019t help you not our problem\u201d and restarting over and over again. Its the triangulating between multiple parties all saying something different. It\u2019s the \u201cI\u2019m so mentally screwed up right now that I don\u2019t have the ability to not take my anger out on the wrong person\u201d thing. It\u2019s the constant researching and there\u2019s always a reason why not to do something. It\u2019s the loneliness of not just having someone like a dad to help navigate this stuff. \n\nI just want to sell and walk away before this bubble bursts. I feel so dumb for trusting the realtor and the inspectors. They all marveled at the house. Said they wished they had a reason to buy another. I was biased because my rental house was a flip and I lived there 2.5 years with no problems. Hell, I never even had to change a light bulb. They just\u2026 worked. I knew flippers try to be cheap but damn, connect your pipes! Who grouts a drain in? Does it take that much longer to not screw up installing tile? \n\nI\u2019ve scoured all of our documents but it doesn\u2019t even seem like there\u2019s grounds for legal action when it\u2019s phrased as \u201cwe\u2019ve fixed everything you asked for, you agree to buy it as is\u201d and \u201chey when we inspected we did the best we can, we\u2019re not liable if we missed something.\u201d I am a paralegal, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019d stand much of a chance. \n\nDon\u2019t buy a flip. It isn\u2019t worth it. \n\n(If you\u2019ve stuck with reading all the way to the end, please just be gentle.) \n\nTL;DR: Bought a flipped house. Didn\u2019t realize how bad they are until I joined this sub after buying the house. Milk farts smell bad. Light figures shouldn\u2019t rain.

There was a man in our yard who said that his real estate agent had fallen and that she was the one in the ambulance. He didn\u2019t really have much detail about what happened. My husband proceeded to take the prospective buyer on a tour of our home since he still wanted to see it. Shortly after, the ambulance pulled off with the woman inside.\n\nMy husband and I have never been in this situation before. In the back of our mind we wondered if she would try to come back and sue but we had no clue. We did not know this agent\u2019s name, how she fell, or where she fell. Fast forward a couple weeks later, we get a call from our relal estate agent telling us that the agent who fell wants our homeowners information just \u201cin case\u201d her medical insurance does not cover her bills, so she has not even received any bills yet. Apparently she fell outside in our driveway. We have talked to our homeowner\u2019s insurance and are waiting to get a call back from our adjuster for next steps.\n\nI just want to know is this something she can sue for or a legit claim? There is no negligence on our part. The driveway  is smooth pavement. No lumps, huge cracks, or pieces sticking out. The driveway is in great condition. If it wasn\u2019t I would be honest and say so. Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTLDR: A real estate agent fell and was injured in our driveway(that has no damage)while showing our home and now wants to pursue us.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/12awy4w/a_real_estate_agent_fell_in_our_driveway_during_a/", "created_utc": 1680554150.0, "score": 496, "author": "Ecstatic-Avocado5091", "num_comments": 181, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/12awy4w/a_real_estate_agent_fell_in_our_driveway_during_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Neighbor parking on lawn", "selftext": "So I had a new neighbor just move in who is an older guy. Things were fine at first but then he randomly filled his driveway with a pontoon and a jet ski, leaving him no space to park his car. He decided (without ever meeting me) that he could just help himself to my property and just start parking his car fully on my lawn, along with people who visit him. I\u2019m pissed because he didn\u2019t ask me, and I\u2019m worried about the grass turning to mud. It will also be annoying to mow around his car. \n\nThe biggest road block is that his car is next to the road so he could legally be parking in an easement, and I have no idea how to check if it\u2019s technically public property or not.\n\nI have rang his doorbell twice to try and be friendly with him but he hasn\u2019t answered the door. The last thing I want is a neighbor who doesn\u2019t like me right off the bat, so I\u2019m trying to see if I can catch him outside to talk.\n\nFrankly, my question is, how on earth can I talk to this old dude without making him mad or making him feel like I\u2019m mad at him? I don\u2019t want a vengeful retired neighbor who is calling in noise complaints for every (reasonable) party I have. I want him to stop using my yard like it\u2019s his.\n\nConclusion: I am going to confront him face to face with my boundaries, and if his actions don\u2019t change I will immediately bring the hammer down. Plain and simple. \n\n\nUPDATE: I finally got a hold of my neighbor because his window was cracked open when I rang the doorbell. His buddy dropped off his boat in the driveway and he was getting everything moved into his house for the last few weeks. He unfortunately ended up needing back surgery so he was in a bind and had to park his car there. The poor guy was on an air mattress because his furniture hasn\u2019t been shipped yet. He apologized profusely and told me he definitely didn\u2019t plan on it being permanent. I told him he could leave it there for now and he said when warmer weather hits he will buy me a case of beer and take my out on the boat.\n\nThis is EXACTLY why I talk to people first instead of immediately towing. Context is absolutely necessary. A lot of people in this thread would have had this guys car towed and ruined a perfectly fine neighbor for themselves.

Best practices are best practices for a reason, typically.  Since we never plan on leaving this house I want to make sure I do everything right the first time.  I'm taking a break, with shaking hands from the oscillating tool, from my latest repair job.  \n\nI'm currently into a repair of our shower.  It's an all tile shower, looks really nice, but is leaking.  We discovered the leak when we were painting a small area off our kitchen the other day.  My wife went to shower and it was then that I saw a small drip of water. I instantly knew this is because of grout cracking at the change of planes in the shower.  I had figured it would happen for a while, but was putting off the repair as I had other things ahead of it. (BTW, I knew that change of planes in tile need caulk because of this sub-reddit!).  The previous homeowner redid the shower themselves, but, as I'm coming to find out, didn't follow best practices.  There is no caulk at change of planes, only grout.  So now I'm on my knees, oscillating tool in hand, removing grout from them the intersection of the walls and the floor.  I'll then stuff foam backer in the gap and caulk it over.  No big deal, but it's destroyed my nice little Saturday.  \n\nNow, you might be saying \"well, they did it themselves, they likely weren't expert's either\".  But in my case, the previous homeowner was a general contractor.  When the house suffered smoke damage from a small fire in the garage, they took likely took the insurance payment, paid his own LLC and did the work himself.  They did a lot of upgrades throughout the home, but as I'm finding, not all of them were done well.  \n\nThe old homeowners didn't move far.  I know what house they bought and see his truck around town.  Sometimes my blood boils as I make silly repairs to stuff that was done haphazardly, and I want to go and bang on their door and drag him back over here and rub his nose in it.

All maintenance on any home I've rented has been handled by the landlord's handymen, and nothing was ever really explained to me since I wasn't paying for the job and was not the homeowner.\n\nIn my new home which I will be moving into next month there is an older furnace, and a ductless mini-split which I'd never even heard of before now, and aside from updating HVAC, how does one learn how to operate and basic maintenance on their home appliances and their home in general? Please, no judgement on my naivete or borderline idiocy, I am just wondering, do I look for manuals on each appliance and read it cover to cover? What about stuff that isn't an appliance based thing, like how to  winterize and things like that?\n\nI've heard you can call the local gas/electric company when you move in, but what do they do?

It should not count against them (I think she means me, OP) as it was an area storm occurrence and [Buyers] will pay the deductible if indeed the storm damage is covered.\u201d\n\nI am in the midst of buying a house in a different state and going through buying homeowners insurance.

After the previous nightmare neighbours left the rented apartment above mine because of COVID19, in May, a new neighbour took their place. They seemed less noisy and disrespectful than the previous ones, however, as I found out, they love to sleep with the music on, max volume, bass and all. I usually don't mind falling asleep with sounds from Spongebob and car races but recently, my neighbour seemed a bit undecided about the TV programs and I found myself waking up from the noise repeatedly.

{"title": "Do I need to give my cousin 30 days notice after buying the home from my grandfather?", "selftext": "For context, my grandfather sold me one of his houses. He is up there in years and is trying to get rid of his remaining properties before he eventually passes. It's  worth noting that it's written in his will that all unpwned properties will be sold once he passes, to prevent the remaining family from fighting over them. Everyone will just get a lump sum, but that's not the point of this post.\n\nThe house I bought from him is one that my cousin, S, is currently living in. There was no formal agreement for a lease or rent over all these years. To compensate her, and to not leave her in the street, he gave her another house of his. Slightly smaller, but not a bad house. She has known for 2 months that this sale was happening.\nI reached out to her with a gentle and respectful reminder that we sign the closing papers on Monday, and I really need her to finish packing and moving so we can get moved out of our apartment.\nShe proceeded to basically tell me to go fu*k myself, that I have to go through legal action to get her to leave, and that she will get the CAA involved.\n\nOnce we sign the papers tomorrow, the home is legally mine. Even the bank has proof that my grandfather is the owner, not her. I'm just looking for advice.\n\nDo I need to give a proper 30 days?\nDoes she have any standing to keep the home? We went through a loan from the bank, and I feel if there was going to be a problem, they would have denied the loan and the sale of the home.\n\nI live in Ohio, I know the laws vary by state, but I'm new to all of this and it's stressing me and my husband out.\n\nUPDATE\n\nThank you everyone for the advice. This has been an interesting situation, for sure.\nI have been talking with both my grandfather and my cousin, and hopefully over the next few days she will be moved out. I have offered her any assistance I can give to make moving easier.\n\nTo clarify a few things on my cousin.\nShe is...problematic to say the least. My grandfather didn't want to sell her the house, and instead offered it to me. He has his reasons for why, but the main one I have been told is because of how she treated my grandmother before she passed away.\nMy pap has offered to help us with the lawyer, and if that was the route it took, she would not be getting the other house. I think that fact has finally sunk in for her and she's started the process to move.\nAs a precaution, we already contacted our local courts for the eviction process, which would be 3 days, followed by a court hearing if she refuses to leave, and my cousin was also made aware of that situation.\nTalking with her hasn't been easy, as she's manic bipolar, among other things. But so far things are going...smoother?\nI will update again once things move forward more, but thank you again everyone for the advice <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1gz9q62/do_i_need_to_give_my_cousin_30_days_notice_after/", "created_utc": 1732505821.0, "score": 484, "author": "Actually_A_Moth", "num_comments": 194, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1gz9q62/do_i_need_to_give_my_cousin_30_days_notice_after/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Make sure you know where the official property lines are before purchasing", "selftext": "I'm sure this seems like common sense, but my new neighbor assumed they purchased more property than they actually did and they're now taking it out on me. The property line didn't have survey markers because the previous owners of that house kept removing them.  When I noticed the sold sign, I was curious about the price and looked at the listings online. The previous owners were basically advertising my backyard as theirs. The pictures were taken at angles where my house was conveniently hidden by trees. It looked like the home was on a large amount of property.\n\nOne day I came home to people in my backyard and I stood there and looked at them confused, not realizing the previous owners had moved out. My first encounter was when I was out doing yard work and they angrily questioned me about being on their property. They were in disbelief when I told them an estimate of the property line (I ended up being off by like a foot because markers were gone). I began to notice little underhanded things being done to my property by him (throwing things in my yard, etc). Recently, I came home to a bunch of my trees being trimmed and I told the people to stop, but they were basically finished. I could see the neighbor watching me out the window and since then he has watched me when I was in what he thought was his yard.\n\nCame home today to a survey being done. It took over 6 hours because the neighbor kept telling them to check it again. The line was where I said it was. I ran into the surveyor as he was leaving and he said he couldn't believe the neighbor bought an expensive home and didn't do a survey before buying, especially when there were no visible property markers. I know I'm in for some trouble with this neighbor as he's already been a pain in my ass since they've moved in. I did nothing wrong and yet he resents me for getting screwed on his home. If I had to guess, It's about 2,000 square feet of property they \"lost\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Clarifying a few things. I know the new neighbor at least had the original survey map from when the home was built. It's basically just measurements of the lot and where the house is located on it. No landmarks are on it. It would be hard to tell what was his just based on him looking at the map.\n\nMy great uncle owned the land the entire neighborhood was built on and separated it into plots before building the homes. There weren't any visible property line markers or a way for the new neighbor to tell what was his based on the map without measuring being done. The previous neighbors kept pulling out the wooden stakes that were next to the official metal survey stakes which had become buried. The surveyors had to use a metal detector to find the official markers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/bjqh8o/make_sure_you_know_where_the_official_property/", "created_utc": 1556768702.0, "score": 482, "author": "AvaMarie99", "num_comments": 176, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/bjqh8o/make_sure_you_know_where_the_official_property/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I am not going to blame the dog, it is the shitty owners who dont know to train the dog.

{"title": "I think someone might have tried casing our house.", "selftext": "I own a home in a densely-populated suburban neighborhood. A couple months ago, [I posted on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/16y38wm/how_do_you_tell_how_legit_a_local_repairman_is/) because I hired a handyman to come and fix a leak in our back porch's metal roof, and after giving us a quote he seemed kind of fishy. (This is sort of an update to that post, but might be completely unrelated. The update is: He did a poor job fixing the roof, and has had to come back three separate times to fix it further, though to his credit he's not asking for more money. Next time it rains I'll find out if it's actually fixed this time or not.)\n\nThe last time he came by was yesterday morning, and I left for work shortly after he left. My wife was still home, but our other car is in the shop so after I left the house, it looked like there was nobody home.\n\nYesterday afternoon my wife went outside to take out some garbage, and just as she did she noticed somebody (not the handyman, someone else) in an unmarked green truck pulling into our driveway. The man looked surprised to see her, but tried asking if she recognized him (she didn't). He asked how long we lived in our house (she told him we bought it about nine years ago) and he said that he put a new roof on our house ten years ago. He said he was there to inspect the foundation (?), but my wife was getting a weird vibe and she had people coming over soon so she declined. The guy verbally offered her a business card, but when she accepted it he said he didn't have any on him so he'd have to mail some to her. Then he left.\n\nI wasn't present for this exchange, but a few things stand out as bizarre:\n\n1. Our roof WAS replaced ten years ago, shortly before we bought the house, and somehow this guy knew that. \n2. This guy didn't mention the roofing company by name (and my wife didn't think to ask), but we have the paperwork from the company that replaced our roof, including the business card of the inspector, so I called them today. Not only did they not send anybody, *they don't deal with foundations at all*, nor do they drive unmarked trucks.\n3. He acted like my wife should recognize him. Obviously she didn't (assuming his claim was true, it was before we lived here), but *obviously he wouldn't have recognized her either*, so I can't think of why he would have acted like he did, except to feign familiarity.\n4. The fact that he showed up *on the very same day* the other handyman was working on our porch roof, seems very suspicious. After all of our dealings the handyman seems more incompetent than shady, but he did know I was leaving for work (when setting the time for his visit I said I needed to leave by 12:30) and it's *possible* I had previously told him the roof had been replaced before we bought it, but until today I don't think I knew exactly what year so that would've had to be a shot in the dark on his part.\n\nNothing concrete has actually been done (and we don't have any security cameras so we don't even have presentable evidence he was here), but this definitely has made us feel a bit uneasy.

{"title": "Schizophrenic previous owner camping out in front of my house", "selftext": "Interested in getting some opinions on a rather odd situation I've found myself in.\n\nBought a house roughly four years ago, everything normal with the sale. A few months ago I come home to find an unknown car parked in my driveway and some random guy hanging out in the back yard. I ask him who he is, and he gets confrontational, says he owns that house. (This is false - once I find out his name it's clear that he was the previous owner who sold it to me.) So I call the cops. While talking to this guy it becomes very clear he's paranoid schizophrenic - he claims that for the past three years he's been on the run since \"they're after him\" and he's very dodgy about certain aspects of his past. He claims he has no home and all of his friends won't help him. While talking to the cops he gets agitated and starts yelling at them. So, the cops decide to check him in to the local hospital and they tow his car. \n\nA few days later I come home and he's parked in front of my house. The cops are already there talking to the guy, but I didn't call them this time. They do give me a reference number for this incident that links to the previous incident, even though I didn't call them. They tell me to reference these previous incidents if anything else happens. \n\nSo over the past few months I would see his car parked a block down on my street, moving it periodically. It seems like he's living in his car, which although sad is probably better than his alternative. He would show up for a couple days, then disappear for a week or so. He never approached me or the house again (that I know of). \n\nSo fast forward to this weekend, he's back to parking right in front of my house, and he's been here for two days now. Which I'm aware is perfectly legal and doesn't bother me too much. It actually doesn't even bother me that much that he is sleeping in his car. I do catch him sometimes staring at the house, and although creepy that is also not illegal. \n\nMy question is, given his mental illness, should I take proactive steps to address the situation or just let it play out? I'm not too worried about violence. He was yelling but didn't seem aggressive, although he definitely has crazy eyes. He's a small guy and I'm decently sized so I could put a beat down on him if I needed to. I'm more worried that his condition will deteriorate and cause more problems, damage to the house, etc. He was very critical of some of the changes I made to the house so I could see him tearing out some plants, breaking some windows or something.  \n\nSo options are A) call the non emergency police line just to let them know he's back. I'm hesitant to do this because he hasn't done anything illegal and the cops are stressed out as it is. B) try to talk to him. I'm hesitant to do this because I've already talked to him and he's not in his right mind. He's not full blown meth crazy but definitely detached from reality. C) Do nothing. This honestly sucks a bit because its stressing me out to have this possibly volatile guy camped out in front of my house. \n\nI'm aware that homelessness and schizophrenia are real issues that we should deal with but I also have to protect my house and my family. He's not violent now but I have no idea if or when that will happen. This guy was offered help by the state and he refused it, which is pretty standard for paranoid schizophrenics. \n\nAny advice? Should I call the cops to document his continued presence? I really don't want to waste their time though. I know there are plenty of cases of harassment by previous owners, but not sure if there are mechanisms for dealing with it. \n\nSorry for the rant and thanks for reading. Appreciate any thoughts or advice!\n\nedit: I called the cops, they have interacted with this guy before (turns out he's \"known\") and that he refuses to take his meds. So I'm not sure trying to get him any help will accomplish anything, unless he can be compelled to take his medication or taken into custody. I'm going to be pursing a restraining order. \n\nIt also turns out that he has a concealed carry permit which takes things to the next level. I will be attempting to contact my DA to see if we can get that permit revoked because he's clearly crazy and shouldn't have a gun.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/hd9tbr/schizophrenic_previous_owner_camping_out_in_front/", "created_utc": 1592757121.0, "score": 478, "author": "MoreHybridMoments", "num_comments": 168, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/hd9tbr/schizophrenic_previous_owner_camping_out_in_front/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Sometimes he supervises it, most times he doesn't. \n\nNow I am not a person that is instantly against off leash dogs, if they are under voice control and will not attack or approach other people or dogs. Well, this dog has none of those qualities. It has charged me and my dog six times in the past year.

{"title": "UPDATE: The lawyers have clarified which workarounds Realtors are not allowed to use under the new rules for buying a house", "selftext": "There's been a lot of confusion on here about what Realtors are allowed to do following the settlement in the class action lawsuit. Agents have been posting workarounds right and left in Facebook groups.\n\nThankfully, some of the lawyers involved issued a statement a couple weeks ago to clear up how buyer's agents should behave. If you spot any of these things, you should probably treat it as a sign that your Realtor doesn't really care about the rules and is trying to score a bigger commission.\n\n1. **Your Realtor wants you to amend the buyer agreement or for you to sign a second buyer agreement to increase his commission.** If your agent wants to amend the buyer agreement to increase his commission after he learns what the sellers are offering, that's a huge red flag. Realtors aren't allowed to increase their pay just because they talked to the sellers and learned more is being offered. The new rules are designed to lock in the commission upfront so it can't be increased later.\n\n2. **Your Realtor wants to accept a bonus.** If your Realtor is trying to get a bonus or some kind of extra payment from the seller or builder, that's a red flag. All the compensation has to be clearly disclosed and agreed to in the buyer agreement. Realtors aren't allowed to go and collect more money from the sellers, even if it's a builder advertising a bonus.\n\n3. **Your Realtor tries to get you to sign a second buyer agreement with a commission after you had already agreed to free tours.**\nIf your Realtor wants you to sign a new buyer agreement with a commission after you've already looked at houses under a buyer agreement with free tours, that's a red flag. The rules are that your Realtor cannot get paid a commission on the houses you looked together under a free tour agreement. (Zillow free touring agreements will probably be going away very soon.)\n\n4. **Your Realtor wants to put \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" commissions in the buyer agreement.**\nIf your Realtor is trying to guarantee a \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" commission in the buyer agreement, that's a red flag. Compensation terms have to be exact and not open-ended. There should be an easy to understood percentage or amount, not a pay range.\n\n5. **Your Realtor tries to pay himself whatever commission the seller is offering, even if it's more than what was agreed to in your buyer agreement.**\nIf your Realtor is wording the buyer agreement to accept whatever the seller is offering, or taking a higher percentage than what's in your buyer agreement, that's a massive red flag. His pay is limited to the percentage or amount that was agreed to in the buyer agreement. Nothing extra is allowed.\n\n6. **Your Realtor wants to wait to sign a buyer agreement until after he's talked to the sellers.**\nIf your agent isn't going over the buyer agreement and having you sign it upfront, that's a big red flag. The buyer agreement that spells out what your Realtor gets paid must be signed before you see any houses together. Signing it afterward is not allowed.\n\nThis shouldn't be considered legal advice but hopefully it helps some homebuyers and future homeowners out there from being taken advantage of.\n\nPlease post other examples in the comments if you know of any.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1hhjh0w/update_the_lawyers_have_clarified_which/", "created_utc": 1734578101.0, "score": 471, "author": "Low_Town4480", "num_comments": 122, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1hhjh0w/update_the_lawyers_have_clarified_which/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "You probably don't need a chainsaw, or: how I almost lost a toe. A reminder about safety for DIYers", "selftext": "I want to start off by saying I'm incredibly lucky. Things could have been much worse for me. \n\nLast weekend we had a wind storm that in addition to blowing shingles off my roof broke several 6-8\" limbs off a tree in my front yard and took out my mailbox. My neighbor came over that day, and actually alerted me to it. He came over with a chainsaw and helped me get them so that they could be pulled off the road. \n\nToday I finally got around to taking care of them. I borrowed a friend's chainsaw, and started cutting the limbs into firewood sized pieces. After about half an hour of this I was cutting the bottom part of a log, the saw kicked into my foot, cutting through my boot and into the area just above my big toe. \n\nIt took me a moment to realize what happened because I saw it happen but didn't feel any immediate pain. I stopped the saw was looking at my boot thinking \"Wow, I'm so glad I decided to change into the boots instead of wearing my tennis shoes. Looks like it stopped it.\" And then, \"huh, that looks like the same color as my sock fibers.\"\n\nOutside I took off my boot to see that it was indeed my sock fibers and that I was bleeding. I walked inside, and announced to my wife that I had cut my foot with the chainsaw. She sat me down, grabbed me some paper towels and I applied pressure to the wound while she grabbed our first aid kit. \n\nWhen she returned with the first aid kit I removed the paper towels to see that they were not soaked with blood as I had feared. I've bled more from cuts in the kitchen. I had missed the tendon in my foot, and had only scratched the skin. She cleaned and dressed the wound and after calming down, I retired my friend's chainsaw and switched to my sawzall. \n\nMy takeaways from this:\n\n1. Chainsaws and power tools in general are not to be taken lightly. I am incredibly lucky that the injury I got was not any worse. \n2. When using any tool be sure to read the manual, and wear any appropriate safety equipment. I donned my steel toe boots and that is what saved me. After inspecting the boot it looks like the blade skipped off the very edge of the steel toe. Killing some of the downward momentum of the saw and saving my foot.\n3. Accidents are bred from complacency. After having run the saw for about thirty minutes, I became comfortable. This is when accidents are most likely to happen. When using powerful tools such as chainsaws, table saws, etc, it is incredibly important to respect the power that tool has, and to make sure that you are consciously considering each move you are making with that tool.\n\nI hope people will read this and remember it when they are about to use a powerful tool such as a chainsaw. If you have any reservations about using a tool, please listen to your gut, put down the tool, call a friend who has some experience, and have them teach you. And even if you are experienced using the tool, and you find yourself becoming comfortable, put it down walk away for a few minutes and come back.

Banks use worse than garbage property management companies to make sure they don't fall apart. Over the last 3 years of ownership I have found uttery stupid things done in this place. This one invloves pex tubing and shark bite push fittings.\n\nShark bite push fittings are a great thing, they're behind the wall rated and can save you a lot of headache when dealing with tight spaces. That said, much like everything else, if used incorrectly they can be fine for an interm, then bust. \n\nSo in the process of closing the deal, a copper pipe burst and the bank had it fixed, they cut out an 18\" piece just behind the tub and used pex tube and standard shark bite couplings. Maybe because it was a tight space, more probably because it's the easy fix. Problem is with that short of a piece using 2 couplings means you probably won't seat one correctly if the tube length isn't perfect. They should have used the longer slip joint on one end, but that costs all of 8 bucks more. \nSo, this thing pops loose awhile back, but I catch it quick, I seat it best as possible and I put in bracing in the middle of the tube and on the weak end to hold it over until we do the bathroom gutting.

Some people were definitely weird about it and were acting like I was being unreasonable, but it's all good. Some of ya'll seem to have fantastic jobs or families and can spend $500 at the drop of a dime, but I needed to do some more research about it first. \n\nThe general consensus seemed to be that $300-$500 is generally what an HVAC tech will charge, but mainly because they know people are desperate and willing to pay it. They're completely counting on people's ignorance/laziness and taking advantage of it. I don't mind the taking advantage of laziness, but if I didn't know enough to ask the right questions, I would have been screwed. It was like a car technician charging $500 to an old lady for a headlight bulb because she doesn't know any better. \n\n I ended up just going to ACE hardware and getting a universal ignitor. \n\nPut it in in about 26 seconds and the system fired right up.

{"title": "Advice on how to make peace with really angry neighbors?", "selftext": "Husband and I moved into our new home about 4 months ago. Its a large property where we are pretty far away from all but one of our neighbors which backs up to our back door. These neighbors are around our age, have jobs of similar professionalism to us and we were excited to have young neighbors! Except...\n\nWithin a few days of moving in my husband was doing work outside when they walked up our driveway and on to their own property. The wife - let's call her Karen - immediately asked my husband if we're planning to put a fence up between the two properties. Husband said yes, teenagers and others are cutting through our property and didn't like it for security and liability reasons. Karen was unhappy says because she and her husband  - Kevin - had been cutting through our property as a short cut from the park. They were pushing a stroller and tried to tell my husband that they did it \"for safety.\" Karen then felt the need to let my husband know that her mom is a lawyer and her mom said they have an easement  - and therefore a right - to cross over our property. \n\nA week later  I'm coming home and Karen flags me down. This is my first time meeting her and we engage in small talk when after about 2 minutes she launches into the fence issue again. She asks me if we plan to put up a fence and I say I don't feel comfortable with strangers crossing our property and think it is a liability. She pushed on that and asked if maybe we would put in a gate to which I said well  when we get to know each other better we can have that conversation. She continued to tell me how highschool kids and other neighborhood residents frequently cross our property when I again mention that's the issue we are trying to abate. She questioned again why it was an issue when I finally said \"in my line of work, you expect the worst to happen and you see the worst case happen so I want to make sure I protect myself and our property.\" Karen immediately asks me what I do and I tell her I'm an attorney. She then asks where I went to law school. Very weird question but ok. Turns out her mom is a professor at the law school I went to, and was also my advisor for that time, i knew she had a daughter but thought she lived across the country. So that's weird. I tell Karen to say hi to her mom for me, we chat some more, she tells me she and Kevin have a 2 month old kid and I let her know we have dogs that bark sometimes but that we try hard to keep things quiet and to let me know if it becomes a problem, we exchange numbers and I tell her to let us know if they need anything at all.  \n\nA month or so goes by with no interaction except that Karen and Kevin give us the stink eye every time we see them. Then while enjoying our backyard firepit, suddenly we have the fire department looking in our backyard. We get told that someone called about a \"large fire\" and they had to check it out. Someone called about a fire....fully enclosed in a fire pit.... \n\nThe next week we have another fire and the FD gets called again. Two days later we do another fire, FD gets called AGAIN. Firemen that show up are the same from the first two times and they are clearly annoyed as we are. I pulled an information request on 911 calls in my city and discovered all 3 times was Karen/Kevin. Husband and I felt this was an odd choice considering I gave her my number. The next day we have another fire because its a pandemic and we have nothing else to do, its a legal day to burn so no problem! I happen to look out the window as I'm walking downstairs to go outside to see Karen standing on her tip toes taking pictures of my husband and dogs in the backyard.  I went ahead and snapped a quick picture of that because that was next level creepy.  We've had several fires since then without incident, after the last time I made sure to very loudly say that abuse of emergency services is a crime and in this manner is harassment.\n\n In addition to our annoying fires we also have 3 dogs and they do bark but we are very very diligent about curbing that behavior because we totally get that its annoying. We lived in apartments with them for years and are used to being respectful. We place a lot of importance on being good neighbors and dog owners. We are mindful about what time it is when we let them out and have made sure we are well within the legal noise requirements. Despite these efforts, they still bark, it happens. \n\nSo I'm outside doing some yard work and one dog starts yapping, I tell her to shoosh, redirect her etc. I hear my neighbors sliding door open and close while I'm doing that. About 5 minutes later, dog starts barking again and I tell her to stop and before I can even finish getting the words out Kevin storms out in his backyard and screams SHUT UP at the top of his lungs, then slams the door shut behind them. Over the last two weeks this has happened about 3 times, no one is barking more than usual.... A couple of days ago my husband let the dogs out at 9pm, I'm walking downstairs and see Karen and Kevin looking in our backyard. Karen was looking incredibly irate, they go back inside and I can tell she is just screaming at her husband - all the hand motions are going and she keeps pointing to our property. There was a raccoon in the yard and the dogs barked about 4 times before my husband brought them in, made sure the critter was gone and let them back out without further barking.  I watched her look into our backyard a few times and continue to yell at her husband about us for about 20 minutes. I totally understand if they are concerned about their kid waking up but I'm pretty sure Karen would have made sure of that with her obvious yelling more than our dogs' couple of barks. \n\nThe peeking into our yard and taking pictures stuff really creeps me out. Seeing how incredibly, irrationally angry this woman was really truly concerns me though. We have placed cameras on that side of the house now so we can see if anyone throws anything over the fence - I am legitimately worried they will try to poison our dogs. I don't care about being best friends with these people, but I want to at least be cordial and not have to worry about someone fucking with my property or calling authorities on me for no reason. To this point they have not confronted us or attempted to talk to us about any perceived problem, we have also not tried to engage because we feel it might actually make things worse. What can we do? I know that some people will just never be happy no matter what, but I at least want to make sure they aren't over there cursing our names for no good reason! For the holiday's we are giving our neighbors cards with $5 at starbucks and I plan to include them as well, but I am struggling in what to even write in the card as well. \"Thanks for being assholes to us from day 1?\" \n\nAnyways... any advice on what we can do to cool down this Karen and at least achieve the \"smile and wave\" relationship would be much appreciated.\n\nEdit: forgot to add, no trespassing signs posted within a couple days of the first interaction and the fence went up about a month later. Also Karen is a pediatric resident at our local hospital, Kevin is an engineer.\n\nEdit 2: lots of questions and comments on the extent that neighbors were crossing our property. Approx 2k feet. Imagine watching someone walk up your driveway and then behind your house. That's a lot of walking on my property.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/kfb3ji/advice_on_how_to_make_peace_with_really_angry/", "created_utc": 1608254809.0, "score": 463, "author": "spottedgiraffes", "num_comments": 241, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/kfb3ji/advice_on_how_to_make_peace_with_really_angry/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "About to move? Clean your house. Not going to move? Still clean your damn house. [Rant]", "selftext": "My wife and I just moved into a new home and we were excited to open the front door on closing day and start doing a cleaning before moving our stuff in. Little did we know that it wouldn't be a regular cleaning, it would be a gruesome, nasty, disturbing DEEP CLEANING required. They were good at hiding their stains and smells during the staging and showings. The house was built in 2004 but it looked like it was built in 1985 before we cleaned it.\n\nI'm not even upset that there was some sticky stains at the back of a cupboards, or some mildew in the corner of a shower... those are to be expected. But there were stains that just made me go \"What the actual hell? How is THAT dirty?!\" So I've compiled a short list of things that you guys should clean ASAP whether you're moving or not. Vacuuming, doing a quick mop and then wiping the bathroom with 1 lysol wipe IS NOT PROPER CLEANING. \n\n\n* **Clean behind, around and under your damn toilet.** There are 3 toilets in this house, and they were all beyond gross. Some people resort to changing toilet seats when they move into a new house. We thought we would too. Then we said fuck it, we're replacing the whole toilet. 3 new toilets for $500 because the previous owners didn't know how to use a mop and clean behind, under and around the toilet. The piss odor was permanently baked into and under the toilet. \n\n\n* **Take EVERYTHING out of your damn fridge and clean the inside of it PROPERLY**. We literally almost threw out the fridge, and it would be a shame because it's French door, stainless steel, beautiful and big and only 5 years old. And yet I literally was googling around for where to buy a new fridge from instead of cleaning it because it was so disturbing. We opened the deli drawer at the bottom, pulled it out and saw CHUNKS of mold in the back. I'm talking 3-dimensional, thick slobs of mold that you could pick up and throw against the wall. Fucking atrocious. The previous owners just never cared enough. Luckily my mother in law convinced us to keep it and she cleaned it for us with gloves, a mask and every strong cleaning product she could find. \n\n\n* **Steam clean your damn carpet every once in a while**. There were stains in the carpet that were too far gone. One of them was piss. (An elderly grandma with dementia lived in that room, probably peed herself). Whole carpet had to go. $3800 for removal and replacement. Probably would've replaced it anyway because it's 16 years old, but it wasn't fun to walk into the room and smell piss. \n\n\n* **Run the self-clean cycle on your damn washing machine once in a while, and clean out your damn dryer vent after every load**. The washing machine smelled like ass because they never used the self-clean feature. We had to buy a washing machine cleaner and run cycle to kill the odor. Also, if you have a front load washer, keep the door open after loads to prevent mildew. And how the hell does one have a smelly DRYER?! It's literally where clean clothes and fresh smelling dryer sheets go. And yet here, the dryer smells like humidity and ass. Sprayed the drum with vinegar and wiped it down and that helped, but ultimately the whole vent needs to be vacuumed out because I'm sure it's clogged -- it's not fully drying clothes properly. Clothes come out slightly damp and muggy. Disgusting.\n\n\n* **Your damn microwave, your damn stove, your damn dishwasher all need to be cleaned**. Wipe down the outsides, the insides (some ovens self-clean which helps), and the handles and the doors and the tops of these appliances. Microwaves are notorious for being sticky alllll around them. Wipe them down routinely.\n\n\n* **Clean your damn shower heads**. Ours are caked with mildew. Just because clean water comes out of it, doesn't mean it never needs to be cleaned. We have new ones coming in from Amazon tonight. It will be nice to shower with an actual clean shower head. \n\n\nAll in all, just mop your floors. Dust your baseboards and ceiling fans. Clean up spills immediately. Wipe your appliances. Vacuum your carpets. Sweep your floors inside and outside the house (curb appeal). Just... just clean your damn house. Please. For your own sake, your guests sake, and the sake of people that will be living there in the future when you move away or pass away. People can tell that your house is dirty when they walk in your house and it immediately makes them uncomfortable. A little *messy* here and there won't kill anybody. Messy and dirty are two different things. *Messy* is some clothes on the floor or a bath towel throw on the bed. *Dirty* is grime, filth, funk and gunk. Don't be dirty.\n\nThe roof was also due to be changed so we replaced it the day after we got the keys. We got the house under market value in an amazing neighborhood and the sellers literally missed out on thousands of dollars because they didn't keep their house clean and didn't replace their roof that was in terrible condition. Anyway, after all the time we spent cleaning, replacing the carpets and slapping a fresh coat of paint on the entire main floor and second floor, it actually looks and smells like a new build house, so that's nice.\n\nNow for the love of God, go clean something!\n\n\n\n**TLDR**: Bought a house, previous owners were filthy and gross. Not only was moving day hectic because of moving, but it was incredibly frustrating because of how disgusting the previous owners were. Don't be a disgusting slob, clean your house routinely. You'll like it more and your guests will like it more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/iz19z2/about_to_move_clean_your_house_not_going_to_move/", "created_utc": 1600967398.0, "score": 463, "author": "ChocolatePoo82", "num_comments": 189, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/iz19z2/about_to_move_clean_your_house_not_going_to_move/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Neighbor building gate for accessing our private road", "selftext": "See:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nMi0c7F\n\nSo I and about 10 neighbors share a private road, this neighbor like many others just has a fence along the private road \n\nThey trimmed branches and made a hole across from our front door to get access to our private road. They're now putting up the gate. The other neighbors and I along the private road pay for tree maintenance(about $1k a year) along with road maintenance every 10 years. Nothing formal. We have a nice set of trees across our front door giving us privacy and we keep them well trimmed. \n\nTheir fence is on that property (I assume) then there are the trees on an easement and the private road. Then our house. \n\n\nThey claim the city allowed it but I'm skeptical there's  legal standing. \n\nIf this is allowed then a bunch of other neighbors are going to do the same thing, using our private road more without paying anything. \n\nHow should I handle this? \n\nEdit - older neighbors came back from church. So apparently we own the property just beyond the fence but we share it.. so they cut trees from our property. Also the fence is shared so if they want to make any changes they have to get it approved by us.  They're reinstalling the fence as I write this. Apparently the owner of the property doing this is a known jerk. A neighbor on this street has this happen to him and he demanded everything be restored from the fence to the trees they cut. So I can go after this guy for the branches he cut on my property . But I'm not petty so won't do that.\n\nEdit 2- another neighbor said he'd been talking with said neighbor attempting this. He's building a granny unit and wanted the occupant to have access to our private Street. Also the owner came out and had other reasons for his attempt to do this, including water coming from our property, kids needing access to the street for biking,  so the story changes. I will get a lawyer involved and give him officially written notice we don't approve. Also the owner couldn't give any paperwork supporting the claim that the city approved this. \n\nEdit 3- he tried this with a neighbor of ours and my neighbor stopped him so it looks like he thought we would be easier targets lol. Little did he know my wife is polish and can't be pushed around. \n\nEdit 4- for neighbor 2 in edit 3 who had them remove a gate they added, they still managed to move the fence drive onto neighbor 2's property. And they never replaced the trees they cut down dispite promises. So these are very pushy manipulative people. They also asked neighbor 3 for access and they were told no, neighbor 3 doesn't share a fence, they just wanted someone to give them support to maybe claim their neighbors agreed? Very odd.  Neighbor 3 is quite old so maybe they thought she was senile and would agree. They're most likely not going to stop and try everything they can to get access. So lawyers will have to be involved. \n\nEdit 5- it's getting spicy. I found the current owner of the easement. Can't say more. But it's not any of the neighbors. The pushy neighbor was trying to see if we know who the owner is.  My deed grants me access to the easement but his does not. Most likely he will try to buy the easement so I probably need to do the before he does.  He knows what I know but he was probably fishing to see how much I knew. Like I said he won't give up so now it's a race to track down that very old owner.  If he buys it he can put up that gate and maybe driveway, it would be his dream. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1jyh815/neighbor_building_gate_for_accessing_our_private/", "created_utc": 1744576154.0, "score": 458, "author": "Expensive-Soft5164", "num_comments": 55, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1jyh815/neighbor_building_gate_for_accessing_our_private/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The price was pretty good, but it was completely undeveloped.\n\nBefore closing,  I got a survey done,  a geotechnical analysis, and a perc test (it needs sceptic). I also talked with the county's land development department to make sure there were no issues with developing the property(i.e., building a house). \n\nThe survey came back and showed a neighbor had recently extended their fence and put structure (sheds, I think) 17ft into the property. This property is 100ft wide. So,  17ft is like them literally stealing almost 1/5 of the lot. My response: no sale. \n\nThe sellers said they would get the neighbor to take down the fence. They sent a certified letter and the survey and the fence got taken down. So, I close on the property, have it cleared, and put up a boundary fence (for obvious reasons). This crazy neighbor tries to prevent the fence installers from putting in the fence. There is a survey, there are property markers (some of which the neighbor pulled up), and she won't let them put a fence inside my property line.\n\nFinally, the fence goes in. And then the neighbor gets the Department of Environmental Protection to investigate designating my property as a wetland, which would absolutely kill the property value and make it very hard to build - not impossible,  but very hard.

{"title": "Home accidentally excluded from HOA", "selftext": "My Wife and I recently moved into a new build and we received a letter saying that our home was excluded from the HOA by mistake. \n\nThe letter asked us to voluntarily join, but didn\u2019t really say anything beyond that.\n\nAs it turns out, an entire section of the neighborhood was accidentally excluded from the HOA (roughly 25%).\n\nI guess the covenants weren\u2019t attached to the homes before they were sold or something like that. \n\nAll of the homes including ours were originally intended to be in the HOA, so we were going to just sign up anyway because we were already planning to be part of it.\n\nHowever, once I found out how many homes surrounding ours also weren\u2019t in the HOA, I started having doubts. We\u2019re pretty much right in the middle of the no-HOA homes, so my concern is that if we sign up, we\u2019d be subjecting ourselves to enforceable rules that many of our neighbors wouldn\u2019t be subjected to. So far, only 5 of those homes have voluntarily joined. \n\nI realize the benefits of an HOA with helping to keep your neighborhood nice and funding improvements and whatnot, but then I\u2019ve also heard stories of how they recently approved someone\u2019s paint color and then tried fighting it after it was painted because they didn\u2019t agree with the \u201cshade\u201d of the color they approved\u2026 that\u2019s the kind of pettiness I don\u2019t want to subject ourselves to if our immediate neighbor can do the same exact thing with no repercussions.\n\nWhat to do? Has anyone else experienced this type of thing?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks for all of the feedback, Everyone! \n\nWe\u2019re going to wait it out and not willingly join. If it comes to being forced to join somehow then so be it, but yes it doesn\u2019t make sense to willingly give up some rights just for the sake of joining with no benefits to it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t provide any benefits like mowing or trash or anything else like that. We\u2019ll just be good and mindful neighbors (as we usually are) and hopefully have no problems! We\u2019re even willing to make donations to the community fund and whatnot. \n\nFor the most part it seems like the current HOA board is hands off and may just let you be, but like many have said on here, board members change and it only takes one to muck things up. There\u2019s no telling what the future board will be like or what changes they\u2019ll propose. \n\nAppreciate all of the advice and opinions on here!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/11uc5nn/home_accidentally_excluded_from_hoa/", "created_utc": 1679107132.0, "score": 458, "author": "RoyalNooblet", "num_comments": 440, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/11uc5nn/home_accidentally_excluded_from_hoa/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Bidet PSA: Beat The Toilet Paper Madness", "selftext": "**This is my OC, there are no spam/advertising/referrer links. The only links provided are to images hosted on Imgur. I\u2019m simply writing this to help change perspectives.**\n\nFirst, two questions: \n\n1. If you got poop on your hands, would you just wipe it off with dry paper or would you wash with soap and water? \n\n2. Why is the rest of your body any different?\n\nI\u2019m an American who\u2019s been living overseas for the last 2 years. In Southeast Asia, the overwhelming majority of people (I would say 98%) do not use toilet paper, we use a bidet sprayer, or \u201cbum gun.\u201d I have been asked many times why \u201cpeople from my country\u201d are on YouTube fighting each other in Walmart for the last roll of TP and why people are hoarding it, reselling it, and paying over-the-top crazy prices for it now because of the Corona Virus lockdowns. It really is quite ridiculous when you think about it.\nI was raised with TP in America and used it exclusively until 2 years ago when I left and came to Asia. The bidet has changed my life and I\u2019ve decided to write this post to explain the different types of bidet products and how and why you should consider incorporating them into your life. It\u2019s cleaner, healthier, and best of all, eliminates the need to hoard TP, suffer from out-of-stock anxiety, or pay $30 a roll from a shady character behind 7-11. I\u2019m happy to see the recent increase in interest on this sub regarding the bidet, and I want to try and help nurture this interest. \n\nI will be the first to admit that until I used one, I thought the bidet was \u201cweird.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand it, wasn\u2019t raised with it, and just had zero interest in trying it. I actually had a strong aversion to it that I had no reason for, it was senseless really. I was just totally happy with TP. I even continued to use TP for my first few days in Asia. Then one day I tried it and never went back. Sure it\u2019s a bit strange but just give it a try. I have had so many friends back home install them and fall in love with them. If you can get past the initial weirdness and get used to it (it only takes a few times) I guarantee you will have a different perspective. And you can proudly walk past the TP aisle in Walmart with an accomplished and superior smirk on your face.\n\nThere are a few different styles of bidets at all different price points. They all follow the same concept - using water instead of toilet paper to clean your lower regions (gender depending) after pooping or peeing. There are different styles and they all accomplish the same thing via different methods. \n\n**BENEFITS:**\n\n**Using water keeps you cleaner:**\nYou can not clean all of the poop off your skin with dry toilet paper. If you disagree with this, put some poop on your hand, wipe it off with dry TP, and then see if are comfortable with going about your day like that. No matter how much TP you use, you will still leave behind a thin film of fecal matter. The moist and warm environment down below harbors and encourages bacteria growth. You will inevitably sweat down there and the poop residue will mix with the sweat and spread itself around your crotch and into your clothing. This can cause odor, itching, and discomfort. Some people use soap along with the bidet - this is the cleanest way but if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to do this, you\u2019re still miles ahead of TP just using water. \n\nUsing wet wipes is a better option than dry TP but these are absolutely terrible for sewer systems, septic tanks, and the environment. \u201cFlushable\u201d wipes wreak havoc all over the US and the Wastewater industry hates them. Lots of your tax money is spent unclogging these wipes from municipal waste systems. \u201cFlushable\u201d does not mean safe for sewer systems. This is a marketing gimmick to sell more wipes. You can flush a lot of things(including a bucket golf balls, thanks American Standard), doesn\u2019t mean they will break down in the sewer system. Want to see for yourself? Get two buckets of water. Put a handful of toilet paper in one and a single \u201cflushable\u201d wipe in the other. Mix them around and see which one won\u2019t clog sewer lines and pumping equipment. Some people throw wipes in the garbage. This is the proper way but now you either deal with the smell or you waste plastic taking the garbage out multiple times a day. These wipes will end up in the landfill where they will take years to break down. Additionally, the cost of wipes adds up and requires constantly spending money. \n\nUsing a bidet is also more hygienic - no need to put your hands near your poop. No risk of poke-through, finger contact, or knuckle-touching toilet water. Granted, you should be washing your hands after using the bathroom in any case, but a bidet eliminates the associated trauma of these things and also reduces your contact with bacteria. \n\n**Swamp ass:**\nIf you live in a hot climate, you\u2019re likely familiar with this phenomenon. If you sweat, you also sweat down there. Using a bidet to just wash off during hot times is a lifesaver. It\u2019s unbelievably refreshing and not only does it bring relief from the hot, sweaty, miserable swamp in your crotch, it also helps prevent heat rash, bacterial infections, just generally feels awesome. Think of it as a cool dip in a refreshing mountain stream for your nether regions. \n\n**Cheaper, more pandemic proof, less anxiety:** \nMany people in the world use a bidet only, some people use a combination of bidet and TP. Many people just wash off, dry for a minute, then go on about their business. I do not like being wet down there so after I wash, I use a single pass of TP to dry. I use about 80-90% less TP than I did without the bidet. The water does all the work, you need very little TP to dry. A single roll of TP lasts me about 2 weeks now. Once you have purchased and installed a bidet, your only cost is the water (and optional electricity) it uses. I estimate my use to be about 20oz/600ml of water per session. You may use more or less water. We waste more than this waiting for the shower to get warm. One of the best benefits to having a bidet is that you no longer have to worry about stores not having TP, or paying exorbitant prices for it. You don\u2019t really *need* TP with a bidet. Worst case scenario if you can\u2019t find TP, you can still poop without anxiety. \n\n**Illness/digestive issues/food poisoning:**\nWe\u2019ve all had diarrhea, no need to be shy about it. And we all know the feeling of wiping yourself raw after your 14th trip to the toilet in 24 hours. Or the burning sensation from stomach acid, food poisoning, or spicy food that went right through you. The bidet is a great relief for all of these. A stream of cool water during times like these is amazing and can remove the dread of another trip to the bathroom. \n\n**Cleaning:** \nMany bathrooms in asia are completely tiled, either half way or all the way up the wall and they have floor drains. No drywall or wood used. Because of this, you can use a handheld bidet for cleaning the bathroom (or washing the dog) and wash it all right down the drain. If you don\u2019t have a bathroom like this and don\u2019t plan a remodel anytime soon, this is kind of a moot point. But if you do, it\u2019s an added benefit. \n\n**TYPES OF BIDETS, FROM MOST EXPENSIVE TO CHEAPEST:**\n(Links are only for images, I do not use advertising or referrer links)\n\n**Oldest/Original - The Standalone Bidet:** \n\n[Pic](https://i.imgur.com/I0v1PGM.jpg)\n\nA separate fixture that is only used for washing after you have used the toilet. It\u2019s like a sink for your bottom. It\u2019s not really practical for adding to most existing bathrooms and it\u2019s expensive because you must purchase it, then add/modify plumbing to accommodate it. Plus you need the space. Aside from that, you have to waddle over to it once you are done on the toilet. \n\nWith this style you use your hand and water/soap to wash yourself.\n\n**Most Luxurious/Most Features - The Bidet Seat(washlet):**\n\n[Pic](https://i.imgur.com/t2uMnNr.jpg)\n\nThis is a bidet that either replaces your current toilet seat or adds onto it, depending on the model. There are a wide range of styles, options, and prices, ranging from around $30 for a basic cold water only model to over $1000 for a full featured model including heated water, heated seat, heated dryer, remote control, and other features. There are models for every price point between, it just depends on what you want. The basic cold-water-only models only require a water connection and if you are even slightly handy, you can hook them up yourself. The more elaborate models require an electrical connection - most American bathrooms won\u2019t have this already and you may find it difficult or expensive to find an electrician to install an outlet behind the toilet. However, if you are an electrician you can do this yourself. Amazon has a wide selection of bidet seats, many other retailers carry them as well. \n\nWith this style you only touch the controls to activate the stream of water. \n\n**Most Practical/Easiest/Cheapest - The bidet sprayer (aka Bum Gun):**\n\n[Pic](https://i.imgur.com/QZrmGHm.jpg)\n\nThis is by far my favorite. If you\u2019ve ever been to Southeast Asia, you know what this is. It\u2019s the cheapest, easiest to install, and most versatile to use. It\u2019s very basic, and has only 1 moving part. No heated seat, no electrical connection, and you can install it in about 10 minutes with very basic skills and no remodeling. It\u2019s essentially the same sprayer mounted on your kitchen sink. If you are handy with plumbing, you can put one of these together with sink sprayer, shower hose, and t-valve. If not, you can buy a kit with all the parts and instructions for $20-$80, depending on how fancy you want it. You can get a good quality/good looking one for less than $30. It connects to the water line on the toilet with a t-valve. You can also get fancy and install a separate water line for it, although this will only be practical during a remodel or new build. \n\nIf you live in a cold climate, it can take some getting used to. I\u2019ve had a few people back home ask me about hooking this up with warm water. It\u2019s possible, but again, it\u2019s going to be more time/cost to run a hot water line to the toilet and install a mixing valve. Then each time you use it you will need to let it run for a minute and adjust it just like the shower. Personally, it was super easy for me to get used to cold water(even in the China winter)- it\u2019s only a few seconds and only on one area, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re taking a cold shower. Plus if your house is heated/insulated, the water shouldn\u2019t be dangerously cold anyway. If you are handy, the configuration/adaptability possibilities are endless.\n\nI do suggest that - unless you have a bathroom with a floor drain - you install a shutoff t-valve just in case the sprayer ever leaks. Always install a brass (not plastic) valve, it\u2019s worth the extra cost to prevent leaks. \n\nWith this style you use your hand to \u201caim\u201d the sprayer and squeeze the trigger to wash yourself. There are different styles of washing - some people wash from the front, some people lean to one side and wash from the other side. Either way, I find that this style of bidet gives a direct, thorough, efficient cleaning. If you have strong water pressure, you may have to reduce it (with a valve) to a comfortable level. I have extremely strong pressure but I regulate by how hard I squeeze the trigger on the sprayer. \n\n**I hope this gives you some inspiration and insight into using a bidet. Literally the only adjustment you have to make is in your head. Panic and frenzy over stockpiling TP is really, really silly when you think about it. And even more so after you switch to a bidet. There\u2019s enough to stress about these days, it\u2019s simple to cross this one off the list.** \n\n**Please feel free to either ask questions or add onto this if you have additional insight.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/g2we2e/bidet_psa_beat_the_toilet_paper_madness/", "created_utc": 1587104354.0, "score": 445, "author": "Clicktrip", "num_comments": 197, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/g2we2e/bidet_psa_beat_the_toilet_paper_madness/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Regrets on buying a house", "selftext": "I bought a house in October 2023. \nEveryone told me it\u2019s the best thing I could ever do. \nHere are the events leading up to now where I can confidently say I regret this whole decision and wish I just stayed in my apartment. \n\n\nFirst issue - Moth balls \nFound a house I liked, made an appointment and went to view it. Immediately got hit with the smell of moth balls. It was intense. I was assured the smell would go away after moving in and painting. So I looked past it. 3 weeks later I can literally taste moth balls. On every piece of my clothing all I can smell is moth balls. It\u2019s gotten into my car, it\u2019s in my bed and made it into my plates. \n\nSecond issue - Furnace \nWhen I applied for the house I was to told the hot water tank and the furnace were rentals and I would need to take over the rental contact. I agreed and was told what the price was. \nI called up reliance (garbage company) switched them in to my name, price was confirmed, all was good. 3 days before closing they said the furnace couldn\u2019t be transferred red into my name unless I got a lawyer and documents signed. I closed on the house and when I did that, I had the lawyers send the documents for the furnace. When I got it. 85. then showed the price was 3 times what I was quoted and I had to pay it monthly instead of every three months. I didn\u2019t sign anything with them and said no come take the furnace. It took 1 whole week for them to tell me no they can\u2019t remove it because it\u2019s not in my name. I have been fighting with them since to get it out so I can get a new one, to top it off. It has started snowing and now I don\u2019t have a usable furnace. \n\nThird issue - appliances\nI have two bathrooms and two kitchens (one without a fridge or stove in it yet). 3 days after moving in, the bigger fridge broke and is unusable, the toilet doesn\u2019t stop running, the downstairs bathroom suddenly smells like mold and there\u2019s a leak in the sink. Bought a washer and dryer and only the washer showed up, dryer is in back order so now I can\u2019t do laundry. \n\nFourth issue - plumbing \nMy house is old. I was aware it needed work. I went into one of the crawl spaces and found a leaky pipe, paid someone to fix it, they came when I was at work to fix it. They did the wrong pipe so now I have a brand new pipe, a leaky pipe and a muddy crawl space because I thought it was fixed so I didn\u2019t go down and check until a week later. \n\nFinal issue \nCost. I have now gone into 14k more debt than I wanted to because of things I shouldn\u2019t have even had an issue with. \n\n\nSo here I am. All I can smell is moth balls, I can\u2019t do my own laundry, I don\u2019t have a fridge until next week, I owe Home Depot almost 5k I have a muddy moldy crawl space with a leak I need to be a second person to fix \nAnd I\u2019m broke \n\nHow was this the \u201cbest decision I can make\u201d\n\n\n(Edit) \nFor those asking, \n\nI have had 2 inspections. One before buying, one after. The one before the water was turned off but we didn\u2019t think it was an issue\n\nIt\u2019s Canada, dumb to do it still but renting a furnace and a water heater is legal and stupid. \n\nThe source of the moth balls has been discovered, was in a crawl space \n\nPipes have been fixed and no more leaks \nI changed the toilets out now too \n\n\nHaving less issues I hope it just goes up from here. \n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/17nb8j0/regrets_on_buying_a_house/", "created_utc": 1699063133.0, "score": 453, "author": "DoNotActivate", "num_comments": 350, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/17nb8j0/regrets_on_buying_a_house/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "What a \"Welcome to Home Ownership\" event", "selftext": "I had just picked up the keys on Friday. The following day was a beautiful, clear day, perfect for working outside. I had just finished pressure washing the front of the house and moved to the south side. I decided to hook up to a spigot on that side of the house. The previous owners didn't cover the threads with tape when they painted so the layers of old paint made it so I couldn't tighten the hose enough. When I turned the spigot on, water started spraying out of the threads. I decided to use a different spigot and attempted to turn the spigot off. It wouldn't turn off, but I couldn't tell exactly how \"not off\" it was and decided to unhook the hose to find out. Wrong decision, this thing was ON and quickly started blasting a hole through the mulch and dirt. I tried to close the spigot, wrenching so hard the metal handle snapped off. FUUUUUUUCK. I tried to put the hose back on to cap it but the pressure had nowhere to go and just caused the  water to spray backwards completely soaking me. Additionally, the pressure made it impossible to get the threads aligned and the hose on. NOOOOOO. I ran around the property looking for the water main, but couldn't find it (wouldn't have mattered if I did because I didn't have a water main wrench to turn it off with). Then during one of my panicked laps around the house I found a small, plastic valve adapter that I  could use to stop the uncontrolled flow, which had now dug a hole about a foot in diameter and just as deep. I wrestled with the spigot and valve for a few minutes before finally getting the valve on and closed, stopping the torrent of water. I sat in the yard exhausted, bewildered, and completely drenched, with bits of beauty bark, plants, and bugs all over me. I looked so defeated and pathetic.

{"title": "Homeownership and an unpopular opinion", "selftext": "I've got two adult children who have ventured out to start buying homes and I really didn't think about this until they started looking at houses. But, I feel that a lot of young and first time home owners have some unrealistic expectations or aren't really ready to be a home owner AND THAT IS OK! \n\nAll of my below comments are generalities because there will obviously be exceptions in every case. \n\n> 1: The home your parents are living in isn't a good comparison for your own first purchase. \n\nThe home your parents are living has likely taken them a long time to get to where they can afford it and they've likely taken many years to get to that level of home ownership. Using your parent's house as a comparison for what you should buy isn't very fair to YOU. \n\n\n> 2: Rent is not throwing away money.\n\nYeah, rent is a little higher than a house payment for a place of the same size however you are paying someone else to assume all the risk of that house existing. See my next point... \n\n\n> 3: Being able to afford the payment isn't enough.\n\nYou need to be able to fund emergencies in addition to your house payment. A house is a series of degrading elements that at one time or another will fail and none of them are inexpensive. A new heat pump in my area for my current house will cost between $8000 and $12,000. A new roof can be $10,000. Septic system failures can cost over $20,000 if the leach field needs to be completely moved or you have to change it to an above ground system. If you've got a well on site and the pump needs to be replaced, that's $1000+. \n\nThat is just the typical degradations... there are more and they're all expensive. \n\n\n> 4: Your house will not be perfect.\n\nEvery home has it's issues and that is completely normal. The trick is knowing what they are and what is considered typical vs abnormal. I know that our 40 year old house needs new insulation and siding. We get a lot of moisture in the spring/summer time and the entire house moves around a bit. Certain times of the year there are some door frames that swell and are a pain to use. Other times of the year, the doors shrink back to normal and they are fine. I'm ok with these and we have a plan in place for them. \n\nLearning to replace light switches, perform emergency plumbing work, drywall repair and yard maintenance will be key to being a successful home owner.\n\n\n> 5: If you decide to build.. do not buy the best appliances from the builder unless you can pay for them outside of the loan. \n\nNo matter what you do, get the CHEAPEST appliances that will allow you to move in. Our previous home was a 3000 sq/ft home that we had the builder put all of the nicest appliances into. In the 6th year in the house our dishwasher and refrigerator both died right outside of warranty. If I had included these in the mortgage, we'd be paying the bank for another 9 years for an appliance that had already been replaced. \n\n\n> 6: If you can, get a 15 year mortgage.\n\nMost people live in their homes for only about 5 to 10 years before moving on and having only 5 years of equity in a 30 year mortgage barely scrapes at the principle.  Having a 15 year mortgage means that when you sell, you're gonna have a fat wad of cash to throw down on your next home. You'll be baby stepping into nicer homes.\n\n> 7: Your home inspector is your best friend.\n\nIf you get a home inspected get the most highly recommended inspector you can find. One that is recommended by the mortgage lender doesn't always work out. The lender is there to make money and if an inspector scares someone away, they don't. Finding someone that doesn't have any money in the game is key. I had a guy that used to make people ANGRY. He documented absolutely everything he found and gave the buyer a multi page PDF with pictures and reference material. He never worked with a mortgage company but got almost all of his jobs by word of mouth. He cost about 20% more than other guys, but he spent several hours at a home crawling under, over and through. \n\nMy current home I didn't have a great inspector since we moved to another part of the country. They should have noticed the plastic tub in the attic that our bathroom exhaust was draining condensation into. \n\nEdit: I hate the reddit formatter..\n\nEdit: Not at all surprisingly, the biggest controversy is over #6. I'll stand by my statement 100% although /u/FFF12321 makes a good point in his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/j3xy0v/homeownership_and_an_unpopular_opinion/g7fdekb/) that this is likely dependent on life stage, experience with debt and future plans.

{"title": "Everyone please do not buy home warranties", "selftext": "Thank you guys so much about all the good comments. Currently, people who like the home warranties are saying it gives you peace of mind. Now I'd like to share my experience in detail because I'm the one who thought it would  give me peace of mind.\n\nI thought the home warranty is the god send gift. I know I was very stupid.\n\nOne day, John visited me for my pool heater. He looked like a very nice gentleman. It's actually the first time I own the single family house and I never had a pool. Meaning I have no idea about anything in my house. John was so nice giving me advices and stuff. He gained my trust more than 100% at that point. However, as soon as he saw my pool heater, he said it's illegally installed. And if he reports this to the warranty company I would lose all my warranty. You have no idea how scared I was. Because without the warranty I cannot afford to fix my pool heater. But oh my god, John was so nice and kind. He understood all my situation and said we have to feed new gas pipe first to make it legal and safe. However, since it's not covered by the warranty, he said he would make it look like he is ordering parts for my pool heater and once it's approved he can give that money as credit toward installing new pipe. I thought I met a real Santa Claus or something. And he started measuring, and said he saw bigger foot print on where my current pool heater is. And there is bigger pipe capped, right next to the pipe currently feeding gas. Meaning that there was a bigger pool heater that used now capped thicker pipe. He said if this bigger pipe is working we don't have to feed new pipe. Instead it's bigger pipe, so we need to install new bigger heater. I was good with whichever option he gives me as long as the heater works. I just told him that I want the least expensive method. He told me he's gonna submit authorization for parts on Monday and on Tuesday he would send me the estimate including those credits.\n\nOn Monday he texted me that he submitted for the authorization and would send me the estimate on Tuesday. I was very happy. On Tuesday, I didn't receive anything. On Wednesday I texted him if he sent the estimate. He said he sent, but he would send it again. I asked him again. Are you sending it via email or text? His response was \"email, just be patient, my girls is doing whatever whatever...\" So I just waited. Couple hours later he called me and said he doesn't know what's going on and ask me to give him 35 min. Of course he didn't send anything that day.\n\nThe next day, I texted him (The reason I kept texting him was that his phone blocks all the numbers) I didn't receive anything. He said he forget to text me. An finally send me an estimate in text. He has to perform gas pressure test and it's $375 and I should Zelle him $125 or something for work to be started. There's no mention about credit, not even pool heater. I became angry and texted him saying \"Let's forget about this. I do not want to proceed.\" His response was \"Ok, I will close out your warranty permanently.\" From that moment I decided come clean and try to do everything legally. I texted him to report my illegal installation to the warranty. That way I can at least seek some legal advice I assumed. Surprisingly, he called me. His first word was \"Jeez, what's the issue?\". At that point of time I completely lost human mind and started cussing him out crazy and kept telling him to report to the warranty company so that I actually lose my warranty. Now is the interesting part.\n\n**He said he cannot do that because it's not illegally installed. It's just a connection problem. Oh Wow...**\n\nI called FNHW to request a different service provider. The agent said they already paid John and he reported all the work has been finished and if they send out different service provider I have to pay $90 again. I tried to explain to the agent, but he said he trust the service provider. I told him that I'd like to speak to his supervisor. The agent said supervisors are not usually around but he can submit a ticket and someone will call by the end of the day. Of course no one called. Instead I received an email saying my parts are covered but if the issue is different they are gonna charge me $90, and so on and on and on about $90 charge parade. In email, there was actually space where I can reply. I told them there is no need because there will send out the same service provider. I told them to close the claim in email and I left review for the first time in my life.\n\nThe next day, FNHW called me and said they would send me a different service provider because John said he doesn't want that job. The next company they were sending was Unified Contractors Inc in CA. If you check their review, you will be very surprised. Everyone there is screaming this place is scam. I called the FNHW and told them to just close my claim.\n\nThank you guys for reading this long story. At the end, for me, I would have had way better peace of mind If I just didn't have that warranty. That way I wouldn't even think about fixing it until I have some funds. Of course, if it's urgent issue like water leaking in the house, my case does not apply to you at all because you cannot wait until you have enough funds.\n\n===================\n\nPlease be careful when you read comments. It seems hired reviewers or those bad service providers are here trying to say things that would probably happen in their dreams. I'm sure there are people with good experience and try to tell us it's not so bad. The problem is these people are talking like real good people. Fake reviewers tactics are always evolving. Please be careful when you make decisions.\n\n===================\n\nI'm currently trying to reply to all the comments here. But I never thought there would be this many comments. I thought there are only gonna be handful of people talking about this. If you did not receive my reply please don't be upset. For sure I read your comments. It's just I'm not so sure what to write to your comment besides saying \"Thank you for your comment!\". But I really appreciate every comments you guys left. They are all very valuable to me and others looking for decent warranty companies.\n\nEven though the title says \"Everyone do not buy home warranties\", I actually learn a lot from the people having good experiences. And I really really really  hope those satisfied customers here are all real so that others can make better decision when it comes to buying warranties.\n\nAnd Please no sarcasm. If you have other thought you can just explain without attacking others.\n\n===================\n\nFrom other's comment and after I've done some research, I learned how these warranty companies pushing the service providers. It's possible that not all bad service providers are actually really bad. It's possible that these poor people are being pushed into the corner. For this reason, I'm going to replace the name of the service provider with John and remove the business name. Right now, I keep trying to contact this service provider and listened to his situation and try to become friends with him. Of course he is not responding now. But I'll keep trying until opens his mind and become happy. We started off really bad but after all we are all human being and I believe it's all about relationships.\n\n====================", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1ilver8/everyone_please_do_not_buy_home_warranties/", "created_utc": 1739153546.0, "score": 439, "author": "Unable-Commercial625", "num_comments": 380, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1ilver8/everyone_please_do_not_buy_home_warranties/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "UPDATE: Concerned about Liability with Neighbor Kid", "selftext": "Hey folks! My previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/xp140e/concerned_about_liability_with_neighbor_kid/) garnered enough attention and input that I felt I should post an update. Thank you to everyone for your kind advice. Here are the steps I have taken after reading all your comments:\n\n1. I installed a MyQ remote garage door monitor so I can close the door anytime, anywhere.\n2. I moved my SimpliSafe indoor security camera, which I rarely use, into the garage, so I can make sure Jonny is never in garage if I close it remotely.\n3. I did *not* get a true umbrella insurance policy since it would also require me to increase my auto coverage, *but* I did increase by personal injury and liability coverage on my home insurance to $1 million, which only cost me a few extra dollars per year.\n4. I knocked on the door and spoke to Jonny's father about keeping Jonny off of our property unless we are at home with him. The conversation went well.\n5. I sent a summary of my conversation with Jonny's father to both of his grandparents since they are the homeowners and seem to do most of the parenting over there. Grandpa was silent, but Grandma apologized and said they were doing their best and that they'd keep an eye out. All positive!\n\nWe'll see about follow through, but I'm feeling way better about the situation than I was before. I will continue to be friendly with Jonny, but it seems pretty clear to me that the risk of letting him hang around and be in the garage while we work out is simply not worth the reward of being one of the few stable, firm, positive adults in his daily life. I feel badly about cutting the relationship with him pretty much off, but I think it's the right move. \n\nEDIT: I wanted to address the handful of comments that said I'm the problematic neighbor for not keeping my garage closed and that I need to call CPS. To be clear, my garage is closed and locked 95% of the time. I am pretty neurotic about it, really. This was a single 30-minute window where we missed it. Hopefully, the MyQ will take care of that! \n\nI also learned from another neighbor that CPS has visited them *several* times in the last two years, but there is little fallout from it. The family is clearly on the state's radar, but Jonny is not abused, not terribly neglected, etc., and nobody in the family seems truly dangerous. I think that they would know I was the one who called, and it would create some serious animosity between us while we have to continue living side by side. That is definitely not the best path forward, I think.

{"title": "Brand new homeowners of 1 month and pissed off neighbors. Any advice? ", "selftext": "Husband and I (28F)  bought our first house and has two vacant houses beside it. One of the houses is in a family trust and occasionally around the holidays certain family members will come up (it\u2019s a small town so I\u2019ve always known this). \n\nA couple of days before the fourth there were a few vehicles there so I figured there were some people staying. Well we also had mowers literally pulling up to our house to mow before our family was coming into town. Mowers asked us to move a truck and huge enclosed trailer that was parked a few feet in our yard (after raining for a few days so ground was very wet) , turns out it was whoever was in town at the neighbors family house, and they parked IN our yard by a few feet on the other side of our house (a little drive to the other neighbors). My husband went over and asked them to move it for our mowers. He said a woman (40s) looked extremely pissed but considering they were literally parked in our yard, didn\u2019t think anything of it. They moved it. I asked around and some people have made comments that the woman he spoke with is a little emotional and just off sometimes. \n\nFast forward to the morning of the fourth and this older woman (60-70s) comes up and introduces herself to me. We played small-town small talk and I turned to introduce her to my husband, to which she got very shitty and told him he didn\u2019t leave a good impression with her daughter, who will now be living in the house. She also proceeded to tell him how they have a lot going on with a plumbing issue and that what he did didn\u2019t make anything easier on them. She recommended that we go over and apologize. We acted very confused and said that we didn\u2019t mean any offense. Thank God someone walked up, interrupted, and we walked away. I also don\u2019t know what the heck her daughter told her happened? The older woman said my husband was very rude and disrespectful. \n\nWe dropped it because I honestly think it was dramatic AF. And also weird. I asked my husband if he was rude and he said he thought he was being normal and was very confused too. \n\nToday the younger woman from the day we asked them to move brought some treats over with a note that said that we didn\u2019t get a very good start, but hopes we enjoy the treats. No apology, but it was nice. \n\nI am planning to go over and thank her probably tomorrow. I am just not sure what to expect about the whole truck situation. I don\u2019t really feel we have anything to apologize for, and I\u2019m honestly shocked that they made it into something so big. Any advice? This is our first house and I\u2019m not sure. \n\nETA- thank you all for the replies! I\u2019ll take something over tomorrow and if it comes up, I will try to smooth it over and apologize if it\u2019s obviously wanted. \n\nALSO all of you saying not to eat the treats is cracking me up. My husband said the same and said we had to throw them away but will still go be nice. I never even thought about throwing them away, but we definitely did.

All of our properties share the same address (with different unit letters), so it was an honest mistake likely caused by bad info from Google Maps.\n\nMy wife noticed them on our Nest camera and, with help from a Spanish-speaking coworker translating for her, was able to instruct the driver to go to the correct house. He argued a bit but eventually got the hint and left.\n\nOn his way out, he backed the delivery truck over a water line (a PVC hose bib) and broke it clean off. To make things worse, instead of pulling forward to correct his path and exiting the driveway properly, he decided to just drive forward through my front lawn\u2014which also happens to be my septic drain field. Tire marks were left in the grass, and water was visibly running down my driveway.\n\nMy mother-in-law happened to drive by shortly after and saw the damage. We were able to get my father-in-law to come shut off the water to prevent excess usage.\n\nI immediately contacted Lowe\u2019s to file a claim and was assured I\u2019d hear back from the claims department within 72 hours. That was on **February 24**.\n\nI\u2019ll skip over the countless follow-up calls that led nowhere\u2014just being transferred from one department to another with no help.\n\n**Finally, yesterday (April 3)**, I went on a mission: I kept calling until someone actually helped. After four calls and two hours, I finally got a claims agent assigned to me, with a promise that things would be resolved within seven days.\n\n[Here's where it gets Weird.](https://imgur.com/a/uHyLJeZ)\n\nThis morning, as I was arriving at work, I received a series of texts *from the delivery driver himself*. He apologized and said that even though these are hard economic times, he wants to take full responsibility and reach a \"fair agreement\" with me.\n\nUhhh\u2026 shouldn\u2019t this be handled by Lowe\u2019s or their insurance?

{"title": "Neighbors driving ATVs through our lawn and using our driveway to backup this semi truck", "selftext": "We bought our house about a year ago, and never had problems up until the neighbor kids across the street started driving their bikes and ATVs through our lawn. They use the lawn between our house and our next door neighbors house to get to an alleyway street behind our house. Their ATVs and bikes have messed up our lawn throughout the summer. We have told them numerous times to not go through our yard, but they ignore us or tell us their parents said they can. We talked our neighbors, and they told us Dad we can't tell their kids to not go on the lawn since it's HOA. We showed them a map with our property lines which the HOA clearly don't own. They got super hostile and didn't get anywhere with them. So us and our nextdoor neighbor decided to put a barrier so the kids can't go through our lawn anymore. I guess this pissed off our neighbors because now he uses our driveway to backup his semi into his driveway. Also they use our driveway to back up their sedan and pick up truck. We have a ring camera for the front of our house so we know whenever somebody is in our driveway. We have noticed that when they are in our driveway they pull up very close to our house.

It is a huge heavy truck and I don't want to have to deal with our driveway possibly getting cracked and damaged due to the continuous use of this semi on our driveway.

{"title": "A neighbor tore down and built a fence with less than 12 hours' notice, the new fence is over the property line. How serious is this? Can I take any action against this?", "selftext": "Looking for advice on a recent property development regarding my neighbor's installation of a new fence.\n\nTwo nights ago, my neighbor informed me, with less than 24 hours' notice, of his intention to install a new fence. I responded that I needed to talk to my Fiancee first as it was last-minute. I responded in text with my concerns; financial, permits, and designs. After the completion of the fence, it appears that the fence extends slightly over the property line. I reached out to our Alderperson to confirm that no permits were needed for the fence, it has been clarified that one is needed for a fence above 5 feet.\n\nHow much of a concern is encroachment of property? Do I have any actionable recourse in this situation? I'm not particularly against the fence being built - my primary concerns revolve around how this was all undertaken and whether the property line has been inadvertently crossed.\n\nTIA, please let me know if this is in the wrong subreddit or if i should X-post it to another.\n\n  \n***Update***: \n\nSo, after I consulted with my social network (real estate attorney, alderman, and everyone else) I decided it was best to start by texting my neighbor regarding the property line, and open the discussion. He explained to me that he believed the new fence was properly placed and he had 8 inches of wiggle room from the wooden fence, as 'the old property owners' explained to him that the fence was on his property by said amount, so he moved it to where he thought the fence should be. He politely asked for a few weeks to get a survey done, which I agreed with. I retorted by explaining that my Property Survey was done 8 months ago and should be valid as our Real Estate Attorney explained they are valid for 2 years. And showed him my survey and measurements.\n\nHe responded with wanting to find the actual boundaries as where I measured was from where the old Wooden Fence was placed, and believes it to be wrong, however is open to the idea of moving the fence if the fence is over the property line. After speaking to his real estate attorney, he was recommended to find the 'property markers' ([https://imgur.com/a/v0z8dBC](https://imgur.com/a/v0z8dBC))  which would be an 'X' or a 'Cross' on the ground,  which would show the property line. He sent me a photo of the one in the front of the house called me to explain his findings, and said 'If you follow that line, it follows the fence'\n\nThe next morning when I got home, I went to the front yard and found the markers, I thought about it for a minute and thought to myself 'If they placed these in the front, they probably placed them in the back too'. Sure as shit - I found the property markers, the fence is off the property line by a few inches. I texted him my findings, and he agreed to move the fence on Monday. I know it sucks and seems \"petty\" but by being 'only a few inches' but in Chicago, we don't get much room to begin with. I decided to keep the old Wooden fence and make a bench for my old property owner it turns out he installed the wooden fence over 25 years ago, and he is still good friends with my neighbor on the West side.

Out of pure luck, I caught him from my office window heading back to his car and I flagged him down before he could leave.\n\nThis is where it gets tricky imo - while the drywall repair itself was a small isolated area, I wanted my contractor to skim coat the whole room to ensure there is a smooth texture that matches all around and there are no seams. The inspector is convinced that I\u2019m not only replacing ALL of my drywall, he\u2019s accusing me of trying to build a multi-family dwelling and slapped me with an unsafe structure violation. He cited that one of my bathroom windows in the back still has a manufacturer sticker, therefore I MUST be trying to divide up my house. \n\nHe mentioned that the home has a history of unpermitted work and that I need to get an inspection of the interior to identify any and all areas that need to be changed. I\u2019ve only had this home for a year, I\u2019ve checked all the permits for big stuff like electrical and plumbing - everything came out clear. I definitely don\u2019t want this man coming into my home and finding reasons for additional violations that have nothing to do with my leak repair, but he seems so convinced that I\u2019m trying to do a ton of illegal work.\n\nWhat can I do?

{"title": "Today I Learned that some refrigerators have automatic filter bypasses!", "selftext": "One of the great things about home ownership is the never ending supply of opportunities to feel like an idiot. Doesn't matter what your career, skill set, life experience, etc., at some point, you'll be the fool. Today it was me.\n\nWe bought a nice new LG refrigerator around two years ago. It has automatic ice and a water dispenser, which means it also has an internal water filter that you're supposed to change every six months or so. This is nothing new, our old fridge had a similar setup, and I was used to changing those filters. I've changed filters for my parents, etc. Not my first fridge filter rodeo if you will.\n\nSo for the past couple years I've been dutifully pulling the old filters and putting in new ones, following the kinda vague but seemingly very straight forward manufacturer's instructions. Essentially, unscrew the old filter, screw in the new filter, flush a couple gallons of water.\n\nWell, it was time for the filter changing ceremony again today, but when I pulled the old filter it felt... really light. Used filters usually have a little weight to them because they're water logged. This was odd, but I set it aside, popped in the new filter and flushed the line for awhile. But this too seemed off. Usually new filters have air in them, which means when you first flush the line it spits and farts at you for a while. That didn't happen here. It's also pretty normal to see a bunch of loose carbon wash out at the same time, turning the water black. This was also notably absent.\n\nThoroughly confused now, I started to get that \"ya done screwed up\" vibe we homeowners feel from time to time. I tried reseating the new filter again for good measure, but no joy. We had to go deeper.\n\nNow, as a science minded homeowner, I also own a variety of power tools that afford me the opportunity to study stuff that piques my curiosity. After a short visit to my saw collection I had the top off the old filter, and low and behold, that sucker was bone dry. It hadn't been filtering squat. Was the filter defective? The plot thickens.\n\nBack at the refrigerator, another experiment was in order. I pulled the new filter completely, leaving the compartment open, and hit the water dispenser again. Now normally, I would expect this to either produce nothing, or result in a small flood from the open filter connection. To my surprise, neither of these happened. The water flowed uninterrupted! Has my refrigerator been plumbed wrong this whole time? How is this possible?\n\nWell, everything I know about home improvement I learned from the internet, so off I went to Google the situation. And this is where, ladies and gentlemen, I discovered the concept of the automatic filter bypass. \n\nFilter bypasses are not a new thing. Some people don't want to install expensive water filters, so a bypass simply bridges the in and out and allows the water to flow through the line uninterrupted. But traditionally, the filter bypass was a physical *thing* that one would install, intentionally, in place of the filter. An *automatic* bypass, as I now know, does all this *automatically.* You pull the old filter, you don't replace it, and the fridge just goes right on about its business supplying water from the line as if nothing happened.\n\nThe only problem with this convenience feature is that it does assume that the user is competent enough to realize whether or not they've *successfully* connected their *really expensive* water filters. Because no matter what, water's just going to keep coming out like you'd expect it to. And in my case, despite following the instructions, carefully screwing each filter into position, checking for leaks, etc, I totally failed the test. Continuously. For like, a couple years.\n\nAfter several more attempts I managed to manhandle the new filter into its true correct position. Apparently I wasn't being nearly aggressive enough with it to seat it fully. At last, flushing the line produced the gurgling, carbon-laden farts one expects from a newly installed filter. And the water even tastes a bit better too. The filters weren't defective, I was.

{"title": "Update: Feels as if my new home is poisoning me", "selftext": "Dear fellow Redditors, here is the update to this post I made this past summer that none of you asked for: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/s/DlP4IDZkEz\n\nBased on the recommendations I got from Reddit, I did indeed get an air quality test. The test showed a high amount of mold in the air but no visible mold anywhere. The team doing the test searched high and low but could not find the source of mold. They theorized since the home was empty for months before I purchased it, perhaps the lack of airflow circulating and other factors caused mold to grow inside the walls or underneath the flooring. They suggested I do a deep cleaning of all surfaces in the home, use a dehumidifier and an air purifier and see if my respiratory symptoms improve. Spoiler: they did not.\n\nI then had 3 different mold remediation companies come out and do inspections. All 3 said my living room walls were reading wet and the mold was likely inside my wall but they could not confirm until they opened it up and looked for themselves. However, mold remediation does not include rebuilding walls deconstructed from an assessment, and I didn\u2019t want an open wall releasing even more mold into my lungs all day, so I had them hold off.\n\nThen Florida was hit with back to back hurricanes and my home sustained minor flooding, so I got to see where my leaks were coming from: my living room and bedroom windows and one of the family room walls. Insurance was of course worthless, FEMA declined to assist as expected but I did get an SBA loan to take care of this once and for all.\n\nIn the meantime, for some strange reason, the cooler temperatures since late November have almost mitigated the poor air quality in my home. I still use an air purifier daily, occasionally wear a KN95 mask or use albuterol and have my AC fan running when I\u2019m home, but it\u2019s significantly better than in the summer time when I could not breathe for hours at a time.

{"title": "New neighbor hates us and our fence!", "selftext": "My partner and I are a much younger couple than most in our neighborhood - most neighbors are retired and have lived here for >15 years. We have a pretty eye-catching backyard (previous owner was a hell of a gardener). Neighbors have told us how much they enjoy looking at it, which I understand. But hey, we have a pet, are building a sauna, and most importantly it's our home and our neighbors aren't paying our mortgage, you know?\n\nWhen we bought the house and started renovating, we asked our next door neighbors about building a privacy fence and they both said it was fine. However, now that it's in, one of the neighbors freaked out via text - \"actually, no one with property touching yours or in view of your yard is happy about this fence.\" She said she's more upset about us \"building a hot tub\" and that loud music, loud voices, and partying will make spending time in her yard not enjoyable. Dear reader, there is no hot tub being built, and we have not thrown any parties - we have have lived here for...two weeks. I can think of some days when we have had a couple friends over to help with yardwork/painting/other DIY stuff, but each time it was on a weekend, during the day, and we weren't playing any music, yelling, or anything like that.\n\nI acknowledge that the construction/remodeling is a nuisance, but...that stuff happens! Her saying that we're too loud for her to enjoy being outside sounds like she's either judged us as annoying kids, or that us just doing normal life is too loud for her. In either situation, it seems unreasonable. Honestly, now that she's told me that people are allegedly paying close enough attention to my yard to be upset, it kinda makes me want to fence it even more. I have a feeling she's exaggerating, but it still sucks to think that within two weeks of our arrival we've pissed off the whole block.\n\nMy first-time homeowner question is - do we just ignore it, reassure her that we aren't party animals, and hope she settles down? Is it just a rite of passage to have a grumpy neighbor who you can't please? Should we take any steps to try to smooth things over, with her or anyone else on the block?

It's an extremely exposed area in a wind tunnel. Our houses are maybe 15' apart, and the wind chimes are right at the edge of my property maybe 20' from my bedroom window. I also work from home and the wind chimes are maybe 15' from my office window. I can hear the wind chimes while i'm in my own house with the windows and doors closed in every room of my house.\n\nI've lived here for 3 years and they put the wind chimes up at some point. They have annoyed me but I do love my neighbors and so I never said anything. But now my boss has made a comment about hearing it in the background while I was giving a presentation and now I need to record a number of other presentations and I'm worried they are going to be audible.\n\nI have asked if they could take the wind chimes down and one of them said that the wind chimes were a memorial to her dead parents, so then i felt like an asshole, but I asked if they could move the wind chimes to their front porch away from my bedroom. She said no and suggested I get noise cancelling head phones. I told her this is not just about work - I also can't sleep because they're so loud especially when it's windy, and they really stress me out and are giving me migraines. I asked if they could get some quieter wind chimes or muffle them somehow and she said no because they bring her so much joy and she wasn't willing to take them down. As a \"compromise\" they moved one of the wind chimes to the other side of the balcony maybe 10' over, moved another to their front porch and replaced that one with a \"quieter\" one, and with the addition of the chime on their front porch, there is the same amount of wind chimes next to my bedroom and now one more at the front of their house.\n\nIt's not quieter.

{"title": "Little Quality of Life Improvements That Make a Big Difference", "selftext": "After viewing lots of homes, I've noticed a few quality-of-life improvements. I just wanted to share a few that I've found in case it helps any of you. If anyone has some they'd like to add, that'd be awesome :) \n\n- Sound-Proofing Key Walls like bedrooms next to utility/furnace rooms, or in stacked washer/dryer closets to prevent noise from travelling. (Edit: bad choice of words on my part as you can't fully sound-proof but there is Acoustic spray foam, insulation, extra drywall or something like acoustipaint) \n\n- Solid core (as opposed to hollow core doors) to further reduce noise travel. Combine this with a bit of silicone around the frame to prevent noise when slamming, and door seal strips (especially if the door sits too high) to prevent dust travel. (Edit: Don't seal doors entirely as explained by [this comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/m19u0f/little_quality_of_life_improvements_that_make_a/gqcks2h?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)) \n\n- Instead of closets, consider if a IKEA PAX wardrobe solution built into the wall might be better. You could save yourself about a foot of space or more and have a more organized space for storing your clothes and all. The space savings are significant in smaller rooms.\n\n- Avoid cheap plastic registers, a lot of them tend to be quite noisy when the furnace or fan is running.\n\n- If you're buying a tall home with a furnace in the bottom corner of your home, get some dampers installed in your ducts so you can control the airflow as some rooms will get much hotter than others.\n\n- Having your furnace off to one corner with a narrowly sufficient plumbing system may also lead to water taking longer to warm up.

Today, got a call and told a huge tree fell on it during a storm last night.", "selftext": "I'm currently at the laughing (and pissing my wife off because of this) stage at this point. Bought our first home and closed 10 days ago. We have a place to stay currently and have been going to the new house daily to do some work that is easier done before we officially move in (painting some rooms, lacing in/repairing hardwood in a room and refinishing the hardwoods there and in the kitchen. \n\nAnyhow, 2 days ago, we were there and we had some really crazy storms, no real issues with any of the mature trees that were around (more on this in a minute). \n\nWe left early yesterday because there were more storms predicted, but this time at night, and we'd rather not drive the hour from new house to current house where we are living in blinding storms. \n\nWas going to go back today, but decided to take a day off as we had been working a ton over the past week. Everything was going fine and then I got a text from the listing agent. I had texted him back and forth a few times prior, but had never talked to him (as I used a buyers agent). His text was simply \"EXTREMELY URGENT, PLEASE CALL\". Umm, the situation where you get a message like this from a listing agent in a different city at 8:30PM at night is never good. Instant anxiety going on. \n\nI honestly thought he was going to tell me the house was on fire. I called him up and he is all out of breath and in between \"OMG's, Oh Shits, Holy Fu-ks, etc.\" he proceed to tell me that a neighbor had called him because they didn't have my information. Said they heard some noises and thought something happened at the house. Yep, something did happen. A huge ass (tall) oak was blown over in those severe storms that came through last night. Crashed right down onto literally the best (and newest) part of the 1941 colonial - a huge family room addition that is mostly all windows and literally the single WOW factor that pushed us to buying. According to his reaction, it is really bad. \n\nI haven't been out to see it yet. It was already dark, not supposed to rain for a few days, and i'd have to drive an hour there...might as well wait till first thing in the morning. That being said, I don't know this guy enough to gauge his reaction. Some people tend to over-react plus it was dark so it could still be not as bad, as bad, or even worse that he saw. Though he did say he was in the family room walking around and there was no penetration though the ceiling that he saw (though the tree didn't have many branches). \n\nNo pics yet, but will post an update with some tomorrow. Just needed to vent a little bit and, for lack of anything more productive to do, be in awe at how seemingly unlucky this was. 80 years this house has been standing here and far as I know never been hit by any tree and it gets a tree falling on it 10 days after I close on it. My insurance company is going to love me. \n\nEDIT: Oh, about the trees. So this is in a very well established, wooded subdivision with lots of mature trees, mainly oaks. There is a record of a certified arborist who came and identified all the problem trees. There were about 8 trees total that the P.O. had cut down. This was about 2 years ago. I understand a lot can change in 2 years, but there was no reason for me to think there was any pending disasters with the trees. \n\nIn any event, this freaking sucks ass. I have been through worse in my life and I do realize I am very thankful that my family nor I were actually there and thankful that it, according to the agent, didn't hit the primary house. My wife and young daughter are really upset/sad about it though. Not only that, I will now basically have to cut down any tree within striking distance of the house for them to feel safe in it and to also avoid that dreaded 2nd claim on H.O. insurance within the next 5 years. I have no clue where I will get the money to cut the probably 10 trees down at the moment...I mean, I just bought a house...I didn't spend all of our money on it, but that period of time shortly after buying a house isn't the most cash flush time for most people..\n\nEDIT: Well, I've been super busy all day with dealing with this, so sorry no pics yet. I have pics, just no time to upload them yet. I will tonight though. \n\nI also have a very interesting development I'll share as well....spoiler...it has to do with cwrtina known things not being disclosed during the home sale.\n\nEDIT 2: Updated post, with pictures, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/mqjpej/update_wpictures_tree_fell_on_home_less_than_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/mp73oc/closed_on_my_first_home_10_days_ago_today_got_a/", "created_utc": 1618203176.0, "score": 416, "author": "None", "num_comments": 105, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/mp73oc/closed_on_my_first_home_10_days_ago_today_got_a/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

One day after we found it in the bin, we went over and talked to his mother in law (we didn't know who it was), and asked them to ask the kid to stop once more, and even asked that they tell the kid to clean our trash to get rid of the poop smell.\n\nHe recently did it AGAIN, and we sent him a text with video proof of the kid doing it, and asked him again to have the kid stop and explained why we don't like it(The kid left it untied this time). His response: \"I recommend you take your trash bins earlier to avoid this, also it's a trash can so I will not clean it. Furthermore you will not talk to my mother in law moving forward, if you have an issue come to me\" and pointed out how we let our dog poop in other people's yard (even though we clean it up after), and said \"I would recommend you keep your dogs shit in your trash, and we will do the same\". Like???? I haven't had issues with this guy before and now he wants to be like this to us for asking him to tell his worker to put his dog poop in his own trash and not ours.\n\nI have refrained from even replying to this dude to stop a feud from happening, and will complain to the HOA, but if it happens again would I be right to return it to his porch or in the bed of his truck?

{"title": "In Praise of Mediocre Counter Tops.", "selftext": "We recently bought our first house after selling our condo. Condo was only 7 years old, brand new appliances, beautifil cabinets, floor, and an exquisite dark green granite countertop. It really shone, though we always had to be careful about moisture, how we cleaned it, scratching, etc. \n\nOur new house is morenlike 37 years old. Not quite a fixer upper, but I did spend a week here before my pregnant wife moved in cleaning the place, washing the walls and floors and deep cleaning, painting, and getting it ready to move in to. \n\nOne thing I was a bit bummed about were the very basic counter tops in the kitchen. Im not sure what material you'd call it, but its.like the hard top youd see in a hospital cafeteria or.sometbing. Pretty basic, no frills, etc. I found myself missing the elegance and shine of the granite. \n\nWell, we just had our first baby (a beautiful baby girl and the main reason we needed to increase our space from a 1 bedroom) and let me just say, I fuckint love these countertops. Baby is only 5 days old and my wife and I thought we were prepared for the sleep deprivation. We were not prepared. Its been constant, and my wife is amazingly strong but she's exhausted, always something to do, baby crying, etc. \n\nThese shitty counter tops are a dream. I can use lysol if there's gross stuff, wipe them down with a wet rag, don't care if they get a little scratched- though they're remarkably tough- and with all the new baby action, caring for higher end counter tops is the last thing id want to do. \n\nSo to anyone who maybe is a little bummed about those ugly old things thwt don't require any special cleaning, its remarkable how much of a releif it is when you can clean them with anything, don't have to worry about chips and scratches, and dont mind spilling formula or getting poop on them and washing them up with a lysol wipe lol. \n\nJust wanted to share that shift in perspective here, since I am sure many people have looked at their new counter tops in an older house with a modicum of disdain.

I am trying to save you from the pain and anguish that comes from buying furniture from this place. I wish someone had warned us earlier. The customer service is non-existent. If there is a mistake on your furniture order, and trust me they will sometimes deliver the wrong furniture to your house, it will take them months and months to fix the issue. You can try to escalate it to hire ups but that will get you nowhere because they will ignore your emails and phone calls. Their delivery drivers never come on time or they come earlier or later than expected and then they will make you reschedule to have it be delivered at another date. Sometimes the delivery drivers don't show up at all. That happened to us three times so far. \nI will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau, my local consumer protection office, and The Federal Trade Commission. \nWe've waited months and months for a single chair to be delivered. It has yet to show up. They will also claim that they can't find any of your paperwork. Another fun thing that they try to do is put you in the middle between the actual store location employees and the escalation department with both of them saying that they can't do anything to help you or that once you reached escalation you cannot go any further up in management from there to complain about anything or find a resolution to your issue. So this really leaves you stuck with no solution. They'll do this to you for a while just to stall time hoping that you eventually just give up. They keep you on hold forever if you're calling about a problem, they don't return calls and they don't respond to any of your emails.

{"title": "Something to watch for when buying a house that has all new appliances", "selftext": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWe just bought a house that included a new set of matching stainless steel Whirlpool appliances. It wasn\u2019t really something that sealed the deal on us buying the house, but it was an added bonus. So we moved in, unpacked, lived life for a couple weeks, and then we started noticing that the food in the refrigerator was freezing food. \n\nWe messed around with temperature settings, defrosted it and plugged it back in, and eventually called Whirlpool to see if they had any ideas. They were nice enough and fast to answer, but they asked me for my model and serial number, and I didn\u2019t see it anywhere. It\u2019s apparently supposed to be up at the top right of the inside wall, but it wasn\u2019t. Someone had peeled off the sticker with it on. There aren\u2019t any other places that it\u2019s shown on the appliance, either, and they said they couldn\u2019t help without that.\n\nI asked my real estate agent to see if she could contact the seller (his sister was his agent and she works in the same office as our agent) to see if he knew anything about it. Turns out on the disclosure, our rose-colored glasses misread the phrase \u201cpurchased in 2/19\u201d as \u201cpurchased \u2018new\u2019 in 2/19.\u201d He bought them from a scratch-and-dent appliance outlet from a sketch part of town who conveniently holds all their sales as final. \n\nSo since we couldn\u2019t return it or have whirlpool come look at it, we called a local appliance repairman to come look at it. He informed us that they only remove the serial sticker if something has been looked at more than 3 times by different repairmen without them being able to fix the problem. He said the problem was that the motherboard was not telling the vapor control system to turn off, thus venting too much cold air from the freezer into the fridge and freezing everything. It would apparently be about $500-550 to fix it. \n\nWe\u2019re buying a new one since this one wasn\u2019t really the style we wanted, and something else is probably wrong with it as well. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t call this a horror story by any means, as refrigerators aren\u2019t over $5k (at least not the ones we\u2019re looking at), but for those of you still looking at houses, take a peak in the top right front corner of the fridge and see if the sticker is still there. If it is, cool, but if not, maybe see if the seller can cover some closing costs. \n\nTL;DR Check for the serial numbers on your \u201cnew\u201d appliances when you\u2019re looking at houses. If they\u2019ve been removed, it has been looked at by at least 3 repairmen who couldn\u2019t find what was wrong with it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/c58s5h/something_to_watch_for_when_buying_a_house_that/", "created_utc": 1561470317.0, "score": 395, "author": "ButtSmashMagoo", "num_comments": 49, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/c58s5h/something_to_watch_for_when_buying_a_house_that/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "I knew these neighbors would not like our new fence, but wow\u2026", "selftext": "TL/DR: has anybody run into this issue before, installed a fence because of neighbors basically trespassing, etc. Then those neighbors give you the cold shoulder, to say the least. What did you do, if anything, to try to repair your neighbors relations? \n\nI don\u2019t know why this is bugging me. But it is\u2026. We\u2019ve had issues with neighbors on both sides of our house. The neighbors on both sides frequently let their dogs run loose, coming into our yard and pooping and peeing. The one dog pretty much ruined the bush we had on the corner of our house. That bush was there for many years until the dog decided to use it as a bathroom, killing it. Just lots of issues, we ended up installing a fence between both sides of our house, along the property line. They were aleays acting entitled, thinking our land was their land, taking liberties, things like that. The big kicker for me was the family to the right of us, them letting their kid use our driveway, when I pulled into my driveway one night, the kid darted from behind a bush of theirs that is right next to our driveway, he nearly ran right into my vehicle, luckily I was able to stop. I spoke to both of the kid and the mom about it, and the mom basically said,  kids will be kids..\u2026.That was basically a big sticking point for me. Plus, I spoke to both neighbors on both sides before about the issues, and they continued to do what they were doing. So, like I said, many other issues, that basically we were left no choice to put up a fence. So now, the neighbors on both sides of our house, clearly don\u2019t like that we put up the fence. Cold shoulder, to say the least. I mean, it sucks, because you wanna at least be cordial with your neighbors, but that probably is not gonna happen. I mean, especially if there\u2019s an emergency, it\u2019s good to be on good terms with your neighbors.  But they\u2019ve all been very frosty since we put up the fence. For example, the dad of the kid basically did a stare done with me a couple months ago, talk about evil eyes and looks that kill\u2026\u2026 Then, the other day, the mom and dad of the kid were sitting outside, they sort of made a purpose point of facing their lawn chairs away from my house, looked like they did it deliberately, to not even look at me, they knew I was outside doing yardwork\u2026\u2026 So with their position, they were basically staring right up at their garage and some ugly old pine trees, lol\u2026\u2026  So, it makes being outside very awkward when we\u2019re all outside at the same time, to say the least. I know, I just ignore them. But wow\u2026. I guess there\u2019s really nothing I can do at this point. Just kind of venting, I guess\u2026 Has anybody run into a similar situation\u2026? It sucks that something like this has created such frosty relations with the neighbors (though I guess maybe not surprising), but sometimes you have no choice, but to put up a fence to protect yourself and your property\u2026 It does suck, because both neighbors on both sides of our house was at least cordial before, now they clearly make a point of pretty much going out of their way, avoiding me\u2026 (when I say \u2018our house,\u2019 it\u2019s the old family homestead left to my brother and I, he lives in his own house an hour away, I live here).

I just need to get it off my chest.\n\nWe moved to our current home in 2020. We are a couple in ours 30\u2019s, married, no kids, 3 dogs. When we first moved, I hated it here. Our house had sold in 6 hours and we had nowhere to go. Our realtor was a bum. I actually found this listing. After several failed bids, my husband was getting panicky. His job was also super busy at the time, so I had to take the lead and find somewhere for us to live.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, we are extremely fortunate. But we didn\u2019t plan on being here as long as we have been and with interest rates out of control, there really no end in sight. It\u2019s a 2 story house. Main level walk in is a small living room, bathroom, laundry and my office. Our massive flight of curved stairs to the second story (main living room, kitchen, bedrooms, bathroom) takes a huge toll on us. Think about carrying 15 bags of groceries up a painful flight of stairs- it\u2019s not fun. \n\nI work from home- but again. My office being downstairs and literally even to get a glass of water being upstairs\u2026 I\u2019m tired of running these damn things 25 times a day. I\u2019ve found ways to make less trips, but inevitably, it still happens.\n\n\nWe are investing a massive amount of money in a deck replacement project in a couple of weeks. It boils my blood, but it has to be done. We\u2019ve updated water heater, put in soft water, electrical, paint, yard work, shed, mulch, toilet, our windows are shot and main bathtub is garbage.our property taxes are absurd. Utilities are insane.\n\nWe are trying so hard. I\u2019m so tired. Our intention was to get a small, 1 level home with a little land.\n\nAfter Covid calmed down and we had time to adjust, I really tried changing my attitude and having positive intentions. I\u2019ve tried connecting more with the community. Helping out with the dog park, meeting neighbors. But it\u2019s clear since we aren\u2019t \u201cfrom\u201d here we aren\u2019t welcome. \n\nThere was a huge confrontation yesterday when someone from the cable company decided to help themselves inside of our privacy fence without asking or permission. We\u2019ve had contractors and lawn care this whole time and it\u2019s never been an issue- but the fiber optic install in our town has raised some big issues (lack of communication). \n\nWe got back from a beautiful week long camping trip, and came home to chaos and just more crap. I\u2019m so done. I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s so awful here and there\u2019s not a damn thing we can do about it. \n\nThanks for just letting me vent. Sorry for being a bummer.\n\nEdit to add: THANK YOU all for the kind responses. Things kind of came to a head today for a multitude of reasons - this post has so many great responses and suggestions.

{"title": "Neighboring land owner will not respect property lines", "selftext": "I live in a wooded neighborhood. Behind one row of houses is what used to be wide wooded area. Last year someone in town bought it up and started cutting all the trees down to sell lumber. The problem is that he won\u2019t respect our property lines. Mine or my neighbors. \n\nHe keeps entering our land and marking our trees with tape and spray paint. He removes any markings we put up, including POSTED signs, ribbons, wooden stakes, and even the metal property pins! He hasn\u2019t been seen or caught on camera, so we\u2019re not sure when he\u2019s coming around and doing this (hard to see back to the edge of the property from the house). Many of us have made police reports.\n\nHe\u2019s also cut trees on my property, which he still contends is his (I have the neighborhood diagram from county records, even if the pin is \u201cmissing,\u201d I can still measure my land!) He actually had the audacity to accuse me of moving the pins! We had an official survey done, everything was marked, and HE TOOK EVERYTHING DOWN. \n\nSo far police have done nothing but file reports, because none of the neighbors can prove he was the one trespassing and taking down our markings. But who else could it be??\n\nWe also can\u2019t verify the guy\u2019s address to send him any kind of demand letter that he stay away. \n\nI\u2019m at my wits end. Anyone dealt with something like this? How do I keep this man off my land and away from my trees? How do I go about suing him for the trees he cut that were mine? This whole thing is ridiculous and I might have let a couple accidental cuttings go, but this man will not stay off my land! Also, isn\u2019t removing property pins a crime?? How do I nail this guy without actually catching him in the act? Other neighbors have put up cameras, but no one has seen anything. He appears to know how to evade them, or maybe he\u2019s been coming at night. I don\u2019t know. \n\nAny advice?\n\nEDIT: This got way more responses than I expected and I\u2019m overwhelmed! So I\u2019m going to try and address some of the questions I\u2019ve seen popping up.\nThe cutting started last year. He hired a lumber company and they came in with huge vehicles and teams of workers with chainsaws. I don\u2019t remember how big his property is, but it\u2019s dozens if not hundreds of acres. My neighbors and I each own maybe 2 acres a piece, give or take. It\u2019s not like we have a ton of land, so this was happening practically in our backyards. \nLumber company assured us last year that they knew where the property lines were, and they weren\u2019t keen to get in trouble for improper cutting. We were stupid to believe them, as it turns out. \nMissing pins is actually what prompted the official surveys many of us had done, because as it started warming up this past month, we noticed trees in our yards tagged with ribbons and spray paint. When we walked out to check on this, that\u2019s when we discovered that some of our trees had been cut in the back of the property. At that point, some neighbors installed cameras (he hasn\u2019t been caught by anyone yet). After a survey confirmed he\u2019d cut our trees and marked others on our land, that\u2019s when he removed the official markings and accused me of moving the original pin (that had been \u201cmissing\u201d) because he thinks part of my land is his. He didn\u2019t agree with the survey, so he took the stuff down. This happened to mine and others property, but as I said\u2026 no one has caught him on camera. \nThe cutting last year stopped for the winter, and we expect it will resume soon now that\u2019s it\u2019s warming up again. Which is why we think he\u2019s encroaching on our land and marking more trees to be cut. \nThis is in Pennsylvania.\nI ordered trail cams as some of you suggested. They arrive tomorrow. \nI can\u2019t trap my property, as I have kids. \nThe property owner is a retired mechanic. He bought the land for his adult children, and technically their names are on the deed, but he\u2019s overseeing the cutting and the one marking our trees. We know this because one of the neighbors is friends with his son. I don\u2019t know why his adult children won\u2019t talk to him about what he\u2019s doing or interfere at all; it seems like they just don\u2019t want anything to do with it (I think they just want the money from the lumber). Anyway, that\u2019s why no one knows his address, so we can\u2019t send letters.\n\nUPDATE: The neighbors are meeting up soon to discuss hiring a lawyer and tackling him together. We might even agree to build a fence along the backside of all our properties. It\u2019s all going to be discussed. \nThanks to everyone who commented helpful advice.

Vacuum out your window sills.  The dust and crud that accumulated over the summer can block drainage holes and cause water issues, so before it gets too cold, fire up the vac, grab a cheap brush and clean your windows.\n\n- vehicle maintenance, do it now before its cold and miserable out, who cares if your a few miles early for your oil change, easier to do it before its frozen.\n\n- emergency supplies.

Here's a list of data points with all the homes we toured, what we offered, and what they sold for.", "selftext": "I posted this the other day in /r/RealEstate, but figured some here might find the information useful. \n\nFirst thing's first: oh my lord we are so relieved. We toured essentially non stop for 3 months. We are in the Los Angeles are, one of the hottest of hot markets. We specifically looked for homes in the San Gabriel Valley and Whittier areas. I'll get into the details of the deal for the home we did go for, but for now here's an *incomplete* list of all the homes we toured for, and the prices they sold for. Note: There are several exceptions, but almost all the homes we toured were *freshly* listed. We toured these homes 1-5 days after they went live on the market. There are probably 5-7 homes we did tour but I couldn't find the coronavirus entry disclosures for in my email, so I won't list them. Something to note is that most of these homes we toured were fixers. Some were \"turn key\", and none were new construction, and almost all our offers had 5% down. But anyways, here's the list, **offers are in bold**:\n\n\n10/25/2020 - Viewed duplex listed for $790,000. Was on market for over 100 days. **Offered $750,000**. Owner countered with the original price, $790 k, we moved on. It later sold for $780k about 50 days later. \n\n\n11/1/2020 Viewed another duplex. Listed for $600,000. **We offered $607,500**. It sold for $640,000. \n\n\n11/5/2020 Viewed single family home down the street from the second duplex. Listed for $658,000. **We offered $705,000, plus $15,000 if appraisal came under $705,000**. This was really frustrating, as we lost the offer, and 60+ days later it finally sold for $685,000. We\u2019re thinking the seller got greedy and chose a higher number offer, only for it to not appraise. \n\n\n 11/12/2020-11/13/2020 Viewed multiple homes: \n\n\n Home A: single family listed for $569,000. **We offered $605,000**. It sold later for $595,000 after over 2 months in escrow. We\u2019re thinking it came under appraisal because it had an unpermitted bathroom. Home was listed as a 2/2, but on paper was 2/1. \n\n\n Home B: Single family listed for $595,000. We  didn\u2019t like this home so we didn\u2019t make an offer, it sold for $655,000. \n\n\n Home C: Single family listed for $516,900. Again, we decided not to make an offer on this home. It finally went pending after 90 days on market. \n\n\n Home D: Single family listed for $645,000. Decided not to make an offer. Sold for list price after 2 months on market. \n\n\n 11/14/2020 - Single family listed for $575,000. This was an open house with a line down the block. We decided to not make an offer for various reasons. Sold for $624,000. \n\n\n 11/15/2020 Viewed multiple homes: \n\n\n Home A: Single family listed for $550,000. **We offered $605,000**. We had a good shot on getting this property, but unfortunately the owner had a lien that they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay off even if they sold the home, and the house went off market.  \n\n\n Home B: Single family listed for $559,000. We didn\u2019t make an offer. Sold for $601,000. \n\n\n 11/21/2020 Viewed multiple homes: \n\n\n Home A:  Single family listed for $599,000. We didn\u2019t make an offer, sold for $605,000. \n\n\n Home B: Single family listed for $524,900. God awful \u201csold by Redfin\u201d flip. Didn\u2019t make an offer, it sold for $586,000. \n\n\n 11/27/2020 Viewed multiple homes: \n\n\n Home A: Single family listed for $620,000. Didn\u2019t make an offer, sold for $635,000 after 2 months on market. \n\n\n Home B: Single family listed for $590,000. We didn\u2019t make an offer, but this one probably had some problems that came up under inspection. It entered and left escrow FIVE times. It finally sold a couple days ago for $625,000 after being on market for 2 months. \n\n\n**As you can probably tell, we\u2019ve toured a lot of homes by this point. We started getting into our groove and started figuring out what we liked, so more of the visits turned into offers**\n\n\n 12/1/2020 - Single family listed for $565,000. **We offered $575,000**, it sold for $600,000. \n\n\n 12/3/2020 Viewed multiple homes: \n\n\n Home A: Single family home listed for $625,000. **We offered $650,000**. It sold for $675,000. \n\n\n Home B: Single family home listed for $580,000. **We offered $605,000**. It sold for $620,000. \n\n\n 12/8/2020 - Single family listed for $589,000. This home had good bones but I didn\u2019t make an offer on this home solely on the listing agents behavior. Answered basically none of our questions and had a terrible attitude. It\u2019s still on the market after 2 months. \n\n\n 12/12/2020 -  Single family listed for $575,000. It was a great home, but it was on the intersection of two main streets. The noise outside was terrible. It\u2019s currently pending. \n\n\n 12/13/2020 viewed multiple homes: \n\n\n Home A: Single Family owned by Zillow listed for $638,000. This home had foundation damage and a weird layout. The home had sold just one month prior in November 2020 for $605,000. We didn\u2019t make an offer on it due to the problems listed, but it sold for $695,000. Shows you the insanity of this market.  \n\n\n Home B: Single family listed for $750,000. This was a special one. The home was the top of our price range but we really liked the home. **We offered exactly list price at $750,000,** as they had just lowered the price by $25,000 from $775,000. The home was on the market for 2 weeks at this point. We thought we had a good chance, and the listing agent even gave us a counter offer. We sent another counter back, and we got ghosted\u2026 Our realtor kept following up, but the listing agent acted like we didn\u2019t exist or sent messages like \u201cwhich offer were you again\u201d? Completely unprofessional behavior, and on further investigation, the agent\u2019s parent company had been in several lawsuits for shady behavior. It eventually sold a month later for $775,000. \n\n\n Home C: Single family listed for $690,000. We were going to make an offer on this home, but it was taken off market. \n\n\n 12/14/2020: Single family listed for $700,000. We absolutely loved this home. Comps were really good, and **we submitted an offer for $750,000 with 15k appraisal gap and <21 day closing window**. Owners act like they don\u2019t care about this property? They\u2019re located out of state and took 2 weeks to review the offers. Our offer was rejected, but home is still on the market. \n\n\n 12/18/2020: Viewed multiple homes: \n\n\n Home A: Single family listed at 758,000. We thought it was overpriced (terrible flip), so we didn\u2019t make an offer. It went pending after a month. \n\n\n Home B: Really cute single family listed at 525,000. We thought the house was adorable, but unfortunately too small for our purposes. It went pending after a month.\n\n\n Home C: Single family listed for $585,000. **We offered $605,000**. Home sold for $600,000 and listing agent said they chose that offer because it had a 45% down payment. Wasn\u2019t even mad at that one. \n\n\n Home D: Single family listed for $738,888. We liked this home and **offered the top of our range. 750k, 21 day closing, 15k appraisal gap.** Didn\u2019t get it, sold for $790,000. \n\n\n Home F: Single family listed at $565,000. **Offered $575,000.** Sold for $595,000. \n\n\n Home G: single family listed at $688,888. **We offered $720,000.** It sold for $750,000. \n\n\n Home H: single family listed at $680,000. **We offered $718,000.** It went pending and fell out of escrow. It was relisted a couple days ago for $780,000. \n\n\n 12/22/2020 Viewed multiple homes: \n\n Home A: single family listed for $750,000. **We offered $750,000** since it was the top of our range. It sold for $803,000.  \n\n\n Home B: single family listed for $750,000. **We offered $750,000** (top of our range), it sold for $800,000. \n\nHome C: Single family listed for $620,000. **We offered $610,000** and after a bit of back and forth **THIS IS THE HOME WE GOT OUR OFFER ACCEPTED ON!!!** \n\n\n *WHEW*. What a roller coaster. So for context, that was **33 counted homes toured**, but probably closer to 38-40. **Offers: 17**. Acceptance: 1. I believe all homes we toured went for over list price as you can calculate above. But here\u2019s a bit more detail on the sale we eventually got: \n\n\n The home we eventually got accepted had been on the market for a bit. The listing had terrible pictures, and you had to definitely needed to tour it to appreciate, but even then it needed a lot of work. We toured many fixers, and lost offers on those fixers, but a fixer in this area is kind of unusual. People have the money to buy newer/turn key. Thankfully we were ok with taking up the work, and were able to actually get some closing costs paid for. So for those who are in the similar journey as we are, redfin offers really nice filters where you can see homes that have been on the market for over X number of days. That's how we found this one. We\u2019re really excited to move into our new home, as the journey was really exhausting.

My wife and I have 2 mopeds and a small car that all fit nicely into our parking spot. No issues. All within the lines, everything in order with HOA. Well this asshole guy next to me with his Maserati apparently feels my moped is too close to his fancy car, despite the fact it\u2019s within my parking stall lines.\n\nSo this guy decides every time he can he goes into my parking spot and physically pushes my moped further away from his spot. I have it with a wheel lock and steering wheel locked and he still manages to push the thing forward and wedge my lock inside the wheel. Every time I put it right back where it was. \n\nI have been doing this about 5-6 times now where he moved my moped and I move it right back to where it was. Last week I even left a very respectful note on my moped seat asking whoever is moving my moped to please stop doing so and the wheel is being damaged, er . Well that didn\u2019t work because next day he pushed it away from his spot again and ignored my note.\n\nI told security about my issue and they said unless I have proof they can\u2019t do anything. So I am about to buy a cheap wireless camera to catch this cunt in the act. \n\nI am not sure how to deal with this. If he ignores my nice respectful note to stop, there is no way me confronting him is going to make him stop. Plus I technically have no proof it\u2019s him. But I mean it\u2019s obviously him because who else would push my moped away from the Maserati spot beside him? I\u2019d rather not confront the guy as he lives on the same damn floor as me and the last thing I want is to feel uncomfortable leaving my own home trying to not see this guy\u2026\n\nWhat would you guys do in this situation? Buy a small spy cam and catch him doing it and report him to security and get him in trouble? At this point I\u2019m not sure what else I can do. I don\u2019t want to have to spend money on this bullshit but this guy will NOT stop touching my shit. He just feels entitled and thinks my moped is too close to his spot despite it being well within the parking stall lines.

Realized its not worth picking a fight here. But I will forever hate the maserati guy and I will never be nice to him if I ever see him. I hope he gets the worst case of food poisoning, and I wish him nothing but the worst.\n\nUPDATE 2**** I changed my mind again, camera is on order and I\u2019m not gonna let this guy walk all over me and get his way.

When I went over their kid answered and so I said I\u2019d be back in a bit when their parents are home. About 20 minutes later, one of them knocked on my door. \n\nMe- \u201c oh hey, so.. I had come over to ask if maybe there\u2019s anything you can do about your dog barking\u2026 it\u2019s pretty persistent and we\u2019ve really tried to tune it out since we moved in, but it\u2019s just become too much to simply tune out.\u201d\n\n\nShe was instantly offended and just went off on me.\n\n\u201cYou bought the house knowing there was a dog right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo but that would have had no bearing on the purchase. And if we did, we wouldn\u2019t have known about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, we really try to be the best neighbors. You know there\u2019s dogs all around here right? Are you going to go talk to everyone who has a dog?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t hear anyone else\u2019s\u2026 we would kindly ask them as well if we did.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in this house for 20 years and NEVER had anyone complain about a dog. He\u2019s inside from 11pm to 7am. He has a doggy door during the day to get out. I can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that, but we\u2019ve heard him several times after midnight and before 6am, disturbing sleep. But the main disturbance is between 6pm and 9pm when we\u2019ve gotten home from work and just want some peace but he\u2019s out there for 30-40 minutes at a time barking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe yard is fully fenced, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting into your yard. And you know what? You don\u2019t even shovel your sidewalk.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would have 0 issue with him being in our yard as long as he was quiet, I wasn\u2019t aware the sidewalk was an issue, we\u2019ll do that from now on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this your first house? I\u2019m sorry ok but not really, I have a lot more years under my belt and this is all just part of a neighborhood, there\u2019s dogs, okay? We\u2019ll have to just agree to disagree. I\u2019ll *try* to do better at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, I really appreciate that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m sure you do! /s\u201d *starts to storm off*\n\n\u201cWait please, I\u2019m really not trying to be rude or come off harsh, I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s how I seem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WHY DONT YOU GIVE ME A SUGGESTION.\u201d \n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t tell you how to control your dog, we\u2019re just asking that you please keep the noise down.\u201d\n\n*storms off*\n\n**Morning update:** Posted this mostly as a rant and went to bed, thanks for all the replies! I only heard the dog bark for a second last night, and so far nothing this morning.\n\nI should also note, the few interactions with this neighbor prior to this had been pleasant. They\u2019ve let us borrow a ladder to paint, cleared our driveway with their snowblower a couple times when we aren\u2019t home. Smile/wave in passing. \n\nAfter seeing some of the replies, I\u2019m thinking maybe she is also annoyed by the dog and just doesn\u2019t know what to do. They\u2019ve only had him for 3 years apparently. Maybe I caught her after a bad day of work, and maybe I should have prefaced with a thank you for clearing our driveway. /shrug we\u2019ll see what happens now I guess.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/11tjysp/tried_to_kindly_ask_my_neighbor_if_they_can_do/", "created_utc": 1679037318.0, "score": 393, "author": "cluelessbasket", "num_comments": 245, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/11tjysp/tried_to_kindly_ask_my_neighbor_if_they_can_do/", "html_title": ""}

Immediately aggressive when we confronted them (PA, USA)", "selftext": "Hi there! \n\nWe have x6, 50-70ft pine trees along our property line with a neighbor. Yesterday we received a VM from our neighbor saying a tree service is cutting down \"one or two\" of the trees the following morning and was \"just letting us know.\" This was news to us, she did not ask permission and we did not agree to any trees being cut. \n\nWe texted back and said we want to speak with the tree company first, and to ask the name of the tree company. We didn't okay the work, and they did not respond. \n\nThe crew came next morning and got to work without speaking with us. We  went outside and the boss said \"the neighbor wants it cut so we're cutting it.\" He did not say the tree was sick or dead when we asked. We expressed it was on shared property but ultimately thinking this was the one and only tree they wanted down, we agreed that they could do the work. We told them to come to us before doing anything to the second tree and inward. They ended up cutting branches from the second tree without asking us. \n\nI was sitting out back and heard my neighbor approach them and they  loudly discussed how we \"tried to shut them down\". My neighbor says \"too bad for them. We're cutting down all of these trees.\" \n\nWe went back out front to let the tree service know that we won't okay any additional work. They said when they return they'll just cut the tree from their property and paid no mind to the fact that the trees may be partially owned. \n\nThe neighbors came to us and we mentioned that they didn't ask our permission to cut the tree down, to which they immediately raised their voices, started cursing at us, and said we don't have a choice about the rest of them coming down. They said the trees are theirs, but did not show proof when we asked. I did record the exchange on my phone. \n\nQuestions- \n\n1. Do we need to get a survey done on our dime to prove that the trees are either ours, or shared? Or if we get a cease and desist drafted, would it be on them to prove they own the trees before they can cut more? \n\n2. What do we do if the tree service comes back and starts cutting without our permission?\n\n3. What would you do in this situation? \n\nBelow is our plan of action, how does this look? Ultimately we'd like to keep the trees, but are willing to be flexible. \n\n1. Going to the township tomorrow to see if we can get more property line info, and guidance from the town. \n2. Meeting with a lawyer next week to get a cease and desist letter drafted, until they can prove they own the trees. \n3. If the trees are owned jointly, we may consider having them pay to remove them contingent upon them proving that the trees are in poor health and or pose a hazard, and that the work be done by a reputable and insured service. \n\n\nTL;DR - Neighbors had one of 6, large healthy pines cut on our property line without asking for our consent. They are actively planning to cut the rest without our consent. Pursuing a cease and desist until they can prove that the trees are on their property line.

What do we do?", "selftext": "  \n\nI recently bought a Condo (2nd floor unit) and have been trying to settle in with my family - 2 kids (12y and 3y). My problem is our 65+ old neighbor who is also in the board of HOA. She lives alone with her dog right next door to us.\n\nShe has been kind of bullying us from Day one. Every time she passes by us, she gives this disapproving and demeaning look which I never understood why. Our downstairs neighbor who came in and introduced themselves told us that she is like that to everyone and warned us to stay away from her.\n\nShe has been \u2018telling\u2019 us to do lot of things like \n\n\\- Park our car much far away from the parking line, even though we parked ours much well inside the lines, because she wants more space to open her car doors! We agreed because we wanted to be nice.\n\n\\- She keeps telling our kid not to play in the front of the building (This is a gated community and all kids play out in the front in the evenings) We agreed. She then said that he should not play behind the building also, which is mostly woods and trees. We agreed to that too. But our 12yr old being 12yr old went some 30 foot into the trees area and sat underneath the trees with his 2 friends and was playing with sticks. This woman comes knocking our door and yells at me. I said \u201cok. I will tell my child not to play there\u201d. But I got real pissed off when she said \u201cWhen does school start? Very soon I suppose. Can\u2019t wait for them to go back\u201d in front of my kid. He felt very hurt and I convinced him saying that \u201csometimes some people can be mean, and we should not be bothered by it\u201d\n\n\\- Last week, at around 11:30 at night, my husband was sitting in our balcony spray painting a picture frame. She came downstairs to walk her dog, looked up, saw us and asked what we were doing. My husband said, \u201cspray painting\u201d. She gave some weird BS reasons as to why we are not allowed to spray paint or switch on our balcony light after 10PM and that there are rules. She also had the management email us the rule book. We read through it and there was nothing relating to balcony lights or spray painting or anything remotely related to it. \n\n\\- Yesterday, I was spray painting a foot board in the evening and finished doing it about 10:30M. She saw me cleaning up and asked, \u201cAre you painting again?\u201d. I said \u201cyes\u201d. She replied \u201cI have told you already not to do that. It is 10:30\u201d. I politely and very calmly said \u201cI am only spray painting and it is not disturbing anyone\u201d. To which she angrily replied, \u201cThere are rules and I am complaining about you to police tomorrow\u201d and walked away. I brought in the headboard 30 minutes later, after they dried.\n\nShe does not live directly above or below us there is no way she would even know that I was painting if she hadn\u2019t look up into my balcony. There was absolutely no noise except from the very small spraying noise from the rattle can which I am 200% sure is not audible 10 feet away from where I was painting. We did not make a peep when moving the headboard also.\n\nWe feel like we are being bossed around by this woman. (A few others feel this way too but have not openly said it to us but implied). She has lived in this building for over 25 years and we are only 2 months in. We are Asians and immigrants. Any police complaints against us could affect our visa status.

What would you do?", "selftext": "In a nutshell: I live in the southern U.S. and my previous insurance company left our state by opting non-renewal on all policies. I previously paid $3000/yr. Now, I can't seem to get a policy through private insurance companies, and a quasi-government controlled option (insurer of last resort) is likely my only option, per two different insurance agents. The new option will be closer to $11,000, for terrible coverage. My mortgage is currently $883/mo. \n\nEven if I was foolhardy and wanted to opt for no insurance, I can't due to my mortgage. What would you do? I'm not sure I can sell the house if new homeowners can't insure it.\n\nEdit 1: Since people are asking, yes, I'm part of a family. I'm extremely stressed by the situation, and a little taken aback at the \"just move\" comments, so apologies for not being more responsive. I was hoping for some insight into how others would actually handle it...if you decided to sell, how would you handle paying for two residences while you tried to sell it? Would you write to a local representative? What would you say to them? Would you consider buying again, or just feel too burned to try for a while?\n\nEdit 2: I am in LA, not FL.\n\nUPDATE: Based on advice in this thread (u/MsTerious1), I contacted my mortgage lender and asked about force-placed insurance. It goes something like this: the mortgage company will be notified on 5/5 that my current policy has ended. They will provide their own insurance for the property until I secure my own. It can be cancelled and replaced with whatever policy I choose, at any time. The premium on this lender-provided insurance may be better or worse than than Citizens; the coverage on both is terrible in different ways. This only buys me some time to contact other carriers and take a breath.\n\nUPDATE 2: I am going to have my electric panels updated and potentially some plumbing work done to try for a 4-point inspection. This has been requested by Kin Insurance; if I provide that, they may take me. However, this will be thousands of dollars and will take a few weeks. Still trying brokers, and will resume tomorrow.\n\nUPDATE 3: I signed on to two policies that cover different things, to reduce the cost a tiny bit. The first policy is with Citizens for wind & hail, and the second is with another carrier for liability & fire. It's an extra $500 a month for this coverage; not sustainable.

Most of the homes around here are modest capes, about 1,800 sq ft. About four years ago, our neighbors moved in\u2014really nice people. Late last year, they did a major home addition: added a two-car garage, around 800 sq ft of new living space, a master bedroom and bathroom, and re-sided the whole house. Honestly, it looked great.\n\nFast forward to about two weeks ago: I came home and noticed they were doing another addition\u2014this time on the side of their house closest to mine. They\u2019d already poured a slab and started framing. From what I can tell, it looks like another bedroom, maybe a bathroom, and possibly even a second story.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: it\u2019s less than two feet from the fence dividing our properties. I really didn\u2019t have an issue with it, but I thought it was odd that something like that would be allowed, so I checked the city\u2019s building records. Not only could I not find any permits or approvals for this new addition, but there were also no permits or variances for the first addition they completed last year.\n\nWell\u2026 apparently someone in the neighborhood reported them, because the city slapped a stop-work notice on their door.\n\nNot long after that, the neighbor came over and asked me\u2014pretty bluntly\u2014if I was the one who reported them. I told them no (because I didn\u2019t), but it definitely felt like they didn\u2019t necessarily believe me.\n\nHere\u2019s my question:\nCan the city actually make them tear down the new addition if it wasn\u2019t permitted or approved?

{"title": "2 years after posting about severe buyers remorse because of sound - thoughts", "selftext": "\\[TL;DR: Bought an eco-friendly house during Covid, moved in and found the highway noise almost unbearable; also so many problems with the house. After fixing what we could, we literally just got used to the noise over time and are now very happy with the house.\\]\n\nHusband and I (late 30s) bought our first house and moved into it a week short of 2 years ago during Covid.  The house is an eco-friendly townhouse (double glazing, high ceilings, grey water, gas stove/oven, heat pumps, etc.) in a small complex of 8 houses in total, was almost newly built (18 months old) and we were the second owners. The complex is near a major highway so because of Covid lockdown, it was quiet when we viewed the house 3 times before deciding to buy it. Shortly before moving in, lockdown restrictions lifted and by the time we moved in, we were devastated by the noise. Compounding the noise issue was a bunch of other issues that we only picked up after we'd moved in, including:\n\n\\- The grey water system didn't work; turns out it hadn't been installed properly and the installers (friends of the developer) had left town;\n\n\\- When the seasonal rains started just after we moved in, the roof leaked in 2 of the 3 bedrooms, both bathrooms, and in the living room. And when I say it leaked - it POURED down the walls. This was experienced by all the houses in the complex and it turns out the roofer (also a friend of the developer) had taken short cuts in laying the roof, hadn't installed the necessary flashing or sealed the roofs properly;\n\n\\- The outside doors started sagging and sticking, and it turns out they were actually inside doors that had been used as outside doors (again, the builders taking short cuts);\n\n\\- The place was advertised as having fibre internet but it turns out that was a lie - it was actually some kind of satellite wifi and thus much slower and much more expensive than fibre;\n\n\\- We were promised that a high noise reflecting wall would be built next to the highway to deflect the sound of traffic, but once we'd moved in the estate agent told us that any wall would be at our own cost (which was exorbitant);\n\n\\- When we got building and roof inspectors out and were told that the roofs weren't up to scratch and that the developer would have to pay to redo them, he (developer) declared bankruptcy and fled town. None of us had the money for lawyers to chase up on it, so had to spend a small fortune out of our own pockets having the roof replaced.\n\nThere were smaller things as well. Husband had a psychological breakdown and we were determined to sell after 6 months and just take the financial hit, even thought we'd put all our savings into the deposit for the mortgage. A lot of anger was directed at the estate agent who'd lied about the fibre (which was crucial for our work during Covid when we were WFH), the noise wall, not disclosing the roof leaking, etc. In fact, about 4 months in when the roof was being replaced we called a meeting with her to express our unhappiness at the whole situation and - can you believe this - she went on the defensive, saying nothing was her fault and blaming us for essentially having too high expectations, and when my husband got upset and mentioned something about the \"f\\*cking roof that leaks worse than a sieve\" she had the audacity to say \"I'm a Christian, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't use that kind of language around me otherwise I'll leave\"! (In hindsight we should have told her to get out, and that some Christian she was if she lied continuously about various things but got offended by an f-bomb). \n\nAnyway, long story long, we fixed everything we could (grey water, roof, doors, etc.). Had to loan money for the roof. Developed an amazing garden. Put in water features and planted trees and shrubs to break the noise. Began writing lists to put around the house reminding ourselves of all the awesome things about our house - the eco-friendly stuff, our vegetable garden, the massive open land next to us where I can trail run and take the dogs out, the fact that it's a tiny townhouse, our super nice neighbours, etc. \n\nAnd suddenly one day we realised that we'd become used to the highway noise and that we were deeply happy here. 2 years in and it's only got better! So for all with serious buyers remorse about noise and other problems in the house - most of it gets better over time, I promise!\n\n(Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/ls5b10/how\\_do\\_you\\_know\\_if\\_you\\_really\\_made\\_a\\_bad\\_buy\\_or/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/ls5b10/how_do_you_know_if_you_really_made_a_bad_buy_or/) )", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/z4afi7/2_years_after_posting_about_severe_buyers_remorse/", "created_utc": 1669373239.0, "score": 376, "author": "wooden_cupboards", "num_comments": 44, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/z4afi7/2_years_after_posting_about_severe_buyers_remorse/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "AITAH for blowing a gasket when strangers use my circle drive to turn around on their golf carts?", "selftext": "We live in a relatively quiet lake view (winter) forest community. There are more golf carts than people here. Every household (with very little exception-ours) has one. They illegally ride them day and night, though this is a state wide problem (KY, US). It is illegal to drive non street legal carts on roadways. Essentially unenfocreable. Neighbors don't bother me at all. Mainly because they don't drive them on our property. \n\nThe problem is the large campground below us. I'll never understand why people drive miles to a lake resort area only to pile in a golf cart, drive around a residential area (can't they do this at home?) and drop beer cans all over. The back entrance is below our home and, even though the campground owners have signs that forbid golf carts beyond the park, they come pouring out like hornets especially on the weekends.\n\nI've come to grips with them on the county roadway, illegality notwithstanding. What I cannot abide is when they use our circle drive to turn around and go back towards the campground. Get them on camera all the time and 99% are from there. I've spoke to the owners and they did put up the signs but they are ignored. It's their way of reducing liability when and if someone on one of their campground carts gets plowed by a vehicle I guess. \n\nIt happened again yesterday evening while we were on the porch. Having tried a diplomatic tone in the past, I went off this time and yelled THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY! They either just waved or shot me the bird, I couldn't tell. We have signs up but they go unheeded as well. I fantasize about Stop Stix, garden hoses with nails, and the like. The only thing that works is parking a vehicle in the circle, but that's not always practical. They've been known to drive around them in the grass. \n\nThe nuclear option is law enforcement.  And I  have connections. But they've got more to contend with than golf cart patrol. And that would likely target the neighbors which aren't the issue.  I've been thinking about a ten foot 4x4 painted yellow. Wouldn't cause damage to vehicles (mail, package delivery) if you didn't see it but might cause inconvenience to golf carts. The campground doesn't seem to want to simply lock the gate for fear of inconveniencing campers. But they sure are inconveniencing me. And a gate or chains is not practical. \n\nAm I the asshat?

I might be blind but I couldn't find a basic, \"home owner 101\" page. I humbly submit this writeup for consideration as a \"New Homeowner 101\" post. This is based on several decades of me making mistakes and learning, as well as helping several friends and neighbours through setting up their first home. Feedback is welcome!)*\n\n\n**So you\u2019re moving into your own home. Congratulations!**\n\nHome ownership can be a great way to build equity in yourself. Home repair and DIY can be an enjoyable, money-saving pastime. Or perhaps you just want a dry place to sleep that you don\u2019t need to think about.\n\nHere is a quick guide.\n\n(Note: *none* of these links are affiliate links. I don\u2019t care about making money. I am just linking to an example for some items so you can see what I am talking about or learn more)\n\n## Step 1: Initial House Check\n\nJust moved in, or moving in soon? Your Top Priority is safety. Look at these first:\n\n\n### Core Safety\n\n1. **Check your smoke detectors.**\n\n   * If you push the button do they go off? They should. Check if you have the battery type or if they are wired into your house. Replace the batteries if needed, with NON-rechargeable alkaline batteries. This ensures they will have enough power to sound off.\n\n   * Have at least one smoke detector per floor. No messing around. Fire and CO can kill you.\n\n   * Splurge for the high-quality smoke detectors that do two different types of detecting - [both photoelectric and ionization](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/research/areas-of-research/center-for-injury-research-and-policy/injury-topics/home-safety/types-of-smoke-alarms). They cost around $60 at most hardware stores.\n\n2. **Get a Carbon Monoxide detector.** One per floor and/or one in each bedroom. These can be plugin-type with battery backup. Should last 10 years. If you have a fireplace you'll want a CO detector nearby too.\n\n3. **Do you have fire extinguishers?** Get one for each floor. You can buy these at the hardware store. Make sure everyone in the house knows where they sit.\n\n4. **Change the locks.**  You want a qualified locksmith to change all of the locks and issue you a new set of keys. Some realtors will add this service for free as part of buying the house. If this didn\u2019t happen when you moved in, do it now. You never know who has a key to the old house.\n\n### Fire Safety\n\n1. **Does your dryer exhaust send air outside of the house?** Turn on your dryer. Go outside and check that the hot air is coming out of the vent. If not, get that fixed. \n\n2. **Metal dryer duct.** The dryer vent (the flap on the outside of the house) and duct (the tube on the inside) should be made of metal, _not_ plastic. Ideally you have a short, [rigid duct](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Master-Flow-4-in-x-5-ft-Round-Metal-Duct-Pipe-CP4X60/100196725) with minimum bends and elbows, but some houses use [semi-rigid metal](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-4-in-x-8-ft-Semi-Rigid-Dryer-Duct-With-Clamps-98251/307638954?). They also need to be attached and sealed with [_metal_ foil tape](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Nashua-Tape-1-89in-x-9-8-yd-322-Multi-Purpose-HVAC-Foil-Duct-Tape-1198777/100187909), *NOT* duct tape. If your dryer vent uses grey vinyl duct tape, that should get replaced.\n   * You can buy metal [\"ring clamps\" or \"worm clamps\"](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-4-in-Galvanized-Steel-Worm-Gear-Clamp-MC4HD/203626508) to hold the duct pieces together. Don't use screws in a dryer duct; that catches lint and can create a fire hazard.\n   * Clean out your dryer lint trap after each dryer load\n   * Once per year (or spring and fall) - clean out your dryer duct with a vacuum and/or [cleaning brush](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Appliance-Brush-DVBRUSH-12HD/205046828). You can hire a furnace company to do this but it's easy to do yourself.\n\n### First Aid and Removing Water\n\n1. **Get a first aid kit.** You should have some first aid supplies in your house - bandaids, and some over-the-counter pain medicine. [The most comprehensive list I have found is on this emergency preparedness website](https://theprepared.com/bug-out-bags/guides/first-aid-kit-list/). (bias disclaimer: I post there sometimes). Ideally - plan to take a first aid class.\n2. **Longer Downspouts.** When it rains, does water leave your property and head away from the house? That\u2019s good. If not: add [rigid](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Amerimax-Home-Products-2-in-x-3-in-x-10-ft-White-Vinyl-Downspout-M0593/100095267) or [curvy](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Amerimax-Home-Products-Flex-A-Spout-White-Vinyl-Downspout-Extension-85010/100057879) extensions on your downspouts to drain water farther away from your property. Water is the enemy; keep it away.\n3. **Sump Pump.** If you have a basement, does it have a sump? This is a hole below the basement floor, where water collects on purpose. The pump\u2019s job is to push that water out and away, usually through a hose coming out the side of your house.\n\nYou want to hook it up in the spring, and unhook in the fall\n\nGet something at least 1/3 Horsepower or more\n\n### Urgent Inspection Items\n\nReview the home inspection. Did your house get an inspection before you bought it? You should. These can often contain a helpful list of items that need fixing. Review to see if anything is urgent. For example - if your furnace or hot water heater were reported to have open, unsafe combustion, fix that right away.\n\nNow you\u2019ve covered the main items so your house can stay safe, standing, and dry.\n\n## Step 2: Don\u2019t Panic. Relax. It\u2019s Not A Sprint.\n\nFixing and maintaining a house takes time. You won\u2019t be fixing everything on your list in one day, one week, one month, or even one year. Don\u2019t panic. Be easy on yourself. Once you have the initial safety items checked, above, consider everything below this as optional. You may take months, years, or longer to do all of the items you want or get to all of the fixes. But you also need to take time and enjoy yourself.\n\nIf you know someone with a very nice house, or a wide collection of tools, it likely took them years or literally decades to get there. Don\u2019t worry about comparing yourself to others, or feel that you need to \"keep up with the Joneses\". Every house is different. But this one is yours. You can make it something that you love.\n\n## Items For Later\n\n1. **Find and label your breaker box.** Your home should have an electrical \"breaker box\" with a number of switches. These can be used to turn off electricity to different parts of the house - e.g. if you need to fix or replace something. Check and make sure you know where this is, so you can shut off power if needed. Also - do the switches have labels? If not, consider spending an hour on a lazy Saturday labeling them. Turn on all of the lights in the house. Then one at a time - turn off each switch and note which corresponding lights or appliances turn off. Label that breaker switch so you know what it controls.\n\n2. **Find your water and gas shutoffs.** Locate the levers that shut off water and gas flowing into your house. If you need to prevent flooding, it\u2019s useful to know how to turn off the water. For natural gas lines - you can buy a [fancy aluminum tool](https://www.fire-etc.com/4-in-1-Emergency-Tool/) to shut off the line safely. But the normal procedure is: get out of the house, then call the fire department.\n\n3. **Frost-proof garden hose faucets / hose bibs.** If you live in a climate where the temperature drops below freezing, check that your garden hose spigots (also called \"hose bibs\") are the [\"frost proof\" type](https://brickhousehomeinspection.blogspot.com/2014_11_01_archive.html?m=1). These have an extra valve or screw cap on top to allow water to drain, and prevent them from freezing. Regardless - be sure to unhook your garden hose before winter.\n\n## Gifts To Your Future Self\n\n### Create \"The Document\"\n\nCreate one doc and keep all of your account numbers and contact numbers inside.\n\nNow that you own a home, you may start collecting all kinds of accounts and numbers - home insurance, property taxes, serial numbers on appliances, etc. To stay organized, create one document or folder and keep everything there, in one place. I created a Google Doc and shared it with my spouse - all of the account numbers and contact phone numbers go inside. Then when we need to call insurance, the vet, etc. It\u2019s all there. I print the first page and tack it to the fridge (comment or email me if you want a copy of the template).\n\nI also organize my passwords in a password manager - [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/). It\u2019s free, open source, and helps me stay much more organized while keeping my passwords secure.\n\n### City Services\n\nIf you live in a city, check if they offer free or cheap services to assess and fix your house, such as:\n\n* Water/drainage inspection, to see if the land is sloped and water drains away correctly.\n\n* Sewer drain inspection - to check for old tree roots and clear them out of your drain pipes. Depending on the city and age of your house, this may involve a drain rooter, herbicide, or other options.\n\nYou may also be able to get these inspections from your utility company.\n\n### Property Taxes\n\nDepending where you live, property taxes may be paid as part of your mortgage, or directly to the city or county. Call your mortgage company to check. If you pay the city directly (which may be cheaper) you can often sign up to pay monthly bills instead of one large annual bil. This means a smaller bill to deal with, which may be easier.\n\n## Upgrades to Reduce Your Bills + Utilities\n\n1. **Low-flow taps.** I installed [\"ultra low-flow\" aerators](https://www.homedepot.com/p/NEOPERL-0-5-GPM-Dual-Thread-PCA-Spray-Water-Saving-Faucet-Aerator-37-0206-98/204405167) (0.5 GPM) on the ends of our faucet taps. Usually $10 or less at hardware stores. These cut our water usage by 30%. Probably the best return-for-money item I\u2019ve installed in the house.\n   * You may need teflon tape ($0.50 cents) and some pliers to install them\n2. **Low-flow showerhead.** Can also reduce your water use a lot. 2.5 GPM or less; they can get down to 1.5 GPM.\n3. **LED bulbs.** Do you need/want to replace old-style bulbs with these? [Home depot sells packs of LED bulbs](https://www.homedepot.com/p/60-Watt-Equivalent-A19-Energy-Efficient-LED-Light-Bulb-Soft-White-8-Pack-FG-04264/318065274). These can make a big difference in your electricity bill if you are converting from old-style incandescents.\n4. **Curtains + blinds** for all windows, to keep warmer in winter, cooler in summer\n   * [Ikea sells cellular blinds / honeycomb blinds](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/pleated-cellular-blinds-700225/) that work well, so long as the windows are standard sizes. Honeycomb blinds create a pocket of air for added insulation.\n5. **Sink faucet seals.** Check if your sinks have silicone caulking around the base of the faucet. You can get a $6 tube of this at the hardware store. Prevents water from leaking down below the sink.\n\nSome insurance companies will give you a discount if you pay your bill yearly instead of monthly. This can require budgeting. Call and ask if they offer a discount for yearly payments.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nBudgeting for House Maintenance. Some places tout a \"rule of thumb\" to expect spending 1% of your house\u2019s value on maintenance each year. We have spent about $100/month, on average, fixing stuff on the house. Some years it has been higher.\n\n* One method: Put aside $20/month to save up a \"fix house things\" supply of cash.\n   * I can bet that something will break at some point.\n   * But I don't know what, or when.\n   * When something does happen, I can use this stack of savings to help pay for it.\n   * This helps you to \"keep moving forward\" with finances, rather than constantly getting knocked back by repairs\n   * Even if your \"fixit\" fund doesn't cover the whole repair, it's always better than nothing.\n   * This can roll into budgeting to start an Emergency Fund if you like personal finance\n\n* Furnace filters - In a forced-air furnace, change these every 1-3 months, depending on wear. You can also use a finer filter in the summer (e.g. MERV 9) when there is more pollen in the air, and a coarser filter (e.g. MERV 6) in the winter, to reduce the load on your furnace when it may be running more often.\n* Furnace ducts - cleaning out furnace ducts is **NOT** usually needed, unless you find mold, rodents, or pests. If you have a forced-air furnace, many HVAC and furnace companies will tell you that you should have your furnace ducts cleaned every 2-5 years. However, [the EPA does *not* recommend regularly cleaning your ducts](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/should-you-have-air-ducts-your-home-cleaned):\n\n> Duct cleaning has never been shown to actually prevent health problems.\n\n> If no one in your household suffers from allergies or unexplained symptoms or illnesses and .. [you do not see] large deposits of mold .. having your air ducts cleaned is probably unnecessary.\n\n> EPA does .. recommend that if you have a fuel burning furnace, stove or fireplace, they be inspected for proper functioning and serviced before each heating season to protect against carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nHere is another article from [Bob Villa](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/reasons-to-skip-cleaning-air-ducts/).\n\nIf the home is especially dirty or questionable, perhaps have the duct system cleaned right after you move in.\n\n* Eavestrough - hire some company to clean them out, yearly. Stay safe; don't work from heights.\n\n[Here is a decent house maintenance checklist from r/selfreliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfreliance/comments/kobp16/keep_your_house_in_tiptop_shape_an_incredibly/).  I could probably do a post on this topic.\n\n## Tools\n\nDo you want to get into DIY repairs? This can be a fun skill to learn, or a way to save money. Sometimes a quick easy fix you can do yourself can save you hundreds of $$ dollars not calling a repair person. A core selection of quality tools can help you take care of your home.\n\nI prefer to \"buy once, cry once\", and pay for one quality tool - like a drill - rather than buying the cheapest model which ends up wearing out.\n\n### Tools you might want\n\n* Quality drill + battery. In my house - all screw holes are pre-drilled to avoid splitting the wooden studs. Any tall or heavy furniture - e.g. dressers, book cases - gets attached to a stud.\n* Studfinder - to help locate those studs\n* Screwdriver\n* Eye protection glasses\n* Earplugs\n* Wrench set + pliers\n* Headlamp flashlight\n* Plunger. Buy it before you need it\n\n### Lower priority tools - get as needed\n\n* Dust mask / Respirator mask - I use this whenever I'm working with paint, sawdust, sweeping the garage, etc.\n* Assortment of screws\n* Hammer, nails\n* Monkey wrench - for the big stubborn stuff\n\n### Security\n\n* **Replace all of the short screws in your door hinges with longer, 2.5\" or 3.5\" screws.** I had to buy a long drill bit to be able to do this properly. Default door screws suck, and may break off easily if someone tries to force their way into your home.\n* [Door Armor](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Door-Armor-Max-Combo-Set-White/3744197) - I spent $200 and installed these metal reinforcement kits around our front and back doors.\n\n### Other\n\n* Fire safe - for documents + backup hard drive. Offsite backup is important too.\n* Sewer backflow valve. If you are in the city - does your house have one? These are usually at the lowest spot in the drainage, right before the sewer pipes leave your house. There may be an access hatch in your basement. Good to have to prevent sewer backups from getting into your place.\n* Your local library may even have a \"home energy audit kit\" with e.g. thermal camera for spotting poor insulation, a Kill-A-Watt style power usage meter, air quality monitor, etc.\n\n## House Insurance\n\nYou should get house insurance. The price will probably go up every year. But it's better than not having coverage. One way to fight rising prices is to call around every year before renewal and ask for a quote from several competing companies. Then play the best one against your current company to see if they will match or lower the rate.\n\n### Insurance videos\n\nIt is helpful to have videos of your stuff, to prove you have your stuff. If you ever need to make an insurance claim, this will help immensely.\n\nOnce per year, go into each room and take a video while you slowly pan around the room. State the date, and list all of the things that you see as you pan. Then save the videos some place safe.\n\n[Here is a top-rated post on Reddit Personal Finance from an ex-insurance adjuster, describing the best way to list the features of your stuff and make a claim](https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43iyip/our_family_of_5_lost_everything_in_a_fire/cziljy3/). These videos really help with that.\n\n## Long-Term Upgrades\n\nLarger items that can cost more, but help a lot. Long-term dreams to budget for.\n\n* **Air sealing** - Sealing the gaps, cracks, and other areas where air or creatures can get into your house is usually one of the most cost-effective improvements you can make to reduce your heating/cooling bills, and keep your house more comfortable. This usually involves spending a few $ hundred on sealing tape, foil tape, caulking, and cans of spray foam. This is worth a post all on it's own (stay tuned, I might write one). \"Breathing houses\" is an old, incorrect myth: [your house does not need to breathe](https://www.energyvanguard.com/blog/Myth-A-House-Needs-to-Breathe).\n\nIf you want more info on air-sealing:\n\n   * [Here is a blog post from a building science expert with a PHD who says \"don't bother insulating until after you air-seal first\"](https://www.energyvanguard.com/blog/don-t-insulate-your-attic/)\n   * [energy.gov has a visual map of locations to check for air-sealing](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/air-sealing-your-home)\n   * [The PNNL site has many guides for specific areas](https://basc.pnnl.gov/resource-guides) and a [40 page PDF](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/building_america/ba_airsealing_report.pdf).\n\n* **Attic insulation**. Depending on your climate, this is one of the most cost-effective upgrades you can do to keep your house cooler in the summer _and_ warmer in the winter. It\u2019s passive, so it works all the time and doesn\u2019t need power. You may need to work to find a quality attic contractor. You want to air-seal all of the gaps and spaces first with sealing tape, caulking, or spray foam before you add insulation.\n* **Battery-powered, backup sump pump**. This can give you peace-of-mind that your basement will not flood even when the power goes out and you are away from home. Hire a plumber to do it properly with connecting valves etc.\n* **Storm doors, front and back**. I installed these myself. These only technically give about R1 insulation, but they stop the cold, cold wind in the winter time.\n   * **Pro tip: If you install multiple storm doors, measure the widths of all of your house doors first, *before* driving to the hardware store. Because your doors may be different widths.** If you measure one door and then assume they are both the same, you might make it all the way home with two doors, screw the first side of the storm door into the wall, and then suddenly discover it doesn't fit, and smashes closed, hanging 6\" too far across your door frame. Ask me how I know.\n\n## Good Luck\n\nAll-in-all, turning your house into your home can be a fun, rewarding experience. Sure, things break, and sometimes it seems like there is always another item to fix. But don\u2019t sweat it - you\u2019re building your life and creating a great place to live. Enjoy it.\n\nGood luck!\n\n## Other Resources\n\n* [Another New Homeowner\u2019s Checklist](https://www.houselogic.com/buy/first-time-home-buyer/first-things-to-do-after-buying-a-house/)\n* Book: \"Black and Decker The Complete Photo Guide to Home Repair\".

Thank you for the correction!\n\nEdit 2: Add a note about air-sealing. You may not do this right away.

{"title": "Things I Wish Every First-Time Homebuyer Knew (From a Realtor Who\u2019s Been There)", "selftext": "* **Get that pre-approval DONE first.** Like, before you even seriously start scrolling listings. It's not sexy, I know, but knowing *exactly* what a lender will give you saves SO much wasted time and potential disappointment down the road. Seriously, talk to a lender or broker before you fall in love with something out of reach.\n* **The price tag isn't the** ***real*** **price.** Okay this one gets people. You save for the down payment, awesome! But don't forget closing costs (they can be thousands!), moving expenses, maybe immediate repairs the seller won't cover (that water heater *always* seems to die week one, right?), maybe needing new furniture... budget cushion is key.\n* **Please, please DO NOT skip the home inspection.** Seriously. Even on new construction. It might seem like a way to save $500-$800 now, but I've seen inspections uncover issues that would have cost buyers $10k, $20k, even more down the line. It's the best money you'll spend in the whole process, trust me on this.\n* **Try not to fall** ***completely*** **in love at first sight.** It's tough!

If you haven't done either of these and you've owned the water heater for longer than 2 years, get your ass in gear or it will cost you! Read on for an explanation and advice...\n\nFirst of all, depending on your water supply, you should flush your tank about once a year, possibly more if you have very mineraly water. The valve that comes on most water heaters kind of sucks, so I recommend watching [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nZjHTX91ZQ) about how to swap for a better valve. Don't fall for his tricky editing though!!! Realize that it will take you most of a day to empty all the water out of your system before you can start this. Also, I don't think he mentions it, but you should definitely turn the power off at the breaker first (if I didn't already need a new water heater, I'd be a little bit more pissed off about this part). If you don't turn the power off first, you run a very real risk of burning up your heating elements. If your water drains slowly or looks rusty, you might already be too late - it might be time for a new hot water heater. \n\nWhich brings me to the second part: the Anode Rod! Just because your water isn't rusty, doesn't mean you're out of the woods yet. Here's [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwapTUBP6jw) about how a water heater works. If you want to skip that, just know that there's some chemistry happening inside your tank and that if you don't keep your anode rod in tip-top shape, it fails and then the inside of your tank starts to rust, making your water nasty and drastically reducing the life of your water heater. Checking the rod is really simple with the right tools, so get to checking out your water heater before it's too late!\n\nAlso, I spent the whole weekend going through this process and ultimately replacing my water heater, so feel free to leave questions and if I learned the answer this weekend I'll be happy to share.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/9wbgce/do_you_know_about_flushing_your_hot_water_heater/", "created_utc": 1542002823.0, "score": 367, "author": "sassmo", "num_comments": 100, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/9wbgce/do_you_know_about_flushing_your_hot_water_heater/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I was so excited and motivated when I first paid for it.\n\nFirstly, solicitors took their time and delayed things, so I didn't get the keys until months and months down the line.\n\nThen, I brought in my first builder to renovate the property. I had it all planned out. Everything was going well; he had a team of tradesmen on site every day, and good progress was being made. Then, due to an internal drama with the company he was partnered with, he started tackling all the jobs alone. This kept going on and on, and progress slowed down more and more until he just stopped. You could tell he tried to rush a lot of the work, as I now have plaster coming off the walls and an awful paint job. No, I didn't pay him everything, but I paid him a fair amount.\n\nThe second builder came in to finish the job. I was very thorough with my checks and didn't go for the cheapest option (not that I did that the first time). Again, I was excited, thinking I could put this whole stressful saga behind me. Work, again, was going well, and when it came to the snagging list, I had a whole list of stuff, from badly laid tiles to uneven doors he had fitted but he disappeared. Again, I didn't pay everything.\n\nFinally, I'm on builder number three, I have very little money left and am literally scraping the bottom of the barrel, getting further and further into debt. He has now stopped turning up and walked away with my initial payment. I'm praying he reappears as I'm genuinely getting nervous and my mental health is declining. \n\nI'm so frustrated with homeownership.

{"title": "New Homeowners, its going to be okay.", "selftext": "I myself am a barely a homeowner for over a year now. I don't make a lot of money and I'm trying to raise a family on a single income. \n\nHouses need maintenance and typically if you buy a house from someone, especially if they've been renting it out, it has a few things that need work. You're going to run into all sorts of things that are cause for concern and need to be fixed. The first thing you need to do is *relax* and prioritize. Unless its an emergency, like a water leak or electrical problem, chances are it can wait a little while or you can tackle part of it yourself.\n\nIf you're even slightly handy (I have zero handiwork experience), you can take care of a lot of things yourself to save some money. For example, when I moved here the gutters were not draining properly at all, but I've managed to take apart each gutter, clean the what seemed like years of debris and put them back together. We had two giant trees that needed to be cut down with quotes of over 4500 dollars, shopped around and got someone to put them on the ground for about 1250 dollars, we've been chopping and moving the remaining wood into piles for give away or use later. I've replaced outlets, installed a fence, installed outlets. replaced ceiling fans. There are tons of resources available online, soon I'm going to be replacing an electric water heater myself, doesn't seem that hard. Its amazing what you can do with a few tools and an open mind to trying things.\n\nThere are a few things I've done to put my mind at ease for home repairs, I know where the circuit breaker is for the house, I know where the water shutoff into the house is, I've tested all of the outlets, I applied for home repair store credit cards (a 5% discount and interest free on purchases over x amount for 6 or so months are -huge-), I'm putting money away into a house maintenance fund and have been spending time finding out who the best local plumbers/electricians/contractors are. \n\nI get it, it seems daunting or really stressful, but slow down, breathe, get *multiple* quotes for jobs (I had like 5 quotes just to get trees cut down), do regular maintenance such as cleaning your gutters, caulking things, don't let known leaks go ignored, plan for the future.

{"title": "PSA: don\u2019t let my mistakes happen to you", "selftext": "TL;DR: NEVER procrastinate repairing a leaky toilet (even if it looks like a tiny little bit of water.  It\u2019s not.) AND ABCYGF - always be checking your garage freezer(s).\n\nYesterday was an absolute catastrophe.  I woke up and smelled a smelly smell coming from the garage. I thought a bird or chipmunk or something had maybe gotten inside and died. Something was dead, but it was not an animal instead it was a power outlet. The 20 year old GFCI outlet that my chest freezer was plugged in to had finally CI\u2019ed it\u2019s last GF.  Everything in the freezer melted and there was meat juice all over the floor.  Two deer, a turkey, a bag of chicken thighs, it was packed full. Let some ground meat sit out in 70 degree weather for a few days if you need to know what it smelled like. \n\nNext, as we\u2019re cleaning that up I find that my beer fridge, which also has a freezer, was cracked open and everything in there melted\u2026it had also contained some deer meat and meat juice had dripped down through the freezer, down the back, and was all over the compressor and the hot side of the fridge components\u2026the putrid smell of bacterial death was everywhere.  As we\u2019re cleaning that I sigh and look up toward the heavens to ask for the suffering to end, and I happen to notice in the corner of the garage (above which the aforementioned leaky toilet sits) the drywall is soaked floor to ceiling and mold specks are growing.  I already knew (from having just replaced the wax ring on that toilet a week earlier) that the toilet supply valve had a drip. Closing the valve didn\u2019t stop it so I knew that the valve needed to be replaced.  Apparently that drip became a spill, and the spill had become a drizzle.  In two years living in this house I have used that toilet MAYBE 2 times.  I should have just yeeted the thing out the window on day one but instead I\u2019ve been playing on its terms and now my garage has payed the price.  \n\nNow, After spending 3 hours cleaning up the smell of hell, I have to go to Home Depot for a toilet valve, A new GFCI outlet, more spray bleach, and some sanity.  They were out of sanity.  At the end of it I am at least thankful that the first problem resulted in me finding all the others, and only the garage was effected, the rest of the house is A-ok for now.  Fans and dehumidifiers are still running in the garage, it smells almost okay again and it\u2019s cleaner than a garage has a right to be.  \n\nBottom line: refer to TLDR, don\u2019t be dumb like me and always be vigilant, my home is only 20 years old so I had a false sense of security and I now feel like I need to keep my head on a swivel.  I set a phone alarm to check the fridge & freezer every day, and now I will be using that toilet for the rest of time out of spite", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/vb9g1o/psa_dont_let_my_mistakes_happen_to_you/", "created_utc": 1655117781.0, "score": 364, "author": "Skweets", "num_comments": 71, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/vb9g1o/psa_dont_let_my_mistakes_happen_to_you/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Is my GF\u2019s home being targeted for a burglary?", "selftext": "This happened today during Christmas but me, my GF and her family were celebrating Christmas in her house all day with several cars in the driveway. I left around 6pm and the rest of her family left shortly after in their respective cars. There were no cars left in the driveway (although my gf\u2019s parents were still home because their car was inside the garage). My gf left her house to come to mine and says as she was pulling out, there was a car parked right outside the house on the street with a male &amp; female parked in it. She made eye contact with them, and thought it was strange they were near the house because it is on a very busy street with no pedestrians and really no good place to stop...usually if people are lost they pull into a gas station located directly across the street. After she saw them they put their blinker lights on.  About 30 minutes later, when she got to my house she received a call from her parents saying that someone rang the doorbell and when they went to see who it was, someone had left a cellphone with a sticky note with a number written on it. The cell phone appeared to be a little girls cellphone as the case was a pink case with lots of glitter on it etc.\n\nHer parents called the number and a female picked up. Her parents said this cellphone was left at their door and the female said \u201coh..okay, what\u2019s your address?\u201d Luckily, her parents smartly said they would not give her their address and would be giving the cell phone to the local police and they could pick it up at the police station. The female said ok thanks. Her parents then gave the phone to the local police and told them what happened and the police thought it was very strange and told them they would look into it. \n\nIs my GF\u2019s house being targeted for a burglary? Seems to me this was intentional to see if someone was in the home. The way the home is set up is the driveway is rather long and this person would have to travel up the driveway, take several steps on the porch, leave the cellphone and ring the bell. There\u2019s no way it can have been dropped on accident (with a sticky note attached to it). The home has no cameras or security system, but, they do have a massive 120lb golden lab. However, the dog usually does his business in the backyard so he does not get walked very much so it would be difficult to know that a dog lives at that house.\n\n\nEdit#1 - Lots of comments and suggestions on this post, very much appreciate it. After speaking with my GF\u2019s family, I thought I\u2019d share a few things that I just learned about. Turns out yesterday after when my GF left, my GF\u2019s parents were in the living room and they actually saw this car pull up close to the driveway and saw a male walk up the driveway, up the porch stairs and leave an iPhone in front of the main door (on a little table that\u2019s located on the porch). They did not ring the bell, but rather just left the cell phone and ran away quickly. I was also mistaken that there was a note left on the phone itself, there was no note. Instead, when my GF\u2019s parents found the phone (which also was beat up and cracked), there were 14 missed calls over the past few minutes. As they were debating what to do with it, a number called back and they did not answer originally, but then asked Siri to call back the last number. They said that the female that picked up seemed flustered and said \u201cthis is not my phone but I can get in touch with the owner, where are you?\u201d To which my GF parents said no go to police station and the female then got upset. \n\nThe police said they spoke to the owner of the phone and said their friend was trying to drop off the phone and they dropped it off at wrong house by accident. Apparently the cops said the house they were supposed to drop it off at was 10 houses away. They gave the cops all the info they requested and the police said they appeared forthcoming.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/kkd2zg/is_my_gfs_home_being_targeted_for_a_burglary/", "created_utc": 1608959435.0, "score": 361, "author": "blackthought_", "num_comments": 135, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/kkd2zg/is_my_gfs_home_being_targeted_for_a_burglary/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Thanks to everyone who recommended water heaters to us, we ended up buying a Rheem 50 gallon smart water heater. I was getting stressed at the idea of the water heater flooding our basement, so we wanted something in stock at a store near us that would be easy to install ourselves. It has leak identification built in, can shut itself off if it's leaking, a 12-year warranty, and is bigger than our old water heater, so we think it'll be pretty great. It was a little over our rebate limit from Sears, but we were okay with having to pay a little out of pocket to get the upgrade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband and father-in-law picked up the Rheem on Friday and installed it, his Dad used to do plumbing so the whole ordeal was pretty quick and painless. The old water heater is still in our backyard, we need to get it to the dump this weekend lol. The new one seems to be running great, and we noticed the humidity in the whole house has gone down since the leaky one was removed! The house has been a solid 65% RH since we bought a hygrometer in August; this is a big part of the reason we wanted a home energy audit to begin with. My husband collects trading cards and they've started warping due to the humidity in the guest bedroom, and the room with the leaking water heater would get as high as 72% RH! The whole house has been around 58% since we replaced the water heater. We're not totally sure if that's all from the water heater, or because it's been cold out and the heat's been running, it's probably a combination of the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, the money. I emailed Sears a copy of our receipt for the Rheem on Sunday, and by the time I left work yesterday I had an email from them confirming that we'll be getting our rebate! We're getting the full $650 rebate, the check should arrive in a week or so. I hope some people on here have enjoyed this little adventure, thanks for the water heater advice everyone!

{"title": "Former homeowner reached out to me today - I have the urge to do something that might be weird.", "selftext": "This most likely doesn't belong in this sub BUT I don't know where else to ask.\n\nTL;DR= is it weird to send a \"thank you\" gift to the former owner of my house?\n\nMy husband and I bought our first house at the end of October. It had been in the former owners family for apparently a very, very long time (the house is about 120 years old). The married couple we bought it from had lived here for 60 something years and it had been in the family before then. The husband died in April from an accident in the backyard. The wife moved out a couple of months afterward and according to her daughter she wasn't too willing to move out but understood it was \"too much house\" for her to care for on her own.\n\nIt's out of the family now but not too far out. A daughter of the former owners is my brother's mother in law.\n\nThe wife called me today to ask if she had been getting mail at the house. She had but we've been giving it back to the post carrier with the note that she no longer lived there. I got her new address and told her I'd give it to the carrier to see if they could help her do a change of address. \n\nMawmaw, that's what we call her and we refer to her late husband as Pawpaw, had been taking care of a stray cat for about 10 years now and we talked about him and how he waits for his food bowl in the sun on the sidewalk at the same time every day and meows loudly when he sees me come out to put the bowl back on the porch. She was really worried that whoever bought the house wouldn't take care of him the way she had, when we first looked at it we were told about Mr Cat and the expectations Mawmaw had for the new owners regarding his care. I text her pictures of him and the few other stray cats we've began feeding that I assume she had been feeding as well, but Mr Cat was her favorite. \n\nShe told me how much she loved that house and how she had so many happy memories there and that she prays my husband and I love it just the same. It kind of broke my heart. \n\nI've never met Mawmaw, today was the first time I had ever talked to her.

{"title": "My neighbors dog constantly barks and barks at me anytime I\u2019m in my yard. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.", "selftext": "This has been going on for about a year. My next door neighbors have 2 dogs (and recently got a puppy??!). The one dog is about a year old. They have another dog that is older. The 1 year old dog constantly barks at me and my fianc\u00e9 whenever we are outside. We live in square fenced in lots. \n\nIt barks at us when we\u2019re doing yard work, walking to our car, getting the mail, taking the trash out or having guests over. It barks all day inside it\u2019s house too and the homeowners leave their windows wide open. We work from home and hear it all day. The bark is scary and I feel like if the dog were able to get past the fence he would bite me. \n\nWe have tried talking to the neighbors about it and nothing has been done. They got mad at us the first time we talked to them because we stood in the driveway and waited for them to get the dog because it wouldn\u2019t stop barking at us. They told us to quit standing in our driveway just to irritate their dog. My fianc\u00e9 said he\u2019s allowed to stand in his driveway and shouldn\u2019t be barked at on his property. \n\nThey said they would get the dog fixed (I don\u2019t think they have), they installed a new wood fence so the dog can\u2019t see us but it\u2019s making the dog go more nuts, they used to zap it with a shock collar but gave up on it. The only thing they do is yell at the dog when it is barking for 15 minutes when they know we\u2019re outside and the dog doesn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s just barking more. (Sometimes the 1year old dog barks so much it makes the older dog bark)\n\nIf the neighbors know we aren\u2019t outside they don\u2019t get the dog to stop. They wait until they can see or hear us. \n\nThe last conversation we had with the neighbors was about a month ago. I was outside doing yard work and the dog wouldn\u2019t stop barking at me. My fianc\u00e9 goes over and knocks on the door. \n\nThe convo went like this:\n\nFianc\u00e9: can you please take your dog in he won\u2019t stop barking \n\nNeighbor: he only barks at you\n\nFianc\u00e9: actually I have been inside working. I came out to ask you to bring him him because he keeps barking at my fianc\u00e9e. \n\nNeighbor: oh well we\u2019re gonna get him fixed. \n\nConvo ended and she brought the dog in. I called the police non emergency number once but when they got here the dog wasn\u2019t barking anymore. \n\nWe don\u2019t know what to do anymore. And now they have a puppy. These people don\u2019t care about their animals and I just want this to stop. What should we do?\n\nEDIT: thank you for the advice. I ordered a dog barking deterrent device. I will look more into my city\u2019s ordinances. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s 15 minutes and you have to call the police. Our animal control doesn\u2019t do much. \n\nFor those telling me to throw treats over or go befriend the dog: I have been bit by dogs before (and I love dogs) and this dog\u2019s bark sounds similar to those of dogs that have bit me. I believe if I went over to meet it it would bite me. \n\nI also think giving it treats is going to condition it to keep barking to get treats. It\u2019s a smart dog. I don\u2019t think the owners will like it and will blame me/us for something if we\u2019re feeding it treats.

She said there isn't much she can do, but she cc'd the city manger for additional comment. She listened to my side of the story and was sympathetic. I told her I wanted to write to her so there would at least be a paper trail in case my neighbor escalates. She said that was a very good idea. I'm still kind of blown away that I got a response within 24 hours over having a shitty neighbor. I also stopped to really look at my neighbors yard. She's got 2 security camera pointed over my privacy fence. I don't know what she's expecting to see other than me in my pjs putzing in my garden or, you know, cleaning up my yard which I actually do. \n\n6 years ago I bought a house next to a Boomer daughter and her elderly mom. Pretty much since day 1 the daughter has not liked me. \n\nI can write a novel about our interactions and the number of times they have called the city on me because my \"yard is a mess\" or some other violation that turns out not to be a violation. They are the nosy neighbors of the block, but for some how really have it out for me. \n\nThings I have done to alleviate the situation : got cameras installed and put up a privacy fence that is just on the side of my house facing my crappy neighbors. Once I put up the privacy fence they stopped talking to me, but visits from the city about my grass being too high or something stupid has continued. \n\nToday, on a community fb page, the daughter made a post complaining about the weeds around my  garage. She posted that she talked to our mayor (wtf) and the mayor said that the fire department came out to look at my garage and that it didn't violate any city codes. The post was asking what to do about my yard. She posted pictures of my garage and part of my backyard on a semi-public fb page. \n\nFortunately, she got smoked by the commenters on the post. It made me feel like I wasn't going crazy. My yard is the yard of a woman that lives alone, works 40 hours a week, and has a lot of other shit to do. Commenters were calling her a Karen and someone even brought up that all she seems to do on the community page is complain. I reported the post for harassment and it was taken down (I took screenshots). \n\nI'm going to call the fire department after the holidays, but I already called them a couple years ago to complain about this lady. They said there isn't anything I can do unless they really come after me.

Where else is she posting this with pictures of my house and the general location of where I live? \n\nMy question... Is there actually anything I can legally do? Even if I made my yard as sterile and pristine has hers, she'd still find a way to call the city on me. I don't talk to her. I just want to be left alone. I have no good evidence to give a lawyer, and I highly doubt the mayor's office is going to be any help. \n\nI feel nervous to leave my house more than I did before.

{"title": "Neighbor with loud dogs confronted me about recording their dogs barking", "selftext": "tldr: my neighbor confronted me about recording their dogs' excessive barking today. I told them that they are welcome to do whatever they want with their dogs, but I will keep recording them long as they keep barking at me. Did I handle the situation appropriately? Do you have any other recommendations of things I can do to protect myself/not upset the neighbors further?\n\n\nWe bought our house last year in May, and part of the appeal of the home was the large shaded backyard, both for us and our dog to use. When we moved in, one of our neighbors had a dog that would occasionally bark at us along the fence line. Nbd, dogs bark and it wasn't a huge nuisance. We have a dog, and I totally understand that dogs bark sometimes. These neighbors haven't been friendly and have largely ignored any attempts to say hello or make friends. This is also fine, some neighbors aren't the friendly type.\n\nHowever, over the winter two new dogs were added to their household and now that it is spring the barking is excessive. Everytime the dogs are let out into the yard, they bark at us along the fence, even when we are on the other side of the yard. We have a 1/3 of an acre lot so the yard is pretty sizable and there is already a plant barrier between our yard that reduces the dogs' ability to see/hear our yard. The barking often goes on for several uninterrupted minutes at a time, and the only interruption is the neighbor yelling at the dogs from their window.  Once the neighbor isn't watching them anymore they go right back to barking at us. These dogs often also wake me up in the mornings due to barking in their yard.  As you might imagine, this has made spending time in the backyard for us and our dog much less pleasant. This is a huge bummer since we have been looking forward to utilizing the yard all winter long. Unfortunately, our garage is also on the side of the house that we share with these neighbors so everytime we use the garage, either to drive the car or get out and use yard tools/outdoor gear these dogs bark at us. \n\nI reached my breaking point a few weeks ago when I was trying to take a nap in my yard in my hammock and these dogs barked at me for a full 15 minutes before they were called back into the house. The city we live in has report tool for nuisance barking, which they define as \"frequent or habitual howling, yelping, barking, screeching, other vocalization or otherwise [which] shall cause serious annoyance or disturbance to persons in the vicinity\". Our city/county doesn't have specific time limits for barking before it's considered a nuisance, but they do ask that you submit any evidence or supporting documentation you have for your complaint. Due to this, I have started recording these dogs everytime they bark at me without interruption for more than a few minutes, so I can submit a complaint with documentation. Since these neighbors haven't been friendly and have avoided  and ignored our attempts to make friends, I made the call to not talk to them about the dogs before I started recording them. I admit, I may have been in the wrong with that, but I didn't want to put a target on my back. \n\nToday, I was recording the dogs barking at me while I was using my garage area, and the neighbor came out of their house and confronted me about recording their dogs barking. They were quite rude, and regrettably I didn't get the interaction on video since I wanted to try and be polite. This is the first time I have EVER talked to this neighbor. They essentially told me that 'dogs will be dogs' and that if I didn't like the barking I should go somewhere else. I don't agree and I don't think I should have to deal with being excessively barked at everytime I go to use my garage or my yard. I told them that they are welcome to do whatever they want with their dogs, but as long as they continue to bark at me while I'm using my yard or garage area, I will continue to record the dogs. \n\nDid I handle this correctly? Is there anything else you would recommend I do about this situation to protect myself? I do plan on continuing recording any instances of excessive barking, is that the wrong call?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/13d0yle/neighbor_with_loud_dogs_confronted_me_about/", "created_utc": 1683655214.0, "score": 357, "author": "caulifloury", "num_comments": 249, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/13d0yle/neighbor_with_loud_dogs_confronted_me_about/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Driver claimed I need to call Amazon because this path appeared on his gps. I called multiple times. Now this has been happening again, almost daily. Our driveway needs renovation, plus we have small children and want absolutely no one accessing our property. What can we do? Install gates? Would be expensive, any cheaper ways? Thanks!\n\nEdit: we made a call to Amazon again, they will send someone to acknowledge it as a private driveway. Also we requested to file damages to our driveway done by Amazon trucks driving through daily, since we noticed on our cameras they have been doing it every day even when they don\u2019t deliver to us. Also, I went to open street map.org and edited this pathway as no access and fence in a way. I noticed that it was added there by Amazon logistics. I emailed them as well (the email was under their profile) letting them know no access allowed. We ordered more signs (from Amazon haha) to place them at the end of each driveway and we are still considering placing more obstacles that they won\u2019t be able to move (we place bikes but they move them out of way). Thanks everyone for your comments and recommendations. Hopefully it will be resolved soon!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/13pwqft/how_to_stop_amazon_using_our_driveway_as_communal/", "created_utc": 1684866965.0, "score": 347, "author": "sunshine451456", "num_comments": 238, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/13pwqft/how_to_stop_amazon_using_our_driveway_as_communal/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Do it now when you\u2019re not stuck, and can spend some time learning about each company who you trust and want to hire.

Have projects in mind, but remember that surprise projects pop up constantly, so leave room in your long term schedule to tackle the other stuff you don\u2019t know is coming.\n\n**Get A Few Basic Gadgets**\n\nThere\u2019s things I never thought I\u2019d need, but it turns out I use them constantly.

This is probably less important since our phones have flashlights on them, but I keep a lantern in a couple places on each floor of the house.\n\n**Keep A Good Relationship With Your Realtor**\n\nThink you bought your house and now you\u2019re done with them? Maybe that\u2019s the case, but maybe not. Realtors (good ones, anyway) are super knowledgeable about all things home-owning. Have a question about your title and don\u2019t know who to turn to? Your realtor will probably be able to guide you. A good realtor will be able to connect you to other services you might need help with.\n\nThat being said, some realtors are only out to get their commission and be done with you now that you own a house. They\u2019d be wrong, since being in your network means you\u2019ll be able to recommend them when your friends and family are buying.\n\n**Take Photos Of Everything**\n\nAre you doing a project? Take photos all along the way. This might seem silly, but it\u2019s come in handy for me. For instance, I had a bathtub leak, and after fixing it, I closed up the ceiling and repainted so it was looking brand new. One year later, that fucking tub leaked again. Because I had taken photos of all the plumbing in the ceiling before closing it up, I already knew where all the pipes were before having to open it up again. Plus, the plumber that came out the second time (of course I did not bring back the first one), was super appreciative because he could see everything in the ceiling clearly in the pictures.\n\n**Keep A List Of Products You\u2019re Using**\n\nAgain, this might be a little overboard, but find a way to keep track of things you\u2019re using. For instance, if you buy some rubber edging for around your garden, just write down the brand somewhere. In two years when you clip it with your mower and need to replace it and go back to \\[store\\] and find they don\u2019t carry it anymore, you\u2019ll be able to Google easily and find the same item somewhere else.\u00a0\n\nThis is especially good for paint and paint colors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope these help at least someone out there!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/mda6x1/what_ive_learned_as_a_homeowner/", "created_utc": 1616711376.0, "score": 349, "author": "cpclemens", "num_comments": 113, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/mda6x1/what_ive_learned_as_a_homeowner/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Winter is Coming... Again", "selftext": "It's been a few years since I made this post. Moved further up north, and became a parent so my list has evolved a bit! Today's high was in the 50's so I figured it was the perfect day to post this. I live in a 4 season climate and as the weather gets cooler it is a great reminder of fall tasks that need, should, and would be nice to do prior to winter's arrival. Here are some things that I thought of that need to be done if you live somewhere that gets cold winters:\n\n1. Remove (and drain) hoses from any outdoor faucets & store them if you want\n2. Turn off water to outside spigots & open spigot\u00a0\n3. Buy ice melt before you need it- if you have pets (& kids) make sure it is pet safe & stored properly\n4. Check your gutters for leaves & debris that could collect water and freeze, cracking the gutters\n5. Test that your furnace & thermostat work before you need to turn them on for those winter days\n6. Insulate outdoor pipes & spigots, or ones in your garage.\n7. If you have a sprinkler system winterize it.\n8. Check your winter gear (coats, boots, gloves, etc), make sure it is in usable condition, and if you have kids that you have the proper sizes for them.\n9. If it isn\u2019t really obvious, remove any window AC units you may have\n\nHere are some things you should do but are not must do's:\n\n1. Get insulating faucet covers for your outdoor faucets\n2. Check your windows and doors for drafts- caulk windows, and weatherstrip doors that need it\n3. Reverse any ceiling fans - DUST FIRST\n4. Check downspouts for potential ice puddles in the future and reroute any potential hazards (can be as simple as buying those gutter tubes, doesn't have to be a big project)\n5. Clean your chimney if you have one\n6. Prep your lawn care items for storage- Use up the gas for your lawn mower/leaf blower/etc. before putting it in storage\n7. Test your snow blower, move your shovels & snow melt to the front of your storing area for easy access\n8. Put kitty litter in your car in case you get stuck somewhere\n9. Lubricate garage doors, and windows if metal\n\nHere are some would be nice/beneficial if you decide to do:\n\n1. Prep your landscaping, lay fall fertilizer, trim back shrubs and other plants (particularly bulbed plants), plant future bulbed plants you want in the Spring.\n2. Place bubblewrap in unused windows for extra insulation (don't put it anywhere you want to see clearly out the window)\n   1. You can also buy those plastic window kits but I find they don't work, or they leave residue on the windows. But some people swear by them!\n\n1. Test all outdoor lightbulbs and replace ones that aren't working\n2. Insulate outlets if your house is old/drafty-yes outlets can cause drafts\n3. If you know you have poor insulation in your attic, now is a great time to tackle it!\n4. Put any lawn items (patio sets, fire pits, etc.) in storage/a shed to prevent weather damage\n5. Finish up those yard projects you haven't gotten around to because it's been too hot, or nice, or busy to complete them.\n6. Extra foam pipe insulation around areas in unfinished basements\n7. Change/check your furnace filter if you have one\n\n  \nI think that covers it! What do you do to prep your home for the winter? What's that one thing you forgot once that you'll never forget again?

I've lived here for 6 months now and it's been the worst so far now that spring is here and there are lawncare vehicles out and about with trailers and heavy machinery. It's not only them, it's also delivery vehicles and big moving trucks.\n\nThere are three signs before the end of the street that clearly state No Outlet/Dead End. Yet, people still drive all the way down. The street literally ends in nothing but forest. There have NEVER been homes, businesses, or even a hint of another road beyond it, so it's not like this was ever a shortcut to anywhere. I'd understand if these vehicles were trying to get to the houses on the end, but they never are. My driveway is twice the size of my neighbors' and is a couple hundred feet long, which is why I assume they keep choosing mine to turn around in. There is a space at the end of the street, not quite a culdesac, but enough room for most vehicles to turn around comfortably, yet they choose to stop before they get there and back into my property.\n\nThe driveway and my property are getting damaged now. It was refinished before I bought the house to an extent, it still could use some work, and now I understand that it was probably done by the previous homeowners because of the same issue. They back up and ram their trailers up the curb and chip away the edge of the asphalt. I can't get grass to grow in the spot between the drive and the mailbox because they're always running it over as well. I've had to replace 6 of my solar lights already. The last straw was late afternoon yesterday when I had my car parked closer to the end to bring some new landscaping materials to the front beds easier. A big blue truck with a giant trailer came barreling down the street. He went all the way to the end, but instead of using that free space to turn around, he put it in reverse and backed up all the way to my driveway and then started backing his trailer into it, nearly hitting my car. When he realized he wouldn't fit, he moved over and used part of my driveway and the neighbor's yard instead.\n\nI've tried reasoning with the fact that the signs should be enough, but they clearly aren\u2019t. What can I do to help stop this without blocking access to my driveway?\n\n**Edit:** [Slightly more context in a comment here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k55rcg/comment/mogptcu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k55rcg/how_do_i_get_people_to_stop_using_my_driveway_as/", "created_utc": 1745326971.0, "score": 347, "author": "Aerynage", "num_comments": 376, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1k55rcg/how_do_i_get_people_to_stop_using_my_driveway_as/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

We finally got around to moving it about a year ago and discovered a large gap between bottom of the wall and floor. You can see into the crawl space. As the year went on, the top wall on the second floor, directly above the piano area is separating from the ceiling. \n\nThis week, we had 3 contractors come to take a look. First guy says it\u2019s just floor joists and quotes $8k. Second guy comes and suggests getting some drainage system in the wet spots and says they will have to rip our flooring up to get underneath the house. He quotes $12k. Third guy is extremely thorough. He says our foundation is crumbling and if we had a basement, it would have collapsed already. The footing is sinking and someone tried to stabilize it with cinder blocks, but placed the blocks directly on mud, so they are sinking or crumbling. Our crawl space is filled with mold. He says to do it right, it will cost $120k. He thinks we should just bulldoze it. \nWe bought our house for 120k. This is our first home. We bought it at 21 years old and just are not cut out for these expenses. I quit my job a couple weeks ago, not knowing this would be thrown at us.

He genuinely had no idea it was this bad.\n\nEDIT: I so greatly appreciate all of the thoughts and advice each one of you gave. I\u2019m really glad I posted here and it has helped ease my concerns. I know my fianc\u00e9 will feel a bit relieved to read these too. We will get some more opinions for sure. I have an engineer friend I will reach out to for a reliable structural engineer to come take a look. I\u2019m going to check around and see if someone more knowledgeable on mold will tell me what we\u2019re up against ASAP so we can get that cleaned out. Future us will be more present during inspection and have a better idea what to look for ourselves. Again, thank you guys so much for your words. You\u2019ve truly been a great help on my mental. \n\nSide note on my uncle. I\u2019m just not going to go there. I\u2019m going to give him a call and talk to him about it because it\u2019s something he\u2019d want to know anyway, but I know he put a lot of work into this house while he lived here and he has offered many times over the years to pay for certain things to be fixed or to help us update other things he didn\u2019t get to.

{"title": "Buying a house and then trying to buy furniture is such a soul sucking adventure.", "selftext": "We bought a house just over a year ago, and prior to that we moved around nearly every year for over a decade. After that many moves and knowing another would mostly certainly come around again in the following year, we came into our house with next to no furniture that wasn\u2019t just easily collapsible or movable. We pack light & keep our stuff minimal. The heaviest thing we had was a mattress! \n\nNow that we are living somewhere we plan to be for a while, we are trying to actually work towards enjoying our space. I am baffled on how people do this regularly to have a fully furnished house so quickly. This process sucks my soul. \n\nWe don\u2019t have an abundance of furniture stores around here for new stuff. Any we do is quadruple the price for cheaply made garbage. More stores are hours away, no delivery available right now. Since we are wary of buying at big box stores with over priced furniture that is made cheaply, so we primarily prowl thrift stores, garage sales, online community market spaces, estate sales and various vendor market booth type places to get reasonably priced stuff that won\u2019t fall apart right away. A bonus of keeping things out of the landfill too!\n\nIt takes forever to find something that looks decent. And then hope to be the first person to try and buy. Find something we like? We have a tiny car. So we\u2019ll need to rent a truck. We have no friends or family with a large vehicle. But no trucks are available that day, and sellers won\u2019t hold it. Or if they will hold it, we don\u2019t have an abundance of people in life who will come help lift furniture for beer and pizza like so many people suggest.

This normally wouldn't be an issue, except for the fact that its melted our patio furniture. Admittedly, our furniture is plastic/wicker, but it's literally scorched.\n\nUpon discovering this, I investigated during the time the reflection occurs and found it was incredibly hot.

I let them know I knew this was a headache for them and that I'm looking into ideas that may mitigate the issue on our side, but also asked if they'd be open to putting up screens or film on the offending window at my cost.\n\nThe owner outright rejected the idea, stating at one point it's not \"his problem\".

{"title": "Elderly neighbor insists on mowing our lawn. How would you handle this situation?", "selftext": "My husband and I purchased our first home late last summer in a friendly neighborhood. Many of our neighbors have lived in their houses for decades, are retired, and welcomed us with letters and baked goods when we first moved in last September.  Our house is a bit of a fixer upper, which is exactly what we were looking for. We couldn\u2019t afford to buy a \u201cperfect house\u201d and we\u2019re excited to slowly make the place our own. It\u2019s been a lot of work so far and has been a bit exhausting, but we enjoy doing it. \nLate last summer, I was mowing our lawn with our electric push mower when one of the batteries completely died. I was almost done mowing our lawn, so it looked a little silly. Our 83 year old neighbor John came over and insisted on mowing our lawn for us with his riding mower. I thanked him and told him it was such a kind offer, but that he didn\u2019t have to, but he insisted. Then his wife came running over frantically yelling at him not to mow our lawn because he had just had heart surgery and the doctor wanted him to take it easy. This caused our other neighbor to come over to see what the ruckus was and he offered to let me borrow his push mower to finish up my yard, but I felt really embarrassed and shameful about the whole situation. Shortly after, John and his wife moved to Florida for the winter and returned later this spring.\nFast forward to this year, and John saw me mowing our lawn again and insisted that he never wants to see our mower again because he\u2019ll do it for us. He said that we\u2019re young (we\u2019re in our late 20s) and should be enjoying our free time instead of doing yard work. I told him that he really doesn\u2019t have to, but he insisted and told us he really wanted to help us. Since then, he\u2019s been mowing our lawn every week - most of the time when we are gone for work. He also has been cleaning up pine needles in our driveway and other minor yard work tasks. Today, he didn\u2019t get the chance to mow our lawn until after we got home from work and started making dinner. My husband walked out and thanked him, but now I feel even more guilty and don\u2019t want to eat dinner or relax while he is out doing OUR yard work. He intentions are really kind, and he insists that it\u2019s not a big deal because it only takes him 30 minutes to mow our lawn and he has plenty of time since he\u2019s retired, but it makes me feel really uncomfortable. I think he really wants to help us, and this is the only way he physically can, however, I cannot relax knowing he\u2019s doing our work for us.  We are perfectly capable of mowing our lawn and I actually really enjoy it.  I feel concerned that our other neighbors may look at us differently or like we\u2019re lazy when they see John is mowing our lawn, and I don\u2019t want John to get hurt doing something he doesn\u2019t have to do on our property.\nHow would you handle this situation? Would you let John continue to mow your lawn since he insists or would you be more direct and tell him to stop?\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate everyone taking the time to give us advice. We\u2019re going to let John continue to mow our lawn and show our gratitude by inviting them over for dinner periodically. I think I learned a great lesson in accepting help from others and appreciating the community I live in from you all. My husband and I, while friendly with our neighbors, haven\u2019t made much of an effort to get to know them since we\u2019ve moved in. I hope we can extend the good deeds forward to John and our other neighbors too and make some good friends along the way.

{"title": "Previous homeowners' and their family passed away, living adult child lurking around house", "selftext": "W closed on a house in January 2020.  The previous owners were a couple in their 60's, who lived with both their ex-spouses, who were remarried to each other.  Living in the house at the time of the closing were both couples, two adult sons, a daughter-in-law, and their two collective grandkids.  Not sure how they all fit in a three bedroom with a bonus room, but they made it work.  They were actually a very cool group, my wife and I met them a few times around town.  They apparently renting a huuuge house on the lake a few neighborhoods over, and all living together, sons, grandkids and all.  We bought the house partially furnished.\n\nCome to find out in early January from a neighbor that all nine passed away since the end of 2020 within the span of like three months, six in a car accident, and three from health issues. My wife and I are pretty vigilant with staying at home, so we haven't had much of a chance to interact with our neighbors up until now.\n\nIt freaked my wife out pretty bad, we started having random people showing up to the house, checking up trying to pay their respects, not realizing the house had sold.  We started receiving condolence letters and gifts most addressed to their only surviving child, a daughter we hadn't met but have heard other neighbors talk about.\n\nWe've been passing over the mail to a neighbor who is a mutual friend of the daughter, who has apparently tried to reach out to extended family and friends that the house sold, given the post office a forwarding address, but we still manage to receive some form of condolence mail every three/four days.\n\nOn Monday, the daughter of the previous homeowners showed up at our doorstep, sans mask, asking us if it would be alright to arrange for her to walk through the house at some point before the end of May and take photos of some of the murals on the wall (some we have yet to paint over), and have a bit of time to 'say goodbye'.  I told her I would get back to her on a day that works for us at some point this week, but in truth, my wife doesn't feel comfortable having anyone in our home or taking photos of it.  Partially due to covid, partially for privacy reasons.  The daughter is staying with the family who lives across the street for a few weeks, arranging a memorial for her family. \n\nAccording to neighbors she's a flight attendant who lives abroad and it took her a bit to coordinate entering the country and to take time off work to come and take care of all of this.\n\nShe has spent everyday this week sitting on various neighbors' porches on our cul-de-sac staring at our house for hours, virtually from sun up to sun down.  My wife found her on the patio of the house directly behind us this afternoon, possibly looking into our house, staring.  We've seen her on our doorbell camera approach the house three times this week, almost ring the door and then turn away.\n\nMy wife is deeply disturbed about hearing nearly the entire family who lived in the house has been wiped out, and she's deeply disturbed by their daughter 'surveying' our house.  I'm not going to lie, it's been weird.  I'm pretty sure her intentions are harmless, I can't imagine what she's going through, but I have no idea how to handle this situation.\n\nYesterday we got an email from our nextdoor neighbor, with a list of items we purchased with the home the daughter is requesting we allow her to purchase from us.  It includes some boxes that were in the basement (some we've already tossed), a few pieces of furniture, a few paintings, and the china set the previous owners left behind. Edit: I should mention, our next door neighbors are her (step?) cousins.  We're pretty sure the family across the street may also be extended family.  Not sure on that one.   \n\nI told them she's welcome to have the china set, all the personal items left behind,  and paintings.  I left them on the neighbor she's staying with's front porch.  I don't know how to tell her she can't walk through the house, and she can't have the furniture.\n\nWe've grown pretty attached to it. They're antique pieces that my wife has pretty much designed the interior of our home around.  The prices the daughter offered don't come close to the worth of the furniture.  I don't know I feel like an asshole, I'm sure she's devastated, but I'm close to confronting her about the staring.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/my0z5k/previous_homeowners_and_their_family_passed_away/", "created_utc": 1619325662.0, "score": 337, "author": "None", "num_comments": 188, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/my0z5k/previous_homeowners_and_their_family_passed_away/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "High Water Bills (update)", "selftext": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/dmp7yr)\n\nTo summarize my issue,  I moved into a home this past summer and have been receiving water bills ranging from 200-900 dollars a month. After having them investigate it they concluded no leak exists and my wife and I just use a ton of water.\n\nI am happy to state that the above is actually NOT true and that they did in fact screw up. After obsessively analyzing my water use for few months without any success in finding the culprit, I decided to analyze my water bill with a fine tooth comb. I compared the serial number of the meter they had in there and it did indeed match my water meter but one thing I did notice off was the before and after meter readings written on my bill didn't match the actual meter readings on the device. The bill had the before and after readings in the 220s cubic foot range but my actual meter was only in the 180s. When I opened up my neighbors meter, theirs was however in the 220s. What seemed to have happened was that although my water meter continuously transmits data wirelessly to the department, some guy does occasional walk throughs to make sure the actual meter matches the wirelessly transmitted data. Apparently he looked at my neighbors meter and reported that the actual meter was 220 something and that the wireless data transmitted were wrong and they need to manually adjust it and bill me appropriately. Apparently this caused their system to somehow read that I was using a shitton of water every month and sending me ridiculous bills. \n\nThank you thank you to everyone that pushed me to analyze my meter more carefully as if I hadn't , I would've never found this and forced the water Dept to come back out and look at it again . When the inspector came out and realized it, he simply said yup you're right. Good thing you called. I got refunded around 1500k and the following months bill was a whopping 60 bucks.

{"title": "Neighbor wants me to sign away my access rights", "selftext": "Sorry, I'm still fairly new to home ownership and need help understanding a certain topic that keeps coming up.  \n\nWe bought an older home a year ago, which is our first home ever.  Our neighbor next to us owns a lot of acerage(100+) and is selling it with his house. For the last year, he's been trying to get us to sign over our access rights to his property.  The title company briefly mentioned access rights when signing paperwork, but they didn't make a big deal out of it. I had to look at the deed again to see what neighbor was talking about. I guess a long time ago, the owners of our house got access rights to a natural spring on his property. It also states he must maintain the spring, but to be fair the jargon is unclear to me in what exactly he is responsible for.  Since, we've bought the house he's made a trip over once a month to try to get us to sign them away (for free).  \n\nFor the record, we've never been to his property much less try to access the natural spring there.  We have no interest in ever going on his property.  We keep to ourselves. To add to this people in town (its a small town) have mentioned he often tries to scam people out of things, and convinced our other neighbor with dementia to sign over some property rights himself. Neighbor's adult children spoke to us about this incident. \n\nAnyway, I honestly just want him to stop coming over, and bringing this topic up.  I've tried to be nice because I don't want drama with my neighbors.  He's been trying to sell his property over 4x the average square footage cost in the area, and claims that by us not signing access rights over he can't sell his property.  Would it be worth it to just contact the title company and see what's going on? I really have no interest in messing around with deeds if it's not necessary.  This last time he came over he said that 'he would even throw in some money to help is if we would sign our access away. ' Is there really any value in access rights? Still trying to figure out his motive behind it all.  Thank you for any advice!\n\nEdit: I think it's clear the answer here is to get a lawyer, which we will be doing!

I found a company that I THINK I like, and they came by yesterday morning to cut open a hole in the drywall and fix the pipe. \n\nI was going to be paying them $250 for the repair, but it wasn't until he showed up that morning when he said \"by the way, I'll be putting the square that we cut back in, but we don't do drywall repair or patching\" Which pissed me off. Seems like a weird thing to leave out of a $250 job, but again, I don't know what's considered normal for jobs like this.

We are in a cul de sac that has a roundabout like thing in the middle (it's just trees). There is a neighbor who has several cars (7+ at all times). And park at least 4 of them around the roundabout at all times. Two of these cars are in front of our house and make it difficult for us to back in to our drive way. We asked the neighbors to the right of us about it and they don't seem to want to be involved which is fine but they told us we have to put our garbage bins out at the end of the round about for collection instead of in front of our house because\n...the trucks can't get in the round about because of all the cars! Both cars parked in front of our house have expired tabs and just sit there. As of right now they have cars on both ends of the round about as well and almost made it so l couldn't park my car last night and the moving truck was very difficult to get in.\n\n\nWe don't want to cause problems. We don't want to start a fight with our neighbors especially when we just moved in. If we call the cars in for illegally parking they will know it was us.

They are also not from here so there may be some language barrier. \n\n\nWe don't care how many cars they have, but they need to park them somewhere else. Especially if they aren't in use. \n\n\n\n\nEdit: It seems some people feel I may have left out how these cars are parked incorrectly. The following are from a combination of my city and state wide codes:\n\n\n1. No person shall stop, stand, or park a vehicle on a street, highway, roadway, alley, or public property unless the vehicle possesses a license plate and license tab registration that is proper and current for that vehicle. Such license plate and tab registration shall be properly mounted on the vehicle in accordance with the State Department of Licensing rules and regulations.  (City)\n\n\n\n2. No person shall stop, place, or park a vehicle at any place where official signs, curbs, or pavement markings prohibit parking, or within 15 feet of a fire hydrant, or at any place for which the vehicle does not have a valid parking permit. Any vehicle not parked in a parking stall shall be considered illegally parked. (One vehicle is currently parked on a red curb. Two others sit right on each end of the painted curb. This is also the location we are being forced to place our bins due the cars so now we cant do that lol) (State) \n\n\n\n3. Alongside or adjacent to any traffic island, which is the curbed area in a roadway from which traffic is excluded. (Depending on how a cul de sac island is defined this may apply here) (City)\n\n\n\nUPDATE 6/14: Parking enforcement came by and gave tickets/warnings to a couple of the vehicles.

One of the first things our nextdoor neighbor mentions when we moved in is that the contractor who renovated our house ruined his retention holding in the soil under his driveway.  We brushed it off because we don\u2019t want to be liable for anything if we help him fix it.  I just told him I don\u2019t know anything about foundations and asked if he knew a good contractor to consult with.\n\nBetween our house and his driveway was a shitty old chain link fence that had plastic slats falling out all over the place.  Fast forward to now, we decided to replace it with a nice cedar fence.  To be neighborly, I called our neighbor to ask his permission.  He thought I was calling to ask for money to help with it.  I told him no, I was just letting him know and he was all for it.  \n\nThe fence was just completed and it looks great.  It comes down to the surface of our yard and is as high on his side as the previous fence.  The neighbor is not happy, he does not like that it comes down to our yard.  He wants it higher so \u201cwe\u201d (as in us and him, probably more us) can put a foundation down and fix the erosion under his driveway.  He even told me I need to call our fencing contractor and have him raise it.\n\nThe way my wife and I see it, the fence is on our property.  The driveway is his property and his issue.  He has had plenty of time to do something about it instead of pressuring me and my wife to fix it for him.  We believe he sees us as pushovers because we\u2019re a young couple new to the neighborhood.  Also there is a foot gap between our fence and his driveway.  We think there\u2019s plenty of room to figure out a solution like to dig down and pour some cement or use concrete foam,  etc. \n\nI want a way to politely tell him we like the fence how it is, we aren\u2019t raising it or moving it, and we are willing to help him find a solution for his driveway.

He agreed, and that he wanted one as well. \n\nLate fall last year I reached out to him and told him my plans to build next spring (now) and that I would like to put it as close to the property line as possible, thus he would need to move the stuff. I even offered to haul all of it away. He told me he would get it, no problem.\n\nFast forward to now, I just texted him that I was going to be building the fence at the end of May.

I feel like his agent might have \"taken\" the items he left", "selftext": "I just moved into a house in BC, Canada.\n\nI wrote a personal letter to the the previous owner during the bid because I really appreciated how he decorated the place and how much I like the neighborhood. After I won the bid, the owner even threw in a huge dinning table set and we amended our contract to include it. This was of course communicated through the two real estate agents between us. I never met him nor do I have his contact.\n\nSo yesterday the seller agent got the keys and asked us to meet her at the house at 11:30am the next day. When we got there, there was two guys moving furniture still and the seller agent made us wait 2 hours until it was done. This was very suspicious as the seller agent never mentioned a last minute move. The seller agent says the two guys were \"the previous owner's friends\" that was helping him move last min. Strange, she got the keys to the house and was ready to hand over the keys at 11:30. The seller's agent handed us the keys after the movers were done and she left herself.\n\nWhen I went in to inspect the house with my agent, we found the dinning table was missing. We called the seller agent right away and she said the owner wanted to take everything. That's very odd. We reminded her that it was in the contract. Then she gave us the contact of one of the movers who we assumed was the previous owner (never met him). 1 hour later, one of the movers comes back with the dinning table and it turns out he has no relation with the previous owner. We asked him who he was but he just said ask the seller's agent.\n\nNow my realtor agent and myself think what happened was the seller agent went to inspect the house just before the keys hand off and saw that the previous owner left a lot of nice furniture. She then called her friends, the two movers, to come and take it all. We wouldn't even have known if the dinning table wasn't included in our contract.\n\nThe seller agent is not being cooperative and says she can't reveal her client's information. I would just like to contact the previous owner and make sure that the last minute move was something he was aware of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Will ask lawyer if we can contact the previous owner's lawyer to ask a question.

Thanks Reddit for your help! \n\n\n\n\n I bought my southern CA house back in 2016, knowing the 1950s era pipes would need to be replaced soon.

Desperate, I called a plumber (who came recommended by a friend of mine, another new homeowner...and also, as I realize now, an idiot.)

A smell starts brewing from somewhere in my kitchen plumbing. Thinking it's the dishwasher, I replace the old appliance and hire a different plumber to install it and check on my kitchen pipes. Imagine my horror when he emerges from the crawlspace to tell me -- the smell was mold and wood rot, because my washing machine was not hooked up to a drain pipe. The 2016 plumber had taken out the old cast iron pipe that was there... AND HADN'T INSTALLED A NEW ONE. The machine had been draining directly into the dirt under my kitchen SINCE 2016. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm furious with myself for letting the first plumber anywhere near my house. I'm paying $7k to fix the pipe and moisture damage....as well as re-doing various other bits the original plumber did not complete to code. (90\u00b0 bends in the pipe, weird angles, etc.) I'm not a plumber and had no idea about any of this until the new guy showed me pictures. Ugh.\n\nAt this point, the warranty on the first guys work is long expired. I'm considering legal action, but not sure where to begin or if it would even be worth it.

He drilled into my chimney and put it up while I was at work without permission. If he were to get a dog or place a lock I would never be able to get to that side of the house. \n\nI called and spoke with the city assessor and he said they don\u2019t have any land plats for our houses and to look for the spikes in the ground (no metal detector), and the city inspector told us he is in violation and has to move it but we have to agree on the line on where it is placed. \n\nAfter the inspector told him he had to remove it he started to threaten me every afternoon after I got home from work. Started saying crap like he was going to make my life miserable every day until I move, told the neighbors (who were trying to diffuse the argument) lies that I smoke weed and he was gonna call the police the next time he smelled it (I don\u2019t smoke weed, no reason to lie to random internet people). It\u2019s becoming very hard to not beat the shit out of him as he\u2019s just a really skinny little twerp with a hipster beard and twirled mustache making big threats. \n\nThe neighbor says I only get 3 feet from the most recessed area of my wall, but my grass extends out all the way to his driveway as well as the concrete on my side of the house. \n\n\nSince were blocked off this was the only picture we could take of his gate. https://i.imgur.com/lwBiAGi.jpg\n\nAnd help would be appreciated determining a line.

When I walked in, it looked beautiful, cleanly done, etc. My real estate agent agreed with me that it was done well.

The inspector also thought the issues weren't a big deal when I spoke with him. Fast forward to 2 months after I've moved into the place and this is the list of additional problems I've run into so far:\n\n\\- New window well in basement bedroom installed incorrectly, leaks water into basement, ruins carpet and needs to be thrown away. Also friable asbestos containing tile found underneath the carpet, needs to be removed safely if I want to waterproof basement.\n\n\\- Gutters leaky all around, have to replace all around house\n\n\\- House has hydronic heating through radiators - drywall/paint is cracking all along several of them\n\n\\- Baseboards coming up from the floors\n\n\\- Tile around one of the toilets moves when you step on it\n\n\\- Attic fan (which is the only cooling system in the house) trips the breaker if it's on for more than 10 seconds\n\n\\- Tile from kitchen backsplash falling off wall\n\n\\- Fridge overheating because enclosure that it's fit between is too small \n\n\\- Air gap installed with dish washer, but it doesn't lead to the sink, instead it spits out the water in the cabinet underneath the sink (luckily I caught it before it became an electrical problem)\n\n\\- Toilet with small sewage leakage - always smells funky in there\n\n\\- When I had the pitch on the shower shelf fixed, we found that no moisture barrier was installed behind the tile. Also suspected that might be the case for the other shower and yup I'm going to have to have both of those completely redone now.\n\n\\- Several overhead lights have already gone out. My electrician friend says that they probably don't have the right transformers\n\n\\- Sump pump for washing machine installed incorrectly into it's basin, started spraying water all over the boiler room when I used it the first time.\n\n\\- Garage door stopped working within a week of being there.\n\n\\- Sprinkler system with several broken pipes - have to replace. But in the meantime I'm just going to do it manually and hope my grass doesn't die.\n\n\\- One single 15A circuit for a 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms - if you plug in two blow dryers, cuts the breaker\n\nThere's probably a few other things I've missed, but you get the picture. On top of that, most contractors around me are booked out for several weeks so it's difficult to have any of the things fixed anytime soon.

{"title": "Neighbor mounted camera ~20 feet high pointed at my backyard and living room windows ", "selftext": "Hi,\n\n\nSo I've been dealing with my next door neighbor who's been harassing me and spying on me watching me and my wife's every move. He's on the neighborhood watch and thinks everything he does is justified. For example, he installed a 360 camera pointed at my front yard so he knows when my wife and I leave or enter our house.  Also To harass us, he installed a ultra bright 7000 lumen floodlight 20 feet high on his roof line to light up our entire backyard and also light up our living room through the windows. I tried talking to him about it and he said he would move it but never did anything. I eventually called the city and it took them months but they got him to take it down recently.  Days after he took down the floodlight he replaced it with a 360 swivel camera in the same location (20 feet high) somewhat concealed pointed directly at our backyard. I can see the camera and the camera lens from my living room windows as well. I am in California. Is this legal? What can i do? \n\n\nSome more context: \n\nWe have a shared brick fence with a privacy extension on my neighbors side that makes it about ~6 feet tall. To provide even more privacy and some relief from the floodlight before it was taken down, over the last 4 weeks I was getting quotes from many fence contractors to add a privacy wall on our side of the property line thats 8 feet tall without touching the existing shared fence. Since he's always spying on me, he goes outside or opens his patio door or windows to listen to what I'm saying to the fence contractors. Also,  he swivels the 360 camera pointing at my front yard and points it at me in my backyard. He also comes out of his house and stands there and stares at me while in with the contractors. After he heard that i am planning to add an 8 ft privacy wall, he decided to extend his topper on his side by 6 inches or so and then after he was forced to take the down the floodlight, he mounted the new camera and it's so high ( roughly 20 feet)  it doesn't matter how high I make my fence he will still be able to look into my entire back yard and living room windows. I'm pretty confident he did that on purpose knowing that my privacy wall will only be 8 feet and i won't be able to block his camera.

{"title": "I finally had a dishwasher installed and it's brought me so much joy", "selftext": "I bought a house in September and I didn't notice that it didn't have a dishwasher. I've never lived in a place without one and since it's the 90s it didn't even cross my mind that I needed to check.\n\nHaving just bought a new set of dishes, I went to throw them in the wash when it dawns on me that not only is there not a dishwasher, but in this tiny, 55 sq ft kitchen that houses a washer and dryer on one side, a small 7 ft counter with a sink on the other, and an electric stove on the other wall,  there isn't even room to add a dishwasher. \n\nTo make matters worse, the sink is one of the smallest sinks I've ever seen. Later I would find the model number on the bottom and Google it to learn that in fact it was a sink designed for an RV. Some of my bigger cookware pieces won't even fit in it. And the whole thing is full halfway through cooking dinner.\n\nSo I buy a dishrack and resign myself to hand washing dishes. That takes up all the space to the left of the sink.\n\nNow I have about 3 feet of usable space for prep, and it's right up against the stove in the corner, so there's basically no way to comfortably stand while cooking.\n\nI dealt with this for about 4 months before it just became too much for me. It made me not want to cook, because any cooking would require an extra 30 mins for washing dishes, which would create even more mess to clean up as water splashed all over the place, including all over the lower cabinets. \n\nIf I had a lazy day where I didn't feel like doing dishes, I would have a full sink by the end of the day, and it made my already tiny kitchen unusable.\n\n\nSo I hatched a plan and it finally all came together this week.\n\nStep one was getting rid of the top load washer and dryer and replacing them with a stackable setup. I ended up going with a washtower from LG.  The downside here was that I had to lose a cabinet above where the dryer sat previously. I bought a credenza type thing for the dining room and now use that to store some of my kitchen stuff, no big deal.\n\nStep two was figuring out the plumbing. I had a couple plumbers come take a look and both said that a new, bigger drain would be a good idea because newer washers expel water pretty quickly and my small drain could overflow, especially if it was shared with the dishwasher. I'd also need to run water for the dishwasher, and have a shutoff valve in the kitchen if I wanted to be safe.\n\nStep 3: get a cabinet for a dishwasher.  This part proved to be a bit more tricky that I expected. Evidently the idea of a standalone dishwasher cabinet is sort of a rare thing, as it's expected dishwashers will just get built into existing cabinetry. \n\nI went to a couple cabinet places to see about getting a custom piece built, but even the ones who said they'd be interested in doing it gave me a months long turnaround time. And I did not want to wait months more. At this point, I'd basically stopped cooking because the process was so time consuming and miserable.\n\nSo to combat this I bought a butchers block from home depot, did a fairly shit job sealing it, and had a handy man just build the framework to house the dishwasher.\n\nStep four was the dishwasher itself. It actually arrived a month ago and had just been sitting in the kitchen while I tried to work out the cabinet. When that was finished I texted the plumber (who knew how excited I was about the washer and how I miserable I was hand washing) and he literally showed up an hour later to finish running the water lines and get the appliance hooked up.\n\nTwo hours after that I cooked a Jamaican  jerk chicken dinner using all the dishes I'd been avoiding using because of cleaning difficulty, loaded them up in this low-mid level Whirlpool, and hit the sensor cycle.\n\nThe next morning they all came out spotless and my kitchen finally felt like it was mine \ud83d\ude42.\n\nNext up is trying to replace the tiny sink with something a bit more substantial, but that will be a while because this was not an inexpensive project.\n\nWashtower: $1700\n\nDishwasher: $500\n\nButcher block: $200\n\n\nCabinet install + parts: $500\n\nPlumbing: $800\n\n\n\nTotal: $3700\n\nEnjoying using my kitchen: priceless", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/u5ogiy/i_finally_had_a_dishwasher_installed_and_its/", "created_utc": 1650206607.0, "score": 324, "author": "Mentalpopcorn", "num_comments": 76, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/u5ogiy/i_finally_had_a_dishwasher_installed_and_its/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}
{"title": "Neighbors fence..am I the jerk at this point?", "selftext": "My neighbors are building a fence. My wife and I noticed something was off with the fence on our side when it was first being built. We did some measurements and found the fence was 4 feet over our property line. We went over to speak with the neighbors and the one neighbor became hostile as soon as I asked to speak about the property line/fence. She instantly said what is wrong with a few inches and I explained it was a few feet she then put her hands up in the air and said it's always something with you. She then proceeded to slam the door in my face. Next thing I know she has the sales agent in my back yard looking at the property pins and the owner of the fence company. Both the sales agent and fence owner stated my calculations were right. I stated I had hired a survey professional to come out and inspect the property the next day. I had to leave for work and when I came back that side of the fence had been torn down and then rebuilt.  There was an obvious difference and I felt like things were good. The sales agent and fence owner said that my survey wasn't necessary, but I felt it was just for peace of mind. The next morning he comes out and we find that the neighbors fence is 5 inches over in my property line. I haven't said anything to the neighbors at this point. In fact as far as I am concern I want nothing to do with them. I reviewed our HOA and it states that fences should be on property line. I am torn. Do I make a fuss over 5 inches or do I stick to my principles and say something so that HOA is being followed correctly? Honestly, I feel awful for just being hard nose on this situation.

{"title": "Neighbor Hired Excavator Without Insurance", "selftext": "A few weeks ago, my water stopped working. After nearly a full day of trying to figure out why the water stopped, I found out it was because my neighbor had electrical work done on their underground electrical cables on their property. My electrical lines are about an inch under theirs. They hired an electrician who recommended an excavator to lay new conduit down and new wires. In doing so, the excavator damaged my 220 voltage wire. When the water stopped at my house, it was because there was no power to the well pump. Also, electric car charger, heat pump, oven, dryer, and other larger appliances were not working. My power outage was on a Friday and I couldn't get an electrician until Monday, who had to line up other contractors to find the break in the line and dig it up the following day, so I did not have 220 voltage/water for 5 days. My electrician said there is no doubt that the damage was caused by my neighbor's excavator/laying new conduit. It cost about $3500 to repair the damage. I paid it. I reached out to my neighbor who denied responsibility but gave me the name of the excavator. I contacted him and he refuses to take responsibility. I contacted lawyers, but it seems like the amount I am owed is too small to hire one. Small claims court seems too stressful and there's no guarantee that he will actually pay me even if he is found at fault. I called my home insurance, but I put in a claim last year and they advised against putting in another claim, saying that we could be dropped and our rates will most definitely go up. I feel like I'm out of options. It just seems so unfair. I'm at the point where I feel like I just need to accept it, but I feel so angry and bitter about my neighbors and their lack of helpfulness.

There\u2019s chiggers in the back yard so you can\u2019t even use the yard, and with the septic so no gardening. I\u2019m older. I can\u2019t deal with all of this problems. I don\u2019t know what to do. My dream of being a homeowner has turned into a nightmare. Luckily I have a tiny one room apt somewhere else.  I have tried so hard to like it here but I\u2019m miserable and feel like this house has aged me 10 years in 3. I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice?\n\nI made a mistake in the dates. I bought the house 2 years ago, not 3. Autumn of 2021. I\u2019m adding this at the bottom so as not to confuse people since comments have been already made regarding the dates.

Days later a tech comes out and identifies that our evaporation coil needs to be replaced and that we\u2019ll be $140 out of pocket. Cool. Or so I thought. Couple days go by and FA calls us to tell us that they\u2019ve reviewed the techs notes and it\u2019ll be $645 worth of bullshit made up fees that they don\u2019t cover. Fine whatever I just want the AC fixed. Weeks go by with nothing from either FA or the contractor. Finally we get a call from the contractor stating FA never ordered the part. Contractor says they\u2019ll contact FA and get it expedited. Two more weeks go by and I\u2019m starting to get pissed, but my wife is insistent that we wait and they will call us when stuff is ready and there\u2019s nothing we can do. I\u2019m fed up though at this point because it had been over a month so I call the contractor. Contractor says FA fucked up and ordered the part twice and sent it to two different locations, both being the wrong location. As of writing this I have been playing phone tag with the contractor and FA for over a week now with neither side knowing what the other side is doing and neither company calling me back when they say they will. I finally got to a supervisor with FA that is refunding our service charge (big fucking whoop how bout knock off the $500 in bullshit charges) but will continue the work and they\u2019re now ordering the part from their supplier for the third fucking time.

After being told that this part was ordered and shipped two times this associate finally gave me the real answer. The part was never shipped. Despite being told by numerous different employees, one of them a supervisor, both with FAHW and with the contractor, the part was never shipped. The order was placed twice with one supplier and the supplier didn\u2019t have the part. Finally this third time the order was placed with a different supplier and this supplier (Carrier) has the part. No other associate has given me the level of detail that this woman did and no other associate was as straight forward with me. I finally have some answers and should have a pickup number tomorrow for the part and hopefully be scheduled by the end of the week.

Yesterday the new owners asked if they can come and do there walk through. I agreed to a walk through on my purchase agreement but it literally says: buyer can do a walk through of the house two days prior to closing. That\u2019s it. They went in yesterday and I ended up getting sent about 20 pictures from my lawyer and realtor saying that the buyers are disappointed with the house and they want $1500 for cleaning and repairs. I was originally like okay fine, but then I talked to some people including my lawyer and they all say no don\u2019t do it, you don\u2019t owe them anything. \n\nSome of the things in the photos I understand. They were upset that the window latch was broken and that there are stains on the carpet. It\u2019s been like that for years and was definitely like that when I put my house up for sale. The other photos were of the inside of the fridge, inside of the stove, finger print on the wall, water mark on a tile, nail holes on the wall, a garbage bag that was in the garage... I think that\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. Don\u2019t get me wrong I get that you want a spotless beautiful new house but you didn\u2019t buy a new house for one and two you didn\u2019t put professional cleaning in the purchase agreement. I cleaned to the best of my ability but they are now asking me for money and to do something about it when the closing date is the next day. \n\nI would also like to state that they put an offer on my house before it went on the market so they didn\u2019t go for a viewing. Also they DECLINED a house inspection. To me that means it\u2019s not my problem... I originally felt really bad but then I realized they denied all inspections and then they sent me stupid things like a finger print on the wall... \n\nJust wondering what you guys think and if you\u2019ve experienced anything like this? I myself just purchased a house that is only a year old and I had to go and do my own cleaning, repaint all the walls and throw out there garbage bag and clean up all their cigarette butts in the flowerbed... didn\u2019t think anything of it cause I was like meh it\u2019s been lived in. \n\nMy closing date is today and I\u2019m worried now that something going to happen. I will find out in a few hours but it\u2019s stressing me out! My lawyer said they have to close to today but my realtor said they can technically push back closing but eventually they do have to close.\n\nUPDATE *** \n\nThey closed today!!!!! Whew thank god! My lawyer called me and said everything was okay and I ended up getting all my money from my close. He did say that the buyers lawyer sent him a message basically saying no technically I don\u2019t have to do anything but it\u2019s common sense to have a clean house when you sell it and since I\u2019m not doing anything about it there is a possibility that they can come back later down the road and try and sue me. I\u2019m not worried about it because I literally did nothing wrong. I had time to take away the garbage and wipe down a few more things before they took over but I obviously didn\u2019t fix anything or clean the carpets. It was definitely clean just not sparkling brand new house clean so I won\u2019t worry too much.

There's nothing illegal about being creepy, so I was told just call the cops the next time it happens\n\n>How about you install a light/laser?\n\nI actually asked the officer about this too.

It will be a bit of a story so that the context is all there. \n\nIn 2008 my mom was divorced by my stepdad and we moved out of state from a big 300 acre ranch house to a basic 3 bd house. Fast forward a few years and my mom I guess couldn't afford the rent anymore. She worked for farmers insurance for an agent and set up appointments and what not. She was able to make a deal with her boss who she had worked for over 20 years and he bought her a house to rent from him. Fast forward another few years and her boss tells her that he can no longer keep the house in his name and had to sell. That would've meant we all would have had to went separate ways and find a new place to live. My mom pitched the idea to me that maybe I could qualify for the house with an FHA loan if her boss could bring the selling price down enough. Me (about 21 at the time) thinking that would be a great way to keep my mom and her long time bf from being homeless , decided to go through with it and qualified just barely for an FHA loan with a gifted down payment from my Aunt. It started off alright and we continued living how we always did.\nWe've always had a good relationship and I thought this would be the right thing to do. I now (almost 30 years old) that this was a terrible mistake. Fast forward just a couple years and I've met a girl . We love each other and had a child together. She had two boys of her own so now we are a small happy family of our own . We eventually moved out and got our own place to rent and I continued renting the house out to my mom and her bf. Also had another little boy during this time. Everything went fine until the beginning of this year, my mom informed me that she would be losing her job and wouldn't be able to afford the house and we decided to sell. A week after listing the house, my mother calls me back distraught telling me how she has no idea how she is going to afford to rent elsewhere. Then comes the idea of , why don't we split the house and we can all live together and we split the mortgage and utilities and we can save a ton of money. My gf surprisingly was on board with this idea. Mind you , my gf and my mom do not see eye to eye and do not get along . It was this moment I know I  should've told her to figure something out and there's nothing I can do. But me being me (stupid), seeing my gf so heavily optimistic about the whole idea, I decided it's worth a shot. Fast forward one more time about 9 months and I don't think I need to explain that things are not working out . My gf hasn't been happy since we moved and of course neither am I. We are tense all the time and she is at the point where she can't handle it anymore .\n\n Now I am stuck in a predicament. I'll do anything to keep my own growing family happy and support them however I must. Would I be wrong to tell my mother and her bf that they have to find a new place to live and that this arrangement isn't working? I feel terrible about kicking them out of their house , but if it weren't for me nobody would be living in the house anyways and we wouldn't be stuck in this predicament. \n\nAny advice at all or comments of any kind will be very helpful \ud83d\ude4f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1hpbzzk/should_i_tell_my_parents_we_need_to_sell_our/", "created_utc": 1735523472.0, "score": 313, "author": "jtraceur5", "num_comments": 167, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1hpbzzk/should_i_tell_my_parents_we_need_to_sell_our/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Unfortunately neither permit includes any diagrams or other detail.\n\nWithout needing to spend money to have a surveyor come out and show her that the fence is on her property, is there some way I can definitively prove who owns the fence?\n\nI know the fence is 100% hers because her house was built a year before mine was and the fence was already there when I bought my undeveloped lot.  I'm trying to be neighborly and helped her temporarily fix it, but it needs major repair in a few areas and for whatever reason she seems to think I'm trying to skirt liability.\n\nEDIT: as suggested, I was able to get an image from Google Earth that shows her fence existed prior to my home having been built, that should be pretty definitive.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/z5oz74/neighbors_fence_damaged_by_hurricane_they_think/", "created_utc": 1669515743.0, "score": 316, "author": "vrtigo1", "num_comments": 135, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/z5oz74/neighbors_fence_damaged_by_hurricane_they_think/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Neighbor is raising a small nation of dogs", "selftext": "I live in the southern US and I'm not joking when I say the neighbor at the end of my road has somewhere between 20-30 dogs. They roam the neighborhood unsupervised, sometimes in packs. I first started noticing their activity earlier this year with occasional sightings but they have become a daily thing now. They lounge in the middle of our road and wander into everyone's yards like they own the place. I used to be able to leave things lying around but now I have to keep everything secured or it gets stolen. \n\nI placed a heavy mole-trap in my backyard and never imagined a dog could pull it out of the ground but they did. The next day a frying pan was stolen, so I went to my neighbor's house and got my things back. He told me had other people's belongings as well. As he was handing me the trap, he could barely keep the door closed as 10 dogs stuck their faces out looney toons style, eventually getting out and barking at me all the way back to my house as the neighbor's feeble attempts to wrangle them back up fell on deaf ears.\n\nIt's a middle-aged couple, and they don't seem concerned about the effect their dogs' activities are having on the neighborhood. He didn't indicate that he had any sort of plan to keep them away from people's yards. Yesterday my dog's bed was stolen, and I went back to find out it was torn apart. The wife just stood on their porch with a big shrug as 15 dogs formed a semi-circle around me, all barking. I had a pepper spray on me, but I didn't want to get any closer to talk to her. She made no attempt to meet me at the road.\n\nI'm partly to blame for leaving food outside, but it's for composting. The dogs have to learned to come around to check my compost pit for food now. In brutally ironic fashion, they also dig up my yard searching for the mole I was trying to catch. They also woke me up early on the weekend twice barking up trees. It's becoming a nuisance. I have no idea how my neighbors are sustaining a small army of dogs but I heard they asked the neighbors across from me for dog food once. The couple doesn't seem educated or capable of using online resources.\n\nMy question to you is: what is the appropriate course of action? I don't want to hurt the dogs if it's avoidable since I hate violence and I don't wish to make enemies.

We are out in the county, but just 3.5 miles from the interstate and touristy-small mountain town in Virginia. Across the street from us is a farm with rolling hills and cows. The property is close to 2 acres, with a fenced garden and chicken coop. Open lot next to the property, for sale for over 3 years. Next to that is a fancy McMansion neighborhood. Large property behind us.  No close neighbors. We are on a highway, though pretty set back, and it\u2019s always the first thing plowed when we do get snow, so we\u2019re never stuck, and very rarely lose power for longer than 2 hours. 10 minutes to a huge lake, a popular recreation spot. There is a detached garage has potential to be rented, either short term or long term with significant renovation. We could probably also provide camper hook up at this spot for short term rentals. It\u2019s far enough away from the main house that we wouldn\u2019t mind. Huge kitchen, rooms are roomy, but it is kind of a funky layout. Old house stuff. \n\nThings of concern. The HVAC is probably 12-15 years old. Works great now, but time is ticking. Need to dig another French drain around the house to manage water around the foundation, plus new gutters. Would really like a 2nd full bath. 2 septic tanks to maintain. Landscaping sorely needed. Some cracked tile and need some new wiring and breakers. My husband can do most of this work, but time and materials $$.\n\nWe are trying to decide if it\u2019s smart to purchase right now. Market analysis came in at $305k, landlord is asking for $275k considering the home inspection. We could downsize and find something comparable, newly renovated, but without this much land (pro and con), for around $250k. I\u2019m nervous about the market, but it\u2019s definitely stabilizing from the outrageous prices after COVID. On top of that, Hard Rock Casino just opened 30 minutes from us, so lots of the prices were inflated by Air bnb owners. Same in the town, it\u2019s a major tourist destination. If anything, inventory is always an issue here, especially rentals. Pretty hard to find. \n\nWe just don\u2019t want to be stuck upside down on a place if we decide to move in a few years when my youngest graduates high school. Or the economy collapses lol. Estimated mortgage would be just under 30% take home, not considering potential rental income on the detached garage.\n\nWe either buy this, buy something else, or rent somewhere else. Rent in our area for similar house would be a couple hundred less per month than a mortgage. \n\nAm I overthinking? Sometimes I\u2019m like, totally great investment! Other times I\u2019m like hell no, I want the freedom to move quickly if necessary, and hate the idea of renovating and maintaining the land and the house. Other times I love walking my cat out to the chicken coop and collecting my eggs while stopping to pull a weed or two from my garden.

He filed a claim with his insurance company and they don\u2019t want to pay up to fix the full extent of the damages. \n\nThe property that was damaged, which is relatively new (less than a year old), needs a full replacement, with a reasonable explanation, per the opinion of 1 estimate I received from a contractor.

They are correct in that the property was previously patched, however this negates the fact that the current damage is different, significantly worse, and covers a much larger portion of the property.\n\nLast week, they provided me a settlement offer, which is 80% lower (and it is multiple thousands lower) than the cost of the full replacment. On top of that, their offer is significantly lower than the cost would be to \u201cpatch\u201d the full area of damaged property.

Am I stuck with the only option of filing suit in small claims court (which I really might not win), or is there any advice on what I can try with the insurance company?

{"title": "Help! DIY Building Permit Application for Garage Renovations.", "selftext": "Hello,  \nI am a co-homeowner with my parents in Tampa Florida. We are DIY'ing renovations to our garage, which was damaged during the last hurricane. This home was built in 1949 and is wood-framed. The garage seemed to have been added after the house was built but not sure at which point.\n\nMy dad has been in construction for years, and knows a lot about electrical work and structural work but does not know much about the permit process.  \nWe are doing the permit application ourselves and it is very confusing. We were told by the city department that we need to submit a building permit application.  \nI tried doing that and figured out that before we do that we need to get a site plan review application approved first. I started the application and saw that we need to submit a \"building plan\".  \nIf this is a sitemap review why are we submitting a building plan already? I have drawn up the site map and floor plan already.\n\nWhat else do I need to include in this \"Building Plan\"? So confused.\n\nRefer to the project description used in the application.\n\n***The scope of work involves the partial structural renovation and partial reconstruction of an attached residential garage located on a single-family residential property. This renovation is necessary due to significant water intrusion and deterioration of two existing wood-framed exterior walls, caused by damage sustained during Hurricane Helene. The proposed work includes the demolition and replacement of the north-facing and east-facing exterior wood-framed walls with 8-inch concrete masonry unit (CMU) block walls. The east wall will be extended laterally by 8 inches, and both walls will be extended vertically by 9 inches to align with the updated roof elevation and structural design. As part of the wall expansion, the existing concrete slab foundation will be cut, filled, and leveled to accommodate the additional 8-inch extension of the garage footprint along the east side. This will ensure a continuous and structurally sound surface consistent with the new wall layout. The project includes the demolition of an existing wood-framed shed structure currently attached to the exterior of the north wall. Following its removal, a new exterior pedestrian door will be installed in the same location to maintain access. Additionally, the garage door opening will be enlarged to 9 feet wide to accommodate the installation of a new 9-foot overhead sectional garage door that meets current wind load and clearance requirements. A new window unit will also be installed on the east CMU wall to provide natural light and ventilation. The scope further includes re-roofing of the garage structure, with framing modifications as needed, and upgrades to the electrical system within the garage. This will involve removal and replacement of the existing electrical load center (main panel), which is located on the interior side of the exterior walls undergoing renovation.***", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1kfblc6/help_diy_building_permit_application_for_garage/", "created_utc": 1746451613.0, "score": 1, "author": "Budget-Sea-386", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1kfblc6/help_diy_building_permit_application_for_garage/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Siding and remediation question", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI posted recently about a mold issue in my attic and the reason the inspector gave was due to a disconnected BVent that is used to vent the HVAC system and water heater. I\u2019ve since had that reconnected, but it seems it was venting for some time as there was mold in the attic. As a side note furnace is 80% efficiency, not sure on water heater. I had a remediation company out and they stated that they think the mold can be treated without having to replace the roof sheathing or replace the entire roof. \n\nI\u2019m waiting on a quote for them. They need to pull down drywall due to moisture damage to the drywall in one room ceiling.  Then I have to bring in another construction company to hang the drywall and paint since the remediation company doesn\u2019t do drywall. This is at the front of the house. I noticed some damaged siding which I will need to pay out of pocket to replace at the front of the house, but I also noticed another corner of the house I didn\u2019t notice before showing droplets. \n\nPhotos attached here https://imgur.com/a/CISVwjF\n\nThe roof was replaced in 2021 and both the inspector and roofing company came out and said the roof and ridge vent seemed to be in good condition. \n\nThe remediation company did have photos inside the crawl of sheets covered in mold but mentioned nothing seemed rotted so they felt they could treat with spray and then use killz. \n\nMy question is for the. 3rd photo above does that warrant siding replacement as well? It looks like some sort of staining. Not sure if that\u2019s just morning dew staining or something else. \n\nAlso, at this stage should I just rip and replace the siding on the entire house or get some more years of life? I have a company lined up to replace the siding in the first 2 photos once the remediation is done. Insurance is covering drywall, paint, and insulation costs I\u2019m responsible for everything else. \n\nAnother photo of another side of my house that has some cracked siding from the install in 2004 when the house was built here https://imgur.com/a/MNDaceJ\n\nThese photos are in what seems to be a less affected area of the attic. My inspector has suggested repainting this year and having the paint recaulk the joints and get a bit more life out of them. \n\nI imagine if I do siding, painting, and remediation I\u2019m probably looking at 100k \ud83d\ude2d I\u2019m estimating the mold remediation between $5000 and $10000 alone. Siding probably 50k, and painting 15k.

{"title": "Neighbor\u2019s tree fell on my house.", "selftext": "I wanted to start off by stating that I have obtained a public adjuster to help. I live in PA if that helps. Looking for shared experiences on what is the expected outcome of recouping certain things. \n\nA little bit of a background.  All of the power and service lines run behind the houses. On the neighbor\u2019s side of the property, there is a line of very tall pine trees. The branches are a constant source of power outages. In 2023, PECO, our electric company, subcontracted a tree removal service to take down one dead pine tree. They could only access it from my yard, as their driveway is a steep hill and their fence is not a double opening. So they needed to use my yard for the equipment.  They signed a waiver to agree to remove the tree. At any rate they left the tree trunks in my back yard and I was forced to pay someone to take them as my fence was being installed in the weeks after that. Not too relevant, just still bitter about that. \n\nFast forward to February 2025, the power lines snapped during a storm.  We caught it happening real time and live wires came down in my yard. We were without power for 6 days.  I filed a claim with the electric company for food reimbursement and sent them the emails back and forth about the trees in the wires from the previous 2 years.  I was assigned a claim rep. We talked on the phone. He was supposed to come out the week of the April 7th.  There was no follow up. \n\nFast forward to 4/15, a sunny day, a gust of wind came through and one of the trees split and fell on my house.  Into the sunroom, kitchen, and my son\u2019s room. All of the rafters in the back of the house broke, it went through the roof into the house. Knocked the chimney cap onto my AC unit breaking that too. Every room has stress cracks on the ceilings and walls.  My son\u2019s ceiling completely collapsed. The hvac unit and roof was replaced October 2023. 5 panels of the fence destroyed. New Weber grill the boys bought me for my bday the previous August looks like a pancake. Lights in my kitchen flicker, the stove is on the same wall as the chimney and when I turned the oven on to check, it smells like gas.  My 12 foot metal shed is destroyed. \n\nI\u2019ve had to take off 5 days of work for this.  Does anyone have any experience getting wages reimbursed. I do have PTO, but will be in the red at the end of the year as I wasn\u2019t planning this time off and have other commitments at the end of the year. My stress level is through the roof. I have 4 large dogs in a residents inn. They are used to running in a 1/2 acre fenced yard most of the day. \n\nI know the job of insurance claims adjusters are to low ball you, but they sent a check for 37k. I know it\u2019s a negotiation process once construction starts but that $$ amount seems crazy low. The subrogation team at my insurance company already contacted me for all of my communication regarding the trees. Not sure how that process works or outcome of that. \n\nIf you made it this far. Thank you. Any insight from previous experiences?  Anything I should be asking for?  My public adjuster came recommended by quite a few people. So hoping he gets what needs to be done, done.

{"title": "Home insurance right before closing nightmare", "selftext": "Long but holy shit, please help guys! Idk if this is the right sub or not but I just need advice ASAP. \n\nSo I'm supposed to close on my home in less than 7 days.  Everything was fine until my lending company realized my policy was written in the wrong county. The county line apparently goes through my property. Anyway,  when they corrected the county, my premium doubled. Why? Well they found in the loss report that back in late 2021, the sellers made a damage claim worth over 100k. My insurance guy tried to write with every carrier he had and I got denied for every single one, except one and it's crazy expensive. The sellers disclosed that they made a damage claim on the property discolosure, but not the extent or amount. This had to be huge damage considering the entire house is worth less 300k anyway. No carrier wants to insure the property. All inspections came back good and I paid for the inspection with all the bells and whistles. I contacted my realtor, pissed, ready to back out of the house. My realtor reached out to the sellers realtor who was unaware of this huge claim and let them know. The sellers at first didn't want to admit the amount of the claim, gaslit saying it was 4 years ago at this point, asking how did I find out, accusing me of just trying to back out last minute, ect. This will be the 2nd credit we asked for because at inspection we found out all of the appliances in the home don't work. So my realtor asked for a credit big enough to cover 2 years of insurance until this claim falls off the loss report and I can shop for a new carrier. Sellers refuse, say we're trying to blackmail and extort, yada yada. We stand our ground, I send over the loss report and the quote for proof, they hit back with their current policy that's cheap. Well they have a landlord policy, not a homeowners/primary residence policy. They say it's the same thing, it's not. We're at an impasse. My realtor tells them I will be backing out if I don't get the credit, they threaten to keep earnest money and quickly find out they can't because we signed an extension with a contingency just a few days ago. They counter with half the amount asked (1 year of insurance coverage instead of 2).\n\nHere's the thing, even with the credit, this new premium  jumps my mortgage payment by hundreds. And although I can afford it, it pushes my DTI to the very cusp before loan denial. My lender said he's never seen something like this happen before, in his many years of doing mortgage loans. I'm upset that we're literally days from closing and this happens. Like the entire 30 days we've been under contract, this happens 5 days before. Frustrating af. I've been scrambling trying to find new insurance but I'm in FL so options are already expensive and scarce. I literally only have 1 choice, all other carriers have denied. Idk what to do! After that claim drops off, I should be able to get a new/hopefully cheaper policy but I don't have a crystal ball. I'm sooooo upset. Thankfully I signed that extension that gives me an extra week to backout without losing my earnest money. But I already told my apartment I'm breaking my lease, I already lined things up to go for this house. Literally everything else was approved and this insurance crap happens. Should I back out if I don't get the full credit from the seller? Even if I do, my mortgage payments are still fucked until I get a new policy. I just save closing costs, unless I prepay the hime insurance for the year with the money but I don't think my loan allows me to pay outside of escrow. Should I wait it out? Is the seller wrong? I'm a FTHB and stressed tf out because of this. What do I doooo?

{"title": "Water damage from hidden pipe leak \u2014 first-time homeowner looking for advice on insurance, repair costs, and next steps", "selftext": "\n\nHi all,\n\nI\u2019m a first-time homeowner and recently ran into a major issue. After using a backyard hose (that we rarely use) to water plants for about 10 minutes, we discovered water all over our living room floor. A few days earlier, we used the hose for 30 minutes with no visible problems.\n\nThe leak only happens when the backyard hose is running, which leads us to believe it\u2019s coming from the pipe or joint connected to that outdoor spigot.\n\nWe called a local plumbing and water damage company, and here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned so far:\n\n- The plumber suspects the leak is inside the drywall, likely from a pipe joint connected to the outdoor hose bib. It only leaks when the hose is in use.\n\n- He quoted ~$900 to open the drywall and fix the plumbing, but he won\u2019t patch or restore the drywall afterward.\n\n- The water damage inspector used moisture sensors and confirmed the drywall is soaked and there\u2019s trapped water under our vinyl flooring. He also said the crawl space might be impacted.\n\n- Mitigation alone (drying, cleanup, etc.) is estimated at $5K\u2013$10K.\n\n- Full repairs (plumbing + mitigation + restoration) could run $10K to $50K, depending on how much hidden damage is uncovered.\n\n- They said accurate restoration quotes aren\u2019t possible until walls and floors are opened up.\n\n- The inspector mentioned this might qualify under homeowners insurance, since it was sudden and accidental, but I should file a claim within a week of the incident.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nAdditional context:\n\n- This home is just 3 years old, and it\u2019s 1-year builder warranty has expired.\nStill, I reached out to the builder to check for any extended coverage or goodwill options, especially since this particular hose bib has been rarely used.\n\n- We\u2019re expecting a new baby within a week, so DIY isn\u2019t an option for us. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to get this resolved quickly and responsibly \u2014 but without overspending unnecessarily.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nHere\u2019s where I need advice:\n\n1. Should I file an insurance claim now, or wait?\n\n- I\u2019ve already contacted the plumber and water damage inspector on my own (not through insurance). Will insurance still accept their reports, or should I have called insurance first to send their own vendors?\n\n- If I file a claim now, will insurance send their own adjuster before approving any work?\n\n2. Will filing a homeowners insurance claim hurt me later?\n\n- I\u2019ve read mixed things online \u2014 some people say it could make selling the home harder, or raise premiums. Should I be concerned?\n\n3. Are the quoted costs reasonable?\n- $900 for plumbing\n\n- $5K\u2013$10K for water mitigation\n\n- $10K\u2013$50K total for everything depending on what\u2019s uncovered\n\n4. Can I break this into phases to reduce upfront cost?\n\n- For example: fix the leak first, then dry things out, and do cosmetic restoration later when we can afford it.\n\n- Or will delaying anything (besides the leak fix) risk mold or make insurance less likely to cover it?\n\n5. Anything else I should know as a first-time homeowner dealing with this?\n\n- I want to avoid rookie mistakes \u2014 especially when dealing with insurance or contractors.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nAny advice or insights from people who\u2019ve been through this would be hugely appreciated.

When it's well and truly rotten, she sprays it all over the place. The stench is eye-watering, and it lingers for hours and hours on our property. To make matters worse, she sprays it all the time, and what that boils down to is that our kids can't enjoy our yard many days during nice weather because of the foul, pervasive odor. She must not smell it, because she asked me years ago, 'It smells like Italian food, doesn't it?\"\n\nSince we get along well, I asked her if it would be possible to use something less smelly last year. For the rest of the season she was pretty obliging about that, but she's back to her old ways again this year. She said \"because it's organic, it's not a problem and shouldn't bother anyone.\" Except it does. She promised to \"only spray when the wind is blowing the other way\" which seems impossible, or \"only in the evenings\" which means we can't enjoy our yard in the evenings. If it was only the garlic and hot sauce I could probably tolerate it, but the putrefied eggs really put the stench over the top. \n\nShe doesn't seem to understand what a big deal it is for our family.

Today *might* be my victory.\n\nAdmittedly, I was a little lazy with my foundation entry points, and in one case, mesh wire was jammed in and not properly secured\u2026 and I paid the price!\n\nI heard some sort of scurrying under the house, and my dog seemed interested, so I took a peek. And yup, the screen was torn away. Ugh. My crawlspace under the house is very low, so I can't investigate (nor do I want to go face-to-face with whatever on my belly!), so I set up a camera.\n\nDusk rolls around, and a big fat raccoon squeezes his way out. It'd be funny if it also weren't annoying how comically fat he is. I guess these things are like rats and just need to squeeze their head in!\n\nHe leaves, and I proceed to block the area with the intention of hitting the hardware store in the morning to fix it. But in the morning, I hear scurrying again, so I walk around the house, and a cover in the front was torn away. So I adhere that again with liquid nails and remove my blocked area so it doesn't get trapped in there.\n\nHe pops out, and I block it, but the next morning, more scurrying, and ANOTHER cover is pried off. So now I do a full sweep to secure all entry points, adhering covers or stacking heavy items to stop him, and unblock the one with the camera (so I can make sure it's gone). This time, once I see him leave, I step outside and see him on the wall that separates my home from a neighbor. He's STARING at me, and I'm staring at him. We stare too long; it makes me uneasy\u2026 but then he's off running away.\n\nThis repeats for several days because, like a lazy fool, I set up \u201cintricate\u201d blockers around unsealed entry points (heavy concrete in front of a grill near one, a grate propped by a ton of nonsense in front of another) instead of securing them 100%. In part, this is because I'm afraid of sealing it inside. And like clockwork, it finds another way in somewhere, pushing over a series of bricks or clawing around a water hose pipe to squeeze into the tiniest of holes.\n\nLast night, though, I may have tasted victory. He left, and I stepped outside and saw him at the corner of the pool, drinking the water (dummy!!). Again, he sat there for an uncomfortably long time, looking at me before dashing off. But this time, I had all my areas properly secured except the main exit point (the only one I can reliably monitor on camera), which has so much stuff blocking it that it'd take the Hulk of raccoons to get in there.\n\nSo now I wait\u2026 so far, no scurrying, and seems\nclear. If it stays quiet til tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll lock down that last point for good.

Most of the homes around here are modest capes, about 1,800 sq ft. About four years ago, our neighbors moved in\u2014really nice people. Late last year, they did a major home addition: added a two-car garage, around 800 sq ft of new living space, a master bedroom and bathroom, and re-sided the whole house. Honestly, it looked great.\n\nFast forward to about two weeks ago: I came home and noticed they were doing another addition\u2014this time on the side of their house closest to mine. They\u2019d already poured a slab and started framing. From what I can tell, it looks like another bedroom, maybe a bathroom, and possibly even a second story.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: it\u2019s less than two feet from the fence dividing our properties. I really didn\u2019t have an issue with it, but I thought it was odd that something like that would be allowed, so I checked the city\u2019s building records. Not only could I not find any permits or approvals for this new addition, but there were also no permits or variances for the first addition they completed last year.\n\nWell\u2026 apparently someone in the neighborhood reported them, because the city slapped a stop-work notice on their door.\n\nNot long after that, the neighbor came over and asked me\u2014pretty bluntly\u2014if I was the one who reported them. I told them no (because I didn\u2019t), but it definitely felt like they didn\u2019t necessarily believe me.\n\nHere\u2019s my question:\nCan the city actually make them tear down the new addition if it wasn\u2019t permitted or approved? And what about the first one? Could they be forced to remove that too if no permits were filed for it?\n\nI genuinely feel bad for them if they skipped the red tape and now it\u2019s all catching up\u2014but I also feel like things may get awkward between us, and we may be blamed for something we didn\u2019t do.

{"title": "French Drain Advice", "selftext": "I have water seeping into my crawlspace on the back side of my house. Unfortunately, this caused mold and some rot. I have since had the mold removed, encapsulated the crawlspace and installed a dehumidifier. The seepage wasn't discovered until after the encapsulation was completed after several days of rain. I guess having the vapor barrier down allowed the water to stick around long enough to pool in a low spot. I ended up cutting the vapor barrier and using a towel to sop up the water which was about a gallon. I repaired the vapor barrier once the dehumidifier dried the soil out.\n\nI am thinking I need a fench drain along the back of my house to capture subsurface seepage as there isn't any visible pooling or flow to or near the house. My property gently slopes down hill with my house in the middle so the area behind the house is elevated. I have about 6' to work with in-between the house and the pool. I figured I would split the difference and install the drain 3' from the house and go 3' down which would put me about a foot below my block foundation and surface of my crawlspace. I would, of course, do the burrito method with clean gravel and slope the pipe about 1.5' over the total 130' span. The french drain itself will only be 30' which gets me a couple feet past both corners of my house. I do not plan to cover the trench with soil but tather fill to the top with drain gravel.\n\nI had an idea to install pond liner plastic along the side of the trench on the house side asanadded precaution to prevent horizontal seepage.

I'm in a situation where my girlfriend got a contractor back in December 2024 to renovate two bathrooms and at the time the contractor said it would take 1 week to complete.  Now, were in may and we've been without a bathroom for over 2 months (he finally came in in February to gut the bathrooms but then left without completing it) so we've had to use public washrooms. He is not answering calls, or texts. Has missed the deadline he promised for completion three times (all written and confirmed by him in liability insurance) and my girlfriend has paid on time every time he's asked for a deposit and has paid over $20,000. We're planning on taking him to small claims at this point because he's not given any indication that he'll complete this. Furthermore, he's even breached Contract by not making things to code (which was signed in the contract and we have a video recording of a meeting where he confirmed it verbally).  After realizing his mistakes of not building stuff to code, he wants to charge us more to correct his error.  This is among other stuff like he left unsheathed blades on our floor, damaged the apartment and used our dog's bowls to soak plumbing equipment without our consent.\n\nThis has been a LONG relationship and my girlfriend has paid a LOT of money and on time every time the contractor asked for it. He has a seemingly stellar review score on his website and social media has great products but for some reason he's been an ABOMINATION for us to communicate with. He also never apologizes or takes accountability. \n\nIs this truly normal for a contractor? What can we do? We know that even if he miraculously completes the job, it won't be what my girlfriend paid for as he's changed critical designs without our consent from my girlfriend and won't admit any wrongdoing.

{"title": "Mechanic neighbor parks cars in front of my house", "selftext": "I have lived in my current home since 2017 and was initially warned that the man next door was a pain in the ass and not to get on his bad side. He\u2019s a big loud Harley Davidson dude who has seven Chihuahuas. He periodically lets them run all over the place unleashed and they come in my yard and poop and pee, but he always picks the poop up and has always been as respectful as someone can be in that situation. All the neighbors get annoyed because he screams loudly at the dogs EVERY time to come back, using profanity and calling them \u201clittle f***ers\u201d. I\u2019ve always stayed out of his way, never complaining and and just being neutral and friendly\u2026.and have found that over the years having that attitude has kept peace between us despite the brief annoyances. It frankly hasn\u2019t been often enough that it\u2019s been horrible because it\u2019s just a few minutes every day. So to me, it\u2019s not worth starting a battle over. It\u2019s my understanding that the person who lived here before me did have a big battle with him and it was not pretty. Nothing physical happened, but it was more verbal back-and-forth and tension. \n\nBut now something has come up that\u2019s really bugging me. He started his own car repair business and parks customer\u2019s cars in front of his house and it stretches down in front of mine. I noticed he doesn\u2019t park in front of the neighbor on the other side of him at all. It\u2019s always my house and my friends come over and can never find a place to park. He doesn\u2019t work on the cars in the street so I know that part he\u2019s following the law there. I believe he\u2019s also rotating them enough that they do not fall under the abandoned car law either. So unfortunately, I think he\u2019s probably not breaking any laws but it\u2019s stressful to constantly have random cars constantly in front of my house. I tried to ignore it and tell myself that it\u2019s not a big deal but it\u2019s really getting to me. My house is on a corner so I have plenty of room to park on the other side and I have a driveway, which is where I usually park anyway so it\u2019s not really impacting my ability to park. But it\u2019s just kind of claustrophobic and when I do yard work, there\u2019s always a car park right up against the curb. Lately, there\u2019s never NOT cars parked in front of my house.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how to approach this and just looking for any suggestions.

In response, they said splitting the retaining wall was already a favor\u2014they were only offering to help because it aligned with their landscaping timeline.\n\nLater, I chose not to move forward with the retaining wall project. After that, they told me they wouldn\u2019t be able to contribute financially in the future if I ever decide to redo it.

At the moment my fiance (no wedding planned, but longterm partners if that matters) and I rent a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom and we share this property with our two roomates who we have known since childhood and consider our best friends. Roomate drama isn't a thing in our household and we really enjoy the feeling of community instead of being alone. \n\nOur current rental has no heating, no air, hasn't been updated once since it was built in 68 and it is infested with mold, water damage, spiders, rats, and bats in the attic. Our landlord is unable to afford repairs, so we have a deal where we fix anything that needs to be fixed, and he takes a couple months off of our rent anytime we do a repair. our landlord also lives on the property and has animals that are aggressive towards Mine. The reason we still live here really is just because we were turned away from every other place and this was our only option as the landlord is laid back and didn't require anything for the application process. \n\nOur biggest struggle in finding rentals are a couple things..\n\n1. We are young adults. Youngest being 19 and oldest is 25. We have short credit history, short rental history, and are still in the beginning of establishing our careers. Often times we get turned away immediately after an age reveal or a credit check. (we all have credit withing the 710-750 range). Or most landlords don't want to deal with a roomate situation. \n\n2. My roomate and I both have animal based jobs. He is a ferrier who works on horses mostly and I am a dog trainer/groomer. sometimes I foster or work on rehabilitation cases. So being pet friendly is a MUST for any property we move to and I am unable to pay pet deposits as I don't always have the same number of animals in our household at the same time, I would be having to pay a different deposit for each month essentially OR most places only allow 1 cat or 1 small dog. \n\n3. Since my roomate and I are private contractors for our work, often times we are denied rental applications due to lack of \"work history\" or pay stubs from employers, eventhough we can prove we make 2x rent each. My fiance is a deisel mechanic and my other roomate works in aggriculture/plant sales, so they do not have this issue, but it can be frustrating to attempt to explain our monthly income to possible landlords. While we don't live lavishly, we are able to cover our necessary bills and have some financial wriggle room until the next month. \n\nHere is our plan!! \n\nWe have been brainstorming this idea for a while now, but I don't even know where to start or if It would even be a good idea, or if we would be screwing ourselves over in the long run.. We all enjoy living together and have no plans of separating to our own smaller spaces any time soon, or ever. My roomate and I both want to work harder on our animal jobs and have a more permanent space to work. We have been brainstorming buying a couple acres, and then purchasing a small mobile home or trailers to live in on the property. Over time we can of course save up and build on from there. I would like to build a small kennel space for my dog work, and my roomate needs to build a workshop/barn for working with some of his clients. We have no plans on leaving the area we live in. We don't crave luxury and we have all actually been homeless in the past, so the trailer life is very comfortable for us. \n\nmy biggest concern is of course the price. Does anyone know of any hidden fees and expenses that come with something like this? how hard is it for young adults to get approved for loans for property? loans for mobile homes? Our plan was that one or two of us split the property, and the other two split the starting buildings we live in. Is this a ridiculous idea that will just screw us over? Or has anyone done something similar? \n\nI understand we need to tally things like property price, home insurance, fire insurance, utilities, property maintenance, Mobile home price, delivery price, assembly price. is there anything else I am missing? I understand I'm kinda an idiot haha but at the moment this truly seems to be our only option if we all want to keep our jobs as well as stick together as a community/family.

{"title": "Are some houses just more humid than others?", "selftext": "I'm in St. Louis, which is pretty humid 8-9 months out of the year, and just had its rainiest April on record (almost 11\" of rain). I'm in a brick house built in 1922, 2 stories and an unfinished basement, zoned HVAC for 1st and 2nd floor. We don't run the HVAC much in spring and fall.\n\nI started measuring our indoor RH this past month during all the rain (because my husband made some passing comment about it smelling like rain inside during a very rainy weekend), and I noticed:  \n**When it's especially humid outside in spring, it's a FIGHT to keep our indoor relative humidity under 60%.**\n\nWe have NOT noticed mold, allergies, condensation, a damp feeling, anything like that. We have a lot of books in the house, and our daughter is sensitive to mold, so we'd know. It doesn't seem to be getting worse over time, either. It doesn't seem, in fact, to feel any different from the time when I wasn't paying any attention to this. (That tells me maybe I shouldn't have started paying attention, but my busted brain chemistry loves a rabbit hole.)\n\nWe have 2 Nest thermostats that measure RH, and I also bought a 6-pack of el cheapo hygrometers on Shameazon and put them all over the house.  \nRunning ceiling fans, in the rooms that have them, gets it closer to 50% (in those rooms). Running HVAC has a similar overall impact, but again, we don't need to use it that much this time of year (except to cool down the upstairs in the evening before we go to bed, because it does naturally get warmer up there). Running the fan function on our HVAC has had limited benefit.\n\nBasement can get damp in rainy conditions if left to its own devices (if you're familiar with houses in St. Louis city, that's like saying the Pope goes to Mass). We have a GE 35-pint dehumidifier down there, and running it on \"smart dry\" keeps it reliably around 45% RH even when it's been rainy. I haven't measured what impact it has on the upstairs RH if I turn it off, because we got it about a month ago (replacing a REALLY old unit that gave out this winter) and it's been working its little mechanical butt off.\n\n(EDIT: Our house gets quite dry in winter, as I think is typical for many homes. Usually around 30% RH with the heat running constantly.)\n\n**Are some houses just more humid than others? Is this just a fact of life in humid climates and I should just invest in a few dehumidifiers? Or is there something I should be doing differently?**\n\nThanks for reading my latest anxiety-ridden post!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1kccpfo/are_some_houses_just_more_humid_than_others/", "created_utc": 1746116177.0, "score": 1, "author": "mpl84", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1kccpfo/are_some_houses_just_more_humid_than_others/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Our water has been privately tested as well and is great. \n\nI feel like this is super invasive to have people come in my home - even if the intent is good especially when I have identified a standout item that is or could be potentially causing this without at least doing a repeat lab to confirm. \n\nI do appreciate the education I received from the nurse because there were some things that I was not aware of that impose a risk to lead - apparently playing in rocks and dirt which my son is obsessed with! \n\nI\u2019d rather pay for professional testing of the toy or the dirt pile he is obsessed with than professional testing of my entire home.  I can\u2019t find anything online mandating an inspection (except for rental properties) only that it\u2019s a suggestion. \n\nCan anyone provide resources that show its mandated or advise if they went with the state inspection or private? Can I just do the private testing of the soil and if that and the you suffice be done with it?  Or do the inspection but not share with the state? \n\nAnyone been through something similar with an old home? My sensitivity to the inspection is I feel 1) it\u2019s invasive and 1) it\u2019s opening pandora box on an old home that we know likely has lead somewhere when I know the likelihood of my home itself being the culprit is low given I\u2019ve identified 2 other sources. \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/lead-prevention/hcp/clinical-guidance/index.html\n\nhttps://njaap.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/8-51-summary-for-NJAAP.pdf\n\nEdited to add: I know it\u2019s not our water because 1) all our other children would be elevated and 2) our town requires well water testing for residents who have well prior to closing and it was impeccable.

{"title": "Contractor Has Invaded Our Home, What Can I Do?", "selftext": "For context: I'm 19. I live with my little sister (8), my girlfriend (19), my grandpa (73), and the Contractor. We all live in Colorado, USA.\n\n**TLDR**: My grandpa hired a contractor last September, who since then has spent all of the money, moved into our house, and is doing terrible work. There is a lot of information about this below, probably too much, but I feel it is nessecary.\n\nLast September, my grandpa paid a family friend a sum of money to do some work around the house. The original plans for his work were:\n\n* Move a walk-in closet to the other side of the master bedroom\n* Change the light fixtures in the master bedroom / bathroom\n* Install flooring upstairs\n* Paint a few walls and trims\n* Add a room in the basement\n\nThe agreed upon quote for this work was $16,000, which my grandpa describes as being apparently quite cheap. A compilation of his work can be found below. The original estimate of when he'd be done was October, but at this point, he's living rent free in our master bedroom, and $4,000 over budget, with no end in sight. The $16,000 has already been used up, with him asking for up to $4,000 extra last I heard.\n\n**WORK:** [**https://imgur.com/a/diy-part-1-QiPsswH**](https://imgur.com/a/diy-part-1-QiPsswH)\n\nOther examples of his fine work include shooting nails through walls, covering our house in dust, and smoking weed and drinking beer in the master bedroom and his truck (occasionally, before driving). It should be noted that the $16,000 + $4,000 has all been spent, and he is asking for my grandpa to front money for things such as his phone bill and to replace his truck's starter. Take your guess as to what he's spent it on.\n\n**DUST:** [**https://imgur.com/a/IYtyJpn**](https://imgur.com/a/IYtyJpn)\n\n**NAILS:** [**https://imgur.com/a/E2GRKYb**](https://imgur.com/a/E2GRKYb)\n\n**BEER:** [**https://imgur.com/a/bpORzKU**](https://imgur.com/a/bpORzKU)\n\nThrough the week, he works on our house for an average of about 15 minutes a day. This is no random man off the street, at least. He is my sister's step father's mom's boyfriend, of course.\n\nI have not felt safe in my own house for a long time because of this man. My girlfriend feels the same way, and quite frankly I am concerned about the welfare of my little sister as well.\n\nIf it was me, any single one of the things above would get him run out of my house on a rail. Why my Grandpa tolerates all of them is completely beyond me. No matter what I, or anyone else in his life says, he's still letting him progress. At the very least, he now sees that the contractor is clearly stalling so that he has a place to stay, but my grandpa does not care. His opinion now is that he wants the contractor to finish the work, keep the money, and get out.\n\nIt must be noted that, despite what you may think, my grandpa is not senile or demented; as long as I have known him he has always been sort of a pushover, for want of a better term. Since my grandma passed away last year there has been nobody to keep him in check, and to get him to say no.\n\nWhat can I possibly do about all of this? Ethical, or unethical, we're approaching the most recent due date my Grandpa has given him, May, and he's still not near finished; I don't want him here in perpetuity. He's on probation, though my Grandpa didn't care to ask what for, he's done unlicensed electrical work, and he doesn't report any of his income to the IRS. I might be able to do something with those.\n\nAn additional concern I have is that of squatting rights; I really doubt that this man will leave as soon as he's done. I'm not entirely sure how squatter's / tenant's rights work, but I don't find it unlikely that he might force us to evict him, or even put a lien on our house.\n\nIf you have read through all the way to this point, thank you for sticking it out. Typing out every detail makes me realize how truly terrible and ridiculous this situation is. If you are confused or need clarification on this massive amount of information, please feel free to ask, I have nothing but stories to tell and things to say.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1kb757z/contractor_has_invaded_our_home_what_can_i_do/", "created_utc": 1745984381.0, "score": 66, "author": "theradRussian3", "num_comments": 59, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1kb757z/contractor_has_invaded_our_home_what_can_i_do/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

But the inspector found stuff like the hot water heater being installed incorrectly, an exterior door being installed in a way that was incredibly unsafe for anyone to actually use and step out into, and even when you used the shower, under the house would flood because a drain wasn\u2019t even put on lol \n\nRight away, all the new windows leaked. Also someone randomly came over to the house once to look at a leak in the (flat) roof but no one told me there was ever a leak. I was confused, showed him the room where it allegedly was and said the wall/ceiling was fine. It hardly rained that year but\u2026 that corner of the roof began leaking after the home warranty expired. So\u2026 someone knew of a leak and never told us.\n\nWe fixed the windows but then one living room window has continued to leak, 5 years later. I fixed the back room roof leak in 2023 and this year, I had a roommate who lived in that room, and she never told me the ceiling and wall was leaking all winter. The leak came back. I cut out the drywall, the roofer who repaired it in 2023 came back and fixed the leak, I paid someone to repair the wall, and then after it rained again this weekend\u2026 the BRAND NEW wall is wet again. $1,250 later\u2026 I\u2019m back to where I started. A wet wall and a leaking corner of my roof.\n\nI\u2019ve had this house for 5 years and I\u2019ve paid to fix these window and roof leaks like 6 times and I\u2019ve never been able to just have a dry house when it rains unless I have tarps on my roof.\n\nAll the stucco on one side of my house is now cracking like all over, probably from a separate water intrusion and bad installation.\n\nThe flippers also installed the absolute worst LVP floors that began failing after only 2 years. Thank God I found perfectly good hardwood floors below my living room but now I have to pay someone to remove the LVP in the living room and we\u2019re gonna attempt to re-install the good planks back in the kitchen to fix the very bad broken planks. A temporary fix for now.\n\nAnd on top of all that\u2026 yesterday I had a contractor come out to look at my never ending problem of a house and I told him how when you step on a certain area of the kitchen, you can hear a little crack in the bathtub area. He looked under the house and he thinks a pylon/pier supporting the raised foundation is sinking in a bathroom. The pylon looked dry and actually looked fairly new. I\u2019m guessing the flippers installed it, but it\u2019s another thing they touched that is failing. He mentioned the need to jack up my house in that area.\n\nI\u2019m now at the point where I just want to sell my house and move to Omaha. This is EXHAUSTING.\n\nJust needed to rant for a moment.

Property A has the house and a decent sized yard. Property B has no structures on it other than an in-ground pool, and it is a little smaller than the total size of property A. The reason we were told for this was that property A and B were originally on the market as one lot, when a developer put in a cash offer with the intention of splitting the property and building a house on property B. The offer was accepted, but the developer backed out of the deal last minute and the former owners decided to begin the process of splitting the property themselves.\n\n  \nOur first offer on the house was for both property A and B, but it was rejected and we were told that the previous homeowner decided to hold onto property B because it was going to take 2 years for the land-splitting process to be completed. We ended up changing our offer to buy property A, but we made it as clear as possible that we want to purchase property B when it comes time for them to sell it. \n\nWe are now 1 year into living in property A, and it is pretty torturous having to watch property B fall into disrepair.

{"title": "Good fences make pissy neighbors?", "selftext": "I need an AITA check here. Neighbor B decided to replace a perfectly good and functional fence. I stupidly asked if they wanted a contribution thinking they would say no worries, this is an unnecessary vanity project but instead they billed me for a proportional share of the fence. Not exact numbers but along the lines of they paid for 200 feet of fence and my shared side was 60 feet and they tried to collect for 60 of 200 feet.  However, of course I got the wrong side of the fence and the 140 feet that were only theirs included a gate (which I know from my own recent fencing projects is $800 more than just the same length of fence) and about 20 feet of double-sided fence. Also the wrong side of this fence is the ugliest thing ever with a corner post (I have an oddly shaped pipe stem lot) sticking out 12 inches into my yard, and is the first thing you see walking out my front door. Super duper ugly and intrusive and they never sent any pictures of how that would look when I non-objected to the fence. (Note I did not agree to pay).  So they expected me to pay the same for the wrong side with this horrific corner and also to bear the costs of the extras that were not on the shared side. For context, I had recently become a widow, which they knew, and due to medical issues of my own had been unable to work and had no money coming in, which they didn't.  \nSo I ignored their initial email requesting $2900 thinking it had to be a joke because they hadn't given any prior indication they were the type to take advantage of widows. But then Neighbor B harassed me about it one day when I was out in my yard.  (What I was weeding the invasive vinca that comes from his side of the fence, which I have never complained about and just deal with. And I have always paid 100% for the costs of keeping my trees, planted by previous owners, trimmed so they don't touch neighbor B's house.)\nFast forward six months and I was able to sell my house without paying to have my side of the fence doctored up to hide the corner. Phew.  Do I owe Neighbor B anything?  My mistake was ever offering.  I do not know if the folks abutting on the other side (Neighbor C) paid.  Neighbor C offered to pay me when I replaced some of our shared fence that was straight-up falling down with rotting posts but I declined because I felt like the only reason to replace it was my impending home sale and they shouldn't have to participate in that.  \n\nSo stupid me expected Neighbor B to be like me but instead they expected a widow to subsidize not only their vanity project, but the parts of the vanity project that I don't even share.   \nShould I pay them something though,  since the new fence, ugly as it may be, will last for longer than the fence that was there and there is some value to that?

Some of that is because 3 of the windows I want top-down/bottom-up but that still seems egregious. I have very large \"picture windows\" that are 36\" wide and anywhere between 72\" tall (upstairs) and 84\" tall (downstairs) measuring for interior mounted curtains. But it's an oooold house from the mid 1800's so some of the windows vary a tiny bit from top to bottom by 1/8\" such that I assume the thing to do is just take the narrowest measurement and use that as the size I put into an online tool after measuring with a really good laser tool.\n\nThe one thing I'm hung up on is warranty: if I get Hunter Douglas blinds, they're warrantied for life. Another company--and I forget the brand--said not only are theirs warrantied for life, they'll transfer the warranty to the next owner if I sell the house AND they added a 5 year warranty on things like spills, stains, or just being an idiot and breaking them through misuse, no questions asked.\n\nI assume if I am buying direct and not having them installed professionally, no such warranties are going to apply.\n\nSo my questions are:  \n1. those of you who have just installed blinds yourself, were you able to find high-quality blinds that have lasted a long time? Did they come with a warranty? Did you have occasion to invoke that warranty, and if so, was the company faithful to the warranty or were they a pain in the a\\*\\* about it?\n\n2. My other source of anxiety is if I am somehow off in my measurements, there are some online sellers who have a \"that's a you problem and you eat the cost\" approach. I understand where they're coming from, but that's part of why I am getting quotes for installs in the first place: then it's NOT my problem, but it seems to multiply the cost by a factor of 10 which is insane. Are there any online blinds/shades providers that will work with you if you need to resize? I'll take a \"measure twice, cut once\" approach, but if I'm dropping $200-$300 a window times about 30 windows in this home, that's a lotta cash to eat if I make a mistake, just trying to find a way to minimize my liabilities.\n\n  \n(P.S. I know I said I got a quote on 11 windows above and then mentioned there were 30 windows in the home later; I was getting a quote for the windows that most-emergently need shades for privacy -- bathrooms, bedrooms, living room. I would LIKE to get shades throughout the home, but the professional install option is prohibitively expensive to do them all at once).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1kauune/blinds_question_in_new_home_making_new_thread/", "created_utc": 1745950490.0, "score": 2, "author": "mentorofminos", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1kauune/blinds_question_in_new_home_making_new_thread/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

We only had a few hours to decide, it was now or never ,and under all that pressure, we took the leap.\n\nAt first, everything seemed perfect. We loved the neighborhood, the backyard, the space for our kids to grow.\n\nThen, three weeks ago, everything changed. Our neighbor came over and casually mentioned he was planning to expand his house, even adding that he had thought about buying our home before to annex it.\n\nThe next morning, we woke up to excavators tearing down his small garage. In its place? A massive two-story extension with high roofing , just 3 feet from our property line. What used to be a nice 22-foot gap between our houses is now barely 10 feet.\n\nIt\u2019s enormous. It towers over our home, blocks sunlight from our kids\u2019 bedrooms, and worst of all \u2014 they installed windows that look straight into our backyard, killing any sense of privacy we had left.\n\nWe checked with the city, and sadly, everything they\u2019re doing is legal and fully permitted.\n\nWe had planned to renovate and invest even more into this house after finishing the basement, but now\u2026 I\u2019m not sure anymore.

{"title": "New roof, too good to be true?", "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago we've had a hail storm (up to golf ball size) for several minutes. Probably the first one I've seen since I moved in 2013.\n\nLast week a couple of roofers came to check the roof, and informed me that I'm eligible to file a claim through my insurance if there was damage covered by said insurance. Mind you my roof is 2012 (reading online it seems that insurance can potentially drop you after a 15 year roof), and when I bought the house 2.5 years ago it's been one of my concern since the home inspector said it was one of the things to keep an eye on. \n\nThey sat down with me told me the whole process with the insurance and how it works, showed me the pictures they took (asphalt completely dented in several parts, plus dents on those metal things in the roof. I'd only be paying my deductible ($2500), and have a possibility to offset my deductible (eg. keep the old gutters to pay into the deductible), and pulled a hail app report where I typed my address information and showed me the date, time, area, avg size, largest size of that hail storm, and an estimate for $20k.\n\nI agreed so they gave me a checklist of what to say when I file the claim like date of hail, don't mention the word hurricane (because It'd be a higher deductible), no injuries, keep it honest but don't overshare, and so on. They agreed on sending an inspector, so the roofers told me to let them know when the inspector comes and they'll be there that day to support their claim.\n\nYesterday the inspector came said he was gonna send it in and they'll let me know if I get approved in 7-10 business days. The roofers told me that the inspector was pretty fair, and has a good feeling about it being approved. From my POV they seem legitimate honest, but I see constantly people saying don't ever trust door to door salesman, yada yada yada. TBH I've had good experiences with some of the d2d salesman like I got fiber optic internet for $25 less, plus a month free if I switched (old provider was terrible), and got a good deal with 5 trees cut down for $5600 (a previous estimate wanted to charge me $2600, and $1800 for just 2 of the 5 included trees the other guy did).\n\n  \nI checked the roofing company out online: Fairly new company with 5 star reviews on google (only 4, but 2 of those reviewers are local guides that don't shy on giving 1 star reviews), accredited in BBB with an A rating, licensed (license number displayed in their website), and insured. \n\nThey said the plan was wait until approval, once I collect the check, they can start by putting the order of the materials which takes about a week to arrive, and start the day after the materials arrive. Once then their whole work takes one to two days at most. They also said they usually start higher on the estimate while the insurance will go lower and hopefully negotiate in the middle.\n\nIs there some sort of scam I'm missing or am I overthinking this? It sounds like a good opportunity, plus hopefully my premiums can go lower if I do the wind mitigation report on the new roof", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1kau5k4/new_roof_too_good_to_be_true/", "created_utc": 1745948801.0, "score": 1, "author": "Imhere4lulz", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1kau5k4/new_roof_too_good_to_be_true/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Is buying a single-wide home on a 10,000 sq ft lot a stupid decision?", "selftext": "\n\n\nI\u2019m 24, making $95K/year, and I have a fianc\u00e9 who stays home with our 11-month-old son. We\u2019re currently renting, but we\u2019re considering buying a 2021 single-wide manufactured home on a 10,000 sq ft lot. The home is listed for $149K, and single-wides are common and accepted in the area we\u2019re looking at. The big bonus is that it has easy access to DFW, which makes it convenient for work and commuting.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal:\n\nOption 1: Single-wide manufactured home on a 10,000 sq ft lot for $149K\n\n\t\u2022\tPros:\n\t\u2022\tMonthly payment will be around $1,300\u20131,400 (similar to our current rent).\n\t\u2022\tWe\u2019d own the land, which seems like a big advantage.\n\t\u2022\tThe home is newer, so there shouldn\u2019t be many repairs or issues.\n\t\u2022\tWe\u2019re saving money by buying instead of continuing to rent, and the money is going toward something that\u2019ll eventually build equity.\n\t\u2022\tEasy access to DFW\u2014great for commuting and work flexibility.\n\t\u2022\tCons:\n\t\u2022\tIt\u2019s a single-wide, so it\u2019s not the traditional \u201cstick-built\u201d house that most people expect when they think of homeownership.\n\t\u2022\tThe lot size is 10,000 sq ft, which is just under a quarter acre. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s big enough for a family, especially if we want to make improvements or have more space down the line.\n\nOption 2: Stretching for a bigger home ($200K+ range)\n\n\t\u2022\tPros:\n\t\u2022\tA more traditional, spacious home (probably a double-wide or stick-built).\n\t\u2022\tHigher resale potential, especially if it\u2019s a more \u201cstandard\u201d home.\n\t\u2022\tMore room for the family to grow, possibly in a more desirable neighborhood.\n\t\u2022\tSome homes in this range might be farther from DFW, giving you more space for the money.\n\t\u2022\tCons:\n\t\u2022\tMonthly payments would be higher\u2014probably in the $1,600\u20132,200 range.\n\t\u2022\tHigher taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs.\n\t\u2022\tLess room in the budget for emergencies, savings, or future investments.\n\t\u2022\tMore financial pressure and a longer-term commitment.\n\t\u2022\tHomes in this range might be farther from DFW, which could make the commute tougher.\n\nOption 3: Continuing to rent for the same price\n\n\t\u2022\tPros:\n\t\u2022\tNo long-term commitment.\n\t\u2022\tFlexibility to move if the situation changes.\n\t\u2022\tNo risk of dealing with home repairs or maintenance costs.\n\t\u2022\tCons:\n\t\u2022\tNo equity being built.\n\t\u2022\tRent can go up at any time, and there\u2019s no control over the living space.\n\t\u2022\tLonger-term, it feels like a waste of money because you\u2019re just paying someone else\u2019s mortgage.\n\nSo, is buying a single-wide on a 10,000 sq ft lot a good move?\n\nI know it\u2019s not the most glamorous option, but it seems like a smart financial decision, and it\u2019s a big step up from renting. Plus, it gives us easy access to DFW, which is important for work. I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019s a mistake to go for something that feels \u201cless than\u201d what people expect in terms of traditional homes.

{"title": "We\u2019ve been in our home for three years and I want to sell. Am I mad?", "selftext": "Wife and I bought our first home in 2022. We\u2019re in a smaller but high COL mountain city but had dreamed of moving here for years. Unfortunately we made that move in the post-COVID crazy market era. We rented an apartment for the first 6 months while learning the area and house shopping. We wanted to be closer into the city center but it was simply untouchable with our budget at the time, tiny studio size homes needing massive repairs were going for over half a million. It was insanity. We bought when rates first started going up so our rate isn\u2019t wonderful but better than what is available right now.\n\nLong story short, we found a lovely little home about 25 mins outside the city in a rural suburb. It\u2019s quiet, peaceful, and has plenty of amenities like a neighborhood walking trail and quiet country roads that we like to bike on. Small fenced in yard for our dog. Garage and more square footage than we could afford in the city. It checks a lot of boxes. However, we can\u2019t help but feel like we settled.\n\nOur entire social circle we\u2019ve built here lives in the city, so we\u2019re always the odd ones out that are too far away to make social gatherings easy. We happily drive to meet up with friends and be social, but it can be a drag and we hate that we\u2019re too inconvenient to others to host. We have favorite little coffee shops and pubs in town, but they\u2019re 25+ mins drive to get to. In addition to this, our house is reaching a quarter of a century old so several maintenance projects are hitting at once. The HVAC is beyond needing replacement. Both bathrooms need a full renovation, and it\u2019s a constant fight to keep the baths/showers watertight to prevent further damage. One shower is out of commission because the grout is so cracked and deteriorating it needs a full tear out which we can\u2019t afford along with the other repairs. We just replaced the hot water heater. We have a window and door in need of replacement due to water damage and poor weather seal. The roof is aging and will need replacement by the time we can afford to finish all of these other projects. Add on 500 little small projects that\u2019s won\u2019t stop popping up (which I know is just part of homeownership) and it\u2019s beginning to weigh on our mental health and finances. Being a higher COL area, contractors here are all $$$$ we\u2019ve found. It\u2019s starting to feel like the walls are closing in around us.\n\nIn summary, we think we settled for a home in a location we don\u2019t really want to be in. And now our home needs tens of thousands of dollars in repairs to keep it going. I just don\u2019t see the worth in investing it if it doesn\u2019t feel like forever. I\u2019m contemplating selling and renting something in the city so we can live the life we wanted when we moved here, at least for a little while until finances allows us (hopefully) to own again. But the rental market here is brutal as well, so it will be no cheap cakewalk.

{"title": "A complicated situation: Buyer started the relationship first but the agent is dual agent now", "selftext": "Sorry for the long title but I couldn't summarize the situation shorter. Basically the seller had a horrible agent and hasn't succeeded in selling the house for a year - a really big house in\u00a0*LCOL*\u00a0area - so listing has expired. It has been on my radar for a while so was curious to know what's going and messaged my agent (buyer's agent) to check what happened. He found out that the seller didn't like the seller agent and didn't want to continue with them after the listing expired. Basically the seller wanted to represent themselves and he has his own lawyer. So my agent has been communicating with the seller directly and he agreed to my price then worked on an offer based on that. The price is way lower than what the initial listing was and also slightly (relatively) lower than what the seller wanted when he talked to my agent. However, I initially preferred to have the seller contribute some to the closing costs as a seller assist but my agent told me the seller would not agree to that.\n\nFast forward...the agent notified me that the seller now wants my agent to be his agent as well so he becomes a dual agent!! So this will require changing the offer draft...etc.\n\nI searched tons of posts here and there and everyone recommends against the idea of dual agent.\n\n\\- I totally understand that dual agent is bad, especially, for the seller....but isn't my situation unique that relationship started first between the buyer and the agent?\n\n\\- My understanding that the seller verbally agreed to all contingencies that I had in the offer, which in fact was drafted by the agent before they just became a dual agent!\n\n\\- The current offer is way lower than what the house is worth, here I am talking about $300-$500K range difference. The owner is very elderly, very sick of this process, not easy to get finance for an expensive house in such LCOL area...so they want to get done. Even Realtor estimate and Zillowestimate have the house worth way higher than my current offer.\n\n\\- Someone would ask, if I buy an expensive big house in such LCOL, then I would have the same problem if I decide to leave and sell it in 5 years or so. I checked the market well and yes, I have seen many similar expensive houses get sold even way higher than the actual worth of this house...yes not easy and took sometimes 3-6 months but there are still rich people who move this area.\n\n\\- Yes, dual agent thing is unethical and I don't like that sudden change. My agent was supposed to represent me and vouch on mybehalf...so instead of having the seller now paying for a seller fee to the agent, shouldn't have the agent told them to do the seller assist I wanted from the beginning?\n\n\\- At the end, the offer has all the contingencies and terms I wanted and was drafted by the agent before that sudden dual agency...the house is in a really strategic location and is worth way higher than what I am offering. Do you think I should continue? Do think it's reasonable to ask and insist on seller assist because this is what I initially wanted and the agent then told me the seller would not agree to it but now the seller is paying the same amount of seller assist but now to agent as a seller agent fee?\n\nOr I should just cancel the whole idea despite the great location of the house, the equity already and the seller willing to repair everything in the inspection and all my contingencies?\n\nI am really confused here...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k9ggyl/a_complicated_situation_buyer_started_the/", "created_utc": 1745793262.0, "score": 0, "author": "_good_boy_1234_", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1k9ggyl/a_complicated_situation_buyer_started_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Let me explain: \n\nWe have 2 kids around the same age and there are a lot of kids on our street so they're often playing together outside. Over the years the kids across the street, let's call them the Jones's, have been bully's to kids on the street. One family even moved because of it.

My kids play great and for long periods of time with all others on the street, but when the Jones's are out there's usually an altercation that cuts playtime short. (Examples: hitting, chasing with a bat...one time a hammer, crawling over our cars, entering our house without invitation to get snacks...literally they just walk in). It's been hard to assess what's normal 'kids being kids' who just escalated a little too much but  we've talked to the parents multiple times when something really out of bounds happens and nothing changes. \n\nWe really try to take into account that these are kids and the likelyhood that they actually mean harm is incredibly low, BUT it's getting harder and harder. \n\nToday was the crossing of the line- we had friends over and 2 of the Jones's kids drew with chalk all over our friend's car. The other Jones kids saw it, and did nothing. Luckily no damage was done to the car and we cleaned it off.

Our realtor was like \"well, we have earthquakes here.\" Me: \"yes, that is why it is important the house be well constructed.\" Realtor: \"well, do you want me to eliminate all concrete slabs?\" Me: \"What, no.\" \n\nIs this unreasonable? \n\nIt is a concrete slab with vinyl flooring throughout. The inspector noted that there is variance in the floor stating it is \"uneven, bumpy, and out of level.\" \"Traditional tolerances for floor slabs generally allow for a deviation of 1/8 to 1/4 inch within a 10-foot span. In this case, deviations ranging from 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch were measured within a 4-foot span, indicating a more significant variation than typically expected.\"\n\nThe entire floor is covered with vinyl linoleum, which limits visibility and makes it difficult to determine whether the unevenness is due to surface finishing inconsistencies, underlying cracking, heaving, or settling. It is also worth noting that this slab is approximately 45 years old, and concrete finishing techniques at that time were less refined than current standards. Many homes from this era originally had carpeting, which often concealed such imperfections.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nI recommend having a qualified concrete specialist conduct a thorough evaluation of the slab to determine the cause of the unevenness and out-of-level areas. The specialist should assess whether any underlying issues need to be addressed, such as potential structural problems or necessary repairs. Given the challenges of assessing the slab beneath the linoleum, it is essential to address these concerns to ensure the long-term stability of the flooring.\u00a0\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k9a9uf/home_purchase_in_hawaii_inspection_report_notes/", "created_utc": 1745777054.0, "score": 1, "author": "PossessionOne3662", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1k9a9uf/home_purchase_in_hawaii_inspection_report_notes/", "html_title": ""}

Here\u2019s the breakdown of our first 3 weeks and \\~$4,000 spent, plus some lessons learned for other first-time buyers. Hope this helps someone else avoid the sticker shock!\n\n* Painting the interior: $400. Freshened up the vibe with some new colors. Pro tip: Don\u2019t skimp on primer for old walls!\n* Cleaning supplies & restocking: $500. Kept what we could, but needed new brooms, mops, and pantry staples. Moving from rentals, we didn\u2019t own much household stuff.\n* New drill for TV mounting: $200. Snagged a solid Milwaukee DIY set with bits. My car tools didn\u2019t cut it for household projects\u2014new game, new gear (plus about $80 for the TV mounts).\n* Electrical upgrade for home office: $450. Some of the house is modernized (panel, appliances), but my office had ungrounded outlets. Ran a new line to the breaker. Safety first!\n* Gutters: $900. The dry basement and crawlspace had minor seepage from water pooling at the foundation. Gutters were a must to protect the house long-term.\n* Crawlspace TLC: $800. Fixed an exterior wall crack, laid a proper vapor barrier, and installed a commercial-grade dehumidifier with a pump to the basement sink. Had to buy a bucket, shovel, etc., to clean it out. Not glamorous, but no regrets.\n* Lawn care gear: $750. With spring here, I needed a mower, trimmer, edger, and a high-end leaf blower (small yard, so one battery works for all\u2014saved some cash!). The sidewalk and driveway look crisp now.\n\nThe furnace and water heater are only \\~5 years old, so we\u2019re good there. Down the road, we\u2019re eyeing a metal roof and plumbing upgrades, but for now, we\u2019re catching our breath. Total spent: \\~$4,000. My Dad always said, \u201cThere\u2019s always something to do when you own a home,\u201d and damn, he wasn\u2019t kidding. What I\u2019ve learned:\n\n* DIY is awesome but costly upfront. My car tools helped, but household tools were a whole new investment. Budget for basics if you\u2019re starting fresh.\n* Old houses = surprises. This 1950s gem needed electrical and water protection fixes we didn\u2019t expect. Prioritize safety and structural stuff over cosmetics.\n* Seasonal costs sneak up. Spring meant lawn gear. If we\u2019d moved in winter, I\u2019d probably be pricing snowblowers right now.\n* Future-proofing feels good.

{"title": "How to do a retractable shade on our poly-roof porch", "selftext": "Last year I switched our front porch from metal roof to Suntuf clear, which totally revitalized our living space, since the main picture window for our living room+kitchen open concept space is under that porch.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-g1pdqXOSyczZfSBMX\\_OIfmjCphpcPzj/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-g1pdqXOSyczZfSBMX_OIfmjCphpcPzj/view?usp=sharing) \n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1urYilHY8MwFNsMjbc3wv6Jt\\_GFuqJsOB/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1urYilHY8MwFNsMjbc3wv6Jt_GFuqJsOB/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe thing is, our 1940s built house is poorly insulated, and that porch faces east, soaking up quite a bit of sun on warm summer and fall days. Last year, after I'd demo'ed the metal roof porch (which had a layer of foamboard insulation beneath metal) our living room got significantly hotter on sunny days. Also, from what I can tell already (it's just April in Wisconsin but already heating up) the Suntuf clear will magnify this heating effect, including on the porch itself.\n\nSo all along we'd planned to deal with this trade-off by adding a sunshade. Initially, I'd planned to rig up a slide-on-wire canopy that can be retracted when we prefer more light vs shade:  \n  \n[https://patio-paradise.com/media/catalog/product/cache/8c0650fe206b835e925b2d74c2296ca1/6/\\_/6\\_69.jpg](https://patio-paradise.com/media/catalog/product/cache/8c0650fe206b835e925b2d74c2296ca1/6/_/6_69.jpg)\n\nI've found various youtubes about people DIY'ing their own, with various levels of quality. And there's also a bunch of them on Amazon, which all seem to be low quality (some even melting in the sun, most of them ripping after a year or less of use.) Where we live there's a lot of open land (farms) so we get some pretty whipping winds, and while ideally they'd be retracted in any high winds I'm realistic and know that's not going to happen perfectly. The very best (like by a few orders of magnitude) instructions I found on creating one of these is actually from a sailing supply company. They have a 1.5 hour Youtube video, materials list (almost all of which they sell, from fabric to stainless hardware), pdf, and even a calculator that gives you a sewing pattern, materials list, etc. based on what size canopy you're trying to make:  \n  \nSailrite Slide-on-wire Canopy video:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Ao3zZiOHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Ao3zZiOHY)  \n  \ntheir calculator:  \n[https://www.fabric-calculator.com/wirehungcanopy/index.html#!#submitdiv](https://www.fabric-calculator.com/wirehungcanopy/index.html#!#submitdiv)  \n  \ntheir canopy ebook:  \n[https://www.fabric-calculator.com/wirehungcanopy/eBook.htm](https://www.fabric-calculator.com/wirehungcanopy/eBook.htm)\n\nAnyways, I thought great...except once I plugged everything in (our porch is 12x24, and I'd be covering about 12x18 of that because of the swinging bench would be in the way of a full canopy) the materials come out to about $1500, which is way more than the $300 or so I was expecting to spend on a shade.\n\nSo I've gone back to the drawing board considering various options. We're in sort of a weird situation because of our needs. Most people getting these things want them for pergolas, so they use high-end UV and water proof fabric, which we don't really need because it will be under a poly roof that blocks UV. But I don't think we can really cheap on fabric either because of our wind situation and that I want this to last a while.\n\nI keep thinking of two options (and feel free to point out more that I'm not considering):\n\n\\-Adapting a shade sail to be more quickly hung under the porch. Shade sails usually take a while to hook up and get under tension with turnbuckles, which means that instead of pulling out the slide-on-wire shade in 2 minutes, it's a 30 minute process of unstowing and strapping and tightening the shade sail, which is going to discourage people from wanting to deal with it. Plus I imagine it'll  get all creased up getting taken in and out all the time. But if there was some way I could make a sort of roller-furling system that was attached to the high end of the porch by the house, where I could just pull out the shade sail and then ratchet it to the far beam, and then - when wanting to roll it up - just detach and roll it up with the furling, that might work? Would still take longer than 2 minutes but not as much of a hassle as folding and stowing and attaching all 4 sides every time. And shade sails can be had for \\*very\\* cheap.\n\n\\-Sort of the same idea, but on \\*top\\* of the roof. This could actually serve a dual purpose, since we do get hail in this area, and if the shade material had some thickness to it, it could lengthen the life of our Suntuf poly roof if we deployed it when there was danger of hail. I'm thinking also some sort of furling system where the shade was permanently attached at the high end of the roof and unrolled all the way down and then was tied down. Disadvantages here I see are that wind could easily get under the shade and flap it around, and considering that our roof is exposed fastener that would probably not bode well for the material. Also, I have a hard time imagining a system that could unroll and roll this up with just 1 person, which would be ideal if I wanted it to get regular use and not just a few times a season. \n\nPS I know there are also retractable awnings that are either crank or motor-activated, and while I've considered those (and we could get a used one off of marketplace for a fraction of the cost of the Sailrite DIY Cadillac canopy) from what I understand those are extremely prone to getting damaged in the wind, but perhaps someone could set me straight if that's not the case. It also would have to be one with variable angles, as we're pretty limited with a precise angle for headspace under our low porch roof.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k97ufb/how_to_do_a_retractable_shade_on_our_polyroof/", "created_utc": 1745770916.0, "score": 1, "author": "mrthrowawayguyegh", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1k97ufb/how_to_do_a_retractable_shade_on_our_polyroof/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Neighbors won\u2019t keep dog in their yard", "selftext": "I'm going to try to put this as short as I can but please ask questions if you don't understand something.\n\nSo neighbor A has a dog and a hole in their fence. So the dog leaves. And then neighbor B takes it for walks around the neighborhood (no leash). She feeds the dog and the dog stays at her house throughout the day and goes back to neighbor A at night. \n\nNow the problem. It is not cat or dog friendly. We have some outdoor cats and it chases them. We've had multiple run away and never come back because of this dog. It got one of our cats the other day for the first time and we had to literally chase it off. Once when I went to walk around the neighborhood looking for one of our cats I accidentally left our gate open and our small pregnant Chihuahua followed me. By the time I noticed we were pretty far from our house so I figured I'd just keep her close to me while I circled back to the house. The neighbor's dog spots me and comes running over (it seems to really like me). It runs over to my chihuahua and starts sniffing it. I'm watching very closely because until this point I hadn't seen it with other dogs. And then it attacks. I immediately grab my dog and hold it up above the other dog. I start going home and the dog follows me. I get home and it runs off. \n\nAnimal control has been called so many times and each time the owners pay the fines. They sometimes fix their fence but then Neighbor B will let the dog out or even break their fence again. They have asked her to stop but she doesn't. They don't care that much so they haven't made any more attempts to stop her.\n\nWhat do I do? I don't care about it running around as many of our neighbors let their dogs do that. But I can not have it attacking my cats and dogs.\n\nEdit: \"Our cats\" are really just feral cats who've been in the neighborhood longer than I have. And the neighbor's cats who don't feed them so I have taken responsibility. There is 0 law about cats where I live and none of the neighbors have complained about the cats. I am currently finding homes for all of them. My dog is a rescued dog who has an appointment to get fixed with all her puppies later in the month. I know that I should not have let her out of the yard and I did feel shitty about it. But she has attachment issues so when I say she stayed close I mean she was in between my legs as I was walking. And I'd like to reiterate that animal control is called ALL THE TIME. Probably 15 times in April alone. The neighbors get him back every single time.

These little guys are relentless they\u2019d show up in the kitchen, bathroom, even around the washer/dryer. I figured I\u2019d post this in case others are dealing with the same spring/summer invasion.\n\nOver the last two years, we tested a bunch of different ant baits, and these are the ones that actually made a dent. Hope this helps someone!\n\nWhy Ant Bait Performance Varies So Much Here\n\nBefore I get to the list, here are a few things I noticed that impacted how well baits worked:\n\nSeasonal Shifts: In colder months, they seemed more interested in protein than sugar. In warmer months, they go after anything sweet.\n\nRain + Humidity: Outdoor baits often got diluted or washed out unless they were covered.\n\nAnt Type: We mostly dealt with odorous house ants, but sometimes I\u2019d see other types that weren\u2019t as responsive to sugar baits.\n\nTop 5 Ant Baits That Actually Helped\n\n1. Terro T300 Liquid Baits\n\nWhy we liked it: Super easy to use, very effective when the ants are in sugar-mode.\n\nDownside: Needed multiple placements and refreshes, especially during big waves.\n\n2. Advion Ant Gel\n\nWhy we liked it: The ants took to it fast. Seems to be a favorite if they\u2019re after protein.\n\nDownside: Can get messy if not careful with application.\n\n3. Amdro Ant Block Granules\n\nWhy we liked it: Great for perimeter use outside. It held up decently in our garden beds.\n\nDownside: Didn\u2019t seem to help much with the ants inside.\n\n4. Hot Shot MaxAttrax Bait Stations\n\nWhy we liked it: Easy to toss in discreet places. We used these in the garage and laundry room.\n\nDownside: Didn\u2019t always seem to be the ants\u2019 first choice.\n\n5. Savitri Ant Gel (harder to find)\n\nWhy we liked it: This stuff seemed to shut down a persistent trail we had going under the kitchen sink.\n\nDownside: It\u2019s more of a pro product not always available in local stores.\n\nA Few Tips That Made a Difference\n\nPlacement Matters: We followed trails to find their entry points and dropped bait close by.\n\nDon\u2019t Kill the Scouts: We made that mistake early on. Let them carry bait back to the colony.\n\nClean Up Competing Food: Any crumbs or sticky spots will distract them from the bait.\n\nStick With It: It usually took several days to a week to see full results.\n\nWe eventually got to a place where ant sightings dropped to near zero. We still keep a few bait traps out during the warmer months as a preventative measure.

Everyone said it was a water leak on here. \n\nI had the inspector out today, and they saw that the B vent that attaches to the roof to vent out the water heater and furnace natural gas combustion had broken off. \n\nPhoto attached here https://imgur.com/a/XH7Fa7T\n\nThere\u2019s also some mold on the sheathing in this area and some of the insulation is a bit compressed due to condensation. The inspector said the mold gets much less the further from the b vent area you go. \n\nMy house is 2200 square feet 2 story (square shape) built in early 2000s. I\u2019m in the Pacific Northwest. \n\nThe roofer came out with my inspector and both looked at the roof that was put on in 2021 with a ridge vent and they said there was no obvious defects to the roof installation. \n\nSome of the siding in a small area near this area of the roof seems to need to be replaced. Inspector said the framing wood still feels solid. \n\nThe cause stated is that wind vibrations likely blew the B vent off. The moisture the inspector stated is from the B vent that the water heater and 80% efficient furnace feed to creating condensate after combustion. It normally would send this up to the roof to combust out of that vent but is instead venting into the attic. \n\nI want to confirm does this sound right to everyone? I did not know that b vents that offload combusted natural gas to vent outdoors produce that much moisture to cause mold or moisture issues in a a crawl space. That seemed odd to me since you always think of combustion has being a dry process. \n\nThe insurance subreddit seems to think this won\u2019t be covered. I\u2019m disabled(muscular dystrophy)  so I can\u2019t get up into the attic to do any remediation. The timing if this is really awful too since I\u2019m starting a new job on Monday. \n\nThe most impacted area seems to be a small sized bedroom. \n\nHow much can I expect to pay to get things back up and in a good spot? I literally had no idea that this was even happening. This issue wasn\u2019t present in our 2020 inspection and this vent was shown attached then. I\u2019m more worried about getting the diagnosis right so we don\u2019t spend a lot to fix it then have to do it a second time if we didn\u2019t address the root cause. \n\nMore photos: https://imgur.com/a/yp9S1lK\n\nEdit: I did turn off the furnace and water heater for now. We have a gas fireplace to keep us warm fortunately. Couldn\u2019t get a HVAC person out over the weekend so cold showers for now. \n\nBonus photos of siding and bedroom damage. https://imgur.com/a/kwY2e5E\n\nRest of house siding looks fine apart from that area\n\nBedroom is above a garage there\u2019s another bedroom beside this one. \n\nEdit 2: the inspector who\u2019s also a civil engineer said the wood framing was still solid so they didn\u2019t think that would need to get replaced.

We have looked around and there are no wasp nests or anything; we only found one in the umbrella last year and subsequently got rid of it. I can't even sit outside and enjoy the nice weather, so I am close to calling someone about this. I also live in an HOA so I'm not 100% sure if I can do anything else like spraying anything as it is it outside. Is there anything I can do further?   \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k7uf8l/tired_of_wasps_and_hornets_not_sure_how_to/", "created_utc": 1745611405.0, "score": 3, "author": "redhats14", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1k7uf8l/tired_of_wasps_and_hornets_not_sure_how_to/", "html_title": ""}

My husband and I purchased a house in late October of 2024, this is our first house and we have been over the moon that our dream of homeownership has finally come true after years of disappointments and letdowns. \nUpon moving in we were quite surprised to find that the previous homeowners weren\u2019t exactly\u2026 cleanly. This came as a big surprise to us as we\u2019ve known them (not extremely closely) for quite some time and actually bought the house in a private sale. \nWhen they moved out, unfortunately they didn\u2019t clean anything in the house\u2014 at all. \nSince we were on a big time crunch (due to them staying in the home weeks after closing and us coming up on our deadline to move or pay rent again) I did my best to clean each room as we moved stuff in. \nThe house was FILTHY, animal hair and dander everywhere, old food splattered everywhere, we immediately had to replace the stove and dishwasher because of the nasty inside of them. I had to order a throw away pack of spin mop heads just to clean the floors. \nFast forward to the past few weeks. We\u2019ve been noticing some small bugs that I fear maybe be roaches. We will see them when we move things around and they scurry away before we can get a good look at them. We have NEVER had roaches in our lives and it\u2019s making me physically sick thinking we have them now. I have cleaned my house to the point of insanity and we don\u2019t know what to do from this point to get ahead of the problem before we have a full blown outbreak that becomes unmanageable. My mind is blown that we are having this issue because my husband and I clean daily and in terms of cleanliness our home is not a museum but by no means is it dirty. \nPlease if you\u2019ve ever had roaches, what do we do?! My Amazon cart is loaded up with tons of traps and foggers but I don\u2019t know if they work.

My washer broke down recently, and instead of replacing it, I decided to try to fix it. \n\nMy wife and kids don\u2019t quite get why I\u2019m so hyped about this.

One visit from a technician to replace a basic part made me realize that it was such a waste. That was the moment I decided that if something breaks again, I will at least try to fix it myself before calling in a pro.\n\nNow to the issue - This time was the water inlet valve. it wasn\u2019t shutting off the hot water.

{"title": "Basement outer wall questions", "selftext": "I was looking for advice for fixing/finishing my basement.\n\nBackground: we bought this house last August (first time home buyers). Thanksgiving hits and sewer backs up out of the basement bathroom stall shower. We get the problem solved for the time being (tree roots) and begin to clean up the basement. In the process of that we find that all the carpet has to get ripped out as it is plainly obvious this isn't the first time it has happened. While tearing out the carpet we find mold at the base of several walls so we have to take the affected drywall out and deal with the mold. Then we find the previous owner didn't even have the stall shower seated on the drain so when it \"drained\" the water just went under it and could spread through the basement, so then that had to come out. Then the sink next to it basically fell apart because it was rotted and the shower was holding it up. \n\nPicture of concern.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/oVmYNnw\n\nSo now here I am, basement basically torn to studs and that is it. It was supposed to be my daughter's room. I would like to get the basement back to livable so she can have her own space back. I would like some advice with insulating the walls and sealing this crack. This crack was found after some of the mold affected drywall was taken down. It sits about halfway up one of the outer walls, around the midpoint, but is only along about 6 feet. The wall is still square and there is no bulge or bow on the wall. It appears to be cinderblock. My wife understandibly wants me to seal it before anything else gets done. I need to get it sealed so I can run electrical because the current layout has outlets in horrible spots and I need to run new wire anyway because some previous owner daisychained practically every outlet into 1 breaker. I wish I was kidding, but when it flips the whole basement goes as well as three rooms upstairs, which is almost the whole house...\n\n1. What would I need to seal this Crack? \n\n2. What do I need to check or verify before I do so? We have had a fair bit of rain lately and there was no hint of water damage or leakage from the outer wall, all water damage found originated from the floor on the inner side.\n\n3.

{"title": "Basement sewage backup - Cap for toilet rough-in", "selftext": "Hoping someone can give some advice. We bought our house last June, and in September we had an issue in our basement toilet with sewage backup. It flowed into portions of our basement, and we had to get a crew to cleanup and we made an insurance claim. The basement didn't have a real bathroom - it was just a toilet in a closed off room, and the sewage came from out of the toilet. Since then, we've done work to remediate, removed the toilet, and capped off the rough-in. We are planning work to be done to add a backflow valve for our laundry sink, and we are keeping the toilet capped off, as in the future we will be adding a bathroom to a separate part of the basement, so we don't need that toilet back in place.\n\nThe question I have is about the type of cap on the toilet. We had a plumber come out to give us quotes on some additional work down there, and asked him about the cap - his reco was to break up the concrete and add a backwater check valve for the rough-in, and then replace the concrete that they broke up. But this is a cost we were hoping to not incur, as we are afraid that down the line when we want to add rough-ins for the future bathroom, that we will repeating some of this work and overpaying since they will have to break up concrete again down the line. But, we also don't want to be at risk of another sewage backup.\n\nSo my main question is whether the type of cap we currently have would hold up to a sewage backflow. Late last year we discovered there was some tree root growth on the county's sewage that could have contributed to this sewage issue - but no one has been able to confirm for us what exactly caused it, as we were actually on vacation when it happened, so no one was using the plumbing. So we have to assume it could possibly happen again someday. I would like to believe the Plumber at face value, but feel I need to do some due diligence to feel comfortable that I'm not being sold something unnecessary.\n\nHere is a photo of the cap we have for the rough-in to give you an idea of what we are using:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/BpytrlB](https://imgur.com/a/BpytrlB)\n\nDoes anyone have any experience/knowledge with these types of caps?

{"title": "Photographers: Some real talk about making those real estate shots actually SELL houses", "selftext": "Been shooting real estate for about 8 years now, and wanted to share some hard-earned wisdom for anyone struggling with those tricky property shots (especially empty homes).\nLight is EVERYTHING. I cannot stress this enough. The difference between an amateur and pro real estate shot is almost always about light management. I've started scheduling my shoots based on sun direction - east-facing rooms in morning, west-facing in afternoon. For north-facing rooms (the bane of my existence), I bring my own lighting kit. It's not just about brightness, but quality of light.\nFor those interior spaces that feel \"dead\" on camera - a quick tip is to shoot with all interior lights ON, but balance with natural light. The warmth from interior bulbs against cooler window light creates depth that flat, single-source lighting never will. Just watch your white balance!\nNow about staging... as photographers, we're often stuck with whatever condition the homeowner has left the place in. I've started offering \"micro-staging\" as part of my packages - basically I bring a small kit with neutral throw pillows, a few plants, and some basic decor items that I can quickly place to make a room feel more alive. Takes me 10 extra minutes but dramatically improves the final images.\nFor completely empty properties, I've been experimenting with different approaches:\n\n1. Wide angle + low position technique to make spaces feel larger\n2. Focus on architectural features and natural light\n3. Virtual staging (this is where things get interesting)\n\nI was honestly resistant to virtual staging for YEARS. The early stuff looked so obviously fake that I worried it would hurt my professional reputation. But the technology has improved so much recently. I've been testing different services and some of the AI platforms now can create genuinely impressive staged images that are hard to distinguish from the real thing.\nJust be upfront with your clients and potential buyers - always label virtually staged images clearly.

{"title": "Roof claim with State Farm", "selftext": "I have never filed a roof claim or any claim for that matter until recently. We had two pretty severe hail and wind storms blow through and after all of the storm chasers left, I called a few reputable roofing companies and both asked me who my carrier was. When I said State Farm, they both said that my claim process, before even looking at the roof, will be difficult as State Farm tends to deny, minimize, or underpay claims. Both looked at my roof and said the same thing, extensive hail damage with over 18 \"dings\" per square and the metal vents and gutters were all dinged pretty badly. The one guy said that most carriers want to see 8 dings per square, but State Farm tends to want to see at least 10. The adjustor came out and met with my roof guy, and my guy said the adjustor noted even more damage than him and this was a pretty text book claim for hail damage roof replacement. State Farm called me to say that they were working on my claim and that my connected patio would not be covered as the damage from what she said was due to \"wear and tear\" but she was still looking at everything but felt she would be able to authorize \"some repairs\". This already sounds nickel and dime to me. I have a 1% deductible meaning I am going to have to pay roughly 6500 right off the bat for my deductible and I am not sure how a connected roof could be damaged due to wear and tear but the rest of the roof is hail damage? Also my roofer said that he would come to let them know that the partial replacement would not meet code requirements in my county. Anybody else have a similar experience with State Farm or had a similar issue? I found it upsetting that both roofers called out State Farm, especially because over the last four years they raised my rates 20%, 20%, 15%, 15%, and another 400 per year because we had a pool installed.

{"title": "How do I get people to stop using my driveway as a turn-around?", "selftext": "I need advice on how to deter drivers from using my driveway as their personal U-turn spot. I've lived here for 6 months now and it's been the worst so far now that spring is here and there are lawncare vehicles out and about with trailers and heavy machinery. It's not only them, it's also delivery vehicles and big moving trucks.\n\nThere are three signs before the end of the street that clearly state No Outlet/Dead End. Yet, people still drive all the way down. The street literally ends in nothing but forest. There have NEVER been homes, businesses, or even a hint of another road beyond it, so it's not like this was ever a shortcut to anywhere. I'd understand if these vehicles were trying to get to the houses on the end, but they never are. My driveway is twice the size of my neighbors' and is a couple hundred feet long, which is why I assume they keep choosing mine to turn around in. There is a space at the end of the street, not quite a culdesac, but enough room for most vehicles to turn around comfortably, yet they choose to stop before they get there and back into my property.\n\nThe driveway and my property are getting damaged now. It was refinished before I bought the house to an extent, it still could use some work, and now I understand that it was probably done by the previous homeowners because of the same issue. They back up and ram their trailers up the curb and chip away the edge of the asphalt. I can't get grass to grow in the spot between the drive and the mailbox because they're always running it over as well. I've had to replace 6 of my solar lights already. The last straw was late afternoon yesterday when I had my car parked closer to the end to bring some new landscaping materials to the front beds easier. A big blue truck with a giant trailer came barreling down the street. He went all the way to the end, but instead of using that free space to turn around, he put it in reverse and backed up all the way to my driveway and then started backing his trailer into it, nearly hitting my car. When he realized he wouldn't fit, he moved over and used part of my driveway and the neighbor's yard instead.\n\nI've tried reasoning with the fact that the signs should be enough, but they clearly aren\u2019t.

My neighbors and I have a shared sidewalk, with the property line basically going right down the center of it. We each have a backyard on either side of that shared sidewalk. The yards themselves are NOT shared.\n\nNeighbors have 3 large dogs which they let out loose. In the 5 years I've been here, I haven't been able to actually use my backyard. It smells. I have stepped in poop. They've dug up my gardens and chewed up my stuff. The grass is mostly dead from urine, and I don't have a dog.\n\nI collected old wrought iron fence panels and put them up. I barricaded my patio with my porch furniture, where I can't easily put a fence. They are still getting in. I think one of them is jumping the fence.\n\nThis year I want to actually use my patio and yard, which means taking down the barricade I've made with my furniture. I plan on putting in more gardens and attempting to salvage/grow grass, which is going to take time and cost money.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:  \n\\- Talking to them: They put an old mattress in my garage last fall. We found it the next morning and asked them to move it, and while we were speaking of it we also asked them to not put their trash cans in our driveway on trash day so I can get my car out without having to move them, stop putting their trash in our trash cans, and please keep their dogs out of our yard. Basically a \"please respect my property\" conversation. They were not receptive, and the girlfriend started yelling. I'm pretty sure she would've gotten physical if she didn't literally bounce off the barricade while trying to get in our faces. I'm not looking forward to trying to talk about it again. The neighbor on their other side has spoken to them about it as well with marginally more success, but the effects only last a couple of days.  \n\\- We sent them a certified letter about a week ago stating our intentions of taking down the barricade and asking them to please keep their dogs from entering our yard. They signed for the letter, they're still letting the dogs out loose.  \n\\- We spoke to the police, who said it is a civil issue and there's nothing they can do. They recommended getting cameras, which we are going to install this week.  \n\\- We went to the borough, who repeated it is a civil issue and suggested I put up a taller fence. I can't afford to do that nor do I want to, and I don't think their dogs should be my problem, financially or otherwise.\n\nWe have considered hiring someone to clean up the poop and repair the grass and then taking them to small claims court for the cost with video evidence of their dogs causing the damage, but that's a last resort and also may not be successful. There are leash laws here, but getting that enforced will be next to impossible since the dogs aren't running around the streets, just my yard.\n\nToday I will be taking down the barricade.

Not trying to pitch anything, just sharing what I\u2019ve seen actually matter:\n\n* **Good photos = better tenants and more $** Doesn\u2019t matter how nice the place is \u2014 if the lighting is bad or the space looks cramped, people scroll right past it. \n* **Staging helps way more than people think** I used to roll my eyes at staging, but it really does change how people *feel* about a place. Even little things like a cozy throw blanket or moving a lamp can shift the vibe.\n* **If it looks like a fixer, people will lowball** Even if it's just outdated light fixtures or scuffed paint \u2014 people assume there's more work hiding under the surface. Quick cosmetic updates can seriously change the game.\n* **Tenants and buyers both want stories** Not literally, but \u201csunlight in the mornings\u201d or \u201cquiet street with a killer taco truck nearby\u201d hits harder than just square footage and room count.\n\nAnyway, happy to chat if anyone\u2019s got questions \u2014 always down to trade tips or vent about showing-day chaos \ud83d\ude05", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1k5l4d4/stuff_ive_learned_as_a_rental_selling_agent_that/", "created_utc": 1745365422.0, "score": 13, "author": "Opposite-Hat904", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/homeowners/comments/1k5l4d4/stuff_ive_learned_as_a_rental_selling_agent_that/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Experiences and advice for house poverty", "selftext": "Seeking advice for those who have been through it. Apologies in advance for the long post, I was born a yapper. \n\nMy fiance and I are closing on a house this week which will be our first home. We are qualifying on just my income, but he will be contributing to expenses. PITI+HOA will only be about $200 more than we are currently paying in rent, but with increased utilities and unexpected expenses, I\u2019m anticipating a period of \u201chouse poverty\u201d for us. He is in graduate school and will graduate in 2 years. Average starter salary in his industry is around $120k/year straight out of school on the low end (some make up to $200k straight out of school), so this is a strategic move because once\u2019s he\u2019s graduated and working, our DTI will be incredibly manageable. For the time being, our monthly will be about 45% of my take-home (again, he\u2019s contributing some but not a ton).\n\nWe\u2019ll be house poor for a few years. After PITI, HOA, and utilities are paid, we should have about $2400/month for groceries and other living expenses. We have $15k saved for emergencies. Neither of us has a car payment, I don\u2019t have a phone payment and don\u2019t pay for gas as my job provides both my cell phone and my vehicle. The only other recurring monthly expense would be our car insurance, HelloFresh, Netflix, and Amazon Prime (the latter 2 I could easily cancel and might consider canceling HelloFresh as well if I decide I can grocery shop for cheaper). We also won\u2019t be paying for internet as my job provides that. \n\nI see such severe warnings on this sub of paying over 30% of your net on housing, but I think most of that advice is directed towards people who have other debts, who have kids, and who are already set in their income without expecting a major increase (as I am with my fianc\u00e9). We don\u2019t vacation much and don\u2019t feel the need to\u2014I travel plenty for work to get that \u201cfix\u201d and he\u2019s a homebody who doesn\u2019t enjoy traveling anyway. \n\nFor those who wonder why we bought now instead of waiting for him to graduate: Prices in our area are great right now and we got a really good interest rate so we wanted to bite\u2026plus our lease is up soon. The area is kind of barren right now but developing like crazy with tons of room for more development in coming years. The house appraised $11k above offer so we already have some equity. We\u2019d also like to start trying for kids once he graduates, and we both agree that we\u2019d rather face house poverty when it\u2019s just us two than when we have kids in the picture. \n\nFor those who have faced house poverty: how did it affect you? Were you worried about being able to pay for groceries and home necessities? Or did you define house poverty as not being able to vacation or go out and enjoy pleasantries with friends?

My understanding is that loan officers are making money based on the size of the loan and interests so if you buy down points to lower interests they will be making less, is my understanding correct?\n\nAnd if you decide to wait for the rates to drop instead to refinance then it\u2019s more of a gamble since no one knows for sure when that will happen and with how much.
