{"title": "The unfortunate truth about Top Secret Recipes. The future of this sub.", "selftext": "I\u2019m a chef, and I subscribe to many great cooking subreddits. I stumbled upon this sub over the last few days along with many others. I feel like there is a top secret truth to why we don\u2019t see many actual recipes from our favorite corporate restaurants. \n\nThe unfortunate truth is, most of these recipes were developed in laboratory style kitchens, with ingredients that aren\u2019t commonly found in home kitchens. They were designed with cost and mass production in mind. Almost any sauce you love from a chain restaurant is composed of an emulsified oil, or sugar mixture, with flavorings, colors and preservatives. \n\nThe people who know these recipes aren\u2019t workers at your average fast food restaurant. They are food scientists, who are not going to divulge proprietary information in this forum. \n\nMy suggestion for this subs future, is to focus on best homemade substitutes that come as close as possible to the original.  \n\nI would suggest changing the flair options to things like \u2018sauces\u2019, \u2018sandwich\u2019, \u2018fried chicken\u2019, \u2018baked goods\u2019, etc. We might get some better information this way. \n\nSome things can be learned from the people who work at these restaurants. These things are more about procedure, than ingredients. For example, Bojangles biscuits recipe. They use regular Pillsbury biscuit flour. What makes them great, is the way they prepare them. We should encourage this kind of content. The way a place makes their fried chicken, what makes it special. These are things that we can learn from a sub like this. \n\nI think we need to give up on waiting for somebody to deliver the actual recipe for chic-fil-a sauce. We don\u2019t actually want to make that recipe. We want to find close enough recipes that can be tested and confirmed by this community. \n\nI think we\u2019re all here because we see the potential of this sub. It just needs some guidance, and a better focus to move forward.\n\n\n\nEdit: Well this has been fun. Y\u2019all are a great bunch. Because I\u2019m a chef, I must leave you now, to bury myself in work for the next 12 hours. I\u2019ll catch you on the other side!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dfhwxr/the_unfortunate_truth_about_top_secret_recipes/", "created_utc": 1570631756.0, "score": 11716, "author": "forgreatnessalways", "num_comments": 315, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dfhwxr/the_unfortunate_truth_about_top_secret_recipes/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["[deleted]", "I\u2019m happy for u/forgreatnessalways to be our new president", "Nice try McDonald\u2019s.

{"title": "Two Ingredients You Didn\u2019t Know You Need", "selftext": "I figured alongside top secret recipes I could discuss some top secret recipe tips here. In relation to the sub, these two ingredients are found in just about all commercialized recipes requested here. If you\u2019re attempting to create a copycat, they could very well be the missing link.\n\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Lecithin \n\nWhile the two might sound scary, they\u2019re anything but. As Ann Reardon once said (paraphrasing), if I told to you add sodium bicarbonate to your recipe would you be skeptical? That\u2019s just baking soda. While you shouldn\u2019t take health advice from someone on the internet, knowingly or not, you\u2019re already most likely consuming both of these additives on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n**Xanthan Gum**\n\n\n\nWithout going into too much detail which I\u2019m unqualified to speak on, xanthan gum is a plant based powder that can be useful in everything from emulsifying to thickening.\n\n\nI recreate a lot at home and there\u2019s always something missing from homemade sauces, thickness. If you\u2019ve ever tried your own, you know what I mean. No amount of emulsification or reducing will leave you with the smooth thick texture of something store bought. That\u2019s where xanthan gum comes to play. Sometimes you\u2019ll achieve the perfect flavor in something seemingly watered down. In the standardized thickening process you\u2019ll lose that original flavor and end up going back and forth for a while before just giving up and settling. That\u2019s because the vast majority of sauces out there use xanthan gum as the primary source of thickening. I\u2019ve even used it on buffalo sauce to coat chicken wings better. \n\n\nIts uses can surprisingly spread far. You can throw some in an ice cream base for smoother ice cream, or even in a hot chocolate for a latte texture. When making something like a relish, xanthan gum can also be useful in preventing the ingredients from separating. \n\n\nYou\u2019re definitely going to want a scale when messing with this stuff but I\u2019d be a liar if I told you I\u2019ve never free balled it. You typically want to start at 0.05% of your liquid weight and move up in low increments until you\u2019ve achieved your desired consistency. 0.35% would be the maximum you should use so watch out or you\u2019ll ruin your recipe. \n\n\n**Soy Lecithin**\n\n\nLecithin is simply the god of ingredients when it comes to baking and it also happens to be another great emulsifier. If you want to take your kitchen to the next level, this is the next step. With it, not only will your sauces bind but your food will stay fresher and more moist for longer. It\u2019s almost a necessity in baked goods. \n\n\nBasically, lecithin powder just holds onto moisture really well. It will keep things soft for days and prevent staling. It\u2019s perfect for any baked goods you want to remain moist. Almost all of commercialized soft baked goods use this but also restaurants that prepare items a day or so in advanced. It\u2019s also great for breads! \n\n\nYou can also get lecithin in liquid form for perfect emulsification that won\u2019t split. One downside is that liquid lecithin is hydrophobic so it will only work well with oil based sauces like salad dressings, for example. \n\n\nThe ratio for lecithin in baking is pretty self explanatory. Just 1% of the flour weight. For liquid lecithin in emulsification, you want to use 1% of the oil. \n\n\nBoth of these ingredients are tasteless and can be incorporated into your daily use. They have no affect on recipes apart from their intended purposes so everything else stays exactly the same including ingredients, measurements, and process. \n\n\nI tend to see a lot of copycat recipes fail simply because they try to get around and avoid using some necessary ingredients. It\u2019s been stated here before but the vast majority of chain restaurant and commercial products are developed using an abundance of ingredients not available in your typical grocery store. While not for everyone, these two ingredients are almost a powerhouses in commercial cooking but can also be used in your normal day to day recipes. Why not give it a shot? Experiment a bit. Take the time to crack your favorite recipes yourself or just improve your everyday meals.

{"title": "The actual KFC recipe", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I have a recipe that I found a long time ago, apparently it is the current KFC corporate recipe, as it was written in 2010. There may have been slight changes to the recipe up to now but I doubt it since the ingredients are easy to get.\n\nThe secret is said to be in the marinade, as it gives it an unmatched flavor. What it says it contains is \u201cpotassium\u201d but I did some research and through experiments I came to the conclusion that it is tetra potassium pyrophosphate. It is the only molecule that works well, since other products that contain potassium would be \u201cpotassium nitrate\u201d, \u201cpotassium chloride\u201d, \u201cpotassium carbonate\u201d and these do not give our meat organoleptic characteristics. Bottle Concantrate Chicken is an ingredient that is mentioned for the marinade and it contains other main ingredients such as chicken concentrate, corn starch, salt, sugar, chicken fat, citric acid, natural flavors.\n\nThe marinade can vary by country and region, as many KFCs are franchises and are not authorized to carry all of the KFC (now Kentucky Fried Chicken) corporate ingredients. Some marinades may contain other potassium and sodium phosphates, as well as sodium bicarbonate. All of these help to keep the meat juicy and slow down the oxidation process of fats and meat, which gives the meat a rancidity (refrigerated flavor). They can be more antioxidants like ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid. But the former are acids which could unbalance the pH of our marinade.\n\nAnother secret is the breading part, as skimmed milk powder and egg powder are used to combine it with the flour.\n\nMSG is essential since it is found in almost all processed foods in all fast food restaurants. It is a widely used flavour enhancer, although another commonly used enhancer is yeast extract, which is an extract of amino acids and nucleotides from the yeast Saccaromyces Cerviseae that gives foods a umami flavour. The sugar present in chicken concentrate is also essential, since for curing chicken and other meats, a little sugar is needed to start the curing process of the meat and enhance that umami flavour even more. We all know that ferments (umami) have a different flavour than the original foods, for example anchovies (fish), fish sauce (fish), miso paste (soy, rice), soy sauce (soy beans), hams (fresh meat), cheddar and parmesan cheese (dairy derivatives), Worcestershire sauce (soy and mollusks), sausages (fresh meat), pickled olives (olive trees), among many others\u2026\n\nI leave the document in the photo.

I have personally used this recipe countless times over the years and I can say with absolute certainty that this recipe, despite denials about its authenticity by KFC itself when it surfaced a decade ago, is in fact the real deal as far as I am concerned.\n\nI have shared it with others along the way too and in every single instance the feedback from friends who have prepared it is that they share the same view as myself. It's so authentic that not only does it smell and taste the same when prepared, but also after it's been refrigerated and pulled out to eat as leftovers.\n\nI have decided, with permission of course, to share the recipe here today for everyone to have and enjoy anytime they want. As you may note, the recipe lists precisely 11 herbs and spices which, in my view based on all the evidence and notwithstanding KFC's denials about it, are the original herbs and spices that make up the Original KFC Recipe.\n\n**Here is what me and others believe to be the Colonel's Original KFC Recipe:**\n\n**Prep. Ingredients:**\n\n4 cups oil  \n1 cup milk or water  \n2 eggs  \n1 cup flour\n\n**11 Herbs and Spices:**\n\n1/4 tsp. mace  \n1/4 tsp. paprika  \n1/4 tsp. curry powder  \n1/8 tsp. oregano  \n1/8 tsp. thyme  \n1/8 tsp. sage  \n1/8 tsp. savoury  \n1/8 tsp. marjoram (spice)  \n2 tsp. barbecue spice  \n3 tsp. seasoned salt  \n3 tsp. poultry seasoning\n\nSalt and Pepper (on top of the 11 herbs and spices)\n\n1/4 tsp. black pepper  \n1 tsp. salt\n\n**Notes:**\n\nKeep in mind, the measurements have to be absolutely precise in order to achieve desired authenticity.\n\nFor every cup of flour, you mix into it the listed ingredients. If you want more than what the recipe yields, simply increase all of the ingredients proportionately.\n\nFor best results, I normally dip the chicken into corn starch, then into the egg and milk wash (combine the egg and milk during prep.), and then into the flour/spice mixture.\n\nThe only tricky part of doing this is compensating for the difference in cooking method. At KFC, they use a special type of pressure fryer that evenly cooks the chicken in a quick enough period of time that the skin does not burn. That being said, when using traditional home kitchen deep frying methods, it can be challenging to cook the chicken through to the bone without overcooking the seasonings. I get around this by using boneless chicken breast (it turns out perfect every single time) or by partially pre-cooking the bone-in chicken pieces (i.e. legs, breasts, thighs) in the oven to a point where 6-7 minutes in the fryer finishes the job. Depending on the cooking temperature, of course, that's about how long you can cook it before the skin is at risk of being overcooked. I guarantee that once you've prepared it a couple times, you'll find exactly what works for you too.\n\nAll I do ask for sharing this elusive recipe today is that people who use it also come back here and share their experiences with it.\n\nI have gotten years of delicious chicken out of this recipe and now everyone else can enjoy it as much as I and other have over the last decade.\n\n**Bon Appetit!**\n\nEDIT: Added missing unit of measurement to black pepper ingredient", "There are specific brands that are best, but I won\u2019t be able to give you more of an answer until I get home this evening after work. \n\nI will get back to you.", "> it reminds them of what KFC chicken tasted like years ago \u2013 before the MSG was added and other changes were made to save money\n\nHahaha...

The way the recipe  is written it sounds like it.", "It\u2019s been seven months since I posted this recipe and, as you can probably imagine, I have received feedback from literally hundreds of people who have tried the recipe, reaching out to say thanks and give it two thumbs up.\n\nI really appreciate everyone\u2019s feedback and enjoyed providing support and clarifications to those who had questions along the way.\n\nI\u2019m revisiting my post today for two reasons.\n\nFirst, I want to share some of my thoughts and conclusions about this recipe.\n\nIt\u2019s been about a decade since I first came across this recipe. Since that time, I have used it to prepare chicken more times than I have kept track. I have always known since day 1 that, unlike the many dozens of copy-cat recipes that have been around forever, this is the real deal. I have never doubted it.\n\nAlong the way, I have shared the recipe with many of my friends. Not once has someone come back with negative feedback. In fact, I haven\u2019t met one person whose used the recipe and wasn\u2019t convinced of its authenticity. \n\nSeven months ago, I decided to share the recipe on Reddit. On the basis of the notion \u201cyou can\u2019t please everyone\u201d and the fact that regardless of any given reality about something, there\u2019s always people who will be critical, dissenting, and often vitriol. Fact of the matter is, however, this hasn\u2019t been the case by any measure with this recipe despite how many people have by now tried it.\n\nAfter myself using it many, many times for over a decade and taking into consideration: (a) all of the positive feedback from friends, family, and even a handful of professional colleagues along away; and (b) the overwhelming feedback received here since April; I think there can be no doubt at this point in anyone\u2019s mind that this recipe is indeed authentic.\n\nSecond reason for revisiting the post, I have been using a slightly modified version of the recipe that\u2019s healthier and doesn\u2019t alter the taste. \n\nInstead of using an egg wash before dredging the chicken through the flour/spices mixture, I am using olive oil.\n\nPut the chicken into a bowl and add just enough oil to coat all of it. That\u2019s it. After that, dredge the chicken and deep fry. \n\nThank you again, everyone who has tried the recipe and those of you who have commented or messaged me since April. \n\nKeep enjoying!", "This is the Holy Grail jfc", "Chicken Grease & Salt", "There is a fantastic food YouTuber from Canada who has a pressure fryer and is working through various recipes sent into him. I will make sure to comment with this recipe. \n\nCheck out the series. So satisfying to see these done with a real pressure fryer. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/vOPdps7fcAI", "Finally got around to making this.\n\nHoly FUCK it is GOOD. I am NOT disappointed.", "Thanks, we will be giving this a try", "YES!", "With the prep ingredients, seems like it would be milk and not water. \n\nSaved this to try in the future", "What\u2019s \u201csavoury\u201d?", "I\u2019m excited to try this with gluten free flour.

Thank you!!", "I will have to try this out, for science.\n\nIm not surprised based on the article of KFCs actions, there is a good chance that people in the past have in fact given confirmed recipes, and KFC kept it hidden.

Just have to be careful with the salt as it can quickly overpower in that scenario. Tastes just like a hibachi restaurant prepared it.", "From u/thetitan555 in a thread from two years again. This is directly copied and pasted. I\u2019ve made some myself and it tastes great!\n\nUnless you're doing Asian cooking, and by Asian cooking I mean full heat on a wok. Fried rice needs to be stirred constantly so it doesn't burn. It's not grilled cheese where you can shitpost on Reddit between flips.\n\n\u20ac: This has got some traction. Fried rice is good. You want to make it?\n\nCook some rice. Make enough for one more serving than you need. It's lunch tomorrow. Rinse it out by pouring water into the rice and pouring it back out. Don't worry if you lose a little rice, we have an extra serving to work with. Repeat until you get bored. Let it cook while you're doin other shit.\n\nFigure out what you want. Green onions take less effort to cut than regular onions. Don't use baby carrots, they cook too fast. Chop that shit up. Don't hold the knife only by the black/wood part, squeeze the metal part between your thumb and curled index finger like you're pressing a button on a SNES controller. Put your veggies in custard cups.\n\nAny and all meat works, but any more kinds than two gets inconsistent and distracting. Three tops. Cook that shit in a separate pan. If it's chicken, beef, pork, etc. fry it in soy sauce on max heat. Brown is tasty, black means start over. Cook on all sides. If you're unsure, use an internal thermometer. If it's bacon, fry it regularly. Using soy sauce will just drown it when the fat comes in. Chop it up, set it in custard cups.\n\nGrab an egg. Set it in a custard cup so you don't have to worry about it rolling off. Grab a bottle of soy sauce. Grab a wok, put it on max heat. Pull out your rice. If it isn't done, shitpost on Reddit till it is. Good shit.\n\nNow we cook. Grab some oil, coconut is best, veggie oil next, olive oil is a waste. Put it in till it starts to simmer. Throw all your veggies in. Shake that shit while keeping it on the heat. Leave it for a few seconds between shakes. Keep it on its toes. After a bit, your veggies will be done. Toss your rice in. All of it. Throw a fuckton of soy sauce in there. This is what makes fried rice good. Your bottle will have visibly less sauce when you're done. Stir that shit. Wooden spoon, none of that spatula bullshit. Keep goin. Your arm will get a workout from moving so much rice around. Throw the egg in if you get bored. Scramble it before it cooks. When it's done throw your meat in ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) and put that shit in bowls. Salt and a dash more soy.\n\nLet your wok cool a little, then clean it out. If you don't, you get a ton of rice crud at the bottom which your roommate will NOT appreciate. You're done. If you want some more acidity, you're wrong. You want spice. Put a small amount of chili powder in and stir. More if you have no capsaicin receptors or are a masochist. I won't judge.\n\nPut whatever you don't eat in Tupperware. Like Mac and cheese, fried rice is best eaten as leftovers. Dig in. Enjoy.\n\n\u20ac2: u/VapeThisBro has a nice tip: Use chopsticks to stir instead of a wooden spoon.\n\n\u20ac3: Evidently I need to learn to cook and write more shit like this.

I just throw it end towards the end and mix it all up. \n\n\nIf you wanna read through a really thorough write up to try and refine your own fried rice at home here\u2019s an article that helped me a lot. \n\nhttps://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/the-food-lab-how-to-make-best-fried-rice-chinese-thai-wok-technique-right-type-of-rice.html", "I was a hibachi chef for 2 years in college. There's really not much to it but there are some things that are going to limit you from making it taste like it does in the restaurant - specifically the cooking equipment. The hibachi grills typically have a center burner that heats the table up insanely hot, this is key especially for fried rice.  This is why a wok will be preferred.\n\nA lot of recipes are going to tell you to use day old rice and that's because the rice has lost some of it's moisture during the cooling process which makes the texture much better. If you have time and you're doing this at home I'd suggest this route - otherwise after you cook your rice either spread it out flat on a cookie sheet continuously fluff it. In the restaurants we don't really have this option, we use hot sticky rice and spread it out on the table with the table set pretty hot. You'll also notice the chefs will move the rice a lot before they add any soy sauce/butter/garlic - this is all to get the rice a bit dry.   \n\n\nRest of the ingredients are straight forward but aren't really measured out, it's mostly to taste/experience but I'll throw some rough measurements down\n\n* 1 cup cooked long grain white rice/person\n* 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n* 1 egg for every 2 people\n* 1/8 cup diced onion, carrot & green onions\n* Salt & pepper to taste (lighter on salt - soy sauce will be added later)\n* 1 tbsp garlic (we typically used re-hydrated preminced garlic)\n* 1.5 tbsp margarine  (butter is expensive but better). \n* Soy sauce to taste - Kikkoman is most commonly used. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. In a wok fry your egg(s) - once cooked remove from wok and set to the side. \n2. Now crank the heat up to 11 - once the wok is extremely hot put in little vegetable oil and vegetable mix (onions, carrots, green onions) until onions are transparent\n3. Push vegetables to the side and pour remaining oil into wok and dump in rice\n4. Drizzle with salt and pepper and work the rice around wok and into a thin layer around wok surface until rice becomes visibly dry  then work the rice around the wok repeating this step until rice has become slightly crispy. \n5. Form hole in the middle of rice at the bottom of the wok, add butter & garlic, let melt for a moment and then quickly work into the rice going back to the flattened thin layer\n6. Form hole in the middle of rice and add soy sauce to the hole (we want the soy sauce to cook/burn a little bit) and quickly work into rice. You might have to spread the rice flat and evenly drizzle the soy sauce over the rice a time or two more to get it to the right taste.", "Butter, sesame oil, msg, soy sauce, maybe some sugar, fresh veggies, day old rice. Screaming hot pan (preferably a wok with those mini jet engine flames). All of these add to the flavor of those hibachi places. I'm sure there's other things I've left out but these will definitely get you close", "MSG", "I don't have measurements for you but the biggest secret is to cook your rice the day before and put it in the fridge.\n\nThen, the next day, you're ready to go. Oil a frying pan and put the heat on medium high. Crack an amount of eggs for the amount of people eating. Toss a generous amount of butter in along with the cold rice. Hit it over the top with soy sauce and stir fry the whole shebang. Don't be afraid to add oil if things aren't moving as well as it should and definitely don't be afraid to add butter. During the stir fry, hit it with the seasonings you like. I keep it simple with garlic salt and pepper. Once it gets to the color your recognize from the hibachi place, you're good to go.", "Something I haven't seen pointed out is the amount of room used to make the fried rice. They use fresh rice so more moisture has to get out. To help at home with that, make the rice a day before.\n\nAlso mentioned is butter. I've worked at 2 local grills. One used fake liquid garlic butter in a squeeze bottle, the other used *salted sticks of real butter, not the hydrogenated oil stuff. \n\nAlso, salt and pepper. We used very little soy sauce at either place. \n\nLast thing I'll mention, we always fried the veggies separate and added towards the end with the egg.  I can't comment on how to incorporate meat, we never did that at either place.", "I make a bomb hibachi fried rice.

Three days before, combine 10 cups water and all remaining soup ingredients except gelatin in large pot. Bring to boil, spooning off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until chicken pieces are very soft and beginning to fall apart, adding more water by cupfuls if necessary to keep chicken submerged, about 2 hours 30 minutes.\n2. Strain soup; discard solids. Return broth to same pot. Boil until reduced to 2 cups, about 35 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour 3 tablespoons water into small bowl; sprinkle gelatin over. Let stand until gelatin softens. Add to hot broth; stir until gelatin is dissolved. Transfer to 13x9x2-inch glass dish. Cover; refrigerate aspic overnight.\n3. Two days before, combine all filling ingredients in large bowl and mix with fork just until blended. Cut aspic into 1/3-inch cubes. Add 1/3 of the aspic cubes to pork mixture; stir gently with wooden spoon just until incorporated. Cover and refrigerate. Return aspic to refrigerator.\n4. Mix 1 cup black vinegar, 6 tablespoons soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons fresh ginger strips in small bowl. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.\n5. One day prior, line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 1 dumpling wrapper on work surface. Spoon 1 very generous teaspoon filling onto center of wrapper, including at least 2 aspic cubes.\n6. Lightly brush edges of dumpling wrapper with water. Bring 1 corner of wrapper up around filling, then pleat remaining edges of wrapper at regular intervals all around filling until filling is enclosed and wrapper forms bundle-like shape with small opening at top.\n7. Gather top edges of wrapper together and twist at top to enclose filling. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Refrigerate, covered, for 1 day, or freeze in single layer in covered containers for 2 weeks.\n8. On the day of, line each layer of bamboo steamer basket with cabbage leaves; place over wok filled with enough water to reach just below bottom of bamboo steamer basket. (Or line metal steamer rack with cabbage leaves and set over water in large pot.) Place dumplings atop cabbage, spacing apart.\n9. Bring water to boil. Cover; steam until cooked through, adding more water to wok if evaporating too quickly, about 12 minutes for fresh dumplings and 15 minutes for frozen.

If you don\u2019t, it can be made in a French press very easily (just leave the grounds in room temperature water, press when done brewing and move cold brew to a separate container) or even in a large Tupperware container (leave grounds and water until done brewing, strain when done). At Starbucks our ratio is 5lbs of coffee for 14 liters of water which is way way more than anyone at home will need. I usually just eyeball the amounts when I make a cold brew at home, although google can probably give you exact amounts if you like to measure. The brewing time at Starbucks is 20 hours. At home I usually brew for 12 if I want to drink the coffee as is or I brew for 24 hours if I plan to make it a concentrate and cut the coffee with plain water. I\u2019ve found that either work and end up tasting about the same, it really boils down to what you want your yield to be and how much coffee you drink. \n\nNow the flavorings - \n\nIn a grande (16 oz) we put in 2 pumps of vanilla directly in the cold brew. For the foam we mix our vanilla sweet cream with 1 pump of pumpkin spice syrup and then place in a specialized pitcher for making foam. \n\nStarbucks as well as other companies make vanilla coffee syrups that you can purchase at the grocery store. I would recommend using one of those. 2 pumps would be approx. 3 teaspoons of vanilla. Mix this with about 12 oz of cold brew, then add ice and leave space for the foam.\n\nFor the foam, I would recommend making a pseudo-whipped cream if you want it to float on top. At Starbucks we mix heavy cream, 2% milk, and vanilla to make the sweet cream, then we mix the pump of pumpkin spice to make the foam. At home, I would mix heavy cream, vanilla (syrup or extract would work here), and pumpkin spice and whip until you have soft peaks. Some grocery stores may sell a pumpkin spice syrup you can buy.

Since the pandemic, work has been super slow. And, like most chefs, I find it hard to not do something with my time. So, I started documenting a lot of my experiments in the kitchen, a lot of recreations of famous chain restaurants, and some of my own concoctions too! I have a full year planned out of how I want to make videos of each of these for my YT channel - which is also something I started doing with full force due to the pandemic!\n\nThere is a video of the [Popeye's Fried chicken recipe](https://youtu.be/elynVq6YINk), and on my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/honestcooks) you will also find other recreations like [Shake Shack Shroom Burger](https://youtu.be/B8PVw-TEs0c), [Panda Express Firecracker Shrimp](https://youtu.be/1gxlXqUJwXg), [Ikea Meatballs](https://youtu.be/xm3Xy3Ycnpc) and others.

Brioche Buns: 2\n2. Chicken Breast: 1 breast, weighing between 10 and 12 oz. If you have smaller ones, use two. If you're using thighs, use one for each, total 2.\n3. Pickles: 6 slices each, total 12.\n4. Oil, to fry the chicken\n\n**To marinade the chicken:**\n\n1. Buttermilk: 1.5 cups, full cream or full fat buttermilk\n2. ~~Sriracha~~  Old bay seasoning or any other cajun mix : 2 tsp  \n\\*made an error in transferring the recipe from video to text.

Old bay seasoning or any other cajun mix: 2 tsp\n4. Cayenne: 1 tsp \\*adjust this as per your heat level.\n\n**To dredge the chicken before frying**:\n\n1. AP flour: 3-4 oz\n2. Salt/Pepper/Paprika: to season the flour, about half tsp each OR a couple shakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Clean the breast and divide it into 2 equal portions. If it is too thick, whack it a bit with a rolling pin to even out the width so it cooks evenly later on.\n2. Mix all the marinade stuff in a bowl and whisk to combine. Add the chicken and rest in fridge for a minimum of 45 mins OR up to 3 hours.\n3. In the meantime, get the sauce ready by mixing all the ingredients and mixing to combine.\n4. Also, mix the dredging ingredients in a separate bowl.\n5. when the chicken has rested enough, remove from the fridge. Heat oil in pan. Let chicken come to room temp while the oil heats.\n6. when the oil is hot, between 350 and 360 F, take 2 tbsp of the chicken marinade and add to the dredging flour mixture. Mix with a fork.\n7. Now, take the chicken from the marinade and put in the bowl with the dredging flour. Coat with flour by pressing it down so its well coated. Lift the chicken and shake to remove extra flour.\n8. drop in hot oil. repeat step 7 for all pieces.\n9. Do Not overcrowd the pan when frying. Add only up to 4 pcs if frying in a deep and wide pan. Or else stick to batches of 2.\n10. Dont touch the chicken for a good 2-3 mins till it is lightly crispy on one side. Then, FLIP. Follow this step again for the other side. Once you have some color on both sides, now you have to flip it often to avoid burning.\n11. cook till internal temp is 165 f. OR until juices run 100% clear.\n12. Toast brioche buns with butter.\n13. To assemble: Smear on the sauce on both top and bottom bread. Add pickles to the bottom part. Add on the fried chicken and cover with the top bread part.\n14.

AP Flour - 14 oz or 400 gm\n2. Water, lukewarm: between 112-115F - 8.7oz or 246gm\n3. Sugar - 1 oz or 30 gm\n4. Active dry yeast - 1 packet or 7 gm\n5. Salt - 0.25 oz or 7gm\n6. Extra Virgin Olive Oil Part 1 - 1.5oz or 43gm\n7. Extra Virgin Olive Oil Part 2 - 2 tbsp or 29.5gm more to rub on the dough before it rises.\n\nTo brush the breadsticks with:\n\n1. Extra virgin olive oil plus grated parm - about 2 tbsp or 25gm\n2. Melted Butter plus garlic powder - about 2 tbsp or 25gm\n\nDirections:\n\n1. In  the bowl of a stand mixer, pour in lukewarm water, yeast, and \u00bd tsp  sugar. Mix gently and cover & let sit for 10 mins to activate the  yeast. Once bubbles have formed you are good to go.\n2. To  this, add in salt, remaining sugar, olive oil part 1, and1.5 cups of  flour, don\u2019t have to be exact here. Mix with a spatula to incorporate  the dry flour. You will end up with a wet flour mixture.\n3. Now,  attach the bowl to the stand mixer and using a dough hook start mixing  on low speed. Begin adding the remaining flour a little at a time.\n4. Gradually increase the speed after 2-3 mins intervals. Continue this until all of the flour is added in.\n5. After  this point, let it mix on medium speed for 2-3 mins to smoothen the  dough a bit. It\u2019s okay if you stop early, but don\u2019t overwork it.\n6. Remove the bowl from the machine and dig in with your hands to make sure no dry flour is in the bottom of the bowl.\n7. Rub  the dough with olive oil part 2. You want to rub all over the surface  but don\u2019t want to knead the dough. Just smother it on there with your  fingers.\n8. Cover  the bowl with plastic. Leave it to rest for \\~2hours. I suggest to let  it rest in an empty oven, with oven off & light on. This is the  perfect temperature for the dough to rise. It should double in size.\n9. When  it doubles in size, remove the plastic from the bowl and take out the  dough on a clean and lightly floured surface where you can work on it.\n10. Work  the dough a bit by tucking the corners into the middle. You want to end  up with a smooth ball. For visuals on this step, refer this [video](https://youtu.be/dXOY9AUrXSA)\n11. Divide  dough into 4 equal parts. Each part is further divided into 3 smaller  parts. Total 12 small parts. Each of these will be 1 breadstick.\n12. Make sticks by stretching the dough, without a lot of pressure.\n13. Place these on lined baking trays and leave to rest for another 1 hour. Same way as before: oven off & light on.\n14. When they have proofed for the second time, remove from oven. Turn on oven to preheat at 400 F.\n15. In the meanwhile, mix olive oil with parm and garlic powder with melted butter.\n16. Brush  the 6 of the 12 breads generously with oil-parm mixture and the other 6  with garlic butter. Optionally, you can also use dried herbs like  oregano at this stage.\n17. When  the oven is preheated, bake these at 400F till golden brown. Should  take between 12 \u2013 15 mins. Place them on the middle to lower racks.\n18. When they are done, optionally, you can smear more olive oil or butter.\n\nHappy eating! :))\n\nBonus: you can make the dough, portion it, and freeze it. Thaw overnight in the fridge and bake as normal.\n\nThanks for reading. Hope you enjoy the recipe. :) Would love to hear back if you try it.", "OH, \"OG\" = \"Olive Garden\"\n\nI was sitting here trying to figure out what Ice T had to do with bread sticks.", "What recipe?", "This a pretty base standard bread recipe, I really really doubt it is the actual OG recipe.

As for the sauce, you can probably just use any old jarred pizza sauce, although it probably won't taste quite like domino's sauce. If you make it yourself, you might be able to get a closer approximation, but I've never made homemade pizza sauce before, so I'm far from being an expert there. The sausage is just a classic sliced italian sausage. It then just goes through the pizza oven just like a pizza. And I think that's everything! Other than the bread, which another commenter has talked about here. I wasn't aware that the bread wasn't fully cooked, it certainly looked fully cooked to me, it's not like it was doughy or anything. But it *was* certainly very pale bread before going through the oven, so maybe that's what they mean?

So here are my notes if you really want to go crazy with this. Many people will point you to the internet-famous McMenu PDF (here: [https://archive.org/details/mcmenu](https://archive.org/details/mcmenu) ) and it does have some good tips, but a lot of this didn't quite pan out for me, so I did my own digging.\n\nFirst thing - recreating a McDonald's product is like hitting a moving target. They constantly reformulate their products and methods based on market price forecasts, ingredient availability, scale, etc. So you'll never get it \"perfect.\" And some of this info is dated, but better than nothing to start with.\n\nI never found a way to recreate the buns, but those have changed recently. They are custom baked by Northeast Foods in New Jersey specifically for McD's, so your guess is as good as mine here.\n\nAs for the meat, according to some videos available on YouTube ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVA57Z7yxj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVA57Z7yxj8) ), it's a custom blend of chuck, ground round and sirloin that is ground very fine (think paste), combined with the same mixture that has already been frozen. It is then extruded, frozen, sliced into patties. If you've ever wondered what those tiny slimy droplets are on a plain patty before, that's actually protein slurry that has been squeezed out during the cooking process due to how compressed the meat is.\n\nA standard patty is referred to as 10:1, meaning it's pre-cooked weight is 1/10 of a pound. That's used on hamburgers, cheeseburgers, Big Macs, etc. A 4:1 is your quarter pound patty. 3:1 is occasionally used for specialty items.\n\nAs for fat ratio (an important part of the flavor), the website gives a plain burger's fat content at 9g; given that a 10:1 burger is (roughly) 45g, that equates to around 20% (so a normal 80/20 blend, they may add tallow given some of the leaner cuts involved or just lean heavily on the chuck).\n\nBurgers are cooked in a special grill press ( at least one example documented here, no idea what they use at present: [http://web.archive.org/web/20220119165032/https://clamshell.garland-group.com/Literature.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20220119165032/https://clamshell.garland-group.com/Literature.asp) ), 425\u00b0 for the top, 365\u00b0 for the bottom, 40 seconds. Patties are placed on the grill and seasoned with a salt/pepper mixture (86% fine salt, 14% black pepper) before cooking, then place in warming tray at 175\u00b0 for no longer than 15 minutes (purportedly - I'm pretty sure I've had a hockey puck or two late at night that might have had a birthday or two).\n\nFrom there, you top it as you like (cheese or no cheese - again, a custom product made exclusively for them by a company called Fonterra). They use condiment guns that precisely measure the amount of each that goes on a burger. From an old 1980's manager's pocket guide, I found the following quantities:\n\nMustard= 1/8 teaspoon (0.7ml)\n\n10:1 ketchup = 1/3 ounce (10ml)\n\n4:1 ketchup = 1/2 ounce (15ml)\n\nMac sauce = 1/3 ounce (10ml)\n\nTartar sauce = 2/3 ounce (30ml)\n\nMayo = 1/2 ounce (20ml)\n\nPickles are extra-sour, non-kosher dills, sliced extremely thin. I once got close with these by buying whole pickles (Vlassic, I think?) slicing them on a mandolin and adding them back to the brine with a small amount of additional citric acid. YMMV, but I also hate the pickles, this was more of just a whim.\n\nOnions are indeed dehydrated chopped white onion (there are pictures/videos of this all over the internet), rehydrated in cold water and then drained before either being placed on the finished burger (1990's-early 2024) or on the flattop to cook with the burger (recent change).\n\nWrapping the sandwiches and letting them steam also helps meld the flavors a little, as someone else mentioned. This used to be part of the overall process (pre-assembled sandwiches sitting under a heat lamp), but somewhere along the line they moved to a more JIT process (especially when they're busy).\n\nAll in all, you won't match the economics of scale that McDonald's utilizes, so unless you're making hundreds of sandwiches, it's still cheaper by far to just go pick some up. Pointless? Sure. Interesting? I thought so. But if the apocalypse ever arrives, you can use the above to set up the first burger stand in the wasteland, I guess.", "Diced, dried onions that are reconstituted in water, then drained. Commodity pickles - go for store brand or Mt Olive pickle chips. Commodity white buns. I'm guessing 20% fat beef, about 2-3 oz for the pre-cooked patty weight. Cook it hard, seasoned with salt and pepper only. Commodity American cheese slice. Top with yellow mustard and ketchup, though McD's has their own ketchup that you probably won't find the exact thing in stores (maybe swipe a few packets the next time you're there?). Then, once it's done - and here's the important part - wrap the completed burger in wax paper and let it sit for a few minutes. That'll steam it a bit and get all the flavors to mingle together.", "PDF of McDonald\u2019s recipes: [McMenu](https://www.reddit.com/r/MimicRecipes/s/6NHkgZlS0Q)", "Ketchup, mustard, diced white onion, dill pickle chips, and a slice of American cheese.

{"title": "An Obsessive-Compulsive's Guide to Chipotle's Chicken.", "selftext": "I've spent the past few weeks doing some trial & error in reverse engineering Chipotle's chicken recipe. I worked at a Chipotle for a few months, so I have some first-hand knowledge about the ingredients used and different processes involved in this chicken recipe. I've reviewed *dozens* of online \"copycat\" recipes, and every single one misses the mark in some way. Let's go... \n\nFirst, I'm going to list all of the ingredients and amounts, and then the steps. And if you're so inclined, I'm going to go into great detail afterwards about each decision I made here. \n\n***Note:*** Please do not turn this into a debate about your opinion of Chipotle or their food, that's not what this post is about. I am simply sharing a recipe for those who enjoy their chicken. \n\n###INGREDIENTS \n\n####Serves: 2 (scale up as needed)\n\n* 1 pound | 454g boneless/skinless chicken thighs\n\n#####Adobo marinade:\n\n* \u00bd ounce | 14g dried morita chipotle chiles\n\n* \u00bd cup | 118ml boiling water\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml Better Than Bouillon Roasted Chicken Base (reduced sodium)\n\n* 1 crushed garlic clove\n\n* 1 tablespoon | 15ml distilled white vinegar\n\n* 2 tablespoons | 30ml neutral oil\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml ground cumin\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml Mexican oregano, crushed in the palm of your hand\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml ground black pepper\n\n* 2 teaspoons | 6g Diamond Crystal kosher salt **or** 1 teaspoon | 6g fine table salt\n\n###INSTRUCTIONS \n\n1. Toast the dried chipotle chiles in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant and skins begins to bubble, flipping frequently to avoid burning. This should take about 5 minutes. Transfer chiles to cutting board and let them cool off until you can handle them. Remove the seeds from at least one chile. More if you want it less spicy. Remove any thick stems from the chiles. \n\n2. Meanwhile, mix boiling water and Better Than Bouillon in heat-proof container, set aside. \n\n3. Add the all chiles to bouillon and allow to soften for at least 5 minutes while you prep the rest of the ingredients. \n\n4. Add the chiles, bouillon, and all remaining adobo ingredients to a high powered blender or food processor and blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down sides as needed. \n\n5. [Edit: The marinade will likely be hot at this point, and it should be cooled before adding it to the chicken!] Add chicken to a bowl and pour adobo over chicken, then using gloves, mix thoroughly to combine, ensuring chicken is completely covered in adobo. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, ideally 24 hours. \n\n6. Preheat 2 tablespoons of a high smoke point oil in a stainless steel, carbon steel, or cast iron pan over medium high heat, until oil just begins to smoke. Make sure to turn on the vent/range hood and open some windows, this will create a \"pepper spray\" effect. Working with one piece of chicken at a time, remove from marinade, let any excess marinade drip back into bowl, and carefully lay flat-die down into hot oil. It is okay to crowd the pan, but you may have to work in batches depending on how much chicken you are cooking and how big your pan is. Cook over medium-high heat until the first side is well-charred (spotty black, but not fully black), 5-10 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is well-charred, 5-10 minutes. You want to err on the side of overcooking here. \n\n7. Once chicken is fully cooked and both sides are well-charred, transfer to a clean bowl and allow to rest for just 5 minutes. Once rested, move to cutting board, cut length-wise into 1/2-3/4\" strips, then align strips and cut perpendicular into 1/2-3/4\" cubes. Move all cubes and any juices back into bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to sit for at least 15 minutes. This step is crucial. Before serving, mix everything up to coat the chicken in all of the juices.  \n\n---\n\nSo now for the \"*why*\".\n\n######Adobo \n\nChipotle gets their adobo marinade in a bag. It comes to the store pre-made, so nobody really knows what's all in it, besides what's listed on their website, which I used as a reference for this. You can find the same ingredient list on their website if you google \"chipotle ingredients\" (I'm purposefully avoiding any hyperlinks in this post). \n\n######Chicken\n\nChipotle uses boneless/skinless chicken *quarters*.  These are legs and thighs still attached. If you can find these, great, use those. If not, use boneless/skinless thighs.\n\n\n######Chipotle Chiles\n\nMake sure you use the \"morita\" variety and not the \"meco\". The morita are dark purple, smaller, less smoky, and softer. The meco are light tan, larger, more smoky, and more stiff. There are several good places to buy Chipotle Morita online. If you can only find meco, it will still taste great, but not the same. Leaving all of the seeds intact does make it spicier than what's served at Chipotle, so that's why I'm suggesting to remove the seeds from at least one chile (scale this up as well, if you scale up everything else). You can adjust the spiciness as needed by removing more or less seeds and any large ribs. \n\nIt's my belief that Chipotle *does not* use anything similar to \"canned chipotles in adobo\", but instead makes their own basic adobo from dried chipotles. I've tried both methods, and starting with canned chipotles in adobo does taste different than actual chipotle. It's still very good, but just not the same. If that is all you can find, then you can use 2 tablespoons minced per pound of chicken, room-temp water, and skip step 1 and 2. \n\n######Bouillon\n\nThe Better Than Bouillon is certainly not used by Chipotle, but I will explain why I included it here. For starters, I think it's a safe assumption that *if* chipotle is using chicken stock in their adobo, then they have included that in their ingredient list by just including \"chicken\" and \"water\" as ingredients. Technically, the Better Than Bouillon contains other ingredients that are not listed on their website, but it's not anything drastic. Also, I know that many of you on this sub use Better Than Bouillon anyway, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal to include it. Worst case, just omit it and use straight water, but maybe bump the salt up very slightly if you do. I've never tested this without using the bouillon. If you have a basic homemade or boxed chicken stock, then by all means, use that instead. \n\n######Oil\n\nWhen I say \"neutral\" oil, I mean something that is refined and light in color, like vegetable oil. Chipotle lists sunflower oil, but I don't think that's worth a special purchase. I have not tested that though. \n\n######Oregano\n\nI think Mexican oregano is key here. I have tested it with standard Greek oregano, and it is very different. When I say to \"crush in the palm of your hand\", that should be pretty self-explanatory. The goal is to break up the large pieces first, and the smell should immediately hit you when you do this. If it doesn't, your oregano is old and should be replaced. \n\n######Salt\n\nThe salt amount seems quite high, and it is, but a lot of that salt will be left behind in the blender and bowl. Chipotle uses Morton kosher salt, so if you do that, you should reduce the amount by 25%, or 1.5 teaspoons or 6g per pound of chicken. You must use the exact type of salt here if you're going to use volume measurements.\n\n######Marinating\n\nI will often only marinade for about 2 hours, and it's good. Chipotle will do all of their marinades the previous day, for up to 24 hours, so this is ideal. \n\n######Cooking\n\nChipotle uses a large flat-top griddle. I have a Blackstone 36\" griddle that I use outside, which is ideal, but obviously not practical or possible for many people. I greatly prefer cooking this over charcoal, which is completely different, but highly recommended. \n\n######Resting\n\nAfter cutting the chicken into pieces, Chipotle covers the pan with plastic wrap and puts it into a warming cabinet that is set to 165F, where it will sit for *hours*, sometimes. You do not need to go to this extreme, but wrapping the bowl with the hot chicken and letting it sit for at least 15 minutes is absolutely critical here. Not doing this will produce a completely different texture. \n\n---\n\nThat's it. I think it's pretty damn close, and I think you will too.

New one has slightly lower calories and carbs, slightly more protein, and way more sodium.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/7q4gs2/fruit_smoothie_ingredients_list/ - the ingredients list for the new version. For the base, the pear and apple puree probably add a little of their flavors, but like most things that contain them, they're there to up the sugar content without actually adding sugar. It's one of the games they play with processed food. They're also probably responsible for the fiber difference. Pineapple juice could also just be a sweetener, but they put it in the fruit too so I'm guessing there's some flavor there too. The fruit is...fruit. Ascorbic acid, citric acid, and sodium citrate make it tart and act as a bit of a preservative. (The latter is what they use to emulsify American cheese; I've never seen it used like this.) And finally, some natural coloring from the carrot and currant juices. No dairy!\n\nIf you wanted to duplicate it, I'd start with frozen strawberries, blackberries, and pineapple. The pineapple taste isn't prominent, so I'd do like 80% berries and 20% pineapple as a start. The older one was sweeter and I don't remember them mentioning it was sugar-free, so I'd just use sugar to sweeten it. Use ice and water in a blender to get the correct consistency.

However, I can provide you with a basic recipe inspired by the Cheesecake Factory's Pasta da Vinci. While it may not be an exact match, it captures the essence of a creamy, flavorful pasta dish. Feel free to adjust the ingredients to your taste!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 8 oz penne or your favorite pasta\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 lb chicken breast, thinly sliced\n* Salt and black pepper to taste\n* 1 cup sliced mushrooms\n* 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, sliced\n* 1 cup baby spinach\n* 1 teaspoon minced garlic\n* 1 cup chicken broth\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n* Red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)\n* Grated Parmesan for serving\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.\n2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and black pepper and cook until browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n3. In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed. Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms until they release their moisture and become golden brown.\n4. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and minced garlic, cooking for about a minute until fragrant.\n5. Pour in the chicken broth, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze and pick up the flavorful bits. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes.\n6. Lower the heat and stir in the heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, spinach, basil, and parsley. Cook until the spinach wilts and the sauce thickens slightly.\n7. Add the cooked chicken and cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing to coat everything evenly. Adjust the seasoning to taste. If you like a bit of heat, sprinkle red pepper flakes.\n8. Serve hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs.\n\nWhile this may not be an exact replica, I hope it captures the essence of the Cheesecake Factory's Pasta da Vinci. Enjoy your delicious homemade version!", "I just want the sauce in a can to purchase, any recs?"]}

{"title": "Disney World\u2019s The Ganachery - Hot Chocolate", "selftext": "Hey guys! So I\u2019ve been trying to solve this for a while now. To everyone that\u2019s been to The Ganachery in Disney Springs, they may have tried their Hot Ganache drinking chocolate. To everyone that hasn\u2019t tried it, it\u2019s a delicious hot chocolate made from ganache. \n\nNow I\u2019ve tried hot chocolates from a lot of places, from England, to Italy, to Spain, and nowhere has even come close to this drink. It\u2019s rich, smooth, thick, and perfect. \n\nThe problem is the fact that I only come to Disney world once a year. And coming from a cold country, I\u2019d love to be able to make it at home. However I have searched all over the internet, emailed them directly, and they are still yet to respond with a recipe. So I had to physically go into the shop and ask the people at the counter. It was a man and a woman, one of them being a manager/supervisor. And being Disney, they not surprisingly told me it was secret and couldn\u2019t tell me... Fair enough. So I thought my quest to find this recipe was over.\n\nHowever... A few days later, being a lover of the drink, I went into the shop again to buy another. This time, I saw the member of staff who I saw last time, all alone without any other colleague or supervisor, and they recognised me...\n\nA big thank you to that member of staff who gave me this list of ingredients...\n\nHeavy Cream - 80oz\n\n2% milk - 20oz\n\nMilk Chocolate - 24oz\n\nDark Chocolate - 24oz\n\nCaramel - 16oz\n\n(They also mentioned Sea Salt but didn\u2019t write it down)\n\nNow this is a massive step in the right direction. I now have a list of ingredients in order to make this drink at home. However, I don\u2019t have the recipe itself. \n\nI bought the ingredients, mixed them together a million different ways, and tried it. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, it was delicious (I mean who doesn\u2019t love hot chocolate), but it wasn\u2019t the same. \n\nSo here\u2019s where I turn to Reddit: Is there anyone, who has any information on how to make this amazing drink?

Grate or chop up milk and dark chocolate and add to a large bowl. I looked up what kind of chocolate Disney uses and they go with Scharffen Berger. I\u2019m sure any high quality chocolate would work well.\n2. Combine milk and heavy cream in a sauce pan over medium heat and bring to a simmer.\n3. Remove milk/cream from heat and immediately pour it over the chocolate. Stir until glossy and smooth.\n4. Return mixture back to saucepan, stirring until completely combined. \n5. Add in your caramel and sea salt and stir until combined. Let simmer for 3-5 minutes. \n\nIf it\u2019s the hot ganache recipe where you have the option to add some bailey\u2019s, it comes with vanilla bean whipped cream on top. You might want to add a little vanilla extract into the last step if that\u2019s the case (1/8 or 1/4 tsp is what I would try out). I might also swap out the caramel for sweetened condensed milk for easier stirring (14oz can would probably work great).", "The disney food blog lists a lot more ingredients;\n\n\u201cThe new beverage, which debuted just yesterday, features a blend of caramel, milk, and dark chocolate ganache, along with bourbon, maple reduction, pecans, AND chocolate-covered bacon.

I find vanilla, nutmeg, pepper, and coffee are frequently overlooked in chocolate based recipes. Vanilla adds sweetness, nutmeg adds a little savory, chipotle pepper adds a little smoke and spice, paprika adds a little smokey flavor (go very easy on pepper/paprika, like half a pinch or less to start), and coffee amps up the chocolate flavor without making it taste like coffee.\n\nLooking at the promotional photos, the ganache coins around the hot chocolate look like they\u2019re shaped like coffee beans, so that might be your answer. \n\nTry gently heating the cream/milk in a saucepan and adding the other ingredients while whisking. The whisking helps a lot with the flavor as it adds some froth and creaminess to the milk. I don\u2019t personally drink coffee, so I couldn\u2019t tell you the exact ratio. I\u2019ve also seen people make ganache hot chocolate in a slow cooker to avoid accidentally overheating it. \n\nDrinking chocolate generally isn\u2019t as sweet as chocolate candy/chips are, so maybe try some dark cocoa powder?

Both perfect for Fall. :)", "selftext": "**Recreating Starbucks Recipes \u2013 Chai Latte and Salted Caramel Mocha**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/gallery/o4XTFn7) OR a [4-min video](https://youtu.be/0LNWr4VJ3u0).\n\nWell, who doesn't like a good cup of hot drink, yeah? But ever since I started working from home, I haven't wanted to go out in the mornings just to get my chai latte from the Starbucks 2 blocks down. After a couple trials, I recreated 2 of my favorite hot drinks from the Starbucks menu -Chai Latte and Salted Caramel Mocha. Save yourself a few good bucks when you make these at home! :)\n\nI spent zero dollars on this recipe since I had everything in my pantry \u2013 they are mostly panty essentials, and even if you end up buying something, say a can of whipped cream, you could always use it for something else \u2013 still MUCH cheaper than starbucks drinks but the same exact taste! Happy drinking. :)\n*********************\nEdit - Fancy Coffee Math:\n\nSalted caramel mocha, size TALL (12 OZ) is $4.25 at Starbucks, tax not included. With 12% tax it is $4.75\n\nIf you buy all the ingredients, these are organic prices, all from Amazon, so grocery stores will probably be cheaper, but still for argument sakes let's do organic -\nWhole milk 32oz is 2.29\nCane sugar 32oz is 2.99\nCoffee Starbucks Breakfast blend is 7.99\nHersheys cocoa powder 8oz is 2.98\nMcCormick Vanilla extract 3oz is 5.49\nTotal is $21.75\n\nNow, 21.75\u00f74.75 will give you about 4.5 drinks. Since you can't buy half a drink that would be 4 drinks. Meaning if you have $21.75 in your hands, you can either buy 4 drinks at Starbucks OR all of these ingredients. \n\nBut I wanna assume you went out to buy all these ingredients just for this recipe and never used it for anything else, with 32 oz of milk as your base, you'll get 72 oz of drink since you also add coffee and water to the recipe. That itself is 6 drinks, that's assuming each time you drink 12oz of coffee which is same as TALL Starbucks size. \nAnd that's costing it for organic, expensive, Prime Now costed ingredients.\n**********************\n\n**Ingredients for 1 serving of each drink:** \n\n**1\\] Chai Latte:** \n\n1. Milk, whole: half cup or 4 fl. Oz\n\n2. Water: half cup or 4 fl. oz \n\n3. Cinnamon stick: half stick or 2 inches \n\n4. Cloves: 2 pcs \n\n5. Cardamom: 3 pcs \n\n6. Minced ginger: 1 tsp. \n\n7. Sugar: 1 tbsp \n\n8. Loose tea leaves, black tea: 2 tbsp OR use 2 teabags \n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. In a pot, heat the water with the whole spices and minced ginger.\n\n2. When it comes to a rolling boil, keep the heat to medium and then add in the tea leaves and sugar. Simmer this until the liquid is half the quantity you started with.\n\n3. Strain and set aside. Use the same cup that you want for the final assembly.\n\n4. Bring the milk to a boil in a clean pot. Remove from heat and create some froth using an immersion blender. You can keep the froth as much or as less you want. \n\n5. To assemble: pour the milk with the froth on top of the chai concentrate and garnish with cinnamon powder.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**2\\] Salted Caramel Mocha:** \n\n1. Espresso Shots: 2 OR half cup coffee\n\n2. Milk, whole: half cup of 4 fl. Oz\n\n3. Cocoa Powder: 1 tsp\n\n4. Sugar: 1 tbsp\n\n5. Salted caramel sauce: 1.5 tbsp & half tsp for garnish \n\n6. Vanilla extract: 1 tsp\n\n7. Whipped cream: for garnish\n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. In a pot, add the 2 shots of coffee with 1 shot of water. Add sugar and cocoa powder and stir on low heat. \n\n2. When the sugar dissolves, add salted caramel sauce. \\[Salted caramel sauce is the same as caramel sauce, with a pinch of sea salt added when you put the cream and whisk it.\\]\n\n3. When the caramel dissolves, add milk and vanilla extract and bring it to a boil.\n\n4. To assemble: pour into a cup, add whipped cream on top with more salted caramel sauce.\n\nIf you liked the recipes, please consider [checking out my channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/honestcooks), if not, no biggie.

Take your pick.\n\nThe recipe is below, but reddit kind of mangles the formatting, \nso an [**easier to read version is here**](https://www.bupkis.org/index.php/recipes-2/soups-2/italian-sausage-potato-and-kale-soup-olive-garden-zuppa-toscana).\n\n__________________________________________\n\nI really like Olive Garden\u2019s Zuppa Toscana, however I find it a little too salty, with not enough sausage or potato, and I didn\u2019t really like the big chunk of Kale with the rib still attached sitting in the bowl, looking like garnish that fell off somebody\u2019s lunch plate. So, I decided to make it better. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nThe half and half gives it a light creamy taste, while still letting the sausage shine though. The red pepper gives it a nice bite, and the kale gives it a light touch of brightness and bitterness to balance the sausage and dairy.\n\nAlthough from the ingredients list it looks like a rich soup, it\u2019s actually quite light, since there are 10 cups of stock & water, and only one cup of half and half, and nearly all the grease is drained from the sausage after cooking\n\nIngredients:\n\n2\tPounds\tLow-starch potatoes, washed, eyes removed and sliced into 1/4 inch disks. Peeling is optional.\n\n2\tPounds\tHot and/or Sweet Italian Sausage Links\n\n1\tLarge Bunch\tKale (it looks like a lot but will cook down)\n\n1\tLarge\tYellow Onion, diced small\n\n2\tT\tGarlic, mashed. Approx 8 cloves (see instructions)\n\n8\tOunces\tHalf and Half\n\n4\tCups\tReduced Sodium Chicken Stock\n\n6\tCups\tWater\n\n1/2\tTeaspoon\tGround Red Pepper (to taste)\n\n3/4\tTeaspoon\tKosher Salt (to taste)\n\n_________________\n\n**A quick potato primer:**\n\nPotatoes come in three basic styles, \u201chigh starch,\u201d \u201cmedium starch,\u201d and \u201clow starch.\u201d\n\nBaking Potatoes, Russet, White & General Purpose are all high starch and great for baking, mashing and frying. But not for this soup. They\u2019ll make it feel \u201cgrainy\u201d when reheated.\n\n\u201cAll Purpose\u201d potatoes are somewhere in the middle and like \u201cOne Size Fits All\u201d clothing, aren\u2019t really the best choice for any purpose.\n\nBoiling Potatoes, Round White or Red Potatoes are low starch and will cook beautifully in soup. They\u2019ll keep their shape and texture, even when reheated and not turn the soup into a grainy mess.\n_____________________\n\nNote: I\u2019m always disappointed when a pot of soup runs out the interesting stuff before the broth is gone, so this recipe includes quite a bit of sausage and potato and kale as well as additional spice and seasoning to handle the extra ingredients.\n\nIf made as shown above, you\u2019ll get a pot full of soup with \u201cgood stuff\u201d all the way from the top to the bottom.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for something lighter, feel free to reduce the potato, sausage, garlic, salt and ground red pepper by one-half, which will give you something closer to the proportions that OG uses.\n\nKale tends to have dirt, sand, etc. stuck in it, so it needs a good washing. It also will leak \u201cgreen\u201d into your soup making it look nasty. A quick blanch in boiling water will both clean the kale and prevent it from turning your soup green. The recipe below includes this step.\n\n**Directions:**\n\nFill a large pot with water, bring it to a rolling boil and add some salt \u2013 about the same amount of salt as if you were making pasta. \n\nFill a large bowl with cold water and some ice. Put a large colander in the sink.\n\nCut the base off the head of kale and roughly tear the leaves into 2\u2033 pieces, discarding the hard portion of the rib, and place in the colander for later. Olive Garden leaves the rib in, but I think it\u2019s too big and hard to put on a soup spoon.\n\nPlace the garlic in a mortar and pestle with a heavy pinch of kosher salt and mash until liquid, or finely mince, then grind with the back edge of a knife. You need at least two heaping Tablespoons of mashed garlic when you\u2019re done.\n\n\nCut the raw sausage into 1/2 inch chunks with shears or a knife. Add a little oil to the bottom of a large pot. Add the sausage. \n\nSaut\u00e9 on medium until fully cooked and you have developed a good deal of fond (brown stuff) on the bottom of the pot.\n\n\nPour off grease as necessary and build as much fond as possible without burning or drying out the sausage.\n\n\nRemove the sausage and save. Pour off the excess fat, leaving just enough to coat the bottom of the pot.\n\n\nDrop all the kale into the boiling salted water. Wait a few seconds until the kale turns bright green, then immediately dump the boiling water and kale into the colander in the sink. Then dump the hot, drained kale into the bowl of ice water and swish it around. \n\nDump the chilled kale into the colander to drain.\n\nAdd the finely diced onions and saut\u00e9 on medium until soft, nicely browned, and more fond develops.\n\nAdd the garlic and continue stirring until just fragrant and soft (probably about a minute). Be careful to not to burn or brown the \ngarlic. Add the ground red pepper and mix.\n\nAdd a small amount of water and deglaze the bottom of the pot (scrape up all the yummy brown bits).\n\nAdd the rest of the water, the chicken stock, the potatoes and sausage.\n\nBring to a slow simmer and continue simmering until the potatoes are soft.\n\nAdd the kale then turn off the heat.\n\nImmediately before serving, add the half and half, and serve with some nice home-baked Ciabatta bread.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/lc5acy/olive_gardens_zuppa_toscana_as_it_looks_in_the/", "created_utc": 1612405974.0, "score": 252, "author": "None", "num_comments": 19, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/lc5acy/olive_gardens_zuppa_toscana_as_it_looks_in_the/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I\u2019m saving this for sure.

Then just adjust the ratios until you get the consistency you want.\n\nEDIT: For what it\u2019s worth, [there was a thread about it on r/spicy a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/spicy/comments/ailnb0/does_anyone_remember_the_fiery_buffalo_sauce_at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), and someone suggested that the Buffalo Burnin\u2019 Hot sauce from Pizza Hut  might be similar?

KFC absolutely does not use ANY \"fresh\" ingredients and the method we use(d) was stupid close to what they handed you in the drive thru.", "KFC used to have this spicy \u201cZinger sauce\u201d that was quite quite delicious. \n\nWish I could find the recipe ):", "Used to work at a KFC way back in the day as a teenager.

You can get [musubi molds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FHSBPDP) on Amazon.

Recipes are potentially protectable as \u201cliterary works\u201d within the contours of the current U.S. Copyright Act. In this sense, copyright protection for recipes could cover the literary creativity involved in choosing how to describe the ingredients and steps for producing dishes. It would not, however, protect the creative components of the dish as such (for example, the clever techniques and combinations involved in molecular gastronomy).\n>> \n>> Recipes may be copyrighted if they represent original and at least minimally creative literary expression by their authors. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Feist explained that this is a very low threshold and that most works will evince the modest creative spark necessary for protection.1 Despite the incredibly low creativity bar imposed by copyright law, courts and scholars have been skeptical that many recipes can clear these hurdles. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, for example, that a plaintiff\u2019s recipes for yogurt-based dishes \u201ccontain[ed] no expressive elaboration\u201d on the list of necessary ingredients or the steps for combining them. The court contrasted these recipes with ones that \u201cspice up functional directives by weaving in creative narrative.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a lawyer, but my understanding, which this article appears to agree with, is that a recipe is only subject to copyright protection to the extent that the specific expression of how to prepare a dish is protected, as any written text would be. But the recipe _itself_ isn\u2019t protected, and if someone were to \u201creverse engineer\u201d how to make a dish, and write up their own description of how to make it, then that would be legally allowed, as long as that description isn\u2019t just a copy/paste of the original version of the recipe. \n\n(This is social media, seek guidance from an actual attorney if you want a real answer, etc.)", "Damn.

And finally, a couple drops of liquid smoke. You may need to adjust the sourness; citric acid should be available in your grocery store's canning supplies, and you wouldn't need more than 1/4 teaspoon.

Meanwhile, whisk the bread flour, remaining one tablespoon of granulated sugar, and salt in a stand mixer.\n\n\n\nAdd the yeast mixture and melted butter to the flour mixture. Knead with the dough hook on medium speed until it is smooth and elastic, about eight minutes. Transfer to a bowl coated with cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about one and a half hours.\n\n\n\nLightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Punch down the dough and transfer to a work surface; knead a few times. Cut in half and gently shape into two three-by-six-inch loaves (do not overwork the dough). Place the loaves three inches apart on the prepared pan. Lightly spray the loaves with cooking spray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until puffy, 30 minutes to one hour.\n\n\n\nMake the topping: Whisk the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small baking dish. Whisk the melted butter and corn syrup in another small baking dish.\n\n\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two nine-by-five-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a two-inch overhang on all sides. Cut four deep slashes across the top of each loaf (the loaves will look deflated). Dip each loaf in the butter-corn syrup mixture, turning to cover, then coat with the cinnamon sugar, making sure to get the sugar in the crevices. Place the loaves in the prepared pans. Drizzle with any remaining butter mixture and sprinkle with any remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake until light brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Lift the bread out of the loaf pans using the parchment overhang and transfer to a rack. Let cool in the paper, about 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners' sugar, salt, melted butter, and three tablespoons of milk in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in up to two more tablespoons of milk as needed to loosen. Drizzle on the warm loaves or serve on the side for dipping.\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S KATSU CURRY - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_DgczQFxbB/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_DgczQFxbB/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S FIRECRACKER SHRIMP - [https://www.instagram.com/p/B\\_sxgtNhFIL/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sxgtNhFIL/)\n\n\n\nWAGAMAMA\u2019S CHILI CHICKEN RAMEN - [https://www.wagamama.us/recipes](https://www.wagamama.us/recipes)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S MONTE CARLO BISCUITS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release)\n\n\n\nARNOTT\u2019S SCOTCH FINGERS - [https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger](https://www.arnotts.com/articles/thevault/big-recipe-release-scotch-finger)\n\n\n\n**Arnott's Scotch Finger**\n\n* **Prep time: 10 mins** \n* **Cook time: 25 mins** \n* **Makes: 16 biscuits** \n\n\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* **170g salted butter, softened** \n* **\u2154 cup (90g) soft icing sugar** \n* **1 cup (165g) plain flour** \n* **1\u00bd tsp baking powder** \n\n\n\n**Method**\n\nStep 1\n\nPreheat oven to 160\u00b0C.

The cocoa powder is interesting. \"[Glucono-delta-lactone](https://foodadditives.net/acidulents/glucono-delta-lactone/)\" has a few uses, but it's probably used here for pickling the jalapenos. \"[Disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate](https://foodadditives.net/flavor-enhancer/disodium-inosinate/)\" serve a very similar role to MSG: they add umami.

{"title": "Burger King -- Smell and taste of BK Beef (2)", "selftext": "I am reviving a discussion that was closed for some reason, posted about 7 months ago. As the title suggest, it was an inquiry into that charred smell and taste of the BK Beef. I have been doing some research into this, so thought I would revive the topic.\n\nThese are a few of the well-known theories people have surmised that create that unique char-taste of the Whopper;\n\n1.\tThe fat that drips and creates that char-flame imparts the taste upon the meat.\n2.\tThe meat has charred marks on one side, because it travels along hot chains across the flames, landing into a warmer bin. It is well known, even by employees, that these chains build up black char and are not cleaned that often. Many believe the chains themselves impart the special flavor.\n3.\tThe meat itself is a different grade of meat that you would not get in fine dining or grocery stores. \n4.\tSomething is added to the meat.\n\nThe processing of the meat is kind of a secret across all the fast food chains. Some of them use fillers in their meats, some use high pressure, some use soy beans, low grade meats, etc. When it comes to the Whopper, I think the answer lies in looking at its history. \n\nIn 1956 a company was started called Red Arrow Products. They created additives, liquid smoke, that was made from burning saw dust, its essence captured and bottled into water. In 1957, Burger King was looking for something that would make its Whopper stand out. How do we know BK uses Red Arrow Products? An article by Eric Schlosser for the Rolling Stones which turned into a book, \u201cFast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All American Meal (2001)\u201d which uncovered these \u201ctop secret\u201d ingredients that remained hidden under the 100% Beef labeling and their history. Here is what he said;\n\n\u201cBurger King's BK Broiler Chicken Breast Patty contains \"natural smoke  flavor.\" A firm called Red Arrow Products Company specializes in smoke flavor, which is added to barbecue sauces and processed meats. Red Arrow manufactures natural smoke flavor by charring sawdust and capturing the aroma chemicals released into the air. The smoke is captured in water and then bottled, so that other companies can sell food which seems to have been cooked over a fire.\u201d\n\nI find it also odd that the new BK Impossible Whopper, a plant based burger, has the same char taste as its animal-based brother . Although the Impossible version is cooked over the same chains as its counterpart, and charred meat fat flames, I am leaning towards the fact it is not any of those , nor is it a hickory or mesquite liquid smoke that imparts its specialness as many have tried using, but charred saw-dust water.

In fact, McDonald\u2019s adds a secret ingredient to their meat that is literally called \u201c100% real beef\u201d so that they can market their patties as 100% real beef. Even though their are other additives to the meat. \nBurger King uses natural gas in their grills. The flames sear the meat from the beginning to the end of the roller. \nWhat a burger uses the same meat but it is placed thawed out on a hot griddle, sprinkled with a blend of very fine salt, very fine pepper, scored three times with the metal spatula one way, 3 times diagonal the other way. Flipped once and cheese added if ordered. Even at home, I cannot duplicate any of these flavors no matter what I try or use.", "People ask about the Mayo all the time here as well, I think the thing that separates it is the fact that it sits outside for awhile before you it, not the burger, the meat. Yes it\u2019s in a cooler but it\u2019s partially defrosted and cooked in 2:45 so that\u2019s what unique", "I also live next to a BK and was about to go get some, but after reading this thread and searching some more, I decided to give my burger another shot. I didn't want to use any liquid smoke or anything and found this from Serious Eats: \"The trick is to\u00a0**cook the patty almost all the way through on a single side only**\u00a0(either a charcoal or gas grill on the highest heat setting will do). That way you invest most of your time in really deeply browning that side and developing its flavor.\"\n\nI don't have a grill, just used a stainless steel pan. Smashed the patty down thinner than I usually do, (not sure of the measurement), 3 pinches of pink salt and let it sit there longer than I usually do to develop the char/browning, this is the key. then flip it and press down again. These were fucking amazing and better than BK. Had a double with american cheese, ketchup, mustard and mt. olive pickles. So good i made another double with cheddar, mayo, ketchup, mustard and pickles. Equally great. \ud83c\udf54 \ud83c\udf54", "I will never eat BK, McD's and a few others again....especially BK:  When I was a kid in the 80's, BK was great and seemed to produce fine grilled burgers over a conveyor belt grill.  Now, I doubt the \"taste\" is derived naturally form the grilled process.  I have a personal experience;  On a lay-over in Las Vegas, the airpot section had a BK and I got one (the first one in like 7 years fyi) and initially it tasted fine, classic.  BUT after 5 bites, I was getting a sick feeling from the \"char taste\" and dissected the burger.  It DID NOT LOOK GRILLED.  It looked FAKE and with fake grill lines on only 1 side.  In this day of \"food scientists\" constantly trying to put non-nutritional fillers or flavors in our food, putting quality second to taste....the conclusion I reach is that most of the char-flavor is some additive.  I threw up on the plane back to Chicago 2 hours in because the nausea from what I suspect were festering terpenes from their fake char taste.  It was disgusting to taste the festering \"smoke essence\" for hours after consuming.   These can only be attributed to artificial flavor additives.  Need proof-  I have had many burgers (including from BK before year 2000) and never had the lingering taste of fake flavorings make me nauseas.   McD's sucks now too.  BOTH of these chains are selling really low quality nutritional food for prices that no longer justify the consumption- JC", "But wouldn\u2019t the people that have worked at BK have told you about the charred saw dust water they use? I think you answered your own question. The impossible whopper tastes the same, it\u2019s 100% the broiler. Unless you can confirm Impossible makes a special patty just for BK and aren\u2019t disclosing the ingredients.", "Burger King do NOT use liquid flavouring\n\nTheir broiler gets that smoke taste", "Sometimes when I order burger king the patties just taste like butane or gasoline.\n\nReally disgusting"]}

A lot of Texas tap water is very hard, for instance, and heavy in minerals.

{"title": "Secrets from Costco", "selftext": "Here are some facts on how Costco Food Service operates their Food Court, Bakeries and their Rotisserie Chicken and other BBQ stuff. FYI, I am not a Costco employee. This info is just pure research.\n\n* So most of the bakery goods at Costco locations make their bread and bake it in-house at their bakeries. Bagels, croissants, danishes, cakes and cookie doughs are delivered from Costco's commissary kitchens to the warehouses.\n* They make breads, pies in-house from scratch.\n* Most of the frosting or buttercream, mousse are place in 50Lbs (50#) white bins stored in plastic bag. It's up to the cake decorators to design the cakes for Costco warehouses.\n* The Costco Business Centers sell bulk ingredients and other baking components to other small businesses.\n* The food court use Lamonica's pizza dough for the oversized pizzas, but they are also sold in 30 oz dough balls in the frozen section. Sometimes they have a made from scratch recipe when you have a rare event outdoors, you just have to talk to the kitchen manager or food service manager.\n* The pizza sauce is available at the Costco Business Center which can be sold to business owners. But Costco members can purchase them. It's called \"Costco Pizza Sauce Concentrate\" Item #879126 which has 6 packet in 1 case. Each packet requires you to add 82 oz of water to make 190 oz of pizza sauce to your pizzas. It is advisable to use your own pizza dough, grate a block of mozzarella and other cheeses of choice, pepperoni and your other toppings. This link is referenced by the [original post about Costco's Pizza Sauce Concentrate at PizzaMaking.com](https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=31104.0).\n* Most of the dry rubs they use is also available in their warehouses for their customers.\n* Also the bulk baking ingredients like icings, and other fillings they use on their desserts, cakes, and baked goods are located beneath their pre packaged baked goods. You'll noticed that there are huge tubs, bins and other ingredients for those who need in their small business.\n* For recipes on their baked goods, search on Google or use Reddit from r/TopSecretRecipes, r/Baking and r/Costco for dupe recipes of your favorite desserts.

I make super easy mousses using any flavor of instant pudding mix you desire & 2-3 cups heavy whipping cream (basically just replacing the cold milk with heavy whipping cream instead). Add pudding mix & heavy whipping cream until combined & soft peaks form. Refrigerate for a few minutes then mix again until stiff peaks form. Mousse will be nice and thick. You can still add any fruit preserves or pie fillings for additional flavor combinations as well. Keep refrigerated. It is spreadable/pipeable & can be used as a frosting. I use this for my cake fillings. It\u2019s super easy & delish. Not too sweet & overpowering.

There is much argument about how much if any mustard goes into the recipe and having tried this recipe side-by-side with one in Iowa, it is indiscernible from the store\u2019s version.  Key to a loose meat sandwich is the cooking the ground beef with the water, as below. It renders the fat differently than frying it in a dry pan like you do for taco meat.

That's a pretty niche ask.", "The Iowa chain?", "In ATL there is a good truck called The Sloppy Joe-lopy that services sloppy joes", "It was love at first sight.\n\nThe first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.\n\nYossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice. The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn't quite jaundice. If it became jaundice they could treat it. If it didn't become jaundice and went away they could discharge him. But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.\n\nEach morning they came around, three brisk and serious men with efficient mouths and inefficient eyes, accompanied by brisk and serious Nurse Duckett, one of the ward nurses who didn't like\n\nYossarian. They read the chart at the foot of the bed and asked impatiently about the pain. They seemed irritated when he told them it was exactly the same.\n\n'Still no movement?' the full colonel demanded.\n\nThe doctors exchanged a look when he shook his head.\n\n'Give him another pill.'\n\nNurse Duckett made a note to give Yossarian another pill, and the four of them moved along to the next bed. None of the nurses liked Yossarian. Actually, the pain in his liver had gone away, but Yossarian didn't say anything and the doctors never suspected. They just suspected that he had been moving his bowels and not telling anyone.\n\nYossarian had everything he wanted in the hospital. The food wasn't too bad, and his meals were brought to him in bed. There were extra rations of fresh meat, and during the hot part of the\n\nafternoon he and the others were served chilled fruit juice or chilled chocolate milk. Apart from the doctors and the nurses, no one ever disturbed him. For a little while in the morning he had to censor letters, but he was free after that to spend the rest of each day lying around idly with a clear conscience. He was comfortable in the hospital, and it was easy to stay on because he always ran a temperature of 101. He was even more comfortable than Dunbar, who had to keep falling down on\n\nhis face in order to get his meals brought to him in bed.\n\nAfter he had made up his mind to spend the rest of the war in the hospital, Yossarian wrote letters to everyone he knew saying that he was in the hospital but never mentioning why. One day he had a\n\nbetter idea. To everyone he knew he wrote that he was going on a very dangerous mission. 'They\n\nasked for volunteers. It's very dangerous, but someone has to do it. I'll write you the instant I get back.' And he had not written anyone since.\n\nAll the officer patients in the ward were forced to censor letters written by all the enlisted-men patients, who were kept in residence in wards of their own. It was a monotonous job, and Yossarian was disappointed to learn that the lives of enlisted men were only slightly more interesting than the lives of officers. After the first day he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony he invented games. Death to all modifiers, he declared one day, and out of every letter that passed through his\n\nhands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he made war on articles. He reached a much higher plane of creativity the following day when he blacked out everything in the letters but a, an and the. That erected more dynamic intralinear tensions, he felt, and in just about every case left a message far more universal. Soon he was proscribing parts of salutations and signatures and leaving the text untouched. One time he blacked out all but the salutation 'Dear Mary' from a letter, and at the bottom he wrote, 'I yearn for you tragically. R. O. Shipman, Chaplain, U.S. Army.' R.O.\n\nShipman was the group chaplain's name.\n\nWhen he had exhausted all possibilities in the letters, he began attacking the names and addresses on the envelopes, obliterating whole homes and streets, annihilating entire metropolises with\n\ncareless flicks of his wrist as though he were God. Catch22 required that each censored letter bear the censoring officer's name. Most letters he didn't read at all. On those he didn't read at all he wrote his own name. On those he did read he wrote, 'Washington Irving.' When that grew\n\nmonotonous he wrote, 'Irving Washington.' Censoring the envelopes had serious repercussions,\n\nproduced a ripple of anxiety on some ethereal military echelon that floated a C.I.D. man back into the ward posing as a patient. They all knew he was a C.I.D. man because he kept inquiring about an officer named Irving or Washington and because after his first day there he wouldn't censor letters.\n\nHe found them too monotonous.", "1 to 2 lbs.  80/20 ground beef/chuck \n(Or 85/15 ground beef/chuck, \nmash with potato masher till really fine)\n\nAdd ALL the following ingredients below (EXCEPT the toppings...

In my opinion, the way we\u2019ve always made them in a near perfect duplicate, and also slightly superior in taste. The process is simple.\n\n1 pound of 80/20 ground beef, half of a yellow onion diced(approx. 1/2 cup), 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 2 tablespoons white vinegar, 2 tablespoons yellow mustard, 1/4 cup of water. \n\nIn a skillet or saucepan add the ground beef, breaking it up roughly by hand and adding salt and pepper. Brown the meat over medium/high heat while using a wooden spoon to achieve ideal crumbling of the beef. Once browned, DO NOT drain the fat. Add the diced onion, sugar, vinegar, and mustard. Throughly mix and incorporate the ingredients into the beef and adjust to you preference if needed. Now add the water, cover the pan, and lower the heat to medium/low. Allow the meat to simmer until the water is gone, typically around 10 to 15 minutes. Once done, remove from heat and let it rest while remaining covered. \n\nAssembly is really a matter of personal taste but this is how I\u2019ve always done it. You\u2019ll need a pack of brioche rolls/hamburger buns, yellow mustard, and kosher dill pickles in the sandwich stuffer variety. Lightly toast the brioche buns to golden brown, pile a large helping of the meat onto the bottom bun, top with two dill pickles, and finish with the top bun with a generous spread of yellow mustard. \n\nServe sandwiches with sides of your choosing. Though I enjoy salt&vinegar fries or chips and mustard potato salad.", "I\u2019ll hook you up with my recipe based on the Greenville, Ohio Maid-rite. May be a little different than the Iowa chains:\n\nMaid-rites\n.....\n1 lb ground chuck. Browned and drained well of fat (I try to squeeze as much fat out of meat in colander using the back of a spatula) \n\n1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon Splenda\n\n1.5 tablespoons yellow mustard (regular table mustard out of squeeze bottle, NOT MUSTARD POWDER)\n\n1 teaspoon salt \n\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper. \n\nAfter browning and draining meat of fat, return to skillet and add all other ingredients to meat and add enough water to cover mixture. Boil out all the water, trying to finely break up the meat as the water boils out. Try to boil as much water out as possible. You want the meat mixture crumbly. \n\nAdd meat to buns with a layer of mustard, finely diced onions, and pickle slices. Top with Kraft cheese slices (optional). \n\nAfter the sandwich is assembled I like to nuke the sandwich in the microwave for 15-20 seconds. This softens up the bun more and slightly melts the cheese. Maid-rite steams their buns which makes them extra soft. So nuking the sandwiches like this after they\u2019re assembled replicated the steamed buns. \n\nA killer addition is to add some crunchy kettle cooked potato chips to the sandwich for a great additional crunch and flavor.", "LOOK BELOW\n\ud83d\ude0a", "Maid Rite is originally from Iowa."]}

People randomly add to the conversation from year to year. The chicken is spot on but the sauce recipe taste different but it's still a good tasting terriyaki recipe. \n\nThe chicken recipe was basically:\nSliced Chicken thighs, \n1 C Water\n1/8 C Cooking Sherry/Mirin\n3/4 tsp diced garlic (you want it to taste like just a hint of garlic, not the main flavor)\n1 1/4 tsp white pepper (maybe less because this spice is really overpowering, maybe 1/2 tsp)\n1/4 C Kikkoman Low Sodium Soy Sauce\n1/4 C Neutral Oil\nYou put this chicken and marinate/spice mix into a stand mixer with a dough hook and blend it until it looks like that white/pink blob like you see at the mall. This makes a MASSIVE difference in the texture of the chicken. \n\nIf you skip it then it won't have the same texture as what you get at the mall. There's no skipping this step if you want that texture. If you don't have a stand mixer you can put it into a zip lock bag and literally punch/hit/beat the meat with your fists, a rolling pin, a pan. You have to hit the meat for a while though, maybe 10 minutes of constantly hitting it without rupturing the bag open. I did that once and decided just to get a stand mixer.\n\nYou put this meat blob on an oiled flat griddle or a pan and lay it flat on the surface. Let one side brown, I like it really crispy/cooked so I really get it brown, then flip it all then add your sauce.\n\nHere's the sauce recipe from someone in the thread and it taste similar but not spot on to Sarku.\n\n\"Well, here it is for all to enjoy. I have to admit, in the stock pot on the stove the brown sauce has a rather sharp flavor to it. But once it's added to the\u00a0chicken\u00a0in a hot fry pan it really mellows out. With that in mind:\n\nBrown Sauce:\n2 1/2 C Unsalted\u00a0Chicken\u00a0Stock (I used Kitchen Basics)\n3/4 C + 2 T Kikkoman Teriyaki Sauce\n1/4 C + 2 T Kikkoman Low Sodium Soy Sauce\n1 Clove Garlic\n1 Thin Slice Ginger Root\n3/4 C + 2 T Brown Sugar\n\nTo prepare the brown sauce, slice the garlic clove into 3 or 4 slices and add to the\u00a0chicken\u00a0stock with the ginger root. Heat slowly stirring frequently on med/low until warm. Promptly remove the garlic and ginger. Leaving the ginger in too long at this point will really add a spicy flavor to it so be careful not to leave it in too long. Add remaining ingredients and slowly bring to a light boil stirring constantly. Then, stir vigorously while you thicken it with the corn starch/water mixture mentioned by K. Hitchens.\n\nI just made this recipe again a few days ago and the results were excellent. Follow the \"massaging\" hints and pan-frying technique and other helpful tips by K. Hitchens along with this recipe and hopefully you will end up with something very close to the Sarku flavor.

Make a [roux](https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/articles/how-to-make-a-roux-a-step-by-step-guide) using chicken fat (aka schmaltz) if you can find it, or just oil if you can't (most gravy recipes use butter, but since they don't, I don't think you want it here). You need one tablespoon of each. Make one cup of chicken bullion according to the package; I typically use Better than Bullion, and it would be one teaspoon to one cup of water. Add a bit of MSG (no more than 1/8 teaspoon, a little goes a long way) and some onion powder (a sprinkle to start, no more than 1/4 teaspoon should be necessary). Taste for salt; bullion is usually salty, but you may need more to match the KFC flavor considering how high salt is on the ingredients. Your gravy will probably be paler than theirs; there's a product called Kitchen Bouquet that you could add a couple drops of to match the color. The elusive spices might be missing; I typically would add a bit of sage and marjoram to chicken gravy, but I doubt theirs has much complexity. The original [11 herbs and spices](https://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-kfc-recipe-revealed-20160818-story.html) can be found online. They are: salt, thyme, basil, oregano, celery salt, black pepper, dried mustard, paprika, garlic salt, ground ginger, white pepper. Some of those may be present in the gravy, but again, I doubt they use that much complexity nowadays.", "Babish has you covered friend:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WtAoc3_1Ido", "What\u2019s the potato brand?", "You trying to fuck me dude?

{"title": "Fuddruckers Burgers and Fries at Home-- FULL MEAL PREPARATION", "selftext": "Any burger purist knows the glory that once was Fuddruckers, and that in its heyday, it truly was the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Hamburger,\u201d as their signage so proudly declared.\u00a0 Today Fudds is in a state of near-extinction.\u00a0 Spotting one, especially a mega-Fudds built in the early 90\u2019s, is like spotting a northern white rhino in the wild.\u00a0x Most of them have been closed, and the ones remaining suffer from cutbacks in quality, offerings and experience so egregious that they\u2019re nearly unrecognizable. \u00a0\n\nThe concept was simple: in order to make the world\u2019s greatest hamburger they needed to take the three basic burger components\u2014bun, meat, toppings\u2014and provide the best version of each, ever offered, period. For the bun, Fudds had an in-house bakery, where plump, steaming rounds of pure heaven were pulled from ovens all day long.\u00a0 That smell of freshly baked bread was the first thing to hit you walking into a Fudds, and the last thing to bid you farewell, enticing an inevitable return.\u00a0 For the meat, they had an in-house butcher shop where the beef was freshly ground daily, with whole forequarters hanging from the ceiling, and a window where you could actually see the butchers at work (if that was your thing).\u00a0 And finally, for the toppings, a famously bountiful self-serve buffet of fresh veg, condiments, and of course, self-serve pump stations of that hot, gooey, molten-gold cheese sauce.\u00a0 Beyond the burger, the fries were equally exceptional\u2014wedge cut, skin-on potatoes, deep fried in canola oil to an amber crisp, liberally seasoned with \u201cFudds Spice\u201d\u2014a proprietary blend of seasonings (heavily favoring paprika) that, when also sprinkled on the burger itself as it hit the griddle, created a flavor amalgamation across the plate that resulted in something other-worldly, and something which humanity had neither experienced before, nor since.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, the closure of your local Fudds was a devastating event.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t around when JFK got whacked, but I imagine the level of grief was similar.\u00a0 The initial penetrating shock gave way to a deep, steady depression, and finally, a measure of unbridled anger I had never known.\u00a0 Why should my life even continue if there\u2019s no more Fudds?\u00a0 One day, in a moment of rarified personal strength and industry, I determined that if I could no longer go to Fudds, I would make Fudds come to me.\n\nIt has been that singular endeavor, my brothers, born of comprehensive research and an unwavering commitment to home-kitchen experimentation, that has led me back to the Promised Land, and to this post, which I offer for the benefit of humanity at large.\u00a0\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n**THE MEAT:**\n\nSchweid & Sons - Butcher Blend\n\n[https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/](https://schweidandsons.com/product/the-butchers-blend/)\n\nYou can also go with their other blends like Signature or Heritage. Additionally they offer USDA Prime chuck, American Wagyu (their \u201cKatana\u201d blend), and several other options. Experiment with your tastes and what\u2019s available but these are all excellent blends for premium burger patties. I recommend buying the brick of mince rather than the pre-formed patties as it allows you to create a slightly looser pack. Even though Fudds now uses pre-formed, pre-ground patties of all-chuck, I feel that going with these higher-grade blends greatly enhances flavor and results in a burger closer to the OG Fudds in-house, freshly ground taste of memory.\u00a0\n\n**THE BUN:**\n\nBoulangerie Ace Bakery - Gourmet Buns - Classic\n\n[https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/](https://acebakery.com/product/classic-gourmet-bun/)\n\nYou\u2019re looking for a premium bakery bun with that shiny golden dome, but ideally NOT a brioche bun. These are the closest I\u2019ve found where I live, but many bakeries may offer premium buns that fit this description.\u00a0\n\n**THE SPICE:**\n\n[https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html](https://donuts2crumpets.com/2019/04/copycat-fuddruckers-burger-seasoning.html)\n\nThis is the special ingredient that brings it all together and ultimately makes Fudds\u2026well, Fudds. It\u2019s easily made at home. Follow the recipe to the letter, and multiply proportions as needed to ensure your home is never without the essential magic that is Fudd Spice.\u00a0\n\n**THE FRIES:**\n\nWild Fork Foods - Potato Wedges\n\n[https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa\\_Ap3Mt4soZ7](https://wildforkfoods.com/products/potato-wedges/?srsltid=AfmBOoq6LlSFsiv7jQqOumXZuo9lxmyd8bWZKL-XncYWa_Ap3Mt4soZ7)\n\nTBH this was the trickiest component. French fry aficionados may prefer to attempt freshly cut wedges, but these are very close, if not spot-on, and without the hassle. The trick is finding wedges that aren\u2019t overly pre-seasoned because you need to add the Fudd Spice to make these taste correct, and most frozen wedges come with factory seasoning that tampers with (or completely ruins) the authenticity.\u00a0 Bake, air-fry, or, for the closest match, do what they do at Fudds and deep fry in canola oil, drain, and then sprinkle liberally with the magic dust!\n\n**THE CHEESE SAUCE:**\n\nRico\u2019s Premium Cheddar Cheese Sauce\n\n[https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/](https://ricos.com/products/premium-cheddar-cheese-sauce/)\n\nYes, it\u2019s from a can, but it\u2019s spot on. If you want to go a fresher, more culinarily-sophisticated route, Godspeed, but I\u2019ve been going to Fudds for decades and trust me, for the express purpose of recreating the authentic Fudds experience in your maw, this is the cheese sauce you\u2019re looking for.\u00a0\n\n**THE TOPPINGS BAR:**\n\nThis goes without saying, but any home replication of that glorious fresh market of fixin\u2019s should include: sliced tomato, onion (multiple colors), lettuce (at least two leaf varieties), pickles, salsa, relish, jalape\u00f1o and other pepper varieties, and of course every condiment known to man, never to exclude the basic staples of ketchup, mustard, mayo, 1000 island, and anything else your little heart desires. Needless to say the cheese sauce as mentioned above will factor formidably into the final equation as well.\u00a0\n\n**BURGER PREPARATION:**\n\nFor authenticity it is essential that you cook your burger on a griddle. If you don\u2019t have one, a frying pan or cast iron skillet will substitute in a pinch.\u00a0 Do not, however, attempt to grill over an open flame. You will be rendering all the above meticulous preparations null and void, and doing yourself a great disservice in the bargain.\u00a0 If your griddle or skillet is unseasoned or rarely-used, you may consider adding a tablespoon of canola, avocado, or vegetable oil to the heated surface before laying down your patty. Remember, we are going for authenticity here, and the burger you remember from Fudds was not born of a pristine, virginal cook top, but rather of the greasy remnants of hundreds if not thousands of other burgers born before it on that same cook top. \u00a0\n\n1. Form your beef into 1/3 or 1/2 pound patties taking care not to pack too tightly.\u00a0\n2. Pre-heat griddle on medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil if desired, as suggested above.\u00a0\n3. Place the patty down onto the pre-heated griddle and sprinkle liberally with Fudd spice.\u00a0 This is how they did it at fudds\u2014they did not pre-season the patties before hitting the griddle, as you can see from video footage of Fudds cooks in action from the 1990\u2019s glory days.\u00a0 Cook for 4-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired temperature).\u00a0 Press the patty gently downward with your spatula not more than twice during this initial phase of cooking. Do not \u201csmash\u201d or cut the patty.\u00a0 Just enough pressure to aid in even cooking within and without, while simultaneously facilitating more caramelization on the outer rim. You want it Fudds style\u2014thick, juicy, with a respectable char on the outside.\n4. Flip the patty and cook for an additional 3-6 minutes (depending on patty thickness and desired cook temperature).\u00a0 During this second phase you may elect to sprinkle the Fudd spice again, though, from what I have gleaned from archival footage on YouTube, the OG Fudds cooks did NOT bust a second sprinkydink.\u00a0 During the last minute of cooking, place a square (or squares) of your preferred cheese on the patty and cover with a metal bowl or cooking dome.\u00a0\n5. At some point during phase two of cooking the burger, brush melted butter on the inside of both halves of the bun, and place, butter side down, on the griddle in order to toast.\u00a0 Remove the buns when the insides achieve a golden crisp, being careful not to let them burn.\u00a0\n6. Place the toasted bun halves on a plate, insides facing up, and remove the perfectly cooked burger from the griddle with your spatula, deftly sliding it atop the bottom bun.\n7. Top with fixin\u2019s of your choice and finally enclose the masterpiece with the top bun.\u00a0\n8. Serve alongside your freshly cooked wedge fries, and sides of the hot cheese sauce, and tell heaven you\u2019ll call them back tomorrow.\u00a0\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "created_utc": 1745353029.0, "score": 149, "author": "AceRutherfords", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1k5gdgu/fuddruckers_burgers_and_fries_at_home_full_meal/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I miss the hell out of Fuddruckers.

So this condiment was invented by her. Even the Japanese that occupied Manila loved bananas. This is a made from scratch recipe which overripe Cavendish bananas can be used.\n* I have used Chef John\u2019s video on making banana ketchup - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoYO7ZMSopo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoYO7ZMSopo)\n\n260 GRAMS RED OR WHITE ONIONS, PEELED & FINELY SLICED\n\n25 GRAMS OR 3 GARLIC CLOVES, PEELED\n\n80 GRAMS OR 1/2-INCH SMALL KNOB OF GINGER, PEELED & FINELY SLICED\n\n1-2 JALAPENOS, FINELY SLICED ( SPICINESS CAN BE ADJUSTED)\n\n180 ML CANOLA OIL\n\n200 GRAMS TOMATO PASTE\n\n3/4 TSP GROUND TURMERIC\n\n1.5 TSPS SPANISH SMOKED PAPRIKA\n\n3/4 TSP ALLSPICE (WARM SPICE) OR\n\n3/4 TSP CLOVES (IF YOU WANT THAT HEINZ 57 OR HEINZ KETCHUP TASTE)\n\n1/4 TSP CAYENNE PEPPER (FOR SPICY HOT FLAVOR)\n\n1 KG OR 2.2 LBS OVERRIPE BANANAS\n\n400 ML COCONUT OR FRUITY BASED VINEGAR (LIKE DATU PUTI CANE SUGAR VINEGAR OR APPLE CIDER VINEGAR)\n\n{CHOOSE A VINEGAR THAT HAS A HIGH SUGAR CONTENT ESPECIALLY FRUITY VINEGARS}\n\n675 GRAMS BROWN SUGAR\n\n200 ML LIGHT SOY SAUCE (PREFERABLY ANY LIGHT SOY SAUCE LIKE LAURIAT OR SILVER SWAN BRAND, IF YOU CANNOT FIND ANY - ANY BRAND WILL DO)\n\n75 ML FISH SAUCE (ALSO CALLED PATIS)\n\n5 G SALT, TO TASTE\n\nAdd onions, garlic, ginger, jalapenos and some oil to agitate it in a HIGH - SPEED blender. Cover and pulse on HIGH unit it becomes a thick, smooth and off-white paste. Transfer to a bowl.\n\nDon\u2019t wash your blender, add the bananas, vinegar, light soy sauce, patis or fish sauce. Cover and pulse on HIGH until it becomes a thin light tan but smooth paste. Transfer to another large bowl. Set aside both bowls.\n\nIn a dutch oven or a large sauce pan over MEDIUM HEAT, saute\u2019 all of the blended vegetables to intensify all of the flavors. Add the 1st vegetable puree and let all of the water evaporate to make an oily but thick craggy paste left over. The volume will also be reduced by 1/3. It will look like kind of greenish with some oils separating at the edge of the saucepan. Add tomato paste and stir to get it incorporated. It will turn to a deep red paste and oil starts to change in color as well. Add the ground turmeric, Spanish smoked paprika, Allspice and Cayenne Pepper by letting them bloom with the tomato onion mixture. It will be fragrant as you cook for about 2 minutes. Add the blended banana puree, and stir until it becomes a thick, dark tan in color. Add in the brown sugar to caramelize the banana ketchup for 2 mins. Reduce the mixture down to a quarter, or until it becomes a thick and jammy sauce. Stir occasionally to avoid burning ingredients at the bottom.\n\nDecrease the heat to LOW, and simmer it for 15 to 20 minutes with the lid partially open. The banana ketchup is deep red and your spatula will look like a thick banana sauce holds on the back of the spoon. Taste and season with salt to heighten the banana flavor. At this point, you can even adjust the seasoning on how you like it whether you want more:\n\nsweetness - brown sugar\n\npungent or astringent - fruit or coconut vinegar\n\nwarm spices - allspice or you can use cloves\n\nsalty - soy sauce\n\nspicy - cayenne pepper or any type of chili powder, you have or want to try to change its flavor profile of the banana ketchup\n\nIf you are satisfied on what you have, transfer ketchup to a bowl. let it cool completely on the counter at room temperature. Then transfer to a sterilized mason jar.\n\nYou can use this as a condiment for burgers, fries, lumping shanghai or maybe cooking the Jolly spaghetti sauce.\n\nTake this recipe as a guide on making your own banana ketchup depending on how you want it to taste.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nPANCIT PALABOK: COPYCAT\n\n* This is my family\u2019s recipe on making palabok as it is more delicious compared to Jollibee.

I tried all of them as they were not available in the States. They were filling for a snack or light breakfast. When I was there, I liked the corned beef pie and the tuna pie. Then I tried the Choco Mallows Pie at another location, and OMG! It was so good. This pie had a chocolate pie crust but it had a slightly vanilla sweet cream. It was so good. You can definitely make it. Of course, these pies were sold as limited time products.\n\nYou can be creative making your own fry pies with many flavor combinations and can use the peach mango recipe as a guide to make your own fruit fillings like blueberries, apple, pineapple.\n\nI will post few pie fillings that feature tropical flavors like haupia, guava jam, passionfruit on another post.\n\nOf course, Jollibee are creating pies made with Filipino flavors like buko pandan or coconut pandan, ube, ube macapuno or ube coconut, pineapple langka or pineapple jackfruit, choco mallows (this flavor was inspired by a Fibisco choco snack that has a marshmallow mound on a biscuit then covered with bittersweet chocolate coating). Then you can put savory fillings like a tuna salad, corned beef and potatoes, ham egg & cheese,bacon egg cheese. Also, the bacon in most Asian countries like the Philippines is not smoked but cured with Filipino-Chinese spice blend. It tasted different from their American counterpart where they smoked their pork belly bacon with either Mesquite or Hickory wood chips and slow-cooked it to be tender.and mouth watering.

{"title": "The Cheesecake Factory Original Cheesecake", "selftext": "The owners tweaked the original cheesecake recipe, and made it their own. So this is the basic Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.\n\nCrust:  \n2-1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs  \n1/4 cup sugar  \n1/2 cup butter, melted  \nFilling:  \n4 packages (8 oz. each) cream cheese, softened  \n2 cups sour cream  \n1-3/4 cups sugar  \n1 tablespoon vanilla extract  \n4 large eggs, lightly beaten  \nTopping:  \n1 cup sour cream  \n1/4 cup sugar\n\nStep 1: Make the graham cracker crust  \nPreheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. In a small bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and the sugar, and stir in the melted butter. Press the mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of a greased 9-inch springform pan.  \nPlace the springform pan on a baking sheet, and bake until lightly browned, about 18 to 22 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the cheesecake filling  \nIn a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese, sour cream, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Then, add the eggs and beat on low speed, just until combined. It\u2019s important not to overbeat the filling, which can lead to cracks in the cheesecake later on.\n\nStep 3: Pour the filling into the crust  \nPlace the springform pan on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil (about 18 square inches), and securely wrap the foil around the pan, which will prevent any spillage. Pour the filling into the cooled crust.\n\nStep 4: Make the water bath  \nPlace the foil-wrapped springform pan with the unbaked cheesecake in a larger baking pan, and add 1 inch of hot water to the larger pan to create the water bath.\n\nStep 5: Bake the cheesecake  \nBake at 325\u00b0 for about 1-1/2 hours, or until the center of the cheesecake is just set and the top appears dull.  \nAfter you take the cheesecake out of the oven, remove the springform pan from the water bath, and let it stand for five minutes on a wire rack.  \nTip: Don\u2019t use a toothpick to test for doneness, as you would for cake or brownies. Instead, do the wobble test.  \nOpen the oven door and give the pan a gentle but firm rap with a spoon to see if it wobbles.\n\nStep 6: Make the sour cream topping  \nIn a small bowl, mix the sour cream and sugar. When combined, spread it over the top of the cheesecake. Bake five minutes longer without the water bath. Pull it out of the oven and let cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack.\n\nStep 7: Set and refrigerate the cheesecake  \nLoosen the graham cracker crust from the sides of the pan with a knife, and remove the foil from around the springform pan. Cool for one hour longer on a wire rack.  \nRefrigerate the cheesecake overnight, covering when completely cooled. Remove the rim from the pan.\n\nStep 8: Serve.  \nAfter your cheesecake has been refrigerated overnight, it\u2019s ready to enjoy! While it already has a sour cream topping, you could choose to serve it with a drizzle of homemade strawberry syrup, glazed strawberries, chocolate ganache or a salted caramel sauce if you want to take it over the top.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1eusny9/the_cheesecake_factory_original_cheesecake/", "created_utc": 1723930465.0, "score": 140, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 10, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1eusny9/the_cheesecake_factory_original_cheesecake/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Love you !!

If you are curious about NY Style Pizza like MOD which can also be helpful when it comes to making dough I recommend [Babish NY Pizza](https://youtu.be/KUu2gJn1dzc).  I know I suggested him a lot but his channel is my favorite for basic recipies that you can experiment with once you get a feel for the basics.\n\n00 Caputo Flour is going to be the most authentic pizza shop flour used for making dough (you can get it on Amazon).  But your pressed out dough needs to be very thin, probably not even 2mm and even all the way around (11 inches is the MOD size).  A press is only used for speed, your dough can be kneaded and stretched by hand.  Especially if your dough is smaller, you'll want to \"dock\" your dough prior to putting anything on it, especially if it's warm, which is essentially just putting little holes in the dough to prevent bubbles from forming in the oven and ruining your pizza.\n\nThe trick to getting the crust is the way you lay down the sauce.  There are a million ways you can make pizza sauce but the most common is simply a tomato base with basil and oregano (I would suggest watching [Basics With Babish: Pizza](https://youtu.be/7cqYiUmutGI)).  The sauce needs to be spread on the entire pizza except for within about 1/2 an inch (or a the width of your thumb) from the edge of the dough.  This allows the crust to puff up very well in the oven.  People often ask us to put garlic sauce on the crust but this prevents the crust from expanding the way it's supposed to, so if you want it how's it's meant to be, nothing should be on the edge.\n\nEdit: to preface about the mozz, you will get exceptionally better tasting cheese if you grate it fresh.  Get the ball of mozz you find at the store, chill it in the freezer for 30 minutes (it will grate easier) and chill your grater as well.  If you get the preshredded stuff, it will be covered in starch and it will clump up and not melt properly.\n\nA healthy and sprinkling of fresh, high moisture mozzarella cheese is what MOD uses.  I suggest starting from the outside and moving in, otherwise you'll get clumps in the center that will prevent the dough from cooking all the way through.\n\nYour oven should be on as hot as possible, the MOD oven operates around 600F, obviously your oven won't be that hot but 450-550F is fine for a home oven.  Ideally, you want a pizza stone that is as hot as the oven, so it's going to stay in the oven while the oven is heating up and your pizza will be placed on top of it.  If you don't have a pizza stone, a metal pan works fine.\n\nUse a fork or a long knife if any large (bigger than a quarter) bubbles form to pop them, but some people like the bubbles so to each their own.  Your pizza should have a scattered pattern of brown spots on the bottom but ideally not black (again, this depends on how well done you like your pizza).  But underdone can be dangerous, you can get sick from undercooked dough.  Your pizza is done cooking when you can lift half of it up and the rest stays rigid, as in, it doesn't flop back down.  The more toppings you add, the more it's likely to flop so looking at the bottom for the \"leopard\" pattern of brown spots is the best method to check for doneness.\n\nOnce you think it's done (probably will have cooked for 8-10 minutes depending on the oven), you can bring the pizza out, cut and enjoy.  You should get that nice flaky, thin crust you're looking for!  If there's any more questions feel free to ask!\n\nEdit: fixed some minor details", "You can do so much better. MOD's dough isn't even made in-house."]}

There are no seasonings in it. If you look at there ingredient list for there sauce it shows   tomatoes, tomato juices, salt, and citric acid. That is basically just a regular canned whole tomato. I have had probably 1000's of there deep dish pizzas and the sauce to me taste like just whole tomatoes. Its actually kind of hard to recreate there sauce as they have been using the same tomato farms in California for a long time and all there tomatoes come from the same farm. If you buy a can of muir glenn there tomatoes come from 1000's of farms. You used to be able to buy canned tomatoes directly from lou's but I believe they stopped that in like 2014 but doesn't hurt to ask them if you could buy a can. \n\nIf you can not buy a can of there tomatoes your only other option is to find a replacement can of tomato's. The tomatoes that lou's uses are very sweet. Sweeter I think then any of the common brands you see at the store(hunts muir glen, etc...) so you will want to try and find the sweetest tomatoes you can find. the other option is to add a little sugar to the sauce to approximate the sweetness of there tomatoes.  The closest I have come to recreating there sauce is the 365 tomatoes they sell at whole foods that i simmer on low heat for 2 hours and then use my stick blender and break up the tomatoes just a little bit you still want some large chunks of tomatoes in there. I then add a pinch of sugar and simmer another 30 minutes taste and either its good or add more sugar until I am happy. Lous I believe do not stick blend there tomatoes so we differ there. The reason I break them up is the sugar incorporates more evenly. \n\nHere is a little video from lou's on what makes there sauce special\n\n[https://www.loumalnatis.com/blog/lous-ingredients-series-tomatoes/](https://www.loumalnatis.com/blog/lous-ingredients-series-tomatoes/)", "This is the unity our country needs right now.

He broke them up by hand on to the pizza.", "You got a recipe for their crust by chance?\n\nAs for the tomatoes, 6-in-1 tomatoes with heavy puree seems to imitate the sauce Lou\u2019s uses well.

I\u2019ve always lived within 5 miles from Lou\u2019s and I couldn\u2019t ever live without it. \n\nThe sauce itself is quite plain and it\u2019s on the chunkier side so I\u2019d recommend diced tomatoes. It\u2019s good quality tomatoes with some salt and cook it down. I think a little bit of oregano. The consistency is a little tricky because the sauce goes on top of the cheese. It needs to be thin enough it won\u2019t dry out as it bakes, but thick enough to evaporate and not leave the pizza too wet.", "Take up a collection from the people who want the recipe and bribe someone in the kitchen.

You can eat this directly from the can.  Smash them up so you can spread it on the pizza and just add a bit of salt and oregano to taste and you have the closest thing you can get to Lou's sauce.  You will have to look at a place like Gordon Foods, Restaurant Depot or a local Italian deli.  You will not be disappointed and everyone I have made pizza for has agreed that it is at least as good if not better than Lou's.  Good luck and you will thank me later!", "You guys cannot convince me that Lou\u2019s does not add white wine to their tomato sauce.

First would be on the chicken itself, and second would be in the four that you use to bread the chicken.  You can also add blackening after it is cooked.  I believe that popeyes adds blackening to the flour and I think they add more after it is fried.

I don't think they put blackening on the chicken itself before they cook it.  I could be wrong about that.\n\nI would recommend looking up a recipe for fried chicken tenders.

{"title": "Copycat versions of Wingstop sauces", "selftext": "So I made some boneless wings or chicken tenders today that is breaded with panko breadcrumbs, flour and eggs. Fry them in 350F oil.\n\nOr If you want your chicken wings crispy, **bake them in a 400\u00b0 F oven for about 40 minutes**. You can reduce the temp of the oven to 170 and keep them in the oven for 20-30 more minutes to make the skin extra crispy.\n\nI only tried to replicate only some of their wings sauces and 1 of their seasonings they make. These are copycat versions.\n\nThis is Danny T's Brennan Cajun SeasoningMakes 2 cups1/2 cup Paprika, 6 tbsps garlic powder, 6 tbsps ground black pepper, 5 tbsps onion powder, 3 tbsps cayenne pepper powder, 3 tbsps dried thyme, 3 tbsps dried oregano.\n\nNotes:\\* Use melted butter instead of butter flavored oil that they use to mix all of their sauces into their wings to cut food costs.\\* Cajun Chef Original Wing Sauce is the hot sauce for their wings and chicken products.\\*\n\nThe right ratio is 4 parts butter, melted and 1 part sauce.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the Wingstop Sauces:\n\nHickory BBQ - 1 cup butter, melted and 1/4 cup Hickory BBQ Sauce. You can use your favorite whether it is Sugar Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ sauce.\n\nMild: 1 cup butter,melted and 1/4 cup Cajun Chef Original Hot or your favorite Frank's Red Hot Cayenne Pepper Sauce.\n\nLemon Pepper: 1 cup butter, melted and 1/4 cup McCormick Culinary Lemon Pepper or your preferred choice of Lemon Pepper Seasoning.\n\nLouisiana Rub: 1 cup butter, melted + 2 Tbsps Louisiana Rub + 1 Tbsp Brown Sugar\n\nGarlic Parmesan: 1 cup butter, melted + 2 Tbsps Garlic Powder + Finishing: Sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan.\n\nHot Honey: 1 cup butter, melted + 2 to 3 Tbsps MIke's Hot Honey. If you want sweeter, I suggest adding 2 Tbsps brown sugar or more depending how sweet you want.

Heat butter on a saucepan, saute garlic and ginger until garlic is light brown. Add the remaining ingredients and stir until sauce thickens over MEDIUM high heat. Remove pan from heat\n\nToss in cooked and fried chicken wings onto the sauce until wings are fully tossed.\n\nTransfer korean chicken wings to a plate, Sprinkle some sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Enjoy while they are hot!\n\nWS Buttermilk Ranch:1 cup Hellman's mayonnaise, 1.5 cups buttermilk, 2-3 oz Hidden Valley Ranch Mix Restaurant-Style packetsMix all ingredients until it is a flowing consistency.WS Bleu Cheese Dressing:1 cup Hellman's mayonnaise, 1.5 cups buttermilk, 2 tbsps sour cream, 2 tbsp dehydrated onion flakes and 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1/3 cup blue cheese crumbles, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce.Mix until it is fully incorporated and flowing consistency.----\n\nShop Cajun Chef either on Amazon or [here](https://www.cajunchefshop.com/)\n\nMix each sauce with a whisk in a large bowl.

So far my research shows that the people who work at the restaurants get them frozen and just toss them in the fryer. I don't particularly like them, but my wife really liked them and was very disappointed when the recipe changed a few months back. I think this has something to do with Bloomin Brands' push for Tender Shack to have a bigger presence throughout the country, and why have different chicken at these two restaurants? Just a theory, but I think it makes sense.\n\nThe unique thing about Outback's tenders were that the breading was crunchy, but not sharply so. It almost had a \"breadi-ness\" to it, and conformed tightly to the meat. Very uniform color, never dark. The other, more unique, thing was that the breading was strangely sweet, compared to other typical restaurant tenders. Is replicating the recipe as simple as adding sugar into the flour mix?

And curiously, there's three different mustards: what looks like a yellow/brown (but not your usual off-the shelf yellow, because that has turmeric in it for color), Dijon, and \"country\" Dijon (which does have turmeric). There's two vinegars and lemon juice, plus onion and garlic. Egg yolk is there, but not listed as mayo itself (like the mustards are listed), and note there's no oil like there would be if it was mayo (and it's pretty low in fat, given how high the caloric count is per serving).

You can increase or decrease the original yield on how much you use depending which cuisines or dishes you cook often.\n\nSo these are my Top 10 spice blends that I use at work and Home:s, and others are copycat recipes(maybe better than brand names and store-bought): All of the spice blends are generally 1 cup or 250 grams in yield. You can increase or decrease the original yield on how much you use depending on which cuisines or dishes you cook often. So let's get to the recipes that you are anticipating.\n\nOne thing to note: you can add the salt later on since I want to control if I am cooking and baking it. I use kosher salt ( I prefer Diamond Crystal, Sysco or Morton - depending on the availability of the product. I taste how salty is the salt because not every brand is equal in terms of taste or how it is ground).\n\n\\#1: Italian - 1 part each of dried thyme, rosemary, dried oregano and dried basil. 1/4 cup each of dried thyme, rosemary, dried Italian or Mexican oregano and dried basil leaves.\n\nWeigh or use dry measuring cup to measure for each herbs and transfer in a medium bowl. Use gloves, and hand mix and toss the dried herbs until well blended and combined. Transfer to an airtight container. You can use this to accentuate spaghetti, creamy sauces, other spice blends, pasta dishes and soups.\n\n\\#2 Chinese 7-Spice - 3 Star anise pods, 20 whole cloves, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 Tbsp Sichuan peppercorns husk only, 1 tsp fennel seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and 1/2 tsp ground white pepper.\n\nDry toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon, fennel seeds and Sichuan peppercorn husk on a skillet over Low to MEDIUM low heat. Shake them occasionally until they are fragrant. Avoid burning them. If they are fragrant. Transfer them to a bowl to cool completely. Put all of the contents in a high-speed blender, Nutribullet or Magic bullet. Cover. Pulse on HIGH until the spice blend is in fine powder and well blended. Transfer to an airtight container. Cover and keep in dry place.  \nYou can use this on any Chinese dishes or any dish that require that Chinese 5-spice powder. Use this instead.\n\n\\#3 Garam Masala - a housemade recipe that I use for Indian cooking especially biryani, making sandwich spreads, Indian gravy dishes and even making some raita.  \n82.5 grams coriander seeds, 50 grams cumin seeds, 2.5 grams caraway, 15 grams ground black pepper, 1.5 star anise pods, 1.5\" cinnamon stick or 7.5 grams ground cinnamon, 2.5 Black cardamom pods,7.5 grams whole cloves, 5 grams fennel seeds, 2.5 grams bay leaves and 2 grams dried ginger root.  \nDry toast coriander, cumin and fennel seeds, caraway, whole black peppercorns, star anise pods, cinnamon stick, black cardamom pods, whole cloves, bay leaves and dried ginger root on a skillet over Low to medium low heat. Toss to avoid burning and spices are evenly toasted and until spices are fragrant. If you smell the aroma of the spices, transfer to a bowl and allow to cool completely. Transfer all of the contents to a high-speed blender, Nutribullet or Magic Bullet, cover and pulse on HIGH until it becomes a very fine powder. Let it sit there for few minutes to avoid any dust from flying away once you open it. Transfer to an airtight container, close and store in a cool but dry place.\n\n\\#4  Garlic & Herb Seasoning - This housemade recipe is \"maybe better\" than McCormick's Culinary Garlic Herb Seasoning. You may want to invest buying some hard-to-find spices online. Trust me, it tastes better, freshly made and can be used on multiple cooking applications. Also the orange peel gives it tangy sweet and summery feel of the spices and herb blend. You can substitute the dehydrated orange peel for freshly grated lemon peel but I would increase to 1 tbsp for more lemony taste to it. You can definitely use this for chicken wings, add 3/4 cup butter, melted and slightly cooled then 3 tbsps of the garlic and herb seasoning to coat freshly fried or baked wings.  \n2 tbsps garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 2 tsps Italian seasoning, 2 tsps ground white pepper, 2 tsps dehydrated veggies (carrots, celery and onion) or dehydrated bell pepper blend (red and green bell peppers), 1.5 tsps sweet marjoram, 1.5 tsps parsley flakes or dried parsley leaves, 1.5 savory (summer), 1 tsp granulated orange peel or 1 tbsp freshly grated lemon peel, 1/2 tsp cayenne (adjust for spiciness or heat. You can substitute another type of cayenne pepper or another type of chili powder of choice), 1/2 tsp ground cumin, and 1/2 tsp yellow mustard seeds.  \nCombine all of the spices and herbs in a Nutribullet, cover and pulse on HIGH until it becomes a fine powder spice blend. Transfer to an airtight storage container. Store in a cool and dry place.\n\n\\#5: Cream of soup mix - 500 grams full cream powdered milk, 325 gams ap flour, 60 grams dehydrated veggies, 15 grams onion powder, 15 grams garlic powder. Combine all of the ingredients in a medium bowl until well combined. You can use this to make soup, gravies, creamy sauce and add more mushrooms, meat. 1/2 cup of mix to 1 cup boiling water.\n\n\\#6 CHICKEN OR BEEF BOUILLION BASE POWDER (better than any LKK, Knorr or any bouillion cube, paste, store bought out there) - 110 grams of either Chicken or Beef Stock powder (or bone broth powder), 15 grams rubbed sage, 7.5 grams EACH: Parsley flakes or dried parsley leaves, Dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried Mexican or Italian Oregano or Italian spice blend, garlic powder, onion powder. 5 grams MSG or Accent Flavor Enhancer, optional.  \nThis bouillion base can add umami flavor punch while cooking soups, stews, chowders, rice, sauces, gravies and other sides. This is a better alternative with any flavor based bouillion cube or powder giving an extra umami taste and flavor of your dish.  \nI recommend adding 1 tbsp to flavor rice, side or a gravy. If you were to  make a quick soup, use 1 tsp chicken or beef bouillion base powder : 1 cup hot water.  \nIf you want it vegan then this is the alternative - 110 grams Nutritional yeast\n\n\\#7 CAJUN SEASONING - I have been using this cajun seasoning for many years either at work and at home. Very versatile spice blend - 20 grams salt,  20 grams paprika, 15 grams garlic powder, 15 grams ground black pepper, 12.5 grams onion powder, 7.5 grams cayenne pepper, 7.5 grams dried thyme, 7.5 grams dried oregano.\n\n\\#8 CAJUN SPARKLE - Tnanks BlindDogz for making a copycat of Popeyes Cajun Sparkle. Cajun Sparkle is a secret spice blend that is available at Popeyes but it was available since 2019, and they want this packet available never had any media publicity. Only stories coming from REddit and other social media platforms surfaced when people were raving that this secret spice blend exist at Popeyes.

[BlindDogz Cajun Sparkle Copycat Recipe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/i62pds/a_better_cajun_sparkle_maybe/)So here's the housemade recipe - 4 tbsps kosher salt, 4 tsps garlic powder, 3 tsps onion powder, 4 tsps rubbed sage, 3 tsps msg, 3 tsps worcestershire sauce powder, 2.5 tsps Hungarian paprika, 2 tsps tamarind powder, 1 tsps cayenne (for spiciness and taste) plus add 2 tsps Sweet Marjoram (missing herb?).\n\n\\#9: Chai Masala - I prefer this blend as it is warm, sweet and very comforting - 1/2\" fresh ginger,4 whole cloves,1/2 cinnamon stick, 5 green cardamom pods crushed, 1 black cardamom pod split open, 2 teabags of black tea or 5g black looseleaf tea. To make tea, boil 1.5 cups water and spices until boiling over MEDIUM HIGH HEAT. Once it is boiling, remove pot from heat, and let it steep for 5 minutes. Cool slightly. Strain the black tea into warm cups. Add little milk and sugar. Stir and drink it warm. Enjoy!\n\n\\#10: Zaatar - 1 cup or 250 grams - 4 Tbsps Dried Oregano (preferably Turkish or Greek), 4 Tbsps Sumac (one of my favorite spice that is both tangy, lemon sour and pink red in color), 2 Tbsp black sesame seeds, 2 Tbsps white sesame seeds, 2 Tbsps sweet marjoram or marjoram, 2Tbsps dried thyme, 2 tsps fine sea salt optional.  \nMix until well combined and blended into a fine powder.

Cut heads off jalapenos (word of advice only touch the stems if you can and don't touch your face until you've washed your hands several times!) and put in the pot. Garlic cloves go in as well, whole is fine. Add some of your salt/bouillon, garlic, pepper, and paprika to the water but you'll add more later.\n\nBoil all that until jalapenos are fork tender.

KEEP YOUR FACE AWAY FROM THE BLENDER WHEN YOU OPEN THE LID. Trust me on this. Taste test from the blender, add more spices and blend again if necessary. Salt is the most common thing lacking if you think it doesn't taste quite right. \n\nIf it's spicy enough for you, don't add your backup jalapenos. Not spicy enough, add them, add more spices, and blend again. Pour all of it back into your boiling pot and simmer on low once more for 10-15 minutes.

Cut chicken breast in half horizontally, then pound down to fillets about 1/2\" tall. Trim each fillet into a rough circle the size of your bun. (Dry brine for an hour if you want 'em extra tender).\n2. Salt and pepper each side very generously, then place chicken into a Ziploc bag and fill with enough pickle juice to cover them. Remove excess air, seal bag, and place in refrigerator for exactly 1 hour.\n3. Mix breading ingredients together.\n4. After the fillets are done brining, dry each fillet \\_thoroughly\\_, then coat in the breading ingredients first, pressing very hard to ensure compactness, a lack of air bubbles, and a dry surface in every crag of the chicken. Let rest 5-10 minutes so this coating can bond properly; it won't fall off later, taking the breading with it.\n5. Butter each half of both buns. Set aside. Mix milk wash ingredients together.\n6. Drip 3 tablespoons of milk wash through a sieve into the breading bowl, mixing after each spoonful. We're looking for small droplets randomly distributed throughout the breading.\n7. Dredge each fillet in the milk wash, then the breading bowl, pressing very hard on both sides of the chicken fillets to ensure a very tight breading. Set in the refrigerator to help the breading bond - about 20 minutes.\n8. Start heating a wok of peanut oil to 350f (try 325f), using enough oil to cover a chicken breast. It's deep-fry time.\n9. Also start heating a non-stick pan to about 300f. As time permits, begin laying the buns butter-side down on the pan until they are slightly browning, then remove and set aside.\n10. Deep fry each breast, one at a time, until they reach an internal temperature of around 160f. Carryover heating will continue to cook the chicken a bit more (5-10 degrees) to an ideal temperature of 165f as they rest. Ensure oil's temperature is more or less 350f the whole time.\n11. As each fillet is removed from the oil, place it on a rack to drain and top with cheese (if desired), then the bun, then tent with aluminum foil.\n12. Once buns and chicken are both ready, it's time to plate! Bottom bun, then two pickle chips that are close but not touching ('dating, not mating'), then the chicken/cheese/top bun. Top with foil until ready to serve.\n\nEdit: I have (try X) notes in my recipe, sorry for that.

This will infuse the oil with the chili oil. The amount depends on your preference. Also, cooking it longer in the oil brings out more heat. You can throw a basil leaf or two in as well if you want. When it\u2019s cooked for a while, throw in some crushed tomatoes and cook on medium, medium-low for a while to let it combine. Add any Italian seasoning or other herbs you like in your sauce. Salt and pepper as needed. If you used whole chili\u2019s, you can remove them before or after adding tomato\u2019s. You can leave them if you like biting into them, or you can use an immersion blender. \n\nThe basics though, is that you cook chili\u2019s in oil to bring out the heat, then use it to make pasta sauce.

Because you know that if you go to Costco for one thing, you'll come out with 5 more items and $40 bucks, at least, spent.\n\n\nSo skip all that and make them at home! It's easy!!\n\n\nBy the way, stick around til the very end of this post because the nutritional values are listed! And the alternative for whole wheat dinner rolls.\n\n\n\ufffc\n\n\nMakes: 4 & 1/2 dozen dinner rolls\n(If you want to make less, divide the recipe ingredients in half)\n\nBy the way, a scale would be a useful tool here. If you don't have one, here's a hint with conversions:\n8 oz = 1 cup\n16 oz = 1 lb\n1/4 oz = 2.25 teaspoons\n\nIngredients:\nWater\u00a0(110 degrees F): 3/4 cups + 4 cups (separated!)\nSugar: 3/4 teaspoon + 5.5 oz (separated!)\nYeast (dry): 1.12 oz ( or 4 & 1/2 packets)\nAll-Purpose Flour: 3.3 pounds + extra if the dough is too sticky\nMilk, dry: 1.5 oz (or 1 cup of 2% milk)\nSalt: 3/4 teaspoon\nButter: 5.5 oz (or 2 sticks + 1 tablespoon)\nEgg: 1 (for egg wash)\n\nLet's begin.\n\nPour the 3/4 cups of 110 degree water into a small bowl. Sprinkle the yeast and sugar into the bowl and mix just until combined. Set aside and let rest for 10 minutes. Watch for overflow! These little suckers grow quick!\n\nWhile your yeast is eating and burping, divide the 3.3 pounds in half and place one half of the flour into one bowl, one preferably being a bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook, and the other half in another bowl. This recipe will overflow your 4.5 qt electric mixer bowl. I suggest either using a bigger bowl, if you have one, or go the knead-by-hand method.\n(If you don't have one, use a really large bowl where it gives you enough room to knead the dough inside. Don't have a large bowl? Use a clean countertop, pour one of your half of the dough onto the counter, make a well in the middle, and with clean hands, incorporate the ingredients into your dough.)\nIn the bowl of the electric mixture, place the dry milk (or milk) and yeast mixture. Mix on slow with the dough hook attachment. Add the sugar, butter, and 4 cups of water into the electric bowl mixture. Mix on low for a few minutes. Slowly, add the remaining flour. Add additional flour or water, if needed. The dough should be soft, but not sticky. Shape the dough into a ball. Allow to rise for about 1 & 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size.\n\n-You can also decrease your proofing time by making your own proofer out of your home oven. \u00a0The bowl that you place the dough into has to be a stainless steel one or a oven-safe bowl.\n\nHere's how to make an easy yeast bread proofer out of your oven!\nStep 1: Turn oven on to 225 degrees F\nStep 2: Fill an oven-safe container with water and place on the most lower rack.\nStep 3: Rearrange the racks in the oven so that your bowl with the finished dough fits. Do not remove the water out just yet.\nStep 4: Place your oven-safe bowl with dough into the oven.\nStep 5: Close the oven door.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://madepurelyfromscratch.blogspot.com/2011/02/oh-so-yummy-dinner-rolls.html?m=1", "What about the cinnamon bread?

It calls for deli American cheese, which is where you'll get your sodium citrate, and some sharp cheddar.\n\nNow I want a trailer park taco, hillbilly style.", "I don't know if it's exactly like restaurant style, but I make queso dip almost every week\n\nI start by sauteeing minced jalapenos, onions and garlic with a bit of oil\n\nOnce softened, add cream or milk and sodium citrate(emulsifier)\n\nAt this point you can add various things. I like to add a little cumin, cholula hot sauce and herdez avocado sauce\n\nOnce the mixture is hot, add your favorite cheese.  Meunster and Monterey Jack are my favorites.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have measurements, I do it all to taste.  You can make it runnier by adding more cream/milk or thicker by adding more cheese.", "[deleted]", "The base is literally white American cheese with milk.

Then chop up some jalape\u00f1os and you're set.", "I also want this", "I want to know this as well", "I saw this on TikTok and we made it at home and were really happy with it:\n\n1 lb white American cheese (from deli, sliced not shredded)\n1 lb pepperjack (from deli, sliced not shredded)\n2 cans evaporated milk\n1-2 jalape\u00f1os diced\n\nTear the cheese to smaller pieces, toss in crock pot. Add the evaporated milk and diced jalape\u00f1os. Cook until melted, stirring about every 30 minutes. \n\nWe served this for a taco night party at our house and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

You could try subbing salsa and cilantro.", "i do know that mexican restaurant workers always say there is lard in their queso to make it taste the way it does", "if you dont have sodium citrate on hand, in a pinch you can combine lemon/lime juice and baking soda until PH is neutralized (ratio \\~ 50ml to .5-1 tsp). result is sodium citrate solution.", "American cheese works. However, if you want to change the taste, try a different cheese. I live in San Antonio, TX & most of the queso here is Oaxaca cheese. Asadero and/or panela blends work too. Some people top it with cotija. I can take it or leave it. America cheese isn't bad, but blending it with others or just using others entirely will change the whole flavor, consistency, & experience. Using actual cheese, & not a cheese product (like Velveeta) is also something many don't consider. I grew up on Velveeta in a crock pot and just thought that's how it was done. That's until I had a friend's aunt make some crawfish queso once and asked the recipe. I'd never heard of half of the stuff. \n\nFor the other stuff, I hate cilantro. It's the devil's lettuce. No, I'm not wrong. I don't mind jalepeno flavor, but don't like the actual peppers in the queso. Same for onion. Don't put them in the queso. Onion powder works. Also try a bit of paprika, & cayenne pepper. Not too much. You don't want it to taste like cayenne, just a hint of heat. Tomatoes, meat (brisket, pulled pork, piccadillo, etc.) is good too. Just make sure the meat is drained well so the queso isn't too greasy. I've heard some people use evaporated or condensed milk. Not saying it won't work, but whole milk or heavy cream can work too. I've also heard of people using broth too. I refrain from any extra salt as the chips (or whatever you dip them in) will have enough."]}

{"title": "Famous Amos Cookies", "selftext": "Im on a quest to re-create this little iconic cookie recipe... I used to go to the Sunset Blvd store in LA in the 1970's and buy a bag of these and eat the entire bag.  Ive tried dozens of knock off recipes but none come close.\n\nI asked the ladies who worked there at the time for the recipe, and they just looked at me. I emailed Wally and he said nope. I did read an article on the recipe from the LA Times and they said the key is to refrigerate the dough for at least 48 hrs, and that its very basic, no fancy add-ins, they were mass prodcued at the time. The recipe is very basic, my guess is five ingredients...\n\nIve tried a few recipes and they are close, but the key is either they used BUTTER or CRISCO (vegetable oil) ... My guess is Crisco in the original recipe to get the crunch.\n\nFamous Amos cookies were basic, not fancy at all, and were in their hay day with Mrs Fields cookies.... They are crunchier and smaller but still had the flavor the larger Mrs Fields cookies had... They were almost the same recipe as MrsFields, but just smaller making them crunchy withOUT the soft center as Mr Fields basic cookie... FAmos also had larger cookies IN the store, that were not as popular and they tasted exactly like Mrs Fields.\n\nActually the closet thing that comes close is Nestle Tollhouse cookies, but not quite...Add some pecans to that dough and its kinda close.\n\nAnyone had any luck with a recipe that recreates this little iconic cookie?

{"title": "McDonald's Hamburger", "selftext": "I found this on the web years ago.  These are the real deal, they come out perfect.  Make sure you read everything before you start, its worth the effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE REGULAR HAMBURGER\n\nThe McDonald's\u00ae regular hamburger is the one that got it all started in 1948. It's as basic as can be...yet the ones they serve today don't even taste CLOSE! Make em exactly as I instruct, and you can enjoy that long-lost flavor once again. (In the mid 80's, McDonald's\u00ae began cooking both sides of the meat at the same time, This was to cut cooking time in half. But it also forever changed the flavor of the original hamburgers---ALL of them!) \n\nRay Kroc discovered the McDonald brother's San Bernardino, Cal. restaurant in 1954 while selling mutli-mixers. (shake machines) He was so impressed with their methods, he struck up a franchise deal, and in 1955 opened his first store in De Plaines Illinois. Oh, and he went on to earn multi-millions.\n\n(FYI.... In 1952, two years BEFORE Ray Kroc stumbled upon McDonald's, Burger King's founder Keith Cramer got his idea for a burger \"joint\" after visiting with the legendary McDonald bros.) For a more detailed history, visit the McDonald's\u00ae Story page.\n\n\"Ten Regs please\"...\"Ten Regs, thank you\"\n\n(An old production call for ten burgers)\n\n**McDonalds\u00ae regular Hamburger ingredients:**\n\n1 -Pound ground chuck (80% lean)\n\n10 -Small hamburger buns (cheap ones)\n\n10 -Hamburger dill slices\n\n10 -teaspoons dried, chopped onion\n\nMcDonald's\u00ae Hamburger Seasoning\n\nMustard, Ketchup ....and ..... waxed paper\n\n\\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**The Hamburger Seasoning:**\n\n4 Tablespoons salt\n\n2 Tablespoons Accent (msg)\n\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper \n\n1/4 teaspoon onion powder\n\nMix all ingredients well in a spice shaker with big enough holes to allow pepper to flow. Makes about 3 ounces. Use on ALL McDonald's hamburgers. (unless you're allergic to msg, then just use salt and pepper.)\n\n\\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**The Beef Patties:**\n\nDivide 1 lb of beef into 10 equal sized balls. Form a patty out of each ball about 4 inches in diameter and 1/4 inch thick. Do this on waxed paper. *I use a tortilla press with the meat between 2 pieces of plastic wrap.* \n\n Now freeze the patties for at least an hour. (this keeps them from falling apart when you grill 'em) Obviously you'll do this in advance of \"burger time\". It is pretty tough to make patties this small, so if you come up with 9 patties, I'll forgive you.\n\n**The Onions:**\n\nPut the dried onions in a container, oh..like Tupperware...and add water. Water should be a few inches over the top of the onions. (better to have too much water than not enough) Cover, and refrigerate about 1/2 hour. Drain the liquid, and BAM...you have McDonald's little baby onions. Cover again and refrigerate until 'burger time\".\n\n**The Pickles:**\n\nMcDonald's\u00ae pickle slices are unique in flavor, very sour dills. The only product I know of that comes close to the distinctive flavor is HEINZ Genuine Dills. (original sour dill.) But they don't come in slices, so slice your own VERY thin. I can't do it very well with a knife, so I use a K-tel \"dial-a-slice\" home vegetable slicer. ALSO....Vlasic \"original\" dills have that tart flavor. **Make sure they're not \"kosher\" dills.** Wal-Mart\u00ae carries Vlasic ORIGINAL dills, and you have to slice those too. (\\*\\*\\*\\*note, these pickles are pretty small, so slice at an angle....you'll get bigger dill chips.) USE THESE PICKLES ON ALL McDONALD'S\u00ae HAMBURGERS!\n\n**The Buns:**\n\nUse the small, plain cheapo store brand hamburger buns. You know, they come 8 or 12 in a pack. Usually about 59 to 69 cents for a pack of 8. (You'll want to separate the tops, or \"crowns\" from the bottoms, or \"heels\"...as most likely they'll be connected slightly on one edge.) When it's \"burger time\", you'll be toasting the buns. Those instructions are coming up. WalMart\u00ae sells a great product for regular buns---Great Value\u2122 brand \"jumbo\" hamburger buns. They're almost exactly like McDonald's\u00ae buns and a little bigger than the other hamburger buns available at your supermarket.\n\nONE MORE THING: Before you cook these marvelous hamburgers, pre-cut 10 12\"x12\" sheets of waxed paper. You'll need them to wrap the burgers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cooking your Hamburgers!**\n\nPre-heat your oven to warm..its lowest level, this is for later. You're going to need two electric griddles . *I used the stove.*\n\nOne to grill the meat, the other to toast the buns. Pre-heat the meat griddle to 375-400\u00b0, and the bun griddle to about 350\u00b0. (this recipe has you cooking four at a time)\n\n\\*\\*\\*note\\*\\*\\*before starting, make sure to have all of your condiments READY! (because this all happens very fast)\n\n\\#1 -Toast the crowns of 4 buns (tops) Do this by laying them face down on the griddle closely together. Put\n\na dutch oven (pot) bottom side down directly on top of the buns.(open side facing up) This is only to apply hands-free pressure to the buns so they will toast evenly. (Don't use anything TOO heavy like cast iron. You'll smash the buns.)\n\n\\#2 -Lay the frozen patties on the other grill. After about 20 seconds, \"sear\" them by applying even pressure with the back of a metal spatula, and pushing down on the front with your free hand. (careful not to burn your fingers.) Do this only for about 2 seconds...you should hear them sizzle louder while you \"sear\" them. After searing them, sprinkle generously with McDonald's burger seasoning.\n\n\\#3 -At this point, your buns are nearly done. They will have an even tan color when finished. Remove them, and repeat the the \"bun toasting\" process with the heels. (bottoms)\n\n\\#4 -After about one minute since searing the patties, turn them over. Careful, don't tear the side you seared. Add another dash of Seasoning and about a teaspoon of your prepared onions. (Don't be anal and use a measuring spoon...no time...just two fingers and a thumb full.)\n\n\\#5 -Now quickly dress your buns. (crown, or top side) Mustard first....five \"kisses\" the diameter of a pencil evenly spaced in a circle about a half inch from the edge. Then the Ketchup, (use Hunt's if you can) five squirts the size of a nickle..in the pattern found on dice. Place the pickle in the middle.\n\n\\#6 -By the time you finish that, the meat will be done. (about 1 minute or 1:10 after turning) Remove the meat and tilt to the side to allow excess fat to drain off. Use your free hand to hold down the onions. Place patties onion side up on the dressed crown, top with toasted heels. (the burger will be upside-down)\n\n\\#7 -Lay one finished hamburger, still upside-down, in the center of your pre-cut waxed paper. Wrap the paper around the burger tightly. It should resemble a very oblong tube with two open ends, and the burger in the middle. Then wrap the open ends underneath the bottom of the burger so it is enclosed tightly.\n\n\\#8 -Place wrapped hamburger in your pre-heated oven. (remember...oven is just barely on warm) Keep 'em in there about 8-10 minutes.\\*\\*\\*\\* Hey! That's enough time to cook another batch. (if you do cook another batch while these are \"aging properly\", scrape the black stuff and burnt onions to the side before beginning.)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*PLEASE NOTE! Some ovens get too hot even on low, and this may dry out your burger. If they seem dry, next time wrap them tightly and let them sit about 5 minutes. Then ZAP 'em for 15 seconds (one at a time) in the microwave. This will complete the \"Q-ing\" process without over microwaving them like they do now. In fact, they almost taste better this way.\n\n\\#9 -ENJOY!! This is how they used to be. This is how they were MEANT to be. (You might consider toasting your buns first, at least the crowns, to give you extra time to dress them.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dfsbvk/mcdonalds_hamburger/", "created_utc": 1570678827.0, "score": 105, "author": "target022", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/dfsbvk/mcdonalds_hamburger/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I remember taking a tour of a McDonald\u2019s.

Maybe buy some kind of tikka sauce, but if you want to make it, tikka sauce is pretty straightforward- ghee, onion/garlic/ginger, tomatoes, cashews, a mix of spices including garam masala, coriander, and red chili powder, fenugreek, and some very mild sweetener. I recommend Spice Cravings\u2019 recipe for this. \n\nThe raita crema always threw me off, but judging by the picture it just looks like a yogurty cream that you can adapt to your tastes based off a normal raita recipe. It usually has mint, cucumber, coriander, lime, ginger, and garam masala, although you can mess with these proportions as well to find something suitable. You may also want to add something like creme fraiche to make it thicker and more like a cream you can actually drizzle over the taco like they do at VT. The issue here is that it probably won\u2019t be exactly like the taco at VT, but it\u2019ll still be really good and more to your tastes as we can\u2019t be sure which raita/tikka recipe they\u2019re using. \n\nFinally, judging by the pictures online, it does look like Thai basil is just the garnish on top; it looks like the tomato chutney and tikka masala form the base, then they\u2019re layered with the paneer, and then a little more of the chutney and the creme and basil on top. It\u2019s going to require a bit of experimentation, probably, and it\u2019s been AGES since I\u2019ve had it myself (though my craving kicked in hard about a couple weeks ago), so let us know how it turns out if you try it!

{"title": "Taco Bueno Chili Sauce In-Depth Analysis and Hypothesis", "selftext": "I made a few posts across the webs this week about Taco Bueno's secret sauce, one of them was on this sub, and I didn't move the needle much so I decided to investigate. This is what I've come up with in preparation to start attempting recreating this sauce.\n\nFirst, I went to my local 'Bueno right when it opened so that nobody would be in line and I could strike up a conversation with the person at the window (delightful lady btw). She says tons of people ask about the sauce, and she gave me a container of it by itself (not sure if she was being nice or if that's something you can actually order) and she started to say something about \"it's called chili... cheese... something?\" but stopped herself quickly. That might be the name of the sauce on the jugs they get . She told me a few other pieces of info, but we'll get back to that in a moment.\n\nI get back to the house. My wife and I both carefully taste the sauce. I mean carefully... We ran it through multiple taste tests. By itself, on a burrito, Eyes closed, eyes open, after a drink of water, after a saltine, it was comical how hard analyzed the stuff. Anyways, we made some important observations.\n\nIf you've never seen this stuff by itself before, It has a very smooth glossy look and is actually quite orange. That may be why the word \"cheese\" is in the official title, but I seriously doubt there's cheese in it based on the flavor. There's also tiny pieces of meat in it. I think the orange color comes from an insanely high amount of fat content (and some of the spices are orange after frying), and the word \"cheese\" in the name is to disguise the fact that it contains a LOT of fat, thus the wonderfully addictive flavor. It does not have the consistency, flavor, smell, or any other indicator that there is even a tiny bit of cheese in it. Also, the orange color is more concentrated at the top of the liquid, and if anyone has seen a liquid with a lot of not-perfectly-suspended fat in it that's been sitting a while, the fat concentrates at the top.\n\nI then started disassembling my items. A combo burrito and a taco/nacho salad of some kind. Both had a good amount of ground beef crumbles in them. I call them ground beef crumbles because they are very tiny and actually fairly dry. The meat crumbles were delicious and the other ingredients prevent the overall product from seeming dry, but I started putting two and two together. The highly seasoned and tasty flavor of the meat was similar to the flavor of the sauce, also the meat pieces as an ingredient and the pieces in the sauce were the same sizes.\n\nBack to what the delightful window lady said previously. She indicated that the meat comes packaged and pre-cooked. They throw it in a pan or something and heat it up. Makes sense. The dry crumbliness of the ground beef could easily be the product of a \"twice fried\" system, if you will. So here's what I think is going on:\n\nBack at the initial food processing place, they are cooking up big ass vats of very finely ground beef, adding lots of tasty spices (basically \"taco\" seasonings), until browned, and all the fat is rendered out. They drain the fat from the meat very well, and save it. This wonderfully meat and spice-seasoned fat is the base of the chili sauce. They package up probably 90% of the meat, freeze it and send it to the stores. The other 10% goes back into the sauce AFTER this next step. I believe they are making a slurry of beef broth and corn starch (or whatever the cheapest type of starch is that they can buy in massive quantities) and adding it to the rendered meat fat. My guess is that it's a 50/50 ratio, but I'll be testing it. At this point, I think they are using some kind of bad ass industrial immersion blender to suspend the fat in the slurry to sort of homogenize the mixture and thicken it slightly. They might add additional spices at some point, but maybe not due to how incredibly seasoned the beef by itself is. This is something else I'll be testing. Then they add back that 10%, or whatever % held back meat was, back into the sauce.\n\nThe product is a very glossy, very flavorful, slightly thickened and extremely satisfying (like most things that contain a lot of fat) sauce.\n\nThe reason I don't think this is too far off is because the ground beef at 'Bueno, while not overly dry, is dry enough to make you wonder where the fat went. Successful fast food places use every part of every ingredient, and I don't think they are using super lean meat. That fat has to go somewhere (side note, I think that fat is also added to their beans).\n\nI still have to test this, but in summary, I believe the reason that none of the copycat recipes have nailed this flavor anomaly is because none of them contain like 50% beef fat. I think that's why it's so damn addictive and why it's so difficult to replicate.\n\nI'll update y'all with my findings as I test kitchen this over the next day or two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdding images as per requested.\n\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/nYIDEsw \n\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/0P1sQZJ \n\n   \nhttps://imgur.com/GSheBH5 ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/uo62ok/taco_bueno_chili_sauce_indepth_analysis_and/", "created_utc": 1652375810.0, "score": 96, "author": "None", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/uo62ok/taco_bueno_chili_sauce_indepth_analysis_and/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["This level of dedication to a sauce is admirable.", "i have never seen this sauce, i wish you had given us some pictures because i'm curious of it's consistency.  i want to point out some odd behaviour.\n\nboil chicken bones.  you get out collagen, and some fat.  when it cools, you will have gelatin, and then a layer of fat on top.  BUT, if you keep boiling it, to reduce the water from the gelatin, the fat can mix in.  so later, you will have the fat homogenous in the gelatin, protein rich layer.  \n\nis that's what is called a demigloss?\n\nif they made a taco beef demigloss, that could be too expensive.  MAYBE they are able to add a little corn starch, or masa like you are thinking to help thicken it with the added water, and still make it stable with all the added fat.\n\nyou could always try this in 3 stages:\n\n1. come up with what proportions you need to make a demi glaze with just gelatin and lard (maybe butter so it can be controlled).  also note the texture here.\n2. use the same ratios to start, but try to add more water, and add corn meal or corn starch, and see if it can still be a homogenous demi glaze.  see if this helped the texture at all.\n3. now add a little ground beef and taco season to #2 for flavor, and see if you can JUUUUUUUUST get to a ball park of flavor, color, texture of the taco bueno sauce.  taco seasoning should really help the color.  maybe cook the meat and taco seasoning in the butter first to get the color in there.", "So, I\u2019ve never had this specific sauce, but I may possibly have some helpful cooking tips.\n\nFor years now, I\u2019ve been making a slightly modified version of the \u201cConey Sauce\u201d that Chef John makes on his YouTube channel Foodwishes. You find it here: [Coney Sauce](https://youtu.be/4aDZ0yT5agM)\n\nI\u2019d been wanting to make a hot dog chili for a while, but didn\u2019t know how to get that fine consistency. Turns out, you don\u2019t pre-cook the ground beef. You throw the meat, water, and all other ingredients in a pot, and take a potato masher to it, till you get that fine consistency. I\u2019d say it\u2019s similar to what you have here. When it sits and cools, it also has the bright orange fat you describe.\n\nThis hotdog chili is more meaty and yours is more sauces. That\u2019s just a matter of ratios, though. For instance, I\u2019ve found that the more water you add, the easier and faster it is to get this consistency. The downside is that you have to cook out the water much longer to get the consistency I want in a hotdog chili. Loose, but not runny.\n\nI tend to take it off the heat, very loose, because as it cools, it gets thicker. When you refrigerate it, it gets an orange fat layer as you describe. This is with 80/20 beef. It also gets almost \u201cdry\u201d in the fridge. If you microwave it, it loosens right back up. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s required as the spices seem to \u201csink\u201d when the sauce sets up. I make it with a nice spice level. If you let it sit in the fridge and just scoop out some to reheat, it\u2019s mild on top and really hot at the bottom. I either have to mix it well when it\u2019s first cooked and store it in smaller containers, or heat the whole batch and stir whenever I want some.\n\nI know the flavor would probably be different, but if you went with less meat, more liquid, and upped the spice levels, it might get you close. \n\nI suggest increasing the spice levels, because you want yours a lot more liquid than meat. That means more flavorless water. You\u2019ll need to increase spice amounts to have the correct concentration and so you\u2019re not diluting it with extra liquid.\n\nI hope some of this helps. If it does; let me know how any test batches go.\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "I literally just looked through my notifications to find your name and tag you on this post because i remembered you were looking for it.

They also use Guittard's Au Lait White Chocolate chips on their black and white.  \nAfter mixing the cookie dough and folding the chips and nuts, it is advisable to fold in the ingredients until it is evenly distributed into the cookie dough. Then scoop out either 3.5 oz or beige scoop (standard cookie size in 1990s to 2014), then reduced to 2 oz (standard blue scoop). Scoop them onto a parchment paper lined container in a single layer. Then put another layer of cardboard & parchment paper, add another single layer of cookies. Cover with plastic film and let it refrigerate and rest the cookies overnight to 24 hours.\n\nNext day, preheat oven to 350F (conventional) or 325F (convection). Place the cookies 1.5\" to 2\" apart from each other on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake cookies for 14 to 15 minutes or until edges are golden brown but soft on centers.\n\nAs for black and whites, preheat oven to oven's instructions from the recipe. But cook for 12- 13 minutes to avoid chocolate from burning.\n\nWe remove the cookies from the oven, and let it cool on the baking sheets for 5 to 10 minutes to avoid breaking the cookies. People go crazy when our cookies came straight from the oven. We advise them to wait at the alloted time. Then cookies are packed in a slanted to vertical position in boxes. If it were packaged flat, they would crumble.\n\nThey also used Gold Medal Blue Label for all of their cookies.\n\n+++++\n\nPanera's Kitchen Sink Cookies - [https://www.designeatrepeat.com/kitchen-sink-cookies/](https://www.designeatrepeat.com/kitchen-sink-cookies/)\n\n+++++\n\nLevain Bakery's Double Chocolate Peanut Butter Chips - [https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-dark-chocolate-peanut-butter-chip-cookies/](https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-dark-chocolate-peanut-butter-chip-cookies/)\n\nLevain Bakery's Chocolate Chip Walnut - [https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/](https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/)\n\n+++++\n\nBlack and White cookie from NYC - [https://www.food.com/recipe/new-york-city-black-and-white-cookies-180805](https://www.food.com/recipe/new-york-city-black-and-white-cookies-180805)\n\n+++++\n\nCrumbl Cookies:\n\nPink Sugar Cookie - [https://cookingwithkarli.com/crumbl-sugar-cookies/](https://cookingwithkarli.com/crumbl-sugar-cookies/)\n\nMaster document of all retired cookie flavors from Crumbl Cookies - [https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumblCookies/comments/yl6mvf/official\\_crumbl\\_copycat\\_masterdoc\\_2022/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumblCookies/comments/yl6mvf/official_crumbl_copycat_masterdoc_2022/)\n\nFollow this link and click on them to make your favorite to suit your cravings.\n\nCornbread cookie - [https://www.friedalovesbread.com/2021/03/crumbl-cornbread-cookie-copycat.html?m=1](https://www.friedalovesbread.com/2021/03/crumbl-cornbread-cookie-copycat.html?m=1)\n\n+++++\n\nThe Original Cookie Company's Butter cookie recipe - [https://www.copykatchat.com/forum/recipes/recipe-requests/29824-looking-for-original-cookie-co-butter-cookie-recipe](https://www.copykatchat.com/forum/recipes/recipe-requests/29824-looking-for-original-cookie-co-butter-cookie-recipe)\n\n+++++\n\nCorner Bakery & Cafe Oatmeal Cookies - [https://www.food.com/recipe/oatmeal-cookies-from-the-corner-bakery-cafe-421697](https://www.food.com/recipe/oatmeal-cookies-from-the-corner-bakery-cafe-421697)\n\n+++++\n\nMrs. Field's Cookie base recipe - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Old\\_Recipes/comments/14ozc2p/mrs\\_fields\\_cookies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/14ozc2p/mrs_fields_cookies/)\n\n+++++\n\nNeiman Marcus chocolate chip cookies - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Old\\_Recipes/comments/zh0vt9/the\\_neiman\\_marcus\\_cookie\\_recipe\\_chain\\_letter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Old_Recipes/comments/zh0vt9/the_neiman_marcus_cookie_recipe_chain_letter/)\n\n++++\n\nDouble Tree Chocolate Chip cookies - [https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/g18upe/doubletree\\_signature\\_chocolate\\_chip\\_cookies\\_recipe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/easyrecipes/comments/g18upe/doubletree_signature_chocolate_chip_cookies_recipe/)\n\n+++++\n\nReddit's Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe posted from r/FoodPorn - [https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/7k84bc/its\\_taken\\_a\\_ton\\_of\\_testing\\_to\\_get\\_here\\_but\\_these/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/7k84bc/its_taken_a_ton_of_testing_to_get_here_but_these/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n++++\n\nReddit's Best Gooeist Brownie Recipe posted from r/Baking - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1714o53/yesterday\\_i\\_asked\\_for\\_gooey\\_brownie\\_recipes\\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1714o53/yesterday_i_asked_for_gooey_brownie_recipes_today/)\n\n++++\n\nTate's Bakeshop thin chocolate chip cookies - [https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/cooking-tips/article/tate-s-cookie-recipe-taste-test](https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/cooking-tips/article/tate-s-cookie-recipe-taste-test)\n\nThey also use Gold Medal Blue label ap flour for making their cookies.

I went to visit a friend because she was going to graduate school here. Then stopped by at their farmer's market. I saw great produce and food vendors here. They bought several pastries from Eclair and Scout's Coffee Company. I got one of their peach tarts, cream puff and an eclair from Eclair. Then tried their pistachio shortbread from Scout's Coffee Company. OMG! the shortbread was so good and very flavorful. Very rich, buttery and a very nice complement to the pistachios (so fresh and nutty).

It featured Tom Roach's cookies and other baked goods. The cookies were to die for but there was always a discount like Buy 3 get 1 free. I could only afford this as at that time was interviewing and looking for jobs at that time. I found several graphic design gigs at that time, and worked in the city.

By hand, stir in the melted chocolate mixture until thoroughly combined, then add the dry ingredients, chopped walnuts and the remaining chocolate chips.

Being at Disney probably helps, but the main reason is the oil.  It's called Pop-N-Lite but there's nothing light about it. It's a dark orange color and is made with canola, coconut, and corn oil.  It's also the only thing about it that hasn't changed in a decade.  \n  \nOver the years they've made changes that have affected overall quality IMO, so I purposefully chose the best ingredients we've used in the past ten years in order to get the best taste possible.

(You could previously pop a white batch if you forgot oil, but with PS it burns the hulls and makes them unpopable).

Corona native here. I grew up eating Miguel\u2019s Jr since I was a kid. Ate their burritos everyday in Jr High and HS where they provided food to Citrus Hills and Santiago. I\u2019m very familiar with their food and red sauce. My brother had made a decent recreation some years back and I\u2019ve always wanted to do it myself. So this last year I\u2019ve made quite a few attempts at recreating their salsa. I have a feeling that it\u2019s much simpler than my first couple of tries. Today I came up with something that is very close.\n\nI\u2019ll put the recipe and process at the bottom but some things I want to note here first:\n\nThe consistency of Miguel\u2019s red sauce is very runny compared to other restaurants. That\u2019s not a bad thing, it\u2019s delicious. But it\u2019s counter intuitive while recreating the sauce. Less is truly more here. The best part about Miguel\u2019s sauce is that it doesn\u2019t push too far into any one flavor profile. Not too spicy, not too acidic, not too salty, not too tomatoey. And I believe that\u2019s achieved by watering down the salsa at the end and adding enough salt/msg to compensate. Their sauce also doesn\u2019t coagulate or thicken in the fridge later, which makes me believe most of the liquid is not derived from the tomatoes, which have a ton of pectin in them, but from water. And I believe the tomatoes slight acidity is used to balance the chiles not the use of vinegar or citrus. Also, I believe the majority of the chile flavor is coming from the California and guajillos. The Chile pequin and arbols are the ones bringing the heat. But I\u2019m sure any combination of these would be fine. If you only have California and arbols, don\u2019t feel like you need to go out and get the others.\n\nFeel free to comment, correct or add suggestions. I don\u2019t really measure anything in the kitchen. I eyeballed the salt, msg and oregano until it was seasoned to my liking so just use your best judgment. I also feel like I could\u2019ve watered down my salsa just a skosh more.\n\n1/2 white onion\n\n4-5 large garlic cloves\n\n3-4 Roma tomatoes\n\n7 chile California\n\n5 chile guajillo\n\n10 chile pequin\n\n4 chile de arbol\n\n3-4 cups of water\n\n1-2 tablespoons Mexican oregano to taste\n\nKosher salt to taste (I did roughly 6-7 teaspoons. Use much less salt if using iodized table salt or finer salts like sea salt. everyone\u2019s different. Do what tastes good to you. )\n\n1 tsp MSG (optional. but adds the same umami that chicken bouillon adds, that other Mexican salsa recipes call for, but without the chicken flavor. Definitely helps)\n\nPut onion, garlic and tomatoes into a hot skillet and blacken them. Add the larger chiles and toast them. Once toasted, add the smaller chiles and toast them. Once toasted, cover with approx 3-4 cups of water. Bring to a boil. Put lid on skillet, turn heat off and let the chiles hydrate for 20 min. Strain and reserve liquid. Add everything to blender or separate container for immersion blender. Add oregano, salt, msg and half of the liquid. Blend until smooth. Continue adding the reserved liquid until desired consistency is achieved. You can even add filtered water until you get the right consistency and just add more salt to keep it from going bland.", "I visiting Corona from sacramento and enjoying this thread so much!", "No kidding!

Many mock Chick-fil-A recipes swear by the pickle juice... others claim it's bunk. So, to test, I did a first, smaller batch without the pickle juice. They were still good - but missing something.

One thing to note about the milk wash though, the actual thing comes as a powdered milk and egg wash. The chicken comes frozen to the stores and we just thaw it. The nuggets and fillets have some seasoning (just like some salt and pepper, nothing interesting like pickle juice) and the strips have liquid smoke added. To bread the chicken it\u2019s not dredged like other fried chicken places, you dip it in the milk/eggwash once and it goes straight to the coater. For the nuggets specifically there\u2019s like a wire basket in the pan of milk wash, you dump the whole bag of nuggets (or however much you\u2019re making at once), break it up with your fingers so all the chicken gets wet, lift up the basket and shake the excess milk wash off, then just dump it all in the coater. For the fillets, you need to dip in the milk wash, place in the coater, cover the top and press down on the chicken, flip and repeat twice. For the fryer, nuggets and regular fillets get pressure cooked, but it honestly makes almost no difference. I suggest trying to get the oil to about 355-360 degrees.

Once you have an emulsion, add a little bitter orange (or lime + yuzu works in a pinch) and blend. Then add a couple of Jalape\u00f1os and blend. Then add half of a small onion and blend.

I'll bet they balance the flavor more toward coconut than macadamia, since the latter is pretty aggressive. If you wanted to DIY it, you're making a simple or rich syrup, which is just sugar and water. A simple syrup is equal proportions of sugar and water, and you can go up to 2 parts sugar to 1 part water (based on the nutrition info, it looks like Torini is about 1.5:1). You combine them and heat until the sugar dissolves; I make mine in the microwave. For the coconut, steep purchased coconut flakes in the syrup for ~24 hours to infuse the flavor, then strain. For macadamia, I'd say look for an [orgeat recipe](https://www.liquor.com/articles/how-to-make-orgeat-syrup/), subbing the type of nuts.

I really enjoy the texture of the cracker meal coating at Moby Dick and I'll always love Mike Linnig's out off Cane Run Rd.  But those are personal opinions.\n\nBeer batter is where it's at. The real secret of deep frying is only partially the batter. The quality of the oil, the amount and type of oil, and the temperature control is where the really quality comes through. We used to have a Fry Daddy type device from any store, but now we use a large enameled Dutch oven along with an induction burner to heat the oil. Use a good electronic thermometer to measure your temperature and this makes the process very controlled. I also like using a spider strainer for handling fish and such in the oil, pick one up at an Asian market or possibly The Dine Company out off Preston.  When we fry, we do it outside to minimize the oil spray and the smell in the house. It's a lot safer too! \n\nThis recipe is a basic one from Alton Brown's Good Eats.

Heat remaining \u00bc cup oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Arrange 6 tacos in skillet with open sides facing away from you. Cook, adjusting heat so oil actively sizzles and bubbles appear around edges of tacos, until tacos are crispy and deeply browned on 1 side, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs and thin spatula, carefully flip tacos. Cook until deeply browned on second side, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary.\n\n6.

I looked at a few recipes and couldn't find one that stood out. \n\nAs for the Baconator sauce, again from [FFN.org](https://fastfoodnutrition.org/wendys/breakfast-baconator):\n\n> Water, Neufchatel Cheese (Milk, Cream, Cheese Culture, Salt, Carob Bean Gum), Cream, Milk, Seasoning (Corn Starch, Whey Protein Concentrate, Sea Salt, Sodium Citrate, Soy Lecithin, Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Garlic Powder, Spice, Onion Powder), Swiss Cheese (Pasteurized Part-Skim Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Cheddar Cheese (Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Cultures, Enzymes), Butter (Cultured Cream, Salt), Sour Cream (Cultured Cream, Enzymes), Natural Flavor, Egg Yolks, Lemon Juice Concentrate, Fruit Juice (Color).\n\nThat's got so many parentheticals that I'll pare it down:\n\n> Water, Neufchatel Cheese, Cream, Milk, Seasoning, Swiss Cheese, Cheddar Cheese, Butter, Sour Cream, Natural Flavor, Egg Yolks, Lemon Juice Concentrate\n\nFrankly, I've never seen a cheese sauce that looked like that. I left out the \"seasoning\" ingredients, but I think it's not just seasoning, but what binds it together into sauce - you have corn starch, sodium citrate, and xanthan gum, all of which are used to hold together sauces. There's a couple routes you could go. You could make a cheese sauce with a roux (butter and flour cooked together); check [this recipe](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/creamy-cheese-sauce/) for an example. Then there's a sauce made with sodium citrate, which uses an emulsifying salt to keep the fats and liquids bound together. Here's an [example recipe](https://twoguysandacooler.com/making-an-incredibly-simple-nacho-cheddar-sauce/). Now obviously, you'd be substituting the cheeses from the Wendy's sauce for those in the recipes; I think cream cheese would be sufficient for tang, you wouldn't need both that and sour cream. Not sure why they use both Swiss and cheddar, but there must be a reason.", "Their breakfast potatoes are delicious!  They\u2019re so crispy, too.

{"title": "Trader Joe's Chantilly Cream Vanilla Bean Mini Sheet Cake ", "selftext": "Hey all! Yesterday I had this insane craving for Trader Joe's Chantilly Cream Vanilla Bean Mini Sheet Cake, but I was sooo not driving 45 mins to my nearest store. I'm also not a professional baker by any means, so there was no way I was attempting to recreate this cake on my own. I tried to search the web and here on reddit for any recipes (shoutout to the person in\u00a0the Baking subreddit\u00a0who tried to recreate the cake 2 years back!) but eventually (and maybe definitely controversially) decided to use a bit of AI to my aid. I sent a picture of the back ingredient and nutrition labels of the TJ's cake to ChatGPT and asked it to help me recreate a recipe for the original cake. The outputted recipe looked suspiciously good, so I had to try it.\n\nTo my immense surprise, the result was scary similar to the real thing! Maybe not 100% exact, but for someone who's as obsessed with this cake as I am, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.\u00a0*Super*\u00a0moist, great crumb, and really buttery and flavorful. If anything, it's a great starting place for an even better attempt at recreating this cake! I'd love to hear your thoughts and any tweaks you all might have to make this copycat recipe even closer to the original. Feel free to share your results and suggestions\u2014I'm so curious and maybe a bit too passionate about this cake lol.\n\nHere's the recipe along with some notes from my bake:\n\n***Trader Joe\u2019s Chantilly Cream Vanilla Bean Mini Sheet Cake Copycat Recipe***\n\n*Cake Ingredients:*\n\n* *1 cup (200g) cane sugar*\n* *2 cups (240g) unbleached enriched flour*\n* *1 tbsp malted barley flour (optional)*\n* *1 1/2 tsp baking powder*\n* *1/2 tsp baking soda*\n* *1/4 tsp salt*\n* *1/2 cup (120ml) canola oil*\n* *1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream*\n* *1/2 cup (120ml) milk*\n* *3 large eggs*\n* *1 cup (240ml) buttermilk*\n* *1 tsp clear vanilla extract*\n* *2-3 tsp vanilla bean paste*\n\n*Frosting Ingredients:*\n\n* *2 cups (240g) powdered sugar*\n* *1 tbsp cornstarch*\n* *1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened*\n* *8 oz (225g) cream cheese, softened*\n* *1 tsp clear vanilla extract*\n* *2-3 tsp vanilla bean paste*\n\n*Instructions:*\n\n1. *Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch rectangular cake pan.*\n2. *In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, malted barley flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.*\n3. *In the bowl of your stand mixer, add the sugar, canola oil, and heavy cream. Using the paddle attachment, beat on medium speed until well combined and creamy.*\n4. *Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and vanilla bean paste, and mix until combined.*\n5. *With the mixer on low speed, alternate adding the dry ingredients and the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined.*\n6. *Slowly add the milk and mix on low speed until the batter is smooth.*\n7. *Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack until completely cool.*\n8. *In the bowl of your stand mixer, combine the softened butter and cream cheese. Beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy.*\n9. *Add the powdered sugar and cornstarch. Mix on low speed using the paddle attachment until combined.*\n10. *Add the vanilla extract and vanilla bean paste, and mix until well combined.*\n11. *Once the cake is completely cool, spread the frosting evenly over the top of the cake using a spatula.*\n12. *Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the frosting to set.*\n\n*Notes:*\n\n* *I didn't feel like buying malted barley flour just to use a singular tablespoon. Instead, I substituted that with a tablespoon of cornmeal out of curiosity, as I and others have noted how the original TJ\u2019s cake sort of resembles cornbread. I\u2019m not sure if the cornmeal made a noticeable difference, but I didn\u2019t hate it*\n* *The cake batter itself was quite thin, which had me scared, but it turned out fine imo*\n* *I truly think that the vanilla bean paste is what made this cake so yummy. ChatGPT originally called for 1 vanilla bean each in the cake batter and the frosting, but I didn't feel like splurging and instead just googled the conversion for vanilla bean paste*\n* *I added a bit of whipping cream to the frosting out of curiosity, which sort of messed up the consistency. I had to end up adding a lot more powdered sugar, so the frosting was quite sweet and not quite as buttery as TJ\u2019s. So, probably don\u2019t add the whipping cream like I did lol*\n\nBesides that, I\u2019m so impressed with how this cake turned out! I wasn\u2019t expecting the final product to be anything near the original, so kudos to ChatGPT. I hope this helps anyone who\u2019s as obsessed with this cake as I am!

Sorry, I\u2019m on mobile and wasn\u2019t sure how to link the original post.\n\n\n\nBenihana Hibachi Onion Soup - THE CORRECT RECIPE!\n\nThere are TONS of recipes online for Benihana\u2019s famous hibachi onion soup. Some of them are decent. Others are just wrong. But none of them are correct. UNTIL NOW!\n\nToday, for the very first time on the internet, I\u2019m going to share with you the EXACT recipe used at Benihana Japanese steakhouse to make their delicious soup! I\u2019m going to share with you the 3 SECRET INGREDIENTS that are missing from every recipe on the internet!\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t want to track down the special ingredients used at Benihana restaurants, I\u2019m going to show you how you can recreate the soup using ingredients you\u2019ll find at ANY grocery store!\n\nI\u2019ll also address the two main complaints I\u2019ve seen from people attempting to make this soup at home.\n\nHere is a YouTube video I made explaining the secret ingredients and on how to make the soup: [https://youtu.be/Ejnjgszkn6A](https://youtu.be/Ejnjgszkn6A)\n\nFirstly, Benihana\u2019s soup is a variation of a traditional Japanese soup called, \u201cMiyabi Soup\u201d. Often you\u2019ll hear this soup referred to as \u201cClear Soup\u201d, (known in Japanese as: \u201cSuimono\u201d) but this soup isn\u2019t actually a traditional clear soup. Traditional clear soups are made with dashi. Hibachi soup or Miyabi soup is actually a long-simmered meat-broth soup. Because Benihana is essentially a fusion restaurant that uses Japanese-inspired base recipes and techniques with Western ingredients, their hibachi soup is sort of a conglomeration of a traditional miyabi soup mixed with a French consomme.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I\u2019ve seen online when people attempt to make the soup at home is: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t my soup as clear as what I\u2019ve seen at the restaurant?\u201d. The reason for this is because ALL recipes online call for regular chicken or beef stock as the simmering liquid. And while Benihana does use chicken and beef stock as the base for their soup, the brand they use (Swiss Chalet HACO brand) is actually a consomme base. For those of you who are unfamiliar with a consomme, it is essentially a stock or broth that has been clarified using a coagulating agent, typically egg whites or ground meat, to \u2018clear\u2019 the particles in the stock, resulting in a crystal clear final product. That\u2019s the reason why your soup isn\u2019t as clear as what you\u2019re getting at the restaurant.\n\nThe other biggest complaint I\u2019ve seen online is the soup is just bland. The reason for this is because most people are just following the recipe blindly and not seasoning enough at the end. The soup is actually just a broth simmered with caramelized vegetables, which are then strained and served with some garnishes. You\u2019ve really got to season the broth well after you strain the vegetables. That will take care of that problem. You need to taste and adjust the seasoning after you\u2019ve strained your broth.\n\nIn terms of the secret ingredients that are missing from every recipe online, they are, for the broth base and oil:\n\n1. Swiss Chalet HACO brand Chicken Base\n2. Swiss Chalet HACO brand Beef Base\n3. Soybean oil\n\nHACO Chicken Base (with msg):\n\n[https://www.scff.com/savory/haco-swiss-base-chicken-paste-8000412-c.html](https://www.scff.com/savory/haco-swiss-base-chicken-paste-8000412-c.html)\n\nHACO Chicken Base (no msg): \n[https://www.scff.com/haco-swiss-base-chicken-paste-8000441-c.html](https://www.scff.com/haco-swiss-base-chicken-paste-8000441-c.html)\n\nHACO Beef Base (with msg):\n\n[https://www.scff.com/savory/haco-swiss-base-beef-paste-8000410-c.html](https://www.scff.com/savory/haco-swiss-base-beef-paste-8000410-c.html)\n\nHACO Beef Base (no msg):\n\n[https://www.scff.com/savory/haco-swiss-base-beef-paste-8000451-c.html](https://www.scff.com/savory/haco-swiss-base-beef-paste-8000451-c.html)\n\nBenihana uses soybean oil to saute their vegetables, which you can find here:\n\n[https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nutrioli-Pure-Soybean-Oil-32-fl-oz/37620721](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nutrioli-Pure-Soybean-Oil-32-fl-oz/37620721)\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t want to purchase the Swiss Chalet stock bases? It\u2019s easy! Just replace them with Campbell\u2019s beef consomme (not regular stock!) and Campbell\u2019s chicken broth. While the clarity won\u2019t be as good as what you\u2019ll achieve using the HACO brand consomme base, because 90% of the liquid in the recipe will be beef consomme and water, you\u2019ll be almost as clear. And the taste is virtually identical!\n\nSo, without further adieu, here are the two recipes! One with the exact ingredients and one using ingredients you\u2019ll find at any grocery store!\n\n**Benihana Version:**\n\n2 T soybean oil\n\n4 garlic clove (crushed)\n\n1 \u00bd cup (350 ml) onion, rough chopped\n\n\u00be cup (175 ml) carrot, rough chopped\n\n\u00be cup (175 ml) celery, rough chopped\n\n\u00bd t (4 gram) Swiss Chalet HACO Brand chicken flavor base paste, dissolved in 1 cup boiling water\n\n\u00bd t (4 gram) Swiss Chalet HACO brand beef flavor base paste, dissolved in 1 cup boiling water\n\n6 cup (1.4 liter) water\n\n2 t (6 gram) kosher salt (for simmering)\n\n1/2 t (1.5 gram) whole peppercorn\n\nKosher salt (season to taste, after cooking)\n\nGarnish: thinly sliced white button mushrooms, thinly sliced green onions, French fried onions\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Heat oil in medium stockpot\n2. Saute garlic until lightly browned, remove from pot\n3. Saute carrot, celery and onion until caramelized\n4. Add garlic, beef and chicken stock, simmer for 3 minutes\n5. Add water, salt and peppercorns, bring to a boil, reduce to very low simmer for 45 minutes\n6. Strain soup through a fine mesh strainer\n7. After soup has cooled slightly, adjust seasoning with extra kosher salt\n8. Serve with thinly sliced white button mushrooms, thinly sliced green onions, French fried onions\n\n**Grocery Store Version:**\n\n2 T soybean oil\n\n4 Garlic Clove (crushed)\n\n1 \u00bd cup (350) onion, rough chopped\n\n\u00be cup (175 ml) carrot, rough chopped\n\n\u00be cup (175 ml) celery, rough chopped\n\n1 can (10.5oz) Campbell\u2019s condensed beef consomme\n\n1 can (10.5oz) Campbell\u2019s condensed chicken stock\n\n6 cup (1.4 liter) water\n\n2 t (6 gram) kosher salt (for simmering)\n\n1/2 t (1.5 gram) whole peppercorn\n\nKosher salt (season to taste, after cooking)\n\nDirections:\n\nFollow directions for the Benihana version.

Here's a homemade version of Chicken Scampi that you might enjoy:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced\n* Salt and black pepper to taste\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 4 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1/4 cup white wine (optional)\n* Juice of 1 lemon\n* Zest of 1 lemon\n* 1/2 cup chicken broth\n* 1/4 cup heavy cream\n* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n* 8 oz. linguine or spaghetti (cooked according to package instructions)\n* Lemon slices and additional parsley for garnish (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Season the thinly sliced chicken breasts with salt and black pepper.\n2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken slices and cook until they are golden brown on both sides and cooked through, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.\n3. In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Be careful not to let it brown.\n4. If using white wine, add it to the skillet to deglaze it, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Allow the wine to reduce by half, which should take a couple of minutes.\n5. Stir in the lemon juice, lemon zest, chicken broth, and heavy cream. Simmer the mixture for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.\n6. Return the cooked chicken to the skillet and simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the chicken through.\n7. Stir in the chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. Cook for another minute until the cheese has melted and the sauce is well combined.\n8. Serve the chicken and sauce over cooked linguine or spaghetti. Garnish with lemon slices and additional parsley if desired.\n\nThis homemade Chicken Scampi captures the flavors of the Olive Garden version. It's a delightful dish that combines tender chicken with a creamy lemon-garlic sauce.

My family wasn't poor, but we were definitely on the poor side. Going out to eat was a treat, and we invariably went to this local Italian joint. They had these amazing crusty dinner rolls they'd bring to the table, a killer sausage (I've never had an Italian sausage I like as much as theirs), and this fantastic house salad dressing. \"Normal\" meals for my family were a veggie pizza and a large house salad (split four ways), though on special occasions I'd usually get pasta and that sausage. It's the restaurant I took my wife on our first date. Anyway, the recipe isn't so secret, because at some point they published a cookbook, locally distributed, long, long out of print. I've had my copy since it was published in 1995, and it is stained and falling apart, but one of my most cherished cookbooks. It's funny, all the ingredients feel spot on, but they screw up the instructions in subtle ways, probably so you'll feel your version is inferior and go to the restaurant. Anyway, with that food blog-like to-do out of the way, here you go (with my corrected instructions):\n\n1/2 cup red wine vinegar  \n2 tablespoons granulated garlic  \n1 teaspoon salt  \n1/2 teaspoon white pepper  \n1 tablespoon dried oregano  \n2 cloves fresh garlic  \n3/4 cup boiling water  \n1 cup olive oil  \n1 cup vegetable oil  \n  \nCombine the first seven ingredients (everything except the oil) in a blender and blend on high speed for 30 seconds. Then, slowly drizzle in the oil.\n\nThe recipe doesn't specify the type of salt; given it was published in 1995, probably table salt. I usually use Morton kosher and double it. No need to break down the garlic cloves, and make sure you use fresh - I've found it doesn't emulsify the same way with jarred or tube garlic. And, the dried and fresh garlic really does make a difference.\n\n(Edit: Fuck, didn't even name it. Mazzi's in Eugene, Oregon.)", "Jet\u2019s Pizza - their Ranch is incredible.

According to most articles I could find, their bun supplier is [Puritan Bakery](https://www.puritanbakery.com/#products:hamburger-buns). They talk a bit about their method - \"sponge dough\", as others have pointed out - but don't have ingredients or other details. I did find [an article](https://www.ocregister.com/2011/03/24/the-secret-behind-socals-best-burgers/) that goes into that. Extracting:\n\n> Flour, water, shortening and yeast are mixed and set aside in a large trough where it rises and develops flavor...At the end of the four- to six-hour fermentation process, the mixture (not considered dough, yet) bubbles up \u2013 becoming a taffy-like blob.

If you take the article literally, there's no milk or eggs in it, and they use shortening instead of butter. If I was gonna duplicate them, I'd start with [this recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/beautiful-burger-buns-recipe). Use half the water, flour, and yeast, along with 2 tablespoons of shortening instead of the butter. Mix that thoroughly, then let sit for, like, 4 hours. Mix in the rest of the ingredients (I know, I said no egg, but I'm not changing that), then follow the rest of the steps. You probably won't need to knead as long. I like Joshua Weissman's pro move of using a 4\" English muffin ring to shape and bake the buns, so they bake up nice and tall. (Speaking of Josh, he has an In-n-Out \"But Better\" [recipe](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/in-n-out-burgers-but-better). He uses the \"[tangzhong](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/03/26/introduction-to-tangzhong)\" method instead of an autolyse step, though for whatever reason that recipe refers to it as a \"rue\", misspelling roux, which isn't even what you're doing.)", "The closest fake is probably a store bought brioche.

Shredded Mozzarella or\n\nChihuahua Cheese per Taco\n\n2 oz. seasoned Ground Beef per Taco\n\n1/2 oz. diced Tomato per Taco\n\n1/2 oz. shredded lettuce per taco\n\n1 tbsp. Sour Cream per taco\n\n### Taco Seasoning:\n\n2 tbsp. chili powder\n\n1 tbsp. ground cumin\n\n2 tsp. cornstarch\n\n2 tsp. kosher salt\n\n1 1/2 tsp. hot smoked paprika\n\n1 tsp. ground coriander\n\n1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper\n\nMix Taco seasoning and store in an airtight container for up to one month. Over high heat in a large skillet, add bacon fat and ground beef. Break meat up with a wooden spoon as it cooks down, stirring frequently. 8-10 min. Once all the moisture cooks out of the beef and it is falling apart/fully cooked, continue to let it crisp up slightly in the rendered beef fat. 3-5 min. There should be plenty of crispy brown bits covering the bottom of pan. Remove pan from heat and prop it on something to elevate one side of the pan and move the cooked beef towards the elevated side of the pan. This will result in the rendered fat pooling on the low side of the pan. Allow to drain for 3-5 min. Then spoon the rendered fat out of the pan.\n\nReturn pan back to very low heat and add the taco seasoning and water which will de-glaze the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Use the wooden spoon to release the brown bits. Remove from the heat and the beef is ready to serve. Over medium-high heat very lightly grease a cast iron skillet or griddle pan. Place flour tortillas side by side on the griddle and top each one with cheese. Add seasoned ground beef, diced tomato, shredded lettuce and sour cream. After 2-4 min. the tortillas should be lightly browned and crispy on the outside. Fold each taco over itself to create a half-moon shape, lightly press and serve.\n\n## Taco Desayuno \n\n1 tbsp melted butter\n\n3 each corn tortillas\n\n2.5 weighted oz potato hash\n\n4 fluid oz eggs\n\n1 tsp Sriracha lime crema\n\n1 tbsp pico de gallo\n\n3 slices of avocado\n\n1 weighted oz diced chorizo\n\n2 weighted oz chopped bacon\n\nCook potato hash in skillet until soft In a separate skillet, add 1 tbsp melted butter and add eggs. Season with salt and pepper and cook until scrambled. \\*Note: If using chorizo, cook for about 30 seconds until slightly crispy before adding to the egg mixture. For bacon, wait until eggs are cooked about halfway and add bacon to the egg mixture at that time. Place the potato hash on corn tortilla Place scrambled eggs (and additional proteins if desired) on top of the potato hash Zigzag Sriracha lime crema over eggs Top with 1 tsp of pico de gallo and 1 avocado slice per taco\n\n## Fresh Guacamole\n\n1 tbsp. green onions thinly sliced\n\n2 tbsp. lime juice\n\n1 tbsp. red onions diced at \u215b-inch\n\n2 tsp. sundried tomato chopped\n\n\u00bc tsp. kosher salt\n\n1 tbsp. cilantro chopped\n\n2 avocados halved and diced\n\n## Grilled Cauliflower Steak with Sauce Romesco\n\nhead of cauliflower\n\n\u00bd-pound halved Roma tomatoes, broiled until skins are charred and tomatoes are tender\n\n1 small yellow onion peeled, cut into wedges and broiled in same manner as tomatoes\n\n2 red bell peppers: fire-roasted, peeled, seeded and chopped.

(Reserve trim for another preparation or can be roasted for the Romesco sauce.) Select Italian dressing or vinaigrette of choice, enough to lightly coat the slices of cauliflower, and marinate for 12 hours. Heat cast iron skillet to medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of Canola oil to pan for searing. Gently place each slice of cauliflower in the hot oil and sear until deep golden brown on the first side. Carefully flip cauliflower to sear other side. Place cauliflower in oven and roast until tender, approximately 5-15 minutes depending on oven temperature and thickness.\n\nFor Sauce Romesco: Preheat broiler to medium to broil tomatoes and onions.

Grease a 9x13\u201d baking pan with cooking spray. Line with parchment paper if you\u2019d like.\n* For the cake, put flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl and whisk well.\n* In a stand mixer, mix the buttermilk, oil, eggs, vanilla together. Slowly add in the mix of dry ingredients while the mixer is on low. Add the coffee and make sure everything is combined. The batter will be very thin.\n* Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.\n* Allow the cake to cool on a wire rack. After it is mostly cooled, place it in the freezer to so the topping is easier to apply. Try to let it freeze for at least 20 minutes.\n\n#### Make the buttercream:\n\n* In a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, cream the butter, shortening and vanilla for 2-3 minutes until it is almost white in appearance.\n* Add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time, while mixing on low speed. Cover the mixer with a dish towel, if needed, to prevent powdered sugar from blowing out of the bowl.\n* Add in the heavy cream a tablespoon at a time, and continue mixing on low. Add more cream as needed to get the desired consistency.\n* Place the frosting in a decorating bag with a large open circle tip. (Wilton 1A or slightly smaller. This will depend on how tall you want your bumps.)\n* Pipe 4 frosting ribbons across the cake evenly (they should be about 1-inch wide). Place the cake back in the freezer while you make the fudge frosting.\n\n#### Make the fudge frosting:\n\n* In a medium saucepan over medium low heat, combine the buttermilk, sugar, corn syrup, cocoa powder, salt and half of the butter. Bring the mixture to a boil and heat to the soft-ball stage (234-240 degrees Fahrenheit).\n* Remove from heat and add the remaining butter cubes. Stir until melted.\n* Whisk in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract until well combined.\n* Remove the cake from the freezer and drizzle the fudge frosting over the cake evenly. If the fudge starts to harden, you can rewarm it to melt it again.\n* Put the cake in the freezer for 15 minutes to set.\n* Store in an airtight container. Any leftovers can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.", "Sander's Buttercream Frosting:\n\nThis may be related recipe butchange the almond flavoring to vanilla rxtract instead.

Anyways, you can make a good gravy with the basic recipes out there, but as mentioned here, the important part is how it\u2019s made. you want to add the flour to the sausage before the sausage is done so it has time to brown. or you could cook the sausage, set it aside, then add flour and cook in pan till brown, then add back in the sausage. i just add the flour to the sausage after the sausage is all broken up and beginning to brown.", "1 lb bulk roll of pork sausage\n\n1\u20444 cup all-purpose flour\n\n2 cups milk\n\nsalt and black pepper\n\n8 prepared biscuits\n\n[Instructions](https://www.food.com/recipe/bob-evans-sausage-gravy-copycat-257934)\n\n1.

Also from experience, i've had some buffalo chicken dip seasoning mixes that utilized these dairy powders to get a pretty good flavor in that area. MSG, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Yeast extract, Disodium inosinate, and disodium guanylate are all flavor enhancers that don't contribute much on their own (expect the HVP corn.

Add jalapeno lime juice mixture onto the mashed avocado, then mix until it is combined thorougly. Season with little more salt.   \nEnjoy!\n\n\\++++\n\nSalsa de Arbol (Chile Arbol Salsa):  \n10 - 12 Arbol Chiles >> Spicy Hot! If you can take it. If not, lessen the number to 3 Arbol Chiles.  \n1/2 white onion, peeled and roughly chopped  \n3 - 4 Guajillo Chiles >> Smoky with fruity flavor  \n4 - 5 Garlic Cloves  \n1 - 2 Jalapenos or Serranos  \nSalt, to taste  \n1. Clean chiles with damp paper towel. Arrange  chiles, white onion nad garlic on baking sheet and **toast in 350-degree oven just until fragrant and puffed, about 6 minutes**.  \n2. Transfer all of the ingredients in a blender, add little water to agitate the blending process. Cover and blend on HIGH until the salsa is smooth but little thick. Season with salt. Blend. Taste.   \n3. Transfer to a bowl and enjoy them with chips or tacos.  \nNote: This sauce can be modified using different types of chiles like pasilla, habanero, Morita, Puya and other hotter chile varieties. You can mix and match these chiles depending how spicy and change their flavor profiles.  You can also use chile pepper of a different country origin, if you don't have these chilies in your country. Outside in America, it is difficult to find these spicy hotter varieties like the Puya, Morita, Piquin, Pasilla, Poblano. But in the UK or other countries have already a supplier to distribute Dried Guajillo peppers to use on moles, salsas and other rich guisado dishes. You can use hot sauce or different types of chili pepper powder to add heat to your salsas. I recommend to start using 1/2 tsp and increase it to how you and other people can tolerate the heat. Think of other people's spicy hot tolerance. Tone it down the dial for the spicy level because not everyone can handle the heat.   \nYou can even start adding some fruits like mangoes, pink guava, pineapple to make a spicy fruit salsa to tacos or bbq sauce or whatever you are going to use this condiment.\n\n\\+++++\n\nSalsa Verde:  \n8 to 10 tomatillos, husk removed and washed\n\n1/2 white onion, peeled and roughly chopped\n\n3 - 4 garlic cloves\n\n1/2 bunch cilantro\n\nSalt, to season and taste  \n1. Remove the husks or the skin of the tomatillos. Then rinse the tomatillos very well.  \n2. **Slice** the tomatillos in half through the horizontal center (not up and down) and arrange on a large baking dish with the skin sides up. add the white onion and garlic.Spray or brush lightly with oil.\n\n3. **Bake** tomatiilos at preheated 400F for 20 minutes until the skins have blisters and slightly charred.\n\n4. Lastly, remove the tomatiilos from oven. Turn off, then cool the tomatillos on a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n5. Add all of the roasted ingredients in a blender. Add little water to agitate the blending process. Cover and Blend on HIGH until salsa verde is smooth and slightly chunky. Season with salt. Then taste.\n\n6. Transfer the ingredients to a bowl.\n\n\\++++\n\nSALSA DE TOMATO:\n\n\\- This salsa is great on rich and  deep fried dishes like tacos dorados, hard shell tacos, flautas, freshly pressed quesadillas, nachos or tortilla chips and other pan-fried dishes.\n\n3 Tomatoes\n\n2 tbsp oil\n\n3 - 4 garlic cloves\n\n1 jalapeno\n\n1 medium carrot, peeled steamed and finely chopped\n\n1/2 white onion, peeled and roughly chopped\n\n1. On a skillet, add oil and heat it over Medium high heat until oil is splattering.\n2. Add tomatoes, garlic cloves, white onion, and jalapeno until the skin is blistering hot, fragrant.\n3. Meanwhile, steam the carrots until tender. Remove carrot and transfer to small bowl to cool completely. Chop the steamed carrot finely. Set aside.\n4. Remove the onions, cool slightly. Then diced finely and set aside with the carrots.\n5. Add the pan dried tomatoes, garlic and jalapenos. Add little water to agitate the blending process. Cover and use a towel over the blender's cover. Blend on high until the salsa is smooth but thick.\n6. Transfer the salsa de tomato in a bowl. Add the chopped carrots and onions and mix until these 2 ingredients are evenly distributed.\n\nAnother recipe,await for more tips or tricks next Saturday!", "My post got deleted because it was not associated with a chain restaurant and any other food establishment.

Here is another to steam multiple hard boiled eggs and peeling them. So boil multiple eggs in boiling water on high heat for 12 minutes. \n\nMeanwhile, while boiling the eggs, get a container like a very large bowl and fill it with half ice and half cold water. You have an ice bath where you cool hot food to make it cool on very cold water. Set aside.\n\nAfter you have boiled your eggs, strain the boiling water onto the sink. Then transfer the eggs onto the ice bath. Leave it for about 5 minutes, then get 5 or 6 eggs onto an empty stainless steel bowl or a bowl that has a flattened bottom. Shake your eggs vigorously in little up and down movements to partially crack the eggs. Then peel the eggs onto an ice bath or just another bowl of cold water. Eventually, it is easier to crack and peel the eggs under cold water.\n\nI used to boil 120 eggs on a daily basis for the salad bar, but sometimes another prep cook asked me to boil the same number of eggs for his egg salad on the deli bar (he makes hot and cold sandwiches).

That being said...\n\nIngredients listed by quantity (weight):\n\nDegermed Yellow Corn Meal, Whole Wheat, Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Iron, Riboflavin, Thiamin Mononitrate, Folic Acid), Vegetable Oil (Soybean, High Oleic Soybean, High Oleic Canola, High Oleic Sunflower, Fractionated Palm, Palm Olein And/or Palm), Rye Flour, Sugar, Contains 2% Or Less Of: Salt, Yeast, Maltodextrin, Baking Soda, Spice, Dextrose, Caramel Color, Distilled Monoglycerides, Malted Barley Extract, Barley Malt Syrup, Autolyzed Yeast, Yellow Corn Flour, Trisodium Phosphate, Calcium Carbonate, Dried Onion, Dried Garlic, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Rye Flour, Fumaric Acid, Citric Acid, Caraway, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Guanylate, Paprika Extract (Color), Natural Flavor, Sodium Diacetate, Freshness Preserved By BHT.\n\nIgnoring the snack pieces and preservatives:\n\nVegetable oil, sugar, salt, maltodextrin, spice, dextrose, malted barley extract, barley malt syrup, autolyzed yeast, dried onion, dried garlic, hydrolyzed soy protein, fumaric acid, citric acid, caraway, paprika, natural flavor\n\nVegetable oil is a pretty neutral oil. You could use butter, but butter is so flavorful that it may make it taste too different for your tastes. Our brains love dense calories so even a relatively tasteless oil can make food much more delicious.\n\nThe sugar can be used alone instead of bothering with maltodextrin and dextrose. Maltodextrin and dextrose aren't as sweet as sugar and are often used to bulk up products and sweeten low-sugar or low-calorie foods.\n\nThe salt is key. Usually one would salt something until it tastes like the best version of itself but without making it taste salty. Certain foods, like junk food, use salt as a flavor so you likely want to make the chex mix a bit salty on purpose.\n\nThe malted barley extract and barley malt syrup are bringing some big malty, earthy flavors. I would use one or the other or substitute for molasses to get close. Maybe you could use Worcestershire, but I doubt they use any as I don't see vinegar, molasses, or anchovies in the ingredients.\n\nThe autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed soy protein taste savory or umami. You should use MSG which is often sold in US grocery stores as Accent. Monosodium glutamate is safe and does not cause headaches. You can't skip this - it's what makes mushrooms taste meaty, Parmesan taste so savory, and a large reason why Flamin' Hot Cheetos, Doritos (and Chex Mix) taste so good.\n\nDried onion, dried garlic, and paprika are probably enough to get close in terms of the spice blend aroma. Usually dried parsley is in there, too. If it doesn't taste right maybe try adding the caraway. Spices and natural flavors are not required to be disclosed so there may be some secrets in there, but if you have everything else down you'll probably be close enough to be content.\n\nThe fumaric acid and citric acid can be simplified to just citric acid. This is very important, though, as acidity in food makes the aromas pop (that zing you were looking for) and makes greasy food more palatable.\n\nSome of the preservatives will contribute bitterness, but I wouldn't worry about bitterness as you'll get some naturally from certain ingredients and too much is a negative.\n\nConsider blitzing your dry ingredients in a spice grinder to get everything superfine for better distribution.\n\nAs far as amounts and ratios: there are 2g (1/2 tsp) sugar and 250mg (~1/10 tsp) salt per 0.5 cup serving. I like MSG at half the amount of salt you use and citric acid is strong so maybe start with hardly any. So for 4 cups (~210g) maybe 4 tsp sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp MSG, 1/16 tsp citric acid. The rest will have to be experimentation.\n\nGood luck. Hope that helps.", "Maybe try a little celery salt? And the paprika.", "Not Worcestershire sauce, but instead Worcestershire  powder.

Grab the giant ball of dough, move to the table, and start to weigh your \u2153 and \u00bd lb slabs of dough\n6.  Use the cutting press to get your buns precut on the dough \n7.

{"title": "Pf Chang's (Non-US location) Vegetable Spring Roll Dipping Sauce and Spicy Tuna Sushi Red Sauce", "selftext": "Hello, I have recently moved out of my country of origin where one of my favorite restaurants was Pf Chang's. The two dishes I most enjoyed were the vegetable fried spring rolls (or egg rolls) because of it's very distinctive dipping sauce and the spicy tuna sushi roll, because they used a sauce that tasted dissimilar to sriracha for their spicy tuna. I have been trying to brainstorm ideas on how to recreate this and I would love to hear suggestions on how to recreate these flavors:\n\n\\- The spring roll sauce is very tart and acid, not so much sweet as is usual for me. It is quite translucent and transparent in color with a slight orange hue, and you can see some chili pepper flecks floating around. It does not taste like sweet chili sauce, it is more of an acid base sauce. I was trying to analyze its taste and it doesn't really taste like normal vinegar to me, nor do I get the taste of rice vinegar, lime, lemon or pineapple. The tartness isn't citrusy at all, but it lacks the bitterness of vinegar and is punchier than rice vinegar (which I first thought of since it's not as bitter as regular vinegar). It also doesn't have the taste of wine vinegar. \n\n\\- The spicy tuna sauce is red and very opaque like gochujang, not translucent and gummy like sriracha. But it doesn't have a fermented taste at all like gochujang. \n\nI have searched online and haven't found a copycat recipe for these elements yet. I appreciate any suggestions.\n\nedited for grammar.

I worked at Crumbl for about 3 years and spent most of that time as the main baker and an assistant manager. When I left I had all the most common recipes memorized but it's been over a year since then so I apologize if you come asking me about your favorite cookie and I don't have an answer.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Crumbl keeps their main cookie recipes from being fully known by using something they call \"packets\" these have a mix of powders in them that by the smell I think contain baking soda, salt, vanilla powder, and a tiny bit of flour presumably to keep from having lumps/help with mixing. Due to this my measurements of these ingredients are my best guess only and not official and can be up to interpretation. This is just what has worked for me so far.\n\nWithout further adieu, here is the recipe shrunk down for the avrage person because the regular size batch makes 60 5.5oz cookies.\n\n1lb room temperature butter\n3/4lb Brown Sugar\n1/2lb Sugar\n2lb Flour\n4 Eggs\n11/4lb Chocolat Chips\n\n2ts Vanilla\n2ts Baking soda\n1ts Salt\n\nThe way you combine the ingredients I would argue is the most important part so pay attention here.\n\n1)Cream the butter and sugars together for longer than you think they should be. You want the mixture to turn very light but not quite white. Scrape the bowl several times throughout this process. You can add the vanilla any time here.\n\n2)Here's the weird one. Scrape the sides and bottom of the mixer before dumping in half your eggs. Turn the mixer on the lowest setting for only a few seconds. Just enough to break the yolks. Stop the mixer, scrape the sides and bottom, and add the other half. Turn the mixer back on the lowest setting for another extremely short time before scraping again and checking for unbroken yolks. The mix should look like flower petals or walnut sized globs of creamed batter separated by lightly mixed eggs.\n\n3)Lightly mix the salt and baking soda into the flour before adding it to the mixer. Mix until there's still a handful of powder left at the bottom not fully incorporated.\n\n4)Scrape the mixer well and add your chocolate chips. Mix till just combined. DO NOT OVER MIX. You will know you over mixed the last step if your chocolate chips are falling out excessively. For best results use the dough immediately.\n\nCrumbl set their specialty ovens to 290F, baked the 5.5oz balls for 16 minutes, and let them cool on the pan for 5min. For my home oven I made my balls maybe half the size and set the temperature to 350F.\n\nComment with any questions.

I\u2019m gonna give you tips that I\u2019ve learned from growing up in restaurants where we made ooey gooey grilled cheese to go with our homemade tomato soup, and having had requests to make grilled cheese sandwiches more than any other sandwich. Once you make it for people, you\u2019re done-you\u2019ll be making that grilled cheese for life. The consistency of the cheese relies on two important things-the temperature of the cheese (are you giving it enough time to get hot in the bread, or are you worried about burning your bread and the cheese is your biggest worry) and the type of cheese you use (each cheese has strengths/weaknesses, and some don\u2019t belong in grilled cheese-others aren\u2019t put into grilled cheese enough).\u00a0\n\n\nThe best tips are simple. Butter is the best crust component for grilled cheese. Butter also burns **very easily**.\u00a0If you\u2019re cooking on the stovetop and using butter, please remember to go low and slow. Especially if your stove is gas. It doesn\u2019t matter if the pan is nonstick-butter browns slowly but scorches **fast**. You\u00a0need to be careful. Your buttered bread will appear to be doing nothing. *Don\u2019t fall for it!!!* It will burn the second you let your brain wander, or walk away for 30 seconds to get a drink. Don\u2019t let anyone distract you. Focus on your sandwich. Don\u2019t make more than one at a time. Put your phone away.\u00a0\n\n\nYou need to cook both slices of bread at the same time. Do not crowd your bread. Leave at least two fingers width all the way around the bread to the sides. This probably means you\u2019ll need two pans. Just because you\u2019re cooking at the same time, it doesn\u2019t mean both slices will be done at exactly the same time. Treat them both independently. You\u2019ll put them together at the end-until then, they\u2019re independent of each other.\n\n\nDo **not** spray your pan with cooking spray. Do **not** use margarine.\u00a0\n\n\nSugary bread burns easier. Brioche, honey anything, thick white. They also taste great, so you wanna use them! Just turn down your butter a little more than normal and really don\u2019t rush-they\u2019ll burn way faster than normal.\u00a0\n\n\nToast both sides of the bread. You will finish one side, place it on a plate with cooked side visible\u00a0(untoasted side against the plate).\u00a0Get the other slice out of the pan when it\u2019s ready (they\u2019re usually ready at least 1 minute apart) and place on a plate, cooked side visible (untoasted side against the plate). Add butter knobs to pan. Cook until it begins to melt, add a pinch of salt to the butter, and place your bread on top of the melting knob. Turn bread in circles in pan as it continues to melt so it\u2019s coated. Do not smash bread. Do not rush process.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce your bread is coated in butter in the pan, add your cheese and any other components to the already-toasted side of the bread. I always put it on the side of the bread that I flipped second, both because the toasted side you\u2019ll be adding cheese to is likely more hot, and because the other slice of bread should be finished browning first, so that makes it easy to put on top. Put your layers of cheese on evenly and to the edge of the bread, folding slices of cheese to break off an edge to help it reach all 4 corners of the bread.\u00a0\n\n\nCold or hot toppings change the temperature of the bread and can cause issues, so try to put room-temp items on with your cheese. Want to add \u00a0mayo/mustard/jam? Place in a small ramekin on the side and dunk your finished grilled cheese if you really want-don\u2019t add to bread-it makes it soggy and ruins the crispy finish. Also, your bread will always brown a tiny bit faster on this side, although I don\u2019t know why. When the slice without cheese on it is finished browning, flip that bread onto the other, cheese-covered bread to make a sandwich for the first time since you started making the sandwich!!!\n\n\nDon\u2019t pull your sandwich out of the pan to serve until the bottom slice of bread is toasted and finished-keep an eye on it! The cheese will melt in its own-you just worry about the bread being right!!!\n\n\nWhen it\u2019s finished, place on hard surface (not paper plate) and cut in half with a large, sharp knife by pressing down on it once. This allows the steam out so your bread doesn\u2019t get soggy in the middle and won\u2019t make a steam pile on your plate and sog the bottom slice.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense! You can look up cheeses to see what they pair best with if you want to make it fancy, but a couple slices of American cheese on white done this way really sings!!! \u2764\ufe0f", "It says on their website it's an all natural American cheese melted on texas  toast.

CAKE. I\u2019ve ever had in my life, no exaggeration. In the span of two weeks, I ordered the cake from them on DoorDash 5 times. That's once every other day. I haven't tasted anything better in my life. It's supposed to be a twist on sticky toffee pudding I believe but the cake is denser and chewier than regular sticky toffee pudding, and the BEST part is the SAUCE - perfect texture, perfect sweetness, so caramelly, not to heavy not too light. Best part is when it's refrigerated it gets a little thicker and chewy, ribonny, l'm not sure how to describe it but l've attached pictures lol. Anyways I moved out of LA recently and I've been craving it sooo badly and trying sticky toffee puddings at other restaurants / from the grocery stores but nothing compares - all the ones I\u2019ve tried taste too soft/moist and dissolve in my mouth, and the sauce tastes sweet in a different way? Idk how to explain it, but it makes me think this isn\u2019t a traditional \u2018sticky toffee pudding\u2019 - like I said its denser chewier, and I know the caramel sauce is made with brown sugar, maybe it uses some type of syrup? I don\u2019t know how to explain it but the sauce has more depth and tastes richer but not \u2018heavy\u2019/cream forward.

The differences: Dole contains both vinegar and lemon juice (most recipes just use lemon); Dole adds sugar and onion; Dole doesn't have any mustard component (unless it's bundled under \"spices\"; mustard flour is one of the spices that the USDA allows under that term); Dole's garlic is dried, not fresh.\n\nIf you wanted to use the Bon Appetit recipe as a starting place, here's the changes I would make: Start with 1 anchovy and work up from there; substitute 1/4 teaspoon dried garlic granules for the fresh garlic; use 4 teaspoons white vinegar and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in place of the lemon juice; use 1/4 teaspoon Colmans mustard powder in place of the dijon; add a pinch of dried onion granules; use jarred \"green can\" Parmesan instead of \"good\" parm; add some sugar to taste (I'd say start at 1/4 teaspoon, but you could also leave it out - honestly, caesar dressing isn't supposed to be sweet). You can follow their instructions to lightly cook the egg yolk, or if you don't mind eating them raw, just skip that. Oh, and use a blender instead of whisking by hand like you're Amish - an immersion blender works great. I'll note that you could add some xanthan gum while you're blending to help thicken and hold it together, but it's not necessary; if you do, start with 1/8 teaspoon because the stuff is powerful.\n\nBut, can I point you to another option? I consider Matty Matheson's \"[burn your tongue](https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/food-and-drink/article/recipe-matty-mathesons-burn-your-tongue-caesar-salad)\" caesar to be the gold standard. It's super punchy with all that garlic and pepper in it."]}

I've seen [southern US buttermilk salad dressing](https://mykitchenlittle.com/2024/02/26/southern-buttermilk-salad-dressing/#tasty-recipes-11286-jump-target); that actually looks relatively close to those ingredients. So, I would start with that mykitchenlittle link. Leave out the herbs; put in a tablespoon of dried mixed Italian herbs and 1/4 teaspoon each garlic powder and onion powder; plus a little (1/2 teaspoon to start) lemon juice. If you want to be a little more homemade, make your own mayonnaise. Your ingredients are two egg yolks, 1 cup oil, and 2 tablespoons vinegar (just plain ol' white vinegar). I use a quart deli container and an immersion blender. You put the egg yolks and vinegar into the container and blend with the immersion blender, then slowly add the oil with the blender running. Then use that in the recipe."]}

It's based on Buffalo Wild Wings and I got it from here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4K2TXUEWss&feature=youtu.be&t=0s \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n1 Jar of Mayonnaise (330g)\n\n3 Garlic Bulbs\n\nOlive Oil (for roasting garlic)\n\n6 Tbsp Parmesan Cheese\n\n3 Tbsp Corn Syrup\n\n3 Tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n\n3 tsp Lemon Juice\n\n3 Tbsp Dry Seasoning Blend (see below)\n\n**Dry Seasoning Blend:**\n\n1 tsp Marjoram\n\n1 tsp Basil\n\n1 tsp Oregano\n\n1 tsp Thyme\n\n1 tsp Black Pepper\n\n1.5 tsp Salt\n\n1.5 tsp Red Pepper Flakes\n\n**Instructions:**\n\nRoast the Garlic: Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Chop off the top of each garlic bulb, exposing the garlic cloves. Place them on a sheet of aluminum foil, drizzle with about a tablespoon of olive oil, and wrap the foil to enclose the garlic.\n\nBake: Roast in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, or until the garlic is soft and easily squishable.\n\nGarlic Paste: Let the roasted garlic cool down enough to handle. Squeeze the softened garlic cloves out of their skins and into a food processor. Blitz until you have a smooth paste. Pro-Tip: Roasted garlic is amazing for other recipes too, so feel free to roast extra!\n\nSeasoning Prep: In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients for the dry seasoning blend. Set aside.\n\nCombine Wet Ingredients: In a medium-sized bowl, combine the garlic paste, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, corn syrup, apple cider vinegar, and lemon juice.\n\nAdd Dry Seasoning: Now, add about 3 tablespoons of the dry seasoning blend to the wet mixture. You can add more or less to taste. Stir well to combine.\n\nRefrigerate: For the best flavor, refrigerate the sauce overnight before using. This lets the flavors meld together!\n\n**Notes:**\n\nFeel free to adjust the amount of the dry seasoning blend to your liking! Want it spicier? Add more red pepper flakes.\n\nEnjoy! \ud83d\ude0b", "I was about to post asking for the same thing.

Hope all my notes make sense, I've used this to make both classic pan pizzas as well as stuffed crust. The pan pizza gets very, very close, the secret is in how oily the dough is. For the most authentic approach, you're going to wind up basically frying this pizza in the pan. Remember that Pizza Hut is not a health food! \n\n(Edit: In terms of scale, these are obviously going to be a bit bigger than \"personal\" pizza, but you can experiment with portioning your dough out smaller. You just need to make sure that your small pan is deep enough for the pizza to sit in all that oil)\n\nPizza Crust:\n2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n1 tablespoon sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup non-fat dry milk powder\n308 g warm water (105 degrees F)\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for dough)\n4 cups all-purpose flour\n\nPizza Sauce:\n1 can (8 ounce size) tomato sauce\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram\n1/2 teaspoon dried basil\n1/2 teaspoon garlic salt\n\nAssembly:\n9 ounces vegetable oil (3 ounce per pan)\nmozzarella cheese\nstring cheese (stuffed crust only)\npizza toppings as desired\n\n**1.) Make the Dough**\n\n- Combine the yeast, sugar, salt, and dry milk in a 2-quart size mixing bowl. \n\n- Add the water and stir to mix. Let the mixture sit for 2 minutes or until the yeast starts to bubble.\n\n- Add the oil to the dough mixture and stir to combine.\n\n- Add the flour in one cup increments, stirring after each addition, until a dough forms and the flour is all combined.\n\n- Turn the dough out onto a flat, lightly floured surface and knead by hand for about 10 minutes.\n\nIf making pan pizzas:\n\n- Divide the dough into three equal balls.\n\n- Place about 3 ounces of oil in the bottom of each 9-inch cake pan or cast iron skillet. Tilt the pans to spread the oil evenly. \n\n(**Quick note**: the dough is also made with oil, and 3oz in the pan can be too much depending on how that turns out. If making for the first time, maybe start with 2oz. Make notes on your results! The dough should actually be decently saturated with oil) \n\n- Using a rolling pin, roll out each ball of dough to a 9-inch circle and place in the prepared pans.\n\n- Lightly coat each dough disk with cooking spray or oil and cover with plastic wrap. Place in a warm, draft-free location and let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours.\n\nIf making stuffed crust pizzas:\n\n- Divide the dough into two equal balls \n\n- Put the dough balls in separate bowls, cover with a tea towel and stick somewhere somewhat warm. An **off** oven with the oven light **on** is perfect. Saran wrap also works instead of a tea towel if you don't have one. Let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours\n\n- Lightly coat a perforated 14-inch pizza pan with vegetable oil. Should be just enough to cover the pan. \n\n(**Pro tip**: put some foil or, even better, some other kind of reusable/cleanable layer under the pan to keep your counter oil free!) \n\n- Roll out dough flat and transfer to the pan. It doesn't have to be perfect! You can finish helping the dough fill out the pan by hand, but take care to not create holes in the dough or push dough through the perforations of your pan.\n\n- Put bits of string cheese along the edges of the dough (and extra shredded if you're feeling especially lactose tolerant today), then roll/pinch to seal it. Sometimes, I'll take a fork and try to press things down for a little extra seal, but take care to not destroy your dough in the process.\n\n**2.) Make the Sauce**\n\n- Prepare the sauce by combining all the ingredients until blended. Let sit at room temperature for at least one hour. The sauce can be made ahead of time and kept in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before using.\n\n**3.) Assemble and Bake the Pizzas**\n\n- Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F. \n\n(**Quick note on ovens**: everyone's is different. This is going to be trial and error and you should absolutely keep notes on how your pizzas go. At my house, we use two racks in our oven. A pizza steel on the bottom rack, and a pizza stone on the top. This isn't required but keep in mind you may have to go longer in your oven to get the same results you enjoy at my house. But that also might not be true! Keep an eye on things, take notes!)\n\n- Spoon a bit the sauce on the dough and, for pan pizza, spread to within 1 inch of the edges. Stuffed crust pizzas can be sauced all the way up to the seam you created during the roll and pinch process, take care not to sauce the top of your stuffed crust.\n\n- Sprinkle with a small bit of the shredded mozzarella cheese, just enough to lightly cover the dough. \n\n- Top the pizza as desired. Like everything else, note how much you put on and adjust per your preference for future attempts.\n\n- Top off with the rest of your cheese!\n\n(**If you get crazy and want to experiment with carmelized crust on a pan pizza**: Basically all you have to do is cheese your pizza to the very edge of the pan, and make sure a good amount of the shredded cheese ends up between the edge of the dough and the pan. You can use a butter knife or cake spatula to give yourself enough of a gap to tuck some cheese back there. If you do this, the pizza needs to be immediately removed from the pan when it comes out of the oven so the cheese doesn't get stuck. The second it comes out, run your knife or spatula along the entire edge of the pan and slide it out onto a cutting board to finish cooling. I would call this process moderately difficult, tread with caution)\n\n- Place the pizzas in the oven and cook until the outer crust is brown and the cheese is bubbly in the center. Typically 11-15 minutes, but this can vary based on the amount of toppings used as well as your oven!\n\n- Remove from the oven. Let cool for 5 minutes, then remove from the pans onto a cutting board and cut into wedges!", "Use a cast iron pan to make the pizza. \n\nUse a French bread recipe for the dough. \n\nCoat the formed dough in butter.

It\u2019s kinda salty, a little sweet, not spicy, maybe some garlic. It\u2019s also has something that puckers your mouth a little if you try it on its own. It\u2019s not sour, but will make your mouth tighten up and pucker a little.\n\nIf you think you have a recipe. I\u2019d be grateful for details. If you think it\u2019s soy, can you tell me if it\u2019s plain, dark, or some other version. Same if you think it\u2019s vinegar.

I\u2019ve found generic, filtered store brand ACV or even white are much milder.

Reviewers say that even the breast pieces are juicy. Ezell's also claims they don't use typical fryer chickens, and their chicken pieces are larger. So here's what I think about the method:  \n1. Start with a skin-on, bone-in roaster chicken, cut it into standard 8 pieces \u2014 2 breasts, 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings.  \n2. Brine pieces in water with salt and sugar for 4 to 6 hours. Normally this would wreck the skin, but step 4 takes care of that. (Brine: 1/2 cup each table salt and granulated sugar per gallon of water.)\n3. Take the chicken pieces out of the brine, rinse the brine off, then pat with paper towels or let excess water drip off on a rack for several minutes.  \n4. Dredge each piece separately in a bowl of all-purpose flour, then in egg wash, then in a separate bowl of all-purpose flour again. The clumps that form in the flour are a good thing. The second bowl of flour can have a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch blended in to help make the crust crispier, and you can mix in spices to it if you like. Place the twice-dredged chicken pieces on a cooling rack, and the rack on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator to dry for a few hours.  \n5. Frying times and temps will take some experimenting. Use a deep electric skillet or something similar, which can maintain the vegetable oil at 360\u00b0 F or so. Breast pieces are larger and may take longer, wings are small and may take a little less. Judge based on the crust \u2014 you want a golden brown color but not too brown. When done, place each piece on a drying rack rather than paper towels to keep the crust crispy. You should have crispy, tasty crust on very moist, flavorful chicken.  \nNote: Try frying one piece first to see how it's working. If the chicken is undercooked when the crust is done, let the pieces come to room temperature before putting them in the hot oil to fry."]}

The color was different as it was like a dark tan from the cookie dough. When cookie was cooled completely. It had the crispy edges of the rolled oats, and wheatgerm. But the centers are chewy, little sweet and mini chocolate chips sets them apart from the sweetness that imparts bittersweet flavor. The texture is just perfect like the one from Specialty's.\n\n\\++++\n\nI baked the Specialty's Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate chip cookies on 350F for 14 mins. It spread way too much because of the amount of light brown sugar it had. Tasted little burnt and the edges burnt. Not pleasant.\n\nIt was a failure for the 3rd time.\n\n\\++++++\n\n2nd, I tried making the dough of the Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe from Advanced Baking and Pastry from Wiley Publishing. I modified the recipe and adapted how Specialty's would have it. The cookies came out as thick, chewy, hearty cookie. Not too sweet but little buttery flavor. I would add little more salt next time. It is a great cookie. The recipe is provided below of the successful cookie between the 2.\n\nLet them cool on pan until cooled completely and the insides are set and firm.\n\nAdvanced Baking and Pastry Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate Chip Cookies:\n\n340 g butter, softened + 390 g light brown sugar (liquid ingredient) + 198 g all purpose flour + 28 g whole wheat flour + 28 g bran flour + 3 g baking soda + 5 g salt + 2.5 g ground cinnamon + 28 g wheatgerm + 369 g rolled oats (old-fashioned rolled oats is okay) +10 ml vanilla extract + 284 g (5 large eggs) + 250 g mini chocolate chips (choose Guittard Almost MIcro chocolate chips. Other brands wouldn't cut it because real chocolate flavor is lost. And after cookies are baked, it tends to get crunchy without any chocolate flavor.\n\nCombine all flours, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, wheatgerm and rolled oats in a large bowl. Mix with a spoon until evenly distributed. Set aside.\n\nCream together the butter, light brown sugar and granulated sugar until sugars are completely dissolved and no grains are apparent. Add eggs one at a time. Add the dry ingredients and fold in both mixtures until the dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in the mini chocolate chips into the cookie batter.\n\nScoop 2oz cookie dough and transfer to an airtight container. Cover and chill in fridge for up to 24 to 48 hours. My fridge is on the cold side, so it took about 12 to 15 hours.\n\nNext day, preheat oven to 375F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Transfer cookie dough onto lined baking sheets with 2\" apart of every cookie. Bake cookies at 375F for 14 minutes until light golden brown and the insides are already set but chewy and soft.\n\nRemove cookies from oven, then cool the cookies on baking sheets until cool completely. Transfer them on wire racks to cool completely and let the cookie be set and firm on the insides.\n\nGood luck making this cookie.

{"title": "Jose Peppers Jumbo Stuffed Jalape\u00f1os & Tomatillo Ranch", "selftext": "When I was 16, I worked at Jose Pepper's, and the stuffed jalape\u00f1os quickly became one of my favorite comfort foods. I remember they explained that, although they\u2019re called \u201cstuffed jalape\u00f1os,\u201d they actually use poblano peppers because jalape\u00f1os are too small to get that perfect, satisfying bite. So of course, I used poblanos in my recipe too!\n\nSince moving in 2020, I\u2019ve been on a quest to find a mock recipe that captures that same flavor and feeling I remember. After scouring the internet with no luck, I decided to try my hand at recreating it myself. These stuffed poblano peppers bring back the nostalgia of my teenage years, and I hope they\u2019ll become a comfort food for you, too. Enjoy!\n\n**For the Stuffed Poblanos:**\n\n\\- 4 large poblano peppers, halved and seeded\n\n\\- 1 cup cooked, shredded chicken (seasoned with a pinch of smoked paprika and chili powder)\n\n\\- 8 oz cream cheese, softened\n\n\\- 1/4 cup diced pickled jalape\u00f1os\n\n\\- 1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp garlic powder\n\n\\- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n\n**For the Breading and Frying:**\n\n\\- 1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\\- 2 large eggs, beaten\n\n\\- 1 cup Panko breadcrumbs\n\n\\- 1/2 tsp chili powder (optional, for extra kick in the coating)\n\n\\- Oil for frying (vegetable or canola)\n\n\n\n**For the Tomatillo Ranch:**\n\n\\- 4 tomatillos, husked and rinsed\n\n\\- 1/2 cup sour cream\n\n\\- 1/4 cup mayonnaise\n\n\\- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro\n\n\\- 1-2 tbsp lime juice\n\n\\- 1 jalape\u00f1o (seeded for less heat, if desired)\n\n\\- 1 clove garlic\n\n\\- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the Poblanos: Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Place the halved poblanos on a baking sheet and roast for 10-12 minutes, until slightly softened (this will make stuffing easier). Let them cool.\n\n2. Season the Chicken: Mix the shredded chicken with smoked paprika and a pinch of chili powder to add a smoky, grilled flavor.\n\n3. Make the Jalape\u00f1o Cream Cheese Filling: In a bowl, combine the shredded chicken, cream cheese, diced pickled jalape\u00f1os, Monterey Jack cheese, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth.\n\n4. Stuff the Poblanos: Spoon the filling into each poblano half, pressing it in to secure.\n\n5. Bread the Poblanos:\n\n   \\- Set up a breading station with three bowls: flour in the first, beaten eggs in the second, and Panko breadcrumbs mixed with chili powder in the third.\n\n   \\- Coat each stuffed poblano first in flour, then dip into the eggs, and finally press into the Panko breadcrumbs, ensuring they\u2019re fully coated.\n\n6. Fry the Poblanos:\n\n   \\- Heat about 1 inch of oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat.\n\n   \\- Fry each stuffed poblano for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels.\n\n7. Make the Tomatillo Ranch: In a blender, combine tomatillos, sour cream, mayonnaise, cilantro, lime juice, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic. Blend until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n\n8. Serve: Serve the crispy, fried stuffed poblanos with the tomatillo ranch on the side for dipping.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glfrpp/jose_peppers_jumbo_stuffed_jalape\u00f1os_tomatillo/", "created_utc": 1730945373.0, "score": 10, "author": "SpiritualReward3696", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1glfrpp/jose_peppers_jumbo_stuffed_jalape\u00f1os_tomatillo/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Updates on the queso?

The cracklings were collected after each pot of chicken was cooked and later used to make the gravy. During the sale of the company, the Colonel retained control of all the franchises in the Canadian territories, so when the new owners began to change things in the US, the franchises under his control stayed the same. Sadly, he passed away in 1980 and the Canadian stores eventually came under control of owners in the US, and all of the recipes were changed to those used by them. The current gravy is confirmed to be a powered gravy mix with some chicken fat in it, made by McCormick.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ree35kx3lw2e1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4d553bedc62cf64be46383cce9bec02cb51d0a\n\nThis is an actual page from a kitchen reference manual of the 1960s. It details the exact amounts needed to make the gravy. The \"Bag Chicken Gravy Mix\" at that time was nothing more than powdered non-fat milk (most likely Carnation brand). The break down of the recipe is, to make 2-1/2 cups of gravy, you will need 2 cups of skim milk and 4 ounces (1/2 cup) of cracklings. The break down of the 4 ounces of cracklings is, approximately 2 ounces of cracklings and about 2 ounces of oil (the same oil the chicken was cooked in). If you haven't guessed by now, crackling were nothing more than Kentucky speak for a roux. The problem with this recipe however is you must know the secret seasoning blend for success.\n\nI have made the gravy this way many times and the consistency is perfect."]}

{"title": "Specialty's Seasonal Cookies, and close copycats with improved recipes - Part 3", "selftext": "On this 3rd post are close copycats of other baked goods you had missed from Specialty's Cafe and Bakery. Most of the new baked goods were retired during new product launches. This post contains the seasonal cookies.\n\nPecan Sandies:  \n6 oz (170 grams) finely chopped pecans + 8 oz (225 grams) bread flour + 8 oz (225 grams) cake flour + 1/4 tsp (3 grams) salt + 12 oz (340 grams) unsalted butter softened at room temp + 3 oz (85 grams) powdered sugar + 1 tbsp (15 ml) vanilla extract. Powdered sugar\n\nMix together the pecans, bread and cake flours, and salt in a large bowl until they are all fully incorporated. Set aside.\n\nUsing paddle attachment, add the butter and powdered sugar in bowl of stand mixer. Cream together both ingredients until light in color and the texture is aerated and fluffy. Add in vanilla extract and mix until fully incorporated. Incorporate the flour-nut mixture at low speed, mixing just until combined. Chill the dough until it is firm enough to work with.\n\nDivide the dough into 3 equal pieces about 12 oz (360 grams) each. Roll each piece into a ripe of 8 inches in length and cut into 10 pieces from each rope.\n\nRoll each pieces between the palms to make round balls, and place them on sheet pans lined with parchment paper. Press down lightly to keep the balls of dough from rolling, but don't flatten.\n\nBake at 350F/ 175C for about 20 minutes, or until cookies are firm to touch and golden brown. While the cookies are still warm, roll them in powdered sugar to cover them heavily.\n\nGinger Molasses: [https://www.theflouredtable.com/triple-ginger-molasses-cookies/](https://www.theflouredtable.com/triple-ginger-molasses-cookies/)\n\n1/2 cup (113 gramss) unsalted butter softened at room temp + 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar + 1/2 cup (100 grams) light brown sugar + 1 large egg room temp + 1/4 cup (85 grams) Grandma's Brand Molasses + 2.5 tsps fresh ginger finely grated + 1.5 tsps ground cinnamon + 1 tsp ground ginger + 1/4 tsp ground cloves + 1.5 tsps baking soda + 1/2 tsp kosher salt + 240 grams all-purpose flour + 1/2 cup (75 grams) crystallized ginger finely diced + 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar, for rolling.  \nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar on medium-low speed until blended. Increase speed to medium and continue mixing until light and fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl with a spatula. Add egg and mix until fully incorporated.\n\nAdd molasses and mix until blended. Add fresh ginger, ground spices, baking soda and salt, and mix on low speed until completely blended in. Scrape down sides of bowl with spatula. Add the flour and mix on low speed\u00a0*just*\u00a0until a few streaks of flour remain.\n\nRemove mixing bowl from stand mixer and add crystallized ginger (if using). Use your spatula to fold in the last bits of flour and to distribute the crystallized ginger throughout the dough. Do not overmix.\n\nScoop 2 oz or 3.75 oz cookies. Roll the cookie dough balls and cover them on the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar on parchment paper lined baking sheets. Place the trays in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.\n\nNext day, thaw cookies for 15 minutes at room temp from the refrigerator.\n\n* Directly prior to baking, position oven rack in center of oven and preheat to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C, Gas Mark 4). Place a piece of parchment on a standard half sheet baking pan. Evenly space 8 balls of sugar-covered dough onto the parchment lined sheet. (I do two rows of 3, plus 2 in the center). Store remainder of dough in fridge until ready to bake.\n* Bake each sheet for 12-13 minutes. This will result in a cookie that is chewy, still moist, and slowly bends rather than snaps. If you prefer a crisper, crunchier cookie, increase baking time by a minute or two. Remove from oven and let cool on pan for one minute.\n* After one minute, carefully transfer cookies to a cooling rack.\n\nWhite Chocolate Macadamia Nut - already posted the chocolate chip cookie base that Specialty's uses - [https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gav96f/specialtys\\_chocolate\\_chip\\_cookies\\_other\\_cookies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gav96f/specialtys_chocolate_chip_cookies_other_cookies/)\n\nGood luck baking, and let me know what were the results and experiences baking these treats.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gd0k39/specialtys_seasonal_cookies_and_close_copycats/", "created_utc": 1729994208.0, "score": 26, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1gd0k39/specialtys_seasonal_cookies_and_close_copycats/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["Thank you for sharing these recipes!

{"title": "Specialty's Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate Chip, Other cookies and baked goods - close copycats with improved recipes - Part 2", "selftext": "This signature cookie from Specialty's Cafe and Bakery is what they are known for as \" it is like a granola bar in a cookie filled with crisp oats on the edges and mini chocolate chips to get your fix as something healthyish and wholesome at the same time.\" If you had eaten this cookie from them, you know what I am talking about. This is the most requested recipe from Specialty's cookie fans, and here it is:\n\nThis is one of my favorite cookies so far.\n\nSpecialty's cafe and bakery Oatmeal Wheatgerm Bran Chocolate chip cookies:\n\nThis makes 12 - 3.75 oz or almost 1/2 cup cookies\n\nStep A:\n\n7 oz Light brown sugar, packed + 10 oz rolled oats (add-in) + 3.75 oz all purpose flour + 1.75 oz whole wheat flour + 1.25 oz  and 2.25 tsps Wheat Bran Flour (add-in) + 1.25 oz  and 2.25 tsps Wheatgerm (add-in) + 1.75 tsps salt + 1 tsp ground cinnamon + 9.75 oz unsalted butter softened at room temp.\n\nCombine all of the dry ingredients like brown sugar, rolled oats, all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, (wheat) bran flour, wheatgerm, ground cinnamon, salt in a bowl of stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Mix on LOW SPEED on KA 3 or 4, BRV 3 - 4 for approximately 1- 2 minutes.\n\nAdd in the softened butter, and mix on LOW SPEED until you see pea-sized crumbles of flour mixture and butter mixed together for approximately 1 minute.\n\nSTEP B:\n\nAdd in 1 large egg and 0.7 oz vanilla extract in a small bowl. Beat them together until combined. Add liquid ingredients onto the flour butter mixture until dough comes together. If the cookie dough, doesn't come together add 1 more egg if necessary.\n\nSTEP C:\n\nAdd in 11 oz mini semisweet chocolate chips or Guittard Almost Micro chocolate chips. You can order them on the Guittard website, or Amazon. But you can use any brand of your choice (Hershey's, Baker's Choice, Whole Foods and your choice of dark chocolate chopped finely. Fold the mini semisweet chocolate chips briefly on LOW SPEED until all of the ingredients come together as a sticky cookie dough briefly.\n\nPortion the cookie dough 3.75 oz or how big you want them. Place them on an airtight container. Cover and let them freeze for 6 HOURS, or refrigerate them for at least 12 to 24 hours.\n\nNext day, preheat your oven to 350F (or 325F, if using convection oven). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.\n\nThaw portioned cookie dough for about 5 to 8 minutes. Then place 4 on a quarter baking sheet or 6 on a half sheet and allow 1 to 2 inches apart for the cookie dough.\n\nBake @ preheated 350F for 13 to 16 minutes, or if you have a convection oven 325F for 14 to 17 minutes. I use a Breville Smart oven at 325F for 13 to 15 minutes until egde of cookies are golden brown, crispy, and middle and centers are soft to touch.\n\n\\*\\* If you want to look like cubes of cookie dough. Place them on a parchment paper lined 8 x 8\" or 9 x 9\" square pan. Freeze them for 6 hours or refrigerate them for 12 to 24 hours. Then thaw them at 15 to 20 minutes, then cut them into 2.85\" squares. Place them on baking sheets and follow similar procedures baking them. Also if you are baking bigger cubed cookies allow the cookies to bake longer. I would suggest to bake 1 first, and adjust how long it goes for like 14 to 18 minutes. Take note how much time it bakes the cookies. Adjust and bake accordingly.\n\n\\*\\* Cookies are hearty, chewy, with a lot of oatmeal and mini chocolate chips gives it some wholesome feeling of bittersweet chocolate flavor embedded in this. I loved the cookie so much, I had to stop myself, and buy it rarely when I worked there.\n\n\\++++++\n\nA comparable copycat of these cookies is from [BeyondKimchee.com](http://BeyondKimchee.com) that makes the Oatmeal Wheatgerm & Toasted pecans cookies - [https://www.beyondkimchee.com/chocolate-chip-wheat-germ-cookies/](https://www.beyondkimchee.com/chocolate-chip-wheat-germ-cookies/)\n\nThis is a simplified and accessible recipe for Oatmeal Wheatgerm chocolate chip cookies.\n\nMakes 12 cookies\n\n3/4 cup all-purpose flour + 3/4 cup wheatgerm + 1/2 cup quick cooking instant oats + 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1/2 tsp baking soda + 1/2 tsp salt + 1/2 cup unsalted butter softened + 1/3 cup granulated sugar + 1/2 cup dark brown sugar + 1 large egg + 3/4 tsp vanilla extract + 1/2 cup chopped pecans + 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips.\n\n* Preheat the oven to 350\u02daF. Line a cookie pan with parchment paper or baking mat; set aside.\n* Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, oats, and wheat germ together; set aside.\n* In an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars on medium speed until fluffy. Add an egg and vanilla extract. Beat well for 2 minutes.\n* Add the dry ingredient mixture and stir until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped pecans.\n* Using a cookie scoop or spoon, take 3 tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball. Place cookie balls on a prepared pan, spacing apart about 2-inch in between.\n* Wet your fingers with water and press down the cookie balls slightly. Bake them in a preheated 350\u02daF oven for 12-14 minutes. Let the cookies rest on a pan for 2 minutes. Transfer them to a cooling rack and cool completely.\n\n\\+++++\n\nI have seen other copycats but saw other ingredients like shredded coconut that resulted in a chewy texture but not coconut flavor into it. Would not recommend that recipe, in terms of taste of what you get from Specialty's.\n\n\\+++++\n\nGood luck! on baking these cookies.

I am fine with adding a bit of MSG as long as I can get the right balance! Does anyone have a good recipe for something close to this flavor? I\u2019m also partial to Fanny\u2019s dressing (another Framingham classic!) so if anyone had a similar recipe that would also be greatly appreciated!\n\nEdit: recipes only please, I\u2019d like to improve on the ingredients once I establish a basic recipe. I am NOT looking for purchasing advice. \nAlso, I\u2019m not interested in the \u201cHouse Italian\u201d, just the plain old \u201cItalian\u201d version, without sugar. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1g0pn8e/looking_for_good_copycat_recipe_for_kens/", "created_utc": 1728585019.0, "score": 2, "author": "DR_RabidPixy", "num_comments": 15, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1g0pn8e/looking_for_good_copycat_recipe_for_kens/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I think I got a dead ringer recipe for it.

Keep in mind the ratios are for large batches but can easily be reduced to fit your personal needs. \n\n11 cups sunflower oil\n\n9 cups water\n\n6 cups tahini\n\n2 cups tamari\n\n3 cups apple cider vinegar \n\n3/4 cup of tamari roasted sunflower seeds \nground up in a coffee grinder \n\n7 Tbsp granulated garlic \n\n7 Tbsp dried parsley \n\n7 Tbsp chives\n\n2 Tbsp salt\n\n\nMix all ingredients in a large pot with an immersion blender. \n\nThis really did make a fantastic tahini dressing that most considered better than the Annie\u2019s version it was inspired by. Don\u2019t skip the ground up tamari roasted sunflower seeds, as that was the key ingredient to make it so. Hope you enjoy.\n\nEdited for formatting"]}

In a large pot, heat a drizzle of olive oil up to med-high heat. Toss in celery, carrots, and onion and saut\u00e9 for a few mins. Stir in garlic, and then add in the chicken broth immediately.\n\n2. Bring to a boil, then add in farro and reduce heat to a simmer for 20-25ish minutes until farro is cooked to how you like it. Season with salt, pepper, and chicken powder. \n\n3. While this is simmering, prepare the lemon-egg situation. Whisk the eggs and lemon juice together until thoroughly combined. You will need to temper this by adding in broth from the pot so it doesn\u2019t scramble the eggs. While constantly whisking, take approximately 1-2 cups of the simmering broth and slowly add it into the lemon egg mixture. \n\n4. Remove the pot from the heat. Once the egg mixture is tempered, add it back into the pot and stir in quickly. \n\n5. Toss in as much spinach as you want as a final step, and serve immediately.", "Made it last night. Delish!

Only ingredient that's somewhat irregular is rice flour, but you could probably leave it out.\n\nThe Cheese sauce looks to be cheddar, cornstarch, bit of milk, splash of vinegar/some type of acid, and sodium citrate.

We enjoyed watching these episodes and gives us a glimpse that these famous American candies and sweets can be replicated at home with better flavor, texture using pantry and other ingredients available at home. Of course, they are some you have to order or purchase at specialty, supermarket and restaurant supplies stores.\n\nThis post will be useful as corporations cut down costs by eliminating few ingredients, changed formulas and replaced with other ingredients. Furthermore, they sacrificed flavor over texture. Still they raised prices due to inflation circumstances. Some \"bad\" corporations do become greedy of profits over the quality of what they sell. For example, I was kind of disappointed when I tasted Hershey's new Kitkat - the new version of milk chocolate was too waxy and lost its milky, creamy texture and flavor of milk chocolate. It lost its flavor that I usually remember back in the 1980s. On 2024, It tasted like oily chocolate coating that lacked salt, sugar and some milk solids. The wafer recipe is similar. But I will be buying a more affordable chocolate biscuit filled with cream and covered with milk or dark chocolate. Or better, make my own. Or maybe buy the imported UK or Canadien candy bar.\n\nThis is a 2nd post of what you can make at home from Bon Appetit, and Claire Saffitz.

And wondered if these cookies are good for a snack or dessert attack. These are the recipes they had provided during the pandemic, if some of you love their cookies. Here are the recipes. Below you will find recipes where you can bake them in an air fryer.\n\n# Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nRecipe:\n\n* \u00bd cup unsalted butter\n* \u00bd cup brown sugar\n* \u00bc cup white sugar\n* 1 room-temp egg\n* 1 \u00bd cups flour\n* 1 tsp baking soda\n* \u00bc tsp salt\n* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Microwave the butter until it\u2019s almost fully melted. Combine with the white and brown sugar, then beat in the egg and vanilla for about 30 seconds. Stir in flour, baking soda, and salt, then fold in the chocolate chips until completely mixed together. Place them in fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Line the air fryer racks with parchment paper or foil. Use a cookie scoop (we love\u00a0[***this one***](https://www.mytoque.com/collections/utensils/products/norpro-stainless-steel-scoop-35-mm)\u00a0from Toque Blanche!) and place cookie dough in the fryer baskets. Depending on the size of the air fryer, you can most likely fit about two to five scoops on each rack.\n\n3.

Mix together butter and 1 \u00bd cups of sugar. Slowly add in eggs, vanilla, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt until fully combined. Put in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n\n2. Scoop the dough with a cookie scoop and roll the balls in the remaining sugar and cinnamon.\n\n3. Add parchment paper to the air fryer racks, then gently place dough balls on the parchment paper. You should be able to fit two to five scoops depending on how big your air fryer is.\n\n4. At 340\u00b0F, fry for four minutes, or until the edges look crispy. Remove from the air fryer, let sit for five minutes, then snack away!\n\n# Peanut Butter Cookies\n\nRecipe:\n\n* 1 stick room-temp butter\n* \u00bd cup brown sugar\n* \u00bd white sugar\n* \u00bd cup smooth peanut butter\n* 1 \u00be cups flour\n* \u00be tsp. baking soda\n* 1 egg\n* \u00bd tsp. salt\n* 2 tbsp. milk (can be non-dairy)\n\nDirections:\n\n1.

{"title": "jollibee spicy sparkle on their fried chicken", "selftext": "So on 2021, Jollibee introduced a spicy version for people who can take heat well in the US market which focuses on the chili heads and those demographics that belong in Central America, West Coast and South America and regions that enjoy hotter peppers above jalapenos, serranoes and above higher scoville units.\n\nTo tap the markets, the spicy version is what they preferred. It was marketed as fried chicken that had a spicy marinated which is in the chicken, and a spicy sparkle applied after the fried chicken has been cooked. They sprinkled spicy sparkle all over the chicken. The \"fry man\" who is responsible from applying water, then breading the chicken and frying into their pressure cookers. then responsible putting them in heat warmers that is ready for service. If you were to order spicy version, they sprinkle a spicy sparkle all over the chicken, put a spicy flag on the chicken. So servers and expediters serve the right chicken to customers.\n\nOn 2023, they changed the recipe and made a kind of a ripoff and cost-effective method to change the recipe on the spicy sparkle. They added the spicy sparkle on oil form. So instead of sprinkling it directly onto cooked fried chicken. They changed their recipe to annatto oil with added spicy sparkle  plus a cayenne pepper extract remake recipe which is applied using a spray bottle with a wide hole nozzle. A lot of people don't like it because it is not as delicious as before, and addicting and changed their spicy sparkle. This version is kind of a ripoff. Most of the time when I go to the nearest Jollibee, they just ran out of the Spicy chicken that I wanted. They just put a sign on the front counter that spicy chicken is not available until further notice.\n\nI tasted the new spicy ChickenJoy at another location of Jollibee. I didn't like the spicy version because the spiciness stayed on your tongue after you eat it and it stayed on your tongue. You had to drink a lot of soda or the pineapple quencher to wash it off your tongue.\n\nSo I have experimented a spicy sparkle that I reminisced when they had their spicy ChickenJoy in 2021 to 2023. The origins of the spicy sparkle is a very simple recipe that is derived from Taiwanese popcorn chicken sold at night markets, and a common Cantonese use of Jiao Yan or translated as salt and pepper.\n\nIt is a trade secret, so I am speculating this might be their seasoning blend for their fried chicken. I had tried it several times cooking some chicken tenders or popcorn chicken. These recipes are pretty close. The spicy sprinkle has to be applied when cooking freshly cooked fried chicken, not when you buy fried chicken. Unless if you are reheating it on a microwave or air fryer. Spray some oil over chicken, then sprinkle the spicy sparkle, and let it sit for few minutes that is ready to be eaten. However, most Filipinos and others think there's no chinese 5-spice. but the amounts are very minute in terms of their spice blend. But it is there.\n\nFurthermore, on this post I will include the breading mix, spicy sparkle and simple marinade for their fried chicken shown below:\n\njollibee's fried chicken seasoning blend:  \n7 grams jollibee fried chicken seasoning blend + 7 grams salt + 7 grams ground white pepper.\n\nHOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN FRIED CHICKEN SEASONING BLEND LIKE JOLLIBEE:\n\nhow to make your own s&b curry powder: yield: 6 tbsps  \n1 tbsp ground turmeric+ 2 tsps ground coriander seeds+1.5 tsps salt +1.5 tsps fenugreek seeds, toasted & ground, 1.5 tsps ground cumin +1 tsp orange peel dried, finely ground +3/4 tsp msg + 1/2 tsp rubbed dried sage + 1/2 tsp ground black pepper +1/2 tsp cayenne pepper or gochugaru (fine red pepper flakes) + 1/2 tsp dried thyme + 1 bay leaf, crushed + 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg + 1/4 tsp dried ground green cardamom pods.\n\nplus homemade chinese 5-spice: yield: 2.25 tsps  \n1/2 tsp ground cinnamon + 1/2 tsp ground fennel seeds + 1/2 tsp ground ginger + 1/2 tsp ground star anise powder + 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  \nCombine all of the spices in a spice grinder. Pulse for 2 minutes until they are finely grounded. Let it sit for few minutes until the spice dust settles down with the spices. Open the spice grinder. Transfer the spices into a mason jar or an airtight container.\n\nYou can use the spices for your next fried chicken adventure, or make your own japanese curry.\n\nJollibee's spicy sparkle:  \n2 tsps dark chili powder or California chile' powder + 1 tsp garlic powder + 3/4 tsp ground white pepper +1/4 tsp ground black pepper + 1/2 tsp chinese 5-spice powder+ 1/2 tsp salt + 1/3 tsp paprika +1/4 tsp msg.\n\nBreading mix:  \n500 grams all-purpose flour + 500 grams potato starch + 7 grams jollibee fried chicken spice blend + 7 grams salt + 7 grams ground black pepper + 7 grams garlic powder\n\nMarinade (old before 1990s):  \n1.5 to 2 lbs chicken (wings, drumstick, ribwing \\[both breast and wing\\], thighs, breasts) + 2 tbsps lo-salt(potassium chloride)+ 2 tbsps salt + 1/3 cup Knorr chicken concentrate\\[organic Knorr chicken bouillion powder\\] + 5 cups water + 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns + 4 garlic cloves smashed + 2-3 bay leaves. if spicy version, few drops of siling labuyo hot sauce \\[you can substitute Crystal or Louisiana for a similar spicy flavor profile\\].\n\nStir the marinade in a large bowl or cambro container. Add in all of the chicken. Cover with plastic film, or cover with lid if using cambro container. Store in fridge and marinade for 24 hours. Next day, strain the chicken and discard the marinade. Wash the chicken briefly. then return on pan lined with paper towels to pat dry.\n\nNew marinade (after 1990s and onwards):  \n1.5 to 2 lbs chicken (wings, drumstick, ribwing \\[both breast and wing\\], thighs, breasts) + 2 tbsps silver swan or lauriat or any soy sauce + 2 tbsps salt + 2 Tbsps Knorr chicken concentrate\\[organic Knorr chicken bouillion powder\\] + 5 cups water + 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns + 4 garlic cloves smashed + 2-3 bay leaves. if spicy version, few drops of siling labuyo hot sauce \\[you can substitute Crystal or Louisiana for a similar spicy flavor profile\\].\n\nsame procedure as above.\n\nStart with a very small batch to try this recipe out!\n\nIn the Philippines, there are a lot of fried chicken places that popped up as street food style. They marinate their chicken, have a variety of dipping sauces, serve it with rice which is a staple. Others serve it with java rice which is annatto oil with garlic fried rice. Others have about 5-6 dipping sauces to go while customers eat their fried chicken like Korean BBQ, Sweet and Spicy Korean, Gravy, White Gravy, Spicy Banana Ketchup, Sweet & Sour Sauce, Signature Hot sauce, Garlic Butter Sauce. Chicken is a popular meat choice over there as it is seen on many dishes. And it is cheap like chicken pieces are sold by the popular demand of the part like breast, thighs, drumsticks, wings, ribwing or airline as we call it here. The price range from $0.65 to $2. Then rice is just like $0.25. I mean a fried chicken meal is like $3 to $4.50 over there, but you get more for the buck to serve the masses. Filipinos love food so much even though if it is affordable and brings joy, and many more memories.\n\nPeople cannot afford Jollibee because of inflated prices on most goods there. Inflation on every product we consume has double all over. And Jollibee has decreased their portion sizes, made major cost-effective measures (which is a rip-off and don't patronize many restaurants that do this business practice and the products are not worth their are current value) and raised their prices. So more mom and pop businesses popped up to sell a variety of fried chicken at their cities, towns to satisfy cravings among Filipinos.\n\nAlso, if you think it doesn't taste right. Make few samples of the spicy sparkle and adjust it according to your taste buds. That way you can decipher or maybe crack the code of their spicy sparkle.\n\nIf you are still adventurous and curious about tasting what Taiwanese popcorn chicken or those huge XL chicken taste like:\n\nI will write another post about this:\n\nHere's a recipe of Jiao Yan or salt and pepper from Cantonese translation.\n\nhow to make your own chinese-5 spice powder using like Taiwan's night food market street food style:  \n1 tsp garlic powder + 1 tsp ground white pepper + 1/2 tsp chinese 5-spice powder + 1/3 tsp chili powder +1/4 tsp msg.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbnvwa/jollibee_spicy_sparkle_on_their_fried_chicken/", "created_utc": 1725763551.0, "score": 45, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 28, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1fbnvwa/jollibee_spicy_sparkle_on_their_fried_chicken/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["I\u2019m just loving how many times the term \u201cspicy sparkle\u201d appears here~\nLove Jollibee\u2019s in the Philippines but the one in NYC tastes different.

I would suggest adding the syrups directly to your espresso drinks as opposed to making their concentrates. It looks like they want to incorporate those powders for added heath benefits, and decrease the sugar by adding more cold water in their concentrates. I thought they are trying to skimp what Monin syrups taste like in reality. If you apply Monin syrups to espressos, martinis, alcohols and other mocktails. Their flavored syrups are already subtlely sweet but you can taste its natural flavor. I am against this company's recipes diluting the main flavored products by using water to decrease the food costs. But this is so cheap they made this practice for their seasonal drinks. I think this is a whole ripoff!\n\nYou could make your own blueberry concentrate by doing this instead if you wanted the full flavor of blueberries - 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries +3 oz or 3 tbsps granulated sugar or your sweetener of choice + 1/2 lemon, juiced. Cook blueberry juice until the fruit has been fully cooked and extracted. Stir until sugar has been dissolved completely and blueberries have soften and extracted their juices over medium heat for 15 minutes.\n\nStrain the blueberry concentrate with a fine mesh over a large bowl to remove any solids like the skin. Let it cool completely.\n\nI would follow the similar recipe when making the blueberry concentrate, add 12 oz cold water. Stir. Store in a squeeze bottle or tall vertical mason jar. No need to add blue spirulina and beetroot powder for additional color, but you can put it in for added health benefits.\n\nFollow this recipe for making lavender concentrate from a previous post written a few days ago :\n\nyield: 3/4 cup lavender syrup\n\n3/4 cup or 6 oz granulated or cane sugar (or your sweetener of choice)\n\n3/4 cup or 6 oz hot water\n\n2 tbsps culinary-grade dried lavender buds\n\nAdd sugar and water to a small saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring frequently.\n\nAdd dried lavender buds and stir.

They're awful, plus they don't taste at all like butter chicken! Have you tried the Butter Chicken Lady's Instant Pot butter chicken recipe?

Here's the [link](https://twosleevers.com/now-later-butter-chicken-pressure-cooker/#wprm-recipe-container-5002)  \n  \nBelow is my version with a few tweaks I've made.  \n  \n  BUTTER CHICKEN LADY'S BUTTER CHICKEN  \n  \nThis recipe is based on the one that made the Butter Chicken Lady famous, her Instant Pot Butter Chicken. I omit the salt (because I use salted butter) and the cayenne, and I use canned diced tomatoes and don't blend it.  \n  \nMakes 3 cups of sauce, and can be frozen. There's plenty of space in a 6-quart cooking vessel to double or triple the quantities and make more sauce. Keep the same cook time and release time, and use thawed chicken.  \n  \n[Sauce]  \n1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, plain (not Italian or salsa style)  \n1 tsp minced garlic (I use jarred, but fresh is fine)  \n1 tsp minced ginger (I use jarred, but fresh is fine)  \n1 tsp turmeric  \n1 tsp paprika  \n1 tsp garam masala (available in spice section at stores or Amazon)  \n1 tsp ground cumin  \n  \n1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (if frozen, add a minute to cook time; I always thaw first)  \n  \n[To Finish \u2014 after opening cooker and cooling off 5+ minutes]  \n4 oz (1 stick) cold butter, cut into cubes (I use salted butter)  \n4 oz (1/2 cup) heavy whipping cream  \n1 tsp garam masala  \n2 Tbsp brown sugar  \n1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves and small stems  \n  \n[Equipment]  \nElectric Pressure Cooker (I have a Simply Ming one; any brand should work)  \nImmersion blender (optional, I don't use it)  \n  \n[Sauce]  \n1. Place all of the Sauce ingredients into the cooking vessel of an Instant Pot (electric pressure cooker), in the order listed, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If the chicken is frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better. (I thaw mine, but still push them into the sauce)  \n2. Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes when cooking finishes. After that, release all remaining pressure safely. (I use tongs)  \n3. Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside.  \n  \n[To Finish \u2014 after opening cooker]  \n1. Once the liquid in the vessel has cooled with the lid off for at least 5 minutes, optionally blend together the sauce, using an immersion blender. If you don't blend the tomatoes, the sauce will be a little thinner but will still thicken when it cools. If you can, take the vessel out of the cooker to cool. (I like the sauce unblended so I skip the blending).  \n2. Add the cut-up stick of cold butter, half cup of heavy cream, and 1 tsp garam masala to the slightly-cooled sauce and stir until well incorporated. Add the half cup of chopped cilantro and stir again. It's important to let the sauce cool before adding the butter and cream.  Adding them into the still-boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just put it in the fridge for a little while and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  \n3. Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days.  \n4. Add the chicken back in if you like and heat through. Break or cut it up into smaller pieces if you need to but don't shred it.  \n5. Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles. Or just serve sauce, warm or cold, as a dip with warm naan. (I use Costco naan)  \n  \n[Using the leftover sauce]  \n1. Use leftover cooked chicken and mix in with the gently heated sauce, let it simmer for a few minutes for the flavors to meld together and there you go. Add some fresh cilantro on top.  \n2. You could also use this for Paneer Makhani. Defrost a cup of peas and 1 cup of paneer and mix gently into the heated sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes for the flavors to meld together and there you go.  \n3.

{"title": "Old Jollibee Recipes from the 1990s or earlier", "selftext": "So there are few Jollibee recipes that I posted which are based on these recipes circa 1990s. This might their 2nd revision but it is worth a try making your favorites: [https://www.atbp.ph/2016/06/01/jollibee-top-secret-recipes/](https://www.atbp.ph/2016/06/01/jollibee-top-secret-recipes/)\n\nThe original source came from Scribd which was taken down or deleted by the original owner. So I took this from another Filipino website that featured some of the popular Filipino restaurants, and popular food items among us before they exported their brand to other countries worldwide where OFWs and other nationalities can try their menu items.\n\nLittle did I know that Jollibee opened its first restaurant in 1998 at Daly City, CA in the US.\n\nIf you are curious what is their old original recipe, here it is:\n\nOriginal Chickenjoy:\n\nIt is said that it can marinate 1 to 2 pounds of fryer chicken pieces, but you can use wings, ribwings (airline chicken), drumsticks, thighs, and breasts.\n\n\\*Their chicken supplier is Cargill Philippines.\n\n\\*Zenith Foods Corporation is the commissary that handles all of JFC and other food brands. Their production commissary handles all  of spices, sauces, pies, noodles, ChickenJoy and other products to make popular items from Jollibee. Then it is distributed to different warehouses all over the world to their own restaurants. They are all make the marinade and marinate it here on their commissary. So we don't know specifically what is inside the marinade.\n\n2 tbsps LoSalt Reduced Sodium Salt ( you can eliminate this if you cannot find it) + 2 tbsps kosher salt + 4 tbsps MSG or Maggi Magic Sarap + 1/8 tsp garlic powder + 1/3 cup of bottled Knorr Organic Chicken Concentrate + 5 cups water.\n\nMix all of the ingredients above in a big bin. Soak and submerge 1 -2 lbs of chicken. Cover and then refrigerate for 24 hours.\n\nHow to bread and cook their chicken:\n\n8 pieces of chicken, marinated\n\n2 large eggs, beaten + 1 cup milk (mix until dissolved completely in a medium dish)\n\n1 cup all purpose flour + 1/2 cup cornstarch + 1/2 cup potato starch + 2 tsps ground white pepper + 3 tbsps salt + 1 tsp MSG (ajinomoto or maggi magic sarap) + 1/8 tsp garlic powder +  1 dash paprika (for slight red in color after being fried or cooked). Mix all of these ingredients in a deep dish until all ingredients are evenly distributed. Set aside.\n\nAdd 6 cups Crisco shortening or vegetable shortening into a pressure cooker over medium heat until it reaches 400F. It is better to fry these chicken outside at the patio or backyard to avoid burning curtains or the whole house. \n\nOr you could fry chicken on a dutch oven and preheat at 400F. Just be careful when frying, and maintain it over MEDIUM heat. You would use about 3 to 4 cups shortening when using a dutch oven depending on how large it is.\n\nSubmerge chicken onto the egg mixture, and coat the chicken and dredge until fully coated and make sure breading mix are inside the skins to make sure it is fully coated.\n\nCarefully but quickly drop your chicken, or you can put it over a spider spatula and deep fry the chicken into a pressure cooker, Close the lid and cook for 10 minutes (8 minutes pressure frying it, then release  the pressure and air inside. Then cook for additional 2 minutes to finish frying the chicken).\n\nChicken should be golden, so transfer them on a wire rack over a baking sheet to let excess oil or fat drip onto the baking sheet while it is still cooling. Repeat these procedures for the remaining chicken pieces.\n\n++++\n\nJollibee Hamburger (or Yumburger):\n\n1 pound Angus ground beef (very typical in the Philippines to buy Australian Angus beef as it is imported and cheaper than local beef) + 10 small hamburger buns + 10 Bread and butter pickle slices + 10 dried minced onions + hamburger seasoning (4 tbsps salt+ 2 tbsps Accent MSG or Magic Sarap+ 1 tsp ground black pepper + 1/4 tsp onion powder. Mix all ingredients and transfer to shaker)) + hamburger sauce (1/2 cup Lady's Choice sandwich spread + 1 tbsp UFC Sweet Banana Ketchup + 1.5 tsps Yellow mustard)\n\nDivide the angus ground beef patties into 9 or 10 equal portions form into balls. then put each ball of hamburger patty over wax paper or 5 \"x 5\" square hamburger patties, then flatten to 1/4\" thick and 4 inches in diameter patties. Stack on top of each other. Wrap with plastic film. Then freeze a  minimum of 1 HR.\n\nThe dried minced onions is similar to McDonalds where you can buy at specialty groceries, Costco, Walmart which is found on the spice aisle. You just need 2 tbsps dried minced onions : add enough cold water to cover the onions in a tupperware container. Cover and let it sit for 15 minutes until you have some rehydrated onions for assembling the burgers.\n\nMix the sauce in a small bowl until combined.\n\nCook patties for 2.5 to 3 minutes per side until grilled and well done. Don't forget to season with hamburger seasoning on each side. Transfer to plate to make your Yumburger.\n\nToast the buns over a skillet or toaster oven until light golden. Add 1 tbsp  special burger sauce and spread it onto the heel of the bun. Add seasoned hamburger patty on top. Add cheddar cheese or sliced Eden cheese. Place the crown on top.\n\n+++++\n\nChickenJoy Gravy:\n\n2 tbsps butter or ChickenJoy Shortening (when you cooked the fried chicken from) + 2 tbsps all purpose flour + 1/2 cup milk + 1-10.5 oz Swansons Low Sodium chicken broth, 1/4 tsp ground white pepper.\n\nMake a roux by either melting butter or using the cooked shortening from the ChickenJoy that you had cooked earlier). Then add all purpose flour until you make a dark brown roux over MEDIUM HIGH HEAT for 3- 4 minutes on a saucepan. Add the chicken broth and the milk until it makes a chicken gravy. Season with ground white pepper. Taste if it taste like chicken gravy, if not season with little salt. Enjoy and serve warm with fried chicken.\n\nMushroom Gravy:  \nYou can do a similar process making a mushroom gravy. Make a roux by melting butter then adding all purpose flour until the flour is cooked to dark brown. Add 1 tbsp TJ Umami Mushroom seasoning to the mix. Add milk to tighten the gravy. If you want more umami taste, add the mushroom stock from the Shiitake mushrooms after you submerge them. You can eliminate this step and just add 1 - 2 tbsps water. Season with ground white pepper, and salt. \n\nThis is great if you are making burger steaks with the hamburger patties, then putting on the mushroom gravy, and adding sliced button mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms on top served with steamed rice, or better yet - garlic fried rice.\n\nJolly spaghetti - one of the users said that this recipe comes close to 99%, and here is their take on the Jolly spaghetti. You will find most of the ingredients at Weee!, Filipino or any Asian grocery stores and supermarkets elsewhere.\n\n1 kg spaghetti noodles (Royal but another brand will do- texture is softer than Al dente which is typical Filipino preference. But you can cook al dente, if you like) + 1 cup sliced Purefoods or Martin's Tender Juicy hotdogs (the red kind but you can use beef low-sodium hotdogs), sliced to 1/4\" + 1.5 packs of White King Fiesta Sweet blend sauce + 1 small bottle of UFC (not Jufran - way too sweet than this brand) 320grams or 11.29 oz Banana Ketchup + 2 medium white onions, peeled and chopped + 4 garlic cloves, chopped + 1 cup Del Monte (tangy tomato taste) or Hunt's (thick and hearty sweet tomato taste) tomato sauce + salt and ground black pepper to taste.\n\nCook spaghetti noodles over boiling water and use some salt. The texture should be little soft than al dente. Drain the pasta water, and transfer the spaghetti noodles over an ice bath to stop the cooking process. Set aside.\n\nAdd 2 tbsps canola oil on a large pot and preheat oil. Saute' the onions until translucent, then add the garlic until golden, add the 1 kg ground beef until cooked all the way through and well done. Add the sliced hotdogs until cooked. Add the White king sweet blend spaghetti sauce, ufc banana ketchup and the tomato sauce. Stir until all of the ingredients have come together over MEDIUM HEAT for 10 minutes. Decrease heat to LOW and simmer the sauce for additional 30 to 45 minutes, then season with salt and ground black pepper.\n\nTo serve this, ladle 1 cup spaghetti noodles on a plate. Scoop 1/2 cup or more of the spaghetti sauce over the noodles. Then grate some Magnolia's Quickmelt cheese or Kraft's processed cheddar or any semisoft white cheddar on top. Serve and enjoy!.\n\n++++++\n\n\n\n \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f5aqy8/old_jollibee_recipes_from_the_1990s_or_earlier/", "created_utc": 1725064532.0, "score": 53, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f5aqy8/old_jollibee_recipes_from_the_1990s_or_earlier/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Hi, so the marinade is for 15 lbs, and then breading and cooking is for 8 pieces.\n\nSo what you're giving us is big marinade bucket, and individual fry portions.\n\nJust checking in with what you got here."]}

Just be sure before you cut them that you have either putting cooking spray on the counter or you have enough flour on the bottom side, so they don't stick to your counters. Sprinkle with garlic powder and with grated Parmesan cheese.  \n  \nI left just a little bit of room between my bread sticks and the butter came up over them as I was placing them in pan.

{"title": "Arby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread Recipe", "selftext": "So I searched on Uncle Phraedus - Hungry Browser on numerous occasions searching on secret recipes of numerous items. Here are some great find [HERE!](https://www.hungrybrowser.com/phaedrus/mainindex.htm)\n\nArby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread:\n\nthe person who shared the recipe is the person who developed the Arby's Market Fresh Sandwich Bread. i've never eaten at arby's, but i hear rave reviews about the bread  \n  \n1 cup water  \n1 teaspoon salt  \n1/4 cup vegatable oil  \n1/4 cup honey  \n1 cup whole wheat flour  \n1 3/4 cup bread flour (or all purpose flour... which is what i had)  \n1 pkg. yeast  \n  \ni accidentally doubled the recipe and made two loaves... which was a good thing, because it vanished.  \n  \nthis is a great bread and technique for a bread that children will eat, because you fool them into eating healthy. also, along this note, the dough was quite wet for me, i added a good amount of flour when kneading... i'm going to use that opportunity to add \"thirsty\" ingredients to make it healthier (oats, wheat germ, flax meal). don't let the wet dough scare you.  \n  \nthis is the technique... which is VERY IMPORTANT for the soft squishy bread i was looking for.  \n  \n1. At 10:00 pm start sponge: mix all of the water, the whole wheat flour, and yeast in a large bowl. Use a spatula or wire wisk to mix thoroughly. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit overnight in the refrigerator.  \n  \n2. Early next morning: add remaining ingredients. Mix a few minutes until well incorporated. Cover again with plastic wrap and let sit (autolyse) for 30 minutes.  \n  \n3. Knead for 10-12 minutes. Dough will initially be very sticky. After 8 minutes the dough should be somewhat tacky. If needed this is the time to adjust your water or flour depending on whether the dough appears too wet or dry. Continue to knead another 3-4 minutes until gluten is developed. Mixing times depend on the flour, the mixer, the weather, etc but you will notice a change in how the dough balls up at the point of gluten development- knead another minute or two after this point.  \n  \n4. Place in lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap. After 30 minutes gently stretch dough slightly from each side towards center like an envelope gently stretching the dough from the sided to center. Flip over, cover again with plastic wrap, let rise another 20 minutes until not quite double in size.  \n  \n5. Turn oven on to 400 degrees. Grease loaf pan. Let rest for 10 minutes. Form gently into tight loaves, place in bread pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until not quite double, about 40-45 minutes.  \n  \n6. Slash loaves with a serrated knife \u00bc inch deep on the diagonal 5 times - rather than one long center cut. This ensures a better final shape. Place loaf in the hot oven on middle rack, quickly throw \u00bc cup of water on oven floor after loading loaf. Be quick to minimize heat loss and do not hit the light! After 5 minutes open door and throw another \u00bc cup of water on oven floor. At 10 minutes throw another \u00bc cup on the floor, shut door and then lower oven to 375 degrees. Bake another 40 minutes until 201 degree internal temperature.  \n  \n7. Remove from oven. Remove loaf from pan, place on wire rack to cool.  \n  \n8. Optional: hold a cold stick of butter with a napkin and put the end on the bread covering the top of the loaf with melted butter to keep a softer crust.  \n  \n9. Optional: After two hours or so when loaf is faintly warm place in plastic bag. The tiny bit of residual heat will cause bag to lightly mist inside which will ensure a soft crust that is more child friendly. Caution: doing this too soon will result in way too much moisture so make sure loaves are just about fully cooled.  \n  \n10. Optional: slice, and freeze unused portion. Loaf will stay fresh 4 days without spoilage before you need to put unused portion in the refrigerator.  \n  \n  \nyes, this is a bit long. but i'm a relatively new bread baker and this is a combination of the help from two people walking me through the process, step-by-step.  \n  \nif a term/technique is unclear, let me know and i'll explain.  \n  \nthis makes the BEST sandwich bread that has come out of my oven.  \n  \ni got this help from\u00a0[THEFRESHLOAF.COM](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/)\u00a0the people there are awesome and willing to share ALL their secrets.\n\n+++++", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f3tt7p/arbys_market_fresh_sandwich_bread_recipe/", "created_utc": 1724905654.0, "score": 24, "author": "GreatRecipeCollctr29", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/TopSecretRecipes/comments/1f3tt7p/arbys_market_fresh_sandwich_bread_recipe/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Be sure to use unsalted butter.
