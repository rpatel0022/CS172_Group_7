{"title": "How I accidently became a healthy eater and why it's been so easy to keep doing it", "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: This post got removed from r/HealthyFood and I got permanently banned for questioning it. I am willing to risk to be banned here too. I just thought I'd share my experience. No ill will intended.   \n\\---  \n \n\nIt must have been around 3 years ago,  when I saw my girlfriend pour something like 300g of sugar into a  mixing bowl to bake a cake (that we would typically finish in one or two  days). She was following the recipe and didn't really think about it. I  don't bake much at all, so I just casually said \"whoa that's a lot of  sugar\". This was probably the first time she started questioning her  (and my) sugar intake and over the following months she started  following this health-food-movement that's been popping up all over  social media in her home country.The principles are easy: Reduce sugar,  read the labels, try to avoid processed foods. We kind of tried to do  that here and there, and she already started feeling much better both  physically and mentally. I still hadn't really bought in, because it  seemed like too much effort and I wasn't really overweight or  experiencing any health problems anyway.\n\nFast  forward to March 2020 and opportunity struck. Suddenly I am working  from home, saving 90 minutes a day on commute. Time which I can invest  to cook my own meals instead of eating Chinese take-out or hot dogs or  some supermarket-junk at work. No more coke machine in the hallway. No  more chocolate treats at the front desk when entering the office. No  after-work beers or weekends out drinking.\n\nWhen  my country first went into lockdown in March, we started making  shopping lists for the week so we'd only have to leave the house once a  week. We came up with fully planned out meal plans for the next 10 days  or so, and we started getting more and more creative. We were getting  recipes off the internet, sharing pictures with friends and family, it  even got to a competitive level when sharing our home-made food-porn.\n\nIt's also a fact that, if you're cooking from scratch, healthy recipes are way easier to make than junk food.\n\nSo  at this point we're thinking more about our eating habits and we're  checking the ingredients of all the stuff we buy at the supermarket. We  follow two simple principles: What's the sugar content per 100 grams?  Can we pronounce all of the ingredients that are listed?\n\nHere are some random facts:\n\n* The store-brand product often has less sugar and fewer artificial preservatives than the trusted brand name product.\n* \"light\" or \"diet\" products often have higher sugar content than the full-fat stuff (e.g. yoghurt)\n* soft drinks and fruit juices are basically poison\n* you  can eat as much chocolate as you like, as long as you stick to high  cocoa percentage. (50 g sugar per 100 g in your classic milk-chocolate,  13 g sugar per 100 g in our favourite store-brand 85% dark chocolate)\n* you can't eat (or drink) what you don't buy\n* your mom's christmas cookie recipe? Cut the sugar in half and try if you notice a difference. We certainly didn't!\n\nI'll  still have a can of coke here or there, but I am aware that coke has 11  g of sugar per 100 ml. For a 330 ml can that's 36 g or roughly 100% of  the WHO recommended free sugar intake per day. I won't buy more than one  can at a time, so I don't have the opportunity to consume more.\n\nAll  in all, cooking from scratch has been really fun and we have come up  with so many recipes, that we're now collecting them in our own cookbook  that we'll give away as christmas presents to our families. Our meat  consumption is down, but who doesn't love bacon... and we'll have  something like home-made wings twice a month and of course fish once or  twice a week.\n\nSince quarantine  started I lost 6 kilos without ever feeling hungry or even trying to  lose weight. The last time I had a BMI of 21 must have been probably  around age 20 (I am now in my mid-30s). I have never been someone who  works out, this hasn't changed with Covid either. I've been working from  home since March and it's really been a revelation for my physical  well-being.\n\nTLDR: Reduce sugar, read labels, profit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/k8j9d3/how_i_accidently_became_a_healthy_eater_and_why/", "created_utc": 1607356848.0, "score": 290, "author": "klaymens", "num_comments": 32, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/k8j9d3/how_i_accidently_became_a_healthy_eater_and_why/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

At the time I didn't feel like my drinking was out of control, but was noticing the effects of alcohol more in the form of bad nights of sleep, feelings on low energy and lost productivity, and beer belly that was becoming harder and harder to keep off.\n\nHere's how my drinks and dry days have trended since:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3igbu8twh8c51.jpg?width=1074&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=622693cdff2d29be4a5b416c3b35af8e0cbb3a52\n\nTo keep me on top of the tracking habit, I built Cutback Coach ([https://cutbackcoach.com](https://cutbackcoach.com/)), a simple text message system to track each drink. In the first few weeks, I was surprised to find that my starting intake was over 30 drinks a week, with just 1-2 dry days. Here's what my stats looked like in the first week of tracking:\n\n**Starting stats (week of 2/24/20)**\n\n* Total weekly drinks: 31\n* Total weekly dry days: 2\n* Alcohol calories per week: 4,650\n* Poor nights of sleep from drinking: 5\n* Money spent on alcohol: \\~$155/week\n\nThe calories and sleep metrics are the ones that really stood out to me. I was effectively adding 2 extra days of eating to my week in the form of alcohol, and costing myself less optimal sleep most nights of the week. Just this awareness served as great motivation to cutback.\n\n5 months of daily tracking later, I've been able to make a huge impact on my overall consumption, and I'm feeling the health benefits. Here's what a typical week looks for me now:\n\n**Last week's stats (week of 7/13/20)**\n\n* Total weekly drinks: 14\n* Total weekly dry days: 4\n* Alcohol calories per week: 2,100\n* Poor nights of sleep from drinking: 3\n* Money spent on alcohol: \\~$70/week\n\nTaking my first week as a baseline, the health improvements from this small behavior change have been massive.\n\n**What this means for my health (and wallet)**\n\n* I've cut calories from alcohol by 2,550 per week (basically a full day of eating)\n* I've added 2 extra nights of uninterrupted sleep to my week each week\n* I'm saving almost $100 a week that previously went to booze\n\nI still enjoy drinking, and as you can see from my trend chart above I do have heavier drinking weeks here and there.

This isn't about how my body looks anymore, this is about owing it to myself to have my brain thriving every day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - was unhealthy for a whole year. Now I'm much healthier.

The problem is.. \n\nI don't know how to cook for one, and two I don't know how to combine these properly. At all. I seem to only find info about what individual items to eat but not when/how and in what combination if that makes sense.

{"title": "My eating habits are all messed up...need someone to knock some sense into me", "selftext": "Heads up this will probably be long.  I don't think I've ever written about this in detail so I'll probably ramble.\n\nAbout me: mid 30s female.  I became aware of my weight for the first time about age 6.  My mom was heavy and spoke about it openly...so I guess that's how it got into my head.  I was average weight as a kid but got chubby in 3rd grade.  Got teased for it and kind of started to hate my body.  I also matured early so started developing around that time...got my first period at age 10 in 4th grade.  Bad acne and started getting anxiety attacks (gosh isn't puberty fun!).  My body sort of felt like the enemy.  But I was really into dancing back in those days so I had a strange dichotomy of hating my body and enjoying it at the same time.  The \"chubby\" phase didn't last too long...I was a little overweight but as I became a teenager no one seemed to be bothered by that.  I also was dealing with anxiety issues.  Those issues sometimes made it difficult for me to eat...this helped keep my weight in check but also made it so that no one wanted to mention anything about my eating habits bc they k re it was a sensitive subject for me.  In high school I always wanted to lose like 5 lbs.  I was about 5'5\" and about 140.  I think I wore like a size 8 or 10...so quite average.  I never had much in the way of boobs but carried most of my weight in my hips/thighs/butt (which probably made me look thinner than I was).  I started to feel a little more comfortable in my body during these years.... especially when I got a boyfriend and saw how attracted he was to my body.\n\nOk, so, fast forward.  I was in my 20s and my weight fluctuates a lot. My highest is probably 170 lowest is probably 130.  The low points always seem to come during periods of anxiety or heartbreak.  I'm working an office job so I don't get much exercise that way.  I try some hardcore diets like paleo and have good success but when I attempt to go back to more moderate ways of eating, I always backslide and undo everything.  I try to consistently work out but don't have much success with that.  Basically I can do hard core perfection in terms of diet and exercise for like a month at a time but after that I seem to go off the rails.\n\nSo now I'm in my 30s and things are different.  The lowest my weight has been in the last several years has been like 155.  This was after a breakup where I lost some weight.  Unfortunately I have gained all of that back plus some.  I'm now hovering around 180.  I'm still only five foot five so this is not ideal.  I've started working out more consistently and eating healthier overall... But nothing seems to be changing.  I think I'm finally facing the facts that my body has just changed, my metabolism has slowed down, and making small changes are just not enough anymore to get me where I want to be.\n\nSo where does that leave me?  I need to make some larger changes and they need to be long-term.  I have the memories of hardcore diets from years past and I don't want to go that route again.  I'd like to find a way that I can eat healthier the majority of the time and with smaller portion sizes overall.  But I also know myself well enough that, if I try to restrict myself too much, when I do take a break or a cheat or whatever you want to call it...my tendency is to go overboard and have a hard time getting back on the healthy bandwagon.  So how do I moderate that tendency.\n\nFor me I think tracking is key.  I don't really want to track calories or macros or anything... But I do think tracking certain things might be helpful.  For example, I know some people do a cheat day once a week...while I like the idea of building some flexibility into the diet from the start, one day a week doesn't sound ideal.  I'd rather just give myself 3 cheat meals a week (or something similar) that I can use when I want.  So I don't feel that binge feeling of wanting to go nuts on the cheat day. \n\n I've tried this method before and had some limited success.  But here is what happened that didn't work:\n\n1) I think there is a piece of my brain that is a little bit obsessive and a bit of a perfectionist (I'd imagine it's probably the same part of my brain that's prone to anxiety).  So there were times in the past when I had planned for a cheat meal and when the time came my brain sort of stopped wanting it...I sort of thought to myself \"let me hold off on this for now and see how much longer I can go without a cheat\".  Not a big deal in theory but I think that when I do this too much it pushes me in the direction of trying to be too perfect with my eating... Which then can lead to a binge when I make a \"mistake\".  \n\n2) I start to play games in my head about what constitutes a \"cheat\".  When I'm thinking about it logically it seems pretty obvious.  But in the moment, especially if I'm super hungry, I start to blur the lines of what I'm \"allowed\".  An example would be something like \"there were cookies at work and I had two of them... Does that constitute a cheat?  It was only a couple of cookies...no big deal\".  Or it might be something like \"I really want the salad with fried chicken but I should eat grilled chicken instead... Surely doing the fried chicken instead of the grilled doesn't necessitate using a cheat meal...it's a salad afterall\".  these are just a couple of examples but it can lead to a slippery slope or the lines between healthy and cheat are blurred.\n\nAnd that's Ultimately what fucks me up so much.  I don't like the idea that certain foods are inherently bad or good.  Food is food and my goal should just be to focus on eating healthy MOST of the time.  But my brain wants what it wants and I've learned that I just don't do moderation very well.  So if I don't do moderation well and extreme diets also aren't my thing what else is there?  \n\nI know I've been rambling for awhile now.  And I feel like overall I'm getting a little obsessed with food.  Which is completely the opposite of the goal.  Yesterday my partner and I we're talking about wanting to lose weight in the new year... And we started talking about different diet options we could do.  We started making rules for this new diet...and my first questions were about what \"cheats\" we had built in.  It seems so counterintuitive because I should be focusing on all the healthy things I'm going to do not all of the few instances where I won't do those healthy things.  But that is the way my brain goes every time I try to make these changes \n\nAnyway...enough rambling.

No more hiccups and heartburn to be seen. Also besides that I avoid drinking any liquids immediately after as well. Only a tiny sip if my mouth be feeling really dry, but other than that no liquids two hours after finishing the meals. I recommend this method to anyone who\u2019s suffering of heartburn and any other stomach issues. \nScience behind it is simple. Drinking water together with ur food dilutes the digestive juices and you end up having too much acidity in ur stomach. This is when things get bad. So do this trick to let the digestive system do it\u2019s job and you\u2019re good to go.

I began eating more fruit as a healthy source of sugar, but my silver bullet is dark chocolate. I eat 4 blocks of it most days, always 70%, and combined with fruit I no longer require pop but I still drink it occasionally if I need a boost. I mostly drink water, peppermint tea, and flavored sparkling water such as Bubbly. It has no sugar or sugar substitutes, just carbonated water and \"natural flavor\". These drinks combined with dark chocolate and fruit have changed my diet for the better. I'm 6'1\" and I went from 240 pounds down to about 205 and I look and feel a lot better.

And just letting myself get so hungry that I make bad decisions later in the day I think has been a contributing factor to my weight gain.\n\nI bought a small whiteboard which I stuck to the inside of my front door at home... And it just has a little note to myself to make sure I take my gym clothes, bottle of water, and healthy snacks with me to work.  That way I always have something healthy to snack on, water to drink so that I more easily avoid soda, and clothes to make sure I have no excuse for not going to the gym after work.\n\nToday I leveled up even further though. I went to the grocery store during the work day and stocked up on healthy snacks that I can keep in the office.  Most of it is stuff that won't go bad quickly... Some Lean cuisine individual pizzas, rice cakes, peanut butter, 100 calorie fruit and nut packages, cheese sticks, and raisins.  I'll probably also get in the habit of buying things like apples each week and keep those in the office too...but I didn't want to do that today considering it's a Friday and I won't be there all weekend.  \n\nOf course, sometimes when I have food on hand it's not appealing...but just having something so I don't get famished I think will be very helpful.

A recent study of more than [22,000 people](https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-070688) found that people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had a 19 percent higher likelihood of early death and a 32 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease compared with people who ate few ultra-processed foods.\n\nSo how do we break our dependence on ultra-processed foods? You can start by learning which foods in your diet count as ultra-processed. You don\u2019t necessarily have to give them up. But once you know how to spot an ultra-processed food, it\u2019s easy to find a less-processed substitute.\n\nAt their core, they are industrial concoctions containing a multitude of additives: salt, sugar and oils combined with artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, stabilizers and preservatives. Typically they\u2019re subjected to multiple processing methods that transform their taste, texture and appearance into something not found in nature. Think Frosted Flakes, Hot Pockets, doughnuts, hot dogs, cheese crackers and boxed macaroni & cheese.\n\nResearch shows that our bodies seem to react differently to ultra-processed foods compared with similar foods that are not so highly processed.\"\n\n*You can read the full story* [*here*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/27/ultraprocessed-foods/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=aviva)  \n*There's no paywall, although you may be asked to register for a free account.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/xpl65o/ultraprocessed_foods_are_linked_with_chronic/", "created_utc": 1664295471.0, "score": 45, "author": "AvivaLoeb", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/xpl65o/ultraprocessed_foods_are_linked_with_chronic/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

A slice of spinach and swiss quiche or a veggie frittata with some kind of fruit on the side (usually an apple, grapes, or pineapple) Sometimes I'll do tuna or egg salad made with avocado instead of mayo with salt and vinegar kale chips (made with apple cider vinegar)\n\nDinner: a quinoa bowl with roasted brussel sprouts, sweet potato, and sauteed mushrooms, onion, and garlic. A few nights a week I'll do a tuna/salmon filet in the place of mushrooms\n\nBedtime Snack: pistachios, dried cherries/blueberries, grapes, and a few slices of red pepper cheddar that I get from a local smokehouse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's pretty much the gist of it, with a little variation. A few night a week I also make \"golden milk\" which is basically coconut milk with tumeric, ginger, and cinnamon with organic maple syrup to sweeten. I also eat sourdough toast with olive oil and za'atar occasionally but try not to too often because I'm doing my best to avoid gluten/wheat (I'm sensitive to it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcome!!

{"title": "Down a dress size 15 days after Quitting Sugar", "selftext": " Last week I weighed myself and found I had lost 5 pounds after quitting the absolutely ridiculous amount of added sugar I was consuming every day. I have been looking at the sugar content of all the food and drink I'm consuming recently, and my old sugar habit was even worse than I thought. I am so embarrassed to even admit this, but on average I was ingesting OVER 200 GRAMS of sugar each day!!!!! That's 780 calories a day, or 5500 a week. I always knew, somewhere in the back of my mind that I really do not eat very much, volume wise. I also knew the food I eat is fairly healthy. I knew that being borderline obese was SOLEY down to the sugary drinks I existed on. But I didn't expect the weight/inch loss to be this immediate.\n\nAs I have mentioned before, I do not trust the scales much. But I couldn't find my tape measure. Well earlier on, I tried on this beautiful silk designer maxi skirt that I bought from a thrift store a while ago but have only worn a couple of times due to it being so small, it's size 14 AUS (18 USA). When I bought it, it went on, but I had to wear the band very high up so the zip would close. But now it fits just right and stops the perfect length just 3cms from the ground now it isn't hoiked up.\n\nI immediately searched all my drawers and cupboards, found my tape measure and was delighted to find that my hips now measure 41.3 inches, instead of the 43 they were just two weeks ago! Omg!!!! This is in just TWO WEEKS!!!! :O Crazy! I am officially a size 14 again (in most stores), and I will be able to shop anywhere without worrying if they will have my size available. I am so happy I have done this. It's very easy to not eat sugar any more, but I have just given up smoking as well, so of course I am worried that might make me gain. I will just stick to my old motto of 'if you don't buy it, you won't try it', and maybe start going to the gym if absolutely necessary.

I've started excercising again too, I do 80-100 squats wearing a 30kg weighted vest at least twice a week.  \n\n\nI have around:  \n30g sunflower seeds.  \n30g chia seeds.  \n30g brazil nuts.  \n75g gluten free rice, cooled after cooking to make the carbs complex.  \n100g sun-dried tomatoes (they some with sunflower oil but I drain most of it).  \n100g spinach.  \nand 400g chicken with a dash or two of extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nThis should add up to around 1900 calories, much less than the 2500 apparently required to stay at the same weight for a man, and yet I'm still overweight and have been since Christmas. I'm hoping the reason I'm not losing weight is because of muscle gain, any thoughts?  \n\n\nWhen I do have sugar, I must admit it's more than the recommended amount, but I only do that once or twice a week, and even then it's not ridiculously more than the recommended amount. I know the recommended max is like 9 teaspoons of sugar, I might have twice as much as that only one day of the week, the rest is generally much less per day.  \n\n\nIs that one day of the week really preventing me from losing weight entirely in spite of everything else I'm doing? Because, I might have self control, but cutting out sugar entirely is hard to fathom in the long term.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/healthyeating/comments/fd46kz/confused_as_to_lack_of_weight_loss_on_my_current/", "created_utc": 1583280357.0, "score": 26, "author": "AnOddFad", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/healthyeating/comments/fd46kz/confused_as_to_lack_of_weight_loss_on_my_current/", "html_title": ""}

So now that I've quit smoking, I've decided the next step is to eat healthy.  \n\nWhat I've Done  : I'm soda free and Junk food free as of 2 weeks ago. I've been eating a lot of protein.

Or chicken and brown rice. For dinner sometimes its eggs, wheat toast and a protein shake, sometimes its the healthy choice meals i can get from the grocery store with a banana and a protein shake. \n\nMy question: I'm wondering what other advice people would give someone who has no idea how to eat healthy and burn stomach fat.

{"title": "Can\u2019t maintain diet and it sucks. Is it worth it eating healthy??only live once", "selftext": "So for about a year or so now I\u2019ve had somewhat of an unhealthy relationship with food. 20 yrs old college student and Let me start by saying growing up , I ate tons and tons of fast food, McDonald\u2019s about a few times a week at least along with sweets.  This still weighs on my brain today and is  one of my theories as to why I\u2019m an overall anxious person and have been- I sometimes feel I have OCD and can\u2019t fathom the damage I just have done to my body for all this years. \nThis continued until I was about 16 and I started working out and eating healthy(healthier). I never overanalyzed during these few years but I did make it a point to avoid eating any sweet but I still usually ate 1 meal a day outside(healthy-ish fast food) the house while eliminating certain fast food while incorporating more homemade meats, fruits and lots of veggies. I also ate till I was 100 percent full- not like those fist sized portion size. \n      This worked out  fine for  a while until COVID hit and it was during the beginning of this that I really started to become paranoid about my health and in general. I began to feel sluggish, probably as a result of my overeating- I admit I\u2019m an emotional eater- and unintentional restriction of healthy carbs and excess protein. Among  other things I became paranoid about my  elevated heart rate and became depressed, a ton of bad stuff. \n    I then became inspired after watching that vegan documentary and became vegan for about a year- later I realized there\u2019s no evidence a vegan diet is any better- and it was at this point that I instantly began having insomnia and it\u2019s never resolved. I eventually switched back to a healthy Whole Foods diet and while I physically felt at my best, the constant feelings of deprivation really began to weigh on me.   Tried cooking for myself in my apartment but food never came out tasty or satisfying. It came to a point where eating 100 percent  healthy came at the expense of truly enjoying life  and a way to boost my self esteem- as a way to feel superior, in a way similar to how I started taking up basketball and working out from what I saw in high school with those really popular athletic kids.  You can quickly begin to see how my entire character is defined by this. \n         At what point is eating completely healthy not worth it. I feel so guilty at time seeing  how ignorant my family and friends are to this while my bum Ass sits  at home eating healthy , thinking all day about it, unable to sleeep. I know for a fact I won\u2019t feel as good if I go back to my old healthy-ish diet , knowing what I know now. But if it comes with  the improved mental health aspect, how worthwhile is it really to adopt a healthy diet??

{"title": "Ways to go meatless", "selftext": "I'm trying to think of a way to make this sound like an easier way to eat less meat and more vegetables. A lot of times, I think of soups. But my favorite soup, French Onion soup, is made with beef broth. I figured if I do a vegetarian version of this, it would encourage me to consume less meat / meat products while also being delicious. Hope it's a decent idea for you guys too, and I'll post a recipe because I believe it can be a good first step, and an encouraging one at that, for someone to make their own vegetarian recipe that tastes incredible:\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 5 Large Yellow or Sweet Onions Thinly chopped      into half moons\n* 3 Tbsp Butter\n* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 5 Cloves of Garlic Minced\n* 3 Tbsp Flour Optional\n* \u00bd Cup Balsamic Vinegar or Dry Red or White      Wine Can also use Apple Cider Vinegar\n* 2 Tsp Worcestershire\n* 6 Cups Beef or Vegetable Broth/Stock\n* 1\u00bd Cup Lentils Green or Brown\n* 1 Bay Leaf\n* 2 tsp Dried Thyme Can also use Fresh\n* Salt & Pepper to Taste\n* Gruyere Cheese Or Swiss, Gouda, Fontina\n* French Bread Or any crusty Bread\n* 1-3 tbsp of Butter and 1 tsp of fresh minced garlic for      garlic butter ( for bread)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Slice your onions in half. Next cut into thin \"half moon\" slices.\n\n2. Add butter to pan and melt. Now add olive oil and onions and stir. Cook down/caramelize onions for about 30-40 minutes over medium/medium low heat until golden brown. Monitor the onions and be sure to slightly stir for the last 5 minutes to prevent burning.\n\n3. When your onions are about 5 minutes away from being caramelized, add your minced garlic and stir. If you would like to thicken your soup at this point (optional) add 3 tbsp of flour and stir.\n\n4. If you also would like to deglaze pan, add your vinegar or wine to the pan and stir ( making sure to scrape up all the goodies on the bottom of the pan). I highly recommend this step as it helps develop extra flavor for the soup.\n\n5. Now add your stock of choice, Worcestershire, dried thyme, bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste. Be sure to look at how much sodium your stock has before adding extra salt to your soup. Add lentils and bring to a boil.\n\n6. Turn heat down to medium low and cover pot. Cook for 20-30 minutes until lentils have softened.\n\n7. Mix minced garlic and slightly softened butter together in a small bowl. Add to your bread slices. If you do not have oven safe bowls, add bread with garlic butter and sliced cheese onto a baking dish and broil until cheese has melted. Place sliced bread on top of soup in your bowl. If you have oven safe bowls, add bread directly to top of soup in bowl with cheese and add bowl to broiler. Broil until slightly golden and melted. Top with fresh or dried thyme and enjoy!
