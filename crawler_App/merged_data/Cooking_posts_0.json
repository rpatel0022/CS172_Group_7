{"title": "For the love of god, please stop bashing American Chinese food as \"fake\" or \"inauthentic\" [Rant]", "selftext": "As a second gen Chinese American myself, I am really tired of people being a complete snob over authenticity to the point that they distort the history and culture behind Chinese cuisine.\n\nI've had enough of people trashing American Chinese food as \"not the real thing\" or even worse, \"Chinese food dumbed down for American people\" (like WTF?!)\n\nWhile I don't deny that Chinese food in America is different from Chinese food on the mainland, that  doesn't make it any less worthy. Sure, it has been changed to some extent to suit local palates, but that's pretty much the same thing with Chinese food in the diaspora in general. There is also Indonesian Chinese, Filipino Chinese, Singaporean Chinese, and even Peruvian Chinese  food-yet nobody calls these variants as \"fake\" or \"inauthentic\". \n\nMoreover, people had to make adaptations to the cuisine anyways in the new land due to the lack of available ingredients that they usually had back home.  No Chinese broccoli? Use western broccoli instead. \n\n One has to remember that Chinese cuisine is by no means a monolith- it's pretty diverse with a lot of regional variations-hence Beijing cuisine is different from Shanghai cuisine and Cantonese cuisine. A lot of early Chinese immigrants to the US were from the Guangdong province, hence American Chinese food is heavily based on the cuisine from that area (albeit still a limited representation).  This is the reason why later immigrants from other parts of China might find American Chinese cuisine to be strange and completely foreign. \n\nI always have to chuckle whenever someone tries hard to demonstrate what \"authentic\" and \"inauthentic\" Chinese food is by comparing a Chinese takeout dish with Cantonese origins (ie, chow mein or orange chicken) to a dish from another region in China, which is essentially comparing apples to oranges. A good example would be this [Buzzfeed video](https://youtu.be/8vMOESJwWsg) in which the host claims to try \"authentic\" sweet and sour pork for the first time, when in reality the version that she tried is no less \"authentic\" than the one she is used to. Only difference is that the so-called \"authentic\" version is another regional variation, just like the Cantonese-style sweet and sour pork many are familiar with. \n\nWhile I do appreciate people willing to take a deeper look into Chinese cuisine beyond the menu at the local takeout, there's no need to be an utter snob about it. Food is food, peeps. It's high time that we recognize American Chinese cuisine as something unique of its own.\n\nEDIT: Holy smokes this thread did blow up unexpectedly. I'm seeing a lot of amazing input from various perspectives. Here are a few additional things I want to add\n\n1) While I did mention American Chinese food in the post and title, I was also referring to Chinese food in the western diaspora in general (including Canadian Chinese food, British Chinese food, etc.) \n\n2) Regarding authenticity, yes it is something that does exist, though at the same time it is something that is very subjective. Given the insanely diverse array of Chinese cuisine, it would be disingenuous to pinpoint \"authenticity\" as solely one way of cooking. There's no such thing as \"this is the only way to do it right\". Take Kung Pao chicken for example. While the original version in Sichuan is hot and spicy, there are also other regional versions in China that are less spicy. \n\n3) Some of y'all also talked about how some people bash American/Western Chinese food out of an identity crisis- this especially rings true for a lot of second gen Chinese Americans grappling between two cultures. On one hand, American Chinese food has been looked down on for a very long time due to the perception that it is greasy, sketchy, unhealthy, etc. A lot of second gen Chinese Americans might feel ashamed to be associated with this kind of food, so they overcompensate by going on full board with the authenticity train- trying hard to prove that Chinese food is more than just the takeout menu. A much as I detest the culinary gatekeeping sentiment, I can definitely see where it's coming from. \n\n4) I also find it interesting how a lot of people think of American Chinese food as generally heavy on the grease, starch and sugar. While I do get it's kinda explainable given that general tso's chicken, sesame chicken, and orange chicken are some of the most popular American Chinese dishes, there's also way more to that as well. Heck, even American Chinese cuisine can be vast and diverse! Of course there's also a lot of less greasy, less sugary foods like moo goo gai pan and moo shoo pork. However in my state, Louisiana, there's also yakmein and crawfish fried rice.

The label on the quarter wheel was clearly incorrect, saying that it was .42 pounds, and so was only $10.92. When I went over to the register to see if they would let me actually purchase it, it rung up as it showed on the label, and the cashier let me buy it! When I got home, it weighed 23 pounds! At $25.99/pound, that's $600 of cheese for only $11! I'm planning on giving a lot of it away to friends and family. I've cut it into ~1 lb chunks, vacuum sealed them, and split them between the fridge and freezer. What recipes should I make with my haul???\n\nTLDR: Got an incredible deal on 23 lbs of parmesan cheese for only $11. What should I make?\n\nEdit: photos https://imgur.com/a/23-lb-cheese-AEZcewy\n\nEdit 2: To be clear, during the check out process the cashier was very aware that this was an absurd price for this large wheel of cheese, and had no qualms about ringing it up as it is. Also, if you look at the website for Murray's Cheese, you will notice that they are absolutely not a Mom & Pop shop, but have hundreds of locations across the USA.\n\nEdit 3: To add some context, I actually arrived at the register without the cheese, and when the cashier asked \"anything else?\" I made a joke about \"not unless you'll actually sell me that quarter wheel of cheese for $11!\" She said \"bring it over!\" so I did, and when it rang up as $11 dollars and I was in shock, she made multiple jokes about it being 11 million dollars.

I tried Beyond Meat at a fast food place and it tasted like an overseasoned paste that left regret on my tongue for the rest of the day. \n\nVegetarian foods in America try to replace meat. MorningStar is never going to replace a prime rib with black beans. But it won't stop them from trying.\nThis is in direct contrast with asian foods (the other half of my heritage). Where vegetable dishes seem integrated into cultural norms. Hinduism and Indian food for instance. Or Thai foods, Chinese foods have vegetables take up the entire dish. These foods also are heavily influenced by auxiliary tastes. Instead of the beef talking, its aromatic spices and insanely hot peppers.\n\nI'm making sweeping generalizations. But I wonder if it's possible to create foods that are not simply lesser imitations of what you really want (fake chicken nuggies) but a mainstay dish. And if it is possible to make it simple enough for an American pallette and accessible to cooks who don't have much time. Maybe there are and I don't know about them.\n\nTL;DR Is it possible to create true vegetable focused dishes in the USA that arent trying to replace meat as the star of any given meal.\n\nEdit: Thank you for your thoughtful replies and rewards. I'll try to get to your comments!\n\nEdit 2: I want to say I do not think that vegetarians are trying to substitute meat for everything. My vegan guest certainly didn't do that and didn't throw tofu in everything to attempt to cover for meat. u/Whoisdecoy shared this in the comments and I think this guy does a much better job explaining: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mYcsM05lDk&feature=youtu.be&t=279", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jqwjzp/i_believe_most_of_american_vegetarian_foods_are/", "created_utc": 1604924098.0, "score": 11842, "author": "dreimanatee", "num_comments": 1081, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jqwjzp/i_believe_most_of_american_vegetarian_foods_are/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Unpopular opinion: Jamie Oliver is misunderstood", "selftext": "It\u2019s become very popular to bash Jamie Oliver these days, with the fried rice incidents of his. People are (rightfully) pointing out how that his food is not authentic this or authentic that. And the outrage seems to be exacerbated by the UK\u2019s long and horrible history of colonialism. Like, \u00abyou stole our spices and now you butcher our food\u00bb. But I think people are judging him on the wrong premise. I don\u2019t think making authentic dishes has ever been his point. Most people in the UK are very normal working class people with poor diets. Whose worlds are their local communities, and they do what they can to get by. And these normal, busy people are Oliver\u2019s target group. He\u2019s a champion when it comes to public health, and his goal is to get the public to make their own food and eat healthier. For them, chilli jam and soy sauce is probably exotic enough. So adding soy sauce to a dish makes it \u00abAsian\u00bb. Because that\u2019s how it is to the people he\u2019s speaking to. Had he gone full authentic, it wouldn\u2019t have served the purpose at all, as nobody would have bothered. His shows aren\u2019t meant for British Asians with a strong knowledge of the cuisine of their country of origin. And I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s offensive or wrong.\n\nI\u2019m a massive foodie, and I would never go to Jamie if I wanted to learn how to make for example pad thai.

I see that I've opened a whole new world.  I just stood in the asian grocery store and I saw what brand an asian person chose and I just chose that one.

The bell can't be considered \"sealed\" if you're using it frequently to scoop out butter, probably getting breadcrumbs in there and touching it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. It's second failure is in keeping it soft. The water is supposed to act as an insulator to keep the butter from getting cold. But it's very little water. Not much insulating power. My house has a furnace. It's a steady temperature inside. The butter wouldn't get hard on the counter even without the butterbell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Floaters. Often there are little bits of butter that fall out and float around in the water. You're not putting that slimy wet butter on your toast. That bit is getting thrown out when you clean the butterbell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Cleaning. The butterbell needs to be cleaned before you load it again. Both parts tend to get messy. Put it in the dishwasher and take it out 12-24 hrs later you're ready to load it again except wait-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- (of course the butter dish also needs cleaning but the next part is what makes the cleaning so aggravating)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. Loading it with butter. You can't  load it with cold butter from the fridge. Did you remember to take it out and let it warm up first? No? Okay so now that the bell is cleaned you can put a stick of butter on the counter until it's soft. But it's dinner time and you just chopped the onions. you don't have time to mess with that: you need some butter now ready to go, so you take some butter right off the stick.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Now that you have some time to load it up you grab a butter knife and scoop it in. This part is fun actually. Smushing it all up in there and swirling the butter knife just right to give it a little spiral shape. But the bell holds somewhere between 1 and 2 sticks so\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Get another half a stick out? Or just use what you have in the butterbell until you repeat the process? Or leave out a full 2nd stick to soften but only load half? Seems like you can never get just the right amount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. You can't fit the spatula into the bell to scoop out butter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. The water will sometimes slosh out of the bell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10. With all this hassle, most of the time the butter just sits in the wrapper on the counter raising the question: Why do we even need the bell?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for all the hate. Thank you for listening to me. My wife loves the thing because it's cute and it's ceramic. For her that's all that matters. I can't tell her I hate it because it will break her sweet heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: #11 - Now I'm  reading that you're supposed to change the water every 2-3 days?

It details 8 methods for preserving and protecting foods, and it's a follow-up to my post last week on [acidity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/m06qvh/acidity_is_not_a_single_flavor/).\n\n^(Disclaimer: This post was written while consulting reams of regulatory and industrial food safety documents, but I\u2019m not an expert. If you disagree with anything, please comment with a source so I can research further. Thanks!)\n\n# WHY CARE ABOUT FOOD SAFETY?\n\nThe CDC estimates that foodborne illnesses cause 48 million people to become sick, 128 thousand people to become hospitalized, and 3 thousand people to die each year in the US alone.\n\nThese illnesses occur after harmful microorganisms (e.g. molds, bacteria, and parasites) or viruses (e.g. norovirus) contaminate food. Norovirus, salmonella, and clostridium perfringens are the most common known pathogens each year, and foodborne illness from *unknown* pathogens are four times as common. Meanwhile, illnesses such as botulism are infrequent but deadly.\n\nWhen you consider that the average person in the US is primarily eating consumer goods that have passed the standards of the FDA, these numbers are staggering. With our regular consumption of highly engineered products, it can be easy to carry on without realizing how and why specific foods are safe and for how long.\n\nAs a home cook, you probably deviate from FDA guidelines all the time. But you can only be so ambitious before you drive off the rails of presumed safety and enter dangerous territory. That\u2019s where this guide comes in.\n\n# FOOD SAFETY PROCEDURES\n\nContamination from pathogens that cause food spoilage and foodborne illness can occur prior to, during, or after the cooking process. And contrary to popular belief, many of the worst pathogens cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted.\n\nFood safety procedures are our best defense against these pathogens. They aim to either:\n\n* **Kill or remove** ***existing*** **pathogens in food**. These pose the most immediate risks.\n* **Prevent the growth of** ***new*** **pathogens in food**. This is especially important for foods that you aren\u2019t eating right away (e.g. food you are storing or cooking over multiple hours).\n\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with some food safety best practices (e.g. avoiding the temperature danger zone). But you\u2019re probably also aware of seeming contradictions to those best practices (e.g. *why can bread or jam be kept in the temperature danger zone?*).\n\nIn the content that follows, I attempt to equip you with what you need to know to put it all together and make sense of these seeming contradictions. Specifically, we\u2019ll cover the 4 primary methods for preventing foodborne illness:\n\n1. **With cleanliness**: Some harmful microorganisms and viruses can\u2019t spoil food if you wash them away.\n2. **With temperature control:** Harmful microorganisms and viruses can\u2019t survive at very high temperatures, and microorganisms struggle to survive at very low temperatures.\n3. **With acidity:** Harmful microorganisms can\u2019t grow under highly acidic conditions.\n4. **With water activity**: Harmful microorganisms can\u2019t grow with low water activity.\n\nI\u2019ll detail other methods as well in less detail. The guide will start with the most commonly-used methods, though I have a hunch that the later methods (e.g. water activity) will be more useful to my audience. Let\u2019s do it.\n\n# 1. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH CLEANLINESS\n\nThis is the most boring and obvious food safety method, but stick with me. This method deserves top billing because it is the best means for preventing norovirus, which is the leading cause of foodborne illness.\n\nNorovirus primarily spreads through surface-level food contamination (e.g. via fruits and vegetables grown in contaminated water or via shellfish harvested from contaminated water) and people (i.e. others already infected with norovirus). Simply maintaining clean hands, a clean prep station, and clean equipment can make a huge difference in preventing spread of the virus.\n\nNote that this advice does not apply to washing chicken. Washing chicken can actually *increase* bacteria risk (by spreading salmonella to parts of your kitchen that are not typically heated to salmonella-killing temps). Which brings us to...\n\n# 2. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH TEMPERATURE\n\nPathogens struggle to survive at very low or very high temperatures.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new pathogens***\n\nAs a rule of thumb, new harmful microorganisms can only grow between 40\u00baf and 140\u00baf. That\u2019s why we call that range the **temperature danger zone**. Food that is not otherwise preserved should stay out of the temperature danger zone (either warmer or colder). If your food *must* be in the temperature danger zone, it should be there for less than 2 hours total (including the time to warm up or cool down your food).\n\nThat means you can pretty much keep food above 140\u00baf indefinitely without new harmful microorganisms growing. It also means you should keep perishable foods below 40\u00baf, though some common microorganisms can still survive this. Pyschrophiles (which is greek for \u2018cold loving\u2019) can survive up to -4\u00baf, and they are often why your food spoils over time even when it is in the fridge.\n\nIn reality, the stated temperature danger zone includes a margin of error. In California, for example, food safety guidelines deem the temperature danger zone from 41\u00baf to 135\u00baf. In Australian regulations, foods can be kept below 140\u00baf for 4 hours (rather than 2) provided they are used or served immediately.\n\nThe differences lie in risk tolerance. The actual temperature where harmful bacteria fail to grow is closer to 126.1\u00baf, but this temperature is dangerously close to the temperatures where bacteria grow most rapidly. Without a highly calibrated and consistent heating device, keeping your food at that low a temperature is dangerous. For this reason, you\u2019ll often see recommendations where food can be kept at 130\u00baf if cooked sous vide (on a calibrated device) but 140\u00ba otherwise.\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nMany of a food\u2019s existing pathogens will not immediately die if exposed to temperatures below 40\u00baf or higher than 140\u00baf. For that, you generally need either a higher temperature or more time at a controlled temperature.\n\n* **Higher temperature**: Each pathogen has a temperature at which it will immediately die. Salmonella will die when exposed to temperatures exceeding 165\u00baf. That\u2019s why we were traditionally told to cook a chicken to 165\u00baf. Norovirus dies at 145\u00baf. The bacteria that causes botulism can survive temperatures up to 250\u00baf (which is why low acid shelf-stable foods are canned under extreme heat).\n* **Not as high temperature + more time**: If you can hold food at a consistent temperature, you can rely on temperature *and* time to kill microorganisms at a lower overall temp. For example, salmonella will also die when brought to 140\u00baf and then kept at that temperature for 30 minutes (or at 130\u00baf for 6 hours). That\u2019s why we can cook chicken sous vide at lower temperatures than 165\u00baf provided we cook it for long enough. [Here](https://www.douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html)\u2019s an extremely detailed guide if you want to learn more about this time/temp relationship for different foods.\n\nDifferent foods require different temperatures to pasteurize because foods have varying risk levels when it comes to their existing pathogens. Chicken, for example, is highly susceptible to salmonella while beef and fish (and even duck) are not. This is in part because beef and fish generally come from whole-muscle cuts and so are less exposed to surface contamination. Ground beef, meanwhile, is not a whole-muscle cut, and so surface-level pathogens are distributed throughout the meat. Chicken is also more susceptible to salmonella because it is generally raised in nastier conditions than beef, fish, and duck.\n\nKeeping food at sub 40\u00baf temperatures (including below freezing) isn\u2019t a great way to kill existing microorganisms and viruses, because some of the worst bacteria (such as the ones that cause botulism) and norovirus can survive at extremely low temperatures.\n\n***To kill parasites in raw fish***\n\nParasites (such as those found in raw fish) can also survive at low temperatures, but they *do* die after enough time below freezing. Specifically, these parasites die after either 7 days at -4\u00baf or 15 hours at -31\u00baf. Your freezer likely doesn\u2019t go that low.\n\nIn many jurisdictions (even some home to 3 Michelin star sushi restaurants), it is illegal to serve raw fish without freezing it first. Industrial flash-freezers are used by the restaurant industry to freeze fish at extremely fast speeds to maintain quality.\n\nDifferent fish have different parasite risks based on their build and dietary habits. That\u2019s why shellfish, certain species of tuna, and certain types of farm-raised fish are often exempt in jurisdictions where freezing raw seafood is otherwise required.\n\n# 3. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH ACIDITY\n\nHarmful microorganisms cannot grow under highly acidic conditions. This is particularly relevant for sauces, drinks, and fermented foods.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new harmful microorganisms***\n\nAny food substance that measures 4.6 or lower on the pH scale is generally considered acidic enough to prevent growth of harmful microorganisms and can be kept at room temperature.\n\nThis is why you can ignore the temperature danger zone for your vinegars (2.5 pH) and lacto-ferments (3.6 pH) with adequate acidity. While acidophile bacteria (like lactobacillus) grow at this temperature, they are generally safe.\n\nIf you\u2019re making a dressing, hot sauce, or lacto-ferment, it\u2019s worthwhile to measure the pH before you deem the food shelf-stable. Thankfully, measuring pH is easy and pH strips are super cheap.\n\nIf you make a sauce that doesn\u2019t measure to 4.6 pH, you can simply add more vinegar or acid powder until the pH measures low enough.\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nAcidity is not an effective means for killing harmful microorganisms or viruses. Instead, acidity merely slows their flow; as soon as microorganisms are returned to neutral water, they regain mobility.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s a common misconception that ceviche is \u201ccooked\u201d by citrus juice. The proteins are denatured as if they were cooked, but existing bacteria won\u2019t die.\n\n# 4. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH WATER ACTIVITY\n\nHarmful microorganisms cannot grow with low water activity. This is particularly relevant for low acid foods, dried food products, nut butter, miso, garum, ganache, and jams.\n\nWhat\u2019s water activity? It\u2019s not moisture content. Instead, water activity is how free the water in a food is to be utilized by other stuff. Since microorganisms need water to function, when the water in food is bound to other ingredients (such as salt or sugar) in a way that microorganisms can\u2019t utilize it, the microorganisms can\u2019t function. Picture water in a bowl as totally free, but water in a sponge as partially bound by the sponge.\n\n***Measuring water activity***\n\nWater activity can be measured with a machine: a water activity meter. Water activity meters produce an output that is a ratio between 1.0 (high water activity) and 0 (no water activity). A water activity of 1.0 means that the vapor pressure of the food is equal to the vapor pressure of pure water. A water activity of 0.8 means that the food has 80% of the vapor pressure of pure water.\n\nMost foods have a water activity above 0.95. Fresh meat and vegetables have a water activity of 0.99.\n\n***To prevent the growth of new harmful microorganisms***\n\nGenerally, items with a water activity level of 0.85 or lower don\u2019t require refrigeration. Mold growth is still possible (though difficult) at water activity levels as low as 0.6, but the FDA only enforces 0.85. This is why you can store soy sauce (0.8) and peanut butter (0.7) at room temperature.\n\nYou can get away with higher water activity levels if keeping your food out of the temperature danger zone. For long term storage in a fridge, it\u2019s still recommended to keep water activity levels below 0.93 (the level where the bacteria that cause botulism fail to grow).\n\n***To kill existing pathogens***\n\nLike acids, low water activity does not kill existing microorganisms or viruses.\n\n***To decrease water activity***\n\nThere are many ways to decrease the water activity of your food:\n\n1. **Adding salt:** Salt is the primary reason why soy sauce is self-stable. Enough salt has been added to soy sauce that the liquid cannot be utilized by harmful pathogens.\n2. **Adding sugar**: Sugar is the primary reason why candies or low-acid jams are shelf-stable.\n3. **Adding other humectants**: Specialized products can decrease water activity without adding saltiness or intense sweetness. Shelf-stable ganache, for example, often utilizes one or more of glucose syrup, sorbitol, dextrose, or glycerol to reduce water activity without making it too sweet.\n4. **Freezing**: Water activity decreases as temperature decreases. Freezing foods will prevent future microorganism growth.\n5. **Removing water content**: Completely removing moisture (e.g. via dehydration or freeze-drying) is a straightforward means to reduce water activity.\n\n***To achieve low water activity without a water activity meter***\n\nWater activity meters are very expensive, but there are multiple methods for safely reducing water activity without a water activity meter. I'm not going to share these here because this is already very long, but feel free to visit my blog if you're interested.\n\n# 5. FOOD SAFETY THROUGH OTHER MEANS\n\nI\u2019ve described the most common methods that home chefs might use to rid their food of unwanted microorganisms and viruses. But there are other food preservation methods as well:\n\n* **Alcohol**: High alcohol percentages destroy bacteria. 70% alcohol is enough to destroy many harmful bacteria upon contact. Lower alcohol percentages will prevent future growth, but the specific percentages for this job are very dependent on other factors.\n* **Packaging techniques**: High temperature canning or aseptic packaging techniques are means to create a hermetically sealed environment where no bacteria exist and no bacteria can enter. These techniques involve sterilizing (via heat in excess of 250\u00baf) both the container and the food inside such that the product can be kept at room temperature until opened. This is essentially the same approach as confit food storage, too.\n* **Osmosis**: Osmosis can destroy certain bacteria. For example, via osmosis, salt helps to destroy certain bacteria in the early days of a lacto-ferment before the acidity has decreased enough to kill the other unwanted bacteria.\n* **Oxygen or lack thereof**: Bacteria and molds are either aerobic (need oxygen) or anaerobic (need absense of oxygen). When you submerge foods in liquids in a lacto-ferment, you\u2019re preventing aerobic bacteria and molds from taking hold. This is partly why a homemade miso might grow mold on the top but not further down. Some of the worst bacteria \u2014 such as those that cause botulism \u2014 are anaerobic, so I\u2019ve added a section on anaerobic environments below.\n\n# ON COMBINING METHODS\n\nThe above techniques can work together to achieve added effectiveness, reduced salinity or acidity, or less stringent temperature requirements. This is how something like shelf-stable low sodium soy sauce is possible. For example, foods with pH of 5.0 are shelf stable when water activity is 0.9 or lower.\n\n# ON ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENTS\n\nBotulism is rare, but it can be fatal \u2014 so it\u2019s worth spending a bit of time on avoiding the contributing bacteria: clostridium botulinum.\n\nClostridium botulinum is anaerobic: it needs the absense of oxygen to survive. Cooking environments that lack oxygen include liquids (e.g. brines or oils), sealed cans, and sous vide bags. Any time you store foods like vegetables (e.g. garlic), fish, and meats in these environments, you need to pay particular attention to time and temperature (or acidity) to prevent clostridium botulinum from taking hold.\n\n***To kill clostridium botulinum***\n\nClostridium botulinum dies at much higher temperatures than other harmful bacteria. To reduce clostridium botulinum to safe levels, bring the food to 250\u00baf (or to 167\u00b0f for 520 minutes, 176\u00b0F for 75 minutes, or 185\u00b0F for 25 minutes).\n\n***To prevent the growth of clostridium botulinum***\n\nThe best way to avoid botulism growth is to keep your food out of the temperature danger zone. This means that storing garlic in olive oil is not a good idea.\n\nEven foods stored in the refrigerator are at risk of future clostridium botulinum growth if the bacteria was not completely destroyed before refrigeration. Foods kept in anaerobic environments should not be kept at at 38\u00b0f for more than 30 days or below 36.5\u00baf for more than 90 days.\n\nAlternatively, you can prevent future bacteria growth by ensuring the food has a pH lower than 4.6. Lacto-fermentation for example is an effective means to prevent botulism in anaerobic environments.

{"title": "Egyptian falafel are made with fava beans, which makes tastier, crispier and lighter falafel than chickpeas. They've won many awards and are pretty easy to make at home. Full recipe inside and I'll also teach you about stuffed falafel", "selftext": "It's safe to say falafel has taken the world by storm. Other than Hummus, it's the most widely known Middle Eastern food and for good reason. The bite sized fritters are extremely crisp and if done right, they're packed full of flavour. Apart from being vegan, they're also incredibly cheap to cook and so they make for a great filling meal on a budget. It's my opinion that falafel made with fava beans are better than the more common chickpea falafel ([Photo proof here](https://imgur.com/a/NzlQGMs)), and it may just be the original ingredient historically used in falafel. It's a matter of contention that can cause rifts between Egyptians (Fava falafel) and Levantines (Chickpea falafel), however [competitions](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/04/the-falafel-battle-which-country-cooks-it-best) and [critics](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190715-does-egypt-have-the-best-falafel-in-the-world) have confirmed this [over](https://pulses.org/updates/488-winner-of-london-falafel-festival-competition-recounts-event) and [over](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/en-espanol/sdhoy-egypt-wins-inaugural-london-falafel-festival-2016may04-story.html) again. The resulting falafel have a [crispier exterior, fluffier interior, lighter texture](https://imgur.com/Sp2caGH) and are just way more flavourful. To top it all off, they're [a lot easier to cook](https://imgur.com/fnAhQnb) and if you use this recipe, you can say good bye to falafel that fall apart when frying. \n\n#### As always I have a [full video recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY) where I go into all the details and show off the special techniques that I mention below. If you enjoy the post I'm sure you'll also like the video.\n\nIf you just want the recipe ctrl+f for \"Ingredients\"\n\n## What is Falafel and how is Taameya different\n\nIf you've not had falafel before; they're deep fried fritters that are [usually made from ground chickpeas](https://zaatarandzaytoun.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-21-at-17.46.46.jpg). This Middle Eastern food is as synonymous with the region, as Pasta is to Italy, and it's become one of the most popular vegan foods in the world. Traditional falafel is made with lots of fresh herbs and onions, which give them a bright green colour as well as a fresh and herby flavour. For the most part falafel is considered a breakfast or lunch food, and most people in Egypt (and the Levant region) will eat [falafel sandwiches](https://imgur.com/qgFhLfT) at least 2-3 times a week. The popularity comes down to a few factors, the flavour, it's price and how filling it is. Firstly it's extremely cheap to make falafel, and while you might get charged $7-10 for a [good falafel sandwich](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sFqzHGi3qqWyysQx6EYDZSy1KY=/1400x1400/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13689423/Zooba_4.jpg) (about \u00a38 in the UK), they usually cost about 10c or less in the Middle East and you can probably make 40 pieces for less than $5 ($1 in the Middle East). Secondly, they are packed full of flavour, all the herbs and onions give them a fresh taste, while the addition of coriander, garlic and cumin give them the perfect amount of spice. Finally they're a nutritionally dense food which help keep you full, you've got a decent amount of fibre and protein, but also quite a lot of macro-nutrients and let's not forget the fat from their frying.\n\nEgyptian falafel (or as it's called in most of Egypt, Taameya) is a bit different from the falafel you're probably used to, as nearly all falafel sold in Europe and the US is Levantine falafel. The main difference is that it is made with [split fava (broad) beans](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) rather than chickpeas (garbanzo beans) and this has a significant impact on the texture of the falafel. If you've ever tried to cook chickpea falafel yourself, you'll know that when the chickpeas are ground they develop a [super fine chopped texture](https://www.seriouseats.com/images/2016/03/20160323-falafel-recipe-01-composite.jpg) that almost resembles bulgur. It can sometimes have a hard time binding together which can lead to them falling apart when you fry them. To get around that, many people add binders such as flour or eggs to their falafel, but that has the negative effect of making the centre of the falafel dense and stodgy. Fava beans on the other hand [turn into a paste](https://imgur.com/bvtCkf1) when you process them. Rather than having very finely minced chickpeas as the base of your falafel, the fava beans are already bound together and so they are able to hold their shape naturally. The fava bean batter also ends up wetter than the chickpea batter, this causes more steam to evaporate when frying which gives it an airy texture. The traditional way of making Taameya involves grinding the beans in a mechanical pestle and mortar, [which also has the added effect of whipping air into the batter](https://youtu.be/c_AU4Sc_fMQ?t=185). To emulate this you can use the beater attachment on a stand mixer, which will [incorporate even more air](https://imgur.com/N7mx3En) and you'll end up with falafel that are light enough to float when frying (they'll still be great if you dont do this).\n\nApart from the texture, Egyptian falafel also tastes different from Levantine falafel. In Egyptian falafel, Kurrat (a species of wild leek native to Egypt) is used in place of the onion, and it imparts a leek like flavour with sweet and mellowed onion notes. To replicate that flavour, a combination of Spring Onions and leeks work really well. In terms of herbs, the batter also needs fresh coriander, parsley and garlic, then it's seasoned with Ground Coriander, Cumin, and Chilli powder. As opposed to the [ball shape](https://imgur.com/tGgWzEu) of most falafel, Taameya is usually shaped into a [hockey puck](https://imgur.com/op2g5nS), and the exterior is coated with sesame and coriander seeds. This shape means you get more crispy surface area but it also allows the insides to cook quicker (they also fit better in sandwiches). Of course this can still be made into the classic ball shape, and the great thing about this batter is that you can just [use an ice cream scoop](https://imgur.com/fnAhQnb) without manually shaping to get your falafel in the hot oil.\n\nThere's a few other types of falafel that we make in Egypt, but the one I think you should know about is stuffed Taameya. These are filled with a spicy onion filling that is made by sweating onions with Harissa and Tomato paste. When placed in a sandwich, they have that perfect spicy balance that you'd usually try to get by adding hot sauce. We also make a Taameya omelette that we call Egga, this is just Taameya batter mixed with a few eggs before frying. It has a strong herby flavour in comparison to a regular omelette and it's a good way to use up any leftover batter. The best way to serve Taameya is in a sandwich. These are typically made with a flatbread similar to pitta, and are accompanied by a tahini sauce and a simple salad. We usually eat this with salty turnip, carrot and cauliflower pickles called [Torshy](https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000628636335-wiqf3p-t500x500.jpg) (Torsu in Turkish), or some pickled fried aubergine. \n\n## Cultural Context\n\nThere are a lot of theories about where and how Falafel or Taameya originated, and it's a very charged topic with most countries in the Middle East claiming to have invented it. The truth is no one really knows where falafel originated but it's very likely that it has an [Egyptian Origin](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/falafel). Many Egyptians will say that falafel is a Pharaonic food and that the consumption of fava beans was common place in ancient Egypt, however the practice of deep frying falafel would have been difficult without refined oils. Another favourite theory is that it was first eaten by Coptic Christians as a meat alternative during their fasts, but there isn't any evidence to back this up. The most likely theory is that was invented during the British Occupation of Egypt as the first recipe for falafel appears around this time. One historian claims it may have been inspired by the Indian dish parippu vada, which is like a falafel but made with green peas. This theory holds a lot of weight with me, particularly because the British occupation of Egypt also lead to the creation of [Koshari](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ik05j7/koshari_is_an_egyptian_dish_that_exemplifies_the/), which itself was an Egyptianization of the Indian dish Kichidi. \n\nThe theory goes that as falafel spread outwards from Egypt, the ingredients that were used also changed based on their availability. The chickpea replaced fava beans in the levant and the spices changed with it. If you're wondering why you've never heard of fava bean falafel, it's probably because nearly all Middle Eastern restaurants in the US and Europe feature a Lebanese menu.\n\n## Flavour Profile\nThis recipe will make Taameya with a herby and fresh flavour that is way beyond anything you could buy premade. The Coriander, parsley, spring onions and leeks all merge together to give the falafel a bright and strong herb flavour with notes of sweetness from the leeks. The cumin and Ground coriander give it that background heat flavour (not spicy) and if your Ground Coriander is very fresh, it will also give a tart citrussy background flavour. You'll also notice this in the topping which coats the exterior of the Taameya, and combined the sesame seeds it adds some crunch.\n\nIn terms of texture, the Taameya is very light and fluffy. The interior will be airy and a bright green colour, whereas the exterior will be crisp and dry making for a satisfying bite. Adding them into a sandwich with some Tahini sauce, and a tomato and cucumber salad turns them into a sensational meal. I'd recommend using fresh homemade pitta bread for the sandwich and making a tahini sauce with lemon and garlic.\n\n## Ingredients:\n\n### Taameya Batter\n* 400g Split Skinless Fava beans. You need the [bag on the left](https://foratasteofpersia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSCF5930-scaled.jpg) not on the right. The left has the skins removed and if you make this with the skins the recipe WILL NOT work\n* 100g Spring Onions  \n* 100g Leeks  \n* 50g Coriander leaves\n* 50g Parsley  \n* 4 Cloves of garlic  \n* 2 Tsp Ground Coriander  \n* 1 Tsp Cumin  \n* 1 Tsp Cayenne  \n* 2.5 Tsp salt  \n* 1l (1 quart) vegetable oil for frying  \n\n### Harissa Filling\n* 1 Medium Brown Onion  \n* 1.5 Tbsp of Harissa  \n* 1.5 Tbsp of Red Pepper or tomato paste  \n* 1 Tbsp of Olive Oil  \n* 1/4 Tsp Cumin  \n* 1/4 Tsp salt  \n* 1/4 Tsp Pepper  \n* 1/4 Tsp Ground Coriander  \n\n### Topping\n* 1/4 Cup Coriander seeds  \n* 1/4 Cup Sesame  \n\n## Directions: \n\nI highly recommend watching the video for more precise directions and because there are some techniques for shaping that can only be explained visually https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY\n\n### To make the falafel batter:\n1. Wash your split fava beans thoroughly with cold water, then place in a bowl and cover with a large amount of water. Allow them to soak for a minimum of 8 hours until doubled in size  \n2. Once doubled in size, drain the fava beans and set them aside  \n3. Wash your leeks, spring onions, coriander and parsley, then roughly chop them up to a managable size for your food processor. Use the white part of the leek and while of the spring onion\n4. Add all of the greens to your food processor and add the beans on top (The weight of the beans will help force the herbs into the blade, and it's a lot quicker than putting the herbs on top of the beans)  \n5. Process everything until a finely minced paste forms (about 2-3 minutes), making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Once it looks homogenous and fairly well minced add the salt and spices  \n6. Continue processing together thoroughly until well combined then set aside  \n\n### To make the stuffing:\n1. Chop your onion into a small dice, then place in a pot over medium heat with 1 tbsp of olive oil  \n2. Saute for about 5 minutes until the onions start to soften then add the Harissa, Red Pepper paste and the seasonings  \n3. Add a small amount of water to form a sauce, then allow it to cook down and thicken (about 15 minutes of cooking time)  \n4. Repeat adding water and allowing the topping to reduce until the onions and sauce are cooked through  \n\n### To make the falafel topping:\n1. Using a pestle and mortar, lightly crush the Coriander seeds till you can smell their aroma. You should split most of the seeds in half but you don't want to grind them into a powder  \n2. Combine the coriander seeds with the sesame and it's ready to use  \n\n### To whip up the batter:\n\nAdd about a quarter of the batter to a stand mixer, and whisk it with your paddle attachement on medium speed for about 5 minutes. When it is light and fluffy it's ready to be used. Use the whipped mixture immediately as it will deflate quickly. If you don't have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer, or the whisk attachment on your food processor. A blender may also work and manually whisking it might help. If you can't do this step at all, you can add a 1/4 tsp of baking soda to each cup and a half of batter and whisk it in. That will help fluff it up slightly  \n\n### To shape the falafel:\n1. Wet the palm of your hand or a piece of parchment paper, very lightly  \n2. Place about 2-3 Tbsp (or 1 ice cream scoop) of Batter on the paper/your hand then lightly flatten it using your other hand. Apply very little pressure as you don't want this to end up very thin  \n3. Wet your second hand and press it into the topping, then lightly press the topping to the batter so it sticks  \n4. Flip your Ta'ameya onto your second hand or another piece of parchment paper then apply the topping to this side as well  \n5. Fry the ta'ameya within 5 minutes of shaping otherwise it will deflate\nNOTE: If you are doing this on your hand directly, you'll have to put them in the oil straight away. This can be a bit dangerous as you'll need to get your hand very close to the oil, but if you're comfortable, this technique works amazing. See [the video](youtube.com/watch?v=PdGMnAt2sRY) for the visual technique.\n\n### To shape the falafel the easy way:\n1. Using an ice cream scoop, fill the scoop with batter, then scrape off any excess  \n2. You can dip the top of the scoop into the seeds or you can add them to the scoop before filling it  \n3. Release the falafel directly into the oil  \n\n### To stuff the falafel:\n1. Repeat steps 1-2 from \"To shape the falafel\", using about 2/3rds of the batter amount  \n2. Place about a teaspoon of filling in the centre of the batter and flatten it out  \n3. Add the remaining 1/3rd of batter on top then join the two sides together  \n4. Add the topping to both sides or leave plain to differentiate it  \n\n### To fry the falafel:\n1. Heat your oil to 160c or 320f, then add your falafel in  (I'd recommend using an oil thermometer here, too hot will undercook the falafel and too low will allow it to absorb more oil)  \n2. Once in, baste the top immediately with hot oil so it solidifies. I'd recommend using a spoon to splash them with oil and this prevents the falafel from deforming or falling apart  \n3. Fry the falafel for 2-3 minutes on the first side  \n4. Flip over once browned underneath then fry for another 2-3 minutes  \n5. When that time is up, fry it for 2 more minutes on each side  \n6. Remove from the oil with a spider and drain, before placing it on a paper towel lined tray to dry for a few minutes  \n7. Serve within 5 minutes and enjoy  \n\n### To make a fantastic falafel sandwich\n1. Make homemade pita, store bought is crap and this falafel deserves better  \n2. Make a simple Egyptian salad, with roughly chopped cucumber, tomato, spring onion, parsley and season with lemon juice, olive oil and white vinegar  \n3. Make a tahini sauce according to this [recipe](https://youtu.be/Y7r9HAcR2RQ)  \n4. Split open your pitta bread, and spread in a layer of the tahini sauce  \n5. Add a couple tablespoons of salad to the bread, and some optional salty pickles  \n6. Add a couple of falafel pucks to the bread and enjoy  \n\n## Notes\n* Iraqi falafel is made with a blend of chickpeas and fava beans, you could replace half the fava beans with chickpeas here if you'd like to  \n* Substituting the fava beans with chickpeas will still produce a nice tasting falafel, but you'll have to work harder to keep it together  \n* You should be able to get the split fava beans at any Middle Eastern or South Asian grocery store", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/mcyga8/egyptian_falafel_are_made_with_fava_beans_which/", "created_utc": 1616679558.0, "score": 6739, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 404, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/mcyga8/egyptian_falafel_are_made_with_fava_beans_which/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "*prepares shield* *deep breath* I ADD INSTANT MASHED POTATOES TO SOUP TO THICKEN IT UP IF IT TURNS OUT TOO THIN. *ducks*", "selftext": "\\*peeks\\*\n\nLook, sometimes when you try out a recipe, you're not sure exactly how it'll turn out. Made lentil soup for the first time in my Instant Pot and hesitated when the recipe said to add an extra cup of water (in addition to the 4 cups of chicken broth I had already added), but I figured I should at least give the recipe a shot as-is before trying any modifications.\n\nWelp, guess what? Too much liquid. It's especially bad for me because my husband really prefers thick, hearty soups to thin ones. So I added some of my secret ingredient. Instant mashed potatoes (which I keep around for really lazy days when I just cannot be bothered and emergencies when I am making something that requires potatoes and all my potatoes have sprouted or rotted).\n\nIdk man, maybe this isn't as bad of a sin as I thought? Saved the texture of this soup anyways.\n\nEdit: wow! Thanks for all the awards! Also, I see some people are a bit confused about what kind of instant potatoes I used. I guess there are flavored ones (like with herbs and butter flavor and you just add water????) But i've never used or eaten those. I just use plain ol' potato flakes (the ones you gotta add the milk, butter, and salt to yourself).\n\nEdit the second: definitely also consider the flavor and texture of the soup before adding potato flakes. Potato soup? Uh, yes. Broccoli cheese soup? Mmmmmaybe just a bit. Hot and sour soup? Nah, bruh. Do it like the Chinese restaurants do it and use cornstarch. Pho? Hard no. (What are you even doing, man?) Also, don't forget to adjust to taste.

{"title": "Lentil soup is so popular in the Middle East, that it's eaten in every single country and nearly every house. It's cheap, delicious and simple to make, and I think it may become your favorite soup this winter, recipe inside", "selftext": "Lentil soup is a dish you can find in most countries around the world, you can get it from Scotland, to China, to Srilanka, but few places give it such high regard as the Middle East. In the Middle East it's extremely popular, and you can get it at restaurants and even takeaways all over the region. The history of the lentil in the region goes back quite literally to the dawn of civilization and I like to think we have mastered the making of lentil soups. To this day it's eaten regularly in households all over the region and I think you should cook it this winter. If you grew up disliking lentils like myself, you may find yourself converted by this recipe.\n\nAs usual I have a [full video recipe](https://youtu.be/oi-dcSkR-FQ) which you can follow and I've linked to all my past r/cooking posts in the comments.\n\n\n## What is Middle Eastern Lentil soup\n[Middle Eastern lentil soup](https://imgur.com/a/bykh8Qj) is made by boiling split red (or yellow) lentils until softened and tender. They're usually cooked with a combination of different vegetables or meat and are spiced accordingly to the taste of each country. The dish is widely eaten throughout the Middle East and is commonly served during the Month of Ramadan, when many people like to break their fast with a bowl of warm soup, it has the benefit of being simple to cook and very filling which make it a perfect Ramadan meal. Lentil soup is also a favorite amongst Middle Eastern Christian communities many of whom fast and adhere to a vegan diet for many days throughout the year including the Coptic Christians of Egypt who fast a whopping 180-210 days. \n\nThe dish itself heavily varies from country to country and even house to house, and is usually made with whatever vegetables are on hand. I find that the use of onions, carrots and tomatoes give it a delicious and well rounded flavor, though it's possible to also add celery or courgettes (zuchinni). In this recipe the soup is blended once cooked into a smooth and creamy texture, with the lentils helping to emulsify the soup until it resembles the texture of a cream based soup. In some countries the soup is not blended, and it can have eggs, beans or even pieces of meat added to it. The moroccan dish [Harrira](https://mayihavethatrecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vegetarian-harira-soup-2.jpg), takes the soup further, with the addition of chickpeas, meat, celery and spring onions as well as more spices that give it a beautiful brick red color and smokier flavor. Most Lentil soups have fried vermicelli added to them which gives a slight texture contrast just like in chicken noodle soup. In the levant it's also common to add fried bread croutons (like those used in a fattoush salad) to the soup to give it a nice layer of crunch. \n\nI'd recommend first making this recipe with the same ingredients and spices, then put your own twist on it. I think the addition of chipotle peppers and adobo would give it an amazing smokey flavor, or the addition of some fresh herbs and lemon would give it a nice sourness.  \n\n## History\nLentils have been eaten in the Middle East for millenia and are thought to be one of the first foods cultivated by humans, indeed they're considered the oldest domesticated pulse crop. Architectural digs have found evidence of lentil consumption along the Euphrates river going back to 8000BC and they've been mentioned in the holy books of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Ancient Egyptians even left offerings of lentils in tombs to feed the mumified on their journey to the afterlife. The first mention of lentil stew as a dish exists in the book of Genesis 25:34 \"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and rose and went on his way.\". Given their historical significance and popularity, it's no surprise that they continued to be popular into the modern day. \n\nIn \"Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens\" a 10th century cookbook from Baghdad, a chapter called \"Making Dishes of Yellow Lentils\" describes a recipe that closely resembles this one, it says:\n\"Wash and pick over hulled lentil and cook it until it falls apart and becomes mushy. Cook with it round onion, olive oil, and salt. Add some vinegar. You have the option of adding to it sugar and saffron. Alternatively, if you do not like to use saffron or onion, put bruised garlic cloves and a dusting of cumin in the pot after adding the vinegar\". \n\nAfter the introduction of the Tomato to the Middle East, it has kind of become a necessary ingredient in lentil soup which really elevates the flavor of the dish. The introduction of blenders and food processors also eased the process of milling the cooked lentils into a smooth soup, which prior to that was mashed by hand.\n\n## Flavor Profile\n\nThe dish is definitely a wintery tasting dish and despite not containing the usual winter spices, the earthiness of the lentils really make it feel so. The main flavor here comes from the lentils, which give the soup an earthy and nutty flavor. The red lentils in particular don't overpower the flavors of the other components and like a mushroom I find they empower the other flavors in the dish. The garlic is also quite noticeable and it gives a nice pleasant garlicky flavour to the soup. Using both crushed and fried garlic gives you a strong depth of flavor. You also get a little bit of heat from both the cumin and chili powder which takes on a background flavor in the soup, and are tolerable even to someone who doesn't like spice.\n\nOne of the main flavors here actually comes from the addition of vinegar which elevates the flavors of the whole dish, it adds just the right amount of tang and sourness to brighten the dish and rebalance the earthiness of the lentils and vegetables. The vegetables are blended into the lentils and although you can't distinctly taste each of them, they contribute sweetness and a fresh flavor to the soup, particularly the carrots add a bright flavor.  \n\n## Ingredients\n\nMakes 4-6 large servings\n\n* 1.25L (1.25 qt) Vegetable stock, you can also use chicken, meat or even water. If you are using stock cubes rather than fresh stock, then please use high quality ones.\n* 250g (1/2 lb) Split Red Lentils\n* 150g (5 1/4 oz) Carrots (about 1 large or 2 medium)\n* 1 Brown Onion\n* 1 Tomato \n* 4-6 Garlic Cloves\n* 1/2 Cup Short Wheat Vermicelli\n* 3 Tbsp White Vinegar\n* 1 1/2 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 1 1/2 Tsp Salt \n* 1 1/2 Tsp Ground Cumin\n* 1/2 Tsp Ground Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Tsp Chili powder (cayenne or whatever you have on hand)\n\n## Directions \n\n1. Peel and slice your carrots into large chunks about 1 cm or 1/2 an inch thick\n2. Peel your onion, remove the root and top and slice into quarters\n3. Wash your tomato and slice into quarters, we'll remove the skin later\n3. Peel your garlic cloves, mince 2 of them and set aside, the rest should be lightly crushed\n4. Add your chopped vegetables, the lentils and garlic (the crushed ones not minced) to a large stock pot\n5. Add your stock or water to the pot as well as 1 teaspoon of cumin, turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil\n6. When the pot boils, retrieve the tomato quarters and remove their skin, then add them back to the pot\n7. Turn the heat down to low and allow the soup to simmer for 45 minutes. When done simmering, the carrots should be cooked through and the lentils should be swollen and mushy\n8. Using an immersion (stick) blender, blend the soup and all the vegetables pieces into a uniformly smooth mixture. Once blended it will have a creamy texture that resembles wall paint, remove the soup from the heat and set aside (check the notes for regular blender warning)\n9. In a small pot add 1/2 a tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat and add the 2 minced garlic cloves to it\n10. Fry for about 30 seconds then add the remaining cumin\n11. Fry for another 15 seconds then add the vinegar\n12. Mix and fry for 15 more seconds and add pour the mixture into the lentil soup\n13. Add salt, pepper and Chili powder (optional) then mix the soup well. Taste your soup and check for seasoning, you may need to add another 1/2 tsp of salt if your stock is low in sodium, or add more Chili powder if you'd like it spicier\n14. In a pot add the remaining olive oil and the vermicelli and fry on medium high heat until it turns a golden color. Stir constantly as it can burn easily\n15. Add the fried vermicelli to the soup as well as 1 cup of water to thin the soup out. Bring the pot to a boil once more and allow the vermicelli to cook for 10 minutes\n16. When the time is up, your soup is ready. The vermicelli will have absorbed some water from the soup, so add more water to thin it out until it's thinner than the paint like texture from before. It should be able to coat the back of a spoon without running, similar to the consistency of cooking cream.\n17. Garnish with coriander, thin slices of Chili and nigella seeds\n\n## Notes and tips\n\n* You must use split red lentils for this, brown or green ones have a lot stronger taste and I think the dish won't taste right with them\n* You can serve this over rice and it will be a close approximation to Yellow Lentil Koshari or Kichidi\n* If you have a spice grinder, then toast whole cumin seeds and use them instead for an even more powerful flavor\n* A standard blender can be used in place of an immersion blender, however you need to be sure to either remove the steam vent from the lid, or leave the lid slightly ajar, as it can explode when you blend hot soups\n* The method for making the fried bread croutons is in [my fattoush post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hjx5o7/every_week_i_cook_a_middle_eastern_recipe_this/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/j20f3z/lentil_soup_is_so_popular_in_the_middle_east_that/", "created_utc": 1601390213.0, "score": 6271, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 450, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/j20f3z/lentil_soup_is_so_popular_in_the_middle_east_that/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "This is a help post, from a professional chef to you, with a lot of tips on how to get the most bang for your buck when you cook.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing lots of posts asking how to best shop and cook when the cash isn\u2019t there. As someone who\u2019s spent nearly the entirety of his professional career learning tips and tricks from some of the best chefs out there on how to keep a restaurant afloat when profit margins are so thin you have to choose between keeping half the kitchen\u2019s lights on and buying dishwashing detergent, I think I know a thing or two about cooking as affordably as possible. I\u2019m going to collate this post into a list separated into types of foods (legumes, grains, vegetables, and proteins), with tips on how to buy them and how to prepare them. I use all these tricks myself in my professional life and day-to-day. I hope this can help, and to all my fellow poor cooks out there: hang in there. The world\u2019s a mess; we only have each-other to rely on. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. I\u2019ll try to respond as often as I can. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-LEGUMES\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Buy these dried as often as possible. Keep a stock of beans, lentils, and dried chickpeas around if you can. They\u2019re cheap, almost always available, and virtually imperishable. As such, assuming you don\u2019t throw them out and keep them properly stored, buying these is a 100% return on your investment. \n\n-Legumes are one of the most versatile options in your kitchen. As long as you soak them and put them in the fridge before you go to bed they\u2019ll be available the next day to cook quickly. These are the best thing to have if you\u2019re looking to stretch a meal because of their nutrient density and the fact that they\u2019re just damn delicious on their own. \n\n-Look into middle-eastern and African cuisine for creative ways to use these ingredients. Some really common examples are lentil curry, hummus, falafels, and putting chickpeas in a shakshuka. This isn\u2019t a recipe post, so look up how to make them yourself - some grandma has a better (and probably even cheaper) recipe than I do.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-GRAINS AND CEREALS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Like legumes, these are very versatile. However, I find most people know very little about them outside of wheat and maybe oats. I highly recommend learning what the most commonly eaten grans and cereals in your locality are, and then finding the affordable ones. There will be at least one. I guarantee it. \n\n-FLOUR is an essential staple, unless you\u2019re celiac or gluten free - a topic on which I won\u2019t speak because I\u2019m confident anyone who has to deal with those issues knows more than I do. I recommend grabbing all-purpose flour due to its gluten content being a middle ground between low-gluten pastry flour and high-gluten bread flour. You can still use it to make bread, and it has a myriad other uses as a binder or thickener for sauces. \n\n-RICE is amazing, as most know already, but seriously - it\u2019s one of the most important crops in the world. It\u2019s kept civilizations alive on its back for all of recorded history, and it\u2019ll keep you alive, too. There is no better \u201cfill me up\u201d food I can think of.  Wait for those huge sacks of rice to go on sale (it happens pretty frequently), then buy 2. They last forever. Ideally grab long-grain rice if you\u2019re just looking for a side-dish or fried rice base, but in a pinch short grain\u2019ll do; it\u2019s just less forgiving and the starches don\u2019t retrograde as fully so when you cool it it doesn\u2019t keep as nicely. \n\n-KEEP IN MIND that rice is pure carbs. It\u2019s a good base, but you need other stuff to go with it or else you\u2019ll be deficient in nutrients and feel awful all the time. Trust me from experience - college me went through a raw-egg-on-rice phase, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. \n\n-BARLEY, also, is amazing, but for other reasons. It\u2019s high in protein and iron, and can help dramatically improve your nutrient intake for very little cost. In soups, roasted in tea (thanks Korea), and used in tandem with rice, it can go a very, very long way in making your diet a more sustainable one in times of austerity and plenty, alike.\n\n-AVOID \u201cSUPERFOODS\u201d. Not because they\u2019re bad for you - just because of their jacked prices. Not to mention oftentimes the industries surrounding them are ethical nightmares. Don\u2019t get me started on avocado cartels and the impact of quinoa farming on low-income african communities. In reality, most grains and cereals have a lot of nutrients and minerals, and they\u2019re often overlooked. Learn the nutrition facts, and make decisions accordingly. Google and online databases are your friends, here. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-ONIONS: buy them fresh and store them in dry, enclosed spaces, and buy tomatoes canned and without salt added. Use onions in almost everything, they\u2019re delicious, cheap, and nutritious. \n\n-TOMATOES: Good fresh and better canned. Use fresh tomatoes raw for whatever you want and use canned tomatoes for sauces. Buy canned tomatoes with as little added salt and sugar as possible. \n\n- POTATOES: Treat these as a starch option similar to grains or cereals. Buy them unprocessed, in a sack.  Store them in dry, enclosed spaces. \n\n-BASICALLY EVERY FRUIT: go for it, these things are nutrient bombs and they\u2019re delicious. Buy them seasonally for the best value and if you have a day to do so, preserve them if you ever see a huge sale. I\u2019m still enjoying lacto-fermented blueberries from last year\u2019s insane blueberry harvest where I could buy a pint for a dollar.\n\n-FOR SHOPPING: Generally when you buy produce you should go, in order, to the discount rack, then the sales, and then everything else. Someone out there has a recipe for literally everything, and some of them are even good. A pepper with a blemish or tiny spot of mold is still fine, assuming you cut away the blemish or tiny spot of mold. \n\n-I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH; FIND THE UNDER-APPRECIATED AND OVER-SUPPLIED PRODUCE. There\u2019s always a bin of some forgotten veggie no-one eats for some reason. In the west, at least, it seems to often be rutabagas/turnips. I\u2019ve also seen apples in the fall, corn, and cabbages fall into this category. This is because of a good harvest, or because of a lack of consumer interest - any time this happens, capitalize on it. Everything is delicious if you cook it properly. Buy seasonally, and learn how to use the things you buy. You\u2019ll eat like a king and pay like a pauper.\n\n-CANNED STUFF - I generally have a personal aversion to all canned veggies and fruits except tomatoes, but that\u2019s just my privilege speaking. If you want to buy them or if fresh produce is hard to come by, avoid getting anything with added salt or sugar. Cross-reference the nutrient info on the can with info from a fresh counterpart to avoid buying filler garbage, and try to find somewhere to live with better food accessibility. Alternatively, save up and make a killing by opening a fruit and vegetable market to remove the need to read this very ling post any further. (This is a joke and I recognize the struggle of those in impoverished communities with awful food accessibility.)\n\n-FROZEN STUFF - frozen fruit and veg is great,\nmostly. Maybe dodge the chopped carrots and corn a lot of us ate growing up or find in bad takeout Chinese food, but hey - grab that bag of frozen berries or peas and throw \u2018em in anything that warrants it. Technology for frozen produce has improved dramatically in the last few decades, and we should capitalize on that.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014-PROTEINS\u2014\u2014-\n\n-IF YOU EAT MEAT, buy the least processed cuts you can. Whole chickens, meat on the bone, and ground meats are your best friends. Go to butcher shops, if you can. Freezing meat is fine, but try to avoid buying pre-made frozen protein options. Get raw product and do the work yourself to save a LOT of cash and get better food out of it.\n\n-MEAT IS A LUXURY, NOT AN ESSENTIAL. I say this because in modern western culture eating meat everyday is seen as normal. This is an oddity when we examine all of human history, and this notion should be abandoned if we\u2019re trying to live more affordably. Meat is grossly overrepresented in most diets, and you should always ask if you could cut your portion of meat down in exchange for more vegetables and grains.\n\n-LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN YOUR PROTEINS. A chicken isn\u2019t just 8 portions of meat - it\u2019s also bones and carcass for a stock or soup, fat to be rendered out and used as a cooking oil (thanks, jewish folks!), and skin to be cooked down into delicious little chips. This same list can be used for\npork, beef, and any other mammal you eat. \n\n-FISH IS IFFY. Like, as an industry. Not many people know their fish, and fish processing companies know that and capitalize on it. I always tell people who like fish to buy fresh and whole, and to learn how to pick good fish. Buying cheap processed fish products is akin to asking to be ripped off, to harm the environment, and to accumulate toxins in your body, all at the same time. To not get completely F-ed over by what is maybe the worst food industry in the world you need to know your fish, know the company you\u2019re buying from, and know who\u2019s doing the fishing. Good luck, and please try not to contribute to the death of our water ecosystems. (A good trick is that if you can afford fish when you\u2019re poor and you don\u2019t live beside a large body of water, you almost certainly DON\u2019T WANT IT.)\n\n-IF YOU DO BUY FISH OR SEAFOOD, all the rules for proteins apply. Fish bones and crustacean shells for stock, fat deposits on the occasional salmonid for whatever you want, and fish skin, if it\u2019s your cup of tea, for a lovely snack. Hell, fish organs and salt make up the base for a fermented fish sauce, if you really want to go the extra mile. Rome survived off of fish sauce and bread for longer than our society has been around. The one big difference between fish and meat is that frozen fish tends to suck relative to fresh in a much bigger way - both in terms of quality and retained nutrients. Put frozen fish in soups or curries, to avoid nutrient drain from the water that inevitably will leak out of your fish.\n\nFOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS: I\u2019m not vegetarian or vegan, and while I think there\u2019s great habits to be learned from the lifestyle after getting boatloads of comments I just don\u2019t feel I should even touch the subject. Just do you, and do your research. Best of luck.\n\n\u2014\u2014-EVERYTHING ELSE\u2014\u2014-\n\n-STAY AWAY FROM THE INSTANT RAMEN. I know it\u2019s cheap. I KNOW you like how easy it is. I don\u2019t give one flying fuck. It\u2019s awful for you, it isn\u2019t cheaper than a bowl of rice with soy sauce, a fried egg, and some frozen peas, and it\u2019ll kill you slowly. Just don\u2019t, and ignore anyone\u2019s advice about how it got them through college. Hell, if anyone\u2019s advice involves doing what they did in college, take it with a grain of salt. There\u2019s good advice sometimes, and a LOT of bad.\n\n-AVOID THE CENTRE AISLES IN GROCERY STORES. Chips, sugar cereals, premade salad dressings, sweet juice/pop, and processed foods like KD or tv dinners are not the way to go if you\u2019re looking to get the most out of your dollar at the grocery store. They\u2019re bad for you, they\u2019re expensive relative to the cost of production, and they put a burden on your body that you\u2019ll pay for down the line. Exceptions to this are staple sauces like a good soy sauce and fish sauce, grains and legumes, and canned veggies. \n\n-CHEESE IS A LUXURY, SO TREAT IT LIKE ONE. If you\u2019re gonna buy it I recommend buying less of it less often, and buying the good stuff when you do. Kraft block cheese only costs as little as it does because it\u2019s the by-product of the real money-maker: whey protein production. If you\u2019re gonna buy cheese, please support a real cheesemaker. The cheese lover in you will be happier for it. \n\n-ALCOHOL IS ALSO A LUXURY. If you want a drink, I recommend doing it less often and drinking the good stuff. If you like the cheap stuff that\u2019s fine, \u201cgood stuff\u201d is all relative anyway. Just drink less and focus on quality over quantity, whatever your preferences are. \n\n-MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE, AND BUY A THERMOS. I know Starbucks is delicious. Guess what? You can find a recipe for every drink they make online, and then make it better. Some restaurants literally survive because they can sell coffee at a nearly 2000% markup. Truck stop diners and high-end coffee shops do this. I recommend making cold brew the night before, since you literally just have to strain it in the morning rather than brewing a pot.\n\n-FINALLY, LEARN TO COOK. All of this information is fundamentally more useful if you know how to cook. Not knowing how to cook is a luxury afforded to those with the means to afford living in ignorance of this most basic human skill. You are living outside your means if you live in a well-off country, don\u2019t make a least $60k a year, and can\u2019t cook. \n\n\nBest of luck to you all.

He seems to live off of processed foods like pop tarts and frozen waffles and nothing of the home-cooked variety. \n\nThis morning I made them breakfast and cooked some scrambled eggs, tortillas, refried beans, and potatoes cubed up and fried in a bit of oil. He didn\u2019t want any of it but ate some of the tortilla. I insisted he at least *try*the eggs, but he didn\u2019t want any. He says he\u2019s tried them and never liked them. \n\nA few hours later I think the hunger came in and he asked if I could cook him and egg and he\u2019d try it. So I offered to cook him one and he wanted to watch the process. I cracked the egg in the bowl, added some salt and pepper, and scrambled it in the bowl. \n\n\u201cOh, you *season* the egg??\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll yeah, of course! It\u2019s gotta have some flavor\u201d I replied.\n\nThen I heated a small pan, put some butter in and he goes \u201coh wow, you put *butter* in the eggs?\u201d\n\nAnd I said \u201cI like to put butter cause it usually makes the eggs taste better and prevents it from sticking\u201d\n\nHe was amazed at how good the eggs actually smelled, looked, and tasted! As he was eating them, he proudly exclaimed \u201cbutter is the key!\u201d. \n\nI think he had just been served dry, rubber, tasteless eggs his whole life!

And that is true to some extent because of the fact that its dry and dry is better than wet when frying, but that is far from the entire story. And in fact, the step of having day old dry rice isn't even all that important. Kenji from Serious eat's say's the same thing. Even fresh cooked hot rice works as long as the excess surface moisture escapes as steam.\n\n[https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/the-food-lab-how-to-make-best-fried-rice-chinese-thai-wok-technique-right-type-of-rice.html](https://www.seriouseats.com/2016/02/the-food-lab-how-to-make-best-fried-rice-chinese-thai-wok-technique-right-type-of-rice.html)\n\nNow to get the the rant... Why does no one ever point out that YOU NEED MSG FOR THAT CHINESE TAKEOUT TASTE.

People just act like that technqiue is the second coming of Jesus or something. Yet no one mentions MSG?\n\nI have worked on my fried rice for a while and got it to the point its way better than take out, and the secret?\n\nIt's a combination of many factors (dry rice included). Good heat control (high heat all the way for fried rice), cooking in batches, Good rice ( I use jasmine, I think its the ideal level of stickiness).\n\nBut what people tend to miss out on is that, you need MSG, without MSG your fried rice will always taste like it lacks some compared to the restaurant's no matter what. Chineese takeout places use chicken bouillion powder and that really add's that takeout taste, I have tried it for myself. I can't list the number of times people asked for my secret when cooking and the only answer I had was that I use a heavy hand with the MSG. It's role in chinese food cannot be underestimated.\n\nAlso using butter or bacon fat (use both for godlike taste) in fried rice can elevate it beyond what you are used to having in the restaurant's.\n\nedit1- To all you precious people saying you don't use MSG, but your fried rice is still AMAZING and the BEST IN THE WORLD, I suggest you try using MSG so your fried rice can be EXTRA SUPER DUPER DELUXE AMAZING.

{"title": "What the coronavirus forcing me in lockdown's taught me about cooking; plus, how to make Mantou (\u9992\u5934)", "selftext": "So there\u2019s an offchance you might recognize my username: I\u2019m the dude that\u2019s posted weekly Chinese recipes here for the last\u2026 couple years or so. Together with my fianc\u00e9 (who\u2019s from Guangdong), we live in Shunde, China \u2013 a small city a bit south of Guangzhou on the Macau side of the delta. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been inundated with news about the most recent coronavirus outbreak over on this side of the world \u2013 I certainly don\u2019t want to pile on and make you any more anxious than you need to be. That\u2019s not my goal: social media does a good enough job with that as is. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I feel like this time\u2019s given me some personal insights on food and cooking that I haven\u2019t really had the chance to internalize in the past. Maybe everything I\u2019m about to write is all obvious to you, I don\u2019t know. But I figured I\u2019d share regardless.\n\n**The situation we\u2019ve found ourselves in**\n\nSee, for the past two weeks or so, the city we live has more or less\u2026 shut down. People don\u2019t go outside unless they have to \u2013 we take our dog for walks up on the roof of our apartment complex, make quick runs to 7/11 for supplies every two days or so (because I mean\u2026 alcohol is pretty much mandatory in a time like this), and\u2026 that\u2019s pretty much it. Restaurants are for the most part all closed down. The city is essentially on the economic equivalent of life support \u2013 the only things that\u2019re open are convenience stores, grocery stores, and pharmacies. There\u2019s checkpoints and roadblocks entering and leaving the city. Hell, every time we leave or enter our apartment complex we\u2019re checked for symptoms by the doorman. The only people that dare to go outside without a medical mask are those unlucky sods that didn\u2019t get the chance to buy any before supplies ran out.\n\nNow I don\u2019t mean to paint too apocalyptic of a picture here. We live in Shunde, not Wuhan (which\u2019s tragically borne the brunt of all this). A lot of these measures are precautionary, and\u2026 you sort of get used to it all. It sucks, no doubt. But it says a lot about human psychology just how quickly a new normal can become\u2026 normal. \n\nFeeding yourself is an interesting challenge, however. Completely by happy accident, out of any of our friends or family we\u2019re probably the most prepared for this kind of situation. We do a YouTube cooking thing, after all. We test a lot of recipes. Our cabinets, fridges, freezers are *stocked* with leftovers, sauces, nuts, dried seafood and mushrooms, frozen meats, pickles, tubers, grains\u2026 shit, we could probably live for a month off our food stock alone and not starve. And while we\u2019re far from chefs, I do like to think we know a thing or two about cooking\u2026 so at least a portion of that month might actually be rather tasty.\n\nWhat I just wasn\u2019t mentally prepared for, however, was the shortage of fresh vegetables.  Veggies were pretty much the first thing to go after medical masks. If you\u2019re anything like me, the thought of that makes you feel\u2026 claustrophobic. *No fresh vegetables for potentially weeks on end.* The walls start closing in\u2026\n\nLuckily of course, we don\u2019t live in the epicenter of all this. Where we live at least, you *can* get fresh vegetables. It\u2019s just not super easy. Supermarkets get one shipment in a day and you pretty much have to order online ~30 minutes from that time before they sell out. You pretty much don\u2019t have a choice in what you get \u2013 when you\u2019re in that window you\u2019ll take what you can get. Chilis, carrots, and broccoli are usually available. Anything else is a crapshoot. \n\nBut it\u2019s fine. Buy what you can. Pickiness is luxury.\n\n**What this does to your mindset**\n\nI think everyone that\u2019s a devoted homecook is pretty experienced with cleaning out their fridge before stuff goes bad. We\u2019ve all had those *fuck it, let\u2019s feed myself* stews, sandwiches, and stir-fries. Some of them might\u2019ve actually been pretty good! To me at least, that\u2019s the ultimate test of the skill of a cook. A novice sees a sparsely populated refrigerator and thinks, \u201cdelivery\u201d. An experienced cook can look at that same refrigerator and can see\u2026 possibility.  \n\nThere\u2019s three ways that make our current situation unique to that\u2026 ever so common experience:\n\n1.\t*We have time.* Lots of it. Too much, really. The epidemic has been a mandatory extended vacation for the majority of the country.\n\n2.\t*We don\u2019t have much choice in ingredients.* While similar to the normal exercise, we have this weird overabundance of some ingredients together with a shortage of others. Way too much carrot\u2026\n\n3.\t*The supplies must last.* What\u2019s **really** the crux of the what\u2019s made this situation such a unique feeling to me. Nothing is wasted. Every square millimeter of that broccoli\u2019s used. I\u2019m careful with how much aromatics I use. Because like, while it\u2019s quite likely we\u2019d be able to get garlic in the next time we squeeze in a food order, you never know.\n\nAll of these factors *force* you to be creative \u2013 day in and day out. You approach each meal differently. You don\u2019t enter the kitchen with the mindset of \u201cwhat do I feel like eating?\u201d You enter it asking the question, \u201cwhat\u2019s the best thing I can possibly make with the resources I have?\u201d \n\nCooking with this kind of scarcity mindset\u2019s been\u2026 eye-opening. An entirely different perspective. There\u2019s a lot of rambling online about \u201ccreative constraint\u201d \u2013 how limitations force you to be creative. Much of it has the tone of pseudo-scientific self-help bullshit (and given the replication crisis in psychology, who knows if there\u2019s a solid scientific foundation for the idea), but after these couple weeks\u2026 I think it\u2019s true. I mean\u2026 some of the best art happens with limitations \u2013 poetry in meter, painting on a canvas. \n\nSome other random shit I\u2019ve internalized:\n\n* I have a newfound appreciation for cuisines from colder climates. In this kind of environment, you get a lot more inspiration from, say, Northwestern Chinese food than (central) Thai food.\n\n* Pickled vegetables seem to scratch the same itch fresh vegetables do. \n\n* On that note, modern Korean kimchi might be the greatest invention of the 19th century. The steam engine doesn\u2019t have anything on kimchi.\n\n* Flour is amazing. You can do anything with flour.\n\n* Life would fucking suck without fermented sauces. We would be eating so, so much worse without soy sauce and fish sauce. \n\nI\u2019ll go over some of the stuff we\u2019ve whipped up in the lockdown below, but first\u2026 there\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been mulling over for a while. I have zero clue if any of this\u2019ll make sense, I\u2019m kind of working through this shit myself. Hopefully my ramblings aren\u2019t *too* boring\u2026\n\n**Why I think modern cuisine kinda sucks:**\n\nThere\u2019s something that\u2019s bothered me for a while. Stay with me here.\n\nThink of almost any dish that you can name. Anywhere in the world. Chinese food, French food, whatever. There\u2019s probably 95% chance that that dish \u2013 or at least what you would *recognize* as that dish was first invented during the time period of 1750 \u2013 1950. A few examples:\n\n* Mapo Tofu, 1874.\n\n* Modern (not fermented) sushi, 1750.\n\n* Neopolitan Pizza, 1889.\n\n* Pho, mid 1880s.\n\n* Gumbo, 1802.\n\n* Modern Paella, 1840.\n\n* Beef Bourguignon, mid 1800s.\n\n* Risotto, 1809.\n\n* Eggs Benedict, 1894.\n\n* Char Siu Bao, 1924. \n\nFor any of these, you could obviously quibble about the exact dates. E.g. slaves in Louisiana were eating a gumbo-esque Okra stew that was labelled \u2018gumbo\u2019 since the early to mid 1700s, 1802 was simply the first recorded instance of the dish. You could do this exercise the list over, of course \u2013 hell, fermented *narezushi* can be traced all the way back to 2nd century AD China. \n\nBut as you stand back, a mosaic begins to emerge. First thing you notice? Much of what we consider \u2018cuisine\u2019 is\u2026 surprisingly *modern*.  Like, I know with Chinese food there\u2019s almost an assumption that most of the food has thousands of years of history or something\u2026 nope! While it\u2019s definitely cool that there\u2019s a few dishes that you can trace back to the Song dynasty or even earlier\u2026 like it is the world over, most of the innovation (on the level of individual dishes, at least) seemed to happen post 1750. Second thing you notice? Most of the innovation stops around the time of world war two. Post war? The landscape of newly invented foods seems\u2026 pretty barren.\n\nThe question of why has\u2026 knawed on me ever since I saw those puzzle pieces. Maybe it\u2019s a mirage. Maybe if you were standing in 1870 England and you fired up your Victorian steampunk Babbage-engine equivalent of Wikipedia, you\u2019d find all the dishes you loved seem to have been invented in the years of 1600-1800? Who knows. Food history is murky as all hell. After all, throughout the course of human civilization, people tend to write about Kings and Revolutionaries and Conquerors\u2026 not the cooks that fed them. But I think we at least need to entertain the notion that *maybe* there was *some* sort of special sauce that led to that Cambrian explosion of dishes in those two centuries.\n\nI\u2019m still not sure if I have an answer \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that I don\u2019t. Some possible reasons for the upsurge of recorded dishes mid 18th century:\n\n1.\tThe Columbian exchange/the entire colonial project introduced novel ingredients from around the world and touched almost every society.  Obviously this process started in the 16th century, but it was a couple centuries yet before it people started eating tomatoes in Italy and chilis in Sichuan.\n\n2.\tThe development of the restaurant. Restaurants became common in China in the Song dynasty (I believe, don\u2019t hold me to that) and in the West in the 19th century. This seems to coincide with a greater diversity in recorded dishes in both those places.\n\n3.\tThe printing press could be another possibility. The dates aren\u2019t quite as neat though, as the first printed cookbook was in 1485. But cookbooks began gaining popularity in the mid 17th century, so maybe.\n\nOr perhaps any number of those reasons. Or perhaps a combination. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m far from a historian. As to some possible culprits of the decline of cooking:\n\n1.\tThe electric refrigerator became commonplace in 1940s, potentially killing the creativity-inducing \u2018scarcity mindset\u2019\n\n2.\tWomen in the workplace became much more common post war. Obviously a very good and beneficial development from a societal perspective, but perhaps the loss of half of society devoted to the job of cooking may have harmed cuisine?\n\n3.\tMass production of full meals \u2013 in the form of TV dinners and began in earnest in the post-war period.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not sure the answer. If you pressed me before this whole coronavirus lockdown episode, I\u2019d probably have told you that modernism and mass production is to blame. Now\u2026 I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nI think time has something to do with it, potentially. I can\u2019t seem to find any good data on the topic for the pre-war period, but in 1965 women in America spent \u2013 on average \u2013 two hours a day cooking. Now women spend an average of 51 minutes (men, 22 minutes\u2026 c\u2019mon guys\u2026). Despite what the \u201cQUICK AND EASY!!!!!!\u201d bloggers of the world tell you, you can prepare much better food in the time of two hours than you can in 22 minutes.\n\nMix that with a dash of scarcity induced creative limitation? The entire **society** over? That seems like a recipe for some good food.\n\n**Why modern \u2018fusion\u2019 is boring:**\n\nWhich brings us to the other great culinary mystery our time: why does fusion suck so hard?\n\nBecause I mean, if you look at cuisines around the world\u2026 the cultures at the intersection of great migrations or trade routes seem to have some pretty damn interesting food. Situated in the middle of the silk road, Uighur cuisine is an awesome mix between Northwestern Han Chinese and other central Asian foods. Sichuanese food, meanwhile, was the product of one of the most massive internal migrations of human history, when the province was repopulated by people from Hunan and Shandong after a devasting war (the Qing government kinda killed\u2026 everyone). The food in the Malacca straights, with the mix of Southeast Asian, Indian and Chinese flavors is aggressively awesome. Istanbul \u2013 at the crossroads of Occident and Orient - is one of the world\u2019s great food cities.\n\nSo why, despite all of our best efforts in the past forty years, have our culinary mashups seemed to go basically nowhere? Like, seriously. With a touch of digging, you can have an entire globe\u2019s worth of ingredients available to you. With the smallest amount of gumption, you can have authentic recipes and techniques the world over *demonstrated*to you in video form. \n\nWhen it was just out-of-touch white American chefs mindlessly smushing together high end French and Japanese food in the 80s, you could kind of get why \u201cfusion\u201d sucked: it was pretty much the dictionary definition of pretention. But now\u2026 now we have *all* these resources\u2026 now we have so much more diversity in chefs\u2026 and the best the great culinary minds of our generation can come up with is\u2026 fucking Kung Pao Pastrami? Seriously? \n\nIt circles back to the importance of limitations, I think. Limitations help break you out of *functional fixedness* - i.e. limiting yourself to using an object only in the way it\u2019s traditionally used. The most famous example of this is the \u201ccandle box problem\u201d in psychology:\n\n>Participants were shown a picture containing several products on a table: a candle, a pack of matches, and a box of tacks, all of which were next to a wall. Participants\u2019 task was to figure out how to attach the candle to the wall by using only the objects on the table, so that the candle burns properly and does not drip wax on the table or the floor.\n\n[This is the answer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Genimage.jpg), if you\u2019re curious. Now again, I don\u2019t like using psychology studies to prove a point because (a) I am not a psychologist and (b) there\u2019s a rich history of other not-psychologist-people twisting studies and taking them out of context in order to peddle BS. But with that preface out of the way, I still think the concept of functional fixedness can at least help us give some sort of framework as to why fusion \u2013 still \u2013 sucks.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at [this Wagyu Beef Bao Bun](https://scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/65040779_327039218192713_454442603002945579_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-yyz1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=hu5yy2NmBqQAX80q5o8&oh=2a4591cbb6a4d1a3c42790bdeaf76179&oe=5ED29557) from Wolfgang Puck. I\u2019m sure it tastes fine, I\u2019m not going to argue otherwise. But what I *will* argue is that that dish is goddam boring, and probably not worth the premium. \n\nWhy? The \u201cBao Bun\u201d there (god, I hate that translation) is simply conceptualized as sandwich bread. It\u2019s not interesting, it\u2019s just\u2026 a more instagrammable potato roll. So many of these trendy \u2018Bao\u2019 creations throughout the OECD are just hipsters putting Asian shit on steamed buns and the media patting them on the back for their ingenuity. But there\u2019s nothing ingenious there. It\u2019s\u2026 a sandwich. A decade later, food trends\u2019ll move onto something else, and we\u2019ll forget the Bao craze even happened. Because at their core, most of these dishes are\u2026 forgettable.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be too much of a critic. The food industry is hard\u2026 I don\u2019t blame any chef for doing what they have to to make a decent living (it\u2019s really food media that can be cringy). But I think we can do better. One way out of functional fixedness is the \u201cgeneric parts technique\u201d. If you don\u2019t mind a quick copy/paste:\n\n>For each object, you need to decouple its function from its form. McCaffrey shows a highly effective technique for doing so. As you break an object into its parts, ask yourself two questions. \"Can I subdivide the current part further?\" If yes, do so. \"Does my current description imply a use?\" If yes, create a more generic description involving its shape and material. For example, initially I divide a candle into its parts: wick and wax. The word \"wick\" implies a use: burning to emit light. So, describe it more generically as a string. Since \"string\" implies a use, I describe it more generically: interwoven fibrous strands. This brings to mind that I could use the wick to make a wig for my hamster. Since \"interwoven fibrous strands\" does not imply a use, I can stop working on wick and start working on wax. People trained in this technique solved 67% more problems that suffered from functional fixedness than a control group. This technique systematically strips away all the layers of associated uses from an object and its parts.\u201d\n\nThis is why so much innovation in food happened around the Columbian exchange, I feel. People were introduced to novel new ingredients, *not* novel new foods. So you get interesting shit like people in Guizhou fermenting tomatoes into a paste and using it as a base for sour soup catfish hotpot, or people in France pounding potatoes until sticky and mixing it with cheese.\n\nSo I think one good way to make more\u2026 organic fusion is to simply grab an ingredient from another culture and just keep it in your fridge. Bonus points if you have no fucking clue how it\u2019s actually used. In time, you\u2019ll find what to do with it. \n\nLike, with the burgeoning popularity of *Lao Gan Ma* chili crisp, I heard some people online talk about how they liked it together with a bagel and cream cheese. I thought that sounded weird as hell, so obviously I *had* to try it. And you know what? Pretty good. Weirdly works well together - *vastly* more interesting than anything I\u2019ve seen out of these \u2018fusion-y\u2019 restaurants. Because anyone can mix together some fish and shit and call it \u2018poke\u2019. Lao Gan Ma with cream cheese? That\u2019s the kind of vision that only the most desperately inebriated could possibly concoct\u2026   \n\n**A list of stuff that we\u2019ve cooked during this lockdown:**\n\nNow, I think I probably over emphasized my points in these last two rambly\u2026 sections. I\u2019m obviously no visionary chef. I hold precisely zero illusions otherwise. I\u2019m going to list out the stuff we\u2019ve whipped up in the past two weeks, and you\u2019ll probably say to yourself \u201cuh, dude\u2026 really, that\u2019s it? The David Changs of the world make **way** more interesting stuff than that\u201d. And\u2026 I\u2019d 100% agree. Not claiming otherwise.\n\nWhat I *would* say though is that I do think some of these concoctions have been surprisingly good. And this? This is from just *two weeks* of staying inside. Could you imagine an entire *society* of people with a *lifetime* of experience with the same sort of mindset? Think of all the stuff they\u2019d invent! No wonder traditional food is so damn interesting the world over\u2026 \n\nIn any event, in rough order of how much I liked them:\n\n1.\t[Guizhou-style Laoguo sizzling pan stir-fry, with Oaxaca cheese, Lao Gan Ma, and flour tortillas.](https://streamable.com/r2zt1)  So in Guizhou there\u2019s a style of eating called *Shuicheng Laoguo* - looks [like this](http://5b0988e595225.cdn.sohucs.com/images/20190618/07cd96e5eacb4fc586d52e083ad60463.jpeg), basically you toss a stir-fry on a sizzling pan and slowly munch on it (though some varieties\u2019ll also toss raw stuff on the pan to let it cook/toast). This was mixed vegetables with black pepper pork chop, seasoned with mianchi (red miso), Hunan chili sauce, soy sauce, Hoisin, and chili garlic sauce. Usually it\u2019s dipped in seasoned chili flakes, but we\u2019ve just been using Lao Gan Ma black soybean chili. For the Oaxaca cheese, we just melted it on the pan bit by bit\u2026 then tossed in a flour tortilla (I know those were kinda overly thick, was trying out a new recipe) \u2013 the mix of Oaxaca cheese and douchi really, really worked. Heavily recommended, this was awesome \u2013 some restaurant should really serve this somewhere (probably in Guizhou\u2026 would be way easier to convince Guiyuang people to eat Laoguo with Mexican cheese than try to educated American restaurant-goers how to eat Laoguo-style). Really, the more I pay around with the flavors I kinda think Gui-Mex should be the thing lol. This would be even better with masa tortillas imo.\n\n2.\t[Tomato sauce with spicy fermented paste over Northern Chinese \u2018cat ear\u2019 noodles, with stuffed  lotus root on the side](https://i.imgur.com/2ntMOSe.jpg). I know this really doesn\u2019t look like much, but we got a small shipment of tomatoes one day and I thought to myself \u2018eh, alright, I\u2019ll whip up a quick roasted tomato sauce, why not\u2019. No onion\u2026 but hey, whatever. I was running a touch low on tomato paste, so on a whim I reached for Guizhou fermented tomato paste \u2013 it\u2019s the base of the aforementioned sour catfish hotpot, slightly spicy and pretty intensely sour. At first I was kinda pissed at myself for potentially screwing up the tomato sauce \u2013 the sour notes were totally cool, but the heat was\u2026 distracting. Sliced up a bit of carrot, tossing it in with water to let it all cook down. After that and seasoning with a bit of sugar, MSG, fish sauce, and black pepper\u2026 it actually really, really worked. Topped it over some freshly whipped up cat ear noodles, and ate alongside stuffed lotus root.\n\n3.\t[Blended Mexican-style hotsauce with Sichuan chilis and Laozao fermented rice](https://i.imgur.com/A9Fckza.jpg). This one is kind of cheating because it was something that I first developed with a buddy of mine who runs a Mexican restaurant in Shenzhen. The original task was \u201cmake a house hot sauce that\u2019s kind of like Tapatio but using Chinese chilis\u201d. I ended up being really proud of the stuff. I won\u2019t bore you will all of the details, but two cool points I think are (1) the water the chilis are blended with are soaked with Sichuan peppercorn \u2013 if you soak Sichuan peppercorn in this way, you\u2019ll only get the floral quality, not the numbingness and (2) the vinegar is rice vinegar, Laozao fermented rice was also tossed in. The latter bit adds a bit of sweetness and a *lot* of complexity. This stuff was perfect drizzled on Mac N Cheese.\n\n4.\t[Pan-fried Guozengzong with the aforementioned hot sauce.](https://i.imgur.com/gQNHPEV.jpg) Steph\u2019s mother\u2019s side is from Zhaoqing \u2013 city outside of Guangzhou renowned for their Zongzi (sticky rice dumplings). [This is what they look like](https://i.imgur.com/HdU5To6.jpg) \u2013 the best sort are stuffed with fatty pork belly and mungbean. It\u2019s a tradition to make them around Chinese New Year, and after swinging by to Steph\u2019s parent\u2019s place we got\u2026 loaded up with a bunch of them. In Vietnam they\u2019ve also got a *very* similar thing called banh chung, which they\u2019ll sometimes smush down into a pan and fry it. Pan-frying this stuff is *awesome*, and it also went great dipped in that vinegar-y hot sauce above.\n\n5.\t[Pork Belly and Kimchi Sandwich](https://i.imgur.com/Cht9BwW.jpg). Ate way too many of these things. This was thinly sliced pork belly that we had in the freezer from testing Suanni Bairou \u2013 Sichuan Spicy Garlic Pork. Basically, the pork belly is blanched until cooked through, then left to sit in the pot for ~3 hours to get a bit more tender. You slice it super super thin\u2026 like, 1mm wide. Makes for an ideal sandwich meat to be honest.  Roughly equal parts pork belly to kimchi (maybe a touch more pork belly), together with a spread of equal parts Kewpie mayo, Dijon mustard, and Kimchi pickling juice. This was on some homemade crunchy wheat bread but I think that Rye would probably work best. Just a simple, good thing. Tried it with cheese inside too... doesn\u2019t need it.\n\n6.\t[Yunnan colored steamed rice with fried pork mince and pickled chili, together with the aforementioned hot sauce](https://i.imgur.com/6k7ZoGx.jpg). The mince was done by hand, ala Macanese minchi. Really great stuff to top over rice, but unlike minchi Steph also tossed in some Hunan pickled chilis in (which can really bring the heat). Great with the hot sauce. The bit on the bottom left is just some (totally not homemade) Teochew taro roll that we had in our freezer.\n\n7.\t[Stir-fried Mantou Buns](https://i.imgur.com/1uNJiib.jpg). We were doing a Mantou (steamed bun) video for the channel, so we\u2019ve had a lot of leftover Mantou. One thing we\u2019ve heard that in the North of China, some people\u2019ll cube leftover mantou and actually stir-fry them. We have no idea if this is actually how people do it, but on a whim Steph *very* lightly oiled a wok, toasted/fried the Mantou until golden brown, and seasoned with the same Chinese BBQ spice mix that you\u2019d have on cumin roast lamb. Pretty awesome, very reminiscent of the grilled Mantou buns that you get at Chinese BBQ joints.\n\nAnd again\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to say that our cooking is awesome, or interesting, or anything. I know a solid chunk of you probably clicked on a couple of those links and thought to yourself \u201cI dunno, looks kinda shitty\u201d. We\u2019re no chefs. There\u2019s a reason we devote ourselves to researching authentic dishes/techniques to the very best of our ability\u2026 because precisely no one is interested in \u201c/u/mthmchris and /u/leeleesteph\u2019s wacky fusion fun hour\u201d.\n\nWhat I *am* saying though is that this all\u2019s forced us to be the most inventive cooks we\u2019ve ever been in our entire lives\u2026 and this\u2019s just from two nobodies with a camera over the course of two weeks. Imagine millions of people, many lifetimes over, with the same mindset. \n\nIterate that function for a while. **That** is why \u2018authenticity\u2019 in food is a valuable goal, despite it being a\u2026 controversial word in many circles. It\u2019s not that cuisine can never change, or that there\u2019s only *one* recipe for any given dish. It\u2019s about respecting the idea that (1) the generations that came before us were probably much better cooks than we are and (2) you can generally find a lot more interesting food by looking *back*, by peeking in dusty corners, than you can by inventing your own hack or whatever.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that we all can\u2019t be inventive, or have fun being creative. But when I\u2019m saying that I want an \u201cauthentic\u201d version of say, Bouillabaisse sauce\u2026 what I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m looking for a recipe that is connected to and respects those cultural traditions.  \n\n**What else we\u2019ve eaten**\n\nOf course, not everything\u2019s been mashups or whatever. Lots of bread and noodles (heavily recommend Ken Forkish\u2019s *Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast* by the way\u2026 having some nice western-style bread during this time\u2019s been awesome). The aforementioned *Laoguo*, Cantonese claypot rice, and Mac N\u2019 Cheese have been other staples (luckily the 7/11 near us sells small cartons of fresh milk).\n\nBut probably what we\u2019ve eaten the most of has been Mantou \u2013 steamed buns. Mantou with chili crisp (if steamed) or condensed milk (if fried) has been my go-to snack. We\u2019ve had a lot of them from testing them for the channel, but they\u2019re so great to have around that we\u2019re actually whipping up more, even after we\u2019ve made the video (a rarity for us, usually we\u2019re so tired of a dish after testing it\u2019s months before we circle back).\n\nSo to actually give you **some** actual content here, outside of my insane bourbon-and-cabin-fever-induced ramblings\u2026 here\u2019s how to make some Mantou.\n\n## How to Make Mantou Buns\n\nSo there\u2019s three primarily types of Mantou buns:\n\n1.\t*Northern Laomian Mantou.* In the North, mantou are traditionally made with a sourdough starter called *laomian* (\u8001\u9762), which\u2019s then mixed with alkaline ingredients like sodium carbonate to balance the taste. They come in two varieties \u2013 hard and soft. The taste itself is rather plain because they\u2019re meant to be eaten alongside other things as a meal.\n\n2.\t*Southwestern Laozao Mantou.* A really interesting Mantou from Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan\u2026 this kind of Mantou also uses a starter, but interestingly uses fermented rice (\u91aa\u7cdf) to make it. Usually yeast is also added to the dough as well, making for some super-fluffy Mantou.\n\n3.\t*Southern Mantou.* These Mantou are a bit sweeter, and rely on baking powder and yeast. I\u2019d venture that these are probably the most common Mantou that you can find at restaurants, especially abroad.\n\n\nEventually we\u2019ll want to cover all three, but the southern mantou are the most straightforward of the bunch so that\u2019s what I\u2019ll show you today.\n\n[Video is here if you\u2019d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/R3P0OFHqv-c). Seeing as there\u2019s not really too much to this, I\u2019ll try to be a bit more brief from here on out.\n\n**Ingredients, Mantou Buns:**\n\nBaker\u2019s percentages in brackets. I\u2019ll try to remember to do this.\n\n1.\t*All Purpose Flour (\u4e2d\u7b4b\u9762\u7c89), 200g.* For reference the AP we use here in China is 10.8% protein.\n\n2.\t*Water, 90g.* Divided into two bowls, each with 45g. We\u2019ll get to why in a second. [45%]\n\n3.\t*Sugar, 20g.* [10%]\n\n4.\t*Instant Dry Yeast (\u9175\u6bcd), 1 tsp.* Or 2 grams. [1%]\n\n5.\t*Baking Powder (\u6ce1\u6253\u7c89), 1 tsp.* Or 2 grams. [1%]\n\nAnd if you end up deep frying these, you\u2019ll also want the totally-mandatory condensed milk to dip them in.\n\n**Process, Mantou Buns:**\n\n1.\t*Thoroughly mix the sugar with half the water and the yeast in a separate bowl with the other half.* This dough has a *lot* of sugar and yeast in it. Because a high-sugar environment can actually draw moisture out of and damage yeast, we\u2019ll keep these separate for now.\n\n2.\t*Sift together the flour and the baking powder.*\n\n3.\t*Slowly drizzle in the yeast water into the baking powder/flour, aiming for the dry bits. Then do the same with the sugar water.* I always like mixing with a single chopstick for this kind of step.\n\n4.\t*Knead for eight minutes.* Or alternatively in a stand mixer on speed 1 for the same time (dough hook attachment). [This is the final consistency you\u2019re looking for](https://i.imgur.com/KttlAa3.png).\n\n5.\t*Cover, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.*\n\n6.\t*Either by hand or using a pasta maker on the widest setting, roll the dough out thin. Fold it in half, then pass it through again \u2013 six times in all.* This step will get us that classic smooth skin that Southern-style Mantou are known for.\n\n7.\t*With the dough in a sheet now, tightly roll it all up into a log, then roll it a touch longer by hand to get something ~25cm long.* \n\n8.\t*Flour a work surface, place the log on, and gently press down on the bottom.* Very gently, just enough to get a bit of an indent in order to get that classic Mantou shape.\n\n9.\t*With a sharp knife, slight the roll into eight pieces.* Don\u2019t try to use a bench scrape for this step \u2013 being less sharp, it\u2019d slightly press down on the Mantou and muff up the looks. \n\n10.\t*Place the mantou on some squares of parchment paper, then in a steamer. Toss the steamer over a wok filled with 28C water, and proof for 15 minutes.* Just for standardization sake. \n\n11.\t*Over the same water, swap your flame to medium-high and bring it to a boil. Once you can see steam pluming out of the crack of the steamer, set your timer for five minutes.* We\u2019re steaming this gently so that the Mantou doesn\u2019t rise too fast and form air bubbles on the surface of the skin.\n\n12.\t*After that time, shut off the heat and don\u2019t peak for five minutes.* Then after those five minutes, take them out and enjoy!\n\nNote that one common problem is for the skin of the Mantou to come out a bit wrinkly. This means that you either over-proofed the Mantou or steamed at too high of a heat. It\u2019s ok if one or two out of the batch has a couple wrinkles \u2013 you\u2019d rather these be overly fluffy than under-fluffy, after all \u2013 but make adjustments if it\u2019s the whole batch.\n\n**How to Deep Fry Mantou:**\n\nOne of the best things you can do with these southern-style Mantou is deep fry them. A couple cups of oil in a wok, heat it up to 175C. Mantou in, and after about 30 seconds give them a flip. Fry for another minute under golden brown, flipping periodically. Out.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to use up slightly stale mantou, and perfect dipped in way too much condensed milk.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/f0qjm9/what_the_coronavirus_forcing_me_in_lockdowns/", "created_utc": 1581162085.0, "score": 5544, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 227, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/f0qjm9/what_the_coronavirus_forcing_me_in_lockdowns/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Watermelon misconceptions", "selftext": "Hi all large family-owned USA watermelon farmer, harvester, packer, and shipper. Our farms are located up and down the East Coast and Midwest with a winter crop in Guatemala. I saw a post last week on how to pick a good watermelon and saw a lot of false or just misunderstood info regarding it. I though I would list a few facts to help you pick the best ones in the store. We ship to most major chain stores through the East Coast, Midwest with a few ending up on the West Coast\n\n*  Yellow/tan patch on the bottom - This is mostly true. That is a contact spot where the watermelon rests on the soil. Different varieties have different color patches. Some can be a golden color while others can be more tan or white. Size of the patch does not matter\n* A watermelon should feel heavy for it's size - This is correct but doesn't always mean sweetness. Contrary to what you might think watermelons don't like extremely wet growing environments or lots of rain. Watermelons grow the best in dry hot climates. A light watermelon might mean a watermelon has hollow heart (when you cut a watermelon open and the inside has separated). So you do always want it to fill heavy to ensure solid fruit. Also think of a watermelon like a sponge. The more rain/watering you do the more water is absorbed and the less sweet the watermelon will be. Usually in very dry growing seasons the watermelons are much sweeter. Again you can have a very heavy cardboard tasting watermelon. It's all about the correct amount of water\n* Slapping/thumping - This is 100% correct. You want it to sound like it's \"full\". Almost has a reverberation type sound. A flat sound like slapping the floor with your hand means it's bruised inside or has hollow heart. You do this with an open hand. This is also how we grade out bad ones while packing\n* Darker watermelons aren't as sweet - completely false. Watermelon varieties have different colors and rind patterns. That has nothing to do with sweetness\n* Seedless watermelons are GMO - completely false. There is no such thing as a GMO watermelon. Seedless is created with cross breeding different varieties. Similar to getting different breeds of mixed dogs or cats\n* Farmer's Markets - just wanted to add this. Some watermelons at farmer's markets throughout the country truly are grown by the hard working people you see managing the stands. However, most aren't. Most watermelons sold at farmer's markets are grade outs from farms like ours. We can't ship them to your local grocery store due to external/internal blemishes. Most chain stores have strict requirements on shipments and are inspected at every delivery before being received. They reject if we don't meet those requirements. This could be scarring, insect damage, bruising, hollow heart, sun burn, low sugar content ect... Most of these go to local cows who greatly enjoy eating them. Others are picked up and bought from us at a discount. They are then taken to farmer's markets and sold in bulk where they are then sold to the consumer. Ugly watermelons don't mean home grown most of the time. They mean we couldn't ship them to our customers\n* Shape (round, short, thin, fat) affects quality - it doesn't. Has nothing to do with anything quality related. Some farmers just like different varieties. Some are more shaped like a ball. Some or more shaped like a football. This hasn't nothing to do with quality. Ripples on the the rind/triangle shaped watermelons however can mean hollow heart but not always. You can always use the thump test to confirm. Watermelons can also be oddly shaped due to wind damage during growing. This also doesn't affect quality most of the time but we grade them out because no one will buy them\n* Shiny watermelon means wax is added for appearance - Completely false. Some varieties are shiner than others. It's that simple\n* Webbing, scarring, ugly marks = good watermelon - completely false. This has nothing to do with internal quality. Webbing in watermelon is caused by wind scars. When watermelons are young and the wind is blowing, dirt and the plant itself will hit the watermelon. As it grows it will show rind scars and webbing where that occurred. Some scarring is caused by insects which eats the external rind. Cucumber beetles would we one such pest. External scars and webbing have nothing to do with internal quality. It only affects outside appearance \n* Hollow heart watermelons are overripe - completely false. This is caused by stress during growing. Could be poor weather, poor pollination, too much fertilizer ect. They are perfectly safe to eat and I feel sometimes they are sweeter than others as the sugar around the heart is more concentrated due to the hollow middle\n* Rind stripes can show ripeness - this is true. You are almost looking for a white \"break\" on the rind stripe. It almost looks like a digital pattern. This will show that is ripe and ready for harvest. We also check in the fields by looking for dead tendrils on the vine. You can do this at home as well if you grow them yourself. Darker varieties make the rind patterns more difficult to see so we use many different ways to tell if a watermelon is ripe for harvest\n* Watermelons will continue to ripen off the vine - This is true (edit but they aren\u2019t technically ripening). And if you leave it outside for a day or so it will increase sugar concentration as extra water inside will escape. Just don't leave it in the hot sun or you will have problems. They don't like direct sunlight once they are harvested\nEdit - the perceived ripening is actually just increasing sugar concentration. As the water permeates through the rind, the sugar concentration inside the cells becomes higher\n* Elongated watermelons are watery - completely false. Again shape has little if not anything to do with taste\n* Seeded watermelons have better nutrition - completely false. We grow both seeded and seedless. Both have same nutritional content.\n\n Hope this helps some of you in your watermelon purchasing. I would be happy to answer any questions. Not doing this to benefit our company, but I would like everyone to buy more watermelons!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kcftt8/watermelon_misconceptions/", "created_utc": 1746123882.0, "score": 5496, "author": "tmills3131", "num_comments": 335, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kcftt8/watermelon_misconceptions/", "html_title": ""}

Buy air-chilled\n\n2. Make cutlets\n\n3. Salt properly\n\n  a. Light flour coating\n\n4. Cook to the correct temperature\n\nAnd if you are so inclined, I will cover each of these in great detail below. \n\n## 1. Air-chilled\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the saying \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d, right? Keep that in mind as I explain this. \n\nIn the US, more than 95% of chickens are processed using a liquid-cooled solution^[1](https://www.bellandevans.com/healthy-living/chlorinated-chicken-concerns-europe-overreacting/). This means they are submerged in ice-cold chlorinated water, and after this, some are then injected with a salt water brine solution, sometimes referred to as broth. As a result of this process, the chicken retains some of that water. It is easy to identify this if you read the fine print on the packaging. See examples below:\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 1%](https://i.imgur.com/gBSVam6.jpg)\n\n[Tyson brand, up to 3%](https://i.imgur.com/Vj333Dw.jpg)\n\n[Perdue brand, up to 10%](https://i.imgur.com/eRMgQr7.jpg)\n\n[Walmart brand, up to ***15%!!***](https://i.imgur.com/IBhQILK.png)\n\n\nFrozen chicken breasts are most often the ones that are also injected (sometimes called enhanced) with a salt water brine, and usually contain up to 15% retained water^[1](https://i.imgur.com/itbyASa.png) ^[2](https://i.imgur.com/eZS9RaD.jpg)\n\nSo why does this matter? Put simply, it is diluting the chicken flavor and changing the texture. Also, the weight of the chicken you are buying is calculated after it is injected or cooled in a bath. That means you are paying chicken prices for this added salt water.\n\nAir-chilled chicken is just as it sounds. Instead of submerging the chicken in ice-cold chlorinated water, these chickens are essentially chilled in a massive refrigerator. This is actually more expensive for the manufacturers, so that translates to higher prices for consumers. At my local grocery store, air chilled chicken breasts are over 3x the cost of standard chicken breasts ($1.99/lb vs $6.69/lb). Whether or not that is worth it is up to you, but I can tell you that I will never go back to the cheap breasts again. Again, just check the labels. Anything that is air-chilled will be labeled as such. See [here](https://i.imgur.com/AgzIUgl.jpg), [here](https://i.imgur.com/0OT2Z5Z.png), and [here](https://i.imgur.com/p4PoL8u.jpg). \n\nWhat about organic chicken? Well, not all organic chicken is air-chilled, and not all air-chilled chicken is organic. I personally do not think *organic* air-chilled chicken is worth the extra cost (around $10/lb near me), it does not taste any better than non-organic *air-chilled* chicken, in my experience. Keep in mind that any company that is producing air-chilled chicken is likely more concerned about producing a quality product than a company that is using liquid cooling. \n\n## 2. Cutlets \nPart of the challenge when cooking chicken breast is having a tapered piece of meat that will always cook unevenly. This will result in the thin side being completely overdone when the thickest side is perfect. Or if the thin side is perfect, the thickest side is still raw. So the only way to combat this is to make the entire piece the same thickness. [Enter the cutlet](https://i.imgur.com/egyDjGE.jpg). \n\nYou will absolutely need a very sharp knife for this, but since that is arguably the #1 most important tool in the kitchen, it\u2019s safe for me to assume that you already have one of those, right? I like to use a boning knife for this, but a chef\u2019s knife will work. \n\nIf your chicken breasts have the tenderloin still attached, you will want to cut that off and cook it separately because it will create an air pocket, and sometimes things will not cook properly if it is still attached. [See here](https://youtu.be/2BeQftjYNO4?t=21). Just think of it as a bonus for the cook.\n\nNow this next step is sort of optional, but if you are working with very large breasts (around 7-9 ounces each), then I consider it mandatory. Use your very sharp knife that you most definitely already have, and slice that chicken breast in half *horizontally*. [See here](https://youtu.be/MrVIHL7JkTM?t=126). Alternatively, you can cut them in half *vertically* first, and then slice the thicker end in half horizontally. This will create smaller portions, if you would like, and it will be a bit easier to cut them horizontally. [See here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=23).\n\nNow that you have your portions ready, you need to ensure they are all an even thickness by *gently* pounding them to about \u00bc\u201d-\u00bd\u201d thickness. Emphasis on gently because it is very possible to explode your chicken breasts. Lay some plastic wrap over the chicken cutlets and use a meat pounder or mallet on the thickest parts of the cutlets. The key is to create an even thickness, it doesn\u2019t really matter how thick they actually are. You will see this process in the video I linked to above. If you do not have a meat pounder or mallet, you can use a small pot. \n\n## 3. Salt \nThis should be a very deliberate thing. Salt and savory cooking are a package deal. There should never be a time where you forget salt, because it should just be second nature to add salt to things that you want to taste good. Bland and lacking salt are synonymous. \nWhen it comes to cooking chicken (and meat in general), it should be even more deliberate. Salt not only enhances the flavor of our food, but in the case of chicken breast, it actually helps to retain much of the liquid that is lost during the cooking process, and creates more tender cooked chicken. [Here](https://www.seriouseats.com/2012/11/the-food-lab-the-truth-about-brining-turkey-thanksgiving.html) is a very thorough write-up if you want to read more about it. \n\nOn top of retaining more liquid, it obviously adds flavor, but it\u2019s very easy to add too much, or too little. We\u2019ve all heard that we should \u201csalt to taste\u201d, but there are some things where this doesn\u2019t work very well, like salting your raw chicken breast before cooking it. Fortunately, the good folks at [Cook\u2019s Illustrated have this figured out for us](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5681-salting-meat) (the formatting of that page seems to be broken currently). I can personally attest that the amount of salt listed in the aforementioned article is perfect, for my and my family\u2019s tastes, you may want a bit more or a bit less. \u00be teaspoon of Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pound of boneless poultry is what they suggest. The brand of salt is also very important. If you aren\u2019t already aware, 1 teaspoon table salt = 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton kosher salt = 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt^[1](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/5799-salt-types-and-measurements)\n\nSo let\u2019s look at a realistic example: Say you bought a package of fresh air-chilled chicken breast and the total weight listed on the package is 1.67 pounds. How much salt do you add? ***Edit: this part is not true!*** ~~Well, for starters, that weight is for the entire package of chicken, not just the meat you are going to be eating. Surprise! That\u2019s right, grocery stores weigh the entire package when printing their labels, so you are paying for the packaging as well.~~ So if you start with a package that is 1.67 pounds, you can safely round down to 1.5 pounds, so that means 1.5 teaspoons of Diamond Crystal brand kosher salt, or \u00be teaspoon of any fine table salt. \n\n*When* you add the salt is also very important. Unlike spices and herbs, salt actually penetrates fully throughout the meat, and it does so at a rate that increases as the temperature increases. \n\nAssuming you have cutlets and pounded them thin, next you will want to sprinkle on the appropriate amount of salt, let it sit on a plate or baking sheet at room temp while you continue prepping the rest of your meal. Since this should be your first step, your chicken will only be sitting out for about 30 minutes at room temp, so it is perfectly safe. \n\nBecause salt is hygroscopic, it will begin to draw the moisture out of the chicken, which will in turn dissolve the salt, and then most of that salt water will be reabsorbed back into the chicken. You can actually watch this process happen if you take a close look at your salted chicken every 5 minutes or so. \n\nAt this point, feel free to take whatever creative measures you wish with any other spices or herbs. But the point should remain that salt is the #1 concern at this stage. In fact, a properly salted chicken breast will taste good without the addition of any other spices or herbs. I would even suggest that you try this first so that you can establish a baseline for what good chicken should taste like.\n\nNext, before cooking, there is one final semi-optional step. I say semi-optional because I think the only exception for skipping this is if you have Celiac disease or are counting calories. \n\n### 3a. Flour\n\nCoating your cutlets in a very light layer of flour will protect the outer surface of the chicken from the high heat and it prevents the edges of the chicken from becoming too dry. It really does wonders for the final product. You can see this process in one of the previous videos I linked to, [here](https://youtu.be/vp_fnC12UrQ?t=111). You only need a couple tablespoons of flour per breast, this is not fried chicken. Even if you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, I\u2019m sure you could simply use alternative flours for this. \n\n## 4. Cook\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we talk about temperature first. I think the #1 concern for most people about cooking chicken is that you ensure it is cooked thoroughly, as to kill off any salmonella that may be present. The FDA/USDA tells us that we should cook our chicken to 165F because that is the temperature that salmonella (and most other bad bacteria) are killed instantly at, and this just simplifies everything so that there is only one standard to remember, and it is safe for all types of immune systems. What they are not telling you is that bacteria (including salmonella) can be killed off by both temperature *and* time. This is how we pasteurize dairy products without cooking them. You hold them at very specific temperatures for very specific amounts of time. \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about temperatures. Remember, 165F is the temp in which bacteria are killed *instantly*. Unfortunately, your chicken is damn near overcooked at this point. You can safely cook your chicken to 150F as long as it maintains a minimum of 150F for just 3 minutes. [This source](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/07/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-chicken-breast.html) has a very clear time and temperature chart for a reference, and all data comes from the same people that told you to cook to 165F. So once your chicken reaches a minimum of 150F in the thickest part (since you\u2019ve presumably made evenly sized cutlets, there should be no drastically different \u201cthickest part\u201d), you want to pull it from the hot pan and let it sit on a plate (ideally a warmed plate) for at least 5 minutes. Remember to check the temperature in several different spots of the chicken so you can be sure. During the resting time, the temperature will actually rise a bit, thanks to carry over cooking, by about 2-5 degrees or so. Thicker cuts rise more, thinner cuts rise less. If it actually reaches 155F, then everything bad will have been killed off in less than 48 seconds. \n\nI will add a disclaimer here to say that if you are cooking for any children, elderly, pregnant women, or otherwise immunocompromised, cooking to 165F is always the safest option. \n\nSo if you haven\u2019t figured this out yet, you will absolutely need a digital instant read thermometer. This isn\u2019t something you can or should guess at. The thermometer is mandatory, it\u2019s as simple as that. I can provide some good recommendations for different budgets if you would like.  \n\nI will always opt for pan frying in this case. I do not think baking thinly sliced chicken breasts with a light coating of flour will work well. In fact, this entire post is basically to discourage people from trying to bake their oversized chicken breasts in the oven. It\u2019s just not a good method, for many reasons. We really need the high heat and direct contact of a skillet to achieve some browning. Browning things creates new flavors, it is important, and it should be something you are deliberately trying to achieve. \n\nI prefer a stainless steel pan for this, but cast iron will work as well. You want to pre-heat your pan over med-high heat with at least 2 tablespoons of oil in it. You will need slightly more oil than you would normally use, as the light coating of flour will soak up a good amount of the oil. Once that oil begins to shimmer and then you see the first wisps of smoke, it is time to add the chicken. \n\nWe are using a hard and fast cooking style. Since these cutlets are so thin, they will cook very quickly, so we want to achieve a deeply browned exterior before overcooking the middle, which is only possible over fairly high heat. \n\nSlowly lay down each cutlet into the hot oil so that you are moving your hand away from you, as to avoid any hot oil splashes. You should hear a hard sizzle almost immediately, this is a good sign. Most 12\u201d skillets should be able to easily fit 3 cutlets at one time, maybe 4 depending on the size of chicken. This is also a good time to use a splatter screen, if you have one. \n\nAfter adding the chicken, you may want to turn the heat up to high, but be ready to turn it back down again if things get too dark, too quickly. Let the chicken cook undisturbed until the edges of the chicken begin to turn white. Then it\u2019s time to start peaking at the bottom. It\u2019s probably a good idea to rotate each cutlet 180 degrees so that they brown more evenly. You probably have some hotspots in your pan. Once each cutlet achieves a deeply browned surface on the one side, then flip it. If you notice the pan is rather dry when you flip it, add more oil to the spot that is dry. Now keep cooking the second side until you reach a minimum 150F internal temp. You should be more concerned about this temperature than you are about browning on the second side. Now pull each cutlet and transfer them to a warmed plate to rest for 5 minutes. \n\n## Bonus - Pan Sauces\nSo now that you have your pan-fried chicken cutlets resting, it\u2019s a perfect opportunity to make a pan sauce. In fact, this cooking method is worth doing just for this opportunity alone. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t use a nonstick skillet, you should now see a lot of [built up brown bits](https://i.imgur.com/M45PnAv.jpg), called fond, on the bottom of your pan. If you did use a nonstick skillet, well, then no fond for you! If the fond looks black and burnt, your heat was too high for too long, and you should skip this step. \nPut your pan back on the heat, medium heat is fine. Get your fond hot, and before it starts to darken, you need to add liquid. You can simply add water, but chicken stock is a better option. If you have it, some white wine along with the water or stock is also a great idea. How much? It doesn\u2019t really matter. Maybe enough so that it\u2019s at least \u215b\u201d deep. Now, bring it to a simmer, and use a flat wooden spoon and start scraping all of that fond up until the bottom of the pan is completely clean. Once you\u2019ve achieved that, let it simmer until it\u2019s reduced slightly. The residual flour in the pan should help thicken the sauce ever so slightly. It\u2019s easy to over reduce at this point, since you are using a wide and shallow pan, so take it off the heat as soon as it\u2019s where you want it. \n\nAt this point, you just need to stir in 1-2 tablespoons of butter and then give it a taste. Add salt until it tastes good. That\u2019s about as simple as you can go, or you can do any of the following to make it even better\n\n* Before adding the liquid, add 1 tablespoon of flour to the fond and cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, or until the flour begins to toast. This will add more flavor and more body to the pan sauce.\n\n* Along with the flour, add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, and cook until the tomato paste turns rust colored. This adds even more flavor. \n\n* To your cold water or boxed stock, sprinkle on a packet of unflavored gelatin and allow it to bloom for a couple minutes before adding to the hot pan. This adds more body to your pan sauce. You don\u2019t need to do this if you are using homemade stock. \n\n* Before adding the liquid, add some minced shallots and a bit of oil to the hot pan and cook for a couple minutes.\n\n* After adding the butter, whisk in some fresh lemon juice and capers or dijon mustard. The addition of acid is almost always a good idea. \n\n---\n\nLastly, a message to all of the chicken thigh cult members out there, because I know that you are a passionate bunch.

{"title": "Toum is an insanely fluffy garlic sauce that comes from the Levant, and Shatta is a spicy fiery chilli sauce served all over the Middle East. Together they are the perfect condiments for sandwiches and grilled foods, full recipes inside", "selftext": "If you buy a shawarma or grilled meat sandwich at any Middle Eastern restaurant, you've likely had both these sauces without realising. They're so ubiquitous in Middle eastern cuisines and essential for saucing up anything, I've had them with dozens of different foods and have yet to find one they don't go with. [Here's how my sauces turned out](https://imgur.com/a/3Wb4GIW)  \n\n  \nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link to the full video recipe](https://youtu.be/ifOlf3COK4s)\n\n## What are Toum and Shatta\nToum in arabic means garlic, and it's also the name given to a specific garlic sauce from the Levant region of the Middle East. It's made by finely grinding garlic into a paste, then emulsifying it with oil and lemon to make a fluffy and delicious garlic sauce. It is closely related to the [Spanish Aioli](https://www.sweetandsabroso.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/18-2557-post/Alioli-with-Ingredients01.jpg), though there is a slight difference in colour and texture. The sauce is also called Thomeya in some countries and has become synonymous with Shawarma partly due to the spread of [Syrian shawarma](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ad/98/72/ad9872f27e3c157e178a4f098bf4aec9.jpg) stores throughout the region. Though most countries in the region have their own garlic sauces of some form, few have earned the reputation that Toum has. The primary difference between Toum and most of the other garlic sauces, is that Toum is very simply an emulsion of garlic and oil, other sauces such as the Egyptian Thomeya, or the saudi version usually contain Cream, Milk or eggs. The exclusion of these and the creation of a real stable emulsion, results in a fluffy sauce with the texture of a mayonnaise but 100% vegan, which means it can last a whole month in the fridge without deteriorating.\n\nI've had Toum with all manner of foods, from falafel and shawarma, to pizza and chicken wings, and they've all been great. I find that it's also a great mayo substitute in sandwiches particulary smoked turkey or grilled cheese sandwiches. The only downside to this sauce is that you'll have a serious case of garlic breath for a few hours after eating it, but lifes short and you deserve this sauce.\n\nShatta (pronounced Shut-Ta) is the generic name given to chilli sauce, though it can also be known as Salsa Har (Hot Sauce) and this is usually made using a blend of fresh chillies. Unlike Toum there is no one specific recipe or formula that most people or nations follow and it can vary from restaurant to restaurant let alone city to city. The middle east has a number of famous hot sauces such as North African [Harrissa](https://www.196flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/harissa-1-FP.jpg) and [Yemeni Sahawiq](https://www.afewlovelythings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zahawiq-1-e1475235413724.jpg) (I don't know why some people spell it Zhug or Schug) but Shatta is definitely the most widely spread. I spent some time experimenting to put together a sauce that tastes similar to what you get in most shawarma stores, or with grilled meat platters and I think it came out perfectly. This sauce uses a combination of different pepper varieties to build heat at different levels, as well as some spices that round out the flavors.\n\nIf you love sauces, I think you should give both of these a try. They're extremely versatile and can be used to fill sandwiches, spice up some grilled meat or vegetables, or even just eaten with some bread as a dip. \n\n## Historical context\nGarlic has been consumed in the Middle East for thousands of years, even being found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. It was said to be a highly revered ingredient amongst the ancient Egyptians and was thought of as both a food and medicine. In the Ebers Papyrus a pharaonic medical text, garlic is said to give vitality, soothe flatulence and aid digestion, mild laxative, shrinks hemorrhoids, and rids body of \"spirits\". Garlic was also used widely in Mesopotamian cuisine, in what is now the site of the Levantine countries, with many recipes still surviving to this day, such a stew with garlic and leeks. \n\nI couldn't find any specific mention of Toum as a sauce going back in history, but my search was partly complicated by the name Toum also just meaning garlic. While the process of Making toum has changed in the past century with the introduction of the food processor and blenders, it has been made by hand for a lot longer. The traditional way to make Toum is by grinding garlic in a mortar and pestle, then slowly adding in small amounts of oil and working it in. Some restaurants still make it this way, though it is a labor intensive process. It also results in a more solid sauce than the food processor does, and it has a more gloopy texture.\n\nThe chilli didn't make it's way out of South America until the 15th century, but it quickly found a home in the Middle East. Many Middle Eastern dishes already utilized heat producing spices such as Pepper and Cumin in large amounts, so it's natural that chilli peppers quickly became a part of local cuisine. The emergence of an alternative to expensive black pepper and the ease of its cultivation, quickly reshaped many dishes in the area. It's thought that by 1569 Hungary (under the rule of ottomans) began cultivating peppers which later became the base of their national dish.\n\nSince the introduction of the Chilli pepper, there are variations which have become synonymous with Middle Eastern cuisine such as Aleppo Pepper (Pul Biber), which is thought to have been cultivated and bred in Aleppo, Syria. It's not clear when chilli sauce became a feature in Middle Eastern cuisine, but it's likely that it spread through the Ottoman empire, where it was common for popular dishes to quickly make their way across the different territories. Unfortunately it's not easy to identify what varieties are mostly used in the Middle East and getting fresh Aleppo Peppers is very difficult. So this sauce is my closest approximation to how a Shatta would taste.\n\n## Flavor profile\n\n### Garlic Sauce\nThe garlic sauce has an extremely strong garlic flavor that obviously comes from the copious amount of garlic used in the dish. Using fresh garlic will give you a sweeter and more milder garlic flavor, while regular supermarket garlic will give you a more sharp and spicy bite that comes from the Allicin within the garlic. As the garlic ages the amount of allicin grows which is why aged garlic is a lot more pungent. The addition of Lemon Juice adds a necessary brightness and sourness that is desperately needed in the sauce. If you use a neutral vegetable oil (as suggested), you won't get any further flavors in the garlic sauce, however some people do use olive oil and of course that imparts an olive flavor on the sauce.\n\nThe garlic sauce is also notable for its texture, it has a fluffy and creamy texture that is similar to creme fraiche. It's quite a thick yet light consistency owing to the emulsified oil within it.\n\n### Shatta (Chilli Sauce)\nThis chilli sauce recipe has a deep and slow burning heat that is common among Middle Eastern chilli sauces. You do of course get a kick of heat when you first eat it, but it slowly builds thanks to the combination of different Chilli pepper types as well as the addition of some \"hot\" spices. Using fresh chilli peppers also gives you the brightness and freshness that you would expect from eating freshly ground chillies, notably when first made, this sauce will be a little sweet and over the next few days the flavors will develop significantly. The addition of Onion, Garlic and Ginger rounds out the flavor of the sauce so that you aren't just getting a ton of heat. Adding Lemon and Vinegar, turns up the acid in the sauce, which helps make it a bit lighter but also enhances the other flavors.\n\nIn this recipe I used Habaneros, Cayenne Peppers and fresh paprikas. The Habaneros add a large amount of deep burning heat and a fresh fruity flavor. The Cayenne Peppers add some medium heat, that gives a sharp immediate kick and a long sustained burn. Finally the paprikas are there for a deeper more mellow flavor, as well as their delicious fresh fruity flavor. I also roast the peppers to bring out their cooked flavors rather than raw, as I find it helps to make the heat less sudden and better sustained. The addition of Cumin, Coriander and smoked paprika, is there to round out the sauce and add some more traditional middle eastern flavors. \n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Toum (Garlic Sauce)\n* 150g (5.3 Oz) Garlic\n* 135g (about 1/2 cup) Lemon juice\n* 600g (21 oz) Neutral Vegetable Oil - Sunflower preferred\n* 1 Tsp Salt\n\n### Shatta (Chilli Sauce)\n* 100g (3.5 oz) Habaneros\n* 200g (7 oz) Cayenne Peppers\n* 300g (10.5 oz) Fresh Paprikas\n* 3-4 Cloves of garlic\n* 1 Brown Onion\n* 3 Tbsp Olive oil\n* 3 Tbsp Lemon juice\n* 1 Tbsp White vinegar\n* 1 Tbsp Sugar\n* 1-2 Tsp Cayenne Pepper (optional and should only be used if your sauce isn't spicy enough)\n* 2 Tsp Garlic powder\n* 1 Tsp Fresh ginger\n* 1 Tsp Ground cumin\n* 1 Tsp Ground coriander\n* 1 Tsp Salt \n* 1/4 Tsp Smoked Paprika\n\n## Directions\n\n### Garlic sauce directions:\n1. Peel your garlic and slice your cloves in half along their narrow side. In the center is a slightly green or yellow section which looks like a small plant, this is the garlic germ and it tastes bitter, pulling it out will make the garlic sauce taste a lot better. \n2. Remove the [garlic germ](https://www.seriouseats.com/2018/03/20180216-bagna-cauda-vicky-wasik-3.jpg) from the center of each clove, it should come out if you bend your clove on either side of the germ, but if you want you can cut it out. You should have 150g after degerming your garlic\n3. Juice about 2 lemons and strain the juice to remove all pulp and seeds, these can cause the emulsification to break and so must be removed.\n4. Place your garlic and salt in your food processor and process until finely minced. This should take about 2 minutes. Every 15-30 seconds scrape down the side of the food processor to get the garlic moving again. The garlic should be very finely minced when you are done with this.\n5. When the garlic is finely minced add a teaspoon of lemon juice and process again for a minute, scraping the bowl every 15 seconds. The garlic should slowly form a thick paste \n6. Add one more teaspoon of lemon and process for another minute or two until a fluffy and fine paste form. There should be no obvious chunks of garlic left and the paste should be well whipped\n7. When the garlic has fluffed up, start your food processor, and slowly drizzle in 1/2 a cup of the oil. You should drizzle it in a flow as thin as a thread, and do not stop the machine until the recipe is completed. It's hard to maintain a constant stream so check my video to see how you can make your own emulsification resevoir out of a plastic cup that will make sure you get a very thin drizzle. As you drizzle the oil in, the garlic will emulsify into a sauce, you should take about 2 minutes with the first half cup.  Do not proceed with the recipe until the first half cup has emulsified and thickened and your food processor contains a mixture that looks like a liquid mayonnaise\n8. Once the first half cup has emulsified you should slowly drizzle in a tablespoon of lemon juice\n9. Alternate drizzling in 1/2 a cup of oil and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice until both have finished. You should drizzle them in as slow as possible. This stage will take about 8-10 minutes. Make sure to wait at least 30 seconds before switching from oil to lemon so that you can ensure it has all been incorporated.\n10. Once completed, place the sauce in a container and place a paper towel directly on the sauce, this will wick away any excess moisture or oil. Let it rest overnight before serving\n\n**I would highly recommend watching the video for this as you need to see the visual queues of when to add your oil and how slow to go with the drizzling, also read the notes below**\n\n### Chilli sauce directions:\n\n**Wear some gloves for this or you will hate your life**\n\n1. Slice the top off of each chilli and remove the pith and seeds\n2. Peel your ginger and slice into thin slivers\n3. Peel your onion and slice into quarters\n4. Place the peppers, onion, ginger and garlic on a baking sheet and drizzle on 1 Tbsp of olive oil as well as 1 Tsp of salt\n5. Bake in a 180c or 350f oven for 20-30 minutes until the chillies are cooked and slightly browned. Remove and let cool before moving forward\n6. Place all the baked ingredients into a food processor and process into a fine paste\n7. Add the remaining ingredients apart from the lemon juice and cayenne pepper, then blend until well mixed and a thick chilli sauce has formed\n8. Taste the sauce and see if it's spicy enough, if not, add the cayenne pepper and blend once more\n9. Add the lemon juice and mix in, your chilli sauce is ready\n10. Place the chilli sauce in a container and refrigerate overnight, the flavors will develop over the next 24-48 hours\n\n## Notes and tips\n\n* The emulsification can break really easily, if your emulsification does not work then check out the serious eats toum video where they explain how you can fix it using an egg white\n* Going slow with your oil and lemon is essential, most food processors will come with an emulsification reservoir that you can add liquid to and it will slowly trickle in. If you don't have one, you can make one by poking a hole in the bottom of a plastic cup\n* Heat is the enemy of an emulsification and so placing your oil in the fridge for a couple of hours before using, will help it setup quicker. You can also place the lemon juice in the fridge as well\n* Make sure your food processor, lid and blades are completely dry before starting. Too much moisture at the start of an emulsification can cause it to break\n* Please wear gloves when handling chillies, I did not and my hands burned for hours afterwards. I tried to clean them with Soap, Vinegar, Alcohol, Lemon Juice, Diluted bleach, Hand sanitizer and nothing really helped that much.

{"title": "Tip: cook rice faster and add more flavor", "selftext": "Sometimes, we want really sticky, globby rice. If that's what you want all the time, disregard the following. \n\nI work at a pizzeria with a Mexican guy from Puebla. He did something to his rice I'd never done before when just making regular rice, and it's something I've been doing ever since. And that is to lightly saute the rice in the pot on high heat with a little bit of oil and spices, for a few minutes, just until some of the kernels start to turn golden/toast colored, and then add warm water. \n\nMy girlfriend loves indian food, and a lot of times I'll add cardamom pods and cumin to the rice, traditionally just steaming the spices in there. Dry sauteing the rice first with the spices bloomed in a little bit of oil has led to very flavorful rice, but it has had a two fold effect, in that it now allows me to cook rice a lot faster. \n\nAfter sauteing for just couple minutes and then adding the warm water, the pot is already so hot that the water comes to a boil within 1 minute. After that, the rice cooks in about 8 minutes.\n\nIt's lovely, adds a great color and flavor to the rice, and allows us to get dinner even faster. Wanted to share the tip, it's completely changed my rice game. I wouldn't recommend it for higher starch sticky rice like sushi rice, but any other time, this is my new move.\n\nEdit: I am aware of what rice-a-roni is, thanks guys.\n\nEdit 2: mentioned it in the comments but I'm cooking this in a stainless steel calphalon pot, which retains heat (not *conducts* heat) better than a normal aluminum pot, and probably contributes to a faster cooking time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hm6c90/tip_cook_rice_faster_and_add_more_flavor/", "created_utc": 1594036832.0, "score": 5317, "author": "FramingHips", "num_comments": 486, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/hm6c90/tip_cook_rice_faster_and_add_more_flavor/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Basic Chinese Knife Skills 101 (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5200\u6280\u5de7) - I sat down and interviewed my dad about how to use, sharpen, and make sure your knives last a lifetime!", "selftext": "Recently I took it upon myself to start documenting my dad's experiences and recipes over his 50 years as a Chinese chef.\n\nHis two knives are among his most prized possessions (they're almost 40 years old, older than I am!)\n\nSo, I figured I'd do an interview with him to learn all of his tips and perspectives on how to use and care for his knives. There's a lot of info in here that applies to all sorts of knives, but the focus is on how he maintains his own knives.\n\nDisclaimer - There are a lot of ways to use and maintain Chinese chef knives. Everything here is just my dad's take on the matter.\n\nEdit: Added a picture of my dad's [40 year old chef knife](https://imgur.com/z7UBMQh)\n\n# A Primer on Chinese Knives\n\nThere are two major types of knives you might find in a Chinese kitchen:\n\n* A Chinese chef knife\n* A Chinese cleaver\n\nOn the blade, there are 3 sections. Each has a different purpose.\n\n* Root - d\u014du g\u0101n \u5200\u6839 (closest to the handle)\n* Belly - d\u014du t\u00f3uh \u5200\u809a (the middle of the blade)\n* Tip - d\u014du j\u012bm \u5200\u5c16 (furthest from the handle)\n\n**The versatility of a Chinese chef knife**\n\nEven though it\u2019s sometimes called a Chinese cleaver, this type of knife is much thinner than other cleavers that are designed to hack through bones or thick meats.\n\nIn Cantonese, it\u2019s called a choi d\u014du (\u83dc\u5200), which literally means \u201cvegetable knife\u201d if you split up the characters. (Also known as a \"cai dao\" in Mandarin.)\n\nA Chinese chef knife is incredibly versatile, like a Swiss army knife without all of its extensions.\n\n* Cutting: You can do everything from julienning vegetables to jointing chickens.\n* Scooping: My dad often uses the blade to scoop and move chopped ingredients around.\n* Crushing: My dad uses the side of the blade as a blunt surface to crush garlic or create purees.\n* Tenderizing: My dad often hits pork with the dull back of the blade to soften meat up.\n\nMy dad's particular chef knife is about 40 years old, which speaks to how well my dad takes care of his stuff as well as the durability of the knife. It's made of stainless steel, with a beautiful wooden handle.\n\nHe uses this knife 95% of the time, replacing an entire set of kitchen knives. There are a lot of great Chinese chef knives out there, but the exact knife my dad uses is Dexter Russell's Traditional 8\"-3.5\" Chef Knife (with a wooden handle.)\n\n**The power of a Chinese cleaver**\n\nThis knife is meant for chopping through thick meats and bones.\n\nIts construction is typically heavier and thicker, and the blade and handle are generally one continuous piece of metal.\n\nWith a meat cleaver, you always chop landing your blows with the root of the knife (closest to the handle).\n\n* Chopping with the root of the knife keeps your knife in one piece.\n* Let's say the blade is 8 inches long. If you were to chop bones with the tip of the knife as opposed to the root of the knife you place \\~8X the amount of reactive force and stress on the handle and on your hands, eventually breaking the handle.\n\nMy dad also will sometimes stick the belly of the knife in place, and then press down with his hands to further drive the blade through a thick piece of root or bone.\n\nMy dad's particular cleaver was made in Jiangmen / Kongmoon, a city in Guangdong Province which is famed for its high quality knives.\n\nThe exact brand is Sanhangwa \u4e09\u6841\u74e6 (which I couldn't find online), and the knife is made of stainless steel.\n\n# How to sharpen a Chinese chef knife\n\n**An overview of the main sharpening tools**\n\nThere are three primary tools my dad uses to sharpen his knives at home and at the restaurant:\n\n* The whetstone\n* The honing rod / steel\n* The dinner plate\n\nNotably, he doesn't use any sort of electronic or machine sharpener, which would quickly ruin the blade.\n\n**Why do we sharpen knives?**\n\nIt\u2019s counterintuitive, but a sharper knife actually causes fewer injuries. Simply due to the law of averages, a sharper knife leads to fewer cuts, which lowers the chance of injury.\n\nAlso, you'll cry less. When cutting an onion, if your knife is dull, you will damage the onion's cell structure and release a chemical called \"lachrymatory factor\", which makes you cry. A sufficiently sharp knife leaves cells intact and eyes dry.\n\n**What makes a knife dull?**\n\nYou can imagine the blade of every knife as having tiny microscopic teeth (like the huge teeth of a serrated knife).\n\nYour knife's effectiveness depends on these teeth to be both:\n\n* Present\n* Aligned\n\n**Honing vs Sharpening Your Knife**\n\nSharpening = New Teeth\n\n* Sharpening means that you're actually removing a relatively significant amount of material from the blade to produce a new sharp edge. This is usually done less frequently.\n\nHoning = Aligning Teeth\n\n* Honing is like giving your knife some braces. It's more of a polish that maintains sharpness. It does remove SOME material, but not nearly as much as running your knife against a whetstone.\n\nIf your knife is dull, you always sharpen first, hone second.\n\n**One-Sided Bevel**\n\nMy dad prefers to sharpen his knife with a one-sided bevel.\n\nThis means that one side of the knife is sharpened at a 15-20 angle, and the other side is sharpened parallel to the stone.\n\nThis is a lot more clear in the video, but if you're holding the knife, the \"palm\" side of the knife is sharpened flat, and the \"fingernail\" side of the knife is sharpened at a slant.\n\nWith a one-sided bevel, slices of meat or vegetable will naturally fall out of the way, which helps my dad be more efficient when cutting lots of stuff (he used to cut 40-50 pounds of meat every day).\n\n**How do you know what angle to sharpen your knife at?**\n\nMy dad sharpens his knife based on intuition, but a great starting point is to go with a 15-20 angle.\n\nTo estimate this, /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt has a wonderful explanation of this in his YouTube video on \"How to Sharpen a Knife with a Whetstone\":\n\n* Take the width of the knife, divide it by 3 or 4, and lift it up by that distance.\n\nWhatever angle you're going with, try to hold your knife at the same angle throughout the entire motion.\n\n**How often do you need to sharpen a knife?**\n\nAt home, my dad sharpens his knives with a whetstone 3 to 4 times a year.\n\nWhen my dad used to work as a chef, he'd use the whetstone every two days, and he'd use his honing rod multiple times a day.\n\n**How do you test the sharpness of your knife?**\n\nMy dad uses his fingernails (like a boss), which was a little jarring to watch at first, but it actually is one of the most convenient and effective ways to test sharpness.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen people testing out their knives by slicing paper. However, this is actually pretty easy to do even with a fairly dull knife, whereas that same dull knife will glide across your fingernail.\n\nI came across a very informative chart (Google: \"Knife Grinders Sharpness Chart.pdf\" that quantifies \"sharpness\" with actual measurements, and the minimum sharpness it takes to perform certain tests.\n\n* Paper: knife starts tearing paper at 1 micron edge (considered dull)\n* Fingernail: knife catches on a nail at 0.7 micron edge (considered a working edge)\n\nThis isn't to say that paper doesn't work as a sharpness test (it's also very fun to do), but if you're a knife, it's a test that's very easy to pass.\n\nAnd practically speaking, as long as you\u2019re careful, it\u2019s a lot easier to use your nail than it is to find a piece of paper, especially if you\u2019re a busy chef in a restaurant like my dad.\u00a0\n\n**Using a whetstone**\n\nThe primary tool my dad uses to sharpen his knife is called a sharpening stone or whetstone, or \"m\u00f2h d\u014du sehk \u78e8\u5200\u77f3\" in Cantonese.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in getting a sharpening stone for yourself, a great starter is the King KDS 1000/6000 whetstone, which you can find on Amazon.\n\nMost brands label their whetstones with one or more \u201cgrit\u201d numbers, which mostly refers to the size of the abrasive particles in the stone. The higher the grit number, the smoother and sharper the finish. The lower the grit number, the quicker the knife\u2019s material gets removed.\n\nIf your knife is dull or even damaged, generally you\u2019d start sharpening your knife with a lower grit rating, and then you\u2019d use a stone with a higher grit rating to get a more razor sharp edge.\n\nHere's an overview of what you'd do:\n\n* *Wet the whetstone* \\- Depending on the stone you get, either splash some water on it or fully submerge it in water. This helps \"lubricate\" the stone.\n* *Flatten your stone* with.. a flattening stone. This ensures that your whetstone's surface is even. (note: my dad didn't do this during our interview)\n* *Sharpen* \\- For my dad's one-bevel method - hold one side of the knife at a 15-20 angle and push it back and forth across the stone. Flip the knife over and lay it flat.\n* *Sharpen again* \\- Depending on how dull or sharp your knife is, you might want to switch to a stone with a higher grit rating (or just flip your stone over if it comes with two grits), and repeat the process.\n\nAdding water generally acts as a sort of lubricant for the friction that\u2019s produced as we sharpen the knife against the stone. The water mixes together with the loose particles from the stone and knife to create a slurry, which helps to further polish the knife\u2019s edge and sharpen the blade.\u00a0\n\nMy dad was also saying that in certain cases, the water helps keep reduce some of the frictional heat, which helps to avoid any potential warping that might occur.\u00a0\n\n**Using a honing rod**\n\nKnown as a m\u00f2hd\u014dugwan \u78e8\u5200\u68cd, my dad used a honing rod multiple times a day when he worked in restaurants.\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to do this, but with my dad's one-sided bevel method:\n\n* Hold the rod in your dominant hand, hold the knife in your other hand.\n* Repeatedly run the edge of blade across the rod, holding the slanted-bevel side of the knife with a more pronounced angle than the flat-bevel side of the knife\n\nOne thing to highlight on most honing rods - the handle is slightly flared, so it helps protects your hands from getting cut if you move your knife too far down.\n\n**Using a dinner plate**\n\nIf you don't have a sharpening stone, you can also use the rough bottom of a ceramic plate or cup as a surface to sharpen your knife against.\n\nMy dad HAS a sharpening stone, and still prefers to use a plate sometimes because it's so easy to grab and use.\n\nJust like you would with a whetstone or honing rod, be mindful of the angles you're holding and pushing the knife with.\n\n# How to clean a Chinese chef knife\n\nMy dad uses a sponge with some dish soap and wipes down each side of the blade and handle. The main concern here is just to avoid cutting yourself.\n\nNotably, he is NOT using a dishwasher (for different reasons - I think my parents don't use a dishwasher because they're stereotypically frugal Asian parents.)\n\nI highly recommend against putting your precious knives inside of them for several reasons.\n\nBy doing so, you create an unnecessary risk of injury, and it\u2019s also just terrible for the knife itself.

However, at my local grocery store yesterday, they had a special going on that was $13.99 for a bone-in ribeye. I thought it was too good to pass up, so I got one that was about 1.3 pounds. \n\nGot home and immediately sprinkled with kosher salt and then set on a wire rack in the fridge to dry brine for around 3-4 hours. 45 minutes before cooking, I took the steak out to bring up to room temperature. I ground some pepper and seasoned all over (like I had done previously with the salt). \n\nI set my oven to 270F. On a baking sheet, I crushed about 7-8 cloves of garlic and spread them out about the size of the steak, then covered with thyme sprigs and drizzled olive oil over it.

{"title": "If you've never had Libyan food before, I'd highly encourage you to try Mbakbaka. A one pot lamb and pasta dish that is seasoned with a uniquely warm and earthy spice mix. Recipe and guaranteed enjoyment inside", "selftext": "Most people know very little about Libya, and even less about Libyan culture. It's a country that for millenia has been a cross roads of civilisations and an important trading hub even stretching back to the time of the Romans. With so many cultures overlapping, the cuisine has  come together as part arab, part african, part berber and part european. It's an interesting blend that leads to dishes such as Mbakbaka, a meat stew to which pasta is added. The result is one of the most [amazing and unique pasta dishes](https://imgur.com/a/Wi7Kz3f) I've ever had, and one that is perfectly suited to cold winter evenings. It resembles a traditional Ragu with chunky pieces of meat, however the flavors are far from anything cooked in Italy.\n\nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyMqTA9dfkA) to the full video recipe. I've also left links in the comments to all my previous r/cooking posts.\n\n## What is Mbakbaka\nThis strangely named food is the pride and joy of Libyan people, and is regarded as a quintessential Libyan food. It gets it's name from the noise it makes (bak-bak-bak-bak-bak) as the thickened stew boils when pasta is added. It's put together by stewing meat (usually lamb, but beef or chicken can be used) with a blend of Libyan spices called Bzaar (like Bazaar without pronouncing the first \"a\"), which has a warming and earthy flavor composition. Once the meat is cooked through, pasta is added to the stew, where it absorbs the liquid and gets infused with the flavors of the dish. The end product is a pasta dish that's packed full of flavor, contains perfectly cooked chunks of meat, and a delicious thickened broth. \n\nThe Bzaar spice mix is what makes this dish so unique and delicious, and it's something you can only get premixed in Libya. Just like you have fish mongers, butchers and green grocers, many regions around the world including the Middle East also have [spice shops](https://traveltoeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wpid-Photo-20140731133707.jpg). These spice shops will sell literally hundreds of unique spices and herbal remedies (used for traditional medicine) which they source from every corner of the world. It's also at these spice shops, where they grind and mill whole spices into unique blends that are used in locally cooked dishes. Bzaar itself is a blend of 10+ spices that is uniquely Libyan, but luckily a Libyan friend of mine has a recipe for a homemade Bzaar spice mix, that you can make with store bought spices. Each country can have dozens of unique spice mixes, but because there is no steadfast rules or written recipes on these mixes, every state, city or shop can have differences that make no two blends taste the same. Bzaar is definitely like that, the recipe I have is closer to an Amazigh ([Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers)) recipe, but I learnt that in western Libya they also add ground cinnamon for some extra warmth. To make the Bzaar I first assemble a Middle Eastern 7 spice which combines Pepper, Cumin, Ginger, Cloves, Coriander, Cardamom and Nutmeg. This 7 spice is a versatile spice mix that can be used to season any proteins or vegetables with a Middle Eastern flavor profile. Then I add Turmeric and Caraway to the 7 spice to put together the Bzaar, apart from that there is still paprika and cayenne pepper that goes into the stew.\n\nI opted to use lamb leg cubes for this dish which included pieces of the bone. You can forego the bones and use a softer cut of meat here, however the longer you braise this the more the flavor will develop and so opting to use a slower cooking cut is a great idea. To present it nicely, opt for larger chunks of meat, or get hold of some lamb shanks. You can also make this with beef or chicken, and from what I've read from some Libyan commentors, the chicken one is a great quick alternative and I think the flavors would work really well with it. In terms of pasta, you want to use small elbows or small tube shaped pasta, failing that you can use Penne or a form of Mezzi Rigatoni.\n\n## Cultural context\nLike I mentioned above, Libya has long been a crossroads of civilisations. The exact origins of Mbakbaka are not known however the Bzaar spice mix is thought to have an Amazigh origin. In fact many of the Amazigh foods use Bzaar or similar spice mixes to flavor the dishes. Another important spice mix in Libya is called Hararat and this is a blend of \"hot\" spices, it combines Cinnamon, Cumin, Coriander, Chilli and All spice. Many Libyan dishes are flavored with both Bzaar and Harart such as [Mbatan](https://blog.arousingappetites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_8199.jpg), a potato wedge that is stuffed with a spiced meat mixture (I'll have a recipe for this coming soon). \n\nIn 1911 Libya was invaded by Italy in a war that resulted in the creation of Italian Libya which lasted until 1943 when it was invaded by British and French forces. During this period over 100,000 Italians emigrated to Libya where they made up over 12% of the population. In the 1970s when the Libyan Monarchy was overthrown the remaining Libyan Italians were expelled from the country and only a few hundred remained into the 2000s. Given the significant size of their population and how long they stayed, it is no suprise that some elements of Italian cuisine were Libyan-ised. One of the interesting cultural overlaps is that some Berber tribes were allied with the Italian invasion against the Ottomans, it is thought that Mbakbaka may have come about when Italian and Berber soldiers shared a meal. \n\n## Flavor profile\nThe flavors of this dish definitely fall into the Warm and Earthy category with a pleasing profile that even the fussiest of eaters would enjoy. I would say that this pasta tastes similar to a Jamaican Lamb patty and that's probably due to the large amount of Turmeric in it. While Turmeric can become an overwhelming flavor, it is well balanced with the Caraway and other spices. It's hard to distinguish all the individual spices once they are mixed together, but the flavor of the Bzaar mix can only be described as earthy and warming. The Hot Paprika, adds just the slightest amount of back of the throat heat, and a deep complex Umami Flavor. The other flavors in this dish come from the meat, if you opt for Lamb, you will get the slight gaminess of it in the pasta which I think works really well. If you opt for Beef or Chicken, I suspect that their flavor won't really be obvious.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### 7 Spice Mix: \n(makes 1 Tsp)\n* 1/4 Tsp Black Pepper\n* 1/4 Tsp Ground Cumin\n* 1/8 Tsp Ground Ginger\n* 1/8 Tsp Ground Cloves\n* 1/8 Tsp Ground Coriander\n* 1/16 Tsp Ground Cardamom\n* 1/16 Tsp Ground Nutmeg\n\n### Bzaar Spice Mix: \n(makes 3 Tsp)\n* 1 1/4 Tsp Turmeric \n* 3/4 Tsp Caraway Seeds \n* 1/2 Tsp Coriander \n* 1/2 Tsp 7 Spice \n\n### Mbakbaka: \n(4-5 servings)\n* 1 Kg (2lbs) Lamb Cubes or Beef\n* 500g (1lb) Pasta elbows or small tubes\n* 2 Medium Onions\n* 2-3 Cloves of Garlic\n* 2-3 Green Chillies\n* 1/4 Cup Vegetable Oil\n* 4 Tbsp Tomato Paste\n* 2.5 Tsp Salt\n* 2 Tsp Bzaar mix, you can also add the third if you want\n* 1.5 Tsp Hot Paprika or 1 Tsp Paprika and 1/2 Tsp Cayenne Pepper\n* 500ml (17fl oz) Lamb or Beef stock\n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the Bzaar:\n1. Mix the 7 spice ingredients together into a fine and well mixed powder (you will have twice as much as needed)\n2. Crush your caraway in a mortar and pestle\n3. Add the ingredients for the Bzaar, as well as the freshly ground caraway and 1/2 Tsp of the 7 spice\n\n### To make the Mbakbaka:\n1. Dice your onion into a medium dice, mince your garlic, and slice your meat into large chunks\n2. Add the vegetable oil to a pot on high heat and once heated add half of your meat pieces to the oil\n3. Allow them to sear for 3-4 minutes until they have developed a brown crust, then turn over and sear the other side for 3-4 more minutes\n4. Once seared all over remove the meat and set aside, sear the remaining meat the same way\n5. When all the meat has been seared, turn the heat down to medium and add the onion. Saute for 2 minutes then add your minced garlic in\n6. Saute for 5-7 minutes until the onions have softened and any fond in the bottom of the pot has been deglazed\n7. Add the meat back to the pot as well as any drained liquid, or vegetables you'd like to incorporate\n8. Add the Tomato paste, Salt, Paprika and Bzaar to the pot and add enough stock or water to the pot to cover the meat. Bring to a boil then turn the heat down to medium and cook covered for about 45 minutes or until your meat is cooked through and tender\n9. When the meat is ready, add your pasta to the pot (you do not precook it, it goes into the pot straight fromt the packet). I'd recommend removing any bones before doing this\n10. Add enough (HOT) water or stock to the pot to just cover the pasta and bring the pot to a boil once more\n11. Allow the pot to boil until the pasta is cooked through and the sauce has reduced a little. You should stir it every minute or so to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottomg of the pot\n12. Serve immediately and enjoy\n\n## Notes and tips\n* If you add cold water to the pot with your pasta, it will cause the pasta to stick to the bottom. Your water must be hot\n* You should serve this at a saucey consistency, if it reduces too much just add more hot water and thin it out once more\n* Test your meats doneness before adding the pasta. If it isn't fall off the bone soft then just wait a little longer\n* To use up your remaining Bzaar or 7 spice, try rubbing it onto some chicken thighs or wings before cooking them in the oven", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/k591os/if_youve_never_had_libyan_food_before_id_highly/", "created_utc": 1606915090.0, "score": 5073, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 405, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/k591os/if_youve_never_had_libyan_food_before_id_highly/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "For centuries Middle Easterners have been drinking Sahlab in the Winter. It's a sweet thickened hot drink, that can be flavoured with Coconut, Orange Blossom, or Rose and it's popularity almost caused the extinction of a key ingredient. Recipe for delicious instant Sahlab inside (sans extinction)", "selftext": "If you've visited the Middle East or it's surrounding countries in Winter, you've probably seen people drinking something that looks like a mug of hot milk. What they had in their hands was Sahlab, a thick and sweet hot drink that is loved for its taste and great warming abilities. It's an old drink that was consumed as far back as Ancient Rome, Industrial Britain and all over the ottoman empire, but now has sadly been forgotten to the world except in the Middle East (and a few select countries). Today I'll show you how to make [instant Sahlab powder flavoured with coconut and how to use it](https://imgur.com/a/sqM5Dra), and I'll also tell you how you can make the other varieties as well. \n\nIf you prefer video recipes with all the visual cues, or you'd like to support my work, check out the [full video recipe on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TOAf1ofMQ)\n\n## What is Sahlab or Salep\nIn it's traditional form, Sahlab or Salep is a drink made from crushed orchid tubers. While we think of Orchids as house plants, there are over 20000 different species of orchids, and a large number of them grow [small starchy tubers](https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p04hnc1h.jpg) below the ground. These tubers have a distinctive flavour, which can be described as similar to Taro or a sweet earthy flavour, and they contain an important ingredient for the making of this drink, Glucomannan. Glucomannan is a naturally occurring thickener, and similar to corn starch or konjac it's able to turn a cup of milk into a thick runny liquid. Unfortunately real Salep got so popular that many species of wild orchids were harvested to near extinction in Turkey. As a result the Turkish government has placed bans on the export of Salep powder, and there are only a few producers of sustainable farmed Salep in Greece. The good news is that most drinkers of Salep aren't actually drinking Salep at all. In nearly all countries including Turkey most salep powders are made using a combination of corn starch and other thickeners and flavourings.\n\nInstead of traditional Salep, this recipe makes the variety of sahlab that you'd find in Egypt where it's flavoured with coconut and sesame. The result is a drink that tastes similar to coconut macaroons or coconut cake. Usually the drink is [topped with nuts, sultanas and desiccated coconut](https://imgur.com/R0CLjvq) before serving, which makes for a pleasant drink that you can also chew on. Because of it's thick texture it retains heat really well, and as you drink it you can feel the warm liquid trickling down your throat which is a strangely comforting feeling especially during a cold dessert winter. In some Levantine countries, sahlab is instead flavoured with orange blossom or rose water which results in a bright floral flavour profile. \n\nMost people buy the sahlab mixture premixed from spice vendors or from the supermarket (it's available on amazon US and UK) and it's a simple matter of heating it with some milk to make a warm mug of sahlab. Unfortunately I have found that nearly all premixed sahlab just tastes flat so I experimented until I came up with this recipe. The key ingredient here is Coconut Milk Powder and it's an ingredient that is used in a number of South Asian and Caribbean cuisines, it's essentially dehydrated coconut milk and it gives a strong coconut flavour to the drink. Most recipes I found called for desiccated coconut instead, but I found it resulted in a gritty texture and it had less coconut flavour. Apart from the coconut milk powder, I've also included rice flour in this recipe as it gives the drink a distinct starchy flavour that is present in actual Salep. All the ingredients for the Sahlab are sifted together and the resulting mixture will keep for up to a year in an air tight container. To make a cup of sahlab, you simply heat a cup of milk with a 1/4 cup of the sahlab powder until it thickens, then you garnish it with your desired toppings.\n\n## Cultural Context\n\nLike I mentioned salep is an extremely popular drink and it has been that way for centuries having been drunk by the Ancient romans and later by the Ottomans. Apart from the texture and flavour, Salep was thought to be an Aphrodisiac, so much so that the Ancient Romans called it Satyrion and Priapiscus (I'll leave you to google those). Looking at [how the orchid tubers grow](https://pfaf.org/Admin/PlantImages/OrchisMorio.jpg), you can understand why someone might draw such a conclusion. In fact some theories say that the word Salep comes from the Arabic word Thaalab (\u062b\u0639\u0644\u0628) which means fox, for the resemblance the tubers bear to a foxes anatomy. Last summer I made stretchy ice cream using some Greek Salep powder and it turned out delicious, you can (check out the recipe here)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/i45hy4/every_week_i_cook_a_new_middle_eastern_recipe/]\n\nSalep even made it's way over to [industrial Britain](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/01a6bd_58782d7019d04b7887b568120a74bb0d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_758,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/01a6bd_58782d7019d04b7887b568120a74bb0d~mv2.jpg) where it was sold under the name Saloop. [Carts all over the city](https://janeaustensworld.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/womansellingsalop.jpg) would sell Salep made using milk or water and using the flour of local marsh orchids. Legend has it that the popularity of saloop declined after its association with venereal disease, and the carts were soon replaced with ones selling coffee and tea instead.\n\nIn the modern Middle East, Sahlab is drunk much the same as Hot chocolate is in the west. It's a sweet treat that you can get at a cafe to warm yourself up, or made at home for when you want to chill out on the sofa. Some people make the mixture extra thick so it can be eaten with a spoon and others chill it and eat it cold as well.\n\n## Flavour Profile\nThe main flavouring of this Sahlab recipe is Coconut, this drink tastes similar to coconut macaroons, bounty chocolates or coconut cake without being too coconutty. You also get a lot of nice flavour from the toasted sesame which gives the drink a slight nutty flavour. The mastic acts as a background flavour, and it gives the drink a light pine aroma, but you likely won't notice if you leave it out. Likewise with the vanilla it's also a background flavour, it just makes the drink taste a bit more rounded and if you leave it out it won't be too impacted. The rice flour gives the drink a starchy flavour similar to horchata and without it, it just doesn't taste the same. Finally the Milk powder gives the Sahlab a slight malted flavour, and a creamier texture.\n\nIf you choose to make the Levantine Sahlab instead, you'll have a bright floral flavour profile.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Egyptian Coconut Sahlab (Makes about 10 measuring cups worth or about 5-6 mugs)\n* 1 Cup Coconut Milk Powder\n* 1/2 Cup Milk Powder (can also be replaced with coconut milk powder for a stronger flavour)\n* 1/2 Cup Rice flour\n* 1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar\n* 3 Tbsp Sesame (1 extra tbsp for topping)\n* 3 Tbsp Corn Starch\n* 1/2 Tsp Vanilla Powder (Vanillin)\n* 1/2 Tsp Mastic\n\n### Levantine Sahlab\n* Replace the coconut milk powder with regular milk powder\n* You can leave out the sesame if you want, it's not always used here\n* Per cup on the stove you'd need to add between 1/2 - 1 Tsp of Orange Blossom or Rose Water\n\n### Possible Toppings\n* Chopped nuts (Pistachio, Almond, Hazelnut)\n* Desiccated coconut\n* Toasted Sesame\n* Sultanas\n* Ground Cinnamon or Cardamom\n\n### Per measuring cup of Hot Sahlab drink\n* 1 Cup (237 ml) of milk\n* 1/4 Cup of Sahlab powder \n\n## Directions\n\n### To toast the sesame\n1. Place the Sesame in a dry pan over medium heat\n2. Shake the pan every 15-30 seconds making sure to rotate your sesame seeds from the bottom to the top of the pan\n3. Toast the sesame until a light golden color, then immediately remove from the pan. They will continue to brown after removal\n\n### To make the Sahlab Powder\n1. Crush the mastic in a pestle and mortar into an extremely fine powder\n2. Sift together all of the ingredients apart from the Sesame seeds. If you don't sift it, the mix will be clumpy and won't evenly combine.\n4. Add the sesame seeds and mix everything together very thoroughly\n5. Store in an air tight container for up to a year\n\n### To make the hot sahlab\n1. Measure your mug of choice in US measuring cups, and multiply the ingredient amounts by the result\n2. Add the milk and Sahlab powder to a pot on medium heat\n3. Whisk together until the mixture thickens (about 5-10 minutes)\n4. Pour out the sahlab into your mug and let it cool for a couple of minutes before topping with any desired toppings\n\n## Tips and tricks\n* Preheat your milk in the microwave to just below boiling to speed up the cooking process, but be careful not to let it boil\n* If you want to make this vegan, you can replace the milk powder with more coconut milk powder and use any replacement milk when cooking\n* You can put some toppings in the base of the mug as well as on top, this makes it easier to decorate while still getting a good amount of toppings\n* If you can't find coconut milk powder, you can use dessicated coconut instead.

{"title": "I tried the \"two ingredient brownie hack\" (banana + cocoa powder) and I have some thoughts.", "selftext": "Somewhere on reddit, I read a claim that you could make \"brownies\" out of nothing but mashed banana and cocoa powder. I filed this away under \"psh yeah right\" until today, when I wanted a dessert, but also didn't want to really bake anything or leave the house. \n\nI went loosely off of [this blog recipe](https://kirbiecravings.com/2-ingredient-healthy-brownies/), but bananas + cocoa powder isn't really rocket science. I used a hand mixer to get the bananas extra liquid and added a pinch of kosher salt because it felt wrong not to. When I tasted the batter, it was way too bitter for me (not really sure what I expected) so I figured one heaping tsp of white sugar spread over three brownies wasn't THAT unhealthy. For reference: I like dark chocolate up to 85%. \n\nMy two small bananas and 3 tbsp cocoa powder made enough batter-like substance for three 'brownies' in a muffin tin. Into the oven for 20 mins at 350, then 30 mins to cool and \"set\" (because without flour or leavener, these don't \"bake.\")\n\n**Test 1: Did they look like brownies?** Absolutely. Good brownies, too. 10/10 visuals, although, this did come around to bite them in the final judging because they looked *too* good. \n\n**Test 2: Did they have the texture of brownies?** Surprisingly, yeah. A nice fudgy texture, soft and rich, like flourless cake. The texture was a high point. \n\n**Test 3a: Did they taste like brownies?** No. As you can imagine, butter and sugar are two important flavor components that can't be replaced by bananas and prayer. \n\n**Test 3b: Did they taste** ***good?*** Surprisingly.... yeah, they were better than I expected. I like bananas, especially in baked goods, and the tiny amount of sugar balanced the chocolate so it was in my acceptable bitterness range. If I had never had brownies in my life, these would be fantastic. Unfortunately, I made a real batch of brownies a week ago, and so the extra-bitter-banana-fudge version suffered by comparison.\n\nThat said, if you're on a diet, you can certainly do worse! They were easy to make, looked like brownies, and were surprisingly edible. Solid B minus. Might even add them to the breakfast rotation down the line. \n\n**tl;dr:** Extra bitter with prominent banana notes. Texture was on point, looked and felt surprisingly like brownies.

It's the savoury cousin of Baklava that is filled with Meat or Spinach, and is one of the crispiest foods in existence. Full Recipe inside", "selftext": "Baklava is definitely the most popular dessert in the Middle East, with dozens of different shapes, sizes and fillings of baklava, it begs the question - has anyone made a \"savoury Baklava\"? The answer to that is Yes, there are many varieties of \"savoury baklava\" that are served throughout the Middle East and Balkan region. You may know this as B\u00f6rek (Burek, Brek) or Spanakopita, but in Egypt and parts of the Middle East [we call it Goulash](https://imgur.com/a/cmiYsrG); layers upon layers of crispy Phyllo (Filo) pastry surrounding a filling made of lightly spiced ground beef. More than being a recipe, Goulash or Borek is a cooking technique that can be applied to any filling you can think of. The result is an extremely crispy pastry filled with a delicious savoury centre.\n\nIf you want to see how I assemble the Goulash, check out the [full recipe video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS-ps3IQKnQ)\n\n## What is Goulash (\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0634 \u0623\u0648 \u0643\u0644\u0627\u062c)\nGoulash in the traditional sense of the word refers to a baked Phyllo pastry that is filled with a savoury stuffing. This pastry usually has 16+ layers of phyllo dough, which itself is divided into a top and bottom layer that sandwich the filling. For those of you unfamiliar with Phyllo (Filo), it is an ultra thin pastry sheet (we're talking thinner than paper) that when baked turns extremely crispy. On it's own Phyllo is completely tasteless, and baking a single sheet will not produce a memorable meal. However, when you layer multiple sheets on top of each other and utilise a sweet or savoury filling, the phyllo completely transforms into the perfect vehicle for serving the filling. The most common kind of Goulash that is served in the Middle East is a tray baked goulash that is stuffed with minced beef and onion. This is usually served as a side dish at dinner parties and is a common fixture during the month of Ramadan.\n\nThere are many kinds of savoury phyllo pastries that exist in the region, and one you've probably seen before is [Greek Strifti](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4ad79f406195ce2d0ea5ca40d7c4f3447739cc8a/2b20f/images/uploads/2019_07_11_vegan_spanakopita_2.jpg) or [Turkish Kol boregi](https://i12.haber7.net//haber/haber7/photos/2020/37/pratik_kol_boregi_nasil_yapilir_evde_kol_boregi_tarifi_1599550972_9447.jpg). These are shaped like a spiral and are made by rolling a long sheet of phyllo around the filling before coiling and baking it. Another common kind is [Sigara Boregi](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/KO8YhkDU1VNL1bkqk8zYPH3jd-ExLdsr93mEl-M4JLHzqhNV9iDY-N9vpCB093lAMSc-aNnJSzywtn5sMBIUJh9B8krAoxyJ1ZM0wgwVynF8TFDPz8Fbrh_aWkErfg)(cigarette borek) or [Asabe Goulash](https://www.origanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gola-1024x1024.jpg)(finger Goulash), these range in size and thickness from the size of a pinkie finger to a spring roll, and contain a wide array of fillings. Probably the most common kind of Phyllo pastry in the Middle East is [Sambousek](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/596f2f57d482e9ec36aa37e7/1557425965693-ZOSSV1GTI5EQUSOXV4A0/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kANy-8JwMkLmIeOUz4nVKkp7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UV_CumqpZqajpS1mdJHFXn0uVc9y6k_v0xei2HU8kVJYMi70pnEfxpOXPILmDs2faQ/LS_sambusek_1.jpg), however calling it a phyllo pastry is a bit of a misnomer. Depending upon the household, Sambousek can either be made with Phyllo Pastry, Spring Roll pastry, or a beautiful bubbly dough [(Check out my recipe here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlALczzeEA).\n\nLike the shape, there is also a large variation in the fillings and anything you can think of can be used in a Goulash. The most common filling in the Middle East is a minced meat and onion filling, this is lightly spiced with salt, pepper and whatever the local spice blend is. Sometimes pine nuts are added to the meat filling, however in a tray of goulash, it's usually kept to just the beef and onion. Another common filling is cooked spinach, this features very heavily in the Greek and Turkish varieties where it's usually accompanied by Feta Cheese. One filling I really enjoy is a tangy spinach filling, that is made with Sumac and Pomegranate molasses and contrasts well with the heaviness you can get from all the butter in the dish. The only restriction on the filling is that it can't contain too much liquid, as moisture can impede the cooking of the phyllo. In theory you could make a cheeseburger or chicken tandoori goulash, for the ultimate crispy snack. \n\nMaking goulash is pretty much an identical process to making a tray of Baklava, except some extra steps are taken towards the end to keep the savoury filling in place. It starts by coating a baking dish in a layer of clarified butter or oil, then laying in a single layer of phyllo pastry. That layer is then liberally coated in another layer of butter or oil, before a second layer of phyllo is added on top of it. This process called lamination is repeated over and over again until a sufficiently thick pastry base has been formed (I'd recommend a minimum of 8 layers). By laminating the pastry we are accomplishing two things; firstly we're creating a barrier between each layer that will prevent it from sticking to the ones above and below it, and secondly we are introducing fat which will crisp up the phyllo but also help it rise. Now it's important to note that clarified butter or ghee is nearly always used when making Goulash, and that's because it has had the milk solids removed and prevents the phyllo from burning. If you try to make this with regular butter you'll find it harder to work with and more susceptible to burning.\n\nOnce the base has been assembled, a pre cooked filling is added to the baking dish and distributed evenly over the pastry. This should be laid to a depth of about 1 - 1.5cm (3/8 - 5/8in) deep. When filled, a layer of phyllo is placed on top of the filling and the lamination process begins again. This time around you want to use more sheets than in the base, and the more layers you add, the higher the phyllo will rise in the oven (I find a 40:60 split works well). Before adding the last layer, it's best to trim off any excess phyllo from the dish to ensure you get a nice clean top. Once assembled the goulash has to be cut into individual servings as it's too delicate to cut when cooked, and unlike the traditional diamonds of Baklava, this is usually cut into large squares. Prior to baking the last step is to coat the entire goulash in an egg wash. Rather than serve to give the goulash a nice exterior colour, this egg wash seeps down into the filling and functions as a glue to bind the filling and phyllo layers together. The goulash is then baked until the top layers of phyllo turn completely golden brown, before being removed and allowed to cool before serving. If done right, the phyllo layers will have puffed up on the top, and the filling will be suspended in place between the top and bottom layers of pastry.\n\nIf you've worked with Phyllo pastry before then you'll know it requires patience and time to assemble this goulash. One shortcut my family does when short on time, is to use pre-rolled puff pastry sheets in place of the phyllo. Although this is definitely not an authentic version, a lot of our dinner guests have thoroughly enjoyed it and gone on to make it themselves. It's a huge time saver, because rather than laying individual sheets and laminating them, you can just place a pre rolled sheet in the dish then top it with the filling. This can either be made exactly like the Phyllo version with a top and bottom layer, or you can add a third middle layer of pastry. One draw back of doing this is that the Puff pastry will not crisp up as well as the phyllo, you sacrifice texture for time when using puff pastry. Another draw back is that the puff pastry layers in the middle and bottom will not fully expand and can have a soft squishy texture. I personally find that texture to be quite enjoyable, but to avoid it, you can roll out a single sheet of puff pastry into 2 thin layers to replace them.   \n\n## Cultural Context\nIt's not definitively known which came first, the Baklava or the Borek, however it's almost certain that it originated in either the Ottoman or Byzantine Empire. A number of sources have suggested the food is of nomadic Turkic origin, but what we do know is that this food spread far and wide in the Ottoman empire. The same Borek that's made in Bosnia and Croatia can be found in Egypt and Jordan. As the borek made its way across the Caucasus and central Asia, the fillings changed to reflect the tastes of the local cuisine, foods such as anchovies or local cheeses made their way into it. The Borek then made their way to Mongol ruled China where the recipe was recorded in a 14th century dietary book called Yinshan Zhengyao (\u98ee\u81b3\u6b63\u8981, Important Principles of Food and Drink). Borek became a huge part of Ottoman cuisine, where it was often served at court feasts and enjoyed by the regular public alike. At one point it is said there were 4 times more Borek shops in Istanbul than bakeries. [More History here](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/history-borek)  \n\nTraditionally most boreks are made with a pastry dough called yufka (similar but not identical to phyllo), however it seems that most recipes interchange yufka for filo pastry based on availability.  The use of fresh phyllo dough is important when making borek as filo can easily tear or break if it dries out. In most bakeries that make Borek, they either make the Phyllo themselves or purchase it fresh everyday from a phyllo maker. \n\nWhat's interesting about the naming of Goulash (or G\u00fclla\u00e7), is that it's also the [name of a dessert](https://www.giverecipe.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/gullac11.jpg) in some parts of the Middle East and Turkey. In Egypt, this dessert is made by soaking phyllo sheets in sweetened milk, whereas in Turkey a [thin pastry](https://turkishstylecooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gullac_yapragi3.jpg) made from flour and cornstarch is used instead.\n\n## Flavour Profile\nWith goulash, the flavour you taste will directly depend upon the filling you add to it. The classic ground meat and onion filling is usually lightly spiced and seasoned to get that classic browned beef flavour, I think it goes great with the Goulash and it's a good introduction to the versatility of this dish. However if you fill the goulash with spinach or cheese, those are what you would taste instead. One thing you may notice about goulash, is the buttery flavour you get from the laminated pastry sheets. It's more of a background flavour and the stronger your filling tastes, the less you'll notice it.\n\nRather than the flavour being important here, it's the crispy texture of the goulash that matters. You'll have three distinct layers in your goulash and should be able to feel each one as you bite into it. The bottom and top layer are both extremely crispy and firm, the texture you get from them is similar to that of potato chips but a lot more delicate and multi layered. Then you have the filling, which usually is quite soft, but depending on what you use, might have some chewiness. The contrasts between the crispy outer layers and the soft filling is what makes borek or goulash so great.\n\n## Ingredients\nThe following amounts are suitable for a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) baking dish.\n\n### Phyllo Goulash:  \n* 500g (1lb) Phyllo (Filo) pastry  \n* 250g (1/2 lb) Butter  \n\n### For Puff Pastry Goulash: \n* Half the ingredients for the beef filling  \n* 2 300g (10.5 oz) packets of pre-rolled puff pastry  \n\n### Beef filling:  \n* 1kg (2 lbs) Beef Mince  \n* 2 Medium Brown (Spanish) onions   \n* 3 Garlic cloves  \n* 2 Tbsp Olive Oil  \n* 2 Tsp Salt  \n* 1/2 Tsp Pepper  \n* 1/2 Tsp Bharat or Middle Eastern 7 spice (Optional) substitute with your favourite spice blend  \n\n### Egg wash:\n* 150ml (2/3c) whole milk  \n* 1 Large Egg or 2 Small Eggs   \n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the Beef Filling:  \n1. Dice the onions into small cubes and mince your garlic  \n2. Add Olive oil to a pan on medium-high heat and add the onions, Saute for 2-3 minutes  \n3. Once the onions have softened a little add the garlic and saute for 5 minutes until the onions turn opaque, if you would like to add some other vegetables, then add them in with the garlic  \n4. Once soft and opaque, add the Salt, Pepper & any other seasonings you would like to the onions, stir, then push to one side of the pan  \n5. Add the Minced beef to the pan and press in firmly, allow it to brown on that side for 5 minutes  \n6. Break the meat into smaller sections and flip over, allow it to fry for a few more minutes before breaking it up into tiny pieces with your spatula    \n7. Mix the onions into the meat and cook until a deep brown colour, remove and set aside    \n\n### How to clarify butter:\n1. Place your 250g stick of butter in a pot to melt on high heat until completely liquified  \n2. Allow it to come to a boil and it will foam up. Once it has boiled for a few minutes the foam will evaporate  \n3. Your clarified butter is done cooking when you can see the bottom of the pot through the golden melted butter, pour out into a jug to cool  \nNote: Make sure not to pour out any of the cooked milk solids into the jug. You will likely not use all of the clarified butter in this recipe, don't feel you have to  \n\n### How to assemble the Phyllo:\n1. Prepare a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) deep baking dish by brushing the base and walls with clarified butter  \n2. Lay your first phyllo sheet in the dish allowing any excess to run up the walls of the dish. (You may need to slice your phyllo sheets in half to fit in the dish)  \n3. Using a pastry brush, coat the sheet of phyllo from corner to corner with a thin layer of clarified butter. (You must coat all the surface including any excess pastry)  \n4. Place another Phyllo sheet on top, and press out any air bubbles. Allow it to adhere to the sheet below it. Coat it in butter once more and repeat this process until you have a minimum of 8 layers of phyllo  \n5. Using a sharp knife, trim off any excess phyllo that is running up the walls of the dish  \n6. Brush your topmost layer of phyllo with butter, then pour on your meat filling. Spread it out into one even layer from edge to edge  \n7. Place a sheet of Phyllo on top of the filling and then repeat the layering/laminating process with a minimum of 8 layers of Phyllo  \n8. When adding your last layer of Phyllo, trim any excess off the walls before placing it, then brush the top surface with butter  \n9. Using a sharp knife slice your pastry into equal sized portions, use a ruler to get accurate edges  \n10. Whisk together your milk and egg into an egg wash and then pour it evenly over the Goulash  \n11. Bake in a 180c or 350f oven for 40 minutes, rotating at the halfway point. Remove when it is Golden Brown all over and bubbling  \n12. Allow to cool for a minimum of half an hour before serving. If there is a lot of butter bubbling in the dish when it comes out of the oven DO NOT pour it out, that will cool and redistribute back into the goulash. Removing it will ruin the dish  \n\n### How to assemble the Puff Pastry Version:\n1. Prepare a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) deep baking dish by brushing the base and walls with clarified butter  \n2. Roll out one sheet of puff pastry to twice the size of your baking dish then cut in half. These will become your bottom and middle layer of pastry  \n3. Add a layer of the rolled puff pastry to the bottom of the dish and trim off any excess  \n4. Add half of your filling on top of the pastry in an even manner  \n5. Lay the second rolled layer of puff pastry on top  \n6. Add the remaining fill on top of this layer of puff pastry  \n7. Add a full sheet of puff pastry on top, then slice into equal sized portions  \n8. Whisk together your milk and egg into an egg wash and then pour it evenly over the Goulash  \n9. Bake for 40-50 minutes until the top layer puffs up well  \n10. Allow to cool for 20 minutes before eating  \n\nWhen making the puff pastry version, you only need to do about half to two thirds of the filling amount. You will also need 2 300g (10.5 oz) pre-rolled puff pastry sheets.  \nNote: The bottom two layers will not puff up, due to the weight of the layers above them and the egg wash holding everything in place.  \n\n## Ingredients\nThe following amounts are suitable for a 9 X 12 inch (22 X 30 cm) baking dish.\n\n### Phyllo Goulash:  \n* 500g (1lb) Phyllo (Filo) pastry  \n* 250g (1/2 lb) Butter  \n\n### For Puff Pastry Goulash: \n* Half the ingredients for the beef filling  \n* 2 300g (10.5 oz) packets of pre-rolled puff pastry  \n\n### Beef filling:  \n* 1kg (2 lbs) Beef Mince  \n* 2 Medium Brown (Spanish) onions   \n* 3 Garlic cloves  \n* 2 Tbsp Olive Oil  \n* 2 Tsp Salt  \n* 1/2 Tsp Pepper  \n* 1/2 Tsp Bharat or Middle Eastern 7 spice (Optional) substitute with your favourite spice blend  \n\n### Egg wash:\n* 150ml (2/3c) whole milk  \n* 1 Large Egg or 2 Small Eggs   \n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the Beef Filling:  \n1.

{"title": "My thoughts after one week switching from margarine to butter", "selftext": "I made a thread about a week and a half ago, commenting that I did not understand why people hate margarine so much, I grew up with margarine mainly, and had unsalted butter I baked with, and found the unsalted butter essentially tasteless and the margarine not bad at all. They told me to go the store and get good salted butter if I wanted to understand.\n\nThe difference is ridiculous. At first it didn't seem as jarring, because the taste of butter is much more subtle than margarine and therefore did not seem to be a huge improvement at first. After 1.5 weeks of cooking, making toast, and tasting the difference, there is no way I could possibly go back. The butter tastes subtly creamy, milky, salty, and gets tastier the more I let it sit on my tongue. The eggs and toast are blatantly better tasting now, the first scrambled eggs I made with the new butter are probably the best tasting batch I ever made and they didn't even come out that well. \n\nThe margarine, on the other hand, now tastes blatantly wrong, it has a super in-your-face artificial fatty taste with no depth at all, the aftertaste is gross, everything about it just seems totally wrong. It gives me a visceral reaction now even though I was completely okay with it for decades.

Of course, all of these books are products of their time, and some contain images and stereotypes that would be too offensive to publish today.  But if you can get past the stuff that's better left behind, and look for the content that's worth bringing into this century, there's some great stuff here.\n\nA few of these books are available to download and keep as .pdf files, but most you can only borrow.  The loan period is usually one hour, but you can renew it as soon as your time runs out.  There's no charge for any of this--you just need to register for an Internet Archive account.\n\nThe books were all scanned and saved as image files--meaning that you can't just copy and paste a recipe as editable text.  You can take a screen shot of a recipe and save that, but you won't be able to edit or add to the text, and I like to have that option.  I've found a method that's getting me there, with a few extra steps:  I take a screen shot of the recipe I want, save it as a .pdf, then open it in Acrobat Pro and use the built-in OCR function to convert the image to editable text.  Depending on the font and the quality of the scan, some recipes need some cleanup, but that's still faster and more accurate than transcribing the whole recipe by hand.  I think you can do the same thing with Microsoft OneNote, but I haven't tried it.  And just to be clear:  I'm copying and converting these recipes strictly for my own use.  I'm not planning on re-publishing or selling them, or claiming them as my own creations, or suggesting that anyone else should!\n\nAnyhow, enjoy...and if you go down this rabbit hole and don't come out for weeks, at least you'll have no shortage of ideas for snacks to make while you're down there!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jpgnth/til_theres_an_online_archive_of_over_10000/", "created_utc": 1604707795.0, "score": 4485, "author": "casagordita", "num_comments": 152, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jpgnth/til_theres_an_online_archive_of_over_10000/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Sometimes I just get really annoyed with diet culture and people completely cutting fat and salt from food", "selftext": "I need a little rant here, and before I start, I know some diets are doctor prescribed type things or people need to cut down on these things because of medical issues, etc. I feel like I'm in the wrong for being annoyed here, it's everyone's own choice to season how they want but seriously even a dash of salt is gonna make that dish that much better and it's not like the amount of salt you use for seasoning has a significant amount of calories. Simply putting salt in a dish isn't gonna make it salty, it's a flavour enhancer. Wish diet culture didn't target the meaningless things like this lol\n\nEdit: for clarification, the situation was that I was cooking for my family and one of them came and said I shouldn't put salt in the food. Just like I wouldn't come over to someone's place and expect them to cook a certain way, I expect the same courteousy when I'm cooking as well (except when it's for a medical reason ofc)\n\nEdit Edit: **I specifically mention in this post there are legitimate reasons to reduce/cut out salt and to repeat: I am not talking about cases like these.** This was some stupid rant about an experience particular to my situation and y'all need to listen to your doctors n nutritionists about whether your salt intake is the right amount for your situation. Lots of studies specifically talk about reducing salt because most of us over consume salt. But I think many of us can agree, diet culture takes shit and runs waaay way too far with it, so there literally are people who try to completely cut salt (who do not need to and have done so without consulting doctors etc) because some blog said it'll help you lose weight! Cutting out salt on the basis of dieting is misinformed and we should be critical of what diet culture tells us (and especially critical of the studies they use since sometimes those are funded by companies that'll benefit from the results/have already been debunked in other studies). **Finally, if you don't want salt in your food for any reason at all (health related or not), no problem--the fun thing about cooking is you can make it to your tastes. This post isn't a anti-salt hate post, but more a rant about my annoyance with people who just don't use salt because some blog said not to.**\n\nIf you're curious about what I'm meaning by diet culture: [here's an article that takes salt reduction too far](https://www.thelist.com/164105/when-you-stop-eating-salt-this-is-what-really-happens-to-your-body/). There's plenty more like this, but the subheadlines specifically state \"when you stop eating salt\" which is *not* the intent of the results from the study they cite as their evidence. True that salt reduction can have positive effects (if you're getting too much sodium) but [there are also dangers for not eating enough salt](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-dangers-of-sodium-restriction) which these clickbait-y articles also fail to recognize. We should be eating salt (as many of you said) [in moderation and according to how much our body needs](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/take-it-with-a-grain-of-salt)\n\nFinal Edit: I am seeing a lot of diet shaming which also seems to be very connected to women and dieting. Hating on women (or anybody for that matter) for simply dieting isn't okay. People diet for a variety of reasons... dieting itself isn't inherently evil. The issue is when dieting's taken to the extreme and founded in misinformation, etc. It's not inherently a women's issue and even when women are the victims of diet culture, that's not an excuse to shame them but more a reason to reevaluate what in society makes people feel like they have to go to such extremes to feel good about their body. \n\nEdit: haha thanks for the gold stranger! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/mxmbx7/sometimes_i_just_get_really_annoyed_with_diet/", "created_utc": 1619278562.0, "score": 4340, "author": "kitt-cat", "num_comments": 754, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/mxmbx7/sometimes_i_just_get_really_annoyed_with_diet/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to make your food taste DAMN good", "selftext": "Edit: If your first instinct is to instantly reply with \"MSG!\", I do mention the stuff, and about thirty people already beat you to it.\n\nPeople sometimes come here and ask \"what's the secret to good food?\" or \"how do I jazz up (insert boring meal here)?\" or \"how do I take my cooking to the next level?\" Of course there isn't just *one neat trick* to turn your food amazing, but an arsenal of techniques that you can pick from to make food taste great.\n\nThis list will overlap heavily with Salt Fat Acid Heat, because that book really does capture the fundamentals of cooking. Go buy it if you haven't already!\n\n**Salt:** Possibly the most important ingredient to master. Salt isn't a spice, it enhances flavors already there. Learn to \"salt to taste\", which is as simple as tasting something, adding salt, and tasting again. Learn to add salt during the cooking process, so your food is evenly seasoned. Even if you have to cook for people with different tolerances for salt, at least add some minimum of salt during cooking.\n\n**Fat is flavor:** Yes, fat is calories (so are carbs and proteins), but calories aren't fundamentally bad. Not only can fat provide flavor of its own, it also carries flavors and distributes heat.\n\n***Really*** **brown your meats:** Browning doesn't just mean \"cook until its not pink anymore\". Browning creates new flavors and in my opinion no spice enhances the flavor of chicken more than a good sear. Figure out the sweet spot of stove temperature and time that gives you a nice brown crust without burning.\n\n**Deglaze your Pan:** The \"brown bits\" stuck to the bottom of the pan after searing are full of flavor. Remove the food from the pan, and add a liquid (stock, broth, wine, even water in a pinch) and scrape. The brown bits will dissolve and create a super flavorful liquid. I do recommend letting the pan cool slightly before doing this or your liquid may instantly vaporize and take all its aromatic goodness with it.\n\n**Build on top of an aromatic flavor base:** This technique is so common in savory cooking that you'll almost never see a recipe that doesn't use some form of it. An aromatic flavor base is simply aromatic ingredients cooked in a fat, on top of which you build the rest of your meal. Usually the ingredients are minced or even pureed because the point is to get all of their flavor into the fat. It can be as simple as minced onions sauted in butter, or a complex blend of fresh spices and vegetables as you might find in Indian curries. Specific aromatic bases are often the foundation of a region's cuisine and you'll easily notice them if you follow enough recipes.\n\n**Add Umami for \"Bass Notes\":** The savory/umami flavor is often described as \"deep\". This taste occurs naturally in a lot of ingredients like meats, mushrooms, cheeses, and tomatos, but you can take it to the next level with umami rich ingredients like fish sauce, anchovies, tomato paste, or just plain MSG (which is *completely okay* unless you have a specific intolerance to the stuff). These ingredients are very potent so add them a little at a time (using the \"taste as you go\" technique).\n\n**Add Acid for \"High Notes\":** Acidic flavors are often described as \"bright\", and contrast well with the umami bass notes. Ingredients like citrus juices, vinegars, fruits, and wines will add an extra dimension of flavor to a dish. Of course on its own, sour is an unappealing taste and if you use too much you can ruin a dish. So use the trusty old \"taste as you go\" technique to add just enough acid to make your dish sing.\n\n**Mind your textures:** How food feels in the mouth can be just as important as its flavor. Broccoli that still has a bit of crunch tastes much better than broccoli boiled to oblivion. And no matter what doneness you like your steak, you probably like it that way because that's where the texture of the meat is *just right*. Getting the right texture is usually a matter of controlling your temperature and will take practice. For vegetables just pick one out and taste it, and decide if it's the texture you want or if it needs more time. For meats, you just have to get used to what temperatures and what times produce the results you want. With meats you'll often want to cook at two different temperatures: hot/fast and low/slow, to better arrive at the perfect destination. An instant read thermometer is a godsend for getting your meat to the right level of doneness.\n\n**Balance and Constrast your flavors:** I saved this for last because it's the most difficult to pin down. The human tongue loves contrast - both between flavors and textures. Crispy with tender, crunchy with creamy, salty with sweet, savory with sour, smoky with spicy, the list goes on. When we say a meal is \"balanced\", that often means that there's many different dimensions of flavors and texture that we can sense at the same time, with none of those components taking away from the others. To help you understand this concept, the next time you're eating a meal you really enjoy, think of all the words you could use to describe it, aside from words that just mean \"good\". Those words will reveal the contrasts and balances that make that dish great. For example, take a reuben sandwich: you have crispy and tender bread, crunchy and acidic saurkraut, sweet and creamy dressing, salty and savory corned beef, and salty and creamy swiss cheese. Or take the taco, which in its infinite variety of forms often balances the deep and savory flavor of its filling with the brighter flavors of its salsa.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dneicg/how_to_make_your_food_taste_damn_good/", "created_utc": 1572099839.0, "score": 4221, "author": "NailBat", "num_comments": 466, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/dneicg/how_to_make_your_food_taste_damn_good/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Add a bunch of fat to your white rice", "selftext": "I\u2019m Cuban American, my grandparents came here from Cuba in the 60s (for obvious reasons). One thing I feel grateful for was getting authentic Cuban cooking from my grandmother for so many years - she never measured anything, she just knew how to make it all taste right. Even the best Cuban restaurants never came close to her food. \n\nOne thing I remember is that her white rice was always so good. Good enough to eat a bowl of it on its own. It just had so much flavor, and white rice is a daily staple dish for almost all Cuban dishes. \n\nNow I\u2019ve tried so hard to replicate her white rice.

{"title": "Acidity is not a single flavor!", "selftext": "UPDATE: Did you know citrus zest isn't acidic? I've been updating [this blog post](https://www.culinarycrush.biz/all/the-types-of-acidity) with details I've learned since I posted this to reddit.\n\nChances are, you are already incorporating acidity into your cooking. But are you thoughtful about ***which*** ***type*** of acidity to use for a given dish? Because lemon doesn't work with everything.\n\nIn this post, I describe the different types of acidity and how you can incorporate each into your cooking.\n\n# What's acidity?\n\nTo chefs, acidity is control. When used judiciously, acidity can brighten a heavy or fatty dish, bring attention to subtler flavors in a dish, or add complexity. Acidity can also diminish the perception of sweetness and bitterness or decrease the salt required to balance your dish.\n\nWhen adding acids to a recipe, it\u2019s helpful to think of acidity as not a flavor but a *category* of flavors. There are different *types* of acidity, and each type has its pros and cons. Knowing which type of acidity to reach for (or knowing when to combine types of acidity to make a dish more interesting) will make your dishes more cohesive and thoughtful.\n\nSo let\u2019s walk through the types of acidity \u2014 what they are, what they\u2019re good for, and where to find them.\n\n# Citric acid\n\nWhen most people think of acidity, they think of citric acid. That\u2019s because citric acid is the primary acid in citrus fruits such as lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange, and yuzu.\n\nTo me, citric acid tastes like early morning sunshine. It\u2019s bright, it\u2019s assertive, and it can stand on its own. It is the most acidic (i.e. it is lowest on the pH scale) of the popular acids.\n\n***When to use citric acid***\n\nI prefer to use citric acid in dishes that I want to taste *fresh*. Think salads or white fish preparations. When saut\u00e9ing vegetables, for example, you might find that your vegetables taste less vibrant after you\u2019ve cooked them; a squeeze of lemon can revive those cooked vegetables \u2014 bringing out flavors that are more reminiscent of the vegetable in its raw form.\n\nCitric acid loses much of its characteristic tang with heat. You can use this to your advantage if hoping to subdue citric acid (e.g. cooking oranges with braised duck), or you can choose to add your citrus towards the end of the cooking process. The rinds of citrus tend to contain more citric acid, so don\u2019t be afraid to zest.\n\n***Where to find citric acid***\n\nIn addition to buying citrus, you can also buy pure citric acid. This can be useful when you want to incorporate the effects of citric acid without the flavors (particularly the sweetness) that come along with citrus. I often use the powder in the *leche de tigre* for my ceviche when I want more control of the acid levels. This method enables me to marinate my raw seafood in a liquid like shrimp broth instead of using just citrus juice.\n\n# Lactic acid\n\nLactic acid is the primary flavor associated with lacto-fermentation. If you\u2019ve tasted pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, or yoghurt, you\u2019ve tasted lactic acid. Even sourdough bread\u2019s acidity is due in part to lactic acid.\n\nI think of lactic acid like turning up the dimmer in your living room. It\u2019s a softer, rounder glow than citric acid \u2014 almost milky. I typically associate lactic acid with a bit of funkiness too, partially because it is usually derived from the fermentation of some other ingredient.\n\n***When to use lactic acid***\n\nI use lactic acid in dishes that need an uplifting note that is not distracting. Earthy broths or sauces seasoned with lactic acid still feel earthy but nonetheless sip lighter.\n\nI often add brightness to vegetable dishes by seasoning the vegetable with its lacto-fermented self. For example, when making celery root puree, I find that adding lemon (i.e. citric acid) is too noticeable \u2014 it doesn\u2019t belong! So I season my celery root puree with fermented celery root instead.\n\n***Where to find lactic acid***\n\nThe best way to find lactic acid is to ferment something! Lacto-fermentation is easy, and it enables you to add subtle funk to your dishes. I also like to preserve lemons in order to mellow out the citrus\u2019s citric acid with some lactic acid.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to rely on fermentation to add lactic acid to your dishes. You can also buy powdered lactic acid and incorporate it as needed. For example, I have a stash of lactic acid powder that I add to my yeasted pizza dough recipe to simulate a bit of the sourness of sourdough bread.\n\n# Acetic acid\n\nAcetic acid is the acidity you associate with vinegar or kombucha. It\u2019s also found in trace amounts in sourdough bread (alongside lactic acid) and wines (especially natty wine or those described as having \u201cvolatile acidity\u201d). Acetic acid is usually produced when alcohol is fermented in the presence of oxygen.\n\nI think of acetic acid like shining a flashlight on the heavier elements of your dish. Thanks in part to its pungent smell, it sticks out a bit, never quite mingling with the other ingredients.\n\n***When to use acetic acid***\n\nThe beauty of acetic acid is the accessibility of vinegar varieties. From rice wine vinegar to balsamic and everything in between, it\u2019s easy to find a vinegar that complements your salad or main course.\n\nMore so than other types of acidity, vinegar begs for fats to complement its sourness and tame its smell. Emulsions of vinegar and butter or olive oil serve this purpose well.\n\n***Where to find acetic acid***\n\nI don\u2019t just buy vinegars. I make them, too. Homemade vinegars (especially those made from fruits and vegetables) can have a thicker mouthfeel and sweeter taste, making them more balanced and almost a sauce on their own. The Noma Guide to Fermentation is an incredible resource for making your own vinegar.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not planning months ahead with a custom vinegar, I also like to flavor otherwise neutral vinegars (like white wine vinegar). For example, before making mushrooms, I might throw mushroom scraps in with the vinegar I plan to use the next day.\n\nMost often, I opt for an extremely strong vinegar called \u00e4ttika. From Sweden, \u00e4ttika vinegar is four times as strong as regular vinegar, so it works well when you want to adjust acidity without imparting other flavors. I have a little spray bottle with \u00e4ttika vinegar that I use to spritz a dish when I realize that it wasn\u2019t as acidic as I was hoping.\n\n# Malic acid\n\nMalic acid is the acidity in a green apple. It\u2019s also the principle acid found in apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, mirabelle plums, peaches, pears, and quince. A cheap cooking wine tastes like malic acid to me.\n\nI think of malic acid like sunshine through a stained-glass window. It\u2019s subtler than citric acid in a way that I can only describe as warm.\n\n***When to use malic acid***\n\nI find that malic acid works well to bring life to meat-centric dishes \u2014 particularly pork. It mingles well with sweetness, too, making it great for desserts.\n\nI don\u2019t use malic acid much on its own, but I do try to incorporate it into dishes that are already acidic to add more complexity. A sauce with multiple types of acidity can taste like a whole fruit basket! For example, I often add both white wine and vinegar to butter sauces (i.e. I mix malic acid with acetic acid). Fermenting blackberries, similarly, is a means to add lactic acid to malic-rich berries.\n\n***Where to find malic acid***\n\nI keep some reduced white wine handy to adjust the malic acidity in dishes. Otherwise, I keep powdered malic acid on hand to adjust the liquids I use in my ceviche.\n\n# Other acids\n\nThe four acids I\u2019ve described only scratch the surface. But the other acids don\u2019t have as many culinary uses.\n\nOxalic acid (found in wood sorrel, chives, and purslane) certainly comes in handy (and is reminiscent of acetic acid), but excessive consumption of oxalic acid can be toxic. Tartaric acid plays an important role in lowering the pH in wine production, and it\u2019s mixed with baking soda to become baking powder. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid is common too \u2014 because it's vitamin C!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHope this was helpful. And when life gives you lemons, be sure to think twice about whether that\u2019s the acidity life really needs right now.\n\nEdit: A couple folks asked about the blog where I post similar thoughts on food.

{"title": "Marshmallow Mania and the Cult of 240F.", "selftext": "Big Mallow is a cabal that's been spreading disinformation. 240F is a big, fat, arbitrary lie. \n\n(**tl;dr:** Marshmallow Mania hit me, and I spent 20+ hours making marshmallows. My findings suggest that the texture of marshmallows is dependent on the sum total proportions of the marshmallow ingredients, not the degree of sugar syrup heating. 240F is an arbitrary syrup temperature, and is used across the board for relatively similar ingredient proportions.)\n\nA short time ago, I was developing my \"egg yolk-based marshmallow\"/marshyellow recipe (still needs a bit of tweaking). I was doing some research, and noticed something kind of...odd about the information regarding a specific step.\n\n[Here's the Wikipedia entry for making marshmallows that gave me pause, courtesy of Chocolates and confections: Formula, theory, and technique for the artisan confectioner:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow#Home_making_process)\n\nAnything jump out at you? No? That might be because you haven't read a variety of marshmallow recipes.\n\n- [Here's a recipe (allegedly) from America's Test Kitchen:] (https://www.thefrugalgirl.com/how-to-make-homemade-marshmallows)\n\n- [New York Times Cooking:](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019101-marshmallows)\n\n- [Serious Eats:] (https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/12/classic-marshmallows-recipe.html)\n\n- [Epicurious:] (https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/homemade-marshmallows-242701)\n\n- [Alton Brown:](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/homemade-marshmallows-recipe-1953933)\n\n- [Martha Stewart:](https://www.marthastewart.com/333974/homemade-marshmallows)\n\n- [Francisco freakin' Migoya:](https://www.saint-honore.me/blog/marshmallows)\n\n- [Bruno Albouze, the one outlier:](https://brunoalbouze.com/recipe/marshmallow/)\n\nBruno aside, they ALL place marshmallows at 238F-240F. I've seen a lot of marshmallow recipes in my time, and I've NEVER seen Wikipedia's method of 227F. (And I was so confused by Bruno's recipe...265F was way higher than any I'd seen. But we'll come back to this.) \n\nWait, it gets even more confusing.\n\n- [Now, here's a chart about sugar syrups:](https://www.thermoworks.com/pdf/candy_temperature_chart.pdf) Note the location of marshmallows in their chart.\n\n- [Cook's Info on where 'mallows belong:](https://www.cooksinfo.com/hard-ball-stage)\n\n- [LorAnnOils:](https://www.lorannoils.com/sugar-science) They place marshmallows in the firm-ball stage.\n\nMy confusion kept growing with every article I read. Everyone's telling me something different. Recipes that call for soft-ball! No, proclaim the sugar syrup stages, firm-ball or hard-ball! And for some reason, Wikipedia's telling me the THREAD stage is what you want. This was perturbing; if baking is a science, my impression of candy making is that of analytical chemistry. It's precise, exact, and demands strict adherence to the recipe beyond what baking asks and cajoles. I was under the impression that the sugar syrup's concentration is critical to somehow correctly forming marshmallows. So what's going on here? Why's everyone using the same temperature in their recipes, despite background info to the contrary?\n\nClearly, there's a conspiracy being perpetrated by Big Mallow. They're trying to keep us in the dark, to prevent us from tinkering with marshmallow recipes.\n\n[So I...um...made a ton of marshmallows to figure this out.](https://i.imgur.com/eEIm5Zh.jpg) (pictured: about 2/3 of every batch I made, along with some marshyellow variants) Marshmallow Mania reigned supreme, and I spent an ungodly amount of time making them for both this experiment, and for my marshyellow recipe improvement. I'll also note that I had to eat an ungodly number of the stupid clouds of sugar and fluff, and would gladly never consume another so long as I draw breath. \n\nFirst, to determine if you can make marshmallows at all of the claimed stages. [I checked my thermometer in a pot of boiling water to ensure accurate readings.](https://i.imgur.com/6lCYAGx.jpg) Then I made batches of marshmallows at varying sugar syrup temperatures.\n\nHere's my recipe and methodology (base recipe is based on a scaled-down version of Migoya's 'mallows):\n\n8g powdered gelatin\n\n47g cold water\n\n110g granulated, white sugar\n\n120g corn syrup\n\n50g water\n\n3g salt\n\n~2.5mL vanilla extract\n\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, bloom the gelatin in the cold water. Combine sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan. Heat to (VARIABLE) temperature, and slowly add to bloomed gelatin, while whipping on medium-low speed. Turn mixer speed to max, and whip for exactly five minutes, adding the salt and vanilla halfway through. Using a greased spatula, scoop as much batter as possible into a greased pan, and use a greased offset spatula to smooth the top. Let sit for a minimum of 8 hours to cure, then cut into cubes and coat in an equal mixture (w/w) of cornstarch and powdered sugar.\n\nBetween each batch, I scrupulously cleaned all utensils with hot water to avoid sugar crystal residue.\n\n[Left-to-right: 225F. 230F, 240F, 245F, 250F, 262F](https://i.imgur.com/zuWrS02.jpg)\n\n\nAfter coating, the marshmallows were stored at room temperature in ziploc bags to maintain freshness/moisture contents.\n\nThe most apparent conclusion is that, yes, you can ABSOLUTELY make marshmallows at varying sugar syrup stages. Well, in a sense. They're all \"marshmallows\", in the sense that they're masses of aerated, gelatinized sugar blobs. I'm sure plenty of people have their own personal textural notions of what a \"marshmallow\" should be. But here are the differences:\n\nVolume: Due to what I imagine is increased viscosity (due to decreased water concentrations of the syrup), the volume of batter decreases proportionally to elevated sugar temps. [Here, you can see the two extremes, 225F vs 262F.](https://i.imgur.com/TNatXf9.jpg)\n\nWeight: The lower temps allowed for increased aeration, which resulted in larger yields of 'mallow, and there's a downward trend corresponding to total batch weights and increased syrup temps. (225F->262F respectively, 249g, 242g, 222g, 211g, 203g, 165g)\n\nTexture: The higher the syrup temp, the chewier and more \"taffy-like\" the marshmallow. Charybdis, my poor stand mixer, had a tough time whipping the 262F, that stuff was t h i c c. In contrast, the 225F melts in your mouth, with barely any chew. Far more pillowy, jiggly, etc.\n\nCaramelization: The lower the syrup temp, the higher the final moisture content. [Held 10cm away from a torch, I noticed that it took slightly longer to caramelize the lower temp marshmallows](https://i.imgur.com/6ClOdSK.jpg). I wonder if there's also an aeration-based insulation factor at work (given the apparent increase in aeration in the lower-temp syrups).\n\nSo now I knew you can make marshmallows at most sugar syrup stages (I haven't tried soft-crack and upwards, I fear for my stand mixer's health after the 262F). Then I had a thought: what if the sugar syrup was a function of achieving a specific texture?\n \nEnter the final experiment. Let's take the taffymallows of 262F and see if we can turn them into 230F squishmallows. At 262F, the sugar concentration is ~92%, and at 230F, it's ~80%. I calculated the amount of water lost at 262F, and added an amount of water to the gelatin that would correspond to the concentration at 230F. I figured it's easier to work \"backwards\", ie, make a higher temp identical to a lower temp. Going \"forwards\" might create an issue where reducing the water added to the gelatin leads to insufficient bloom. I don't thiiink you can \"over-bloom\" gelatin, so I doubt the reverse is true.\n\nWell. [Here's the faux-230F with the real 230F:](https://i.imgur.com/nOK0Zcp.jpg): \n\n[Compare the volume difference of the [faux-230F](https://imgur.com/a/D8E6dBA) to the [262F and the 225F](https://i.imgur.com/TNatXf9.jpg). By visual inspection, they were about double in volume to the original 262F! **And the texture was near-identical in nature to the 230F.** The former were ever-so-slightly softer and \"meltier\", but they were also made a day or so after the latter, and I'm convinced that this accounts for the minor discrepancy. The final batch weights were identical too, suggesting similar aeration percentages. \n\n(Note: The fact that they're *identical* is a happy coincidence. There will be minor discrepancies due to unequal scooping of the batter into the pans, as well as additional mass from the sugar/cornstarch mixture. I cut all the batches into similar size cubes, so the surface areas would be similar, and they'd pick up similar quantities of the mixture.)\n\nSuddenly, Bruno's aberrant 265F temperature made sense. His recipe uses egg whites in addition to gelatin, and egg whites are ~90% water. He heats his syrup to a much higher stage to compensate for the additional moisture content. I imagine that if you followed his recipe to a T, but stuck with good ol' 240F, the marshmallows would barely have much structure, and would be closer to the 225F squishmallows than what you'd typically want out of a marshmallow.\n\nI did a repeat experiment with a different final hydration stage: 262F to 240F. The results were the same as before: I compared the product to my 262F and 240F marshmallows, and again, the faux-240F were no different than the real 240F (save, again, for a near-imperceptible difference for the same given reason as before).\n\nNow, I refuse to say \"I conclude X to be true\", because my experiment isn't rigorous in the least. I didn't repeat each step numerous times, testing every possible extreme, I didn't test every potential example, etc. I would, but I think I'd go nuts, as I'd have an issue juggling this with my full-time job and other hobbies. I also nearly ran out of my 1lb tub of gelatin. So I'm going to leave it as \"the data *suggests* that...\"\n\nBut the general idea this all suggests - aside from me being crazy - is that you can alter marshmallow recipes to achieve a texture *you* prefer simply by changing either the syrup temperature, or the gelatin hydration. If you found a nice recipe for egg white marshmallows, but find them too soft for your liking, you can decrease the gelatin hydration within reason, and/or increase the sugar syrup temperature by some amount to make them chewier and more stable. If you don't mind the bit of math, you use this info to take more control of the marshmallow process.\n\nI'm still not sure why people so unanimously use 240F as their temperature. I can imagine a scenario where Head Chef tells their underlings \"Heat it to 240F, because [something something reasonable-yet-incorrect explanation]\", and everyone follows HC's lead and reasoning. They move up the ranks, and proliferate HC's recipes, and if challenged about the reasoning, refer to HC's expertise to bolster their claims. [Look how many differing explanations people have about brownie skin/crust formation:]( https://youtu.be/FuO1kzpKtEU?t=639) It's easier to pull from your combined experience and instinct, and offer up a reasonable explanation, than to rigorously experiment your way to the answer. Or maybe there's actually a cult, I dunno.\n\nBut anyhow, thus concludes the week of the marshmallow. Please subject to peer review if you're also marshmallow-obsessed. I'd love additional insights and data!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lckowv/marshmallow_mania_and_the_cult_of_240f/", "created_utc": 1612459132.0, "score": 4030, "author": "Fluffy_Munchkin", "num_comments": 283, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/lckowv/marshmallow_mania_and_the_cult_of_240f/", "html_title": ""}

This requires a special time of the year (now is great, atleast in the Netherlands). My pines are from the Pinus Sylvestrus.\n\nstep 2. Cut off the stem of the pine cones. I used scissors to cut the woody part where they are attached to the branch.\n\nstep 3. preboil them in water for 15 minuts to clean them off and to get rid of the harder resins. These resins may cause a bitter taste.\n\nstep 4. simmer them for two hours in a simple sirup. ive added honey (fructose) to it, so that the sirup wont cristalize too much from the sugar (sucrose). Also added a tiny bit of vanilla sugar (optional).\n\nstep 5. let it cool for atleast 12 hours, then simmer the mixture again for 20 minuts. you can see a beautiful brown reddish colour appear in the syrup. the taste of the syrup is already phenomenal!\n\nstep 6. repeat step 5 atleast 3 times. i still havent figured out why this is necessary and how many times i should do this. love some advice on that.\n\nstep 7. simmer out all the moist and find your right sirup consistency. do note that the sirup gets thicker when it cools down.\n\nThis recipe requires time, thus patience. I believe the longer that the cones rest in the syrup mixture, the better. I have also read something about osmosis, replacing moist with sugar, which requires time. please educate me on that as well in the context of my pine cones. I hope to get totally rid of the slightly bitter taste of the cones and the light woody texture over time.\n\nHere is a picture of the [end result](https://ibb.co/gP0vNSz).\nand [here ](https://ibb.co/ZXrbm66) some more.\nI can tell you, theyre soo fascinating!\nSpecial thanks to everyone who has reached out to me for help!

Or just plain rice). Rice is quite easy as you just wash the rice, put water, and press the button. Sometimes I also make rice in batches and freeze it\n* Oatmeal. Add peanut butter and milk for extra calories. To make it easily digestible, make it more watery/soupy than normal\n* Bread. PB&J, cheese toast, jam, or just plain bread if I'm feeling nauseous.\n* Calorie Mate/energy bar/meal replacement bars/shakes.

Add your own seasonings, frozen vegs, frozen dumplings, eggs, etc\n* Eggs. Tofu egg (smash tofu, add to egg, fry), fried egg, scrambled egg, boiled egg, frozen vegs egg, all eggs.\n* Rice cooker meal. You can add other meat/vegs too in the rice\n   * Rich rice: Milk, butter, rice, dried herbs.\n   * \"Fried rice\": Soy sauce, sesame oil, water, rice.\n   * Risotto rice: Stocks, water\n\nLevel 3 (I can do small/urgent tasks)\n\n* Soup. Throw any vegs/meats you have, add stock powder/msg. Herbs would make it better but not adding any will still taste good. Adding dried pasta would bulk it up\n* Canned fish/meat. You can bulk it up by adding vegetables, sauces, or even instant cream soup. Eat with rice/pasta/bread\n* Pancake. Just make normal batter as usual, but if I have energy for it, I'll make extra so I can freeze it up\n* Tomato egg. Cook scrambled eggs, set aside, cook tomato with ketchup, add the egg back in. Done. You can also add baked beans to it\n\nLevel 2 (I'm just feeling the blues, nothing too bad. Function almost as well as normal)\n\n* Pasta dishes, like napoleon, carbonara, or even macaroni soup. Saucy pasta is easy but a bit messy IMO\n* Proteins like chicken, meatballs, stir fry beef, etc. Handling meat is also quite messy, so I don't make it a lot except if I can handle the cleanup\n* Fried rice. Soy sauce fried rice, golden fried rice, kimchi fried rice\n\nLevel 1 (Happy, upbeat, full of energy)\n\nJust cook as normal. There's no special recipe here. I will either try out new, complicated recipe, bake, or meal prep, so I can prepare for level 5 again.\n\nDon't starve yourself.

As usual if you'd like to support me or prefer video guides, here's the link to the [recipe and technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmjkkapeCX4). I've also linked to all my past r/cooking posts in the comments below.\n\nThe sight of a [Shawarma spit rotating slowly while grilling](https://i.imgur.com/1yFDzj7.mp4) is breathtaking and majestic. The meat slowly bubbles and fries up on the exterior, while melted fat and juices trickle down the assembled shawarma cone. Then like a trained violinist, the shawarma meister [shaves the exterior of the cone](https://imgur.com/vFVa5NV) into thin strips of grilled meat before wrapping it in some flatbread. It is a true site to behold, and the experience of eating shawarma that was shaved seconds before is one you'll likely never forget. So what is one to do when you have no shawarma shops nearby and the craving strikes. Well the answer is to make your own but the problem with that is it's near impossible to get the correct grilled flavor and texture without a rotisserie, that is until today. I'm going to show you how to make the best homemade chicken shawarma of your life, using a technique that I developed that requires no special equipment (except some skewers) and can be done in any grill or broiler equipped oven.\n\n## What is Chicken Shawarma\nShawarma is the name given in the Middle East to a dish of layered meat which is grilled on a rotating spit, it commonly comes in two forms; Chicken or Meat (either beef, lamb or a mix of both). It's served throughout the middle east with every country putting their own unique twist on the marinades and sauces that are used. For the most part shawarma is eaten [as a sandwich](https://cdn.nogarlicnoonions.com/images/thumbs/image.php/image_05dba4cfe056d8950714190f6deaeef1.jpg?width=2000&height=2000&image=/images/articles/2019-01/main2019-01-06-09-57-05.jpg), but it's also sometimes [served with rice](https://syriankitchensa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lamb-shawarma-plate.jpg), [on hummus](https://www.tasteofbeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/copy-hummus-wmeat.jpg) or with a salad. The popularity of shawarma and it's appeal as a quick delicious street food has lead to it spreading all over the world particularly as a late night meal.  \n\nThere are a number of international variants of shawarma such as Turkish D\u00f6ner (this is actually the historical origin of shawarma), Greek Gyros, and Mexican Al pastor (invented by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico), though today we will be focusing only on Levantine (specifically Syrian and Lebanese) style Chicken Shawarma sandwiches. These sandwiches are put together using the freshly shaved chicken, Toum (Thick garlic sauce, see my last post for this, link in notes), salty pickled cucumbers and Shatta (Chilli sauce, also in my last post), all wrapped together in a [thin stretchy flatbread called Saj](https://ak.picdn.net/offset/photos/5500868c5a10fc50d2d059e6/medium/offset_196904.jpg). Some people opt to add in slices of Tomato, lettuce, French fries or potato chips (crisps) for additional flavors or textures, but I feel it's unnecessary and the shawarma sandwich can shine without them. Once wrapped in the bread, the sandwich is toasted on a panini press for a minute, to crisp up the exterior of the bread and seal the sandwich shut.   \n\nThe issue with cooking chicken shawarma at home is that it's really hard to get the right texture without the assistance of a [rotisserie](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/6udm3n_Nr8G1sla6qb7ZnXGb4Mb1V_uvSqTPv0iGwKUcNPOYUl628JrfEDdH_kQ8RRA3AWzmNIXH5tskfK2-mRShHBQwTRIMV_Ack2L0VwIK0YmQpa2F4PWL7HD7jO1MS6DztIgEzl3RPdj-0uI). As the rotisserie spins, the meat cooks from the outside inwards, and attains a glossy grilled char on the outer surface. Once shaved you'll end up with pieces that on one side are perfectly juicy and tender soft meat, and on the other side are crisped and lightly charred with an amazing grilled flavor. That texture is essential for correctly made chicken shawarma, and unfortunately it's really difficult to get using most home cooking methods. Although the marinade adds the majority of the flavor to the dish, it won't taste or feel right without the grilled exterior.  \n\nThe simplest method to use for home cooked shawarma is to cut your marinated chicken into strips and then pan fry them. It works in a pinch and will give you chicken strips that taste similar to shawarma, but I've found that this method doesn't give you any resemblance in terms of texture and crucially the meat is missing a charred/grilled flavor. Another method that is quite simple, is to grill whole chicken thighs or breast fillets (slices about 1 cm thick) in a griddle or grill pan, then slicing it into strips before serving. This will give you a better texture and some char, and is my preferred method if I'm in a rush. However the texture is still quite different from that of genuine shawarma and the reason for that lies in the direct contact the chicken pieces will have with the pan. It will cause the meat to cook a lot quicker on the outside than it will on the inside, so you'll end up with a larger variation of doneness across a cross section of the meat.  \n\nOne strange technique I've seen a lot recently, involves [stacking your whole chicken pieces](https://img.buzzfeed.com/tasty-app-user-assets-prod-us-east-1/tips/7528a357206249b3b667eebb0badf2a8.jpeg?output-quality=auto&resize=800:*) on some skewers, and baking it upright in the oven. Although this might look closer to a traditional shawarma cone, it's absolutely illogical, as you have to bake the whole thing until cooked through to the center. Although well intentioned, this method will basically give you over done and dry outer edges with some browning, and a well cooked center with 0 color. So what can you do to get realistic shawarma at home?   \n\nMy technique is designed to grilling steak in a restaurant setting, to ensure that we get a perfectly cooked center in our meat, while still ensuring we get a crispy grilled outside. We will use the grill or broiler function to obtain a nice crust and grilled flavor. First the marinated chicken is sliced into thin strips about 1/2cm or 1/4in thick, then its suspended between two skewers. The filled skewers are placed on the edge of a baking tray or dish so that the meat is suspended in mid air and isn't touching the base. The tray is then placed under the broiler or grill in the oven to cook and is rotated every few minutes until lightly charred and cooked through. This is the best technique I have found for cooking chicken shawarma at home, and it really does mimic that of rotisserie shawarma. The direct heat from the grill or broiler allows you to develop char and crispiness, without the meat constricting and shrinking as it would in a pan.  \n\n## History\nThe origins of Shawarma is one of many stories and timelines, and has been claimed by many nations. The name Shawarma may have come from the Turkish word \u00e7evirme, which some sources say means turning, though my google-fu has said it means translation (technically this still is a form of movement). But all indicators do point to this being an ottoman food, and that's mainly due to its importance and stature in the countries that make up the former ottoman empire. One very important clue on its ottoman origins was discovered [in the background of a painting](https://images.culinarybackstreets.com/wp-content/uploads/cb_istanbul_bookclub_bountifulempire_doner_shahnama-363x450.jpg?lossy=1&ssl=1) from 1616 which the food historian [Priscilla Mary I\u015f\u0131n](https://culinarybackstreets.com/cities-category/istanbul/2018/cb-book-club-11/) discovered and wrote about in her book 'Bountiful Empire: A History of Ottoman Cuisine'. It dates the rotation method of cooking kebab to at least the 17th century.\n\nShawarma is thought to have first gone vertical through the work of Iskender Efendi in the 19th century (1867 to be exact) in the city of Bursa. He is also the inventor of the [Iskender Kebab](https://www.tourmakerturkey.com/uploads/8/7/4/4/8744530/6423069_orig.jpeg), which consists of meat shawarma placed on a bed of bread, then topped with a tomato sauce, browned butter and yoghurt. His descendants still run a restaurant in the city of Bursa to this day. Speaking of vertical shawarma, nearly all shawarma is now cooked vertically, but over the past decade there has been a resurgence in horizontally cooked shawarma. This is usually done over [a coal fire pit](https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img/https://karasshawarma.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/karas-shawarma-1.jpg) and is honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten.\n\nThe spread of shawarma through the rest of the middle east is not clear and there aren't any credible stories of how it got transformed into a sandwich nor how it came to be combined with Toum and Shatta. However given that Toum is very much a Levantine invention and is a main component of chicken shawarma sandwiches, it's likely that it spread from either Syria or Lebanon. One clue to the Syrian origins of Chicken shawarma sandwiches also lies in the stores that sell shawarma throughout the Arab world. One of the oldest shawarma stores in Egypt is called Abo Ammar El Sory, which literally means Ammar's Father - The Syrian. There are also lots of other Syrian joints that specialize in shawarma throughout Cairo, though I'm unsure if this is just a phenomenon in Egypt.  \n\nOne thing that we can say for sure is that Shawarma has spread throughout the world over recent years, and this is mostly attributed to the rise in Syrian refugees opening restaurants in the countries they now call home. London, UK is home to dozens of these, some of which put out shawarma that can rival any I've had in the Middle East. Europe has been a hotbed for Turkish Doner Kebabs for a long time, but the shawarma sandwich is now posing a new challenge to their dominance.\n\n## Flavor Profile\n\nThe chicken shawarma itself has a mild but complex spiced flavor due to the varied amounts of spices in it. You can easily pick up the flavors of Bay, cloves, cardamom and turmeric. The paprika and tomato paste add some depth to the shawarma and much needed umaminess. Adding lemon and vinegar to the marinade give it acidity but at the same time they serve to tenderize the chicken in conjunction with the yoghurt. Once cooked the flavors in the marinade mellow down slightly and you also get the grilled flavor coming through. Finally the great thing about cooking the shawarma with this method, is that you are still able to taste the chicken itself.\n\nAs a sandwich, it has quite a great and well rounded flavor. The first flavor you notice is the grilled bread, which I think is a step that gets left out too often. The freshly baked flavor you get from toasting it is essential to the shawarma experience. The next thing that cuts through is the garlic sauce, with its strong and pungent garlic flavor. You then get the flavors of the chicken mixed with the salt and sourness of the pickles. It's very much a memorable experience eating real shawarma for the first time as the flavors all blend together so well. If you add some chilli sauce as well then you will get a background heat in your sandwich that is really pleasant.  \n\n## Ingredients\n\n### For the Chicken Shawarma:\n* 1kg (2lbs) Boneless skinless chicken thighs\n* 4-6 Garlic cloves\n* 4 Bay Leaves\n* 1 Cup of Yoghurt\n* 4 Tbsp tomato paste\n* 3 Tbsp Lemon Juice\n* 1 Tbsp Olive Oil\n* 1 Tbsp White Vinegar\n* 2 Tsp Salt\n* 1 Tsp Ground Cumin\n* 1 Tsp Garlic Powder\n* 1 Tsp Boharat\n* 1 Tsp Onion Powder\n* 1/2 Tsp Chilli Flakes\n* 1/2 Tsp Ground Coriander\n* 1/2 Tsp Cinnamon\n* 1/2 Tsp Smoked Paprika\n* 1/2 Tsp Turmeric\n* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper\n* 1/2 Tsp Ground Ginger\n* 1/2 Tsp Cloves\n* 1/4 Tsp Nutmeg\n* 1/4 Tsp Ground Cardamom \n\n### Sandwich Ingredients:\n* Saj bread if you can find it, Lavash or Lebanese bread if you cannot\n* Salty Lebanese pickled cucumbers or if you can't find it then get salty cornichons\n* Toum sauce (recipe in my last post, link in the comments)\n* Chilli sauce (recipe in my last post, link in the comments)\n\n## Directions\n\n### Marinade directions:\n1. Butterfly or pound your chicken thighs until they are 1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick, even thickness is crucial for a great cook. If you are using chicken breasts then butterfly them and then pound to an even thickness\n2. Crush your bay leaves using a pestle and mortar or a spice grinder (you can use some of the salt to help with this), then add to a bowl with the remaining spices\n3. Mince your garlic and mix with the Yoghurt, Tomato Paste, Lemon Juice, Olive oil, white vinegar and the spice mix. Stir until well mixed and then add your chicken in to the bowl and mix to ensure each piece is well coated in the marinade\n4. Place your chicken in the fridge for a minimum of 12 hours so the marinade can really take effect\n\n### My oven grilled/broiled chicken shawarma technique:\nI highly recommend checking out my video for this as the steps are kind of hard to translate into words  \n\n1. Slice your marinated chicken thighs into strips about 1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick\n2. Using a skewer, pierce your chicken strips all along one side and slide them onto the skewer until the entire chicken thigh has been threaded on to the skewer\n3. With a second skewer, pierce the opposite end of the chicken, so that the chicken strips are suspended between both skewers, it will kind of resemble crochet. Push the thigh together so it's slightly compressed then repeat until you have filled all your skewers. Leave about an inch clear on both tips of the skewer.\n4. Line a deep baking sheet with foil or dish with foil, then place the skewers across the edge of the sheet. Either end of the skewer should be resting on opposing walls of the baking sheet, with the meat suspended between them, floating above the sheet not sitting in it (you may need to use a deep baking dish if your trays are shallow).\n5. Place your tray in the oven with your grill or broiler set to medium and cook for 3-5 minutes. Rotate the skewers to the second side and cook for another 3-5 minutes. Place them back in the over for 2-3 more minutes until slightly charred. Cooking times will really vary with each broiler or grill, but you should basically flip when it starts to develop a sear then flip when it happens on the other side. Your chicken should read 74c or 165f when done. If your broiler or grill only has one strength setting, try rotating it more often such as every minute. \n\n### Pan Grilled directions:\n1. Heat a grill pan or griddle and place a few chicken thighs in it, but don't overcrowd the pan\n2. Cook them on medium high heat, flipping them every 2-3 minutes until cooked through, this should only take a few minutes\n3. Remove and let cool slightly before slicing into thin strips\n\n### To make a shawarma sandwich:\n1. Place a piece of bread on your work surface and slather on a couple of tablespoons of Toum \n2. Add your chicken pieces on top, as well as some pieces of sliced cucumber pickle\n3. Add some chilli sauce to the sandwich then roll it up and seal\n4. Place your sandwiches in a grill pan of griddle, and weigh them down with something heavy. Allow them to sear for 30-60 seconds per side until grill marks form. You may find that wrapping the sandwiches in greaseproof paper before grilling helps keep them from splitting open.\n\n## Notes and tips\n* This recipe is specifically for CHICKEN shawarma and the marinade for meat shawarma is completely different, it probably wont taste right if you do this with meat instead\n* You can use Chicken breast instead of chicken thigh, or even a mix of both if you are doing a large quantity. The best way to do this would be to alternate strips of thigh and breast for a well mixed texture\n* I really recommend using metal skewers, but if you can't find them then regular bamboo or wooden ones will do fine, just be aware that they can burn under the grill\n* Play around with the strength of the marinade a bit, the spice blend is great but you might find that you like it a bit weaker or stronger. Try halving the spices or doubling it to suit your taste. The rest of the marinade ingredients should remain the same though\n* If you really wanted to go wild, I'd highly recommend grilling the shawarma on a charcoal grill. The flavor will be insane and honestly coal fired shawarma is so much better, you will thank me for this\n* The recipe for the Toum and Shatta (Garlic and chilli sauces) is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/j6prab/toum_is_an_insanely_fluffy_garlic_sauce_that/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jbrth8/the_homemade_chicken_shawarma_manual_a_guide_to/", "created_utc": 1602782062.0, "score": 3918, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 269, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jbrth8/the_homemade_chicken_shawarma_manual_a_guide_to/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Since I moved out, my mom and I have been hosting a cooking show for each other.", "selftext": "Since I moved out of my parents' house a bit more than a year ago, I have obviously started having to cook for myself. Luckily for me, they gave me a love of cooking, and at least a general knowledge of how to cook for myself. Most weeks I make something that makes good leftovers, and those become lunches for me for the week at work. This isn't about that though.\n\nThe thing is, I moved from New Jersey to Colorado. It's not a quick drive to visit home and my parents, it's a four hour flight. I don't get to see them very often, at least not in person. I miss sharing a fresh home cooked meal with my family every night, and coming home to an empty apartment after work gets tough after a while. The age of instant communication through phone and text helps, but its still hard. So, among other things I did last time I visited home, I gave my mom a cookbook. It had some interesting recipes, and we decided that we would cook one of them, together, over Zoom, 1600 miles apart. That was back in June, and tonight we are going to make a baked ziti together. We have been doing this about every other week, one of us picks a dish, we find or make up a recipe, and we cook it and chat for a few hours. It has become one of the highlights of my weeks, and for those of you that can and want to do something like this, I strongly recommend doing this with your loved ones.\n\nAs is implied by the title, we call it our cooking show.

Stew is delicious, but its not that fun to sit and wait for it to cook for hours staring at each other.\n\nEdit to add [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/H47nSTM) of how my ziti came out.

{"title": "The Dangers Of Having Corn Allergy In America", "selftext": "I am putting this here because the impossible to replace thread got me thinking.\n\nFor most of my adult life I have suffered from an extreme case of psoriasis. Not just those little patches on the knees and elbows, mind you, but head to toe complete body coverage. It was so bad that I was seen personally by the head of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Psoriasis Division and, after about a year of seeing him I jokingly asked him if I was was worst case he\u2019s ever seen. He looked at me and said with a wink, \u201cWorst case? Nah....Top 5, maybe.\u201d\n\nAnyway, in the process of trying to discover a, well not a cure, but a relief, I began eliminating different types of food from my diet, different types of meats, different veggies, etc. Nothing worked.\n\nThen one day, an assistant suggested that I attempt a gluten free diet to see if that would help.\n\nNow living in the Southwest U.S., there\u2019s simple solution to gluten as far as things like bread is concerned, cornmeal.\n\nAlso, along this journey, although I enjoyed cooking prior, it became necessary for me to do so to control what I ate so the experiment could take place. So, although not yet fully capable in the kitchen, it forced me to gain a rather simple adequacy just so I wasn\u2019t eating the same thing everyday.\n\nSo I began searching for recipes that avoided any type of gluten in them, and most of them included some form of corn in them.\n\nIn the subsequent week my body began exploding with a reaction I had never had before. \n\nDespite being on heavy, and I do mean HEAVY, medication that had tamped down my symptoms to a livable level, I experienced my the worst outbreak of my life.\n\nI remember at the end of the week driving into the Doctors office for an emergency appointment because it was so bad, and going over in my mind about everything I had done the previous week, where I had gone, what I had done, etc., and it hit me like a bolt of lightening out of the blue, I had eaten more corn in the last week than I ever had before.\n\nSo, when the visit was over, after we had discussed it, I came home and vowed to not touch anything with corn in it as a new experiment.\n\nNow, looking back on it, I had always done things that I should have put 2 and 2 together. For instance, despite how tasty they are, I could never eat more than a handful of Fritos, the snack bag always left half full at the end of the meal. Or I just couldn\u2019t drink American whiskey, I would always begin getting a hangover WHILE I was drinking it.\n\nLiterally within 2 days, my body began healing, medications that had not worked before, and believe me, I had a counter full of them, suddenly started working the way they were intended.\n\nBy 2 weeks, my body was as clear as it had been in years. Not to say it was totally clear, mind you, but it was certainly better than the days when I would have to soak in a bathtub for an hour, then coat myself in Vasoline just to be able to go to the store to pick up food. Yes, it was that bad.\n\nSo, as I began going through my shelves looking for anything that had corn in it, I began to toss almost everything I had, because there was some form of corn in it, whether it be a sweetener, or thickener, or even jut a filler, almost everything had some form of corn in it.\n\nAnd what I didn\u2019t know at the time, but later found out, is that most of what I kept, still had some form of corn in it, even if it was thought of as a basic ingredient or not listed.\n\nCorn is so ubiquitous in this society that even if you think you\u2019re avoiding it, you\u2019re not, you can\u2019t, it\u2019s nigh on impossible because it\u2019s in everything.\n\nSo now I cannot \u201cGo out to eat\u201d with friends.\n\nI always get the comment, \u201cYou can just have a salad\u201d. No I can\u2019t, because the salad dressing itself usually has some type of corn or corn byproduct in it.\n\nSo now, the only thing I have when I go out is water, basic water.\n\nAnd although I know that\u2019s unusual, if you had lived through what I lived through, you wouldn\u2019t do it any different.\n\nAs a result, even family gatherings are a struggle unless I am the cook because even though she tries hard to get things that don\u2019t have corn in it, inevitably my mother misses something crucial and makes a meal that ends up with a corn product in it.\n\nSo no processed foods, no soft drinks, no fast food, no restaurants, no nothing unless I cook it myself.\n\nAnd while the anti-HFCS is trending across the country, read the label, there just might be Corn Syrup itself in the product. I remember the first time I saw a bottle of some sauce that proudly displayed that it had no High Fructose Corn Syrup in it, and when I flipped it over to look at the ingredients, the second ingredient was, in fact, Corn Syrup.\n\nSo manufactures are trying to sell the idea, because that\u2019s what people are asking for now, but since corn is usually the cheapest option, that\u2019s what they end up going with, despite their proud declarations.\n\nBut all that comes to this, although I cannot have corn, that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have the ingredients, or the products, I just have to go outside America to find them.\n\nFor example, for years now, I have been using a simple mixture of Cream of Tartar and baking soda to create a substitute for baking powder, since almost all available baking powder is made here in America, with 1/3 baking soda and 2/3 cornstarch. But a few weeks ago, I was trying to figure out why the biscuits I was making were never the light and fluffy ones everyone is used to, they always seemed to fall flat in the oven instead of rising, despite my using the exact same ingredients, but only substituting the Cream of Tarter mix for the baking powder.\n\nTurns out, despite the ingredient list, there\u2019s a lot more going on with baking powder, or double acting baking powder, than first thought.\n\nIt\u2019s not just sodium bicarbonate and a base, as the ingredients say.\n\nSo I began looking for a non cornstarch based baking powder, and believe me, that\u2019s not as simple a task as it would seem, but I finally stumbled across some on Amazon and when it arrived, surprise surprise, it was french baking powder utilizing potato starch instead.\n\nSo being able to find non-corn related products can be done, just not easily here in America.\n\nI could go into why that is the case, but from what I can surmise, it really sounds crazy and like a conspiracy theory, so I won\u2019t.\n\nAnyway, the result of all this is that I am healthier and have lost weight in the process as the simple act of avoiding corn forces me to avoid a lot of other chemicals and ingredients that end up doing nasty things to our bodies.\n\nAnd not only that, I have become the go to guy that all my friends and family keep asking to cook for them because the food I cook doesn\u2019t have all those preprocessed ingredients in it and just tastes more fresh because, well it is just that.

{"title": "In praise of Chinese cuisine", "selftext": "Recently I saw a post where a guy who worked as a chef in a high end Chinese restaurant was mocked by his SIL, who is a chef trained in French cooking. She said something to the effect of \"all you cook is kung pao chicken.\"\n\nI was livid reading it. My wife is originally from mainland China and I've had the opportunity to travel there many times, and to different regions/cities within China. Chinese cuisine is one of the most diverse cuisines in the world. Some of the best food I've ever eaten in my life was in China (and some of the most challenging, ngl), and some of the cooking techniques can be very complex. I had one of the best bowls of noodles in my life at a steamy back alley noodle shop at 2 am after going to the bar (for about $2 CDN), and we've also been to 5 star restaurants that celebrate and elevate regional specialties.\n\nIt may simply be because a lot of Chinese restaurants in smaller North American communities (or even cities) tend to cook for western palates and don't serve more traditional dishes like what they might cook for themselves at home, but I hope this changes because there is a world of food out there that would knock your socks off.\n\nI've spent the majority of my life in a large western Canadian city known for having a large Chinese population and I thought I knew a thing or two about Chinese cuisine until I traveled there and realized that it only scratched the surface.\n\nSure, French, Italian and other European cuisines are amazing, no knock against them, but they are typically what comes to a lot of people's minds when they think of high-end dining. Chinese cuisine is so much more than sweet and sour pork or broccoli beef, and has every right to be as highly regarded as some European cuisines.\n\nAlso \"nose to tail\" cooking \u2013 so many western restaurants pat themselves on the back for making use of every part of an animal. Meanwhile the Chinese (and other Asian countries) have been doing this for centuries.\n\nMaybe I'm preaching to the choir on this thread, but I think Chinese cooking has every right to be up there with European cuisine.\n\nEDIT: It appears that I am very much preaching to the choir here. Still, I stand by my love for Chinese cuisine and hope that food lovers everywhere are able to experience the amazing flavours that are less well-known outside of China.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/othpaw/in_praise_of_chinese_cuisine/", "created_utc": 1627502411.0, "score": 3705, "author": "ToothbrushGames", "num_comments": 817, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/othpaw/in_praise_of_chinese_cuisine/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It's packed full of Tangy, Earthy and Umami flavors, and is really simple to make. Secret ingredient and recipe inside", "selftext": "Rice is the most widely consumed food in the world and frankly it deserves that mantle for its versatility and flavor absorbing properties. While the majority of rice is cooked plain, most cultures have at least one dish where the rice is cooked with a seasoned broth, and that results in extremely flavorful rice that sometimes competes with main dishes for flavor. In the Middle East there are many different rice dishes cooked in this manner, but the one you will probably see the most is Yellow Middle Eastern Rice \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0641\u0631. It pairs amazingly with grilled meats, stews or vegetable dishes and is one of my all time favorite rice dishes. I served my rice with some spatch-cocked baby chickens and [this is how it turned out](https://imgur.com/a/twXigJ4).\n\nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link to the full video recipe](https://youtu.be/6S5oWl2RXJA). I've also left links in the comments to all my previous /r/cooking posts.\n\n## What is Yellow Rice\nThis Yellow rice isn't the only yellow rice that's served in the Middle East, and can easily be confused with [Saffron or Safflower rice](https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Saffron-Rice-5-500x500.jpg). Those rice dishes get their bright yellow color and floral flavor from the [Saffron or Safflower](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1944/9765/articles/Saffron_VS_Safflower_1024x1024.jpg?v=1520984923) they are made with, and while they are both insanely delicious, they aren't the topic of this post (let me know if you want a recipe). The Yellow Rice I am talking about gets it's color from ground turmeric, which if you've ever worked with, you'll know it could stain even the darkest of materials a bright golden color. It's also responsible for giving the rice it's earthy flavor and what can only be described as a mild back of the throat heat, though don't worry this dish is not spicy (unless you want it to be).\n\nThe other key ingredient of this rice is [Black Limes](https://www.finedininglovers.com/sites/g/files/xknfdk626/files/styles/im_landscape_100/public/2020-02/Black-lime_0.jpg?itok=_taVFVtQ) (AKA Limo Omani and Loumi) which are basically the citrus version of Black Garlic. Black limes are an essential spice of the Arabian Gulf kitchen, and are thought to have originated in Oman. They're made by placing small limes in the sun to dehydrate and dry out, which just like with sundried tomatoes results in a concentrated, developed and umami flavor. The limes are used widely throughout the Middle East, but are especially used in Arabian Gulf, Iraqi, and Iranian cuisine. Whether used whole, or crushed into a powder, they add a developed citrus flavor with slight fermented notes to all the dishes they touch. As opposed to fresh limes, they impart a lot less acid and a more well rounded flavor than fresh citrus. In Iran, they are crushed into a powder, and used to add a citrus and light acidic flavor to stews. In Iraq they're added to most dishes as a key flavoring. There's also [dried white limes](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/whole-halved-dried-white-limes-isolated-white-background-whole-halved-dried-white-limes-167143131.jpg) which add a similar flavor to the black limes, the difference between them is usually how long they were left to sun dry. Could you make this rice with the white limes? Probably but I've always had it with the black ones and I can only think the additional drying time just further concentrates the flavor even more. \n\nMaking the rice is quite simple, you saute some diced onion, garlic, chilli, and tomatoes till softened. Add the dried limes, some cloves, bay leaves, and cardamom pods. Then add the rice and cook it with stock. It's a very versatile dish that you can easily customize by adding different vegetables, meat, spices or even nuts to suit your own taste. This version is quite simple but I find it has a flavor that will work well alongside any main dish. \n\n## Cultural Context\n\nThere's not much information that points to the origins of this rice, so instead I want to talk about the Black Limes, a precious commodity of Oman. Historically Oman was a very important trading hub, and was part of the Maritime Silk Road that connected Egypt and the Arabian Gulf to India, China and much of south east Asia. One of the key items traded along the silk road was spices, and it was how the Middle East first got ahold of many of the spices that make up the cuisine these days. Cardamom originated in India, Cloves are native to Indonesia and evidence points to the origins of limes coming from the Arabian gulf or Indonesia. In a country where summer temperatures can reach as high as 46c (120f) it's only natural that sun drying foods would become a common practice, and the Omani's sun dry a lot of foods. Common ingredients in their cuisine include sun dried dates, sun dried shark meat, and of course these sun dried limes. Sun dried foods make for great trading commodities, as they are hardy enough to survive long journeys at sea, and it is through the Maritime silk road that these lemons spread outwards to Asia. The Lemons also made it to Iraq via the port city of Basra, and in Iraq to this day they are known as Noomi Basra (Basra limes).\n\nWhile this recipe is generic and easily adaptable, it's quite closely related to [Kabsa or Machboos](https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.47/gpr.cc9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_20200523_200454-1024x768.jpg) which are the national dishes of many Arabian Gulf countries. Those are made by sauteing meat with the same ingredients as this recipe and adding crushed tomatoes to the dish as it cooks. Once the meat is cooked, it's removed and then rice is added and cooked through before the meat is added back once more. Sometimes nuts and sultanas are added for a sweet and crunchy element that compliments the rice. I wasn't able to find much historical information about the yellow rice, but that's likely because it's such a common preparation method. These days this rice is common all over the Middle East, and while it still has traces of it's Gulf origins, it's not uncommon to find it with added ingredients such as Cinnamon, Meat or herbs. You'll likely be served this rice when you order grilled meat at a Middle Eastern restaurant, and while I haven't tried it, I'm pretty sure this is the same rice served at the Halal guys carts.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nTangy, Earth and Umami, those are the three key flavors of this dish and all three are really noticeable but well balanced. The tangyness comes from the Dried black limes and the fresh lemon juice that is added. They both have different strengths, with the black lime contributing a developed and funky citrus flavor, and the fresh lemon contributing brightness and acidity. The black limes also contribute a lot of Umami flavors, and I suspect that just like with sundried tomatoes, the drying of these limes creates naturally occurring MSG. The earthiness comes from the turmeric, and it's strange how it imparts an almost back of the throat heat, without being spicy at all. It adds a very mellow flavor that I want to describe as golden (even though that makes no sense) as well as the fantastic golden color.\n\nThe Cardamom, Bay Leaves and Cloves I add are all there for some more traditional Arabian flavors. If you wanted to make this dish the longer way, you would create a chicken stock using those spices and then use the stock to season your rice, however I am adding them in directly to the rice as I'm just using a stock cube. Given how short the time is that they are in contact with liquid, they provide a light perfuming of the rice with their flavors rather than a strong sharp flavor, which I find to be really pleasant. The final components of this dish are sauted onions, tomatoes and chilli. They add a bit of a vegetabley flavor that rounds out the dish, and while the onions aren't caramelized, they do impart their delicious oniony flavor to the rice. The chilli will add heat to your rice, and it's up to you how much you use as well as what kind of chilli, but I recommend using something with a medium heat that will not overpower the rest of the dish.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 2 Cups Basmati or Long Grain rice\n* 200ml Concentrated Chicken Stock\n* 3 Garlic Cloves\n* 2 Brown or Spanish Onions\n* 2 Plum Tomatoes\n* 2-3 Black Limes (Loumi)\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 2 Cardamom Pods\n* 2 Cloves\n* 1 Green Chilli (Optional)\n* 4 Tbsp Lemon Juice\n* 2 Tbsp Butter\n* 2 Tbsp Vegetable Oil\n* 1 1/2 Tsp Salt\n* 3/4 Tsp Ground Turmeric\n* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper\n\n## Directions\n\n1. Wash your Basmati rice until the water runs clear. I place it in a mesh strainer in a bowl full of water and massage the grains until all the rice dust and surface starch has come off. I change out the water 2-3 times before setting the rice aside to dry \n2. Peel and dice your Onions to a medium-small dice about 1/2cm or 1/4in cubed you want them to be small enough to disappear into the rice but not completely dissolve\n3. De-seed and dice your tomatoes into small pieces about the same size as your onion\n4. Slice your chilli into small circles, you can remove the seeds if you want less heat\n5. Add your Butter and Oil to a heavy bottomed pot on medium heat\n6. Once melted, add the diced onion, mince the garlic cloves and add in as well\n7. Saute for about 5-7 minutes until the onions have softened and wilted. Do not let the onions brown or caramelize. I would highly recommend stirring every 30 seconds or so.\n8. Add your Green Chilli and diced Tomatoes as well as the Black Limes, Cardamom, Cloves and Bay Leaves. Mix well and saute for 3-5 minutes\n9. Once the tomatoes have softened add the Salt, Black Pepper, and Turmeric. Add the now dried rice in and stir to combine\n10. Add your lemon juice to the pot, then add enough stock to just barely cover the rice (don't do the whole knuckle above thing as that will cause it to come out mushy). It's fine if a few grains of rice are just above the surface of the water. Top up the pot with water if the stock is not enough\n11. Turn the heat up to high and bring the pot to a boil. As soon as it boils cover with a tight fitting lid and turn the heat down to your second lowest setting. Allow it to steam for about 20 minutes\n12. When 20 minutes are up, remove the lid, the water should have fully evaporated. If not allow it to steam for a few minutes more. Once evaporated, fluff your rice up with a fork. Place the lid back on and allow it to simmer for 2 more minutes\n13. When the 2 minutes are up your rice is ready to be served\n\n## Notes and Tips\n* If you must, you can make this rice without black limes, by dehydrating some regular limes in your oven for at least 6-12 hours. I haven't tested this, but I think it will allow some of the same flavor compounds to develop, just like the homemade black garlic process\n* You can buy Black Limes at any Middle Eastern grocery store and they are also carried at some indian grocery stores too. If not, order them online, I haven't found them on Penzey's but I've seen them on amazon\n* If you are making a stock, add the spices to the stock when it's cooking so they have longer to infuse\n* Cooking time and the amount of water is accurate for basmati rice, but if you are doing any other kind, then you should add as much water as you regularly use and cook for the same amount of time you usually do\n* You HAVE to wash your rice, I get that Adam Ragusea said it's not that important the other day, but you HAVE TO wash basmati rice and here's why. Basmati Rice is delicate and easily breaks, no matter how well you package it, the rice will form a thin film of rice dust on every grain, and if you don't wash it off your rice will have a grainy texture. Another reason is that you want the rice to get super fluffy, if you don't wash basmati, you aren't removing the surface starches and your rice will come out clumpy\n* You can use 4 TBSP of either Butter or Oil, I use half of each because the butter gives a nicer flavor to the rice, and the oil gives it a nicer texture", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jkc44k/yellow_rice_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0641\u0631_is_an_iconic_middle/", "created_utc": 1603985286.0, "score": 3605, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 273, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jkc44k/yellow_rice_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632_\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0641\u0631_is_an_iconic_middle/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "With pumpkin season in full swing, let me introduce you to an alternative to pumpkin pie; Egyptian Pumpkin Casserole. Soft pumpkin pieces topped with a sweet and luscious vanilla bean bechamel. Recipe inside", "selftext": "If you're looking for a new pumpkin dish to try, then you can't go wrong with this dessert. It's got an insanely pleasing texture and flavor with the richness of the bechamel working perfectly with the perfectly cooked pumpkin pieces. I'm not a fan of mashed pumpkin, so if like me you prefer a more solid texture, then I am sure you'll love this. As usual [here are pictures of the final dish](https://imgur.com/a/Pw6FWPj) and if you want to check out my [full video recpe, it's here](https://youtu.be/yOdgMSRe6dk).\n\n## What is a Pumpkin and sweet Bechamel casserole\nThis Egyptian dish is an extremely simple and satisfying dessert that takes full advantage of the insane flavor that pumpkin provides. It's composed of tender cooked pumpkin pieces, that are topped with a creamy bechamel that is usually flavored with vanilla. Baking the assembled dish adds an amazing layer to the top of the bechamel and helps it set up nicely. It's a bit of an old school dessert and has become quite rare to find and is now mostly cooked by family matriarchs. I think it's worth teaching you about it before it disappears. It's really quite simple to make and doesn't require much active time at all, but best of all it can be eaten hot or cold and it will taste/feel like two different dishes. \n\nI was never a fan of pumpkin desserts but when my mother in law first made this for me, I was instantly converted. There are a number of steps she takes that instantly level up the dessert from a simple casserole/pudding and give it a better texture and more complex layered flavor. Firstly, if you boil the pumpkin from raw it will take about 30 minutes for it to fully cook and release it's liquids. By the time that happens, the pumpkin will be so soft that it will turn to mash and while it will still taste good, the dish will be lacking in texture since you'll have two creamy layered textures. The solution to this is to macerate your pumpkin overnight, which will draw out all of the liquid, and will reduce the cooking time to about 10 minutes. This way your pumpkin will be fork tender, but not a fall apart or mashed texture, and once layered with the bechamel it will contrast nicely. The second tip is to incorporate the liquid extracted from the pumpkin during maceration into your bechamel, which will give an amazing pumpkin flavor to your bechamel as well. For some reason the standard flavoring in this is vanilla or vanillin, which works really well, but I could see this tasting great if you added the usual pumpkin spices of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. \n\n## Cultural Context\nPumpkins are a new world crop that originated in Mexico over 7500 years ago. They have been an integral part of ancient Mexican cuisine for millennia, and are fashioned into foods and desserts of all sorts. Because of their hardiness and ability to easily survive a seafaring journey, they were one of the first crops to make it back to the old world. Pumpkins spread fairly quickly through the ottoman empire, and all sorts of dishes were made with the flesh of pumpkins, from soups and savory casseroles to desserts. One notable dish was an Ottoman recipe for [macerated pumpkin with walnut](https://www.196flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kabak-tatl%C4%B1s%C4%B1-1.jpeg) (Kabak Tatlisi), this was a simple preparation of macerating pumpkin, par cooking it, then serving it with it's own macerated syrup and chopped walnuts or sometimes clotted cream. \n\nThe origins of this dish in Egyptian cuisine are unclear and no one really knows when it came about, but the theory is that it's from at least the 1800s. This is based on it's popularity as a dish amongst older generations of Egyptians who grew up eating it in their childhoods and were fed it by their own parents. Egyptian cuisine has always been subject to a lot of external influences, as Cairo and Alexandria were homes to thousands of Greek, Italian, French and British families during this period. Given how bechamel is a French invention, it's possible that the dish came about by adapting the ottoman macerated pumpkin, and topping it with a creamy sweet bechamel.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nThere's only a few ingredients in this dish but when combined together they make a well layered dish. The strongest flavor in this dish is that of the pumpkin, which obviously comes from the pumpkin pieces, but is also incorporated into the bechamel. The dessert is well balanced in terms of sweetness, with neither the cooked pumpkin or the bechamel tasting overly sweet. Adding vanilla to the pumpkin and the bechamel gives it a great vanilla background flavor. The final flavoring is that of the bechamel, which has a rich and creamy flavoring with a buttery flavor and when sweetened tastes quite similar to a fresh custard.\n\nApart from flavors, this dish also scores highly in terms of texture. You have three distinct textures here, first you have the tender pieces of pumpkin that form up the base of the dish. Because these are added whole rather than mashed, they have just the slightest amount of bite and textural resistance. It contrasts nicely with the texture of the bechamel, which when warm has a smooth and silky texture that coats the whole of your mouth. The third and final texture comes from the top layer of the bechamel, which forms a bubble baked skin and crisps us slightly, it's really delicate but I feel it's essential for the complete experience.\n\n\n## Ingredients\nThis is the quantities for a medium baking dish about 8*12in or 20*30cm. The dish also needs to be a little deep\n\n* 2 - 2.5kg (4.5 - 5.5lb) of fresh Pumpkin. It will weigh about 1.6 - 2kg (3.5 - 4.5lb) once peeled and de-seeded, I recommend a Jarrahdale or pie pumpkin for their texture and flavor\n* 400 - 500g (14 - 17.5oz) Sugar. 1/4 of the cleaned pumpkins weight.\n* 100g (10 Tbsp) All purpose flour\n* 135g (10 Tbsp) Butter\n* 400ml (13.2 fl oz) Whole milk\n* 200ml (6.6 fl oz) Heavy cream (or double cream)\n* 500ml (16.5 fl oz) Pumpkin liquid (this will come out of macerating the pumpkin\n* 1 Vanilla bean (or substitute with 2 teaspoons vanillin or vanilla extract)\n\n## Directions\n\n### To macerate the Pumpkin:\n1. Peel and de-core your pumpkin and cut into bite sized pieces about 2.5cm * 2.5cm (1 in * 1 in). Make sure to remove all of the mush from the center or it will affect the final texture\n2. Weigh your pumpkin pieces and calculate 1/4 of their weight, that's how much sugar you will need to add\n3. Add the sugar to the pumpkin in a bowl and toss well to ensure they are evenly coated. Make sure every piece is completely coated in sugar\n4. Leave the bowl with the pumpkin on your counter overnight and the sugar will draw out the liquid from the pieces\n\n### To cook the Pumpkin:\n1. Add the pumpkin pieces and their liquid into a large pot\n2. De-seed your vanilla bean and add the empty shell of the bean to the pot as well (use 1 teaspoon of your vanilla alternative if you aren't using a bean)\n3. Place the pot on medium high heat and bring up to a simmer\n4. Cook for about 10-15 minutes until the pumpkin pieces are fork tender, do not overcook them till they get mushy\n5. Strain them using a colander and reserve 500ml of their liquid they boiled in\n\n### To cook the bechamel:\n1. Melt the butter in the same pot that you cooked the pumpkin in\n2. Once fully melted, toss in the flour and mix to combine\n3. Cook the flour and butter together for 3-4 minutes until it forms a liquid and saucy consistency\n4. Pour in a small amount of your milk (about 1/8th ) of the total amount and mix it into the flour, it will seize up and form a dough\n5. Once the milk is fully incorporated, add a 1/4 of the remaining milk to the bechamel and work it in\n6. Next add a 1/4 of the measured out Pumpkin syrup (if your syrup is less than 500ml, then just increase the milk to the remaining amount) and mix in well until it has been fully incorporated\n7. Continue alternating between the milk and pumpkin syrup until both have finished and a bechamel has formed with a custard like texture\n8. Pour in the cream and combine it well with the bechamel until smooth and creamy\n9. Add the vanilla seeds and mix in well\n\n### To assemble:\n1. Place your drained pumpkin pieces in the bottom of a deep baking dish in a single even layer. Don't smush them just gently press them into an even layer, you want the pieces to remain intact.\n2. Smooth the top of the pumpkin so there are no gaps, then top it with the bechamel you made. Don't scrape out any bechamel which has stuck to the bottom of the pot\n3. Use a spatula to flatten the top layer and smoothen it out until level\n4. Bake in a 180c (350f) oven for 45 - 60 minutes until golden brown on top and bubbly. A thin skin should have formed.\n5. Remove and let it cool for a minimum of 30 minutes before serving", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/jg0i6y/with_pumpkin_season_in_full_swing_let_me/", "created_utc": 1603376422.0, "score": 3468, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 271, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/jg0i6y/with_pumpkin_season_in_full_swing_let_me/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Hey everyone, here in France, on the 2nd of February we celebrate \"La Chandeleur\" (Candlemas), where it's traditional to eat cr\u00eapes for an entire day so I wanted to share my family's recipe so you guys can celebrate too!", "selftext": "As well as being delicious, this cr\u00eape batter is superior to other batters because you don't need to let it rest before making cr\u00eapes and you don't need to butter the pan between each cr\u00eape.\n\nIf you're interested, I've made a whole video on the history of Candlemas and how to make cr\u00eapes, which you can checkout here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddqvAM1AAyg&lc=UgyCNeDz5CfXh2VRW7p4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddqvAM1AAyg&lc=UgyCNeDz5CfXh2VRW7p4AaABAg)\n\nOtherwise, here is the recipe.\n\nFor 24 cr\u00eapes, you will need:\n\n\\- 250g of All Purpose White Flour (0.55 lbs)\n\n\\- 60g of Butter (2.1 oz)\n\n\\- 5g of Salt (0.2oz)\n\n\\- 6 Whole Eggs\n\n\\- 600ml of Milk (2.5 cups)\n\n\\- 4tbsp of Water\n\n\\- 4tsp of a Strong Liquor (such as Cognac or a Dark Rum)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(The original recipe asked for twice as much salt but that was too much. If the cr\u00eapes feel bland, add a pinch of salt.)\n\n1. Heat your milk on a medium-low stove up until it's just about to boil. Do not let it boil as milk spills over very easily.\n2. While your milk is heating, put your flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the middle, break your eggs into it, and whisk them together. When the flour and eggs are well combined, add the water, salt, and liquor, and whisk again.\n3. When your milk is warm enough, take it off the stove, add the butter and mix them together. When the butter is melted, slowly pour it into your batter while vigorously whisking the batter as to avoid forming lumps.\n\nVoil\u00e0! Your dough is now ready. As I've said before, you can immediately use it to make cr\u00eapes, which are a great and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.\n\nTo make a nice cr\u00eape, take a shallow and wide pan (22 cm/8.5 inches) and put it on high heat. Put some butter in the pan and once it's melted, grease the whole pan with a piece of paper. You only need to butter the pan for its first cr\u00eape.   When the pan is nice and hot, take your batter, whisk it again to mix incorporate any flour that fell to the bottom (I recommend doing that regularly), take a large scoop of batter and pour it onto your warm pan. Spread it evenly, let it stick a second or two, and then pour any excess batter back into the bowl.\n\nLet the cr\u00eape cook for a couple of minutes. Once the cr\u00eape sticks off by itself, you can flip it. I recommend just picking it up with your fingers for that. Let it cook for a minute or two on the other side and enjoy it warm with any spread you like.\n\nAs a topping, I strongly recommend trying out \"Cr\u00e8me de Marron\" or brown sugar with lemon.\n\nBon app\u00e9tit!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope you give these a try. They are tasty, easy and fun to make and you can put any toppings you like on them so it's really a great way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/aksqgu/hey_everyone_here_in_france_on_the_2nd_of/", "created_utc": 1548713159.0, "score": 3455, "author": "None", "num_comments": 244, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/aksqgu/hey_everyone_here_in_france_on_the_2nd_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I made dumplings from scratch for the first time today and it was an emotional experience", "selftext": "This is a long story.\n\nI'm a first generation Chinese-Canadian. My mom was a single mom and we had a terrible relationship growing up. Won't get into it but it was not good. One positive thing about my childhood was the food.\n\nMy mom is a great cook. She's traditional but also experimental and she used every part of the animal/vegetable (we ate pig's feet and pickled watermelon rinds and we made dumplings) and she made everything from scratch. I loved her food until it started to bring me shame, probably around the age of 6 or 7. Kids at school made fun of my lunches so I started asking my mom for Lunchables. This continued into high school when a friend of mine was at my house and saw me eating pork dumplings and she pointed out that the insides were a little pink so she assumed they were raw. She went and told everyone that I ate raw pork and for the next few days, people were coming up to me telling me I was gross because I ate raw animals. That was one of many, many experiences I had growing up and it just added to the hell that was my pubescent years. It was normal for white kids to call me ch\\*nk in the hallways every day, for girls to tell me they were gonna beat me up if I didn't leave my hair black, guys would call me fat every day. I just had a miserable childhood and I was conditioned to believe that being Chinese was inhuman.\n\nSo needless to say, I had developed an aversion to my cultural heritage and I distanced myself in every way possible. All I wanted was Hamburger Helper and Chef Boyardee because it was what my friends ate (I've still never had the former because my mom refused to buy HH) and when I did start learning how to cook as a teenager, I refused to learn techniques from my mom. I watched Emeril and Batalli and perfected risotto and homemade tomato sauce, long before I ever learned how to properly wrap a dumpling.\n\nBut I always helped with dumplings. Like I said, it was just us. So whenever my mom made dumplings, I was there by her side. She would always let me wrap a few just for fun. She knew I sucked at it. I always put in way too much filling and they always unravelled in the water because they were never tight enough. But this was something we did together that wasn't consumed by violence and pain.\n\nFast forward to today. I'm 33 and I've spent the last few years unlearning all the shame I harboured as a child. And on this journey, I'm also trying to learn how to cook my favorite meals that my mom made for us and other really great dishes I had when I was in China visiting family. I don't have the same intuition with Chinese food that I do with other cuisines because I spent such a large portion of my life pretending to not love it. But I'm trying.\n\nSo today I made my own dough from scratch along with my filling. I used the same ingredients that my mom used and like her, I eyeballed everything. The filling wasn't great; I was a little too heavy handed with the soy sauce so it's a little one-note (but the dough was delicious though). Anyway, while I was wrapping the dumplings, my boyfriend came along to see how I was doing and I asked if he wanted to wrap one, which he did with boyish excitement. It was flat and kind of ugly, the way that mine used to look as a child. But it filled me with so much joy and pride.\n\nAnd he was so happy about it too and he was so happy for me that I was attempting to make something I loved. Watching him in the same role that I was in started making me teary-eyed because it made me recollect the few happy memories I had with my mom and also, it made me really appreciative that I'm with someone who loves me for me (and all my trauma), and not only that, but wants to learn with me and engage in parts of my cultural heritage that I had suppressed. I was just flooded with emotion and pride and happiness. I was really happy that I got to share something of my past with him.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this experience today. I hope if anyone else feels like they're in a position where they're being marginalized or bullied for being different, just know that those people are assholes. I know as an adult that all the hate that was ever spewed towards me was a reflection of others and not me.\n\nTDLR; I was bullied as a kid for being Chinese. I made dumplings for the first time today and my boyfriend was excited to make dumplings with me. It made me emotional and happy and proud to be Chinese.\n\nEDIT: If you made it to the end, thank you for reading :) I want to thank EVERYONE for their wonderful responses. I cannot express how much it means to me. To this day, I don't know any Asian people other than my parents, so it's a wonderful feeling to feel connected to people who have shared similar experiences.

If you're boiling potatoes for mashed potatoes for example it's not going to matter. It's more of an issue of timing (more predicable if you put food into a known temperature), and for the oven in particular it may be beneficial to start with a hot oven.

{"title": "Carbonara, here in Italy. Original and modified version", "selftext": "Hi all! I'm a 24 years old dude from Italy.\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so I'll try my best!  \nIn Italy, practically all love carbonara. Firstly, a premise: your own recipe is your own. Maybe it's not how carbonara is made here, but if you like it, do it. I myself am a little too purist when it comes to food, but I find useless criticizING imitations and variations of my food culture in foreign nations. I like eating sushi here in Italy, but I'm totally aware that probably (well, for sure) that's not the \"real\" sushi. I still like it. Now, carbonara!  \n\n\nMany people do it wrong. Carbonara doesn't need cream, parsley, onions, et cetera. It needs a few things, but of high quality.   \nThe following recipe is just an example, since the \"real\" recipe doesn't really exists, just slight variations of it based on the chef, and considering only traditional ones. Beware, you may find the recipe too strong, too sapid. That's the carbonara, no escape: the traditional recipe is harsh to the palate, and beautifully brutal.  \n\n\n***\"TRADITIONAL CARBONARA\"***\n\nFor a single dose:  \n\u2713 30-35 grams of Pecorino Romano  \n\u2713 Pasta: paccheri, maccheroni or similar, 100 grams  \n\u2713 Guanciale, 50-60 grams, to be cooked in an iron pan  \n\u2713 Egg yolks, 2 medium sized (if you do multiple doses, it's 2 yolks/person + 1 more at the end, more or less. Depends)  \n\u2713 Pepper in grains   \n\n\n**Pecorino romano**  \nIt's a famous cheese in Italy, obtained exclusively from whole and fresh sheep's milk. The name itself is a diminutive of \"Pecora\", which in italian means sheep. Romano means \"from Rome\", but this cheese is actually mostly produced in Sardinia.   \n[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino\\_Romano](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino_Romano) \n\nThis is a strong cheese, sapid, aged. You can get it from Italy i believe, since it's an aged  cheese, without problems.  \n\n\n**Guanciale**  \n\"Guancia\" in italian means \"cheek\". In fact, it's the cheek of the pork: the traditional carbonara doesn't use bacon, because it's too strong, especially combined with Pecorino romano. Guanciale is a fatty meat, has to be sliced in strips. I don't know if and where you can get this from another nation.  \n[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanciale\\_di\\_maiale](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanciale_di_maiale)\n\n**Pasta**  \nThe famous recipe \"Spaghetti alla carbonara\" tells a little lie about it: no spaghetti. Traditionally, short formats of pasta are used for it. But that's a minor issue, you can use what you want: just be aware that the higher the quantity, the harder to mix it if you are using long types of pasta.  \n[https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paccheri](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paccheri)\n\n**Egg yolks**  \nI believe I don't need to explain here, chickens are everywhere :D  \n\n\n**Pepper in grains**  \nJust a common type of pepper is alright.   \n\n\nIt's better not to use the white of the egg: it contains albumine, which has a lower coagulating temperature than the yolk. It will be harder to avoid the \"omeletted\" carbonara. You can avoid this anyway with a bain marie, but you'll get a perfect result with the yolks alone, so why risking it?  \nAvoid using bacon+pecorino: it's just too strong to the palate.  \nIt would be better to use safe, purchased eggs, since they will basically stay raw.  \n\n\nOk, let's go!  \n1) Boil water, when it's boiling, add a little salt (trust me. The dish is salty enough). Buttare la pasta! (put the pasta in the boiling water :D)  \n2) Toast the pepper grains until you smell its flavor, then proceed to chop it to a fine consistency  \n3) Put the yolks in a bowl, add the Pecorino, mix them. It will result very dense, sticky to the fork. Add the toasted pepper. Don't add cream or other blasphemies, it will melt later.   \n4) Put the guanciale in a *cold* pan. Start cooking it at low heat, it will slowly melt away its fat. If you cook it at high heat, it will become like rubber.   \n5) You can add all the derived fat to the yolk+pecorino, but it's unhealthy. I tend to take just 1/3 of the fat and add it. Take the guanciale, and stir it with something absorbent. It will stay crispy. Chop some of the guanciale, to decor.  \n6) Now the big moment: we have a cooked pasta (al dente!

{"title": "Food Became Hot in Fridge??", "selftext": "I just experienced one of the weirdest things ever. I took some chicken soup out of the freezer the other day. I went to take it out of the fridge to cook for dinner, and I noticed that it felt...warm. Like, really warm. It felt as if it had been in the microwave. I was so stunned I even pulled out a meat thermometer to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and it registered 115 degrees F!!! I frantically felt around in my fridge to make sure something wasn't weird with it, and it's definitely cold everywhere in the fridge and all other food in the fridge feels as cold as it should be.\n\nHas this ever happened to anyone before??? Does anyone know what would cause this? Needless to say I threw it out.\n\nUPDATE for those who haven't seen my comment below: The mystery has been solved. It was the explanation we thought all along (my wife heated it up, put it back, and then when I asked her about it she, trying to be funny, said \"what no of course not?\") and I will be filing for divorce in the morning. How do we think the judge will react to \"I was going to tell you but then it escalated really quickly when you started posting on the internet and calling family members to see if they could explain it.\"\n\nEdit: Yes I'm just joking---I am not actually divorcing my wife over hot soup but I am also not happy about spending two hours frantically looking like a fool on the internet when I could have been relaxing after work!\n\nUpdate #2: Since some people seem to think I am in a horrible relationship, here is the more detailed explanation: My wife went to heat up some soup for dinner. Since she had been binging on Easter candy since she got home, upon heating up said soup, she decided she actually wasn't that hungry, so she put it back in the fridge. When I went to heat it up for dinner a bit later, I noticed it was warm as if it had been heated. I asked my wife if she heated it up and put it back, and she told me \"no\" so I believed her. What I don't think she expected was for me to be so beyond befuddled WHY there was hot soup in the fridge that should be cold, she was shocked when I started asking the internet/calling people I know to see if they could possibly explain this thermodynamic mystery. She said it was funny at first but it got out of hand very quickly---she didn't know I would be so concerned about this. She also told me \"You asked me if I MICROWAVED the soup and I didn't---it was on the stove, so I didn't TECHNICALLY lie\" so I have to give her points for that.

If the cr\u00eapes feel bland, add a pinch of salt.)\n\n1. Heat your milk on a medium-low stove up until it's just about to boil. Do not let it boil as milk spills over very easily.\n2. While your milk is heating, put your flour in a large bowl, make a hole in the middle, break your eggs into it, and whisk them together. When the flour and eggs are well combined, add the water, salt, and liquor, and whisk again.\n3. When your milk is warm enough, take it off the stove, add the butter and mix them together. When the butter is melted, slowly pour it into your batter while vigorously whisking the batter as to avoid forming lumps.\n\nVoil\u00e0! Your dough is now ready. As I've said before, you can immediately use it to make cr\u00eapes, which are a great and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.\n\nTo make a nice cr\u00eape, take a shallow and wide pan (22 cm/8.5 inches) and put it on high heat. Put some butter in the pan and once it's melted, grease the whole pan with a piece of paper. You only need to butter the pan for its first cr\u00eape.   When the pan is nice and hot, take your batter, whisk it again to mix incorporate any flour that fell to the bottom (I recommend doing that regularly), take a large scoop of batter and pour it onto your warm pan. Spread it evenly, let it stick a second or two, and then pour any excess batter back into the bowl.\n\nLet the cr\u00eape cook for a couple of minutes. Once the cr\u00eape sticks off by itself, you can flip it. I recommend just picking it up with your fingers for that. Let it cook for a minute or two on the other side and enjoy it warm with any spread you like.\n\nAs a topping, I strongly recommend trying out \"Cr\u00e8me de Marron\" or brown sugar with lemon.\n\nBon app\u00e9tit!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope you give these a try. They are tasty, easy and fun to make and you can put any toppings you like on them so it's really a great way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/euu8ky/hey_everyone_here_in_france_on_the_2nd_of/", "created_utc": 1580158444.0, "score": 3196, "author": "None", "num_comments": 327, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/euu8ky/hey_everyone_here_in_france_on_the_2nd_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Warning - Wash your eggs if they come directly from a farm", "selftext": "TL;DR: We source eggs directly from a farmer CSA and the eggs are not washed like what you get from a supermarket.  My wife handled a bunch of them when she made us breakfast.  She didn't  wash her hands (we think) after handling the shells (which often have trace amounts of chicken poo on them).  She got a (likely) salmonella infection that caused her to aspirate vomit and now she's two weeks into a case of bacterial pneumonia requiring a trip to the ER and urgent care.  She's doing very well now.  The eggs were delicious.\n\n**Added note from all the comments and DMs**: Yes, you should always wash your hands after handling/cracking eggs, regardless of if they're supermarket or farm sourced, or in the USA or elsewhere.  We're usually pretty good about these things, but everyone makes a mistake...but you shouldn't, or the story below is what *could* happen.  Really, I should have titles this, \"Wash anything that comes in contact with raw eggs, especially if they're unwashed eggs\".\n\nWe're not defending *not* always washing our hands after handling eggs, BUT I don't think we're unique in that we don't always do it with supermarket eggs, since they're (in the USA) washed.  Again, you definitely **should** wash your hands no matter what.  That's the point and the lesson from this whole thing.  It's just especially important if you have eggs that are sourced a bit closer to the source of production...i.e. the ~~guess what~~ Chicken's butt :). It's worth noting, the farmer we get ours from generally provides spotless eggs.  They don't wash, but they do clean them and candle them.  That said, there's still sometimes small spots of dried dirt/poop.  It doesn't bother us, and I've had that happen from multiple non-factory producers, but for chicken and duck eggs.  I've been buying eggs from farmers directly for probably 10 years, and this is the first incident I can really remember.\n\nLastly, we didn't get any cultures done for my wife.  The Urgent Care Dr offered it, but essentially said (this is a paraphrase), \"I'm going to give you a bunch of antibiotics either way, since the Xray tech thinks it's bacterial in nature, and you're in bad enough shape that it's worth the precaution.\"\n\n-----------------\n\nI'm lucky that where we live (Wisconsin) we have access to tremendous amounts of high quality local agriculture. My wife and I have followed strict COVID guidelines, and we're lucky enough to be able to work from home full time.  Likewise, we're fortunate enough to be able to prioritize where we source much of our food from.\n\nTo that end, we've been patronizing a local producer of poultry products.  I really can't say anything bad about them, and the quality and taste of their products is top notch, and we will continue buying their products.\n\nHowever, we will be more cautious around handling eggs from them (and the same goes for any small-scale producer).  We frequently receive eggs that have *chicken dirt* adhered to the shells.  We're fairly confident that my wife handled some of these eggs, without washing them, and that lead to her salmonella infection and now pneumonia.\n\nI'm also guilty of handling these eggs without washing the shell, and in my own kitchen I'm very likely to forget to wash afterward.  My wife is no dummy, but when you're caught up trying to get breakfast made, it's really easy to forget.  And, if you grew up using super market eggs (both of us did), it's probably never been a real concern.\n\nWe're fairly confident that this was the source of her infection, because we've been eating the same meals since...the before times (or when we order carry out).\n\nSo, this seems obvious, right?  Well here's how her situation unfolded, just to reinforce how important food safety is.\n\n16 days ago she made us eggs, bagels and lox for breakfast, with said farm eggs.  It was delicious.\n\n\n14 days ago: Her stomach was giving her trouble, it got worse as the day went on.\n\n\n13 days ago she was vomiting once an hour, and had terrible diarrhea.  She was trying to stay hydrated by was struggling even to keep water down.  She didn't yet want to go to ER or UC.\n\n12 days ago, in the evening, she had a fever (101F).  She still didn't want to go to ER/UC because she was responding well to Tylenol and drug-store anti-nausea drugs, that was until 9:00pm.  She couldn't understand what I was saying to her and seemed confused. Her color was super pale and whenever I tried to get her to drink she refused it.  I was terrified, so I took her to the ER.  \n\nBy this point she wasn't coughing yet, but she'd probably vomited 30 times in the prior 48 hours and couldn't sleep for more than an hour.\n\nThe ER pumped 3L of fluids into her before she had to urinate.  They gave her stronger anti-nausea drugs, but told her that it was probably Norovirus or gastritis and to buy some pedilyte and if she couldn't keep it down after taking the anti-nausea drugs, to come back.\n\n10 days ago: Now she was coughing really badly, and I could hear gurgling when she exhaled.  The coughing got really bad the day after the ER trip.  This was the kind of coughing spells that lead to her almost passing out.  \n\nHer fever was asserting itself faster than before (drugs worked for 2-3 hours instead of 4-5). I randomly took her pulse (I actually put my Apple Watch on her) and it was anywhere from 120-140bpm laying in bed.  To me, that screamed pneumonia or something really serious.\n\nShe didn't want to go to the ER, so we went to urgent care because the wait was only 20 minutes.\n\nAfter 5 hours of tests, 2L of fluids, an EKG, and an Xray, they were very confident that she had pneumonia (after they ruled out a blood clot and COVID), and the Xray tech was pretty confident it was bacterial, likely from aspirating vomit, given her symptoms.  The figured she either had a really bad Norovirus infection, but given our shared diets and close contact, it was weird I hadn't gotten it, if it was Norovirus.  The Dr hypothesized that it was salmonella or E. coli then.  She got prescriptions for a beefed up anti-nausea drug, cough suppressant, a rescue inhaler, amoxicillin and azithromycin.  \n\nToday is the last dose of antibiotics, and she's doing well, but gets winded incredibly easily.  She's back working, and can walk around and is definitely improving each day...but it's been a nasty journey.  \n\nShe missed 6 days of work.\n\nSo, to summarize: wash your eggs and don't skimp on food safety!  Also, just to note, wife is otherwise healthy and lacks any kind of medical issue that would make her more susceptible to these ailments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/m5ns4r/warning_wash_your_eggs_if_they_come_directly_from/", "created_utc": 1615823700.0, "score": 3177, "author": "waubers", "num_comments": 470, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/m5ns4r/warning_wash_your_eggs_if_they_come_directly_from/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "I think a lot of social media cooks mislead home cooks (rant)", "selftext": "I've noticed a few issues with social media chefs that make popular cooking content (things like Youtube channels, Tiktok videos, etc). Their content obviously has an entertainment aspect, not just an educational one, so maybe my expectations are too high, but I still think they mislead home cooks on a few things:\n\n# They mislead people into thinking home cooking always involves a lot of effort.\n\nMost people think that \"cooking\" is when you find a recipe that looks good, go to the supermarket to get all the ingredients (most of which you didn't have, and will have to buy in a quantity much larger than you need), end up spending $200, go home and spend all day following a bunch of effortful steps which dirties all of your cookware, spend an hour and a half cleaning your kitchen and washing dishes, and then end up wasting most of the food you cooked because it wasn't friendly to being turned into leftovers. You just spent a lot of time, money, and effort, and don't have much to show for it.\n\nI believe that home cooking (I'm talking about typical weeknight cooking) necessarily involves reducing the amount of effort required to prepare your meals, to make cooking less of a strain on your life and to increase the likelihood that you'll continue to cook for yourself instead of giving up and eating out. This means that you should try to buy the least amount of stuff as you can at the supermarket, you should alter the shopping list (or the dish you are making) to suit what you already have in your kitchen and to suit your skills, you should try to only buy large quantities for things you are certain you'll reuse, you should prefer dishes and techniques that reduce the amount of cookware you'll get dirty and the amount of time you'll spend in the kitchen, and you should try to make things that are friendly to being turned into leftovers so that you can spread out your cooking cost/effort over a few nights.\n\nI think that this is the reason that that oven feta pasta dish went viral: all of a sudden there was a social media recipe that was easy, and it showed people that cooking can be easy and low effort, which genuinely surprised people. I want to tell those people that all cooking can be easy and low effort, _if you specifically cater your home cooking habits to only make dishes that are easy and low effort_. If it is going to be too much effort, or not produce good leftovers, then it's probably not worth your time.\n\nAll of this applies to typical weeknight cooking. But if it's date night, go all out.\n\n# They mislead people into thinking that anything you make at home will be better than storebought.\n\nHome-cooked food is _generally_ much better than food you would get from a restaurant. But the specific recipe which made me think of this point was [a recipe for barbecue potato chips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy8XTQzLRZ0). The last thing he says in the video is how \"everything home made is just better\". \n\nPlease for the love of God don't make barbecue potato chips at home when you can go to the corner store and buy a massive bag for a few dollars. First of all, you won't be able to beat Lays' economy of scale, meaning you'll end up spending a much higher amount of effort and money per chip than they will. You'll need to buy potatoes at a much higher price than they do, then you'll need to buy a mandolin (which most home cooks don't have), then you'll need to deep fry in small batches (because you don't have a large frying vessel). You'll need to produce a large quantity to make any of this worth the cost, time, and effort (and because who only eats a few chips), so be prepared to be frying small batches for a couple hours. And then, by the time that all of this is over, the odds that you will have prepared a better barbecue chip than Lays or any other company is close to 0. Why? Because they have food scientists and industrial chefs at work perfecting every step of the recipe and cooking process. They have been making chips for years. They have access to ingredients (like MSG) and equipment (like large fryers) that you probably don't. They use industrial equipment and quality control which ensures consistency (your chips will likely have inconsistent thickness, cooking times, and seasoning amount). And who knows what else they have access to that you just don't have access to at home.\n\nThe statement how \"everything home made is just better\" might make people think that if you want to truly experience barbecue potato chips, you need to make them yourself, and that that's what home cooking is. I believe that this will lead people to walk into the trap I described above, and begin to resent home cooking. Home cooking should be sustainable so that you are more likely to continue to do it. Making potato chips is not sustainable. Just buy a big bag for a couple dollars and move on with your life.\n\n# They mislead people into thinking that fast food is pointless (or any food made at large scale).\n\nI see lots of recipes that promise to remake fast food recipes at home, but better. Of course if you make a Big Mac at home, it will be better than a Big Mac you buy at McDonalds. This is because you are only making a single Big Mac. McDonalds makes millions of them every single day. The problems that you two are facing are very different. The problems that you are facing in your home kitchen are: where can I get a pound of ground beef, where can I get some mayo for the sauce, etc. The problems McDonalds is facing is: where can I get MILLIONS of pounds of ground beef every single day, how can I get it shipped in refrigerated trucks to the hamburger factory, how do I deal with shipping schedules, health insurance for employees, international law and food safety regulations, worker training materials to ensure each hamburger is made the same way, middle management, etc etc. \n\nThe difference here is _scale_. Your hamburger is better than the Big Mac cause you didn't have to make millions of them internationally every single day. In fact, it's impossible to make a hamburger as good as the one you just made a million times, internationally, every single day. If you believe that it's possible, I invite you to try. \"Scale\" is a very difficult problem, and is basically the main problem that large food chains face. As you scale up from one delicious homemade hamburger to millions of fast food hamburgers, you have to make sacrifices. There may be ingredients that you simply cannot get at that scale. You will need to alter your recipe to introduce shelf stabilizers, preservatives, etc. All of these are actions you must take, not to make a more delicious hamburger, but to operate at a larger scale.\n\nHere is my point: nobody buys fast food because it is the tastiest version of that item. People buy fast food because it is fast, relatively cheap, and easy. Making a tastier version of fast food is low hanging fruit. The miracle of fast food is their scale, not their quality. Make a Big Mac inspired burger at home if you want. It will be delicious, and hamburgers are relatively easy to make at home. But also feel free to continue to buy Big Macs from McDonald's without judgement.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/njyvii/i_think_a_lot_of_social_media_cooks_mislead_home/", "created_utc": 1621865473.0, "score": 3169, "author": "TholomewP", "num_comments": 879, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/njyvii/i_think_a_lot_of_social_media_cooks_mislead_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Basic Techniques: How to Make Any Chinese Stir Fry (\u5c0f\u7092\u57fa\u7840)", "selftext": "Today, I wanted to take a break from recipes, and show you some basic stir-fry technique.\n\nI\u2019m often asked for stuff like \u201ca stir-fry formula\u201d or \u201cstir-fry sauces\u201d, and to some extent I think it belies a fundamental misunderstanding of what a \u2018stir-fry\u2019 is, at its core. If you go on some recipe websites they\u2019ll list out shit like \u201c7 QUICK AND EASY STIR FRY SAUCES\u201d \u2013 you know, \u2018mix together lime and fish sauce for a Thai stir-fry\u2019 or \u2018for a Sichuan flavor profile, use Sichuan peppercorns and chili oil\u2019. The fundamental technique they tend to use is \u201ccube some chicken, fry it, add the sauce, let it simmer in the sauce until thickened\u2019. And I mean\u2026 if you\u2019re happy with that, that\u2019s fine. I ain\u2019t judging. But it\u2019s certainly not good stir-fry technique.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing that\u2019s tough about making a post about \u2018how to make any stir-fry\u2019 \u2013 stir-frying isn\u2019t a dish, per se. It\u2019s a technique. Imagine making a \u2018how to make any Western braised dish\u2019 post \u2013 how could you possibly encompass Beouf Bourginon, Lousiana Gumbo, Chicken Paprikrash, and Texas Chili con Carne into one formula? There\u2019s obviously similarities, but *anything* we\u2019d list out here is going to have a million exceptions depending on the dish and the cook. And it\u2019s in those exceptions, those peculiarities, that often make certain individual dishes or chefs special. \n\nBut against all my better judgement, I\u2019m going to try. If you happen to know Chinese cooking and you start to think to yourself \u201cwait, what about XYZ dish?\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s not how I do it\u201d \u2026 yes. You\u2019re probably right. \n\n[Video is here if you\u2019d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/WujehK7kYLM). \n\nIn the video, we explain all this with one dish \u2013 a simple, classic homecooking stir-fry of pork and chilis called *Qingjiao Rousi*. So at the end of each section, I\u2019ll explain what we chose to do with that particular dish, for reference. \n\n**The protein:**\n\nOne of the biggest issue that people have with stir-frying, I think, is that they get started out on the wrong protein products. Look at basic stir-fry recipes in English, you\u2019ll generally find that they use either (1) beef or (2) boneless chicken. Both of these protein products have their complications.\n\nBeef is sort of naturally dry. When you marinate beef, good technique is to add in a couple tablespoons of water in with your marinade to let the beef absorb it. Further, beef\u2019s often marinated with some sort of tenderizing agent \u2013 either egg white, baking soda, or papain (an enzyme from papaya, which is a Chinese meat tenderizer powder). For best results, you\u2019ll then use the \u201cstir-fry method #3: Huachao\u201d from below, which is a super brief shallow fry.\n\nBoneless chicken, meanwhile, is another meat that\u2019s tough to stir-fry as is \u2013 especially breast meat, which\u2019s the most popular form of chicken in the West. There\u2019s a reason why a lot of Chinese poultry dishes are cleaved across the bone and cooked as bone-in pieces: the bone insulates, causing the meat surrounding it to heat up evenly.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously certain dishes that use cubed chicken in Chinese cooking \u2013 notably, the ever popular Kung Pow chicken. But for these, you really want to marinate with a tenderizing agent (often egg white) and using that \u201cstir-fry method #3: Huachao\u201d below is practically non-negotiable unless you happen to have a jet-engine restaurant burner. \n\nSo what\u2019s the best introductory protein product? Pork. It can be made tasty using any of the methods below, on any kind of stove.\n\n**For the Qingjiao Rousi Pork with Chilis, choose pork (duh).**\n\n__________________________\n\n**Cutting your protein:**\n\nOk, so there\u2019s many different shapes that meat can be cut, so I\u2019ll focus on three: sheets, slivers, and cubes. For each one, you\u2019re looking for the \u2018grain\u2019 of the meat \u2013 [this is what it looks like](https://i.imgur.com/AZ6jfaA.jpg).  You want to cut against the grain \u2013 which can sometimes be obvious, but at times depending on your cut can be non-intuitive.\n\nReason being, you aren\u2019t just cutting perpendicular to the grain, you\u2019re cutting perpendicular *in 3D space*. This explanation might be overly dweeby, but [take a look at this](http://gamedevelopertips.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/rhlh.png). If the forward vector in that picture is your \u2018grain\u2019, you\u2019re slicing in the direction of the \u2018up\u2019 vector (or down, obviously), *not* the \u2018right\u2019 vector. This was something that I learned\u2026 painfully late (it\u2019s usually not a problem with pork loin, but something like lamb leg can be more challenging).\n\n*Sheets:* For sheets, slice down against the grain into 2 mm pieces. This\u2019s probably a bad explanation, but a nice technique is to press the sheet down against the chopping board/the previously sliced sheets as you cut it \u2013 this keeps everything more organized.\n\n*Slivers:* First slice into sheets, then stack the sheets on top of eachother and slice down to get slivers. For the sheet part of the cutting, you really want it nice and thin, but this part has a bit more flexibility \u2013 2-3 mm is fine, no need to be too paranoid.\n\n*Cubes:* I think you probably know how to cube stuff. Only thing I\u2019d say \u2013 make sure your cubes aren\u2019t overly large. Aim for \u00bd inch. \n\n**For Qingjiao Rousi Pork with Chilis, choose Slivers.**\n\n__________________________\n\n**Marination/Velveting:**\n\nOk, so there seems to be a little bit of confusion about marinades, likely surrounding the English term \u2018velveting\u2019. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m gunna get into the weeds a little here \u2013 don\u2019t be intimidated by the Chinese words I\u2019m gunna be throwing out here.\n\nThere\u2019s two main types of marinades in Chinese cooking: (1) *mawei*, which aims to alter the flavor of the meat, and could be conceptualized as similar to a Western \u2018marinade\u2019 and (2) *shangjiang*, which aims to alter the texture of the meat, which\u2019s basically what\u2019s commonly translated as \u2018velveting\u2019. If you follow these posts, I translate both as \u2018marinade\u2019, for\u2026 reasons. If you\u2019re curious, drop a line below and I\u2019ll explain my reasoning.\n\nFor a stir-fry, 95% of the time you\u2019ll be using the latter method \u2013 i.e., velveting. These things really depend on the dish and the chef, and most of the time it\u2019s basically eye-balled. But here\u2019s what we always try to stick to for standardization purposes:\n(per ~100g of meat, roughly)\n\n1.\t*Salt, \u00bc tsp.* This\u2019s used for basically the same reason you\u2019d brine in Western cooking. [I\u2019ll let Kenji explain]( ttps://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/quick-and-dirty-guide-to-brining-turkey-chicken-thanksgiving.html#why) why: \u201cCertain muscle proteins are naturally dissolved by the salt in the brine solution. Once these proteins are dissolved, muscle fibers lose some of their ability to contract when cooking. Less contraction leads to less internal moisture being squeezed out, which in turn leads to juicier meat.\u201d \n\n2.\t*Sugar, \u00bd tsp.* Flavor, mostly \u2013 to balance the salt.\n\n3.\t*Cornstarch (\u751f\u7c89), \u00bd tsp.* Cornstarch\u2019s really important here. The thin layer of starch does two things: first, it slows down the heat transfer \u2013 as the meat\u2019s cooking, the starches are gelatinizing, absorbing some of the energy.  Second, the gelatinized starch helps also makes a moisture-resistant barrier, trapping juices inside the meat.\n\n4.\t*Liaojiu, a.k.a. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u5174\u9152), \u00bd tsp.* Ok, so I know that alcohol in marinades is a pretty contentious topic, but for this kind of marinade, it\u2019s a must. My hypothesis is that the alcohol changes the texture of the cornstarch coating and promotes browning, but I\u2019ve never tested it myself\u2026 Chinese sources say that it\u2019s to remove the *shanwei* (gaminess) from the meat, so we\u2019ll just go with that.\n\n5.\t*Soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), \u00bc tsp.* To season the meat. You could either use light soy sauce or dark soy sauce, depending on the effect you\u2019re after. Dark soy sauce gives the meat a deeper color. Sometimes you want that, sometimes you don\u2019t.\n\n6.\t*Oil, \u00bd tsp to 1 tsp.* To coat the meat after mixing everything in. Helps form a barrier so that things don\u2019t dry out when marinating.  \n\nOptional ingredients in the marinade:\n\n1.\t*Egg white, 1/2 .* Usually I\u2019d advise against adding egg white unless you\u2019re doing Method #3: Huachao. Why? Because otherwise you\u2019ll end up with little particles of egg on your meat. Not a deal breaker, but definitely noticeable. Egg white tenderizes, and also helps slow heat transfer much in the same way cornstarch does.\n\n2.\t*Papain (\u5ae9\u8089\u7c89), 1/8 tsp.* You know that absurdly soft, almost mealy texture of meats that you get from some American-Chinese takeout joints in the West? That\u2019s papain. It\u2019s *great* at the job of tenderizing, but almost\u2026 too good? It really, really depends on the dish you\u2019re doing and the final texture you\u2019re going for. It\u2019s basically the nuke in your \u201chow could I make this more tender?\u201d arsenal.\n \n3.\t*Baking soda (\u82cf\u6253\u7c89), 1/8 tsp.* Kind of like\u2026 papain lite. We usually don\u2019t usually use baking soda in our recipes, mostly because Steph\u2019s like superhumanly sensitive to the taste. And it *does* have a taste. But you can reach for baking soda if you want the same effect as papain without the sourcing headaches.\n\n\n4.\t*White pepper powder (\u767d\u80e1\u6912\u7c89), 1/8 tsp.* For flavor. Especially popular addition in Straits Chinese food, I\u2019ve found.\n\n5.\t*Oyster sauce (\u8017\u6cb9), \u00bc tsp.* For flavor. Goes great with beef.\n\nAt the same time, you don\u2019t need to add *all* the marinade ingredients if you don\u2019t want. Like, sometimes we just want a dry marinade, so salt+sugar+cornstarch. Sometimes we just don\u2019t want the color from the soy sauce, so everything minus the soy sauce. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s regional differences. The south and east of China are much more likely to reach for the sugar in marinades. Muslim Chinese don\u2019t use alcohol. Many chefs in the North insist that salt and soy sauce shouldn\u2019t be added to marinades, lest they dry them out (heavily disagree, but hey, it\u2019s something to know if you want to replicate a northern Chinese dish).\n\n*How to Marinate:* First mix in the salt and the sugar and coat the meat well. Then, I like to mix the cornstarch in with the alcohol and/or the egg white so that it\u2019s evenly combined when you toss it in. Add in that mixture and the soy sauce and mix well, then coat it all with oil. It should be oily enough that it\u2019s at least slightly slipping off your fingers. Cuts like sheets need less oil, cuts like slivers need more.\n\n*How long to marinate:* Generally, at least 15 minutes is enough. For dices/sheets you might want to aim closer to 30 minutes.  For something like ribs you might want to do something like 45-60 minutes. I haven\u2019t found an upper limit for marination times, but I\u2019ve also never tested it either.\n\n**For Qingjiao Rousi, choose the standard marinade. Add in egg white if you\u2019re going for the Stir Fry Method #3: Huachao. Baking soda or papain is optional but I wouldn\u2019t include it. Some white pepper powder might be nice too.**\n\n__________________________\n\n**Aromatics:**\n\nI\u2019ve sometimes heard \u201cGarlic, Ginger, and Scallions\u201d being referred as the Chinese equivalent of the Cajun \u2018Trinity\u2019. I don\u2019t dislike the comparison, but I don\u2019t particularly like it either. Cantonese food, for example, can be very particular about which *combination* of the above ingredients should be used (generally\u2026 either garlic only, ginger only, ginger and garlic, ginger and scallion, or all three).  \n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth mentioning that up in the North of China, they\u2019ll swap out scallion entirely for leek.\n\nWhen using scallion, only the white portion of the scallion is used as an aromatic. Not sure what \u2018the white part of the scallion\u2019 is? [This part](https://imgur.com/MHss9dA). Use the rest of the scallion as a way to finish off a dish, garnish, or save for something else (scallion pancake is a great way to use up leftover scallion greens).\n\nAromatics are usually either crushed and used whole, or minced. At times, julienned.\n\n**For Qingjiao Rousi, use minced garlic and ginger \u2013 we used 1 inch of ginger and 2 cloves of garlic. You could also add in some minced scallion whites if you like.**\n\n__________________________\n\n**Dried Chilis/Sichuan Peppercorn/Sichuan Chili Bean Paste:**\n\nNow I\u2019m starting to feel the pressure of \u2018how to make any stir fry\u2019 \u2013 god, there\u2019s so many exceptions and regional variants. Let me at least say a brief aside on these three ingredients, because they\u2019re used in a bunch of Sichuanese dishes.\n\nSichuan peppercorns and sliced dried chilis are used *basically* in conjunction with the aromatics. With some dishes (e.g. Kung Pao chicken), you add the chilis and peppercorns a bit beforehand (~30 seconds) in order to get them a little scorched.\n\nFor Sichuan Chili Bean paste, after you fry the aromatics, you\u2019ll want the wok to be on low-medium heat to fry the bean paste. For a lot of Chili Bean Paste dishes, a primary goal is to \u201cfry out the red oil\u201d (\u7092\u51fa\u7ea2\u6cb9). Oil isn\u2019t really \u2018frying out\u2019 per se \u2013 the paste will begin to absorb the oil in the wok, the then re-release it. The released oil\u2019ll have a really vibrant red color\u2026 this process takes a bit (~2-3 minutes), and you do need a rather hefty chunk of oil in there already to get a nice effect.\n\n**For Qingjiao Rousi Pork with Chilis, none of the above ingredients are used.**\n\n__________________________\n\n**Vegetables:**\n\nSo the \u2018vegetable\u2019 in a stir fry can be\u2026 literally anything, in any amount. You cook them\u2026 for how long that particular vegetable should be cooked. \n\nI know that\u2019s not really a lot of help. I\u2019m really struggling to generalize a \u2018rule\u2019 here. Let\u2019s do this:\n\n1.\t*Thick vegetables:* Stuff like Gailan, Broccoli, Choy Sum, Napa Cabbage, Carrot, Bak Choy, etc. These kinds of vegetables *really* benefit from a separate blanch before tossing them in a stir fry. If you blanch the vegetables beforehand, add them when you\u2019d add your thin vegetable. Otherwise, it\u2019d be best to separately fry and add a touch of water during the process.\n\n2.\t*Thin vegetables:* Stuff like Chinese celery, cilantro, Chinese chives, green garlic, scallions, etc. Think anything that loves to wilt. These are added at the *very* end of the stir fry.\n\n3.\t*Fresh chilis/bell peppers:* These annoyingly don\u2019t really fit into either category, though I\u2019m sure there\u2019s other vegetables that fit a similar bill as well. They\u2019re generally fried after the aromatics are.\n\nFor all of these, let\u2019s say that (supposing you\u2019re making a meat stir-fry) the total vegetable quantity would range from \u201ca little bit\u201d to \u201cequal to the meat quantity by weight\u201d.\n\nThe last important thing I\u2019d like to touch on here is **the shape rule**. The shape rule is to Chinese cooking what \u201cI before E except after C\u201d is to English grammar \u2013 there\u2019s so many damn exceptions it\u2019s tough to call it a hard-and-fast rule, but it\u2019s usually true enough. The basic idea is this: cut all your shit into a similar \u2018shape\u2019. Cutting your meat into sheets? Cut your peppers into diamonds. Slivers? A julienne. \n\nYou get the idea. This is primarily due to (1) aesthetics and (2) making it easier to eat. If you don\u2019t follow it, things can sometimes just feel a bit weird and off, sort of like a burger with the cheese faced down.\n\n**For Qingjiao Rousi Pork with Chilis, we\u2019ll julienne 100 grams of fresh chilis. We used Sichuan erjingtiao chilis \u2013 they\u2019re nice, they got a bit of a kick to them. Feel free to use poblano, anaheims, jalapenos, bell pepper\u2026 whatever\u2019s tasty where you live.**\n\n__________________________\n\n**Seasoning:**\n\nLots of different ways to season a stir fry. Some common choices include:\n\n(all amounts assuming 250g of ingredients in the stir fry)\n\n1.\t*Salt, \u00bc tsp.*\n\n2.\t*Sugar, \u00bd tsp.*\n\n3.\t*Light soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), 1 tsp.* Or, sometimes, dark soy sauce for color. This generally goes in before the other seasoning.\n\n4.\t*MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), a sprinkle to 1/8 tsp.* MSG is an outstanding ingredient in moderation. I say \u201cin moderation\u201d not in response those spurious \u2018health concerns\u2019 propagated by gluten-free hippies and similar lovers of pseudo-science, but rather because it\u2019s pretty damn strong. A little can go a long way \u2013 if you\u2019ve reached the point where you can obviously taste the MSG in a dish, you\u2019ve probably added too much. Really does a bang up job balancing the heat from chilis.\n\n**For Qingjiao Rousi Pork with Chilis: 1 tsp light soy sauce and \u00bc tsp salt. You could add a little sugar or MSG in there if you liked though.**\n\n__________________________\n\n**How to add a sauce to your stir-fry.**\n\nThere\u2019s a million different \u2018sauce\u2019 variants, it\u2019d be impossible to cover them all here. The basic idea is to have a mix of cornstarch and stock/water/water+stock concentrate at a 1:6 ratio.  In the sauce, you can also add in your seasoning for... convenience.\n\nHow much you use in the end is ultimately up to you and how \u2018saucy\u2019 you want your dish. In the video, we showed how to add a slight sauce to that Pork and Chili stir fry, though it\u2019s usually not a sauced dish.  What we used for that was:\n\n1.\t*3 tbsp water mixed with \u00bd tsp stock concentrate (\u9e21\u6c41/\u9c8d\u9c7c\u6c41).* We usually use abalone sauce concentrate over chicken stock concentrate because it\u2026 tastes better.\n\n2.\t*The seasoning from above.* That was 1 tsp light soy sauce and \u00bc tsp salt.\n\n3.\t*\u00bd tbsp cornstarch mixed with just enough water to let it come together, ~1 tsp.* Mixed in a separate bowl. Some people add the starch directly to the sauce, but we find it best to add them separately.\n\nThis makes for an not-very-obvious sauce. If you\u2019d like something saucier, scale the ratios upward to ~4-5 tbsp. Alternatively, sometimes it\u2019s nice to just give everything a nice sheen \u2013 in this case, scale downwards to 1.5-2 tbsp. \n\nFrom there, you could really add whatever sort of seasonings you like. As much as I'd love to be able to give out something like the 'mother sauces' for Chinese cooking, sauces are sort of idiosyncratic. Oyster sauce is a pretty common addition, as is white pepper powder. Some other sauces from our super-old school Cantonese cookbook if you\u2019re curious:\n\n* Yellow qian: Stock, slurry, white pepper powder\n\n* Green qian: Squeezed liquid from mashed vegetables like spinach, stock, slurry\n\n* Red qian: The cooking liquid from certain meats (e.g. duck, ham, abalone), slurry\n\n* White qian: Milk, stock, slurry\n\n* Black qian: Stock, slurry, and soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce\n\n__________________________\n\n**Oils/alcohol:**\n\nSo there\u2019s two final bits to touch on: alcohol and oil.\n\n(all amounts assuming 250g of \u2018stuff\u2019)\n\n*Frying oil:* Our go to frying oil is peanut, with lard being the runner up. Peanut oil\u2019s got a nice balance between taste and smoke point \u2013 it\u2019s a really nice all purpose frying oil. \n\nFor vegetables and tofu, we really like using lard. Really ups the richness. Don\u2019t have lard hanging around? No problem. Slice up some pork belly, fry it to render out the oil, and then continue the stir-fry \u2013 I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever complained about having a bit of pork belly in their stir fry. You could honestly also do the same thing with a bit of American streaky bacon too, depending on the dish (pork belly has the benefit of being a bit more neutral and general purpose).\n\nAs for other frying oils, it really depends where you are in the country. In the north, you see Soy Bean oil  quite a bit. In the Southwest, they\u2019ve got an incredibly distinctive virgin rapeseed oil called *caiziyou* - it\u2019s really fundamental to a lot of Sichuanese flavors (Indian mustard seed oil is a solid sub for that stuff).\n\n*Liaojiu, i.e. Shaoxing wine (\u6599\u9152/\u7ecd\u5174\u9152), 1 tbsp, or equivalent.* Ok, so this gets used quite a bit while stir-frying. See, sometimes the wok can get too hot. Want to cool it down? Add in a splash of wine \u2013 add it by pouring it over your spatula and around the sides of the wok. This allows it to sizzle and quickly reduce away (and also makes for some real satisfying steam). We basically always add it right after we\u2019re done frying the aromatics \u2013 after all, minced garlic loves to burn. We\u2019ll label that as a \u2018step\u2019 in the processes below, but just know that I\u2019ve seen other cooks add it at different times.\n\nI\u2019ve seen some people online being *very* particular about how the wine used in Chinese stir-fries **must** be Shaoxing. And while I like Shaoxing as an ingredient, eh\u2026 I disagree. In the south of China, often you\u2019ll see some people reach for rice wine (i.e. *mijiu*) in place of this stuff, and that\u2019s cool. You know what else is a rice wine? Sake. If sake\u2019s easier for you to buy than Shaoxing, just use that.\n\nI\u2019ve heard some people offer \u2018dry sherry\u2019 as a Shaoxing sub. That\u2019s fine I suppose, but it\u2019s really only like Shaoxing in alcohol content and color. At that point, just use whatever the hell you feel like. Wanna add a splash of bourbon? Go for it, I\u2019ve done it before. It\u2019s your stir fry, after all.\n\n*Finishing oil, a splash of cooking oil -or- toasted sesame oil (\u9ebb\u6cb9), 1 tsp.* So in restaurants, at the very end of the dish they\u2019ll toss in a splash of oil. Why? Well, it adds a really nice sheen and, you know, oil tastes good.\n\nWhen we cook at home though, we don\u2019t have the same cost considerations restaurants do\u2026 so we get to reach for the toasted sesame oil. Same sheen, but tastes better.\n\n**For Qingjiao Rousi Pork with Chilis, use whatever frying oil you feel like. We used Peanut. We finished off with 1 tsp of toastest sesame oil, and of course used 1 tbsp of that Liaojiu/Shaoxing wine when frying.**\n\n__________________________\n\n**Before you stir-fry: Longyau/Huaguo (\u6ed1\u9505)**\n\nOk, so this process down have an English translation \u2013 I don\u2019t use it, because it\u2019s confusing as all hell. The name? \u201cSeasoning\u201d. But this is a \u2018seasoning\u2019 that\u2019s *separate* from the \u2018seasoning\u2019 that you use to break in your wok/cast iron\u2026 *this* seasoning you\u2019ll do before basically every stir fry. \n\nStupid translation. Let\u2019s just agree to call in by it\u2019s Cantonese term, *longyau*.\n\nWhat\u2019s Longyau? It\u2019s basically a restaurant technique to ensure a nice non-stick surface for you wok.  If you\u2019ve ever had issues with stuff sticking, lack of Longyau is the likely culprit \u2013 it\u2019s especially important if you wok is new and/or you don\u2019t use it a lot. \n\nTake a gander [at this video of the estimable Wang Gang](https://youtu.be/zoT5qqi81tk?t=2m1s) \u2013 what he\u2019s doing before tossing in his frying oil is (1) getting his wok really hot (2) swirling around a good bit of cool oil (3) dipping the oil out into a dedicated side oil bowl.\n\nThis technique is *way* more common in restaurants than it is in homes, and learning it was a real revelation for us. Also helps pre-heat the wok a bit. Thing is\u2026 while we\u2019re weird and obsessive and *do* have a \u2018side oil bowl\u2019 in our kitchen, I know that\u2019s not really a reasonable ask for someone reading a recipe. So instead, this is the practice we recommend.\n\n1.\t*Get your wok piping hot.* Like, steak searing temperature.\n\n2.\t*Shut off the heat.* I know in the linked video Wang Gang did the *Longyau* over the flame. We learned to do if off the heat. We still like this step for heat control purposes.\n\n3.\t*Add in the amount of oil you\u2019re planning to fry with.* So, no oil bowl necessary. Planning on 2 tbsp of oil? Add in 2 tbsp of oil.\n\n4.\t*Give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface.* Anywhere the oil extends to will be your non-stick surface. The benefit of the \u2018restaurant oil bowl\u2019 approach is that they can add a bunch more oil than we can with this method\u2026 and thus a wider \u2018non-stick\u2019 area. But whatever, still works good enough.\n\nYou could always\u2026 not do this. Plenty of homecooks don\u2019t. But we really like the frying surface it provides, and also gives your wok a heat to start frying with that tends to be \u2018just right\u2019. \n\n__________________________\n\n**Stir Fry method #1: Shuchao (\u719f\u7092), a step-by-step stir fry.**\n\nSo this Chinese phrase *Shuchao* refers to stir-frying that is generally \u2018pre-cooked\u2019. Sichuanese Twice-Cooked Pork? Also *shuchao.* But it can also refer to the step-by-step stir-fry where we\u2019re frying our protein separately. It\u2019s a nice technique that can also work well on a whimpy stove.\n\nFor this, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re cooking your main protein via stir-frying \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be true.\n\n*General overview:*\n\nBlanch any thick vegetables that need to be blanched (if using) --> Longyau --> Fry your protein until 90% done -->  Shut off the heat, reserve --> Longyau --> Fry aromatics --> Swirl in Liaojiu/wine of choice --> Fry fresh chilis (if using) --> Add back your protein --> Super brief fry --> Add back any pre-cooked thick vegetables (if using) --> Super brief fry \uf0e0 Season/Add Sauce (if using) --> Mix, then thicken with the slurry (if using), waiting ~15 seconds to thicken --> Add any thin vegetables (if using) --> Super brief fry --> Heat off --> Finishing oil in --> Brief mix --> Out\n\nOk, so here\u2019s this technique in action with our Qingjiao Rousi:\n\n1.\t*Longyau.* Get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil \u2013 here about two tablespoons \u2013 and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface.\n\n2.\t*High flame, pork slivers, in. Fry for ~one minute until 90% done.* For slivers it\u2019s a nice idea to first go at them with chopsticks in order to kind of pry them apart. They love to clump.\n\n3.\t*Remove the slivers, shut off the heat.* What does \u201890% done\u2019 look like? For these sorts of cuts, it\u2019s basically whenever they for the most part \u201clook done\u201d. This ain\u2019t like a pork chop where you have to either know by temperature or experience.\n\n4.\t*Wipe down with a paper towl.* Or if you got one of those cool wok brushes, use that.\n\n5.\t*Longyau again.* You know the drill.\n\n6.\t*Turn the flame to high, and IMMEDIATELY go in with your aromatics. Fry for ~15 seconds til fragrant.* No waiting for your oil to get hot, unless you love burnt ginger and garlic.\n\n7.\t*Swirl in ~1 tbsp liaojiu wine over your spatula and around the sides of the wok.* It\u2019ll sizzle and quickly reduce. My favorite part of every stir fry.\n\n8.\t*Add in the chilis. Fry for 30 seconds.* \n\n9.\t*Add in the pork. Fry for 15 seconds.* \n\n10.\t*Add in the seasoning. Quick Mix.* Tossing, ideally.\n\n11.\t*Heat off, toasted sesame oil in, quick mix.*\n\n12.\t*Out.*  \n\n__________________________\n\n**Stir Fry method #2: Shengchao (\u751f\u7092), a simple stir fry with everything all together.**\n\nThis is basically the same as the last one, only we don\u2019t fry the pork separately.\n\nLongyau --> Fry your protein until 70-80% done --> Scooch the protein up to the side of the wok --> Add a touch more cool oil --> Fry aromatics in cool oil --> Swirl in Liaojiu/wine of choice --> Mix, then scooch everything up to the side again --> Fry fresh chilis (if using) --> Season/Add Sauce (if using) --> Mix, then thicken with the slurry (if using), waiting ~15 seconds to thicken --> Add any thin vegetables (if using) --> Super brief fry --> Heat off --> Finishing oil in --> Brief mix --> Out\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s how it looked like for the Pork and Chilis:\n\n1.\t*Longyau.* Get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in the oil \u2013 here about two tablespoons \u2013 and give it a swirl to get a nice non-stick surface.\n\n2.\t*High flame, pork slivers, in. Fry for ~one minute until 70-80% done.* Using chopsticks at first to help them unclump.\n\n3.\t*Remove the slivers, shut off the heat.* What does \u201970-80% done\u2019 look like? In practice, a lot like 90%, only less paranoid. \n\n4.\t*Scooch the pork up the side of the wok.*\n\n5.\t*Add a touch of cool oil into the wok, then fry the aromatics for ~15 seconds.*\n\n6.\t*Swirl in ~1 tbsp liaojiu wine over your spatula and around the sides of the wok.*\n\n7.\t*Brief mix, then scooch everything up the side again.* \n\n8.\t*Add in the chilis. Fry for 30 seconds.* \n\n9.\t*Add in the seasoning. Quick Mix.* \n\n\n10.\t*Heat off, toasted sesame oil in, quick mix.*\n\n11.\t*Out.*  \n\n__________________________\n\n**Stir Fry method #3: Huachao (\u6ed1\u7092), passing through oil, then stir-frying.**\n\nThis technique is hyper common at restaurants, and is honestly often the best way to stir fry meat. It makes for super juicy, tender meat\u2026 if you\u2019ve ever been frustrated that your stir-fry isn\u2019t like a restaurant\u2019s, it\u2019s probably not your stove. It\u2019s probably because they huachao\u2019d, and you didn\u2019t.\n\nYes, passing through oil means a brief deep fry. But before you say \u201cfuck this, I\u2019m out\u201d, I just wanna emphasize that passing through oil really doesn\u2019t require that much oil. We\u2019re cutting the protein super thin, right? This ain\u2019t like setting up a deep fry for a southern-style fried chicken or something: all we need is the depth of the oil to come up a shade over an inch, about 3cm.\n\nIf you happen to own a round bottom wok, your life\u2019s even easier. We usually use about a cup or two of oil to pass through, but you can often get away with as little as a half a cup if using a round bottomed wok.\n\nGenerally, pork and chicken are passed through oil at a higher temperature, ~180C, while beef likes a lower temperature, ~160C.\n\nGeneral overview:\n\nHeat the oil to the temperature you need for your meat --> Fry for ~20 seconds, remove --> Pour out the oil \uf0e0 Blanch any thick vegetables that need to be blanched (if using) --> Longyau --> Fry your protein until 90% done -->  Shut off the heat, reserve --> Longyau --> Fry aromatics --> Swirl in Liaojiu/wine of choice --> Fry fresh chilis (if using) --> Add back your protein --> Super brief fry --> Add back any pre-cooked thick vegetables (if using) --> Super brief fry --> Season/Add Sauce (if using) --> Mix, then thicken with the slurry (if using), waiting ~15 seconds to thicken --> Add any thin vegetables (if using) --> Super brief fry --> Heat off --> Finishing oil in --> Brief mix --> Out\n\nThis one is basically exactly like our first method, except with that passing through oil. I\u2019m beginning to run out of breath, so forgive me for abbreviating this:\n\n1.\t*Heat the oil up to 180C, then toss in the pork slivers.* Break them apart with chopsticks because pork slivers love to clump.\n\n2.\t*Dip out the oil.* It\u2019s a nice idea to have a big bowl with a wire strainer nestled on it to catch the pork.\n\n3.\t*Continue, just like the first method.*\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of stuff I didn\u2019t get to here (Wok size! Stoves! Etc.!) but I think that\u2019s enough for now :) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/b0zql0/basic_techniques_how_to_make_any_chinese_stir_fry/", "created_utc": 1552566477.0, "score": 3153, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 184, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/b0zql0/basic_techniques_how_to_make_any_chinese_stir_fry/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Koshari is an Egyptian dish that exemplifies the words \"Carb loaded\". It's made of Rice, Pasta, Lentils and Chickpeas; and despite being sacrilegious it's absolutely delicious", "selftext": "Every week I cook and document a new Middle Eastern dish, this week I tackled Koshari. An Egyptian Street food with Indian origins that will fulfill your deepest carby desires. If you ask anyone who's been to Egypt about the dishes they remember most fondly, you'll likely hear Koshari mentioned more than once. It's a unique dish that really encompasses the words comfort food. Not only is Kushari one of the most popular and cheapest street foods in Egypt, but it's also the National Dish of the country.\n\n## What is Koshari\n\nPut simply, [Koshari is carbs on carbs on carbs](https://imgur.com/a/qxxO9LX). It's made from a mixture of rice, pasta and lentils which is served with three different sauces.  It's then topped with spiced chickpeas and crispy fried onions for some textural variation. Now if it sounds like sacrilege to mix rice and pasta, well it probably is, but it's delicious sacrilege and you should try it at least once. Perfectly cooked soft rice is mixed with al dente pasta and fried vermicelli, then lightly spiced brown lentils are added. All together you get a great contrast of textures and flavors. The three sauces that are added are a garlic tomato sauce, a spicy tomato sauce (Shatta), and a spiced garlic and vinegar sauce (Dakka). By controlling the amounts of each sauce you can customize the flavors of the dish to your liking, I'm a big fan of extra Shatta and extra Dakka which makes a delicious bowl of Koshari which is quite spicy and tangy. Finally there's the toppings and they are actually a significant part of the dishes flavor. The lentils are cooked with Cumin and some aromatics to give them a lightly spiced flavor, and the onions are also spiced with Cumin before being fried to a perfect crisp. I'm not a massive fans of chickpeas except when turned into Hummus, but I have got to say these chickpeas are bloody delicious and could be eaten just on their own with some rice, and the crispy onions well apart from having great texture, they end up caramelizing really well when frying, and so they have a sweet cumin flavor which is to die for.\n\nThe popularity of Koshari in Egypt is partly due to it's wide availability and cheap price, [a huge bowl of Koshari](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/_rClVy-0xDKf3LDemp-5wNza5uaSi6urOun8bDsh3Zk8R1AWx0G2TTGHyNgzqnD5y7u8wGvPCI3PtoLYHZXaym-DHEMCHBHYRUQ-Otu1XuId) (enough for 2-3 people) costs 15 Egyptian Pounds ($0.80) at some of the bigger chains and historically it used to cost as little as ($0.20). It also has the benefit of primarily being made from dried pulses which helps keep the price down and when you can make something so delicious with just a few ingredients, well it's no surprise it became the Egyptian national dish. Koshari is also commonly made at home, busy parents can make a large batch of it and reheat it throughout the week. I'm a big fan of homemade koshari because I generally feel most of the Koshari chains in Cairo lack the oomph factor, and I find that layering the flavors in the dish really helps them pop. I've stolen this recipe from my mother in law as it's the best I've ever tasted and hopefully when you make it you'll understand why.\n\n## History\n\nThe history of Koshari is actually very interesting, you see Koshari is thought to have evolved from the south asian dish [Khichiri or Khichdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khichdi), which is a dish made from lentils and rice cooked together. Khichidi has been around for thousands of years, and the Wikipedia entry mentions \"The Greek king Seleucus during his campaign in India (305-303 BC), mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent.\". It also states that Ibn Battuta encountered the dish during his time in India. So how did Khichidi get to Egypt? Well there's two possible theories, firstly the silk road introduced all manner of food and spices from Asia to the Middle East. There's a lot of shared dishes and cooking techniques between the two cultures, so it's not unlikely that the dish may have first come to Egypt via the silk road. The second possible explanation is that it was brought to Egypt by the British when they took control of the country in the early 1900s. The British at the time also controlled India and their troops came from all over the empire, so it's likely that the dish may have spread that way.\n\nBack in the 1900s and until around 1970, there were many different nationalities living in Egypt, it was a popular place for expatriates. Cairo had enclaves of Greeks, Italians, French, Turkish, Syrian and of course British nationals. The story goes that when Khichidi reached italian households, they ended up adding pasta to the Khichidi and thus the Koshari base was born. The sauces were likely taken from other Egyptian dishes and added to Koshari, most Egyptian vegetable dishes have a tomato sauce similar to the koshari one, and the garlic and vinegar mixture is close to the sauce added to Egyptian Fattah. \n\n## Flavor Profile\n\n[Brown lentils](https://groceries.morrisons.com/productImages/233/233567011_0_640x640.jpg?identifier=4ff448f1030f9ca4fff4dc3cf311f92e) are quite different from other lentils as they tend to have a more earthy and Umami flavor, they lend a great depth of flavor to the koshari base, which without the lentils wouldn't really taste of much. The technique I use to cook the base reuses the oil that the onions are fried in, so you also get a layered flavor of onion and cumin from the rice. When cooking the base I also use the liquid that the lentils were boiled in, instead of plain water, and that helps the lentil flavor really soak into the rice.\n\nCombining the sauces is very much a matter of personal preference, so assuming you are making a dish with a small amount of chili and a couple of tablespoons of the other sauces, then here's what you would taste. The tomato sauce has a good amount of garlic and vinegar in it, when mixed with the Koshari Base it helps make the whole dish quite a bit brighter tasting. The Dakka (garlic and vinegar sauce) adds a further tangy and acidic element, this time it's a bit of a powerfull kick, but it balances out really well with the earthiness of the lentils. The chili sauce is used to add heat and spice, and it's not uncommon for people to go without it. I think it really helps round out the flavors. Finally the toppings, and I think they just add a bit more of a complex spiced flavor and some much needed sweetness to the whole dish.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Spiced Chickpeas\n* 1 Cup (225g)(8oz) chickpeas dry or 750g (26 oz) Canned Chickpeas\n* 1 Onion\n* 1 Plum Tomato\n* 2 cloves of Garlic\n* 1 Tsp salt\n* 1 Tsp ground cumin\n* 1/4 Tsp Cayenne Pepper\n\n### Brown Lentils\n* 250g (8.75oz) Dark Brown Lentils (These are sometimes called black lentils, but they are more of a cooked minced beef color)\n* 1 Tsp ground cumin\n* 1 Tsp salt\n\n### Fried Onions\n* 6-8 Large brown onions\n* 2 Tsp salt\n* 1 Tsp Pepper\n* 2 Tsp ground cumin\n* 1-2 Cups of vegetable oil for frying\n\n### Tomato Sauce\n* 800g (28oz) Chopped tomatos or Passata(I always use canned for this recipe)\n* 10 cloves of garlic\n* 4 Tbsp vinegar\n* 1 Tsp salt\n* 1/4 Tsp Pepper\n\n### Shatta (chili) Sauce\n* 1-2 Fresh spicy green chilies\n* 400g (14oz) Chopped tomatos(I always use canned for this recipe)\n* 5 cloves garlic \n* 2 Tbsp vinegar\n* 1 Tsp salt\n* 1 Tsp chili powder (optional and I wouldn't add it unless you enjoy really spicy food)\n* 1/4 Tsp Pepper\n\n### Dakka (Garlic Vinegar) Sauce\n* 7 cloves garlic\n* 1/3 Cup White Vinegar\n* 1/3 Cup Water\n* 1/4 Cup Lemon juice \n* 2 Tsp ground cumin\n* 1 Tsp ground coriander\n* 1/2 Tsp salt\n* 1/2 Tsp Cayenne pepper\n\n### Koshari Base\n* 175g (6 oz) Medium Grain Rice (Egyptian preferred, but you could use ordinary japanese)\n* 175g (6 oz) Vermicelli\n* 250g (9 oz) Ditalini Pasta (or other small pasta shape)\n\n## Directions\n\nThis will make enough koshari to feed 6 really hungry people . It'll probably take you 2-4 hours to make the first time around but if you're a pro multi tasker you may be able to reduce it to an hour of active time. \n\n### To make the chickpeas\n1. Soak your dried chickpeas overnight in a large amount of room temperature water, if you're using canned chickpeas then you can skip this \n2. The next day drain your chickpeas and in a large pot boil a large amount of water (about 2 litres or quarts) and add the soaked chickpeas\n3. Add a plum tomato, the onion sliced in half and 2 cloves of garlic to the pot\n4. Add 1 Tsp Cumin, 1 Tsp Salt and 1/2 Tsp Cayenne to the pot and leave to boil for 1-2 hours\n5. The chickpeas are ready when you can squish them between your fingers. If the water evaporates then add more till they are done cooking. Drain and set aside\n\n### To make the Lentils\n1. Add 2 litres or quarts of water to a pot and boil\n2. Add 1 Tsp Salt and 1 Tsp Cumin to the water as well as your lentils\n3. Boil for 30-60 minutes until cooked through but not mushy (Try aim for an al dente texture)\n4. Strain the lentils using a colander, and keep any of the water they were boiled in for use later\n\n### To make the Tomato sauce\n1. Add the  Oil to a sauce pan on medium high heat\n2. Mince the garlic cloves and fry in the pot for a few minutes until fragrant and bubbling\n3. Before the garlic browns add the White vinegar and de-glaze the pot\n4. Blend your chopped tomatoes up into a passata and add to the pot\n5. Season with salt and pepper\n6. Allow to simmer for 20-30 minutes until thickened and resembles a marinara\n\n### To make the Spicy Tomato sauce\n1. Slice your chilis into thin circles about 2mm wide\n2. Add  Oil to a sauce pan on medium high heat\n3. Mince the Garlic cloves and add to the pot with the chilis. Let them fry for a few minutes until fragrant\n4. Add the white vinegar and deglaze the pot\n5. Add the chopped tomatoes, salt and pepper and simmer for 20 minutes until thick and chunky\n\n### To make the Dakkah, Garlic Vinegar sauce\n1. Mince 7 garlic cloves and add to a jug\n2. Add 1/3C White Vinegar, 1/3C water and 1/4C Lemon juice\n3. Add 2 Tsp Cumin, 1 Tsp Coriander, 1/2 Tsp Cayenne pepper and 1/2 Tsp salt and mix to combine\n\n### To make the crispy onions\n1. Slice your onions into thin strips against the grain of the onion about 2mm wide \n2. Place in a large bowl and add the Cumin, Black pepper and salt\n3. Mix thoroughly until all the onion strips have been separated from each other and let sit for 30-60 minutes to macerate\n4. Add frying oil to a large pot about 1.5cm or 1/2in deep, when hot add the onion in batches to fry (Reserve a handful of onions for later which we'll add to the base)\n5. Fry for 8-12 minutes per batch until Golden in color, remove and place on a paper towel lined tray, they will continue to darken after removing from the oil\n6. After a few minutes on the tray, move to a second tray with clean paper towels. Make sure to evenly space them and you can even dab excess oil off them so that they stay super crispy\n\n### To make the koshari base\n1. Wash your rice 3-4 times till the water runs clear and allow to dry for at least one hour\n2. Remove all of the oil except 1/4 - 1/2 a cup from the pot you fried the onions in, make sure to leave any sediment in the pot as that will add flavor to the rice \n3. Fry the handful of onions that you kept aside till lightly browned\n4. Add in the vermicelli and fry on high heat for 2-3 minutes until golden brown in color\n5. Add the dried rice to the vermicelli and fry for a few minutes\n6. Add the lentils to the rice and mix to combine\n6. Add a few large Tbsp of the tomato sauce to the pot as well as 3-4 Tbsp of Dakka to the pot then mix well \n8. Add the lentil water to the pot, and top up with water until the rice and vermicelli are just barely submerged\n9. Bring the pot to a boil and cover, once all of the water has evaporated from the base of the pot turn the heat down to low\n10. Allow to steam for 20-30 minutes until the rice is cooked through. You may have to add some extra water if it still isn't cooked after 30 minutes, and if it is a bit soggy you may want to steam for 10 minutes with the lid off\n11. Cook your pasta in heavily salted water till al dente\n12. Add the cooked pasta to the rice and vermicelli in two parts and mix well till evenly combined\n\n### To plate the Koshari\n1. Add a generous serving of the koshari base to a platter\n2. Spoon over the tomato sauce across the koshari base\n3. Add a few Tbsp of the Dakkah over the top of the tomato\n4. Sprinkle some of the cooked chickpeas over the top of the dish\n5. Add fried onions to the dish\n6. Serve the chili sauce on the side and Enjoy\n\n## Notes and tips\n* Try to get Egyptian rice or something with a lightly chewy texture similar to Japanese rice as these work best in Koshari\n* It's normal for some of the base to burn in the pot, try to use a gentle touch when mixing so you don't mix this in with the pasta\n* This reheats well, but I recommend keeping the sauces seperate from the base in the fridge\n* The onions will stay crispy and can be stored in a bowl for a few days, but you should keep them out of the fridge for optimal crispiness\n\n## Variations\n* There is another Koshari dish in Egypt called Koshari Ads Asfar (which means Koshari with yellow lentils) and this is similar to the original Khichiri dish\n* In Iraq and Syria there is a dish called Mujadarra made with lentils, rice and onions that dates back to the 13th century", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ik05j7/koshari_is_an_egyptian_dish_that_exemplifies_the/", "created_utc": 1598887993.0, "score": 3146, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 314, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/ik05j7/koshari_is_an_egyptian_dish_that_exemplifies_the/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "An Obsessive-Compulsive's Guide to Chipotle's Chicken.", "selftext": "I've spent the past few weeks doing some trial & error in reverse engineering Chipotle's chicken recipe. I worked at a Chipotle for a few months, so I have some first-hand knowledge about the ingredients used and different processes involved in this chicken recipe. I've reviewed *dozens* of online \"copycat\" recipes, and every single one misses the mark in some way. Let's go... \n\nFirst, I'm going to list all of the ingredients and amounts, and then the steps. And if you're so inclined, I'm going to go into great detail afterwards about each decision I made here. \n\n***Note:*** Please do not turn this into a debate about your opinion of Chipotle or their food, that's not what this post is about. I am simply sharing a recipe for those who enjoy their chicken. \n\n###INGREDIENTS \n\n####Serves: 3-4 (scale up as needed)\n\n* 2 pounds | 907g boneless/skinless chicken thighs\n\n#####Adobo marinade:\n\n* \u00bd ounce | 14g dried morita chipotle chiles\n\n* \u00bd cup | 118ml boiling water\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml Better Than Bouillon Roasted Chicken Base (reduced sodium)\n\n* 1 crushed garlic clove\n\n* 1 tablespoon | 15ml distilled white vinegar\n\n* 2 tablespoons | 30ml neutral oil\n\n* 1 tablespoon | 21g honey\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml ground cumin\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml Mexican oregano, crushed in the palm of your hand\n\n* \u00bd teaspoon | 2.5ml ground black pepper\n\n* 4 teaspoons | 12g Diamond Crystal kosher salt **or** 2 teaspoons | 12g fine table salt\n\n###INSTRUCTIONS \n\n1. Toast the dried chipotle chiles in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant and skins begins to bubble, flipping frequently to avoid burning. This should take about 5 minutes. Transfer chiles to cutting board and let them cool off until you can handle them. Remove the seeds from at least one chile. More if you want it less spicy. Remove any thick stems from the chiles. \n\n2. Meanwhile, mix boiling water and Better Than Bouillon in heat-proof container, set aside. \n\n3. Add the all chiles to bouillon and allow to soften for at least 5 minutes while you prep the rest of the ingredients. \n\n4. Add the chiles, bouillon, and all remaining adobo ingredients to a high powered blender or food processor and blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down sides as needed. At this point, the adobo marinade is going to be hot, and you do not want to put your raw chicken in the hot marinade, so allow the adobo to cool to at least room temperature before proceeding to the next step. You can use an ice bath to hasten this process. \n\n5. Add chicken to a bowl and pour adobo over chicken, then using gloves, mix thoroughly to combine, ensuring chicken is completely covered in adobo. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, ideally 24 hours. \n\n6. Preheat 2 tablespoons of a high smoke point oil in a stainless steel, carbon steel, or cast iron pan over medium high heat, until oil just begins to smoke. Make sure to turn on the vent/range hood and open some windows, this will create a \"pepper spray\" effect. Working with one piece of chicken at a time, remove from marinade, let any excess marinade drip back into bowl, and carefully lay flat-side down into hot oil. It is okay to crowd the pan, but you may have to work in batches depending on how much chicken you are cooking and how big your pan is. Cook over medium-high heat until the first side is well-charred (spotty black, but not fully black), 5-10 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until second side is well-charred, 5-10 minutes. Cook until the internal temperature is between 175F-190F. You want to err on the side of overcooking here. \n\n7. Once chicken is fully cooked and both sides are well-charred, transfer to a clean bowl and allow to rest for just 5 minutes. Once rested, move to cutting board, cut length-wise into 1/2-3/4\" strips, then align strips and cut perpendicular into 1/2-3/4\" cubes. Move all cubes and any juices back into bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to sit for at least 15 minutes. This step is crucial. Before serving, mix everything up to coat the chicken in all of the juices.  \n\n---\n\nSo now for the \"*why*\".\n\n######Adobo \n\nChipotle gets their adobo marinade in a bag. It comes to the store pre-made, so nobody really knows what's all in it, besides what's listed on their website, which I used as a reference for this. You can find the same ingredient list on their website if you google \"chipotle ingredients\" (I'm purposefully avoiding any hyperlinks in this post). \n\n######Chicken\n\nChipotle uses boneless/skinless chicken *quarters*.  These are legs and thighs still attached. If you can find these, great, use those. If not, use boneless/skinless thighs.\n\n\n######Chipotle Chiles\n\nMake sure you use the \"morita\" variety and not the \"meco\". The morita are dark purple, smaller, less smoky, and softer. The meco are light tan, larger, more smoky, and more stiff. There are several good places to buy Chipotle Morita online. If you can only find meco, it will still taste great, but not the same. Leaving all of the seeds intact does make it spicier than what's served at Chipotle, so that's why I'm suggesting to remove the seeds from at least one chile (scale this up as well, if you scale up everything else). You can adjust the spiciness as needed by removing more or less seeds and any large ribs. \n\nIt's my belief that Chipotle *does not* use anything similar to \"canned chipotles in adobo\", but instead makes their own basic adobo from dried chipotles. I've tried both methods, and starting with canned chipotles in adobo does taste different than actual chipotle. It's still very good, but just not the same. If that is all you can find, then you can use 2 tablespoons minced per pound of chicken, room-temp water, and skip step 1 and 2. \n\n######Bouillon\n\nThe Better Than Bouillon is certainly not used by Chipotle, but I will explain why I included it here. For starters, I think it's a safe assumption that *if* chipotle is using chicken stock in their adobo, then they have included that in their ingredient list by just including \"chicken\" and \"water\" as ingredients. Technically, the Better Than Bouillon contains other ingredients that are not listed on their website, but it's not anything drastic. Also, I know that many of you on this sub use Better Than Bouillon anyway, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal to include it. Worst case, just omit it and use straight water, but maybe bump the salt up very slightly if you do. I've never tested this without using the bouillon. If you have a basic homemade or boxed chicken stock, then by all means, use that instead. \n\n######Oil\n\nWhen I say \"neutral\" oil, I mean something that is refined and light in color, like vegetable oil. Chipotle lists sunflower oil, but I don't think that's worth a special purchase. I have not tested that though. \n\n######Oregano\n\nI think Mexican oregano is key here. I have tested it with standard Greek oregano, and it is very different. When I say to \"crush in the palm of your hand\", that should be pretty self-explanatory. The goal is to break up the large pieces first, and the smell should immediately hit you when you do this. If it doesn't, your oregano is old and should be replaced. \n\n######Salt\n\nThe salt amount seems quite high, and it is, but a lot of that salt will be left behind in the blender and bowl. Chipotle uses Morton kosher salt, so if you do that, you should reduce the amount by 25%, or 1.5 teaspoons or 6g per pound of chicken. You must use the exact type of salt here if you're going to use volume measurements.\n\n######Marinating\n\nI will often only marinade for about 2 hours, and it's good. Chipotle will do all of their marinades the previous day, for up to 24 hours, so this is ideal. \n\n######Cooking\n\nChipotle uses a large flat-top griddle. I have a Blackstone 36\" griddle that I use outside, which is ideal, but obviously not practical or possible for many people. I greatly prefer cooking this over charcoal, which is completely different, but highly recommended. \n\n######Resting\n\nAfter cutting the chicken into pieces, Chipotle covers the pan with plastic wrap and puts it into a warming cabinet that is set to 165F, where it will sit for *hours*, sometimes. You do not need to go to this extreme, but wrapping the bowl with the hot chicken and letting it sit for at least 15 minutes is absolutely critical here. Not doing this will produce a completely different texture. \n\n---\n\nThat's it. I think it's pretty damn close, and I think you will too. Enjoy!\n\nEdits: Corrected weight for dired morita chipotles, fixed typos, added detail about toasting chiles, added detail about cooking, changed chicken weight from 1 pound to 2 pounds because this makes too much marinade for only 1 pound (and its the minimum amount you'll want to run in a blender), added note about cooling marinade down before adding chicken, doubled the salt amount.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/wg214h/an_obsessivecompulsives_guide_to_chipotles_chicken/", "created_utc": 1659621683.0, "score": 3143, "author": "96dpi", "num_comments": 232, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/wg214h/an_obsessivecompulsives_guide_to_chipotles_chicken/", "html_title": ""}

The banana was still slightly green the next day and I want to do it this weekend when I still have time, so I went with [this apple cake](https://food52.com/recipes/82496-apple-cake-from-dorie-greenspan) (I was going to add some spices like her bakes such as cinnamon but I forgot \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). It swear it smelled so good from beginning to end that i am going to make this again for the house. \n\nWe included a note (using my best stationery) that says thank you for all her bakes and that we hope her loved ones are doing ok... It's kinda simple but we all agreed not to make too a big deal out of it. Well it's pretty uneventful as we handed it to her on our way out, and she was a bit surprised and said we didn't have to, then we told her thanks and wish she's doing well, and that was it. We hope the thought comes through. Might bake her a banana bread next time when I see ripe bananas in the shops. For now, I'll make banana foster using my leftover Plan A bananas and dark rum I bought for the apple cake.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/t0dwhi/baking_for_an_elderly_ukrainian_neighbour/", "created_utc": 1645717078.0, "score": 3126, "author": "breakupbydefault", "num_comments": 204, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/t0dwhi/baking_for_an_elderly_ukrainian_neighbour/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Harira is a popular soup from Morocco and North Africa, which combines a silky smooth broth with chickpeas, lentils and meat. It has a hearty winter spiced flavour and extremely satisfying texture. Full recipe for this bowl of joy inside", "selftext": "In the Middle East, we love soup! Most households will have soup at least once a week, and that even holds true for some people in the hot summers. One of the [most popular soups throughout the region is Harira](https://imgur.com/a/40cqFqr) which has Moroccan and North African origins. It's essentially a tomato based soup that is made with meat, chickpeas and lentils, as well as a number of herbs and warming spices. Once cooked, the soup is thickened, and the result is a warmly spiced soup with a silky smooth texture and a chunky array of meat and legumes.\n\nIf you prefer video recipes with all the visual cues, or you'd like to support my work, check out the [full video recipe on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw9BGWNDZKs)\n\n## What is Harira (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\u0629\u200e)\nHarira is a soup that hails from Morocco as well as Algeria and Tunisia, and it's regarded as one of the most important foods in the [Maghrebi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghrebi_cuisine) Kitchen. It's one of the most well known soups in the Middle East other than Lentil soup ([see my recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/j20f3z/lentil_soup_is_so_popular_in_the_middle_east_that/)) and [Orzo soup](https://www.thrifdeedubai.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/orzosoup.png), and it's popularity ranks it alongside Couscous and Tagines as significant culinary exports. One of the main reasons why Harira is so popular, is it's warm flavour profile which it gets from Ginger and Cinnamon, they give it a flavour that is distinctively North African. Apart from the actual heat warmth of the soup, the spices leave a long lasting savoury warm flavour similar to the [Libyan Mbakbaka](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/k591os/if_youve_never_had_libyan_food_before_id_highly/) I made a few months back, if you tried that and liked it, you'll definitely enjoy this. The great thing about Harira is that it can be considered a complete nutritious meal, thanks to the well rounded proteins and carbohydrates it contains.  \n\nAlongside the flavours, the texture of the soup is a really important characteristic of Harira. The meat used in the dish is cut into tiny pieces so they match the size of the re-hydrated chickpeas (about 1 cm or 3/8\" cubed). These along with green lentils provide a pleasant chunky texture to the soup and give it some chewable substance. The base of the soup also contributes significantly to the texture. Once the soup is fully cooked, a slurry of flour and water is mixed in, which thickens the soup up slightly to give it a silky texture that is similar to a cream based soup. Vermicelli noodles (broken vermicelli) are also added to the soup which adds even more texture to the final dish.  \n\nCooking Harira is actually a really straightforward and easy process. You'll first need to start off by soaking chickpeas overnight. Obviously canned chickpeas can be used here, but dried chickpeas always taste better than canned when re-hydrated. The lentils that go into this recipe are [Green Lentils](https://irepo.primecp.com/2016/03/266359/recipe-11732_Large500_ID-1495709.jpg?v=1495709) (the ones with a greenish brown colour), when cooked they have a firm outer shell with a soft pasty inside similar to the chickpeas. In terms of the herbs, you'll need to finely mince Parsley, Coriander and Celery leaves. The [celery leaves](https://foodprint.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/how-to-use-celery-leaves-1.jpg) are an important part of Harira, and if you've never tried them before, they have a very concentrated celery flavour with a delicate texture that allows them to completely dissolve in the soup. If you can't get hold of celery leaves, just use about 1.5 times the amount of celery stalk and dice it into very small cubes. The final thing that needs to be prepared is the tomatoes and onion. These need to be diced fairly small so they dissolve into the soup. I would recommend using canned tomatoes if the ones available to you don't have a strong flavour or they aren't in season.  \n\nTo make the soup you start off by searing the tiny pieces of meat until well browned and a frond forms in the pot. Then the onion is added and the pot is deglazed while the onions saute. Once they turn translucent, the tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas, celery and seasonings are added to the pot alongside 1.5l of water and the pot is brought to a boil. After boiling the heat is reduced and it simmers for 45 minutes until the chickpeas, lentils and meat are cooked through. At this point the tomato paste is added and mixed through the soup (I believe this is done at this stage to keep the tomato flavour a bit acidic). Once it has dissolved, a slurry of flour and water is mixed into the soup and allowed to cook for a few minutes. This thickens the soup from a runny watery texture to a slightly thicker creamy texture. Finally the vermicelli, parsley and coriander are added in and allowed to cook for 10 more minutes. When the time is up the vermicelli will have cooked through and softened, and the Harira is ready to be served.  \n\nHarira is always served with fresh lemon wedges, and these allow the person eating it to control the final acidity of the dish. Once the lemon is squeezed over the harira, the flavours will be in perfect balance. If you want to add them right to the serving dish then you can do that as well, but don't add it to the pot as you want the brightness of fresh lemon and not the sourness of cooked lemon. Harira is commonly eaten in Morocco with a fried sweet pastry called [Chebakia](https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/mwFkuAqRLe-FLWryVSdPUwOJhSA=/2048x1536/filters:fill(auto,1)/Chebakia-2048-x-1536-57c503535f9b5855e53c5df2.jpg), which is made from fried dough covered in a sweet syrup. If you want to make this there are [many recipes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/moroccan-sesame-cookies-with-honey-2394409) for it online, but the soup still tastes amazing without it.  \n\n## Cultural context\nHarira serves a very important role at the table during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast from food and drink from dawn until dusk. During the holy month, a large number of people spend entire evenings at the mosque praying, and Harira is often served as a quick nutritious meal that can be eaten before prayers begin. A lot of Moroccans will break their fast daily with a bowl of Harira to hydrate themselves. I've also read that it's popular amongst the Moroccan Jewish community who sometimes break their fasts with it as well.  \n\nOne opinion on the naming of Harira, is that it got it's name from the Arabic word for silk (Harir \u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631). The theory goes that it was called Harira because of the silky texture of the broth. The recipe does differ slightly when moving around North Africa, and in Tunisia it is most commonly made with seafood or fish as well as harrissa or chili powder. There it is served with crusty bread or [Brik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brik)(crispy stuffed pastries).  \n\n## Flavor Profile\nHarira has a very warm flavour profile, I'd even go as far as saying it's winter spiced. The combination of the Ginger, Cinnamon work together to give it a delicious warming flavour and it harmonizes perfectly with the meat and legumes. Using lamb here, you'll get a very slight gamey flavour which I think is perfect for this dish, but if you use beef, chicken or even vegetables in it's place I'm sure it will be delicious. Another major flavour in this soup is celery, it really compliments the warm flavour of the spices as well as the parsley and coriander. The tomatoes give the soup some depth, and while it is a tomato based soup, they are more of a background flavour.  \n\nThe texture of the soup is equally as important as the flavour. The soup itself is silky smooth to the point that you may mistake it for being cream based. Then you've got all the little pieces of Meat, chickpeas and lentils which give it a chunky texture. The meat should be extremely soft, while the chickpeas should have a little bit of bite. The lentils have a slightly pasty texture, and all together it's an extremely pleasant eating experience.  \n\n## Ingredients\nMakes 4 Large portions  \n* 250g (9oz) Finely diced Lamb or Beef. Substitute with other vegetables if making this vegetarian  \n* 200g (7oz) Finely diced tomatoes. I recommend canned  \n* 75g (2 3/4 oz) Green Lentils  \n* 75g (2 3/4 oz) Dried chickpeas  \n* 75g (2 3/4 oz) Vermicelli Noodles (Wheat not rice)  \n* 70g (2 1/2 oz) Tomato Paste  \n* 25g (3 Tbsp) All Purpose Flour  \n* 1 Medium Brown (Spanish) onion  \n* 2 Small pieces cinnamon bark or 1/2 Tsp Ground Cinnamon  \n* 1/4 Cup Minced Celery leaves  \n* 1/4 Cup Minced Parsley  \n* 1/4 Cup Minced Coriander  \n* 1 Tbsp Butter  \n* 2 Tsp Salt  \n* 3/4 Tsp Ginger Powder  \n* 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper  \n* 2 Lemons for serving  \n  \n## Directions\n1. Weigh out your chickpeas and give them a thorough rinse, then place them in a large bowl and cover with water. Soak your chickpeas overnight until they have doubled or tripled in size\n2. The next day remove the chickpeas from the water and rinse briefly before using. You should also wash the lentils as well\n3. Mince your celery, parsley and coriander very finely. Remove any large stalks before mincing and keep the celery aside as we'll use it first\n4. Dice your onion and tomatoes to a small dice so that they can dissolve into the soup\n5. Dice your meat into very small cubes about 1cm or 3/8in\n6. Place a pot on the stove over high heat and add the butter\n7. Once the butter is melted, add the meat and sear stirring occasionally until a deep brown colour and a browned fond has formed on the base of the pot\n8. Turn the heat down to medium and add the diced onion. Saute with the meat until it is translucent and softened\n9. Add some water or stock to the pot and deglaze the fond\n10. Once the pot is mostly cleaned, add the tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas, celery, cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, salt and 1.5 litres or quarts of water\n11. Bring the pot to a boil and once it boils reduce the heat to medium and cover the pot with a tight lid. Allow to simmer for 45 minutes.\n12. Once the 45 minutes are up, check the chickpeas, lentils and meat for doneness. The chickpeas and lentils should be soft but not falling apart, and the meat should be soft and cooked through. When cooked mix in the tomato paste\n13. Make a slurry with the flour and 1/2 a cup of water and stir into the pot (make sure there are no clumps before adding it in). Mix it with the soup for 2 minutes stirring the whole time to prevent it from clumping up\n14. Once the soup has thickened, add the vermicelli as well as parsley and coriander and allow the vermicelli to cook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent burning\n15. Check vermicelli for doneness and then serve the soup with fresh lemon wedges\n\n## Variations\n* There are recipes for vegetarian harira that forego the meat and start by sauteing the onions. If you want you can replace the meat with any other vegetable\n* Beef and Chicken are commonly used in place of the lamb, and some coastal cities also make a Seafood version of Harira\n* Some people make their Harira spicy, if you'd like to try that, you can use Harissa or some cayenne pepper to add heat", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/l1b8km/harira_is_a_popular_soup_from_morocco_and_north/", "created_utc": 1611156121.0, "score": 3082, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 177, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/l1b8km/harira_is_a_popular_soup_from_morocco_and_north/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Basically, what you\u2019d do is whip up a stir fry \u2013 generally speaking, something on the saucier side \u2013 and just mix your cooked rice together with your stir fry. In China, you can see the mixing approach in dishes like fantastically delicious Toishanese Youfan, and (to the best of my understanding) a very similar method is employed in Korean [Kimchi Fried Rice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k_dQU-xyHY). And for the curious, [we also have a video on mixed rice if you like](https://youtu.be/h_b8-5RYlRU).\n\nBut Korean nomenclature aside, sometimes you want a *fried* rice though, yeah? You know, something like you\u2019d get at a Chinese restaurant \u2013 dry, loose, fluffy individual grains. And if that\u2019s the end result that you\u2019re pining for, the mixing method just won\u2019t get you there - you have to actually fry the stuff.\n\nSo then enter: yesterday\u2019s rice. Compared to today\u2019s rice, that rice that you whipped up yesterday? Much dryer, especially (and importantly!) on the surface. There\u2019s still some clumping, but you can break that up in the wok. And it *works*. \n\n**Why people use day old rice:**\n\nGenerally speaking (emphasis on the general), southern Chinese meals are centered around a pot of rice. You load up the rice cooker, set it and forget it, and use that as the staple starch of the meal. Quite often, a Chinese family will use their rice cooker every day \u2013 and quite often, things end up running at a slight surplus\u2026 with leftover rice cooker rice a common sight when you open up the refrigerator.\n\nThe next day, you could just sprinkle a bit of water on the rice and nuke it, of course, but as I said before\u2026 that dry day old rice can make for a *very* solid fried rice. So in many Chinese home kitchens, you see fried rice as a \u2018next day dish\u2019 for lunch or dinner that can absorb up those leftovers.\n\nBut now, I want you to think about your personal cooking situation. Do you make rice in your rice cooker every day, or at least a couple times a week? If yes, the day-old-rice method is a go-to for Chinese home kitchens for good reason! It can be a touch finicky at times, but it\u2019s a fantastic way to use up that leftover white rice. \n\nDo you break out your rice cooker less than once a week, or [gasp!] not even own one? Can you barely remember the last time you\u2019ve had leftover white rice sitting there in your fridge? If yes, **forget about the day-old-rice method**. You don\u2019t need to dutifully plan your fried rice days in advance, because\u2026 using day-old-rice isn\u2019t even the best method for fried rice.\n\nWhat is, then, you ask?\n\n**The Steamed Rice Method:**\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways that rice was traditionally prepared in China, before the advent of the rice cooker. \n\nProbably the most common method you\u2019re already well aware of. Rinse some rice, toss it in a pot together with enough water to come up to your knuckle. Toss on a lid, cook til it\u2019s done.\n\nWorks perfectly well, but there is a slight hitch. If you\u2019re cooking a **lot** of rice \u2013 like, festival time for a big family portion \u2013 often times the final rice texture isn\u2019t phenomenal. So instead, you can use another rice preparation method: the steaming method.\n\nThe way you\u2019d do it is this: first, you par-boil your (rinsed, of course) rice. Couple minutes at a rolling boil, kind of like how you\u2019d cook pasta. You don\u2019t want the rice to be completely cooked at this stage, however \u2013 just cooked enough for the rice to have lost a bit of its transparency. You then load up that rice into a big, wet cloth, and toss it all in [one of this big buckets](https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Anti-Scald-Steamed-Restaurant-Steamer/dp/B08CN68PBM) (called \u7511\u5b50). Then you grab that big bucket, place it over a large wok of bubbling water, and let it steam. \n\nYou can still see restaurants that follow this steaming method for their white rice. Putz into a restaurant in Sichuan, often you can just scoop some yourself, at your leisure. And it\u2019s a pretty cool method \u2013 I personally quite enjoy the looser, less sticky texture of par-boiled-then-steamed rice. Not going to replace my rice cooker anytime soon for convenience-related-reasons, but it\u2019s a nice rice.\n\nBut where steamed rice *particularly shines* is fried rice. That steamed rice is awesome for fried rice is something that \u2013 back in the day at least \u2013 was practically common knowledge, stretching from the North to the Southwest.\n\nIn Li Chunfang and Fan Guozhong\u2019s \u201c\u95fe\u5df7\u8bdd\u852c\u98df\u201d \u2013 retrospective of village life outside of Beijing in the 1930s \u2013 they write:\n\n>  \u73b0\u5728\u591a\u7528\u7116\u996d\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7092\u996d\u8fd8\u662f\u7528\u635e\u996d\u6765\u7092\u597d \n\n> Nowadays, people use boiled rice [i.e. normal rice], but for the most authentic fried rice it\u2019s better to used par-boiled and steamed rice. [pg 5]\n\nSimilarly, in Huang Xiaoji\u2019s \u201c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6751\u5e84\u7684\u98df\u5355\u201d, a discussion of food in a Hunan village in the 1950s, he states:\n\n>\u5269\u996d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u751a\u597d\u7092\uff0c\u7092\u65f6\u6ee1\u9505\u9ecf\u9644\u2026 \n\n>\u8fd9\u996d\u7092\u98df\u4e5f\u597d\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u7c92\u7c92\u53ef\u6570\n\n> Leftover (boiled) rice is not good to fry, it will stick everywhere in the wok.\n\n> This (steamed) rice is good to fry, the grains will remain separate. [pg 4, 8]\n\nIt\u2019s not an uncommon approach for professional kitchens these days, either \u2013 after all, the logistics of steaming some rice for a restaurant can sometimes be a bit easier than leaving out XYZ pounds of leftover rice from service the night before.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s a method that I  - being an avid rice cooker using-homecook mostly based in urban south China \u2013 came painfully late to. As I said before, even day-old-rice fried rice can get a little finicky \u2013 you need to break up all the clumps, scrape to avoid stickage, and fry for a non-insignificant period of time to get to that loose, fluffy stage.\n\nUsing steamed rice? As the above authors imply, frying rice becomes a painfully simply process \u2013 you almost don\u2019t need to do anything. \n\n**The logistical problem of steamed rice in a western kitchen:**\n\nSo, you\u2019re convinced. Steamed rice is best for fried rice. But I can already hear a few of you groaning that this is already too much work. First boil, *then* toss into some sort of wet cloth, *then* break out the bamboo steamer, *then* fry the rice, *then* wash the damn sticky/starchy cloth?\n\nTo be completely frank, that whole process was a little annoying for me even \u2013 mostly because washing that rice cloth? Sucks royally (though my wife says I\u2019m being lazy and overdramatic). But over the years, I streamlined that process for my own kitchen, and it\u2019s something that I think can travel pretty well into the standard not-build-for-Chinese-food kitchen as well.\n\nAll you need is a fine mesh sieve, and a suitably sized pot that the fine mesh sieve can sit in \u2013 [like so](https://imgur.com/vGPyaZ1).\n\n**An overview of the Strainer method:**\n\nThis is still a slight multi-step process I know, but I promise that you can sort it all within like a half hour, give or take.\n\n1.\tRinse your rice, of course\n2.\tDump the rice in a pot of boiling water. Cook it ala pasta, 3 minutes\n3.\tStrain the rice, keep it in the strainer. \n4.\tQuickly rinse your cooking pot, and add in a touch more water (~2 inches worth). Bring to a boil.\n5.\tLay your rice filled strainer onto the pot and cover. Wrap a damp towel around the lid to \u2018seal\u2019 things closed (or wrap the strainer with foil, both are ok). Steam for 15 minutes.\n6.\tWhile everything is steaming, this is the time that you can prepare all the add-ins to your fried rice, measure your seasoning, etc.\n7.\tOnce the rice is done steaming, transfer it to a plate. \n8.\tFry your rice\n\n\n**Recipe, Scallion Fried Rice with Egg:**\n\nOk, so let\u2019s put this all together.\n\nThis method will work with any Chinese (or Thai) style fried rice you want to do, but let\u2019s just sort a super simple, bog-standard Scallion Fried Rice with Egg:\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n* Jasmine rice (\u7c98\u7c73/\u6cf0\u56fd\u9999\u7c73), 230g. Calrose is also fine. \n\n* Eggs, two medium\n\n* Seasoning for the egg: salt, 1/8 tsp; sugar, 1/8 tsp\n\n* Scallion, ~2 stalks, ~40g\n\n* Lard (\u732a\u6cb9), for frying, ~2.5 tbsp. Using lard for frying rice is particularly delicious, but you can use any oil you like. Peanut, corn, soybean, whatever. In some Japanese fried rices they use butter as a base, also tasty.\n\n* Soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), optional, ~2 tsp. If you pushed me, I think I prefer fried rice sans soy sauce, but I know a lot of people enjoy the addition. If you don\u2019t use soy sauce, up the salt quantity in the seasoning by a quarter teaspoon.\n\n* Seasoning for the rice: salt, 1/2 tsp; sugar, 1 tsp; MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), \u00bc tsp; white pepper powder (\u767d\u80e1\u6912\u7c89), \u00bc tsp. MSG is western supermarket available under the brand name \u2018Accent\u2019. If you dislike white pepper powder or don\u2019t have it on hand, you can swap for black pepper, but cut the quantity to 1/8 tsp.\n\n*Process:*\n\nRinse your rice 2-3 times. You don\u2019t need to be paranoid here (especially because we\u2019ll be par-boiling things), just a quick rinse to get off a touch of the surface starch.\n\nBoil your rice for 3 minutes. [It should look like this at this stage](https://imgur.com/96GzhID). Dump into your strainer, set aside. Give the pot a super brief rinse to get off a bit of the starch, then add in ~3 inches of water. Bring to a boil.\n\nPoke a couple holes in the rice to allow for more even heating, [like so](). Nestle the steamer in, and cover with a lid. Wrap a damp cloth [like this](https://imgur.com/PkRTmOv) around the opening of the pot so that not *too* much steam escapes (a little bit is ok). You can [alternatively wrap the top of the strainer with aluminum foil](https://imgur.com/d5y1B4q) \u2013 whatever\u2019s easiest in your kitchen.\n\nSteam for 15 minutes.\n\nAs that\u2019s steaming, prepare everything else. Toss that bit of salt to the egg and beat it thoroughly. Slice up your scallion. Toss all your seasoning in a little bowl and mix them together.\n\nOnce the times up, taste your rice. It should be completely cooked through at this stage. If you find it a touch undercooked, don\u2019t panic, just toss it all back in for another 10 minutes (it\u2019s pretty difficult to over-steam rice). Once cooked through, lay it on a plate.\n\nTo fry, we\u2019ll just use a non-stick skillet. You can obviously also use a carbon steel wok too if your prefer (a wok will give you a little more room to work with, but either is will work great). Add in one tablespoon of your lard and let it melt over a medium low flame. \n\nNow, what *we* like for our egg here is little bits of grain sized egg evenly incorporated within our fried rice, so to get there we\u2019ll drizzle the egg in while stirring, then continuously kind of \u2018smush\u2019 it to break it up. After about three to four minutes of that motion, you should be looking at something [a bit like this](https://imgur.com/wUDXvJa), which\u2019s called guihuadan or osmanthus egg in Chinese\u2026 but if you don\u2019t care, that\u2019s also fine, just scramble however you feel like it. Then just scooch that all to the side, and up your heat to medium.\n\n Once it\u2019s hot enough where little bubbles can form around a pair of chopsticks, pour the egg in a thin stream while stirring vigorously. This motion so that the egg can shred into little pieces and incorporate well with the rice \u2013 if you don\u2019t care, that\u2019s also fine, just scramble however you feel like it.\n\nOnce the egg is cooked, scooch it to the side of the skillet and add in another tablespoon of lard. Once melted, add in your steamed rice. Quickly fry the rice for a bit in the lard, then combine them together. The reason we add the lard in stages is because egg has a tendency to *really* absorb oil \u2013 if you don\u2019t care, that\u2019s also fine, it\u2019ll also totally work if you added all the oil at once in the beginning. \n\nContinue to fry for once minute, then sprinkle in the soy sauce. Stir to combine the soy sauce into the rice, one more minute. Sprinkle in your seasoning, mix well to combine. Add in the scallion, shut off the heat. Mix well, fin.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1094au5/technique_how_to_not_fuck_up_fried_rice_on_any/", "created_utc": 1673442565.0, "score": 3065, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 206, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1094au5/technique_how_to_not_fuck_up_fried_rice_on_any/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I'm here to do it.", "selftext": "It's freezing cold and I'm looking for something good to cook and came across this legend of a recipe. Its one that I discovered on reddit a long time ago. I have made this countless times in the past. Holy shit are they delicious. And the recipe, well... *chef's kiss*  just kind of speaks for itself.\n\nAnyways... this may already be out here somewhere on reddit and if it is, I'm sorry. But if it's not, then I'm not sorry at all. In these troubling times, the world needs this.\n\nAnd whoever you are that wrote it (and then sent me a copy after it got removed for some reason and i asked for one) - you've brought countless delicious bowls of Cuban Black Beans (or CBBs as I refer to them) to my belly and I'm grateful for it. I hope you're well.\n\nHere's the recipe:\n\n> ------\n> Oh my friend, it's called Cuban Black Beans. REAL Cuban black beans, not that shit they serve in restaurants.\n> \n> You get a lot of diced sweet onions and peppers (red is best balance of sweetness to price) and you cook them over medium heat in a lot of olive oil. How much olive oil? Say you have one big onion and two decent sized peppers, then I say at least a half a cup. Once the onions are softening up, you add garlic. How much garlic? ALL THE FUCKING GARLIC.\n> \n> Then you cool it down with some white wine (not too sweet, something middling). Let it steam off for a minute. What you're doing is killing the rest of that raw garlic taste and letting the alcohol in the wine bring out the rest of the flavors.\n> \n> Then you add black beans. I use canned, un-drained straight beans (don't get the kind that's labeled \"black bean soup\"). Some will tell you canned isn't as good. I say bullshit. I use one and a half times as much by volume as I have of the onion/pepper/garlic mixture.\n> \n> Simmer the beans for a bit, low-medium. Then you will add an ounce of ground cumin, a shot glass' worth of oregano, and a packet or three of Goya Sazon (if you don't know what that is, look in the Mexican/Spanish/Ethnic section and look for little boxes that say Goya). If you want to be a boss, add three or four bay leaves, but don't forget to pull them out later -- no one wants to eat a bay leaf. Mix it in well.\n> \n> Either move it to a crock pot or put it in a 225* oven. Check it every once in a while -- you want the beans to be soft. You do not want this to burn, so scrape the bottom. I'd sooner eat your shit than burnt black beans, and so would you.\n> \n> Now after a few hours taste it. More flavor? Add more cumin and Goya. Needs a kick? Add some lime. You know what? FUCK YOU, ADD LIME ANYWAY.\n> \n> Traditionally, this is served over rice. FUCK THAT. I serve it in a bowl. Maybe throw some shredded pork on that bitch. FUCK ME.\n> \n> If you use enough onions, peppers, and wine, these will be surprisingly sweet. (My Abuelita accused me of adding sugar, that bitch.) The beans, cumin, and oregano will give it a rich, earthy flavor. Goya is just magic. And the wine and lime will give just a hint of tartness. The beans, slow-cooked, are almost meaty (in a braised meat sort of way, not in a fuck-yeah-cow-meat kind of way). Once they cool down a bit, it will have a thicker texture, so let it sit for a little bit.\n> \n> Best? Eat it the next day after reheating. We make this in a four gallon vessel and gorge for a week.\n> \n> Now let's say you're having a party. You will get a bunch of dried peppers, chop them fine, and soak them in that wine (simmer it!). And you will add this goodness to the mix after the saute stage, so they soften and diffuse. And maybe some Sirracha, but only if you want to guarantee getting laid that night. Dip your immersion blender in there for a little bit -- get it half blended. Then you'll let it cool. And you will dip chips into that motherfucker and you will come back and thank me.\n> \n> ------\n>\n\n\nedit: formatting", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/s8nrws/cuban_black_beans_they_said_you_will_come_back/", "created_utc": 1642698635.0, "score": 2960, "author": "drewjy", "num_comments": 481, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/s8nrws/cuban_black_beans_they_said_you_will_come_back/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

This dip is thought to have originated in Syria, and it takes full advantage of the complex flavors you can get by roasting red peppers and toasting walnuts. Once they're combined with pomegranate molasses and a few spices, the result is a [spectacular tasting dip](https://imgur.com/a/X8ju0lK) that is Sweet, Sour and Umami all at the same time.\n\nIf you want to watch a detailed recipe video for this Muhammara, I have the [full video recipe](https://youtu.be/FetbU_N8rk8) on my youtube channel.\n\n## What is Muhammara\nAs mentioned above, Muhammara is a dip that's made from roasted red peppers and walnuts. Syria is well known in the Middle East for its red peppers, and the area surrounding [Aleppo (Syria) and Gaziantep (Turkey)](https://imgur.com/ozL7AzV) is famous for the famed [Aleppo pepper](https://imgur.com/tcFkq8k). This is a pepper very similar to paprika in terms of it's sweet and savoury flavour, albeit with a slightly hotter aftertaste (10,000 Scoville as opposed to 1000). The combination is everything you could wish for in a red pepper, and it's commonly ground up into pepper flakes or a concentrated pepper paste. These ingredient are extremely popular in Syria and Turkey where they are used in many savoury dishes. But due to the Syrian Civil War, production of Syrian Aleppo pepper has declined dramatically and in it's place the use of Turkish Pul Biber, and [Biber Salcasi](https://imgur.com/dRv15a8) have risen. This is one of the key ingredients in making Muhammara, however, I've found that it's easily replaced with either fresh paprikas, or red bell peppers and you still get an amazing red pepper dip.\n\nRather than relying on the use of red pepper paste for my Muhammara, I take Paprikas or Red Bell Peppers and roast them in my oven until charred and smokey(these would taste even nicer on a grill). Then once they've cooled down, I peel off their skin, remove the core and stalk of the peppers and then they are ready to be turned into a paste. Processing these in a blender or food processor, will result in a simple and delicious red pepper paste, that goes great in marinades and sauces for all sorts of recipes. To make it into Muhammara I also grill half an onion, and toast walnuts and breadcrumbs in a pan. Then I add them, the red peppers, olive oil, pomegranate molasses, and a few seasonings to a blender or food processor and allow everything to be mixed into a delicious red pepper dip. All that's left to do at that point is to dish it into a bowl and serve. It literally takes half an hour (15 minutes active time) to go from raw red peppers, to eating a delicious red pepper dip, and if you're looking for a simple experiment to try this weekend, maybe give this one a shot.\n\n## Cultural context\nMuhammara is considered to be a [Levantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant) food, and it's thought to have originated in the northern part of Syria surrounding Aleppo which is famous for it's Aleppo Peppers. There red pepper paste is a very common ingredient, just like tomato paste is throughout much of the world, and it's made as a way to preserve the peppers far beyond their harvest season. Due to the abundance of Aleppo Peppers and Pepper paste in the region, the local culinary scene takes full advantage of it, and dishes in the region are a bit hotter than elsewhere in the country. The same thing lies true for the area around Gaziantep (Turkey) which is a neighbouring city to Aleppo and there are many culinary similarities between their cuisines.\n\nIn some parts of Syria, Muhammara is served a little spicy, this is the case in Aleppo, however a majority of the recipes I saw did not add additional chili. In other levantine countries where Muhammara has spread, the dip can be altered with the addition of Tomato Paste and Sumac as well. This reflects the broader levantine palette flavour which doesn't primarily contain a large amount of heat.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nThe main flavour in the dip is definitely red pepper. The roasted red peppers you'll make, have a complex and deep Umami flavour with hints of sweetness, smokyness and if you get the right peppers; heat. This flavour combines well with the walnuts, which introduce a nuttiness and mellow out the strong flavour of the red pepper paste. This is then further enhanced by the Pomegranate Molasses, which itself is Sweet, Sour, and Umami, providing a deep complex tangy flavour to the dip. The addition of Aleppor Pepper (or chilli flakes) and Cumin provide additional heat to the dish. \n\nIn terms of texture, this isn't served as a creamy dip, instead it has a texture similar to a homemade pesto. For this reason it's mostly dipped into with soft flatbreads such as ultra thin Khobz or Pitta. To plate this it's common to make a well in the center of the dip, then add in Olive oil, some chopped walnuts and some additional spices or pomegranate molasses on top. \n\n## Ingredients (makes 1 bowl of dip):\n* 250g (8.8 oz) Cooked Red Pepper Flesh (from about 3-4 Red bell peppers or 4-5 Paprika peppers)  \n* 60g (2.1 oz) Walnuts (extra for garnish)  \n* 60g (2.1 oz) Breadcrumbs   \n* 1/2 Onion  \n* 4 Tbsp Olive Oil  \n* 4 Tbsp Pomegranate Molasses  \n* 1 Tbsp Tahini  \n* 1-2 Tsp Aleppo Pepper or Pul Biber or Other Chilli flakes (more for stronger heat)\n* 1 Tsp Salt  \n* 3/4 Tsp Ground Cumin \n\n#### If you'd like to make the Lebanese version, you also need:\n* 2 Tbsp Tomato paste  \n* 1/2 Tsp Sumac  \n\n## Directions:\n1. Place a pan over a medium heat, and add your walnuts to the cold pan. Toast them stirring constantly for 5 minutes. \n2. When a toasted walnut aroma emerges. Remove from the pan immediately and allow to cool. Do not let the walnuts burn or blister  \n3. Add your breadcrumbs to the pan and toast them for 5 minutes until they go a golden brown colour, remove from the pan and allow to cool  \n4. Wash your peppers and trim off their stalks, then line a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top  \n5. Place the peppers on the rack leaving some room around them, then add half an onion to the rack  \n6. Place the baking sheet under your broiler or grill for about 8 minutes, until the top surface of your peppers is charred. Remove and rotate the peppers, repeating until all sides have been charred. You can also do this directly on the flame of a grill or stove  \n7. When your peppers have softened completely and are charred all over remove them and place in a large bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and allow it to sit for 15 minutes, the residual heat in the peppers and steam will make it easier to remove their skin  \n8. After 15 minutes, remove your peppers from the bowl and peel off their skins, the open them up and remove the core and any seeds  \n9. Once the peppers have cooled you can add them and the remaining ingredients to a food processor or blender  \n10. Blitz all the ingredients together until the dip forms. This will take about 2 minutes. You can leave it running for as long as you want to get a smoother consistency  \n11. Plate in a bowl, then use a spoon to form a well in the center. Drizzle on some olive oil or pomegranate molasses, and add some Aleppo Pepper or Chopped walnuts for garnish  \n\nServe and Enjoy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lnfeyx/muhammara_is_a_levantine_dip_with_a_sweet_sour/", "created_utc": 1613739995.0, "score": 2945, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 253, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/lnfeyx/muhammara_is_a_levantine_dip_with_a_sweet_sour/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "A constructive (and hopefully educational) critique of Binging with Babish's fried rice", "selftext": "So I, like probably many people in this sub, am a voracious watcher of Binging with Babish.  The channel\u2019s well edited and a hell of a lot of fun.  The other week he made a video on Pineapple Fried Rice from the anime \u201cShokugeki no Soma\u201d, link [here](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4).\n\nI know some people use his video for educational reasons, so I just wanted to discuss some errors in his fried rice technique.  I\u2019m really not trying to be a dick here \u2013 I just think that sometimes seeing how *not* to do something can be equally if not more illuminating than seeing how *to* do something. Because of that, I wanna avoid nitpicking and focus more on fundamental flaws I saw.\n\nAgain, mediocre fried rice recipes online are ubiquitous and certainly not limited to this video. The purpose isn\u2019t to pick on Babish (Andrew? Let\u2019s call him Babish), but rather on how to improve *your* fried rice.\n\n**Mistake #1: Getting the oil smoking hot.**\n\n*Location:* [2:12 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=2m12s)\n\n*Why you don\u2019t wanna do this:* Babish repeats an old myth about stir-frying, that \u201cthe key to wok cooking is high heat, that\u2019s why they have those jet engine stoves\u201d.  It\u2019s not, and that\u2019s not why restaurants have those stoves \u2013 like in all cuisines, heat control in Chinese cuisine is fundamental and you don\u2019t wanna be rolling at full blast all the time. \n\nHeat up some oil til it\u2019s smoking and scorching hot?  As soon as your aromatics hit the oil they\u2019ll scorch and burn! I think Babish instinctively realized this, which is why he added the aromatics after the egg.\n\n*What you wanna do instead:* You don\u2019t get the oil scorching hot \u2013 you get the *wok* scorching hot.  I know it seem unintuitive, stay with me.  The basic process is as follows:\n\n* Put a dry, clean wok over maximum flame for about 30-120 seconds (depending on range strength). For reference, if you got one of those cool little temperature guns, you\u2019re looking for the surface to be roughly ~240C (470F).  If you don\u2019t, your hand should be a bit uncomfortable if placing inside the wok hovering over the bottom \u2013 something akin to steak searing temperature.\n\n* Shut off the heat -or- take the wok off the flame.  This is done because if you added oil to the hot wok on the flame it would start to smoke.\n\n* Add in the oil and swirl it around (still off the heat).  If done correctly you won\u2019t need so much oil.  Anywhere the oil swirl to will give you the non-stick surface you want.\n\n* Add in your initial ingredients, and concurrently switch the heat to what you want.  You could also turn the flame on right before or right after adding in the first ingredients. \n\nWhy do you do this? There\u2019s nothing mystical going on here. It\u2019ll preheat the wok, sure, but it\u2019s primarily because the high heat helps the oil bind to the wok to create a non-stick surface.   \n\n**Mistake #2: Crowding the Wok**\n\n*Location:* [2:52 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=2m52s)\n\n*Why you don\u2019t wanna do this:* Crowding the wok is a sin that should be familiar to you if you\u2019re experienced with deep-frying. Add to much stuff? You lower the temperature. At worst, this can lead to your ingredients beginning to sweat and releasing moisture, muffing up the whole enterprise.  Babish seems to avoid this (he is a good cook after all) by simply\u2026 not really frying the rice (more on that in the next point).\n\n*What you wanna do instead:*  Be more judicious with how much you\u2019re putting in your wok! This seems to be a common thing I see from some English-language sources \u2013 I think because people view stir-fry as a \u2018main\u2019 to feed a family with, it just doesn\u2019t lend a good \u2018feel\u2019 for what a more reasonable-portioned dish looks like (Chinese meals usually consist of a handful of different dishes). He\u2019s using this insane-looking mountain of rice in the video \u2013 he doesn\u2019t mention the exact quantity he used, but I\u2019d guess we use half that amount (~400g) while also having a larger wok. \n\nAnd speaking of which, larger woks are convenient as all hell for that very reason.  I understand that if you\u2019re not doing a lot of Chinese cooking you might not want a massive 16\u201d wok lying around your kitchen\u2026 but if you\u2019re trying for a more ambitiously-portioned stir-fry it\u2019s *almost* a must.  If you wanted to do the same quantity he was going for in the wok that he was using, you\u2019d have to split the recipe in half and do two batches.  And ain\u2019t nobody got time for that.\n\n**Mistake #3: Not actually frying the rice**\n\n*Location:* [3:07 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=3m07s)\n\n*Why not to do this:* In the video, Babish instructs to \u201ccook the rice until you\u2019re just heating it through \u2026 [add in the seasonings] \u2026 and continue to stir over high heat until everyone\u2019s gotten to know eachother\u201d.  That\u2019s not really frying rice, that\u2019s just\u2026 mixing rice with stuff.  Take a good look at [3:25 in the video](https://youtu.be/WRA3a7c4Qt4?t=3m25s): the rice is wet, sticky, and mushy.  Compare that to [this fried rice](https://i.imgur.com/uWoU8QF.jpg) \u2013 the grains are nice and separate, giving you that classic fried rice texture (that pic\u2019s 6000x4000 so you should be able to zoom in on the grains).\n\nAgain, this seems to be a common mistake.  After neglecting to properly fry the rice, many people seem to throw their hands up in their air and think \u2018I\u2019ll never be able to fry rice without a restaurant stove\u2019! Nothing could be further from the truth - with the right technique, you can even fry rice on an electric range. \n\n*What to do instead:* Your primary goal when executing a fried rice is to nail the texture. All else is secondary. We like adding the rice in right after the egg (some people save the egg for later, more on that in a second) \u2013 this gives your rice enough time to fry without too many confounding variables.\nYour goal is to get the rice dry and loose with the grains separated.  This\u2019ll take a couple minutes. It\u2019ll be ready once the rice is able to *flow* off your spatula. Because this is a little difficult to describe, forgive me for [linking to part of a video we made illustrating the method](https://youtu.be/QsHLgZhkKyc?t=5m11s).\n\n**Something that a few other commenters were calling Babish out on that I don\u2019t believe is a mistake:**\n\nThe only critiques the video received in the /r/videos reddit thread were related to his adding the egg in the first step of the stir-fry. Some commenters insisted that this would, well, overcook the egg.  And certainly, if you were making scrambled eggs and fried them with the same heat/the length of time required to fry rice\u2026 that wouldn\u2019t make a very good scrambled egg.\n\nBut we\u2019re not making scrambled eggs.  We\u2019re making fried rice.  Adding the egg first gives you sort of that \u2018osmanthus flower\u2019 kind of effect that\u2019s used at times in Cantonese cooking.  [This is a fun video in Chinese of a chef showing a guy how to make Osmanthus Flower Scallops](https://youtu.be/EUy5m-bZ_eo?t=7m1s) \u2013 check out 8:05\u2026 that\u2019s an egg that many people would consider \u2018overcooked\u2019.  But it\u2019s an awesome dish with a great texture.\n\nThank about it this way: take some beef slices and give em a super brief flash fry in oil \u2013 it\u2019ll be rare.  Cook it a bit longer and you have beef that\u2019s perfectly done.  Keep on cooking it for *even longer* and they\u2019ll eventually release moisture and get super crispy.  That last technique sounds off, but it\u2019s step one to a Sichuan Mapo Tofu!  The point is that there\u2019s not one \u2018correct\u2019 level of \u2018doneness\u2019, only different techniques that suit different dishes.  \n\nNow, that said, some people prefer to maintain the freshness and the fragrance of the egg.  That\u2019s totally cool too.  Some other egg-adding methods for fried rice:\n\n1. Pouring the egg over the rice near the end of cooking.  Not recommended unless you have a powerful stove as it has the potential to muff up that hard-fought rice texture.\n\n2. Frying the eggs separately and adding them in at the end.  Easy and solid choice.\n\n3. Scooching the rice up the sides of the wok and making a little \u2018ring\u2019 in the center for the egg to fry in, then mixing them together.  Totally cool, requires a round-bottomed wok.\n\nAgain, we also fry the egg at first.  While people can tend to be very vocal about their method of choice, it really is personal preference.\n\nAs such, there\u2019s some other random nit-picky notes (seasoning choices, frying veg together with the rice or separate, etc) I\u2019d have with that fried rice, but there\u2019s no need to get too deep into the weeds.\n\n**Cutting Babish a little bit of a break:**\n\nTo do what he does requires casting a *very* large net.  He\u2019s made videos on everything from this, to an old-school strudel from scratch, to uh\u2026 Homer Simpson\u2019s Moon Waffles.  You can see the obvious influences Kenji, Alton Brown, and other awesome resources have on his cooking.  To be one dude putting out excellent videos *every week* of the insane variety he pushes himself to execute is\u2026 nuts.  It\u2019s obvious that he needs to stand on the shoulders of giants, and that\u2019s a *good* thing. \n\nThere\u2019s good resources out there on Chinese/Asian cooking, but if you\u2019re not already familiar with cooking the cuisines they can be difficult to parse.  Popularity of Asian food in the Anglosphere has *far* outpaced the diffusion of cooking knowledge.  Put simply, there\u2019s a lot of bullshit floating around.\n\n**TL;DR:** Don\u2019t heat up your oil, don\u2019t crowd your wok, make sure to fry the rice until the grains are loose and separate, there\u2019s tons of different ways to add egg, and the videos are still cool.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/86b5lg/a_constructive_and_hopefully_educational_critique/", "created_utc": 1521722175.0, "score": 2865, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 189, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/86b5lg/a_constructive_and_hopefully_educational_critique/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

My wife just casually walked into the room and challenged me to a hot wing sauce contest in a few hours.

Thanks! \n\n**Update 1**: Well this thread became and absolute gold mine for anyone who is into buffalo wings and different sauces. Thanks so much to everyone for sharing all of your suggestions! They all sound delicious.\n\nSo my wife decided to go with a \"whatever we had in the kitchen\" approach and just made up her own thing. So instead of using an exact recipe, I stole some ideas from different posts below and just kinda \"winged\" it. These are going to be an appetizer before the game so were going to start cooking the wings shortly. I'll be sure to post pictures and info (especially who won) before kickoff tonight! \n\nUpdate 2: ALRIGHT! The wings are done. Thanks again for all of the awesome suggestions. I think were going to start a new tradition during football season next year where we make all kinds of different wings each Sunday, so these will come in handy. \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/kzZHL55) is a picture of the wings. I ended up making 2 different types of sauce. \n\nUpper left (Mine): Franks, Butter, Anaheim Pepper mixed with some Bloody Mary Mix \n\nUpper right (Mine): Franks, Butter, Honey, Corn Starch and Bloody Mary Mix\n\nBottom (Wifes): Honey, Dijon Mustard, Mayo, Coconut Oil, BBQ Sauce\n\nThey all turned out better than I expected. The upper left one turned out a little too thin and maybe a little too buttery, but definitely edible. The upper right was really good. The honey was a nice compliment to the Franks and whoever suggested corn starch was right on, it helped the sauce stick to the wing, so thanks for that tip! \n\nMy wifes was pretty sweet, but the flavor was really good. A little sweet for how I want my wings, but would definitely be a hit for someone who likes that kind of thing. It should not be a surprise to anyone that I think the W is going to my wife on this one. I am dreading watching yet another Patriots Super Bowl and this was a fun thing for us to do throughout today and kept me distracted!  \n\nI hope everyone enjoys the big game tonight, and if you're not a sports fan, at least maybe you will be in the presence of some good food!

{"title": "Greek Moussaka is famous for its richness and creamy layers, but I'd like to introduce you to it's cousin Egyptian Moussaka which should be famous for its umami and spiced flavors", "selftext": "Greek Moussaka is one of the best known Greek dishes, but it isn't the only kind of Moussaka and if you are looking for more Aubergine or Eggplant dishes then you might want to explore the Egyptian version.  \n\nAlso quick note for the american readers, Aubergine = Eggplant  \n\n## What is Moussaka and why is Egyptian Moussaka different \nPut simply [Moussaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moussaka) is a dish of aubergines or potatoes, with a  sauce that sometimes includes meat. It's common to many Middle Eastern and Balkan countries, but the most well known variant is [Greek Moussaka](https://www.realgreekrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Greek-Moussaka-500x500.jpg). In that the aubergines or potatoes are sliced thin and sauted (or fried), before being topped with a tomato and minced lamb sauce then finally being covered in a thick and creamy bechamel. The entire dish is baked and the result is a distinctively layered combination of textures and flavours that are hard to forget. Despite it's attribution as a Greek dish, it is cooked and eaten in many other nearby countries with each recipe displaying different cooking techniques and ingredients. It's likely that the origins of Moussaka lie in the Ottoman empire, but the component that makes Greek Moussaka distinct from it's cousins, is the addition of the Bechamel layer (more on that in the history section).  \n\nThe name Moussaka is thought to come from the arabic words \"Ma\" (verb: to be) \"Sakaa\" (cooled or chilled), and as it suggests the dish is sometimes served cold. In most levantine cuisines, [Moussaka is usually made with chopped aubergines](https://sparkpeo.hs.llnwd.net/e1/resize/630m620/e4/nw/4/3/l433261511.jpg) (chunks rather than slices) that are braised with tomatoes and peppers then left to cool before serving as a mezza or side dish. In Turkish cuisine a dish called [Saksuka](https://turkishfoodchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shakshuka-Saksuka-10.jpg) (not to be confused with the north african egg shakshuka) is a cold moussaka that also can contain potatoes, leeks, or beans. Balkan moussaka is usually made with layered potatoes and includes a sour cream or yoghurt topping as well as the tomato meat sauce and it's even made as far as Russia.\n\nSo with variations in how the aubergines are cut, the sauce, assembly and method of cooking, what makes [Egyptian Moussaka](https://imgur.com/a/qVXpY2j) so special amongst all the others and why should you try it? Well Egyptian Moussaka is closer to a traditional Greek Moussaka (sans bechamel) than other Middle Eastern variants. The aubergines are sliced into thick circles and fried, to achieve a crispy exterior and juicy fleshy interior, and like greek moussaka, the Egyptian one is layered then baked after assembly. But the Egyptian recipe then utilizes traditional Egyptian flavors in the tomato meat sauce (lamb or beef), this time the sauce is cooked with a large amount of Garlic, cumin, vinegar and chilli. The result is a sauce that takes control of the flavor, rather than being a minor component of the dish. Once baked in the oven, the tomato sauce reduces even further into an extremely savoury concoction that could only be described as an Umami bomb (think sundried tomatoes but tangy). \n\nEgyptian Moussaka is commonly served hot with rice or with fresh [egyptian baladi (village) bread](https://i0.wp.com/www.arabamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bread_2_2.jpg?resize=568%2C426&ssl=1), but it's also sometimes eaten for breakfast. From experience letting it sit for a day in the fridge before consuming, allows the flavors to develop even further and penetrate deep into the layers. This recipe will easily make 9-12 portions of Moussaka, and despite being fried, the lack of a bechamel makes this recipe quite a bit lighter than its Greek Compatriot. Best of all if you are hosting a dinner, you can make this Moussaka days in advance then bake or reheat immediately prior to serving. \n\n\n## History\nGiven its wide reputation as part of Greek cuisine, you'd think Moussaka has a long history as a Greek dish, but it's current form has only existed for about 100 years. In the 1920s a Greek chef Nikolaos Tselementes modernised the dish using elements he learned when training in europe (some sources say France some say Austria), with the addition of bechamel being directly attributed to him. Prior to that Moussaka was still eaten in Greece though there are no records detailing when the dish became popularised in Greece but many online sources state that it is actually of Ottoman origin. Like most of the countries that Moussaka is eaten in, Greece had previously been invaded by the ottomans, and we know that they were eating Moussaka in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1862, Turabi Efendi published the first recipe of mussaka in a Turkish Cook Book. The Turkish dish is made with aubergines, or other vegetables, cut into small cubes and a minced  meat sauce , which is similar to the modern turkish Saksuka (ShakShuka). It's possible that the greek version was adapted from the Ottoman version with the aubergine being layered instead of cubed. The origins of the ottoman version are less clear however reading through the 13th century cookbook [Kitab al Tabikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Hasan_al-Baghdadi) there are numerous recipes that combine fried aubergines (layered or chopped) with a meaty stew. Tomatoes would have been added later as they only arrived from the new world in the 16th century.\n\nIn terms of stylistic similarities between the Greek and Egyptian Moussaka, it's worth noting that Egypt and in particular the mediterannean city of Alexandria had a sizeable Greek population up until the 1970s. There was a significant cultural exchange between the two countries and it's not unlikely that Egyptian Moussaka may have been an evolution of the Greek kind, which is itself an evolution of the ottoman kind. In fact there are other dishes such as Pastitisio, which despite having similar dishes in ottoman cuisine, are recreated almost identically in Egyptian cuisine. Whichever side it originated from, it's clear the Egyptians added their personal touch to the moussaka.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nThe most significant flavor in the Moussaka is definitely umaminess that comes from the Tomato sauce, and that's because it dehydrates and concentrates it's flavors as the moussaka bakes. The sauce itself contains a significant amount of garlic and tomatoes, which is then spiced up using fresh green chillies. The addition of cumin adds some further background heat and earthiness that compliments the flavor of the fried aubergines. The addition of white vinegar to the tomato sauce gives it a tang and sourness which when concentrated in the tomato sauce really has a fantastic flavor. All together I would say the tomato sauce tastes like a vinegary and slightly spicy sundried tomato paste. It's extremely umami and really puts your tastebuds to work.\n\nThe next flavors are those of the aubergine and the meat. The aubergines have an earthy and lightly smoky flavor, and depending how long you fry them, they'll get more and more smoky. I prefer to cook mine till they are just so slightly burnt out the outside as I feel it brings the aubergines closer to the flavor of Baba Ghanoush. The meat is just a basic ground meat cooked with onions, salt and pepper and so has a simple meaty flavor.\n\n## Ingredients\n* 2.5kg (5lb) Aubergines/aubergines, try get the large black variety\n* 500g (1lb) Minced beef or lamb\n* 400g (14oz) Chopped Tomatoes, I always use canned but if using fresh go for something with a strong tomato flavor like plum tomatoes\n* 400g (14oz) Crushed Tomatoes, once again canned, I just stick it in the blender till liquidized\n* 12 Cloves Garlic\n* 1 Brown Onion \n* 2-3 green chillies, medium spice, could use fresh jalapenos \n* 2 cups Frying Oil\n* 4 tbsp white vinegar\n* 2 tbsp Lemon juice\n* 2 Tbsp Vegetable oil \n* 2 3/4 tsp salt + 4-5 Tbsp\n* 1 1/4 tsp black pepper  \n* 1 tsp cumin  \n  \n\n## Directions\n\n### To prepare the aubergines:\n\nPeeling and salting the aubergines is entirely optional, you could skip both these steps but I highly recommend them. In theory aubergines have had the bitterness bred out of them, though through personal experience just two weeks ago you still can get extremely bitter aubergines that need to be salted. Salting them will only take about 30-60 minutes and you can make the meat and tomato sauce in the mean time. I also find that salting reduces cooking time and the splatter from the oil, this is because it draws out a lot of water from the aubergines that would otherwise need to evaporate away and in hot oil can cause a lot of splattering.\n\nOn the matter of peeling aubergines, most Moussaka recipes from Egypt do not ask for peeling, here's why I do it. When you slice an aubergine and fry it, the skin does not allow the slice to contract in diameter, and as the aubergine cooks, the slice will contract in thickness instead. If you peel the aubergine, the slices are free to contract in diameter, and so the pieces will end up smaller than they were before frying them, but they will not shrink in thickness that much, which results in a better final texture. You could also peel your aubergines partially with alternating stripes of peeled and not peeled, this will allow them to contract and you'll still get some of the aubergine skin.  \n\n1. Slice the tip and root off each aubergine\n2. Peel the skin off the aubergines and discard\n3. Slice into circles about 1.5cm or 1/2 inch thick\n4. Place aubergine slices in a large bowl and sprinkle with 3-4 tablespoons of table salt \n5. Mix the aubergines until they have all been salted well then set aside for 1 hour until the aubergines have softened\n6. Discard any liquid which has drained from the auebrgines then squeeze the slices to remove more liquid from them\n7. Rinse the slices under the tap making sure to wash any excess salt off of both sides, take the time to do each one.\n8. Squeeze the slices again after washing to make sure they don't absorb any of the washing water\n9. Finally place some paper towels on your worktop or cutting board, and place the aubergines on them, then pat them dry. Set them aside for frying later\n\n### To prepare the browned beef:\n1. Dice the onion into a medium dice\n2. Add 1 Tbsp vegetable oil to a pan on medium high heat and add the onion\n3. Cook for 3-5 minutes until translucent and the onion starts to soften\n4. Mince 2 garlic cloves and add to the onion. Mix well then cook for 30 seconds\n5. Push the onion to one side of the pan then add the minced beef to the empty side and turn the heat up to high\n6. Press the meat into the pan, achieving maximum contact and cook for 3-5 minutes until browned on the first side\n7. Break the meat up into a few large pieces and flip onto the second side\n8. Cook for 3 -5more minutes, then when mostly cooked use a wooden spatula to break the meat up into small pieces about the size of chickpeas\n9. Add 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper to the meat then mix together, it's done when the beef is perfectly cooked and tender\n\n### To make the tangy tomato sauce:\n1. Add 1 Tbsp vegetable oil to a sauce pan on medium high heat\n2. Mince 10 garlic cloves and add to the oil as well as a green chilli, fry for 30 seconds until fragrant and softened but don't let them brown (make sure to pierce the green chilli otherwise it can explode)\n3. Add 1 Tsp of ground cumin and 4 Tbsp of water vinegar then fry for 30 seconds more\n4. Add lemon juice, chopped tomatoes, crushed tomatoes and 200ml or 7oz of water to the pot and bring to a boil\n5. Once it boils turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 20-40 minutes until thickened and chunky\n6. When thickened, add in 2 Tsp salt and 1 Tsp black pepper then mix and set aside to cool\n\n### To fry the aubergines:\n1. Add enough frying oil to a pan until it's about 1.5cm or 1/2 an inch deep and turn the heat up to high. \n2. Pierce 1-2 green chillies with a knife, then add to the oil and fry for a few minutes on each side till lightly golden and singed on all sides\n3. Remove and fill the pan with as many aubergine slices as it will safely fit\n4. Fry the slices for about 8 minutes on the first side till they have browned then flip them over and fry for another 6-8 minutes till a deep brown color all over\n5. Line a baking dish with paper towels and as your aubergines come out of the oil, place them on the paper towels to dry off\n6. Fry all the aubergines, then allow them to drain on the towels for at least an hour. You can swap the towels out half way through to wick off extra oil. (Please use highly absorbent paper towels that wont stick to your food)\n\n### To assemble your moussaka:\n1. Combine your meat with 2/3rds to 3/4s of your tomato sauce and mix until a thick meat sauce has formed\n2. In a deep baking dish lay your aubergines in the base of the tray until the entire base has been covered. Make sure to fill in any gaps and fill the tray from edge to edge. Overlap the aubergines slices slightly till the layer has been completed\n3. Add 1/2 of your meat mixture to the dish in a layer on top of the aubergines and spread it out to the edges until you have formed a level layer. The aubergines below should not be visible.\n4. Add another layer of aubergines on top of the meat mixture in a single even layer covering the meat fully, add your fried green chillies to the moussaka in this layer\n5. Add the remaining meat to the dish and spread it out to the edges once more till the layer below is covered\n6. Layer the remaining aubergine slices on top of the meat mixture and if you have excess slices double up or overlap the aubergines\n7. Cover the top aubergine layer with the remaining tomato sauce and spread it out evenly, then clean up any splatter from the sides of the dish \n8. Preheat the oven to 180c or 350f and bake the moussaka for 45 minutes to 1 hour until the tomato sauce has darkened and dried. \n9. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 30 minutes before serving\n\n## Notes and tips\n* Get some highly absorbent name brand paper towels for this. The aubergines will absorb oil and release it once they come off the heat, you don't want a lot of oil going into the final dish\n* Some people report success with baking the aubergines, I find they don't get any crispiness in the oven at all and so can be a bit stodgy in the final dish. If you want to try it out for yourself then feel free, and if you want to try air frying, i'd like to know how it turns out\n* I highly recommend frying in two pans at the same time, as it takes a while for each batch to be done\n* Place the green chillies to one side of the baking dish rather than across the center if you want to be able to pick them out before eating\n* When layering the moussaka, try place the larger pieces in the top layer and smaller ones in the middle layer, this way you'll get a nicely decorative top\n* Salting the aubergines speeds up the frying process and makes it safer as there is less water to cause the oil to splatter. I highly recommend you do it\n* If you have extra aubergine slices left over, fry 2 tbsp garlic and add 4 tbsp white vinegar to it, then add to the fried aubergines in a jar. This makes an amazing pickled aubergine that works wonders in sandwiches\n\n[Full video recipe here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWWdroLJVv0&feature=youtu.be)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ix0q37/greek_moussaka_is_famous_for_its_richness_and/", "created_utc": 1600696001.0, "score": 2806, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 219, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/ix0q37/greek_moussaka_is_famous_for_its_richness_and/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "I made burgers with Impossible meat last night.", "selftext": "Wegman's has been selling Impossible meat for roughly a month, though I hadn't noticed it at my location until a few days ago.  Previously, Impossible was only available via prepared foods at restaurants.\n\nIt was $9 for 12 oz.  Definitely more expensive than ground chuck or tofu, but $9 for four burgers between two people ain't bad at all.\n\nIt looks like raw ground beef that's had some stuff added to it.  It smells like extremely fresh raw ground beef that's been mixed with toasted rice -- the first thing that came to mind was genmaicha.\n\nIt's quite loose and would rather break apart than smear like raw ground beef or pork does.  I tried cooking the first one smash burger style and all I got was half of the meat sticking to my (silicone) spatula, and half of it turning into a mess in the pan.  So, make your patties beforehand folks.\n\nRound two, I slapped two pre-flatted patties into a hot, buttered pan and salted the tops.  Within a minute, there was the fabled leghemoglobin and it made me pause for a moment and chuckle as I remembered I wasn't cooking red meat.  After another minute, it was time to flip.  Took much more effort / scraping compared to red meat, but *it actually fucking browns and crisps*.  It looked perfect.  \n\nSlapped some vegan American slices on the patties, tossed on a bun, and prepared the bottom buns with vegan burger sauce in preparation for their cargo.\n\n**OFFICIAL VERDICT**\n\nAlright.  If someone else cooked this up and handed it to me and didn't tell me it was plant-based, I'd have assumed it was a solid burger with some strange can't-put-my-finger-on-it seasoning on it, *or* that it was a really tasty veggie burger.  \n\nIn the context of a bun, sauce, cheese, and other burger toppings, it's shockingly good at emulating red meat.  The texture is spot on, and it melds perfectly with all the other flavors.

{"title": "Home cooks: forget worrying about 'authenticity'. Just try it!", "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Home cooks, don't be afraid to try stuff out of your comfort zone. Nobody's judging you. \n\nMini-rant/essay: So I'm a 6-nights-a-week home cook who has been learning for about five years now. I'm not the best-- I'm not even the best person I know personally, I have some friends who are *amazing* chefs--but I'm getting to \"pretty good for an amateur\" status, and I've recently come to a realization that I hope will help others and generate discussion. \n\nOne of my hang-ups, for years, has been about \"authenticity\" in my own cooking. I grew up in a meat-and-potatoes American West kind of household. I wasn't introduced to a wide range of cuisines until adulthood. Now I'm pretty adventurous, and live in a metropolitan area that gives me access to a whole globe's worth of flavors. But ultimately, this has led to this hang-up I thought I'd share about.\n\nWhen it's come to home cooking, I'd never ventured much beyond the flavor profiles I grew up with because I knew that I didn't have anyone to teach me how to \"really\" cook \"authentic\" dishes. Why try making curry at home, I thought? I don't know how to do it properly. I just had it in my head that since I wasn't properly immersed in a cuisine I couldn't touch it as a home cook. This is probably reinforced by watching too much food television, and other things.\n\nIt is, of course, just nonsense. \n\nI'm cooking for myself and my family the vast majority of the time (and since the pandemic, all the time). I'm not inviting my South Asian friend's grandmother over for dinner. If I were, maybe homemade curry by some noob who has watched a few Youtube videos would be a poor choice. But I'm not. I'm cooking a meal for my little family. They are not here to judge my cooking against that great little hole-in-the-wall downtown the food critic raved about. They're just glad dinner is ready. And one of the biggest challenges in home cooking is getting in a rut and feeling bored. \n\nSo recently I've finally just gotten over this, and man, is it liberating. I read recipes, follow along here and on related subreddits, watch YouTube videos, and give it a whirl. Do I make the world's greatest coconut curry? Hell no. Is my bo ss\u00e4m Momofuku level? Not even close. Does my miso sauce chicken and soba noodles taste like that take-out place? Nope. Is my cochinita pibil as on point as my co-workers' wife's, who makes it the way abuela taught here? Uh... definitely not.\n\nBut... does my family like them? Yes. Yes they do. And I have kids, and they're getting exposed to stuff I never knew existed, so they'll grow up ready for whatever culinary adventure they can find. And while I'll never bring my Vietnamese immigrant friend's family over to serve them pho, as I venture into new cuisines, I am actually getting better with practice (shocking how that works). Critically, I'm not so damn bored with my own cooking. That definitely makes a difference, too, one I think my family can taste.\n\nHome cooks, in 2020, the world is your oyster. It's all out there on the internet. Ingredients can be ordered or found nearby. There aren't rules for this stuff. You're not opening a restaurant. You're cooking for yourself and the people who love you. Go for it. It's very liberating and a lot of fun.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: The excellent comment of u/OLAZ3000 prompts this addendum: I should emphasize, what I mean to say is, don't let your *fear* of inauthenticity stop you from trying stuff. Just try to do things, but I agree that there's a real virtue in **trying** to learn and do things as best you can.

Of course, the cheese that you top it with is normally parmesan.  Its classic and expected right?? Well the only cheese I had was garlic and herb goat cheese.

{"title": "A special occasion is NOT the time to be experimenting.", "selftext": "A friend of mine wanted to cook me something for my birthday a couple of years ago. I thought this was a very nice offer so I agreed. I figured he would make something he knows was very good since his father is a chef. He was 22 and I was 23 at the time.\n\nHe wanted to do it at my house since he didn\u2019t get along with his parents back then. I should have known something was off when he started asking ME if I had chicken, onions, etc. It should be assumed that everyone has the basics such as salt, pepper, and cooking pans but this was getting ridiculous that I had to supply all of the ingredients for MY birthday dinner HE offered to cook for me and I told him this. He said ok and got thin chicken cutlets, canned tomatoes, and onions himself. \n\nWhen he gets here I ask him what he\u2019s making to which he replies \u201cbaked chicken with tomatoes, onions, and spices\u201d. I think to myself, ok this is interesting to bake such *thin* chicken in the oven. I didn\u2019t want to be a backseat cook so I didn\u2019t say anything. Yet. He starts throwing spices in the pan with the chicken, tomatoes, and sliced onions. Oil, salt, pepper, oregano, *ground cloves*, *cumin*, *dill*, the list goes on. I honestly don\u2019t remember most of what he added. I asked if he\u2019s made this before and he says \u201cno but I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while and I think these spices will be really good together!\u201d  At this point I KNOW this is not going to come out very well just from the horrid spice blend. I go to pre heat the oven for him and ask the temperature. He says \u201cI think 380F\u201d and I make fun of his ridiculous temperature choice so I put it to 375. Then I ask how long to set the timer. He said 2 HOURS. I couldn\u2019t stand by anymore and said \u201care you insane? This BONELESS chicken is less than 1\u201d thick. No more than 30-45 minutes!\u201d He reluctantly agreed which further confirmed that this was not going to come out well.\n\nI made the rice because at this point I didn\u2019t trust him anymore but I didn\u2019t tell him that. My hand slipped with adding tumeric so the rice came out a little pasty. When the chicken was finished we sat down to eat and my GOD. It was so bad! The flavor profile was awful. The chicken was terribly overcooked because he wanted it to cook longer than the 45 minutes I suggested (on the longer end of my suggestion). The cloves were so overpowering. I didn\u2019t tell him I didn\u2019t like it because I knew he would be upset but he *knew* because he kept asking \u201cwhat do you think? Do you like it? If you don\u2019t you can say so.\u201d I ate as much of the chicken as I could because no matter how bad something is I don\u2019t waste meat. I kept trying to bring it back to my rice that has way too much tumeric in it but that only worked so many times. My mom joined us for dinner and was trying to be just as polite as I was and simply said \u201cmaybe use less cloves next time\u201d. Don\u2019t frigging use cloves at ALL is what I wanted to say. From that day forward my mom and I have an inside joke of suggesting to add cloves to anything to make it better, even coffee. \n\nIf you get anything from this story, let it be that a special occasion where you are cooking for others is not the time to be experimenting. Even if you\u2019re a great cook, make sure you KNOW what you are making will come out well. He has never offered to cook for me again and frankly I wouldn\u2019t want him to unless he actually learns how to cook. I know you can\u2019t get better without feedback but the input I would have given him would have made him upset because he\u2019s VERY sensitive. He\u2019s not as sensitive as he used to be so if he asked for a recipe review I would give it to him but back then it was out of the question.\n\nEdit: would like to rephrase my title: \u201cA special occasion is NOT the time to be experimenting if you don\u2019t know how to cook.\u201d\n\nEdit 2: since some of you seem to have magically analyzed our entire friend dynamic from this one little anecdote in my life, just know that I\u2019ve put up with A LOT of shit from my friend, as a good friend should, so please refrain from inputting your opinions on what makes me a good friend or not because you would be singing a whole other tune if you only knew :) this is a funny story that I clearly see many of you can relate to and I hopefully will have saved one person from making the same mistake as my friend.

And even barring all that, here on Reddit I\u2019ve found that almost anyone that brings up that outdated anti-MSG sentiment is sure to get a bevy of replies talking explaining how it\u2019s completely harmless.\n\nSo, you\u2019re convinced. You accept the scientific consensus. So you go on Reddit, swing over to /r/cooking or our more illustrious older brother /r/askculinary\u2026 and sensibly ask this collection of pros and hobbyists how best to cook with your newfound crystalline umami powder. \n\nAnd at this point, when I read some of the responses, I think it becomes enormously clear that we live in a food culture that has almost no first hand experience working with this ingredient (of course, we\u2019ve got a lot of first hand experience with eating it in our junk food). It feels almost like the equivalent of asking a family of nomads from the Kazakh steppes their best advice on eating bluefin tuna. Some of the stuff I\u2019ve heard:\n\n>*MSG is magic. It will make everything more delicious.*\n\n>*I use a mix of 3 parts salt and 1 part MSG and just season everything with it.*\n\n>*MSG is basically super salt. Super salty but super good.*\n\n>*I add a bunch to my rice water before making rice. So good.*\n\n>*It\u2019s a salt substitute. Use less salt, more MSG.*\n\n>*Nothing better than a steak seasoned with MSG after a good hard sear.*\n\nEtc etc. Going back and looking at some of those threads, there was definitely some good advice in there too, but you\u2019d have to wade through some uh\u2026 less than informed answers. \n\nOf course, quick note that I am **far** from an expert on, well, anything. And when it comes to taste? There\u2019s not really any such thing as an objective truth anyhow. So if you happen to be that dude that adds MSG to their rice water, I might disagree but your opinion is *just* as valid as mine is (and I guess I *haven\u2019t* cooked rice in MSG water, so hey, I prolly shouldn\u2019t knock it until I try it lol).\n\nIt\u2019s just that as we\u2019ve done these recipes, as we\u2019ve worked towards trying to nail down \u201cthat restaurant taste\u201d\u2026 we\u2019ve become pretty well versed in how **we** like to use MSG.  I probably toss in at least a sprinkle in about a third of the dishes I cook. So I figured that it might be helpful to some give some general guidelines in how *I* tend to think about the ingredient in case you\u2019re new to using it. And again, I\u2019m no chef \u2013 don\u2019t take my word as gospel. I\u2019m just a dude on the internet after all. But if you\u2019ve followed some of those recommendations online and been less than impressed (e.g. Adam Ragusea\u2019s experience), maybe circle back and give these tips a whirl if you get the chance.\n\nThe way I\u2019ll split this up is in two sections \u2013 first, some general tips on using the ingredient; and second, how to apply those by making a classic Sichuan dish from Leshan called, well, MSG Noodles. [There\u2019s also a video to go along with the second part](https://youtu.be/WviFA0f7ySg), if you\u2019re so inclined.\n\n# **How to Use MSG:**\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s set our expectations straight.\n\nMSG is not magical yummy powder. It will not make crap cooking taste great \u2013 if it did, Applebees would\u2019ve been adding it to anything and everything *years* ago. It\u2019s in junk food, for sure, but there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s in junk food besides MSG that makes it addictive (lots of fats, sugars, and other flavor enhancers). You can\u2019t sprinkle MSG on celery sticks and expect them to taste like a dry aged steak after.\n\nOpen your bag of MSG. Put a couple crystals on your finger. Taste it. *That* is the taste that\u2019s going into your dish \u2013 you add your MSG right at the end, so it\u2019s not going to change that much in the cooking process. If you\u2019ve never tasted MSG before, don\u2019t have a bag in front of you and want to follow along\u2026 I like to describe the taste of MSG as \u201cfish sauce minus fish\u201d.\n\nSo then, how to use it? I\u2019m going to give you a short answer, followed by a long, rambly answer.\n\n**The short answer:**\n\n1. *MSG can enhance and draw out the natural umami in other umami rich ingredients.* Not sure what ingredients are umami-rich?  [Check out this list on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami#Foods_rich_in_umami_components).  I think most people by now are familiar with the umami that\u2019s given by fish sauce, dried shiitake mushrooms, or even aged cheeses. The umami in, say, fresh mushrooms or tomatoes is often a bit less obvious. So if you add a bit of MSG to your roasted tomato sauce, or your mushroom stir-fry, it really highlights that aspect \u2013 at least according to my taste buds. \n\n2.  *To balance spicy food*.  This is my personal favorite application of MSG.  MSG works really, really well with spicy food - you already have a pretty overpowering flavor, and MSG rounds it out with a sort of 'richness', for lack of a better word.  It's used quite a bit in Sichuan food for this reason, but I also love tossing some into my otherwise bog-standard extra-spicy Buffalo Wing sauce. I should also say that I think the inverse is also true: spiciness also balances MSG. If you find yourself in a jam after adding a bit too much MSG (more on that in a second), a bit of cayenne pepper helps bring things back to life.\n\n3. *MSG can be used in savory dishes to help \u2018mellow out\u2019 flavors, ala granulated sugar.* This is a very difficult thing to describe, but MSG can help round out a dish. I\u2019ll\u2026 explain more in my \u2018long answer\u2019 below.\n\nAs for how much to use? For use #1 and use #3, a really small sprinkle. Don\u2019t overdo it \u2013 if you add too much, it\u2019ll kinda give the dish that sort of one-note \u2018processed food\u2019 kind of taste. Let\u2019s say no more than 1/8 tsp per each ~500g of food. It\u2019s a strong flavor.\n\nFor use #2? You can potentially get away with a **lot** more. Because as I said, MSG balances heat but heat also balances MSG. For some Sichuan dishes, you can load things up with as much as a teaspoon per serving.\n\n**The long answer:**\n\nLet me start this ramble with a question and a pet peeve.\n\nPet peeve first. I kinda hate this meme that goes around that \u2018why do we even bother with bay leaf? I\u2019m pretty sure it doesn\u2019t actually do anything\u2019. \n\nIf that attitude describes you, try this: take a bay leaf, put it in a mug, and soak it for ten minutes in hot, boiled water. In a separate mug, add just water. After the time\u2019s up, drink each cup of water. Can you tell the difference between the two?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got functional taste buds, it shouldn\u2019t even be a question. It\u2019s absurdly obvious. While bay leaf\u2019s a bit stronger of a smell than a taste, that smell is unmistakable.\n\nObviously, when it goes into stews and such, it slides into the background. It\u2019s never mandatory \u2013 if I was making a stock and forgot the bay leaf, I\u2019d never throw my hands up in the air and say \u201cFuck it! Can\u2019t cook this without my bay!\u201d But bay leaves are cheap (especially dried), so if you\u2019ve got some around, why not? \n\nMost dishes have *layers* of flavor, after all. Adding a touch of bay leaf can help give things some depth, make things less one note. It\u2019s not the only way to skin that cat, but it\u2019s one way.\n\nNow for the question: why is black pepper used to season almost every Western dish? \n\nSalt makes sense. It\u2019s a flavor enhancer. We need it to survive.\n\nBut black pepper? Seems a little weird, right? How did we seem to arrive at this one singular spice \u2013 why aren\u2019t there, say, clove shakers next to the salt shakers at the table? And I mean, it\u2019s not like black pepper\u2019s always a dominant flavor \u2013 not every dish is Steak au Poivre. \n\nAt the risk of completely butchering this explanation, I\u2019m going to turn to Francois Chartier from the book *Taste Buds and Molecules*:\n\n> Recent studies have demonstrated that chilis [and black pepper] provoke in us more than a simple sensation of heat. Their sapid molecules create a temporary inflammation in our mouths, thus increasing the sensitivity of the taste buds and the mucous linings.\n\n> This increased sensitivity applies to temperature, touch, and the tactile or irritating aspects of some ingredients such as salt, acidic flavors, carbon dioxide, and cold.\n\n> This explains why once we are affected by the presence of capsaicin or peperine \u2013 the prickly molecule in pepper \u2013 our sense of taste becomes quite sensitive. This leads to the impression that the air we\u2019re inhaling is cooler than it is, and the air we\u2019re exhaling is a lot warmer.\n\nSo as is implied here, you don\u2019t necessarily *need* to season with black pepper \u2013 capsaicin does the trick too. This is why you\u2019ll see some people seasoning with a touch of hot sauce in certain parts of the US, or why Chef John likes to season with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Basically anything that contains any relative of capsaicin would do the trick \u2013 ginger can serve much the same function. \n\nNow, anyone familiar with \u201cseasoning\u201d knows that it can consist more that just salt and pepper. I think a lot of people understand that a spritz of lemon or a swirl of vinegar can waken up a dish, and that a sprinkle of sugar in a savory dish can kind of help round things out. These terms \u2013 \u201cwaken up\u201d/\u201dround out\u201d \u2013 are delightfully vague, so forgive me for not going through the motions of what their scientific basis is (if they have any at all). But it seems to be a workable framework nonetheless.\n\nSo to bring things together: when seasoning, it\u2019s important I think to understand the laying of subtle flavors. When you add black pepper or MSG to a dish (or bay leaf, or garlic, or ginger etc etc), with very few exceptions the purpose isn\u2019t make a dish taste overwhelmingly of pepper or MSG or garlic or bay leaf. \n\nWhen I first started cooking, \u2018seasoning\u2019 to me meant adding salt until something tasted salty enough. Nowadays, I think of salt as just one *dimension* of seasoning. It\u2019s one tool you\u2019ve got in the toolbox. I think there\u2019s really five components:\n\n1.\t*Salt.* Of course.\n\n2.\t*Pepper -or- chilis -or- ginger.* Helps waken things up.\n\n3.\t*Vinegar -or- dry wine -or- lemon.* Acids also help to waken things up, albeit in a bit of a different direction.\n\n4.\t*Sugar.* Helps round things out. Balanced by vinegar/lemon.\n\n5.\t*MSG -or- fish sauce.* Or other umami rich ingredients soy sauce/anchovies too, arguably (I don\u2019t find those ingredients as purely umami as MSG and fish sauce).  Also helps round things out. Balanced by peppers/chilis/ginger.\n\nSo just like how with some dishes you might want to waken things up with a bit of lemon, at other times you might want a splash of pure vinegar. And while there\u2019s a subset of cooks that seem to turn their nose up at MSG (\u201cHrumph I use *real* ingredients like fish sauce\u201d), it, like vinegar, can often do a great job at delivering an isolated seasoning.\n\nOf course, some ingredients give you a mix. Worcestershire sauce gives you acid/umami, a vinegary hot sauce gives spicy/acid, etc etc.\n\nIf you ever want to play around with seasoning, I think a bechemel-based cheese sauce for Mac N\u2019 Cheese is the perfect canvas. You start with something rather plain, then add cheese. Then once that cheese\u2019s melted\u2026 it\u2019s your job to taste and adjust it until it\u2019s perfect to your taste buds. Take your time with it. Add enough salt until it\u2019s suitably salty. Add some cayenne and/or white vinegar and/or hotsauce until you no longer get that sort of overwhelming richness that you can sometimes get in a cheese sauce. Then add a sprinkle of sugar to balance those acids, and a sprinkle of MSG to round things out/add depth/highlight the umami of the cheese.\n\nI don\u2019t know if any of that actually made sense, but that\u2019s just kind of how I like to think about things. I could be off my rocker a bit \u2013 again, not a chef or anything.\n\n# **How to make Sichuan MSG Noodles:**\n\nOk, so this\u2019s a pretty interesting dish from the town of Leshan (about 2-3 hours south of Chengdu). It\u2019s one of the great food cities in Sichuan, and is the originator of a few classic Sichuan dishes (most notably perhaps, the \u2018mala tang\u2019 hot pot with small skewers).\n\nThis dish was invented in the mid 1950s, back when MSG was still a bit of a novelty in Sichuan. A local chef named Liu Zong Xiu added a healthy spoonful of MSG alongside her house chili oil to spruce up her vegetarian noodles\u2026 and it became sort of an instant classic.\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n1.\t*Alkaline noodles, preferably fresh; in an ideal world, fresh Sichuan-style gungunmian (\u68cd\u68cd\u9762), 150g per serving.* This dish uses a fresh alkaline noodle called \u201cgungunmian\u201d which\u2019s slightly on the thick side. I\u2019ll give you a super brief rundown on how to make it if you\u2019re into trying a noodle project (we also show you how to make it in the video), but you could use some proper Japanese ramen noodles for this too. Fresh are preferably, but if you\u2019ve got dried they can also work in a pinch.\n\n2.\t*MSG (\u5473\u7cbe), \u00be tsp per serving.* So for the most part MSG is MSG, but you\u2019ll find two types different \u2018grain sizes\u2019 of MSG \u2013 the one that look like larger crystals (almost as large as like small sprinkles), and the smaller sort that\u2019re a bit more of a \u2018jagged powder\u2019. With this kind of recipe where the MSG isn\u2019t dissolved, it\u2019s best if you use the latter. The former can totally be used too, just do a bang up job mixing them into the sauce (or give them a quick crush beforehand).\n\n3.\t*Sichuan-style Red Chili Oil (\u7ea2\u6cb9), 1 tbsp per serving.* So I shared a recipe for Sichuan style chili oil [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/6y7dkr/recipe_how_to_make_sichuan_dan_dan_noodles_%E6%8B%85%E6%8B%85%E9%9D%A2/) a while back, and the always excellent ChinaSichuanFood\u2019s got a recipe [here](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/chinese-chili-oil/) if you\u2019d like another resource to compare/contrast. Don\u2019t feel like undertaking a chili oil project? Hey, times are rough, understandable. Try swapping that with some Lao Gan Ma chili crisp, spooning a bit more oil than crisp. It definitely won\u2019t be the same thing (so don\u2019t tell anyone from Leshan we said it was ok) but it\u2019d be tasty too. If going that route, cut your MSG quantity in half, as Lao Gan Ma\u2019s already packed to the brim with it.\n\n4.\t*Suimi Yacai, Sichuanese pickled and fermented mustard green (\u788e\u7c73\u82bd\u83dc), 1 tbsp per serving.* So in Leshan they actually have a special sort of Yacai, which\u2019s a bit sweeter and uses only the stems. It\u2019s nice, but we tested this with the more common abroad Yibin Suimi Yacai too (it\u2019s available on Amazon, I swear), and it totally works. Can\u2019t find yacai? While you might be starting to flirt with \u2018no-longer-a-Leshan-MSG-noodle\u2019, you could play around with other sorts of Chinese pickles, like zhacai or Tianjin preserved vegetable. Can\u2019t find any of those? Screw it, charge right on ahead without, it won\u2019t be the same but you can still make a tasty noodle.\n\n5.\t*Sugar, \u00bd tsp per serving.*\n\n6.\t*Light soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd), 1 tsp per serving.*\n\n7.\t*Sliced scallions, 1 tbsp per serving.*\n\n\u2026 and that\u2019s it! Basically a list of the most common \u201cSichuan noodle\u201d usual suspects. Differs from stuff like Dan Dan Noodles or Yibin Burning Noodles primarily in just how hard it leans into that chili oil/MSG combination.\n\n**Process:**\n\nI\u2019ll be totally honest, I\u2019m running out of breath a bit after that \u201chow to use MSG\u201d essay. So I\u2019m going to just cheat and give you a super high level overview of how to make Sichuan-style gungunmian. \n\nFirst, know that the dough itself is basically exactly the same as the noodles for [Yibin Burning Noodles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ercib1/recipe_how_to_make_sichuan_burning_noodles_plus/) \u2013 there\u2019s a slight difference in shape but that\u2019s pretty much it. \n\nMix \u00bd tsp of sodium carbonate -or- Jianshui/Kan Sui into 90g of water, then knead that together with 210g of break or noodle flour (preferably, but AP does the job ok too). Knead or use the stand mixer with the hook for 8 minutes, then rest it for a half an hour. Flatten it out, pass it through a pasta maker ~6 times, folding the dough over itself in either halfs or thirds each time. Then pass it through again at the second widest setting, then on the 3rd widest setting, and finally cut it by cranking it through the narrow slice on your pasta maker (~2mm wide).\n\n1.\t*In a bowl, mix together the MSG, the chili oil, the yacai, the sugar, the soy sauce, and the scallions.* Really try to make sure the MSG is dissolved into the chili oil/soy sauce.\n\n2.\t*Boil your noodles for ~1 minute until just past al dente, quick strain, then immediately toss in the bowl together with your seasoning.* ~1 minute is for the Sichuan-style gungunmian. Especially if using dried noodles, simply follow the instructions on your noodle package.\n\nThe straining should be super quick here (like, a couple shakes is fine) \u2013 don\u2019t let these sit out for long. As soon as they leave the pot, your shot clock\u2019s ticking. If you find them sticking a bit too much, and tough to mix, you can add a touch of water to help loosen things up a bit.\n\nNow, I know a \u201ctwo step recipe\u201d isn\u2019t usually quite our style, so you can also eat this together with [a classic Chinese pork-bone-and-kelp soup](https://youtu.be/OA1pLCtZX2w) if you like. Drink the soup alongside the noodle, but you can at the same time toss some kelp strips and eat it all together.\n\nAnother option is a bit of sliced cabbage \u2013 you can toss that in and cook it alongside your noodles (if using fresh noodles), or toss it in near the end if opting for dry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/fjjbyp/how_to_actually_use_msg_plus_a_recipe_for_sichuan/", "created_utc": 1584357338.0, "score": 2701, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 151, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/fjjbyp/how_to_actually_use_msg_plus_a_recipe_for_sichuan/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "To those who have recently gotten into roasting vegetables - now try stir fry.", "selftext": "As a Chinese person I was always baffled when served Western-style vegetables; usually steamed or boiled in water with just salt as seasoning. Try getting into stir-frying your veggies in a heavy-bottomed pan or a wok. It's much faster than roasting vegetables, and you can add a multitude of spices, garlic, green onions, liquids, all during the cooking process at varying times to get the most out of each flavouring.\n\nFor stir-frying vegetables your biggest enemy is water, preventing you from browning the veggies and getting them crispy. If you're cooking a water-heavy vegetable like mushrooms, frying them in a lot of oil or first cooking to draw out the moisture and then searing will help you get that roasted mushroom flavour. \n\nOftentimes I start off the stir-fry with some sort of protein, throw in some soy sauce and other seasonings, and sear it in the pan until it has a crust. Slightly undercook it. Then scoop it out and throw in your veg and stir-fry at max heat, tossing and turning very frequently. Add back the meat to complete an entire dish that can be paired with rice.\n\nBIGGEST tips for making stir-frys taste amazing: put minced garlic in towards the end (browning the garlic in my opinion suppresses the freshness and flavour of garlic) and use COOKING WINE. Holy crap cooking wine just adds this amazing slight sweetness and aroma. I'm pretty sure they use this in traditional Chinese restaurants in pretty much all their dishes. Throw in some chicken powder too for that umami.\n\nI guarantee you that when done right, stir frys are just as good, IMHO even better, than roasted vegetables.

The USDA, which is in charge of regulating food safety, has very little power to enforce is recommendations. Almost all chicken produced in the US is from two companies, which handle all aspects of chicken production from feed to processing, so there's no incentive within the industry to hold each other accountable at any step in the process.\n\nPlease be careful with handling raw meat and avoid cross contamination. If you are able to, try to buy from small farms, and ask them about the conditions they raise them in and where and how they are processed. \n\nWe're super lucky to be living in a time and place with access to many great antibiotics, and to have kind of collectively forgotten about the awfulness of diseases without them. However, there are more and more drug resistant strains of bacteria developing, and not as much research into developing new antibiotics as there was when they were first developed. Ideally, there would be better industry regulation to try to prevent it from happening, but until then, it's on consumers to protect themselves.\n\nEdited to add:\nPropublica also provided a tool that lets you look up the percentage of salmonella contamination at a processing plant, using a number found on the chicken package.

In my view, it was a task that was time consuming, specially because of the cleaning I'd have to do after so i always thought \"I could be doing something else\". But at the same time I was also getting saturated to eat the same predictable food from the same take-away restaurants near my place or the simple quick pasta I used to make.\n\nBy then, I came up with this silly idea: I'd pick a letter at random , and that letter would indicate me a country. Next I'd pick another letter at random and that letter would indicate the name of a dish from that country in that country's language . So for example if I get first letter \"U\" and second letter \"S\" , I could pick United Kingdom -> Shepherd's Pie to make or if I got \"B\" and \"F\" I could get \\[Brazil -> Feijoada\\] to make. Mind you, I was a person with zero cooking skills, so this would be quite the challenge, but as a programmer I believed I was able to at least follow a recipe correctly :)\n\nFirst weeks were fun and surprisingly I enjoyed, even with all the work to clean after. I did not mind spending 2 hours in the kitchen anymore. Something about the unpredictability and surprise factor of what I was gonna eat made it an attractive hobby. Even searching around on the web about the dishes available for each country was exciting. So for 2020 my resolution was to keep that challenging going, but make it more like. life style and do it at least once a week.\n\nThere were a lot of challenges along the way of course and many mistakes I did and with that a lot of learning. Great part of the challenge was in to find all the ingredients necessary for a specific recipe, not always easy. I started going to asian groceries a lot...could easily spend 1 hour there to find one simple ingredient because I had absolutely no idea where it would be on the shelves :D . Another recipe asked for rabbit meat which is quite uncommon to eat here where I live (Sweden), so I ended up on a 6 hours train trip to a farm in the middle of nowhere just to get a rabbit. That recipe alone cost me about \u20ac200. SO MANY different flours! I learned the hard way you can't just replace one by another and expect to work the same. So many ingredients bought online and had to be imported. Right now my kitchen is like this magical place with all sorts of stuff from all around the world.\n\nI documented everything I did, and you can see all the recipes [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXdttAchqFEm4HPMUps9VN0R1xVbyQyKsK8PDxiWdRg/edit?usp=sharing) if you are curious. Don't mind the ugly look, I'm planning to change that soon and have even more statistics in there too and more data.\n\nI'm actually starting to build a web/app now that will replace the sheet with a nice UI/UX to display data and statistics at ingredient level as well and some functionalities like for example finding available recipes for me on the web by giving the letters as input so I don't have to do it manually, and also to find recipes based on the ingredients available (so I make better use of what I have and avoid waste).\n\nDecided to share my story with you guys, and also to ask suggestions if you guys have any cool idea what else I could do either in terms of the hobby itself or for the app Im making of ir you have any suggestion of good websites that categorize recipes by country, please let me know :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ks0sch/my_cooking_challenge_of_2020_ended_up_making_150/", "created_utc": 1609977916.0, "score": 2626, "author": "Instrumedley2018", "num_comments": 176, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/ks0sch/my_cooking_challenge_of_2020_ended_up_making_150/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Vent - People are ungrateful.", "selftext": "My love for cooking is fading. I used to love it. Part of me still does. I try very hard, try not to serve any frozen meals or prepackaged crap, yet I have grown to despise cooking for ungrateful people. \n\nMy parents favorite meal is veal parmesan and pasta. So I said okay, I can make that, I\u2019ll make some raviolis. My mom immediately chimes in and goes \u201cOh yes I love ravioli! I want a mushroom stuffed one with brown butter sauce.\u201d I said \u201cI was really hoping I could just serve it with marinara. Since I\u2019ll be making so much for the veal and making a whole separate sauce and cooked filling is a big ordeal.\u201d\nShe became disappointed. \u201cUgh fine, just make a cheese one. But don\u2019t use the cheeses that no one likes.\u201d \u201cI was gonna do some ricotta and parmesan, maybe some mozzarella.\u201d \u201cThat sounds good. Still would be more flavorful with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms but whatever.\u201d \u201cWell then saut\u00e9 some mushrooms.\u201d \u201cYou know I don\u2019t know how to use the pasta maker. So whatever, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll taste fine.\u201d\n\nShe says she wants a caesar salad. I say okay, I\u2019ll make the dressing for it. I say \u201cI wanna make some cheesy garlic bread with it. I really enjoy that with my meal.\u201d She says \u201cUgh, you made that like 2 weeks ago. I\u2019m sick of it already. Can you make me that other bread (focaccia) instead? Just like a small one, for me.\u201d \u201cNo, I can\u2019t just make a separate bread just for you. I didn\u2019t think it was so sufferable to make garlic bread with cheese on it. And I haven\u2019t made it in a few weeks. It takes a few hours start to finish but I really like it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m running a restaurant for a 47 year old able-bodied woman. I think I\u2019m gonna stop cooking for awhile. Just make myself sandwiches and stuff. Feels like a waste to cook for people who don\u2019t even say thank you afterwards. \n\nUPDATE -\n\nHey everyone! I just wanted to update a bit. \nFirst of all, THANK YOU. This thread has been making me feel so much better. Not only have some of you shared recipes, but you have listened and given me great advice. I do not want to stop cooking. \n\nSo tomorrow night I am making dinner. \n\nI\u2019m making veal parmesan, ravioli, and garlic cheese bread. I told my mother she is welcomed to join, but that I will not change my recipes. She is free to take what she likes and enjoy if she chooses. If not- then too bad. \nShe has apologized. I expressed to her that I can no longer take her criticisms and refuse to allow it. This isn\u2019t Hell\u2019s Kitchen I\u2019m running here, and that if she doesn\u2019t want to be grateful for what I make, that\u2019s her choice. \nIf she wants to help I\u2019ll tell her what I need help with. I told her I am tired of hearing that \u2018her way is better\u2019 just because it\u2019s different. When I was a kid I did not tell her the right way to cook for me. I said \u201cYou taught me to be grateful, to have manners, yet you\u2019re acting so childish.\u201d She said \u201cYou are right. I like having meals with you and you are a very good cook. When I criticize it\u2019s cause I think I\u2019m being helpful, but I realize I\u2019m just hurting your feelings. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nI just let her know that I am not a baby. I have my way of doing things. I can show her how I do things and when she cooks for me I\u2019ll respect how she does things. She has to learn that I am a grown woman now, I will not parent her and I deserve to be respected MUTUALLY. I do not have to subject myself to constant criticism just because \u2018she raised me.\u2019\n\nI hope the veal comes out good. I\u2019m excited to chow down on garlic bread. Time to start kneading.

{"title": "Time for me to lose all my karma, but lamb (in general).... is better than beef.... I'M SO SORRY!!!", "selftext": "This may sound like the dumbest statement to ever be made on a serious cooking forum and I get it people.  But I think if you look deeper into it you may notice a few things you didn't before. :)\n\n1. The first reason I'll give for lamb being superior to beef is how bulletproof it is.  I've had well done ribeye and well done lamb chops and rack, and 100% the lamb chops were better by tenfold.  Lamb is still tender at stupidly high temperatures.  Another example is lamb roast, I don't have to cook it for 6 hours to make it tender because it's already a very tender cut of meat in general. \n2. Now I never had this problem but everyone says that lamb is \"oh it's so gamey\" or \"it smells\" and because of that it apparently tastes bad.  THAT'S NOT TRUE!!!  I'm Afghan and we eat LOTS of lamb so I guess I never noticed the flavor.  But recently I went to a trip in the mountains of turkey.  We stayed in a village with a population of 16!  There they gave us lamb freshly butchered and that's when I noticed that gaminess.  I think it's because the lamb in that village actually ate all grass unlike America's \"grass fed\" meat.  And to my surprise I was in love with that strong lamby flavor.  It's kind of like why we like ribeye, that beef flavor is super strong and meaty.  Same with the gaminess your tasting, so I could be biased but I think that the gamy taste does not only not make lamb worse than beef, it makes it better!\n3.  Ease of cooking.  Lamb is so much easier to cook compared to beef!  I'll spend 5-6 hours to make perfectly tender roast beef (not ribeye of course) vs 2-3 hours for a not super tender cut of lamb.  And I still end up liking the lamb more.  Lamb chops and lamb rack are a million times easier to cook than beef cuts like t-bone and ribeye because you don't have to worry as much about what temperature I cook it to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell these are my thoughts let me know what you think.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/oze553/time_for_me_to_lose_all_my_karma_but_lamb_in/", "created_utc": 1628279474.0, "score": 2572, "author": "SoaringCourage1", "num_comments": 627, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/oze553/time_for_me_to_lose_all_my_karma_but_lamb_in/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Pro Tip: Lower your refrigerator's temperature", "selftext": "I'm a certified food safety manager and have been for decades (for my job) and I like to cook. I often hear complaints from my friends that \"we had to throw away a bunch of food because it spoiled\" and \"my milk went bad before the expiration date.\" I want to share how you can avoid a lot of this. I'll keep it simple, but if you want a more detailed explanation, just ask.\n\nTemperate plays a huge role in bacterial growth that leads to spoilage. Many people feel that keeping the temperature at a \"reasonable\" setting, usually 40-45 degrees Fahrenheit, is a good balance between keeping food cold and saving money on electricity. Wrong. Food doesn't simply go bad on it's own. Bacteria breaks it down. The higher the temperature, the faster bacteria multiplies (and it does so exponentially in relation to temperature) and spoils your food. We all know that freezing food will allow it to remain good for extended periods of time. Why? You're significantly slowing bacterial growth.\n\nBy lowering your refrigerator's temperature to 33-35 degrees F, you will effectively increase the shelf life of your food, sometimes well beyond its expiration date. Food can be expensive. Electricity, not so much. You will save money, but more importantly, the risk of food-borne illness will be greatly decreased.\n\nSo please lower your refrigerator temperatures. Also, I didn't know this was a thing, but it is. If you buy products that need to be refrigerated, go **directly home** and put them away immediately. The longer they stay out of temperature, the greater the risk of spoilage and potentially getting you sick.\n\nEdit: As suggested by a few people, having an additional thermometer in your refrigerator is an excellent idea. Never rely on the built in unit. Also I made a phone call to verify that milk should be stored at 41 degrees and eggs at 45 degrees or lower. Preferably not at freezing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/hcdq8y/pro_tip_lower_your_refrigerators_temperature/", "created_utc": 1592618517.0, "score": 2531, "author": "Lazonby", "num_comments": 385, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/hcdq8y/pro_tip_lower_your_refrigerators_temperature/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "You've had grilled cheese sandwiches, but have you had grilled meat sandwiches? Lebanese Arayes are flatbreads filled with seasoned meat kofta, then grilled. The result is mind blowingly delicious", "selftext": "After the Koshari recipe, I really wanted to do something simple but delicious to show that not all Middle Eastern recipes require a crazy amount of work. These Arayes or Pita Pockets are so easy to make and pack so much flavor for a recipe that takes all of 20 minutes to put together. \n\n\n## What is Arayes\n[Arayes](https://imgur.com/a/wf2ekpS) are pockets of Pita bread that are filled with a traditional seasoned meat Kofta filling. [Kofta](https://recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Lamb-Koftas_7.jpg) is common to nearly all Middle Eastern cuisines and it's a mixture of seasoned ground meat (usually lamb or beef, but sometimes chicken or even fish is used). To cook Kofta, the mixture is formed over skewers and then grilled over charcoal or in a pan. In contrast to make Arayes, you fill a Pita bread with the raw kofta mixture, and then grill it bread and all. This results in an amazing texture and flavor combination as the bread chars on the outside, and the meat inside cooks to perfection. As the meat cooks it slowly releases its grilling juices directly into the bread both seasoning and moistening it. Once cooked you can eat them straight away and like most grilled meats, these are amazing straight off of the grill. The combination of super crispy bread and perfectly juicy grilled meat is one you really need to try.\n\nMost Kofta fillings in the Middle East contain Meat, Onions, Garlic and Parsley, the one we'll be making for the Arayes also contains Pomegranate Molasses for an extra layer of flavor. Arayes are considered a Levantine food and it most commonly shows up in Lebanese cuisine, so this one I've put together is a Lebanese recipe. Other Arab countries also have their own versions of stuffed flat breads, most notably is the Egyptian Hawawshi which contains a spicier meat filling. After you've made this traditional recipe, I'd highly recommend making your own custom meat filling, you could easily make a Tex Mex inspired one with lots of cumin and ground beef. \n\n## Cultural Context\nThis is one of those dishes that doesn't seem to have an origin story at all and so I thought I would tell you the tidbits I could gleam about this dish. Arayes actually means brides in Arabic, and I literally have no idea why the name is fitting for the dish. They're eaten throughout the Levant (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq) and because of that, nearly every country in the region lays some sort of claim to having invented the dish. For the most part there are difference in how the Kofta filling is put together in each country. \n\n## Flavor Profile\nThe main flavor in the dish is the Grilled meat, and if you are using beef, well it's similar to a burger. The addition of onions and parsley to the meat gives it a herby and slightly sweetened background flavor, which is complemented well by the addition of Boharat and Pomegranate molasses. The pomegranate molasses adds sweetness and sourness to the meat and rounds out the dish. The final flavor that really stands out here is the flavor of the grilled bread. \n\nIn terms of texture you can end up with two different scenarios, if you've purchases [Pita bread that is on the thicker side](https://www.justalittlebitofbacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/homemade-pita-bread-for-submission.jpg), you'll end with a crispy bread exterior and a soft and juicy meat interior. If on the other hand your bread is on the [thinner side](https://www.maureenabood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Pita-bread-3-POST.jpg) (like this lebanese bread), then it tends to soften and steam, and it ends up similar to the wrapper of a steamed dumpling. The addition of onion to the meat mixture helps it tenderize and moisten the meat from within as it cooks, resulting in a satisfyingly soft meat texture.\n\n## Ingredients\n5-6 Pita Breads or 6 Lebanese bread  \n500g (1lb) Minced Beef (or you can use lamb), get 80% meat : 20% fat, but 70:30 is ideal if you can find it  \n30g (1oz) Parsley  \n1 Medium brown onions  \n1-2 Garlic Cloves  \n1 1/2 Tbsp Pomegranate Molasses  \n25-50g Beef Fat or 2 Tbsp Olive oil  (this is to increase the fat ratio, leave out if you want)\n1 Tsp salt  \n1/2 Tsp Baharat (this is a Middle Eastern spice blend, but if you don't have this you can use all spice instead)  \n1/4 Tsp Black Pepper  \n1/4 Tsp Cayenne or chilli flakes\n1/8 Tsp Cinnamon  \n2 Tbsp Olive oil for brushing the bread\n\n## Directions\n### To make the meat filling:\n1. Add your Onion and parsley to a food processor or blender, and process till very finely chopped\n2. Crush the garlic cloves and add to a mixing bowl with the meat, onion mixture, pomegranate molasses, beef fat/olive oil, salt, baharat, black pepper, cayenne/chilli flakes and cinnamon. Mix together thoroughly until a uniform mixture forms\n3. Cook a small piece of the meat in a pan and taste for seasoning. Adjust if necessary\n\n### To prepare the Arayes:\n1. First thing, test if your bread is fresh and you can easily pull the two layers apart, if not then microwave it for 30 seconds until piping hot, alternatively you can heat in a pan flipping occasionally. Don't separate the two layers just yet, you want to keep your bread intact\n2. Slice your bread in half (if oval shaped) or into quarters (if circular) and then use a knife to pry both sides of the bread apart, you should open it from the seams where you sliced it and not the outer edge of the bread. Once you've managed to pull the two sides apart, open your bread up until a pocket forms or until you could easily get the filling in there\n3. Add a few tablespoons of the meat filling to each pocket and massage it to the edges and back of the bread. For thicker pita aim to have the meat filling about 1cm (1/3in) thick, or 1/2cm (1/6in) thick for the paper thin Lebanese bread. Stuff the bread pieces till you have used up all of your meat mixture\n4. Using a brush, or your hands, coat the surface of each stuffed pitta bread with olive oil until liberally oiled\n\n### To cook the Arayes:\n1. Preheat a grill pan (or a real grill) on medium high heat and when ready add your Arayes\n2. Grill for 4 minutes and then flip once they start to sizzle (thinner bread will take about 3 minutes per side, on a real grill cook using a low heat)\n3. Cook for the same amount of time on the other side and then remove from the pan\n\nPrepare a simple sumac chopped parsley and onion salad and serve the Arayes\n\n\n## Notes and tips\n\n* Kofta is commonly known as Kabob (in the US) and Kebab (in europe), despite Kebab being the name given to grilled pieces of whole meat and not ground meat (ground is always called Kofta). In Turkey the rules regarding naming are also different. \n* If you want to make an approximation to Egyptian Hawawshi, add some more chilli flakes, baharat and two finely diced tomatoes\n\n\n[Video recipe for Arayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71E4N87x4q0&lc=Ugy7fs-pbnObcLka-mZ4AaABAg.9D9H7vWPVDx9D9MPFcBeCX)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/img2m6/youve_had_grilled_cheese_sandwiches_but_have_you/", "created_utc": 1599226676.0, "score": 2450, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 202, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/img2m6/youve_had_grilled_cheese_sandwiches_but_have_you/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Bread pudding gets a bad rep for being soggy and mushy, so in Egypt we make Om Ali instead. It's a pudding that's made with pastry then topped with nuts for a simple yet delicious dessert. Full recipe inside", "selftext": "Om Ali (also spelt Umm Ali) actually means Mother of Ali, and it's a dessert that you'll find at any feast or large gathering in Egypt. It's a very simple bread pudding that is made with a sweetened milk mixture, and generous servings of clotted cream. Unlike most bread puddings, this is instead made with pastry and once baked, it is topped with all manner of nuts, sultanas, and even coconut. [Om Ali](https://imgur.com/a/xMe31aM) is truly a regal dessert in texture, flavour and potentially origins, and it's definitely something you should try out.  \n\nIf you want to see how I make Om Ali, or prefer video recipes, check out the [full video recipe here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymyODEXOR9Q)\n\n## What is Om Ali\nThe simplest way to describe Om Ali, is a bread pudding that uses pastry instead of bread. This is traditionally made with [Goulash](https://turkishstylecooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/gullac_yapragi2.jpg) (A pastry similar to filo, not the dish I covered last week) pastry sheets, which are baked and then soaked with sweetened milk. The benefit of using pastry, is that it will absorb some of the sweetened milk without developing a soggy and mushy texture like bread does. Personally I forego the Goulash pastry, and instead make this with either Croissants or Palmiers, which I toast before soaking in the milk. I find that the puff pastry used in those goods ends up with a very similar texture to the Goulash, while the crispy-ness of it, helps to give the pudding structural integrity. When the pastry has been soaked, it's added to an oven proof baking dish then topped with a healthy amount of clotted cream. Before it goes under a broiler, it's sprinkled with sugar and then allowed to caramelize and form a crystalline skin on top. Once it comes out of the oven, it's topped with your chosen toppings then served while steaming hot.\n\nIt's an extremely simple recipe, that is easily customised by the toppings added to it. It's common to add lots of nuts to the dish, such as hazelnuts, flaked almonds and pistachios, which provide the pudding with a crunchy contrast to the soft texture. Adding sultanas or raisins is also common, and they provide a squishy texture with bursts of fruity sweetness. You'll commonly encounter Om Ali at weddings and parties in Egypt, as it's a common buffet food and easy to make in large quantities. My mother in law likes to make it for family feasts when we have a large number of guests, but in my household we make it when we are having a Middle Eastern themed dinner. Despite it's easy recipe, a lot of people purchase Om Ali from a local dairy store, these are just like green grocers, except they sell everything related to dairy (Cheese, Yoghurt, Milk, Cream, Puddings, Butter). Another common place people get Om Ali, is from pudding shops. There's a number of chains operating throughout Egypt, that you can pull your car up to and get a drive through Om Ali, or Rice Pudding (My kind of drive through). \n\n## Cultural Context\n\nThe theory goes that Om Ali which means mother of Ali, is named after one of [Sultan Izz al-Din Aybak's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aybak) wifes who had a son called Ali. Izz al-Din Aybak, was the first sultan of the Mamluk Sultanate (1250-1517). When the Ayubbid dynasty (Saladin's Dynasty) fell in 1250, [Shajarat al Durr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shajar_al-Durr) became the first Sultana (Female Sultan, not the fruit) to rule Egypt. The Syrian Emirs refused to pay homage to her, and so Izz al-Din Aybak married her and was installed as Sultan. Some time later a conflict between them arose, and in the fashion of sultans, Shajarat al Durr had the sultan assassinated in his bath by his servants. She was arrested and then beaten to death by the servants of Al-Mansur Ali (One of Izz al-Din Aybak's sons) and his mother (she's Om Ali). The pudding gets it's name from Al-Mansur Ali and his mother, who it's said, ordered the palace chefs to make a pudding to celebrate the new Sultan and had it distributed to the public. \n\nDespite it's supposed regal origins, Om Ali is very much a dessert of the people. It's quite cheap to make, and it's common for the nuts to be replaced with cheaper varieties such as peanuts to save on costs. Egyptians have a strong sweet tooth and winters get quite cold, so the popularity of a hot pudding is no surprise. Of course modern twists on Om ALi are made, I've seen some with cocoa flavored milk, and you can even get Om Ali with ice cream for a hot and cold mix..\n\n\n## Flavor Profile\nA spoon full of Om Ali, will have a number of different textures on it. First there will be the crispy texture from the top layer of pastry, this is usually coated in a thin layer of sugar which adds a crunchy sugar texture similar to creme brule. Then you'll have softened pastry, which will have absorbed some of the milk, but will still retain it's shape and will not be soggy. You'll also have some of the sweetened milk mixture on your spoon, which if you use a high quality milk, will have a creamy and silky texture. Then there's the crunchy textures you get from the nuts, and the squidgy textures from the sultanas. Together it's a wonderful mouthful of alternating textures.\n\nIn terms of flavour, the milk is supposed to have a creamy buttery flavour, while being quite sweet. My recipe is not as sweet as others I've tried, and it uses brown sugar as well as white sugar for some caramel notes. Most of the flavour you get will come from the nuts or sultanas you choose to use. Hazelnuts and flaked almonds are the classic choice though you can also use pistachios instead.\n\n## Ingredients \n\n### Om Ali (Makes 4 large portions or 1 family size serving):\n* 450g (16 oz) Croissants or 400g Palmiers (Bakery croissants will probably be denser than grocery store croissants, so you may need 600g)  \n* 1L (33 fl oz) Whole Milk (High Quality, preferably jersey cow or buffalo)  \n* 250ml (8.5 fl oz) Extra thick cream or clotted cream (High quality, preferably jersey cow or buffalo). You can also add cream to regular milk for a similar texture  \n* 75g (2.7 oz) Brown sugar + extra for dusting  \n* 75g (2.7 oz) White sugar  \n\n### Toppings:\n* 50g (1.8 oz) Hazelnuts  \n* 50g (1.8 oz) Almond flakes  \n* 50g (1.8 oz) Sultanas  \n* 25g (0.9 oz) Dessicated Coconut  \nYou can use any nuts or other fillings you like  \n\n## Directions\n\n### To prepare the croissants:\n1. Using a bread knife slice the corners (ears) off of each end of your croissants\n2. Slice the body of the croissant in half and then slice it into bite sized chunks\n3. Line a baking sheet with grease proof paper, and place your croissant pieces on it in a single layer. Turn them so the inner part of the croissant is facing up\n4. Place the sheet in the oven to bake at 180c (350f) for about 6 minutes, until all the croissant pieces have browned and dried slightly\n5. Repeat until you have done all the croissants\n\n### To prepare the nuts:\n1. Peel your hazelnuts and remove any of the brown skin\n2. Using a knife chop the nuts into large chunks\n3. Place the nuts on a  baking sheet lined with grease proof paper and bake at 180c (350f) until toasted\n4. Remove immediately from the tray and allow to cool\n\n### To prepare the milk mixture:\n1. Add the milk to a large pot on high heat\n2. Add in both the brown sugar and white sugar, and stir the pot, allow to come to a boil\n3. Once it boils and foams up, remove it from the heat and use immediately\n\n### To assemble the Om Ali:\n1. In an oven proof baking dish, place your baked croissant pieces. I prefer doing individual servings.\n2. Add any toppings you want to include over the top of the croissant pieces\n3. Add enough milk so the pastry is just barely emerging from it. You can add more croissant pieces if necessary to get it to the right depth\n4. Spoon over as much of the cream as you can and then top with some more brown sugar\n5. Set your broiler to low and place the puddings beneath it\n6. Once the cream has melted and the surface of the Om Ali has caramelized, remove it from the oven\n7.

{"title": "Cooking is an art, baking is a science...", "selftext": "... is a popular saying that is an absolute crock. They're both a mix of both. Cooking may seem more forgiving, but so is baking (even if you have to wait to see the end result). Yes, small changes in ingredient amount or quality can cause vast differences in the end product, but the same is true for just about any other dish you could possibly make - hell, a pot roast, properly marinated and cooked just an hour longer can mean the difference between a succulent main dish and a chewy hunk of gristle.\n\nAnd there's so much Art to baking! Not even talking about presentation (fondant is pretty but it's just old icing and it doesn't taste good) - getting a good feel for a bread dough or pie crust or cake batter and adding a little extra flour to thicken it just a bit, kneading a loaf to perfection and dusting it with a smidge of flour before its final rise, massaging cold fat into cold flour before gently patting out a tray of fresh biscuits... there's a lot of feeling and intuition that goes into good baking that can make it a fun, meditative, or even romantic process.\n\nI think a lot of the \"oh it's an analytic chemistry process\" stuff comes from people who messed something up early on and got burned, but learning from your mistakes and CORRECTING them is half the fun of cooking! it may feel like a lot of wasted effort, but you're a goddamn kitchen alchemist and you need to practice to work your magic. Not to mention the science behind \"regular\" cooking practices like searing, braising, stir frying... it's all a mix of food science and experience.\n\nNow candy-making is the real hardline stuff. If you're making something more complex than peanut butter balls and you let the syrup get ten degrees too hot, the muffin man himself will come to your house, kick your dog, and screw your wife while berating you for your foolishness.

But I'm a 19yo student and I moved to my first apartment in December. I haven't eaten out even once since then since I've wanted to cook for myself so I keep improving. But I'm spending waaayy too much money overall so I have to start cutting down the grocery costs. \n\nSo today, I made it my challenge to find the cheapest pack of meat I could find and I wanted to buy as few ingredients as possible. So I bought some really cheap beef-pork ground meat and I had seasonings, cream, parmesan and tagliatelle. I thought I would make some pasta bolognese or something, but that would take crushed tomatoes and I didn't want to spend the extra 85 cents lol My expectations were low.\n\nSo I browned the meat, and used salt, black pepper, chili flakes, some random grilling seasoning and soy and fish sauce as seasoning. It smelled really strong, but I knew it would smooth out after adding the cream. After adding the cream and tasting, I added a little more pepper and grilling seasoning. And then it was time for the cheese, I used a lot lmao And then I just added in the al dente tagliatelle. Really cheap and easy, but I loved it so much that I wanted to go for seconds (but I didn't because that would kinda defeat the purpose of this challenge) haha\n\nTLDR; I made something really tasty with very little money and it's all thanks to the practise since the pandemic :) And yes, I suck at writing short posts haha", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lfev24/cooking_really_is_a_life_improving_skill/", "created_utc": 1612800057.0, "score": 2388, "author": "CreatureWarrior", "num_comments": 187, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/lfev24/cooking_really_is_a_life_improving_skill/", "html_title": ""}

It's basically like eating grass. This is *not* what you want to use for your cooking. Russian tarragon is the only seed you will ever find in any of those little seed packets. \n\nMexican tarragon can grow from seed, but good luck finding these seeds. Its flavor is stronger than the Russian variety, closer to, but not exactly what we are looking for when we think traditional \"tarragon\". It's an acceptable substitute for the real thing. \n\nFrench tarragon ***CANNOT*** grow from seed because it produces sterile flowers. There are many sources to confirm this, [here is just one](https://web.extension.illinois.edu/herbs/french-tarragon.cfm). It can only be propagated through root divisions from existing plants.

It's eaten throughout the Middle East as well as Greece, Azerbaijan and many other countries in eastern Europe and western Asia.

It's a normal site to walk into a [Baklava store and see 20+ different varieties](https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/baklava-shop-istanbul-turkey-traditional-600w-1292856532.jpg) for sale, from the [classic layered pistachio baklava](https://sweetsweetsyria.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/B.jpg), and [clotted cream filled ones](https://i0.wp.com/albiladdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B4%D8%B7%D8%A9.png?resize=710%2C331&ssl=1), to [rolled pistachio filled konafa](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3o0klCXsAcMTAk.jpg) and [small birds nests](https://www.doughculture.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Imads-Syrian-Kitchen-birds-nest-edit.jpg). I always end up walking out of baklava stores with an [assorted box](https://www.kiwansweets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/massara-mix-baklava-350-700-gram.jpg) filled with numerous different types, each differing from the other in shape, size, filling and texture.  \n\nIn this post I'll be focusing on my favorite kind of baklava, [Mabrooma or Burma Baklava](https://imgur.com/a/aiS9Dn2), which differs from most other kinds in shape and preparation method. Rather than layering multiple sheets of Phyllo pastry, a single sheet is laminated, covered in nuts and then rolled into a cylinder. It's then sliced into bite sized pieces before baking. This technique results in a crazy good textural experience because unlike normal baklava, the nuts are actually incorporated into the lamination and end up between every single layer. Once cut to size it makes the perfect bite sized treat, in Egypt it's common to get Mabrooma Baklava the thickness of a pinky finger and in Turkey it's usually made a bit thicker. You could use pistachios, walnuts, almonds or your favorite nut in this and it will turn out great.\n\n## History\n\nBaklava has a complicated and well fought over history, with numerous countries claiming to be the origin or claiming to have invented its modern form. One claim is that a precursor dish to Baklava was made in the Assyrian Empire as far back as the 8th century BC, where layers of thin dough were stretched over chopped nuts then coated in honey. The story then goes that the Ancient Greeks fell in love with the dish and invented phyllo dough (which means leaf to signify the thinness) in the process. Other claims state that the ancient Greeks invented the dish themselves. In Al Baghdadis 13th century cookbook he describes a dish Lauzinaq, which was made from almond paste wrapped in pastry (\"as thin as grasshoppers' wings\"), this dish lends credence to the Assyrian claim, but it's also likely that both origin stories are true.\n\nEventually the dish landed in the kitchen of the ottoman empire where it evolved and flourished, the reach of the empire grew far and wide and so did the reach of Baklava. If you overlay a map of the former ottoman empire, you would see that baklava is eaten in nearly all the countries it invaded. It's also said that copious amounts of baklava were served to Janissaries during Ramadan in a ceremony called the baklava procession as a sign of the sultans favor, and the acceptance of the Baklava by the Janissaries indicated they were satisfied with their pay and conditions (the Janissaries had some crazy culinary traditions such as never abandoning a pot on the battlefield).\n\n## Flavor Profile\n\nIn any baklava the key flavor comes from the nuts that are used. The common choices are Pistachio, Walnut and Almond, so those are going to be the largest contributor to flavor in the Baklava. Getting high quality nuts is essentially, you do not want any burnt, or over roasted flavors in your baklava as there's no place to hide. My personal favorite is using toasted walnuts, as the flavor is mellow and less intense than pistachios or almonds. If you are going to use pistachios, get [antep pistachios](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRmu0bR2R0n04wtNy4RoKmm-UwFQjldI3gBIw&usqp=CAU), these have a natural bright green color and an almost citrusy flavor from their oil. \n\nThe phyllo pastry has a very neutral flavor with a slight baked aroma when it has been cooked. The phyllo will also taste quite buttery, owing to the butter that is brushed between the different layers\n\nThe rest of the flavor is imparted to the Baklava via the syrup that is poured over it. This is either made from honey (quite rare) or a simple syrup which is infused with spices. Depending which part of the world you're from, you'll use different spices in your syrup. In Greece it's common to use Cloves, Nutmeg and of course cinnamon. In Turkey the syrup is usually spiced with just cinnamon. In other parts of the Middle East you will find Cardamom, Rose water, Orange blossom water and even saffron used to infuse the syrup, but In my recipe I go for the basic cinnamon syrup to allow the nuts flavor to really shine through.\n\n## Ingredients\n\nI highly recommend doing a 50:50 split between pistachios and walnuts for your baklava, you'll get two different flavors and be able to decide which one you like more. They also look slightly different as the pistachio's oil tints the phyllo pastry to a slight green color. On the subject of pistachios, you can use any variety of pistachios but I would look into getting some Antep pistachios as they have a super distinctive green color and they taste quite a bit brighter than California or Iranian pistachios. These are the ones you see in photos with the almost fake looking green color, they really are worth it.  \n\n### For the Sugar Syrup:\n250g (1 1/4 Cup) granulated sugar   \n  \n150g (2/3 Cup) water  \n  \n1/2 Tbsp lemon juice  \n  \n1 Cinnamon scroll or 1/4 Tsp Cinnamon powder  \n\n\n### To make the Baklava\n500g (1lb) fresh Phyllo (Filo) dough  \n  \n250g Butter  \n  \n200g antep pistachios or Walnuts, though I did a 50:50 split  \n  \n  \nNot an ingredient, but you'll need a thin cylindrical rod or dowel to roll these, it makes the process infinitely easier. Check the notes for ideas on what you can use. You can do this without the dowel, but it will be harder to get the roll started and compress it  \n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the sugar syrup\n1. Add the sugar, water and lemon to a pot on high heat and bring to a boil, avoid stirring the pot as this can cause the sugar to crystallize\n2. When the mixture is boiling, swirl the pot to ensure all the sugar has dissolved. If some formed on the top of the syrup then skim it off. When the sugar has dissolved then turn the heat down to low\n3. Add the cinnamon scroll to the syrup and simmer for 10 minutes until it has thickened slightly\n4. Remove from the heat and pour into a jug or bowl to cool\n\n### To make clarified butter:\n1. Add your butter to a pot on high heat and let it melt completely\n2. Boil the butter for a couple of minutes until the milk solids separate (literally looks like milk, you'll know it when you see it), and then pour it out into a jug. The milk solids will have sunk to the bottom of the pot, so when you're pouring, do it slowly and make sure not to pour them into the jug\n3. After half an hour pour into another jug or vessel to remove any remaining milk solids\n\n### To prepare the nuts\nYou have two courses of action here, you can mince them by hand, or you can chop them in a food processor. The end goal here is to make Pistachio or Walnut meal, so you want tiny pieces of nuts, but not a powder. Think couscous or bulgur grains.   \n\nIf you're chopping them by hand, it will take some time, but just keep folding your nuts back into a pile and chopping till you get an even texture. If you're using a food processor, pulse it on and off till you get the desired texture, be careful because if you over process the nuts, the oils will separate out and you'll end up with nut butter.  \n\n### To assemble the Baklava:\n1. Grease the base and walls of a baking dish (30cm * 20 cm) with some of the clarified butter\n2. Place a sheet of phyllo on a cutting board and cut in half (mine measured 35cm * 25cm, if yours are smaller you may not need to do this), then brush one half with clarified butter all the way to the edges. Make sure to coat all edges and corners of the sheet otherwise they will crack when rolling\n3. Place the other half sheet on top of the buttered one to laminate, then massage out any air pockets or wrinkles till perfectly flat. If there are any holes or tears in your sheets, try to rotate the sheet so you don't have two tears lying on top of each other\n4. Brush clarified butter to the top of the sheet you just applied until fully coated, and once again make sure to get the edges as well\n5. Turn the sheet on its long side and sprinkle 2-3 teaspoons of nuts [over the sheet](https://imgur.com/rIjviuk). Try to keep the bottom quarter of the sheet relatively clean as this will make it easier to roll. Pick out any large pieces of nuts that fall onto the sheet as these can tear the phyllo\n6. [Place a rod (check notes) at the bottom of the sheet leaving a 1 cm gap and fold the end of the pastry over the rod. Roll the pastry around the rod then keep rolling forward until your pastry has been wrapped around the rod](https://imgur.com/PnB2w93)\n7. With a roll of pastry formed on the rod, place a fist on either side of it and [slide the two sides towards each other](https://imgur.com/2T1iOAE). Think of it like trying to compress a spring. Do it until the pastry has been compressed to about 2/3rds its original size\n8. Once compressed, twist the pastry gently to loosen it from the rod, then slide it off of one end. Place it inside the baking sheet and bunch up any excess on the sheet to one side\n9. Repeat steps 2-8 until the baking sheet is full\n\n### To cook:\n1. Line up all your pastry cylinders so they run across the narrow side of the dish, and make sure they are lined up evenly.\n2. Use a sharp knife to [trim any excess pastry](https://imgur.com/dt5wv5h) that is sticking upright on the dish. You'll likely have extra on all the different rolls as it's hard to compress them uniformly. Remove the excess pastry from the dish\n3. You now need to pre cut the baklawa as it will be too crispy to cut later. Use a ruler to get even measurements. [Measure 1 cm from the walls of your dish](https://imgur.com/oVxwE8u) (at the start and end of your baklawa cylinders), and cut a line through all the different pastry cylinders there so you nice and clean edges on all the pieces of baklawa. Next [divide the remaining length](https://imgur.com/oiHH1X2) into three or 4 pieces and slice through them as well.\n4. Brush the top of the cut baklava with more clarified butter\n5. Preheat an oven to 160c or 320f, and bake the baklava in there for one hour\n4. Remove from the oven when golden brown all over, and immediately pour your syrup over the baklava. It should sizzle as it hits the pan and starts to be absorbed into the hot pastry\n5. Allow to cool for a minimum of half an hour, but it will taste better if you let it sit overnight (make sure to cover it with plastic wrap otherwise the pastry will go stale)\n6. To decorate, remove any trimmings from the edges. Drop more chopped pistachio in a line onto each piece of baklava \n7. Serve and enjoy\n\n\n## Notes and Tips\n* If you have clarified butter or ghee, you can use that instead of butter as it's already been clarified to remove the milk solids. The reason you don't use butter is that the milk in it can burn quite easily while baking the baklava and you'll end up with a burnt butter flavor which we want to avoid.\n* Store bought phyllo can be very hit and miss, so I recommend buying two different brands even if you only need one pack. You could always make borek or spanakopita with the extra. Try find packs with a recent expiry date\n* I found packs of chopped pistachios at a Turkish supermarket which was perfect for the Baklava, maybe you can try look for it as it'll save you a lot of time\n* I used a 3mm wooden dowel as my rod which I got from a hardware store, you can also find them at arts and crafts stores. If you can't find that, you could use any other thing wooden or metal cylinder. Some people suggest using the rod part of a clothes hanger\n\n[Full video recipe for the Burma Baklava](https://youtu.be/nPW4rhqeOEw)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/iqun4k/if_you_think_layered_baklava_is_good_wait_until/", "created_utc": 1599843998.0, "score": 2296, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 142, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/iqun4k/if_you_think_layered_baklava_is_good_wait_until/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My love letter to pantry pastas", "selftext": "I feel like we get a lot of questions about what to keep on hand in your pantry/fridge so I wanted to share six of my go-to pasta sauces (plus a couple more that I don't like but maybe you will) which can all be made with 11 ingredients that are really easy to keep around. All of these recipes come together in like 20 minutes and are almost impossible to mess up.\n\n#The Ingredients\n\n1. **Whole peeled canned tomatoes.** The best tomatoes are generally what end up whole in the cans plus they don't have any firming agents that can keep them from cooking down nicely. imo no point in springing for San Marzano most of the time. I'd recommend Muir Glenn in the US or Mutti in Europe. Keep a few cans around always\u2014obviously they're not going bad anytime soon.\n2. **Tomato paste.** The tubes are handy if you'll be using little bits somewhat frequently. I think ATK recommends Cento for this one in the US. I use Mutti again in Europe.\n3. **Garlic.** It's garlic. You know the deal. Keeps for a couple weeks at least somewhere cool and dry.\n4. **Yellow onions.** Yellow onions are mildest and best for cooked applications imo, but feel free to use white or red if that's how you get your jollies. Also keeps for a couple weeks.\n5. **Shallots.** Even milder than the yellow onions. In a pinch, you could use onions in all the recipes that call for shallots. Or shallots in all the recipes that call for onions if you've got that Rockefeller money *Also* keeps for a couple weeks.\n6. **Lemons.** Nothing fancy needed. Just plain old lemons. If you like the zest, maybe spring for organic. They keep a week or two in the fridge.\n7. **Heavy cream.** Heavy cream or heavy whipping cream both work\u2014just make sure it's not sweetened. Generally lasts about two weeks.\n8. **Parmigiano reggiano.** Get the real stuff in its whole form\u2014no ground up shit. It can be DOP if you want but doesn't have to be. There's plenty of great parm out there that isn't DOP-certified (but none of it it sold by Kraft). I personally prefer a 24-month most of the time, but a more complex 36-month has its charms too. It'll last quite a while wrapped up in the fridge.\n9. **Pecorino romano.** Another grating cheese, but quite different from parm in flavor. While parm is more about nutty umami, pecorino brings more saltiness and a hint of tang. I'm probably in the minority here, but if both cheeses were in a burning building and I could only save one, I'd save the pecorino. You *can* substitute them for each other in a pinch but, like I said, they're not all that similar.\n10. **Guanciale or pancetta.** Guanciale can be challenging to find outside of Europe, but it's worth the effort to track it down. (I think you can even order it on Amazon). It's fattier, sweeter, and milder in flavor than pancetta, but pancetta is much easier to find so you can sub that if needed. You can freeze either for quite a while. Just cut into thickish slabs (roughly \u00bc\" or 0.5cm) and separate with wax paper then keep it in the freezer. You can cut it into lardons straight from the freezer (it's way easier that way actually) and use it without thawing.\n11. **Vodka.** Alternative uses: getting you drunk. Lasts forever.\n\nI'm also assuming that you have some real basics on hand already. Namely salt, black pepper, chili flakes, olive oil, and butter. You'll need the actual pasta too. I recommend De Cecco across the board.\n\n#The Recipes\n\n1. **Basic tomato sauce/arrabbiata.** (Tomatoes, garlic, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). My basic quick tomato sauce is actually based on [Serious Eat's arrabbiata recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/penne-pasta-arrabbiata-sauce-recipe.html). If you don't like spice, you can dial the pepper back as much as you like. This works with just about any shape. Penne's a classic, but casarecce might be my fave. Also great on [homemade gnocchi](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/03/technique-fresh-ricotta-gnocchi-fast.html).\n2. **All'amatriciana.** (Tomatoes, onion, pecorino, guanciale/pancetta, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). This is hands down the king of pasta sauces in my book. The pork fat takes everything that's great about tomato sauce and turns it up to 11 with minimal added effort. I use Marcella Hazan's recipe, which you can find [here](https://cookingfrombooks.com/2014/05/12/pasta-allamatriciana-2/). The only alteration I make is I render and crisp the pork first (starting in a cold pan) and *then* add the onions. idk why Marcella never seems to brown meat. Bucatini is supposedly the classic with this, but in Italy I've seen it much more with mezze maniche and I prefer it that way. That's a tough shape to find though, so you can sub something like rigatoni.\n3. **Alla gricia.** (Pecorino, guanciale, black pepper, olive oil). Alla gricia is basically the midway point between all'amatriciana and cacio e pepe. Once again, I think the pork really improves on cacio e pepe. While it's fine to sub pancetta in the last recipe, I think this one suffers a bit more from the substitution. I recommend the [Serious Eats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pasta-alla-gricia.html). As with all'amatriciana, mezze maniche or rigatoni is the move.\n4. **Cacio e pepe.** (Pecorino, black pepper, olive oil, butter). Is it as good as alla gricia? Despite being much more well-known, I'd say no. But sometimes you can't find guanciale or just can't be assed to render it. Cacio e pepe to the rescue. Once again, [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/02/spaghetti-cacio-e-pepe-recipe.html). Keep in mind that legit pecorino is very salty, so don't oversalt the pasta water. If all pecorino is too much for you, experiment with using part parm. Spaghetti is the way to go for this one.\n5. **Alla vodka.** (Tomato paste, shallot, heavy cream, parmesan, vodka, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). Somehow this sauce hits all the exact same comforting notes as boxed mac and cheese (I mean that in the best way possible). I really like the [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fusilli-alla-vodka-basil-parmesan) recipe. Fusilli is awesome with this, but the classic penne also works.\n6. **Al limone.** (Garlic, shallot, lemon, heavy cream, parm, salt, chili flakes, olive oil). A break from the tomato-y cheesy porkiness. This is one of my favorites. I use the [Cooks Illustrated recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/1731-spaghetti-with-lemon-and-olive-oil-al-limone) (non-video is paywalled) but add some garlic, chili flake, and a bunch more lemon juice. I skip the zest and herbage. Use spaghetti for this one.\n\nFinally, a couple honorable mentions: you also have all the ingredients here for **aglio e olio** and **alfredo**. I don't personally like either all that much, but I know lots of people go gaga over aglio e olio especially. Try 'em out if they sound up your alley. If you keep eggs around, you could also do **carbonara.** Again, not my fave, but you do you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/ermku7/my_love_letter_to_pantry_pastas/", "created_utc": 1579566702.0, "score": 2289, "author": "elijha", "num_comments": 280, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/ermku7/my_love_letter_to_pantry_pastas/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "If you're sick of wet stir fries, I got a fix for you", "selftext": "**tl;dr:**\n\n**After all your other ingredients are cooked and set aside, cook your sauce down in your empty wok/pan until it's fragrant and thickened, then turn off the heat and toss your ingredients back in to coat (their surface moisture will re-constitute the cooked sauce and allow it to spread around).**\n\n**Works for all kinds of sauces and keeps the sauces from drawing all the moisture out of your other ingredients making a huge puddle in your wok. Especially nice for sauces that need a char like gochujang+soy+ginger+garlic.**\n\nSo, none of us have industrial burners at home heating our woks to 700 F.\n\nAnd sometime we end up with soggy stir fries because of that. Boo.\n\nI've been making stir fries (Asian) my whole life and have been frequently confounded by the occasional wet one.\n\nI could do everything right, working in batches, minding my order of operations etc etc.\n\nBut once I added my sauce in, my veggies would sweat and the rice/noodles would start sopping it all up and steaming instead of frying, and everything would end up less than the sum of the individual parts.\n\nSimple solution: **Treat your sauce like a separate ingredient. Not one you add on top of the other ones while they cook. An ingredient that must be cooked on its own**.\n\nDo everything else first - proteins, veggies, starches... and then your sauce at the very end.\n\nReduce it down in the pan by itself - it doesn't even need to be on highest heat for this. Just enough to sizzle it. This will give it that slightly charred taste (I know there's a word for it) without drawing all the moisture out of your vegetables. Right as it gets thick and on the verge of possibly burning, turn off the heat, add your starches and veggies and such back in and toss vigorously to coat everything. \n\nThe residual moisture from all your other ingredients will thin the cooked sauce out just enough to coat it, and without the added heat from the burner to accelerate osmosis, your veggies and meat won't sweat out all their moisture turning your stir fry to soup.\n\nHope this saves y'all a bunch of unsatisfactory stir fries.\n\nThe one exception is if your stir fry is primarily starch based, like a fried rice or stir fried noodle dishes. Rice and noodles can go in without being -fully- cooked, and they will sop up a ton of sauce liquid. Still recommended to do veggies separately though.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lks10j/if_youre_sick_of_wet_stir_fries_i_got_a_fix_for/", "created_utc": 1613437500.0, "score": 2266, "author": "itsmevichet", "num_comments": 164, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/lks10j/if_youre_sick_of_wet_stir_fries_i_got_a_fix_for/", "html_title": ""}

The issue I often find is that when buying a cookbook you don't actually know if that cookbook is going to vibe with your style of cooking until you try it out (ie. how many ingredients you regularly purchase are included in the recipes, how many ingredients you'd have to go out of your way to buy and then never use again, the time and effort needed to make something, whether you like the overall taste of the dishes, etc), you know what I mean? I've especially found with some of the really big name cookbooks, like *The Food Lab* most of those recipes are waaaaay out fo my price range and would make me buy ingredients I almost never have or would use again--but there's still some cool recipes in there that I'd love to try out! My library has like 9 copies of it (even some online copies!), so that makes it way more doable to take a copy of *The Food Lab* out for a few weeks, try the recipes I was interested in and then give it back when time's up.\n\nI know a lot of people just say why not use online recipes and stuff, which yeah, I do, but I also really appreicate the immense insight and often intense testing each recipe goes through to get into a recipe book--it's nice to see the fruition of the author's efforts in one place and there's something nostalgic about having to find a way to prop up a recipe book on the counter :) Anyways, if you're debating about a cookbook, try searching your local library branch first--you might be surprised!\n\n**TL;DR libraries are an accessible and** ***free*** **way of trying out cookbooks**\n\nEdit: I'm so happy to see so many of you doing this too!

{"title": "Guide: Chinese Ingredients - How to Use, Buy, and some Pantry Essentials", "selftext": "So for those of you interested in Chinese cooking, we figured it might be helpful to list out the common ingredients used in a Chinese pantry.  I know that this turned into a bit into a novella \u2013 I seem to have just nailed that awkward middle ground in between \u2018too much ink spilled to be a reddit post\u2019 and \u2018not quite as comprehensive enough to be a reference\u2019.  There\u2019s a bit of a TL;DR at the end, and if you want there\u2019s a six and a half minute [video to go with this](https://youtu.be/hdVIMD50wuw).\n\nI\u2019ve split these up into a few different categories.  In each category I\u2019m going *roughly* in the order of how commonplace the ingredient is in Chinese cooking.  We 80% of the time cook either Cantonese or Sichuanese food, so we\u2019ve got that bias\u2026 and I\u2019m **sure** that I might be blanking on some ingredients.  If you\u2019re familiar with Chinese cooking and have something to add, lemme know and we can add it in.\n\n######Basic Seasonings\n\n(1) **Salt**. Pantry Essential, of course.  Basic table salt (iodized salt) is used in most recipes.  Sichuan is pretty famous for salt production, if you\u2019re obsessive you could search for \u2018Sichuan salt\u2019, which\u2019s also a powder and has *slightly* less salinity than table salt.  \n\n(2) **Sugar**.  Pantry essential, of course.  Basic granulated white sugar here.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Experienced cooks\u2019ll know that sugar often has a place in savory dishes, and in Chinese cuisine it\u2019s especially commonplace.  Whether it\u2019s Sichuan Dan Dan noodles, Dim Sum Siu Mai, or even often a simple stir-fried veg, a touch of sugar is almost as commonplace as salt.  \n\n(3) **Cornstarch (\u751f\u7c89)**.  Pantry Essential. Now, while I always list out \u2018cornstarch\u2019 in these recipes, this ingredient \u2013 *shengfen* in Mandarin \u2013 commonly refers to two ingredients: cornstarch and potato starch.  They are, in essence, almost exactly the same thing, though some cooks\u2019ll swear that cornstarch makes for a crispier coating when deep frying stuff.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Cornstarch, just like in Western cooking, is basically always first mixed with a touch of water to make a slurry in order to prevent clumping.  You can use that to thicken sauces, just like you would a pan sauce \u2013 these sorts of cornstarch thickened sauces are called *qian* (\u82a1).  Further, in Chinese cooking cornstarch is a basic ingredient in marinades \u2013 the cornstarch\u2019ll coat the meat and, when cooked, the gelatin from the starch\u2019ll create a barrier to prevent moisture from leaking.  Lastly, cornstarch can be used to create a sort of super crispy crust when deep-frying.\n\n(4) **Rock Sugar (\u51b0\u7cd6)**.  Rock sugar\u2019s crystalized sugar \u2013 usually, the stuff we get here in China is \u2018multi-crystallized rock sugar\u2019 (which has a jagged sort of appearance) as opposed to the \u2018mono-crystallized rock sugar\u2019 that\u2019s common in the West.  The two can be used interchangeably.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Rock sugar has a touch milder taste than granulated sugar, and is often used in soups and braises.  When making *tangse* - a sort of quick \u2018caramel\u2019 made by melting sugar in hot oil that\u2019s a base for a lot of braises, e.g. hongshaorou (red-braised pork) \u2013 some cooks swear that using pounded rock sugar makes for a better effect (we\u2019ve converted to using granulated sugar for *tangse*, as it\u2019s quicker, easier, and we don\u2019t notice a difference in taste).\n\n*Recommended subs:* If you\u2019re obsessive, you could opt for raw sugar or a natural cane sugar\u2026 but in general granulated sugar\u2019s completely fine.     \n\n(5) **MSG (\u5473\u7cbe) -or- Chicken Bouillon Powder (\u9e21\u7c89).**  The absolute bane of the \u2018natural, healthy cooking\u2019 crowd, a lot of ink\u2019s been shed on the so-called health effects of MSG.  We even had one dude over on YouTube lambaste us for using MSG as it apparently caused \u2018penile shrinking\u2019 lol. For what it\u2019s worth, the actual scientific literature is basically as fuckin inconclusive as it gets.  Chicken bouillon powder usually contains MSG, and is used to a similar effect.  In China, the former is more commonly used in restaurants while the latter is more common in home kitchens.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* So while the pendulum seems to have swung the other way on MSG, with people embracing its umami-enhancing qualities, we sorta feel like in some circles it\u2019s perhaps gone *too* far in the other direction.  I don\u2019t think MSG\u2019s best used, say, mixed in with salt and put in literally anything and everything.  MSG has two primary uses: first, a sprinkle to help bring out the natural umami in glutamate-rich ingredients \u2013 it can really amp up dishes that use, say, dried seafood or mushrooms. Second, it balances spicy food really, really well.  The Sichuan *hongyou* chili oil flavor profile (i.e. dishes like koushuiji \u2018mouth watering chicken\u2019 or Dan Dan noodles) just wouldn\u2019t be the same without a teaspoon of MSG.\n\n*Recommended subs:* As stated above, unless it specifically states otherwise, chicken bouillon powder usually contains MSG. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t really know how much, as they don\u2019t exactly advertise that fact.  When using bouillon powder instead of MSG, be aware that you\u2019ll also be adding more salinity to your dish as well.\n\n---\n\n######Sauces:\n\nWhen meandering into a Chinese or Asian supermarket, the first thing many people notice are like the mountain of different sauces.  Asian cuisines are the masters of fermentation - about 90% of those sauces are different ingredients fermented in different and interesting ways.\n\n(1) **Light soy sauce (\u751f\u62bd).** Pantry essential.  Light soy sauce is the standard soy sauce \u2013 fermented for 100 days \u2013 and what a recipe writer\u2019s referring to if they forgetfully write just \u2018soy sauce\u2019.  It has more salinity than the dark soy sauce below.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* I guess the question is more \u2018how isn\u2019t soy sauce used\u2019?  It\u2019s in marinades, it\u2019s in sauces, it\u2019s used for seasoning.  \n\n*What to look for when buying:* Some brands are saltier than others \u2013 you want a soy sauce with a nice umami undertone.  Take a half teaspoon of your soy sauce and taste it\u2026 if it\u2019s making your lips pucker, you\u2019ll want a nicer soy sauce.  A brand that we kinda like that\u2019s available seems to be available abroad is called \u2018yipinxian\u2019 (\u4e00\u54c1\u9c9c).  If you don\u2019t have a nice soy sauce, don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t let it be a barrier to cooking! Just keep your salinity in mind and maybe go lighter on the salt.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* So while I believe Chinese light soy sauce isn\u2019t really available at your standard Western supermarket, the Japanese brand \u2018Kikkoman\u2019 is.  Japanese soy sauce\u2019s aged for longer and is somewhere between Chinese light and Chinese dark soy sauce.  Kikkoman\u2019d be good enough for government work \u2013 the longer ferment gives it more umami than some of the lesser quality light soy sauces, though it\u2019ll also impart a darker color to the dish.  The taste would be fine, just know that the final color may not be exactly what you might be expecting.\n\n(2) **Dark Soy Sauce (\u8001\u62bd).** So this isn\u2019t exactly the second most common sauce, but I figured that it\u2019d make sense to keep the soy sauces together.  Dark soy sauce\u2019s made with caramel added and aged for 3-6 months longer, which gives it a darker color and a slightly deeper flavor.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Perhaps surprisingly, mostly for color.  Dark soy sauce is usually used in conjunction with light soy sauce, and is what makes [this Cantonese-style fried noodle]( https://static7.orstatic.com/userphoto/photo/6/5DJ/0128DY86E557692EB9A548px.jpg) more attractive than, say, [this one](http://jp3.r0tt.com/l_cbdd5b40-65ed-11e1-b1db-bd31a8200003.jpg). It\u2019s also a bit better than light soy sauce when used as a dipping sauce.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* As stated above, Japanese soy sauce is somewhere in between Chinese light and Chinese dark soy sauce.  If there\u2019s a recipe that uses both, just using all Japanese soy sauce might be a decent route to take.\n\n(3) **Liaojiu (\u6599\u9152) a.k.a. Shaoxing Wine (\u7ecd\u5174\u9152).** Pantry Essential. Both Liaojiu and Shaoxing wine are actually different grades of Huangjiu, a classic sort of Chinese rice wine.  Liaojiu\u2019s the dirt cheap cooking grade, often has some salt added, and aggressively breaks the ol\u2019 rule in Western cooking that you should only cook with stuff you drink\u2026 that said, unless you\u2019re working with a recipe that uses this ingredient as the dominant flavor of the dish (e.g. Huadiao Chicken) liaojiu works perfectly well.  Shaoxing is a higher grade of Huangjiu that can be used for drinking or cooking.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Like light soy sauce, liaojiu is used\u2026 extensively.  It forms a critical component of the standard marinade together with salt, sugar, cornstarch, and soy sauce.  While for Western marinades it\u2019s best not to use alcohol as the lengthy marinade time required for thick cuts of meat\u2019ll actually paradoxically make the meat tougher, for the quicker Chinese marinades (15-30 minutes) the alcohol\u2019ll make the proteins denature and get more tender.  In addition, a splash of liaojiu on your spatula and around the sides of the wok is an extremely common step in many stir-frys. \n\n*What to look for when buying:* Again, for most purposes a cheap-o sort of liaojiu is completely fine.  Be aware that a lot of the stuff abroad that\u2019s called \u2018Shaoxing wine\u2019 is actually just liaojiu \u2013 you can tell by (1) the salt content and (2) the fact that they\u2019ll often have the Chinese characters for liaojiu, \u2018\u6599\u9152\u2019, obviously written on the bottle.  If you want to make sure that you\u2019re getting a higher grade one, check for something that says it\u2019s \u2018huadiao\u2019 (\u82b1\u96d5, or sometimes written \u2018hua tiao\u2019). Unlike Shaoxing (which\u2019s a term sorta thrown around nowadays, especially abroad), Huadiao specifically refers to a higher grade of Huangjiu.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* The go-to sub for liaojiu that you\u2019ll find online is \u2018a dry sherry\u2019.  I know that many people swear by it, and I\u2019m not gunna argue with them\u2026 I\u2019ve just never tried it myself!  I think liaojiu\u2019s something that you got a bit more flexibility with than many realize \u2013 especially because for most recipes you\u2019re just using a little bit.  I used white wine once when I was back in the States and it was fine.  Mirin\u2019s kinda similar but\u2019s super sweet \u2013 but given how sugar\u2019s used as a seasoning in many dishes, using that and dialing back the sugar should be ok. Chinese rice wine\u2019s (\u7c73\u9152, *mijiu*) isn\u2019t the same but can often be used in the same way, so sake would also likely do the trick.   \n\n(4) **Toasted sesame oil (\u9ebb\u6cb9).**  Pantry Essential.  Ok, I know this isn\u2019t exactly a \u2018sauce\u2019, but categorizing stuff is hard lol. Toasted sesame oil\u2019s sesame oil made, from, well, toasted sesame seeds.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Toasted sesame oil\u2019s **not** a frying oil, it\u2019s for finishing \u2013 it add a nice little nutty taste to the dish.  Some people say that heating it up\u2019ll cause it to have a \u2018burnt\u2019 taste, and some\u2019ll say that it\u2019ll just lose it\u2019s flavor\u2026 I haven\u2019t experimented mostly because I don\u2019t feel like pissing money away.  Sometimes you\u2019ll see people use it in marinades, which we used to do as well until we watched a chef explain that using a standard cooking oil would have the same effect (which\u2019s pretty obvious in hindsight).\n\n(5) **Dark Chinese Vinegar (\u9648\u918b -or- \u9999\u918b).** Pantry Essential.  Dark Chinese vinegar\u2019s aged, and sort of like the Chinese equivalent of Balsamic.  There\u2019s actually two types of Dark Chinese aged vinegar - *chencu* (\u2018mature vinegar\u2019) which\u2019s from the Northwest Province of Shanxi and made with wheat and shorgum, and *xiangcu* (\u2018fragrant vinegar\u2019 a.k.a. Chinkiang vinegar) which\u2019s from the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu province and made with sticky rice.  The flavor\u2019s a bit different, and we usually call for *chencu*, but using them interchangeably is usually ok. \n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Dark vinegar is extensively used in Northern Chinese cuisine, and also forms a critical component in the sauces of many dishes in Sichuanese food.  It makes a great dipping sauce, and some people in the Northwest\u2019ll even toss it in their soups.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* This one\u2019s hard, as both *chencu* and *xiangcu* have pretty unique tastes.  Balsamic would be the obvious choice, but again\u2026 it has its own complexities.  IIRC America\u2019s Test Kitchen once used a mix of equal parts balsamic, rice vinegar, and water to sub for *xiangcu*\u2026 so maybe something like that\u2019d be plausible.  You could also perhaps just use balsamic \u2013 it\u2019d undeniably be different, but especially if a dish is using just small amounts I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be bad.\n\n(6) **White Chinese Vinegar (\u767d\u918b).**  White Chinese vinegar\u2019s made from rice, and\u2019s a bit less astringent than Western white vinegar.  Note that there\u2019s a ton of varieties of rice vinegar\u2026 some that can get quite delicate, but the bog-standard white rice vinegar would likely be the most common.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* White Chinese vinegar\u2019s used basically how you\u2019d expect.  It is one possible option to form a sweet-and-sour flavor profile, and an interesting application is that it can be used to prep the skin of Cantonese Siu Yuk (crispy roast pork belly).\n\n*Recommended subs:* While some rice vinegars could get real difficult to sub, this stuff\u2019s more or less interchangeable with Western white vinegar. Just be careful with it \u2013 if you\u2019re feeling paranoid, one possible option might be to slightly water it down. \n\n(7) **Oyster Sauce (\u869d\u6cb9)**. Pantry Essential. The old story of the creation of oyster sauce was that a shopkeep was boiling some oysters, forgot about them, and found them boiled down into a paste.  While that\u2019s almost certainly apocryphal, the traditional way of making oyster sauce *is* slowly simmering away oysters til it forms a thick sauce. Of course, if manufacturing it that way makes the price of the sauce pretty astronomical \u2013 nowadays, it\u2019s usually made from oyster extracts, sugar, and thickened with a cornstarch slurry.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Oyster sauce is an important ingredient in a lot of Cantonese dishes, adding sweetness and umami. The flavor of oyster sauce seems to go real well with beef \u2013 when cooking beef, it\u2019s a common addition to marinades.  While it\u2019s originally from Guangdong, it\u2019s since spread throughout the country and you can find it pretty much anywhere.\n\n*What to look for when buying:* One of the most common brands for Chinese products abroad is Lee Kum Kee. In general, Lee Kum Kee\u2019s a solid enough brand for Cantonese products \u2013 they got their start selling oyster sauce, and hey, they\u2019re a great option.  Just be wary of their stuff that\u2019s from other Chinese cuisines \u2013 e.g. I don\u2019t like their Guilin chili sauce, and their Sichuan doubanjiang is\u2026 pretty bad.            \n\n(8) **Stock Concentrate (\u9e21\u6c41).** Pantry Essential, at least for us.  Those of you familiar with better-than-bouillon and similar products are familiar with stock concentrate.  Yes, *of course* a homemade stock is best, but stock concentrate is generally tastier than powder or boxed stock.  Generally, the chicken flavored ones work, but are much less tasty than the scallop or abalone varieties.  Some of the latter ones can have a bit of a pronounced seafood flavor \u2013 for general purpose it\u2019s best if you can find a more neutral one, but many dishes can handle a touch of seafood flavor as well.  \n\n*How it\u2019s used:* You wouldn\u2019t want it for, say, a soup \u2013 in my personal opinion, the reason it\u2019s easier to get away with using stock concentrate in Chinese cuisine is that the flavor\u2019s often already being built up from strong, umami-rich ingredients like soy sauce.  We generally use roughly 1 tsp of concentrate per \u00bd to \u00be cup of water to make \u2018stock\u2019.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* If subbing in a Western stock concentrate, for best results make sure that it has a relatively neutral chicken flavor (some brands are more heavily seasoned) and also not a roasted stock.  \n\n(9) **Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang (\u90eb\u53bf\u8c46\u74e3\u9171)**.  Pantry Essential if cooking Sichuan food. A.k.a. Chili bean paste. Sichuan Doubanjiang\u2019s made from fermenting broad beans, chilis, and other ingredients. \n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang is a super common addition to the Sichuanese mala \u2018numbing spicy\u2019 flavor profile, and is an important ingredient in your Mapo Tofu. In addition to its fermented undertone, it imparts and absolutely brilliant red color.  It\u2019s a unique ingredient, there\u2019s really no possible subs for this guy. \n\n*What to look for when buying:* There seems to be some mixups when buying Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang, as \u201cDoubanjiang\u201d is really a *category* of different fermented bean pastes.  I\u2019d venture that this Sichuan version is the most common, followed by a plain Northern version that\u2019s also called \u201cHuangdoujiang\u201d (yellow soybean paste), and another called \u201cDajiang\u201d (which\u2019s similar to the Korean Doenjang). If you went on Amazon and search \u201cdoubanjiang\u201d, 95% of what you\u2019d find are the spicy Sichuan varieties.  To be certain you\u2019re getting the right one however, (1) make sure it\u2019s an obvious red color and (2) look for something that says it\u2019s \u201cPixian Doubanjiang\u201d, which specifically refers to this chili bean paste.\n\n(10) **Other fermented sauces.**  In the interest of everyone\u2019s time, I\u2019m gunna consolidate the mountain of other different fermented sauces here.  How common each one is depends where you are in China.  As stated above, *Huangdoujiang* (\u9ec4\u8c46\u9171) is made from fermented soy beans and is common in Northeastern and Hakka cooking.  *Hoisin* (\u6d77\u9c9c\u9171) is Cantonese, made from fermented soy beans and spices, and is primarily used for dipping.  *Tianmianjiang* (\u751c\u9762\u9171) is a Northern sauce made from (interestingly) fermented steamed buns, and is the base for the sauce that\u2019s used in Peking Duck. *Mianchi* (\u9762\u8c49) is a sauce made from fermented and aged soybeans, is almost identical to Japanese red miso if made using traditional methods, and is one of the basic components to Char Siu sauce. *Chuhou Paste* (\u67f1\u5019\u9171) is similar to Hoisin in that it\u2019s a Cantonese sauce made with fermented soy beans and seasonings \u2013 different in that the seasonings include sesame paste and aged tangerine peel.  It\u2019s used in certain meat braises and stews. *Shoudouchi* (\u6c34\u8c46\u8c49) are a sort of \u2018quick fermented\u2019 soybean that can be made at home and is common in Hunan and Guizhou cuisines.\n\n(11) **Sesame Paste (\u829d\u9ebb\u9171).** Made from pounded toasted sesame seeds.  Look for a natural one with some visible oil at the top of the jar.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Commonly used in sauces \u2013 e.g. Sichuan cuisine uses it in the sauce for Dan Dan noodles, and it\u2019s also common to see it in sauces for cold vegetable dishes.\n\n*Recommended subs:* Tahini is basically the same thing only made with olive oil.  If you\u2019re desperate and working with a dish where sesame paste isn\u2019t the primary flavor, you could even play around with peanut butter.\n\n(12) **Fermented Bean Curd (\u8150\u4e73).** One of among a potpourri of Asian ingredients some Americans seem to love to film themselves gagging on, fermented bean curd comes in red (called \u2018nanru\u2019, \u5357\u4e73) and white varieties.  The red version gets its color from the addition of red yeast rice (fermented rice).\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* There\u2019s a few classic dishes, such as nanru peanuts, that use fermented bean curd as a base.  It\u2019s sometimes used in doughs, such as \u2018guobie\u2019, the crispy fried cracker that goes into street food-style Jianbing.  It\u2019s also a common addition to Char Siu sauce.\n\n(13) **Laoganma Chili Sauce (\u8001\u5e72\u5988).** If this was a list of \u2018most common ingredients used by college students in China\u2019, it might be near the top of the list.  Laoganma\u2019s really a line of sauces, has two that are particularly popular: (1) spicy chili crisp and (2) chili oil with black bean.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Laoganma enthusiasts seem to put it in\u2026 almost anything.  A buddy of mine from Yunnan in university used to even mix it in with his white rice.  Of the two popular varieties, the spicy chili crisp is more of a condiment while the chili oil with black bean\u2019s more of an ingredient.  You can potentially use Laoganma\u2019s chili oil with black bean in any sort of dish that would use (1) chilis and (2) one of those fermented sauces from #9.  It\u2019s really convenient to have for random weeknight stir-fries: garlic + ginger + laoganma with a splash of liaojiu and soy sauce works with\u2026 a lot of stuff.   \n\n---\n\n######Aromatics:\n\nThese are almost all self-explanatory, as these are almost all aromatics that\u2019re also used in Western cooking.  I\u2019ll be a bit less long-winded here, promise.  \n\n(1) **Garlic.**. Pantry essential, as it is in Western cooking. \n\n*How it\u2019s used*: So garlic, along with the next two ingredients (ginger and green onion), make up the three most common aromatics in Chinese cooking.  They\u2019re used together in different ways, usually one of: just garlic, just ginger, garlic and ginger, ginger and green onion, garlic plus ginger and green onion\n\n(2) **Ginger (\u59dc).** Pantry essential.\n\n(3.) **Green onion, white part only (\u8471).**  Pantry essential.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* When using green onion as an aromatic, it\u2019s most common to use only the white part of the green onion \u2013 that two to four inch section at the bottom.\n\n(4) **Leek (\u5927\u8471).** Much more common in Northern China than the south.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Julienned, and either used as an aromatic (to the similar effect of the white-part-of-the-green-onion) or served raw as a vegetable in dishes like Northern Zhajiangmian and Peking Duck.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* Even though it\u2019s used in Western cooking as well, it seems not every supermarket\u2019ll carry leek \u2013 and sometimes when they do, it can be expensive.  The white part of the green onion can be a suitable sub if using leek as an aromatic.\n\n(5) **Shallot (\u5e72\u8471).** Much more common in Southern China than the north.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Ginger and shallot sometimes appear together as a variant of the ginger and green onion combination.\n\n(6) **White onion (\u6d0b\u8471).**  Not used as often as it is in Western cooking \u2013 if you translated the Chinese  for onion (\u6d0b\u8471) character by character it\u2019d literally be \u2018\u6d0b = imported; \u8471 = green onion\u2019.  Still, it\u2019s around, and used quite a bit.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Scallion and white onion are often fried together to make \u2018scallion oil\u2019, which is a classic ingredient in Huaiyang and Cantonese cuisine. You can often find them in fried noodles, and in Cantonese cuisine they tend to use it with beef.  In the Northwest, you can find them raw in \u2018salads\u2019 (i.e. cold vegetable dishes).\n\n(7) **Chinese Celery (\u82b9\u83dc).** Chinese celery\u2019s a standard vegetable in Chinese cooking, but it\u2019s also used as an aromatic\u2026 most famously in Chaoshan (Teochew) cuisine.  It\u2019s got less water content and a bit more of a pungent and flavorful taste than Western celery.  \n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Chinese celery and deep fried garlic are a classic combination in Teochew cooking.  Again, this guy (like, say, *jiucai* - Chinese chives) is used a bit more often as a \u2018strong\u2019 vegetable to have in stir-fry.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* You could use Western celery in a pinch, but be advised that the water contend of Western celery has the potential to muff things up when stir frying.  If you have a weak stove and wanna play it safe, first toast the Western celery in a dry wok/pan to remove some of its moisture.  \n\n---\n\n######Spices:\n\n(1) **White pepper powder (\u767d\u80e1\u6912\u7c89).** Pantry Essential. I\u2019m sure most of you\u2019ve used white pepper before \u2013 it\u2019s got a bit sharper of a taste than black pepper, which is around but less common in Chinese cooking.\n\n(2) **Sichuan Peppercorn (\u82b1\u6912).** Pantry Essential. An absolutely imperative ingredient to have around if cooking Sichuan food, Sichuan peppercorn has a real unique flavor \u2013 you might know about its mouth numbing qualities, but it\u2019s got this real nice floral taste as well.  You\u2019ll find Sichuan peppercorn in both \u2018red\u2019 and \u2018green\u2019 varieties\u2026 the green peppercorn\u2019s actually from a different plant, with a stronger taste and the floral qualities dialed up to 11.  Usually, you\u2019ll be using the red variety.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Sichuan peppercorn is used in a number of different flavor profiles in Sichuanese cooking, some of which leave your mouth crazy tingly. Sichuan peppercorn\u2019s not \u2018spicy\u2019 per se but rather *balances* heat really well \u2013 sometimes, you don\u2019t wanna impart a tingling sensation but rather only use a touch to balance out your chilis.  A spoonful of Sichuan peppercorn\u2019s also a nice addition to poaching liquid or braises (e.g. Northwestern \u2018big plate of chicken\u2019 or some versions of Red Braised Pork) \u2013 when used in that fashion, it\u2019ll only lend its floral qualities.  \n\nWhen stir-frying, use Sichuan peppercorns in one of two ways: either fry it with the oil and remove, or toast the whole peppercorns and grind into a powder (or you could just fry the peppercorns and leave em in, many home cooks in China do so).  Just don\u2019t use Sichuan peppercorn powder \u2013 the ingredient really doesn\u2019t seem to hold up well in its powdered form.\n\n*What to watch out for when buying:*  Unfortunately, it seems as though many of the exported Sichuan peppercorns aren\u2019t the best of quality.  You can obviously still use sub-par peppercorns, just don\u2019t be disappointed if they don\u2019t exactly give you the desire effect in the numbing flavor profiles!  If you\u2019re wondering if your peppercorns are nice enough, take two peppercorns and chew on them \u2013 they should have an obvious tingling effect.  If not, it might be a decent idea to buy some Sichuan peppercorns online from online spice shops\u2026 I chatted a few months back with /u/suzhousteve, who works for (owns?) a company called \u201cSpice Trekkers\u201d \u2013 I obviously can\u2019t vouch for their quality, but the dude was quite knowledgeable and talked a bit about the pains of sourcing good ones.\n\n*Recommended Subs:* There are no recommended subs.  Recipes need to stop suggesting black pepper as a sub \u2013 they\u2019re totally 1000% not the same thing.  Subbing Sichuan peppercorn with black pepper because they\u2019re both peppercorns would be like subbing bitter melon with watermelon just because they\u2019re both melons.            \n\n(3) **Chinese five spice (\u4e94\u9999\u7c89).** Pantry Essential. So perhaps confusingly, there\u2019s not \u2018one\u2019 five spice \u2013 different brands have different blends, and some of them use more than five spices!  A common mix is cinnamon, clove, star anise, Sichuan peppercorn, and fennel seed.  Other additions are licorice root, white pepper, shanzha (hawthorn berry), shajiang (sand ginger a.k.a. kencur or Cutcherry powder), cardamom seed, or ginger powder.  \n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Five spice goes great with meat, pork in particular. Just FYI, it\u2019s not really an ingredient to toss in stir-fry\u2026 but rather for steamed and particularly roasted dishes. \n\n(4) **Braising spices.** So again, in the interest of everyone\u2019s time I\u2019ll consolidate these into one item.  Besides these, spices are most commonly used in Chinese cooking when poaching or braising \u2013 the most common being cinnamon (\u6842\u76ae), clove (\u4e01\u9999), fennel seed (\u5c0f\u8334\u9999), Sichuan peppercorn, star anise (\u516b\u89d2), dried bay leaf (\u9999\u53f6), and black cardamom (\u8349\u679c).  From there, depending on the recipe, a potentially absurd back catalogue of spices can sometimes be called for: nutmeg, cumin seed, dried galangal, shanzha (hawthorn berry), baizhi, cardamom seed, liqourice root, luohanguo\u2026 you get the idea.  Sometimes these\u2019re even all used together!\n\n*Recommended subs:* If you encounter a recipe that has a mind boggling list of spices (e.g. Roujiamo, the \u2018Chinese Hamburger\u2019), we\u2019ll say this: it\u2019s safe to opt for only using the ones from that list \u201ccommon braising spices\u201d above.  I know I\u2019m kinda skirting with heresy here, but in my personal opinion there starts to reach a point of diminishing returns when it comes to spices\u2026 and honestly, I think some of those dishes include a mountain of spices mostly due to their supposed health benefits.  We\u2019ll always write our recipes to include all of the spices used for the sake of being accurate and unbiased, but don\u2019t drive yourself crazy trying to hunt down that dried hawthorn berry only to add one or two to a braise.\n\n(5) **Shajiang (\u6c99\u59dc).** A.k.a. Sand ginger powder, Kencur, or Cutcherry powder.  I know this one can be a tough one to source, you should be able to find it on Amazon under the name \u2018cutcherry powder\u2019 or the Malaysian name \u2018kencur\u2019.  It\u2019s a pretty unique taste, a bit like a peppery ginger.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* This ingredient\u2019s most commonly used in Cantonese cuisine.  Dishes that use it are salt-baked chicken (*yanjuji*), the terribly translated \u2018salt-and-pepper\u2019 flavor profile (e.g. salt and pepper shrimp), and is an important ingredient in Char Siu sauce.\n\n---\n\n**Chilis and Chili Sauces:**\n\nNote that Scoville units here are just a shorthand. Is Scoville unscientific?  Sure, but it still can give you a decent idea of the heat level if you\u2019re working with an unfamiliar pepper. \n\nBefore we get started, allow me to be upfront with something that I\u2019m still unclear on: the mystery of the Tien Tsin chili pepper.  English language sources\u2019ll insist that *that*, the Tien Tsin chili, is *the* chili pepper that\u2019s used in Sichuanese and Hunanese cuisine.  Tien Tsin is, of course, the city of \u201cTianjin\u201d in pinyin\u2026 which ain\u2019t exactly an area that\u2019s known for it\u2019s love of spicy food.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it seems the Tien Tsin chili, called \u2018Tianying\u2019 in Mandarin, was a variety of Cayenne introduced from Japan to Tianjin in the late 1970s.  People then started producing it there *specifically for export*.  Who knew?\n\nNote that according to everything I\u2019ve read, Tien Tsin chilis are quite hot, hotter even than Heaven Facing Chilis.  I\u2019m sure the flavor\u2019d work, but it\u2019s just something to keep in mind.\n\nSo we\u2019ll talk a bit about chili varieties, but in the end\u2026 I\u2019d consider some sort of variety of fresh mild chilis and dried hot chilis \u2018pantry essentials\u2019. All of the chilis we\u2019re talking about here are from the Capsicum annuum cultivar \u2013 chilis are one of those quintessentially local ingredients, get creative!     \n\n(1) **Red and Green Mild Paprika Chilis (\u7ea2\u8fa3\u6912/\u9752\u8fa3\u6912).** ~150 SVU.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Fresh. Very common in Cantonese cuisine when you wanna add a bit of chili flavor but without the heat.  Also used for color and garnish.\n\n*Recommmended subs:* Anaheims are spicier but are a reasonable sub.  Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really common to have a \u2018red mild chili\u2019 abroad, so if you\u2019re using the red for color, it seems that red bell pepper might be the only possible route.\n \n(2) **Cayenne Pepper (\u725b\u89d2\u6912/\u8fa3\u6912\u5e72).** In the video I stupidly forgot to talk about this.  In areas of China that aren\u2019t named \u201cSichuan\u201d, it\u2019s probably the most common dried chili pepper.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Dried.\n\n(3) **Erjingtiao (\u4e8c\u8346\u6761).**  Can\u2019t find the SVU, I\u2019d reckon ~20-30,000 SVU looking at comparables.  \n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Fresh, dried, and pickled.  Erjingtiao\u2019s valued due to its fragrance and brilliant red color.\n\n*Recommended subs:* We\u2019d recommend something of a similar cultivar and heat level \u2013 Dried Cayenne and Chili de Arbol should work fine for most dishes.  For something like Sichuan chili oil where you\u2019d really want that red color, you might wanna think about playing with a combination of one of those subs and a bit of Hungarian Sweet Paprika or something.  It seems as though pickled erjingtiao are pretty rare abroad, so for that you might want some sort of combination of Western-style red pickled peppers and pickled chaotianjiao.\n\n(4) **Chaotianjiao (\u671d\u5929\u6912), \u201cHeaven Facing Pepper\u201d** SVU ~50,000. \n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Fresh, dried, and pickled.  Dried Chaotianjiao\u2019s used in Sichuan cuisine when you really wanna amp up the heat, and fresh Chaotianjiao are used quite a bit in Hunan cooking.\n\n*Recommended subs:* Seems like those Tien Tsin chilis\u2019d be perfect, or if you don\u2019t mind something slightly hotter you could also go for Thai Bird\u2019s Eye.\n\n(5) **Chili Oil (\u8fa3\u6912\u6cb9/\u7ea2\u6cb9).** Ok, so there\u2019s two types of chili oil \u2013 the sort that\u2019s used as a condiment that has little flakes in it, and the sort that\u2019s used as an ingredient in Sichuanese cooking (*hongyou*, a.k.a. \u2018red oil\u2019).  \n\n*Considerations when buying:* In general, store-bought chili oil \u2013 especially the Sichuanese \u2018red oil\u2019 type \u2013 isn\u2019t very good store bought.  That said, for the condiment-like chili oil, Laoganma\u2019s \u2018Chili Crisps in Oil\u2019 can be used.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* The Sichuanese \u2018red oil\u2019 is the basis of a flavor profile in Sichuanese cooking that includes Dan Dan noodles and Koushuiji (\u2018Mouth watering chicken\u2019).  The condiment sort can be, well, used as a condiment.  Use as a dipping sauce, toss in noodle soups, whatever.\n\n(6) **Chili Garlic Sauce (\u849c\u84c9\u8fa3\u6912\u9171).**  This\u2019s really one of those ingredients that\u2019s really more of a \u2018category\u2019 than an ingredient.  The most famous ones, off the top of my head, are \u201cZijin Chili Garlic Sauce\u201d from the Guangdong province and \u201cGuilin Chili Garlic Sauce\u201d from the Guangxi province.  \n\n*How it\u2019s used:*  In Cantonese cuisine, Chili Garlic sauce is used mostly for dipping.  In Guangxi, theirs is either for dipping or for mixing in with some cold dishes.\n\n---\n\n######Dried Ingredients:\n\n(1) **Dried Shiitake Mushrooms (\u51ac\u83c7)**. Pantry essential.  Why are dried mushrooms awesome? Well, like tinned tomatoes, usually it\u2019s only the very best quality mushrooms \u2013 picked at the height of the season \u2013 that\u2019re dried.  Drying also seems to increase the umami of ingredients \u2013 the science of which I\u2019m not too sure of.  The shiitake variety is most common in Guangdong.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:*  Reconstitute the dried mushroom in either hot, boiled water for three hours or for eight hours/overnight in room temperature water.  The leftover water\u2019s basically like concentrated umami juice \u2013 use that just like you would stock.\n\n(2) **Dried Shrimp (\u867e\u7c73).**  Pantry essential. Common throughout coastal China.\n\n*How it\u2019s used:* Reconstitute in the same fashion with the dried mushrooms, and save that soaking liquid!  Another thing you can do with them is toss em in a blender and blitz for \u2018shrimp powder\u2019.\n\n(3) **Other dried seafood.** There\u2019s a mind boggling diverse array of different dried seafood \u2013 most common likely being dried scallop (used in the same way as dried shrimp) and dried flounder (should be grilled over your stove before using, can also be blitzed into powder).  But there\u2019s a ton more \u2013 dried octopus, squid, oyster, abalone, sea cucumber\u2026 and also basically any fish you could think of.\n\n(4) **Preserved/Pickled Vegetables.** Again, another whole category of ingredients, but I\u2019m starting to run out of breath here.  A few would would be dongcai (dried and fermented cabbage), chongcai (dried and fermented turnip), meicai (dried and fermented mustard greens), yacai (similar to meicai, but with seasoning), and zhacai (dried and fermented mustard green stem).\n\n**TL;DR:** \n\n*Essential Chinese Basics:* Salt, Sugar, Cornstarch\n\n*Essential Chinese Sauces:* Light Soy Sauce, Dark Soy Sauce, Liaojiu (Shaoxing Wine), Dark Chinese Vinegar (either Shanxi or Chinkiang is ok), Oyster Sauce,  Stock Concentrate (unless you\u2019re making your own), Sichuan Pixian Doubanjiang.\n\n*Essential Chinese Aromatics:* Garlic, Ginger, Green Onion\n\n*Essential Chinese Spices:* White pepper, Five Spice, Sichuan Peppercorn\n\n*Essential Chilis:* Some sort of fresh mild chilis, some sort of dried spicy chilis from the Capsicum annuum cultivar\n\n*Essential Dried Ingredients:* Dried mushrooms, dried shrimp or scallops\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/82enyj/guide_chinese_ingredients_how_to_use_buy_and_some/", "created_utc": 1520339094.0, "score": 2254, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 168, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/82enyj/guide_chinese_ingredients_how_to_use_buy_and_some/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "If you're looking to cook something different for christmas dinner, how about an Egyptian Roast leg of lamb that is marinated and slow cooked for hours. Full recipe inside.", "selftext": "Every country has their unique roast that they serve at festive dinners, and in Egypt and much of the Middle East it's a [Roast leg of lamb](https://imgur.com/a/1lfO1hO). Lamb plays an important part in the cuisines and cultures of the Middle East so it's no surprise that there are loads of unique ways of preparing it in the region. For this dish, it's going to be marinated in an onion marinade overnight, then roasted until it's fall off the bone tender.\n\nIf you'd like to support me, or prefer video recipes, [here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7l_2r0Yz1Q) to the full video recipe. I've also left links in the comments to all my previous r/cooking posts.\n\nScroll down for the full recipe and to skip the preamble\n\n## What is Fakhda Dani (\u0641\u062e\u062f\u0629 \u0636\u0627\u0646\u064a)\nFakhda Dani quite literally translates as Lamb Leg, and it's a generic name given to Lamb Leg dishes in the Middle East. Throughout the region there must be over 50 unique ways to cook a Lamb Leg, from [Yemeni cumin crusted haneeth](https://iliveinafryingpan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MG_77771.jpg) and [fragrant Iraqi Kouzi](https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/12/22/12/Juma_kitchen-126.jpg) to [Saudi Kabsa](https://www.sbs.com.au/food/sites/sbs.com.au.food/files/ep-2-lamb-kabsah-recipe-bw.jpg) and [Omani Shuwa](https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/shuwaa.jpg), they're all unique in their own way and absolutely delicious. Today I want to show you how to make a Fakhda the Egyptian way, it's a very simple recipe that produces outstanding flavors and a roast that's hard to forget.\n\nWhat makes Egyptian Fakhda different from the others in the Middle East is the marinade we'll be applying to it. Many of the recipes in the region utilize an array of spices and herbs to impart layers of flavors upon the lamb leg, but the Egyptian one is kept fairly simple using just 4 ingredients for the marinade; Onions, Salt, Pepper and Garlic. The marinade is put together by blending the ingredients into a [fine paste](https://imgur.com/AbQcJvm), then it's applied to the lamb leg before [allowing it to marinate](https://imgur.com/GfCXKlC) for a minimum of 12 hours. \n\nThis marinade however is not just there to infuse the lamb leg with flavors, it also serves an important part in tenderizing the meat. You see onions contain a significant amount of Protease, which is an enzyme that breaks down protein, the process of marinating the lamb leg in onions actually results in meat that is more tender and digestible than one that was not marinated. When left to marinate for a significant amount of time, the protease is able to break down most of the tough protein fibres you get in a hard working muscle like a lamb leg. The second thing the marinade does, is it serves as a brine for the meat. If you've ever had a brined chicken breast before, you'd know that it is significantly more flavorful, juicy and tender than a non brined breast, and the same thing applies to lamb legs as well. Our marinade is made quite salty and over the 12 hour marinade, the salt works it's way to a perfect equilibrium with the meat, meaning every single bite of lamb is perfectly seasoned and juicy. The last thing it does is mask the gaminess of the lamb. Sometimes lamb or mutton can have a very gamey flavor, and in a leg or shoulder it's really noticeable. The strong onion flavor in the marinade is able to mask over that flavor and make lamb more palatable for even the fussiest eaters. \n\nDespite saying leg of lamb in this recipe, I actually prefer lamb shoulder a lot more than lamb leg. Technically they're both legs but they are sold under different names, and I think it's worth getting hold of a lamb shoulder if you can. The reason for that is the lamb shoulder has more intermuscular fat than a lamb leg, and as such it's both more tender and more flavorful. Lamb legs are larger though and they're a simpler roast to work with as they only have a singular bone (or two if you count the shank). In a lamb shoulder you'll also have a bit of the shoulder blade within the meat which can be a bit awkward to cut around, but if you go to a butcher they usually can remove it for you to make carving easier. Before marinating the lamb, I take the time to trim off most of the excess surface fat, I do this because it allows the marinade to penetrate easier, but also there's plenty of fat within the meat. Then I poke it with holes and stuff each one with whole peppercorns and garlic, I find that this leads to littles pockets of garlicky peppery meat which are a nice addition. When the marinade has done its work, the meat is wiped clean to remove any excess marinade then a fair amount of nutmeg is grated over the surface. This gives the meat just a slight hint of a spiced flavor but nothing overpowering. It's then placed in the oven to [roast for 3-4 hours](https://imgur.com/lWPDCng) until literally falling off the bone, then it comes out of the oven to rest before serving.\n\nAlongside the meat, it's also common to serve [roast vegetables](https://imgur.com/D1GPS3f), and the ones I choose to serve are Potatoes, Carrots and whole miniature onions. They get coated in their own \"marinade\" which is similar to the one used for the lamb, except this time it's not overly salted. The marinade gives the vegetables a bit more character, as the onion in it caramelizes onto the surface of the vegetables. You have two different options of cooking these, you can place them below the meat before it goes in the oven, and allow them to cook in its juices or you can cook them separately. By cooking them with the meat, they will end up extremely soft and flavorful, having absorbed the juices and flavors of the lamb. However I find that they can end up too soft and sometimes even disappear after cooking for 4 hours. Instead I choose to go for a hybrid approach, and at the 2.5 hour mark, I pull my lamb out of the oven and add any accumulated pan juices or fat to the vegetable coating. Then I bake them for an hour, so they still have some structural integrity and all of the amazing lamb flavor.\n\nOnce the meat has rested, the only thing left to do, is carve and serve the meat. In a leg or shoulder, there's three distinct sections of meat that have different textures and flavors. The most flavorful and also most fatty is the gelatinous lamb shank. It's a hard working collection of muscles and despite being extremely small it has many layers of meat and fat that make it an insanely delicious cut of meat. It's not everyone's cup of tea though, and for some people the gelatinous texture can be off putting, so instead for them I recommend the area immediately above the shank bone. This area still has quite a bit of fat, but a more traditional muscle structure that doesn't contain a lot of collagen. Then about from halfway down the main part of the leg/shoulder is the more leaner section. The closer the meat gets to the actual body of the lamb, the less fatty it is, there really is something in there for everyone.\n\n## Cultural Context\n\nLamb is extremely important to the different cultures of the Middle East and sheep have been raised in the area for millennia. It is thought that sheep were one of the first animals to be domesticated by humans, and their domestication occurred between 11000 and 9000 BCE in Mesoptamia which is in modern day Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Since then the animals have played an important part as both a source of food, drink and clothing. Indeed many of the regions cheeses are still made with Sheep or Goat's milk to this day including Halloumi, Feta and Shanklish. \n\nIn both Christianity and Islam, sheep play an important part in their holy books. In the Koran, the story of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) narrates how he was instructed to sacrifice his son to god, and when he opened his eyes after doing it he found that his son had been replaced with a sheep. It's part of the Islamic faith to commemorate that sacrifice every year with the Feast of Eid Ul Adha. During which, well off families are required to slaughter an animal (or more) and divide it's meat amongst the poor and their families. In nearly all middle eastern countries that animal will be a sheep and that is one of the reasons why lamb continues to play a large part in the cuisines of the region\n\nApart from religious festivities Lamb legs are also served at all manner of feasts or large dinners especially when you have guests coming around. It's an impressive dish to plate but also a sign of respect when you serve something as precious as that to a guest. In the Middle east the shank is considered the most prized part of a lamb leg, and it's not uncommon for it to be presented to your most important guest.\n\n## Flavor Profile\nThe main flavor of the lamb roast is obviously going to be lamb which has a slight gamey flavor. The older a sheep gets before slaughter the more that flavor develops, and in some countries the gaminess is actually prized. Once you reach the mutton stage, the meat will have a significant gamey flavor that is not very far off from deer or elk. Now because we are marinating the meat in onions, the gaminess actually fades a bit, and I'm not sure if this is down to the Protease enzymes or the onion flavor covering it up. The onion flavor does penetrate into the meat, although it's more a sweet flavor than a harsh bitter one, because by the time the meat has cooked those flavor compounds have all broken down. The pepper and garlic in the marinade will lend the lamb some additional flavour, though don't expect it to be particularly garlicky or peppery. Having said that, if you come across a pocket where the lamb was studded with garlic or pepper, that will be significantly more flavoured and is a nice treat to find while eating. \n\nFor the vegetables they have a delicious caramelized flavor that comes from the onion topping that is added to them. The carrots will be soft and sweet, with a caramelized onion exterior that lends them some depth and savouryness. The Potatoes like the carrots will be savoury, and they will also do well to absorb some of the lamb fat, making them absolutely delicious. And finally for the miniature onions, they will have softened and caramelized nicely into balls of sweet oniony goodness, they are something you have to try to really understand what a roast onion tastes like.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Marinade\n* 100ml (3.3fl oz) water\n* 6-8 Large onions\n* 4 Cloves Garlic\n* 2 Tbsp Salt\n* 1 Tbsp Black Peppercorns\n\n### Lamb Leg\n* Lamb Leg or Shoulder Approx 2.5kg (5.5lbs) with bone or 2kg without\n* 6-8 Cloves Garlic\n* 1 Tsp Black Peppercorns\n* Nutmeg to grate\n\n### Roast Vegetables\n* 500g (1.1 lb) Carrots \n* 600g (1.3 lb) Mini potatoes or dice regular potatoes\n* 500g (1.1 lb) Mini onions or shallots\n* 100ml (3.3fl oz) Deglazed lamb juices\n* 1 Large Onion\n* 1 Tsp Salt\n* 1/4 Tsp Pepper\n\n\n## Directions\n\n### To make the marinade\n1. Peel your garlic and onions, and roughly chop to a size that is manageable for your food processor or blender. I cut my onions into 8ths and it does just fine in my blender\n2. Add all the marinade ingredients to your blender/food processor and process into a fine paste. The water will just help thin it out a bit, and make it easier to blend\n\n### To marinade the meat \n1. Prepare your lamb leg by trimming excess fat where desired. I recommend leaving a [small layer](https://imgur.com/Nybqfgb) on the top of the roast as this fat cap will stop it from drying out when cooking\n2. Slice your garlic into slivers, about 3-4 per clove so that they are an 1/8th of an inch or 1/4cm thick. \n3. Make about 15-20 holes in the leg with a small knife, and in each one place a sliver of garlic and 1-2 peppercorns\n4. [Coat the Lamb in the marinade](https://imgur.com/GfCXKlC) making sure it is pressed into the meat, I recommend placing the meat and marinade in a ziplock bag and pressing out any excess air. Place it in your fridge and allow it to marinate overnight for about 12 hours\n\n### To cook the meat\n1. Remove the meat from the fridge an hour before cooking, and scrape off all of the onion marinade from it's surface, [you'll notice the color has changed](https://imgur.com/zdi1E61)\n2. Prepare a deep baking dish with a wire rack, or by placing a bed of onion in the base of the dish. Place the lamb in the dish making sure it isn't touching the bottom\n3. Grate nutmeg onto both sides of the lamb leg making sure to get an even and light dusting over the whole thing. Cover tightly with foil\n4. Place in an oven set to 180c (350f) to bake for 3-4 hours\n5. Around the 2.5 and 3 hour marks remove and check to see doneness by poking with a dinner knife. Once there is little resistance, remove the foil and allow it to brown\n6. Remove from the oven once you can easily poke a knife into it \n7. Allow to rest for 15-30 minutes before removing any bones and carving it\n\n### To cook the roast vegetables\n1. Peel and slice your carrots, potatoes, and onions to your desired shape/size. I get miniature onions or shallots and keep the whole, and also try to find miniature potatoes\n2. In a blender combine the onion, salt, pepper and some deglazed lamb juices from the pan into a fine paste\n3. Mix the paste into the vegetables and place on a baking sheet lined with foil\n4. Roast the vegetables for an hour until fully cooked and softened\n\n\n## Tips and tricks\n* Your butcher can remove the shoulder blade for you and tie up the shoulder with twine to make carving easier. My mother in law does this and sometimes gets 2 shoulders instead of 1 leg because it is more tender\n* If your lamb shoulder or leg won't fit in the pan, you can cut through the joint of the shank to either remove it completely or just make it easier to bend", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/kfkvjb/if_youre_looking_to_cook_something_different_for/", "created_utc": 1608297135.0, "score": 2246, "author": "ObiEff", "num_comments": 169, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/kfkvjb/if_youre_looking_to_cook_something_different_for/", "html_title": ""}

Wanted to share how I butchered it and used it head-to-tail for various dishes over the week!", "selftext": "There were a lot of recommendations to roast the whole thing peking-style which sounded great, but I didn't have a braiser or pan large enough to catch all the fat and since there are only two of us it almost felt a little wasteful. I ended up separating the duck into pieces (watched a youtube video, it was much easier than I thought it was going to be), and did the following with them:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Legs:** Made the New York Times recipe for easy duck confit, and it was *amazing.* Sad I didn't have more duck legs for more confit. For anyone who wants to try it, I followed the advice on some of the reviews and placed it in the oven for 1 hour covered, 30 mins uncovered to make sure it didn't end up dry (as opposed to the \\~3 hours in the recipe) - highly recommend. [Recipe here.](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013002-easy-duck-confit)\n\n\n* **Breasts:** Pan-seared and served with a red wine/berry sauce. Serious eats has a really great pan-seared duck breast recipe (mine were quite small and only needed half the cooking time), and Robert Irvine's recipe for the sauce is pretty versatile and very tasty. [Duck Breast](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/02/pan-seared-duck-breast.html) and [Sauce](http://chefirvine.com/recipes/duck-breast-with-berry-sauce) recipes here. \n\n\n* **Skin:** Chopped it up into fairly large chunks and threw it all into a 4-qt saucepan with about a half cup of water, and let it roll on a quiet simmer for about an hour and a half until the pieces of skin had turned into crunchy golden-brown cracklings, which I fished out and drained. These were SUPER rich and I could only handle one piece, but my SO loved them.\n\n\n* **Fat:** Went into the pot with the skin (above). After I took out the cracklings, I poured it all into a jar and have been keeping it in the fridge. Apparently it's great to cook with - the thought of cooking in duck fat still kind of grosses me out a little so I haven't used it yet, but I'm getting there.\n\n\n* **Carcass:** I roasted the carcass, bones leftover from the confit, and the wings in a 400-degree oven for about an hour until they were nicely browned, and then went on to make a brown duck stock in my pressure cooker - cooked it all on high for 3 hours and it ended up with good body and very velvety. I left it unsalted so I could use it as a base for other recipes. Used [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/01/brown-duck-stock-recipe.html) for brown duck stock. So far we've made:\n   * **Garlic Thyme soup** \\- simmered some duck sauce with a bunch of garlic cloves, a few sprigs of thyme and root vegetables for 15 mins. The garlic gets soft and mellow and you can spread the cloves on a baguette as you eat, which I think is the best part.\n   * **Duck Ramen** \\- This was *so good.* Took enough stock for two bowls, added 2 tbsp miso, 2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp mirin and let it simmer for a few mins - at the end I tempered a couple eggs into the broth to make it creamy. Added noodles, scallions and leftover meat. \n\nHere's a photo of the various dishes I made - \n\n [https://imgur.com/a/IRAyGtX](https://imgur.com/a/IRAyGtX) \n\nIf you're looking for a good quarantine project, I recommend doing this!

Cooking is the only thing that feels real these days. Remote work is a weird affair, I started a new job in November and I've never meet my coworkers in the flesh. All my friends are just words in a screen, my family is a face on a screen. Adventures and travels happen through tv and movies and games. Even the new city I'm living right now (I moved in February last year just a week before quarantine) feels fake. Like another pretty video playing outside my window.\n\nFood in the other hand have become the new rhythm of the days. Going to shopping once a week, cooking twice a day. Looking for new recipes, new techniques. Trying breads and cakes. And afterwards eating them and starting planning the next one. The food is tangible, and makes you travel. You use your hands and you need to transform ingredients and make new things from them. Sometimes it can be frustrating when a recipe doesn't work, or when your family didn't like your dish. Other days is a big success and you feel elated. I did a Japanese Milk Bread last week and it felt such a huge achievement.

{"title": "I made lasagna with ricotta instead of bechamel and I\u2019m a convert", "selftext": "I was browsing Reddit and came across two posts in two days about bechamel being a life-changing improvement over ricotta. All my life every lasagna I had was with ricotta. I decided to give bechamel yet another try at a nice Italian restaurant after reading all the comments and I have now converted from being neutral on bechamel in lasagna to being solidly anti-bechamel in lasagna, to the point I secretly have hoped that bechamel lasagna doesn't become the default in restaurants. Some reasons:\n\n\n1. Ricotta has its own texture, bechamel is just more softness and smoothness in a dish that's full of \"soft\". Some people like textural contrast in their dishes\n1. Ricotta, much like sour cream/crema in Mexican food, adds a lightness to lasagna despite being rich itself. Bechamel adds (arguably too much) additional richness to an already-rich dish. \n1. The starch from the bechamel getting into the ragu gives the sauce a mouthfeel that 100% reminds me of Chef Boyardee\n\n**TLDR**: If you prefer bechamel in red lasagna, that's perfectly fine, but your preference of bechamel is not a black and white fact. It's not even \"more authentic\" (whatever that means), bechamel = Northern Italy, ricotta = Southern Italy. Eat whatever you like, let others eat what they want. \n\nThanks, reddit!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1jjp3r2/i_made_lasagna_with_ricotta_instead_of_bechamel/", "created_utc": 1742924029.0, "score": 2206, "author": "judolphin", "num_comments": 565, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1jjp3r2/i_made_lasagna_with_ricotta_instead_of_bechamel/", "html_title": ""}

I've had it for over 20 years now and I STILL love it to this day. Full recipe inside!", "selftext": "Hi everyone! Seven years ago, I made a promise to myself to learn as many of my 84yo Grandma's Chinese and Vietnamese recipes as I could. She's now 91 and it has been so rewarding to cook her dishes for the family (and get her nod of approval too)!\n\nWhen I first learnt how to cook Grandma's Cantonese and Vietnamese recipes, she did all the cooking while I frantically scribbled down notes and learnt how to guesstimate her measurements because, as she always said, \"If you have a larger plate, use more. If you have a smaller plate, use less.\"\n\nBut these days, she doesn't cook anymore, so when I cook using her recipes, it really hits home every time I eat it.\n\nFast forward to 2022, I want to celebrate my memories of my 91yo Ma Ma's Braised Chicken Wings and Mushrooms. You can see how the dish looks [here](https://imgur.com/a/YE5QBSx).\n\n**My Favorite Cantonese Side Dish**\n\nI\u2019ve never known a dish I\u2019ve loved more than Grandma\u2019s Braised Chicken Wings and Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce. The magic of this recipe doesn\u2019t just start when you taste it on steaming hot rice.\n\nIt starts when you lift the lid off the wok as the wings are gently braising in mushroom juices and you get that first waft\u2026its earthy aromas are just out of this world. And that\u2019s just the beginning!\n\nThe chicken is so silky it slides right off the bone then slowly melts in your mouth. The whole dish is cooked with oyster sauce, which gets infused in the mushrooms and transforms them into something spectacular. Think of a delicious thick, savoury glaze except it\u2019s inside the mushroom!\n\nOne bite and you\u2019ll fall in love.\n\nSeriously, just look at how the golden wings and mushrooms glow.\n\n**Which Chicken Cut Do I Use?**\n\nThe best part about this recipe is that you can use any cut of chicken you\u2019d like with oyster sauce and mushroom \u2013 breast, thigh, you name it.The reason why we choose wings above all the other cuts is because it has everything a tasty piece of chicken offers: a great meat to fat ratio and a way to cook straight from the bone.\n\nWe all know that anything cooked with the bone in tact tastes so much better.\n\nNow, if you prefer other chicken parts, this recipe will taste amazing with any of them!\n\n**How Can I Substitute Oyster Sauce?**\n\nI\u2019ll be completely honest\u2026you can\u2019t replicate the exquisite savoriness in a good oyster sauce. Luckily, they\u2019re fairly easy to come by in Asian supermarkets.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have oyster sauce handy in your pantry, don\u2019t panic! There are a few ways to get a flavor that resembles oyster sauce:\n\n* **Vegetarian oyster sauce.** Made exclusively from mushrooms, vegetarian flavoured mushroom sauce is a great alternative especially for vegetarians or anyone allergic to shellfish.\n* **Soy sauce.** While they\u2019re not exactly the same, you\u2019ll get the saltiness oyster sauce offers. Just use less than what you\u2019d normally add for oyster sauce and use some sugar to balance out the salt.\n* **Hoisin sauce.** The consistency of hoisin sauce is as thick as oyster sauce but has a sharp sweetness that can be adjusted with a little salt.\n\n**The Recipe**\n\n* Prep Time: 25 minutes\n* Cook Time: 30 minutes\n* Total Time: 55 minute\n* Servings: 6\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 100 g / 0.22 lb dehydrated shiitake mushrooms (or any mushrooms you have available)\n* 3 US cups water (saved from soaking mushrooms)\n* 1.5 kg / 3.3 lb chicken wings\n* 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped\n* 3 tbsp cooking oil\n* 3/4 tsp salt, or to taste\n* 1 tbsp sugar, or to taste\n* 3/4 tbsp chicken bouillon powder\n* 4 tbsp oyster sauce (3 tbsp for the marinade, 1 tbsp for braising)\n* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Soak the shiitake mushrooms in water for at least 20 minutes then drain. Keep the water aside for later.\n2. Marinate the chicken wings in oyster sauce, salt, sugar and chicken bouillon powder.\n3. Pour the oil into a wok and brown the garlic on a medium heat.\n4. Turn the heat up to high and toss in the mushrooms to sear for 2 minutes.\n5. When seared, add the chicken in and stir for 2 minutes.\n6. Add the saved mushroom liquid into the wok along with the oyster sauce and dark soy sauce.\n7. Bring the liquid to a boil then turn down the heat to medium/low to braise the wings and mushroom on a simmer for 20 minutes.\n8.

{"title": "For beginners: NEVER put water on hot oil", "selftext": "I know. I'm stupid. I was frying a second batch of Korean fried chicken late at night in what was only the second time I've ever deep fried something. The oil was heating up way too much after I put a few pieces in (I assume because I forgot to remove the crumbs/leftovers of the first batch from the oil) before it turned black. I had no idea what was going to happen. I thought it might explode. I took the pot away from the stove but it was still going crazy. So I panicked and put it in the sink and turned the cold water on. Just like when rice is boiling and you put a small amount of cold water to settle it before turning the heat down, this will work as well, right? Bad move.\n\nNext thing I know I feel heat in the air, I slip because of the oil that has exploded out of the pot on to the floor and most of it falls on my right hand searing it. Oil all over my kitchen sink. The smoke alarm is beeping. I could already see a pinkish bit of inner skin and blisters forming on the area below my knuckles. I didn't know to what extent I was burned. My whole hand could have been deep fried. I didn't react at all. The shock of it prevented me from doing so. I run cold water on the burn and it feels better but then read online that if your burn is more than 3 inches or it's on your hand, it's best to go to the ER. So I ended up going there at 12:30am right around the time I prepare to go to bed. It started to hurt for a good 10 minutes while I was doing registration there so I guess the shock wore off at the time. Luckily, everything was fine in the end and it wasn't a serious burn that was such a stupid thing to do. At least it's starting to look cool now as the blisters heal!\n\nBut lesson learned.

This stuff is **amazing.**\n\nVermicelli noodles, despite having an Italian name, are used super often throughout Asia, and in India it's most famously used to make this toasty, caramel-y, fragrant, and fucking bomb-ass dessert.\n\n*How the fuck do you make noodles into a dessert?*\n\nEasy. **You fry them in a fuck-ton of butter.** After roasting a cinnamon stick or two of course. Then you add in sugar, wait for it to melt, and then pour in milk straight into the hot pan. At that point, everything transforms and turns into caramel as the milk gets absorbed into the noodles.\n\nYou finish it off with cardamom at the last second and BOY HOWDY, that shit hits every note you could ask for. Spicy, creamy, toasty, buttery, and just a *little bit* of crunch in some parts from strands that got candied by the sugar. And the best part? The whole process takes like 20 minutes total.\n\nSeriously, seriously, seriously. Try This shit. If there's any dish that will make you look at the ingredients in your kitchen in a different way, it's this.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* Vermicelli noodles (Thinnest you can find)\n* Whole cinnamon stick\n* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom\n* 1/3 cup sugar\n* Milk, about 1 cup, can be adjusted\n* half a stick of butter OR 2 tbs ghee\n\n**Steps**\n\n* Toast the cinnamon stick in pan over medium heat, do not use oil\n* Add butter and 1 cup of noodles. Toss until golden brown\n* Lower temperature, add sugar, and continue to toss and toast until sugar is melted and begins to caramelize (keep things moving or noodles will clump together)\n* Add milk, and then simmer down for about 4 minutes\n* Turn off heat and mix in ground cardamom.

Couple suggestions for everyone:\n\n* Use more butter. The noodles should be practically swimming in it in the beginning, this is a good dish, not a healthy one haha\n* Use lower heat. Unfortunately the terms \"low, medium, and high\" are super ambiguous since we all have different stoves, but if it looks like things are browning too fast, just let up on the gas a bit\n* Keep things moving throughout the cooking process. Stir, toss, tape it to a jackhammer, do what you gotta do. Noodles clumping together is usually the result of them not being tossed around enough.\n* *Wait until the sugar is completely melted before adding the milk.* This is super important, remember you are literally creating caramel right in the pan, and if the sugar hasn't undergone the necessary pyrolysis before the milk is added, that caramel won't form.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/lqm0vt/meethi_sevian_is_an_indian_pasta_dish_thats/", "created_utc": 1614096724.0, "score": 2177, "author": "JetpackYoshi", "num_comments": 207, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/lqm0vt/meethi_sevian_is_an_indian_pasta_dish_thats/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "How to Break a Picky, Junk Food Addicted Eater - or How to Expand Your Palate", "selftext": "Hi Reddit. You may think this is about finally fixing my child's crummy taste buds. Nope, it's me.\n\nI am notoriously picky and had horrible food habits up until the last few years. I also have diagnosed ADHD and symptoms of autism, so when I'm even remotely upset I want to fall back on the same crappy foods.\n\nBut as I've learned to cook on my own, I've had a few breakthroughs. For example, I need most vegetables diced, because I can't stand large texture changes in food like getting a sudden big bite of carrot or bell pepper (turns out THIS is a large part of my aversion to salad, not the leafy vegetables themselves). I also don't hate vegetables, I've just (like most people) had a lot of badly cooked ones. I LOVE mushrooms now that I make them and properly crisp them up instead of making a slimy mess.\n\nAs I've made these discoveries, I made my biggest breakthrough yet: I don't need to start from scratch rebuilding my palate. **I can use all of those years of crap food to inform how to eat better, and cook things I like.** And no, I don't just mean making better alfredo sauce and chicken tenders at home- though that's nice too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Essentially, I realized that all the soda, candy bars, chicken tenders, burgers, pasta, and other nonsense I use to shove in my face can tell me something about what I like to eat. You may think \"of course these things taste good, they're nothing but sugar, fat, and carbs\". But do you like EVERY candy bar? Why are some things deliciously fatty and others gross and oily? Even among these crap foods, we can find some taste preferences to bring that picky eater out into the real world.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy drink of choice was either Sprite or lemonade nearly 100% of the time. Turns out, I just really fucking love lemons. As in, I could happily eat a literal halved lemon. I can use that! Let's make some lemon water, or EXTREMELY watered down lemonade at home. Let's trade those sour patch kids for some whole wheat lemon snaps. (I don't like lemons anywhere near my chicken, though. You lemon pepper folks are crazy.) I also love strawberries and grapes for similar \"sweet and tart\" reasons.\n\nMy favorite chips are by far salt and vinegar. Turns out I \\*criminally\\* underuse vinegar in my cooking at home, and generally underestimate the importance of acidity to my palate. Lemons, tomatoes, vinegar, relish, bring it on!\n\nThe only chocolate I really like is KitKats and cookies and cream bars. So, I can skip all of the \"mouthwatering\" triple chocolate fudge whatever that TV likes to make so sexy, because I know I'd be eating it on sheer impulse. This also tells me that what I love about KitKats isn't the chocolate, it's the wafer! I love the tender textures of short crusts, wafers (bring me more Pirouettes!), thin cookies, and by a slight extension, breaded meats. We can use that! I wanted to learn to like dark chocolate, so I found a bar that has mint crisps in it (the brand is Divine). Getting me to like a bar that's 70% cocoa is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nSpeaking of my love of chicken tenders, I also love tacos, pasta, pizza and burgers. Duh, you may say, who doesn't. But did you know a key (if not the main) ingredient in the seasoning for nearly all of those foods is onion powder? Of course- onion powder is super common. But it turns out I LOVE alliums of any and all kinds. Onions, garlic, shallots, leeks, scallions, I adore them all! I genuinely look forward to cooking any primarily veggie dish as long as I start with a big, fat, yellow onion.\n\nWe can really dig into that seasoning mix ingredient thing. Celery salt is another huge one- and I adore mirepoix. Discovering my love of cumin and chili powder (via tacos) led me into discovering the beauty of curry. I don't like coconut- and that's fine! I don't need to like every curry or even the most common or authentic curries. Bring me a tomato and cream based one that has soffrito in it- who cares, it's my food!\n\nSpeaking of cream, I adore it. Butter, too. It's not exactly a healthful choice, but it does mean that I can use a bit of cream and butter to make other things taste a little better to me. It also tells me that I don't always need the \\*sweetness\\* as much as the \\*creaminess\\*. So while I can't take black coffee, I do just fine with a bit of Silk creamer (which has surprisingly little sugar, is much creamier than milk, and has less saturated fat than half/half).\n\nSpeaking of creamy textures - my biggest comfort foods on a bad day are refried beans and mashed potatoes. Okay, so mushy is my love language! Now, there is never a day where I am too beat down to make myself cook a big pot of drained pinto beans in a little oil then pound out some anger with a masher. Add in some water and spices (onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, and chili powder in a 2:1:1:1 ratio), some taco sauce and cheese, and boom: a bowl of happiness to cry into without all the extra salt from Taco Bell.\n\nI don't like the bitterness in dark green leafy vegetables, but it turns out what I hate even more is the almost gritty texture. I can throw baby spinach in nearly any dish and be fine. When I want broccoli in an alfredo, I boil/steam the crap out of it until it's a mushy mess then mash it! I made a sweet potato hash the other day with a full bunch of SWISS CHARD. Can you imagine getting your wailing 7 year old to eat swiss chard? You can! Just finely dice it and throw it in anything spinach would make sense in. If they complain about the green, introduce them to more \"rainbow\" foods in general- the aforementioned sweet potato hash had orange sweet potatoes, red bell peppers (also diced) and tomato paste, yellow eggs and garlic, white onions, and purple shallots! I sympathize deeply with children on this front, and you'd be surprised how much more okay they are with eating \\*many\\* things when they actually see it being made.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe takeaway is: sugar and fat don't actually make \\*everything\\* taste good to you, or your kids. If you can identify the tastes and textures you love and hate there are broader preferences to be found.\n\nedit: I'm glad some people are finding this helpful! I wanted to add that The Flavor Bible is almost entirely lists of spices / ingredients / regional cuisines followed by lists of flavors that go well with them. If you maybe don't have a broad enough horizon to know what to do with an ingredient you've isolated as something you really like, it could be a helpful resource.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/vojl93/how_to_break_a_picky_junk_food_addicted_eater_or/", "created_utc": 1656624977.0, "score": 2156, "author": "BerrySundae", "num_comments": 128, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/vojl93/how_to_break_a_picky_junk_food_addicted_eater_or/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Our tv show America\u2019s Test Kitchen was recently named Best Culinary Television Series by the International Association of Culinary Professionals; in March of this year Cook\u2019s Illustrated won the American Society of Magazine Editors\u2019 much coveted award for General Excellence. But it\u2019s not all birria tacos and homemade croissants. \n\nA couple of years ago, non-managerial staff of ATK - test cooks, editors, culinary producers, videographers, video editors, copy editors, and on-screen talent, among others - began to organize a union. You can read more about our reasons for unionizing on our website: https://www.atk-united.com. The testimonials from present and past staff are especially enlightening. We won our union election decisively in July last year (105-yes/17-no, TYVM). \n\nWe began contract negotiations in November of 2022 and are still hard at it. Though ATK staff are paid considerably less than staff at competing companies, leadership has barely budged on the matter of wages. Check out our Instagram post about how quickly an annual salary of $51k evaporates in the Boston economy: https://www.instagram.com/p/CyOD3jgOaxX/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== (spoiler: the numbers don\u2019t work.) \n\nATK has a long history of underpaying staff. The company was acquired by Marquee Brands in February of this year, well into contract negotiations. The new leadership team didn\u2019t create this unjust wage structure, but now they\u2019re faced with a choice: fix it, or leave it as is and continue to profit from it as their predecessors have done. Currently they\u2019re choosing the latter. \n\nWe in the union have held our fire for months in the hope that ATK leadership would recognize that they need to make positive changes. Because they continue to be intransigent, we\u2019ve decided to take our case to the public, starting with a petition. \n\nIf you believe that the non-managerial staff of America\u2019s Test Kitchen, one of the most respected food media companies in the US, deserve to make livable wages that are in line with their competitors, please sign our petition: https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/americas-test-kitchen-staff-deserve-fair-and-competitive-wages?source=direct_link\n\nThank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/176ertq/americas_test_kitchen_union_demands_fair_wages/", "created_utc": 1697137702.0, "score": 2154, "author": "Major_Mall2971", "num_comments": 246, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/176ertq/americas_test_kitchen_union_demands_fair_wages/", "html_title": ""}

AKA Poached Whole Chicken or Bak Chit Gai, it's a simple, traditional, and almost-required dish for Lunar New Year, tied with many auspicious sayings and superstitions.", "selftext": "There's a saying in Chinese that goes something like, \"No chicken, no banquet.\" This dish is steeped in tradition and good luck, and I'm extremely grateful to get to document how my dad does it and to share it with our community :) \n\nThis post will cover:\n\n* How to boil the perfect, juicy **White Cut Chicken**\n* How to make my dad\u2019s addictive **Ginger Scallion sauce**\n* The traditional Chinese way to **carve and plate a chicken** from head to toe\n* The various Chinese idioms / meanings tied to whole chicken\n\nHere are a few pictures of [what the recipes look like](https://imgur.com/a/RpP2hQH) if you want a visual :)\n\n# Superstition: Chicken\n\nIn Chinese tradition, chicken is intertwined with many sayings and superstitions of good fortune, wealth, and resilience.\n\nEven though my parents didn't have much meat growing up in China, this is one of the dishes my parents always ate on Lunar New Year's eve and other festivities.\n\nEspecially with auspicious foods, Chinese superstition involves a lot of creative word-play. The word for chicken, g\u0101i in Cantonese and j\u012b in Mandarin, sounds like several words of good fortune.\n\nJust to name a few phrases that my parents shared with us:\n\n* h\u00f3u sai gaai \u597d\u4e16\u754c - A Cantonese phrase that roughly translates to good world, good life.\n* d\u00e0j\u00edd\u00e0l\u00ec \u5927\u5409\u5927\u5229 - A Mandarin phrase that roughly translates to great luck, great profit.\n* y\u00e1uh t\u00e0uh y\u00e1uh m\u00e9ih \u6709\u5934\u6709\u5c3e - A Cantonese phrase that literally translates to: \"has a head, has a tail.\" It means \"good beginning, good ending.\" This is one of the reasons why it's important to make a whole chicken for Lunar New Year.\n* j\u00e1au p\u00e0h j\u00e1au w\u00e0h \u6293\u6252\u6293\u93f5 - A Toisanese phrase, related to eating the chicken legs, that roughly means \"face all challenges with persistence.\"\n\nSo, basically, eat a whole chicken if you want to live. (jk)\n\n## Using a Proper Knife\n\nThe most intricate part of this recipe is the last step, where we carve up the chicken into pieces we can easily grab with a chopstick.\n\nMy dad has two knives - a \"chef's knife\", meant for vegetables and boneless meats, and a heavy duty cleaver, meant for occasions like this.\n\nIt's a lot harder to do this without a proper cleaver, so here are a few options you can look up:\n\n* Dexter Russell Heavy Duty Cleaver\n* [The same brand (not same model) as my dad's 40 year-old cleaver](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?ut_sk=1.XR79XxYXt6sDAC8yCxOJl3U5_21380790_1609898344895.Copy.1&id=630231282048&detailSharePosition=interactBar&sourceType=item&suid=6C603E4D-6164-4DA8-8C61-790B2DE81EE4&shareUniqueId=6881406817&un=5fbdcd42b3253757dfb454b3d994b7d3&share_crt_v=1&spm=a2159r.13376460.0.0&sp_tk=dThBVGNzQld2OWY=&cpp=1&shareurl=true&short_name=h.4S1KiFP&bxsign=scdfCTl7pW2s3tCpp7nnG1tdxUFrtYdbbyIT60TmslnzN4-9ZCBvFh4ynYYvYfyQWF2AOvFNA2Xinbs5tp8w4mgHthhB2LS4_4Gbo7_S0r1O7U&sm=ddd6d0&app=chrome) (ships from China)\n\nIf you don't have one, you can also try cutting at the various joints, which my dad didn't demonstrate but said is possible.\n\nYou'll also want a thick wooden cutting board which helps absorb the impact of forceful chopping.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Chinese knives, check out my [previous post on the basics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/kr7bsq/basic_chinese_knife_skills_101_%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%88%80%E6%8A%80%E5%B7%A7_i_sat_down/).\n\n## Choosing a Chicken\n\nIf you're making this for Lunar New Year and following Chinese tradition, you'll need to buy a chicken that has its head, feet, toes, etc. intact.\n\nThe two main types that my dad uses are \"Yellow Hair Chicken\" and \"Kwai Fei Chicken\".\n\n* Yellow Hair Chicken tends to have more chewy meat. Many Chinese people prefer this.\n* Kwai Fei Chicken tends to have a larger quantity of meat on it, with thicker meat that's more tender.\n\nFor this specific recipe, my dad got hooked up by his old restaurant with their wholesale pricing, but you can usually buy these at an Asian grocery store or market.\n\nIf you don't have access to an Asian grocery store, you can just buy as fresh and whole of a chicken as you can get, and try to stick to a chicken that's around 4 pounds so it cooks more evenly in the pot.\n\nThe fresher the chicken, the better. And, if you can, buy it sustainably.\n\n## Sourcing Chicken Sustainably\n\nThe most environmentally friendly (and freshest) way to source chicken is to raise your own, just like my parents did back in the day.\n\nObviously, that\u2019s not easy for most of us, so some options would be to shop with a local farm or butcher, or to buy Animal Welfare Certified chicken.\n\nAmongst the strongest seals of approvals is the **Animal Welfare Certified** label from the Global Animal Partnership, a non profit originally created by Whole Foods Market in 2008.\n\nThis is one of only 3 food certification labels endorsed by the ASPCA, one of the oldest and largest humane societies in the world, the others being \u201c**Certified Humane**\u201d and \u201c**Animal Welfare Approved**.\u201d Although they\u2019re not as widespread, they set much higher standards than the more common USDA Organic certifications.\n\nIf you live in the US and feel inclined to support these causes, you can look for GAP certified meat at Whole Foods, or through Butcher Box, a popular meat delivery subscription service that sources their meats in line with all of the highest standards that we\u2019ve touched on.\n\n## The Recipe\n\nMain Ingredients\n\n* 4 lb **whole chicken** (traditionally for Lunar New Year, the chicken has its head & feet intact)\n* 2 oz **green onion**\n* 1.5 oz **ginger**\n* 5 tbsp **corn oil**\n\nAdditional Flavor & Seasoning\n\n* 1 tsp **salt** (for boiling water)\n* 2 tsp **salt** (for ginger scallion sauce)\n* 1 tbsp **sesame oil**\n\n# Step 1 - Boil water, add salt\n\nSet the stove to high heat and start boiling a generous amount of water in the pot you'll be using.\n\nWe'll want to be able to fully submerge our chicken in the water to make sure it cooks evenly.\n\nWe'll also be adding **1 teaspoon of salt**. My dad says not to add too much here.\n\n# Step 2 - Prepare & cook chicken\n\nWait for the water to come to a boil.\n\nWe'll be doing a couple of things in this step, mostly to ensure that the entire chicken is cooked evenly for maximum tenderness.\n\n* **Pierce a hole in the skin in the neck -** This helps the water flow through the chicken cavity to help it cook more evenly.\n* **Stretch the legs away from the body several times -** This helps to avoid having a big clump of chicken meat that's undercooked.\n* **Slowly dip the chicken 3 times in the boiling water -** This helps even out the temperatures on the inside of the cavity and on the exterior of the chicken. Make sure the water is already boiling before you do this.\n* **Add the chicken and make sure it's completely submerged -** If you have to add more boiling water, do it.\n\nFrom here, we'll cover the pot.\n\nHere's a rough heat / timing overview:\n\n* Once the pot's been covered, leave it on high heat for 5 minutes as the water comes to a boil again.\n* Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for another 35-40 minutes. The larger the chicken, the longer you cook it. The sweet spot is 4 pounds.\n* Check if it's done. If so, transfer it to an ice bath. (More on both of these later.)\n\n# Step 3 - Mince scallions and ginger\n\nWhile we wait for the chicken to cook, we'll start on our sauce by mincing our **green onions** (2 oz) and **ginger** (1.5 oz)\u200b.\n\nMy dad said the exact ratio and amounts don't matter too much. Most recipes I've seen use more scallions than ginger.\n\nHaving a surplus of sauce is a great problem to have, since you can use it on pretty much everything. (I LOVE dousing my rice and vegetables in this addictive sauce)\n\nFor the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.\n\nFor the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.\n\nMy dad is using separate plates to hold the green onions and ginger. The ginger will be cooked first in the next step, so this makes it easier to separate.\n\nAlso, feel free to use a food processor here instead of mincing.\n\n# Step 4 - Heat oil, cook ginger scallions\n\nWe'll heat up our wok on high heat and add **corn oil** (5 tbsp).\n\nThe oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.\n\nA good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts \"shimmering\", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.\n\nWhy do we do this? By cooking everything in oil, we unlock the aromatics of the ginger and green onion.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.\n\n# Step 5 - Flavor the sauce\n\nWe'll add **salt** (2 tsp) and **sesame oil** (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.\n\nDo a taste test and adjust if necessary. My dad emphasized multiple times how important it is to add sesame oil here, so make sure you don't skip it.\n\n# Step 6 - Prepare an ice bath\n\nGrab a big bowl and dump a few handfuls of ice into it. Fill it roughly halfway with cold water.\n\nThe ice bath is very important - once the chicken is done cooking, we need to immediately cool it down.\n\nWhy is this so important?\n\n* **It helps the meat contract and locks the juices inside - I**f we skip this step, juices will flood out as we chop the chicken into pieces.\n* **It helps the skin stay attached -** Without this step, we'll have a bunch of loose pieces of skin everywhere.\n* **It gives the skin a bit more of a chewy texture**\n\n# Step 7 - Determine if the chicken is done\n\nOnce the time draws near, we can uncover the pot. Poke the thickest part of the chicken (around the thigh) deeply with a chopstick.\n\nIf blood or red fluid leaks out, we need to cook it for a few more minutes.\n\nIf the fluid is clear, it's ready for the ice bath.\n\nFeel free to use your newfound chicken broth however you'd like. In the video, my dad created two additional dishes (a soup and a veggie) out of it by boiling bok choy with some ginger.\n\n# Step 8 - Lift and transfer to ice bath\n\nCarefully take two chopsticks under the chicken wings, and lift it over the pot.\n\nSuspend it over the pot for 30-45 seconds to let some of the residual water drip out.\n\nThen, carefully transfer it into the ice bath. Prepare for a splash!\n\nLet the chicken sit in the bath for 5 minutes, occasionally pouring water over the surface of the chicken and rotating the chicken in the container.\n\n# Step 9 - Carve the chicken\n\nThis could honestly be its own post, but for now it will live in a very detailed step in this recipe.\n\nThis is a lot easier to follow in our video, where we dedicate about 6 minutes of time to this segment.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind before you start.\n\n* My dad\u2019s done this hundreds of times, and it took him about 10 minutes from start to finish. It\u2019ll probably take a lot longer if you\u2019re a beginner like me, but the main thing is just to make sure your cleaver is sharp and that you\u2019re moving carefully and deliberately.\u00a0\n* If you don\u2019t already have a cleaver, it\u2019s still technically possible, but I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making this dish.\n* For easier, safer cutting, you should use a larger, thicker cutting board that\u2019s preferably made of wood, and you should place a moist towel underneath it to increase its stability.\n\nHow to plate, according to Chinese tradition:\n\n* Basically everything is plated - even parts that aren't readily edible like the head.\n* Each piece of chicken is laid out on a large plate according to where it was on its body, head to toe, right to left.\n* You'll often see this served on a large oval-shaped plate.\n\nOrder of operations:\n\n* Cut off the neck and feet, cut into small pieces\n* Cut and place the head and butt at opposite ends of the middle axis of the plate\n* Remove the wings and thighs\n* Cut and split the torso into two halves (front and back)\n* Split the back in half, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut and pry away the breast bone, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut the thighs and wings into small pieces\n\nCutting techniques:\n\n* A technique my dad uses a lot involves making a shallow slice to wedge the cleaver, and then hitting down on the blade with our palm to drive the blade through the bone.\u00a0\n* In our recent knife skills interview, my dad talked about the 3 different parts of the blade - the root, the belly, and the tip. When chopping through bone, he always makes contact with the root, or the part of the blade closest to the handle.\u00a0\n\nWhen I first started this project, documenting how my dad carves a chicken was high on the list of traditions I wanted to learn and share. It always feels like I\u2019m watching an artist at work when I see my dad gracefully chop and plate everything.\u00a0\n\nEvery cut has an intention, and every piece has a place. Almost everything goes on the plate, and nothing is wasted. Especially for Lunar New Year and other celebrations, bak chit gai is meant to be one of the main decorative centerpieces on the dinner table, and carving it up into beautiful bite-sized pieces is an honor that I hope to take on one day for my own family.\u00a0\n\n# Our why\n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading!

{"title": "My 91yo Grandma's Vietnamese Braised Fish recipe is a keeper! It's a weeknight staple for our family. Full recipe inside!", "selftext": "Hi, everyone! I want to share a Vietnamese weeknight classic that I grew up eating over rice with fresh cucumber slices. Back when Grandma would cook daily for us, it was a regular because it's so versatile and easy. These days, I make it and share it with her when I'm craving her home cooking. You can use any fish you have on hand and all it takes is some aromatics, a quick homemade caramel and time for it to braise!\n\nYou can see how the braised fish looks [here](https://imgur.com/a/4VHwxYj).\n\n**A Vietnamese Family's Comfort Food**\n\nYou may be surprised to know that when Vietnamese families go out for dinner, the dishes ordered aren\u2019t too different to those eaten at home. A typical night out would look something like this: bubbling C\u00e1 Kho T\u1ed9 served smoking hot in a claypot along with Canh Chua (Sweet and Sour Soup), white rice and a few vegetable side dishes.\n\nSounds rather simple, right?\n\nThe Chinese in me (who often enjoys restaurant food we don\u2019t make at home) was always confused by this.\n\nBut as I watch the fish steaks in my C\u00e1 Kho T\u1ed9 slowly caramelizing away and thickening into that glorious sweet savory sauce, I can finally understand why:\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with hearty, wholesome comfort food.\n\nNot to mention, this recipe is ridiculously easy to whip up for weeknight dinners and can be made with any of your favorite fish.\n\nOur secret is to keep it braising low and slow so that it\u2019s super tender and fragrant. This helps the natural juices infuse into the sauce for the best sticky flavor bomb to pour all over your rice!\n\n**The Recipe:**\n\n* Prep Time: 25 minutes\n* Cook Time: 1 hour 5 minutes\n* Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes\n* Servings: 6\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**For The Marinade:**\n\n* 650 g / 1.4 lb fish (preferably in steak form)\n* 3 cloves garlic (finely chopped)\n* 2 red shallot (finely chopped)\n* 3 chili (optional)\n* 2 tbsp fish sauce (or to taste)\n* 1 1/2 tbsp sugar (or to taste)\n* 1 tsp chicken bouillon powder\n* 1 tsp pepper\n* 1 tsp cooking oil (with a neutral flavor)\n\n**For The Sauce:**\n\n* 1 US cup coconut water (or water)\n* 4 tbsp oil\n* 3 tbsp sugar (or to taste)\n* spring onion (finely chopped; to garnish)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Combine the fish with the sugar, chicken bouillon powder, pepper, fish sauce and oil as well as half of the garlic and red shallots. Let it marinate for a minimum of 20 minutes.\n2. To make the caramel, heat up a claypot on low heat and add the oil and sugar in. Let it brown. **Note:** Work VERY quickly with the sugar because it will burn if left on the heat for too long.\n3. Add the remaining garlic and red shallots to cook for 20 seconds, then pour in the coconut water and turn the heat up to high.\n4. Add the fish in and let it simmer for 30 seconds, then gently flip it over to coat the sauce on the other side. Pour the remaining marinade over it.\n5. Let the fish braise on a low-medium heat for 1 hour or until soft with the lid partially on. The sauce should be slightly thick and sticky when it's done. If you plan to add chili, you can put it in now. **Tip:** Scoop the sauce onto the fish every 15 minutes to make sure every part is covered.\n6. Garnish with spring onions and serve immediately with hot rice!\n\n**Recipe FAQs:**\n\n**Which fish should I use?**\n\nC\u00e1 Kho T\u1ed9 is commonly made using catfish, but Grandma has used other types before. Really, any fish that has few bones and lots of meaty flesh (such as salmon, barramundi, basa, cod or sea bass) is ideal for this recipe.\n\nIt\u2019s also delicious when there\u2019s a generous amount of fat as it melts in your mouth after braising.\n\n**What\u2019s the best fish sauce brand to use for C\u00e1 Kho T\u1ed9?**\n\nWe used Squid Brand Fish Sauce for this recipe because that\u2019s what we had on hand, but there are many other varieties including Red Boat and Son Fish Sauce. Each will have their own unique flavor profiles so make sure to season to taste.\n\n**What can I use if I don\u2019t have a claypot?**\n\nSometimes Grandma will use a large saucepan with a flat bottom, but skillets and pots will work just as well so long as they have a straight base for the ingredients to lay on.\n\n**Tips For The Best Results:**\n\n* **Use coconut water.** As with any Vietnamese braising recipe, coconut water adds a subtle sweetness that gets infused into the ingredients.\n* **Adjust the heat while the sugar is cooking.** Sugar burns easily, so keep an eye on the sauce. If it\u2019s darkening too fast, IMMEDIATELY turn the heat down to low.\n* **Use a spatula to flip.** The catfish will become very soft during the braising, so use a spatula to avoid breaking any flesh.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/xbc75n/my_91yo_grandmas_vietnamese_braised_fish_recipe/", "created_utc": 1662881303.0, "score": 2105, "author": "WokandKin", "num_comments": 268, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/xbc75n/my_91yo_grandmas_vietnamese_braised_fish_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

Would you be happy to receive this as a gift?", "selftext": "I am making homemade butter using heavy whipping cream and then creating compound butter.

I\u2019m going to be making the gift box as cute as possible. Should I include homemade bread? Is 40 ounces of homemade butter enough for recipient.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve decided to decrease the amount to 4 ounce tops based on the feedback. I\u2019ll utilize 2 oz jars so people can freeze half and save half. Both sets of my parents and my partner\u2019s parents love to cook- they\u2019re all butter obsessed. My cousin and his gf recently got into cooking. My brother and his gf love to cook. My bff already knows what she\u2019s getting and is plotting the ways she\u2019s going to utilize the butter. The only one with dietary restrictions is myself, other than my grandpa\u2019s diabetes. There is only one child in my family, my niece, and she will be receiving toys and games instead. I think I\u2019m going to gift my grandpa something else too because he\u2019s not the biggest cook but he does love butter- but he\u2019d probably like something else too?

{"title": "A definitive-ish Guide to Chinese Pulled Noodles", "selftext": "If you\u2019re like a lot of people, you might\u2019ve seen those Chinese noodle pullers and thought to yourself, \u201cthat seems cool. I kind of want to learn how to do that\u201d. Then you go online, give it a quick google, and\u2019re greeted an absolutely bewildering mix of discussion on the topic: everything from people that say it\u2019s impossible to makes outside of China, to people playing around with adding nutritional yeast or L-cysteine to mix, to Buzzfeed videos claiming an easy foolproof version.\n\nSo with this post, I want to (1) try clear the air a bit, and clarify what a hand-pulled noodle actually is (2) teach you three different \u2018hand-pulled noodles\u2019, for three different skill levels and (3) teach a couple ways to actually enjoy them. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot of ground to cover. This is a novella of a post, I know \u2013 I\u2019ve actually had to put parts of it in the comments below because I hit reddit\u2019s character limit (40k for a post, who knew?). Save it for later if you\u2019re not in the reading mood. But I hope by the end of it all, you\u2019ll understand \u2013 or at least appreciate - Chinese hand pulled noodles a little better.\n\n###What is a hand-pulled noodle?\n\nSo one of the things that makes it awkward to give a \u2018recipe\u2019 for hand-pulled noodles is that hand-pulled noodles aren\u2019t really a \u2018dish\u2019 per se. They\u2019re a technique. And to make things even more complicated, that English translation of \u2018hand pulled\u2019 really refers to **two separate techniques**: *Lamian* and *Chenmian*. \n\nThis distinction\u2019s important. It\u2019s why /u/oliverbabish tried and failed mightily at hand pulled noodles, while Inga Lam over at Buzzfeed seem to make them without a hitch \u2013 because Babish was trying to make Lamian (infamously difficult) and Lam was making Chenmian (common enough in home kitchens in China). Some other similarities/differences:\n\nLamian (\u62c9\u9762) | Chenmian (\u62bb\u9762)\n:--|:--|\nMade in restaurants | Made at restaurants or at home\nOften learned by going to special schools or apprenticing | Easy to pick up \nAlkaline Noodles | Non-alkaline Noodles\nRequires a finely milled flour (more on that later) | A finely milled flour is nice, but AP Flour can also be used\nRequires a special type of alkaline called penghui (more on that later) | All you need is flour, water, and salt\nRequires many fancy movements to get it to a pullable consistency, as alkaline stiffens dough | Only needs a long rest (three hours or more) to get to a pullable consistency\nOriginates from the Northwest, Lanzhou specifically, popularized throughout China by the noodle shops that bear its name | Can be found all across north China and even out into other spots in Central Asia\nDelicious | Delicious\n\nNow, both Lamian and Chenmian can come in different shapes. Likely the most classic version of both would be those spaghetti-looking sort, the kind that you\u2019d probably immediately recognize as \u2018noodles\u2019. In this shape, Lamian is still called\u2026 Lamian. Easy enough. But perhaps confusingly, Chenmian in this shape can also be called Latiaozi (or, in some parts of the country, also Lamian\u2026 ugh).\n\nBut besides that, another common shape is wide-and-flat. If following the Lamian method, those flat sort are generally called *kuanmian* (\u5bbd\u9762, literally \u2018wide noodles\u2019); if following the Chenmian method, they\u2019re called\u2026 Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve already covered Biang Biang noodles, but I\u2019ll include them too because they make a *great* introductory pulled noodle. So the way I\u2019ll organize this post is by going over:\n\n1. *Biang Biang Noodles*. Wide-and-flat Chenmian that make for a great \u2018my first pulled noodle\u2019.\n\n2. *Chenmian, a.k.a. Latiaozi*. Spaghetti-like Chenmian that\u2019re slightly more involved than Biang Biang (they\u2019re at slightly more risk to break, and are a touch tougher to get thin).\n\n3. *Lamian.* Spaghetti-like alkaline noodles that are\u2026 a beast. The mount Everest of Chinese cooking. \n\nBefore we jump in with though, a quick word on flour.\n\n###What flour to use for pulled noodles?\n\nWhenever we do any sort of dough related thing, we end up getting a lot of questions on the subject of \u201cChinese flour\u201d. Is it bleached? Is it lower gluten? Etc. There seems to be this nagging misperception out there that flour here is somehow materially different than flour in the West.\n\nIn truth, there\u2019s nothing overly different about Western flour and Chinese flour. That\u2019s not to say that everything\u2019s 100% the same \u2013 it\u2019s just that that there\u2019s an equally large difference between, say, King Arthur and Gold Metal as there is among those and Chinese brands.\n\nAs always, there\u2019s a few different variables that\u2019re important when picking out flour:\n\n1. *Gluten/Protein content.* For this, we want a high gluten flour. Gives the noodle more bite. For Lamian you want a flour that\u2019s more than 12% protein. For Chenmian, anything over 10% protein should work ok.\n\n2. *Age.* Flour changes as it ages. Fresher flour is stretchier than older flour. In an ideal world, your flour would be less than 6 months old. Matters much more for Lamian than Chenmian (notice a trend?)\n\n3. *Fineness.* The best flour for noodles and dumplings is quite finely milled, akin to an Italian 00 flour. Nice to have for Chenmian, but critical for Lamian.\n\nFor making Lamian, there\u2019s actually a certain brand of flour most of the noodle shops tend to reach for called \u2018\u585e\u5317\u96ea\u2019 \u2013 [this is what it looks like, if you\u2019re curious](https://imgur.com/TpccLTw). It\u2019s 12.2% protein, usually used within a couple months of milling, and is extremely finely milled. But while that brand of flour is certainly a beaut to pull noodles with, extremely similar flours *do* exist in the West\u2026 in the form of Italian 00 flours.\n\nSo the TL;DR on flour is:\n\n* For Lamian, use an Italian 00 Pizza Flour. In the videos we used Caputo\u2019s Chef Pizza Flour, which\u2019s available online and popular among home pizza makers. It\u2019s finely milled, pretty fresh, and is 13% protein. Works like a charm.\n\n* For Chenmian, 00 Pizza Flour is preferable but not required. All purpose flour is ok, just make sure that it\u2019s not *too* low in protein. Our AP we usually use is 10.8% protein. \n\n**Wait, so for Biang Biang/Chenmian I can use AP Flour?**\n\nYes, that\u2019s right. But you\u2019ll make your life much easier if you do an autolyse first. In both bread and noodle making, this will develop gluten and make for a stretchier end result (hey, just what we want in a pulled noodle!)\n\n* Dissolve your salt with your water, then combine the water with the flour bit by bit\n\n* Knead for ~1 minute until everything comes together\n\n* Cover with a plate, rest for 30 minutes\n\n(note: in Western baking a \u2018true\u2019 autolyse is sans salt)\n\n---\n\n###Biang Biang Noodles\n\nSo \u2018Biang Biang noodles\u2019 ring a bell, it\u2019s for good reason. Ever hear of the restaurant Xi\u2019an Famous Foods? Began in the basement of a Flushing mall\u2026 adored by pretty much everyone including the late Anthony Bourdain\u2026 blew up with 15 locations throughout New York\u2026 spawned countless copycats throughout the Anglophone world? Biang Biang is the main offering on their menu. It\u2019s a noodle that\u2019s\u2026 easy to love. \n\nNow, [that recipe we shared previously?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/axyghr/recipe_biang_biang_noodles_with_chili_oil_topping/). It\u2019s a good recipe. A lot of people\u2019ve enjoyed it. Feel free to continue using that one if you\u2019re already used to it. But by learning a couple basic hand pulled noodle techniques, the process can become even easier, I feel. \n\n**Ingredients, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1.  *00 Pizza Flour, preferably, -or- AP Flour (\u4e2d\u7b4b\u9762\u7c89), 200g.* If you do not use the 00 flour, do that autolyse beforehand.\n\n2. *Salt, \u00bd tsp.* \n\n3. *Water, 100g.* This dough is 50% hydration. Most pulled noodle doughs will be around that level.\n\n4. *Oil, 3 tbsp.* For coating the dough during resting. \n\n**Techniques, Biang Biang noodles:**\n\nAs befitting something with a grand total of four ingredients and made solely with your hands\u2026 pulled noodles are all about technique. Following a recipe for something like pulled noodles would be a little like reading a walkthrough for a game like DOTA 2. A great starting point no doubt, but somewhere along the way the onus falls on you to actually, like\u2026 get good.\n\nFor both this one and the following though, luckily that\u2019s not going to be all that difficult. There\u2019s just three techniques that you\u2019ll need to know: hydrating, kneading, and pulling. \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (\u732b\u6293\u624b): A way to evenly hydrate your flour.**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is adding water to flour bit by bit, then rubbing the flour between your thumb and the back of your fingers. What you\u2019re looking for is a final result called \u2018suizi\u2019 (i.e. \u2018wheat grains\u2019), which looks something [like this](https://imgur.com/LM98kpj). \n\nThe reason evenly hydrating the flour is so important is because we don\u2019t want to add too much water to the dough. This is also one of the reasons why finely 00 milled flour can be so helpful \u2013 simply by how well the stuff hydrates.\n\nLike, add 50 grams of water to 100 grams of AP Flour. Do a rough mix with a chopstick, and you\u2019ll get something [like this](https://imgur.com/JLDyxhX). Compare that against those \u2018suizi\u2019 from above, which was made with some finely milled 00 with the *same amount of water*. If you\u2019re anything like me, you might look at the first picture and think to yourself, \u2018damn, needs more water!\u2019 But it doesn\u2019t need more water \u2013 it just needs to be hydrated better.\n\nCat claw + autolyse is a powerful way to make even the most \u2018meh\u2019 of AP flours the hydrate like they should.\n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (\u7b97\u76d8\u5b50): Kneading and aligning the gluten into one long rope.**\n\n[Here\u2019s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) an imgur album detailing the process step-by-step. I know it looks like a lot \u2013 it\u2019s not that bad, I promise.\n\nBasically, you\u2019re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again. It\u2019s not necessarily any harder that the standard kneading motion for bread, just different.\n\nWe\u2019re doing this because we not only want to develop the gluten network in the dough, but also *align* the gluten strands. The idea\u2019s somewhat similar to the slap-and-fold technique in Western bread-making, albeit with a different goal in mind. The slap-and-fold gets the gluten into a sort of criss-cross pattern, while here we\u2019re aiming for one long rope.\n\nWhen we go over Lamian below, this process becomes both insanely important and incredibly tedious. Luckily, for both Biang Biang and Chenmian, you just need to do this for ~8 minutes or until the dough gets smooth.\n\n**Technique #3: Biang-ing and Ripping the Noodle:**\n\nThis noodle gets its name from the characteristic sound it makes as it smacks the table. Far too few food names are onomatopoeias.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/94ad9z).\n\nBasically, what you\u2019re going to be doing when pulling is first rolling it out into a ~10 inch to ~2.5 inch sheet. Then, you\u2019ll make a small indentation in the noodle with a chopstick \u2013 this will be your \u2018ripping point\u2019. Next you grab the noodle, smack it ~10 or so times against the table while pulling gently to lengthen it out.\n\nThe way you hold the noodle while pulling/smacking is quite important, however. If you pinch the dough at all, it can end up breaking. What you want to do is lay the noodle over your four fingers, and simply using with your thumbs to hold it in place- force shouldn\u2019t really be applied. Here\u2019s a picture of [what your hands should look like](https://imgur.com/EeI3XDK).\n\nOnce the noodles are about arms length, rip it in half at the indentation that you made your chopstick. We usually rip one end like we did in the above video, but you could rip both ends, or you could keep it in one big \u2018loop\u2019. Up to you.\n\n**Process, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by \u2018cat clawing\u2019 the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Refer to the \u2018cat claw\u2019 technique for detailed instructions. Once all the moisture\u2019s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick (as normal, like you usually would bread and such) to get it into a ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the \u2018making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the \u2018making the abacus string\u2019 technique for more information. What you\u2019re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular box, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long \u2018rope\u2019 of abacus string. Punch it flat. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then smack it into a rectangle \u2013 it\u2019s a bit tough to describe, so I\u2019m going to [cheat with a streamable](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a ~7x4 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here, but that\u2019s the size that we were working with.\n\n6. *Cut the dough into four long strips.* So each strip would be roughly ~1x7 inches.\n\n7. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Remember \u2013 we usually use a few tablespoons worth of oil here for this step, so don\u2019t be shy there. When you\u2019re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate. That said, don\u2019t go nuts - we\u2019re not vacuum sealing.\n\n8. *Rest the dough strips for at least 3 hours and up to 8 (or overnight if need be).* We find 4 hours to be about ideal for resting. Going up to 8 is fine too \u2013 24 hours is perfectly workable as well, but after that the dough will likely become a bit *too* soft and pull-y.\n\n9. *Remove a strip, patting slightly with a paper towel if overly oily. Roll it out into a ~2.5 to ~10 inch long sheet.* Exact size here\u2019s nothing to obsess over, just what we find ourselves working with.\n\n10. *Biang the Noodle: Press down the middle of the noodle with a chopstick.* Refer to the \u2018Biang-ing the Noodle\u2019 technique for more details. The indentation in the noodle should [look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/ZHD06sW.jpg). After we slap the noodle longer, that indentation will be where we tear it open (to get an even longer noodle).\n\n11. *Biang the Noodle: Hold the noodle in your palm, lightly pressing with your thumb. Smack the noodle down against your work surface around ~ten times to lengthen the noodle.* Refer to the \u2018Biang-ing the Noodle\u2019 technique above for more details. You\u2019re looking for [something about a meter long, like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg). \n\n12. *Biang the Noodle: In the center of the noodle, push through the groove that you made with the chopstick and pull apart the noodle to get something even\u2026 longer. We break one end of it.* Tearing apart will look something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg) \u2013 again, some people break both ends, and some keep the circular shape. \n\n13. *Boil for ~1 minute until it floats.* Work through your other noodles as each is boiling.\n\n---\n\n###Chenmian\n\nSo Chenmian are also referred to as Latiaozi, and \u2013 interestingly \u2013 in Xinjiang as \u2018Laghman\u2019. They\u2019re basically going to be almost identical to our Biang Biang noodles from above, albeit in that long/round spaghetti-like shape.\n\nSo, this recipe is going to share a *lot* with the previous recipe. So I\u2019m going to cheat and refer to the above recipe a bit. If you\u2019re just perusing this post out of curiosity, the substantive differences are the \u201ctechnique #3: pulling\u201d and the process starting from step #6.  \n\n**Ingredients, Chenmian:**\n\nSame as the Biang Biang above.\n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (\u732b\u6293\u624b)**\n\nAgain, [Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8). \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (\u7b97\u76d8\u5b50)**\n\n[Here\u2019s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) that imgur album detailing the process step-by-step again.\n\nRemember, you\u2019re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again.\n\n**Technique #3: Pulling the Noodles**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/yznx53).\n\nOverall, the pulling technique for this noodle\u2019s pretty self-explanatory. What you\u2019ll do it roll it out a touch by hand (until it\u2019s, say, ~6 inches long), then pull it. Once you can start to feel the resistance in the noodle, stop. Then continue to thin/lengthen the noodle by repeatedly smacking it against the table, ala the Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNote that there *will* be a limit as to how thin you can get the thing. What you\u2019re looking for is something a touch thicker than fresh spaghetti, or about the same thickness as Japanese ramen. If you\u2019re staring at a noodle that\u2019s still a little too thick, you\u2019ve got two options. First, you can fold the noodle in half and continue to smack in against the table. This\u2019ll help things get a bit thinner, but you do have to be careful \u2013 it\u2019s very easy for the noodle to break when folded. Second, you\u2019re still working with a stubborn noodle, you can leave it there and let it rest as you work through the remainder \u2013 picking up again after five minutes or so, you can generally get it a bit thinner.\n\n**Process, Chenmian:**\n\n[Video of making Chenmian is here if you\u2019d like a visual](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by \u2018cat clawing\u2019 the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Once all the moisture\u2019s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick to get it into a craggily ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the \u2018making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the \u2018making the abacus string\u2019 technique. What you\u2019re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular \u2018box\u2019, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long \u2018rope\u2019 of abacus string. Punch it flat with your fists. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then sort of smack it into a rectangle \u2013 [streamable is here, again](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a 4x7 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here.\n\n6. *Cut the sheet in half, but be sure to pay attention to which side the long side was, as that\u2019s the direction that we\u2019ll be cutting.* Cutting this sheet in half is actually optional, but especially if you\u2019re just getting started out I\u2019ll be easier to work with shorter noodles.\n\n7. *Cut into 1cm strips.* Or roughly 12 strips per half-sheet, for 24 noodles total.\n\n8. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Don\u2019t be shy with the oil. Also,  when you\u2019re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate \u2013 something [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP) is perfect.\n\n9. *Rest for 3-8 hours, or up to 24.* To relax the gluten. Again, 3 hours is the minimum here, we generally like it at around the 4 hour mark. \n\n10. *Remove a noodle, slightly pat off some oil with a paper towel if needed.* Sometimes it can get a bit too oily to work with.\n\n11. *Pull the noodles.*  Pull the noodle according to technique #3 above \u2013 remember not to get too greedy re thinness!\n\n12. *Boil the noodles until a touch past al dente, ~45 seconds, then shock under running water.* \n\n---\n\n###Lamian\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enters this recipe.\n\nBefore we do anything, let me pass on you the advice one dude at my local Lanzhou Lamian shop gave *me* a number of years back when I was badgering him for tips on Lamian technique: \u201cGive up. Do not try. You\u2019ll never know how to make Lamian.\u201d\n\nAt the time, I took it as a sort of \u2018oh you\u2019re just a foreigner, you\u2019ll never understand\u2019 kind of thing (the closest thing a white dude in China can get to a microaggression lol). Now, I understand the wisdom in his words. I wish we\u2019d listened.\n\nThis is by far the hardest recipe we\u2019ve ever done on our channel. It\u2019s so tough that it makes Har Gow look like a relaxed weeknight dish. The only thing I can think of that can even come *close* to it is the proper sourdough-starter smiling Char Siu Bao, and that\u2019s a recipe where commenters reporting failures outnumber commenters reporting successes about 10:1.\n\nSo just\u2026 stop. Turn back. It\u2019s not worth it. Scroll right on past this, move on with your life. You\u2019ve got the above recipes for Chenmian, right? Those are fun. You can impress all your friends with those. It\u2019s good enough for most people \u2013 an untelling eye probably couldn\u2019t even tell the difference.\n\nMaking Lamian, you **will** fail your first time. And probably your second. And probably many times after that. But if you keep at it\u2026 one day, things\u2019ll click for you. And you can be content in the knowledge that you\u2019ll be one bad-ass noodle maker.\n\n**Why is Lamian so hard?**\n\nSo like, Chenmian wasn\u2019t too bad. Pretty much any intermediate home cook can make Biang Biang noodles. And while the thinner spaghetti-like sort might have a couple more moving pieces, in the grand scheme of things they\u2019re not so bad, either.\n\nWhat makes Lamian *so* difficult is the introduction of alkaline.\n\nFor those of you out there that don\u2019t live and breathe the world of Asian noodles, alkaline noodles have this *fabulous* bite to them. In the mainland this texture\u2019s referred to as \u2018tanya\u2019 (\u5f39\u7259), though perhaps you might\u2019ve heard it called by the Taiwan term \u2018QQ\u2019. You could think of it sort of like\u2026 *al dente*. What makes alkaline noodles so beautiful is that they retain that sort of \u2018al dente\u2019 texture, even after being fully cooked. Alkaline is what makes Japanese Ramen, Japanese Ramen; it\u2019s what makes Cantonese Wonton Noodles, Cantonese Wonton Noodles.\n\nAnd in my personal opinion, alkaline ends up being increasingly important as the noodle itself gets thinner. Super thin noodles can easily end up much too soft if you\u2019re not careful \u2013 while I don\u2019t think Angel Hair pasta quite deserves its bad reputation, I do believe that it would be a much better product if they added alkaline to the mix.\n\nNow, for most alkaline noodles the process isn\u2019t all that hard. You add a bit of sodium carbonate to the dough (or a solution of sodium carbonate/potassium carbonate called Kan Sui/Jianshui), and continue along your merry way\u2026 rolling things out thin and either cutting them with a knife of a pasta maker.\n\nMaking an alkaline noodle that can *pull*? Alkaline stiffens dough! It\u2019s like\u2026 a counter-intuitive proposition. Would almost feel like magic. And unfortunately for everyone trying to replicate this stuff outside of China? It kind of *is* magic \u2013 or at least, uses a magic ingredient. That is\u2026 Penghui.\n\n**Penghui**\n\nLet\u2019s get something out of the way at first. Go on Amazon. Search \u201cPenghui\u201d. Find anything?\n\nAt least sitting here in the Spring of 2020, I can\u2019t find jack. The only way to find Penghui is by ordering industrial quantities from Alibaba or through specialty middlemen (e.g. a place like ChinaHao).\n\nSee, penghui, traditionally, is the ash of a specific soda plant called \u2018Penghuicao\u2019, or Halogeton Arachnoidius in English. The old school way of making the stuff would be to burn the plant, then when it\u2019s at a specific temperature to splash water in it. Apparently, it then forms a rock [like this](https://imgur.com/NBqqgYE). I\u2019m not sure how any of that makes sense (ash + water = rock? someone help me here\u2026), but then to use the penghui\u2026 you\u2019d chip some of that off, mix it with water, then apply it to your noodles.\n\nNow, like the ash of many other soda plants, traditional Penghui was undeniably alkaline - probably from either potash or sodium carbonate. But besides that, it must\u2019ve had *something* else in the mix, something that helped the noodles pull. While I can\u2019t seem to find **any** information on the chemical composition of traditional penghui (feels like a fun thesis for any anthropology grad students out there lol), luckily for us\u2026 it actually doesn\u2019t really matter. Because basically no one\u2019s using that old school Penghuicao ash these days, either.\n\nWhether for economic or food safety reasons (depends on who you ask), in 1989 food science researchers from the Lanzhou University in Gansu developed a mix of additives that could be used in place of the traditional Penghui. And while it\u2019s a matter of debate as to whether the explosion of hand pulled noodle shops in China over the last few decades is *because* of that innovation, it\u2019s undeniably true that the spread of Lamian noodle joints and manufactured Penghui happened in tandem. Sometimes I joke that all those noodle shops around the country are really just a massive Penghui sales operation \u2013 a joke with a shred of truth to it, because if you peek back into the kitchens at Lamian shops, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to be greeted with [the same blue bag](https://imgur.com/eurEgph) at each one.\n\nWhat\u2019s in that blue bag? Well, I\u2019m glad you asked. It\u2019s:\n\n* 50% sodium chloride (salt)\n\n* 45% sodium carbonate. Can be produced at home by baking baking soda in an oven for ~1 hour at 150C.\n\n*  4% sodium triphosphate, a.k.a. STPP. An emulsifier that\u2019s totally available in the West \u2013 actually, often it\u2019s used in American supermarkets in order to make fish/shrimp retain more water (looks more plump, while also allowing them to sell you more water and less seafood). Here, the sodium triphosphate acts as a dough strengthener, making the dough less likely to break when you pull it. \n\n* 1% sodium metabisulfite. A reducer which is used as a preservative in winemaking, and also totally available in the West. The function here is to help relax the dough, making it easier to pull.\n\nNow, given that all of these components are available in the West, the question of whether we could just mix all this shit together naturally follows. And the answer is\u2026 kind of.\n\nIn the linked video, I try my hardest to make my own \u2018homemade Penghui\u2019 using those component parts. The problem is that we totally use about two grams of Penghui in one batch of noodles, so that means one 200 gram serving of noodles uses something like 0.02g of sodium metabisulfite and 0.08g of STPP. With those kinds of quantities, accurate **mixing** of the powders become absolutely imperative (you can\u2019t make a solution either, as sodium metabisulfite quickly oxidizes when in contact with water). So without an industrial screw mixer, it\u2019s really easy to, say, have some batches have a bit too much reducer\u2026 and some have not quite enough.\n\nBut does it work? Sorta. By taking every precaution I could think of making the homemade Penghui, we were able to pull it to a roughly spaghetti-thin noodle, but no thinner. \n\nI *would* recommend the homemade Penghui to experienced noodle pullers abroad as a stopgap between Penghui shipments. I *would not* recommend the homemade Penghui to a beginner. When learning, when you confront a batch of failed noodles you want to be sure that it\u2019s your technique that\u2019s the problem, and not your Penghui. So if you\u2019re actually serious about learning Lamian, go on ChinaHao (or a similar website), bite the bullet and just\u2026 drop the $70 and buy too much Penghui.\n\n**Ingredients, Lamian:**\n\n1. *Pizza Flour -or- Chinese Lamian Flour, 250g.* The finely milled flour for this one is non-negotiable. Again, for standardization purposes, we used Caputo\u2019s Chef Pizza Flour.\n\n2. *Ice Water, 120g.* So traditionally in the Northwest they use ice water in summer and tap water in the winter. The basic idea is that the ideal Lamian kneading temperature is around 28C, but shouldn\u2019t really exceed 30. Why that is I can really find a compelling answer for, but the advice seems to ring true from experience. Of course, most of our kitchens are temperature controlled these days, so we would personally opt to use ice water all year long.\n\n3. *Salt, \u00bd tsp.* 2 grams. To be mixed with the ice water.\n\n4. *Any dense oil, e.g. Olive oil, ~3 tbsp.* Dense oils seem to \u2018cling\u2019 better to the dough while working it. We used Sichuan Caiziyou (virgin rapeseed oil), but olive oil also worked well in our tests. While working the dough you\u2019re going to be **constantly** oiling your hands and the dough to make sure things don\u2019t dry out. I\u2019m giving an amount because it\u2019s certainly true that some of the oil ends up in the dough itself. It\u2019s approximate because it changed from batch to batch for us \u2013 we found that it ended up ranging between two and four tablespoons.\n\n5. *Penghui (\u84ec\u7070/\u62c9\u9762\u5242), 2g; to be mixed with 10g of water.* Again, if first starting out, I\u2019d strongly advise biting the bullet and just figuring a way to source some Penghui. If you would like to try a homemade Penghui, this is how I did it. In a mortar, I pounded 100g of salt until powdery (super annoying), then did a quick pound of 90g of sodium carbonate, 8g STPP, and 2.5g (3/4 tsp) sodium metabisulfite. Be careful with the sodium metabisulfite \u2013 while this minuscule amount is probably ok, it would be more responsible for me to advise using PPE and/or going outside when using it. It\u2019s not overly toxic or anything, but do not smell it as if it\u2019s inhaled directly it can temporarily make you unable to breathe for a spell. Then I passed that through a fine mesh sieve a couple times, then mixed in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on speed three for 30 minutes to combine. In hindsight it might have been a good idea to bake my salt first to ensure that there\u2019s not excess moisture there. But regardless, store your mixture with food safe dessicants (i.e. those little silica gel packs that help absorb moisture). \n\n**Techniques, Lamian:**\n\nOk, so I usually like giving these \u2018high level overviews\u2019 of what\u2019s generally going on before I dive into the weeds. But if I try to give a high level overview here, you\u2019ll think I\u2019m speaking a different language:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nFeels almost easy when I put it that way lol. Some of these techniques are the same as what we went over before, but (1) the abacus string method will be more involved and (2) \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (\u732b\u6293\u624b)**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nSame Cat Claw technique as above, nothing overly special going on. Just hydrate that sucker. \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (\u7b97\u76d8\u5b50)**\n\nOk, so this is probably the most complicated move on the list \u2013 it\u2019s similar to what we covered above, only you\u2019ll need to be a bit more paranoid throughout the process. [Here\u2019s](https://imgur.com/a/24vympg) the imgur album detailing it step-by-step. \n\nJust like the above noodles, the basic idea is that you\u2019re kneading it by continuously curling the dough. You get a long log of curled dough, then flatten the sucker out, then repeat. Getting the dough flat enough to be repeatedly curled up takes a bit of technique though. While you could theoretically crack that nut however you wanted (a pasta maker is one possible \u2013 but not necessarily easier - route), the common move is to (1) punch the dough down then (2) press it flat further by crossing your hands and smushing down the edges (3) repeating the hand cross flattening with your hands crossed in the *other* direction to make things totally even and flat.\n\nThis is the most important step in the entire process. At some Lamian schools, the final test is to make an entire batch of Lamian from start to finish in less than 20 minutes flat. Of those 20 minutes, this step right here takes about 15-18 minutes. \n\nYou\u2019ll know you\u2019re ready to move onto the next step when it can form a smooth hole if you tear it. [I like this visual right here](https://imgur.com/mppalAF). This was a batch of Lamian dough that was *almost* ready. The hole on the right is smooth, the hole on the left is jagged. You want the hole to look like the one on the right.\n\nThis might take you a long time to do it. The saying in Lamian making is that you need to do this \u201c9 times 9 times\u201d (i.e. 81 times). That\u2019s ultimately just a saying though, because the number \u2018nine\u2019 sounds a lot like \u2018a long time\u2019 in Mandarin. But we\u2019ve counted before. We tend to need 30-40 times of repeating this process to get to the point we need. This takes us about a half hour of kneading, but it\u2019s very normal to knead for 40 or even 50 minutes when you\u2019re just starting out. \n\n**Technique #3: Three folds, two wraps (\u4e09\u53e0\u4e24\u5305): Evenly apply your Penghui**\n\nWhen we add the Penghui, we\u2019ll mix it with water first, then apply it bit by bit into the dough. \n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/ykp6n0).\n\nBasically, when you add the Penghui, it\u2019s pretty important that it evenly gets incorporated into the dough. You don\u2019t want bits of your Penghui water \u2018spilling\u2019 out of the though, so the three-folds-two wraps method helps keep all that inside.\n\nDon\u2019t feel like learning yet *another* technique? No problem. You can also just continue to use the abacus string method from before \u2013 applying the Penghui when the dough is flat. You\u2019ll just need to be good about only adding a *bit* of Penghui to the dough at a time.\n\n**Technique #4: Combing the Gluten/Testing for Pullability (\u62c9\u6761\u987a\u7b4b)**\n\nSo, there\u2019s two ways to do this step. [This is a clip of the classic \u2018twisting\u2019 approach](https://streamable.com/dhlc7s) done in Lamian noodle shops, but let\u2019s just set that one aside for now. We feel like it\u2019s easier to use the following method of gluten combing, which also helps give a nice \u2018test\u2019 of sorts for pullability.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/zwn5bf).\n\nBasically, what we\u2019re doing is repeatedly pulling and folding the dough over itself, slapping it against the table between each pull. This\u2019ll not only help strengthen the gluten network, but it\u2019ll also help give us a \u2018test of sorts\u2019 to ensure that the dough is ready for pulling. If you can pull and fold it over itself at least five times without breaking (six is ideal), you are ready to move onto the next step.\n\nBut what if it\u2019s not quite there? Well, now\u2019s the point where you need to trust your hands and your instincts, and veer off-recipe. You\u2019ll need more Penghui and more time kneading. Mix another batch of Penghui water, but maybe only add, say, a fifth of it at first. Use the abacus string method, knead it for a few more minutes. Then try to gluten comb again.\n\nNote that for this step, you need to make sure everything is super oily. Your hands, the table, your dough, everything. \n\n**Technique #5: Pulling (\u62c9\u9762)**\n\nOk, so I want you to get your expectations straight here.\n\nYou might have visions in your head about wildly pulling these noodles and putting on a show for everyone. You are not a Lamian master: do not try to do this. Your Lamian will become uneven and break.\n\nThis is a game of applying force evenly. It is not easy. It is entirely possible that you will do everything up to this step perfectly, but screw up here \u2013 getting some noodles that look thinner than angel hair, and some that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a Biang Biang.\n\nWork slowly and deliberately. If you fuck up, you fuck up \u2013 no shame there. But don\u2019t fuck up because you were overconfident. The noodle cares not for your ego.\n\n[Streamable of the pulling is here](https://streamable.com/iii5sh).\n\nNotice that we\u2019ll be adding some flour on the table for this step. Each time you pull, toss the center of the noodle in your little \u2018flour mountain\u2019 as you do it.\n\nYou\u2019ll need five pulls to get to a \u2018normal thin\u2019 Lamian. That\u2019s be about the same size as spaghetti \u2013 those can either be good in soup or stir-fried. Six pulls gets you to a \u2018whisker thin\u2019 Lamian, which\u2019s usually what\u2019s served in the Lanzhou beef noodle soup. Seven pulls gets you to \u2018dragon beard\u2019 thin Lamian\u2026 which\u2019s thin enough to thread a needle, is completely insane, and way beyond our skill level. \n\n**Process, Lamian:**\n\nOk, got all that? Remember, high level overview:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nAs always, [there\u2019s a video too if you\u2019d like a visual](https://youtu.be/6DgITQSonv4).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then cat claw the mixture into the dough.* Refer to the cat claw technique for details.\n\n2. *Knead everything into a ball, ~1 minute, then cover and rest for 30 minutes.* At the Lamian shops they\u2019ll generally move straight on to the next step here, but we find that kneading\u2019s a bit less painless with a quick rest.\n\n3. *After 30 minutes, remove the dough and roll it out into ~1.5 ft log. Thoroughly rub your hands and work surface with oil.* Again, make sure that everything is good and well oiled though this entire process. Rub your hands and work surface obsessively. \n\n4. *Punch down to flatten the dough. Then continue the making the abacus string method for ~30-40 minutes.* Refer to the \u2018making the abacus string\u2019 technique for detailed instructions. And remember: 30-40 minutes is an *estimate*. The timing will depend on your skill in doing this. It would be almost unheard of to do this in less than 15 minutes. I\u2019d guess that it\u2019ll take 40 minutes for a beginner. The dough will be finished once (1) small bubbles begin to form as you\u2019re flattening it and (2) it forms a smooth hole when torn.\n\n5. *Combine the two grams of Penghui with ten grams of water.* Make sure it\u2019s completely dissolved.\n\n6. *Flatten the dough ala the abacus string technique, then wet your hands with the Penghui water and apply it to the top of the dough. Then follow the three-folds-two-wraps technique outlined above.* Refer to the three-folds-two-wraps technique for detailed instructions. To reiterate, you can also just continue to use the abacus string technique here if you prefer \u2013 simply add the Penghui a bit more conservatively.\n\n7. *Fold the dough in half, roll it into about a foot and a half log, then liberally apply oil to your dough, hands, and table.* A well oiled situation is important for the gluten combing.\n\n8. *Comb your gluten.* Refer to the gluten combing technique for more information. If you can fold the dough over itself 5-6 times without breaking, you are ready to move onto the next step. If you can\u2019t, go back to step five but add only a fifth of the Penghui water, and knead using the abacus string method for another ~5 minutes. Loop through these until you\u2019re at the correct consistency.\n\n9. *Flour your work surface, pull the noodles.* Pull according to the pulling technique outlined in technique #5 above. Remember, work slowly and deliberately. We'd recommend five pulls for fried noodles, six pulls for soup noodles. Tear off the very end of the dough \u2013 that bit\u2019ll be garbage, unless you got a better idea.\n\n10. *Immediately toss in some boiling water to cook.* Until just past al dente, ~45 seconds. If not eating immediately, you can flour them up\u2026 but try to devour sooner or later.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/h8s8mz/a_definitiveish_guide_to_chinese_pulled_noodles/", "created_utc": 1592134429.0, "score": 2084, "author": "mthmchris", "num_comments": 134, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/h8s8mz/a_definitiveish_guide_to_chinese_pulled_noodles/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "I got two whole ducks, broke them down, and turned them into duck fat, crispy skin snacks, duck stock, duck confit with the legs and pan-fried duck breasts. It was very gratifying and tasty! What are your favorite duck recipes? I also got a rabbit too, any recommended recipes for that?", "selftext": "[Picture Album](http://imgur.com/gallery/rAHbxcI)\n\nAfter putting this together it almost seems like an ad for serious eats lol. Love that site though. Since I have more time to do some cooking, I went to the asian market(highly recommend because all the xenophobic people are avoiding that place) and got two whole ducks for pretty cheap, I think around 12 bucks each?\u00a0 And this is what they produced:\n\n\nI first followed the seriouseats guide to break down a duck, while also removing and gathering as much fatty skin as\u00a0possible.\u00a0https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/01/how-to-butcher-a-duck.html\u00a0I removed the breasts as well and broke down the carcass a little too. Threw the heads away though, they looked nasty.\n\n\nI then followed the guide for Rendering Duck fat and making \"Quacklings\" as they call it.\u00a0https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/01/how-to-render-duck-fat-and-make-cracklings.html\n\n\nThe rendered fat from two ducks almost filled up a 32 oz mason jar, and that's not including the fat in the skin I left on the thighs and breasts. Crazy how much (delicious) fat they have.\u00a0\n\n\nThe bones, wings, and feet were [roasted in the oven for flavor](https://i.imgur.com/1Kdd74C.jpg), then simmered with some typical stock veggies for hours, basically following this recipe:\u00a0https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/01/brown-duck-stock-recipe.html\n\nI did not use tomato paste and wine since I wanted the duck flavor to shine, though I can confirm it's a delicious addition to chicken stock. After straining the stock normally I put it back on the oven and let it reduce even more to concentrate the flavor and color. Love how it turned out.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the breasts, I got them dry and then salted them and left them uncovered in the fridge overnight(typical dry brine), and then followed Gordon Ramsay's video for making duck breast, but threw in some onions right before it went in the oven. It was delicious!\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAfmfCArUgA\n\n\nAnd finally, the duck legs were used for duck confit. If you didn't totally know what this was like me, it's an old method that was used to preserve duck by cooking it slowly in its own fat then leaving it submerged in the solidified cooled fat. The recipe said it's safe to eat for a month in this form but I imagine it's edible for even longer. I used kenji's recipe:\u00a0https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/01/classic-duck-confit-recipe.html\u00a0where you process aromatics and herbs and coat the duck legs in this mixture for a day or two, then slow cook in the fat for a few hours. I then carefully crisped up the now-delicate skin in a nonstick pan. The meat was very soft, moist, and delicious.\u00a0\n\n\nAll in all, I highly, highly recommend it. I'll absolutely be doing it again. It was so gratifying to use every part of the duck and create a bunch of delicious stuff. However you'll notice I didn't do much with spices or add-ins because I really wanted to taste pure duck flavor. Never had it before and it was amazing. But now I'm wondering what other recipes you recommend that use duck, or what side dishes go great with duck? Definitely going to make duck fat potatoes.

Eventually, I gave up and just switched to using canned beans in my recipes.\n\nI was reading an article about things that can affect cooking in general, and one of them was the hardness of the water.

It worked! It has also made a difference in cooking barley, split peas, and lentils. I just wish I had figured this out sooner.

I get a little crazy when it comes to tracking things so I couldn't help myself so I ended up pricing 234 common items.\n\nIt's just me and my wife so we were really wasting a lot of food shopping at Costco, despite cooking every single meal at home. I was always convinced that Whole Foods would be too expensive because the $/unit price was much higher. However, by only buying exactly what I need I was able to get much better quality with no waste and no increase in cost.\n\nCouple disclaimers, I live in Hawaii, and I priced all of the items at Whole Foods based upon the best quality item available. I chose free range, pasture raised, cage free, organic, local, etc... whenever possible.\n\nOn average, unit cost per item at Whole Foods was 2.93x as much as Costco. There were 15 items at Whole Foods that Cost less than similar items at Costco. Costco was missing 98 of the 234 items and Whole Foods was only missing 10 of the 234.\n\nOverall, I'm still going to shop at both Costco and Whole Foods (we eat 10lbs of carrots a week and they cost 276% more per lbs at Whole Foods!), but now I now exactly where I should by which item that we regularly cook with.\n\nHope this helps somebody out there!\n\nEdit: People asked for the spreadsheet, here you go: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15X0fJxkq24R0q8Jk0C9ZQ9lMvKzqHPckkCe8npMN-Iw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15X0fJxkq24R0q8Jk0C9ZQ9lMvKzqHPckkCe8npMN-Iw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWow my first silver!!

{"title": "For those who want to be a chef. Please read.", "selftext": "Just a personal account and realistic advice to know what you are wanting to get into. I don\u2019t hate my job or my life, i actually love it and take pride in it. But its not for everyone:\n\n1) Do NOT waste money/time going to school. Atleast not if you are expecting to be a head chef, executive, or sous out of the gate. You are going to be in debt for many many many years. No self respecting chef hires someone out of culinary school, even one as prestiges as CIA, and starts them higher than line cook / saucier / garnish cook.\n\n2) Its a industry built up with time, resume, and connections. The best advice i would honestly give you is if you are passionate about cooking take up a 2nd job as a prep cook at night. If you have managment / manual labor experience than great, but you need to prove food handling. No one will hire you as a cook without experience, but find a local place hiring prep/ pantry cooks and start working your way up. Dont waste 4 years at culinary school, spend 4 years working in a restaurant or two getting hot line experience.\n\n3) The hours suck, and pay sucks. Just take a perspective into what you are giving up. Chef de Cuisines / Head Chefs / Exec\u2019s often work Tuesday-Sunday. 6am-8pm. Never take weekends off, and holidays are mandatory. No vacations from September-January due to holidays. \nI\u2019m a Executive Sous Chef, have worked at 7 restaurants over 14 years and i make $55,000/yr in an upscale restaurant. My Head maybeee makes $70,000. MAYBE. And he\u2019s a 30 year vet.\n\n4) Earn your Servsafe and become a proctor for Servsafe Exams. This actually stands out more than a degree for me, and you will need it anyway in most restaurants.\n\n5) That all being said, its fun, fast paced, and rewarding. Just dont think the praise will come from others. It is a thankless grind. Chefs will throw things at you, there will be kitchen fights, you will get burns, and scars, and need to seal a bleeding finger with super glue on a saturday night then finish service for 4 more hours. Guests are a nightmare, and will only speak with you if there is a problem. \n\nBut at the end of the day, we are chefs, and we serve memories on a plate and its a beautiful industry... just know that its a lifestyle and not a career. Hope this helps some one!\n\nEdit: 6) People mistake Chefs as people who cook 24/7 and thats why they get into culinary. Chefs. Dont. Cook.\nOr we rarely do, maybe 20mins every 14 hour shift. Line cooks do what they say - cook. Chefs do menu development, price checking, write schedules, recieve and place orders, hire, fire, process invoices, handle vendor relations, run the pass (expo).

A golden brown dry crispy mush while I prepped the other stuff. \n\nThey gave the curry a really great depth of flavour, with practically no chunks to feel. \n\nThe technique has evolved into blending the raw mushrooms into a paste and cooking it down to practically nothing and mixing it into the curry paste and cooking that down further before adding the meat, and then the fluids.

Then cover with some cheap chipolata sausages and go to town. \n\nToday was different! I was done with work earlier than expected and googled the shit out of traditional couscous steaming techniques. I decided to steam my cous using some broth (ok I admit it was a bouillon block broth, nothing fancy here).\n\nI steamed it 3 times - massaging all the granules with salt water and olive oil before and in between steams to avoid lumping. Enjoying the sun in the kitchen, mindfully feeling the granule texture shift from wet sand to small springy grains. \n\nAs a topping to my cous, I slowly caramelized onions and let my dried raisins swell in some hot extra chicken broth. Chopped some mint and parsley and half a cucumber as a lil salad for mixing in the couscous. I also roasted some quartered red onions, carrots, a sliced lemon and ras-el-hanout marinated chicken thighs in the oven.\n\nThe food was good, but the couscous was amazing. I could taste every granule separately. My hands were soft from massaging with olive oil. The raisins were like savory sweet bomb-bubbles, the onion gave a smoky sweet tinge to the texture. It was beautiful. The process of making it was beautiful. What a dish.\n\nTL;DR: It is heathen to make couscous any other way than steaming it 3 times. \n\nEdit: [This](https://marocmama.com/how-to-cook-couscous/) was the technique I followed.

Just because someone was willing to eat a dish as a kid, does not mean they are willing to eat it now.  \n8.) Adding meat to things is not always welcome, even if you cannot imagine a meal without it.  \n9.) Chunks of raw onion, garlic, or ginger can be a turn-off.  \n10.)

Also, a gin and tonic with a sprig of rosemary brings it from being an at home drink to a $10 restaurant cocktail\n\nMint: Wonderful just making mint tea with hot water, some salads work really well with mint\n\nChives: As a garnish on most savory dishes, eggs, chicken salad, ranch\n\nSage: Chicken stock, pickling things, brown butter sage dishes, in cocktails\n\nParsley: Pesto, pasta aglio e olio, stocks, great with many savory dishes\n\nThese are just what I thought of off the top of my head.\n\nMy point is there's really no reason (besides not having outside space) that you shouldn't be planting herbs and using them in your cooking regularly. Buying herbs for $2 per 3 sprigs is an insane over price for what herbs take to grow. All it took for me to start mine was maybe $30 and it improved the flavor of my food SO MUCH. Easily the best bang for your buck to improve your food quality. The costs are pots (a couple dollars each for plastic), a bag of soil ($5-$10), the plants ($3 each or $1 for a small pouch of seeds), water. That's it.

I don't mind meatballs in general; they're alright, but I could take them or leave them. However, [the meatballs that my nonno makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiAI66WE-EY)... oh my goodness... game changers!  What was once just plain ol' Spaghetti and Meatballs is now a dish to drool over that you just can't get enough of.\n\nMariano's Meatball Recipe:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 lb of Ground Beef\n* 0.5 lb of Italian Sausage Meat (or Ground Pork)\n* 2 Eggs\n* 2-3 Garlic cloves\n* handful of Parsley\n* 1/2 an Onion\n* Olive oil\n* Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs (or regular and add italian seasoning)\n* pinch of Salt & Black Pepper\n* pinch of Hot Chili Flakes (optional)\n\n**Directions (super easy):**\n\n* Get a LARGE mixing bowl and  add in your Ground Beef and Ground Pork (if you're adding Italian Sausages instead of Ground Pork, you can give them a little chop-chop in a food processor to make them easier to mix later).\n   * Wash your hands & clean cookware used to get the raw meat into the mixing bowl.\n* If you have a food processor: add 2-3 Garlic cloves, a handful of Parsely, half an Onion, a *glug* of Olive Oil to help mix.  Finely chop it with the processor and then add it to your mixing bowl.\n   * If you don't have a food processor: just finely chop each of the above ingredients by hand and add them one at a time to your big mixing bowl.\n* Crack two Eggs into that bad boy and season with some Salt & Black Pepper (optionally you can add some hot chili flakes if you like a bit of heat).\n   * If you opted to go with italian sausage vs ground pork, be careful with how much salt you add, because the italian sausages will already have salt in them.  You can always add more salt later, so play it safe!\n* At this point you're going to want to add about 1.5 cups of  breadcrumbs to your mixing bowl and then mix it by hand until it's all nicely evenly mixed.\n* Now roll meatballs in your hand to whatever is your desired meatball size and place them into a pan to cook.\n   * Once again wash your hands real good and clean up your cookware/cooking surfaces.\n* At this point add another *glug* of olive oil to the pan and fry them over medium heat.  Move them around from time to time to try and brown them on all sides.\n   * Meanwhile, get another pan or pot of tomato sauce simmering.\n* Add the meatballs to the pan/pot of your favorite Tomato Sauce and let them cook in there for another \\~15 minutes until they are cooked all the way through.\n* AYOUGO!

{"title": "Every week I cook a Middle Eastern recipe, this week (17/52) I made Maamoul; Ancient Middle Eastern semolina cookies stuffed with Nuts and Dates that are eaten during Religious festivities", "selftext": "In households across the Middle East, millions of Maamoul (also called Kaak) are being baked in Preparation of Eid this coming Friday. Maamoul are semolina cookies (or biscuits if you aren't American) that are stuffed with spiced nut or date fillings. Over the centuries they have become associated with religious holidays and are served by Muslims, Christians and Jews alike during their religious festivities. These cookies are quite similar to the Egyptian Kahk ones I posted about last Eid and it is thought that Maamoul evolved from Kahk, thus giving them a shared pharaonic origin.\n\n## What is Maamoul\n\nTo put it simply [Maamoul are semolina cookies](https://imgur.com/a/1n7bOQT), they are stuffed with nuts (usually pistachios or walnuts, but sometimes almonds as well) or fruit (most commonly date but sometimes figs). The cookies are spiced with Mahlab, which is made from the ground seeds of cherries as well as Orange Blossom or Rose water. Mahlab gives the cookies a slight cherry and almond flavor that is really pleasant. \n\nThe cookies are formed in Maamoul moulds which are traditionally [wooden etched moulds](https://imgur.com/GucSXmI), that give them a [distinct pattern and shape](https://imgur.com/MOSkOAp). Most families have a number of moulds that they use every year, but there are also specially designed tweezers which are used to etch the surface of the cookies. Some designs have specific meanings, for example some Christian populations make a Spiked Ring shape Maamoul which is supposed to represent Jesus' Crown of thorns and is served during Easter. It's standard practice to use a different mould or etching for each flavor so that you always know what each cookie contains. Like I mentioned above these cookies are eaten by Muslims during Eid (both eids), Christians during Easter and Christmas, and Jews during Hanukkah and Purim.\n\nThe cookies themselves have no sugar in the dough, instead the filling is usually sweetened lightly, and then the cookies are dusted with a light dusting of powdered sugar; this is another trait they share with Egyptian Kahk. Maamoul are served alongside Tea or Turkish coffee as the cookies on their own can have a bit of a crumbly texture. There are actually a few commercial brands who mass produce Maamoul, these are good but they cheat a little by using flour rather than semolina.\n\n## History\n\nLike I mentioned above, Maamoul are thought to have evolved from Egyptian Kahk, which themselves are thought to have been a Pharaonic food. Some Pharaonic temples contain etchings that depict the preparation of Kahk, which were given to priests as an offering during certain rituals. It is thought that over 100 different designs existed during the Pharaonic period, in particular round disc shaped designs which carried a depiction of the sun god Ra. \n\nDuring the Fatamid caliphate's (909-1171) rule of the Middle East a government office was setup, whose purpose was to ensure the baking and distribution of Kahk or Maamoul to the general populace during Eid Festivities. The Fatamid's used these as a means of winning over their newly conquered subjects and reminding them of the generosity of their rulers, even going so far as to inscribe them with the words \"Kol wa Eshkor Mawlak\" \"Eat and Thank your master\". As a result of this government office, the cookies are thought to have spread across the Middle East and become a staple during religious festivities.\n\nIt's not clear when the shift from flour to semolina was made, but the clear distinction between Kahk and Maamoul is that Maamoul are made with semolina. Some families use a combination of both, but the distinction is still there as Egyptian Kahk is never made with any semolina. Although they are quite similar in shape and composition, the two cookies are regarded as distinct foods in the Middle East. \n\n## Flavor Profile\n\nUnlike Kahk, Maamoul has a flavored dough. When the dough is being assembled, it is hydrated using Orange Blossom Water or Rose water as opposed to milk in Egyptian Kahk. Orange blossom water has a very slight citrus flavor and almost tastes like jasmine flowers, rose water on the other hand has an extremely strong rose flavor that tastes and smells like a grandma. I have an aversion to rose flavor and so I never use it myself, however when I have had Maamoul with rose, it's always a very slight background flavor and so it must be heavily diluted before use.\n\nThe other major flavor component is Mahlab and it's a spice that is placed in both the dough and the fillings. Mahlab is a spice made from the seeds of cherries. It has a slight cherry flavour, but also tastes likes almonds and a bit floral. It's really subtle in flavor but really elevates these cookies.\n\nThe stuffings of the Maamoul also lend a lot to the flavor of the cookies. The nut stuffings are usually spiced with a combination of Cinnamon, Cardamom, Nutmeg, and Clove. The fruit stuffings are usually seasoned lightly with some cinnamon or nutmeg. It's also common for some families to mix some more rose or orange blossom water into the stuffings as well.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### Dough Ingredients:\n500g (17.5 oz) fine semolina  \n250g (8.75 oz) clarified butter/ghee or about 300-350g (10.5-12.25oz)  butter to make this  \n150ml (5 fl oz) orange blossom water  \n1 Tbsp Mahlab powder  \nPinch of salt  \n\n### Syrup (for the fillings):\n100g (3.5 oz) Sugar  \n50g (1.75 oz) Water   \nSqueeze of lemon juice  \n\n### For the Walnut filling:\n150g (5.25 oz) Walnuts  \n1 Tbsp caster sugar  \n1 Tbsp light brown sugar  \n3 Tbsp Syrup or you can use honey  \nSplash rose water/orange blossom (optional)  \n1/2 Tsp Cinnamon powder  \n1/2 Tsp Mahlab powder  \n1/8 Tsp Cloves powder  \n1/8 Tsp Mace or Nutmeg powder  \n1/8 Tsp Cardamom powder  \n\n### For the Pistachio Filling:\n150g (5.25 oz) pistachios  \n3 Tbsp sugar  \n3 Tbsp honey/thick syrup  \nSplash rose water/orange blossom (optional)  \n\n### For the Date Filling\n200g (7 oz) Date Paste or Pitted Dates  \n20g (0.7 oz) Clarified Butter  \n\n## Directions:\n\n### To make the clarified butter\n1. Melt butter in a pot on medium heat\n2. Once butter has fully melted, let it boil for a couple of minutes before removing from heat\n3. Skim off any foam that has floated to the surface then pour out into a jug to cool. As it cools the milk solids should settle to the bottom of the jug\n4. Carefully measure out 250g of the clarified butter, being sure not to tilt the jug too much so you don't disturb the milk solids\n\n### For the dough\nThis can fully be made by hand\n1. Add Mahlab and semolina to a mixing bowl and mix briefly to combine\n2. Add the cooled but still liquid clarified butter to the semolina and mix to combine\n3. Once combined, grab handfuls of semolina in your hands and rub between your palms (as if you were rubbing sand) to massage the clarified butter into the semolina\n4. After 5 minutes of massaging the semolina it should have a uniformly yellow color. Cover with some plastic wrap and leave to rest overnight\n5. The next day it will have hardened a little, rework the mixture until it starts to come together almost like a dough (should take a few minutes)\n6. Once a soft buttery dough has formed, add the orange blossom and salt then knead until fully absorbed, it forms a soft dough after about 5 mins\n7. Cover and let it rest for  about 30 minutes before using\n\n### To make the syrup\n1. Add sugar, water and lemon juice to a pot on medium heat\n2. Swirl the pot a couple of times to dissolve the sugar and let it come to a boil\n3. Once the sugar has dissolved turn the heat down to low and simmer for 5 minutes until thickened\n\n### For the walnut filling\n1. Toast your walnuts in a dry pan or in the oven until slightly fragrant\n2. Chop the walnuts into small chunks about the size of a grain of rice or two. You can use a knife but pulsing it in the food processor is a lot quicker\n3. Add the walnuts to a bowl as well as the sugar and spices, mix thoroughly to combine\n4. Add the cooled syrup and mix until it starts to clump together and you can form small clusters of nuts using your hands. Add more syrup if necessary\n\n### For the Pistachio Filling\n1. Toast your pistachios in a dry pan or in the oven until fragrant\n2. Chop the pistachios into small chunks about the size of a grain of rice or two. You can use a knife but pulsing it in the food processor is a lot quicker\n3. Add the remaining ingredients and mix until it starts to clump together. Add more syrup if necessary\n\n### For the Date filling\n1. Add the ingredients to a mixing bowl and massage by hand until combined\n2. If you are using pitted dates instead, then it's easier to do this in a small pot on a low heat\n\n### To assemble the cookies:\n1. Portion the dough out into 20g balls and roll each ball in your hands till smooth\n2. To fill the Maamoul, make an indentation in your dough ball and add a teaspoon of filling into it\n3. Use your fingers to press the dough around the filling and seal into a ball once more\n4. Roll in your hands until smooth again\n5. Place the dough ball into a Maamoul mould and press down to imprint\n6. Smack your Maamoul mould onto a surface at an angle to get the formed Maamoul to drop out\n(Alternatively to a mould you could use the sides of a fork or any other kitchen utensils to etch a pattern into your maamoul)\n\n### To cook:\n1. Evenly space out your cookies on a grease proof paper lined tray, they don't spread much at all so you can fit quite a few in at once\n2. Bake in an oven preheated to 200c or 392f for 12 minutes total, rotating it fully at the 6 minute mark\n3. Remove and let them cool on the tray for 15-30 minutes before dusting with powdered sugar\n4. Serve and enjoy\n\n## Notes and Tips:\n* The flavor of Maamoul develops a lot after baking, I highly recommend letting them sit for at least 48 hours before eating as it will allow the fat to resettle in the cookie and the flavors to come together properly\n* If you don't have a [Maamoul mould](https://imgur.com/GucSXmI), try using forks or the underside of some crockery to shape your cookies. You could use a small gravy boat to shape your cookies into oblong shapes\n* Fine semolina should be used as opposed to coarse semolina, some people use a mix of both but coarse semolina alone would result in a really dry and crumbly cookie\n\nAs always I have a full video recipe in my post history if you would like to check it out, I always appreciate the support.

{"title": "Y'all, go make some pickled onions", "selftext": "Because holy shit I was missing out. I'm never going without a jar of pickled onions in my fridge again.\n\nIt gives an intense sweet and sour kick that will enhance literally any dishes. I have tried it with fried rice, grilled chicken burrito, chicken teriyaki,etc, all great. My favorite dish to pair with it, though, is beef stew. Slow cooked meat is delicious but can be pretty dull. I made some beef stew yesterday, poured it over some rice and top with pickled onions. I took a bite of beef, gravy, rice and pickled onions and had to take a moment because of the intense flavor blast. Literally the best thing I've ever made. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe best part? It takes around 7 minutes from start to finish. If you can chop up some onions and boil water and vinegar, you can make picked onions. Here's how:\n\nIngredients:\n\n1. 1 large onion. Red  > Yellow > Sweet in order of intensity. Try your best to cut them evenly and thinly but don't worry about it too much. The pieces will all get pickled with time.\n2. 1 cup of water + 1 cup of vinegar. White/Rice vinegar gives a milder, softer taste. Red wine vinegar is a lot more intense which I like, and the color is awesome.\n3. Salt and sugar. I don't measure mine. I think 3 tablespoons of sugar + 1.5 tablespoon of salt works for me. Adjust to your liking.\n4. Spice and aromatics of choice.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Chop onions in long thin slices. Put in jar.\n2. Water, vinegar, salt, sugar in a pot. Bring to a boil\n3. Pour the liquid into the jar.\n4. Let chill at room temp for 1-2 hours.\n5. Transfer to the fridge.\n\nThese last a long time. I don't know the exact shelf life and neither would you, probably, because you'll finish the whole jar well before that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/owxqxl/yall_go_make_some_pickled_onions/", "created_utc": 1627972781.0, "score": 1925, "author": "None", "num_comments": 271, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/owxqxl/yall_go_make_some_pickled_onions/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

It's almost like I saut\u00e9ed it.\n\nI know this preparation suggestion is pretty well known already, but if you've never tried it and you're a kale hater, I would definitely recommend giving it a go.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/np6x2y/massaging_kale_has_completely_changed_how_i_feel/", "created_utc": 1622477343.0, "score": 1906, "author": "Linked1nPark", "num_comments": 195, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/np6x2y/massaging_kale_has_completely_changed_how_i_feel/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

It's sad influencers , the internet , and tv chefs pretend it's only good for garnishes and salads. \n\nCurley Parsley is not mild! It's mild by itself, but paired with almost anything it has a very strong flavor. Curley Parsley makes almost anything taste way herbier or fresher. \n\nEven though it has a strong flavor it rarely overwhelms other flavors. CP has a magic property of balancing with a lot of other flavors instantly. \n\nCP is best as a main flavor not as a background flavor! \n\nC P is one of my the very few ingreidents if not the only one where it's flavor and smell are almost matching! \n\nCurley Parsley is one of if not the only ingredient that can easily save a too salty dish. The whole if you're dish is too salty your dish can't be saved is countered by curley parsley. \n\nIt doesn't need to be cut. I would go as far as to say it is very rare curley p ever needs to be cut. Just pull at it with your hands. In most cases cutting c parsley will make the c parsley flavor more muted than if you just pulled at it. You almost always want curley parsley to be in chunks in your dish. Not diced up! \n\nCurley   Parsley has a flavor that your mouth does not get bored off. It's one of the few ingredients where if you take 20 bites the 20th bite will taste almost like the 1st bite. So if you struggle with making your dish taste great with every bite try to incorporate curley parsley into your dish. \n\nCurley parsley is one of if not the only ingredient that can flavor soup in just minutes while being boiled without completely destroying it's flavor. \n\nIf you don't believe me put out out a decent amount of parsley into 2.5 cups of boiling water with a teaspoon of salt. Your water will have a parsley flavor within minutes. \n\nCurley Parsley can stay in the fridge for a long time without losing it's flavor. \n\nCurley parsley  is cheap and can be found everytime of the year in most places. \n\nRant over.

I know I could go for the Typhur with 2 probes also, but I'd like 4. While browsing, I found the ThermoMaven P4 (Amazon link below) that is just over half the price of the Typhur while having very similar features.

On Amazon, most of the reviews are positive, but I find it suspicious that they mostly are too positive. I did find a few reviews on YouTube, but they are from unknown channels and generally pretty short.

{"title": "Watermelon misconceptions", "selftext": "Hi all large family-owned USA watermelon farmer, harvester, packer, and shipper. Our farms are located up and down the East Coast and Midwest with a winter crop in Guatemala. I saw a post last week on how to pick a good watermelon and saw a lot of false or just misunderstood info regarding it. I though I would list a few facts to help you pick the best ones in the store. We ship to most major chain stores through the East Coast, Midwest with a few ending up on the West Coast\n\n*  Yellow/tan patch on the bottom - This is mostly true. That is a contact spot where the watermelon rests on the soil. Different varieties have different color patches. Some can be a golden color while others can be more tan or white. Size of the patch does not matter\n* A watermelon should feel heavy for it's size - This is correct but doesn't always mean sweetness. Contrary to what you might think watermelons don't like extremely wet growing environments or lots of rain. Watermelons grow the best in dry hot climates. A light watermelon might mean a watermelon has hollow heart (when you cut a watermelon open and the inside has separated). So you do always want it to fill heavy to ensure solid fruit. Also think of a watermelon like a sponge. The more rain/watering you do the more water is absorbed and the less sweet the watermelon will be. Usually in very dry growing seasons the watermelons are much sweeter. Again you can have a very heavy cardboard tasting watermelon. It's all about the correct amount of water\n* Slapping/thumping - This is 100% correct. You want it to sound like it's \"full\". Almost has a reverberation type sound. A flat sound like slapping the floor with your hand means it's bruised inside or has hollow heart. You do this with an open hand. This is also how we grade out bad ones while packing\n* Darker watermelons aren't as sweet - completely false. Watermelon varieties have different colors and rind patterns. That has nothing to do with sweetness\n* Seedless watermelons are GMO - completely false. There is no such thing as a GMO watermelon. Seedless is created with cross breeding different varieties. Similar to getting different breeds of mixed dogs or cats\n* Farmer's Markets - just wanted to add this. Some watermelons at farmer's markets throughout the country truly are grown by the hard working people you see managing the stands. However, most aren't. Most watermelons sold at farmer's markets are grade outs from farms like ours. We can't ship them to your local grocery store due to external/internal blemishes. Most chain stores have strict requirements on shipments and are inspected at every delivery before being received. They reject if we don't meet those requirements. This could be scarring, insect damage, bruising, hollow heart, sun burn, low sugar content ect... Most of these go to local cows who greatly enjoy eating them. Others are picked up and bought from us at a discount. They are then taken to farmer's markets and sold in bulk where they are then sold to the consumer. Ugly watermelons don't mean home grown most of the time. They mean we couldn't ship them to our customers\n* Shape (round, short, thin, fat) affects quality - it doesn't. Has nothing to do with anything quality related. Some farmers just like different varieties. Some are more shaped like a ball. Some or more shaped like a football. This hasn't nothing to do with quality. Ripples on the the rind/triangle shaped watermelons however can mean hollow heart but not always. You can always use the thump test to confirm. Watermelons can also be oddly shaped due to wind damage during growing. This also doesn't affect quality most of the time but we grade them out because no one will buy them\n* Shiny watermelon means wax is added for appearance - Completely false. Some varieties are shiner than others. It's that simple\n* Webbing, scarring, ugly marks = good watermelon - completely false. This has nothing to do with internal quality. Webbing in watermelon is caused by wind scars. When watermelons are young and the wind is blowing, dirt and the plant itself will hit the watermelon. As it grows it will show rind scars and webbing where that occurred. Some scarring is caused by insects which eats the external rind. Cucumber beetles would we one such pest. External scars and webbing have nothing to do with internal quality. It only affects outside appearance \n* Hollow heart watermelons are overripe - completely false. This is caused by stress during growing. Could be poor weather, poor pollination, too much fertilizer ect. They are perfectly safe to eat and I feel sometimes they are sweeter than others as the sugar around the heart is more concentrated due to the hollow middle\n* Rind stripes can show ripeness - this is true. You are almost looking for a white \"break\" on the rind stripe. It almost looks like a digital pattern. This will show that is ripe and ready for harvest. We also check in the fields by looking for dead tendrils on the vine. You can do this at home as well if you grow them yourself. Darker varieties make the rind patterns more difficult to see so we use many different ways to tell if a watermelon is ripe for harvest\n* Watermelons will continue to ripen off the vine - This is true (edit but they aren\u2019t technically ripening). And if you leave it outside for a day or so it will increase sugar concentration as extra water inside will escape. Just don't leave it in the hot sun or you will have problems. They don't like direct sunlight once they are harvested\nEdit - the perceived ripening is actually just increasing sugar concentration. As the water permeates through the rind, the sugar concentration inside the cells becomes higher\n* Elongated watermelons are watery - completely false. Again shape has little if not anything to do with taste\n* Seeded watermelons have better nutrition - completely false. We grow both seeded and seedless. Both have same nutritional content.\n\n Hope this helps some of you in your watermelon purchasing. I would be happy to answer any questions. Not doing this to benefit our company, but I would like everyone to buy more watermelons!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kcftt8/watermelon_misconceptions/", "created_utc": 1746123882.0, "score": 5495, "author": "tmills3131", "num_comments": 335, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kcftt8/watermelon_misconceptions/", "html_title": ""}

What parts of the chicken are bad for the broth and should not be added?  \n\n2. Is there an ideal temperature for simmering to ensure the best flavor, and does it vary depending on the stage of the process?  \n\n3. Does the amount of water I use at any stage matter if my end goal is to reduce the broth to a demi-glace?  \n\n4. How long can I push the \"extraction\" of flavors by adding more water? Is there a point where all flavor is extracted from the ingredients, or does it start to turn bitter or bad?  \n\n5. This one is more a matter of opinion, but are there better results if the chicken is cooked or raw? If cooked, what is your favorite cooking method for the best flavor?  \n\n6. This is a bit of a silly question, but would it be different or pointless to make broth from a mixture of cooked and uncooked ingredients?  \n\n7. Is it bad to add charred ingredients, and if not, how much char is too much for a broth?  \n\nThat's all I can muster from my brain right now, but I'll try to come up with more questions in the future.\n\nIf you have any additional information on this topic, PLEASE, please, please tell me because I would be forever grateful.\n\nI posted this in r/kitchenconfidential and havent gotten any responses and I am desperate for this knowledge so hope it gets more interactions over here!\n\nThanks for entertaining my questions!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kdhzck/what_can_i_do_to_make_a_broth_as_good_as_it_can_be/", "created_utc": 1746237666.0, "score": 6, "author": "SimplePhilosopher488", "num_comments": 21, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kdhzck/what_can_i_do_to_make_a_broth_as_good_as_it_can_be/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Now this year I decided to do R&D in the off season and bring the final recipe to Thanksgiving this year. Here is the most recent beta.

Keep sweating till it looks and smells good. I did another 3 mins.\n \n5) Add chicken stock and milk to make sauce. Bring to a boil. Pepper to taste.\n\n6) Add frozen green beans.

It then became a passion of mine where I began making multicultural cuisines from all over the world as a project and also it gave me something to be interested in to learn about the culture, traditions, origins behind these cuisines. \n\nI made dishes such as Russian Borscht. Korean Jhapae, English Breakfast, French Onion Soup, Swedish Meatballs, Chinese Chicken Chow Mein, Swedish Meatballs, etc. \n\nFor the record, I grew up and was raised in Canada and my family immigrated here and ran a Chinese Takeout businiess \ud83e\udd61 so growing up, I never actually took advantage to help out nor did I ever cared about cooking/food since it was never my interest until now.

If so how long can it be in there to ensure it gets really cold?   \nI used half raw sugar and half white granulated because that's what I would see chefs do when I worked at restaurants, but they also had much bigger, stronger torches. is that part of the problem as well?\n\nOther than that everything turned out okay, texture was good but a bit liquidy, which I figured was the long torching, and the top was a little too brown. So I was thinking maybe lower the rack of the oven and bake it for a couple of minutes?\n\nsorry for the long post, please, anyone, let me know!

{"title": "A Simple Way to Make Good Tomato Sauce with Bad Tomatoes", "selftext": "  \nGuys, I wanted to share with you a simple recipe that we use to make an above-average tomato sauce with run of the mill, grocery bought tomatoes in the middle of winter. If you have the means of course you can make canned tomatoes in the summer and store them in the fridge but we\u2019re not at that point in our lives so this is something we do and if you\u2019d like you can give it a try.\u00a0\n\n  \nFirst we roast the tomatoes. Leave the skin on, a little bit of olive oil but do not salt it yet. Roast it high and until the skin blackens a little bit. Remove the green stem as this will make it easier to peel off the skin later on. Roast them for about 20 minutes in a 450 oven. Or you can air fry if that\u2019s more convenient.\u00a0\n\n  \nThen, after you peel off the skin you smash it with a potato smasher, fork, or any other tool that you have. Do not use a blender as it will water the tomatoes as if they are not already pretty watery.\u00a0\n\n  \nIn a pot put a little bit of olive oil, a clove of garlic and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes. Remove the garlic, lower the temperature to medium low and add the tomatoes. Caution: be careful when adding the tomatoes since the olive oil will be hot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd half a teaspoon of sugar, and half a teaspoon of salt per 2 lbs of raw tomatoes. Lower the heat and simmer for half an hour to 45 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdjust salt to your liking, finish with a little bit of sherry vinegar. If not available any other vinegar will work except for distilled white vinegar. That leaves an aftertaste to the tomatoes that is not desirable.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. This even works with store bought canned tomatoes. Roasting them is a little tricky but we spread them to a baking sheet and roast them high for about 10-15 minutes.\u00a0\n\n  \nIf you have any other tricks to make good tomato sauce with less than ideal tomatoes please share it.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kazqfx/a_simple_way_to_make_good_tomato_sauce_with_bad/", "created_utc": 1745962663.0, "score": 21, "author": "sirberaferguson", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kazqfx/a_simple_way_to_make_good_tomato_sauce_with_bad/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Roasted tomatoes: juices evaporate & burn", "selftext": "I've made this [roasted tomatoes and cipollini](https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/09/roasted-tomatoes-and-cipollini/) recipe twice, once with cherry tomatoes and again with small tomatoes. The recipe describes luscious pan juices to be used when serving. However, each time I made it, the juices evaporated and burned in the pan. Should I be watching this like a hawk and add a bit of water when the juices start to disappear? Wouldn't that interfere with roasting on the base of the vegetables? Isn't that contrary to the \"flip the veggies every 15 minutes\" hands-off approach?\n\nHere's the recipe: \n\nRoasted Tomatoes and Cipollini\n\nServes four as a small dish, two as a main\n\n1 pound cipollini onions\n1 pound small Roma or large cherry tomatoes\n1/4 cup olive oil\nCoarse salt\n4 slices of country or ciabatta bread, one-inch thick\n1 15-ounce can of white beans, drained and rinsed or 1 1/2 cups cooked beans of your choice\nGarlic clove (optional)\nFew fresh basil leaves, slivered\n\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Boil a small pot of water and blanche the cipollini for 10 seconds, then plunging them into cold water. Use a paring knife to make a small slit in each, and slide them out of their skins and outer layer.\n\nSpread peeled onions and tomatoes in a roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil and a few good pinches of coarse salt. Toss everything together until well-coated and roast in preheated oven for about 45 minutes, reaching in every 15 minutes with a spatula to roll the tomatoes and onions around to ensure all sides get blistered.\n\nJust before you take the tomatoes and onions out, place your bread slices on the oven rack (or a tray, if you\u2019re more refined than us) and let them toast lightly. You can rub the toasts with a halved garlic clove, if you like, while still hot. Use tongs to arrange toasts in one layer on a serving platter. Dump the white beans over the bread, and using a pot holder, scrape the entire contents of the tomato-and-onion roasting pan, still hot, over the white beans. Do not skimp on the juices that have collected, all of them \u2014 don\u2019t leave any in the pan.

But I watch a lot of cooking shows.  Recently, I especially enjoy watching the UK version of *MasterChef* (can't bear the US or Australian versions), and *MasterChef:  The Professionals* (also UK).\n\nOne thing I notice with these two shows in particular is the frequent use of offal - very much in line, of course, not only with French and some Italian traditions, but also the newer \"trendy\" \"snout to tail\" \"movement\" among chefs/restaurants.  And I've always been curious - how does this stuff actually *taste*?\n\nMy experience with offal (or, offal-adjacent) animal products has been limited.  I have had liver a few times - a couple of times (in decent restaurants) tasty enough, but most times off-putting (strong-tasting, grainy/mealy texture; really unpleasant, as I've always found any type of liver pate).  I've also had tripe twice, cooked different ways.  I found it disgusting.  Kidneys - couldn't get past the first bite.\n\nI don't think I have to skill to cook offal correctly, and TBH I have no idea where I'd even *find* most of it where I live.

Or should I just go with a glass airfryer considering the things I\u2019m being picky about? \n\nI\u2019m willing to pay a little more for an appliance that would do more but I would prefer if I could run the trays and whatnot within the appliance through the dishwasher but that\u2019s not necessarily a requirement as I could just lay some foil down and would have to clean it as often. I also wouldn\u2019t buy one if it has pfas in the trays. There are just so many options out there I am feeling a little overwhelmed so I was thinking I\u2019d ask here if anyone is loving their appliance :) thank you! \n\n*edited to add more paragraph breaks as requested ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kbb4k6/should_i_buy_a_glass_airfryer_or_just_go_for_one/", "created_utc": 1746000117.0, "score": 0, "author": "kenalkn", "num_comments": 14, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kbb4k6/should_i_buy_a_glass_airfryer_or_just_go_for_one/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Can I use a buttermilk marinade twice?", "selftext": "I marinated some chicken breasts in a buttermilk mix yesterday and they were probably the best ones I've made so far!

I plan on making a chicken rice dish within the next day or two though, and I was wondering if I could at least use it to marinate some chicken one more time? That was the first time I've used buttermilk so I don't know a whole lot about cooking with it. Will my chicken turn out weird if I marinate them and then throw them in a skillet? And would it be ok to reuse the marinade, since I'm cooking the chicken anyways? \n\nThe marinade was not out for very long, maybe 15-20 minutes. Was that still too long? I actually used less buttermilk than the recipe told me to, because it seemed like a heck of a lot and I wasn't using much chicken (it called for 32 oz, I used maybe 16).\n\nI'm sorry if this is a stupid question, I've just started getting comfortable with cooking with raw chicken but I also get so guilty over food waste and I didn't realize how much buttermilk would be left over. \n\nEdit: after looking at all the comments, I'm just going to toss it out.

Unfortunately, the pork itself was a stringy, overly chewy, ultimately kind of gross mess, although the onions were fine.\n\nNow I'm currently eating chicken tenders from a local bar, feeling moderately dejected that I've managed to botch dinner so badly.

This would result in my plates not fitting unless the rack lets the plate kind of sink into the top part quite a bit.  \n  \nToday I use a plastic one that I bought from Ikea and it's not ideal, flimsy and getting old.  \nI spent 2 hours on amazon but couldn't find any that was bigger than this normal size mentioned above.\n\nAppreciate any help out there!  \nI am located in Sweden so I appreciate suggestions that are not specific to a country outside Sweden.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1k9w7lb/help_me_find_a_dish_rack_big_enough/", "created_utc": 1745848725.0, "score": 1, "author": "4n6Alice", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1k9w7lb/help_me_find_a_dish_rack_big_enough/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Well I bought an egg cooker which saves me a lot of easy time. I like the rfuzzy logic it has. turns off as soon as water isnt detected. \n\nI heavily cook Asian style dishes, and have been thinking a stand alone rice cooker would be much easier to deal with and I can store my instant pot away.\n\nWhat do you guys think about the above listed brands for rice cookers? The last two I know are pricier but I do like that fuzzy logic, and options for different types of rice. I do make sushi from time to time, but hate doing it in pot on the stove.  I eat enough rice with meals that I can justify spending like $60-80 on a good rice cooker, But how much of a difference is there between them all. I do also like the thought of cooking all in one pot too.

{"title": "Different recipe management and import apps, which one is best for you?", "selftext": "After trying a ton of cooking recipe apps, I\u2019ve narrowed down the ones that really stood out to me. These apps do a fantastic job at recipe importing, meal planning, and helping organize everything in a way that\u2019s intuitive and user-friendly. Whether you're looking for something free or willing to pay for extra features, here\u2019s my list of the best cooking apps to compare:\n\n1. **Cooklang (Free)**\u00a0Cooklang is a fantastic option if you like to keep things simple and organized with a text-based system. It's designed to store recipes in a clean, easy-to-read format, which can be helpful for meal planning without needing to mess around with complicated apps. You can easily track ingredients and keep everything in one place without feeling overwhelmed\n2. **Paprika (Paid)**\u00a0Paprika has been a go-to for many home cooks for years. It\u2019s great for organizing recipes, creating shopping lists, and planning meals. The recipe import feature works well, and while it\u2019s not free, it\u2019s worth the investment for its solid, reliable features and user interface\n3. **Deglaze (Free)**\u00a0This app is a great free option for people who need simplicity and ease. It does an excellent job at importing recipes and organizing them without overwhelming you with unnecessary features. The clean interface makes meal planning and shopping a breeze, making it a great option if you don\u2019t want to pay for an app\n4. **Spillt (Free)**\u00a0Spillt is fantastic if you're looking for a free app with a focus on using what you already have. It helps you cook from your pantry, suggesting recipes based on what\u2019s in your fridge. It\u2019s a perfect option for reducing food waste, and the recipe suggestions are actually really solid\n5. **ReciMe (Paid)**\u00a0ReciMe is great if you want something that combines organization with meal tracking. It lets you save recipes, plan meals, and even automatically generate shopping lists. The paid version offers additional features like nutrition tracking, which makes it ideal for anyone who wants to stick to a specific diet or meal plan\n6. **Yummly (Free, with premium option)**\u00a0Yummly is another widely-used app that\u2019s great for finding new recipes based on your taste preferences, dietary needs, and even ingredients you already have. It\u2019s free to use, but you can upgrade to the premium version for extra features like advanced filtering and grocery delivery integrations.\n7. **BigOven (Free, with premium option)**\u00a0BigOven is a solid app that allows you to save recipes, create meal plans, and generate grocery lists. It\u2019s a popular choice due to its huge database of recipes and ease of use. The free version gives you plenty of options, but if you want to unlock more advanced features, the premium version is worth checking out.\n8. **CookPal AI (Paid)** This is an APP that can import recipes from anywhere, just like recime. What I like most about it is its voice-assisted cooking function, which is very friendly for novices or those who are not very familiar with the dishes. It can tell me how to do it step by step and can deal with various abnormal situations during the cooking process.\n\nThese apps each bring something unique to the table, whether it\u2019s ease of use, recipe organization, or meal planning tools.

{"title": "A trial of patience and spite (beginner makes pork pies)", "selftext": "This is a pseudo-follow up to my post yesterday about my darling, darling wife and her journey into cooking.\n\nYesterday evening, she started making pork pies. This came after only a month or so of cooking, and was... frustrating to say the least. A few commenters scolded me for pushing her too hard, which she got a giggle at (for you see, it is I who is being tugged along in this escipade, and I have actually tried to pull her back to the basics many times). \n\nHer knife was dull, which made cubing the pork a nightmare. Her pie crust set incorrectly because the recipe was vague and annoying. The book told her itd take an hour and a half, but didnt account for prep work (ingredients listed called for everything to be pre-chopped), and she was in the kitchen for over 6hrs trying to make it work.\n\nI sat and watched the whole ordeal, and made myself busy by posting here to chat with others about her progress, and get some tips. She ended up giving up at around 3 in the morning, when her crust was clearly crumbled beyond repair. We had a small cry to let out some frustrations, talked it through, and made pasta instead.\n\nToday, however, she woke up with an unmatched vengeance. This woman is an unstoppable force. I, and many others in the comments, believed these pies to be far outside her skill set (and they are!) but today we marched our way over to the mall, dropped the bucks on a brand-new chefs knife, and griped about these damn pies.\n\nThe filling from last night was kept, but the crust was recreated tonight, as well as the quails eggs. Here, against all odds, are the pork pies that took 24 whole hours to create. They are misshapen lil devils with overcooked pork and uneven egg washes, and they are DELICIOUS.  \n\nIll never try to hold her back again, though she did promise to cool it on the complicated stuff from now on.\n\nThank you to everyone here who steered us in the right direction.

It\u2019s on me, which I don\u2019t mind.)\n\n1- must be gluten-free for my cousin\n\n2- as per my BF, must contain both lobster and pepper Jack (he wants \u201cheat,\u201d but two of my family members don\u2019t like excessive head- the others are ok with heat)\n\n3- must be transportable- I would most likely make this on Wednesday PM and transport Thursday AM of Thanksgiving Day to be enjoyed- it will endure about a 2.5-3hr car ride in total on Thanksgiving AM\n\n4- must be creamy, of course \n\nI feel like I\u2019m really reaching into the void here- I don\u2019t usually cook GF (best pasta brand suggestions for this????) and I\u2019ve NEVER cooked with lobster EVER before (until recently I\u2019ve been an anti-fish/shellfish person, as I\u2019ve just never liked it growing up).\n\n\nMy go-to recipes in the past have been the baked Betty Crocker Mac and cheese (basically with butter/onion, then add flour, then cream/milk, then cheeses, then cooked pasta, then bake with bread crumbs), or that general recipe plus previously cooked pulled pork or bacon. \n\nAny and all advice/tips are welcome!\n\n(I\u2019m not a novice cook, but I do work on teacher salary and a small kitchen lol.)\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1k9efm4/i_need_your_best_lobster_mac_and_cheese_recipes/", "created_utc": 1745787784.0, "score": 0, "author": "brightly_disguised", "num_comments": 13, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1k9efm4/i_need_your_best_lobster_mac_and_cheese_recipes/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

But none of those things were life changing.\n\nThen, I was introduced to Kerrygold. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a lot better than what I grew up eating, but I still didn\u2019t get the hype.\n\nThree months ago, I was shopping in Central Market and they were having a sale on all European butters. I decided to buy Le Gall salted French premium butter on a whim. When I got home, I made a grilled cheese sandwich, and with the first bite I immediately understood why the French mock us. It was undeniably the best grilled cheese sandwich that I\u2019ve ever made. I usually cut off the crust and give it to my dog, but I didn\u2019t that time; he was indignant, I was inspired!\n\nNow? Buttered toast: a revelation! Steamed broccoli: transformed! Pasta with butter: divine! Grits: revolutionary! Mashed potatoes: *chef\u2019s kiss*.\n\nI\u2019m almost out of the Le Gall, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to go back to my old life. Do you all have any favorite brands that you love?

{"title": "WTF happened with my Daddy Mac?", "selftext": "The daugther-favorite recipe I've developed over the decades starts with a b\u00e9chamel of 1/4c unsalted butter, 1/4c flour, 2c milk (these days reconstituted skim, to be precise).  I've experimented with browned or clarified butter, but they don't turn out to suit the overall flavor profile very well.\n\nGet that to a moderate simmer, gradually add 16oz (double the ancestral recipe, that's what makes it **DADDY** Mac) colby jack shredded from block by food processor, whisk till melted.  Combine with 12oz well-rinsed elbows, bake at 350 for 20 minutes, serve.  Never fails (..almost).\n\nUntil today... when I added the first \\~1/2c  cheese to the moderately-simmering bechamel... it congealed on the spot, sucking all of the solids out of the base.  IOW I now had a very thin vigorously-boiling liquid plus a clump of rubber.  Adding bits more cheese only made things worse.  Increasing temp in a (perhaps misguided) attempt to compel melting only had the effect of turning the clump of rubber into a clump of brick.  Higher heat to keep the liquid portion at a strong boil (at this point I was collecting data about what went wrong, it was obviously inedible) for \\~30 minutes, while adding more of the cheese, only had the effect of congealing more until I had effectively no liquid left; by the time 1 1/4c of the cheese had been added I had components of and (a) rubber, (b) glue, nothing left to which I could add more.  That then readily reached 300F (per my InstaPen) with no signs of melting whatsoever.  350F started to produce some charring but no liquefaction, 375 was where I had to stop lest I start setting off smoke alarms.\n\nI think I've got a pretty solid grasp of the thermodynamics of this recipe in practice, and combining the same ingredients from the same stores in the same way consistently produced the same results... until this time iti didn't.\n\nWhat Did I Do Wrong?\n\nP.S. Incidentally the GoodGrips silicone whisk showed its limitations only shortly after 300F, because AFAICT the glue holding the loops to the handle melted long before the goop did the same.

It looked absolutely delicious, so I tried it at a specialty boiling crab restaurant here, and I was instantly hooked \u2013 I knew it was exactly my kind of food.\n\nBecause I loved it so much, I wanted to make it at home. I've looked up various recipes and tried several times, but I keep failing to get that taste right. This has led me to wonder how boiling crab is *actually* made in the US, so I'm writing this post hoping to understand the authentic recipe or method.\n\nHere are the attempts I've made so far, focusing on the sauce:\n\n**First Attempt:**\n\n* Melted 200g of butter, added 5 spoons (tablespoons?) of minced garlic and caramelized it.\n* Added 1 whole onion and saut\u00e9ed it.\n* Added:\n   * 2 spoons Old Bay Seasoning\n   * 1 spoon sugar\n   * 1 spoon lemon pepper\n   * 1 spoon cayenne pepper\n   * 1 spoon paprika\n   * 1 spoon chicken stock (powder/granules?)\n   * Half a spoon Worcestershire sauce\n   * Half a spoon black pepper\n* *Result:* The sauce was extremely salty, harsh/pungent, and simply didn't taste good.\n\n**Second Attempt:**\n\n* Melted 100g of butter, added 2 spoons of minced garlic and caramelized it.\n* Added 1/4 of an onion and saut\u00e9ed it.\n* Added:\n   * 1 spoon Old Bay Seasoning\n   * Half a spoon sugar\n   * Half a spoon Cajun seasoning/sauce (*User note: Original Korean said 'sauce'*)\n* *Result:* It was less salty and harsh, but still didn't taste good.\n\n**Third Attempt:**\n\n* Used:\n   * 100g butter\n   * 2 spoons garlic\n   * 1/4 onion\n   * 1 spoon Old Bay Seasoning\n   * Half a spoon sugar\n   * Half a spoon lemon pepper\n   * Half a spoon cayenne pepper\n   * Half a spoon paprika\n* *Result:* Tasted similar to the first attempt; another failure.\n\n**Fourth Attempt:**\n\n* Used:\n   * 350g butter\n   * 3 spoons minced garlic\n   * 1/4 minced onion\n   * 1 spoon Old Bay Seasoning\n   * Half a spoon lemon pepper\n   * Half a spoon cayenne pepper\n   * Half a spoon black pepper\n   * Half a spoon sugar\n* *Result:* This didn't taste good either.\n\n**Fifth Attempt:**\n\n* Used:\n   * 200g butter\n   * 2 spoons minced garlic\n   * 1/2 minced onion\n   * 2 spoons Old Bay Seasoning\n   * 1 spoon paprika powder\n   * 1 spoon lemon juice\n   * 1 spoon sugar\n   * 1/2 spoon black pepper\n* *Result:* Again, this did not taste like what I had at the restaurant.\n\nI honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong.

{"title": "Why are \"white potatoes\" not more popular in the USA??", "selftext": "As a potato lover, I have tried and tested many of the readily available potatoes types in popular grocery store chains. Russets, Gold, Red, Sweet, and the very tiny section of Whites. Here are my findings:\n\n\nRussets: Good for baking and roasting because of it's high starch content. It has an overall earthy and fluffy flavor, which you can use for mashing, but it's not the best choice compared to other potatoes. It's a good frying potato, which would indicate why it's the most popular in the States.\n\nGolds: Perfect for mashing or using for delicate recipes, such as Au Gratin or Fondant. It has a very creamy texture and slight sweet notes. While you can use it to fry or roast, it's not the best choice because of its lower starch content.\n\nReds: Personally, I've never been a big fan of these, but I understand why people like them. It has a waxy texture, which is good for stews and mashing, but I find they have a muted and earthy flavor. Typically, they're better when paired with other things as opposed to eating on their own.\n\nSweets: I won't get much into these because they're a completely different flavor profile than what I'm comparing, but I've found they have a good texture for mashing and light roasting.\n\nWhites: Now for the culprit type of potato. I've found myself over time reaching for these more in a pinch because they have a balanced starch content, which makes them great for mashing, roasting, or frying. They have a slight creamy texture, like golds, but have enough starch so they fry well too. Personally, I'm not fond of the earthy flavor that russets can have sometimes, but with how much I've cooked potatoes, I'm now a white potato advocate. \n\nMy hot take, white potatoes are THE perfect all-round potato that gives you the satisfaction of a creamy mash or bake and the perfect starch content for roasting or frying.\n\n  \nI'm ready to hear everyone's opinions because I am weirdly passionate about this topic :D\n\n\n\nEdit: Some people are not understanding the whimsical undertone of this post. Maybe I just wanted an excuse to talk about potatoes because I haven't eaten lunch yet.\ud83e\udd23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1k65yqh/why_are_white_potatoes_not_more_popular_in_the_usa/", "created_utc": 1745431556.0, "score": 590, "author": "madhorsey123", "num_comments": 196, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1k65yqh/why_are_white_potatoes_not_more_popular_in_the_usa/", "html_title": ""}

That way, I could potentially get rid of my pop up toaster, toaster oven, and air fryer, or at least take them off the counter/out of the kitchen most of the time. \n\nThe problem is that I haven't really come across much of anyone comparing alternatives.

I'm now looking to buy a wireless meat thermometer that can allow me to see the temperature from afar and get alarms when the desired temperature is reached.\n\nI've read a lot of reviews these days and, while I would like to go for a Typhur Sync with 4 probes, at 300 Euro it's quite expensive. I know I could go for the Typhur with 2 probes also, but I'd like 4. While browsing, I found the ThermoMaven P4 (Amazon link below) that is just over half the price of the Typhur while having very similar features. I found (mostly via Reddit) that the mother company is Typhur, and they might use similar technology. \n\nNevertheles, other than Amazon, I can barely find this product elsewhere. On Amazon, most of the reviews are positive, but I find it suspicious that they mostly are too positive. I did find a few reviews on YouTube, but they are from unknown channels and generally pretty short. The few Reddit mentions are generally overusing the name of the manufacturer, which could be a tactic for having this show up in search results.\n\nTo sum it all up, the product looks good, and I can always return it if I purchase it from Amazon. It does, however, look suspicious (to me, at least) because of the lack of reviews or reviews and comments that might be bots. Am I paranoid? Did anyone else try this product?

Curley p is a vegetable with a fuck load of it's bitterness kicked out and replaced with freshness. \n\nCurley parsley is one of the very very easiest ingredients to use in cooking. It's sad influencers , the internet , and tv chefs pretend it's only good for garnishes and salads. \n\nCurley Parsley is not mild! It's mild by itself, but paired with almost anything it has a very strong flavor. Curley Parsley makes almost anything taste way herbier or fresher. \n\nEven though it has a strong flavor it rarely overwhelms other flavors. CP has a magic property of balancing with a lot of other flavors instantly. \n\nCP is best as a main flavor not as a background flavor! \n\nC P is one of my the very few ingreidents if not the only one where it's flavor and smell are almost matching! \n\nCurley Parsley is one of if not the only ingredient that can easily save a too salty dish. The whole if you're dish is too salty your dish can't be saved is countered by curley parsley. \n\nIt doesn't need to be cut. I would go as far as to say it is very rare curley p ever needs to be cut. Just pull at it with your hands. In most cases cutting c parsley will make the c parsley flavor more muted than if you just pulled at it. You almost always want curley parsley to be in chunks in your dish. Not diced up! \n\nCurley   Parsley has a flavor that your mouth does not get bored off. It's one of the few ingredients where if you take 20 bites the 20th bite will taste almost like the 1st bite. So if you struggle with making your dish taste great with every bite try to incorporate curley parsley into your dish. \n\nCurley parsley is one of if not the only ingredient that can flavor soup in just minutes while being boiled without completely destroying it's flavor. \n\nIf you don't believe me put out out a decent amount of parsley into 2.5 cups of boiling water with a teaspoon of salt. Your water will have a parsley flavor within minutes. \n\nCurley Parsley can stay in the fridge for a long time without losing it's flavor. \n\nCurley parsley  is cheap and can be found everytime of the year in most places. \n\nRant over.

Does the amount of water I use at any stage matter if my end goal is to reduce the broth to a demi-glace?  \n\n4. How long can I push the \"extraction\" of flavors by adding more water? Is there a point where all flavor is extracted from the ingredients, or does it start to turn bitter or bad?  \n\n5. This one is more a matter of opinion, but are there better results if the chicken is cooked or raw? If cooked, what is your favorite cooking method for the best flavor?  \n\n6.

Store bought juice from concentrate is perfectly fine, I use the one from Aldi's or Costco.\n* If you taste a slice you'll notice it's nice and tangy, and not super sour because of all the salt the pepperoni has, now you want to take a couple of slices and put them in a plate over a paper towel, microwave them on the \"warm\" setting, they'll slowly start cooking, they will steam a lot don't worry just keep an eye on them so you don't burn them, experiment how well cooked you want them, they will get crispy quickly; Alternatively you can do this in the oven or air-fryer, heck even in a pan if you want, the point here is to remove the excess oil/fat.\n\nI mainly use pepperoni for pizza or mozzarella sandwiches, these 2 things, lemon curing and microwaving achieve a nice balance of flavour, and fat removal, no more greasy mess when baking your pizza since you removed most of it by pre-cooking the pepperoni.\n\n  \nI know it's not for everyone, but it reminds me a LOT about Salami Pamplona which is quite tangy which I enjoy a lot more but can't find it here in the U.S.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kd0dse/pepperoni_like_the_taste_but_hate_how_salty_and/", "created_utc": 1746190892.0, "score": 0, "author": "EldraziAnnihalator", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kd0dse/pepperoni_like_the_taste_but_hate_how_salty_and/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Watermelon misconceptions", "selftext": "Hi all large family-owned USA watermelon farmer, harvester, packer, and shipper. Our farms are located up and down the East Coast and Midwest with a winter crop in Guatemala. I saw a post last week on how to pick a good watermelon and saw a lot of false or just misunderstood info regarding it. I though I would list a few facts to help you pick the best ones in the store. We ship to most major chain stores through the East Coast, Midwest with a few ending up on the West Coast\n\n*  Yellow/tan patch on the bottom - This is mostly true. That is a contact spot where the watermelon rests on the soil. Different varieties have different color patches. Some can be a golden color while others can be more tan or white. Size of the patch does not matter\n* A watermelon should feel heavy for it's size - This is correct but doesn't always mean sweetness. Contrary to what you might think watermelons don't like extremely wet growing environments or lots of rain. Watermelons grow the best in dry hot climates. A light watermelon might mean a watermelon has hollow heart (when you cut a watermelon open and the inside has separated). So you do always want it to fill heavy to ensure solid fruit. Also think of a watermelon like a sponge. The more rain/watering you do the more water is absorbed and the less sweet the watermelon will be. Usually in very dry growing seasons the watermelons are much sweeter. Again you can have a very heavy cardboard tasting watermelon. It's all about the correct amount of water\n* Slapping/thumping - This is 100% correct. You want it to sound like it's \"full\". Almost has a reverberation type sound. A flat sound like slapping the floor with your hand means it's bruised inside or has hollow heart. You do this with an open hand. This is also how we grade out bad ones while packing\n* Darker watermelons aren't as sweet - completely false. Watermelon varieties have different colors and rind patterns. That has nothing to do with sweetness\n* Seedless watermelons are GMO - completely false. There is no such thing as a GMO watermelon. Seedless is created with cross breeding different varieties. Similar to getting different breeds of mixed dogs or cats\n* Farmer's Markets - just wanted to add this. Some watermelons at farmer's markets throughout the country truly are grown by the hard working people you see managing the stands. However, most aren't. Most watermelons sold at farmer's markets are grade outs from farms like ours. We can't ship them to your local grocery store due to external/internal blemishes. Most chain stores have strict requirements on shipments and are inspected at every delivery before being received. They reject if we don't meet those requirements. This could be scarring, insect damage, bruising, hollow heart, sun burn, low sugar content ect... Most of these go to local cows who greatly enjoy eating them. Others are picked up and bought from us at a discount. They are then taken to farmer's markets and sold in bulk where they are then sold to the consumer. Ugly watermelons don't mean home grown most of the time. They mean we couldn't ship them to our customers\n* Shape (round, short, thin, fat) affects quality - it doesn't. Has nothing to do with anything quality related. Some farmers just like different varieties. Some are more shaped like a ball. Some or more shaped like a football. This hasn't nothing to do with quality. Ripples on the the rind/triangle shaped watermelons however can mean hollow heart but not always. You can always use the thump test to confirm. Watermelons can also be oddly shaped due to wind damage during growing. This also doesn't affect quality most of the time but we grade them out because no one will buy them\n* Shiny watermelon means wax is added for appearance - Completely false. Some varieties are shiner than others. It's that simple\n* Webbing, scarring, ugly marks = good watermelon - completely false. This has nothing to do with internal quality. Webbing in watermelon is caused by wind scars. When watermelons are young and the wind is blowing, dirt and the plant itself will hit the watermelon. As it grows it will show rind scars and webbing where that occurred. Some scarring is caused by insects which eats the external rind. Cucumber beetles would we one such pest. External scars and webbing have nothing to do with internal quality. It only affects outside appearance \n* Hollow heart watermelons are overripe - completely false. This is caused by stress during growing. Could be poor weather, poor pollination, too much fertilizer ect. They are perfectly safe to eat and I feel sometimes they are sweeter than others as the sugar around the heart is more concentrated due to the hollow middle\n* Rind stripes can show ripeness - this is true. You are almost looking for a white \"break\" on the rind stripe. It almost looks like a digital pattern. This will show that is ripe and ready for harvest. We also check in the fields by looking for dead tendrils on the vine. You can do this at home as well if you grow them yourself. Darker varieties make the rind patterns more difficult to see so we use many different ways to tell if a watermelon is ripe for harvest\n* Watermelons will continue to ripen off the vine - This is true (edit but they aren\u2019t technically ripening). And if you leave it outside for a day or so it will increase sugar concentration as extra water inside will escape. Just don't leave it in the hot sun or you will have problems. They don't like direct sunlight once they are harvested\nEdit - the perceived ripening is actually just increasing sugar concentration. As the water permeates through the rind, the sugar concentration inside the cells becomes higher\n* Elongated watermelons are watery - completely false. Again shape has little if not anything to do with taste\n* Seeded watermelons have better nutrition - completely false. We grow both seeded and seedless. Both have same nutritional content.\n\n Hope this helps some of you in your watermelon purchasing. I would be happy to answer any questions. Not doing this to benefit our company, but I would like everyone to buy more watermelons!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kcftt8/watermelon_misconceptions/", "created_utc": 1746123882.0, "score": 5510, "author": "tmills3131", "num_comments": 335, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kcftt8/watermelon_misconceptions/", "html_title": ""}

It all started out something simple such as instant ramen noodles then later made more variety of dishes after learning some recipes from Youtube & Tiktok. It then became a passion of mine where I began making multicultural cuisines from all over the world as a project and also it gave me something to be interested in to learn about the culture, traditions, origins behind these cuisines. \n\nI made dishes such as Russian Borscht. Korean Jhapae, English Breakfast, French Onion Soup, Swedish Meatballs, Chinese Chicken Chow Mein, Swedish Meatballs, etc. \n\nFor the record, I grew up and was raised in Canada and my family immigrated here and ran a Chinese Takeout businiess \ud83e\udd61 so growing up, I never actually took advantage to help out nor did I ever cared about cooking/food since it was never my interest until now. I even had my first job working at Tim Hortons (which is culinary I suppose) but it only lasted about a week and another job which is Peri Peri chicken restaurant but failed miserably on that too. Only reason I had those jobs was because I used my family's name to catapult me an employment without actually having any experience in the kitchen at all and the one lesson I learned from that was back in High School my teacher taught us  \"There is NO shortcuts in life\". (And that statement can't be anymore true).\n\nNow that I have actually put in the amount of effort and the discipline over the years in learning and cooking \ud83c\udf73 I can confidently say that I am able to work in the restaurant industry, but I am also aware what I will be expecting and know that it will be a different environment than cooking at home since I be expecting pressure and fixing the food of customers complaints and even the hostility of some of the staff I may be working with.\n\nRegardless, I have the passion and the commitment to do this (even if I fail), because it's something that I discovered that actually compelled me to keep going in life and I felt like it gave me a sense of purpose instead of being it just a regular day job. It makes me feel alive and its like my personal therapy while doing it. Every morning I even go to the kitchen and make breakfast or even dinner from scratch because I have too much pride in ordering take out and wanted to craft my skills.

The recipe describes luscious pan juices to be used when serving. However, each time I made it, the juices evaporated and burned in the pan. Should I be watching this like a hawk and add a bit of water when the juices start to disappear? Wouldn't that interfere with roasting on the base of the vegetables? Isn't that contrary to the \"flip the veggies every 15 minutes\" hands-off approach?\n\nHere's the recipe: \n\nRoasted Tomatoes and Cipollini\n\nServes four as a small dish, two as a main\n\n1 pound cipollini onions\n1 pound small Roma or large cherry tomatoes\n1/4 cup olive oil\nCoarse salt\n4 slices of country or ciabatta bread, one-inch thick\n1 15-ounce can of white beans, drained and rinsed or 1 1/2 cups cooked beans of your choice\nGarlic clove (optional)\nFew fresh basil leaves, slivered\n\nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Boil a small pot of water and blanche the cipollini for 10 seconds, then plunging them into cold water. Use a paring knife to make a small slit in each, and slide them out of their skins and outer layer.\n\nSpread peeled onions and tomatoes in a roasting pan. Drizzle with olive oil and a few good pinches of coarse salt. Toss everything together until well-coated and roast in preheated oven for about 45 minutes, reaching in every 15 minutes with a spatula to roll the tomatoes and onions around to ensure all sides get blistered.\n\nJust before you take the tomatoes and onions out, place your bread slices on the oven rack (or a tray, if you\u2019re more refined than us) and let them toast lightly. You can rub the toasts with a halved garlic clove, if you like, while still hot. Use tongs to arrange toasts in one layer on a serving platter. Dump the white beans over the bread, and using a pot holder, scrape the entire contents of the tomato-and-onion roasting pan, still hot, over the white beans.

I plan on making a chicken rice dish within the next day or two though, and I was wondering if I could at least use it to marinate some chicken one more time? That was the first time I've used buttermilk so I don't know a whole lot about cooking with it. Will my chicken turn out weird if I marinate them and then throw them in a skillet?

{"title": "A Simple Way to Make Good Tomato Sauce with Bad Tomatoes", "selftext": "  \nGuys, I wanted to share with you a simple recipe that we use to make an above-average tomato sauce with run of the mill, grocery bought tomatoes in the middle of winter. If you have the means of course you can make canned tomatoes in the summer and store them in the fridge but we\u2019re not at that point in our lives so this is something we do and if you\u2019d like you can give it a try.\u00a0\n\n  \nFirst we roast the tomatoes. Leave the skin on, a little bit of olive oil but do not salt it yet. Roast it high and until the skin blackens a little bit. Remove the green stem as this will make it easier to peel off the skin later on. Roast them for about 20 minutes in a 450 oven. Or you can air fry if that\u2019s more convenient.\u00a0\n\n  \nThen, after you peel off the skin you smash it with a potato smasher, fork, or any other tool that you have. Do not use a blender as it will water the tomatoes as if they are not already pretty watery.\u00a0\n\n  \nIn a pot put a little bit of olive oil, a clove of garlic and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes. Remove the garlic, lower the temperature to medium low and add the tomatoes. Caution: be careful when adding the tomatoes since the olive oil will be hot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd half a teaspoon of sugar, and half a teaspoon of salt per 2 lbs of raw tomatoes. Lower the heat and simmer for half an hour to 45 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdjust salt to your liking, finish with a little bit of sherry vinegar. If not available any other vinegar will work except for distilled white vinegar. That leaves an aftertaste to the tomatoes that is not desirable.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. This even works with store bought canned tomatoes. Roasting them is a little tricky but we spread them to a baking sheet and roast them high for about 10-15 minutes.\u00a0\n\n  \nIf you have any other tricks to make good tomato sauce with less than ideal tomatoes please share it.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1kazqfx/a_simple_way_to_make_good_tomato_sauce_with_bad/", "created_utc": 1745962663.0, "score": 21, "author": "sirberaferguson", "num_comments": 6, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1kazqfx/a_simple_way_to_make_good_tomato_sauce_with_bad/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Tips on making a \"stiff\" cheese sauce?", "selftext": "Sunday I made mash potato with dinner and decided to bake them, scrape the inside and keep the skins for potato skins as a simple weekday meal. It seemed tricky to season the potato skins properly, so I thought \"Why not make a thick cheese sauce with the bacon and seasoning in it? That way I can taste as I season.\" and honestly, this worked, if imperfectly. I didn't want to start with a bechamel as I wanted the cheese to be fairly solid at room temp, but it had to be liquid enough when heated to get on to the potatoes, and brown a bit under the broiler on finishing.\n\nSo while potato skin dinner [totally worked out fine](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1324026463871307786/1366875229468622889/20250429_163324.jpg?ex=68128942&is=681137c2&hm=0647294ed3e5d4f2967f51da1208bc31f1609a41351bb03903001b0d791f574c&), I feel confident there is a better and/or easier way. Should I use a jury rigged bain marie instead of just a sauce pot (pot has a layer of burnt cheese on the bottom now)?

I swear I\u2019d dip my first born child in horseradish sauce if I had one).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1ka0jmg/whatre_you_cooking_this_week/", "created_utc": 1745859527.0, "score": 72, "author": "rac3868", "num_comments": 228, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1ka0jmg/whatre_you_cooking_this_week/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Different recipe management and import apps, which one is best for you?", "selftext": "After trying a ton of cooking recipe apps, I\u2019ve narrowed down the ones that really stood out to me. These apps do a fantastic job at recipe importing, meal planning, and helping organize everything in a way that\u2019s intuitive and user-friendly. Whether you're looking for something free or willing to pay for extra features, here\u2019s my list of the best cooking apps to compare:\n\n1. **Cooklang (Free)**\u00a0Cooklang is a fantastic option if you like to keep things simple and organized with a text-based system. It's designed to store recipes in a clean, easy-to-read format, which can be helpful for meal planning without needing to mess around with complicated apps. You can easily track ingredients and keep everything in one place without feeling overwhelmed\n2. **Paprika (Paid)**\u00a0Paprika has been a go-to for many home cooks for years. It\u2019s great for organizing recipes, creating shopping lists, and planning meals. The recipe import feature works well, and while it\u2019s not free, it\u2019s worth the investment for its solid, reliable features and user interface\n3. **Deglaze (Free)**\u00a0This app is a great free option for people who need simplicity and ease. It does an excellent job at importing recipes and organizing them without overwhelming you with unnecessary features. The clean interface makes meal planning and shopping a breeze, making it a great option if you don\u2019t want to pay for an app\n4. **Spillt (Free)**\u00a0Spillt is fantastic if you're looking for a free app with a focus on using what you already have. It helps you cook from your pantry, suggesting recipes based on what\u2019s in your fridge. It\u2019s a perfect option for reducing food waste, and the recipe suggestions are actually really solid\n5. **ReciMe (Paid)**\u00a0ReciMe is great if you want something that combines organization with meal tracking. It lets you save recipes, plan meals, and even automatically generate shopping lists. The paid version offers additional features like nutrition tracking, which makes it ideal for anyone who wants to stick to a specific diet or meal plan\n6. **Yummly (Free, with premium option)**\u00a0Yummly is another widely-used app that\u2019s great for finding new recipes based on your taste preferences, dietary needs, and even ingredients you already have. It\u2019s free to use, but you can upgrade to the premium version for extra features like advanced filtering and grocery delivery integrations.\n7. **BigOven (Free, with premium option)**\u00a0BigOven is a solid app that allows you to save recipes, create meal plans, and generate grocery lists. It\u2019s a popular choice due to its huge database of recipes and ease of use. The free version gives you plenty of options, but if you want to unlock more advanced features, the premium version is worth checking out.\n8. **CookPal AI (Paid)** This is an APP that can import recipes from anywhere, just like recime. What I like most about it is its voice-assisted cooking function, which is very friendly for novices or those who are not very familiar with the dishes. It can tell me how to do it step by step and can deal with various abnormal situations during the cooking process.\n\nThese apps each bring something unique to the table, whether it\u2019s ease of use, recipe organization, or meal planning tools.

The last two I know are pricier but I do like that fuzzy logic, and options for different types of rice. I do make sushi from time to time, but hate doing it in pot on the stove.  I eat enough rice with meals that I can justify spending like $60-80 on a good rice cooker, But how much of a difference is there between them all. I do also like the thought of cooking all in one pot too. A cup of rice, with veggies or meats with the rice at same time.  \n\nIt is only me, so something 3 cup is just fine, my Instant pot is like 6 quarts, so way too much.

Combine with 12oz well-rinsed elbows, bake at 350 for 20 minutes, serve.

IOW I now had a very thin vigorously-boiling liquid plus a clump of rubber.  Adding bits more cheese only made things worse.  Increasing temp in a (perhaps misguided) attempt to compel melting only had the effect of turning the clump of rubber into a clump of brick.  Higher heat to keep the liquid portion at a strong boil (at this point I was collecting data about what went wrong, it was obviously inedible) for \\~30 minutes, while adding more of the cheese, only had the effect of congealing more until I had effectively no liquid left; by the time 1 1/4c of the cheese had been added I had components of and (a) rubber, (b) glue, nothing left to which I could add more.  That then readily reached 300F (per my InstaPen) with no signs of melting whatsoever.  350F started to produce some charring but no liquefaction, 375 was where I had to stop lest I start setting off smoke alarms.\n\nI think I've got a pretty solid grasp of the thermodynamics of this recipe in practice, and combining the same ingredients from the same stores in the same way consistently produced the same results... until this time iti didn't.\n\nWhat Did I Do Wrong?\n\nP.S.

This came after only a month or so of cooking, and was... frustrating to say the least. A few commenters scolded me for pushing her too hard, which she got a giggle at (for you see, it is I who is being tugged along in this escipade, and I have actually tried to pull her back to the basics many times). \n\nHer knife was dull, which made cubing the pork a nightmare. Her pie crust set incorrectly because the recipe was vague and annoying. The book told her itd take an hour and a half, but didnt account for prep work (ingredients listed called for everything to be pre-chopped), and she was in the kitchen for over 6hrs trying to make it work.\n\nI sat and watched the whole ordeal, and made myself busy by posting here to chat with others about her progress, and get some tips. She ended up giving up at around 3 in the morning, when her crust was clearly crumbled beyond repair. We had a small cry to let out some frustrations, talked it through, and made pasta instead.\n\nToday, however, she woke up with an unmatched vengeance. This woman is an unstoppable force. I, and many others in the comments, believed these pies to be far outside her skill set (and they are!) but today we marched our way over to the mall, dropped the bucks on a brand-new chefs knife, and griped about these damn pies.\n\nThe filling from last night was kept, but the crust was recreated tonight, as well as the quails eggs. Here, against all odds, are the pork pies that took 24 whole hours to create. They are misshapen lil devils with overcooked pork and uneven egg washes, and they are DELICIOUS.  \n\nIll never try to hold her back again, though she did promise to cool it on the complicated stuff from now on.\n\nThank you to everyone here who steered us in the right direction.

I assume that there's too much in terms of fine particles in there still and I'm wondering if there's some intermediate filtering I should be doing before the coffee filter, or if anyone has any advice for me.\n\nThanks for any advice or suggestions!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1k81nc1/best_way_to_strain_out_fine_particles/", "created_utc": 1745631791.0, "score": 1, "author": "dougalg", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/Cooking/comments/1k81nc1/best_way_to_strain_out_fine_particles/", "html_title": ""}

But none of those things were life changing.\n\nThen, I was introduced to Kerrygold. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a lot better than what I grew up eating, but I still didn\u2019t get the hype.\n\nThree months ago, I was shopping in Central Market and they were having a sale on all European butters. I decided to buy Le Gall salted French premium butter on a whim. When I got home, I made a grilled cheese sandwich, and with the first bite I immediately understood why the French mock us. It was undeniably the best grilled cheese sandwich that I\u2019ve ever made. I usually cut off the crust and give it to my dog, but I didn\u2019t that time; he was indignant, I was inspired!\n\nNow? Buttered toast: a revelation! Steamed broccoli: transformed! Pasta with butter: divine! Grits: revolutionary! Mashed potatoes: *chef\u2019s kiss*.\n\nI\u2019m almost out of the Le Gall, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to go back to my old life. Do you all have any favorite brands that you love? I\u2019m open to trying new things.

That way, I could potentially get rid of my pop up toaster, toaster oven, and air fryer, or at least take them off the counter/out of the kitchen most of the time. \n\nThe problem is that I haven't really come across much of anyone comparing alternatives.
