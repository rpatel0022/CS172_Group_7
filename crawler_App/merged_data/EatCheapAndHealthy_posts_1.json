{"title": "FROM A PROFESSIONAL CHEF TO YOU: The tricks that anyone should know when they buy food.", "selftext": "I wager everyone here knows some of these things, but I\u2019m gonna list everything I can think of in regards to eating healthy and well. I\u2019m gonna make this a list with sections, so hopefully it\u2019s easy enough to parse.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-LEGUMES\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Buy these dried as often as possible. Keep a stock of beans, lentils, and dried chickpeas around if you can. They\u2019re cheap, almost always available, and virtually imperishable. As such, assuming you don\u2019t throw them out and keep them properly stored, buying these is a 100% return on your investment. \n\n-Legumes are one of the most versatile options in your kitchen. As long as you soak them and put them in the fridge before you go to bed they\u2019ll be available the next day to cook quickly. These are the best thing to have if you\u2019re looking to stretch a meal because of their nutrient density and the fact that they\u2019re just damn delicious on their own. \n\n-Look into middle-eastern and African cuisine for creative ways to use these ingredients. Some really common examples are lentil curry, hummus, falafels, and putting chickpeas in a shakshuka. This isn\u2019t a recipe post, so look up how to make them yourself - some grandma has a better (and probably even cheaper) recipe than I do.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-GRAINS AND CEREALS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-Like legumes, these are very versatile. However, I find most people know very little about them outside of wheat and maybe oats. I highly recommend learning what the most commonly eaten grans and cereals in your locality are, and then finding the affordable ones. There will be at least one. I guarantee it. \n\n-FLOUR is an essential staple, unless you\u2019re celiac or gluten free - a topic on which I won\u2019t speak because I\u2019m confident anyone who has to deal with those issues knows more than I do. I recommend grabbing all-purpose flour due to its gluten content being a middle ground between low-gluten pastry flour and high-gluten bread flour. You can still use it to make bread, and it has a myriad other uses as a binder or thickener for sauces. \n\n-RICE is amazing, as most know already, but seriously - it\u2019s one of the most important crops in the world. It\u2019s kept civilizations alive on its back for all of recorded history, and it\u2019ll keep you alive, too. There is no better \u201cfill me up\u201d food I can think of.  Wait for those huge sacks of rice to go on sale (it happens pretty frequently), then buy 2. They last forever. Ideally grab long-grain rice if you\u2019re just looking for a side-dish or fried rice base, but in a pinch short grain\u2019ll do; it\u2019s just less forgiving and the starches don\u2019t retrograde as fully so when you cool it it doesn\u2019t keep as nicely. \n\n-KEEP IN MIND that rice is pure carbs. It\u2019s a good base, but you need other stuff to go with it or else you\u2019ll be deficient in nutrients and feel awful all the time. Trust me from experience - college me went through a raw-egg-on-rice phase, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. \n\n-BARLEY, also, is amazing, but for other reasons. It\u2019s high in protein and iron, and can help dramatically improve your nutrient intake for very little cost. In soups, roasted in tea (thanks Korea), and used in tandem with rice, it can go a very, very long way in making your diet a more sustainable one in times of austerity and plenty, alike.\n\n-AVOID \u201cSUPERFOODS\u201d. Not because they\u2019re bad for you - just because of their jacked prices. Not to mention oftentimes the industries surrounding them are ethical nightmares. Don\u2019t get me started on avocado cartels and the impact of quinoa farming on low-income South American communities. In reality, most grains and cereals have a lot of nutrients and minerals, and they\u2019re often overlooked. Learn the nutrition facts, and make decisions accordingly. Google and online databases are your friends, here. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n-ONIONS: buy them fresh and store them in dry, enclosed spaces, and buy tomatoes canned and without salt added. Use onions in almost everything, they\u2019re delicious, cheap, and nutritious. \n\n-TOMATOES: Good fresh and better canned. Use fresh tomatoes raw for whatever you want and use canned tomatoes for sauces. Buy canned tomatoes with as little added salt and sugar as possible. \n\n- POTATOES: Treat these as a starch option similar to grains or cereals. Buy them unprocessed, in a sack.  Store them in dry, enclosed spaces. \n\n-BASICALLY EVERY FRUIT: go for it, these things are nutrient bombs and they\u2019re delicious. Buy them seasonally for the best value and if you have a day to do so, preserve them if you ever see a huge sale. I\u2019m still enjoying lacto-fermented blueberries from last year\u2019s insane blueberry harvest where I could buy a pint for a dollar.\n\n-FOR SHOPPING: Generally when you buy produce you should go, in order, to the discount rack, then the sales, and then everything else. Someone out there has a recipe for literally everything, and some of them are even good. A pepper with a blemish or tiny spot of mold is still fine, assuming you cut away the blemish or tiny spot of mold. \n\n-I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH; FIND THE UNDER-APPRECIATED AND OVER-SUPPLIED PRODUCE. There\u2019s always a bin of some forgotten veggie no-one eats for some reason. In the west, at least, it seems to often be rutabagas/turnips. I\u2019ve also seen apples in the fall, corn, and cabbages fall into this category. This is because of a good harvest, or because of a lack of consumer interest - any time this happens, capitalize on it. Everything is delicious if you cook it properly. Buy seasonally, and learn how to use the things you buy. You\u2019ll eat like a king and pay like a pauper.\n\n-CANNED STUFF - I generally have a personal aversion to all canned veggies and fruits except tomatoes, but that\u2019s just my privilege speaking. If you want to buy them or if fresh produce is hard to come by, avoid getting anything with added salt or sugar. Cross-reference the nutrient info on the can with info from a fresh counterpart to avoid buying filler garbage, and try to find somewhere to live with better food accessibility. Alternatively, save up and make a killing by opening a fruit and vegetable market to remove the need to read this very ling post any further. (This is a joke and I recognize the struggle of those in impoverished communities with awful food accessibility.)\n\n-FROZEN STUFF - frozen fruit and veg is great,\nmostly. Maybe dodge the chopped carrots and corn a lot of us ate growing up or find in bad takeout Chinese food, but hey - grab that bag of frozen berries or peas and throw \u2018em in anything that warrants it. Technology for frozen produce has improved dramatically in the last few decades, and we should capitalize on that.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014-PROTEINS\u2014\u2014-\n\n-IF YOU EAT MEAT, buy the least processed cuts you can. Whole chickens, meat on the bone, and ground meats are your best friends. Go to butcher shops, if you can. Freezing meat is fine, but try to avoid buying pre-made frozen protein options. Get raw product and do the work yourself to save a LOT of cash and get better food out of it.\n\n-MEAT IS A LUXURY, NOT AN ESSENTIAL. I say this because in modern western culture eating meat everyday is seen as normal. This is an oddity when we examine all of human history, and this notion should be abandoned if we\u2019re trying to live more affordably. Meat is grossly overrepresented in most diets, and you should always ask if you could cut your portion of meat down in exchange for more vegetables and grains.\n\n-LEARN HOW TO BREAK DOWN YOUR PROTEINS. A chicken isn\u2019t just 8 portions of meat - it\u2019s also bones and carcass for a stock or soup, fat to be rendered out and used as a cooking oil (thanks, jewish folks!), and skin to be cooked down into delicious little chips. This same list can be used for\npork, beef, and any other mammal you eat. \n\n-FISH IS IFFY. Like, as an industry. Not many people know their fish, and fish processing companies know that and capitalize on it. I always tell people who like fish to buy fresh and whole, and to learn how to pick good fish. Buying cheap processed fish products is akin to asking to be ripped off, to harm the environment, and to accumulate toxins in your body, all at the same time. To not get completely F-ed over by what is maybe the worst food industry in the world you need to know your fish, know the company you\u2019re buying from, and know who\u2019s doing the fishing. Good luck, and please try not to contribute to the death of our water ecosystems. (A good trick is that if you can afford fish when you\u2019re poor and you don\u2019t live beside a large body of water, you almost certainly DON\u2019T WANT IT.)\n\n-IF YOU DO BUY FISH OR SEAFOOD, all the rules for proteins apply. Fish bones and crustacean shells for stock, fat deposits on the occasional salmonid for whatever you want, and fish skin, if it\u2019s your cup of tea, for a lovely snack. Hell, fish organs and salt make up the base for a fermented fish sauce, if you really want to go the extra mile. Rome survived off of fish sauce and bread for longer than our society has been around. The one big difference between fish and meat is that frozen fish tends to suck relative to fresh in a much bigger way - both in terms of quality and retained nutrients. Put frozen fish in soups or curries, to avoid nutrient drain from the water that inevitably will leak out of your fish.\n\nFOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS: You know more about your protein options than I do, and honestly they would require a lot of research I haven\u2019t done to fully discuss. Clearly I have more to learn on the subject, and intend to do so. I only encourage you all to do the same \u270c\ufe0f\n\n\u2014\u2014-EVERYTHING ELSE\u2014\u2014-\n\n-STAY AWAY FROM THE INSTANT RAMEN. I know it\u2019s cheap. I KNOW you like how easy it is. I don\u2019t give one flying fuck. It\u2019s awful for you, it isn\u2019t cheaper than a bowl of rice with soy sauce, a fried egg, and some frozen peas, and it\u2019ll kill you slowly. Just don\u2019t, and ignore anyone\u2019s advice about how it got them through college. Hell, if anyone\u2019s advice involves doing what they did in college, take it with a grain of salt. There\u2019s good advice sometimes, and a LOT of bad.\n\n-AVOID THE JUNK FOOD AISLES. Chips, sugar cereals, premade salad dressings, sweet juice/pop, and processed foods like KD or tv dinners are not the way to go if you\u2019re looking to get the most out of your dollar at the grocery store. They\u2019re bad for you, they\u2019re expensive relative to the cost of production, and they put a burden on your body that you\u2019ll pay for down the line. Exceptions to this are staple sauces like a good soy sauce and fish sauce, grains and legumes, and canned veggies. \n\n-CHEESE IS A LUXURY, SO TREAT IT LIKE ONE. If you\u2019re gonna buy it I recommend buying less of it less often, and buying the good stuff when you do. Kraft block cheese only costs as little as it does because it\u2019s the by-product of the real money-maker: whey protein production. If you\u2019re gonna buy cheese, please support a real cheesemaker. The cheese lover in you will be happier for it. \n\n-ALCOHOL IS ALSO A LUXURY. If you want a drink, I recommend doing it less often and drinking the good stuff. If you like the cheap stuff that\u2019s fine, \u201cgood stuff\u201d is all relative anyway. Just drink less and focus on quality over quantity, whatever your preferences are. \n\n-MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE, AND BUY A THERMOS. I know Starbucks is delicious. Guess what? You can find a recipe for every drink they make online, and then make it better. Some restaurants literally survive because they can sell coffee at a nearly 2000% markup. Truck stop diners and high-end coffee shops do this. I recommend making cold brew the night before, since you literally just have to strain it in the morning rather than brewing a pot.\n\n-FINALLY, LEARN TO COOK. All of this information is fundamentally more useful if you know how to cook. Not knowing how to cook is a luxury afforded to those with the means to afford living in ignorance of this most basic human skill. You are living outside your means if you live in a well-off country, don\u2019t make a least $60k a year, and can\u2019t cook. \n\n\nBest of luck to you all. Stay safe out there.\n\nEDIT: A number of folks pointed out lots of things to me which I wasn\u2019t aware of in regard to beekeeping, so I cut that section out as it was misrepresentative of the industry and failed to highlight key problems in it. Others felt I was being mean to vegans and vegetarians and regardless as to my intentions, I can see evidence that that whole section detracts from this list as a whole and isn\u2019t informative enough to keep. I\u2019ve removed it accordingly. Thanks for the feedback, positive or negative - keep doing good work \u270c\ufe0f\n\nEDIT: Someone made a good point that grocery stores are all laid out different, and not everyone knows the \u201ccentre aisles\u201d mantra. So I changed it to \u201cJunk food aisles\u201d for clarity.\n\nEDIT: I somehow mistakenly said South African communities were effected by Quinoa production when in fact it\u2019s primarily South American.

{"title": "My guide to feeding yourself when your mental health is garbage", "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m no expert at all but I do have mental illness and I go through flares where my mental health blows. I\u2019m also responsible for feeding a family and I have a tight budget for that so I\u2019ve learned some things. Hopefully my trial and error can help another human. \n\n-convenience fruits and veggies are totally worth it. Things like grapes, berries, pears, apples, oranges, mini cucumbers, mini peppers, baby carrots, etc. Things that require almost no prep, you can wash them all at once when you bring them home and then just eat them. I wouldn\u2019t go for pre-cut because it\u2019s a waste of money but I find that having a banana or pear ready to go is really helpful. \n\n-keeping things like hummus, string cheese, peanuts, nuts, and seeds in the house is also convenient for healthy and easy snacking. If you have appetite issues or food aversions with your lows, definitely keeping nuts and peanut butter around are good because they\u2019re nutritious *and* high calorie to help keep you fueled. I find nuts like almonds and walnuts to be cheaper in the baking aisle too fyi. \n\n-canned beans. Nuff said. \n\n-on a good day, cook a whole bag of rice or quinoa (or both). I also prep entire bags of dried beans at once. Freeze in portions (1/2 cup is a serving). On really hard days, you can simply zap it with frozen veggies. \n-which brings me to my next, stock up on frozen veggies. I buy the big bags of steamable ones at sams and keep frozen cauliflower rice/frozen peppers in my house at all times. \n\n-a handful of prepared spice combinations (I like garlic/salt/rosemary, BBQ rub, and good ol\u2019 fashioned seasoned salt) in the cupboard to sprinkle on food is good. Don\u2019t always gotta bust out all the stops, sometimes microwaved beans and rice with BBQ rub on top is more than enough. \n\n-be okay with changing your standards. You\u2019re doing what you can. Sometimes cheese and crackers with baby carrots is a complete meal, that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re never too old for a peanut butter sandwich. \n\nIf you have anything to add, please feel free to do so. Good luck!\n\nEdit: words and formatting\n\nEdit 2: I promise I will respond to everyone when I get the chance but HONESTLY THANK YOU ALL. I didn\u2019t expect this response at all!

{"title": "If you're bored of eating Western style eggs, try cooking it Thai style instead!", "selftext": "As a Thai person, I'm always eager to share the different ways I work with one cheap, universally common staple: eggs! \n\nNow these aren\u2019t really recipes, they\u2019re more like methods that you can try if you like eggs but want some variety without spending extra money. \n\n**Thai omelettes (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27)**\n\nUnlike French omelettes (which are delicately yellow and cooked in butter), Thai style omelettes range from golden yellow to brown in color (not burnt) and is fried in \\*HOT\\* oil like sunflower oil. This gives the omelette a really nice smoky amora, almost like popcorn? You can even pour the beaten egg mixture through a sieve into a pan/wok of hot oil, and it'll be super crispy/wispy like [this](https://www.clipmass.com/upload/news/49/48368_full.jpg). I love it with sriracha (probably one of the only instances where we actually use this ingredient, surprisingly) with a plate of rice. \n\n**Thai steamed eggs (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e15\u0e38\u0e4b\u0e19)**\n\nThis is similar to the Japanese chawanmushi, where an egg mixture (which is super customisable btw - but just adding green onions/scallions is common) is beaten, seasoned with soy sauce, a paste of cilantro root* garlic and black peppercorns (you can blend the 3 or use a mortar and pestle), and finally, pork/chicken stock. Then you steam it in a bowl for 20-30 mins. The result is like a savoury pudding/custard that should be eaten with rice - a very kid-friendly meal and is commonly eaten with you're feeling sick and want something hot and easy to digest. \n\n**Fried eggs (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e14\u0e32\u0e27)**\n\nLike the omelette, Thai people like fried eggs to be *really* fried in hot frying oil (so olive oil wouldn't work for this). The edges of the whites are crispy (a bit of browning adds a lot of flavor). The yolk isn't  exactly sunny side up, because a key technique is to 'baste' the yolk in the oil until it turns slightly white while maintaining its overall runniness. Fantastic with rice and fish sauce (plus chopped garlic and chilies if you want).\n\n**Grilled eggs (\u0e44\u0e02\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07)**\n\nThis is probably the least well-known egg cooking method/recipe for both Thais and non-Thais as it's a street food item that you don't really see that much anymore. I recommend this for special occasions as its quite labor intensive. Basically... the contents of the eggs are taken out through a small hole (you can use a pin), thoroughly strained, seasoned with pepper and soy sauce, beaten, poured back into the eggs, steamed, put on skewers and then grilled/toasted. The toast adds a really nice smokiness that makes its way into the egg mixture. The result should be like boiled eggs but with flavour. Side note: I\u2019m not sure how hygienic the eggs are in your country so check food regulations before trying this recipe as every country is different!\n\nEdit: clarity\n\n*cilantro stems work in a pinch \n\nEdit 2: Wow this blew up!

{"title": "Depression meals- What I\u2019m doing.", "selftext": "So, I\u2019ve been going through a rough patch with my depression, and I wanted to post with a point: eating cheaply and healthily is 100% a spectrum. I went to the grocery store today and bought $50 worth of groceries, which is NOT a cheap budget. But I realized that I wasn\u2019t eating well this week because my depression was stopping me from doing basic things, like making rice. So I bought store brand microwaveable rice. I bought rotisserie chicken. I bought name brand cereal and coffee creamer and I don\u2019t feel guilty. If buying a $3.50 rotisserie chicken and $2 microwave rice stops me from ordering pizza every couple of days, that\u2019s still saving money.\nIf you can\u2019t do your normal cooking routine right now, I\u2019m giving you permission to take some shortcuts. If all you can manage is boxed Mac and cheese, then have the boxed Mac and cheese, because you are doing your best. No matter how you\u2019re reducing your budget and nourishing your body, I am proud of you.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the support and well wishes. Because of the overwhelming amount of comments to these points, I want to clarify some things. I have an instant pot, which has a rice cooker function. It\u2019s great, but measuring out the water and rice, rinsing and waiting is more than I have in me right now. I also definitely eat vegetables. My freezer currently has 13 bags of frozen vegetables in it. I also obviously didn\u2019t list everything I purchased. I know how and genuinely like to cook, I just can\u2019t manage it right now. I meal prep, I batch cook, just not right now. I am going on three weeks of this round of depression, so most of my pre-prepared food has been eaten. \nI don\u2019t eat pizza for every meal, or even all that often. This is not my forever diet. It\u2019s not perfect. But it\u2019s what I can manage right now. \nKeep on fighting the good fight, lovelies. You can do this.\n\nUPDATE:\nIt has been a little while since I posted this, but I wanted to explain a little bit about what I have actually been eating over the past week and a half, as I am still in the depression mode.\n1. Most of my breakfasts have been pretty simple. Fruit (bananas, apples or berries) and either oatmeal made with milk or whole grain toast with peanut butter.\n2. Lunches and dinners have been combinations of rice/macaroni/quinoa, broccoli/cauliflower, precooked ground beef from my freezer/rotisserie chicken and cheese/sour cream. \n3. Snacks have been cheddar cheese, fruit, cottage cheese and dry Cheerios for those inconvenient snack attacks. I was also graciously given a couple of boxes of homemade cookies that I popped in the freezer that I\u2019ve been defrosting a few at a time.\nI am getting veggies every day, I am getting fruit every day. \nI also take a multivitamin every day, and a couple additional vitamins to cover any gaps in my nutrition. \nI did make broth from my rotisserie bones and skin, and I\u2019ve been using that broth as cooking liquid. \nFor anyone who is struggling now, I hope you take care of yourself.

Up until recently, I\u2019ll been draining the remaining liquid and storing the beans, but I decided to save some a little while ago and add it to a soup I had.\n\nOH MY GOD. It is so good. The bean broth has a bit of starch in it so it adds this unctuous bit of thickness \u2014 barely noticeable and yet all the same incredible. The flavor is almost kind of toasty and nutty, and a little sweet too. It is fantastic.\n\nFor the love of all that is holy, save your bean liquid.

But there are some recipes that you just can't.\n\nI always die a little inside when I see a recipe call for browning mushrooms for 2-4 minutes and then onions for 2-3 minutes.\\*  You can get sooooo much extra flavor by just allowing them to cook longer.

You want to be afraid of the spider that made that web sized \"EWWWW\" on the melon.\n\nYou also want some weird spot that looks kinda orange. That spot sat on the ground. It didn't get a suntan. If the watermelon was picked too early it'll be white or just pale because it's still ripening. Those aren't bad but weren't done.\n\n\\#3 Look at the stem. You want dry\n\nMost of us have carved a pumpkin. When you make a jack o lantern there is always a hard woody stem on the top of the pumpkin. That is what you look for on a watermelon. The stem will have been cut short but you don't want any green in the stem. You want it UGLY and dry. If you look at the stem and it looks like the inside of a cucumber it's NOT DONE YET.\n\n\\#4 No shine.\n\nA shiny watermelon has too much moisture. Shiny watermelons are like teenagers with acne. They're leaking and not ready for prime time.\n\nSome grocery chains put wax on produce so don't rely on this as much as rules 1, 2 and 3.\n\nTIL - too many people are thumping watermelons.\n\nIt's not knock knock exercise like the watermelon will answer the door and say \"I'm sweet because I'm hollow!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" You are looking for the \"ugly ducking\" of the group that is gonna answer the door in sweat pants while saying \"Come on in.

{"title": "As a regular volunteer, please use food pantries!", "selftext": "\nI\u2019ve seen this topic come up on this sub a few times and figured I\u2019d make a post on it. A lot of people post stuff like \u201cI have $20 to last me until my first paycheck in 3 weeks, what should I eat?\u201d I want to encourage you to look for food pantries in your area and use their services. \n\nAll this is from my experience in a mid-sized US city; things may work differently elsewhere, but most of the general ideas still apply. \n\n**tl;dr if you think you could possibly benefit from visiting a food bank, food pantry, or other free/reduced cost food organization, please do.** The people who work there want you to use it. You are not \u201ctaking away\u201d food from people who \u201cneed it more\u201d, because 1) everyone needs and deserves to eat and 2) often there is enough or too much food\u2014the resources food banks are short on are more to do with insufficient funding, and more clients = more money allocated to them.  \n\nI have volunteered for a couple months at a food pantry, but it is part of a larger organization I have volunteered at for years doing other food-related work (largely cooking and distributing hot meals), so I get to see how food donations come in and how we sort and allocate them. The organization I volunteer at serves a lot of needs in the community but one of their target populations is homeless youth, which is the demographic served by the hot meal program. The food pantry program serves a wider range of people (I started volunteering there because they need someone who speaks Spanish, and I\u2019m unemployed now so the scheduling works out well). I also sometimes unload and sort donations from grocery stores and the city food bank, which in addition to providing food to individuals, also distributes it to other organizations throughout the city. \n\nSome things that I\u2019ve noticed that might surprise people:\n\n* we often have too much food. By this I mean we get donated much more food than we have the capacity to cook, or people do not take all the food we serve. \n\n* On the rare occasion we do run out of food, it is more likely that we didn\u2019t plan to cook enough, or had an unexpected influx of clients; I can\u2019t think of a time that the hot meal program ran out of raw ingredients. (The food pantry and hot meal program share ingredients and distribute them as needed.) \n\n* The food pantry will often run out of high-demand items like milk, eggs, and culturally specific staple foods (like masa harina amongst the Hispanic clients) but even when this happens there is often an excess of other items that are perfectly good, just a little less familiar. The food pantry had two huge boxes of bok choy go nearly untouched this week; it got distributed to other sites so it\u2019s not going to waste, but people were preferring to take fruits and veggies they knew how to cook and that their families would recognize. We\u2019ve had the same cans of pur\u00e9ed pumpkin sitting on the self for weeks; there\u2019s nothing wrong with it, it\u2019s just less familiar to people so they gravitate towards other items. \n\n* There are nice, high-quality foods available, including a mix of fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable foods. We get lots of donations from Whole Foods and local stores in a similar price range, so there are many vegan and gluten-free options available as well as some really tasty baked goods and ready-to-eat meals. This time of year, grocery stores are going overboard on cookies for the holidays, so we have lots of those, to the point where volunteers are encouraged to take them home because we can\u2019t give them away fast enough. \n\n* Speaking of which\u2014volunteers and staff eat the same food as clients, because it is good food. Nothing is gross or bad\u2014sometimes it is past the sell-by date but we have government guidelines as to how long different items stay safe to eat past their sell-by dates. For example, we keep milk for a week after its sell-by date and throw it out after. A lot of stuff has not even reached its sell-by date but has some minor issue like the package being dented, it\u2019s still perfectly good to eat.  \n\n* We are not judging you for using our services. If you have special needs like allergies or religious food restrictions, we will try to find something for you. Of course there are jerks working in every industry, but in general, if someone chooses to work or volunteer for a food pantry or other free food program, it is because they want to help, and believe everyone deserves enough to eat. \n\nIn general, American grocery stores have tons of perfectly good ingredients they can\u2019t sell for whatever reason, and we usually get more than enough donated. Where nonprofit food programs have shortages is often in other areas\u2014they can\u2019t hire enough full time staff to keep food pantries open more than a few hours a week, or pay their staff enough to prevent burnout and high turnover. Or they can\u2019t afford equipment, vehicles, real estate, etc. The food itself is unlikely to be what\u2019s limiting them; they need money, and nonprofits get funding based on use. By using the food pantry, you are directly contributing to them being able to get more funds and provide more/better services. It\u2019s not a direct 1:1 relationship between clients and funding but they will put things like \u201cx number of clients used our services this year\u201d in grant applications, and a higher number will lead to more money for them.  \n\nSo please\u2014if you are in the position of having to feed yourself and/or others with very little money, while this sub can be a great resource on how to do that cheaply, please please please see what is available in your community and do not hesitate to make use of it!

{"title": "Spend more at the grocery store if it\u2019ll prevent you from eating out!", "selftext": "For the longest time when I went to the grocery store I tried to only buy things that were the best value. I\u2019d only buy the lowest priced regardless of what it was. This meant the lowest quality lunch meats, steaks, chicken, prok chops, bread, cheese etc. This caused me to always make excuses for why I needed to go out and eat. \n\nA few weeks ago I decided to spend a bit more on groceries and went to Whole Foods(mostly overpriced I know) I bought 2 steaks for my girlfriend and I and made them the following day. That was honestly the first time I\u2019ve ever enjoyed eating steak at home! Instead of being disappointed in the meal and already thinking of excuses to go to Outback or something similar over the weekend I was excited to go back to the grocery store and buy another. Yes the steak cost me ~$3 more than what I normally spend on steak but $3 is a lot better than $40 at Outback. \n\nBasically if you\u2019re like me and your biggest problem is eating out too much even when you buy groceries, start looking into high quality food. You\u2019ll end up saving money from not eating out in the long run even if the grocery trip is an extra $20. \n\nTL;DR: Spend extra at the grocery store if it even prevents you from eating out once. That $40 you spent going out to eat will go a lot further at the grocery store.\n\nEdit: I never said I thought Outback was actually a good steakhouse. I just used it as an example of some mid tier decently priced place to eat. I could have said something like buy better salad dressing to prevent you from wanting to go out and buying a salad.

{"title": "Asian stores are great for long shelf life healthy survival/camping food", "selftext": "My Korean grocery store near me has some of the best long shelf life food for easy meals in under 30 minutes. Here are some items for rapid/instant soups made out of ingredients that are shelf-stable:\n\n* [Case of 12 x 12 oz silken tofu](https://www.swansonvitamins.com/mori-nu-organic-silken-tofu-soft-12-oz-pkg) (Mori-Nu brand) ($10-$13)  \n* Dried seaweed ([wakame](https://www.vitacost.com/eden-foods-wakame-sea-vegetable-2-1-oz) & kombu)  \n* Dried [shitake](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/panda-dried-shitake-mushrooms/1071900500.html), oyster & other mushrooms  \n* bags of [Korean red pepper flakes](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Korean-Chili-Powder-Gochugaru-Sun-Dried-Non-GMO-Red-Pepper-Flakes-Coarse-Gound-1LBS/701814966) & other spices  \n* bags of dried anchovy/[anchovy powder](https://www.ebay.com/i/253482241200)/bonito flakes   \n* bags of powdered soup base ([beef soup powder with actual beef as a main ingredient](https://www.ebay.com/i/143202053579), chicken with actual chicken as a main ingredient, crab, clam etc)  \n* dried noddles (rice noodles, wheat/ramen style noodles, buckwheat noodles, [bean thread noodles](https://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/orchids-saifun-bean-thread-8-oz))  \n* [Doenjang](https://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/ingredients/article/cooking-with-korean-doenjang)/Gochujang bean paste (Korean equivalent of miso, regular or with red pepper added)\n\nHere's a recipe for an instant camp soup using the above:\n\nSoup spices: dried ginger, dried garlic powder, dried red pepper, salt & pepper\n\nsoup flavor: powdered beef, chicken, anchovy or other powdered soup base  \n\ngreens: 2 tbsp dried wakame, small strip of kombu, or whatever greens you have in the fridge like spinach, or growing around camp like lambs' quarters, plaintains, burdock. If you like to forage, this is for you.\n\nprotein: cut up a 12-oz block of pantry tofu, poach some eggs in there, or whatever leftover protein you have on hand\n\ncarb: You can also throw any kind of dried noodles in there, as Asian style noodles cook quickly. Bean threads are transparent and really cool, rice noodles cook practically instantly, buckwheat noodles have to be cooked separately & drained and added to a soup, wheat/ramen style noodles also cook instantly. You can also serve with rice\n\nYou can make a wide variety of soups almost instantly with the above ingredients. It's almost as fast and easy as prepackaged ramen noodles but with more nutritional substance. If you make a soup based around anchovies, bean paste, seaweed and tofu, that's like a heartier, Korean-style version of Japanese miso soup with tofu. \n\nThe long-shelf-life, no-refrigerate tofu helps make this instant powder based soup approach easy to take on the road for camping, or for an emergency food basis for quick pantry meals. With a bag of rice, some cases of no-refrigerate tofu, a few dozen eggs (which last forever in the refrigerator), and the above ingredients, I have at least one decent option for almost-instant pantry meals for a month if I get locked down. \n\nThese ingredients are available from sources other than Korean grocery stores, but they are much more expensive elsewhere (a case of 12 no-refrigerate tofu blocks is at least $10 less if you buy them a Korean store). So there's no reasonable alternative, yet, to getting in my car to go to a Korean store because it's massively more expensive to buy these ingredients in health food stores and online. You can see from the examples I linked, how expensive these are to get from sources other than a Korean store.\n\nThis might look like it's a way of making instant ramen from scratch. Well, yes and no. Instant ramen noodles are the least nutritious way to make an almost-instant Asian soup based on powdered pantry items, whereas you can go in a way more healthy direction while still staying very inexpensive, for an almost-instant soup/stew with very nutritious ingredients (seaweed, bean paste, anchovies, dried mushrooms, etc). And just from a basic stock of the above ingredients (plus about 3 cases of tofu) I could make practically instant nutritious meals for a month.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/fini7v/asian_stores_are_great_for_long_shelf_life/", "created_utc": 1584212449.0, "score": 5246, "author": "rhetorical_twix", "num_comments": 189, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/fini7v/asian_stores_are_great_for_long_shelf_life/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "3 Easy, Cheap, and Healthy Depression Meals", "selftext": "When I\u2019m depressed I often have a hard time motivating myself to cook, but ordering takeout gets expensive and leaves me feeling even worse. These are some tried and true depression meals that don\u2019t require you to chop anything, can be done in 15-30 minutes, and aren\u2019t too expensive. \n\nSpinach and egg scramble on toast. \n- Saut\u00e9 a few handfuls of spinach in a pan with some olive oil or butter and salt. \n- Whisk up 2-3 eggs in a bowl, optionally add some milk or shredded cheese if you have it and can make the effort. (If you are feeling especially miserable or want to avoid the dishes you can honestly crack the eggs directly into the pan and sprinkle cheese on top, it\u2019ll work.)\n- Toast whatever bread you have, whole grain is ideal for fiber and protein. Once it\u2019s toasted you can spread on some goat cheese, avocado, butter, cream cheese if that\u2019s your style - whatever you want to add some more creaminess or fat in a low effort way. If you have none of these things, it\u2019ll still taste good. \n- Serve your egg & spinach mixture on top of your toast and voila: you have a meal with a serving of vegetables, protein, fats, and carbs that took 15 minutes and didn\u2019t require you to chop anything. \n\nShakshuka (eggs poached in a cheesy/spicy tomato sauce). This is an incredible depression meal that deserves more attention. When I\u2019m not incredibly depressed I make a high effort version of this dish that people rave about but ya know...that\u2019s not always an option. \n- When I feel like crap I do the following: add some olive oil to a pan, smash and peel two garlic cloves and get them sizzling a bit in the olive oil but don\u2019t let them burn. \n- After about a minute I pour in a jar of basic tomato sauce (I have even done this with pizza sauce and it worked) and heat it through so it\u2019s bubbling. If you like spice you can add in some chili flakes. \n- Then I make four small indentations in the sauce and crack in 4 eggs. You can pop a lid on and cook it through on the stove or you can put it in the oven at 375 for 5-10 minutes. Watch the egg yolks - you want them to still be runny.\n- When the eggs are almost set I sprinkle some cheese liberally all over the top - feta, goat cheese, mozzarella, whatever, then put the lid back on to melt the cheese. \n- If you want to make an effort you can garnish with chopped cilantro, basil or scallions. \n- For extra credit you can add frozen spinach or kale to the sauce before you add in the eggs for extra veg that you can\u2019t really taste. \n- I eat this with a piece of toast or a pita. \n\nPeanut noodles. Slightly higher effort but cheaper than takeout and more filling than ramen. \n- I boil a handful of noodles from the Asian/International Cuisine aisle of my grocery store. There are tons of different types available and basically any wheat noodle or ramen style noodle works - ideally avoid using pasta. \n- When there\u2019s a minute left in the cook time in the noodles, add som sort of green veg like broccoli, green beans broken in half, edamame, etc. I choose green veg because I like the flavor and find you don\u2019t have to chop it (I will just tear broccoli florets apart and throw them in the water when I feel particularly shit.) \n- While it\u2019s cooking I make a sauce in whatever bowl I want to eat out of. The sauce is about 1 tbsp of smooth peanut butter, a spoonful or two of soy sauce, and some generous squirts of a hot sauce like sriracha or garlic chili sauce. \n- If I want to make the effort and have the ingredients I\u2019ll add a few drops of sesame oil, a splash of rice wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar but it\u2019s not necessary. \n- When the noodles and veg are cooked I drain them and add them directly to the bowl. Stir it up vigorously to coat all the noodles and veg in the sauce. \n- Garnish with scallions or cilantro if you can be bothered.

Once frothy, add the mushrooms and cook until all of the liquid releases and evaporates. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to cook the mushrooms in batches. Depending on the mushroom variety, this will take anywhere from 18\u201320 minutes.\n* Continue cooking until the mushrooms crisp up and take on a deep, golden color. If you cooked the mushrooms in batches, add all of them back to the pot and season with salt and pepper.\n\n## Cook the garlic:\n\n* Next, add the garlic cloves to the cooked mushrooms along with the dry thyme and cook until just fragrant.\n\n## Prepare the risotto:\n\n* Add the arborio rice to the pot of mushrooms and cook until it toasts slightly, about 2 minutes.\n* Begin adding the warm liquid in 1-cup increments, agitating the rice, and adding more liquid only after the rice has absorbed all the liquid in the pot. You'll need 5 to 7 cups and about 40 minutes of regular stirring. Turn off the heat once the risotto takes on a creamy texture and the rice is al dente. If using water, season the risotto liberally with salt and pepper. If using vegetable stock, you may not need as much salt.\n* Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.\n* Let the risotto rest off the heat for five minutes.\n\n## Finish the risotto:\n\n* Stir the juice from half a lemon into the risotto if you like. Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon wedges from the other half of the lemon. Enjoy!\n\n*\\*\\*I used one stalk of green garlic I found at the farmer's market, but regular garlic works just fine.*\n\n## Nutrition\n\nCalories: 262kcal | Carbohydrates: 46g | Protein: 5g | Fat: 7g | Saturated Fat: 2g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 2g | Monounsaturated Fat: 3g | Sodium: 68mg | Potassium: 283mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 2g | Vitamin A: 358IU | Vitamin C: 5mg | Calcium: 5mg | Iron: 2mg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/tvfufb/mushroom_risotto_is_my_goto_cheap_fancy_comfort/", "created_utc": 1649009988.0, "score": 4813, "author": "BushyEyes", "num_comments": 175, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/tvfufb/mushroom_risotto_is_my_goto_cheap_fancy_comfort/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Per ounce it may not the cheapest, but you can usually get a 16 ounce tub for 5 or 6 dollars and it lasts awhile. It's a great way to amp up fried rice, fried eggs, broths, and any saut\u00e9ed greens or roasted vegetables. You really only need a tablespoon or so for a dish, and it just imparts this great, subtle sweet flavor to any dish. I've used it as a base for my brothy beans, I've combined it with melted butter and made scrambled eggs with it.\n\nIf you're feeling stuck with cooking, this is a great thing to stick in your fridge and throw into recipes to change the flavor profile subtly.\n\nYou an add chicken or pork to this dish, but this is a veg-heavy fried rice! Here's the recipe!\n\n# Easy Miso Fried Rice\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\n\nCook Time: 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 40 minutes\n\nServings: 5\n\nCalories: 409kcal\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Large wok or wide pan\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Sauce:\n\n* 2 tablespoons rice cooking wine\n* 1-2 tablespoons soy sauce, or omit depending on saltiness preference. White miso is quit salty so adjust accordingly. \n* 1 tablespoon white miso paste\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil\n* 2 teaspoons sambal oolek or sriracha\n* 1 teaspoon chili oil optional\n* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 2 teaspoons ginger freshly minced\n\n## Fried Rice:\n\n* 3 cups cooked rice See Note\n* 2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil divided\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 2 teaspoons miso paste\n* 4 eggs beaten\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 8 ounces mushrooms (any variety) sliced\n* 4 cups mixed vegetables such as hakurei turnips cut into matchsticks, shredded napa cabbage, diced bell peppers, or carrots cut into matchsticks\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## Garnish (Optional)\n\n* Sesame seeds\n* Sliced scallion\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Prepare the Miso Butter:\n\n* Melt the butter in the microwave. Add the miso paste and gently mash it into a paste. Set aside.\n\n## Prepare the Sauce:\n\n* Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and whisk. Set aside.\n\n## Cook the Eggs:\n\n* Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in wide pan or wok over high heat. Once hot, add the eggs and half miso butter. Using a wooden spoon, break the eggs up quickly as they cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. It's okay if they aren't cooked all the way through.\n\n## Cook the Mushrooms and Onion:\n\n* Heat the remaining neutral oil in the skillet over high heat. Add the mushrooms and onion and cook, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until beginning to brown all over. Season lightly with salt. Remove from the pan.\n\n## Cook the Remaining Vegetables:\n\n* Add the remaining vegetables and cook in an even layer for 2 minutes. Stir and continue cooking for 4-5 minutes until softened but but still crisp. Return the cooked mushrooms and onions to the pan. Season very lightly with salt.\n* Add the remaining miso butter and toss to combine.\n\n## Add the Rice:\n\n* Add the cooled rice and egg to the skillet and toss gently to combine.\n\n## Pour in the Sauce:\n\n* Add the prepared sauce to the skillet and toss to coat. Cook for 2-3 minutes more until completely coated. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n## To Serve:\n\n* Divide the cooked rice between bowls and garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallion. Enjoy!\n\n## Notes\n\n*Note: Ideally, you would use leftover rice, but if you\u2019re pressed for time, simply transfer the freshly cooked rice to a bowl and place in the freezer for 10-15 minutes as you prepare the rest of the meal.*\n\n## Nutrition\n\nCalories: 409kcal | Carbohydrates: 52g | Protein: 14g | Fat: 17g | Saturated Fat: 5g | Cholesterol: 143mg | Sodium: 816mg | Potassium: 462mg | Fiber: 7g | Sugar: 2g | Vitamin A: 7724IU | Vitamin C: 18mg | Calcium: 75mg | Iron: 3mg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/lsaffz/white_miso_has_been_a_refrigerator_godsend_lately/", "created_utc": 1614270443.0, "score": 4748, "author": "BushyEyes", "num_comments": 226, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/lsaffz/white_miso_has_been_a_refrigerator_godsend_lately/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Get more $$$ out of your green onions!", "selftext": "My family hasn't bought green onions in years, and we eat them almost daily. How? Just plant the scraps.\n\nGreen onions are the most recyclable food from the grocery store. Literally all you do is take the bottom centimeter or so of the onion scrap (which you'd usually toss), let it sit in water for a bit until it's got some roots, and stick it in a pot'o'dirt\\*. They grow extremely fast and are super hardy (my kitchen counter barely gets any sunlight and they're still putting greens out like crazy). It's also a fast and easy growing project, when I moved out it only took me one trip to the store to start my own harvest up again. You know those scam ads that are like \"see results in 3 days\"? That's them onions, so good it seems fake.\n\n[Here's](https://www.allrecipes.com/article/save-money-diy-fresh-green-onions/) a good guide to regrowing them that's a bit more detailed.\n\n\\* you can just leave green onions in water and it will grow roots and green sprouts for a while (getting a few more bunches than you would had you thrown them out, regardless), but after a while it won't put out any more because it's run out of \"growing power\", like the nutrients it needs to grow. If you want a constant supply you have to root them in dirt eventually so they can get nutrients and continue to sprout, but if you don't eat them that often that you need a constant supply you can just let them sit in water after chopping the greens off and get a few more bunches.\n\nBonus Tip: If your green onions are looking a bit wilted and damaged from sitting in the bottom of your fridge for a week, just stick them in water overnight and they'll get green and plump again (as long as the roots are intact).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Okay so since this blew up a bit, here's some troubleshooting/tips for actually growing them:\n\n* When rooting in soil, don't use soil from outdoors. Soil from your yard is gonna be full of bad stuff (pesticides, pests, parasites, pollution, other plants) and none of the good (nutrients, minerals, nitrogen have already been used up by other plants). Get potting soil or gardening soil from a store or from another garden. This way your plant will grow and you're not eating any of the nasty from outdoors.\n* If you're not going to root them in soil and just leave them in water, the plants will get smaller and smaller, less concentrated in taste, and stop growing after a while. This is because plants need water and sunlight to survive, but nutrients (and sunlight) to grow. Without the nutrients from the soil it will use the ones it has stored up and keep growing for a bit, before it's all used up and can't grow anymore.\n* You can actually do this with a ton of veg from the store! Carrots will give you carrot greens, lettuce, bok choy, and cabbage will give you leaves (smaller and more bitter but still leaves), celery will give you celery (duh)  and more. Endless frugal possibilities!\n* when planting multiple in a container, space them around 4 inches apart, and 2 inches deep.\n* u/soayherder pointed out below, if growing plants from the grocery store don\u2019t plant into your garden, as they can carry diseases/fungi/nasties from where they were originally grown and destroy the natural soil ecosystem of your garden.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/goakfr/get_more_out_of_your_green_onions/", "created_utc": 1590113552.0, "score": 4697, "author": "Lyx_Chai", "num_comments": 300, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/goakfr/get_more_out_of_your_green_onions/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Soup is the ultimate cheap and healthy meal. Take anything you have, boil it in water, and time will do the rest!", "selftext": "I love soup. It's really hearty, and I like the contrast of drinking almost close to scalding hot soup and then experiencing the flavor profiles as it cools. Cold soup versus hot soup is a real thing. The flavor changes. \n\nI used to buy Costco roasted chicken, pry off all the chicken and freeze the bones. Do that two or three times and you'll amass enough bones. Or just go to your local butcher and ask for some throwaway bone marrow. Mine usually is never more than $1 a pound and sometimes the butcher throws in extra. Boil that with some vegetables or alone, and you'll get great stock, broth, or soup depending on what you add.  \n\n\nEven if you're not a meat-eater, some of the best soups I've enjoyed are vegetable-based. Here are some ideas. \n\nHonestly, take anything you have, and throw it in water, boil it for large amounts of time, and you'll end up with something nutritionally sound, tasty, and hearty. \n\nHere's one I used to make often!\n\n1 onion, chopped. \n\nCouple stalks of celery, sliced.\n\nCouple sticks of carrot, peeled and diced. \n\nChopped garlic, minced. \n\nSeasonings of any kind, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, Italian seasoning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust having vegetables and nothing else boil in large amounts of water, will give you something so tasty. And honestly, if you're vegan, it's probably even healthier for you too.   \n\n\nAdd cooked rice, quinoa, or barley to create more of a meal, but I usually drink it like that. If you have bacon, fry it up first before cooking and you'll get some nice flavor.\n\n  \nDried mushrooms are a staple in my culture, so we usually rehydrate and cook them with the liquid leftover when we do choose to make it.   \n\n\nIf you have cans of beans, use that for extra flavor. I love the starch that comes in cannellini beans or kidney beans. Chickpeas are a close second. The starch will thicken the soup. \n\nAdd tomato sauce if you want to color, (that's optional) but adds great flavor, or use an old looking tomato that isn't so pretty. Add some form of pasta, if you have it around to add a filler for a fuller meal.\n\nToday I boiled just some leftover carcass rotisserie bones and carrots, and the soup came out so lovely. \n\nThe possibilities are endless here, but bones or not, one vegetable too much or too little, boil the contents in your fridge away, and I'm sure you'll be surprised.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/im0xcm/soup_is_the_ultimate_cheap_and_healthy_meal_take/", "created_utc": 1599163214.0, "score": 4618, "author": "None", "num_comments": 296, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/im0xcm/soup_is_the_ultimate_cheap_and_healthy_meal_take/", "html_title": ""}

I'm here to deliver the sheets.\n\nI'm super type A and *hate* wasting produce or spending extra money, so I have a few key spreadsheets for meal planning. I was asked to share them to help people come up with their own spreadsheets.\n\nEven before COVID-19, I've tried to minimize my trips to the grocery store, but this type of organization has been super clutch for this time where running to the grocery store for one ingredient is *not cool.*\n\nEliminating waste helps my boyfriend and I eat pretty well despite making not much money. He's a giant man who needs 4k+ calories a day so being able to buy in bulk is a big deal. Between the two of us, we're usually eating almost 6k calories a day so if we don't plan it out, we can wrack up a *massive* grocery bill.\n\nFull disclosure: I posted the original comment on mobile and thought I was in xxfitness or something.

The spice list is organized with a stoplight system; green means we've got plenty, orange means it only has 2-3 meals left before needing to be replaced, red means we're completely out.

{"title": "I make an absurdly simple 1 pan chicken and rice. It's really cheap, looks somewhat fancy and it's so simple you can make it while totally hammered.", "selftext": "Apologies if double post; I think I accidentally broke a sub rule and my previous post got deleted. I can upload a picture if anybody is interested, but here's a really simple 1 pan chicken rice recipe. Very filling, super cheap, and pretty versatile, so if you don't have something it's all sweet. I have no idea if anybody is interested, but because of COVID I think we're all on the lookout for super simple ideas. \n\nSo here\u2019s the recipe:\n\n\nIngredients: \n\n\u2022\tChicken, preferably breast (optional)\n\n\u2022\tRice (literally any type, it doesn\u2019t matter)\n\n\u2022\tStock (can be substituted for water, but if you have the option, don't. I use a cheap stock powder)\n\n\u2022\tCooking oil (I used canola because it's cheaper)\n\n\u2022\tSpinach (optional)\n\n\u2022\tSultanas (optional)\n\n\u2022\tSalt and pepper (optional)\n\n\u2022\tChilli powder (optional)\n\n\u2022\tGarlic and ginger (both optional aromatics)\n\nMethod:\n\n\n1.\tChop your chicken into rough cubes. Heat up a tablespoon or three of oil on a frypan over medium heat. When it goes shimmery add the chicken and brown it until it\u2019s nice and golden. I use one chicken breast per hungry person. The type of chicken doesn\u2019t really matter; use whatever you have or whatever is cheapest. \n\n2.\tAbout 2 or 3 minutes before the chicken goes golden, add in your aromatics, like garlic and ginger (skip this step if you don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t have any). I used about 3 cloves of garlic and about the same amount of ginger; I really like those flavours though.\n\n3.\tLet it cook a little more to golden, if you time it right, the garlic and ginger will smell nice but not burn\n\n4.\tAdd in your rinsed rice; I used about a cup of rinsed white, long grain rice this time. The type of rice literally does not matter. Use whatever you have, or whatever\u2019s cheapest. Also add in your stock or water. I used about 1.5 cups of chicken stock, and then added water as needed\n\n5.\tBring it to a simmer, when you see bubbles, turn down the heat to low-medium and give it a good mix\n\n6.\tAt this point, add in salt, pepper and chilli if you\u2019re using it\n\n7.\tLet it cook on low-medium for about 15-20 minutes. Stir it every few minutes. If the rice is drinking all your stock, add small amounts of water.\n\n8.\tWhen the rice is cook, the chicken is cooked through, and it\u2019s about ready to eat, add in the sultanas and spinach, and mix through. In about 2 minutes the spinach should shrivel a little; that\u2019s when it\u2019s done. \n\n9.\tServe it up\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nIf you're using fattier cut of chicken like chicken like thigh, you might wanna cook it in a seperate pan, since apparently it leakes fat a lot. \n\nYou could probably make this vegetarian by using green beans and mushrooms instead of chicken. I've never done it myself. \n\nLiterally everything barring the rice and water is optional. Because this is a food I used to make when I was broke. I don't like \"simple\" recipes where everything hinges on something you probably don't have in your cupboard.\n\n\n\nEdit: \n\nJust wanted to say thanks for the comments guys.

One person mentioned that mint may not work well with this! Other solutions also include vacuum sealing them before freezing, drying herbs by leaving them hanging at room temperature for a few days, flash drying them in the microwave, putting them in a cup of water with a plastic sandwich bag over the top, or growing them yourself if that method is accessible to you. Another user had success with putting a dry, flat layer of herb in between paper towels, rolling that up, and storing the rolls in a ziploc bag in the fridge until needed. Also freezing as pesto in ice cube tray or freezing as an herb butter is an option, as well as making vegetable stock from herbs and other vegetable cuttings.

{"title": "TIP: Buy whole chicken - not chicken parts", "selftext": "Most posts in this subreadit are asking for advice. Instead, today I want to offer a tip that has worked really well for me:\n\nI stopped buying chicken breast or chicken wings. Instead, I buy whole chickens and I watched a few YouTube tutorials to learn how to cut the chicken myself. One whole chicken nets 2 breasts, 2 tenders, 4 wing pieces, 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and I use the leftover carcass and wing tips to make chicken broth, which yields soups or can be used to make rice. Every part of the chicken can be used for something.\n\nIn my local Walmart, whole chickens are around $1/lb while chicken breast and chicken tenders are $2 - $4/lb, thighs are $2.3 - $2.9/lb, drumsticks are $1.3 - $2.0 / lb, and wings are $4 / lb. Trust me, the weight of the backbone is not reason for the price difference. Chicken pieces cost more because you are paying someone else to cut them for you. Another factor is that in the US people have a strange preference for white meat (chefs prefer dark meat bc it's tastier) and that makes chicken breast in particular very expensive.\n\nIn my case, I've gone even further. I bought myself a $30 manual meat grinder and now I buy whole turkeys, cut out the meat, and I make my own ground meat. The whole turkey is $1 / lb here, while ground turkey meat is $3 / lb. I only use the turkey breast to make ground meat because it's very easy to cut. I eat the turkey legs separately (cooked in the oven), and I make broth with the remainder of the turkey.\n\nYou don't have to go as far as I did (i.e. meat grinding). Just learning to cut a chicken can slash your meat budget by a factor of 3; and for most of us, meat is the most expensive grocery.\n\nI hope this helps someone out there.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/rlpw69/tip_buy_whole_chicken_not_chicken_parts/", "created_utc": 1640125647.0, "score": 4307, "author": "Mighty-Lobster", "num_comments": 480, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/rlpw69/tip_buy_whole_chicken_not_chicken_parts/", "html_title": ""}

Then one fateful Christmas 2019 morning, there it is, under my pile of opened gifts. \nMy first thought was, \"why would I ever need this?\"\n\nWell let me tell you why I need this and why you need this as well.\n\nWant a single baked sweet potato in 15-20 minutes? Done.\nWant a single baked chicken breast or other portion of meat? Easy.\nWant to roast a small tray of veggies for yourself that will be good for only a couple days? Yessir. \nSeriously this thing is awesome. I've eliminated so much food waste from not over cooking and letting leftovers go to waste.

To everyone stating that all these things can be done in an oven: Yes. You're correct. \nThe benefits of the toaster oven are: \nA) Not heating up your whole house for the sake of a small meal (especially in the summer) \nB) Saving yourself on bills (and the planet) by using way less energy\nC) Reheating food quickly and easily without it getting soggy,\nD) Not having to wait for the preheat time on your oven (especially if your oven has a long preheat time).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jjaygx/do_yourself_a_favour_and_get_a_toaster_oven/", "created_utc": 1603835960.0, "score": 4248, "author": "Vanoice", "num_comments": 396, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jjaygx/do_yourself_a_favour_and_get_a_toaster_oven/", "html_title": ""}

When I moved out of my parents house at 20 not much changed. I just kept cooking, buying, and eating things I\u2019ve always known. Basically convenience foods. Vegetables? What are those?\n\nNow I\u2019m a couple years from 30 and my body has caught up with a lifetime of poor diet. \n\nI was watching a YouTube video today where a doctor tried different burgers to compare a beef burger to non beef alternatives in a blind test. At the end he basically said that after looking at the nutritional facts of them all, he wouldn\u2019t consider the non beef alternatives as \u201chealth food\u201d and suggested even the non beef burgers be eaten in the same way beef burgers are... as an indulgence. \n\nIndulgence. It\u2019s like it clicked for me. Most of the foods I eat regularly are foods normal, healthy people would consider indulging. Burgers, pizza, Chinese take out, tacos, pasta dishes, etc. \n\nBut when I tried to jump into google research I can\u2019t seem to find any help in learning what a normal healthy diet is suppose to look like in a day to day life. I know this changes based on location, and if that helps at all, I live in the Southeastern USA. \n\nI need some help. Can someone just throw some suggestions out about what should be eaten daily? Cooking isn\u2019t the problem for me, just basic knowledge of what to cook and what to eat is. How do I train my pallet to like more veggies and less processed foods?\n\nEdit: Wow. So many responses in such a short time. Kind of wish I posted this on my main account now but I was so embarrassed about this post. This community is so nice though, so thank you all so much. \n\nI am still reading through the comments but I want to point out a couple things that have come up. \n\n-I\u2019m female and my work isn\u2019t active. \n\n-I\u2019m not broke per se, but definitely not rolling in money, I just chose this subreddit because it seemed the one that made the most sense to post in. \n\n-To piggy back on the previous point, while seeing a nutritionist would be amazing, I live in a rural area, so there aren\u2019t any readily available at the grocery store or general physician\u2019s office. I am currently self employed (freelancing) and do not have any health insurance. Bummer for sure. \n\n-I briefly mentioned at the end of my post that cooking isn\u2019t a problem for me. What I mean is not only am I comfortable with cooking, I also have time to cook and actually kind of enjoy it. Meal prepping isn\u2019t something I\u2019m interested in just yet, but I appreciate the advice on how to meal prep and I\u2019ll probably use it one day. \n\nNow I just need to get on my computer and bookmark some of these amazing recipes, find a bargain for a pressure cooker and air fryer, and looking into some of these books. Maybe call around and find the nearest nutritionalist who isn\u2019t expensive without insurance. \n\nThank you all again!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/c2zh8u/almost_30_ive_been_eating_unhealthy_my_entire/", "created_utc": 1561054474.0, "score": 4246, "author": "obviouslynot-me", "num_comments": 649, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/c2zh8u/almost_30_ive_been_eating_unhealthy_my_entire/", "html_title": ""}

Obviously don't dump a whole bag of it in your broth, and if you are watching your sodium intake you should use it sparingly, but its not bad for you. \n\nMSG is an amazing way to make cheap and healthy soups taste restaurant quality, and is downright life changing when cooking vegetarian or vegan", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/psv3fz/in_praise_of_msg/", "created_utc": 1632267612.0, "score": 3983, "author": "petthesweatything", "num_comments": 681, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/psv3fz/in_praise_of_msg/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I\u2019ve started making my own corn tortillas and it\u2019s super cheap, convenient, and delicious", "selftext": "I used to think making corn tortillas was a daunting task and that I would need a tortilla press to get good results, but I\u2019ve had great results lately doing it like this:\n\n1. Mix up the masa harina and water according to the instructions on the back. I used 2 cups (240g) and 1.5 cup water.\n2. Take a small chunk off (I use about 36g of dough) and roll it into a ball.\n3. Take a piece of parchment paper that\u2019s at least twice as big as the tortilla you\u2019re making. Put the masa ball on the parchment and fold it over so it\u2019s covered on both sides.\n4. Use something heavy to press the tortilla from the top. I like to use a glass cooking dish because it lets me see how big the tortilla is and which spots are uneven.\n5. Make sure your pan is preheated on medium-high heat. Peel off the top layer of parchment carefully and then carry the bottom layer to the pan. Flip it over and carefully peel the tortilla off into the pan.\n6. Cook for 30 seconds on each side, turning it three times for a total of one minute per side (this is from the instructions on the masa package).\n7. Let the tortillas sit for a minute or two before you try to eat them so they become soft and pliable.\n\nI\u2019ve realized that the masa dough stores well in the fridge, so I\u2019ll mix up a big batch, keep it in the fridge, and then break some off whenever I want a fresh tortilla. I\u2019ve seen it recommended to not store the dough for more than three days, so you may only want to make enough to last you that long. I also reuse the parchment multiple times. I\u2019m not sure how long that\u2019s considered safe, but I just use it until it starts to look too gnarly.\n\nA $2.50 bag of masa harina will make 132 tortillas which is especially convenient now because you don\u2019t want to have to go to the grocery store more than you have to. It\u2019s also 3-4x cheaper than any store bought corn tortillas and the flavor/texture is 10x better in my opinion.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/g6kvde/ive_started_making_my_own_corn_tortillas_and_its/", "created_utc": 1587640805.0, "score": 3916, "author": "dna42zz9", "num_comments": 191, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/g6kvde/ive_started_making_my_own_corn_tortillas_and_its/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I learned about an Italian 'peasant' dish called Riso al Forno...it's basically baked rice/risotto, and it's so good, pretty easy to make, and makes a ton so it's perfect for meal prep.", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/E5Jrw3I.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/E5Jrw3I.jpg)\n\nRecipe here originally: [Riso al Forno](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/riso-al-forno-baked-risotto/) \n\nI don't know if this would interest anyone here, but I made lasagna last weekend, and I guess I thought I needed enough mozzarella for an army. I couldn't bear the thought of more lasagna so I started reading and I found out about *riso al forno*. There aren't a TON of recipes out there for it and a lot of them are in Italian, but I decided to give it a go. I don't think this is meant to have the super creamy consistency of risotto (I could be wrong; if anyone has any info on this dish, I'd love to be corrected!)\n\nIf you don't have arborio rice, I think you could still make something similar, just use 6 cups of cooked short-grain rice.\n\nThe basic premise is you parboil arborio rice and toss it with oil and/or parmesan cheese. One recipe also suggested letting the rice cool down *completely* and then tossing it with 2 whisked eggs which is a great alternative to the cheese.\n\nThen you basically layer it in a casserole dish... rice, homemade sauce, cheese, and then rice, sauce, cheese, and then bake for 25\u201330 minutes or until the rice is tender. You can use a mix of parmesan, provolone, or mozzarella or I bet you could even skip the cheese completely if you wanted to.\n\nIt's basically like lasagna but with rice. I thought it turned out really good so I thought I'd share the recipe here.\n\nI made a homemade meat sauce, but feel free to disregard that and just use \\~6 cups of your favorite sauce. Marinara or a meat sauce would both be great in this.\n\nRecipes I've seen online suggest that you could add cured meat to this or a layer of thinly sliced hardboiled eggs too. One lady added eggplant and peppers to hers and that looked really good. I've also seen it suggested to toss your parboiled rice with a ladle of the sauce too before layering.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 2 cups arborio rice\n* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 cup shredded parmesan cheese divided (or omit, it's not totally necessary)\n* 1 teaspoon neutral oil\n* 2 pounds ground meat of choice (beef, sausage, pork, turkey, or a mix)\n* 2 tablespoons butter plus more for greasing the casserole dish\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more to taste\n* \u00bd teaspoon dry thyme\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* 3 15-ounce cans crushed tomatoes\n* 1 teaspoon sugar optional\n* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese divided\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Parboil the arborio rice:\n\n* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 10 minutes. Drain and rinse under very cold water. Once the rice is cool to the touch, transfer it to a large bowl with 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil. Add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and toss to coat. Set aside.\n\n## Brown the meat:\n\n* Add 1 teaspoon neutral oil to the second large pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the meat and use a wooden spoon to break them up as they cook\u2014season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking for 12\u201315 minutes until the meat browns and is mostly cooked through. Transfer to a bowl.\n\n## Cook the sauce aromatics:\n\n* Melt the butter into the pot used to brown the meat. Once bubbly, add the onion and cook for 6\u20138 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic, crushed red pepper, and thyme and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n## Simmer the sauce:\n\n* Add the tomato paste and mash it into the aromatics. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color. Add the canned tomatoes and stir to incorporate. Add the sugar, if you like. Add the cooked meat to the sauce and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking.\n\n## Assemble the rice:\n\n* Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n* Grease a 12\u00d78 baking dish with butter.\n* Add half of the parboiled arborio rice to the dish and use the back of your spoon to flatten it into an even layer. Next, ladle over half the sauce and spoon it into an even layer over the rice. Next, add half the shredded mozzarella cheese and half of the remaining grated parmesan (if using). Add the remaining rice and then the sauce. Finish the casserole with the remaining mozzarella and remaining parmesan cheese.\n\n## Bake the rice:\n\n* Transfer to the preheated oven for 25\u201335 minutes. Check the rice at 25 minutes and continue baking until tender.\n\n## Broil the rice (optional):\n\n* Once the rice is tender, drizzle with 1\u20132 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil and transfer to the broiler for 1\u20132 minutes until the cheese bubbles and turns deep golden brown.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Allow the riso al forno to set out at room temperature for 5\u201310 minutes.

Let's say a recipe calls for a cup of coconut milk - I will take a half cup of the yogurt and mix/whisk it with a half cup of water until it's a nice smooth/creamy consistency, and then add that in place of coconut milk in the recipe. I have now tried this with four different curry recipes and it has turned out terrific every time.\n\nThought this might be a useful tip for anyone who is allergic to coconuts or just isn't into the flavor/added calories.\n\nEdit: Lots of people are pointing out that yogurt is a common ingredient in curries... I honestly did not know that, which makes sense because I don't cook a lot of Indian curries.

And only had 1/2 lb of beef from the freezer\n\n**Other**\n\n[Cinnamon Rolls](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/best-cinnamon-rolls/)\\- I got on the COVID lockdown baking wagon.

I thought I might give an update on my (bit of) success.\n\nMy food bills are down to around $250 a month. I have taken a lot of recommendations from that post, and have reduced my fast food to twice a week (breakfast and dinner on Fridays). I know it's not perfect, but believe me, it's a huge improvement from where I was before.\n\nI took a lot of your home-cooking suggestions, and now have actual fresh vegetables and a bit of meat in my fridge. I'm not making healthy meals every night, because if my brain had to decide between McDonalds, pizza rolls, and a healthy home cooked meal - it wants the McDonalds lol, but I have managed to instead go with pizza rolls on those days. I am slowly upping my skill with cooking to phase this out though.\n\nI have started prepping breakfasts for the week on Sundays so I don't grab breakfast on the way, and I now have a snack bag at work so I don't get tempted by fast food on the way home. So I just need to work on prepping lunch and dinner more now (I have instant meals at work at the moment, but I've been experimenting with freezer prep).\n\nI'd like to thank everyone who commented on my post a year ago, and I appreciate that it was all supportive and really trying to help me with this problem.

{"title": "Chili. High protein, low carb, generally low calorie, low cost.. where have you been all my life?", "selftext": "I do meal prep Sundays and am on a high protein/kinda low calorie diet. I usually cook a bunch of chicken to eat throughout the week in various forms, but still needed protein shakes/bars to hit my goals. \n\nA few weeks ago I decided to make a pot of chili. I did it while I'm prepping my marinade, marinating and what not. I had generally made chili in the slow cooker which I now think is kind of a waste of time when it can be done so quickly on the stove.\n\nHoly smokes. For such little effort, you can have loads of healthy, high protein, low calorie, entirely customizable food to eat all week!\n\nMy last batch consisted of:\n\n*  2 lbs 90% lean ground beef\n\n*  1 can chickpeas\n\n*  1 can pinto beans\n\n*  1 can black beans\n\n*  2 10oz cans rotel\n\n*  3oz tomato paste\n\n*  1 small can diced jalapenos\n\n*  1 whole yellow onion\n\n*  1 green bell pepper\n\n*  1 red bell pepper\n\n*  3 tbsp pre minced garlic (I know, I know)\n\nEdit:\n\n*  Forgot I squeezed half a lime into it and also poured like 1/4-1/2 the lager I was drinking in there. Otherwise, No liquid necessary although it's a thick, chunky chili which is how I like it!\n\nSpices: Cumin, chili powder, oregano, smoked paprika, cayenne, fresh cracked salt and pepper.\n\nThe list seems long, but seriously, **all you do is chop an onion and two bell peppers, then it's all opening cans.**\n\nThe little amount of work for so much tasty and healthy food kinda blows my mind. \n\nI fill five smallish tupperwares with chili to grab and go for a 10 AM breakfast at work. Have a smallish cup of chili during lunch with my main dish (chicken sandwich, lately). Last night for dinner I chopped up one of my pre-cooked chicken breasts and put it on a salad, with a side soup of.. chili! \n\nIf you lift or exercise at all, protein is very important for rebuilding torn muscles and other functions. \n\n**Customization:**\n\nIf you don't like ground beef or want a more lean meat, you can sub it for turkey or chicken (chicken has that protein boost as well).  [Here](https://www.budgetbytes.com/weeknight-black-bean-chili/) is a great turkey blackbean chili that's even more simple to do. I did this one two weeks ago. \n\nYou can do 3 beans, one bean or no bean! I've made a three meat chili that just had ground beef, cubed chuck roast and ground pork. No beans about it. I personally prefer beans for their own health benefits you don't get from meat. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to share this for any meal preppers out there!\n\nEdit to add: this is a pretty meat heavy chili, which is how I like it. You can do this same recipe with 1lb, 1.5lb or 2lb ground beef depending on how much you like. Just change your amount of seasoning appropriately! :D\n\n**Edit 2: Some people have pointed out this isn't \"low carb\" because of all the beans and they are right. It's hard for me to lump complex carbs and processed carbs together, so when I think carbs I usually think bread/processed grains/chips etc.**\n\n**What you can do about that is: don't add beans! Or just add chickpeas, or just pinto beans, or black beans! Just one can. It will still be fine without them, just even more meaty. A way to fluff it up and keep it low carb is to add more of another kind of meat (breakfast/italian sausage, chuck roast cubed into 1in cubes, chicken). Sorry for the misinformation on the carb department. Also, you can dice up some mushrooms! Personally, I still think this recipe is a little on the low to mid range carb wise since it's mostly meat, haha**\n\nEdit 3: just adding more good ideas: if you get bored with it, you can make it into a quesadilla! Slap some on a tortilla and put some shredded cheese on there. Boom!\n\nAnother edit: someone PMd me for instructions and since I typed it all out on my phone, figured I\u2019d post it here:\n\nDice the yellow onion and green and red pepper. Set aside. \n\nPut 2 tbsp olive oil into a large pot and heat on medium. As the diced onion and garlic. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Add beef and red and green pepper.  Stir occasionally until meat is browned. This should only take ten minutes or so. \n\nWhile this is going on, start opening cans. And if you want and aren\u2019t drinking already, open a beer. \n\nAdd the rotel, jalape\u00f1os, beans, tomato paste.. just like everything that was in the cans I guess. \n\nNow seasonings: \n\n1.5 tbsp cumin\n\n1 tbsp chili powder\n  \n1-2 tsp oregano\n\n1-2 tsp smoked paprika\n\n1/2 tsp cayenne\n\n12-15 cranks cracked salt and pepper \n\nLet me know if I forgot one something. \n\nSplash a little beer in there. Squeeze lime in there if you have some. \n\nDo you have any ingredients left? Let me know. They should probably be in the pot by now though! \n\nStir occasionally so it doesn\u2019t burn to the bottom of the pot. Let simmer for like, 1-2 hours on low-med heat after cooking on med for like ten-15 minutes. \n\nServe immediately or let cool in the fridge overnight and eat it all week! It\u2019s tastier the next day imo\n\n**FINAL EDIT**: I've gotten SO MANY awesome tips in this thread! It intentionally was just meant to be an FYI about how well chili lasts a week and is a good meal for a sunday prep, I never intended to even add a recipe and only added my last one on a whim. I can't wait to try all the tips you've given! \n\nThanks, chili bros!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/b8ljrm/chili_high_protein_low_carb_generally_low_calorie/", "created_utc": 1554222958.0, "score": 3298, "author": "DothrakAndRoll", "num_comments": 390, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/b8ljrm/chili_high_protein_low_carb_generally_low_calorie/", "html_title": ""}

Using a masher will do but using a grater will get fluffier gnocchi.\n\n2. Whisk an egg and add into the potatoes. If you are using freshly boiled potatoes, make sure they are cool first or the egg will scramble.\n\n3. Add in the flour and salt and knead into a non-sticky dough. No water is needed. You can sprinkle more flour to bring it together if your potatoes are wetter.\n\n4. When it comes together, divide the dough into smaller parts and shape it as you like. To learn how to make the quintessential gnocchi shape, please watch the video since its hard to put into words.

{"title": "Eggs in ice cube trays", "selftext": "\nWent to the store today, and discovered the price of eggs has dropped by 30%. So I came home with a few dozen. \n\nWhen I was a kid, we froze eggs all the time. While I was doing mine, I realized that people don't do that much anymore, but it's really convenient if you buy farm eggs, or you want to take advantage of sales. So I thought I'd share. \n\nEggs will keep up to 1 year in the freezer this way.  \n\nCrack and separate all your eggs. Whites in one bowl. Yolks in another. \n\nBeat the whites together. In a clean ice cube tray, measure two tablespoons of egg white into each section. \n\nAdd salt to the yolks and beat together. (1/2 tsp salt for every 1 cup yolks, a dozen eggs is ~3/4 cup of yolk). In a clean ice cube tray, measure one tablespoon yolk into each section. \n\nYour average ice cube tray holds about 2 tablespoons per section, so egg white sections should be full, egg yolk sections should be half full. \n\nFreeze. \n\nTransfer to ziplock freezer bags, or your favorite freezer container. \n\nTo thaw, place overnight in the fridge. \n\nWhen using, 1 cube egg white (2 tablespoons) and i cube egg yolk (1 tablespoon) equals one large egg. \n\nNote about the salt: It keeps the yolks from getting gummy. Most recipes won't be affected by a bit of extra salt, but if you are using for baking you can substitute sugar. You need 5 tsps. sugar to every 1 cup egg yolks.

The more autopilot putting together a snack can be, the more likely Kiddo is to go into the kitchen, get food, and then actually eat it.\n\nQuick aside: we ARE feeding her regular meals, she eats with us and is slowly becoming more comfortable in the process of cooking with us. This isn\u2019t a feed-yourself-or-starve household, the only food scarcity that could happen is between Kiddo and her own demons. \n\nWe\u2019re trying to build her confidence and ability to feed herself independently of meal times.

{"title": "If you make slow cooker beans, don't waste the \"stock\" when you strain your beans, save it to make healthier, tastier rice!", "selftext": "I make a couple pounds worth of dry beans in the slow cooker once or twice a week and for a long time I wasn't sure what to do with all the excess liquid not absorbed by the beans at the end of the 8ish hours, and it felt like such a waste to let it be washed down the drain, so I used to just store the beans in the liquid and sort of let them marinate in the fridge over the course of the next week as I used up the beans. This was good from a flavor perspective because with each day that the beans sat in the stock they became more and more infused with the onion, garlic, bay leaf and other flavors in the stock but it resulted in rather soggy beans which wasn't optimal for when I wanted to make nice and crispy tostadas or create a burrito that wouldn't be saturated with excess moisture. So I started straining my beans and saving the stock for the next time I made brown rice in the rice cooker. Normally my rice cooker calls for about 1.75 cups of water for every cup of brown rice but through some experimentation I've found that using a 1 cup of water: 1 cup of bean stock: 1 cup of brown rice in my rice cooker creates rice that has much more flavor in it, as well as protein and other nutrients. The rice is an excellent compliment to the beans and it allows you to waste less and save money, an all around win!\n\nEdit: I personally only make black and pinto beans and I soak and strain them prior to using them in the slowcooker, I don't use the water that the beans were initially soaked in.

I was amazed at how luxe it tasted even without the meat and you only need a few ingredients. It was super filling!\n\n# COST:\n\nCost breakdown for core ingredients (will vary depending on location and doesn't incl. dry spices or oil):\n\n* Potatoes, 2 lbs: $2.00 ($.99/pound)\n* Plant-based cream or coconut cream: $1.99 *(Can also use flour + milk to save on cost)*\n* Mushrooms: $8.68\n* Chickpeas: $1.58\n* Butter: \\~$.31\n* Dijon mustard: \\~$.30\n\nTotal: $14.84\n\n***Total per serving: Approx. $3.71***\n\n**NOTE!** This is for a vegan project I'm working on which is why you'll see plant-based butter and cream noted below. I used plant-based butter made from beans which is awesome!!\n\nYou can use dairy equivalents for the cream or butter! To keep it on the healthier side, I'd use 2 teaspoons of flour and 4 ounces of whole milk in place of dairy-based heavy cream to get a thick sauce without so much saturated fat.\n\n# INGREDIENTS:\n\n* 2 pounds Yukon gold or russet potatoes, peeled and cubed\n* 1 cup plant-based heavy cream or use coconut cream or your favorite dairy milk/cream\n* 2 tablespoons plant-based butter, divided\n* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, optional\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 1/2 pound mushrooms, a mix of cremini, oyster, or shiitake\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 2 15-ounce cans of chickpeas, or 3 cups of home-cooked chickpeas from dry\n* 3 tablespoons Dijon mustard ( Used a blend of whole grain and Dijon, but you can use all Dijon)\n* 1 cup water\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Microgreens, optional, for serving\n\n# METHOD\n\n## Boil the potatoes:\n\n* Cover the diced potatoes with water and salt liberally. Bring to a boil and then cook for 20 minutes or until fork-tender. Scoop out 1/4 cup of the starchy potato water and then drain the potatoes.\n\n## Prepare the mashed potatoes:\n\n* Transfer the drained potatoes to a large bowl and add half of the heavy cream, butter, salt, and white pepper. Mash with a potato masher until smooth. If the potatoes need to be thinned out, add the starchy water in tablespoon increments until desired consistency is met. If you like them even creamier, add more heavy cream\u2014taste and season to your preferences.\n\n## Prepare the mushrooms and chickpeas:\n\n* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook in an even layer. You want them to release liquid and for the liquid to evaporate fully. Cook them in batches, if needed. It will take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes to fully brown and crisp up the mushrooms. Only turn the mushrooms once every 3\u20135 minutes.\n\n## Simmer the Dijon sauce:\n\n* Once the mushrooms have browned well, season with salt, pepper, and dry thyme, add the chickpeas, and toss to coat. Create a well in the middle of the skillet and add the mustard and let it sizzle for 30 seconds. Pour water into the mustard, whisk until smooth, and then toss to coat the chickpeas and mushrooms with the liquid.\n* Add the remaining heavy cream and bring it to a low boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes\u2014taste and season once more to your preferences.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Divide the mashed potatoes between shallow bowls and pile the Dijon mustard and chickpeas on top. Garnish with microgreens, if you like.

{"title": "Just a few tips for stretching your food budget.", "selftext": "Here are a few things that have worked well for me to save money on groceries in the US, aside from the well-known \"beans, rice, and tortillas are your friends.\"\n\n\n1. Price compare at the Dollar Tree, or other $1 stores. \nThe Dollar Tree is often brushed off as being gross or having inferior products, and that can be true if you buy the wrong items. But when you compare the price by ounce on staples to grocery stores, you can save a lot of money. Cheese, jasmine rice, spices, and frozen pot pies are a few things that mine stocks that are definitely worth it. Just be sure to check the ingredients so you aren't buying a mock product, and compare prices using the app for your default grocer. Other items such as coffee, cereal, soup, etc. aren't worth it, so be mindful not to impulse buy.\n\n\n2. Check out ugly produce subscription boxes.\nWe eat a ton of vegetables. I recently signed up for one of those food waste prevention boxes that send you produce \"unfit\" for store shelves. The one I signed up for also has an option for permanent low-income discounts, and you can stack other coupons on top of that, so for my first order, I got $35 worth of veggies for $15, and it got me through two weeks. With my delivery schedule happening on the odd weeks of the month, I now spend about $30 a month on produce, including shipping. (If you're interested in Imperfect Foods specifically, send me a DM and I can give you a referral code. You can use your 2020 tax return to get the permanent 20% discount if you qualify.)\n\n\n3. Only buy unavailable pantry necessities at your large chain. \nSome things you simply won't find anywhere else, so if you can't live without it, pick it up at Kroger, Walmart, Aldi, etc.\n\n\n4. If you can help it, refrain from buying meat altogether. \nMeat is hugely expensive over time and we tend not to notice because we assume we need it. It's fine to treat yourself, but consider removing it from your regular shopping list if you can.\n\n\n5. Learn to make food from waste.\n\nSave your onions, carrots, celery, and other non-cruciferous vegetable trimmings in a gallon bag in your freezer. Once it's full, toss half of it (1/2 bag makes 1 batch of stock, about 6 cups) in a pot with some oil to let the veggies roast. Add salt and pepper. Add plenty of water. Let it simmer until it's a deep brown, then strain the solid pieces for a delicious homemade veggie stock you can store in Tupperware in the freezer. It's awesome to use with other recipes.\n\nFlour is indispensable. Learn to make seitan, and instead of throwing out the starch water byproduct, make noodles out of it. You can get 2-3 meals from 3 cups of flour. \n\nHeavy whipping cream is so versatile. It's expensive, but since you can also use it to make spreadable butter or sour cream, it's definitely worth it in my opinion.\n\nKeep your broccoli and cauliflower trimmings in the freezer, including even the toughest stalks and the leaves. Boil them and cut them into small pieces once you're ready to make a cheddar soup that will give Panera a run for its money.\n\n\n6. As always, don't be afraid to check out local food pantries. They're there for people like us. Be sure to research them online first so you have everything you need to know before showing up, as different pantries have different requirements.\n\nAs is, I spend about $60/month on groceries, down from around $140/month last year\u2014plus I'm eating better. I hope these tips are helpful for someone!\n\nEdit: I'm totally overwhelmed by the response this got. I'll try to keep responding to DMs and questions. I'd also like to say that none of these are hard, fast rules, obviously\u2014these just worked for me, and you should pick and choose any tips or suggestions here and in the comments that may help you. I wish y'all the best of luck! \ud83d\udc95\n\nEdit #2: As of 8/17, I believe the reduced cost box is no longer 20% off, but is now 15% off. I received an email from Imperfect alerting me of this change and wanted to inform others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/oxrhow/just_a_few_tips_for_stretching_your_food_budget/", "created_utc": 1628079638.0, "score": 2871, "author": "spakoosky", "num_comments": 441, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/oxrhow/just_a_few_tips_for_stretching_your_food_budget/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I used red lentils for my meatballs for the first time and I'm officially hooked!", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eyyncazx4le61.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4efa6f4f51d483b778d7e1557059e01bef33d428\n\n**Recipe here originally:** [**Easy Red Lentil Meatballs**](https://triedtruerecipe.com/RedLentilMeatballs)\n\nI've never really done this before but since I had a bag of red lentils that I haven't touched in forever, I decided to try it out tonight.\n\nMy initial thoughts...they take less time than ground beef meatballs, cleanup is easier, and they're waaaay cheaper than ground meat. While they certainly don't taste like beef or have the same texture as ground meat, they're **definitely** a viable option if you're craving something similar to meatballs. That said, if you take them for what they are....cute little fried balls of lentils, you'll love them.\n\nI made a sort of Turkish-style meatball but you could do this for any flavor of meatball you like.\n\nIngredients:\n\nMakes: A lot of meatballs, lol, probably like 30\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 16 ounces  dry red lentils\n* 1 shallot, peeled and minced\n* 1 tablespoon dry parsley\n* 2 tablespoons chili powder\n* 2 teaspoons garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds (lightly crushed between your fingers)\n* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* For vegan meatballs, use 2 tablespoons vegan mayo\n* For non-vegan meatballs, use 2 eggs\n* 2/3 cup panko or breadcrumbs\n* Optional: 1/4 cup crushed nuts, like walnuts, pistachio, cashew, or peanuts...this just adds a bit of fattiness to the meatball that I like, but it's not necessary if you want to save on costs.\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Bring a medium pot of water (4-5 cups) to boil over high heat. Add the lentils and reduce heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes until  almost completely soft. Drain and rinse under cold water.\n2. In a bowl, combine the shallot, parsley, chili powder, garlic powder, cumin seeds, crushed red pepper, panko, and mayo (or eggs) and use a spoon to combine. Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.\n3. Add the rinsed lentils to the bowl and use a wooden spoon or your hands to combine the mixture until it is doughy. It shouldn't be too wet or too crumbly. If it seems too wet, add a bit more panko...if it's too dry, add a bit more mayonnaise or a little oil. Taste and season again with salt and pepper.\n4. Scoop out a heaping tablespoon of the mixture and roll it into a meatball and continue on with the rest of the mixture until all of the meatballs are formed.\n5. Heat oil in wide pot over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook for 2-3 minutes per side. You want to turn very gently...i usually use the edge of my tongs to release the meatball and turn it gently. Continue cooking until all the meatballs are browned and cooked through. Keep the meatballs warm in the oven at 200\u00baF as you fry the rest of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI served this with golden cauliflower puree which is just a head of chopped cauliflower boiled until soft and then pureed with turmeric, paprika. salt, pepper, and yogurt, butter, and a little milk!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/l93e0d/i_used_red_lentils_for_my_meatballs_for_the_first/", "created_utc": 1612063675.0, "score": 2834, "author": "BushyEyes", "num_comments": 123, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/l93e0d/i_used_red_lentils_for_my_meatballs_for_the_first/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "My grandmothers' nutmeg lemon chicken. Literally my favourite meal of all time. Still.", "selftext": "I make this about once a fortnight, and have for the past fifteen years. Seriously.  \n\n\nHere I'll lay out the whole thing, but at the **top** here I'll add a **TL;DR** because it's actually really simple:  \n\n\n1. Blonde roux  \n2. Add chicken stock to make sauce  \n3. Add nutmeg/lemon to taste (1/4tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp salt to start - adjust from there)  \n4. Heat through chunks of chicken  \n5. Pour everything over rice. I use basmati because it's amazing and you can buy 10kg bags of it that last you at least 6 months for like $25.00.  \n\n\n**UTENSILS**\n\nLarge stock pot\n\nSmall-medium frying pan\n\nBalloon whisk\n\n2x stirring spoon\n\n1x wooden spoon\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**STOCK**  \n8x Maryland pieces. (I buy chicken maryland. On special, it's about $3.00/kg.)  \n8x thigh fillets (I buy these when they're on special at about $8/kg)  \n2x med carrots, chopped roughly (but must be down centre)  \ncouple of stalks of celery. Not the ultra green ones, just like somewhere in the middle but really, whatever.  \n1x large onion, ugly chop. No skin.  \n4L of water\n\n**ROUX (THEN SAUCE)**\n\nFlour (Self-raising or plain, doesn't matter at all\\_  \nSalted/unsalted butter (doesn't matter at all - no, you can't use margarine or oil)  \nGround nutmeg  \n1/2 lemon (you won't need more than this for 1-2 servings)\n\nSalt (but add it last)\n\n**TO MAKE STOCK**\n\nAll stock ingredients in a pressure cooker, boil for 15 mins. DIscard skin on chicken maryland. Discard bones. If only thigh fillets were used, heyyyy good work but you dn't have that classic boney taste that just can't be replicated. Also much less cheap if you're not using the marylands. Don't drain off all the fat. You can remove some but leave most- it's got that strong chickeny flavour you want to keep. Also, KJ's.\n\n**TO MAKE ROUX**\n\nButter, melt. shake in flour very slowly, whisk until flour/butter mix forms thick, clumpy floury roux. doesn't have to be heavy on butter - just cook slower than normal until the clods of buttery flour start taking on a nutty smell. The aim is to 'cook out' the flour. You can generally 'smell the nuttiness' after about 60-80 seconds on low-med heat. Clumsy? Yeah. Perfect? Hell no. Achieves the same result? For most intents and purposes, yes it does. And that stock will be slightly fattier than normal so there's a bit of fat in the stock.\n\n**TO MAKE SAUCE**  \nAdd stock a good splash at a time, then stir MADLY to ensure no clumps. Will form elastic looking dough - this is how you know to add more stock.  \nDo this until a thin but viscous sauce is created. Taste NOW for salt - it will need it.\n\n**DUMP IN CHICKEN PIECES FROM STOCK**  \nAs written. Dump in chicken pieces, warm through on ultra low, pour over rice. You won't even believe how good it is.\n\n**WHAT MY DAD DID**  \nHe made it richer with an egg yolk - remove one ladel of sauce, semi-cool it, whisk in an egg yolk to the lukewarm sauce, SLOWLY whisk back into the rest of the hot sauce to prevent cooking it. Add a dash of cream as well. For me? Too rich. I never bothered.\n\n**A WORD ON THE EVER-PRESENT GARLIC**\n\nDon't add garlic. Just for once in your life, try a dish that doesn't have garlic added to it. No garlic. Just don't. Yes, garlic's great, but it's in everything.  Try something without it for a bloody change. Also garlic's mad expensive and garlic salt / garlic powder is just so commonly used it makes everything taste more or less the same.\n\n**TL:DR (AGAIN)**\n\nRoux, stock, make sauce. Add nutmeg, lemon juice, salt. Taste. Happy? Good - add chicken pieces, warm through, pour over rice. That's it.\n\n\n**NEED MORE?**\n\nFreeze stock with the chunks of chicken in it from the stock. That way, when you want to make this again (and you will), you just defrost one of these stock containers, make the roux, pour in the stock to make the sauce, shake in the nutmeg/lemon, dump in chicken.\n\n**TOTAL?**\n\nMaybe $3.05/serve. Cost varies widely depending on price of veggies and chicken, but assuming all veggies are crisper dwellers and you've dragged some chicken thighs out of the permafrost from 2019, this can be as cheap as $1.85/serve. For me the most expensive thing here is the nutmeg at $3.05/jar beacuse I have a lemon tree but for you it could be the lemons. You could put this in front of any dinner guest and they'd be impressed.  \n\n\nNB: These are all Australian prices.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/lel9ol/my_grandmothers_nutmeg_lemon_chicken_literally_my/", "created_utc": 1612699498.0, "score": 2777, "author": "TuringCapgras", "num_comments": 179, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/lel9ol/my_grandmothers_nutmeg_lemon_chicken_literally_my/", "html_title": ""}

It tastes best after a few hours of sitting, especially on an airy roll. I got this from a fantastic cook book called Dirty Gourmet.\n\n* Tear up a couple leaves of kale and put it in a small bowl\n* Squeeze half a lemon over the kale and zest that sucker\n* Add parmesan, extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper to the lemony kale and coat\n* Smash 1/2 an avocado on each size of the bread you're using\n* Put the kale mix on one side of the bread and put the other on top, you're done!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gr1rft/just_want_to_share_what_i_eat_every_day_pretty/", "created_utc": 1590515096.0, "score": 2724, "author": "MrMagistrate", "num_comments": 214, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gr1rft/just_want_to_share_what_i_eat_every_day_pretty/", "html_title": ""}

When the starter is about to overfill use a bunch of it as pancake batter. **You don't even need to mix anything extra into it!** Just pour the starter onto hot butter in the pan, and cook it like you would any normal pancake.\n\nThe pancakes taste AMAZING. It has a tangy sourdough taste, and that combined with the crisp from the frying plus an extra little dollop of butter on the plate makes it sing. I think I prefer it to regular pancakes now.\n\n**This is basically free food.** Why? Because a single bag of flour will last MONTHS as feed for the sourdough, and fermentation process does the batter \"mixing\" for you!

Here is my recipe book of cheap meals that kept me alive as a poor student", "selftext": "**Heres all the recipes that have kept me alive as a student for minimal cost and maximum happiness.**\n\nMost of these make more portions than 1, but scale everything appropriately. Soup makes about 3, curry and chicken is for 1-2, and paella is for 2-3\n\n**Chinese chicken soup** :\n\nbring pan to boil, then add 1 teaspoon of chinese 5 spice, and 1 chicken stock cube. Dissolve the spices.\n\nadd 1 chicken breast, then simmer on low for 25 minutes\nremove chicken onto plate, then shred with forks\n\nadd chicken back into pan, then add frozen peas, spinach, green (spring) onions, and mushrooms.\n\nadd soy sauce to taste.\n\n**Curry** :\n\ndice (ie chop into very small bits) an onion\n\nget frying pan with some oil, then gently fry onions for 5-10 minutes until the whiteness is turned into translucence\n\ndice (make into cubes about the size of a dice) 1 chicken breast, and add to frying pan\n\nadd 1-2 tablespoon of ready-mixed curry powder. If you want to do this yourself the spice mix I use is 1 tsp of each - cumin, turmeric, fennel, coriander, chilli powder, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a large pinch of salt\n\nonce chicken is browned and maybe cooked through, add 1 tin of chopped tomatoes, then simmer for at least 20 minutes. adding lime is good.\n\nIf you can't be fucked cooking rice you can add 1 diced sweet potato and cook for at least 35 minutes.\n\ntaste, if it is bland add more spices, if it is unspicy add more chilli powder, if it needs more salt add some. You can go pretty wild with the vegetables in this, adding things like celery or mushrooms at the same time as the onions, or peas at the end, is all extra flavor and nutrition. If you want it to be more creamy, add some icelandic yogurt or just normal natural yogurt\n\n**Lazy paella**:\n\nput 1-3 chicken thigh in oven, cover with oil, then cook at 180 degrees c for 35 mins. take out, cool, then pull the meat off\n\nboil water in pan, add tumeric, add rice.\n\nwhen rice has 2 minutes left add frozen peas and frozen fish or shrimp, fish can be crazy cheap. Smoked sausage is also an easy 2 minute ingredient that makes this better.\n\nadd chicken thigh, and salt and pepper to taste\n\n\n**Carbonara-ish**\n\nI make a carbonara using eggs, milk, with a tiny bit of chorizo with rosmary and a kick of chili, and it is amazing, and the eggs replace the cheesyness I crave. I base it off [this recipe](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pasta-recipes/chorizo-carbonara-with-catalan-market-salad/) but half the chorizo, very little cheese if any, and no salad\n\n**sweet potato wedges**\n\n\nsweet potato wedges are a very low calorie replacement that hits the same spot as fries. Just wedge em, spray with some of that 1 calorie spray, add herbs/spices depending on what flavour you're going for.\n\n**Broccoli and cauliflower soup**, possibly the lowest calorie thing I make super regularly, and it is super tasty. \n\nFry 1 small onion in about 1/2 a teaspoon of oil, low and slow, this adds great sweetness. Add 2 head of broccoli and 1 head of cauliflower, then 1 chicken stock cube and enough water to fill up the pan. Add a big amount of pepper (bit by bit then taste) while boiling. cook for about 10 mins then blend. \n\nroughly 100 kcal\n\n**chicken chilli wrap.** \n\nboil a chicken breast in water with a bit of salt and chili for about 25 mins, remove and shred. reduce water down to not much, then add chicken in again with 1/8 can cannolini beans, chopped tomatos, chopped fresh chili, tonnes of mushrooms, then reduce down again till not much water left. Without a wrap it sits at about 220 kcal\n\n**Japenese Udon Noodles** - Fuck me this will rock your world\n\nboil 1 chicken breast in water, with 1 heaped tsp of chinese 5 spice and 2tbs of soy sauce. Cook for 20 mins then remove and shred. add 1 clove of garlic, chicken stock cube, tonnes of mushrooms, and some [udon noodles](http://img.21food.com/20110609/product/1305081968546.jpg). Finish with 1 tbsp of Worcester sauce and some spring onions (scallions). sits at 475 calories, but normally does 2 big bowls.\n\n**tuna mayo pasta**\n\nProbably the simplest meal you can make.\n\nBoil 250g pasta for 10 mins, (this makes 2 huge servings)\n\nWhen pasta has 2 minutes left, stir in some frozen peas and sweetcorn\n\nOpen a can of cheap tuna and drain the oil/brine/water\n\nDrain pasta, then stir in tuna, a little olive oil, and a good amount of mayonnaise\n\nAdd a good amount of pepper, a wee bit of salt, some (dried) basil, and some garlic powder. Some chili flakes are never a bad move either.\n\n**Pork Wellington**\n\nThis one is for showing off, as it looks amazing, but it is also suprisingly easy and, when you get pork tenderloin on the cheap, can actually be reasonably cheap.\n\nFry a finely diced onion and some finely diced mushrooms. \n\nRoll out about half a block of frozen pastry so it is about 20cm up and as wide as your tenderloin is long\n\nplace bacon on the pastry, covering as much of the surface as you can afford\n\nonce mushrooms and onions have softened, spread over bacon/pastry\n\nplace tenderloin on top, then roll up into a cylinder and seal the ends.\n\nCook in the oven for about 40 minutes at around 170C\n\nserve with lots of brocolli/other greens\n\nmakes about 4 portions\n\n**burgers**\n\nGet some beef mince, put in a bowl large enough to mix it, then add an egg, chives, salt, pepper, and maybe basil. \n\nGradually add breadcrumbs until it becomes solid enough to form into safe patties.\n\nGrill, or fry, then eat\n\n**sausage pasta**\n\nchop a couple sausages into bite-size chunks, then put into a lightly oiled baking dish. Add a bunch of quartered mushrooms, then add salt and pepper, and shove in the oven. They need about 15 minutes at around 180C (fan) or 200C\n\nBoil about 300g pasta for 10 minutes in salted water. After 5 minutes add a shit-tonne of broccoli\n\nOnce pasta is done, drain, add frozen peas and sweetcorn, and let that defrost for 30 seconds or so. \n\nstir in passata (crushed tomatoes), enough to make it look saucy, then some Worcester sauce (only a wee bit), lots of basil, lots of garlic powder, and salt and pepper. \n\nGet the sausage/mushrooms out the oven when they are cooked, then pour the pasta into the baking dish and stir round. top with cheese and but back in for about 15 minutes\n\nMakes about 5 servings\n\n\n**pasta pesto**\n\nThis one often isn't cheap, as fucking pine nuts cost crazy money recently. \n\nBoil pasta for 10 mins, adding frozen sweetcorn at the 8 minute mark.\n\nIn a blender, add about two plants of basil, 50g of pine nuts, some oil, and a garlic clove or three, and blend into a paste.\n\nadd to pasta\n\n**Gumbo-ish**\n\nGet 7 boneless chicken thighs (or 3-4 breasts), cover in oil and cajun spice mix, and put in the oven at 180 C for 35 minutes in a large cast iron skillet\n\nChop up 4 stalks of celery, 1/2 an onion, a good amount of mushrooms, 1-2 red bell pepper, a pack of okra a few cloves of garlic, and a good bit of chorizo (with the skin removed) \n\nGet a deep pot, and put in a good few tablespoons of butter, then melt, then add an equal number of heaped tablespoons of flour, and fry the roux very gently so it it begins to colour\n\nWhen the chicken thighs are done, take them out the skillet and rest on a plate, then put the skillet on the hob and gently fry  all the vegetables and chorizo (I normally start with the onion and celery, then add chorizo for a couple minutes, then add everything else,\n\nChop up the chicken into bite size pieces.\n\nonce the veg is done, gradually add a couple liters of water and a chicken stock cube to the roux, and stir until there are no lumps. Add the veg into the pan and the chicken, and make sure the water level fills most the pan. Add a shit-tonne more cajun spice mix, salt, pepper, and some chili powder, and keep tasting and adding what it feels like it needs until it tastes how you want\n\nAdd a couple handfuls of white rice\n\nCook for 10 minutes, stirring regularly, as the rice will stick to the bottom\n\n**mushroom pasta**\n\nget pasta boiling\n\nFinely dice loads of mushroom\n\nfry mushroom in a tiny bit of olive oil, and add a bit of salt\n\nonce they have cooked through, and when pasta has about 2 minutes left, add in a smallish nob of butter\n\nstir through 1 very heaped tablespoon of flour\n\nonce everything is combined, add milk bit by bit until a thick creamy sauce is formed. Chuck some sweetcorn into the pasta pot\n\nadd salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some basil (dried works well, but very finely sliced fresh would be awesome)\n\ncombine with pasta and serve.\n\n**marsetti**\n\nget about 500g of pasta boiling in salted water\n\nfinely dice an onion, and get it frying\n\nonce onion is translucent, add in 500g of mince\n\ncook through\n\nonce everything is cooked, mix the frying pan with the pasta, then stir in 1 can of condensed mushroom soup and 1 can of condensed tomato soup, then add salt, pepper, garlic, and MSG.\n\nmove to an oven dish and cover with cheese mixed with breadcrumbs, then bake until everything is golden and crispy\n\n**Lazy mushroom risotto**\n\nChop up 3-4 mushrooms and 1/2 a small onion per person finely diced. \n\nIn a saucepan, fry onions in olive oil for about 5 minutes\n\nadd all the mushrooms and cook for a couple minutes, until they are browned and soft.\n\nAdd some butter then add 75-100g of risotto rice per person. \n\ncook rice in the butter for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly, then add 1/3 of a chicken stock cube per person\n\nadd a good covering of water. You are about to cook it for 20 minutes so don't put too little in\n\ncover and cook on low for 10 minutes, stir, then cook for another 10 minute\n\nIf there is still too much water left cook uncovered for a few minutes whilst stirring. \n\nAdd in s,p, garlic powder, a good bit of basil, some msg, and taste. Fix if it is missing anything\n\n**EDIT** **sushi** REMOVED. I just found out I was risking poisoning people with my recipe. Sorry everyone. Here's a nice replacement of a recipe I made yesterday to make up for almost killing people\n\n**Thai Green Vegetable Curry**\n\nPut rice on\n\nDice an onion and some celery, and finely slice a carrot. Get a deep pan and cook gently in coconut oil\n\nCube up an aubergine (eggplant), a courgette(Zucchini) a shit-tonne of mushrooms, then add to the pan.

{"title": "All hail the one-pot chicken and rice! Sharing my favorite quick, cheap, and easy recipe.", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/K9UMXPm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/K9UMXPm.jpg)\n\nI love one-pot chicken and rice. It's what I go to when I'm not in the mood to cook but don't want to order takeout. My favorite thing about it is that you can customize it almost endlessly.  I whipped this up using what I had in my fridge. The ingredient list looks long, but it's really mostly pantry staples \u2013\u00a0oil, spices, rice, and water or stock. The wild card ingredients were really just the avocado topping and cheese, but I had them tucked away in my fridge so that's why I used them. I've included substitutions below so I'm sure you could make some variation of this work with what you have in your fridge!\n\nRecipe here originally: [One-Pot Chicken and Rice](https://triedtruerecipe.com/ChickenRice)\n\nSUBSTITUTIONS:\n\nChicken Breasts: Chicken thighs\n\nWhite Rice: Use brown or wild rice, adjust cook time and amount of stock, as necessary\n\nADDITIONS:\n\n* Bell peppers\n* Small-diced sweet potato or butternut squash\n* Poblano peppers, for a hint of smokiness\n* Baby spinach added at the very end of cooking\n* Black beans, drained and added with the tomatoes\n\nIf you want to bolster this recipe with additional, hearty vegetables like sweet potatoes or additional peppers, be sure to remove the chicken from the skillet before adding onion. Cook the onion for about 5 minutes, add the additional vegetables and season with salt, pepper, cumin, and chili powder and cook until softened. Return the chicken to the pot and continue on with the recipe as written. \n\nI added shredded cheese to mine since I had some about to go bad, but you can omit if you want to reduce calories! I also made a guacamole-ish (didn't have all the ingredients to make it legit) but you can omit or top with radishes or cilantro for a crisp finish to the dish!\n\n## One-Pot Chicken and Rice\n\nThis easy one-pot chicken and rice is a mid-week dream recipe. This one-pot chicken recipe is easy to prepare, loaded with flavor, and only requires a few ingredients. \n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\n\nCook Time: 20 minutes\n\nInactive Time: 20-30 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour to 1hr10mins\n\nServings: 5\n\nCalories: 503kcal \n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide pot\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 pound thin-sliced chicken cutlets cut into bite-sized cubes\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil divided\n* 1 tablespoon chili powder\n* 2 teaspoons cumin\n* 2 teaspoons garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder more or less, depending on preference\n* Salt and pepper, about \u00bd teaspoon of each, more or less depending on your preference\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 3 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 2 tablespoons butter -- optional, but you may need a touch of oil\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder\n* 1 teaspoon cumin\n* \u00bd teaspoon cayenne powder optional\n* 1 cup white rice long-grain, preferred\n* 2 cups chicken stock or water plus more, as needed\n* 14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes\n* \u00bd cup shredded sharp cheddar or Mexican blend cheese optional\n* 2 scallions minced, white and green parts kept separate\n\n#### Avocado Topping (Optional):\n\n* 1 avocado peeled and cored\n* 1 jalape\u00f1o trimmed and minced\n* 1 lime juiced\n* \u00bc red onion peeled and minced\n* 2 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the Chicken:\n\n* Combine the diced chicken with one tablespoon olive in a gallon freezer bag. Add chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne powder, salt and pepper. Close the bag and shake it until the chicken is completely coated. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15 minutes as you prepare the remaining ingredients.\n\n#### Prepare Avocado Topping:\n\n* Place the avocado in a bowl and mash with a fork. Add jalape\u00f1o, lime juice, red onion, and garlic and mix to combine. Season with salt. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator.\n\n#### Cook the Chicken:\n\n* Heat the remaining oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook in an even layer for at least 5-7 minutes until a brown crust forms. Flip and cook again for 5-7 minutes. Continue cooking, allowing the chicken to cook undisturbed in intervals until the chicken is almost completely cooked through.\n\n#### Cook the Aromatics:\n\n* Add the onion and cook for 4-5 minutes until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the butter and cook an additional minute until frothy, being careful not to burn the garlic. Add the remaining spices, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne powder and cook briefly until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n#### Cook the Rice:\n\n* Once the butter is melted and frothy, add the rice and toss to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes until toasted and coated with the butter and spices.\n* Pour in the stock, add tomatoes, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes, stirring regularly, to prevent the rice from sticking. Cook until the rice is tender, but not overcooked. Add more stock or water, as necessary, to loosen up the rice if it absorbs too much liquid. Taste and season to your preferences.\n* Once the rice is tender, stir in the cheddar cheese and the white parts of the scallions. Cook for 1-3 minutes until the cheese is melted. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Divide the chicken and rice between bowls and spoon the avocado topping onto each. Garnish with the green parts of scallions. Enjoy!\n\n### Nutrition\n\nCalories: 503kcal | Carbohydrates: 45g | Protein: 29g | Fat: 24g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Cholesterol: 82mg | Sodium: 404mg | Potassium: 969mg | Fiber: 6g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 1098IU | Vitamin C: 21mg | Calcium: 165mg | Iron: 3mg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/k66ngk/all_hail_the_onepot_chicken_and_rice_sharing_my/", "created_utc": 1607030877.0, "score": 2702, "author": "BushyEyes", "num_comments": 148, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/k66ngk/all_hail_the_onepot_chicken_and_rice_sharing_my/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Don't pass up on sardines!", "selftext": "I am obsessively passionate about sardines as a food and they are pretty much the perfect food source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhenever I mention them to friends/family/acquaintances they all look at me in disgust and tell me that's what they feed their cats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want a genuine cheap superfood (not a fad superfood) pick up a can (or 10) of sardines the next time you shop. They have extremely good benefits to heart, brain, bone and skin health thanks to their high levels of vitamin B12, selenium, phosphorous, omega 3 and calcium; providing you buy the cans with skin and bone included, both the bones and skin are unnoticeable when you eat them. They are also a very cheap and very good source of protein and even have a very decent amount of vitamin D, I mean, which other food source gives vitamin D?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a can they last for years which is perfect for the coronavirus pandemic as you will have stocks should the shop run out, also means you may have to shop less often so lower risk of infection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of that they are EXTREMELY cheap. A can of tuna in the UK costs around \u00a31 yet I can buy a can of sardines in tomato sauce for 31p (Aldi), so 3 cans of sardines per can of tuna plus the health benefits are much higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSardines are very low in mercury thanks to being bottom of the food chain so you don't have to worry unlike tuna (most countries recommend a maximum of 2 cans of tuna per week). I'm not a qualified nutritionist and not a scientist but I've seen many sources stating tuna has 10x-20x more mercury than sardines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd to top it all off, for the environmentally aware, they are considered extremely sustainable. AFAIK they are almost never farmed and pretty much always caught wild, reproduce fast and are currently not overfished other than in some parts. They were previously overfished when canning food was new but they bounced right back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the people who are really looking to cost cut and have no cooking ability (me), what I do personally is cook up 100g (dry) of wholewheat pasta. Drain the pasta and put it in a bowl, mush the sardines (canned in tomato sauce) into the pasta then microwave for 30 secs to a minute (just to warm the sardines) then add some pepper and if you like some hot sauce. Delicious meal costing around \u00a30.50.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously, do some research and you will learn!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oh wow this blew up. I never anticipated THIS much excitement about sardines.

{"title": "Making restaurant quality food at home, frugally: an ongoing project. (long) X-post from r/povertyfinance", "selftext": "It was suggested over in r/povertyfinance that I post this here too.  I've only just learned about this subreddit today. \n\n**TL:DR I\u2019m planning to start an ongoing project about how to make great food at home. It would differ from what's already out there by also teaching shopping strategies, including lists for pantry building, and calculating costs of completed meals. I wanted to come to reddit first and get some feedback on what you would want to see, what problems you have in the kitchen right now, and frankly whether anyone would give a damn. I want to gauge interest before I undertake this massive project. I want all of this information to be free.**\n\nNow for the long version:\n\nI\u2019m a professional chef with almost 20 years of experience, and let me tell you\u2026 if they had the right training, most people could put out some great food at home without a ton of effort. Most home cooks I talk to have a basic, deep-seated anxiety about cooking at home, and either aim at super-easy recipes, or spend way too much on ingredients to make eating at home a substitute for going out.\n\nI want to do this for 3 reasons.\n\n* First, I truly believe that there's a sizeable financial aspect to eating well at home. Eating at home is always cheaper than going to a restaurant, but if you aren\u2019t eating fantastic food, it feels like you\u2019re just eating for sustenance. It makes going out to eat that much more appealing: not only do you not have to cook, the food at the restaurant is BETTER.\n* That brings me to my second point, which might be a bit of a pipe dream but it drives me nonetheless: I think, as a whole, restaurant food in most of the USA should be better than it is, and I want to help make it better. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are certain places where everything is great, and there are always gems in locations that aren't known for great food\u2026 but man, we chefs should be doing better. The only reason that half-assed food can be sold is that people buy it. But what if you can make great shrimp alfredo at home, on the cheap? Are you going to pay WAY MORE for MEDIOCRE shrimp alfredo at a restaurant? I hope not. In general, I believe that if people are eating better food in their day-to-day life, they are going to expect great food when they go out.\n* My third reason might be obvious to some, but it\u2019s self-promotion. I feel it\u2019s important to be transparent about this. I\u2019ve been hemming and hawing about this idea for years, trying to figure out how to monetize it. Recently I\u2019ve just decided that it\u2019s something that I really want to do, and screw the monetization. It would provide a readily accessible body of work for people that want to hire me for the services that I DO charge for\u2026 like a living, breathing resume if you will.\n\nThis project would have 3, maybe 4 aspects to it:\n\n1. **Shopping strategies** \\- you can get into a lot of trouble at a grocery store, and the grocery stores know this very well. Many chains are famous for what I call \u201clandmines,\u201d which is basically something that is way more expensive than it needs to be for the quantity that you are purchasing. \u201cLuxury\u201d items are famous for this\u2026 take that $10 package of smoked salmon. It\u2019s all nice and pretty in its flat container, lookin\u2019 fly right next to the cream cheese. And it\u2019s 4oz, enough for a few bagels. Thats $40 per pound folks, 45% MORE than dry-aged prime ribeye steaks at Wegmans, and Wegmans isn\u2019t the cheapest kid on the block by far. The first thing I want to do is teach people how to shop.\n2. **Building a pantry** \\- with a strong pantry, dinner options open up immensely. What I mean by that is having certain things in your freezer, certain condiments, certain spices, etc. Building this up would be a bit of an investment at first but would pay off not only in the recipe costs, but in making it easier to cook at home. Easier to do means more likely to do. Building the right pantry is a skill, and is definitely teachable.\n3. **Flexible recipes** \\- a big source of expense and anxiety when following a recipe is gathering and purchasing all of the ingredients. ALL of them, right? We wouldn\u2019t want the recipe to come out poorly. But the truth is, there are lots of ingredients in recipes that could be replaced with something else, or omitted altogether, without a noticeable difference in the quality of the food. The key is knowing the difference between ingredients that can be changed, and ingredients that can\u2019t. I can do this because food has been my whole life for decades, but we can\u2019t expect a casual home cook to know the difference. I\u2019d write recipes and make it clear what's important and what\u2019s flexible.\n4. **Cost of the finished meal** \\- this is something that I\u2019d really like to do to show how cheap eating well at home can be, but it\u2019s the part that I\u2019m more hesitant about. It would take a lot of extra work for each recipe, costs change based on location, and I\u2019m not sure that anyone would care that much. Would anyone care?\n\n*Does this sound like something that* r/EatCheapAndHealthy *would be interested in? I'm not just looking for validation, I'm looking for honest opinions and criticism too.*   *I'm wondering if its something that people would put effort into with the goal of being really good in the kitchen at home, or would it be something that people swipe through and just look at but would never try to use in their life.*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/dtw98n/making_restaurant_quality_food_at_home_frugally/", "created_utc": 1573308044.0, "score": 2650, "author": "HairyHamburgers", "num_comments": 349, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/dtw98n/making_restaurant_quality_food_at_home_frugally/", "html_title": ""}

Soups, braised chicken, dry beans, or about any slow cooker meal done in less than an hour.

{"title": "LPT: Keep checking your local grocery stores for priced down ham. Fred Meyer/Kroger JUST started clearing their holiday overstock of house brand ham.", "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that I worked for Fred Meyer (Kroger) for several years, but this should apply to most grocery stores that sell house/generic brand ham.\n\nStores obviously order massive quantities of turkey and ham for the holidays. You\u2019ll typically see Turkey marked down right after Christmas because stores know that people don\u2019t normally buy whole turkey outside of the holidays. So they have to price it to move ASAP right after Christmas.\n\nHam on the other hand is a more popular item throughout the rest of the year. It isn\u2019t necessarily relegated to November/December the same way turkey is, which makes it easier to move without a significant markdown. Ham also has a pretty generous shelf life. \n\nSo what often ends up happening is that they\u2019ll keep their house brand ham at a relatively normal price point as long as they can, right up until their forecasts indicate that they won\u2019t move all of their holiday overstock before it expires. That\u2019s when they\u2019re forced to start marking down, and this can happen well into January. They also sometimes do multiple waves of markdowns to minimize losses. As an example, they might discount ham to $2/lb for a week or two until they find that it\u2019s still not moving fast enough, then they\u2019ll discount it even lower. So even if you saw a good deal a week ago, keep checking because you might find an even better deal later. Note that this mainly applies to generic/store brand hams. \n\nI\u2019ve been checking my local Fred Meyer every day, and they just pushed through what I like to call their \u201coh shit discounts\u201d.

This is hard to fuck up.", "selftext": "First - get a jar or can of spaghetti sauce that looks good to you.  Any kind is fine - don't get the super expensive ones.  You can also use plain canned crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce but you will need to season it more.  \n\nThen you can choose to use meat - ground beef, chicken breast, italian sausage, bacon, ground turkey, or ground chicken are all good choices.  If you don't want meat skip right to choosing veggies.  Sausage or chicken can be left whole or cut up, either way is fine.  \n\nIf you want to have meat in your sauce you should saute it in a pot or large skillet until cooked all the way.  If it's a leaner meat like chicken or turkey add a little oil - olive oil or any vegetable oil is fine.   Use medium heat here - we don't want to burn the hell out of anything, if things start to look too brown or are sizzling too hard turn it down.   Once your meat is cooked you'll be adding veggies.  \n\nThen you can pick 2-3 of the below veggies to add to your pot: \n\n - onions (any kind) \n - olives \n - canned cannellini beans \n - spinach (frozen is fine) \n - kale \n - mushrooms\n - bell pepper (any color)\n - zucchini\n - yellow squash  \n - eggplant \n - carrots \n - asparagus \n\nYou can also add extra seasonings at this point: \n\n - red pepper flakes\n - italian seasoning \n - garlic or garlic powder \n - oregano \n - basil \n - black pepper \n\nDo not add salt until you have tasted the sauce + mixins.  \n\nOnce your meat and veggies have cooked together for a few minutes it's time to add your jar of sauce - open it and pour it right in on top of everything.  Then fill about 1/4 of the jar with water, put the lid back on and shake it up.  Pour this into the pot, this way all the sauce remnants make it in.  Allow it to heat all the way through and cook together for a few minutes.  Taste things and add salt or other seasoning as needed. \n\nServe on your favorite pasta, follow the directions on the box and make sure water is boiling before you add the noodles.

{"title": "If you're doing fall baking this year and have a Middle Eastern market near you, Labneh is a lower calorie, lower fat, and higher protein alternative to cream cheese!", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/awHz0fo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/awHz0fo.jpg)\n\nNot going to outright say it's healthier because everyone has different health goals but I used it in pumpkin bars at a 1:1 ratio instead of cream cheese and it was AMAZING. You could even try doing half cream cheese/half labneh.\n\nIt's definitely more tart, acidic, and not as thick as cream cheese, but it worked really well  for me and reduced the calories and fat in my dessert. It baked up pretty similarly to cream cheese and I was very satisfied with it! Don't know if you could make a full-on cheesecake with it because it is a fair amount thinner than cream cheese, but for things like swirl bars or brownies or as a topping for bagels, it's a really great option.\n\nHere's the difference in nutrition per 3 ounces according to google!\n\n**Labneh:**\n\ncalories: 50\n\nfat: .4g | sat fat .1g\n\nprotein 9g\n\n**Cream Cheese:**\n\ncalories: 291\n\nfat: 29g | sat fat: 15g\n\nprotein: 5g\n\nJust figured you all might be interested in seeking this ingredient out if you haven't heard of it or used it before!\n\nand if you'd like the recipe for my Pumpkin and Maple Labneh Bars here it is!  \n\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 2\u00bd cups all purpose flour\n* 1\u00bd teaspoon baking soda\n* \u00bd teaspoon salt\n* 1 tablespoon kafe hawaij or pumpkin pie spice\n* 1 cup unsalted butter at room temperature\n* 1 cup light brown sugar\n* 1 egg\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 15- ounce can pumpkin puree\n* 1 cup labneh\n* \u2153 cup granulated sugar\n* 1 egg\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* \u00bc cup maple syrup\n\n### Instructions\n\n* Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n\n#### Prepare the dry ingredients:\n\n* In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and kafe hawaij (or pumpkin pie spice).\n\n#### Prepare the wet ingredients:\n\n* Place the unsalted butter in a large mixing bowl and beat with a hand-mixer until whipped and smooth. Add the brown sugar and continue mixing until combined.\n* Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat for 1 minute.\n* Add the pumpkin puree to the wet ingredients and beat until just combined and smooth.\n\n#### Combine the wet and dry ingredients:\n\n* Slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Do NOT overmix. It will look a bit lumpy and not as smooth as cake batter, and that's okay. Wash off the beaters.\n\n#### Prepare the baking sheet:\n\n* Line the baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving an overhang of paper on all sides.\n* Add half the pumpkin mixture to the baking sheet, using a rubber spatula to smooth it out. Set aside.\n\n#### Prepare the labneh mixture:\n\n* Wipe out the bowl used for the flour.\n* Place the labneh in the bowl. Mix on high with the hand mixer until smooth. Add the sugar, egg, maple syrup, and vanilla extract and continue mixing until completely smooth. Taste and add more maple syrup if you prefer a sweeter labneh.\n\n#### Finish preparing the baking sheet:\n\n* Using a spoon, drop half the labneh mixture over the layer of pumpkin mixture and use a toothpick to create a swirl pattern.\n* Pour the remaining pumpkin mixture on top and smooth it out with a spatula. It won't be perfect but that's okay! Drop the remaining labneh mixture on top and smooth it out once more and ensure the mixture goes edge-to-edge.\n\n#### Bake the pumpkin bars:\n\n* Transfer the baking sheet to the preheated oven for 35\u201345 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting. Serve with whipped cream and a dusting of kafe hawaij.\n* Store the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.\n\n### Nutrition\n\nCalories: 187kcal | Carbohydrates: 26g | Protein: 3g | Fat: 8g | Saturated Fat: 5g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Cholesterol: 34mg | Sodium: 130mg | Potassium: 90mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 15g | Vitamin A: 3014IU | Vitamin C: 1mg | Calcium: 31mg | Iron: 1mg", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/qei54n/if_youre_doing_fall_baking_this_year_and_have_a/", "created_utc": 1635038975.0, "score": 2558, "author": "BushyEyes", "num_comments": 120, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/qei54n/if_youre_doing_fall_baking_this_year_and_have_a/", "html_title": ""}

Have Bulk Ingredients to Last for Weeks Leftover, Too!", "selftext": "In this post, I am going to walk you through several (10+ dishes/meals!) complimentary recipes that you can prepare at home using a mixture of commonly available and Indian Grocer/Online Shop-only ingredients. Indian/Asian grocers are much more common than many people realize, so please search to see if some are near you! They are a fabulous place to acquire otherwise very-expensive spices and lentils/rices for very cheap. **At the very bottom of this post are some example pictures from previous meals I've made like this, but this post covers MORE recipes with MORE variety!)**\n\nIn this recipe, I am basing the overall cost as if you had to buy *everything* upfront and fresh. That includes \"basics\" like salt, sugar, oil, and butter. Moreover, if, like me, you cook Indian food regularly, you'll have many more of these ingredients in bulk already, and can make this meal for **much** less money. That said, all told, this will prepare about 1 week's worth of meals (give or take **21 servings** total). If you buy everything with optional ingredients, it may be as much as $75; if you only need \"fresh\" ingredients (veggies, frozen food, yogurt, etc.), it **could be as little as $30!**\n\nUpfront, here's a list of *all* the ingredients for all the recipes, with approximate prices (local for me in Southeastern US in a major metro area). Ingredients that you should look for at major supermarkets (cheaper based on volume) are plain; those you should get from **Indian grocers are bolded**.\n\n----\n\n**All Ingredients**\n\n* Basmati Rice (2lb bag, $3.50)\n* Parboiled Rice (1lb bag, $1.00)\n* **Urad Wash/Skinless Whole Urad Dal (2lb bag $4.00)**\n* **Toor Dal/Split Pigeon Peas (2lb bag, about $3.50)**\n* **Chana Dal/Split, Dried Chickpeas (2lb bag, $3.00)**\n* Salt (Small shaker, $1.00 tops)\n* Vegetable Oil (32oz bottle, $2.00)\n* **Dried Red Chilies (Big baggie, $3.00)**\n* **Fenugreek Seeds (7oz baggie, $3.00)** *(Optional, helps fermentation of batter)*\n* **Mustard Seeds (7oz baggie, $3.00)**\n* **Cumin Seeds (7oz baggie, $2.50)**\n* **Turmeric Powder (7oz baggie, $3.00)**\n* **Sambar Powder (Small Box or Shaker, about $1.50)**\n* **Red Chili Powder (Small baggie, about $2.00)** *(Optional, but handy! \"Kashmiri\" chili powder is lovely red without as much heat as regular; Cayenne Pepper is a decent, but not perfect, substitute, for regular; add some paprika to emulate kashmiri)*\n* **Garam Masala Powder (Small baggie, $2.00)** *(Optional)*\n* **Qasuri Methi/Dried Fenugreek Leaves (small box, $1.00)** *(Optional)*\n* Sugar (1 bag, $2.00) *(Optional)\n* **Hing Powder/Asafoetida (Small Shaker, $2.00)**\n* Peanuts or Cashews, Unsalted/Unroasted (Small container, $3.00, or **baggie, $3.00**)\n* Onions, Yellow, Large (4, about $2.00)\n* Potatoes, Russet/Idaho, Large (2-4 depending on size, about $2.00)\n* Tomatoes, Roma, Whole (!10, about $3.00)\n* 1 Lime ($0.75)\n* Green Chilies, **Florida Hots** or Jalapenos; Serranos Work, Too (About 8-10, or $.50)\n* Garlic (About 2 heads, $1.00)\n* Ginger (About a 4\" piece total, $1.00)\n* Cilantro, Bunch (About $1.00)\n* **Curry Leaves (Small baggie, $1.00)**\n* **Frozen Shredded Coconut**/1 Fresh Grated Coconut (**About $2.50** or $1.50)\n* Frozen Mixed Vegetables (About $1.00)\n* Frozen Chopped Spinach (1lb bag, $1.50)\n* Can of Coconut Milk ($2.00)\n* **Tamarind Paste or Concentrate (About $1.50 or $3.00)**\n* Yogurt, Plain, Unsweetened (Tub, about $3.00)\n* Shredded Mild Cheese like Mozzarella (8oz baggie, $2.50)\n* Unsalted Butter (Small box, about $2.50) *(Optional)*\n* 1/2 dozen eggs ($1.00)\n\n------\n\nThe different daily meals are located in a comment below!\n\n------\n\n#The Recipes\n##Dosa/Idly/Uttapam Batter\n*A slightly tangy, fluffy batter to make crispy dosa crepes and fluffy uttapam pancakes with)*\n###Ingredients\n* 2 cups basmati rice\n* 1 cup Parboiled Rice (you can use fancy \"idly rice\" here, but it's expensive)\n* 1 cup urad dad, skinless\n* 1 tsp fenugreek seeds *(Optional, aids fermentation, esp. if your dal may not be fresh)*\n* Water\n* 1.5 - 2 tsp salt\n\n### Directions\nIn a large bowl, combine the basmati and parboiled rice and cover with water by about 1-2 inches. In a smaller bowl, combine the urad dal and fenugreek seeds (if using) and cover with water similarly.\n\nLet both bowls soak for about 3-4 hours, until softened noticeably. Using a blender or wet-dry grinder, first reduce the dal+fenugreek seed mixture to a thin batter, then the rice mixture. You likely won't need all of the water leftover from soaking, but reserve it to add to the batter to keep it moving in the blender as necessary.\n\nIn the end, you want a texture thinner than pancake batter, but a little thicker than crepe batter. When combined, the urad dal and rice mixtures should coat the back of a spoon in a translucent layer and flow easily.\n\nLet the batter rest in a warm place (ideally around 80F) for 8-10 hours to ferment. If successful, the batter may grow in volume and sport visible, albeit very small, bubbles. Mix in the salt now, and refrigerate when not in use to slow down the fermentation. Should keep for a week, but will become more tangy with age (which some people may not enjoy. If so, make a half-quantity on Sunday and prepare the rest on Wednesday or so).\n\nYou can use this batter to make Idlies, Dosai, and Uttapams.\n\nIn the comment below, you'll see examples for the latter two (idlies are more complicated and require a special steaming tray, but are very tasty!).\n\n-----\n\n##Spicy Tomato-Onion Chutney\n*A thick, spicy, savory spread or dip to serve on or alongside other food*\n###Ingredients\n* 1.5 tbsp oil\n* 1 tsp mustard seeds\n* 3-6 dried red chilies (how hot do you like it?!)\n* ~1/8-1/4 tsp hing powder\n* 6-8 cloves of garlic, crushed\n* 1 medium or 3/4 large onion, roughly chopped\n* 4-5 roma tomatoes, skinned (slit an x into the skin, boil them for ~1 minute, then dunk them in ice-water to easily peel it), roughly chopped\n\n###Directions\nHeat the oil in a small saucier or pot over medium high heat until shimmering. Add the mustard seeds and allow them to sputter and crackle. Add the red chilies, hing powder, and garlic, and roast for about 15-30 seconds until fragrant. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened, 3-4 minutes, Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, until softened, about 8 minutes. If you like a \"thinner\" (more spreadable) chutney, cook covered to retain moisture. If you like a thicker (more dippable) chutney, cook uncovered.\n\nIn either case, once finished, allow to cool slightly, and then, using a blender, immersion blender, or food processor, blend into a thick paste. Leave it a little chunky for more texture if you like. Makes a great topping for dosas or uttapams, or a good \"dip\" for things like samosas or parathas (but that's a different recipe!).\n\nKeep refrigerated until needed.\n\n------\n\n##Chunky Potato Sabji\n*A thick, chunky, tangy and spicy mix of potatoes, onions, and crunchy lentils & nuts*\n###Ingredients\n* 1.5 tbsp oil\n* 1/2 tsp mustard seeds\n* 1/2 tsp cumin seeds\n* 3-4 red chilies\n* 1.5 tsp urad dal (split or whole skinless)\n* 1.5 tsp chana dal (split chickpeas)\n* 2 tbsp cashew nut pieces or peanuts, raw\n* 2\" piece of ginger, minced or grated\n* ~2 sprigs of curry leaves\n* 1 large yellow onion, sliced thick\n* 2-3 green chilies, chopped fine\n* 1 - 1.5 tsp salt\n* 1 tsp turmeric\n* ~1 very large (or 2 medium) Russet/Idaho potato, chopped roughly and boiled till just done\n* 2 tbsp chopped cilantro\n* 2 tbsp lime juice\n\n###Directions\nIn a large, deep skillet, heat the oil over medium high-heat. Add the mustard seeds and let them crackle, then add the cumin seeds and red chilies. Allow to fry for about 15-30 seconds, then add the urad dal, chana dal, cashew nuts/peanuts, and ginger. Stir fry about 1 minute until the dals are beginning to darken, then add the curry leaves (careful, they splutter in the oil a lot), onions, and green chilies, and cook another 3-4 minutes until the onions are softening.\n\nAdd the turmeric at this time, along with the salt, and stir to combine, roasting the turmeric for about 1-1.5 minutes (stir so it doesn't burn). Then add the potatoes and stir fry until everything is well incorporated. Mash up some of the potatoes. Check your salt levels, too. Mix in the cilantro and combine. Then, remove from heat and stir in the lime juice.\n\nKeep refrigerated until needed.\n\n-----\n\n##Creamy Coconut Chutney\n*A spreadable, dippable \"cooling\" sauce that's tangy and sweet*\n###Ingredients\n* ~12-14oz of grated coconut, either fresh or frozen (you can use unsweetened desiccated that's been rehydrated in boiling water, but it will never grind as smooth, I find)\n* 1 tbsp chana dal\n* 1\" of ginger, roughly chopped\n* ~6-10 sprigs of cilantro, stems and all\n* 2-3 green chilies, roughly chopped\n* 1-2 tbsp of rehydrated tamarind paste, or about 1 tsp of tamarind concentrate\n* 1/2 cup of yogurt (or about half a can of coconut cream, for sweeter, less tangy chutney!)\n* Warm water as needed\n* 1/2 - 1 tsp salt\n* 1 tbsp of oil\n* 1 tsp of mustard seeds\n* 3-5 dried red chilies\n* ~1/8-1/4 tsp of hing powder\n* 1-2 sprigs of curry leaves\n* 1 tsp of urad dal (skinless)\n\nIn a small skillet or pan, dry-roast the chana dal, ginger, chilies, and cilantro over medium-low heat for about 2-4 minutes, just to reduce some of the raw flavors.\n\nCombine these ingredients with the coconut, tamarind, and yogurt/coconut milk in a good blender or food processor and reduce to a creamy, if somewhat lumpy, pale-green paste. If needed, add a little warm water to keep it moving in the blender. Salt to taste.\n\nIn a small skillet or pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the mustard seeds and let them crackle, then add the red chilies, hing powder, and urad dal. When you see the dal beginning to take on color, add the curry leaves and remove from heat. Stir slightly, then pour into the coconut chutney and mix to combine.\n\nFreeze about 2/3rds of this in small ziplock baggies; it doesn't stay fresh very long, even in a fridge, so being able to quickly nuke and thaw a few tablespoons of it on, say, days 3 and 5 of the week will be very helpful.\n\n-------\n\n##Chunky Sambar\n*A thick, protein-rich vegetable soup that's all at once spicy, tangy, and a little sweet*\n###Ingredients\n* 1 tbsp of oil\n* 1 tsp of mustard seeds\n* 1 tsp of cumin seeds\n* 1/4 tsp of hing\n* 1-2 sprigs of curry leaves\n* 4-6 cloves of garlic, minced\n* 1/2 onion, diced\n* 1/2 tsp turmeric\n* 1 tbsp sambar powder\n* 0-2 tsp chili powder (optional)\n* 3-4 roma tomatoes, chopped\n* 1/2 onion, roughly chopped\n* 2 medium or 1 large potatoes, chopped (can leave skin on)\n* 1 cup Frozen mixed veggies \n* 1/2 can of coconut milk\n* 2 tbsp rehydrated tamarind paste or 2 tsp of tamarind concentrate\n* 2 tbsp sugar (optional; really, crushed \"jaggery\" or brown palm sugar is best here, but hard to find/use)\n* ~2 cups of water\n* 1/2 cup of toor dal, rinsed\n* 1.5 cups of water\n* 2 tsp of salt\n* 2 tbsp cilantro, chopped\n\n###Directions\nIn a medium-sized saucier or pot, combine the toor dal and 1.5 cups of water (give or take), plus a little salt and a pinch of turmeric (under half a teaspoon each). Heat to boiling, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the lentils are soft and falling to pieces. Mash gently with a spoon or masher tool and reserve.\n\nHeat the oil in a large dutch oven or pot over medium heat, and add the mustard seeds when it is warm. After they sputter a little bit, add the cumin seeds, hing, and red chilies. Cook about 15-30 seconds until fragrant, then add the curry leaves, then the garlic, and then the diced onion.\n\nCook 3-4 minutes, then add the turmeric, sambar powder, and chili powder (if using). Cook another 15-30 seconds, stirring vigorously, then add the chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, and chopped potatoes. Also add the frozen veggies and then stir everything to combine. Cook briefly (about 1-2 minutes), then add the coconut milk, tamarind, sugar (if you don't like it super acidic), and enough water to barely cover.\n\nSimmer until your potatoes get tender, then add in the reserved mashed up toor dal mixture and salt the pot to taste. Sprinkle in some chopped cilantro and serve as a soup or over rice.\n\n-----\n\n##Palak Dal\n*A savory, creamy lentils-and-spinach curry with rich flavors of garlic, chilies, and fenugreek leaf*\n###Ingredients\n* 1 tbsp oil or butter (or both!)\n* 1 tsp mustard seeds\n* 1 tsp cumin seeds\n* 3-6 dried red chilies\n* 1/4 tsp hing powder\n* 5-6 cloves of garlic, crushed and lightly chopped\n* 2-3 green chilies, chopped\n* 1 onion, minced\n* 1/2 tsp turmeric\n* 0-2 tsp red chili powder (optional)\n* 1.5 tsp salt\n* 2-3 roma tomatoes, chopped\n* 1 cup of water\n* 1lb chopped spinach (or blanched and blended, for smoother curry)\n* 2 tbsp qasuri methi, powdered by rubbing in your hand (optional)\n* 1 cup of chana or toor dal, rinsed thoroughly (or a mix!) (if using chana, try to soak ~6-8 hours in water before cooking to reduce cooking time/water needed)\n* 2.5-3 cups of water\n* 2-3 tbsp butter (optional)\n* 1/2 cup yogurt\n\n###Directions\nIn a medium-sized pot or saucier, cook the chana and/or toor dal in about 2.5 cups of water with a little salt and turmeric until soft, but not mushy. Reserve.\n\nIn a large stock pot or dutch oven, heat the oil/butter over medium high heat. Add the mustard seeds, let them crackle, then add the cumin seeds, red chilies, hing powder, and garlic and fry for about 30 seconds. Add in the green chilies and minced onion and cook until the onion goes translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Then add your dried spices (turmeric and optional red chili powder) plus salt, stir to combine, and fry briefly--about 30 sec. Then add the tomatoes and water to cover and stir to combine, then cook, covered, 10 minutes--stirring occasionally.\n\nAdd your spinach and (if using) qasuri methi and cook another 2-3 minutes uncovered, then add your cooked dal mixture, then butter and/or yogurt for creaminess. Stir to combine and heat through; serve hot over rice.\n\n------\n\n##Rice!\n*Fragrant, perfect Indian rice lightly spiced with cumin*\n###Ingredients\n* 2 cups basmati rice, rinsed and soaked 30m\n* 8 cups of water\n* 1.5 tsp of salt\n* 1 tsp of cumin seeds\n\n###Directions\nRinse and soak your rice in enough water to cover for 30m. Separately, heat 8 cups of water to boiling in a large dutch oven or pot with the salt and cumin seeds. Drain the soaking water from the rice and add the rice to the boiling water; cook ~8-10 minutes until tender. Drain and serve with sambar or palak dal; refrigerate when done.\n\n-------\n\nOnce more, serving suggestions and meal guides are laid out below!

{"title": "LPT: Make your own broth. Extra delicious and saves $$$", "selftext": "I started doing this a couple months back, and it is awesome! Whenever I'm cutting up veggies or herbs, I toss the scraps (think outer onion layers, rosemary stems, etc.) into a freezer bag, and then when the bag starts to fill up, I'll cook whatever I've got with water (no salt or seasoning) in the instapot for like 45 mins. If you don't have one, you could just use a regular pot and boil everything for a couple hours. Anyway, this is not only saving $$$, but the taste is amazing. I sub the broth in for any recipe that calls for water (rice, beans, grits, etc.), and it tastes so good I feel like I'm cheating. It freezes well too, if you make more than you think you need. Bon Appetit!\n\nEdit: Hey glad y'all liked this. A couple more useful items from the thread:\n\n1- Yes you certainly can do this with meat scraps/bones. Freeze them and follow the same procedure.\n\n2- Roasting the scraps/bones/whatever you have saved will likely give a richer flavor. I haven't tried this w/ the veggies but I'm sure it would work, definitely does for bones.\n\n3- u/LaCuriosaChola pointed out that not all vegetables are great for this; u/PeaceLoveSmithWesson came through with the [link to the handy guide](https://jenniferskitchen.com/cooking-tips-and-how-tos/vegetables-to-include-or-exclude-from-vegetable-stock-or-broth)\n\n4- I have not used the broth more than a week out from when I made it. I would freeze it for any more time than that.\n\n5- Yes strain the finished product. You maniacs.\n\n6- Healthy? I'd think so... I mean it depends on what you put in it. It's a byproduct of whatever you put in the water so the veg stock would be lower in cal than the meat version. If you leave out seasoning, less sodium, etc.\n\n7- u/marbel tells me that adding eggshells adds all kinds of vitamins. Can't wait to give it a try!\n\n8- Step by step is 1- throw your onion peels, carrot peels, celery ends, (also bones, rotisserie chicken scraps) etc. into a freezer bag and freeze it. Do this until the bag begins to fill up. 2- empty the bag into the instant pot (or like a 6 qt pot on the stove top) and fill with water 3- set instant pot to high pressure and timer for 45 min (just hit the stovetop pot with low heat) and leave it 4- after 45min (or a couple hours if stove top) strain it and cook something (beans, rice, whatever). Enjoy! Optional 5- freeze what you're not going to use in the next week and refrigerate the rest. The whole process should take no longer than 5 minutes of actually doing stuff, the rest is waiting. This is easy af I'm telling you.\n\n9- As u/kerstaye9 and u/mmmmmmmg pointed out, this concoction can be reduced and frozen into ice cube trays or muffin tins for portioned out amounts to be used later\n\nLast but not least-- Re the debate about what flavor enhancement to add: You can add salt, garlic whatever you want, but this will change the flavor profile. I usually add herbs as I generally have some thyme/sage/rosemary stems. I leave out the seasoning because that's something you can add whenever you're making the recipe you're using the broth as a base for. If you want to season the broth that's totally cool too, especially as u/BeHereBeYouBelong pointed out this can be good to just drink if you're not feeling well. It's a matter of personal preference :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/eh01aj/lpt_make_your_own_broth_extra_delicious_and_saves/", "created_utc": 1577585782.0, "score": 2509, "author": "Hollopalooza", "num_comments": 191, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/eh01aj/lpt_make_your_own_broth_extra_delicious_and_saves/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Simple vegetarian meal ideas for those real poverty hours", "selftext": "Hi all! So I love this sub, I've been following for a while (since college!) and trying to learn a lot from y'all. I think I'm finally at the point in my adulthood where I can make meals without just reading and sticking to an ingredients list, so I wanted to share some simple things that I have been eating lately. I used to get discouraged by recipes on here that listed a bunch of spices that I didn't have - granted these assume you have some staples (butter, garlic, onion, chili powder, salt & pep) but I usually make things as simply as possible.\n\nBreakfast:\n\n* Quick grits w/ cheddar and 2 eggs scrambled\n\n* Overnight oats with PB&J\n\n* [Banana muffin](https://www.thekitchenmagpie.com/chocolate-chip-banana-muffins/) with PB\n\n* Greek yogurt with banana and oats\n\nLunch:\n\n* Black bean and sweet potato tacos\n\n* [Everything bagel](https://www.skinnytaste.com/easy-bagel-recipe/) with mashed avocado and a side of celery with PB\n\n* [Nashville hot tofu](https://www.rabbitandwolves.com/nashville-hot-tofu-nuggets-vegan/)\n\n* Tomato sandwich on [sourdough](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/rustic-sourdough-bread-recipe)\n\nDinner:\n\n* [Buffalo cauliflower](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239616/buffalo-cauliflower/) with buttered/salted quinoa\n\n* Box pasta with red lentil sauce: can of tomato sauce, can of lentils, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, red pepper flake\n\n* Homemade pizza - I make [sourdough crust](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe) and just add tomato sauce, red pepper flake, basil, and mozz\n\n* [Roasted chickpeas](https://tasty.co/recipe/spicy-roasted-chickpeas) and eggplant on [naan](https://www.budgetbytes.com/naan/) with ziki (just greek yogurt + dill + lime juice)\n\n* Ramen (yep, the brick) with a soft-boiled egg, chopped celery, and marinated tofu (soy sauce + honey/agave + garlic)\n\n* Fried brown rice with frozen veggies and an egg\n\n* Cheese tortellini with olive oil, garlic salt, and parm (I buy the family sized bag in the frozen section and divide it up over multiple meals)\n\nSo yeah. All of these things are super cheap to make, there's a couple splurges (avocado, greek yogurt, tofu) but most of these ingredients are dry goods that you can buy really cheaply, in bulk and store forever.

{"title": "Chana Masala, or how to make lunch for 4 days with $8", "selftext": "A friend of mine broke her hand the other day, so I offered to prep some of her meals for the week since she can't easily cook with it. She's vegetarian, so I decided to go with one of my favorite big-batch veggie stews.\n\nChana Masala (at least, the one I know) requires little other than garlic, onions, chickpeas, tomatoes, vegetable oil, and the spices. If you already have the spices and oil (which you should, a little tumeric or cumin goes a loooong way), the other ingredients are among the cheapest of what you'll find at most grocery stores. It keeps well, it's flavorful enough that you don't get bored of it, and you might as well make a huge batch of it since it's mostly just simmering.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 3 medium onions\n* 4-6 cloves garlic\n* 6 medium tomatoes, the cheapest you can find fresh (a large can of peeled tomatoes works well too, but fresh ones taste better)\n* 2 large cans of chickpeas (garbanzo bean)\n* 1/2 cup of vegetable oil (I like canola oil here)\n* Garam masala, turmeric, cumin, and coriander to taste (might need some experimentation to find your preferred mix, but used in roughly equal quantities and almost never more than a teaspoon of each)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Heat the oil on medium-high in a large saucepan or stock pot\n2. Mince the onions as fine as you can, or alternatively just use a food processor.\n3. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, then let them sit.\n4. Sweat the onions with a teaspoon of salt for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently to keep them from sticking. You want them slightly browned and mushy, not just translucent.\n5. Cut the tomatoes into quarters. No need to be too fine, you're going to break them down into the stew.\n6. Deglaze with a bit of water and toss in the spices and garlic. Stir well until the spices are absorbed and none of the onions are stuck to the bottom.\n7. Toss in the tomatoes, mix well, then add 2 cups of water and stir.\n8. Bring the temperature down to a simmer and let it stew for as long as needed for the tomatoes to soften and break down. Usually 15-20 minutes.\n9. Mash the tomatoes in the pot. A potato masher is helpful here, but I've done it with wooden spoons or sturdy ladles too. Stew for a bit longer. I like having a slightly more solid consistency (a bit like applesauce) rather than going for full tomato soup.  Add more water half a cup at a time only if necessary\n10. Once the tomato and onion mixture is to your desired consistency, toss in the chickpeas and stir. Add more water if the tomato mixture doesn't quite cover all the chickpeas.\n11. Let stew for another 10-20 minutes depending on the size of your pot (deeper pots take longer) and desired consistency: I like the chickpeas to still have a bite to them, but some people like them mushy.  Do a bite test every 2 minutes after the first 10 minutes if you're unsure.\n\nAnd there you go.

{"title": "Guys, seriously. The food bank is not that bad.", "selftext": "This is in response to the \"I only have $10/$20/$50 left until the end of the month\" posts. Food banks were designed for people like you - not as a permanent or regular solution, but as a quick fix in a time of need.\n\nMy mom ran a food bank when I was a little kid, so I might be biased. She often brought home food no one would take, like Artichokes, which were my favorite delicacy when they were in season. I had to go to one few times when I was trying to support myself through college. Sometimes it's necessary. You would actually be pretty surprised at the quality, variety, and amount of food you can get. A lot of them receive fresh produce from local farms or gleaner groups. \n\n**Don't consider it a hand-out**, or not being able to support yourself - when you have a little extra money, buy some extra food and donate it, or volunteer a few hours. Social support should not be stigmatized, there should be no shame in needing to use it. Think of it like family - when you help them out you do, when they can help you out, you ask for it without shame. There aren't strings attached, because the hope is that you will get back on your feet and return the favor.\n\nSo, if you are super low on funds and considering the bleak prospects of rice and beans for the next few weeks, please please PLEASE look up your local food bank and pay a visit. Most allow a household to visit 1 time per month, and may require proof that you live in the area (a utility bill to your house, or a licence with your address, should be sufficient). And consider paying back the favor by volunteering or donating next time you're at the grocery store. You don't need to go hungry when there are services available. You deserve the support, as does every person who walks through a food bank's doors.\n\n**tl;dr:** Please don't have too much pride to get help in a time of need!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/3gxce7/guys_seriously_the_food_bank_is_not_that_bad/", "created_utc": 1439517584.0, "score": 2483, "author": "possompants", "num_comments": 229, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/3gxce7/guys_seriously_the_food_bank_is_not_that_bad/", "html_title": ""}

It's a little more expensive than peanut butter, but you usually only need a couple of tablespoons stirred into the soup at the very end, so a little goes a long way.\n\nIt does have a stronger flavor than using hummus as a non-dairy option or cream/milk, but depending on what you\u2019re making, it could work well.\n\nHere\u2019s what I made today:\n\n**Creamy Escarole and Bean Soup:**\n\n* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n* 1 fennel bulb, with stalks and fronds\n* 2 15-ounce cans of butter beans, drained and rinsed\n* 1 head of escarole, roughly chopped\n* 3 tablespoons tahini\n* 2 lemons, divided\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Prepare the fennel:**\n\n1. Cut the stalks from the fennel bulb. Halve the bulb and remove the core. Cut each half into thin wedges. Slice the stalks into very thin rounds. Transfer to a bowl with 6-7 pinches of the fennel fronds.\n\n**Char the fennel bulb:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium heat Add the fennel wedges and cook for 5-7 minutes without turning or until the fennel turns deep golden brown. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Add the beans to the pot and add 6 cups of water. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add crushed red pepper here, if you like. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.\n\n**Cook the escarole:**\n\n1. Add the escarole to the soup and simmer for an additional 10 minutes.\n\n**Prepare the tahini:**\n\n1. In a bowl, whisk together tahini and juice from 1 lemon. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare fennel topping:**\n\n1. To the bowl of sliced fennel stalks, add juice and zest from the remaining lemon. Add 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Remove the soup from the heat and let stand 5 minutes. Stir in the lemon tahini mixture. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and pile the fennel stalk garnish on top of each bowl.

I can taste the basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami) but nothing else really. Fruit drinks taste like sugary water, no fruit detectable. Texture can be really off putting (I tried eating spaghetti today and it was horrendous, like eating flavourless worms). Foods that I normally love are awful. I ate walnuts and spat them out immediately, all I could taste was bitter, no nice nutty roasted aromas, just bitter.\n\nI am a HUGE food lover and I even study Food Innovation. My (temporary) loss of smell has made such a huge impact.\n\nIf anyone has any experience with this, please let me know some tips on how to eat properly. I am so hungry all day long but I'm just scared to stick something in my mouth.

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 5 minutes until softened and beginning to brown.\n* Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n\n#### Cook the Sweet Potato:\n\n* Add the diced sweet potato to the skillet and cook, stirring regularly, for 8-10 minutes until the sweet potato begins to soften and caramelize around the edges.\n* Add the soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, honey, and sesame oil and stir to coat with the sauce.\n* Add the remaining 2 cups water and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.\n* Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes until the sweet potato softens. Season again to taste with salt and pepper.\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Divide the rice between bowls and spoon the broth and sweet potatoes on top. Arrange avocado and chili threads on top and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

What are some easy, filling, and cheap meals with no meat in them?", "selftext": "My usual low-effort dinners (for me and one other) usually consist of whatever meat I can find bulk and cheap and a side of rice or potatoes or something.

{"title": "SNAP/Food Stamps challenge! My sister and I live together, and we eat healthy food on just 100 dollars per month per person, a little more than a dollar per meal. This is how we do it.", "selftext": "I've been reading a lot of articles on people trying to live on food stamps to show how its nearly impossible to eat healthy food using only food stamps, so I figured that I would share how my sister and I manage to do it. We live in a large city in Indiana.\n\nMy sister and I  are both disabled, we live together, and we get $200 in food stamps per month. This is what we buy each month for about 200 bucks. Everything pictured here is only $157.88 - The remaining 42 dollars will be spent at the farmer's market for additional fruits and vegetables as needed throughout the month.\n\n[Majority of everything here](http://i.imgur.com/3a2qEnP.jpg)\n\n[Dried beans](http://i.imgur.com/qCtJTGL.jpg)\n\n[Bread, we have 5 more loaves, not pictured, kept in the freezer](http://i.imgur.com/uarHmlx.jpg)\n\nWe try to waste nothing. We store everything very well and it easily lasts the month. \n\nAll of our vegetable scraps and any vegetable waste is fed to our worms, which fertilize our herb and container garden that we made out of 5 gallon buckets. We just harvested the last tomatoes and peppers, and recently started our fall/winter crop of carrots, kale, swiss chard, green onions, cilantro, peas, radishes, beets, spinach and lettuce. We'll be harvesting the last of our basil this month before the temperatures drop to make pesto for pastas. Pesto keeps well frozen in ziplock freezer bags.\n\nWe grow the majority of our own greens. We've never bought fertilizer. As an added fertilizer, we like to top dress the veggie containers with coffee grounds that we get for free from local coffee shops. \n\nOur garden has virtually no cost. We plant in compost that we make from leaves and other organic matter, which would otherwise just go in the garbage. We also get compost from our local municipality that provides it for free. Its made out of all of the ground up leaves and branches that the city collects.\n\nWe buy our vegetable seeds towards the end of the traditional growing season, the first week of September or late August. We just purchased about 100 seed packets for 3 cents each, they dollar store was selling them for 90 percent off. They kept fine in an airtight container in a dark area.  They don't go bad just because they're a year or two old. Check out the Dollar General's in your area for seeds.  [Here is our haul got this week](http://i.imgur.com/aF2Wqbo.jpg).\n\nFor extra greens, we go to a community garden that grows kale, lettuce and chard and allows anyone to harvest for free. Although this probably makes up less than 5% of our diet, but it is a nice addition.\n\nWe also like to buy food that is in season. We buy a lot of vegetables and fruit at the local farmers market, which gladly accepts food stamps.\n\nWe buy our bread for around $1 dollar per loaf, usually pretty high quality stuff. We buy it at a bakery outlet. You might have one in your area. Usually 50-75% off bakery items.\n\nThe majority of the meat we buy is from Aldi and Meijer. We only buy what is on sale. If it isn't on sale, we don't buy it. The vast majority of the packaged items are from Aldi, which always has very low prices.\n\nWe don't do any couponing really. If we see one in an ad we might use it, but we don't go nuts.\n\nIt can be done. It has taken us a little while to get to this level of balancing our budget and our desire to eat healthy food.  We used to spend the exact same amount of food on ramen noodles, soda, and other \"cheap\" food, and we'd always run out in the middle of the month and feel like shit. \n\nA few thing we are going to stop doing is buying bread and making it ourselves.\n\n\nThe one negative about all of this healthy eating, I suppose, is that it takes while to cook most meals. I like to make a lot of meat on the weekends and use the leftovers in recipes throughout the week. That usually helps cut down on time.\n\nWe like to buy whole chickens because we use the wings, extra bones and the carcass for stock, which makes wonderful soups with our leftover vegetables and beans. We usually use drippings to make a gravy, so that nothing from the bird is wasted.\n\nHere is the breakdown of everything you see in the pictures:\n\nPork Shoulder 15 pounds @ 1.18 per pound    $17.70  - This was extremely cheap. If it was not on sale, I would buy whole chickens instead, which are usually around the same price per pound.\n\nGround Chuck 4.45 pounds @ 2.38 per pound   $11.90 - Also on sale, if this wasn't on sale, I would substitute with ground turkey @ 1.77 per pound.\n\nGround Turkey 4 pounds @ 1.77 per pound      $7.08\n\nChicken Whole 10 pounds @ 0.88 per pound     $8.80\n\nApples, Paula Red, 5 pounds   $2.95\n\nBananas 3.14 pounds  $1.63\n\nLimes 1.5 pounds $1.00\n\nOranges 3 pounds $2.99\n\nPeaches 1.1 pounds $1.32\n\nCantaloupe 3 pounds $1.49\n\nWatermelon 15 pounds $2.99\n\nTomatoes, Roma, 1.4 pounds  $1.11\n\nCucumbers 1 pound  $1.00\n\nCabbage  4.43 pounds $2.12\n\nRadishes 1 pound  $0.59\n\nCarrots 2 pounds $1.58\n\nEggplant 1.18 pounds $1.40\n\nParsley with root 1.29 pounds  $1.66\n\nCelery 1.5 pounds $1.69\n\nOnions Red 3 pounds $1.99\n\nPumpkins 7 pounds  $4\n\nPeas 3 pounds $3.00\n\nMixed vegetables 4 pounds  $4.00\n\nAcorn Squash 2 pounds $2.50 \n\nButtercup Squash 3 pounds $2.50 \n\nButternut Squash 4 pounds $2.50\n\nButternut Squash 4 pounds $2.50 \n\nOnions Sweet 6 pounds $3.00\n\nOnions Yellow 3 pounds $1.59\n\nLentils 1 pound $1.00\n\nSplit Peas 1 pound $1.00\n\nSplit Peas 1 pound $1.00\n\nSplit Peas 1 pound $1.00\n\nKidney Beans 1 pound $1.00\n\nKidney Beans 1 pound $1.00\n\nGarbanzo Beans 1 pound $1.00\n\nBlack Beans 1 pound $1.00\n\nBlack Beans 1 pound $1.00\n\nPinto Beans 1 pound $1.00\n\nRice 5 pounds $2.59\n\nBread, whole grain 8 loaves @ 1.25 each $10\n\nOlive Oil $2.99\n\nMayo, Olive Oil Reduced Fat $1.89\n\nMarmalade, Orange $1.78\n\nPasta Macaroni  2 pounds $1.49\n\nPasta 3 color rotini 1 pound $1.00\n\nPasta 3 color rotini 1 pound $1.00\n\nPasta bow ties 1 pound $1.00\n\nMarinara $1.89\n\nBBQ Sauce $1.25\n\nBBQ Sauce $1.25\n\nDrink Mix(Crystal Lite off brand) $1.69\n\nDrink Mix(Crystal Lite off brand) $1.69\n\nGrill Seasoning $1.25\n\nGrill Seasoning $1.25\n\nSteak Seasoning $1.00\n\nSteak Seasoning $1.00\n\nSalsa Mild $1.25\n\nSalsa Corn and Black Bean $1.25\n\nInstant Oatmeal $1.79\n\nMilk, whole, 1 gallon $2.25\n\nMilk, skim, 1 gallon $2.25\n\nButter 1 pound $1.50\n\nButter 1 pound $1.50\n\nButter 1 pound $1.50\n\nTotal Meat 33.45 pounds @ $45.48 - 0.55 pounds of meat per person per day\n\nTotal Fruit 31.74 pounds @ $14.37 - 0.52 pounds of fruit per person per day\n\nTotal Vegetables 52.8  pounds @ $38.73  - 0.88 pounds of vegetables per person per day\n\nTotal Dried beans/rice  15 pounds @ $12.59 - 0.25 pounds of dried beans/rice per person per day\n\nTotal Bread: $10 - 2 slices per person per day\n\nTotal Other $36.71\n\n**Total Cost: $157.88**\n\nRemaining $42.12 - Will be used for additional fresh fruit and vegetables at the farmers market throughout the month.

Spices, baking stuff etc...  Again these prices are real- taken from actual receipts, walmart's website, or Instacart for our local Price Rite.  I live in New England.\n\nIf you missed week one- here's the link:\n\n[Link to Week One](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xeH025YQqbo37yqrDeZMifLffqfgLqF_zum6o0uSnXc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments on this week:**\n\n* You might notice a few price differences on items between the weeks- some things that were on sale are not now and vice versa.  So OJ wasn't on sale this week, so it's listed as $2 instead of $1 like last week- stuff like that.  Not a typo, just a weekly difference.\n* I included a few of our 'staple' recipes this time that don't have an easily linkable recipe because they have been modified from originals over the years.  They're linked to a second sheet in the spreadsheet doc.  If anything is unclear or you have questions just ask.\n* Chicken thighs are on sale this week for us for $0.88/lb where we are.  Pretty awesome.  Same deal as before- remove the one bone and the skin yourself and save some dollars.\n* A 5lb bag of carrots cost us $1.50 and that's not a sale price.  They're so much cheaper than many other vegetables- even cheaper than potatoes.  Asparagus, brussel sprouts...  carrots are king.  I love how simple the glazed recipe I linked is- you don't need a lot of the sauce either.\n* I'd intended to make something closer to a cassoulet instead of the 15 bean soup, but walmart was cleared out of nearly all other dried beans and lentils, so I just went for it and modified it as I felt.  Could work great with other meats obviously- whatever might be on sale for you.\n* I had a lot of fun making this dinner roll recipe- they're super tasty.  The recipe makes 24 and I will typically freeze 1/2 for another week.  I do have a cheap digital scale to make sure they were all the same weight, but I don't think it would have been a huge deal if I didn't.\n   * The recipe even has a helpful video on how to make them if you're nervous about bread making.\n   * The only place I really deviated is that I started to do the 'pull the seams' underneath to make the tops of the rolls super tight and neat, but by the time I was done with a single row, my first rolls had already started to noticeably prove, so to get uniformity I just quickly balled the rest instead.  They came out fine that way and I didn't have to worry that they wouldn't all be the same size/prove before baking.\n* It's the holidays, so I included a small (12) batch recipe of chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting.  These are great for office parties or family/friend get-togethers. Obviously this isn't a staple or something we make often, but if you're looking for a cheap easy recipe that is a crowd pleaser- there you go!\n   * The cupcake recipe link contains a different frosting recipe- feel free to use that if you don't want peanut butter frosting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese probably won't come exactly a week apart- it's the holidays and we have a baby and these can take a while to get together with exact pricing and lists.  I'm sure there will eventually be a few repeats between weeks as well with some of our staple recipes, but I think that's to be expected.\n\nI have also noticed that there is a lot of interest in this same format at a lower price point- if anyone else would like to repeat this at a $50-$70/wk and likes my format on the google doc- please feel free to take it.  If it helps people out there and someone is willing to repeat the exercise, please do!  I do think there is a lot of interest.\n\nHappy Holidays everyone!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:**  I forgot to put the proviso here that I did with my previous post:  my husband and I are both tall athletic people who workout on average 5x a week (he's actually training for a triathlon) so if it seems like a lot of food- it definitely is!  We also wanted a budget and meal plan that accommodates eating a high level of protein, while trying to minimize our intake of rice/beans/pasta.  Just our personal preferences.\n\n[Link to Week One post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/e7v49c/100wk_food_budget_for_two_week_one_breakdown/)\n\nThank you for the gold, (and the silver!) kind stranger.

{"title": "This Chicken Verde Soup is my new favorite chicken soup. Fewer than 10 ingredients and about 400-500 calories per serving and so comforting.", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/R27UVq6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/R27UVq6.jpg)\n\nThis chicken verde soup is the perfect chilly spring evening soup. The flavors are warming and comforting but the color is a beautiful bright green.\n\nNormally Chicken Verde is made with tomatillos/salsa verde, but since I haven't been shopping as much, I made this green chicken soup with what I had on hand which was lots of cilantro, scallions, and jalape\u00f1os. You still get a very bright green soup but you lose the tartness of the tomatillos. If you have a jar of salsa verde or tomatillos, throw them in the soup! The more greens the better!\n\n***If using tomatillos, simply remove the husks and roast until they blister and then pur\u00e9e and add to the soup right after saut\u00e9ing the onions.***\n\nYou can also add some spinach to this and it would be delicious!\n\nRecipe here originally: [Easy Chicken Verde Soup](https://triedtrue.us/ChickenVerdeSoup)\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 1 hour 15 minutes \n\nServings: 4 \n\nCalories: 413kcal\\*\n\n*\\*Calories will increase if you serve with avocado or bread*\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Large soup pot\n* Fine mesh sieve\n* Large heat-proof bowl\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 3 pounds bone-in chicken\n* 8 cups water more as needed\n* 1 head garlic halved crosswise\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced\n* 2 jalape\u00f1os trimmed and sliced into rounds\n* 1 large bunch cilantro roughly chopped, a pinch reserved for garnish\n* 10 scallions trimmed and minced, a pinch reserved for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### For Serving (Optional):\n\n* Toasted bread\n* Sliced avocado\n* Lime wedges\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Boil the Chicken:\n\n* Place the chicken into a large soup pot and cover with 6-8 cups of water. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the halved garlic head and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes until chicken is completely cooked through and falling off the bone. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl to cool. Remove the garlic and transfer to a plate to cool.\n* Bring the broth back to a boil for 15 minutes until it reduces down a bit. (Note: you can skip this step, but I like a very rich, reduced broth).\n* Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.\n* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and carcass.\n* Pop the garlic cloves out of the paper and discard the paper. With a fork, mash the cloves into a paste and set aside.\n\n#### Prepare the Chicken Verde Soup:\n\n* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the sliced yellow onion and cook for 5 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic paste and cook for 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Pour in reserved chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the cilantro, scallions, jalape\u00f1o, and shredded chicken. Reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the broth is aromatic. Taste and season to your preferences. Add more water if needed.

{"title": "I made a definitive monthly grocery list of food items for a very cheap and balanced diet for about $60-70", "selftext": "I spent an hour yesterday trying to figure how to cut my food budget without compromising on a balanced diet and taste. Here's what I came up with.\n\nRight when you get paid, you'll need to stock up on these items immediately to last you the entire month.\n--\n-BEANS and RICE 8lbs each, for a complete protein and carbs. I recommend brown rice as it's more satiating, has more fibre and vitamins. Also, dry beans are a lot cheaper than canned. Sometimes 4x cheaper. Remember beans and rice absorb a lot of water when cooked. One pound becomes two after boiling.\n-FROZEN VEGGIES, 8lbs (e.g broccoli, mixed vegetables. You need your fibre and micronutrients, i.e. vitamins, minerals)\n\n*These will help with flavor and body:*\n\n-Onions (highly recommend)\n\n-Garlic Cloves (highly recommend)\n\n-Canned tomatoes (recommend)\n\n-Bell peppers (optional)\n\n-Eggplant (optional)\n\n-Carrots (optional)\n\n-Groundnut oil (because it is neutral flavor though slightly pricier than vegetable oils or margarine)\n\n-Salt (obviously)\n\n*Though optional, spices will make the food MUCH more palatable and they can be had for fairly cheap:*\n\n-Cumin (great with beans, recommend)\n\n-Cayenne pepper (hot)\n\n-Black pepper\n\n-Oregano\n\n-Coriander\n\n-Basil\n\nNever eat ramen noodles. They have very little nutritional value and you'll feel like shit all the time, as well as being perpetually hungry as they are fast digesting carbs. And calorie for calorie, they are a lot more expensive than beans and rice, not to mention significantly less nutritious. If you can, shy away from processed foods all together. Nothing is cheaper or more nutritious than beans and rice.\n\nThe above list will provide a perfect balanced diet for very cheap. You do not need animal protein such as meat or dairy. These will mean you have to spend a lot more.\n--\nIf you have money left over and want meat, only buy it on discounts. You may need to check different supermarkets for the best deals.

I remember fondly enjoying you roasted over a charcoal fire in my youth, but unfortunately as my tastes changed you and I became estranged. I was enticed by the convenience of brussels sprouts and the hearty crunch of broccoli.\n\nI was so pleased to find a picture of you on the Seattle Times website of all places, beautifully roasted and braised. It made me remember the good times, and so I went out into the cold and I found you and I introduced you to my favorite Christmas present, a cast iron pan.

{"title": "Warm & Creamy Pasta Fra Diavolo, $1.25/serving", "selftext": "# Skippable intro:\n\nBuckle up buckaroos, I'm here to read you a paragraph about how much my husband and kids love this recipe and how wonderful it is in my rustic farmhouse kitchen. Just kidding, I'm a broke college student and I have no husband or kids hahahah ^(I'm so alone)\n\nI went to a fancy Italian restaurant near me for a work meeting and paid $20 for the Shrimp Pasta Fra Diavolo, because it was the only thing on the menu I could pronounce or afford. It was really frickin good. First thing I did was go home and look up recipes. Turns out it's really cheap and easy to make. Even if you add 1/2 pound of meat, it still comes in around $2.00 for a serving, and I like big servings.\n\nI've included two versions: a fancy equipment version and a broke college student version. The fancy equipment version requires an enameled dutch oven and a potato masher.\n\n# What it is:\n\nA pasta dish with with a very slightly spicy tomato cream sauce. Great for meal prepping. Base recipe is vegetarian, but I've added beef, sausage, chicken, shrimp, and even venison before.\n\n# Ingredients (2-3 servings)\n\n* Whole Peeled Tomatoes, 28oz can\n* 3/4 cup Heavy Whipping Cream\n* 1/2 Onion, yellow or white, not sweet or red\n* 3 cloves Garlic (or go wild)\n* 1 1/2 tsp Italian Seasonings\n* 1/2 tsp Red Pepper Flakes\n* Pasta, I prefer Rotini or Penne\n* (optional) Your choice of chicken, ground beef, ground sausage...\n* (variable) Olive oil, butter, or other fat\n\n# Fancy Instructions (Preferred)\n\n* Preheat your oven to 400F, and put the rack on the bottom.\n* Dice your onion, mince your garlic\n* Enameled dutch oven goes on the stove, medium high heat.\n* Add a few tablespoons of olive oil to the pot as it heats.\n* Drop in diced onions. Stir in the oil, cook for a minute until translucent. Add salt and pepper if you like.\n* Drop in garlic, seasoning and red pepper flakes. Go until the garlic is fragrant.\n* Carefully pour in your can of tomatoes.\n* Stir and allow to come to a simmer.\n* Put the lid on and place into the oven for 40 minutes. We lowered the rack so it would fit.\n* While it's in the oven, this is the time to cook up your meat on the stove if you plan to put some in there.\n* Also, boil a pot of water and make your pasta.\n* Beep, time's up. Take the pot out and open it up. The tomatoes are still whole, but they're really soft.\n* Take the potato masher and gently mash down the tomatoes. Don't splash hot stuff on your arms.\n* Now, stir in the heavy whipping cream. You get to watch the deep roasty red turn into an orange-pink delight. Yuss.\n* If you made meat, stir that in too.\n* Congrats, all done. Serve over the pasta you made. If you're meal prepping, keep the sauce in a separate container from your noodles.\n\n# Broke Version\n\nAight, so you don't have an enameled dutch oven. That means you don't get to roast the whole tomatoes. No sweat. Instead, grab a 28oz can of Crushed Tomatoes. You can cook this in whatever is big enough to hold it all, like a 4 quart pot.\n\n* Don't preheat your oven, you won't need it.\n* Dice your onion, mince your garlic\n* \\[COOKING VESSEL\\] goes on the stove, medium high heat.\n* Add a few tablespoons of olive oil to the pot as it heats.\n* Drop in diced onions. Stir them in the oil, cook for a minute until translucent. Add salt and pepper if you like.\n* Drop in garlic, seasoning and red pepper flakes. Go until the garlic is fragrant.\n* Carefully pour in your can of tomatoes.\n* Add a teaspoon or so of lemon juice or vinegar. This acid will reduce the sweetness of the tomatoes.\n* Stir and allow to come to a simmer.\n* Put the lid on (if you have one) and let simmer for a while, maybe 15 minutes.\n* This is a good time to cook other stuff: boil noodles, cook meat.\n* Remove sauce from heat. Stir in heavy whipping cream.\n* Stir the meat in.\n* Done. Serve over pasta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Questions:\n\n>How did you calculate the cost?\n\nI used the prices from a place called Mall Wart. By my calculations, it should be about $6.50 to buy all the ingredients with no meat, assuming you have no spices, which you probably do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>White bread is spicy to me\n\nThis recipe is just as good without the red pepper flakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Can I make it vegan?\n\nI don't know, I haven't tried. The only thing not vegan is the cream, so if you can find an almond milk thick enough: go for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Is this really healthy?\n\nIt's no salad, but it's way healthier than eating out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What's the recipe source?\n\nI went through a bunch of \"Fra Diavolo\" and \"Vodka\" recipes to come to this one, so I don't have a good answer. Just searching on the interwebs for Pasta Fra Diavolo will give you most of the resources I touched on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why doesn't the fancy recipe have an acid in it?\n\nI find the pre-crushed tomatoes to be sweeter than my roasted ones. The acid only serves to reduce the sweetness of the tomato sauce which leaves behind a roasty, darker flavor. You can add acid to the fancy recipe, or omit the acid from the broke version. It's all up to flavor preferences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The cheap version comes out watery.\n\nAdd a 4oz of tomato paste, or simmer it down for longer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Pictures?\n\nSorry, whenever I make this I eat it too fast to take pics. Just search it, you'll get the idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don't have a knife/pot/cutting board/spoon/etc\n\nAsk your parents, friends, camp counselor, whoever you gotta to get some basic cooking stuff. Thrift shops, yard sales, outlet stores are your friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Will you be my dad?\n\nAww that's sweet.

{"title": "Tofu lovers: freeze and press your (firm) tofu before cooking!", "selftext": "I like to fry my tofu cut in little bite sized pieces after tossing them in potato starch. It goes well with absolutely anything, and is mega crispy! Glazes, sauces, tossed in spices, you name it. It\u2019s so versatile, I got my tofu-averse boyfriend to love it as well.\n\nOnce I buy my tofu I immediately put it in the freezer. When you freeze your tofu (firm/extra firm), the ice crystals form inside, creating sponge-like holes that make it meatier and chewier in texture. It also prevents it from going bad fast. When you thaw it out, the water escapes easier too. Pressing it afterwards to ensure ALL leftover water comes out will enhance that meaty texture. Bonus: no explosions in the frying oil, and it absorbs marinade super fast and well.\n\nI got a tofu press off Amazon and it\u2019s been a staple in my kitchen. I no longer have to deal with mushy tofu; it stays firm and keeps its shape as you toss it and cook it. Highly recommend! It\u2019ll seriously change your perception of tofu!\n\n**EDIT:** How long does it last in the freezer? Up to 6 months. Do I put the entire tofu package in the freezer, water and all? Yes! Thaw it out when you need it. If a lump forms on top of it that\u2019s absolutely normal; it\u2019s just water and the ice expanding the tofu from within. The color may change but that\u2019s normal too, it\u2019ll turn back as it defrosts.\n\nCan I thaw it some method else besides the fridge? I don\u2019t see why not; tofu doesn\u2019t spoil like raw meat!\n\nI use the YARKOR tofu press available on Amazon. Tofu usually takes about 8 hours to defrost in the fridge, but possibly 5 or less when sat on the counter. It takes about an hour and a half to \u201cfully\u201d get the water pressed out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/sg00wu/tofu_lovers_freeze_and_press_your_firm_tofu/", "created_utc": 1643514586.0, "score": 2351, "author": "100percentapplejuice", "num_comments": 157, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/sg00wu/tofu_lovers_freeze_and_press_your_firm_tofu/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Story goes I have a lot of lentils sitting around in my pantry. I have always been a more black bean or Pinto bean kind of guy. Navy or white if I'm feeling it. Heck, I'll throw chickpeas in my salad if I'm feeling fortunate.\n\nToday I wanted a quick midnight snack. I had just finished the last batch of my beans and was quoted to make some more tomorrow. Problem is, all the aforementioned beans above take close to 7 to 8 hours on my crockpot.\n\nI opened a bag of lentils, and saut\u00e9ed an onion. Didn't want to do much chop and prep. It was one of those quick things where I needed empty calories and wasn't too concerned with taste.\n\nAfter sauteeding, I dropped in one cup of lentils. I didn't think much of it.\n\nTended to household chores, took a shower etc.\n\nAll the while, subtly tasting the broth and the beans to see when they were to my desired consistency.\n\nNow, you can't just eat beans like that. From a previous post, I almost always have some white rice on hand. Today I had brown, from last night's dinner.\n\nOnce the lentils were done to my liking, I scooped some out to a hot bed of rice that I microwaved. Put on my favorite show and went to town. Again, not concerned with flavor, just need a belly full of food. It's Christmas time.\n\nAnd wow, I was in for a world of shock.\n\nLentils, onions and salt, make nothing else but a delicious little meal.\n\nOf course if you have more spices and ingredients then I do, you'll end up with a better finished product. But hands down, this is far better then the canned stuff. With such a small bean, the lentils canned are too mushy for my taste.\n\nThis is the bomb dot com.\n\nEnjoy the recipe, although it's super customizable. Lentils, split peas, green, yellow or red, just boiled with onion, or jalape\u00f1o, or any other spice, is amazing.\n\nAnd the great thing is one cup of lentils quadrupled so you have enough for about 6 meals if you plan on portioning or meal prepping.  With an one pound bag, you get about two cups of dried beans, so that's about 12 meals. \n\nAnd you don't even have to use rice. Serve it over pasta, potatoes, quinoa, etc. \n\nServe with hot sauce, hummus or any other sauce and you got yourself a quick meal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/kfczq1/just_lentils_onions_and_salt_make_an_amazing_dish/", "created_utc": 1608261692.0, "score": 2341, "author": "None", "num_comments": 206, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/kfczq1/just_lentils_onions_and_salt_make_an_amazing_dish/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Korean people don't really use ground beef as a main but the sauce base is similar in that it uses soy sauce, sugar, garlic, and sesame oil. I added minced carrots, bell peppers, and black kale stems which really stretches out the meat and makes it healthier. I also tweaked the recipe and italicized the differences so you can see below: \n\nMy recipe: \n\n* 1 pound lean ground beef 90% lean (if you have more meat, double the sauce and save some to add later)\n* *2-3 medium carrots, minced*\n* *3 bell peppers, minced, whatever is on sale*\n* *2 cups of black kale stems, minced, *****optional***\n\n* *6* garlic cloves minced\n* 1/4 cup packed brown sugar\n* 1/4 cup *regular* soy sauce\n* *1/4 cup sriracha sauce*\n* *2-3 tablespoons of oyster sauce*\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil *and add extra when finished*\n* *no ground ginger; 1 tbsp fresh grated ginger is optional*\n* *3-5 red thai chilies minced*\n* 1/4 teaspoon pepper\n* sliced green onions and sesame seeds for garnish\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Mince the carrots and bell peppers and set aside(I like to do this the day before). \n2. In a small bowl, add garlic cloves, brown sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sriracha, pepper, ginger, thai chilies. \n3. In a large pan or wok, brown ground beef. Before the moisture runs out, add the sauce, carrots, and bell peppers. If you like the veggies more crisp, you can add them at the end but for me I add them to stretch out the meat - so I like them soft and barely noticeable. \n4. That's it! Taste at the end and add more oyster sauce, sriracha, sugar, or soy sauce as needed. It seems like a lot, but the veggies add a lot of volume and soak up the salt. \n\nYou can definitely use any veggies (cabbage, green beans, snap peas, bean sprouts come to mind). I freeze them into portions and microwave on top of rice, add a fried egg and more fresh veggies on top.

This is purely based on some observations I have noticed. I think we all have seen the completely drained stores during this pandemic. A little lesson I've learned from past experiences is to always walk to the ethnic aisles or check with the small grocery stores. Granted, this isn't applicable everywhere, but it's always worth a shot.\n\nI currently live in a small Missourian town with a substantial Mexican and Guatemalan population. Several of the local supermarkets have an aisle or two dedicated to just ethnic foods and brands. After being sent on a grocery run last night, I check the \"regular\" canned food aisle; as you can guess, the aisle was looted and left for dead. I walk down *two* aisles to the aisle titled \"Hispanic\", and guess what: nearly all canned products are marked down 20% due to overstock. I decided to pick up some black beans because it was a good deal.\n\nI also swung by a local store which is called La Tienda (for those who do not know, La Tienda means \"The Store\" in Spanish) for some fresh tortillas.

[This is my freezer right now!](https://imgur.com/5vkzmRY)\n\n* You don't have to worry about them going bad, or not eating them in time! Frozen veggies are frozen in their prime state and take a long time to degrade in quality(months, instead of days).\n\n* You can often find mixes that include rice or potatoes, which definitely will help you fill up.\n\n* They save a huge amount of time with chopping veggies, cooking, and  cleanup. \n\n* Great if you're trying to lose weight. No excuses for not eating your veggies!\n\nHere is an example of 3 that I stocked up recently when they were on sale. I really like the ones that include a starch like rice or potatoes, but if you're on a low carb diet you can just get the mixed veggies. [Each one of these bags was 79 cents!](https://i.imgur.com/y6n1akI.jpg)\n\n[This is a meal I made with the roasted potatoes and veggies bag today. Took me all of 5 minutes to make](https://imgur.com/KV2UZFm). I also used half an avocado, 3 egg whites, and half a cup of pinto beans. I make a big batch of beans once a week in my instant pot, and put them in the fridge. They're great to add to any meal and they're super cheap.\n\nTotal cost: $1.49 for 605 calories. \n\nVeggies: 79 cents\n\nHalf cup dry pinto beans: 10 cents\n\n3 egg whites: 30 cents\n\nHalf avocado: 30 cents\n\nSo please guys, do not neglect your frozen veggie aisle of your grocery store. Its a fantastic way to get veggies into your diet. There is no excuse for not being able to afford vegetables!

{"title": "If you lose food to a power outage and have food stamps, most states will reimburse you the cost of lost food.", "selftext": "Last winter we had an unexpected storm that took down trees and power lines in huge numbers. It left some communities without power for weeks.\n\nA number of low income families were hit hard and lost all their refrigerated food and frozen food.\n\nWe found out that most states will replace the lost food on the EBT card within a week or so. This was discovered accidently and many of the workers for these families hadn't even heard of this benefit. So if your worker says no, they don't do that, look into it further because there is a good chance they do, and the workers just aren't aware of it.\n\nWe had to document what food was lost, and the cost of it. If there were reciepts those had to be provided. It had to be a documented and known event (which ours was VERY well documented since it hit a huge portion of the state and specified the communities).  So, if it was just your neighborhood, or just for a day, you may not get the reimbursement.\n\nIt is not encouraged to stretch the truth about what you had because they can track what you normally buy and if it's different. \n\nSo, if you get hit this winter, make a list of what you lost. Also, they will give you the lowest cost for an item. For instance you shop at Whole Foods and buy your meat there. They are not going to pay Whole Food prices, they will pay warehouse store prices.\n\nRegardless of the limitations, most people don't realize this little hint exists. Check with your local agency to be sure.\n\n\nAlso, home owners and those with renters insurance can also claim losses for their food if it's worth it to you.  $70 worth of food probably isn't worth a claim, but $400 is. Again, check with your agency to see if you are covered.\n\nThose with food stamps and renters insurance, you cannot double claim. They check. Don't do it.

{"title": "Caribbean-inspired budget meal plan for a full 7 days", "selftext": "This was written from my experience of aiming **to eat for around $5 a day**, HOWEVER, you can certainly adjust these recipes with substitutions or omissions to make the daily spending even less. I've included a full grocery list at the bottom of this post. Hoping it helps someone, somewhere!\n\nEdit: It was pointed out that this meal plan could use more greens, I can agree with that, but that's an easy fix. Simply buy spinach, broccoli, whatever, and mix it in or eat on the side of these meals or just as an added snack.\n\n**Breakfast Burrito**\n\nBreakfast: Sunday \u2013 Saturday\n\nFor 7 meals:\n\n* 12 eggs\n* 3 potatoes\n* 1 lb. sausage / 500g\n* 14 tortillas\n\nBreakfast burritos are my favorite! You may recall a similar recipe I used before with only eggs and potatoes, this one is a more hearty version.\n\nScramble the eggs in a pan, and also cook the sausage thoroughly in a pan (breaking into small pieces). Shred the potatoes (using a cheese grater works perfectly) and cooking over high heat until they are golden and crisp. I like to cook my potatoes like pancakes, this makes the outside crispy but the inside soft.\n\nWhen everything is finished cooking, fill each tortilla with some of everything, roll it up, and store it in the freezer. You can store it in plastic wrap, aluminum foil or just a regular Ziploc bag.\n\nEach morning, pop 2 in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes and enjoy.\n\n\\*Note: Cool down your ingredients before constructing your burritos, this will prevent it from becoming soggy when you reheat.\n\n**Caribbean Rice and Beans with Meat**\n\nLunch: Sunday \u2013 Wednesday\n\nFor 4 meals:\n\n* 2 garlic cloves\n* 1 onion\n* 2 tsp. creole spice (or cajun seasoning) / 12ml\n* 2 cups uncooked rice / 4.7dl\n* 13.5 oz. can coconut milk / 380g\n* 15.5 oz. can kidney beans / 440g\n* 2 1/4 cups chicken broth / 5.3dl\n* 3 chicken breasts (or meat of your choice)\n\nAs a heads up, you can make chicken broth with water 2 and chicken bouillon cubes if that\u2019s more convenient for you.\n\nFirst, wash your rice until the water runs clear and then drain.\n\nIn a saucepan over medium-high heat, add some oil or butter, then add diced onions and garlic. Saut\u00e9 for about a minute. Stir in the rice, followed by the kidney beans, and keeping stirring around for about 2 minutes. Then add coconut milk, chicken broth, creole spice, and bring this to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and lit it simmer with a lid on top.\n\nLet this cook for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is cooked, and stir occasionally to prevent the sides/bottom from burning.\n\nWhile this is cooking, you can prepare the chicken breasts. Because the rice and bean dish is so tasty on its own, just cooking the chicken with salt and pepper is plenty. Chop the chicken into strips and then divvy it up into 4 days of meals with the Caribbean rice and beans.\n\n**Honduran Baleadas (Street Tacos)**\n\nLunch: Thursday \u2013 Saturday\n\nFor 3 meals:\n\n* 6 large tortillas\n* 4 cups refried beans / 9.5dl\n* 3 cups cheese / 7dl\n* 1 cup sour cream (or a salsa) / 2.4dl\n* 2 small tomatoes\n\nSpread warmed-up refried beans evenly over a warm tortilla. Sprinkle cheese and drizzle sour cream. Top with sliced tomatoes and any other toppings. Fold in half like a taco! Eat 2 for each meal.\n\nI think if you sprinkled some of the previous creole seasoning it would be very tasty, too! I haven\u2019t tried doing that, so I\u2019m not sure, but it sounds good.\n\n**Jamaican Jerk Chicken Chili**\n\nDinner: Sunday \u2013 Wednesday\n\nFor 4 meals:\n\n* 1 lb. boneless chicken / 500g\n* 1 bunch green onion\n* 1 onion\n* 1 bell pepper\n* 1 spicy pepper (jalepeno, habanero, etc.)\n* 15.5 oz. kidney beans / 440g\n* 15.5 oz. black beans / 440g\n* 15.5 oz. canned crushed tomatoes / 440g\n* 3 cloves garlic\n* 1 cup Jamaican jerk marinade / 2.4dl\n\nThese aren\u2019t necessary, but it would make it taste out of this world, add: 1 tbsp. brown sugar, 2 tsp. thyme, 2 tsp. cumin, 2 tsp. allspice, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.\n\nYou can either cook this in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours, low for 6-8 hours, or in a large pot on the stove for about 1.5 hours on a simmer.\n\nBasically, just dump everything into the pot and let it cook. Stir it around a few times, and add salt and pepper to your liking. You can eat this as-is, with crackers, avocado or rice\u2026 whatever you feel like!\n\nIf you end up making more than 4 portions, you can freeze the rest and save for when you\u2019re rushed for time.\n\n**Ropa Vieja (Cuban Beef Stew)**\n\nDinner: Thursday \u2013 Saturday\n\nFor 3 meals:\n\n* 1 lb. beef stew meat (1-inch cubes) / 500g\n* 2 bell peppers\n* 5 garlic cloves\n* 30 oz. cans crushed tomatoes / 850g\n* 1.5 cups cooked rice / 3.5dl\n\nAgain, not necessary, but you can also add: 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1/2 tsp. paprika.\n\nThis can also be done the slow cooker route or on the stove with the same guidelines as before.\n\nBefore you dump everything in a large pot, you\u2019ll want to sear your beef and bell peppers. Do this by heating oil in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the beef and allow all outer edges to brown. Do not worry about the meat being cooked or not. Once done, transfer to a big pot or slow cooker.\n\nSear bell peppers strips in the pan, cooking just until they soften slightly.\n\nAdd the bell peppers and all remaining ingredients into a pot. Let this cook until the beef is tender and you can shred it using 2 forks. Mix it all together and serve with cooked rice.\n\n**Bliss Bars**\n\nSnacks: Sunday \u2013 Saturday\n\nFor 7 snacks:\n\n* 1 cup almonds / 2.4dl\n* 2 cups dates / 4.7dl\n* 1 1/2 cup coconut flakes / 3.5dl\n* 1/3 cup cocoa powder / 80ml\n* water as needed\n\nIf using whole almonds, you will need to blend them or put them in a processor to break them down. If you are using sliced or slivered almonds, you can skip this step.\n\nIn a blender or processor, add all your ingredients (except water) and blend until they create a texture that\u2019s smooth and clumps together. You may need to add a tablespoon (18ml) of water at a time to achieve this, depending on how much moisture your dates contain.\n\nLine a 8\u00d78 baking pan with parchment paper and press the mixture into the pan. Flatten and smooth the mixture, then pop in the fridge for at least 20 minutes.\n\nAfter that, you can slice them into bars and store in the fridge for up to 1 week (or in the freezer if you want to store them longer).\n\n[Here is a printable grocery list for easy planning!](https://budgetmealplanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/grocery-list-10.png)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/cyffg6/caribbeaninspired_budget_meal_plan_for_a_full_7/", "created_utc": 1567371270.0, "score": 2288, "author": "diannamallen", "num_comments": 102, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/cyffg6/caribbeaninspired_budget_meal_plan_for_a_full_7/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Regular white vinegar, regular mustard, and vegetable oil work fine for the dressing (although it will be better if you splurge on some olive oil), and any lettuce can replace the arugula.

Thin cubes with water when using later.\n\n\n--Freeze raw hamburger meat in 1 lb. portions. When cooking, drain tallow (fat) and refrigerate for use later in the month as a butter substitute for creating a roux for soups.\n\n\n--Wash, dry, then store fresh cilantro and parsley in covered jar in fridge with 1 inch of water on bottom. Should last all month this way.\n\n\n--Pickle onions (use in salads or as topping)\n\n\n--Slice up green onions that will not be used in first week, freeze on a baking sheet, then place in bag in freezer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly prep will vary based on the recipes you choose. Many foods, like french toast and quiche, freeze well so you can just make them the first week then eat from the freezer other weeks. You should plan to buy some fresh veggies and lettuce each week.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrocery List \n\n\nThis plan assumes you have a decent set of spices (salt, curry powder, tumeric, paprika, pepper, ginger, garlic powder, bay leaves, cumin, dill, thyme, parsley and basil) pantry staples (cornstarch, baking powder, brown sugar) and condiments (mustard, ketchup, worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, lemon or lime juice etc...). If you don't have them, many spices and condiments can be picked up at the dollar store without too much additional cost. If you set aside a few dollars each month, you can gradually build a pantry.

{"title": "Breakfast Rice Bowl Recipes to use up leftover rice (they'd make good balanced, satisfying and simple lunches as well)", "selftext": "Somehow we always have left over rice from dinner, and I wanted to use up left over food to reduce our food waste this week so I've been experimenting with rice bowl breakfasts and these are the ones I made this week: **Spicy salmon egg scramble, soft boiled egg and avocado, miso sesame silken tofu, radish and spam musubi, steamed tomato and shrimp and edamame meat floss and fermented bean curd**\n\n[This is what they looked like + how to put them together! (I filmed the process each morning this week)](https://youtu.be/d6GX3ut6nYs)\n\nI hope it can give you some inspiration for how to use up your rice! I'm a huge savoury breakfast person so these were really delicious \n\n*Best way to reheat left over cold rice:*\n\n\\- Scoop out what you want to eat into your bowl, spoon 1 or two spoons of water onto the rice and microwave for 1 minute. Use chopsticks to fluff it up and it'll pretty much be back to freshly cooked!\n\n1. **Miso Sesame Silken Tofu Rice Bowl**\n\nIngredients: A slice of silken tofu, cucumber slices and a miso sesame sauce (1tsp miso paste, 1tsp sesame paste or peanut butter to substitute, glug of soy sauce and 2tsp of water - add to a small bowl and mix it all together)\n\nOnto the heated rice, add the cube of tofu, cucumber and pour on the sauce. You can add some spring onions, sesame and bonito if you have it on hand!\n\n2. **Radish and Spam Musubi**\n\nIngredients: Slice of spam, sliced radishes, soy sauce and sugar (optional wasabi)\n\nCube the slice of spam and fry in a little oil until golden brown, add soy sauce over all of the spam and a spoon of sugar, mix well so the sugar and soy sauce is all mixed together and leave to caramelise for about 1-2 minutes. Arrange the sliced radishes onto the heated rice, add the spam musubi and sesame and wasabi if you're into those flavours.\n\n3. **Spicy Smoked Salmon Egg Scramble**\n\nIngredients: 1 egg, 1tsp of milk, smoked salmon slice, black pepper, pinch of salt and siracha (optional coriander)\n\nWhisk the egg, milk, salmon, salt and black pepper together. Into a frying pan on low heat add the whisked egg and create big curds by using a flat spatula and big strokes. Onto the hot rice, add siracha or other hot sauces, add the egg scramble and top with more siracha and coriander.\n\n4. **Soft boiled Egg and Avocado**\n\nIngredients: 1 egg, 1/2 avocado (optional soy sauce or salt, black pepper and furikake)\n\nAdd a room temperature egg into boiling water and boil for 7 minutes. Remove and run under cold water or an ice bath. Peel the egg and cut in half. Cut 1/2 an avocado and slice. Onto the hot rice, add black pepper and furikake if you have it. Top with the egg and avocado - add soy sauce or salt to your preference.\n\n5. **Edamame, Meat Floss and Fermented Bean Curd**\n\nIngredients: Handful edamame, meat floss and fermented bean curd (I like spicy but use which ever you like)\n\nBoil your edamame and add it, the meat floss and the bean curd cube onto the hot rice. Mix it together and enjoy!\n\n6. **Steamed Tomato and Crispy Shrimp**\n\nIngredients: 1 tomato, Chinese 'dried shrimp', soy sauce or salt and optional green onions\n\nCut a cross on top of a tomato and steam for 15-20 minutes. Do this the night before so morning prep is easy. Cut the tomato in half (or use the whole thing), place onto COLD rice and microwave as instructed above to reheat the whole thing together. Crisp up the shrimp in a pan until golden (no oil needed), you could also just use eggs, sausage, cheese, fish, whatever protein you want.

All macros are met, calories turned out much closer to 2000/day than I expected for not having planned anything.\n\nGeneral strategy- \n\nget whole grain and beans from the bulk bins\n\nuse beans, peas, and pb for protein\n\nuse whole grain and pasta for carbs\n\nget lots of fruits and veggies that somewhat go together, whatever's on sale. Don't bother with ones you don't like.\n\nMicronutrients take care of themselves when in non-isolated/refined foods, so don't stress over them\n\nThings like peanut butter and pasta don't need really need ingredients other than peanuts and durum wheat, so get it simple if you can.\nLet me know if you come up with a meal plan along the same lines, I'd love to see it.\n\nA large part of why people use fast food is that they don't have time for cooking, so hopefully this can help to show that it's possible to eat simply, healthily, and lazily with time and budget restrictions. If you don't have a Sprouts I'd go to Aldi, maybe WalMart. \n\nIf you have a much smaller budget and many more mouths to feed I'd recommend getting the dry & canned ingredients from a local food pantry (many don't have income requirements) and only getting the fresh fruit and veg on sale wherever it's convenient. \n\nRandom disclaimer, I'm a big fan of GMOs and conventionally grown food for their practical effects in fighting world hunger (Golden rice for vit A deficiencies, etc). GMO trademarking and business in the US aren't so much my thing. \n\nI think this could be easily made to fit other dietary needs such as Celiac without much alteration or price difference.\n\nsmall edit- Frozen food is 500% okay, it won't change much of anything and is sometimes cheaper. It just so happened that it was cheaper to get fresh with the current sales. Canned is fine too, but please love yourself and avoid canned green beans.

Main ingredients cost right around $40.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther ingredients:\n\n* Few tablespoons of olive oil\n* An optional pound of rice\n* Optional peanuts\n* Marinade for chicken\n* Hot sauce\n* Ranch\n* Seasoning\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPreparation couldn't be easier:\n\n* Cut the chicken breasts into small bite sized pieces, marinate and then cook\n* While chicken is cooking, boil water to cook the pasta\n* While water is boiling and pasta is cooking, dump all of the frozen vegetables into your biggest mixing bowls and try to get an even amount of all vegetables in each bowl\n* Once pasta is cooked, drain it, then dump into the mixing bowls\n* Once chicken is done, drain it, then dump into the mixing bowls\n* Dump the shredded cheese into the mixing bowls\n* STIR... this is actually the longest step, it takes me a good 30 minutes of dumping in ingredients, stirring, and recombining stuff in each bowl so they all look like they have the same ratio of all the ingredients\n* Scoop the mixture into food storage containers to place in the freezer\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTES:\n\nEach container in the picture holds 2 pounds of food.  I have 1 extra empty container to split the first container into 2 meals, then wash and reuse the containers to split all of them when it's lunch time.\n\nAdd the hot sauce, ranch, and seasoning just before heating and eating it.  I've tried to add it during the prep but it makes everything very soggy.\n\nThe olive oil can be drizzled over the mixing bowls once you dump the pasta in.  It's healthy and makes it easier to stir.\n\nSometimes I'll add a pound of rice to get a little more carbs.  If pasta isn't your thing you could easily substitute for all rice, or leave out the carbs altogether.\n\nAdding a pound of peanuts gives it a little crunch, they're the cheapest nut, and it adds more protein and fat if that's what is feels like it's lacking.\n\nObviously the costs are approximate, but you can see that the \"other ingredients\" purchased can last through multiple rounds of this meal prep, so I'm very comfortable with the assumption that they add less than $10 to the cost per batch.  And 25 meals for under $50 keeps it solidly under $2/meal.\n\nFor frozen vegetables, always get chopped versions of whatever.  Whole veggies like broccoli florets take up a big volume and throw off the ability to get 2 pounds per container.  If freezer space is at a premium, the more compact the better.\n\nMy go-to for frozen veggies are broccoli, spinach, kale, cauliflower, carrots, bell peppers, and onions.  I recommend to never use mushrooms or peas, because they will make everything taste like mushrooms or peas.\n\nThe image of mine is 28 meals because I added an extra pound of vegetables, a pound of peanuts, and I packed them *slightly* under 1 pound/meal.\n\nIf you use the exact ratios of everything above and make 25 pounds of food, the % of the meal is easy to determine... Just multiple # pounds x 4:\n\n52% vegetables\n\n20% meat\n\n20% dairy\n\n8% carbs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/al0wqm/5_weeks_of_lunches_for_under_2each_and_2_hours/", "created_utc": 1548774649.0, "score": 2190, "author": "Occams-Toothbrush", "num_comments": 200, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/al0wqm/5_weeks_of_lunches_for_under_2each_and_2_hours/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "So I finally tried making banana \"ice cream\" and I was pleasantly surprised", "selftext": "So I had seen this floating around on multiple different health food blogs and YouTube channels (and probably on this subreddit as well) and I always thought it sounded like one of those healthy versions of unhealthy foods that pretends like it's going to be as good as the original and never is. But I've been trying to kick my bad snack habit and I had some overripe bananas lying around, so I thought, worst case scenario, I've wasted like 50\u00a2 worth of bananas so what the heck. This was my journey.\n\nIngredients\n\n3-4 (or however many you have, it definitely makes less than you think it will) ripe/overripe bananas\n\nFlavoring of your choosing (I used a spoonful of peanut butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon, but I imagine it might be good with a bit of cocoa powder or really whatever you think would taste good)\n\nA bit of milk to thin as needed (I used whole milk cuz I had it)\n\nThe steps\n\nThe night before, I peeled the bananas, cut them into 2-3\" pieces and put them in a freezer bag to freeze over night.\n\nOnce they were frozen, I put them in the blender and blended until I got a good smooth consistency (this is the part where you can add a dash of milk to help the process along). This was a surprisingly challenging step, but I think if you have a less terrible blender than I do, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If your blender is as old and tired as mine, I recommend throwing in one chunk at a time and blending it before throwing in the next. Also, don't use an immersion blender (my mom thought this might be an easier solution) because they aren't always equipped to deal with frozen fruit and you snap off the blade on a hard banana (which I totally definitely did not do, thus breaking my mom's favorite piece of kitchen equipment /s).\n\nAnyway, once the bananas are nice and smooth, throw in whatever extras you want (or just go plain, if you really like bananas), and you're done. You can eat it as is or put it in a Tupperware and dip in whenever you want.\n\nMy feelings\n\nI was really happy with this recipe. Super easy (minus the blending mishaps) and the result was delicious. It might not be exactly like ice cream, but it's good enough to sate that craving, and it's one of the few healthy substitute snacks that I've found myself really enjoying. I suppose it's really just a smoothie with less liquid in it, but I found the final product to be much more satisfying than any smoothie I've made for myself.\n\nAnyways, I'd be interested to know how many other people have tried this, and what extra flavors you've thrown in. It seems to me like the bananas could be a good base for a lot of different ingredients.\n\nETA: As some people have pointed out, bananas do still have a lot of calories, so watch out for that if you make this. I guess I was more making this as an alternative for ice cream that doesn't make me feel gross afterwards from all the dairy. It's also good if you're just trying to cut down on animal products in general. And you can also make it with other fruits! Someone suggested peaches, but a lot of frozen fruits can make a nice sorbet sort of situation.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/cjfuu8/so_i_finally_tried_making_banana_ice_cream_and_i/", "created_utc": 1564427517.0, "score": 2169, "author": "None", "num_comments": 171, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/cjfuu8/so_i_finally_tried_making_banana_ice_cream_and_i/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "As a student in quarantine, I've gained a deep appreciation of Semolina Pudding.", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster, so please be kind :)\n\nSoft Wheat Semolina is a powdery-grainy thingy. Best way I can describe it. The point is, it's readily available here in Germany and costs very little. \n\nI like the pudding because I can make it in 10-ish minutes with only a pot, whisk and cup getting dirty. It also has only 3 ingredients, which are non-perishable and great to stock up on. The dish has around 400kcal and 10,5g of Protein just in the Milk.\n\nI eat it hot as a breakfast porridge, but all leftovers turn into a great dessert if you chuck them in the fridge for a few hours. It keeps me full for a very long time, apparently because of the slow releasing energy in the wheat?\n\nThe ingredients are:\n\n- 40g Soft Wheat Semolina (500g cost 0,39\u20ac)\n\n - 300ml UHT Milk, 1.5% fat (1L costs 0,65\u20ac) \n\n- A tablespoon/ 15-20g of White sugar (1kg costs 0,75\u20ac)\n\n-> a total of 0,24\u20ac per serving\n\nOptional ingredients:\n\n- 1 packet Vanilla Sugar (10 packets cost 0,35\u20ac)\n\n - any fresh or canned fruit, I like Peaches Cherries and Pineapple (1 can of fruit usually costs around 1,50\u20ac for me)\n\n\n(all prices are based on actual products I can order from REWE right now - and REWE is one of the more premium supermarkets around here. Getting everything from Aldi or Lidl would be cheaper.)\n\n\nHow to make it:\n\n- Measure out the 40g of Semolina, set aside.\n\n- Put the milk and sugar in a small sauce pot and gently warm it up while continuously stirring. Get the milk as close to boiling as you feel comfortable.\n\n- Take the pot off the heat, dump in the Semolina, whisk for like a minute. If you feel like the milk could take some more heat, put the pot back on the stove while whisking, until it almost boils again. This gives a firmer consistency.\n\n- Let rest for a few minutes. It will get thicker the longer you let it rest.\n\n- (optional) Put it an a bowl, throw some fruit, nuts, sugar, Coco powder, Nutella or whatever you like on top.\n\nI once had some salted peanuts on it and it was amazing. If you wanna add Protein powder, just weigh it out in the same cup as the Semolina and whisk it in at the same time (adjust the sugar tho).\n\n\n\nHere's a pic of the one I made this morning : https://imgur.com/aEp9fnH\n\nOf course served in a classy chipped Ikea bowl with canned sour cherries.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nedit: as per request, an image of my Semolina box: https://imgur.com/apyPvX4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gataaz/as_a_student_in_quarantine_ive_gained_a_deep/", "created_utc": 1588243093.0, "score": 2155, "author": "Pthn", "num_comments": 179, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gataaz/as_a_student_in_quarantine_ive_gained_a_deep/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

The prototypical meal prep is essentially batch-cooking 4-5 lunches on a Sunday to be eaten throughout the work or school week, but it can go all the way from washing and pre-chopping vegetables in advance, on up to cooking and freezing an entire month's worth of meals or more for the whole family. Meal prepping helps reduce food waste from perishable ingredients going unused, it helps save money, it's way healthier for you than frozen ready meals loaded with sodium and mystery chemicals or fat-laden takeout, and it frees up your time throughout the week, not just in actual cooking, but cleaning, too. If you roast all of your meat for the week in one batch, you only have to fire up the oven/stove and clean your pan and prep area once, instead of every time you want meat.\n\nNot sure where to start? Pick your most inconvenient meal and make a week of portions for it. Get used to the time investment needed to cook just that one meal for a whole week and practice picking recipes and cooking in bulk before adding more meals.\n\n* Lunch: Most people meal prep grab-and-go lunches to take to work or school, so that they don't have to cobble together a meal the night before when they're probably tired or the morning of when they're trying to rush out the door, and it helps save money not buying fattening takeout.\n* Breakfast: Who really wants to be cooking first thing in the morning when you gotta make it to work/class on time? Meal prepping breakfast can also be an opportunity to make breakfasts to eat on the go, or once you're at work.\n* Dinner: Hungry and too tired to cook after being away at work/school all day? Pre-cook dinner so that all you have to do is reheat the food and eat.\n* Snacks: Eating healthy snacks is much easier if those snacks are already washed and cut and ready to eat, or at least portioned so you don't devour the whole bag. It'll also keep you away from the vending machine.\n* Prepwork: Some people \"meal prep\" by performing prepwork to make later cooking efforts easier. For instance, they pre-chop vegetables so they're ready to cook or eat raw later; put together slow cooker meals in gallon freezer bags out of raw meat, chopped vegetables, seasonings, and whatever else that can just be tipped into a slow cooker on demand; assemble and freeze casseroles so they're ready to be baked; cook large pots of stock to be portioned and frozen; or freeze fruit and vegetables in smoothie packets.\n\n----\n\n**HOW DO I GET STARTED?**\n\n* A quick and dirty tip for putting together balanced meals is to simply mix and match, in descending order of quantity, a vegetable, protein, and starch. Corn and potatoes are technically vegetables, yes, but nutritionally, they have more in common with starches and carbs like rice or pasta. Broccoli, chicken, and whole grain pasta. Asparagus, pork, and rice. Kale, beans, and quinoa. Bell peppers, eggs, and potatoes. Raw vegetables with dip, lunch meat, and crackers. Play around with it a bit.\n* Conservatively, cooked food will keep in the fridge for at least three days after the day of cooking. If you cook on Sunday, food meant to be eaten through Wednesday will be fine in the fridge, but food for Thursday and beyond should be either prepared and cooked after Sunday, or stored in the freezer. This \"three day rule\" is a starting point that comes from the [USDA](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/leftovers-and-food-safety#_Store) and is a deliberately conservative guideline intended to be safe for immunocompromised folks, young children, the elderly, and the like. If you believe your food keeps in the fridge for longer than three days, you are welcome to do as you wish, but you do so at your own risk. Personally, I've been eating five, six, seven, even eight and nine day old refrigerated home-cooked leftovers and have never gotten sick, even \"risky\" stuff like seafood and rice.\n* If you're just starting out and aren't sure yet if meal prepping is for you, store your food in whatever containers you already have, so long as they have lids that seal relatively airtight. You can use leftover takeout containers or upcycle commercial food packaging, such as Cool Whip containers (although not all of these can go in the microwave; Talenti gelato jars will melt, for instance). If you don't have any containers at all, many brick-and-mortar grocery stores in addition to Amazon now sell inexpensive plastic \"meal prep containers\" with around 2-4 cup capacities that are designed to fit a single meal. Yes, plastic isn't ideal, but it's lightweight, cheaper than glass or metal, and won't shatter into dangerous shards, making it safer for children. Current research has found that simply storing food in plastic is perfectly safe; it's just reheating food in plastic that can pose a risk, and that's easily remedied by scooping your food into a bowl or plate and microwaving it there.\n* If you're interested in bulk-preparing full meals, go for recipes that are easy to scale up. A simple saute of diced meat and vegetables cooked in a skillet might be a perfectly good and quick meal for one or two, but it's hard to scale that up into a whole week's worth of food because most people's frying pans just can't fit that much food at once, leading to you babysitting a pan for possibly multiple hours as you cook each portion. A good place to start is recipes aimed at busy families, because those are often relatively quick and make 4-6 portions. Some recipe types to look for that can be good time-savers include:\n * Casseroles. There's a reason they're so popular with families- a typical casserole will have 6-8 portions, include meat, vegetables, and a carb, and most are cooked in the oven, so you don't have to constantly stir or babysit it and can go do other things. A lifesaver for a busy family with kids, and great for meal preppers. Casseroles are also an easy way to use up leftover meat and vegetables.\n * One-pot meals. You cook everything in a single big stockpot, which reduces cleanup and is great for people stuck with only one stove burner, and most one-pot meals will make at least four portions and will include protein, vegetables, and carbs all in one dish. A true one-pot meal will have you cook everything together at roughly the same time, but even a faux one-pot meal where you cook the protein and remove it, cook the vegetables and remove them, etc., and combine them all back together at the end can still be very convenient. Most soups are also one-pot meals, and can be very hearty with lots of meat and vegetables.\n * Sheet pan meals. Most standard US ovens can fit a 19\"x13\" sheet pan, which will fit a lot of food, as much as two pounds of vegetables. The basic crux of a sheet pan meal is that you arrange a bunch of vegetables and chopped up pieces of meat on a sheet pan with seasonings and a little oil, allowing plenty of space so the food can properly roast and get a bit charred instead of steaming, then oven-roast them all together. Add the vegetables that take the longest to cook to the pan first, and add other vegetables and meat that take less time later on.\n * Slow cooker meals. Most slow cookers come in large capacities, which means they can make a lot of food. Low and slow is how many cheap cuts of meat need to be cooked, which will also help you save money. And very little can beat the convenience of being able to dump a bunch of meat, vegetables, broth, and seasonings in the slow cooker, turn it on, and come back 8-12 hours later to enough food to feed you for a week.\n* Not everybody has the same levels of tolerance for what foods they'll consider \"good\" for meal prep, whether refrigerated for as long as 4-5 days after preparation, or portioned and frozen. While there are some foods that a lot of us might be able to agree do (chili, bread, meat, potstickers, etc.) and don't freeze or hold up well as leftovers (frozen leafy greens, leftover sushi or carbonara, etc.), most of the rest is down to personal preference, and in the case of freezing, even \"ruined\" foods are just unappetizing, not unsafe. There are lots of foods I'll tolerate as long as the flavor can be perked up with some salt+pepper after reheating and the texture isn't too tough to eat or just complete oatmeal-like mush. Meal prepping does require at least some level of understanding that the food is not going to taste quite as good as when it was fresh, and the ability to eat just for fuel at least some of the time. If you're not really much of a leftovers person and/or have a tendency to be sensitive to changes in texture or flavor, be prepared to do some testing with small amounts of your food(s) and recipe(s) of choice, or even to just stick to prepping ingredients for later cooking.\n* There are some legitimate situations when meal prep, or at least the traditional \"full meal, cook once and eat all week\" type, might not be the best option. If you genuinely enjoy the process of cooking every day or have specific tastes that change too often to do much cooking or prep work in advance, then regular meal prepping might not be for you. One thing that a lot of people do for work lunches is that they will cook two or more portions of some dish for dinner, then eat one and pack up the other one for the next day's lunch; if you're perfectly satisfied doing that, then meal prepping might not be necessary. If your job or school provides meals with options that work with your tastes, diet/health goals, and budget, it might be more cost-effective to just eat what's provided for you.\n* Try not to meal prep with any primary ingredient, appliance, or major cooking technique that you're not familiar with. If you make a mistake or simply find out that you don't even like the food or how you prepared it, you don't want there to be a whole week or more of that food lying around to choke down.\n* Remember that meal prepping doesn't mean you can never eat fresh food again, or go out to eat. A lot of meal preppers have designated times for getting takeout, they cook fresh food on days off, or they keep premade ready meals such as frozen pizza on hand.\n\n----\n\n**ASSORTED TRICKS**\n\n* You can actually cook crispy fried foods and pack them in a lunch, and still have them be crispy the next day- cook the food to your preferred level of doneness, then once it's ready to eat, place the food on a plate or rack and cool it uncovered in the refrigerator, so that steam can escape and not make the food soggy. Once it's completely cold, then you can place it into a container, even alongside \"wet\" foods as long as the fried food isn't directly sitting in moisture. Unless you have access to an air fryer, toaster oven, or similar wherever you'll be eating your meal, you will not be able to reheat the food and keep it crispy, but it will still be crispy when cold. I've done this with stuff like frozen chicken fingers and it was absolute magic to bite into a perfectly crispy and juicy (albeit cold) chicken finger the next day.\n* Tips for reheating:\n * Technically, the \"best\" ways to reheat food are on the stove with a pan and some oil, or an oven (conventional, toaster oven, or convection/air fryer).\n * Cream, milk, and cheese-based dishes can reheat better if a splash of milk and a pat of butter is added to the top before reheating. Stir after heating to incorporate the milk.\n * A gentler way to microwave food is to reduce the microwave's power and reheat for a longer period of time. Instead of 90 seconds at full power, try 2-3 minutes at 50% power.\n * You can meal prep seafood in bowl meals and even eat it warm without getting flack from those around you by removing the seafood, reheating everything else, and then breaking up and stirring the seafood into the hot food, so it warms through with radiant heat. This tactic also works for steak or other red meat that you want to keep below well-done, or chicken or other meats that you don't want to overcook, provided that you slice the meat into relatively small and/or thin pieces that will warm through quickly. You can also do the same for any meal that you want to have both warm and cold components, such as a warm bowl meal topped with fresh crunchy vegetables. I like to place the \"no-reheat\" component(s) in a small plastic-wrapped packet inside the container, but you could also use separate containers.\n* If you're having trouble figuring out what to make for breakfast, or don't like or can't eat traditional western/American breakfast foods, remember that the whole concept of \"breakfast food\" is literally a social construct. There's nothing special about eggs or pancakes or bacon or whatever that makes them do anything for you in the morning that other foods can't also accomplish. Many non-Western cultures don't even have a concept of food that is only eaten for breakfast; they just eat whatever will get them going for the day. There is nothing stopping you from eating something like a salad or soup or last night's dinner leftovers for breakfast as long as it fits your macros and goals.\n* If you're making freezer meals in preparation for a coming baby, one tip I've heard from many parents is that they went for foods that can be eaten one-handed while the other hand/arm is occupied doing other things, like holding the baby or doing housework. Think burritos, wraps, things in the \"filled dumpling\" family (hand pies, potstickers, empanadas, bao buns, pierogies, etc.), finger foods, that sort of thing.\n* Having trouble with chicken drying out during reheating, or with \"warmed over\" flavor? Try these ideas:\n * Rule Zero is to not overcook the chicken, because food will cook a little during reheating, which can take meat that was only a little overcooked when it was fresh to way overcooked. Buy a meat thermometer if you don't have one already and remove the chicken from the heat as soon as the thickest part hits 165 F/74 C. Some even remove chicken from heat when it's a few degrees *below* 165, because the meat will continue cooking from its own residual heat as it rests.\n * Give the chicken a stronger flavor. Try marinating it before cooking, or dousing it in a sauce, or cooking with it in soups, stews, or one-pot meals.\n * If you're experiencing this problem with chicken breasts, try using boneless skinless thighs instead, which have a lot of dark meat. Dark meat has a stronger flavor than white meat breasts that can help overrule \"warmed over\" flavor, and a higher fat content that helps prevent it from drying out or getting tough as easily if it does wind up going past 165 F.\n * Try alternative heating methods. Instead of, say, microwaving for 90 seconds at 100% power, try 2 minutes at 60 or 70% power. If you have access to it, try a toaster oven, air fryer, or a pan on the stove with a little oil. Or if you're willing to eat the chicken in bite-sized pieces or smaller as part of a bowl meal or similar, remove the chicken from your dish, reheat everything else until it's hot, then stir the cold pieces of chicken into the hot food and let it warm through via radiant heat.\n * Some have only had success buying organic or higher-quality chicken, which can also help if you're experiencing problems with \"woody breast\" (which occurs more often in large commercially raised chickens that have grown in size too fast), but this can be cost-prohibitive.\n * If all else fails, you could always try sticking to just eating your meal prepped chicken in cold dishes only, such as salads, wraps, or bowl meals.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xmhl30/meal_prep_a_guide/", "created_utc": 1663989541.0, "score": 2117, "author": "RinTheLost", "num_comments": 38, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/xmhl30/meal_prep_a_guide/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Breakthrough (over takeout) because of a breakup!", "selftext": "Earlier this year, I ended an ultimately shitty relationship.\n\nThe food budget was a point of contention for my ex and I. Roughly 20-25% of our weekly $100CAD budget for two was spent on snacks for him... His favorite snacking preferences did not overlap with mine, so they were indeed for him and him alone. Despite this, I continued to consult him as I designed weekly meal plans that we were both supposed to be happy eating but would later turn out to be inadequate. Being the one to keep track of all of our finances, the meal planner, the sole cook (and dishwasher most of the time regardless of everything else I was), I didn't feel comfortable buying anything \"extra\" for myself in the grocery store but I would \\*constantly\\* end up getting takeout multiple times later in the week because I was so exhausted.\n\nA different obstacle was that he always discouraged me from going grocery shopping without him, but absolutely refused to go in the mornings before he had work so it usually ended up being after I had work, on his day off. I barely had time to drop my things off at home before heading out again, let alone cook first, and that'd result in hangry bickering in the grocery store.\n\nFast forward to now: I am splitting that same budget with a roommate-slowly-turned-boyfriend. We spend the extra money on chicken breasts for him and we spend the extra money on vegan alternatives for me (which he is also consistently and unbegrudgingly open to trying). He actually makes suggestions for the meal plan when I ask him what he wants to eat, and his suggestions are rooted in what we both like or want to try. He was unexpectedly unavailable to go grocery shopping with me today, and thanked me for running the errand without him. Without fail, he does the dishes and wipes the counters, and thanks me for cooking or prepping vegetables anyway.\n\nTL;DR - If your partner isn't stepping up to the plate and you find it hard to bear the weight of balancing healthy eating and cheap eating, have an open discussion. If it doesn't take, honestly examine the other aspects of your relationship and give yourself the same advice you'd give someone in your shoes... I know now that it shouldn't have been as hard as it was. :)\n\nP.S.

{"title": "I generally hate meal prepping because it means eating the same thing over and over - how do you add variety to your meal plans?", "selftext": "Last year, I was lucky enough to have a flexible full-time job while studying full-time. So much so that I was able to cook something new pretty much every night, with my partner doing some nights, and have enough for lunches the next day or two (as well as a just-in-case meal to pop in the freezer.\n\nThis year my timetable isn't being as kind to me, and I need to switch jobs. This means I pretty much have 2 nights a week to cook - Sundays, and Wednesdays, and my partner is doing something similar (alongside a bunch of climbing, MMA and scuba diving in the evenings). The only problem (and man oh man is it a first world problem!) is that I like having a fair variety between my meals. For example, a weekly dinner plan for my partner and I would be something like:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBreakfast for the week: either grilled sandwiches, or a big ole pot of claypot \"whatever we want to chuck in\" Hong'Kong style rice to divvy up and put whatever we like on top (we usually keep chopped scallions, fried onions, sambal/chili sauce, sesame seeds, etc).\n\nMonday - Cuisine/dish we've want to cook that we've picked to try for the week! Last week we did a spanish tapas style lay out with grilled octopus, garlic mushrooms, croquettes and a variety of veggies, and the week before we did nasi lemak.\n\nTuesday - Stir fry or noodles, or sometimes a curry made from scratch (switching between Thai, Malaysian or Indian)\n\nWednesday - Check whatever is going off in the fridge and cook it\n\nThursday - Pasta (aglio e olio/bolognese/puttanesca), and a side salad of whatever fruit is going off, and an assortment of seeds, leaves, nuts and cheese or whatever we have kicking around in the pantry\n\nFriday - Generally eating out\n\nSaturday - Generally eating out/dinner party\n\nSunday - Leftovers and fridge clean out!\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around meal prepping, even if it means chucking some prechopped stuff into a slow cooker or pressure cooker just before dinner. We should definitely have some time to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is a peek into your meal preps/meal planning for the week, and how you keep variety and experimenting with food going? Also, our weekly budget is around 80-100 AUD. Please and thank you!\n\nPS. I am very aware that this post may sound very spoilt, haha! But, I did grow up in Malaysia with an Indian family, and then moved to Australia where food is INCREDIBLE. So I pretty much grew up eating this way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks guys!

Cheese, sour cream, avocado, radish, cilantro, scallions, tortillas, crema, lime wedges, etc!\n\nI used a mix of spices, but you could honestly just use your favorite Mexican spice blend or really any combination of chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and cayenne powder, depending on what you have available.\n\n**Chicken Quinoa Soup with Black Beans:**\n\nServes: 6\n\n# Ingredients:\n\n**Soup:**\n\n* 6 chicken thighs\n* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n* 2 tablespoons chili powder, divided\n* 2 tablespoons cumin, divided\n* 4 teaspoons paprika, divided\n* 4 teaspoons garlic powder, divided\n* 2 teaspoons cayenne powder, divided (more or less to taste)\n* 1 tablespoon butter, optional\n* 1 large onion, peeled and diced\n* 1 jalape\u00f1o, trimmed and diced\n* 1 cup quinoa, rinsed\n* 6 cups chicken stock\n* 1 15-ounce can black beans, drained\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Garnish (Optional):**\n\n* Sliced radishes\n* Diced avocado\n* Cilantro leaves\n* Sour cream\n* Cheese\n* Scallions\n* Tortilla chips\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMethod:\n\n**Marinate the Chicken:**\n\n1.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and cook the chicken, in batches, for 5 minutes per side until browned and charred all over. Transfer to a cutting board. Note: The chicken will not be cooked through when you remove it from the pan. It will continue to cook in the broth.\n2. Drain off all but a teaspoon or two of oil in the pot.\n\n**Cook the Aromatics:**\n\n1. If using, melt the butter into the oil in the pot. Add the onion and cook for 7-8 minutes until it begins to turn golden brown around the edges.\n2. Add the jalape\u00f1o and cook for 1 minute.\n3.

I've made vegan chili and thrown in minced mushrooms or you could add onion, garlic, red bell peppers, or even a little scoop of unsweetened cocoa powder!\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 1 cup dry pink beans or 2 15-ounce cans of pink beans or kidney beans\n* 2 bay leaves, optional\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 2 poblano peppers, trimmed, seeded, and diced\n* 1\u00bd pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and diced\n* 1 tablespoon chili seasoning or Mexican spice blend, pus more to taste depending on the blend you use \n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* 5 cups water\n* Salt and pepper\n\n## For serving, optional:\n\n* 3 tablespoons distilled white vinegar\n* 2 tablespoons sugar\n* 1 cup thinly sliced red cabbage\n* 1 jalape\u00f1o pepper, trimmed and thinly sliced\n* \u00bd cup loosely packed cilantro, minced\n* Pinch of salt\n* Plant-based sour cream\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Prepare beans:\n\n1. Place beans in a large pot. Add bay leaves, if you like. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 2\u20133 hours until tender. Add more water as needed to keep the beans submerged. Once the beans are tender, season liberally with salt. Pour the beans and any liquid from the pot into a large bowl. Discard bay leaves if used. Note: If using canned beans, skip this step.\n\n## Start the chili:\n\n1. Heat neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the poblano peppers to the pot. Saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes. Add sweet potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes.\n2. Add the chili seasoning to the pot and cook, stirring regularly, for 1 minute. Add tomato paste and stir to coat all of the vegetables in the paste. Cook for 3\u20134 mins until the paste begins to sizzle and deepen in color.\n\n## Simmer the chili:\n\n1. Pour in the water and stir to incorporate until smooth. Add the beans along with another pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 40 minutes. Taste and season once more to your preferences.\n\n## Prepare the cabbage topping, optional:\n\n1. Combine distilled white vinegar and sugar in a microwave-safe jar. Microwave in 30-second increments until the sugar is dissolved.\n2. Place the cabbage, jalape\u00f1o, and cilantro in a large bowl. Add salt. Pour the vinegar-sugar mixture over the cabbage and toss to coat. Refrigerate til needed.\n\n## To serve:\n\n1. Ladle the chili between bowls and pile the cabbage garnish on top. Serve with a dollop of plant-based sour cream in each bowl.

{"title": "Would you be interested in a website that incorporates prep instructions for the next day's meal into the recipe? Or that like plans out a week's worth of quick meals around a couple hour time investment one day a week?", "selftext": "Hey guys, \n\nI've been playing with the idea of making a cooking site based around planning future meals. I worked as a line cook for 8ish years so prepping while I cook is kind of second nature at this point. I'll dice an extra onion because I have a second and use it tomorrow and stuff like that. I do this pretty instinctively and rarely actually have a plan in mind and just wing it, but if I sat down and put some serious thought into it I could definitely plan it out.  \n\nI'm trying to think of ways to accomplish this. I like the idea of one big prep day followed by quick meals with little prep projects along the way. So each week would have a shopping list and an estimated cost type thing as well as possible additions and substitutions. I'm vegetarian so the meals would all have a vegetarian base, but I could point out easy places to substitute in some chicken or  fish or whatever. I'm not sure if it'd be possible with just one long day, but it definitely is with one long day and one longish day (Like 2 hours Sunday and 45 minutes Wednesday). \n\nI also would want the recipes to be independent. My current idea is 'downtime' steps that are predetermined if you're following the week guide, but a drop down of possible prep projects if independent. Then, depending on what prep you choose, the site will suggest recipes that use those ingredients. Or a similar concept, but it identifies easy things to double up on and what they could be a base for. Both these would also give you a chance to pick up a missing ingredient or two if you have time the next day.  \n\nWhat do you guys think? Any ideas? Would you be interested in something like this?  I wouldn't be able to put a serious time commitment into it for a couple months, but I figured it'd be good to start brainstorming so when if I do decided to move forward with it I can hit the ground running. \n\nEdit: Woah! Thanks for all the positive feedback and all the wonderful tips. As I said, it'll be a while before I'm able to actualize it, but knowing there's so much interest will definitely help motivate me! I'll get my organizational framework in place, actually write down my recipes and modify others over the next couple months so once mid May comes and I finally graduate I can dive write in! \n\nI'll be sure to keep you guys updated and post some recipes here as I move forward. \n\nEdit 2: This is such an overwhelming response! Thank you so much for the ideas. One thing I'm definitely picking up on is there aren't good vegetarian/vegan/allergy compatible sites like this, so I'm going to start doing some research. There seems to be a niche to fill and experimenting with substitutions sounds like fun. \n\nThanks again guys! I've got a lot of work to do, but y'all have got me excited for the prospects.

It\u2019s a pain to peel all the garlic, but this stuff will last for months in the fridge. So I make a big batch and I use the oil for cooking and the garlic for anything. It\u2019s nice since it\u2019s already cooked, you don\u2019t really have to chop it. I throw it in with whatever I\u2019m cooking and just mash it up with a fork.\n\nThe garlic becomes sweeter - similar to what happens when it\u2019s roasted, so it works so well in dressings!\n\nIn terms of usability: You can use this to replace garlic in any recipe, so just use it as you would normally. The only downside is the oil kind of hardens around the garlic, so you might need to scrape a bit of it off before you add it to whatever recipe you're preparing, but it's not a huge deal.

You can make it with any meat or plant-based protein and it's super amenable to substitutions.\n\n*Pad krapow* is stir-fried holy basil in Thai and it is one of the most popular Thai dishes. Pad krapow is prepared with a fragrant, spicy sauce and lots of Thai basil, it\u2019s an easy dish that you definitely want to get into your rotation.\n\nWhile pad krapow is typically served with rice, this version is turned into an easy chicken noodle bowl recipe.\n\n**Protein:** In this recipe, you can use really any protein, like chicken, tofu, turkey, seafood, ground beef, or ground pork. You can also use a mix of your favorite veggies. I used chicken tenders that I sent through a food processor to roughly chop it. You can also use thinly sliced chicken thighs or breasts.\n\n**Shallot:** In place of shallot, use a roughly chopped onion.\n\n**Thai Chili Peppers:** Use your favorite hot pepper or use crushed red pepper.\n\n**Thai Basil Leaves:** Thai basil tastes like a cross between Italian basil and mint with undertones of anise or licorice. But, if you can\u2019t find Thai basil, you can use Italian or sweet basil. Of course, you could omit the Thai basil if you\u2019re really in a pinch!\n\n**Noodles:** Use your favorite noodle or serve with rice or grains.\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 30 minutes\n\nServings: 4\n\nCalories: 266kcal\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 8 ounces rice noodles\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 pound ground or thinly sliced chicken\n* 2 shallots, peeled and diced\n* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1\u20134 Thai chili peppers minced, more or fewer depending on heat tolerance, or use crushed red pepper\n* 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons fish sauce\n* 1 tablespoon brown sugar (add more if you like it a little sweeter)\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil\n* \u00bc cup water plus more if needed\n* .2 ounces Thai basil leaves stem discarded\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nOptional ingredients:\n\n* A few additional Thai basil leaves for serving\n* Lime wedges for serving for serving\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Prepare the rice noodles:\n\n* Prepare the rice noodles according to package instructions.

Once hot, add the chicken and cook, stirring regularly, for 7\u20138 minutes until mostly cooked through\u2014season with salt and pepper.\n\n## Cook the aromatics:\n\n* Add the shallots, garlic, and minced chili peppers to the wok and cook for 2\u20133 minutes.\n\n## Prepare the sauce:\n\n* Whisk together the soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, and water in a bowl. Set aside.\n\n## Finish the Thai basil chicken:\n\n* Pour the sauce into the wok and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n* Tear the Thai basil leaves in half. Add them to the wok and cook an additional 1\u20133 minutes until wilted.\n\n## Sauce the noodles:\n\n* Turn the heat on the wok to low. Add the cooked rice noodles and toss to coat in the sauce for 1\u20132 minutes. Once the noodles are warmed through, remove the wok from the heat.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Divide the noodles between bowls. Garnish with more Thai basil leaves and lime wedges.

Only needed a few ingredients and it was SO good.", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/axkQ2RR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/axkQ2RR.jpg)\n\nIt's nothing really remarkable and I know I'm WAY late to the game here, but I always went for canned beans for ease of use. But I did a pot of stewy beans using dried beans and it did actually taste better than canned and I liked that I had more control over the doneness of the bean.\n\nI also like that I can soak a whole bag and use half from the pot for one recipe and continue soaking the beans in the fridge and use the other half the next night for something different (I eat a lot of beans, no judgment please but also don't come near our house when we go on a bean bender lol)\n\nHere's how I made my most recent bean recipe! What are your favorite dry beans that I should experiment with next?\n\nI liked this recipe because of the mushroom topping and the use of the celery leaves as a garnish...they had a nice aromatic finish to my beans!\n\n**Recipe here originally:** [**Stewed Beans with Manchego Cheese**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/stewed-beans-with-manchego-cheese/)\n\n# Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n* Skillet\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 16 ounces dry beans, like scarlet runner, kidney, great northern cannellini, lima, chickpeas, etc... soaking and cooking time will vary\n* 2 tablespoons avocado oil divided\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 4 ribs of celery with leaves trimmed and thinly sliced; leaves roughly chopped\n* 8 cloves garlic peeled and thinly sliced\n* 3 tablespoons butter divided (optional)\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper\n* 6-7 cups vegetable stock more as needed\n* 8 ounces mushrooms of your choice sliced or chopped, such as shiitake, cremini, or oyster\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## For garnish:\n\n* Chopped celery leaves\n* Chopped parsley\n* Cheese of your choice, cheddar, manchego, pepperjack, cotija, etc\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Soak the beans:\n\n* Pour the beans into a large pot and cover with water. Cover and soak for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse and set aside.\n\n## Cook the aromatics:\n\n* Wipe out the pot used to soak the beans. Heat 1 tablespoon avocado oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and celery and cook for 7-8 minutes until they just begin to soften.\n* Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n\n## Bloom the spices:\n\n* Melt 2 tablespoons of butter into the aromatics. Add the thyme, smoked paprika, and crushed red pepper and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n* Add the dry beans and toss to coat\u2014season with salt and pepper. Start with 1/2 teaspoon of salt to start and add more as desired. The stock will reduce and become saltier as it cooks.\n\n## Simmer the stew:\n\n* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour until the beans are tender. Taste and season again to your preferences. Add more stock as necessary if the liquid evaporates too quickly.\n\n## Cook the mushrooms:\n\n* Once the beans are tender, cook the mushrooms. Heat the remaining avocado oil and the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Once the butter is frothy, add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally flipping, for 8-12 minutes until they turn golden brown and crisp up around the edges. Season lightly with salt.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Divide the stew between bowls and garnish with celery leaves, parsley, and cheese. Spoon the mushrooms on top of each dish.

{"title": "I can't believe I waited so long on frozen meal prep", "selftext": "So I live by myself in New York with a tiny kitchen and tiny refrigerator, and I've been trying to conserve my shopping (also because I dislike standing in line in general). Thus, I've been trying to buy more long lasting vegetables (such as sweet potatoes, beets, carrots, onions, cabbage, etc.) to save trips and some cash.\n\nBut here's the issue- I get really bored with root vegetables and I don't really have the space to freeze whole meals for later use.  Even when I did have a larger freezer, that place was where food went to disappear, so to speak.  But, I do love cooking and will happily eat refrigerated leftovers.\n\nSo the other night a genius idea occurred to me: chop up small amounts of more perishable vegetables when I get them so that I could use them in cooking now and save some for later by freezing.  I can mix and match as I want with greater variety, and there's enough flexibility to make things for me or for a group.  I couldn't believe I got to this many years old and never really thought about prepping single serve frozen vegetables.\n\nAnyways, not really a recipe or question here, but hopefully someone else will find it useful while under a limited budget or with limited resources- I think I'm definitely going to keep doing this post pandemic!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/fyvtud/i_cant_believe_i_waited_so_long_on_frozen_meal/", "created_utc": 1586576760.0, "score": 2043, "author": "teenybkeeney", "num_comments": 146, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/fyvtud/i_cant_believe_i_waited_so_long_on_frozen_meal/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "I dehydrated mushrooms for taco meat, and I didn't even miss the ground beef. This is a great recipe for Easy Vegan Taco Bowls!", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/ccjieNQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ccjieNQ.jpg)\n\nI mentioned in a previous post that I've been working to reduce meat consumption while still being creative in the kitchen. I made these taco bowls last night and while the mushrooms certainly don't have the same texture as ground beef, they did have a meatiness and sauciness to them that worked perfectly for taco bowls.\n\nYou can omit the crunchy corn tortilla topping or use store-bought. I had some corn tortillas in my fridge that I needed to use! You can also crisp them up in an oven to reduce oil!\n\nThis easy vegan taco bowl is a great vegan recipe if you're hesitant about cutting meat from your diet! It's spicy, flavorful, and easy to prepare. For this recipe, you can prep ingredients as the mushrooms dehydrate!\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 1 hour\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 10 minutes\n\nServings: 2 (See notes)\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Sheet pan\n* Skillet\n* Small skillet\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Mushrooms:\n\n* 9 large shiitake caps small-diced\n* 9 baby bella mushrooms trimmed and small-diced\n* 3 teaspoons neutral cooking oil divided\n* 3/4 red onion peeled and diced\n* 1 tablespoon chili powder\n* 2 teaspoons cumin\n* 2 teaspoons paprika\n* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder or to taste\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Water as needed\n\n## Taco Bowl:\n\n* 1/2 pint cherry or grape tomatoes quartered\n* 1/4 red onion peeled and small-diced\n* 1/4 cup fresh cilantro chopped\n* 1 lime juiced\n* 1 avocado peeled, pit discarded, and diced\n* 2 cups water\n* 1 cup uncooked white rice\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## Crispy Corn Tortilla Strips (Optional):\n\n* 2 corn tortillas thinly sliced intro strips\n* Neutral cooking oil\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Dehydrate the Mushrooms:\n\n* Preheat oven to 400\u00baF. Arrange the diced mushrooms on a sheet pan and drizzle with 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven for 30-40 minutes, flipping occasionally, until browned and dried out a bit. Remove from the oven and set aside.\n\n## Prepare the Tomato Salsa:\n\n* In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, small-diced red onion, cilantro, and lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the refrigerator until ready to serve.\n\n## Prepare the Corn Tortillas (if using):\n\n* Heat 1'' of neutral cooking oil in a small skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the sliced corn tortillas, in as even a layer as possible, and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown. About 2-3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt immediately. Set aside.\n\n## Prepare the Rice:\n\n* Combine the rice and water in a saucepan with a lid. Season with salt. Bring to a boil, stir once, and then reduce heat and cover. Simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for a few minutes before fluffing.\n\n## Cook the Mushrooms:\n\n* In a skillet, heat the remaining 1 teaspoon neutral cooking oil over medium heat. Add the diced red onion and cook for 4-5 minutes or until it begins to char and soften. Add the dehydrated mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes more.\n* Season with all of the spices and add 1/4 cup water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Add more water as necessary to keep the consistency 'saucy'. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat.\n\n## To Serve:\n\n* Right before serving, dice the avocado and toss with the tomato salsa. Divide the cooked rice between bowls and pile the cooked mushrooms and the tomato salsa on top. Serve with the crispy tortilla strips, if using. Enjoy!\n\n## Notes\n\nNote: You may have a bit leftover for lunches the next day! Be sure to eat all of the avocado as it will turn brown the next day.\n\n**Recipe here originally:** [**https://triedtrue.us/EasyVeganTacoBowl**](https://triedtrue.us/EasyVeganTacoBowl)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/fj9ftb/i_dehydrated_mushrooms_for_taco_meat_and_i_didnt/", "created_utc": 1584309798.0, "score": 2023, "author": "BushyEyes", "num_comments": 62, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/fj9ftb/i_dehydrated_mushrooms_for_taco_meat_and_i_didnt/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Here\u2019s how. \n\n*Recipe and Ingredients*\n\n1)  Soy sauce (1 tbsp):  if you have both, use a 1:2 part ratio of dark to light soy sauce, but it doesn\u2019t really matter\n\n2) Sugar (1 tsp): you can also use mirin (a Japanese sweet condiment) but any sugar works fine. If you\u2019re low-carbing, just cut it; don\u2019t use artificial sweetners. \n\n3) Dashi (2.5 cups):  dashi is a Japanese broth made from seaweed and dried fish. Honestly, just buy powdered instant dashi. It\u2019s almost as good. If you\u2019re vegan, use kombu dashi - which has no fish, and you can make at home very easily if you can\u2019t find it at the store. \n\n4) Miso paste (1 to 4 tbsp): for soup, recommend white (shiro) miso (which is light and a little sweet), or red (aka) miso (which is saltier and stronger). Try to avoid hatcho miso which is very dark and thick because it\u2019s usually too salty.   Add more or less miso to adjust the flavour; start with less. \n\n5) Optional: vegetables (green onion, mushrooms, etc) sliced thin, leftover chicken, tofu, etc\n\nHeat up the dashi, soy sauce, and sugar in a pot; when it\u2019s lukewarm, take a bowl and add the miso and about 2-3 tbsp of the warm liquid and blend it using a whisk.  Once it\u2019s smooth, add it to the pot. Add the vegetables and simmer until they\u2019re warm and tender; about 3-5 mins.   Serves 1 as a meal or 2 as a side dish. \n\n*Total time*: about 10 minutes. \n\nTraditional garnishes include ground red pepper and sesame seeds, or roasted seaweed. \n\nThis recipe is infinitely flexible - any and all of it can be adjusted. A more traditional recipe (less robust) uses only dashi, miso, and vegetables - but I like the flavour.   \n\nA bowl of this will come in at under 80 calories, but is very filling and nutritious - a perfect way to make a meal feel more filling. \n\n*Cost*: \n\nHondashi stock is about $4 per 60g bag which makes about 50 L of stock (use about 3g in this recipe): $0.20\n\nMiso paste: 500g is about $4 which makes probably 20 tbsp servings: $0.20\n\nBoth last upwards of 6 months in the fridge. \n\nTotal cost: roughly $0.45 per serving. \n\nCompare with instant miso soup at roughly $0.75 a serving for worse, less flexible food that takes almost the same time to prepare.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ijk8d7/make_miso_soup_your_new_best_friend/", "created_utc": 1598820605.0, "score": 2008, "author": "None", "num_comments": 186, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ijk8d7/make_miso_soup_your_new_best_friend/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "I'm a former junk food junkie, but I've promised myself and my family that next year will be different. Today I made over a gallon of chicken noodle soup from scratch for less than $10.", "selftext": "Hi! Recipe first, sob story after, lol.\n\n**Home Cooked Chicken Noodle Soup**\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 lb of cut up chicken, pre-cooked\n* 12 oz box of pasta (I used tri-color rotini, but almost any pasta will work)\n* 2 15 oz cans of corn \n* 15 oz of sliced carrots, canned or fresh\n* 1 15 oz can of black beans\n* chicken bouillon cubes (I use 3, but you can do more or less if you prefer)\n* 1 32 oz carton of chicken broth\n* 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil\n* Spices - salt, pepper, parsely, celery salt, garlic powder, onion powder\n\n**Directions**\n\nIn a large pot over medium heat, add olive oil. Add carrots and stir until soft, around 5 minutes. Add corn, black beans, and chicken, then lightly season with spices to taste. Stir until well mixed. Add chicken broth and boullion cubes and bring to a boil. If you like a more watery soup, you can add an additional 1/2 cup of water at this stage. Add noodles and cook according to box directions. Stir frequently. Lightly garnish with parsley and serve. \n\n**Notes**\n\nIt's very easy to make this recipe vegan. Just skip all chicken ingredients, use 32 ounces of water instead of broth, and add tofu. The tofu can be cooked and seasoned beforehand to add flavor, mimicking the chicken bouillon cubes. Onions, celery, and spinach are also optional. I threw in a little bit of diced spinach because I was using up what was left in my fridge, but I didn't measure or anything so it wasn't included in the recipe. Get creative!\n\nTotal cost: $10 for the ingredients. Cost my vary by location and quality. \n\nTotal time: Just over an hour. I recently had shoulder surgery and I'm very slow, so yours may be faster. \n\nServings: 8-10. I fully expect this to be dinner for two adults and a toddler for several days. \n\n**Life Story**\n\nSo I just found this sub and I'm absolutely ecstatic. Without going into detail, 2019 was an extremely rough year for our family. We had some pretty serious health issues requiring multiple hospitalizations, had a baby, made some major home repairs, and suffered the unexpected loss of several pets (all natural causes - one was elderly and had been slowing down for awhile, the other just dropped dead one day with zero warning. The second one was especially devastating). With everything we've been through, cooking at home was not a priority. We ate out a lot. \n\nCircumstances aside, I realized that both our health and our wallets were suffering. We were spending way too much money on takeout and getting fast food almost every single night. I want to become a vegetarian and my husband wants to lose weight, but I thought to myself, how can we possibly do that if we eat junk all the time? \n\nI've decided that we're going to change. 2020 will be a better year for us. I want to set a good example so my kids don't see us eating junk food all the time, and where the family dinner isn't McDonald's or takeout pizza 3-4 nights per week. \n\nI'm not a good cook, but I'm committed to this and I'm making an effort. I dabbled in meal prep earlier this year and was making homemade fruit purees for the kids, but that's about as far as I took it. I'd like to start Sunday meal prepping all of our food for the entire week.\n\nSo, today I took the plunge. We had some food that was almost at its expiration date, and instead of waiting a few more days and tossing it, I heavily modified an existing recipe and used the leftovers I had in my kitchen to make a new meal. The chicken was from something that my MIL made last week. The broth and bouillon were extras from stuff I made earlier this year, and they were just sitting around clogging up my pantry. The pasta had actually already expired last month, but... it's pasta. So I ate it.\n\nThank you for reading.

{"title": "Easy, cheap way to get a super flavorful broth for noodles: seared garlic head, charred onion, shiitake stems, and a little soy sauce or shoyu.", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/93N2iWK.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/93N2iWK.jpg)\n\n*EDIT! Since it was mentioned, the full recipe for both the stock AND the soup pictured above is below the stock recipe. I use black sesame paste but you can use tahini, instead.*\n\n**Posted here originally:** [**Noodles in Black Sesame Broth Recipe**](https://exploringvegan.com/noodles-in-black-sesame-broth/)\n\n# STOCK RECIPE (CAN BE USED WITH ANY SOUP):\n\nI cooked this last night for my noodles and was blown away at how tasty it is. I've been big on charring aromatics for my stock for a while but wanted to see if I could make a flavorful broth with the fewest amount of ingredients. This was amazing!\n\nAll you need for the broth is:\n\n* 1 tbsp neutral oil\n* 1 large shallot or small yellow onion, halved (don't need to peel it, the paper adds more flavor and color to the broth)\n* 1 head of garlic, top cut off, cloves left in the paper\n* 2 tablespoons shoyu or low-sodium soy sauce\n* Bunch of  shiitake stems (I got it from 6 ounces of whole shiitake mushrooms)\n* 8 cups water\n\nInstructions:\n\n* Heat the oil in a big pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, cut-side down and the garlic, cut-side down. You want the shallot to develop a nice char but you don't want to burn the garlic, so you might need to flip the garlic earlier than the shallot. The garlic top should become nice and golden-brown. It'll take 3\u20135 minutes. Don't move them while they cook!\n* Add the shiitake stems and cook 1 minute more. Add the water and shoyu. You can add more salt if you need but you're gonna simmer the hell out of it so better to season at the end.\n* Bring to a boil and then hard-simmer (not quite boiling, but above a low simmer) for 30\u201340 minutes. The broth will reduce by about a third. Taste and season.\n* Strain through a sieve into a bowl and set aside.\n\nWhat I like to do then is carefully remove the paper from the shallot or onion and add the peeled shallot to a food processor. Then I pop the garlic out of the paper into the food processor and blend it into a paste with a few tablespoons of broth.\n\nWhen you're ready to make your soup, you can just saut\u00e9 whatever you're using as the base of the soup and then add the charred shallot paste and then the stock and a little more water or broth to supplement it.\n\nIt was amazing!!! I mixed mine with coconut milk and black sesame paste thus why mine is gray, haha (though you can use tahini, too), and then served over noodles. I honestly could have drank the broth by itself though!!\n\n# FULL STOCK + SOUP RECIPE (HOW I USED THE STOCK):\n\n### Equipment\n\n* 2 Large pots\n* Sieve\n* Food processor\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 2 tablespoons neutral oil, divided\n* 1 large shallot, halved lengthwise, and paper left-on\n* 1 head of garlic, top cut off\n* 12 cups water, divided\n* 2 tablespoons shoyu\n* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems reserved and caps thinly sliced\n* 4 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced\n* 1/3 cup black sesame paste\n* 8 ounces dry noodles of choice, like udon, somen, or ramen\n* 14.5- ounce can of coconut milk\n* Salt, to taste\n\n#### For serving, optional:\n\n* Minced scallions, chili oil, or sesame oil\n* Black sesame seeds\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the stock:\n\n* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and garlic, cut-side down. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes to develop a nice sear on garlic and the shallot.\n* Add the shiitake stems and then cover with 8 cups of water. Add two tablespoons of shoyu or low-sodium soy sauce, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and hard-simmer for 30 minutes. It will reduce by about a third.\n\n#### Strain the broth:\n\n* After the broth has simmered, strain it through a sieve into a bowl and set it aside to cool for 10\u201315 minutes.\n* Carefully remove the peel from the shallot (it should break right off!) and add the shallot to a food processor. Pop the garlic cloves out of the paper and into the food processor and add a few tablespoons of stock. Pulse until paste forms and set aside.\n\n#### Prepare the soup:\n\n* Add the remaining tablespoon of neutral oil to the pot. Add the sliced mushrooms\u2013cremini and shiitake\u2013and saut\u00e9 for 6\u20138 minutes. Add the reserved shallot-garlic paste and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the reserved homemade stock and the remaining 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 15\u201320 minutes more\u2014taste and season to your preferences.\n\n#### Cook the noodles:\n\n* Bring another pot of water to a boil, and then add the noodles. Cook until al dente. Drain and rinse and divide between bowls.\n\n#### Finish the broth:\n\n* Place the black sesame paste in a bowl. Add a few ladles of the hot broth and whisk to combine. Pour it back into the broth and add the coconut milk. Simmer an additional 5\u201310 minutes. Taste and season once more before turning off the heat.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Ladle the hot broth over the noodles. Garnish with sesame seeds and minced scallions. Add a drizzle of sesame oil and chili oil on top, if you like.

{"title": "Bibimbap can be complicated or incredibly simple!", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not Korean, I just absolutely love Korean food and try to make it more often because it's TASTY. This isn't a traditional recipe, I'm basically using the idea of how bibimbap is made to craft this dish. Though traditional bibimbap is honestly unmatched. I've had it in a Korean restaurant before!\n\nLast night I went to Walmart and bought a whole bag of veggies (cabbage, carrots, red bell pepper, green onions, broccoli, and some fruits) for like $10 bucks and made bibimbap with a third of it.\n\nI cut the cabbage roughly into about 1 inch chunks, chopped the carrots smaller like really uneven, fat matchsticks, sliced the green onions and bell pepper, and took florets off the broccoli crowns. I sauteed the broccoli, cabbage, and pepper in a pan with oil, a sprinkle of salt/MSG (if it doesn't give you headaches), and some black pepper until it was tender but still crunchy. I soaked the carrots in seasoned rice vinegar (any vinegar with a bit of honey or sugar to taste works too!) and started cooking some rice. \n\nI made a sauce with honey, soy sauce, garlic powder, ginger powder, and sesame oil and mixed until combined. \n\nI put the rice in the bottom of a large bowl and just dumped all the veggies on top and drizzled sauce and fried an egg. We just mixed everything up and IT WAS SO TASTY. \n\nBibimbap isn't just a fancy rainbow bowl of Korean veggie banchan (which are veggies side dishes. I've heard of Korean families using older banchan for bibimbap so they eat it before having to throw it away.) Bibimbap as a word pretty much translates to \"mixed vegetables over rice.\" A Korean cook YouTuber Maangchi has great recipes (more traditional bibimbap!) for really tasty dinners if you're feeling adventurous. \n\nI mean honestly just cooking up some veggies and throwing it over rice is super tasty. It also makes great leftovers! I have an Instant Pot so cooking rice is so fast it's criminal, but regular dollar store rice cookers are also really useful!\n\nOf course you don't have to do exactly what I did, but the idea stays the same. It was filling and honestly super tasty. I plan on making my amateur bibimbap a staple in our house now!\n\nALSO, soaking carrots in a sweet vinegar mixture makes for a great crunchy and sweet snack!\n\nIngredient list I used:\n\nSAUTEED VEGGIES\n\n1 head green cabbage, roughly chopped (I used about a third for one dinner to serve two people)\n\n1 crown of broccoli florets\n\n2 sprigs green onion\n\n1 red bell pepper (I used half for this recipe)\n\n1 tablespoon MSG (if you can eat it)\n\n1 teaspoon salt\n\n1 teaspoon pepper\n\nI used canola oil, enough to coat the bottom of the wok and prevent burning. \n\nTANGY CARROTS\n\n1 large carrot roughly chopped up\n\n1 cup seasoned rice vinegar (or regular vinegar. If you want sweet, just add around 1/3 of a cup of sugar or honey per cup of vinegar)\n\nSAUCE\n\n1 part honey (I used half a cup)\n\n1 part soy sauce (half a cup)\n\nTeaspoon of ginger\n\nHalf a teaspoon of garlic powder\n\nDrizzle of sesame oil (tablespoon or so)\n\nINSTANT POT RICE\n\n2 cups rice\n\n2 1/2 cups water\n\nYou can do a 1:1 for rice in an instant pot but I wanted to prevent burning. I just hit the \"rice\" button and it did the rest for me. Same applies to rice cookers, not including the 1:1 rice to water. Follow rice guide printed on the package of whatever you bought. \n\nOPTIONAL \n\n1 or 2 fried eggs (honestly you can cook the eggs however you want. I like runny yolks)\n\nCook the veggies to your desired done-ness, soak the carrots, mix the sauce, and cook the rice. It should take roughly 10-15 minutes and you can just throw it all together or decorate your bowl elaborately. I'd suggest a high-walled bowl for easier mixing.\n\nIt's not remotely traditional, but the idea of bibimbap gave my husband and I a really tasty, cheap, and healthy staple.\n\nEdit: I took a nap after answering some comments! This blew up a little, I'll try and get around to answering questions! \n\nThere's this great recipe from [Maangchi](https://youtu.be/6QQ67F8y2b8) for a great Bibimbap recipe that's more traditional!\n\nI had people asking about other recipes like tteokkboki, I've shared in the comments but also [Binging with Babish](https://youtu.be/XJ79FPwav4g) makes a great video on it! Babish makes tons of great videos with recipes from pop culture and a \"basics\" series for recipes we are familiar with. \n\nI appreciate the love we are having for such a great and simple dish.

Brown it for best flavour but if you're in a rush it's not the end of the world. If you've any flour left over toss the veggies in it. Throw meat and veg into slow cooker. Add 2 garlic cloves and 2 bay leaves. Cover with beef stock. Cook high 4hrs / low 8hrs. Thicken the broth with a cornstarch slurry if it's too thin for your liking.\n\n*Bonus*: If you really want to jazz it up add 1T Worcestershire sauce to the beef broth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chinese Chicken**\n\n1lb chicken (white/dark, whatever), cut to bitesized pieces\n\n2 red bell peppers (capsicum), sliced into ribbons\n\n1 large onion / bunch green onions, cut small\n\n4 carrots, diced\n\n2 ribs celery, diced\n\nSeasonings: 1T ginger, 4 garlic cloves, 1/4c soy sauce, 1T honey (or 1.5T sugar), 2t red pepper flakes, sesame and olive oil.\n\nCook chicken on all sides until white using 1T olive oil (extra virgin not needed) and 1T sesame oil. Remove from pan. Cook garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes on a *medium-low heat* (seriously if the garlic browns you've burnt it and it won't taste the same. Treat it gently). Once fragrant add the carrots, onion, celery and cook until softened. Add chicken back to the pan. Add the bell peppers. Add 3/4c water to the soy sauce and add to the pan. Cook until veggies are done. Taste the sauce and if it's too salty (or you just like your sauce sweeter) add the honey. Thicken with a cornstarch slurry. Serve over rice.\n\n*Bonus*: You can add anything to this basic recipe. Toss in any old veg you need to use up, or add 1T sesame seeds at the end.

{"title": "Costco fish for the win!", "selftext": "I live alone and I have been trying to eat healthier and spend less money on food. I decided to go to Costco, even though as a single person it didn't seem like a good idea because everything comes in bulk. However, the freezer is my friend and I had that epiphany while standing in the fish section. I bought a giant thing of steelhead trout for $30. Then I bought a bag of my favorite rice for about $15. Then I picked out a bunch of produce that I like and went home to start prepping.\n\nI took all the produce and portioned it up into meal size portions and put them in the freezer. Then I took the fish and I weighed them out to about 3 or 4 oz pieces and that yielded about 9 pieces, which comes out to about $4 per slice of fish. I put each piece of fish into a reusable freezer bag and added my favorite marinade to each and then put them into the freezer.\n\nWhen I get home from work I take the fish and the veggies out of the freezer and put it directly into the air fryer. I make rice in the instant pot. It all takes less than 20 minutes and it is such a yummy meal. I have been eating this every night for dinner and I feel like I unlocked the secret to easy and healthy meal prep, something I have been struggling with my entire life especially as someone who has ADHD.\n\nMy plan is to take this method and rinse and repeat. I can try different veggies, I can try different fish, when I get sick of fish I can try chicken or pork or something different. But everything freezes and that is what is really working for me right now, I highly recommend.\n\nAlso, I didn't want to pay for a Costco membership so I piggy backed on my friend's Costco run.

Even my picky boyfriend loved them. \n\nSo the next day I go to the store to get more black bean patty ingredients to try out a new flavor. The cans were 44 cents. What the hell. How could I not realize how cheap they would be??? That's 11 cents per patty!!! With everything I put in the patties, it still came down to less than 50 cents per meal.\n\nSo I spent 5$ on beans, bread, red onion, Bell pepper, and garlic. I made 24 patties. For 5$. \n\nI froze most of them since it can help them hold their form or something, so now I have a cravings stash for when I want to go out to eat but actually restrain myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/hs9wua/black_bean_patties_finally_getting_the_hang_of/", "created_utc": 1594907174.0, "score": 1804, "author": "Krispcrap", "num_comments": 115, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/hs9wua/black_bean_patties_finally_getting_the_hang_of/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "If you enjoy experimenting when cooking, buy fancy spices and cheap out on everything else", "selftext": "I'm a bit of an aspiring chef. My meal plan for the week includes homemade garlic cheesy bread, taco soup, and za'atar lemon salmon.\n\nWhen I cook, I enjoy experimenting with things. Trying out new spices, replacing ingredients, etc. It's a lot of fun, but it can also get really expensive. \n\nThere's a trick to that, though. Buy fancy spices, but cheap out everywhere else. The spices add the most flavor, and you usually don't need a huge amount. Cheap out on everything else and get the fancy spices.\n\nYou can do a lot with cheap ingredients like frozen chicken, eggs and beans if you know what to season it with. \n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n**Fried eggs and lemon oil:**\n\nI picked up some lemon infused olive oil at a fancy spice shop. $10 only got me 100ml of the stuff, but it's fantastic.\n\nThe oil isn't as sour as lemon juice, and has some of the lemon zest flavor that comes from the skin. Frying eggs in lemon oil is absolutely fantastic.\n\nTwo dollars can get you a dozen eggs if you cheap out. I only use a teaspoon of lemon oil for two eggs, so that comes to 25 cents per serving.\n\n**Chili spices:**\n\nA big pot of chili costs me about $14. I get the cheapest, fattest ground beef and drain the grease, then add lots of Walmart brand beans and tomatoes.\n\nThe real secret is the spices. Simply Organic has some amazing chili powder. A $4 bottle has given me many fantastic pots of chili.\n\nMy chili also has fresh, minced garlic which adds a bit of kick. Then I toss in some cheap dried onion flakes, because fresh onion is easy to overdo and I like the sweeter flavor anyway. \n\n**Garlic butter:**\n\nThis is my secret to good garlic bread, and it goes great on salmon or mashed potatoes as well. It's literally just garlic and butter, but it makes a world of difference.\n\nGrab two sticks of butter and an entire bulb of garlic. Mince the garlic with a garlic press and toss it all in a blender. Let the butter get nice and fluffy, but don't melt it. Freeze it until needed.\n\nThe garlic butter should be almost eye wateringly strong if you eat it on its own. Melt a tablespoon or two and pour it on your dish.\n\nI also made some cinnimon butter that I serve with banana pancakes. When I get a chance, I'm going to try making lemon butter with some concentrated lemon juice. No idea if that will work, but it's cheap. \n\n**Fresh spices:**\n\nFresh garlic costs about a dollar a bulb. 98 cents will get you more fresh parsley than I could ever use. Both of them tastes so much better than anything you can get from a spice bottle.\n\nFresh garlic will keep for a good month before you have to toss it. If you don't use enough, buy a jar of minced garlic. It's not as good as the fresh stuff, but it's better than garlic powder.\n\n**Exotic spices:**\n\nI recently picked up some Za'atar blend. It uses sumac, which has a lemony flavor that's softer and easier to work with then lemon. That's mixed with thyme and some sesame seed to give it a nutty undertone. It's delicious.\n\nEvery month or so I'll pick up a new spice to try out. This month was lemon infused olive oil and Za'atar. Two months ago I picked up some powerful Mexican oregano. Before that it was licorice for tea.\n\nTrying out new spices is so much fun, and spending $10 a month will go a long way. Even the Walmart spice isle gives me a bit of that kid in a candy store feeling now. \n\nLast piece of advice, check online to see if you have a local spice shop. A mom and pop store will have walls of spices to look at, and they might even let you taste them. As a bonus, you'll support the local economy.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are telling me to use cheap spices and fancy ingredients. The end result is probably better, but that's not the point of this post. I want a cheap meal where I can *experiment* with spices.\n\nBuying bulk spices is also apparently better than anything from a spice bottle. Advice taken. From now on I'll try to do that, or just dry my own herbs which is apparently better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/cqktjv/if_you_enjoy_experimenting_when_cooking_buy_fancy/", "created_utc": 1565841387.0, "score": 1747, "author": "Ajreil", "num_comments": 182, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/cqktjv/if_you_enjoy_experimenting_when_cooking_buy_fancy/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

So sorry for being indulgent!\n\nAnyway I always make this [bread](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/no-knead-crusty-white-bread-recipe) from a King Arthur recipe because it\u2019s simple and very cheap. It just uses yeast, flour, salt, and water. \n\nI had already made 2 bread servings with that so I had like 1/3 of the dough in my fridge, a few days old. The recipe says you can save it up to two weeks before baking.\n\nI whipped out my mixer and dumped in a ton of butter to whip it, and like 2 full heads of garlic. (I fucking love garlic. And yes it was chopped, painstakingly so.) Then dry spices: salt, pepper, italian seasonin, parsley, basil, oregano, hot hungarian paprika, crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper. I folded that into the leftover dough into the compound butter I had blended up, and it was really sticky. I added bread flour until it was a dough again, and it looked and smelled amazing.\n\nI took the nearest wine bottle (happy quarantine) and rolled it as thin as I could. I used a mason jar lid rim to cut out circles, I managed to get about 43 rounds from this.\n\nNow in hindsight, I would do the filling first. But at this point I heated up 2 TBSP butter in a pan, and added like 4-5 cloves chopped garlic. The. a while white onion until soft and cooked. Salt and pepper and the rest of the above dry seasonings. Then I added in what must have been about three cups of cooked chicken that I had leftover in the fridge and I shredded before mixing. I cooked and seasoned until delicious.\n\nI took out of the pan and drained excess liquid. Let cool a bit and added cream cheese. Ideally it would have been one block, but I had used it 2-3 times for a spread. I added our about-to-expire feta cheese to try to make up for it. I added more of all the dry seasonings at this point, then whipped out a tablespooon and a spoon to scoop measured fillings onto each round. I squeezed each closed so it looked like a pierogi, but I wound up squeezing them round to get a more puff pastry shape.\n\nI topped with more dry italian seasonings, not all the spicy ones and WOULD have done an egg wash if I had. I unfortunately did not. Then I baked at 350 for 20 minutes. I flipped to BROIL on HIGH for 2-3 minutes, shifting around frequently and monitoring carefully. At this point it was baked and we just needed and brown. I pulled them out and served, and my boys who like em spicier threw on sriracha.\n\ntldr; when your kitchen happens to come together and you make a good recipe; it might not be all that healthy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gpiedz/you_know_when_your_kitchen_and_leftovers_come/", "created_utc": 1590290100.0, "score": 1736, "author": "pretydarnamazing", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gpiedz/you_know_when_your_kitchen_and_leftovers_come/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Would eggplant be good in chili?\n* I wonder if beets would be good in chili!\n\nI also had some corn tortillas in my fridge so I fried them up for a crunch topping.\n\nHere's how I made my chili if you want to try it! A few people suggested grating the carrots which I'll do next time...I kind of liked them diced though!\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 1 hour\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 10 minutes\n\nServings: 5\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n* Skillet\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Spice mixture:\n\n* 2 tablespoons chili powder\n* 2 tablespoons cumin\n* 2 teaspoons Cobanero chili flakes or use crushed red pepper to taste\n* 2 teaspoons garlic powder\n* 2 teaspoons paprika\n\n## Chili:\n\n* 2 teaspoons neutral oil plus more as needed\n* 1 pound ground meat (beef, turkey, or chicken)\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and diced (or use crushed red pepper)\n* 3 small carrots peeled and small-diced\n* 1 1/2 cups water or beef stock plus more if needed\n* 7- ounce can diced green chiles\n* 15- ounce can black beans drained and rinsed\n* 28- ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes excess liquid drained off\n* 1 tablespoon brown sugar optional\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## Corn chips (Optional):\n\n* Neutral oil\n* 5 corn tortillas cut into 2\u201d strips\n* Flaky sea salt\n\n## For serving (Optional):\n\n* Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or sour cream\n* Shredded cheese\n* Cilantro\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Prepare the spice mixture:\n\n* Gather the spice mixture ingredients in a bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.\n\n## Brown the beef:\n\n* Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high. Add the beef and cook for 6\u20137 minutes, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Add half the spice mixture and toss to coat. Continue cooking until the ground beef develops a golden-brown crust around the edges, 8\u201310 minutes more. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to a bowl.\n\n## Cook the aromatics:\n\n* If needed, add a touch more oil to the pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion, red Fresno pepper, and carrots, and cook for 6\u20137 minutes until they begin to sweat and just start to soften. Season with salt.\n\n## Bloom the spices:\n\n* Add the remaining spice mixture to the onions and carrots and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n## Simmer the chili:\n\n* Pour in the water or beef stock and bring to a boil. Add the beans, green chiles, and tomatoes. Add the cooked beef back to the pot. If needed, add a bit more water to ensure the ingredients are covered\u2014taste and season with salt. If you like, add brown sugar.\n* Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes until the chili is thickened and the carrots are very tender. Stir the chili occasionally to prevent it from sticking, and add more liquid as needed. Mash the carrots against the side of the pot as the chili cooks. Taste and season once more to your preferences before turning off the heat.\n\n## Fry the corn chips (optional)\n\n* In a skillet or pot, add 1/2\u201d\u20131\u201d of oil to the pot. Turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the sliced corn chips and fry, occasionally turning, for 3\u20134 minutes or until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. Immediately sprinkle with flaky sea salt.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Ladle the chili into bowls and garnish with the corn chips, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and shredded cheese if you like.

Basically, it's a ball of rice (duh) that can be formed into many shapes, the most famous being a triangle. What a lot of westerners don't know is that onigiri is more often than not filled with a protein, fruit, or other treat. \n\nToday's dinner was about 2 cups of cooked rice filled with: 1 package of tuna, 2 tbsp of mayo, and 1/2 tbsp of soy sauce. You cook the rice, let it cool a little and then take a handful of the rice and make a little pocket, fill it with the tuna salad, cover with a little more rice and compact into a ball or shape it as you feel. Then wrap in nori (seaweed wrap) or leave it compacted as is. \n\nThe ratio I gave made me 3 onigiri that left me feeling full for a few hours. There are plenty of recipes online to give you more tips and tricks and filling options. I highly recommend using a short grain Japanese rice and rinsing before cooking or it'll fall apart in your hands after a couple bites like the jasmine rice I used today. \n\nAll in I didn't spend a dime because it was all in my pantry, but it comes out to about $2.20 for the rice and tuna for one serving, and less if you are making it for more people since I used a starkist single which costs a bit more per serving than cans. \n\nAdd in some veggies and you have a solid meal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ga41ep/ever_heard_of_onigiri_no_its_not_sushi/", "created_utc": 1588140385.0, "score": 1690, "author": "ScourgeofWorlds", "num_comments": 188, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/ga41ep/ever_heard_of_onigiri_no_its_not_sushi/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I get a little crazy when it comes to tracking things so I couldn't help myself so I ended up pricing 234 common items.\n\nIt's just me and my wife so we were really wasting a lot of food shopping at Costco, despite cooking every single meal at home. I was always convinced that Whole Foods would be too expensive because the $/unit price was much higher. However, by only buying exactly what I need I was able to get much better quality with no waste and no increase in cost.\n\nCouple disclaimers, I live in Hawaii, and I priced all of the items at Whole Foods based upon the best quality item available. I chose free range, pasture raised, cage free, organic, local, etc... whenever possible.\n\nOn average, unit cost per item at Whole Foods was 2.93x as much as Costco. There were 15 items at Whole Foods that Cost less than similar items at Costco. Costco was missing 98 of the 234 items and Whole Foods was only missing 10 of the 234.\n\nOverall, I'm still going to shop at both Costco and Whole Foods (we eat 10lbs of carrots a week and they cost 276% more per lbs at Whole Foods!), but now I now exactly where I should by which item that we regularly cook with.\n\nHope this helps somebody out there!\n\nPeople on other subs asked for the spreadsheet, so here you go: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15X0fJxkq24R0q8Jk0C9ZQ9lMvKzqHPckkCe8npMN-Iw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15X0fJxkq24R0q8Jk0C9ZQ9lMvKzqHPckkCe8npMN-Iw/edit?usp=sharing)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/akqgf5/i_spent_way_too_long_at_costco_whole_foods/", "created_utc": 1548700764.0, "score": 1680, "author": "808surfer4life", "num_comments": 206, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/akqgf5/i_spent_way_too_long_at_costco_whole_foods/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

If you make your own sauce, that can save you a dollar.\n\nHummus is super cheap to make. A can of chickpeas can be less than a dollar, and from there you just need lemon juice, salt, a couple of spices and some tahini or unsweetened plant butter.  Use as a protein-packed vehicle for getting fresh vegetables into your system.\n\nLow effort but requires some planning: meat can cost just over $2 a pound if you buy a whole chicken.  Chuck it in a slow cooker 5+ hours in advance along with potatoes, apples, carrots, whatever hearty fruits and vegetables you have on hand.  Enjoy the messy feast from the slow cooker the first night or two.  After that, you'll still have meals upon meals worth of leftovers to de-bone, freeze, use for soups, and otherwise get creative with.\n\nGrocery stores have a huge turnover when it comes to food, especially bread and apples, and often end up throwing these away daily.  Many of them make deals with local nonprofits to distribute this food to people in need, and still a lot of it can go to waste.  Don't be ashamed to ask around about nonprofits that need people to take leftovers off their hands.  You can save good food from the trash, and cut your grocery bill in half.\n\nWhen having people over, give them tea.  It's fancy, comforting, welcoming, and dirt cheap.\n\nFrozen or canned produce is generally much cheaper than fresh, and also lasts longer.  It's also packed with nutrients because it tends to be fresher when preserved than the fresh stuff is by the time it gets to you.  The more intact canned food is (eg canned whole tomatoes instead of puree) the better quality it tends to be, because it's easier to visually identity bad food when it's whole so sellers tend to be more careful.  Use frozen or canned veg to make stir fries, soups, shepherd's pie, all kinds of stuff.  Use frozen or canned fruit to make smoothies and pies, or to add to whole grain cereal.\n\nDried fruit, eg raisins, makes an excellent addition to a bowl of whole grain cereal or oatmeal.  It's also generally cheaper than fresh, and the sweetness will help you avoid dumping in tons of sugar.\n\nMake sure the dried or canned fruit doesn't have added sugar.\n\nThese are things that have helped a lot for me over the years.

{"title": "My basic pasta recipe", "selftext": "I'm italian and often during my travels people ask me questions about pasta. Here is my go-to fundamental oil-based structure.\n\nChop onion and/or garlic in small pieces. Put it in a large pan with generous oil (better if olive extra virgin). You can also add olives, dried tomatoes, pepper, chili pepper, laurel leaves and anchovies (or minced cured meat) at this point. As a general rule, black pepper goes with onion; chili pepper with garlic.\n\nLow heat fry and stir until the onion/garlic gets golden. Then add dry herbs, capers, chopped vegetables (including tomatoes, fresh or canned), mushrooms, meat or fish or already soft pulses.\n\nAubergines, carrots and bell peppers may need different treatment as they take much longer to cook, so they should be cooked a bit already before oil and garlic/onion, unless they are cut thinly.\n\nCook and stir until almost ready, then keep warm with the lowest heat setting. \n\nAt the same time, get a pot of water boiling, add quite some salt (water must taste just a bit less salty than the average seawater, or like an almost unbearably salty soup) and then add the pasta, possibly of good quality.\n\nWhen the pasta is still hard, but getting close to ready (roughly after 2/3 of the cooking time written on the package), take it out of the water and unite it into the pan with the sauce. Don't throw away the pasta's cooking water for any reason. Bring back to mid-high heat and stir together mixing pasta and sauce, slowly adding the starchy pasta water with a ladle until the pasta is almost perfectly al dente (firm core but edible).\n\nAdd salt and pepper to taste, then let it rest for a minute, lid on. If you want to put cheese or cream (both forbidden if you used anchovies or fish, exceptions may include salmon or shrimps with cream) this is the time. In case of cheese, let it melt for a handful minutes. Also, fresh herbs such as basil and parsley should be abundant and added last. Shred parmesan or pecorino directly on the plates, along with more fresh herbs, freshly squeezed lemon juice and a final splish of olive oil.\n\nBuon appetito.\n\nEdit: you're not intended to use ALL the ingredients I listed - it's just a basic memorandum for what goes in when!

{"title": "Why does sandwich bread only come in such huge loaves?", "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI have always been annoyed by the size of the loaves of pre-sliced sandwich bread sold at grocery stores. I can never eat an entire loaf before it goes moldy and I don't think forcing myself to eat way more bread is a good idea.  I have discovered that I can break up the loaf into separate containers and freeze the excess but that is annoying.  Why do grocery stores not sell half loaves or quarter loaves of bread?  My theory is that the current size is based around a married couple with 2-3 kids that is feeding their kids multiple sandwiches a day, that is the only way I could see going through that much bread that fast, but surely single people and childfree couples are not an insignificant portion of the market.  I first noticed this when  I moved out of my parents house and was only buying food for myself, when I got married it got a little better but we still cannot eat a loaf of bread before it goes moldy.

I love homemade bread and used to buy it at farmers markets or bakeries for $4-$6 and decided that was crazy! So I found some recipes for simple sandwich bread and made my own with ingredients I already had: flour, salt, water, yeast, and sugar. Using only minuscule amounts of all of those ingredients compared to the bulk of the container, I spend only $0.61 on my loaf of bread! I shop at Aldi anyways and saved money by purchasing those ingredients and having them on hand. The bread was SO good and will last me and my boyfriend a week. You could even bake a few loaves at a time and freeze them. This is my new favorite way to save $$ and eat healthier--you know exactly what is in the bread (the simplest ingredients EVER) and its not full of preservatives and junk. I know a loaf of wheat bread at Aldi is only $0.80 or so, but this way the bread is fresh, homemade, healthy, and sooooo delicious!! And you have the satisfaction of knowing YOU made it!\n\nHere's the ingredients/ratios I used:\n\n\\-500g all purpose flour\n\n\\-10g salt\n\n\\-8g instant yeast (I used active dry + warm water and sugar to activate)\n\n\\-375g room temp water\n\n\nEDIT: Many if you asked for the instructions for the recipe I used.

We used a combination of fresh and frozen vegetables, like frozen corn and fava beans and fresh carrots and green beans. The base of this harissa vegetable soup is plenty of aromatics and a few heaping tablespoons of spicy harissa.\n\nYou can add a can of chickpeas instead of potatoes and I think finely chopped fresh zucchini would be a nice way to garnish it and complement the heat from the harissa!

{"title": "So you have a tight budget, and want to stretch it as far as possible... and stay reasonably healthy.", "selftext": "**Intro:**\n\nA lot of people are struggling with budgets/tight monetary restrictions right now. Shopping around is hard, and it costs money/time to travel to multiple locations. Additionally, shopping in such a way as to meet your macro requirements can be a huge challenge in the best of times. Enter, this spreadsheet I've put together, that I hope others find useful at least as a starting point. Link is at the bottom if you want to skip the preamble/explanation.\n\n**General Comments:**\n\nThis calculator is, and will always be, a work in progress. YMMV.\n\nAssumptions: You have salt, access to cooking methods, ways to store perishable foods, access to clean running water, and access to any spices/condiments you want that aren't included. Ketchup, mustard, soy sauce, etc. For those familiar with the Struggle Meals series, we're loosely following their rules for flavor enhancers. (the packet drawer)\n\nThe underlying assumption is that you're budgeting for 14 days (two weeks). Why two weeks? It's a good middle ground for being able to buy things in bulks large enough to get good \"price per ounce\" values, without being excessively expensive upfront. For example, you won't find 50lb bags of rice in the calculator. They're great value long run, but not ideal for cash-strapped spending goals.\n\nAll items are sourced from Walmart. \"Walmart?!\" some might say, incredulously. Yes, Walmart. While I have no love for the company or its practices, it sports a couple clear advantages for this particular project.\n\n1.) It's cheap.\n\n2.) Its grocery is posted online, with prices and pictures of nutrition labels.\n\n3.) It's nearly universal if you're a person living in the U.S.\n\n4.) Their prices don't vary largely from market to market.\n\n5.) It's cheap.\n\nYou are welcome, and indeed encouraged, to use this for general guidelines and then shop generics at your preferred grocery store. I just can't link prices/nutritionals.\n\nI have entered a lot of the nutrition information by hand. I was pretty careful, but if you have strict requirements or something looks wrong, be sure to double check.\n\nEvery grocery item includes a link to their website with pricing for that exact item, as I found it at the listed price/description when I input them. This column is hidden by default, but if you want sources for pricing, you'll find them in Column E.\n\nI was careful not to select anything that's on sale/special, or looks far out of line. Therefore, these prices should\\* be fairly stable, but possible to beat with things that are on sale.\n\nFinally, the totals at the bottom of the macros for the 14 day period are for EVERYTHING you have added to your quantity \"cart\". If you put a jar of mayo there, the calculator is assuming you're going to lick that jar clean by the end of 14 days. This is important if you're running your calories/macros super tight, or alternately, if you notice you're way high on carbs/fats AND calories. You might very well have leftovers after a 14 day period for some of these items, which is a good thing for the next 14 day period's budget.\n\n**HOW IT WORKS:**\n\nThe blue column is how many of that item you plan to purchase. Change the numbers there to select the quantity you're considering purchasing. Some things are hand-waved, for simplicity's sake. For example, fresh vegetables: I include green onions and a kale bunch as the only fresh veg. I use them as a \"slush fund\" for fresh veg, but you can rest assured that you can get a bunch of green onions or kale if you want to use it literally.\n\nThere is a bunch of info on per serving/per UNIT calories/macros in the columns to the right. The base values are multiplied by your input quantities in the blue column, summed with anything else that's in your cart, and totaled to show you how your macros line up across 14 days. Keep in mind: the calculator assumes you will FINISH. EVERY. ITEM. If you put a box of butter in, the macros will reflect you eating all four sticks. You might not be able to buy half a box, but for calories/macros it may be helpful to put partial units in and see how that will affect your macro goals (IE eat half a box, but buy a whole one.)\n\nThe score row, if you want to call it that, shows the DRV's for an \"average person.\" You are unlikely to be that average person, but it's a decent guidepost. 2000 calories, 300 grams of carbs, 50g protein, 65g fat per day. The calculator will display how your budgeted shopping list stacks up against those goals, averaged per day across the 14 days, assuming you eat everything you put in your \"cart\".\n\n**Finally:**\n\nThis is a tool, and a work in progress. There are numerous other items that you could buy that are similar, fill different dietary needs, and offer similar or better value. Feel free to copy the sheet and modify it to fit your needs. I have included three tabs (look at the bottom of your browser window) that have a $1/$2/$3 per day budget, and a decent stab at a possible shopping list to fit those budgets. That works out to $14/$28/$42 for two weeks. The $1/day sheet is the only one that requires you to learn how to bake bread/make gnocchi/etc, which was a conscious decision. If you're comfortable working with flour, you can get great bang for your buck with AP flour.\n\nThat's all I've got. I doubt this will be that popular, but if you find other people are using the calculator at the same time you are, it's better to make a copy of the sheet yourself that you can edit. I have backups, so if things get messed up somehow, DM me and I'll fix it.\n\nThanks for checking this out, and I hope it helps someone.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1naT2qJU5\\_E4mdjtS3VYwv4QTEOyi3\\_eWBfTNbpokls4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1naT2qJU5_E4mdjtS3VYwv4QTEOyi3_eWBfTNbpokls4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nEDIT: I'm pretty sure I've fixed it so you can edit now.\n\nEDIT2: Just tried from incognito and it's working as far as I can tell.

These are all prices for my grocery store next week, I've seen similar sales flyers and prices for other parts of the Northeast US as well.\n\n* Smithfield Spiral Sliced bone-in half hams are $.97/lb.  Less than a $1 a pound!  (This price does require a minimum purchase of $25 dollars, and you're limited to 2 hams.)  Usually these hams are around 10 pounds.\n* Frozen whole turkeys, $.59/lb.  Usually these turkeys are 15-20 pounds.\n\nI cook for a household of 2, and next week I'll buy a half ham and a whole turkey.\n\nMost of the ham I'll cut off the bone and divide into 1 lb packages to freeze.  I generally get 5 packs out of a ham.  I pull a pack out of the freezer as I need it for sandwiches and other dishes.  The hambone will be used to flavor a big pot of split pea soup, and the bits of ham that are too tiny to be used for sandwiches are added to the soup.  I split the soup into individual servings and freeze that as well- it's a fast and cheap and easy dinner for me to defrost when I'm too tired to cook.  Usually I get 8 meals of a 1 lb bag of split peas.\n\nThe turkey get a similar treatment.  I roast the whole turkey and eat the legs/thighs for dinner with gravy, mashed potatoes, stovetop stuffing, and a vegetable.  I slice the breasts to freeze.  Some breast slices are packed for sandwich meat, and I also make \"homemade tv dinners\" of a few breast slices, a scoop of mashed potatoes, a scoop of stuffing, and a scoop of veg that go into the freezer for later.

I toss in a bag of frozen mixed veg, some diced potatoes, a handful of rice, and the turkey meat I stripped from the carcass last night.  Simmer for an hour and I have a big pot of turkey vegetable rice stew/soup, which is also portioned out and frozen.

It won't be the same as the white miso but it'll still be delicious. You can also use tahini - just add it to the stock and stir until it dissolves.\n\n## White Miso Brothy Beans\n\nPrep Time: 5 minutes\n\nCook Time: About 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 25 minutes\n\nServings: 4\n\nCalories: 251kcal\n\nAuthor: Kylie Perrotti\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Wide pot\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil\n* 2 shallots peeled and quartered\n* 4 Roma tomatoes quartered\n* 2 tablespoons white miso paste\n* 4 cups vegetable stock\n* 2 15- ounce cans cannellini beans drained and rinsed\n* 1/2 cup fresh parsley minced, a pinch reserved for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Mustard oil or extra virgin olive oil optional, for garnish\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Cook the Shallots:\n\n* Heat the neutral cooking oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 1 minute until just beginning to sweat.\n\n## Char the Tomatoes:\n\n* Place the tomatoes in an even layer in the skillet. Ensure that they are on a cut side and not on the skin. Turn the heat to high and cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes and shallots begin to char.\n\n## Brown the Miso Paste:\n\n* Reduce heat to medium and add the miso paste into an open spot on the skillet and mash it into the skillet with a spoon. Cook for 45 seconds until it begins to brown slightly.\n* Pour in the vegetable stock and whisk the miso into the broth until completely combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n## Simmer the Brothy Beans:\n\n* Add the beans and bring to a boil. Boil for a few minutes until the broth reduces slightly. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.

{"title": "I'm a reformed takeout addict. I went from eating 3-4 take-out dinners per week to 1 per month. Here's how I did it!", "selftext": "I went from ordering takeout 4 nights a week to ordering takeout 1 time per month over about 3 months. I was already a decent cook when I made the commitment to give up takeout. I was tired of overpaying for food that bored me.\n\n\nHere's what helped me: weekly menu planning has made an enormous difference for me. I'm tired and stressed out when I get home and don't want to try to figure out what to cook and if I have all the ingredients. Meal planning on the weekend when I'm relaxed and can make sure I have every ingredient (or reasonable substitute) made my life a lot easier.\n\nHere's how I started meal planning:\n\nI use Evernote to track recipes and menu ideas.\n\n1. Start a note with a list of all the meals you enjoy and know how to make. \n2. Add all the meals you like and would like to try to learn how to make. \n3. Now go find recipes for all the meals you want to learn, and any other meal that seems delicious. Tag every recipe you find with major ingredients in the recipe (the protein, the major veggies); I also tag if the dish is a side dish or salad. The tagging system is really helpful.   For example, [This](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2015/06/slow-cooker-chicken-ropa-vieja/) recipe is tagged \"chicken breast\" \"chicken thigh\" \"peppers\" \"onion\" \"slow cooker\" \"tested recipe\" (once I've made the recipe)\n\n4. The next thing I do is consult my freezer log because I have a deep freezer and I'm always using FIFO (first in, first out) to eat the items I've frozen. I check my fridge for what needs to be eaten in the coming week.  You can consult your weekly grocery flyer for sale items if you shop weekly. Now your tags really come in handy. If chicken thighs are on sale, search your recipe collection for \"chicken thighs.\"\n\n5. Create a meal plan for the week using ingredients on hand and sale items.\n\n**Example of Weekly Menu**\n\nI do not plan for every meal, only meals I will be home to eat. My schedule changes weekly, some nights I'm home early and can cook extra and other days are 12 hours long.  My menu plan accounts for my work schedule. From the freezer, I need to eat a whole chicken, shrimp and one packet of boneless skinless chix breast. From the pantry, I have tortillas that need to be used. In the fridge, I have some guac, sweet potatoes and a big bag of salad that needs to be eaten.\n\nSunday brunch - egg burritos with black beans, guac, salsa\n\nSunday dinner -tuna casserole and salad\n\nMonday - chicken ropa vieja burritos (recipe from budget bytes; uses chick breast), w/ guac, beans, etc\n\nTuesday - Dinner: leftovers (tuna casserole and chicken burritos) \nCook on Tuesday: roast chicken and sweet potatoes/potatoes\n\nWednesday - breakfast: egg burritos w/ guac, beans, salsa\n\nWednesday dinner: shrimp scampi with linguine; salad\n\nThursday - Roasted chicken with roasted root veg (prepped on Tuesday); salad\n\nFriday - Chicken noodle soup with chicken left overs\n\nMake some meals to stock your freezer. Sometimes despite meal planning, I'm too tired to cook. I keep at least 4 different meal options in the freezer. Usually homemade chicken tenders, 2 different kinds of soup, bolognese sauce and some kind of frozen dumpling(I buy this from the frozen food aisle).\n\n**Websites and cookbooks that helped me:** \n\n An Everlasting Meal by Tamar Adler which changed my entire mindset about cooking. Here's how the book opens, \"There is a prevailing theory that we need to know much more than we do in order to feed ourselves well. It isn\u2019t true. Most of us already have water, a pot to put it in, and a way to light a fire. This gives us boiling water, in which we can do more good cooking than we know.\"\n\nBudgetbytes; smittenkitchen; Mark Bittman's how to cook everything; and how to cook everything Fast; America's Test Kitchen family cookbook; America's Test Kitchen Make-It-Ahead cookbook.\n\nHow to cook everything basics by Mark Bittman has lots of pictures and is very helpful if you are a true beginner. I get a lot of cookbooks from the e-book service my library provides and I suggest that as a cheap way to increase your recipe collection.\n\nMy cooking has improved by leaps and bounds in the last few months, and my SO now prefers to eat at home and take left-overs for lunch over ordering take-out.\n\nI hope this was helpful!\n\nEdit:  WOAH guys I had no idea this post would get such a crazy response.   This is amazing and I'm so glad I could help out my fellow redditors.  I'm still getting a lot of questions and comments so I'm going to work on another post with more tips, my freezer management system.

They'll cook properly if you don't soak them, so don't worry too much about it.)\n\nIn a 5 quart/5 liter pot, brown **1 lb pork sausage**, then transfer the meat and ~75% of the fat in another pot/bowl/whatever.\n\nWhile that's cooking, dice **2 medium onions, 2 cloves of garlic,** and **5 carrots or parsnips**.  Saut\u00e9 all that for 5 minutes in the 25% or so of the fat remaining in the big pot.   \n\nThen add **the lentils, 2 cups chopped tomatoes (or 1 cup tomato sauce), 2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp marjoram, the sausage & the rest of the fat,** and **2 quarts of water**.\n\nSimmer ~30 minutes, and serve with fancy bread.\n\n-----\n\n[Italian Chicken Soup](http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/italian-chicken-soup/)\n\n\nCook **1 lb pasta** in a pot according to package directions. Drain and rinse in cold water to cool. Toss in **1 tablespoon olive oil** and set aside.\n\nCook **3-4 lb chicken** (or a whole chicken, whatever floats your boat) however you want.  (editorial: boiled as for stock/broth and roasted in the oven both work well).  Shred the meat and set it aside.\n\nDice **3 or 4 tomatoes** and set aside.  Canned tomatoes also work fine.\n\nIn a small skillet, heat **1/3 cup olive oil** and **2-4 tbsp oregano** for <5 minutes, medium heat. Set aside.\n\nDice and saut\u00e9 (in your main, big soup pot) **1 medium onion, 1 green pepper, 2-3 stalks celery,** and **1-2 jalapenos** in **1 tbsp olive oil** for about 10 minutes.  \nAdd **some chicken broth (6-8 cups), the shredded chicken,** and **the tomatoes**. \nBring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add **the cooked pasta, up to 2 cups of heavy cream,** and **the oregano and olive oil from the small skillet.**  \n\n----\n\nThese are both pretty easy, super tasty, and relatively cheap, depending on the cost of food in your area.

{"title": "Sichuan Homestyle Cold Noodles (Chinese Cold Noodles) \u00a30.70/$0.80 per serving with an egg, some cucumber, roasted peanuts and a salty, sweet, garlicy and spicy sauce", "selftext": "I hope it can give you some lunch/dinner prep inspo even if you don't have all of the seasoning ingredients (I know it can seem intimidating if you don't cook chinese food often). Soy sauce, sesame oil, black rice vinegar and sugar should be a great started point and all the others just elevate it from there. I think it's a great 'base/starting point' noodle dish for the summer that you can add lot's of good veg and protein to\n\nIngredients (for 1 person):\n\n\\- 1 serving of noodles\\* (65g dry noodles or 100g fresh noodles)\n\nSauce\n\n\\- 1 clove of garlic\n\n\\- A thin slice of ginger\n\n\\- \u00bd tbsp+1/2 tsp Light Soy sauce\n\n\\- 1 tsp Chinese black rice vinegar (Chinkiang)\n\n\\- 1 tsp fine sugar (castor, light brown, muscavado or red sugar)\n\n\\- 1-3 tsp Chili oil (add to taste)\n\n\\- 1 tsp sesame oil\n\n\\- 1 tsp sichuan peppercorn oil (alternatively, use Sichuan peppercorn powder)\n\n\\- Additional optional seasoning: a spoon of peanut butter or sesame seeds sauce, chilli flakes\n\nToppings\n\n\\- Roasted or fried peanuts\n\n\\- Sesame seeds\n\n\\- 1 spring onion (scallion)\n\n\\- 1 egg\n\n\\- Cucumber\n\n\\- Others: Boiled chicken breast peeled into thin strips, fried soy beans, other veg like edamame, blanched spinach, boiled romain, iceberg, pea shoots etc.\n\n\\* if you\u2019re in a pinch any noodle would taste good, but the alkaline/egg noodle just has a particular bite and get coated by the sauce in a way that makes these so morish\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. To make the sliced egg strip topping:\n\n\\- Beat an egg and pour into a well heated (medium high heat), greased frying pan\n\n\u2013 spreading the egg out into a thin pancake. Once the liquid has completely set, flip, and fry the other side of a few more seconds.\n\n\\- Remove from the heat and put it onto a chopping board to cool. Once cool enough to touch, slice in half, place the\n\n2 halves on top of each other and slice the egg pancake into thin slices. Slicing from one end at a slight diagonal slanted along the rounded side of the semicircle. 2. To make the sauce: mince the slice of garlic and clove of garlic and add into the bowl you\u2019re eating in. Add all of the sauce ingredients and put it aside so that the garlic and ginger can absorb the flavours and release their fragrance.\n\n3. Prepare the other toppings:\n\n\\- Slice the spring onion (scallion)\n\n\\- Crush the roasted peanuts (use a mortar and pestle if you have one)\n\n\\- Cut the cucumber into thin strips. The best way to do this is to cut oval shaped slices at an angle and then turn those slices flat and cut thin strips in line with the long side of the oval.\n\n\\- We also like to add chicken breast, just boil it with a few slices of ginger and tear into strips once cooled (it soaks up all of the sauce and is SO good)\n\n\\- If you\u2019re using different veg this is a good time to prepare them and set aside\n\n4. Cook the noodles as instructed on the package.\n\n5. Pour the noodles into a big sieve (use a bamboo sieve if you have one) and rinse well with cold water, this rinses the starch off of the noodles and prevents them from sticking together.\n\n6. If you are eating immediately, add a few cubes of ice to the hot noodles and use your hands to mix it until the noodles are cold. If you are making this for packed lunch, picnic, party, or have the time etc. Add a good drizzle of rapeseed oil (alternatively, peanut oil) that has been cooked out and mix thoroughly with your hands. For both cooling methods \u2018mix\u2019 means pulling a few noodles up with your hands (kind of like a claw motion) and letting them drop and repeating this.\n\n7. Add the cold noodles into the bowl with the sauce in it. Use chopsticks to mix the sauce into the noodles. Taste it and adjust to your own tastes, you might want it spicier, sweeter, more sour etc.\n\n8. Add all of your toppings and enjoy!\n\nLiang mian can be made for packed lunch, dinner, picnics just like any other countries \u2018noodle salad\u2019 style food. Leaving it longer actually lets all of the flavours absorb into the noodles making it very delicious! But it's definitely better to eat it on the day of cooking. Just like rice, when you leave it in the fridge for too long the noodles lose their 'bite' and springy-ness and become too soft. One day should be ok, but more than that might not taste as good.\n\n[A video recipe here if anyone was interested!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNxd93pEguc)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/hh2mod/sichuan_homestyle_cold_noodles_chinese_cold/", "created_utc": 1593295724.0, "score": 1565, "author": "Cherryday11", "num_comments": 41, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/hh2mod/sichuan_homestyle_cold_noodles_chinese_cold/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

My husband and I have been trying to keep our budget at $600/ month for groceries (this would include things like soap and trash bags). We have failed every time. I am the one primarily in charge of getting the groceries. We have a toddler and a baby. Wal mart is usually cheapest but they have been really hit or miss with their inventory and curbside pick up. We also have Publix and Harris teeter. I have a harris teeter acct so I can do pickup from them and not pay any extra. We also have a Costco card but I struggle with it because I always overbuy when I\u2019m there and make impulse purchases. \n\nI am a good cook and make almost all of our meals.

{"title": "F***in' pickles, lets talk about that stuff. No canning knowledge required or necessary!", "selftext": "So we're no preserving stuff, this won't stay good in your basement until the Deathclaws show, but making \"Quick Pickles\"/\"Overnight Pickles\"/\"Fridge Pickles\" can be not only a fun kitchen experience, but can get you some super high quality stuff for literally pennies.  \n\n* **What you will need**\n\nWhite Vinegar - I think this stuff is cheaper than water\n\nNon-Iodonized Salt - Kosher is fine, pickling is fine, basically anything not labeled \"Table Salt\" is fine.  No Iodine, doesn't cure well.\n\nJars - we're currently using \"Atlas Mason\" jars, in case you've never heard of them, those are the jars \"Classico\" tomato sauce comes in, with their matching lids, like I said we're getting REAL technical here.\n\nVegetables to Pickle - this is really up to you, but if you want \"pickles\", get English Cucumbers, not our fat American variety.  They're more fibrous and stand up to what we're doing to them better.\n\n* Brine\n\nThis is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!  This is the only thing you can mess up really.  You need the Ph low enough to stave some bacteria and you need the salinity up enough to stave the others.  They also have the lovely side effect of making everything in them taste awesome.\n\nThe amounts don't matter in the slightest, the ratios DO!\n\n1 & 1/2 cup water\n\n3/4 cup white vinegar\n\n1 TBSP Kosher Salt\n\nAll that in a pot, and boil it.  Let it cool for about 30 seconds to a minute and pour into jar already packed with your spices and flavorings and all vegetables to be included.  The liquid must come all the way to the top.  The idea is to raise the internal temp to 151 degs F, pasteurization temp, to stop anything that could possibly grow from not doing so, this isn't' canning so that's not absolutely important, but that's the idea.  Let it cool for a bit, lid off, then put the cap on tight and mix like you're mixing a snowglobe, nice and light.  Place in fridge once cool enough, taste every day, consume entire jar when it's \"good enough\"\n\n* Spice mix\n\nThe spice mix is to go into the BOTTOM of the jar, then you pack veggies on top, then pour the brine, in that order not to be fussed with.\n\nWe've covered most infection vectors with the brine, low Ph + high salinity means not much can grow.  Which means we can get fun with the spices.  For a 20oz/600ml jar, I'll toss in 2 cloves of garlic, about 2 tsp of rough cracked pepper, 2 tsp dried dill, and about 3/4 TBSP of crushed red pepper.\n\nBut because of the environment, you can basically add anything you want, mustard seed, celery seed, coriander, paprika, just think of a flavor profile and try to think about what would go good with it.\n\nWhatever you put in will be \"pickled\" in about 4-6 days, and will stay good in the fridge for about a month (though good luck keeping them around that long)\n\n* WARNINGS!\n\n\"Classico\" jars are not heat rated, this mean there's a somewhat real possibility of it exploding due to thermal shock when you pour the brine in.  Wrap the jar in foil or a towel and place it in a vessel that can hold the liquid before pouring in the brine.  \n\nI can't state this enough this IS NOT CANNING!  These will not last outside of a fridge.\n\nWhen in doubt, add more vinegar, not water.  You want everything submerged, and if you've packed the jar tight enough this won't be an issue, but aerobic bacteria can still multiply in this harsh environment, if they're given access to air.\n\nAbout one entire English cucumber will fit in a 20oz/600ml jar, if it's not tight enough, add onion.\n\nBetween the wife and I, we went through an entire jar in 4 days and just put a batch of pickled peppers in the fridge tonight. We used to splurge on Klaussens, but honestly these taste better and don't cost $6 a jar, more like $1.50. \n\nBesides it's fun, and tasting it everyday give you this kind nice journey through what a pickle being pickled goes through.  \n\nSo go forth, reuse those jars to make awesome pickled stuff!  It's super easy, my first go I was half drunk and bored so I gave her a whirl and they were GREAT!\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/a7l1is/fin_pickles_lets_talk_about_that_stuff_no_canning/", "created_utc": 1545213101.0, "score": 1557, "author": "CactaurJack", "num_comments": 136, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/a7l1is/fin_pickles_lets_talk_about_that_stuff_no_canning/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Small town South Carolina has provided some dismal salsa options, so after I found some BEAUTIFUL jalapenos at a local farmers market I decided to make some at home.\n\nI used the following items:\n\n* [this Ninja](http://www.ninjakitchen.com/products/5/master-prep/6/ninja-master-prep/) that we got for a wedding present four years ago and still runs like a freaking champ.\n* half a white onion, roughly chopped\n* one large jalapeno, de-seeded and roughly chopped\n* 1/3 of a big ass bell pepper, also roughly chopped\n* 1 can of no-salt added diced tomatoes with the liquid in them\n* like three cloves of garlic I had in the fridge\n* salt, chili powder, and comino (cumin) to taste. I use [this brand](http://www.badiaspices.com/) of seasonings and can usually get them in larger quantities for much cheaper than your typical seasoning brand. Check your \"ethnic\" aisle. They're fantastic. \n\nEverything got thrown in the blender, mixed until I liked the consistency, and then tweaked with spices until the taste was so familiar and home-like to me that I might've cried a little bit (or was that the onions?). This was just enough to fill one pint-sized Mason jar to the top. I imagine it'll keep for a couple of weeks in the fridge. \n\nI also made a pineapple version! Pretty much the exact same thing, but instead of the canned tomatoes I used some grape tomatoes I had that needed to be used, some chunks of canned pineapple, and the juice they came in. I used less comino and chili powder to make it less smokey tasting and more fresh. I think it'll be just as good with chips, but will really kick ass on some fish tacos. \n\nAside from the fresh jalapenos, this was made from ingredients I almost always have on hand anyway, and without a stove. If you're a college kid or in the military and only have access to a mini fridge or a gross-ass community kitchen, this would be a great recipe for you to bust out with and impress your friends with.

{"title": "The Chicken Soup Cycle", "selftext": "We all know that protein is expensive these days. I've created a foolproof cycle for making flavorful, meaty chicken soup for as cheap as humanly possible.\n\nWhen grocery shopping, get both the rotisserie chicken (these are often loss leaders) and whatever pieces of chicken are cheapest. For me, that's usually legs or leg quarters. These cheap pieces are chock full of connective tissue that makes chicken stock so good.\n\n The process:\n\n* Eat the rotisserie chicken. We don't need it here, so it's great for sandwiches or stir fries.\n   * As you go about your week, also save veggie scraps like onion skin and carrot tops/peels.\n* Make a stock with the bones AND the chicken pieces.

Cook it with your rice, add potatoes, herbs and other spices, and you have a hefty meal. \n\nIf you just want boneless chicken, and you take the time to de-bone the chicken, you have boneless chicken thighs. And can use that to cook alongside beans, vegetables, or even just alone. And it's hard to dry out! \n\nTake or freeze the thigh bones and now you've got a simple stock for soup. Add in onions, carrots, celery, even some thigh meat and now you got a small meal.

{"title": "Better living through vinegar coleslaw", "selftext": "Hello! Have you heard the good news? Do you have a moment to talk about vinegar coleslaw?\n\nIt's true! Coleslaw doesn't have to be coated in mayonnaise and thick, \"creamy\" dressing! There's a better way--the Way of the Vinaigrette! It's cheap, lower in fat and calories, and bright, tangy, sweet flavor cuts through the richer dishes coleslaw is usually served with. I whip up some coleslaw almost every time we grill now.\n\nColeslaw in general is also highly customizable: green cabbage, red cabbage, mix of both; onion or no onion; proportions; flavor of the dressing; all can be tweaked and dialed in to your liking. Note that most recipes you'll find online contain *way* too much oil, so much that it ruins the fresh, crisp texture and mutes the other flavors. (Seriously, you can't even taste the vinegar if you use too much oil.)\n\nHere's my personal recipe:\n\nhalf a head of green cabbage, finely shredded  \nhalf a red onion, very thinly sliced  \n1 medium carrot, grated\n\n*Dressing:*  \n1/2 cup apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar  \n2 tbsp vegetable oil  \n1/4 - 1/2 cup sugar (to taste)^1  \n1/2 tsp kosher salt  \n1/2 tsp ground or whole celery seed  \n1/4 tsp dry mustard^2  \n1/8 tsp black pepper^3\n\n*(Edit: I have since doubled the amount of celery seed, mustard, and pepper.)*\n\nCombine all ingredients for the dressing and mix thoroughly.^4 Combine all vegetables in a large mixing bowl. Toss with dressing until all vegetables are well coated and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes prior to serving. (More time will develop more flavor.) Enjoy!\n\n-----\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] I find that more than 1/4 cup is too sweet for me, and I've thought about using only 2-3 tbsp. You do you, though.\n\n[2] Not totally necessary. As a substitute, you could try adding 1/2 or 1 tsp of prepared mustard, or more pepper. (See below.)\n\n[3] I'm thinking about increasing this to 1/4 tsp; 1/8 is such a tiny amount you can hardly tell it's there. I wanted to present my recipe in its current form before experimenting with it, though.\n\n[4] You may wish to heat the dressing in a small pot to make sure the sugar and salt dissolve properly, but it's not necessary. If you do, let the dressing cool before you pour it over the veggies; you don't want the residual heat to start cooking them.\n\n-----\n\n*Edit: I'm blown away by the response this has gotten!

Making yogurt was very easy and it came out SO GOOD. A gallon of milk is about $3.50 here while a liter of Greek yogurt is around the same price. So you could theoretically make a gallon of yogurt for the same price as you pay for a liter at the store!\n\nI just used milk and some of the yogurt as well as glass jars and a large bowl of warm water. I don't have a yogurt machine or even a thermometer. I followed more or less this [recipe] (https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/homemade-yogurt-395111) and also watched this [YouTube video for instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFpuFCsvF3s) because she provides descriptions on how to guess the temp without a thermometer, but I heated up the milk quicker and did not keep it on low for 30 minutes. \n\nYou can use a portion of each batch to make new batches of yogurt so you never have to buy it again. I am going to continue making yogurt and will explore making frozen yogurt as well. I've been eating it with chia seeds and fruit, added to oatmeal, smoothies, etc. Will also use it with a red lentil curry this week. I love it plain but you could always add jam, honey, or fruit to sweeten it!\n\nAlso, you can save the whey that separates and incorporate into meals for extra protein. I usually use leftover whey to make bread. My favorite recipe is [this no-knead overnight bread recipe](https://leitesculinaria.com/99521/recipes-jim-laheys-no-knead-bread.html). It calls for only 1/4 tsp of yeast (one packet lasts me a long time!) and requires very little active work! I am not good at kneading bread, so this recipe is a lifesaver.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gjfolv/never_buy_yogurt_again_so_easy_to_make_at_home/", "created_utc": 1589432289.0, "score": 1511, "author": "KoreaFYeah", "num_comments": 239, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/gjfolv/never_buy_yogurt_again_so_easy_to_make_at_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

A 5-6 pound chicken at my local grocery store is $6 and sometimes less if they're having a sale (once got it for .89 a pound!)\n\nIt should be noted that whole chickens are usually larger by the pound than fully cooked rotisserie chickens, which are often $5-6 dollars for only 3-4 pounds of meat. The extra couple of pounds you get for cooking it yourself makes a difference! You don't need to buy a bunch of fancy herbs, simple salt and a lemon is a great start. I use a mixture of \"italian herbs\", garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and the juice of a lemon on the outside (under the skin) and the inside, then throw in 3-4 cloves of garlic and the remnants of the lemon i juiced into the inside. You can use the \"guts\" in the bag in recipes but I haven't figured out how yet.\n\nThere are SO MANY ways to use this chicken! Here's a short list of my favorites:\n\n- Soups (It's soup season so I make a huge pot for lunch every week.)\n- Tacos (add your favorite taco sauce to shredded meat)\n- Stir fry (chop and heat up with some soy sauce or a mix of soy, brown sugar, oyster sauce, etc)\n- throw it on a salad!\n- Make chicken salad for sandwiches/crackers (mayo, onion, raisins if you're feeling crazy)\n- roast the thighs/legs for a few minutes with bbq sauce!\n\nCutting up the chicken raw is a bit of a process, I don't have the knives for it, but if you have a strong, sharp knife or pair of good kitchen shears, it is viable. \n\nI prefer to cook it in my instant pot and then shred it with my bare hands! It's strangely satisfying\n\nAn entire chicken can feed me for lunches and dinners for 7 days. I also throw the bones into my instant pot pressure cooker and make broth! Broth can be frozen for use in soup, or added to rice for more flavor and protein. If you freeze it it is good for basically forever!

There are several ricipes and its pretty easy and inexpensive. \n\nIngredients:\n\n* Beef stew meat 2lbs (or beef shank but its a bit more expensive)\n* Beef short ribs 1 lbs (bones add more flavor)\n* 3 to 4 carrots \n* 3 potatoes (small russet, red or golden)\n* 2 celery stalks\n* 2 cobs of corn (cobs or ears? idk I forget)\n* head of cabbage\n* 3 mexican squash or 2 zucchini squash (depends how big)\n* half a medium onion white or yellow\n* 3-4 garlic cloves\n* salt (to taste)\n* chayote also known as **mirliton** squash in english.

(optional) \n* beef stock (optional)\n* 1 serrano pepper (optional)if you have stomach flu/sickness skip this or this might upset your stomach)\n* lemon (optional, but tastes better with it)\n* corn tortillas (optional, but again tastes better with it)\n* medium sized stock pot 7 to 8 quart\n\nPrepare the beef. If the beef has to much fat trim as much as you want off, leave some for flavor. Fill the pot 3/4 of the way and put the beef in with half a table spoon of salt and a clove of peeled garlic. Set to medium high flame to boil. the boiling process will take about an hour, but about 20 minutes in skim off the impurities that have float to the top with a ladle, this will make a cleaner broth. \n\n20 minutes later clean the rest that is still on the top. In the last 20 minutes prep the vegetables that are going in. Long vegetables chop to bite size pieces (peel carrots), peel and half the potatoes and garlic. Peel the onion and chop big chunks. put the potatoes in bowl with cold water so they wont blacken. I use about half a cabbage head, but if you can fit the whole thing go ahead! \n\nAt this point, the water has boiled for about an hour, and you will noticed that the water has evaporated. Put the chopped onions, carrots, celery, garlic cloves. There are three steps you can choose next: One, you can refill the evaporated water with liquid beef stock. Two you can refill it with water and powder beef stock or Three, you can fill it with just water . Add salt to taste at this point as well. Be aware that beef stock already has a lot of salt in it. Cover the pot and let these cook for a bout 45 mins. \n\nAfter those 45 minutes pass, continue wit the rest of the vegetables (and optional pepper) and cook for 30 minutes or until the chayote and potatoes are tender. \n\ncook some tortillas, put a little lemon or lime in the middle and salt, roll it up and eat it with the soup. Tastes great!

{"title": "Miso soup, as the Japanese make it at home.", "selftext": "(Or, as taught to me by my wife).\n\nMiso is good stuff. Nutritious, filling, warm and a fair bit of healthy stuff. But the recipes I've seen on here are a little lacking in substance and form and not the rich filling dishes we make at home. So here's my take on it.\n\n(Apologies - I can't do numbered lists in reddit, so just treat the bullet points as the ordered steps)\n\n* Water. 500 ml (2 cups) gives us enough for 2 but you can make double for leftovers the next day. Or if you're hungry.\n\n* Dashi stock; made from instant dashi powder, or [kombu](http://www.thekitchn.com/ingredient-spotlight-kombu-75445), or [katsuobushi](https://www.tofugu.com/japan/katsuobushi/). This gives it the yummy umami taste. About 1/2 tsp of the dashi powder to 2 cups and boil until dissolved. If using kombu or katsuobushi, take them out after boiling them for a bit, so put the katsuobushi into a mesh bag, tea strainer, etc.\n\n[This](http://justhungry.com/handbook/cooking-courses/japanese-cooking-101-lesson-1-its-all-about-dashi) puts it better than I can.\n\n* Next, the ingredients; you can add vegetables, meat, tofu, mushrooms, or whatever takes your fancy, providing it tastes okay. Stuff we use includes sliced onion, cubed potato or sweet potato, cubed tofu, spinach, daikon or turnip things, Asian greens, cabbage, [abura-age](http://www.kikkoman.com/cookbook/glossary/gs51.shtml), mushrooms, thinly sliced pork or beef, green beans, broccoli... Boil these in the dashi soup until just cooked.\n\nSome things will take longer than others, so either be careful with timing or use things that take the same amount of time - sliced onion, potato and abura-age is one of my favourites, and they all take about 10 minutes cooking.\n\n* Turn off the heat and add the miso. You will find it easier with something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Kotobuki-Misokoshi-Miso-Soup-Strainer/dp/B00462R8SA) or a sieve or strainer to dissolve the miso paste into the soup mix. If you don't, you'll get lumps of miso paste which may not be nice. Once dissolved, you'll have some rice or soy grains left in the strainer. Just throw them it - extra nutrients. \n\nMiso comes in two main types - Shiro (White) Miso is made from rice and soybeans, and is lighter in colour and flavour. The fishy taste comes through a bit more with this. Aka (Red) Miso is darker and saltier and richer. There are also types with dashi in them, organic types, low salt types, and, my favourite, [Hatcho](http://www.mitoku.com/products/miso/hatcho_intro.html) [Miso](http://www.8miso.co.jp/english.html) which is made in my wife's home town. Dark as sin, and made in the same way for the past 680 years. We use half akamiso and half hatcho miso most of the time. \n\nBut try different types and see what you like. We don't get too many types here in NZ but still have our favourites from what we can get.\n\n* Reheat the miso but don't boil it - you'll kill the natural koji enzymes in the miso, and although it will taste okay, it won't be as good for you. Add sliced spring onions if you want, and enjoy.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/4r6bqt/miso_soup_as_the_japanese_make_it_at_home/", "created_utc": 1467621654.0, "score": 1479, "author": "None", "num_comments": 67, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/4r6bqt/miso_soup_as_the_japanese_make_it_at_home/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Now I just need to find more things to throw limey chickpeas on!", "selftext": "PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/isZ9m7P.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/isZ9m7P.jpg)\n\nRecipe here originally: [Kale Soup with Lime-Cilantro Chickpeas](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2021/04/24/kale-soup-with-lime-cilantro-chickpeas/) \n\nI made this tonight and loved it so much. It was so easy to make and only needed a few ingredients. It's really versatile too! If you can't find tomatillos, just buy a jar of salsa verde (usually $1.99 at the grocery store and you only need like half a jar) and just add it to the soup with the diced green chili peppers.\n\nFor something different, I piled the chickpeas on top of the soup instead of cooking them in the broth, I think it just added some nice brightness to the dish but you can absolutely cook the chickpeas in the soup if you prefer!\n\n**Substitutions**:\n\nKale: Spinach or arugula\n\nTahini: It's optional as a way to thicken the soup, but you can use a peeled and diced potato \n\n**Kale Soup:**\n\n1-2 jalape\u00f1o peppers\n\n1 pound tomatillos, husk removed and tomatillos rinsed under warm water\n\n1 head of garlic, top cut off\n\n1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into wedges\n\n1 7-ounce can of hot green chili peppers. optional \n\n1 pound kale, chopped\n\n5 cups water or vegetable stock\n\n2 tablespoons tahini, optional\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nCooking oil, for roasting and sauteing\n\n**Chickpeas:**\n\n2 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n\n2 limes, juiced and zested (or use 1 large lemon, juiced and zested)\n\n1-2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n\nFresh cilantro, optional\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Char the tomatillos, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic: Preheat oven to 400\u00baF. Place tomatillos, jalapeno peppers, and head of garlic (garlic should be cut-side up) on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1-2 tablespoons oil. Season with salt. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes until beginning to char.\n2. Start the kale soup: While the tomatillos roast, prepare the kale soup. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large pot and add the onion. Cook for 8-10 minutes until it begins to brown around the edges. Add the diced green chili peppers and cook for 4 minutes. Season lightly with salt.\n3. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.\n4. Prepare the chickpeas: In a bowl, combine the chickpeas, lime juice, and zest, oil, and cilantro. Season lightly with salt. Set aside for 10-15 minutes.\n5. Remove the garlic cloves from the skin. Trim the stems off the jalapeno peppers and remove any woody parts from the tops of the tomatillo peppers. \n6. Add the garlic cloves, jalapeno, and tomatillos to the soup. Add the kale and cook an additional 15 minutes until the kale is bright green and tender. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n7. Blend the soup: Use an immersion blender to blend the soup until creamy. If the soup seems a bit thin, add tahini. (Note, you can also add a peeled, diced potato or two during step 3 for a thicker soup...adjust cook time as necessary)\n8. To serve: Ladle the blended soup into bowls and pile the marinated chickpeas on top.

This recipe for green curry rice and veggies is about 300 calories per serving and only 30-ish minutes to make!", "selftext": "PIC:  [https://i.imgur.com/IDY4fWt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IDY4fWt.jpg)\n\nRecipe here originally: [Green Curry Rice with Vegetables](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/2021/04/02/green-curry-rice-with-vegetables/#)\n\nI love green curry rice but sometimes I don't want coconutty green curry. This is a great way to get the flavor of green curry paste in your rice and it's as easy as frying it up in a little oil, adding the rice, and cooking until it's toasted. Add the water, bring to a boil, and then simmer (covered) for about 15-16 minutes.  Serve it with whatever sauteed veggies you like!\n\nHere's my version of *kao pad gaeng keow waan.* Typically, this kind of green curry fried rice calls for cooked white rice (which is delicious) but you can also cook the rice right into the green curry paste as follows!\n\nThis uses mixed mushrooms and asparagus and is only 300 calories per serving but here are a few more veggie combinations that would work well in this:\n\n* Bell peppers, carrots, shiitake mushrooms\n* Green beans and eggplant\n* Bok choy and baby corn\n* Broccoli and sugar snap peas\n* Zucchini and sweet potato\n\nYou can also add protein to the stir-fry, like thin chicken strips, shrimp, or thinly sliced pork or beef.\n\n## RECIPE\n\nThis green curry rice with vegetables is a perfect vegan dinner recipe that comes together quickly. Make this recipe, so you can get back to enjoying the spring weather!\n\nServings: 4 \n\nCalories: 294kcal \n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide skillet\n* Medium pot\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Green Curry Rice:\n\n* 2 teaspoons avocado oil\n* 1-2 tablespoon green curry paste depending on heat tolerance\n* 1 cup white rice\n* 2 cups water or vegetable stock\n* Salt to taste\n\n#### Vegetables:\n\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 1 pound mixed mushrooms such as shiitake, maitake, king trumpet, diced, torn, or sliced into rounds\n* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 1-inch piece of ginger peeled and minced\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n* 1/4 cup vegetable stock\n* 1 pound asparagus woody ends trimmed, stalks cut into thirds\n* 2 ounces Thai basil leaves a few leaves reserved for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the Green Curry Rice:\n\n* Heat the avocado oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the green curry paste and mash it lightly into the oil until it becomes fragrant about 45 seconds.\n* Add the rice and cook for 1 minute until toasted.\n* Pour in the water or stock and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest, covered, for 5-10 minutes before fluffing with a fork.\n\n#### Cook the Vegetables:\n\n* Heat the sesame oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook for 5-7 minutes until it just begins to turn brown. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-12 minutes, adding another teaspoon or two of oil as necessary. Season with salt and pepper and cook until the mushrooms have released their liquid and are golden brown.\n\n#### Finish Saut\u00e9ing the Vegetables:\n\n* Add the garlic and ginger to the mushrooms and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n* Add the soy sauce and vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Stir in the asparagus and Thai basil and cook, occasionally tossing, for 5-6 minutes until the asparagus is bright green and tender-crisp. Taste and season again with salt to your preferences.

{"title": "My single, lazy dude's guide to cheap and healthy eating.", "selftext": "I've been trying to eat healthy for almost two years now, so I've made my fair share of mistakes and learned quite a few tricks. Like many of you, my tendancy to swing by McDonalds instead of eating at home is the direct result of not having food at the house. This is my plan of attack to avoid this expensive and unhealthy habit. Some of this info may be redundant, but hopefully you'll glean some new ideas from my approach.\n\nFirst off, I do all my shopping/cooking/prep on Sundays, but you just need to pick a day when you have a solid couple of hours to devote to shopping and cooking. You'll need a good knife, cutting board, sandwich baggies, Mason jars, [Foodsaver Mason jar sealer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005TN7H/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), [Foodsaver vacuum sealer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWIVCA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), crock pot, can opener, and spices.  (The Mason jars and sealer aren't necessary, but I've found that it keeps the food fresher for longer periods.  You can even freeze them.)\n\nFor breakfast, I like to keep it simple and quick. I try to combine some carbs with a little protein and fat. A typical breakfast for me is a banana and some walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, or a boiled egg. I also really enjoy [Larabars](http://www.amazon.com/LARABAR-Fruit-Apple-Gluten-Free1-6/dp/B000ENUC3S/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1415813459&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=larabars+apple+pie), but those may be out of your price range.  For me they are worth the price ($1.26/bar).  I also keep a supply of [homemade granola](http://paleomg.com/paleo-granola/) on hand for breakfast and when I get a craving for something sweet. And I cannot tell you how delicious this [granola](http://imgur.com/zbv7ctl) is.  I was giving it to everyone at work because I just had to share it.  Trust me on this one.  Anyway, one batch of granola usually lasts me about two weeks.  I also [bag up fruit/veg](http://imgur.com/pkomLBX) and freeze it to be used in smoothies.  As you know, nuts can be expensive, so I highly recommend finding an Aldi in your area (really great prices on nuts of all varieties) or investing in a CostCo membership ($55/year).  \n\nLunches are equally simple.  Each Sunday I buy a variety of unprocessed fruits and vegetables.  Two pounds of carrots ($1/pound), three cucumbers ($.50-$1 each), a 10oz bag of spinach greens or kale ($2/bag), celery ($2/stalk), apples, and grapes.  Feel free to choose whichever fruits and veggies suit your fancy.  I also buy 2 dozen eggs ($2.50/dozen for Eggland's Best).  From CostCo I buy a 3 pound bag of [walnuts](http://www2.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?prodid=10277909&whse=BD_827&topnav=bd) which lasts me a month minimum.  Again, feel free to include whatever foods you really enjoy.  I've used lunch meat, cheese, yogurt, and many other delicious, nutritious, and cheap options.\n\nFor preparation, all I do is peel, cut, and bag up the carrots and cucumbers.  I stuff sandwich baggies full of spinach and kale (usually makes about 8 bags).  Boil, peel, and bag up the eggs (three eggs/bag).  Bag up the walnuts into 1/4 to 1/2 cup portions.  Bag up the grapes.  The end result should look something like [this](http://imgur.com/odHvFhc) or [this](http://imgur.com/VohqpmD). Total prep time: 15 minutes.\n\n*Please note: I ran our of baggies, so the carrots are all in one bag.  Also, I was boiling more eggs when I took this picture, so all the eggs are not accounted for.* \n\nWhen I leave for work in the morning, I grab a banana and one egg or a banana and some nuts or just some granola for breakfast.  For my lunch box I grab one bag of carrots, one bag of cucumbers, one bag of kale/spinach, one bag of grapes, one bag of eggs, and one bag of nuts.  In order to keep my appetite in check, I eat in small meals usually consisting of one or two bags or a carb/protein/fat combo.  This keeps my energy levels and brain function consistent throughout the day. The total cost per lunch comes out to:\n\nCarrots: $.40\n\nCucmbers: $.60\n\nSpinach/Kale: $.80\n\nEggs: $.63\n\nFruit: ~$1\n\nWalnuts: $1\n\nTotal: $4.43/day\n\nFor dinners, I love to use my crockpot.  This week I made [chicken tacos](http://www.food.com/recipe/crock-pot-chicken-taco-meat-4957).  I also really love to make [carnitas](http://ourfullplate.com/recipes/crock-pot/crock-pot-pork-shoulder-pernil-carnitas-style/).  Over the past few months I've been perfecting [my](http://imgur.com/Cxbeul1) [bolognese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqBqiGM1O54) which is delicious and very versatile. [Orange chicken](http://www.health-bent.com/poultry/paleo-orange-chicken) is great with rice or stir fry.  As you may have noticed, I try not to eat bread and grains, but by all means please feel free to do so.  Chicken tacos/[carnitas](http://imgur.com/RJFfvdj) with tortillas or taco shells or Spanish rice and Bolognese with pasta are filling and very cheap and very easy to add veggies.  \n\nOnce the crock pot dish is finished, I divide it up into portions and store it in Mason jars to be eaten throughout the week.  I usually make two crock pot dishes on Sundays, but you may find that one is enough or you have enough variety from freezing/saving the meals from previous weeks.  Try [roasting some veggies](http://imgur.com/G6nSroS) to eat as a side dish.  Just do what works for you.  I like to keep veggies on hand for quick stir frys during the week as a change up.  Sometimes I just eat a rurkey and avacado sandwhich loaded with lots of veggies.\n\nSo that's how a lazy, single guy like myself is able to maintain cheap and healthy eating.  I've cut my food preparation down to just a few hours per week.  I'm eating healthy food that I enjoy and rarely prefer fast food over what I have waiting for me at home.  \n\nComments, questions, suggestions, observations, and critiques are welcome.  I hope this helps!\n\nEdit: [cheaper Larabars]( http://www.amazon.com/LARABAR-Fruit-Apple-Gluten-ounce/dp/B00426ATTK/ref=pd_sim_gro_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1S4F25CKYYBKW1JTS6M1)\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2m3o66/my_single_lazy_dudes_guide_to_cheap_and_healthy/", "created_utc": 1415821131.0, "score": 1397, "author": "grouch1980", "num_comments": 151, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/2m3o66/my_single_lazy_dudes_guide_to_cheap_and_healthy/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Add whatever alliums, herbs or peppers you have on hand, powders or dried herbs will also work really well. Some people add sugar or extra salt if needed.\n\nBoil your eggs to the desired consistency, soft, medium or hard, shock them and peel. Mix your marinade, put your peeled eggs in a jar or tupper and submerge in the marinade.\n\nMayak eggs need overnight marination, but get better and better as they brine, to a limit, I\u2019ve never had them for more than a week in the fridge (so tasty), but I\u2019m sure the egg quality degrades with too much time.\n\nIf you are already eating hard boiled eggs regularly for cheap protein, this takes them to the next level.

I pack them with veggies, eggs, hash browns, meat, and my hunger is mostly satisfied until dinner.\n* A sweet potato with butter and a bit of brown sugar is quite filling relative to the calories. In general, potatoes tend to score the highest in terms of satiety compared to any other food.\n* Chicken is a tried-and-true staple.

So I\u2019m active, and I\u2019m generally conscious of my nutrition.\n\nI\u2019ve tracked macros before and I\u2019m aware of the importance of protein. I do best when I track, but I\u2019m trying to get more protein from natural sources like meat, poultry, and dairy instead of powders. That said, I struggle to hit targets unless I *do* track.\n\nI\u2019m writing this post out of frustration after what happened today. Here\u2019s what my food looked like:\n\n* **Breakfast**: Protein porridge with blueberries + a bit of peanut butter, coffee\n* **Lunch**: 2 chicken thighs, roast veg, \u00bd a medium flatbread, apple\n* **Snacks throughout the day**:\n   * A slice of raisin malt loaf\n   * KitKat\n   * Carrot sticks + 1 falafel\n   * Small hot chocolate (semi-skimmed milk)\n   * \u00bd a salted caramel hot cross bun before my run\n\nI then did a **9k run** after work at a moderate pace/effort. After the run:\n\n* 2 eggs + roasted veg + mushrooms in the leftover flatbread\n* Skyr yoghurt with protein powder, blueberries, and some peanut butter\n\nAnd *then* I kind of spiraled. I had what I\u2019d call a mini snack-fest \u2013 random stuff like raw vegetables (I often eat raw carrots and broccoli because they feel \"guilt-free\"), some nuts, small bits of cheese. I didn\u2019t track it all, and I felt out of control, angry, and disappointed in myself.\n\nThis happens a lot \u2013 especially **after dinner** or **after exercise**. I feel like I lose all sense of portion control. I keep snacking in the hopes that something will \u201chit the spot.\u201d I drink a lot of peppermint tea too, so much that it sometimes wakes me up in the night.\n\nI\u2019m reaching out because I need help. I feel like food has become my only reward system, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m developing or already have some kind of disordered eating. I\u2019m constantly hungry or thinking about food, and it\u2019s making life harder than it needs to be.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar?  \nHow did you manage to:\n\n1. Stop erratic snacking and post-exercise binges?\n2. Rebuild a more intuitive, healthy relationship with food?\n3. Stop thinking about food 24/7?\n\nAny insights, resources, personal experiences or kind words would really be appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading \ud83d\udcac", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1k0xivg/need_help_managing_my_eating_habits_looking_for/", "created_utc": 1744842931.0, "score": 29, "author": "thomasmclmusic", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1k0xivg/need_help_managing_my_eating_habits_looking_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

With proper care, they will make a large harvest with minimal work. This is essentially \"free\" food. Potatoes can be grown in containers as well, though the harvest is smaller.\n\nGreen onions: We have not had to buy green onions for a few years now because I planted the cut ends with roots in our garden and they have multiplied. They can be propagated in water super easily, just stick them in a jar.\n\nOther plants that are easy to grow:\n\nPeppermint: Grows like a weed and can be used to flavor desserts and brew herbal tea. \n\nCollard greens: Grow really well in many climates. They are one of my favorite vegetables and are resistant to pests that go after lettuce and spinach.\n\nYou can go to a seed exchange, if you live near one, and pick up a huge quantity of seeds.

But since logging my food a month ago, I've noticed that my daily protein intake is 130g+.\n\nGenerally the staple foods that I eat daily are:\n\n- 100g (dry weight) black beans (for carbs, fiber, and protein)\n\n- 2 eggs (for protein, and because I like eggs)\n\n- 1 can sardines (for the omega-3)\n\n- 2 oz almonds (for calories + vitamin E)\n\n- 4 oz (dry weight) pasta (for calories)\n\n- 30g chia seeds (for fiber)\n\n- 1 cup skim milk (to wash down chia seeds)\n\n- about 200g combined of carrots, broccoli, and kiwi/citrus fruits (for Vitamin A/C/K)\n\n- whatever else to bring my calories up, usually a scoop of peanut butter or pancakes with fruit jelly.\n\n\nTLDR I'm trying to eat less protein, if doing so would mean I get to add a greater variety of healthy foods to my (admittedly) homogeneous diet.

Doesn\u2019t take many specialty ingredients and i will try and break down cajun seasoning to items most have on hand. \nYou can do it in pressure cooker I am sure but I have never tried. This recipe came from one of my boyfriend\u2019s mom who was a Vicknair from Houma Louisiana and 100% Cajun\n\n2 celery stalks\n1 small yellow onion\n1 bell pepper \n4 cloves garlic\n(FINELY dice all above same size pieces and put in a bowl)\n1 lb smoked sausage (or turkey sausage if you dont do pork), cubed \n1-1.5 lbs chicken thighs (deboned and deskinned if needed, then dried well on paper towels), cubed\nTry and cut sausage and chicken thighs about the same size, it cooks evenly and makes it look better. \n3 bay leaves \n3  teaspoons cajun seasoning \n(Equal parts garlic powder , onion powder, salt and pepper, a pinch of cayenne and if you have a little thyme and oregano, put a small pinch of each in)\nFat/oil of choice (I used butter, veg or olive oil will work fine) 2-3 tablespoon total, a little at a time\n\n2 cups rice (I like Aldi\u2019s jasmine rice a lot. It cooks very well)\n3 cups chicken stock (I use the concentrate in a jar and put a heaping tablespoon in hot water to dissolve while I work on the rest)\n\nIdeally you want a heavy 6qt pot with a tight lid for this. I used an enamel dutch oven \n\n\n Heat your pan on medium high heat and once its good and hot, add some oil to coat bottom and add chicken. Brown the chicken until its colored on all sides. Do not stir it too much, let it sit long enough to sear. Take the chicken out of the pan and place in a bowl, do the same thing with sausage, then take that out and add to chicken in the bowl. Add a little more butter/oil and add vegetables to the brown bits left in pan. Keep stirring this, try and scrape bits off bottom, and add seasoning mix  in to vegetables. Cook them until they are soft, browned and carmelized. This will take longer than you think. Developing flavor happens during this step. Don\u2019t be afraid to let them cook. Keep stirring so nothing burns. \nAdd stock into the vegetables, and the meat, stir well. Add bay leaves. Make sure all the bits are scraped off bottom again. Let the \u201csoup\u201d come up to a slow boil and add rice. Stir again, place lid on top and reduce heat to low. \n\n\nAt this point, set a timer for ten minutes. \nDO NOT REMOVE LID and give pan just a little shimmy to move everything on the bottom a little. Do this every ten minutes for a half hour. DO NOT REMOVE THE LID \nJUST WIGGLE SLIGHTLY. \n\nAfter a half hour of cooking rice, should be done and ready to go\n\nStir it all up well, you can cut green onions on top or hot sauce if you like. \n\nhope you enjoy.

{"title": "Reminder: frozen berries / veg are often cheaper, healthier, easier", "selftext": "I feel like this sub sometimes underappreciated or under emphasizes the value proposition of frozen produce/berries. Frozen berries and veg have two main advantages:\n\n1) They are often more nutritious. Studies have shown that frozen berries and veg are often more nutritious than their \"fresh\" counterparts because they are flash frozen when harvested and thus retain their nutrients better. Transport, exposure to heat/ sun can break down many nutrients in fresh produce.\n\n2) They last longer in the freezer. If you are short on time it is often hard to make the frequent trips to the grocery in order to always have fresh produce on hand to manage the inventory such that your produce doesn't go bad. Frozen has the advantage that it's frozen so you can buy a bunch and not have to worry about it going bad and having to manage the inventory as closely \n\n3) Often cheaper. On a per gram basis, you would be surprised how often frozen is usually cheaper than fresh. This is for the reasons mentioned above. It is more difficult for suppliers to manage the inventory because the produce will go bad faster. Often easier/cheaper to freeze.\n\nThe only real downside I can think of is that a lot of the texture is lost when freezing/thawing. So if your veg is intended for fresh salads or to eat raw, it's not really ideal.

Thank you <3\n\n\u2014\n\nLiterally meals with minimum ingredients that\u2019s still somewhat tasty and most importantly nutritious.

Any help or advice is welcomed and appreciated.\n\nAnd secondly, simply drinking water feels like the biggest task. I use a tumbler and straw which helps but man I hate drinking water.

{"title": "Cream+Water versus milk", "selftext": "I've touched on this in another thread and I'm getting mixed information, so I'm hoping to clarify.\n\nFor awhile now, when a recipe calls for milk I've been substituting with cream and water. Here's my logic:\n\n# Health, Weight Loss, and decreasing sugar intake\n\n1 cup of Pet Skim Milk is 90 calories, 130mg of sodium, and 13g of carbs with 12g of total sugars. \n\n[https://petdairy.com/products/fat-free-milk-plastic-gallon/](https://petdairy.com/products/fat-free-milk-plastic-gallon/)\n\nIn comparison, 1 tablespoon of Hood Light Cream is 30 calories, 10mg of sodium, and <1g of carbs and <1g of total sugars.\n\n[https://hood.com/products/cream/cream/light-cream](https://hood.com/products/cream/cream/light-cream)\n\nIn theory, I could add 3 tablespoons of cream and just under 1 cup of water to create cooking milk that's the same 90 calories as the skim milk, but with far less sodium and sugar. In practice, though, I've been doing 1 tablespoon of cream per cup of water instead of 3.\n\nCream+water DOES have a little more fat, though. Cream is 3g of fat per tablespoon with 1.5g of saturated fat, while skim milk has 0 fat.\n\nCream+water also has 10mg of cholesterol, while milk has 5mg.\n\nI haven't been able to tell a difference between this and regular milk when cooking dishes.\n\nAm I wrong in my theory that using cream+water instead of milk is better for fat loss?\n\n# Money\n\nLocally, a gallon of skim milk is $3.19 /gallon, which is 16 cups. That's $0.20 /cup.\n\nA 16 ounce container of Hood Light Cream is also $3.19, but with 1 tablespoon per cup of water I can make 32 cups.

I also save parmesan rinds.\n\nAs soon as the bag is full, which for my family of 1 is maybe once a month or so, I throw the contents into my 6qt instant pot, a little salt, some whole pepper corns, maybe a bay leaf (or cracked off parts of bay leaves that are annoying to fish out of soup), fill to the max line with water, and cook on high pressure for 40 minutes.\n\nI then pour through a mesh strainer into 32oz leftover containers. Depending on the veggies, and how full my bag was, I get between 3-4 full containers. The cheapest 4 cup boxes of low/reduced sodium veggie stock at the local super market usually run over $2 a pop, and have a fraction of the flavor. If I stretched the gallon of veggies into two batches, I could get the equivalent of 8 cartons and still have a better product.\n\nI always have 4 cups of broth in the fridge, and the rest saved in the freezer. The flavor always varies depending on what veggies I cooked with, which I think is fun. I use my stock in any recipe that calls for water, veggie, chicken, or even beef broth.\n\nEdit(s):\n\n1. As somebody commented, if you cook with meat more than I do and save bones, those work too! Cook times will just be longer.\n2. The value and sustainability proposition is unreal. Assuming you already used the veggies, you are getting a somewhat pricey product as a free bonus. It makes me want to buy/eat more veggies as a result. If you are using this to get rid of \"aging\" product, you are still getting some of your money back instead of wasting. This is my favorite way to dispose of leftover veggie trays (carrots, celery, even cherry tomatoes) that are typically past their prime at sale. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1j2sdgn/instant_pot_veggie_stock_game_changer/", "created_utc": 1741033290.0, "score": 61, "author": "WrongSperm2019", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1j2sdgn/instant_pot_veggie_stock_game_changer/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Oatmeal FTW", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been making oatmeal for breakfast everyday for over two years and cannot believe how fast, inexpensive, and delicious it is. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m ever going back to box cereals or pre-packaged instant oatmeal.\n\nOatmeal is a great choice for breakfast every day! It\u2019s packed with fiber, particularly beta-glucan, which supports heart health by lowering cholesterol. It also provides sustained energy, helps regulate blood sugar, and is rich in essential nutrients like magnesium, iron, and B vitamins.\n\nTo keep it balanced, pair your oatmeal with protein (like nuts, seeds, or yogurt) and healthy fats (such as nut butter or flaxseeds). Also, varying your toppings (e.g., fruits, spices, or different nuts) can help prevent monotony and ensure a well-rounded diet.\n\nHere\u2019s my simple and delicious microwaved oatmeal recipe:\n\n**Base Ingredients:**\n\n* Heaping 1/3 cup rolled oats\n* a small handful of raisins\n* 1 pinch kosher salt\n* 1 cup water\n\n**My Typical Mix-ins:**\n\n* a dusting of cinnamon\n* a handful of walnuts\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 1 Tbsp milled flax seed or chia seeds\n* a drizzle of maple syrup or honey (optional)\n* a dash of half and half (optional)\n\n**Alternative mix-ins & additional toppings:**\n\n* Sliced banana, diced peeled apple, applesauce, blueberries, strawberries, strawberry preserves, Greek yogurt, peanut butter, almond butter, shredded toasted coconut, macadamia nuts, etc.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large microwave-safe bowl, add oats, raisins, and salt then water.\n2. Microwave for 4 minutes on 70% power.\n3. Add mix-ins and stir.\n4. Let sit for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. This will allow it to cool down and thicken up.\n5. Add toppings, if any, and enjoy!\n\nFor a richer taste, swap the water for milk or pour some half and half in after cooking.\n\nFor extra protein, stir in nut butter or a spoonful of Greek yogurt.\n\n**Total Cost Per Serving (approximate):**\n\n* Basic oatmeal (oats + raisins +  salt + water) \u2192 $0.15\n* My oatmeal recipe with cinnamon, walnuts, and maple syrup added \u2192 $0.55\n* Deluxe oatmeal with milk, honey, berries, and nuts \u2192 $1.35\n\nThis makes oatmeal an extremely budget-friendly, nutritious breakfast!

This one is busy-friendly, depression-friendly, vegetarian-friendly, intoxicated-friendly (to a degree, please be safe), student-friendly, beginner-cook-friendly, etc. \n\nI\u2019m definitely not the first person to do a broke fried rice, but for anyone struggling with time, learning to cook, short on energy, etc., I figured this would be helpful potentially! :D\n\nYou\u2019re gonna need the instant rice that comes in a box (or whatever rice you usually have on hand, but the boxed instant rice is what I use, because I rarely have to remember to buy it, and it\u2019s super easy), vegetable oil or butter, frozen veggies (I use a mix of celery, onions, and carrots, as well as a peas and carrots mix), eggs, MSG, and some soy sauce! Also anything else you want, it\u2019s literally just a lazy fried rice, it\u2019s hard to mess up. Also you can add whatever seasonings you like, of course. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to go good with your veggie mix or what you\u2019ll like, though. I kind of just add whatever is in my pantry and sounds good at the moment, but garlic powder is always pretty good in most things.\n\nYou\u2019re gonna defrost + saut\u00e9 your frozen veggies in a pan with some oil or butter. You\u2019re gonna add the oil or butter once there\u2019s no water/frost left. If you\u2019re using butter, I recommend adding just half of it now, and the second half after you\u2019ve fried the rice. I like the texture better that way, but it\u2019s your rice! While that\u2019s going on, get your cooked rice out (the instant rice takes just a minute in the microwave, so I do that). Once the veggies are thawed and cooking, throw the rice in. Just be careful if there\u2019s any water in it still- that mixing with the oil will cause a lot of splatter. Mix that up and fry it for a few minutes. Add some msg and soy sauce or coconut aminos. Just a tiny bit will work fine, you can always add more after. A little goes a long way. Then, add your eggs- however many you want, I\u2019m not a cop (also, add the other half of the butter, if you\u2019re doing that), and mix it up by folding while frying it. When the eggs are cooked, you\u2019re done! You can also add meat or fish or something if you want, or a side of more veggies. I personally use two eggs for extra protein, and go heavy on the veggies, but you do you!

{"title": "Grocery Prices Are Out to Get Me\u2014Should I Just Bail to the Countryside and Grow My Own Food?", "selftext": "So, I\u2019m contemplating it over here. Grocery prices? They\u2019re straight-up bullying me. I\u2019m out here trying to eat my veggies, maybe sneak in some protein without selling a kidney, and the store\u2019s like, \u201cNah, that\u2019ll be $12 for a sad little avocado.\u201d Like, what is this? A conspiracy?  \r\n\r\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been daydreaming about just\u2026 yeeting myself to the countryside. Picture this: me, in overalls, yelling at chickens, growing carrots like I\u2019m some kind of wizard. Homesteading vibes, you know? But then I\u2019m like, is this even a thing?  \r\n\nI\u2019ve seen people talking about how they ditched the city, started growing their own food, and now they\u2019re living the dream. Like, they\u2019ve got gardens, eggs for days, and their grocery bill is basically just \u201cbuy some flour and call it a day.\u201d But then I\u2019m like, what if I\u2019m just romanticizing dirt?  \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the chaos in my brain:  \r\nPros: Cheaper rent, fresh veggies I grew myself (assuming I don\u2019t kill them), maybe a goat named Gerald for moral support.  \r\n\r\nCons: Driving everywhere like I\u2019m in a Fast & Furious movie, no more DoorDash (RIP), and what if I\u2019m bad at farming?\r\n\rI read somewhere (PBS, I think? Don\u2019t quote me) that rural life might actually be more expensive for stuff like gas and random groceries. But then cities are like, \u201cPay $1,000 for a closet and cry about it.\u201d So, I\u2019m stuck.  \r\n\r\nHas anyone here actually done this? Like, packed up, moved to the middle of nowhere, and started growing kale like it\u2019s your job? Did it work? Or am I just gonna end up with a garden full of weeds and a chicken that hates me?  I can get a remote work tho, so if things get worse I can still order food but that would be costly if the stores are far away.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you\u2019ve got tips for growing food on a budget\u2014whether I\u2019m in the city or the sticks\u2014hit me with them. I\u2019m desperate. Eating cheap and healthy feels like trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube blindfolded right now.   \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk. I need answers.

{"title": "Produce and Protein", "selftext": "Hi! This sub has given me some lovely tips and I wanted to share my own that I have been using for years now as a very broke, but highly health motivated person. \n\n1. Super cheap produce.\nI live in one of the most expensive towns in the country, getting fresh veggies will break your bank. I didn\u2019t know about this before but most grocery stores have little stands with bagged up produce that is about to go bad or just needs to be gotten rid of to make room for new shipments. This week I got a whole weeks worth of produce for about $5, it would\u2019ve been $20 regularly. \n( if you don\u2019t think your store has discount produce section, ask a worker and it might just be in an unusual place)\nThis adds so much variety, flavor, and nutrition to my meals. I am also able to freeze, ferment, and stew a lot of it. It is typically a steady supply of bananas and potatoes as well which are great carbs when you get tired of rice. \n\n2. Protein\nI am very protein forward since I lift, however this is often one of the more expensive parts of a meal, particularly lean protein ( I define as having close to a 10:1 calorie:protein ratio). \nSoybeans are an amazing source of lean protein, are cheap, and also supply the body with Omega-3\u2019s. A block of tofu is usually around $1 and can make 2-3 meals depending on your needs. Shelled soybeans are a great protein addition to salads and rice bowls, and they can be bought cheap frozen. \n \n2.1 Bone Broth \nGoing to your local butcher and asking for scrap bones and making bone broth is another way to improve protein intake and nutrient density. Often you can get a ridiculous amount of bones for very cheap. \n\n2.2 Eggs Right Now\nDuring *avian flue times* if you live in suburbs or the country, try finding a neighbor with chickens via Facebook groups. I get mine for about $4 a dozen right now which is much cheaper than stores (and better quality).\n\n2.3 Organ Meat\nOrgan meat is very nutrient dense and can fill in some gaps for us broke people who are more prone to nutrient deficiencies. Same deal as the bones with the butcher, they usually go through a ton of organ meat as it isn\u2019t a big seller and will give it to you for practically free (maybe even free if they are cool). I personally have a hard time with liver but you can use it to stretch out your ground meat. But heart meat is usually quite good. \n\n3. Flavor\nIt\u2019s usually cheaper to make your own sauces at home (especially with discount peppers and aromatic veggies and herbs) so look for some staple recipes. Also HERB GARDEN!! I have a couple herbs in a windowsill herb garden that I got on Facebook marketplace for free. A lot of local gardening stores or just avid gardeners will give you starters for various herbs for very cheap or free since a lot of herbs grow like weeds. It\u2019s a great way to up the flavor in your food, as well as reap the health benefits of fresh herbs such as rosemary. \n\n4. Restaurant Food \nIf you live in a city it\u2019s worth looking into an app like \u201cget to go\u201d, which is an app for restaurants to reduce food waste and sell food at very discounted costs at the end of the day. I live in a small isolated town right now so it is not use to me, but I\u2019ve heard it works in some cities.

I have the garlic one every now and again and the Lemon Pepper Tuna is another one that I enjoy. I've tried most of the flavored versions but they are too oversauced for my taste. Though you do see the pieces of chicken, they are too soaked in the sauce so I buy the pain and add my own.  \n\nI noticed a few days ago on Amazon that they now have Beef Creations. There's a Taco version and a Sweet BBQ flavor.  I thought these packs could be perfect when I'm in the mood for a taco or two so I ordered a box of 12 of each and could not wait to try them. \n\nThe picture on the packaging shows crumbled ground beef (they use 90/10). It's not. It's paste. I could not identify any ground beef. The consistency was that of a can of tomato paste. I made two soft tacos, one with Taco and one with Sweet BBQ which is also just a paste with no trace of meat. The taco flavor has too much cumin and no other taste at all. Sweet BBQ is like you are just swallowing spoons of mediocre bbq sauce. This part of an Amazon review is spot on: \n\n*Saw these in Walmart. I wish I hadn't. It tastes terrible. You couldn't prove it's \"beef\" to me - there's no taste of meat at all. Or really of most flavors of taco meat. Just a weirdly metallic tomato taste and too much cumin. And sweet. Why is it sweet? I would give it a partial star for actually have a (very little) bit of heat to it, but it doesn't overcome the rest. It doesn't just disappoint, it actively tastes bad.*  \n  \n*And it's just a pouch of slime. The picture on the package is a hollow lie. The Bell's taco filling has more texture than this, and that stuff literally gets dispensed with an oversized squirt gun. It has all the consistency of potted meat, except somehow slimier.*  \n  \n*And you get a shockingly small amount. Which is just the capstone - it's awful, and you also don't get much!

Use it in place of chicken stock and add a bit of BTB for chicken-based soups, or use it in place of water in other recipes. \n\nEdit: My bad, I didn\u2019t realize so many people already knew this. I learned to cook when I was 11 or 12 because my parents never cooked. There was a lot of instability there. Everything I learned came from reading the back of a package or watching YouTube/reading cook books. I\u2019ve developed a pretty good skill set in the near-decade I\u2019ve been cooking, but I have a few obvious blind spots for stuff like this.

And I'm fairly certain I'm not supposed to add anything else besides coconut milk, because this tastes almost exactly like the curry I've had in Thai and Vietnamese restaurants. \n\nSo yeah, any input?

{"title": "How to Approach Cooking If It Is Overwhelming", "selftext": "I am incredibly far from an expert but I saw a post on another sub of a man excited to save so much money spending $270 exclusively eating (drinking?) Huel for a month. Reader, you can eat fresh veggies and Parmigiano Reggiano for $270. I recently got a friend into cooking and was massively helped myself by [a post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jwjn2p/from_a_professional_chef_to_you_the_tricks_that/)on this sub by a real chef, but feel that was too detailed for someone overwhelmed in the kitchen itself like my friend. That post is great if you know how to cook but not how to shop. This post is directed at someone who sees too many unknown steps when you step in the kitchen, or is afraid of things going wrong.\n\nThere are only two big things that you cannot do on a stove. You can not put water on an oil fire. If your fire is oil you turn off your burner and cover the pot/pan. This does not happen often, but needs to be known. Next, pan handles go over the stove. A handle sticking out over open air is just asking to be flipped. This will protect you from most all major burns and the only thing you can really ruin is the dish you are making. Making mistakes with your cooking is highly encouraged and are required to get better. When cooking I am referencing my full catalog of everything I have done wrong. Avoid enough large mistakes and you end up doing things right. Good enough can taste damn good.\n\nIf you want to research a bunch of modern science you can get a healthier diet than mine, but I guarantee (not legally) that following my diet is healthier than fast food or processed frozen meals. My focus is on being comfortable cooking non-processed individual foods. If you can do that you are beating most people on health as well as likely being a competent cook.\n\nGetting a rice cooker changed my life. I can get a slightly better tasting rice by being a maniac about the whole process, but washing your rice and throwing it in a cooker is just too easy to pass up. Washing your rice is how restaurants get individual rice grains and not a clumpy mess, it washes off the excess starch. I put it in a strainer and run under cold water for maybe 15-20 seconds. Make sure to generously salt it once in the cooker. Even the cheap ones with just one button work well, but I use [this one](https://www.aromaco.com/product/digital-rice-grain-multicooker-arc-914sbd/) (I endorse the number of functions not this specific brand). \n\n\n\nNext, while your rice is cooking for you, lets get comfortable with veggies. I prefer to saute or bake/roast them. Steamed bags are great too but we are cooking here! Chopping examples [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGS067s0zo) and [Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZGqtmwboHU).\n\nRoasting is super simple \u2013 cut up veggies, mix them with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, then google how long they roast for, and roast in the oven on a baking sheet at the temp google says or 425. In time you will learn the perfect amount of olive oil and salt or how to adjust the time based on cut size, but you will get close enough following the internet here. Roasted potatoes are an absolute must. Potatoes in general are the real super-food but some Yukon Golds in the oven will make my whole week. I like using parchment paper or aluminum foil for an easy cleanup.\n\nSauteing is why I am writing this. If you can get comfortable with a pan then you can cook so many meals. Sauteing is shallow frying in oil. Oil is a huge bickering point in both flavor and health camps, its a valid conversation to have, later. Unless you have an opinion already you can start with olive oil for lower temps and canola oil for higher temps. Each oil has a different \u201csmoke point\u201d which is the temperature it starts to form scary words like \u201cfree radicals\u201d. A little bit of smoke from your oil is very okay but constant heavy smoke is too much and is going to negatively impact flavor. We often look to heat up oils until they are \u201cshimmering\u201d or just before smoking, but the food being cooked determines the temperature. I recommend starting with an onion. Its my favorite veggie, tolerant to cooking, and the base of many many dishes. Chop your onion as previously directed and add them into a pan preheated with about a tablespoon or so of shimmering oil. Stir it so the oil coats the onion. You want to adjust the heat so the onion is clearly sizzling, you don\u2019t want to boil it at a low temp! You do not need to constantly stir but you should be stirring regularly to prevent burning one side. An important behavior of salt is that it tends to pull water towards it. For this reason I salt about halfway through cooking, but you won\u2019t ruin an onion by salting it at the beginning. Its better to worry if you are using enough salt rather than salting too early. And that\u2019s it: Sauteing is chop, heat your oil, put chopped food in pan, salt, stir sometimes until done. Experiment with different heat, different lengths, different salt amounts. An onion really is your oyster. Bell peppers are my next favorite food to saute, though they are notably more delicate they are still good to learn on. Its really the same concept as an onion, though you will need less salt and less time. Try different veggies and other types of foods as well. Keep doing this over and over and you will develop command over your outcomes in the kitchen. Cooking is all about repetition.\n\n\n\nMy standard \u201clazy\u201d meal is rice in the cooker, sauteed onion and bell (and jalapeno) pepper, beans, and a protein. The beans are from a can, and put in a pot on the stove with some salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and whatever else you like. Salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder is a great general base seasoning. Seasoning is always so underused, its harder than you think to overdo it. There is a line, but at least try to cross it sometime!\n\nProtein is where I must get less specific, there are too many and you should use your skills learned on the onion along with other guides on the internet. I am a fan of tofu, the post for how I season it would be as long as this, its bland and texture-less without proper care. But it is cheap. On sale for $1.55 a package this week at Aldi. Ground beef and chopped/cubed chicken breast are similar cooking experiences as onions, you just add in more seasonings and make sure it is cooked all the way through. With larger cuts of meat you should be using a thermometer, you will be cooking forever so the industry standard Thermapen One is not a horrible investment. I don\u2019t feel as comfortable speaking with any authority on cooking meat so definitely learn each meat you like as a skill in your toolbox, just using other resources than me.\n\n\n\nOnce you have these tools in your tool box you can make an insane amount of meals. My cheapest meals are when I cook what I have laying around, but I understand still wanting recipes at the beginning. But you really want to get off those, they cause you to buy something once and never touch it until it expires. Random pairings of proteins, veggies, and rice or pasta are really hard to go wrong with. [Supercook.com](http://Supercook.com) will show you recipes based on the ingredients you have, which is a great middle ground.\n\nFor a more extreme but useful example, on New Years this year I bought a whole chicken from WalMart, broke it up into 2 breasts that made burrito bowls, 2 thighs that got honey soy sauce seasoning, 4 wings that got baked and hot sauced, and a carcass. I made broth with the bones and carcass (look it up) that same night and refrigerated. I supplemented with enough rice and veggies that I only used the broth to make shrimp risotto just last night, which will last me until tomorrow. It took a lot of veggies but that was $60 of food that will last 7 days, cheaper than the previously mentioned Huel. And that included fresh carrots, onion, celery, shallot, and Parmigiano Reggiano on the risotto alone, I had other fresh veggies within that $60 the other 6 days. That\u2019s even my more expensive meals, with rice bowls and dried pasta I can very easily eat for $5 a day, fresh veggies and a protein included. I often make a pound of dried pasta, a bottle of pasta sauce and mix it with an onion and a package of tofu.\n\n\n\nI could keep going on but that would be meandering around specifics. If you can become comfortable with rice, pasta, oven roasting, and sauteing then you will be able to not only make most meals you know about, but you can make up meals extremely cheaply and quickly yet healthy.\n\nNon-mentioned skills that I live by: Cleaning while you cook, sharpening your knives, salt your food up until the point your doctor asks you to stop (or you begin tasting the salt itself).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1hvbddg/how_to_approach_cooking_if_it_is_overwhelming/", "created_utc": 1736201276.0, "score": 265, "author": "AmNotTheSun", "num_comments": 45, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1hvbddg/how_to_approach_cooking_if_it_is_overwhelming/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

I\u2019d like to lose a bit of fat (maybe 2\u20134kg), but more importantly, I want to improve my relationship with food.\n\nI\u2019ve lost weight in the past (a few years ago), but now I find myself in a really difficult place mentally when it comes to eating. I\u2019m constantly thinking about what, when, and how much I eat. It feels obsessive \u2013 and honestly, exhausting.\n\n**Activity-wise**, I exercise frequently. I cycle 10\u201315km a day to commute, and I either go for a run (5\u201310km) or do strength training at the gym (upper or lower body) pretty much every day. So I\u2019m active, and I\u2019m generally conscious of my nutrition.\n\nI\u2019ve tracked macros before and I\u2019m aware of the importance of protein. I do best when I track, but I\u2019m trying to get more protein from natural sources like meat, poultry, and dairy instead of powders. That said, I struggle to hit targets unless I *do* track.\n\nI\u2019m writing this post out of frustration after what happened today. Here\u2019s what my food looked like:\n\n* **Breakfast**: Protein porridge with blueberries + a bit of peanut butter, coffee\n* **Lunch**: 2 chicken thighs, roast veg, \u00bd a medium flatbread, apple\n* **Snacks throughout the day**:\n   * A slice of raisin malt loaf\n   * KitKat\n   * Carrot sticks + 1 falafel\n   * Small hot chocolate (semi-skimmed milk)\n   * \u00bd a salted caramel hot cross bun before my run\n\nI then did a **9k run** after work at a moderate pace/effort. After the run:\n\n* 2 eggs + roasted veg + mushrooms in the leftover flatbread\n* Skyr yoghurt with protein powder, blueberries, and some peanut butter\n\nAnd *then* I kind of spiraled. I had what I\u2019d call a mini snack-fest \u2013 random stuff like raw vegetables (I often eat raw carrots and broccoli because they feel \"guilt-free\"), some nuts, small bits of cheese. I didn\u2019t track it all, and I felt out of control, angry, and disappointed in myself.\n\nThis happens a lot \u2013 especially **after dinner** or **after exercise**. I feel like I lose all sense of portion control. I keep snacking in the hopes that something will \u201chit the spot.\u201d I drink a lot of peppermint tea too, so much that it sometimes wakes me up in the night.\n\nI\u2019m reaching out because I need help. I feel like food has become my only reward system, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m developing or already have some kind of disordered eating. I\u2019m constantly hungry or thinking about food, and it\u2019s making life harder than it needs to be.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar?  \nHow did you manage to:\n\n1. Stop erratic snacking and post-exercise binges?\n2. Rebuild a more intuitive, healthy relationship with food?\n3. Stop thinking about food 24/7?\n\nAny insights, resources, personal experiences or kind words would really be appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading \ud83d\udcac", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1k0xivg/need_help_managing_my_eating_habits_looking_for/", "created_utc": 1744842931.0, "score": 27, "author": "thomasmclmusic", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1k0xivg/need_help_managing_my_eating_habits_looking_for/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

Potatoes can be grown in containers as well, though the harvest is smaller.\n\nGreen onions: We have not had to buy green onions for a few years now because I planted the cut ends with roots in our garden and they have multiplied. They can be propagated in water super easily, just stick them in a jar.\n\nOther plants that are easy to grow:\n\nPeppermint: Grows like a weed and can be used to flavor desserts and brew herbal tea. \n\nCollard greens: Grow really well in many climates.

Any left over in Friday get put on a homemade pizza, in a chili, or frozen. \n\n- The cucumbers looked good, just some light dimpling. They have been cut into sticks and rounds to snack on and add into smoothies for the next few days.\n\nIn the past I\u2019ve gotten bags of exotic fruit  like dragonfruit, star fruit, and lychee; as well as jalape\u00f1os and serranos.

It cooks very well)\n3 cups chicken stock (I use the concentrate in a jar and put a heaping tablespoon in hot water to dissolve while I work on the rest)\n\nIdeally you want a heavy 6qt pot with a tight lid for this. I used an enamel dutch oven \n\n\n Heat your pan on medium high heat and once its good and hot, add some oil to coat bottom and add chicken. Brown the chicken until its colored on all sides. Do not stir it too much, let it sit long enough to sear. Take the chicken out of the pan and place in a bowl, do the same thing with sausage, then take that out and add to chicken in the bowl. Add a little more butter/oil and add vegetables to the brown bits left in pan. Keep stirring this, try and scrape bits off bottom, and add seasoning mix  in to vegetables. Cook them until they are soft, browned and carmelized. This will take longer than you think. Developing flavor happens during this step. Don\u2019t be afraid to let them cook. Keep stirring so nothing burns. \nAdd stock into the vegetables, and the meat, stir well. Add bay leaves. Make sure all the bits are scraped off bottom again. Let the \u201csoup\u201d come up to a slow boil and add rice. Stir again, place lid on top and reduce heat to low. \n\n\nAt this point, set a timer for ten minutes. \nDO NOT REMOVE LID and give pan just a little shimmy to move everything on the bottom a little. Do this every ten minutes for a half hour. DO NOT REMOVE THE LID \nJUST WIGGLE SLIGHTLY. \n\nAfter a half hour of cooking rice, should be done and ready to go\n\nStir it all up well, you can cut green onions on top or hot sauce if you like. \n\nhope you enjoy.

Since I primarily eat legumes and fresh fruits/veg, my grocery bill stays pretty low. \n\nMy boyfriend is a very standard meat, potatoes, and rice eater. He's not that picky, but he's also not very adventurous. Definitely not a vegetable person, but he will occasionally eat a side of streamed broccoli with chicken or beef. Typical meals at his house include chicken cooked in canned cream soup on rice or crock pot meals made of canned corn, canned soup, and hamburger. \n\nI'm the one comproming right now for his tastes, but I don't feel great after eating the way he does. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions on blend our diet preferences so I can cook for us more without me having to make him a whole separate meal? We don't live together, so I just need some go-to ideas to pull out a few days a week. Any insight is appreciated \n\nEdit: Since there seems to be confusion over my post, I want to make it clear that I WANT to make us meals we both enjoy when he comes to my place. He is not forcing me to cook or take care of him We do not live together, and I am aware I am not responsible for him. He provides the meals when I go to his place, and I am looking for meal ideas and ways to incorporate both dietary preferences because I would like him to enjoy my cooking while continuing to enjoy my own cooking.

I\u2019ve since dropped that routine to maybe 2-3 times a week because (1) sourcing eggs is crazy and (2) paying an arm and a leg for eggs is crazy. \n\nI normally hate cottage cheese (it\u2019s a texture thing for me), but figured I should learn to love it since it\u2019s still a relatively affordable way to get vegetarian protein in. \n\nSomeone suggested adding it to scrambled eggs in another sub, so I tried it. And ho-lee! \n\nSUCH a great idea! I cook the veg, then cook the cottage cheese to dry it out, then add spices (I like black pepper, cumin, chili powder, and Mexican oregano) and an egg and scramble. Add the veggies back in right before plating. It\u2019s not super pretty, but it\u2019s tasty and lets me have my morning scramble again! \n\nBefore, 3 eggs alone were $1.125 for 18g protein per breakfast. Now, 1 serving of cottage cheese + 1 egg is $0.825 for 17g protein per breakfast. A $0.30 savings each breakfast, but almost more importantly: I don\u2019t have to get to the store immediately after it opens and throw elbows to get eggs. \n\nAside: Greek yogurt also FTW.

Thanks.\n\n\u2014-\n\nCost breakdown:\n\nI can get a 48oz tub of cottage cheese for about $5.

{"title": "Reminder: frozen berries / veg are often cheaper, healthier, easier", "selftext": "I feel like this sub sometimes underappreciated or under emphasizes the value proposition of frozen produce/berries. Frozen berries and veg have two main advantages:\n\n1) They are often more nutritious. Studies have shown that frozen berries and veg are often more nutritious than their \"fresh\" counterparts because they are flash frozen when harvested and thus retain their nutrients better. Transport, exposure to heat/ sun can break down many nutrients in fresh produce.\n\n2) They last longer in the freezer. If you are short on time it is often hard to make the frequent trips to the grocery in order to always have fresh produce on hand to manage the inventory such that your produce doesn't go bad. Frozen has the advantage that it's frozen so you can buy a bunch and not have to worry about it going bad and having to manage the inventory as closely \n\n3) Often cheaper. On a per gram basis, you would be surprised how often frozen is usually cheaper than fresh. This is for the reasons mentioned above. It is more difficult for suppliers to manage the inventory because the produce will go bad faster. Often easier/cheaper to freeze.\n\nThe only real downside I can think of is that a lot of the texture is lost when freezing/thawing. So if your veg is intended for fresh salads or to eat raw, it's not really ideal. But way more often I'm using veg/berries/fruit in prepared foods where the texture is lost in cooking anyway.\n\nHope this helps someone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1jex9wj/reminder_frozen_berries_veg_are_often_cheaper/", "created_utc": 1742391812.0, "score": 692, "author": "Humble_Dimension9439", "num_comments": 63, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1jex9wj/reminder_frozen_berries_veg_are_often_cheaper/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

This sent me on a deep dive, finding out how much sodium is in all the food that I eat and it's absolutely INSANE how much sodium is in all my food, even without me trying. It's like EVERYTHING is a sodium bomb, but it's like the food industries little dirty secret that they never talk about.\n\nMy problem is:\n\n1. I'm poor\n2. I suck as a cook (but I try)\n3. Food is EXPENSIVE as can be (especially in my HCOL location)\n4. As much money as I'm spending on this food, **it better** at least taste good\n5. The only pleasure I get in life is from food (Sad I know, but I'm just being brutally honest)\n6. You mean to tell me, that I must continue to spend ridiculous amounts of money on food, and that it's going to taste unbelievably dull and I will derive zero pleasure from it? Sounds great   /s\n\n\nSeriously though, I'm open to all suggestions. What's something that the average Joe Blow would find absolutely delicious, tasty and fulfilling, yet it's miraculously low in sodium?\n\nI'm talking about an actual meal. Not just a single item. A meal that somebody would eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n\n____________________________________\n\nSide note, I'm completely fine with dying. I don't fear death. In fact, I embrace it. I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nHaving said all of that, my fear isn't dying it's having a stroke or massive heart attack and **SURVIVING**.

{"title": "Cream+Water versus milk", "selftext": "I've touched on this in another thread and I'm getting mixed information, so I'm hoping to clarify.\n\nFor awhile now, when a recipe calls for milk I've been substituting with cream and water. Here's my logic:\n\n# Health, Weight Loss, and decreasing sugar intake\n\n1 cup of Pet Skim Milk is 90 calories, 130mg of sodium, and 13g of carbs with 12g of total sugars. \n\n[https://petdairy.com/products/fat-free-milk-plastic-gallon/](https://petdairy.com/products/fat-free-milk-plastic-gallon/)\n\nIn comparison, 1 tablespoon of Hood Light Cream is 30 calories, 10mg of sodium, and <1g of carbs and <1g of total sugars.\n\n[https://hood.com/products/cream/cream/light-cream](https://hood.com/products/cream/cream/light-cream)\n\nIn theory, I could add 3 tablespoons of cream and just under 1 cup of water to create cooking milk that's the same 90 calories as the skim milk, but with far less sodium and sugar. In practice, though, I've been doing 1 tablespoon of cream per cup of water instead of 3.\n\nCream+water DOES have a little more fat, though. Cream is 3g of fat per tablespoon with 1.5g of saturated fat, while skim milk has 0 fat.\n\nCream+water also has 10mg of cholesterol, while milk has 5mg.\n\nI haven't been able to tell a difference between this and regular milk when cooking dishes.\n\nAm I wrong in my theory that using cream+water instead of milk is better for fat loss?\n\n# Money\n\nLocally, a gallon of skim milk is $3.19 /gallon, which is 16 cups. That's $0.20 /cup.\n\nA 16 ounce container of Hood Light Cream is also $3.19, but with 1 tablespoon per cup of water I can make 32 cups.

{"title": "Instant Pot Veggie Stock = Game Changer", "selftext": "(doesn't require an instant Pot, but saves time)\n\nIf you eat *any* amount of fresh produce, as I hope you all do, and you aren't saving your veggie scraps, you are missing out on tons of flavor and potentially wasting tens (even hundreds) of dollars in store bought broth/stock every year.\n\nAt all times, I keep a gallon zip lock bag in my freezer. Whenever I trim/peel veggies for cooking, or identify produce I know is on the way out, I toss them in the bag. This includes:\n- onion peels/ends\n- carrot skin, dry/white/wilty baby carrots\n- Garlic ends\n- bell (or other) pepper stems/innards\n- too small to peel ginger nubs\n- green bean ends\n- celery trimmings\n- fresh herbs\n- mushroom stems\n- eggplant skins\n\nThe only things I don't save are potato peels and veggies from the broccoli/cauliflower/cabbage/brussel sprout family, or most leafy greens. I also save parmesan rinds.\n\nAs soon as the bag is full, which for my family of 1 is maybe once a month or so, I throw the contents into my 6qt instant pot, a little salt, some whole pepper corns, maybe a bay leaf (or cracked off parts of bay leaves that are annoying to fish out of soup), fill to the max line with water, and cook on high pressure for 40 minutes.\n\nI then pour through a mesh strainer into 32oz leftover containers. Depending on the veggies, and how full my bag was, I get between 3-4 full containers. The cheapest 4 cup boxes of low/reduced sodium veggie stock at the local super market usually run over $2 a pop, and have a fraction of the flavor. If I stretched the gallon of veggies into two batches, I could get the equivalent of 8 cartons and still have a better product.\n\nI always have 4 cups of broth in the fridge, and the rest saved in the freezer. The flavor always varies depending on what veggies I cooked with, which I think is fun. I use my stock in any recipe that calls for water, veggie, chicken, or even beef broth.\n\nEdit(s):\n\n1. As somebody commented, if you cook with meat more than I do and save bones, those work too! Cook times will just be longer.\n2. The value and sustainability proposition is unreal. Assuming you already used the veggies, you are getting a somewhat pricey product as a free bonus. It makes me want to buy/eat more veggies as a result. If you are using this to get rid of \"aging\" product, you are still getting some of your money back instead of wasting. This is my favorite way to dispose of leftover veggie trays (carrots, celery, even cherry tomatoes) that are typically past their prime at sale. \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1j2sdgn/instant_pot_veggie_stock_game_changer/", "created_utc": 1741033290.0, "score": 62, "author": "WrongSperm2019", "num_comments": 25, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1j2sdgn/instant_pot_veggie_stock_game_changer/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

There\u2019s no way I\u2019m ever going back to box cereals or pre-packaged instant oatmeal.\n\nOatmeal is a great choice for breakfast every day! It\u2019s packed with fiber, particularly beta-glucan, which supports heart health by lowering cholesterol. It also provides sustained energy, helps regulate blood sugar, and is rich in essential nutrients like magnesium, iron, and B vitamins.\n\nTo keep it balanced, pair your oatmeal with protein (like nuts, seeds, or yogurt) and healthy fats (such as nut butter or flaxseeds). Also, varying your toppings (e.g., fruits, spices, or different nuts) can help prevent monotony and ensure a well-rounded diet.\n\nHere\u2019s my simple and delicious microwaved oatmeal recipe:\n\n**Base Ingredients:**\n\n* Heaping 1/3 cup rolled oats\n* a small handful of raisins\n* 1 pinch kosher salt\n* 1 cup water\n\n**My Typical Mix-ins:**\n\n* a dusting of cinnamon\n* a handful of walnuts\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 1 Tbsp milled flax seed or chia seeds\n* a drizzle of maple syrup or honey (optional)\n* a dash of half and half (optional)\n\n**Alternative mix-ins & additional toppings:**\n\n* Sliced banana, diced peeled apple, applesauce, blueberries, strawberries, strawberry preserves, Greek yogurt, peanut butter, almond butter, shredded toasted coconut, macadamia nuts, etc.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large microwave-safe bowl, add oats, raisins, and salt then water.\n2. Microwave for 4 minutes on 70% power.\n3. Add mix-ins and stir.\n4. Let sit for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. This will allow it to cool down and thicken up.\n5. Add toppings, if any, and enjoy!\n\nFor a richer taste, swap the water for milk or pour some half and half in after cooking.\n\nFor extra protein, stir in nut butter or a spoonful of Greek yogurt.\n\n**Total Cost Per Serving (approximate):**\n\n* Basic oatmeal (oats + raisins +  salt + water) \u2192 $0.15\n* My oatmeal recipe with cinnamon, walnuts, and maple syrup added \u2192 $0.55\n* Deluxe oatmeal with milk, honey, berries, and nuts \u2192 $1.35\n\nThis makes oatmeal an extremely budget-friendly, nutritious breakfast!

Also anything else you want, it\u2019s literally just a lazy fried rice, it\u2019s hard to mess up. Also you can add whatever seasonings you like, of course. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to go good with your veggie mix or what you\u2019ll like, though. I kind of just add whatever is in my pantry and sounds good at the moment, but garlic powder is always pretty good in most things.\n\nYou\u2019re gonna defrost + saut\u00e9 your frozen veggies in a pan with some oil or butter. You\u2019re gonna add the oil or butter once there\u2019s no water/frost left. If you\u2019re using butter, I recommend adding just half of it now, and the second half after you\u2019ve fried the rice. I like the texture better that way, but it\u2019s your rice! While that\u2019s going on, get your cooked rice out (the instant rice takes just a minute in the microwave, so I do that). Once the veggies are thawed and cooking, throw the rice in. Just be careful if there\u2019s any water in it still- that mixing with the oil will cause a lot of splatter. Mix that up and fry it for a few minutes. Add some msg and soy sauce or coconut aminos. Just a tiny bit will work fine, you can always add more after. A little goes a long way. Then, add your eggs- however many you want, I\u2019m not a cop (also, add the other half of the butter, if you\u2019re doing that), and mix it up by folding while frying it. When the eggs are cooked, you\u2019re done! You can also add meat or fish or something if you want, or a side of more veggies. I personally use two eggs for extra protein, and go heavy on the veggies, but you do you!

Like, they\u2019ve got gardens, eggs for days, and their grocery bill is basically just \u201cbuy some flour and call it a day.\u201d But then I\u2019m like, what if I\u2019m just romanticizing dirt?  \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the chaos in my brain:  \r\nPros: Cheaper rent, fresh veggies I grew myself (assuming I don\u2019t kill them), maybe a goat named Gerald for moral support.  \r\n\r\nCons: Driving everywhere like I\u2019m in a Fast & Furious movie, no more DoorDash (RIP), and what if I\u2019m bad at farming?\r\n\rI read somewhere (PBS, I think? Don\u2019t quote me) that rural life might actually be more expensive for stuff like gas and random groceries. But then cities are like, \u201cPay $1,000 for a closet and cry about it.\u201d So, I\u2019m stuck.  \r\n\r\nHas anyone here actually done this? Like, packed up, moved to the middle of nowhere, and started growing kale like it\u2019s your job? Did it work? Or am I just gonna end up with a garden full of weeds and a chicken that hates me?  I can get a remote work tho, so if things get worse I can still order food but that would be costly if the stores are far away.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you\u2019ve got tips for growing food on a budget\u2014whether I\u2019m in the city or the sticks\u2014hit me with them. I\u2019m desperate. Eating cheap and healthy feels like trying to solve a Rubik\u2019s Cube blindfolded right now.   \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk. I need answers.

I moved out of my parents house at 22 and from then on I didn\u2019t want to make my own food.

As of January, I have attempted to go food shopping cook for myself and stop ordering! \n\nPlease tell me if what I eat on a day-to-day basis is OK\n\nFor breakfast, I usually eat a banana with a yogurt, maybe a ham and cheese, sometimes I make pancakes or French toast or omelettes. This morning for breakfast I had a banana, a kiwi watermelon and an iced coffee. \n\nFor lunch, I usually eat a ham sandwich, or chicken pot pie (frozen) or a bagel sandwich, sometimes I eat leftover pasta that I made, or I get a quick bite either at Panera bread or a sandwich spot. I love sandwiches.  \n\nFor dinner, I\u2019ve been eating pastas, a lot of grilled chicken, sometimes I\u2019ll have Ramen noodles with boiled eggs, sometimes I\u2019ll have tacos or maybe if I\u2019m not feeling too hungry a hot pocket and I really like to make breakfast for dinner sometimes as well. \n\nFor dessert (which I have every night) I\u2019d either have chocolate chip cookies with whole milk (I drink whole milk every night) maybe a slice of cheesecake if I have some, maybe some chips or an ice cream sandwich.

{"title": "Produce and Protein", "selftext": "Hi! This sub has given me some lovely tips and I wanted to share my own that I have been using for years now as a very broke, but highly health motivated person. \n\n1. Super cheap produce.\nI live in one of the most expensive towns in the country, getting fresh veggies will break your bank. I didn\u2019t know about this before but most grocery stores have little stands with bagged up produce that is about to go bad or just needs to be gotten rid of to make room for new shipments. This week I got a whole weeks worth of produce for about $5, it would\u2019ve been $20 regularly. \n( if you don\u2019t think your store has discount produce section, ask a worker and it might just be in an unusual place)\nThis adds so much variety, flavor, and nutrition to my meals. I am also able to freeze, ferment, and stew a lot of it. It is typically a steady supply of bananas and potatoes as well which are great carbs when you get tired of rice. \n\n2. Protein\nI am very protein forward since I lift, however this is often one of the more expensive parts of a meal, particularly lean protein ( I define as having close to a 10:1 calorie:protein ratio). \nSoybeans are an amazing source of lean protein, are cheap, and also supply the body with Omega-3\u2019s. A block of tofu is usually around $1 and can make 2-3 meals depending on your needs. Shelled soybeans are a great protein addition to salads and rice bowls, and they can be bought cheap frozen. \n \n2.1 Bone Broth \nGoing to your local butcher and asking for scrap bones and making bone broth is another way to improve protein intake and nutrient density. Often you can get a ridiculous amount of bones for very cheap. \n\n2.2 Eggs Right Now\nDuring *avian flue times* if you live in suburbs or the country, try finding a neighbor with chickens via Facebook groups. I get mine for about $4 a dozen right now which is much cheaper than stores (and better quality).\n\n2.3 Organ Meat\nOrgan meat is very nutrient dense and can fill in some gaps for us broke people who are more prone to nutrient deficiencies. Same deal as the bones with the butcher, they usually go through a ton of organ meat as it isn\u2019t a big seller and will give it to you for practically free (maybe even free if they are cool). I personally have a hard time with liver but you can use it to stretch out your ground meat. But heart meat is usually quite good. \n\n3. Flavor\nIt\u2019s usually cheaper to make your own sauces at home (especially with discount peppers and aromatic veggies and herbs) so look for some staple recipes. Also HERB GARDEN!! I have a couple herbs in a windowsill herb garden that I got on Facebook marketplace for free. A lot of local gardening stores or just avid gardeners will give you starters for various herbs for very cheap or free since a lot of herbs grow like weeds. It\u2019s a great way to up the flavor in your food, as well as reap the health benefits of fresh herbs such as rosemary. \n\n4. Restaurant Food \nIf you live in a city it\u2019s worth looking into an app like \u201cget to go\u201d, which is an app for restaurants to reduce food waste and sell food at very discounted costs at the end of the day. I live in a small isolated town right now so it is not use to me, but I\u2019ve heard it works in some cities.

Though you do see the pieces of chicken, they are too soaked in the sauce so I buy the pain and add my own.  \n\nI noticed a few days ago on Amazon that they now have Beef Creations.

Sweet BBQ is like you are just swallowing spoons of mediocre bbq sauce. This part of an Amazon review is spot on: \n\n*Saw these in Walmart. I wish I hadn't. It tastes terrible.

{"title": "How to Approach Cooking If It Is Overwhelming", "selftext": "I am incredibly far from an expert but I saw a post on another sub of a man excited to save so much money spending $270 exclusively eating (drinking?) Huel for a month. Reader, you can eat fresh veggies and Parmigiano Reggiano for $270. I recently got a friend into cooking and was massively helped myself by [a post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/jwjn2p/from_a_professional_chef_to_you_the_tricks_that/)on this sub by a real chef, but feel that was too detailed for someone overwhelmed in the kitchen itself like my friend. That post is great if you know how to cook but not how to shop. This post is directed at someone who sees too many unknown steps when you step in the kitchen, or is afraid of things going wrong.\n\nThere are only two big things that you cannot do on a stove. You can not put water on an oil fire. If your fire is oil you turn off your burner and cover the pot/pan. This does not happen often, but needs to be known. Next, pan handles go over the stove. A handle sticking out over open air is just asking to be flipped. This will protect you from most all major burns and the only thing you can really ruin is the dish you are making. Making mistakes with your cooking is highly encouraged and are required to get better. When cooking I am referencing my full catalog of everything I have done wrong. Avoid enough large mistakes and you end up doing things right. Good enough can taste damn good.\n\nIf you want to research a bunch of modern science you can get a healthier diet than mine, but I guarantee (not legally) that following my diet is healthier than fast food or processed frozen meals. My focus is on being comfortable cooking non-processed individual foods. If you can do that you are beating most people on health as well as likely being a competent cook.\n\nGetting a rice cooker changed my life. I can get a slightly better tasting rice by being a maniac about the whole process, but washing your rice and throwing it in a cooker is just too easy to pass up. Washing your rice is how restaurants get individual rice grains and not a clumpy mess, it washes off the excess starch. I put it in a strainer and run under cold water for maybe 15-20 seconds. Make sure to generously salt it once in the cooker. Even the cheap ones with just one button work well, but I use [this one](https://www.aromaco.com/product/digital-rice-grain-multicooker-arc-914sbd/) (I endorse the number of functions not this specific brand). \n\n\n\nNext, while your rice is cooking for you, lets get comfortable with veggies. I prefer to saute or bake/roast them. Steamed bags are great too but we are cooking here! Chopping examples [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGS067s0zo) and [Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZGqtmwboHU).\n\nRoasting is super simple \u2013 cut up veggies, mix them with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, then google how long they roast for, and roast in the oven on a baking sheet at the temp google says or 425. In time you will learn the perfect amount of olive oil and salt or how to adjust the time based on cut size, but you will get close enough following the internet here. Roasted potatoes are an absolute must. Potatoes in general are the real super-food but some Yukon Golds in the oven will make my whole week. I like using parchment paper or aluminum foil for an easy cleanup.\n\nSauteing is why I am writing this. If you can get comfortable with a pan then you can cook so many meals. Sauteing is shallow frying in oil. Oil is a huge bickering point in both flavor and health camps, its a valid conversation to have, later. Unless you have an opinion already you can start with olive oil for lower temps and canola oil for higher temps. Each oil has a different \u201csmoke point\u201d which is the temperature it starts to form scary words like \u201cfree radicals\u201d. A little bit of smoke from your oil is very okay but constant heavy smoke is too much and is going to negatively impact flavor. We often look to heat up oils until they are \u201cshimmering\u201d or just before smoking, but the food being cooked determines the temperature. I recommend starting with an onion. Its my favorite veggie, tolerant to cooking, and the base of many many dishes. Chop your onion as previously directed and add them into a pan preheated with about a tablespoon or so of shimmering oil. Stir it so the oil coats the onion. You want to adjust the heat so the onion is clearly sizzling, you don\u2019t want to boil it at a low temp! You do not need to constantly stir but you should be stirring regularly to prevent burning one side. An important behavior of salt is that it tends to pull water towards it. For this reason I salt about halfway through cooking, but you won\u2019t ruin an onion by salting it at the beginning. Its better to worry if you are using enough salt rather than salting too early. And that\u2019s it: Sauteing is chop, heat your oil, put chopped food in pan, salt, stir sometimes until done. Experiment with different heat, different lengths, different salt amounts. An onion really is your oyster. Bell peppers are my next favorite food to saute, though they are notably more delicate they are still good to learn on. Its really the same concept as an onion, though you will need less salt and less time. Try different veggies and other types of foods as well. Keep doing this over and over and you will develop command over your outcomes in the kitchen. Cooking is all about repetition.\n\n\n\nMy standard \u201clazy\u201d meal is rice in the cooker, sauteed onion and bell (and jalapeno) pepper, beans, and a protein. The beans are from a can, and put in a pot on the stove with some salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and whatever else you like. Salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder is a great general base seasoning. Seasoning is always so underused, its harder than you think to overdo it. There is a line, but at least try to cross it sometime!\n\nProtein is where I must get less specific, there are too many and you should use your skills learned on the onion along with other guides on the internet. I am a fan of tofu, the post for how I season it would be as long as this, its bland and texture-less without proper care. But it is cheap. On sale for $1.55 a package this week at Aldi. Ground beef and chopped/cubed chicken breast are similar cooking experiences as onions, you just add in more seasonings and make sure it is cooked all the way through. With larger cuts of meat you should be using a thermometer, you will be cooking forever so the industry standard Thermapen One is not a horrible investment. I don\u2019t feel as comfortable speaking with any authority on cooking meat so definitely learn each meat you like as a skill in your toolbox, just using other resources than me.\n\n\n\nOnce you have these tools in your tool box you can make an insane amount of meals. My cheapest meals are when I cook what I have laying around, but I understand still wanting recipes at the beginning. But you really want to get off those, they cause you to buy something once and never touch it until it expires. Random pairings of proteins, veggies, and rice or pasta are really hard to go wrong with. [Supercook.com](http://Supercook.com) will show you recipes based on the ingredients you have, which is a great middle ground.\n\nFor a more extreme but useful example, on New Years this year I bought a whole chicken from WalMart, broke it up into 2 breasts that made burrito bowls, 2 thighs that got honey soy sauce seasoning, 4 wings that got baked and hot sauced, and a carcass. I made broth with the bones and carcass (look it up) that same night and refrigerated. I supplemented with enough rice and veggies that I only used the broth to make shrimp risotto just last night, which will last me until tomorrow. It took a lot of veggies but that was $60 of food that will last 7 days, cheaper than the previously mentioned Huel. And that included fresh carrots, onion, celery, shallot, and Parmigiano Reggiano on the risotto alone, I had other fresh veggies within that $60 the other 6 days. That\u2019s even my more expensive meals, with rice bowls and dried pasta I can very easily eat for $5 a day, fresh veggies and a protein included. I often make a pound of dried pasta, a bottle of pasta sauce and mix it with an onion and a package of tofu.\n\n\n\nI could keep going on but that would be meandering around specifics. If you can become comfortable with rice, pasta, oven roasting, and sauteing then you will be able to not only make most meals you know about, but you can make up meals extremely cheaply and quickly yet healthy.\n\nNon-mentioned skills that I live by: Cleaning while you cook, sharpening your knives, salt your food up until the point your doctor asks you to stop (or you begin tasting the salt itself).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1hvbddg/how_to_approach_cooking_if_it_is_overwhelming/", "created_utc": 1736201276.0, "score": 270, "author": "AmNotTheSun", "num_comments": 45, "permalink": "/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/1hvbddg/how_to_approach_cooking_if_it_is_overwhelming/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Eating cheap... in LA?", "selftext": "Hey all! I've been lurking on this sub for a while and I've really enjoyed all of your thoughts when it comes to eating well. I just moved to LA for my first official job out of college and have made a full week of meals for just over $100. I was very worried about budgeting for food but I'm very proud of myself for meeting my goal. I'm not much of a cook but I'm glad that I can feed myself. I am not a huge fan of cooking itself so I was trying to stay out of the kitchen for most of the week and meal prep food.\n\nI planned out my week ahead of time with the foods I wanted to make but didn't restrict myself from picking up a few convenience items and snacks as well, so I probably could have done it for around $80. I'm very proud of myself for proving that it's possible to do so in a place that's known for high grocery prices.\n\nMy breakfast this week is a breakfast crunchwrap with egg, spinach and breakfast sausage. My lunch/dinner choices are stuffed bell peppers and chicken alfredo. I also picked up my favorite grab-and-go breakfast essentials shakes, a few boxes of mac and cheese, some buldak ramen and several packets of tuna + crackers, peanut butter and jelly (though I forgot bread, lol), chips and popcorn.   \n  \nIt was hard for me to learn to cook in college because I always felt like my roommates were really awful about equal use of the kitchen/shared spaces. They were often in there for at least 2-3 hours per night making dinner so I felt like I never had the opportunity to do so because they would go to bed around 8 p.m. so I couldn't be in the kitchen making noise without disturbing them, plus they would only do the dishes right before bed. Because of that, college had a lot of takeout for me. My new roommates are older and a lot more considerate. I'm enjoying having my 2-hour cooking session once a week on Sundays and getting everything set up for my work week.\n\nTwo thoughts: my bell peppers (I bought 6) were too expensive because they are out of season, so I might skip that recipe for a while. I feel like that should have been common sense but I've never thought of seasonal eating and how it can impact your grocery bill. The 6 eggs in my breakfast crunchwrap were insanely expensive ($4-5) because of the avian flu rearing its ugly head out here.

{"title": "chicken broth from rotisserie bones : any further advice? ", "selftext": "Last week on a post-thanksgiving post, the community here convinced me to try making broth at home to stretch a rotisserie chicken further.\n\nThanks to  u/transnavigation, u/harrold_potterson, u/ladyarcher2017, u/natty_patty and others, my first try went very well!\n\n* my kitchen is small & my equipment is limited, but my 4 liter pot and my palm-sized strainer-scoop did the job perfectly well\n* it was easy : 4 hours of simmering, about 4 times I scooped off the scummy foam\n* it was glorious : I had just over 2,5 liters of broth, which tasted both very clean and surprisingly complex for just water & carcass. It was cloudy and milky, not watery at all as I feared when I started\n\nMany thanks again!\n\nFor this week's rotisserie chicken, I do have some questions, if that's okay?\n\nA. Is this division in 3 piles okay?\n\n* the meat I want to eat in 4 meals (2 hot meals, 2 portions of chicken salad on bread)\n* the skin to roast a 2nd time for crunch on the chicken salad\n* everything else for the broth : obviously bones and cartilage, but also veins and sinews and membranes and connective tissue, bits of skin I couldn't separate (like from the very tip of the tailbone) and clumps of fat I would normally throw away\n\nB. The \"finger\" parts of the wings were dry, and the spice rub on it looked a bit burnt. Should I take those out or is it fine to just simmer those along with all the rest?\n\nC. How important is it to scoop off that foam? last time, I could leave my desk (working from home) every hour for it, but tomorrow I'm the only one on call (for the last few days of the year) so I think I'll only manage it 2 times. Should I wait till after work to start, so I can pay more attention to it?\n\nD. People advised me to include vegetables / vegetable scraps like parsley stalks etc\n\n* what is okay to include? Can I put in the apple core from my breakfast apple? What if the parsley leaves have started yellowing or I've got some carrots that are too floppy to enjoy eating raw?\n* how long should the vegetables simmer? The full 4 hours seems very very very long, no?\n* do I season the broth as it simmers, or as I use it in a dish?\n\nE. after it cooled a bit, I removed the bones & strained it into a measuring cup. As it settled, I noticed there was still some foam, so I scooped that again. Then I left it to cool, but when I took it out again, I noticed there were a few \"eyes\" on it.\n\nI'm guessing those were puddles of fat? I stirred vigorously to make them disappear, but now I wonder if I should have scooped them off too?\n\nF. I took note of the tip about freezing any extra portions! Last week, I just used it all in one go in a cabbage soup. I left it overnight on the hob and I saw it developed a skin the next morning. After I boiled it again, it was going & tasted fine, but I'm still a bit wary. I guess my question is how often it's safe to reheat/re-boil the broth, or if I should be more careful about making smaller portions?\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \nI hope this list isn't excessive or annoying! If it's against the rules, I'll remove it without problem.

Sometimes I procrastinate it to the point I feel dizzy and I just \"nap the hunger away\". Basically, I have been living off yogurt, fruits, carrots and slices of cheese... Because those are easy to eat. Also, I can't make anything using an oven at the moment.\n\nI'm not a good cook. Back home I had a maid cooking for me (which is normal in upper middle class brazilian households) but of couse I am willing to learn as long as it does not take longer than 10min each dish. Yes I do want to dedicate time to it but right now I just don't have the energy.\n\nI have moved countries almost a year ago and since then I have been an anxious wreck all the time.
