{"title": "\"Everlasting Rolls\" - probably 140 to 150 years old recipe!", "selftext": "I want to share a recipe that was my mom\u2019s great aunt\u2019s recipe for rolls (my mom would be 105 this year so you can see how old this recipe is).  Aunt Kate called the recipe \u201cEverlasting Rolls\u201d.  My mom said that was because you can make the dough and just leave it in the refrigerator until you want to make rolls.  They are not really everlasting - the dough is used up in our home easily within a week.  I just keep punching the dough down in between bakes.  Take out only what you need to bake for the day and then refrigerate. \n\nI have attached the recipe cards that were typed from the original recipe \u2013 my dad made some changes when he decided to organize mom\u2019s recipe box!\n\nThis is a recipe I have made for many years and now that I weigh most of the ingredients, I have updated the recipe to be more current.\n\nThese make great dinner rolls as well as hamburger buns and hot dog buns.\n\nI hope you enjoy!\n\nAunt Kate's Everlasting Rolls\n\nUpdated version for instant yeast\n\n1 \t\t\tpackage  yeast         instant 7 grams \n7 cups  \t\tall purpose flour      840 grams\n1/2 cup  \t\tCrisco shortening      113 grams or 4 oz.\n1/2 cup \t\tsugar\t\t       99 grams\n1                   \tegg\n2 1/2 teaspoons  \tsalt\t\t       15 grams\n2  cups  \t\twater lukewarm\n\nCombine 7 cups flour and instant yeast in a bowl and set aside.\n\nCream shortening and sugar for about 4 to 5 minutes.  Add egg and salt and continue beating for a couple of minutes.  I use the beater attachment to do this and then switch to the dough hook when adding the flour and water.\n\nAdd the water and mix a bit.  Then add the flour (may use up to 8 cups) until the dough comes away from the side.  If you have a bowl shield, be sure to use it so the flour doesn\u2019t jump out of the bowl.\n\nKnead until it is elastic - about 7 to 9 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, cover and place in  a warm area to double.  I use my warming oven set on proof.  I left it in close to two hours \u2013 I think \u2013 but start checking at one hour!\n\nKnead again and form into rolls (single roll, hamburger buns, Aunt Kate's favorite was 3 small balls in a muffin pan).\n\nBrush with butter and let rise.  \n\nBake in 425 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes or until done.  I\u2019ve been using a 400 degree oven and I like the results better.\n\nBake only amount needed, putting the remaining dough in the refrigerator until you want to make more rolls later.  Be sure to use a container large enough to hold the dough because it will expand.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagerecipes/comments/ircuzi/everlasting_rolls_probably_140_to_150_years_old/", "created_utc": 1599918333.0, "score": 28, "author": "bakingmag", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/vintagerecipes/comments/ircuzi/everlasting_rolls_probably_140_to_150_years_old/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}
