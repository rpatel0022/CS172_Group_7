Whisk and introduce slowly, stop when you get to your desired consistency.  \n  \nSlowly mix all dough ingredients together as thoroughly as possible. I use a kitchen aid stand mixer with a beater blade attachment; but really whatever way you can ensure there are no lumps. When handling the dough, oil will work best to avoid sticking. Oiling your hands and even your spatula will work wonders.  \n  \nSpread dough batter on a lightly oiled parchment paper in a rectangle 11\u201dx16\u201d. It\u2019ll be about 1 cm thick, or about 1/2\u201d. On half the dough (8\u201dx11\u201d) spread the Cinnamon Sugar Paste evenly. Fold the parchment in half so the paste is sandwiched in between. Carefully place the dough into the buttered baking pan.  \n  \nBrush/Coat the top with butter and sprinkle on an even layer using the remaining dry Cinnamon Sugar Seasoning. I didn\u2019t use all of what I had, about 1 tbsp remaining because I felt I had enough. If you can\u2019t see the raw dough, that\u2019s where you can stop. Also, if you have any left over melted butter, drizzle that over the top.  \n  \nCover the pan for 2-3 hours at room temp and wait till it rises about doubles in size.   \n  \n**Bake:**  \nHeat oven to 400\u00baF.  \nPlace in the middle to upper part of the oven.  \nBake for 30 minutes till browned and cooked through.  \nRemove and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.  \nPour Frosting liberally over the top and along the sides.  \nRemove from pan, cut, and enjoy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j3ddit", "created_utc": 1741102283.0, "score": 971, "author": "Hex-o-matic", "num_comments": 40, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1j3ddit/homemade_cinnamon_roll_focaccia_recipe/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "After 5 test pies, I believe I achieved a perfect GF pumpkin pie", "selftext": "I've been trying recipes for the last couple of weeks, unhappy with the recipes I could find online. So I finally landed on this after making a ton of adjustments. \n\nCrust, based off loopywhisk recipe, with adjustments\n\n* 188g superfine white rice flour\n* 113g potato starch\n* 74g cornstarch\n* 1 tsp granulated sugar\n* 1 \u00bd tsp xanthan gum\n* \u00bd tsp kosher salt\n* 250 g (2 sticks + 2 tbsp) unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd inch (1cm) cubes, chilled\n* 150 g (\u00bd cup + 2 tbsp) cold water\n\n* In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, xanthan gum and salt.\n\n* Add the cold cubed butter and toss it in the flour until each piece is coated.\n\n* Squish each cube of butter between your fingers to form small, thin sheets of butter. Once you\u2019ve squished all the butter pieces, toss them again with the flour to ensure that they\u2019re evenly distributed. Be sure to check that you\u2019ve squished all the butter pieces before adding the water.\n\n* Add the cold water and mix well with a fork or rubber spatula until the dough starts coming together. After you\u2019ve added all the water, the dough will still look very dry \u2013 don\u2019t be tempted to add more.\n\n* Gently squeeze and knead the dough, pressing it against the sides of the bowl, until it comes together in a shaggy ball with little-to-no dry patches (this can take up to 5 minutes). If absolutely necessary, and if after 5 minutes the dough still hasn\u2019t come together, sprinkle a tiny amount of water on the most persistent dry patches.\nThe final dough should hold together in a ball but will not look perfectly smooth or evenly hydrated. That\u2019s perfectly fine, the flour in the dough will hydrate more evenly during the next refrigeration step.\n\n* Chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes or until the pie dough feels firm but not hard when you press down on it with your finger.\n\n* Tap on the chilled pie dough rectangle (along its length) with a rolling pin to make it more pliable.\nRoll it out into an approximately 6x18 inch (15x45cm) rectangle (no need to be super precise about it). Turn the dough so that a short end is closest to you. Brush off any excess flour and fold the dough as you would an A4 letter \u2013 the top third down towards the middle and the bottom third up over it. This is called a \"letter fold\".\n\n* Rotate the dough by 90 degrees (so that the open ends are closest and farthest from you). Roll out into a similar-sized rectangle and repeat the letter fold. For best results, complete a total of 4-6 letter folds (the more you do, the greater the flakiness). If the dough becomes too soft at any point, chill it in the fridge for 15-30 minutes before proceeding.\n\n* After the final letter fold, wrap the dough in cling film and chill it for at least 30 minutes or until needed. (If you chill it for longer than 1 hour before using, soften it for about 15-30 minutes at room temperature, so that it\u2019s pliable.)\n\n* Preheat oven to 425. Roll out your dough onto a floured parchment sheet, rolling to 3mm thick.\n\n* Flip the dough into your pie pan and crimp your edges as you see fit. This dough is almost a puff pastry so keep this in mind, it will fluff up. \n\n* Dock you bottom and sides of the crust generously. Chill for 30 minutes in freezer. While this is chilling, place a sheet pan in your oven to get hot.\n\n* Once your crust is done chilling, place a parchment round and some pie weights or beans in the pie. \n\n* Place pie in oven and set your timer for 10 minutes. During this time, beat an egg for an egg wash\n\n* Take the pie from the oven, remove the weights and parchment. Generously brush down the entire crust with you4 egg wash, ensuring every bit is coated. This will keep your crust from getting soggy later. \n\n* Put the crust back into the oven, set the timer for 10 minutes, and watch for the bottom of the crust to be cooked through, and the edges are just starting to become golden. Remove crust from oven and cool. \n\nFilling recipe in comments", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h1avf1", "created_utc": 1732731312.0, "score": 868, "author": "Current_Cost_1597", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1h1avf1/after_5_test_pies_i_believe_i_achieved_a_perfect/", "html_title": ""}

When I read that she had written a couple of cookbooks, I knew I needed them in my life! \n\nThey arrived yesterday, and so far, these books do not disappoint! I can\u2019t wait to try the recipes and tips! I also picked up the Cannelle et Vanille book, and I can tell that it will be in regular rotation as well. I will post pics and an update once I\u2019ve baked several things from each book. Right now, I\u2019m trying to decide which kind of cake I want to start with! \ud83d\ude2c", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4gf5n", "created_utc": 1737231657.0, "score": 572, "author": "livbennett", "num_comments": 34, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1i4gf5n/these_came_in_yesterday_and_i_am_so_excited/", "html_title": ""}

I've been working on losing some extra pounds as well so getting a nutritious meal service has been pretty attractive. I found a completely GF meal service called \"Snap Kitchen\" after getting very sick from a cookunity meal and decided to try it out for a week. I'm in a very priveleged position to be able to get this service because it is damn expensive y'all. Definitely not frugal whatsoever. Here's my pros and cons/ reviews:\n\nPros:\n* Their entire facilities are gluten free and I felt very safe eating everything. \n* The meals are all generally around 500 calories and fit really well into a 1500 cal diet.\n* Really good variety of meals, and felt nice to not have to cherry pick meals I could eat. \n* Refrigerated, not frozen, everything held up really well for a full week.\n* Meals seemed well balanced, and had a lot of protein\n* No upcharged meals, you could get steak meals for the same price as chicken meals etc.\n* Almost all of them tasted really good.\n\nCons: \n* Price-if you get their 6 meal plan, it's $14.67 each. If you get their 12 meal plan, its $11.67 each.\n* Almost every meal contains meat, and not a ton of seafood options. If you're veggie or pescatarian this won't work for you.\n* The meals look ugly.\n* The meals will feel small if you're not trying to diet. \n\nI'll list the meals in a comment below along with my ratings! \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ix8biy", "created_utc": 1740419846.0, "score": 562, "author": "Current_Cost_1597", "num_comments": 70, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1ix8biy/a_week_of_eating_gf_meal_delivery_service_snap/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "I\u2019m so tired of the narrative that gluten free = healthy", "selftext": "Even on this subreddit it\u2019s often pushed that gluten free is healthier for everyone and it\u2019s just a broad positive change to your life. Gluten isn\u2019t inherently unhealthy unless your body is reacting poorly to it. The reason some people feel better not eating gluten (without an allergy/an intolerance/celiac) is that they eat out less and are more conscious about what they eat.\n\nFor example: I\u2019m gluten free. My spouse is not. We eat the exact same meals every day except breakfast because they have toast and I have a gluten free bagel. For other meals it\u2019s a carb (often rice or a GF pasta), a protein, and some vegetables. Last week we made chicken cacciatore + rice. This week we\u2019re making chicken teriyaki and roasted veggies. Our meals aren\u2019t healthy because they\u2019re gluten free (they\u2019re just inherently gluten free). It\u2019s because we home cook meals and don\u2019t eat out often.\n\nAnd it seems like a non issue but the push to demonise perfectly normal parts of human diets is how people fall into the alt right pipeline. First it\u2019s \u201cgluten is a part of processed unhealthy foods\u201d then it\u2019s \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why my child\u2019s natural immune system isn\u2019t good enough and I have to vaccinate them\u201d.\n\nGluten is just a protein. Processed like any other protein in your diet. It exists naturally. Some of us simply have bodies that overreact to it. It\u2019s no different from being lactose intolerant or having a nut allergy. Nuts and lactose aren\u2019t inherently bad, some people just can\u2019t have them.\n\n\n*And* gluten free food can be unhealthy. Sugar is gluten free and an excess of sugar can cause issues for people. Salt is gluten free and for some people an excess can cause issues with blood pressure. Cyanide is gluten free. Battery acid is gluten free. Bricks are generally gluten free and it\u2019ll still hurt if it hits you in the face.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1ji9ldm/im_so_tired_of_the_narrative_that_gluten_free/", "created_utc": 1742763528.0, "score": 557, "author": "Reaniro", "num_comments": 151, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1ji9ldm/im_so_tired_of_the_narrative_that_gluten_free/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Does have wheat but gluten free!!!\n\nFor 1 pizza\n\n\n10grams whole psyllium husk\n\n\n100 grams warm water for psyllium \n\n\n222 grams caputo fioreglut flour\n\n\n6 grams kosher salt \n\n\n4 grams sugar\n\n\n3 grams yeast\n\n\n178 grams water\n\n\n12 grams olive oil \n\n\n\n\nInstructions - Making the Dough\n1. Mix psyllium husk and first amount of\nwater listed (300g), stir vigorously until a gel is formed, 30 to 45 seconds\n2. In a stand mixer bowl or other large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients\n3. Pour in the warm water, psyllium gel, and olive oil, mix to combine\n4. Blend on medium speed for 2 minutes or stir very well with a sturdy spoon\n5. Put the dough into an oiled bowl and roll it around to coat with oil\n6. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then a kitchen towel, let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size\n7. Divide dough into 3 or 4 equal portions, shape into balls, flatten slightly, place on a tray sprayed with spray oil, and let rest covered with a damp towel for 30 minutes, or refrigerate until ready to make pizza\n8. If refrigerating place on oiled tray, spray tops of dough balls, cover with plastic wrap. Remove from fridge one hour before baking pizza. \n\nInstructions - Forming & Baking the Pizza\n1. Preheat the oven for at least 30 min. at 450\u00b0F with a baking stone on rack in top third of oven \n2. Place a dough ball on a piece of\nparchment paper that is no bigger than\nyour pizza stone or pan\n3. Sprinkle some GF flour (I use rice flour) on top and either pat out the dough with your hands or gently roll it out with a rolling pin into a 10-11 inch circle (small) or 13-14 inch circle (medium), pat out the dough for a thicker and softer crust edge, roll out with a rolling pin for a thin and crunchy crust edge.) When shaping push out from the center to gently push the gas bubbles towards the outer crust. Maintain a 1/2inch lip of dough around the outer edge (the interior of the crust should be as thin, flat, and gas bubble free as possible)\n4. Slide the pizza crust, along with the\nparchment paper, onto the pizza stone,\nbake for 4 minutes, removing the\nparchment paper, then bake for 6\nadditional minutes (10 total)\n5. Remove the pizza crust from the oven and place on a rack, bake the other crusts\n6. Once all the crusts are pre-baked raise the oven to 550\u00b0F, if using a steel once the oven reaches temperature turn the broiler on high for 5 minutes to super heat the steel, turn off the broiler and heat oven back to 550\u00b0F\n7. Top the pre-baked crust, brush the outer crust very lightly with extra virgin olive oil, and slide onto the steel/stone, bake for 6 minutes. remove to a cooling rack for 2 minutes before slicing\n8. Allow oven to come back to temperature in between each pizza, if using a steel turn the broiler on high for 3 minutes in between each pizza, then heat the oven back to 550\u00b0F\n\nI don\u2019t personally follow the last step.

I've been eating it safely for years and years now.[http://www.gianthippo.org/2016/06/23/ingredient-spotlight-squid-brand-fish-sauce/#:\\~:text=It%20doesn't%20have%20any,%2C%20and%20sesame%2Dfree](http://www.gianthippo.org/2016/06/23/ingredient-spotlight-squid-brand-fish-sauce/#:~:text=It%20doesn't%20have%20any,%2C%20and%20sesame%2Dfree)).\n\nThe \\*only\\* thing I can't replicate is Canto noodles.  They never come out right.\n\nIf you want GF chinese take out... everything from eggrolls (American style) to Spring Rolls (Viet and Thai style), to General Tsao's to Orange Chicken, to Bao, scallion pancake, and GF dumplings, just ask me.\n\nEDIT:  I SEE YOU, I HEAR YOU.  IT WILL TAKE TIME TO WRITE UP ALL THESE RECIPES BUT I WILL DO SO.   KEEP THE QUESTIONS COMING.  \n\n\nEDIT 2:  So, I'm going make videos for these recipes as trying to type out the techniques is just... almost impossible.    I will likely make a Pateron, because in order to produce these videos I will need to buy food I would not ordinarily have bought in such a small time frame and start giving food away to the neighbours so it doesn't go to waste, lol...  and I live in Canada, where food prices right now are high and climbing.

{"title": "Frustrated with people confusing GF with vegan", "selftext": "My bf's brother's girlfriend works at a Cinnaholic and brought some chocolate chip cookies over as for everyone to enjoy. I've mentioned before that I have celiac and that I'm not able to eat from there. I mentioned it again this time and she said that I could because everything in the store is GF except for the cinnamon rolls. I felt doubtful but took a bite as I was looking up the ingredients. It tasted like a traditional flour based cookie (I've been GF for long enough to tell the difference) and it tasted immaculate aside from my anxiety of finding out that it's actually not GF. The website has VEGAN all over it which is easily confused and used hand-in-hand with GF which I believe she was also confused about. It angers me that she works there and doesn't care enough to truly know the difference and then tell me that it's safe for me to eat. We aren't close at all so I didn't want to make a fuss to her about how wrong she was. \n\nI'm not trying to blame her but it's not the first time that I would ask close acquaintances of GF options and then they answer back about vegan things. I have to remind people close to me that vegan means nothing for GF because vegans can still enjoy breads and gluten-containing foods without the foods physically harming them.\n\nI know that in all actuality that this situation is 100% my fault for not being cautious enough for my own health. I guess what I really need to do is to not trust people who are not in my direct circle when it comes to food at all. They're not around me enough to truly know or care. \n\nI guess I'm really frustrated not only because I've just been glutaminated, but because I enjoyed it enough to be reminded about how unfair celiac and gluten intolerances are and that now it's just the waiting game for the wind to get knocked tf out of me.\n\nUsually tequila helps with minor contaminations, but this was a bigger bite and it was all my fault. \n\nPlease send support \ud83d\ude29", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/18dhqu0/frustrated_with_people_confusing_gf_with_vegan/", "created_utc": 1702021348.0, "score": 432, "author": "Dry-Tangerine-8132", "num_comments": 226, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/18dhqu0/frustrated_with_people_confusing_gf_with_vegan/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Disappointment as a medical student", "selftext": "So, I react violently to very small levels of gluten cross contamination. Specifically, I get neurological symptoms (gluten ataxia) and the first time my PCP saw me acutely reacting, she thought I was having a stroke and sent me to the ED. Nope, no ischemic brain regions, just fruit cut with a bread knife.   \n\nI can\u2019t really get tested for Celiac as I\u2019m 1. already gluten free and 2. in medical school, where despite learning about medical conditions, admin isn\u2019t super down to let me take a 6-week \u201cgluten vacation\u201d to test for one in me. Instead, I got the genetic test for HLA-DQ8 and 2.5 and tested negative, and celiac was \u201cruled out\u201d (though I am suspicious of this as there are a lot susceptibility genes we don\u2019t test for, but I digress). \n\nTime passes, I make peace with the fact I shall not receive medical care for an incredibly debilitating condition despite being a medical student in one of the hospitals best for Celiac in the country. \n\nFlash forward to yesterday, we are being taught about Celiac by one of the utmost experts in the field. I come up to him after lecture to ask some questions broadly about the disease and specifically about gluten ataxia. He smells that I know too much about this for someone who has seen only one lecture, so asks me how I know so much about Celiac. I tell him I have non-Celiac gluten sensitivity. \n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t buy it. \n\nAccording to him I do not react to gluten but rather fructan or whatever (which I in reality eat all of the time with no problem!) It was a truly insane interaction. My brother in christ, do you think I have not put thought into the thing that has dramatically shifted my life. I know for a fact it\u2019s gluten, as I know many of you know it is despite doctors not believing you. \n\nAnd you know the worst part? He was so nice about it. As he told me to my face that gluten doesn\u2019t cause severe symptoms in people without Celiac and almost never causes ataxia. Despite peer-reviewed research saying otherwise that I know he has read! He even told me I wouldn\u2019t pass a double blind test demonstrating I react to gluten. Ridiculous.\n\nI was a blubbering mess in class the rest of the day cause I was so upset. If I, a medical student with access to pay-wall papers and a lot of background knowledge on anatomy and physiology, can\u2019t get a doctor to listen to me, how the hell can anybody else do it. I\u2019m okay now, I avoid gluten and am healthy, despite the annoyances, but what about all of the people who have weird nonspecific symptoms that never get treatment because they either a. have already cut out gluten and can\u2019t be tested or b. don\u2019t test positive for Celiac but still get sick from gluten.\n\nI drafted up an email to send to him with research on non-celiac gluten sensitivity and gluten ataxia, along with an offer to participate in his double-blind gluten exposure test. But I haven\u2019t sent it yet because I am honestly so tired of fighting doctors who refuse to look beyond that which they expect to be true. I\u2019m trying to find the courage to send it anyways because he sees so many Celiac patients and him opening his mind a little could help a lot of people and change the perspectives of others in the field. Plus he really, really does seem to care about patients, and I\u2019m sure is a wonderful doctor to those who have an endoscopy  positive diagnosis. \n\nBut for the rest of us? A pat on the back, advice to avoid fructan, and a professionalism flag from your medical school for being insubordinate.

{"title": "This is a vent because I need it! Sometimes restaurant prices feel like we're being punished for having celiac...", "selftext": "My favorite restaurant in town has slowly been paring down their menu and raising their prices. I love their burgers *so much* but they started at $14 and are now $17. That\u2019s still a tolerable price in my opinion...but then they add $4 for the gluten free bun. I've paid the $21 the last few times anyway though, because they're so good and have never made me sick (so they obviously are careful to avoid cross contamination). Their house fries are a fancy cut truffle fry, which are floured. The only other side they serve is a salad (just plain bagged arugula mix with vinaigrette). \n\nAnywho, I went there Saturday night and ordered my burger, substitute salad, as usual. My bill came and it was $26 for my meal. Subbing a small bowl of salad mix now costs $5 extra dollars. So after tax and 20% tip I paid just shy of THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS for a single patty burger and a plain salad. It really feels like we're being taken advantage of for having dietary restrictions sometimes. And before you come at me (owning a restaurant is hard and expensive etc etc) - I know! I worked in food service for many years, and managed a bar. I don't mind paying a bit more for the gf bun. This restaurant has a very small kitchen, with no dedicated space for gluten free, so there's no added overhead for them there. It's simply the wholesale cost of the bun that costs them a bit more. So, I just don't see how getting a salad instead of fries should be a big up charge. It absolutely does not cost them $5 (honestly probably costs them less than the truffle fries) and it's the only other option they offer so I'm forced into it. If fries come with the burger, why can't a salad?\n\nI just can't yall. Thanks for letting me vent. This is why I stay home.

{"title": "The story about how I got glutened at a hospital", "selftext": "Here is the story about how I got glutened at the hospital - nearly twice!!\n\nSome years ago, I unexpectedly ended up at the hospital. Thankfully, they had gluten free options, which were available if you can get the nurse to tell the kitchen to allow you to eat them. I had the nurse do that, and now I could enjoy the limited (but safe) options they offered.\n\nOne dish they offered GF was an alfredo pasta. I had it the day before and liked it, so I decided to have it again this day. I called the kitchen to place my order, and this is how my conversation went:\n\nMe: I would like to order the GF alfredo pasta, please.\n\nKitchen: I'm sorry, you're not allowed to order GF.\n\nMe: What do you mean I'm not allowed to order GF?\n\nKitchen: If you need to eat GF food, you need to tell your nurse and they will tell us to let you order GF. We only have a limited number of GF meals and they are more expensive than the regular meals, so we don't allow just anyone to order GF.\n\nMe: But I did that yesterday and was allowed to order GF.\n\nKitchen: Oh, oops. The system tends to kick everyone off of the GF list every couple of days. You need to tell your nurse to put you back on the list. In the meantime...there that should work! You'll get your GF alfredo pasta for this meal.\n\nMe: Thank you so much! You are awesome!!!\n\nWhen the food came, it looked a little different. There was a garnish of breadcrumbs on top that wasn't there on the one I received yesterday. Plus, the pasta shape looked a little more narrow. \n\nOn the paper that they always sent with every meal listing your name, room number, and food contents, it just said \"alfredo pasta\" but handwritten before it was the words \"gluten free\".\n\nI reasoned with myself that maybe they used a different GF frozen alfredo pasta meal. After all, it did say GF on the paper (though it was hand written instead of printed). And,, the lady said that I would get GF - this was a hospital where they are supposed to be super careful. Plus, I was really hungry and didn't want to wait for the nurse to come so I could ask her about it. \n\nSo, I ate it.\n\nAnd it was NOT gluten free.\n\nI scolded myself for my foolishness and told myself to be more careful in the future. I also had the nurse switch me back to the gluten free list in the kitchen.\n\nAbout three days later, I finally mostly recovered from the gluten incident. I went to order my dinner from the kitchen. Here's how the conversation went:\n\nMe: I would like to order the GF alfredo pasta, please.\n\nKitchen: Absolutely! It'll be there for dinner.\n\nWhen the food came, I didn't look at it right away because I was napping. They had this system of warm plates and covers for the plates that would keep the food warm for 100 minutes. I wasn't too worried because I knew it would still be warm when I got to it.\n\nI went to the meal and looked at the piece of paper. On it was printed \"gluten free alfredo pasta\". Perfect! I went to take the cover off of the plate and there it was again: the breadcrumbs, the more narrow pasta shape. This was not gluten free!!!\n\nI paged the nurse who only said \"Sorry, but the kitchen is closed now\". I was not offered any alternative food. So, I did not eat dinner that night. :(\n\nI do not blame the kitchen staff for the mix ups. They were probably understaffed and working with a terrible system trying to get everyone fed on a timely manner.\n\nHowever, the moral of the story is to always be careful! Mistakes can be made anywhere...even in a hospital setting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/17if8i6/the_story_about_how_i_got_glutened_at_a_hospital/", "created_utc": 1698504250.0, "score": 364, "author": "vanilla-bean1", "num_comments": 148, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/17if8i6/the_story_about_how_i_got_glutened_at_a_hospital/", "html_title": ""}

I wanted to replenish a bread product of any kind and Schneiders GF pretzels on my trip. Not necessary but I had wanted to replace what was gone. I stopped at three grocery stores in three different areas as our trip took up exploring from San Francisco all the way down to Laguna Niguel. I was baffled at what a gluten free desert California was. In Wisconsin I am absolutely spoiled. Woodman\u2019s is no comparison for anywhere I\u2019ve ever traveled. I thought I would have no problem finding good options outside of a Trader Joe\u2019s for two basic items. Back home and here is a look at just the gluten free isle itself. There is a myriad of choices for frozen pizzas and frozen breads/desserts/baked goods as well. This does not include the other various items around the store that are also GF but not in the dedicated isles. My children are basically grown and the idea of moving has crossed our minds. The availability of food at my fingertips at reasonable prices makes it a very hard thought to consider.

All 3 of the egg bite options are gluten free, but you will want to ask for new tongs as we use the same ones all day for everything.\n\nNext beverages, the options are much more plentiful than the food fortunately. There are only 3 ingredients you need to watch out for 1. the chocolate malt powder (found in the Chocolate Almond Milk Shaken Espresso & the Chocolate Cream Cold Brew) 2. the Frappuccino chips (found in the Java Chip, Double Chocolatey Chip, Mocha Cookie Crumble, Chocolate Cookie Crumble, Java Mint, and Chocolate Mint Frappuccinos) 3. the cookie crumble topping (again the mocha cookie & chocolate cookie frapps), and 4. the mint cookie topping (Java or chocolate mint frapps). Everything else is safe for us! \n\nThe main take away for beverages is that if your drink is shaken (shaken espresso, iced tea, refresher), blended (Frappuccino), or has cold foam on it (cold brews) you have to ask for a new blender/shaker since the malt powder is in a shaken espresso and the chocolate cold brew and the Frapp chips will be in the blenders. \n\nOne last thing I\u2019d like to add is the new White Chocolate Macadamia Cream Cold Brew does come with a Toasted Cookie Topping which does sound scary, but fortunately it is made of rice flour and is actually gluten free so you can order that one as is!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/14i6gmo/gluten_free_guide_to_starbucks_in_the_us/", "created_utc": 1687648290.0, "score": 350, "author": "Temporary-Spread-776", "num_comments": 90, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/14i6gmo/gluten_free_guide_to_starbucks_in_the_us/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

Salad with a dressing and the pudding was a cream thing with fruit and shaved chocolate, honestly absolutely amazing! \nBreakfast was scrambled egg, a tomato base sauce and with the gluten free bread and butter wasn't actually that bad. A little fruit platter as well. \n\nAir New Zealand however was a disaster, the food was lukewarm but edible. \nThat consisted of chicken with the skin on, tomato base with green beans,courgette and tomato. A side salad of either pumpkin or squash with chickpeas. Coconut crumbly cake which was pretty dry with a jam on the bottom. The scone was actually OK with the butter on it and I didn't touch the bread as you could hammer a nail in with it. The cheese was not the best either. \n\nThe breakfast consisted of lukewarm \"scrambled egg\", soggy, slimey mushrooms, butternut squash, and what I assume was a round chicken ball thing? \nThe fruit and yogurt were nice but again, served with cake, at breakfast, this time a chocolately cake with a jam on the bottom. I ate it but it wasn't great. \n\nTbf the whole Air New Zealand experience wasn't great, old plane, rattling windows, arm rests that you couldn't move to get comfy and rubbish food. The service was OK, the staff did their bests but it was nothing on the Lufthansa experience. \n\nLufthansa handed out free chocolate and bottles of water even on their short haul flight from Manchester to Munich. \nOn the long haul you got Lindt chocolate and hot hand towel/ face wipe.

But yesterday I made my kids some waffles and decided to have one with them. I felt very tired pretty much right away after eating.

I thought it was normal to get bloated after a meal though so have never thought too much about it. I do also have dairy / milk products everyday and have for years.\n\nI have been trying a gluten free diet for 2 days so far to see if there is a change - so far I think I have been less bloated but the my poo has remained a lighter pale yellow.

{"title": "Hungy Root", "selftext": "Hey guys, I wanted to share my experience with HungryRoot in case anybody else has been eying them. It's a meal service similar to Hello Fresh but different in ways that make it much better for me personally. This is not an ad, I'm not being paid to promote them, I just wanted to share. \n\nMort importantly: they support dietary needs really well IMO. I can't speak to if they're celiac or allergen safe although the way they label their products I would think maybe? Somebody with more experience will have to tell me their opinion, I'm not sensitive to cross contamination so I don't know. You fill out a pretty extensive list of food and diet preferences when you sign up (which you can access any time to update), they can honor gluten free, dairy free, vegan, vegetarian, low sodium, keto, etc. They have substitutes for almost all items in their kits to support this, and while you're selecting recipes/meals they are set up with your ingredient preferences. I always double check of course but when you go to search through ingredients and meals it will alert you and say \"contains gluten.\" They carry brands like Canyon Bakehouse and Jovial and Kite Hill along with their own brand that they make gluten free. \n\nWe've been ordering from them weekly since January. It's $130 per box weekly for 8-10 meals (lunch/dinner) plus various snacks, drinks, and breakfast items depending on what you choose. Is that cheap? Not really, it comes out to $12 a plate plus a few snacks. Is it cheaper than eating out? Yes, and I loathe cooking so this Is saving my family money by not eating out every day. Also significantly healthier IMO. I also realize I'm paying for convenience, delivery, and pre-portioned food so I know that factors Into the price. \n\nOne thing that makes me feel mildly better about the price, sometimes you will get \"overflow.\" Ex- they will send an entire packet of gf tortillas or an entire box of pasta when the meal is technically only for a serving of 2. Their sauces also have usually 4-6 servings so I can stretch those types of meals further than just 2 portions. Knowing this, I can add an extra protein and/or vegetable with some of your leftover points for the week to get extra servings.\n\nThis works on a point system so my $130 gets me 54 points every week, each meal Is roughly 8-15 points depending on the ingredients, and the snacks are anywhere from 1/2 a point to 4-5. Each meal usually has 3-5 (almost always 4) ingredients and steps. This Is huge for me personally, I can select to have no raw meat so it's less cooking for me, everything comes together quickly and actually tastes good. My husband eats most of the meals I get too. These are significantly easier to put together than other meal plans I've tried, you can follow the directions on the recipe cards or you can go rogue like I do (sometimes I don't want to roast the veggies but they often comes In steamer bags so I can pop them In the microwave for 3 min to steam and be done with It). You select your meals one week before they ship so you do have to kind of keep up with it. The website selects meals for you but you can alter Ingredients or delete the selection altogether and browse to pick your own. You can also skip the week on the site, it's very easy to do. \n\nOne thing I love is that the deliver snacks and gf products along with meals, so some weeks I get veggies packs and gf muffins or overnight oats and smoothies, gf cookie dough, etc. they also add in produce so some weeks I get a bag of apples or grapefruits, etc. This is included in the plan I picked and the price I mentioned above. One other thing I realllllly love is that I can substitute out ingredients In the app while I'm planning. Ex- I don't eat spinach so I find a recipe that has spinach as a side, I can either \"substitute\" and if the app doesn't find a substitution of equal value, I can just remove the ingredient from that meal and then browse through grocery section to select a side I prefer. When you remove the ingredient It takes the points out of that meal, so if the meal was 9 points and the spinach was worth 2, the cart changes to only 7 points until I browse groceries and add back in the side I want. \n\nI have had issues with deliveries, it's not perfect. They have always refunded when my food doesn't show up, I realize It's a carrier Issues and not the company Itself but it's still their responsibility. I do think part of that Is my location, almost the mountains, because food always comes for me really late almost 8PM most days so I think I'm the last delivery for the truck and sometimes they can't make it to my house. \n\nIf you have any questions I'm happy to answer them. I think I can get a 50% off your first box code If you're interested, no pressure at all I just wanted to share because It has helped me a lot.

I have IBS-M, and one of the treatments to find triggers was an elimination diet, since both my endoscopy and colonoscopy only showed irritation.\n\nLast week, my roommate and her boyfriend invited my partner and I over to his place for dinner. They wanted to cook stir fry for us! They emphasized that it would of course be made gluten free, and I offered them the GF soy sauce in my fridge for them to use. They forgot it and went to cook at his place. My partner texted my roommate to ask if they wanted us to bring the bottle, and they said no because they bought some themselves.\n\nWhen we arrived, they brought up that they 1) forgot the soy sauce I offered, 2) forgot they needed to change the ingredients and accidentally started cooking with normal soy sauce and had to save that for themselves, and 3) said they rinsed the dishes they were cooking in and had to restart with gluten free. I may have misheard or misunderstood them, because my partner heard that they rinsed the \\*food\\* and not just the dishes.\n\nThe food was good. I asked if they could taste any difference in the soy sauce used, and they said no. I had no issues for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next morning, I was experiencing the WORST abdominal pain I have had in YEARS! I was using the bathroom, and I was getting intense muscle cramps/aches from my rectum to my ribs. It was tender to the touch on the outside. For a moment, I was convinced my appendix was bursting because of the rapid onset of intensity. This experience consisted of me writhing around in pain unable to defecate due to the sharpness that would result when my rectal muscles were at all contracted. I was so miserable, and I downed an antispasmodic and ibuprofen once I left the bathroom.\n\nInitially, I didn't blame the food for my symptoms, but I historically take 8-10 hours for my gluten intolerance to show itself.

I mentioned I was given a recipe that called for almond flour (and had a really good texture), but I can't eat almonds, and the other flour substitute I used created a crumbly mess.  Then I asked what kind of flour her daughter made.\n\nShe said her daughter bought her own mill because she hated being limited when eating gluten-free. Grinding her own wheat seeds allowed her to ensure the flour was more pure and safe to eat.  Confused, I clarified that I was avoiding wheat because I didn't want the gluten it contained to cause further damage to my intestinal lining.\n\nShe nodded and explained that consuming wheat in a more *pure* form, helps eliminate stomach distress, and *heals the intestine*.  I mentioned that sometimes people think gluten is the culprit, when the trigger food is actually something else.  She just told me I should consider milling my own wheat flour. \n\nI was surprised, as I had never heard anything like this before.  Is this something people encourage?

I found the linked article that delves into common comorbid conditions with NCGS: Autoimmune conditions, neuropsychiatric disorders, headaches, fibromyalgia, low back pain, reproductive issues, and skin issues. \n\nI can check nearly every box: Grave\u2019s disease, depression/anxiety (never medicated but in therapy multiple times), non-migraine headaches, body aches and neuropathies (never diagnosed as fibromyalgia), disabling SI-joint back pain, infertility/fibroids/endometriosis, eczema/rosacea. \n\nAnyone else? Just looking for validation and curious about other experiences. \n\nIf you have NCGS, do you have one or multiple of the comorbidities? How much did your health change when you became GF? How do you handle social eating? How strict are you in GF/cross-contamination? Do you \u201ccheat\u201d? What is your symptom pattern when you do ingest gluten?\n\nThank you!", "url": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8514220/", "created_utc": 1745083562.0, "score": 3, "author": "dinobaglady", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1k31i1s/ncgs_atypical_symptoms_and_comorbidities/", "html_title": "403"}

{"title": "How to heal completely?", "selftext": "Hi guys! I am quite sure that I have NCGS although I am self diagnosed. My history:\n\nI am 32M. In childhood, when I was around 3 or 4, I used to cry a lot complaining of headaches. My parents consulted a lot of doctors but nobody could explain the reason behind the headaches. As I got older that subsided, and I was generally healthy during my teenage years except that I had allergies - allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis which used to flare up during particular seasons. But this wasn\u2019t too severe and I could manage it without any medication. Then when I was about 18 or 19, I suddenly started suffering from sharp pains in my lower abdomen (on the left side) for which I also saw a lot of doctors l, underwent scans, which couldn\u2019t come up with anything at all. That also subsided after a while. The next part is about sinus related issues. Not long after the abdominal issue, I suddenly wake up one day with tremendous sinus pressure and a total lack of balance, dizziness, etc. A doctor mentioned that I have severe allergies along with a deviated nasal septum which is causing all this and he asked me to avoid particular foods in order to not worsen it later on. This issue kind of remained with me but again I was able to manage it without any medications. It also became less severe as I got older. During my college years, I was generally fine. Sporty, doing all the things that a regular college goer does - smoking, drinking, junk food, etc. Everything was fine until when I was about 23, I wake up one night with a severe asthma attack (first time in my life). Doctors said it was severe allergies. The asthma continued for quite a while and then suddenly came about a host of other symptoms. Debilitating migraines, GERD, allergies worsening, and eventually severe health anxiety. I was hospitalised where they diagnosed me as a hypochondriac because they could not find anything specific. On the migraines and other things they just said that it is normal to have those things but not normal to overthink about them which I was doing. Hence, the psychological diagnosis of hypochondriasis. Soon after I suffered from depression. For no reason at all. And I could absolutely feel within myself that it wasn\u2019t my mental state that was triggering it, but rather a sudden hormonal change that would make me feel intensely sad for no reason. Doctors, therapists forcibly tried to attribute causes to it making the entire thing psychological. They would say all my physical symptoms (as described above), were all because of my psychological issues. But I couldn\u2019t explain to them that it was the other way around-that because my physical health deteriorated I wasn\u2019t feeling good mentally. My parents were very supportive and took me to a lot of doctors but all of them went in the psychological direction. At one point, I just accepted it for what it is and convinced myself that I have to live with it. I kept having gastrointestinal issues, allergies, asthma, depression, anxiety, and all of this reduced my performance in sports, academics , affected my social life. But since I got used to it it was easier to manage. I would also say that the symptoms got better over time as I started living a healthier life compared to college days. But nevertheless I never felt like before. Specifically not like how I was before my first asthma attack. Among the most prominent symptoms that I had at this point was inflammation. I would feel inflamed all over my body for no particular reason. I also at this point saw that my symptoms graduating to things which my mother had. So, that was a bit consoling as I could blame it on genetics. But there was still this lingering skepticism in me which kept me thinking that there is some cause to all of this which nobody was able to identify. I constantly kept researching and researching and ultimately came to the conclusion that it was food. Popular online forums suggested elimination diets cutting off common culprits such as dairy and gluten. I first tried cutting off dairy which made me feel better (less bloated), but didn\u2019t affect my other chronic symptoms. And then I cut gluten off and BAMM!!!! In a week, I feel like I haven\u2019t felt like in the last 8 or 9 years. Way more energy, less bloating, easy stomach, reduction in inflammation, allergies subsiding (I can go out on long walks during spring now), brain fog gone. Things keep getting better and better as I continue avoiding gluten (for 8 months now). But there are some symptoms that still linger on. \n\n1) Stiff and painful joints in the lumbar and cervical regions (although it has become way better than before)\n\n2) Tinnitus \n\nAny idea if these are related to my gluten sensitivity? How to heal them faster? \n\nP.S: I still consume dairy, but no corn, oats. And I try to be strictly gluten free with minimal to no chance of cross contamination.

That said, they\u2019re **a lot more expensive** at high-end grocery stores. We\u2019ve seen big price jumps at places like Whole Foods or Central Market. If you\u2019re looking to save, check **Walmart**, **Target**, or even **Amazon** for better pricing.

They are soft, rich, and full of chocolatey goodness... and completely free of wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, corn, and nuts.\n\nI created this recipe for my twins (specifically my daughter), who both have multiple food allergies. After a lot of trial and error over the years, this one has become a go-to. It is easy to make and always a hit.\n\nI included step-by-step photos to make it easier to follow.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup [Unrefined Bakery Pancake and Waffle Mix](https://unrefinedbakery.com/products/pancake-waffle-mix) (Alternative: [King Arthur Gluten Free Pancake Mix](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/gluten-free-pancake-mix?srsltid=AfmBOopNnoD_KUdvF_4KLJimT-jQM-yOy8bPHmb19J-D3APxeW-SJHv1))\n* 3 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce\n* 1 tablespoon canola oil\n* 3 teaspoons cocoa powder\n* 1 cup [Ripple Unsweetened Plant-Based Milk](https://ripplefoods.com/products/ripple-refrigerated-chocolate-milk?variant=48628125860135) (We sometimes use the chocolate version for extra flavor)\n* 1/4 cup [Enjoy Life Mini Chocolate Chips](https://enjoylifefoods.com/products/semi-sweet-chocolate-mini-chips-1) (add last)\n   * The mini is important because you get more coverage in the pancake\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Mix the pancake mix and cocoa powder in a bowl\n2. Add Ripple plant-based milk, applesauce, and oil and stir until smooth\n3. Mix in the mini chocolate chips. If the batter feels too thick, add a splash more milk\n4. Heat a skillet on medium and lightly grease with canola oil\n5. Drop about 1/4 cup of batter per pancake\n6. Cook until bubbles form, flip, and cook another 1 to 2 minutes\n7. Serve warm with 100% pure maple syrup (note: other syrups don't pair well with this recipe... only 100% pure maple syrup!)\n\nNote: None of these links are affiliate links.

My 12 year old daughter has multiple food allergies including wheat, eggs, dairy, and corn. Until recently, she had never been able to eat chicken tenders.\n\nWe came up with a version that works for her and it has become our Friday night tradition.\n\nThe first time she tried them, she grabbed the Simply Heinz ketchup from the fridge and said,\n\n\u201cEveryone eats tenders with ketchup.\u201d\n\nThat moment meant everything to us.\n\nThese are crispy, easy to make, and safe for families managing a lot of allergies. Here is the recipe in case it helps someone else.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup all purpose gluten free baking blend *(We use Unrefined Bakery\u2019s blend)... only in Dallas area, but they do ship in the U.S.*\n* 2 teaspoons black pepper\n* 2 teaspoons salt\n* 2 tablespoons paprika\n* 2 tablespoons onion powder\n* 1/4 cup water\n* Canola oil for frying\n* Chicken tenders\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Mix the flour, pepper, salt, paprika, and onion powder in a bowl\n2. In a separate bowl, mix 1/4 cup of the dry mixture with 1/4 cup water to make a thick paste\n3. Dip chicken tenders in the paste, then coat in the dry mix\n4. Heat oil in a skillet to 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit\n5. Fry tenders for 8 minutes\n6. Drain on paper towels and check that the internal temp is at least 165 degrees\n\n**Tip:** If you're frying in multiple batches, make sure the oil heats back up to 350 to 375 degrees before starting the next round. If the oil is too cool, the tenders will turn out soggy instead of crispy.\n\nThese have been a game changer for us and I hope they help someone else looking for a safe and tasty option for their family. Let me know if you try them or if you have a favorite allergy friendly dish to share.\n\nIf you are looking for more recipes like this one, I put together a cookbook with all of our favorites from the past 12 years.

{"title": "What are my chances of having celiac vs ncgs?", "selftext": "Hi for the past few months I've been experiencing a wide array of symptoms ranging from brain fog, some nausea, alot of burping / belching, some acide reflux, mixed stool, high levels of anxiety that somehow tapered off, lately insomnia, muscle aches, lately quite a bit of abdominal pain etc etc. I know that celiac disease can present itself with a wide array of symptpms. I did go gluten free for the past two days and felt alot better on the 2nd day. The brain fog lifted and I had alot more energy. The abdominal pain was odd since it would usually happen the next day in the mornings and it would dissipate usually by the afternoons.. However, I know that I have atleast a gluten intolerance but I'm really hoping that I have NCGS since its not autoimmune. Having something autoimmune increases your chances of developing other autoimmune conditions which I'm a bit fearful of. Here's the catcher is that my dad was diagnosed with celiac disease in his 40s so I know that puts  me a higher risk bracket of having it. However I'm curious to know what would be my chances of having NCGS ? I'm a 33M if that even matters.  I am planning to go back on a gluten diet tomorrow until I have my appointment this week as I know that can impact the blood test.  Appreciate any words of reasoning!

{"title": "Extreme low mood since going gluten free.", "selftext": "Anyone else experienced this? \nI started eating majority gluten free about 2 years ago when our youngest child was diagnosed with celiac disease. At first it was a solidarity move, as she was only 5 at the time, but my husband and I noticed we felt so much better since going gf. Also, her GI physician explained that 40% of Caucasian people carry the genes to potentially develop Celiac disease, and after doing some family history, we were curious.\n\nFast forward to now, my husband has remained strictly gf, but I have wavered due to high food cost, it's easier, etc. \nI recently made the decision to completely go back to gf due to digestive issues. Physically I've noticed a great improvement, just as before, but mentally my low mood has made my life miserable. \n\nI have a history of chronic anxiety and depression (which I have aggressively fought for many years with SSRIs, vitamins, exercise, etc) and was relatively stable. \nSince going gf 3-4 weeks ago, my mood has plummeted. I'm full of rage, I have zero patience, I don't want to do anything I normally find joy in and I feel like I'm one 'straw' away from cracking. I don't mean this to sound dramatic, but it's a 360 degree veer from where I was and the only change was going gluten free. I'm almost to the point where I'm about to say to heck with this and start eating gluten again. I'm not diagnosed with NCGS or Celiac, however I do suspect I have NCGS at the least. I'm scheduled for labs next month. \n\n*A side note, my daughter's initial symptoms that made me realize something was wrong were neurological.

{"title": "Eating Gluten Abroad", "selftext": "Hi all! \n\nI am studying abroad in Germany in the fall. My question is how do I know if I am one of those people who can eat non-american foods containing gluten without side effects? I know if you have celiac, it doesn't matter, but you \\*may\\* be able to if you have a gluten intolerance or wheat allergy. \n\nHere is where it gets complicated. I was experiencing symptoms at 11 years old (I am 24 now) and my doctor back then recommended I cut out gluten for a few weeks, I did and felt a decent amount better. He never tested me for celiac, and just told me this means I have a sensitivity and that I could safely have gluten a couple of times a week, and I believed him!\n\nOver the next 10 years, I gradually ate less and less gluten, it would always hurt my stomach after I had it, I went from a couple meals a week to avoiding as much as possible, but still having things like soy sauce or cross contaminated foods at restaurants, because I was told that wouldn't effect me by my doctor (again, with no tests). I had lotsssss of GI problems in college, and after trying everything else I asked a new doctor if they could test me for celiac. They said no, as the results wouldn't be accurate unless I was eating a normal gluten-filled diet for months before, which of course would be very painful for me. \n\n  \nSo, I started acting like I am celiac since no one would confirm, avoiding all cross contamination, traces, etc 3 years ago. I still have occasional stomach issues but it is DRASTICALLY better. \n\nNow I am spending 6 months in Germany for grad school, and am thinking about this a lot. Of course I know the safest option is to continue to act like I am celiac to avoid any potential issues. But, it would obviously be a lot less limiting if I could not worry about cross contamination or even some gluten in my food while I am in Germany and traveling around Europe. I know the only way to really know is if I got tested. I guess I am just looking for some opinions/tips if possible!

{"title": "Is this normal", "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI have had gut issues for about 7 months which started after a bout of food poisoning. I had extreme lower abdominal pain with, severe fatigue and loose bowels plus random feelings of nervousness which felt like full body tingling, warm ears and sense of overwhelming fear. In my 40 years, I have never experienced anything like this before. \n\nI have had multiple blood and stool tests which came back fine as well as MRI/CT scans, endoscopy and colonoscopy, all of which came back fine. I had tried FODMAP, removal of lactose etc and nothing seemed to help (I am not Celiac, confirmed via blood tests and biopsy).\n\nHowever, I then tried going gluten free, almost as a last resort and have been for 8 days. The first 4/5 days I felt great. Loads of energy, great mood and amazingly, my crippling lower abdominal pain disappeared. \n\nDay 6/7/8 however, have come with what feels like a backward step and I am not sure how to feel. I have hit a wall in terms of energy, for the last 2 days, I can barely get out of bed. During the day, I randomly get 'panicked' or feel like my whole body is tingling and nervous and I need to lie down. \n\nCould anyone offer insight as to whether this might be a passing phase as my body adjusts to its new gluten free life, or whether this happened to them and if it will improve with time? \n\nThe first 5 days reminded me of what it felt like to be normal again and I was really hoping that it would continue. Now I feel I have gone backwards and would appreciate any comments from others who have gone through the same. The biggest (and remaining issues) I now face are the fatigue, and more randomly the nervousness/anxiety which seems to come out of nowhere and for no real reason. \n\n Thanks.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1jwn1b0/is_this_normal/", "created_utc": 1744369030.0, "score": 1, "author": "Open-Pea2354", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1jwn1b0/is_this_normal/", "html_title": ""}

The symptoms I've been experiencing have been so unmanageable and annoying, but it's been difficult to even make the slow switch to becoming GF on my own.\nI have a dietician appointment next month, I'm hoping they can help me out.\n\nSwitching away from gluten is very difficult for me because of my binge eating disorder. Gluten has been a heavy part of my diet since forever. Today I woke up and made the regrettable decision to have a lot of gluten for breakfast, and now I can feel how inflamed my bladder is immediately after eating it and how much I need to frequently urinate. Plus all the other symptoms I experience along with it throughout my entire body.\n\nThis has all been so frustrating for me, especially to make the switch.

{"title": "Question about symptoms to Gluten intolerance.", "selftext": "Hi everyone, hope you\u2019re all doing well.\n\nI am making this post in a desperate attempt to figure out whats wrong with me & I feel like gluten intolerance and or wheat allergy might be the culprit for all my issues. \n\nFor the past year I have been struggling with the fear that my next meal could flare up a whole new set of problems & its been affecting my life for the absolute worse.\n\nMy symptoms in order from how they began are.\n\n1. Excessive belching after eating, beyond that of a normal person. Feels nothing like a soda burp. Almost as if my stomach gets inflated with gas & I have to release it as a burp. This will happen multiple times after a meal and have lasted even 2-3 hours after a meal. \n\n2. Shortness of breath, this is absolutely the worst symptom I have and I pray everyday that this symptom would just disappear. The best way I can explain it is as if I can no longer let my body do the breathing, I have to step in & manually take deep breaths to bring ease. Feels almost as if I\u2019m hungry for air. Sometimes a deep breath through my mouth doesn\u2019t seem sufficient enough & it has become something that comes into effect maybe 1-2 hours after every meal, it can last over an hour as-well. (My oxygen levels don\u2019t drop & its not as bad as someone with asthma for example but it still feels like something that can worsen over time & I fear this.)\n\n3. Regurgitation/Acid Reflux, with the constant belching, I understand that the air trapped in your stomach can push the food back up but whats weird about this is that along with my shortness of breath, sometimes I feel like I have to forcefully regurgitate a mouth full of stomach acid and whatever I ate in order to ease my breathing & most of the time it actually fixes it. I don\u2019t know why it works that way but when my breathing gets really bad, I will force myself to regurgitate a mouth full of what looks like a milky white liquid along with pieces of what I ate & it will make me feel better. (Disgusting I know :/ )\n\n4. What feels like a lump in my throat, this may be caused by the acid reflux but then again could be an allergy? I\u2019m not sure. Sometimes feels like a dry throat but sometimes an actual lump. No pain just a minor discomfort.\n\n5. Anxiety/Depression, I have been suffering pretty bad anxiety. The shortness of breath and other symptoms can make it worse as well so when it all hits together it feels like your world is crashing down. Hyperventilation from it sometimes causes numb hands (needle feeling).\n\n6. Random headaches. This doesn\u2019t happen too often but more often than it should.\n\n\nThese are my symptoms and I have explained them as best as I can, if anyone feels anything similar, I would love to hear your insight. \n\nI would like to add that before today, white bread & pretty much all breads have been a regular part of my diet. (Literally everyday, chicken sandwiches, steak sandwiches ect.) I don\u2019t cook at home & mostly depend on uber eats/eating out. I have officially began a gluten free diet today in hopes that this might be my problem all along. I\u2019m 29 M and have had these symptoms on and off for about 5 years but this year it\u2019s gotten really bad to the point that I can\u2019t keep living like this & must figure it out and make changes. \n\nI have also gone to the doctor & they pointed at Anxiety/GERD with barely any testing. Seemed almost lazy. It was probably my fault since I didn\u2019t express much concern and seemed perfectly normal at the visit. \n\nAny insight would be INSANELY appreciated.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1jvcwcn/question_about_symptoms_to_gluten_intolerance/", "created_utc": 1744223048.0, "score": 2, "author": "NotVngel", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1jvcwcn/question_about_symptoms_to_gluten_intolerance/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

It started when I would frequently get sick with no explanation from eating food. I tried many things to figure out what it was and saw many doctors and gastroenterologists. I thought it was lactose at first, but I found myself getting sick even when I had no dairy. I was tested for Celiac disease, but I tested negative. Another doctor suggested I might be gluten intolerant, so I stopped eating gluten and stopped having problems.\n\nToday, however, I went to a restaurant with gluten-free options, and for some reason unknown to me, I forgot to order gluten-free bread. I didn't realize until I was halfway through the sandwich, and I still am not sick from it. I've been alright with some sourdough in the past (though occasionally I get sick if I eat too much). This bread, however, was without a doubt whole grain. Now, I am questioning everything.\n\nHas anyone with gluten intolerance found certain foods okay? Or perhaps have I been wrongly diagnosed? Has anyone had the intolerance fade? One doctor told me she thought I developed it due to long COVID, which I had two years ago.

I had my gallbladder removed although I wasn\u2019t sold that was the issue, but I still went through with it and things have gotten worse since then. I\u2019ve gone dairy free in the past and there wasn\u2019t a drastic change. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago where I met with a nutritionist to further my quest of finding out what is wrong with me. She suggested I try going gluten-free for breakfast into monitor how I felt. I decided to go all in just to speed up the process and find an answer. The first week I was gluten-free I felt significantly better, I still felt a little off, but the stomach pains were gone. The second week was a lot more rough and the stomach pains were back, but not as frequent. Now it just completed my third week of gluten-free and I\u2019m still not sure if I feel better. This last week has brought extreme bloating, which I thought had gone down significantly in the first week. The bloating is extremely uncomfortable and frustrating. I know these things take time but with me feeling so much better the first week and now kind of just reverting back to old symptoms. I am wondering if I truly do have non-celiac gluten sensitivity. I\u2019ve still been monitoring all of my symptoms after certain meals so I can pass it along to the nutritionist the next time we meet, but in the meantime, I wanted to check in with others and see if this timeline seems normal to you guys?

{"title": "Extreme Fatigue but no stomach issues", "selftext": "I have a history of Celiac in my family (my grandmother and sister both have it). Since my teens (in early 40s now) I have always had stomach issues and bloating specifically after meals. After my sister was diagnosed with Celiac she convinced me to get tested. The test did not come back positive for celiac but showed some suggestion that I may have an intolerance to gluten. \n\nI decided to go gluten free. I felt my bloating and stomach issues go down significantly. I followed this diet for about a year. Then one day I accidentally ate gluten and panicked thinking that because of my new diet that the effects would be terrible. To my surprise there was no effect. I slowly started to introduce gluten back into my diet and no side effects. It felt as if my body reset and I longer had the issues i had prior. This has been the case for the past 4 years. \n\nBut recently (the last year) I have had fairly extreme fatigue. I thought perhaps my thyroid so I got blood work and everything looked fine. I thought maybe lifestyle so I focused on more exercise and cut out drinking. But still fatigued. And I get enough sleep. \n\nMy wife suggested gluten but I said I haven\u2019t had any stomach issues related so I didn\u2019t think much of it. But now after doing some research it appears fatigue is a standard side effect of gluten. \n\nMy question is, is it possible that I am gluten intolerant and the fatigue is a side effect even though I no longer have the stomach issues I once had? \n\nI am going to start a GF diet this week to see if it has an effect on me.

Also, was having vestibular migraine issues (got diagnosed at this time). Was diagnosed with IBS but no further exams or anything were done. No tests nothing. Around early 2019 I traveled to a country that had lots of glutinous food and I ate a ton. I had some cramping and tons of gas. Like ten seconds couldn\u2019t pass without passing the largest stinkiest gas. It was constant for days. I think I had joint pain and then a weird rash on my arm. Looked up the rash thing and thought gluten. Doctor sent blood test with other things. Darn lab didn\u2019t run the gluten blood tests and I didn\u2019t find out until a few weeks after I went gluten free. Symptoms were much less, so went mostly gluten free with some cheating here or there with severe gas for a day or two after.  \n\nFlash forward, 2020 I got really consitpated. Stuck with GF. By 2023, I switched to loose stools. I slowly became more strict about gluten (and dairy). Stomach issues settled but loose stools never stopped. \n\nFinally got a gastroenterologist referral. Of course the blood tests came back negative cause I\u2019ve been gluten free for many years and the last year I\u2019ve been diligent. He did genetic testing and I have a high risk for celiac. I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy scheduled in 8 weeks. He said to eat bread every day. I had my first slice of banana nut bread last night. \n\nOf course I woke up with a chest cold (little toddler in daycare). But I am totally debilitated. My migraine is off the charts bad. Like I haven\u2019t had it this bad in so many years if ever. I am very nauseous when I stand up and dizzy. I can\u2019t get out of bed. My body is crazy achy, but I\u2019m also sick.

I would bleed when I pooped, at least a week or two a month, I was always so bloated, miserable. A friend suggested that I try out a gluten free diet, and my problems started showing up less and less. For the first time in years, I was pooping regularly, I was losing weight (I started at 260 and got down to 220)... things were going well. Since starting that diet, now when I eat gluten, my problems are every single time. If i eat any gluten, I don't have any immediate symptoms other than bloating, and then exactly 3 days later, it feels like I am pooping glass, and there is a large dripping amount of bright red blood. I tried going to the urgent care because I was in so much pain down there, and they referred me to a GI doctor, I went 3 weeks later and they said I had celiac symptoms, but gave me the blood test and it was negative, although I did have severe vitamin deficiencies... I found out later that I should have had gluten before the test, as I had not eaten any since 3 weeks before. I am having a bad flair up currently, and have had severe, painful, bleeding hemorrhoids for over a week now. Usually they would only hurt when I was actively using the restroom, but the pain has been constant for over a week. Sitting, standing, walking... doesnt matter. I even had a colonoscopy in January, and while there were pre-cancerous polyps, the doctor just told me \"If it hurts when you eat gluten, don't eat it.\" I told them I was just in severe pain and feeling alone, because I hadn't talked to anyone else with these symtoms, and they scoffed at me and said they'd seen it before tons of times. Even when I went to him last week for the severe pain, he told me the same thing, gave me a hydrocortisone cream, and said he didn't need to look and see what was going on, because he saw in January... but I wasn't hurting in January, so he didn't actually see what was going on. I also have had orange-ish chunks in my stool, that google said could be fat malabsorption. Sorry for the long post, but I just have run out of options, and I feel like there has to be more to this than \"if it hurts, don't eat it\", but maybe that really is all there is to it.

{"title": "Am I gluten intolerant? PLEASE HELP!! This is driving me crazy.", "selftext": "Hello, please help me understand if I'm suffering from food sensitivity or possibly a gluten intolerance. First off, I have never been intolerant to gluten in the past as in I used to frequently consume wheat and other processed foods and never had an issue with those. I'm fairly slim and I've always had a pretty slim face, which only perhaps got momentarily puffy in the mornings due to water retention, which would immediately go away within minutes. However, one month ago I started noticing, after a weekend of particularly extreme binge eating, my face suddenly got extremely swollen and the puffiness would not go away despite me drinking a ton of water, doing a lot of exercise, jade roller, cold compress, and having foods with a lot of potassium since the net suggested that I might have too much sodium in my body.This continued for weeks until there was finally a lull and my face returned to its original state, but that only stayed for about two or three days before it was puffy again. And this again continued for about two weeks or so when the puffiness again subsided. And up till that point, I was not keeping a record of exactly what I was eating because I was suspicious that it might be hypothyroidism that was causing the inflammation that was occurring. However, I had my blood work done where the test for thyroid levels was also done and the blood work came back normal. Nothing was out of place. \n\nI have also considered water retention that could fluctuate based off my menstrual cycle. But since the puffiness of my face was extremely erratic- it could fluctuate within days and hours- and also, it did not follow the pattern that menstrual facial change usually follows- I can rule that out safely. Following that, I noticed a pattern of my face constantly fluctuating in puffiness. Mind you, puffiness was the only symptom. Sometimes I did have some acne flare-ups, but they were not so pressing as the facial puffiness. It got to the point where I was scared to even go out or see my face in the mirror because I already suffer from a lot of body dysmorphia.  \n\nA few  days ago, I noticed the puffiness subsided quite a bit and my face had pretty much returned to normal. I still had dull skin and some dark circles, but the puffiness was pretty much under control. However, it was still fluctuating noticeably. I noticed that this weekend, I ordered takeout (biryani from a restaurant where I\u2019ve ordered from before with no issues), went to sleep and when I woke up in the morning, my face was again swollen. \n\nThe puffiness hasn't gone down for three or four days. And if I'm not wrong, it will probably last more than a week because that's what happened last time. But I've recently been looking at gluten intolerance and I was wondering if maybe this fluctuating puffiness, since it doesn't seem to be a medical phenomenon or something that's wrong with me, it might be caused due to gluten intolerance and any suggestions that you guys might have.

{"title": "Hungy Root", "selftext": "Hey guys, I wanted to share my experience with HungryRoot in case anybody else has been eying them. It's a meal service similar to Hello Fresh but different in ways that make it much better for me personally. This is not an ad, I'm not being paid to promote them, I just wanted to share. \n\nMort importantly: they support dietary needs really well IMO. I can't speak to if they're celiac or allergen safe although the way they label their products I would think maybe? Somebody with more experience will have to tell me their opinion, I'm not sensitive to cross contamination so I don't know. You fill out a pretty extensive list of food and diet preferences when you sign up (which you can access any time to update), they can honor gluten free, dairy free, vegan, vegetarian, low sodium, keto, etc. They have substitutes for almost all items in their kits to support this, and while you're selecting recipes/meals they are set up with your ingredient preferences. I always double check of course but when you go to search through ingredients and meals it will alert you and say \"contains gluten.\" They carry brands like Canyon Bakehouse and Jovial and Kite Hill along with their own brand that they make gluten free. \n\nWe've been ordering from them weekly since January. It's $130 per box weekly for 8-10 meals (lunch/dinner) plus various snacks, drinks, and breakfast items depending on what you choose. Is that cheap? Not really, it comes out to $12 a plate plus a few snacks. Is it cheaper than eating out? Yes, and I loathe cooking so this Is saving my family money by not eating out every day. Also significantly healthier IMO. I also realize I'm paying for convenience, delivery, and pre-portioned food so I know that factors Into the price. \n\nOne thing that makes me feel mildly better about the price, sometimes you will get \"overflow.\" Ex- they will send an entire packet of gf tortillas or an entire box of pasta when the meal is technically only for a serving of 2. Their sauces also have usually 4-6 servings so I can stretch those types of meals further than just 2 portions. Knowing this, I can add an extra protein and/or vegetable with some of your leftover points for the week to get extra servings.\n\nThis works on a point system so my $130 gets me 54 points every week, each meal Is roughly 8-15 points depending on the ingredients, and the snacks are anywhere from 1/2 a point to 4-5. Each meal usually has 3-5 (almost always 4) ingredients and steps. This Is huge for me personally, I can select to have no raw meat so it's less cooking for me, everything comes together quickly and actually tastes good. My husband eats most of the meals I get too. These are significantly easier to put together than other meal plans I've tried, you can follow the directions on the recipe cards or you can go rogue like I do (sometimes I don't want to roast the veggies but they often comes In steamer bags so I can pop them In the microwave for 3 min to steam and be done with It). You select your meals one week before they ship so you do have to kind of keep up with it. The website selects meals for you but you can alter Ingredients or delete the selection altogether and browse to pick your own. You can also skip the week on the site, it's very easy to do. \n\nOne thing I love is that the deliver snacks and gf products along with meals, so some weeks I get veggies packs and gf muffins or overnight oats and smoothies, gf cookie dough, etc. they also add in produce so some weeks I get a bag of apples or grapefruits, etc. This is included in the plan I picked and the price I mentioned above. One other thing I realllllly love is that I can substitute out ingredients In the app while I'm planning. Ex- I don't eat spinach so I find a recipe that has spinach as a side, I can either \"substitute\" and if the app doesn't find a substitution of equal value, I can just remove the ingredient from that meal and then browse through grocery section to select a side I prefer. When you remove the ingredient It takes the points out of that meal, so if the meal was 9 points and the spinach was worth 2, the cart changes to only 7 points until I browse groceries and add back in the side I want. \n\nI have had issues with deliveries, it's not perfect. They have always refunded when my food doesn't show up, I realize It's a carrier Issues and not the company Itself but it's still their responsibility. I do think part of that Is my location, almost the mountains, because food always comes for me really late almost 8PM most days so I think I'm the last delivery for the truck and sometimes they can't make it to my house. \n\nIf you have any questions I'm happy to answer them. I think I can get a 50% off your first box code If you're interested, no pressure at all I just wanted to share because It has helped me a lot.

{"title": "I think I got glutened by my friends", "selftext": "I have been gluten free for almost 5 years. I have IBS-M, and one of the treatments to find triggers was an elimination diet, since both my endoscopy and colonoscopy only showed irritation.\n\nLast week, my roommate and her boyfriend invited my partner and I over to his place for dinner. They wanted to cook stir fry for us! They emphasized that it would of course be made gluten free, and I offered them the GF soy sauce in my fridge for them to use. They forgot it and went to cook at his place. My partner texted my roommate to ask if they wanted us to bring the bottle, and they said no because they bought some themselves.\n\nWhen we arrived, they brought up that they 1) forgot the soy sauce I offered, 2) forgot they needed to change the ingredients and accidentally started cooking with normal soy sauce and had to save that for themselves, and 3) said they rinsed the dishes they were cooking in and had to restart with gluten free. I may have misheard or misunderstood them, because my partner heard that they rinsed the \\*food\\* and not just the dishes.\n\nThe food was good. I asked if they could taste any difference in the soy sauce used, and they said no. I had no issues for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next morning, I was experiencing the WORST abdominal pain I have had in YEARS! I was using the bathroom, and I was getting intense muscle cramps/aches from my rectum to my ribs. It was tender to the touch on the outside. For a moment, I was convinced my appendix was bursting because of the rapid onset of intensity. This experience consisted of me writhing around in pain unable to defecate due to the sharpness that would result when my rectal muscles were at all contracted. I was so miserable, and I downed an antispasmodic and ibuprofen once I left the bathroom.\n\nInitially, I didn't blame the food for my symptoms, but I historically take 8-10 hours for my gluten intolerance to show itself. I am frustrated because I feel that I should have questioned the ingredients of this more, but I thought it would have been a simple switch to make. I now know why so many of you on here warn others not to trust someone else's cooking.\n\nI am feeling much better today, although I still have residual cramping.\n\nEDIT: They told me the ingredients they used were \"gf\" soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, and numerous spices. Is there a chance that any of the other ingredients could have contained gluten?\n\nEDIT 2: I finally got photos of the ingredients [pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/s/tmJqGLevgO)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1k60aoa/i_think_i_got_glutened_by_my_friends/", "created_utc": 1745417836.0, "score": 193, "author": "thicc-dumbass", "num_comments": 153, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1k60aoa/i_think_i_got_glutened_by_my_friends/", "html_title": ""}

I've been working with a functional medicine doctor on some weight- and health-related stuff and got a genetic test done for different biomarkers. One that stood out to her was a double mutation of HLA DQ2 and 8, suggesting that I would be at heightened risk for a gluten sensitivity and/or celiac.\n\nSo, here's the thing - I don't eat a lot of gluten anyway, just not really how I structure my diet, but when I do consume gluten I do not have any ill effects or symptoms that I notice. I'm going to try going totally gluten free for a couple of weeks just to see how I feel, but I don't suspect it's sustainable for me in the long term unless something forces my hand (ie, I start actually noticing negative effects from eating gluten).\n\nThat being said, I am curious about any sort of digestive enzyme or other product that would maybe be beneficial in the event that I *did* decide to consume gluten, similar to how people with lactose intolerance will take a lactase enzyme if the whole crew wants to go out for pizza or ice cream.\n\nI am confident that there is nothing that would completely neutralize the issue, of course, this is just kind of for the sake of experimentation. \"How do I feel totally gluten free?\" \"How do I feel if I take this enzyme before I eat gluten?\" \"How do I feel if I just eat gluten normally?\"\n\nHope this question makes sense, any insight is useful.

Definitely haven't had a \"hard\" poop though in almost a year!! \n\nWhen I went to the doctor for issues i did stool samples and they just said change the diet and if it doesn't change I should see a specialist.

{"title": "Strangest Bit of Misinformation?", "selftext": "This weekend, someone asked if I wanted a fried pie.  I said I'd have to pass because I'm trying to eat gluten-free, following an emergency colon resection, last October.

I mentioned I was given a recipe that called for almond flour (and had a really good texture), but I can't eat almonds, and the other flour substitute I used created a crumbly mess.  Then I asked what kind of flour her daughter made.\n\nShe said her daughter bought her own mill because she hated being limited when eating gluten-free. Grinding her own wheat seeds allowed her to ensure the flour was more pure and safe to eat.  Confused, I clarified that I was avoiding wheat because I didn't want the gluten it contained to cause further damage to my intestinal lining.\n\nShe nodded and explained that consuming wheat in a more *pure* form, helps eliminate stomach distress, and *heals the intestine*.  I mentioned that sometimes people think gluten is the culprit, when the trigger food is actually something else.  She just told me I should consider milling my own wheat flour. \n\nI was surprised, as I had never heard anything like this before.  Is this something people encourage?

Well I had a lot of gluten this week. The day after eating bread breaded chicken and gluten filled desserts I had almost passed out three times this week from what seems like I have low iron. I woke up nauseous and like I was coming down with something. Some of my other symptoms just felt like I had low iron or was a anemic. I haven\u2019t had a low iron or malabsorption to iron once I started eating gluten free.

{"title": "How to heal completely?", "selftext": "Hi guys! I am quite sure that I have NCGS although I am self diagnosed. My history:\n\nI am 32M. In childhood, when I was around 3 or 4, I used to cry a lot complaining of headaches. My parents consulted a lot of doctors but nobody could explain the reason behind the headaches. As I got older that subsided, and I was generally healthy during my teenage years except that I had allergies - allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis which used to flare up during particular seasons. But this wasn\u2019t too severe and I could manage it without any medication. Then when I was about 18 or 19, I suddenly started suffering from sharp pains in my lower abdomen (on the left side) for which I also saw a lot of doctors l, underwent scans, which couldn\u2019t come up with anything at all. That also subsided after a while. The next part is about sinus related issues. Not long after the abdominal issue, I suddenly wake up one day with tremendous sinus pressure and a total lack of balance, dizziness, etc. A doctor mentioned that I have severe allergies along with a deviated nasal septum which is causing all this and he asked me to avoid particular foods in order to not worsen it later on. This issue kind of remained with me but again I was able to manage it without any medications. It also became less severe as I got older. During my college years, I was generally fine. Sporty, doing all the things that a regular college goer does - smoking, drinking, junk food, etc. Everything was fine until when I was about 23, I wake up one night with a severe asthma attack (first time in my life). Doctors said it was severe allergies. The asthma continued for quite a while and then suddenly came about a host of other symptoms. Debilitating migraines, GERD, allergies worsening, and eventually severe health anxiety. I was hospitalised where they diagnosed me as a hypochondriac because they could not find anything specific. On the migraines and other things they just said that it is normal to have those things but not normal to overthink about them which I was doing. Hence, the psychological diagnosis of hypochondriasis. Soon after I suffered from depression. For no reason at all. And I could absolutely feel within myself that it wasn\u2019t my mental state that was triggering it, but rather a sudden hormonal change that would make me feel intensely sad for no reason. Doctors, therapists forcibly tried to attribute causes to it making the entire thing psychological. They would say all my physical symptoms (as described above), were all because of my psychological issues. But I couldn\u2019t explain to them that it was the other way around-that because my physical health deteriorated I wasn\u2019t feeling good mentally. My parents were very supportive and took me to a lot of doctors but all of them went in the psychological direction. At one point, I just accepted it for what it is and convinced myself that I have to live with it. I kept having gastrointestinal issues, allergies, asthma, depression, anxiety, and all of this reduced my performance in sports, academics , affected my social life. But since I got used to it it was easier to manage. I would also say that the symptoms got better over time as I started living a healthier life compared to college days. But nevertheless I never felt like before. Specifically not like how I was before my first asthma attack. Among the most prominent symptoms that I had at this point was inflammation. I would feel inflamed all over my body for no particular reason. I also at this point saw that my symptoms graduating to things which my mother had. So, that was a bit consoling as I could blame it on genetics. But there was still this lingering skepticism in me which kept me thinking that there is some cause to all of this which nobody was able to identify. I constantly kept researching and researching and ultimately came to the conclusion that it was food. Popular online forums suggested elimination diets cutting off common culprits such as dairy and gluten. I first tried cutting off dairy which made me feel better (less bloated), but didn\u2019t affect my other chronic symptoms. And then I cut gluten off and BAMM!!!! In a week, I feel like I haven\u2019t felt like in the last 8 or 9 years. Way more energy, less bloating, easy stomach, reduction in inflammation, allergies subsiding (I can go out on long walks during spring now), brain fog gone. Things keep getting better and better as I continue avoiding gluten (for 8 months now). But there are some symptoms that still linger on. \n\n1) Stiff and painful joints in the lumbar and cervical regions (although it has become way better than before)\n\n2) Tinnitus \n\nAny idea if these are related to my gluten sensitivity? How to heal them faster? \n\nP.S: I still consume dairy, but no corn, oats. And I try to be strictly gluten free with minimal to no chance of cross contamination.

I did go gluten free for the past two days and felt alot better on the 2nd day. The brain fog lifted and I had alot more energy. The abdominal pain was odd since it would usually happen the next day in the mornings and it would dissipate usually by the afternoons..

Having something autoimmune increases your chances of developing other autoimmune conditions which I'm a bit fearful of. Here's the catcher is that my dad was diagnosed with celiac disease in his 40s so I know that puts  me a higher risk bracket of having it. However I'm curious to know what would be my chances of having NCGS ? I'm a 33M if that even matters.

{"title": "Eating Gluten Abroad", "selftext": "Hi all! \n\nI am studying abroad in Germany in the fall. My question is how do I know if I am one of those people who can eat non-american foods containing gluten without side effects? I know if you have celiac, it doesn't matter, but you \\*may\\* be able to if you have a gluten intolerance or wheat allergy. \n\nHere is where it gets complicated. I was experiencing symptoms at 11 years old (I am 24 now) and my doctor back then recommended I cut out gluten for a few weeks, I did and felt a decent amount better. He never tested me for celiac, and just told me this means I have a sensitivity and that I could safely have gluten a couple of times a week, and I believed him!\n\nOver the next 10 years, I gradually ate less and less gluten, it would always hurt my stomach after I had it, I went from a couple meals a week to avoiding as much as possible, but still having things like soy sauce or cross contaminated foods at restaurants, because I was told that wouldn't effect me by my doctor (again, with no tests). I had lotsssss of GI problems in college, and after trying everything else I asked a new doctor if they could test me for celiac. They said no, as the results wouldn't be accurate unless I was eating a normal gluten-filled diet for months before, which of course would be very painful for me. \n\n  \nSo, I started acting like I am celiac since no one would confirm, avoiding all cross contamination, traces, etc 3 years ago. I still have occasional stomach issues but it is DRASTICALLY better. \n\nNow I am spending 6 months in Germany for grad school, and am thinking about this a lot. Of course I know the safest option is to continue to act like I am celiac to avoid any potential issues. But, it would obviously be a lot less limiting if I could not worry about cross contamination or even some gluten in my food while I am in Germany and traveling around Europe. I know the only way to really know is if I got tested. I guess I am just looking for some opinions/tips if possible!

Here is the recipe in case it helps someone else.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 cup all purpose gluten free baking blend *(We use Unrefined Bakery\u2019s blend)... only in Dallas area, but they do ship in the U.S.*\n* 2 teaspoons black pepper\n* 2 teaspoons salt\n* 2 tablespoons paprika\n* 2 tablespoons onion powder\n* 1/4 cup water\n* Canola oil for frying\n* Chicken tenders\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Mix the flour, pepper, salt, paprika, and onion powder in a bowl\n2. In a separate bowl, mix 1/4 cup of the dry mixture with 1/4 cup water to make a thick paste\n3. Dip chicken tenders in the paste, then coat in the dry mix\n4. Heat oil in a skillet to 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit\n5. Fry tenders for 8 minutes\n6. Drain on paper towels and check that the internal temp is at least 165 degrees\n\n**Tip:** If you're frying in multiple batches, make sure the oil heats back up to 350 to 375 degrees before starting the next round. If the oil is too cool, the tenders will turn out soggy instead of crispy.\n\nThese have been a game changer for us and I hope they help someone else looking for a safe and tasty option for their family. Let me know if you try them or if you have a favorite allergy friendly dish to share.\n\nIf you are looking for more recipes like this one, I put together a cookbook with all of our favorites from the past 12 years.

{"title": "Extreme low mood since going gluten free.", "selftext": "Anyone else experienced this? \nI started eating majority gluten free about 2 years ago when our youngest child was diagnosed with celiac disease. At first it was a solidarity move, as she was only 5 at the time, but my husband and I noticed we felt so much better since going gf. Also, her GI physician explained that 40% of Caucasian people carry the genes to potentially develop Celiac disease, and after doing some family history, we were curious.\n\nFast forward to now, my husband has remained strictly gf, but I have wavered due to high food cost, it's easier, etc. \nI recently made the decision to completely go back to gf due to digestive issues. Physically I've noticed a great improvement, just as before, but mentally my low mood has made my life miserable. \n\nI have a history of chronic anxiety and depression (which I have aggressively fought for many years with SSRIs, vitamins, exercise, etc) and was relatively stable. \nSince going gf 3-4 weeks ago, my mood has plummeted.

{"title": "Question about symptoms to Gluten intolerance.", "selftext": "Hi everyone, hope you\u2019re all doing well.\n\nI am making this post in a desperate attempt to figure out whats wrong with me & I feel like gluten intolerance and or wheat allergy might be the culprit for all my issues. \n\nFor the past year I have been struggling with the fear that my next meal could flare up a whole new set of problems & its been affecting my life for the absolute worse.\n\nMy symptoms in order from how they began are.\n\n1. Excessive belching after eating, beyond that of a normal person. Feels nothing like a soda burp. Almost as if my stomach gets inflated with gas & I have to release it as a burp. This will happen multiple times after a meal and have lasted even 2-3 hours after a meal. \n\n2. Shortness of breath, this is absolutely the worst symptom I have and I pray everyday that this symptom would just disappear. The best way I can explain it is as if I can no longer let my body do the breathing, I have to step in & manually take deep breaths to bring ease. Feels almost as if I\u2019m hungry for air. Sometimes a deep breath through my mouth doesn\u2019t seem sufficient enough & it has become something that comes into effect maybe 1-2 hours after every meal, it can last over an hour as-well. (My oxygen levels don\u2019t drop & its not as bad as someone with asthma for example but it still feels like something that can worsen over time & I fear this.)\n\n3. Regurgitation/Acid Reflux, with the constant belching, I understand that the air trapped in your stomach can push the food back up but whats weird about this is that along with my shortness of breath, sometimes I feel like I have to forcefully regurgitate a mouth full of stomach acid and whatever I ate in order to ease my breathing & most of the time it actually fixes it. I don\u2019t know why it works that way but when my breathing gets really bad, I will force myself to regurgitate a mouth full of what looks like a milky white liquid along with pieces of what I ate & it will make me feel better. (Disgusting I know :/ )\n\n4. What feels like a lump in my throat, this may be caused by the acid reflux but then again could be an allergy? I\u2019m not sure. Sometimes feels like a dry throat but sometimes an actual lump. No pain just a minor discomfort.\n\n5. Anxiety/Depression, I have been suffering pretty bad anxiety. The shortness of breath and other symptoms can make it worse as well so when it all hits together it feels like your world is crashing down. Hyperventilation from it sometimes causes numb hands (needle feeling).\n\n6. Random headaches. This doesn\u2019t happen too often but more often than it should.\n\n\nThese are my symptoms and I have explained them as best as I can, if anyone feels anything similar, I would love to hear your insight. \n\nI would like to add that before today, white bread & pretty much all breads have been a regular part of my diet. (Literally everyday, chicken sandwiches, steak sandwiches ect.) I don\u2019t cook at home & mostly depend on uber eats/eating out. I have officially began a gluten free diet today in hopes that this might be my problem all along. I\u2019m 29 M and have had these symptoms on and off for about 5 years but this year it\u2019s gotten really bad to the point that I can\u2019t keep living like this & must figure it out and make changes. \n\nI have also gone to the doctor & they pointed at Anxiety/GERD with barely any testing. Seemed almost lazy. It was probably my fault since I didn\u2019t express much concern and seemed perfectly normal at the visit. \n\nAny insight would be INSANELY appreciated.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1jvcwcn/question_about_symptoms_to_gluten_intolerance/", "created_utc": 1744223048.0, "score": 2, "author": "NotVngel", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/glutenfree/comments/1jvcwcn/question_about_symptoms_to_gluten_intolerance/", "html_title": ""}

I had my gallbladder removed although I wasn\u2019t sold that was the issue, but I still went through with it and things have gotten worse since then. I\u2019ve gone dairy free in the past and there wasn\u2019t a drastic change. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago where I met with a nutritionist to further my quest of finding out what is wrong with me. She suggested I try going gluten-free for breakfast into monitor how I felt. I decided to go all in just to speed up the process and find an answer. The first week I was gluten-free I felt significantly better, I still felt a little off, but the stomach pains were gone. The second week was a lot more rough and the stomach pains were back, but not as frequent. Now it just completed my third week of gluten-free and I\u2019m still not sure if I feel better. This last week has brought extreme bloating, which I thought had gone down significantly in the first week. The bloating is extremely uncomfortable and frustrating. I know these things take time but with me feeling so much better the first week and now kind of just reverting back to old symptoms. I am wondering if I truly do have non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

It started when I would frequently get sick with no explanation from eating food. I tried many things to figure out what it was and saw many doctors and gastroenterologists. I thought it was lactose at first, but I found myself getting sick even when I had no dairy. I was tested for Celiac disease, but I tested negative. Another doctor suggested I might be gluten intolerant, so I stopped eating gluten and stopped having problems.\n\nToday, however, I went to a restaurant with gluten-free options, and for some reason unknown to me, I forgot to order gluten-free bread. I didn't realize until I was halfway through the sandwich, and I still am not sick from it. I've been alright with some sourdough in the past (though occasionally I get sick if I eat too much). This bread, however, was without a doubt whole grain. Now, I am questioning everything.\n\nHas anyone with gluten intolerance found certain foods okay? Or perhaps have I been wrongly diagnosed? Has anyone had the intolerance fade? One doctor told me she thought I developed it due to long COVID, which I had two years ago.

{"title": "Extreme Fatigue but no stomach issues", "selftext": "I have a history of Celiac in my family (my grandmother and sister both have it). Since my teens (in early 40s now) I have always had stomach issues and bloating specifically after meals. After my sister was diagnosed with Celiac she convinced me to get tested. The test did not come back positive for celiac but showed some suggestion that I may have an intolerance to gluten. \n\nI decided to go gluten free. I felt my bloating and stomach issues go down significantly. I followed this diet for about a year. Then one day I accidentally ate gluten and panicked thinking that because of my new diet that the effects would be terrible. To my surprise there was no effect. I slowly started to introduce gluten back into my diet and no side effects. It felt as if my body reset and I longer had the issues i had prior. This has been the case for the past 4 years. \n\nBut recently (the last year) I have had fairly extreme fatigue. I thought perhaps my thyroid so I got blood work and everything looked fine.

{"title": "Testing for Celiac", "selftext": "Background: I have had pain in my upper stomach that comes and goes since 2013/2014. Around 2017 I was having a lot of gastro issues. Also, was having vestibular migraine issues (got diagnosed at this time). Was diagnosed with IBS but no further exams or anything were done. No tests nothing. Around early 2019 I traveled to a country that had lots of glutinous food and I ate a ton. I had some cramping and tons of gas. Like ten seconds couldn\u2019t pass without passing the largest stinkiest gas. It was constant for days. I think I had joint pain and then a weird rash on my arm. Looked up the rash thing and thought gluten. Doctor sent blood test with other things. Darn lab didn\u2019t run the gluten blood tests and I didn\u2019t find out until a few weeks after I went gluten free. Symptoms were much less, so went mostly gluten free with some cheating here or there with severe gas for a day or two after.  \n\nFlash forward, 2020 I got really consitpated. Stuck with GF. By 2023, I switched to loose stools. I slowly became more strict about gluten (and dairy). Stomach issues settled but loose stools never stopped. \n\nFinally got a gastroenterologist referral. Of course the blood tests came back negative cause I\u2019ve been gluten free for many years and the last year I\u2019ve been diligent. He did genetic testing and I have a high risk for celiac. I have a colonoscopy and endoscopy scheduled in 8 weeks. He said to eat bread every day. I had my first slice of banana nut bread last night. \n\nOf course I woke up with a chest cold (little toddler in daycare). But I am totally debilitated. My migraine is off the charts bad. Like I haven\u2019t had it this bad in so many years if ever. I am very nauseous when I stand up and dizzy. I can\u2019t get out of bed. My body is crazy achy, but I\u2019m also sick. I took dayquil and it helps with some of the body aches but not much and doesn\u2019t touch my head. Is a gluten reaction that bad or is this a really weird cold? I didn\u2019t have any signs of my cold last night before bed, it\u2019s all just hit me through the night. I am in so my pain everywhere and I can\u2019t move without feeling super sick.

{"title": "Gluten Intolerance? Or could there be more to it?", "selftext": "I have had issues with constipation for years. I would bleed when I pooped, at least a week or two a month, I was always so bloated, miserable. A friend suggested that I try out a gluten free diet, and my problems started showing up less and less. For the first time in years, I was pooping regularly, I was losing weight (I started at 260 and got down to 220)... things were going well. Since starting that diet, now when I eat gluten, my problems are every single time. If i eat any gluten, I don't have any immediate symptoms other than bloating, and then exactly 3 days later, it feels like I am pooping glass, and there is a large dripping amount of bright red blood. I tried going to the urgent care because I was in so much pain down there, and they referred me to a GI doctor, I went 3 weeks later and they said I had celiac symptoms, but gave me the blood test and it was negative, although I did have severe vitamin deficiencies... I found out later that I should have had gluten before the test, as I had not eaten any since 3 weeks before. I am having a bad flair up currently, and have had severe, painful, bleeding hemorrhoids for over a week now. Usually they would only hurt when I was actively using the restroom, but the pain has been constant for over a week. Sitting, standing, walking... doesnt matter. I even had a colonoscopy in January, and while there were pre-cancerous polyps, the doctor just told me \"If it hurts when you eat gluten, don't eat it.\" I told them I was just in severe pain and feeling alone, because I hadn't talked to anyone else with these symtoms, and they scoffed at me and said they'd seen it before tons of times. Even when I went to him last week for the severe pain, he told me the same thing, gave me a hydrocortisone cream, and said he didn't need to look and see what was going on, because he saw in January... but I wasn't hurting in January, so he didn't actually see what was going on. I also have had orange-ish chunks in my stool, that google said could be fat malabsorption. Sorry for the long post, but I just have run out of options, and I feel like there has to be more to this than \"if it hurts, don't eat it\", but maybe that really is all there is to it.

{"title": "Am I gluten intolerant? PLEASE HELP!! This is driving me crazy.", "selftext": "Hello, please help me understand if I'm suffering from food sensitivity or possibly a gluten intolerance. First off, I have never been intolerant to gluten in the past as in I used to frequently consume wheat and other processed foods and never had an issue with those. I'm fairly slim and I've always had a pretty slim face, which only perhaps got momentarily puffy in the mornings due to water retention, which would immediately go away within minutes. However, one month ago I started noticing, after a weekend of particularly extreme binge eating, my face suddenly got extremely swollen and the puffiness would not go away despite me drinking a ton of water, doing a lot of exercise, jade roller, cold compress, and having foods with a lot of potassium since the net suggested that I might have too much sodium in my body.This continued for weeks until there was finally a lull and my face returned to its original state, but that only stayed for about two or three days before it was puffy again. And this again continued for about two weeks or so when the puffiness again subsided. And up till that point, I was not keeping a record of exactly what I was eating because I was suspicious that it might be hypothyroidism that was causing the inflammation that was occurring. However, I had my blood work done where the test for thyroid levels was also done and the blood work came back normal. Nothing was out of place. \n\nI have also considered water retention that could fluctuate based off my menstrual cycle. But since the puffiness of my face was extremely erratic- it could fluctuate within days and hours- and also, it did not follow the pattern that menstrual facial change usually follows- I can rule that out safely. Following that, I noticed a pattern of my face constantly fluctuating in puffiness. Mind you, puffiness was the only symptom. Sometimes I did have some acne flare-ups, but they were not so pressing as the facial puffiness. It got to the point where I was scared to even go out or see my face in the mirror because I already suffer from a lot of body dysmorphia.  \n\nA few  days ago, I noticed the puffiness subsided quite a bit and my face had pretty much returned to normal. I still had dull skin and some dark circles, but the puffiness was pretty much under control. However, it was still fluctuating noticeably. I noticed that this weekend, I ordered takeout (biryani from a restaurant where I\u2019ve ordered from before with no issues), went to sleep and when I woke up in the morning, my face was again swollen. \n\nThe puffiness hasn't gone down for three or four days. And if I'm not wrong, it will probably last more than a week because that's what happened last time. But I've recently been looking at gluten intolerance and I was wondering if maybe this fluctuating puffiness, since it doesn't seem to be a medical phenomenon or something that's wrong with me, it might be caused due to gluten intolerance and any suggestions that you guys might have.
