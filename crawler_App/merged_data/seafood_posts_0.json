It's based on foods grown in the coastal area, and includes rice, grits, fish, shellfish, and vegetables. \nSlave food\nThe food rations given to enslaved people, which often included cornmeal, salt fish, and other basic foods. These rations were often meager and didn't always meet the demands of daily work. \nSoul food\nTraditional African American cooking that includes foods like collard greens, cornbread, and chitterlings. It was developed by enslaved Black people in the rural South. \nLowcountry cuisine is a unique culinary tradition in the Southeast.

It can be considered overcooked if you cook for someone else. But for example, my mom can\u2019t eat pink meat. Trauma from being lovingly forcefed meat by her countryside family made her hate that taste. She cooks her steaks well done. I eat mine still mooing on the plate.\n\nI would strive to be able to cook the scallops the \u201cright way\u201d (and these look pretty delicious ngl) but don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad because some internet troll said you \u201covercooked them\u201d\n\nEDIT: Looks like some people are salty because I called out their bad attitude. So I guess I should clarify for our special friends.\n\nWhen you work in a professional kitchen. Yes there are such things as \"overcooking\" and \"undercooking\" foods. Professional kitchen are designed to make as much money as possible by appealing to and feeding the masses, or by appealing to and feeding rich people. So the standard of doneness (or temperature if referring to meat, specifically steak) is designed to appeal to the as many people as possible, or high class tastes. And in this environment as a cook or chef, you should apply these standards.\n\nBut in a home environment, things change because you're not feeding the masses, you're not feeding the rich. You are feeding yourself, you family, and maybe some guests. Let's use a steak as an example: A perfect medium rare (which most people enjoy) is \\~128 to 135F. If you go below that you undercooked it. If you go above that you overcooked it. But if you like a blue rare steak, a perfect medium rare is overcooked. If you like a well done steak, a perfect medium rare is undercooked. \n\nCook your food so that the people who will eat it will enjoy it. As I said, you \\*should\\* try to cook a perfect medium rare and taste it at least once. But if you don't like it, why would you listen to some kissless angry boi on reddit about how its \"overcooked\" when it's not overcooked \\*for you\\*.", "They look disgusting.

Another sets up a store to sell to an individual customer or spend even more resources to put it on a plate, serve it to you with lemon and butter, and then clean up after your meal. \n\nEach of these steps takes resources like rent/mortgage, labor, fuel, insurance, equipment, marketing, etc. in varying amounts depending on the step. And companies/individuals don\u2019t invest money to perform services and break even. They risk money to make money, so some profit is involved. If a company is profiting a lot, competition comes along, because everyone likes money. \n\nComplaining about the price of a crab is like complaining about the price of a beer. The beer costs different depending on the step it\u2019s on. Wheat, rice, and barley is super cheap from the farmer. Then it gets more expensive as it gets moved, changed into beer in a bottle, and then stored and moved multiple times. That same bottle gets more expensive from distributor, store, or bar. A $1 beer from a supermarket is $2 at a convenience store, $5 at a restaurant, and $10 at a decent hotel, $18 at a stadium. \n\nEVERYTHING is worth what it costs. That\u2019s the definition of worth. A crab dinner worth $100 because that\u2019s the price a consumer and the companies that made up the chain of supply agreed upon. \n\nIf it\u2019s not worth it to you, or everyone, that\u2019s fine.

One meaning is \"dig deep\" because of how deep one has to dig for them. The second meaning is \"ugly genitals\" for the obviously phallic nature of the geoducks neck, but also for the way the body of a geoduck resembles a vagina once the shell is removed. \n\nGeoduck is one of my favorite seafoods. For clarity, I'm partial to shellfish. The neck makes amazing sashimi with a great crunchy texture, or sliced equally thin and thrown into noodles right before serving. I like to do tempura with the  body meat, which is very very tender. \n\nPuget Sound harvested geoduck is a very well managed and sustainable fishery. Divers are only allowed to harvest from a certain depth zone, leaving lots of large spawning geoduck in deeper and shallower water to keep the population healthy. This is important because geoduck are broadcast spawners, so as they get bigger the amount of spawn they release increases a lot. There is a smaller geoduck dive fishery in SE Alaska as well as one overseas in China. I can't speak for anywhere else there may or may not be geoduck fisheries. \n\nLots of geoduck harvested in the Puget Sound is done so by Native Americans. I feel there's no need to explain why supporting Native American owned businesses is a good thing. \n\nEthics is definitely something to consider as a seafood lover. Like I said above, Puget Sound geodick is a fairly sustainable fishery and much is harvested by NA owned business.

You can throw a dash of the water from the boil as a broth to thin out your butter sauce if you want. But if you're spending $30+ per person on protein, I wouldn't go cheap on the butter. \n\nA lot of boil restaurants are basically boiling the seafood in a bag with the butter mix I just described, NOT directly in seasoned water. The water itself, ideally, is\n\nI've found that seasoning the water really doesn't do shit for me tbh. I've skimped on the water seasoning before and barely noticed aside from the corn and potatoes. \n\n\nThe videos online by Cajun guys in the woods who look like they know their shit... In my opinion... Do not seem to know their shit. Cooking it like that produces some very mediocre boils. \n\nALSO... I know the budget really feels this one, but I do not think crab is particularly worth it in a boil. Unless you can go for king crab. Snow crab is an excessive amount of work and mess for very little reward. I usually go straight shrimp and sausage. I also really like mussels/clams but that doesn't fit my work vs reward argument... At least you're not having to crack shit open though.\n\nThese people hating on the portions are crazy. This would be more than enough for one person for sure. Also good choice on the peeled shrimp. A lot of people get skin on shrimp because they think it remains more flavor. I think the difference is negligible and peeling skin off slows down the eating process lmao. I just want at the shrimpies, I don't wanna have to dissect em.", "Are people afraid to season their seafood?", "Looks dope! I would add more corn since its cheap", "Butter & garlic & seasonings", "Cajun here.\n\nCouple of thoughts, don\u2019t cook the sausage with the other ingredients. Just BBQ or cook in a pan. Sausage fat renders in the water and sticks to everything. So everything gets coated in slime and tastes a bit like pork fat.\n\nUnpeeled shrimp but others have mentioned that.\n\nWhen you boil the only way to control cooking times is by staggering the ingredients. Think about what takes longest to cook for order and how long each takes to cook. Overcooked shrimp or crab is mush and undercooked potatoes are inedible/unsafe.\n\nKeep an instant thermometer on hand for the water. Every time you drop in large quantities of cold seafood, you drop the water temperature, so you want to keep the heat on high when you\u2019re adding things in. But shrimp cook in 2 minutes and crab cooks in 30 seconds. So you want to drop the temp of the water immediately after cook time as fast as possible. Hose the outside of the pot to draw heat away. Stir the pot constantly to release heat, or freeze a big block of heavily seasoned water to drop in (not to dilute the mixture). You want to get the water under the cook temp as quickly as possible so it can soak in the spices for as long as possible. \n\nWhile it\u2019s soaking under the cook temp, every 3-4 minutes you want to taste the seafood it to make sure it isn\u2019t getting mushy. If it starts to lose texture, pull immediately. And don\u2019t put it in a closed container after cooking or it will continue to cook. Spread it out.", "I think you need 5x the amount of seasonings at least", "Where's the Old Bay?", "it looks bland and dry", "Old bay seasoning. Apply liberally all over everything including corn and potatoes.", "If you want to stretch the seafood\n\nI would add things like mushrooms, brussel sprouts, green beans, heads of garlic, canned artichokes\n\nA homemade simple garlic bread would be a great side or some plain white rice also", "Two people?", "Maybe they\u2019re a senior citizen. That would explain the lack of seasoning."]}

I\u2019ve only eaten oysters once before, so I\u2019m not an expert, but these looked different from what I remember.\n\nWhen I opened them up, the color and texture seemed off compared to my previous experience. They almost felt like they had been cooked from the heat or something, which has me worried. A few of them were even spoiled, with a really bad smell.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Should oysters arrive cold, and what should I be looking out for to make sure they\u2019re safe to eat?\n\nThanks for any advice!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sksw01qaf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4eca929713cb2832e535d11037d7047baee77463\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4szc1qaf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f574760983a9c9c9da6c6836fd9bedb470e61087\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyrpc5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f452b70c06cf77496d9414a242def0ca5adf623\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0hb0j5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3afe8ebda971e3c9b9689725cb0278b1be01ecb3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7fds5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e86464afb7420ae42d1bbb11e4347a2dcd6368fd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c24ia6paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f5c96782199975daad1652f4f6ae6614d92d47b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xs9k5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d66a2f6754e319782c6d95bf267da6b3974ce268\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zz6lb6paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0003ca18825a85e3d6f488772370457b317711\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ehijqb/video/ycrlk36bf2gd1/player\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Seafood/comments/1ehijqb/oysters_delivered_warm_should_i_be_worried/", "created_utc": 1722523705.0, "score": 311, "author": "saslas22", "num_comments": 167, "permalink": "/r/Seafood/comments/1ehijqb/oysters_delivered_warm_should_i_be_worried/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet", "top_comments": ["Yeah I wouldn't let my tongue tickle any of those.", "Should have arrived ICE COLD and smell like the fresh ocean.

RD suggested she buy a dozen oysters and bury one in a houseplant for a few days, then dig it up and use an eyedropper to extract a drop of the juice, then squirt it into a freshly shucked one on a plate with the rest of the half dozen, and serve them to the wayward husband.

One testifying doctor in one case described oysters as germ bags lying on the bay floor straining every germ produced there. That is their job.

First. These are Pacific oysters. That is the species. Which is important because it gives us an idea of where they come from which helps determine their general health. Second, they are diploids, which means that they can reproduce. \nMany oyster companies have been able to genetically modify Pacifics to produce a triploid oyster, which cannot reproduce. While the triploid has a slightly higher mortality rate, it tends to be a better oyster to eat in summer months because its energy is preserved in the meat and not used to produce sperm or eggs (spawn). \nGood to note that to my knowledge Pacifics are the only oyster in which triploids exist, that is why you dont see Olympias or Kumamotos for a couple of months each summer. They are reproducing. \nI think people just grin and bear spawning Virginicas. I dont really know. \nThe first important thing to notice particular to these Oysters is that they are spawning. Is that bad? Well it is not unsafe, but the profile changes pretty dramatically and most people are turned off by the \u201ccreaminess\u201d of a spawning oyster. \nThe first oyster is the best one to identify the spawn, it is the white mass. I would also argue that the relative translucence of the remaining meat yields a less than optimal oyster. In colder waters you can sometimes find \u201cweak\u201d or translucent oysters toward the end of winter that just generally lack pungency\nThe first oyster is totally edible. And effectively alive for a brief period of time after it was open. It will be ok, but not spectacular. \nThe second two oysters  are probably the same, but look like they\u2019ve been shucked by the Tasmanians devil. There is spawn there.\nThe open oyster is dead. It may or may not smell depending on when it died. I threw 50 Pacifics away today and only a few smelled bad. Its easy to see a dead oyster.  The other 70 in the bag were awesome. Also that is a really high and unacceptable mortality rate, but I knew it was coming\nGenerally I would say find a grower who wet stores oysters for a few days before they send them out. Wet storage and filtration eliminates vibrio, the thing that makes us sick, to a pretty large degree. \nNo ousters  should not arrive warm, but remember because they grow on tidal beaches, they can easily stand being out of the water in heat waves for a decent amount of time. They are living beings capable of resilience. If they ARE alive, I would recommend cooling them down before consuming because they taste better. \nI live in the Northwest, have eaten tens of thousands of oysters and have never gotten sick. I do recommend to those who are knew to go easy as indulging in too much of a new thing is just difficult on our digestive systems- regardless of the thing.", "If it smells bad it is bad", "Call your rep and ruin their day; I personally would flip shit a bit harder than usual. Let them know this shit is NOT acceptable. You\u2019ll get a credit at the very least, if they respect you/your restaurant they should bring out a few fresh cases on top of a credit.

If they were \u201ccooked\u201d by the heat like you say,  the shells would be cracked open and would never shut again.  Oysters can survive in and out of the water for an extended period of time without refrigeration.  It doesn\u2019t really matter how warm they get, if they stay alive in the process they would still be safe.   Never eat a dead oyster or an oyster with an open shell that won\u2019t close (dead).

Pour Ro-Tel tomatoes and chilis over fish, return to broiler for 2 minutes. Serve over white rice. Use carcass for stock, freeze for use later in seafood gumbo.\n\nFilet. Pat filets dry. If they are big, cut into serving size pieces seggregated by thickness. Season with Slap Ya Mama, let stand for an hour to absorb flavor from spices. Dip in beaten egg and then dredge in bread crumbs, flour, and cornmeal. Fry in VERY hot cast iron skillet just until firm. Cover with Ro-Tel tomatoes and chilis. Cover with lid, turn fire off, let stand and cook a few minutes from residual heat. Serve over rice.\n\nFor a big sow snapper, gut and scale carefully, and remove gills. Wash well, especially body cavity. Stuff with something... use your imagination. Dirty rice and oysters, bread crumbs and shrimp, \"Stove Top\", crab meat, whatever. Score both sides. Preheat oven to 450. Place fish in big baking pan with peeled onions, fresh jalape\u00f1os cut in half and seeds removed, cubed ham or bacon, orange and lemon slices, whatever. Brush with olive oil or melted butter, then season with and lots of Slap Ya Mama. Top with lemon slices if you like. Bake in hot oven but do not overcook. The core should be still juicy and not fully cooked. A core temp of about 145 works great, if you have a meat thermometer. Adjust for preference, but the worst thing you can to to fish is to cook it until it is dry and fibrous through and through. Remove from oven and cover with aluminum foil if not serving immediately. To serve, cut straight down the medial line to the spine, and lift portions off from the bones. Then turn and do the same, or lift the skeleton off the bottom side, whichever you find easier. Remove the stuffing and serve. Carcass makes good stock, especially the meat from the head including the cheek meat. \n\nSmaller fish I like to bread and skillet fry whole, in 1/4\" of oil, turning once. You can also filet and cut into small portions, seggregated by thickness, season, batter dip, and deep fry in fresh and clean, very neutral oil like safflower or canola oil. Oil temp should be around 360, very hot but not smoking. There is a trick I use, cutting thick filets at a diagonal down angle so the thickness is more consistent. Try it! When pieces float, turn, then after one minute, remove and drain. Thinner pieces will cook faster than thicker. Do not overcook, but you want the batter to be a bit crispy and slightly browned. Serve with Remoulade sauce or mix up your own secret brew.

After steaming or boiling the tartlettes, you make a separate meat stew and then pour it over the top. It is mentioned in The Forme of Cury cookbook, the oldest English recipe compendium published in 1390.\n\nIt's not entirely known what the tartlettes look like, so we went for large tortellini. My girlfriend made the pasta using eggs, as well as the filling of brown and white crab meat, from our hens whilst I made the bisque. I quickly boiled the langoustines, then separated the meat from the shells and claws. Set this bulk of meat aside for the last stage. Any \"bits\" that fall off can be added to the bisque if you'd prefer. They're too finicky and not enough meat to attempt to scoop so after pulling the claws off, I just broke the arms open. I fried the shells and claws in a combination of butter and oil until they browned, then added finely chopped carrots, onions and garlic. After they were browned too, I added a glass of white wine and the water I kept aside when boiling the langoustines whole previously, which during this I'd had on a low simmer to reduce... and deglazed the bottom. You need enough liquid to just cover the shells and then put this mix on a low simmer for half an hour to 45 mins. \n\nDuring this time you can make the crab tartlettes. Minced garlic and onions are softened before being mixed with brown and white meat at a ratio of 1:2. Saffron and mace are added, with a dash of cream with salt and pepper until it was a soft \"paste\". Mace, the aril of the nutmeg, has a long history of use in English cooking but is not used much in Europe at all, even if it is readily available, which is a shame. It's just about my favourite spice. The crab is then mixed with a pinch of chopped chives and is then spoonfuls are wrapped in pasta dough and set them aside. We poached them only minutes before serving, ie towards the end of the next and final stage.\n\nAfter simmering the bisque, strain it off, keeping the solids aside. Turn out the liquid into a blender. After blending the sauce, add spoonfuls of the cooked vegetables until you get a consistency like soup. It will be quite thin, the sauce is thinner than you'd anticipate for tortellini. Add a tablespoon of cream and blend again. You can blend in some shell if you want, but personally I think the flavour is full enough. Pour this through a very fine sieve and return to a pan with a pinch more saffron, which was also suggested quite liberally as additions to our own recipes, as opposed to merely recreating Asian meals, despite having been inordinately expensive in centuries gone by (it's hardly \"cheap\" now). Slowly simmer for just ten minutes, and in the last few minutes add the meat from the start to heat through again... during which time you can poach the tartlettes. Serve up the tartlettes and pour the bisque over the top! Voil\u00e0, a 14th century English recipe. \n\nIf this is similar to how 'dumplings' are served in your culture, I'd be interested to hear.", "What a satisfying up vote.", "Crab and wine?

{"title": "Live lobster buying tip", "selftext": "As we approach the upcoming summer season, here\u2019s a tip for those that may be buying live lobster from a market/grocery store tank. \n\nLook at the \u201cantenna\u201d length. While not 100% foolproof, look for tanks with lobsters that still have their antenna intact. \n\nLobsters will be cannibalistic if necessary. However, given lobsters are banded inside these tanks they don\u2019t stand a chance getting a meal except for the softest and most accessible bit - the antenna. Lobsters in tanks with short, stubbed, antenna have likely been in that tank a long while and have gotten to each others antenna for some semblance of food. \n\nI personally will not buy live lobsters with clear signs of this long tank holding cannibalism. \n\nOf course it\u2019s also very important that when the fish monger retrieves a lobster from a tank that they display alertness and strength by raising their arms up and out and arch their backs. If a lobster comes out barely moving and its arms droop and dangle it\u2019s a sign of a weak, dying or even dead lobster.

Once the water is boiled, I , very reluctantly,  tossed them in the hot water and hoped for the best.  After 10 seconds, I had a look in the pot and the fuckers are still moving! in the boiling water!!  I felt so so bad. I turned up the gas so they can die quicker. And sooner they did. I felt real bad. \n\nAnyways, after some blanching. I used a tooth brush to scrub off the dark stuff off the abalone. Chinese people often think the stuff is dirt but in fact it\u2019s the actual skin\n\nI topped some ginger and scallions and steamed for 8 minutes.

Add lemon juice, \u00bc tsp salt, \u00bc pepper, and parsley. Cover and keep sauce at room temp or slightly warmer.\n\nPrepare the Branzino:\n\n4. Use paper towels to dry any excess moisture from branzino. Use a sharp knife to cut deep, 2-inch slits, about 1-inch apart along both sides of fish. Place fish on a large foil or parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\n5. Season each branzino cavity with \u00bc tsp salt and \u00bc pepper. Stuff each cavity with 2 or 3 lemon slices.

Safflower and sunflower oils are good also\n\n# Instructions\n\n* In a large bowl, whisk together the first 8 ingredients.\u00a0 Whisk in the beer until the batter is smooth, without lumps. Consistency should be similar to pancake batter. If too thick, add a bit of water to loosen. Set aside.\u00a0\n* In deep pot large enough to prevent over-crowding or deep fryer, heat oil to 350F. Keep watch on\u00a0cooking thermometer\u00a0throughout frying process, turning up the heat between batches so you can maintain the 350F while frying (maintaining oil temperature is essential for attaining crispy texture that\u2019s not too greasy.)\u00a0\n* Use paper towels to fully pat dry all excess moisture from the fish fillets on all sides. Place enough cornstarch in a shallow pan, to be used for dredging.\u00a0\n* Working in batches, dredge a few fish fillets into cornstarch and shake off excess.\u00a0 Dip fish into batter, let excess drip off, and gently submerse in the oil (I use a\u00a0splatter guard.)*Do not overcrowd;*\u00a0be sure pieces do not touch each other or they will stick together.\u00a0\n* Turn fish over in oil as needed to evenly brown all sides, about 2 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.

They got a crispy skin and it smelled amazing but it honestly didn\u2019t look that great, since the meat was still dark.

It's still a very different fish and has some \"issues\" to overcome (for most palettes) - but more importantly, it's not a \"beginner\" fish - if that makes sense.  The only time I've been able to genuinely enjoy it, it was baked in a rich, spicy tomato based sauce, with the acid really helping to cut back the strong oily thing.  Having caught, bled and gutted a few in my day and cooked fresh from the catch, I have to admit those days are done and if I hook into one these days it would be sport fishing, and usually then accidental with the striper runs.

And I don't think I've ever *bought* bluefish that had been handled wrong. \n\nIf you're making dip out of it. *Smoke it*. \n\nSmoked bluefish is massively traditional in the North East, and the primary use for large examples.

Lay salmon fillets on grill and cook on medium-high heat until just-cooked. If cooking indoors, cover pan partially to reduce smoke. Cook about 2-3 min per side, depending on thickness. Do not over-cook.\n* Let cooked fish rest at room temp for a few minutes before serving.\u00a0\n* Drizzle salmon fillets generously with teriyaki sauce and garnish as desired. Serve immediately. Delicious over a bed of rice or over a plate of green salad.\n\nI make this salmon all the time; it's my go-to recipe.\n\nMy recipe and pictures: [https://www.chewoutloud.com/grilled-teriyaki-salmon-4/](https://www.chewoutloud.com/grilled-teriyaki-salmon-4/)\n\n#"]}

Just slurp them into the mouth, use your tongue to crush them on the roof of the mouth and swallow. I prefer mine with a little shallot sauce (I forget the name) or a dab of cocktail sauce. My wife likes hers with hot sauce.\n\nThat said you may prefer trying BBQ oysters with garlic butter. I\u2019m not sure if you eat them in the same manner (without chewing). \n\nI think both ways are worth trying at least once, but you need to be in the mindset to try something new.

The passage is often quoted because it reflects his signature style: simple, direct language conveying complex emotion through physical experience.", "Hmmm... I feel like the easiest seafood to try if you generally do not enjoy seafood would be a very light, mild, flaky white fish that doesn't taste fishy at all.

But I\u2019m serious, an alcohol buzz can really make the difference in that first experience. Oysters and martinis are a great pairing!", "If you eat a raw one and basically just swallow it without chewing, they don't taste like much and are just briny.

A 30 qt pot is suitable for about 10 pounds of shrimp or a dozen blue crabs with corn and potatoes and other fixings.  It may take a little longer to boil water than a pro burner but it should be able to get the job done.  A seafood boil should be a fun drawn out experience.\n\nHere is the recipe:\n\n3-1/2 gallons of water  \n1 cup of salt  \n1/2 pound louisiana or zatarain's powdered crab boil\\*  \n12 oz louisiana or zatarain's liquid crab boil\\*  \n2 zatarain's crab boil season bags (or 1 cup pickling spices)\n\n\\*There are many other brands but these are the most available outside of the south\n\n3 lbs red potatoes  \n6 lemons  \n1 bunch of celery  \n2 yellow onions  \n4 bulbs of garlic (or as many as you like)\n\n10 pounds of head on shrimp\\*\\*  \nor 1 dozen live jumbo blue crabs (on ice)\n\n\\*\\* if you are using frozen shrimp defrost them in an ice water bath.\n\n4 ears of fresh shucked corn cut into thirds  \n1 pint of button mushrooms  \n1 lb of brussel sprouts  \n1 lb of smoked sausage cut into chunks  \n2 navel oranges\n\nDirections:\n\nVegetable Stock\n\nAdd 3-1/2 gallon water to 30 qt turkey fryer pot and place on high heat.  \nChop onions in half leaving root and top intact  \nSlice tops of garlic bulbs to reveal a small portion of the tops of the garlic cloves.  \nSlice the lemons in half for juicing.  \nChop bunch of celery into 1 to 2 inch segments. Leave about 2 inches of the root end intack.\n\nAdd season bags, potatoes, onion, garlic and celery to water.  \nSqueeze the lemon juice into the pot add rinds to pot.  \nAdd 1 cup of salt to water. The water should be very salty and taste like sea water.  \nAdd 12 oz liquid crab boil to water. Do not taste water after this step!  \nAdd 1/2 lb of dry crab boil and season bags.\n\nBoil stock for 15 minutes or until potatoes are tender but not mushy. Feel test is the best way. They should dent but not squish. Remove from heat and let stand or cook seafood immediately.\n\nBoiling the seafood\n\nBring the vegetable stock to a rolling boil. Strain the shrimp and drop them in the boiling water.  Stir on high heat until the shrimp float to the top of the pot.  When you see water and spices penetrating the shrimp shells beyond their heads its time to turn the fire off.  Everything in the pot should be trying to float right now. Give it a good stir and cover it.\n\nAdd the fresh vegatables \n\nAdd corn, mushrooms, sausage, sprouts and orange slices into the pot and stir well.  Cover and let everything soak.\n\nSoaking the seafood\n\nThe longer the seafood soaks, the spicier they will be. The best way to tell if everything is properly infused with spice is a mushroom taste test. The mushrooms will shrink to about half of their original size and will give a nice squirt of juice when bitten. When the desired spice level has been reached remove all ingredients from stock and place on warmed serving tray along with all the ingredients that have been resting\n\nNote: If the corn begins to pucker from dehydration it can be removed early and placed with potatoes and garlic to rest. Corn should have visible traces of dry seasoning in all the nooks and crannies. Don't judge the overall spice level by the corn, because corn will be absorb the most seasoning.", "A turkey fryer makes for a poor boil due to the lower energy output. Boiling water takes a lot of energy and you want a 100,000 or so BTU capable burner. Turkey fryer burners are maybe half that due to how oil and safety works for them. The lower energy of a turkey fryer burner will not get the water back up to a a boil fast enough after you put in the cold seafood.\n\nYou may get by with the smaller pot that you mention, but get a proper seafood boil burner and 80+ qt pot. Usually an 80 qt pot will meet most needs, but 100 or 120 qt pots will really work best."]}

{"title": "What\u2019s YOUR method for cooking shrimp for \u201ccocktail\u201d?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve settled on a method that results in shrimp I like, but wouldn\u2019t mind trying some new things.\n\nFor me I cook only shell on/EZ peel from fresh or thawed by putting the shrimp in seasoned OR unseasoned (depending on mood, audience) COLD/room temp water, covering the shrimp with about 1/2 inch to inch (5mm) of excess water. Put the burner on high and depending on the size of the shrimp (21/25 and larger) I\u2019ll cook until the water is just about to boil. I don\u2019t personally go by opaque flesh or time and rather just go by this method. Bigger shrimp I let go an extra 30 seconds. A strong boil is too long, but that period right before boil seems to work well. You know that moment when you\u2019re seeing a little steam coming off the top and there\u2019s a distinct sound that things are hot! Then Immediately put on ice and then in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Oh and I put in a freezer bag with paper towels to pulls excess moisture. \n\nFor seasoning sometimes it\u2019s just some salt, sometimes I like a little chicken bouillon. Not a lot, just for the touch of salty/sweet. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not suggesting this is some \u201cgreat method\u201d or \u201cbetter than\u201d [insert your method] but one thing it\u2019s good at is taking the guesswork out of whether something has had enough time or not. Sometimes when shell on it\u2019s a little difficult to tell especially with larger shrimp, for me anyway. This could help with someone who is consistently overcooking using a different method. A couple \u201cboil bubbles\u201d is fine too. You won\u2019t overdo it unless it reached hard/rolling boil. \n\nAnyway, what else can I try?

After all the fruit and vegetables sank to the bottom of the pot, I removed them from the water.   I filled an eight quart pot halfway with plain water and brought it to a rolling boil.  Before adding the shrimp I inserted a strainer basket in the pot.  I added about 2 pounds of head on shrimp to the boiling water and cooked them until the were floating and I could see water entering the shells behind the heads.  At that point I removed the pot from heat and strained out the shrimp.  The strained shrimp were then transferred to the seasoned water.  I did this in a few batches.

I would imagine urchin to have some flavor but not as much as shrimp, lobster, or crab. \n\nSometimes if water doesn\u2019t get enough flavor, you can use milk. The fat draws out more flavor compounds, the viscosity and fat coat your mouth making the flavor linger and feel more concentrated, and the milk flavor can act as a mild but well-known flavor that adds a sort of contrast that can bring out flavors more than water (you can test this with tiny amounts of matcha, herbs, etc. pretty interesting results and always different imo).\n\nI\u2019d recommend blending into milk and infusing on a fridge for a day or two (heat and uni just seem like enemies to me, I imagine heating breaks down flavor compounds) then straining.\n\nYou could also aerate it into a foam which will increase the aroma greatly as the bubbles pop. It does sacrifice some sense of flavor concentration, but it ups the aroma a lot. So this is good for bringing out delicate light notes, but not as good for a rich seafood stock idea.\n\nReally creative concept!

It was a great opening course, but somewhat feeble for a workingmen.\n\nA He-Stew is quite different, and Big Jimbo mumbled to himself as he prepared his version. \u201cFirst we takes a mess a bacon and fries it crisp.\u201d As he did this he smelled the aroma and satisfied himself that Steed\u2019s had sold him the best. As it sizzled he chopped eight large onions and two hefty stalks of celery, holding them back till the bacon was done. Deftly he whisked the bacon out and put it aside, tossing the vegetables into the hot oil to saute. Soon he withdrew them, too, placing them with the bacon. Then he tossed the forty eight oysters into the pan, browning them just a little to implant a flavor, then quickly he poured in the liquor from the oysters and allowed them to cook until their gills wrinkled.\n\nOther ships\u2019 cooks followed the recipe this far, but now Big Jimbo did the two things that made his he-stew unforgettable. From a precious package purchased from the McCormick Spice Company on the dock in Baltimore he produced first a canister of tapioca powder. \u201cBest thing ever invented for cooks,\u201d in his opinion. Taking a surprisingly small pinch of the whitish powder, he tossed it into the milk, which was about to simmer, and in a few minutes the moisture and the heat had expanded the finely ground tapioca powder into a very large translucent, gelatinous mass. When he was satisfied with the progress he poured the oysters into the milk, tossed in the vegetables, then crumbled the bacon between his fingers, throwing it on top.\n\nThe sturdy dish was almost ready, but not quite. From the McCormick Package he brought out a packet of saffron, which he dusted over the stew, giving it a golden richness, augmented by the half-pound of butter he threw in at the last moment.

That's why the seafood sub is so full of questions like is this okay to eat and half the comments will be telling people to throw perfectly fine stuff away\n\nIf I gave you a fish. You would just have to trust me that it's fine to eat. If you gave me a fish I would look at the eye to see if it's clear and fresh or cloudy/sunken in and older. Is the meat mushy or firm for this type of fish. Does it smell off? Is the natural colors turning? I would be able to tell what fish it is. That lets me know several things.\n\nIs it from a lake or the ocean. What part of the world is it from. Is it farmed or wild? What risks are associated with that fish. Salmon for example will most likely be Atlantic farmed. It's low on mercury compared to a tuna. How does that happen? Because metals accumulate in little fish and then the big fish eat the little fish and accumulate more. Certain types of fish might have ciguatera. What types of fish have that. Usually Caribbean reef fish.\n\nI'm kind of rambling but basically what I'm saying is, I feel confident eating a salmon because I know it's from a farm most likely in maritime Canadian waters. Following the food laws of the country. It is fed a mixture of antibiotics, soybean/sardine pellets, some vitamin derived from algae to make the meat orange and other micronutrients. If it's a frozen fillet of farmed Atlantic salmon then I know I could most likely eat it raw even if it's not sashimi rated because it's given dewormer in it's feed to minimize parasites. flash frozen and then stored frozen for a decent enough time that any parasites would most likely be dead. But I would never eat a wild salmon raw.\n\nSame with an oyster. I love it so much I flew to the coast, got a license and started harvesting oysters for fun. I know the waters I harvested from were right next to the oyster farm beds. They test the water frequently for bacteria and algae poisoning (there are recalls for oysters but a reputable monger will know) I've opened thousands of oysters. I know when the frills are sticking to the shells and it looks drained of water then the oyster is dead.\n\nPeople say don't eat the open oysters and yes that's true but closed oysters can also be dead. You can tell from the frills and water. I've gotten such an eye for it, that I would probably still eat an oyster I can tell died maybe a couple hours ago and was refrigerated while avoiding ones that are too far gone. I also wouldn't eat oysters in wet storage tanks common in Vancouver. If one has norovirus, they would all get contaminated in the tank water, (also the tank water makes it taste quite bland) Only dry storage oysters for me. \n\nI'm just vomiting information at this point but what I'm saying is, you just have to get good basically. Once you know what's good and what's bad, you will be more confident with what youre eating.\n\nThe good part is that the government does all the water testing for you. Reputable seafood will have a tag that will tell you who caught it, when was it caught. A reputable monger will always be able to provide it. On the other hand, I've shopped at some sketchyer Asian seafood markets in North America because they are cheaper, and they sometimes will do things like sell Black market poached geoduck clams for example.\n\nBut you cook a bag of mussels and you see 90% are plump and intact. Maybe 5% don't open (some are fine even if they dont open but if you're a noobie don't worry about that) . Maybe another 5% are open but the flesh is stretched out and sticking to the shell. Well there you go. You know which ones to not eat. It's a learning process. Just pick something you want to eat. And learn about it.\n\nAnd finally. You have to develop the nose for it. The top tier freshest seafood basically won't smell like anything. Maybe slightly sweet and salty. Then there is fish that smells a bit and is still fine to eat. But when you really shouldn't eat it, your nose will wrinkle and your body will know.\n\nAlso there's nothing wrong with most frozen seafoods. Shrimp for example, probably 95% of shrimp eaten in western countries are frozen from Asia or South America. Same with squid. Practically impossible to get never frozen squid. And there's not much drop in quality.\n\nClams and mussels, oysters, snails, crab, lobster it is very noticeable drop in taste when frozen but even that has been improving with flash freezing technology.\n\nDon't knock frozen seafood. Chefs that look down on frozen seafood in a blanket term are quite frankly ignorant. Probably 90% of fish eaten outside of developing countries were flash frozen on the boat or in the processing plant before shipping and then defrosted by the store. The never frozen stuff is pretty high-end expensive overnight air freight stuff.", "Easy.. Just eat and enjoy", "I'll tell you what my Doninatrix told me \"Eat it you pussy!\"", "Is extremely hard to simply \"get over\" something like this. It's an actual phobia. It's adjacent to people who have disgust for certain foods (not your case I understand). I don't think the seafood subreddit will help much but speaking to a therapist might. Good luck!", "I have eaten seafood and fish my whole life and so have my kids, none of us has gotten sick by using common sense and making sure our seafood comes from a good source.\n\nNow I have only known one person to ever get sick from oysters(my sisters ex), we were all on a trip and he got a bad one. He was fine by morning.\n\nThat being said look up exposure therapy.", "well, first off, don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re the only one feeling like this! I grew up on the New Jersey shore, literally just blocks away from the docks. We\u2019re fishing boats drop off the catch for the day or the week. there was literally almost nothing. They could pull out of the water that I wouldn\u2019t eat, maybe just not see cucumber. all kinds of clams, oysters from up and down the shore, you name it.\n\n  ever since I moved in land i\u2019ve become quite anxious about eating any kind of mollusk. The time out of water between the retailer and the fisherman and or farmer makes me very nervous. Even though most catches come with a tag I still get quite paranoid. about water quality from once they came. I loved both oysters and clams raw and now won\u2019t touch either, especially during the summer when bacteria levels seem to be high. also, now being over 60 throws in a little added twist to the game.\n\n   all this is to say that I have yet to figure out how to get over my anxiety, I could live on seafood alone and hate the anxiety over eating mollusks. All I can do is buy from his reliable source as I can, try to buy them as freshly as I can. and know everything about handling and storage there\u2019s always gonna be a risk but such as life.", "Simple.

Dead crabs will start degrading within a workday. If they're chilled the whole time it won't necessarily be dangerous (I've eaten some pretty long dead crabs from buffets and been fine but you can taste that they were dead). Crabs do go into hibernation when refrigerated for a while so they might seem dead. And if you put it in the back by the vent they could possibly partially freeze and that will also kill them.\n\nI would steam them instead of boil. It preserves the flavour better. 12 minutes for a single crab. Maybe 14 - 15 if you're doing a batch of 4 in a wok.\n\nIf they're steamed or boiled, you can not worry about them being good two days from now. I would only say keep them covered if you can because the fridge does dry it out a bit. Nothing beats freshly steamed but it will still be probably 95% as good.\n\nI don't want to make the judgement for you because it does take a bit of an eye. But the safest option while optimizing for taste would be to cook them all tonight and then refrigerate them. But wait till you're reheating them in sauce before cracking the shells to minimize drying out.", "Assuming you are serving them for cocktail I\u2019d cook and ice bath once you arrive at your destination.

You can either serve them chilled, briefly steam to reheat. Or reheat them by saut\u00e9ing in garlic butter. \n\nFor storage. In a cooler, with the *drain open*. Over a bed of ice. You can put layers of news paper or towels on top of the ice, under the crabs, and cover the crabs with the same.\n\nYou do not want them sitting in standing water, they will suffocate. And you need to keep them very cold, and moist/humid.\n\nThey'll likely last a few days like this, and if they are not stored this way while driving. Like say if they're just in a plastic bag from the store, they may expire on the drive. Though they should be OK for a while. If that's all you've got, poke holes in any plastic bag they're in so they don't sit in any collected water."]}

No worries, you can still do it but not like you would in Louisiana.  \n\nMy biggest concern is the crawfish.  You said you already bought them.  If they are not frozen then they will not last until christmas.  It the shells are brown, blue, or grey they have not been cooked. Red shells mean they are at least partially cooked. Pink shells mean to toss them.  If they have been shelled they have been cooked but not what is typically boiled.\n\nThe other problem that you are facing is that you have all sorts of seafood in various stages of preservation and preparation.   Assuming you want a spicy seafood boil it's best to break up the cooking into two parts.  The first part is a spicy broth to soak the seafood.  The second part is whatever is the best way to cook the various seafood that you have.  You are going to need two large pots.  The larger will be for spice the smaller will be for poaching the seafood.\n\nFill the larger pot halfway with water and put it on high heat, best if you can do this outside.  In this pot we are going to make a court bouillon of onion, celery, garlic, lemon, spices, and salt.  Cut 2 or 3 onions in half leaving the top on one side and the root on the other.  Cut a half bunch of celery into 1 inch chunks.  Slice the tops off the garlic bulbs leaving just a little bit of the cloves exposed.  Leave the papery layers of the garlic intact.  Cut lemons in half and squeeze juices into the pot.  Add the rinds to the pot.  Add the veggies to the pot. Heavily salt the water and taste.  Add about 4 oz of liquid crab boil, and about a half pound of dry crab boil. DO NOT taste.  Add potatoes and bring to a boil.  When the potatoes are soft on the outside remove for heat and set aside.  If cooking outside you can bring this pot inside and place on your stove.\n\nFor everything else you want to poach it in salted boiling water and then allow it to soak in the spicy water. Fill the smaller pot halfway with water and a small amount of salt and bring to a rolling boil.  Make sure the boil is rolling before adding seafood.\n\nPoach everything separately so that it will have its own cook time. Start with the stuff that will take the most time to cook like the lobster.  As each batch is cooked and add it to the spice, which is not on heat.  Return the water to a boil and then do the next item.  In clear water it will be easy to tell when an item is cooked.\n\nFresh corn is the best and can be tossed directly into the soaking pot after the potaoes are done.  But if the corn is frozen then you want to add it last.  Frozen corn has a tendency to pucker and not be very enjoyable.    I would cook frozen corn to the directions and add to the broth last.\n\nDo NOT brown smoked sausage.  Cut into 1 inch chunks straight across, not on a bias.  Add them to the soaking water and they will swell into weird little shapes. \n\nAllow everything to soak for at least half an hour.  I would go an hour and half for a real spicy meal.  The seafood will not overcook because it is not cooking, it's soaking!  When the seafood sinks to the bottom of the pot its ready to eat.\n\ngood luck", "From what I read thawed lobster tails take 5 min to boil if they're 5-6oz\nCrawfish scallops n shrimp all say 2-3 min"]}
