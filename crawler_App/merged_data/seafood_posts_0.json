They were the sweetest, creamiest, most cucumbery-melon (same smell to me) oysters I\u2019ve had and the aroma was pleasantly intense when I was shucking them. \n\nCooking them was a different story\u2014the remainder of the batch I steamed then drizzled on a Thai seafood sauce but they were so bitter I couldn\u2019t eat them.

Should oysters arrive cold, and what should I be looking out for to make sure they\u2019re safe to eat?\n\nThanks for any advice!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sksw01qaf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4eca929713cb2832e535d11037d7047baee77463\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4szc1qaf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f574760983a9c9c9da6c6836fd9bedb470e61087\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyrpc5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f452b70c06cf77496d9414a242def0ca5adf623\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0hb0j5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3afe8ebda971e3c9b9689725cb0278b1be01ecb3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i7fds5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e86464afb7420ae42d1bbb11e4347a2dcd6368fd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c24ia6paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f5c96782199975daad1652f4f6ae6614d92d47b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xs9k5paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d66a2f6754e319782c6d95bf267da6b3974ce268\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zz6lb6paf2gd1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b0003ca18825a85e3d6f488772370457b317711\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ehijqb/video/ycrlk36bf2gd1/player\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Seafood/comments/1ehijqb/oysters_delivered_warm_should_i_be_worried/", "created_utc": 1722523705.0, "score": 309, "author": "saslas22", "num_comments": 167, "permalink": "/r/Seafood/comments/1ehijqb/oysters_delivered_warm_should_i_be_worried/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "Live lobster buying tip", "selftext": "As we approach the upcoming summer season, here\u2019s a tip for those that may be buying live lobster from a market/grocery store tank. \n\nLook at the \u201cantenna\u201d length. While not 100% foolproof, look for tanks with lobsters that still have their antenna intact. \n\nLobsters will be cannibalistic if necessary. However, given lobsters are banded inside these tanks they don\u2019t stand a chance getting a meal except for the softest and most accessible bit - the antenna. Lobsters in tanks with short, stubbed, antenna have likely been in that tank a long while and have gotten to each others antenna for some semblance of food. \n\nI personally will not buy live lobsters with clear signs of this long tank holding cannibalism. \n\nOf course it\u2019s also very important that when the fish monger retrieves a lobster from a tank that they display alertness and strength by raising their arms up and out and arch their backs. If a lobster comes out barely moving and its arms droop and dangle it\u2019s a sign of a weak, dying or even dead lobster. Don\u2019t accept it and come back another time or find a better market!\n\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/tq3y286n0hrc1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1711804162.0, "score": 273, "author": "jebbanagea", "num_comments": 58, "permalink": "/r/Seafood/comments/1brhid7/live_lobster_buying_tip/", "html_title": ""}

I felt real bad. \n\nAnyways, after some blanching. I used a tooth brush to scrub off the dark stuff off the abalone. Chinese people often think the stuff is dirt but in fact it\u2019s the actual skin\n\nI topped some ginger and scallions and steamed for 8 minutes.

As I watched a few more videos, I found that there was no consensus, some people said pull the beard away from the hinge, others said pull it towards the hinge.\n\nOne thing I found though, is that no one said why you had to do it the way they said you had to do it.

Here are few things I'm looking to do:\n\n* Sourcing and highlighting more local species from the Mid-Atlantic, especially Virginia waters\n* Making access to quality seafood easier for those outside of affluent neighborhoods\n* Shortening the supply chain and passing savings onto consumers\n* Experimenting with fish butchery to offer new and exciting seafood products\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who loves seafood, wants to cook more of it, or has struggled to find good local options, I\u2019d love to hear from you! What challenges do you face when buying seafood? What would make it easier or more appealing? \n\nI promise this is not some weird sales pitch, but I'm reaching out to this community because I believe you can provide valuable feedback.

I bought a stick of unsalted butter and have a basic recipe to make it but I have a few questions first.\n\nA lot of the recipes I have seen call for a brushing of butter and spices before cooking.  I was thinking of a mix of Old Bay and garlic.  Can I use the calcified butter for this mixture and just add the spices I need?  If so, can I season the whole mixture and use the remaining as the butter dipping sauce or is it better to leave it as is?\n\nI was hoping to cook the clusters in my air fryer but they are a little bit too big to fit. Am I able cut them at the joints or is this a bad idea?\n\nThank you for any help you can offer!\n\n  \nCheers!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Seafood/comments/1inzq2o/clarified_butter_question/", "created_utc": 1739389305.0, "score": 1, "author": "Nefariousierra", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/Seafood/comments/1inzq2o/clarified_butter_question/", "html_title": ""}

Put the burner on high and depending on the size of the shrimp (21/25 and larger) I\u2019ll cook until the water is just about to boil. I don\u2019t personally go by opaque flesh or time and rather just go by this method. Bigger shrimp I let go an extra 30 seconds. A strong boil is too long, but that period right before boil seems to work well. You know that moment when you\u2019re seeing a little steam coming off the top and there\u2019s a distinct sound that things are hot! Then Immediately put on ice and then in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Oh and I put in a freezer bag with paper towels to pulls excess moisture. \n\nFor seasoning sometimes it\u2019s just some salt, sometimes I like a little chicken bouillon. Not a lot, just for the touch of salty/sweet. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not suggesting this is some \u201cgreat method\u201d or \u201cbetter than\u201d [insert your method] but one thing it\u2019s good at is taking the guesswork out of whether something has had enough time or not. Sometimes when shell on it\u2019s a little difficult to tell especially with larger shrimp, for me anyway. This could help with someone who is consistently overcooking using a different method. A couple \u201cboil bubbles\u201d is fine too. You won\u2019t overdo it unless it reached hard/rolling boil. \n\nAnyway, what else can I try?

{"title": "Debearding mussels, best technique and why?", "selftext": "So, I Googled how to debeard mussels. The first three videos that came back all gave three very different techniques that you \"must\" use - one said pull the beard along the edge of the shell away from the hinge, another said pull the beard along the edge of the shell towards the hinge, and a third said pull the beard directly away from the shell. As I watched a few more videos, I found that there was no consensus, some people said pull the beard away from the hinge, others said pull it towards the hinge.\n\nOne thing I found though, is that no one said why you had to do it the way they said you had to do it. All they said is \"you must do it this way\". Is there any reason to use one technique over another? Is it just about what works for you? Does it make any difference to the mussel itself?

I was thinking of a mix of Old Bay and garlic.  Can I use the calcified butter for this mixture and just add the spices I need?  If so, can I season the whole mixture and use the remaining as the butter dipping sauce or is it better to leave it as is?\n\nI was hoping to cook the clusters in my air fryer but they are a little bit too big to fit.

{"title": "What\u2019s YOUR method for cooking shrimp for \u201ccocktail\u201d?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve settled on a method that results in shrimp I like, but wouldn\u2019t mind trying some new things.\n\nFor me I cook only shell on/EZ peel from fresh or thawed by putting the shrimp in seasoned OR unseasoned (depending on mood, audience) COLD/room temp water, covering the shrimp with about 1/2 inch to inch (5mm) of excess water. Put the burner on high and depending on the size of the shrimp (21/25 and larger) I\u2019ll cook until the water is just about to boil. I don\u2019t personally go by opaque flesh or time and rather just go by this method. Bigger shrimp I let go an extra 30 seconds. A strong boil is too long, but that period right before boil seems to work well. You know that moment when you\u2019re seeing a little steam coming off the top and there\u2019s a distinct sound that things are hot! Then Immediately put on ice and then in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Oh and I put in a freezer bag with paper towels to pulls excess moisture. \n\nFor seasoning sometimes it\u2019s just some salt, sometimes I like a little chicken bouillon. Not a lot, just for the touch of salty/sweet. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not suggesting this is some \u201cgreat method\u201d or \u201cbetter than\u201d [insert your method] but one thing it\u2019s good at is taking the guesswork out of whether something has had enough time or not. Sometimes when shell on it\u2019s a little difficult to tell especially with larger shrimp, for me anyway. This could help with someone who is consistently overcooking using a different method. A couple \u201cboil bubbles\u201d is fine too. You won\u2019t overdo it unless it reached hard/rolling boil. \n\nAnyway, what else can I try?

About 30 mins later, my head started pounding and I knew I ate something bad, because I had this same feeling in the past when I ate crap. I instantly knew it was Tilapia. I called the restaurant to ask what kind of fish it was, and they said Tilapia.   \n  \nThey are also fed feces, GMO soybeans, Genetically modified corn, chicken and animal byproducts, pig and goose manure, pesticides and antibiotics, gross stuff. Not to mention the tap water ice from Vietnam that is loaded with salmonella and other bacteria.\n\nNot to mention, these overcrowded fish tank fish filled with chemicals live miserable lives in those tubs.\n\nIf you don't live near the ocean with access to fresh fish, then opt for frozen fish. Hit trader Joe's or Whole Foods for a piece of cod.\n\nStay away from gross fish tank \"Seafood\".", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Seafood/comments/1hvkgud/reminder_that_farm_raised_seafood_is_so_bad_for/", "created_utc": 1736227928.0, "score": 0, "author": "Intrepid_Reason8906", "num_comments": 27, "permalink": "/r/Seafood/comments/1hvkgud/reminder_that_farm_raised_seafood_is_so_bad_for/", "html_title": ""}
