Before I get slammed I can\u2019t have any actual grill or offset smoker because I live in a condo and it\u2019s illegal per fire code to have an open flame cooking device. The community has reported it on residents and it is very strictly enforced.

No way do I believe that, so to be safe I plan on removing the bone and splitting the shoulder into two roasts. I can smoke one tomorrow and when my rubs come in Tuesday I\u2019ll smoke the other half while working from home.\n\nCurrent plan is to remove the bone and split it perpendicular to the side with the bone to make the most consistent sized roasts between the two cuts that I can make.

{"title": "Update: The London Broil that spent a week in the fridge.", "selftext": "I have learned a valuable lesson this week, well maybe a couple. \n\n1. If you ask a question on Reddit, make sure you give the people all the information. \n\nThe reason I came here and asked if the meat was okay, was because I don\u2019t have a very strong sense of smell. I had my nose cauterized as a child, and since then I can really only smell artificially scented things. Someone mentioned that bad mean has a sulphur scent, which is the one thing I specifically cannot smell at all. Yes that means no farts, no propane, no rotten eggs, and skunk has to be fresh, otherwise I cannot smell it either. (I promise you your special brand of fart isn\u2019t gonna be the one that breaks the barrier, many people have tried). I\u2019m not going to lie it\u2019s pretty nice not smelling farts, but not being able to grill alone kinda sucks. \n\n2. Wet Aging. \n\nThank you u/slackerwithgoals for enlightening me to the world of wet aging, and that under the right circumstances you can go much longer than a week. \n\nP.s you were right, I should have waited longer.  Next time I\u2019m going to try two weeks. \n\n3. Sous Vide tips\n\nAlso shout out u/smakdye for sharing your wisdom. Now if only next time I listen a little better, and not take it out at 5.5 hours\u2026 the 4 year old demanded food, and I started the process a little late. (It was ever so slightly dry, I assume that\u2019s from too little in its hot tub, I also usually put butter in with steaks but see point below for why I forgot) \n\n4. ADHD and pieces of meat like this don\u2019t mix super well. \n\nI originally posted this on Monday, then life happened and I didn\u2019t get to cooking it until today. I meant to put it in at 9am so it could go the full 8 hours recommended by Smakdye, but then life happened again and it didn\u2019t go in until 12:30 ish, and came out of the hot tub at 6:10pm. The small human was not happy that dinner was significantly later, but I got a \u201cgood turkey mommy\u201d out of him, so we\u2019ll call it a dinner win. \n\nLastly, I already knew this so it won\u2019t be on the list, but I\u2019m a girl. Not that it matters, just putting it out there so I don\u2019t get called a he again. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented with help, or a good laugh. This has been a fun journey.

I like to eat my steaks medium rare, so I\u2019d like to be sure I\u2019m buying a cow with the same level of safety as if I\u2019d purchased beef from Costco.  If yall got any advice on what exactly to ask the rancher that\u2019d be great as well.

Oh no! Well fear not. That's because of grading. It's been a smoky subject on categorizing meat and communication between consumer and producer is unclear. Some grass fed meats have been found not having been fed grass at all (thanks corporate legal teams) or only ate grass at the last months of growth before butchering.

{"title": "Buying Used: Elbow Grease vs Overhaul", "selftext": "Hello all!  New to this sub.  I enjoy doing up meats (and even veggies) on my pellet grill, and do so rather frequently.  Most typically it's things like chicken, ribs, burgers, etc.  But I do my fair share of larger cuts, such as brisket and lamb.  I also occasionally do homemade bacon--well, more accurately, I've recently started to get into this.\n\nSo i'm looking at buying a meat slicer.  My normal tendency is to go with used: will allow me to jump to that next level of quality.  Locally there is a used Globe up for sale.  The Amazon pic they've used as a reference is of a G12, but they indicate that the 'image shown is smaller model', so i'm trying to confirm what that means, what model is actually for sale.  They've included a pic in the ad, but I can't tell from looking.  They are asking $400.\n\nThe pic of the slicer for sale looks rather rough--dull and kind of 'patina-ed' where the sliced meat collects, and discolored (darkish) elsewhere.  There are also signs of what appear to be vertical drip marks (stains?) and splatter on the vertical surface behind the blade. But it's not a great pic, so it's difficult to know what's going on.\n\nMy question (finally!) is what constitutes a need for just some good ol' elbow grease (will happily do) versus the need to bring this into a professional for a complete overhaul (deal breaker)?  I have fundamental mechanical skills, as in I can take things apart, do some basic analysis, clean, possibly adjust, and put it all back together again.

{"title": "How to combat the gristle in liver ", "selftext": "Times are tough. I feel like I remember things like flank and skirt being cheap. Fucking BONE MARROW used to be cheap (edit: ten years ago big name markets would give it to me for free). One of the last common vestiges seems to be liver in my area. I want to learn how to better like/utilize liver. \n\nI bought beef liver from Safeway. It came frozen in slices. The package claimed it was deveined and that it's membrane was taken off. I did the usual soaking in milk before searing and eating. It did remind me a lot of foie gras.....as if....foie gras is like the \"crazy waygu\" of liver or something......but a few issues....\n\nFirst....each of these slices were surrounded their edges by what seemed like a membrane, a thin white ish tissue that pulled off.....that's a fuckin membrane right? Am I to think that liver has multiple membranes and Safeway is selling liver that has the greater membrane taken off or is this a false sale of goods? Secondly, there was a gristle nature in some of the bites and it somewhat corresponded to the holes I could see in the slices.....presumably this is where the veins used to be. My question is....if a liver is deveined....should there be zero gristle? Or like.....is the gristle I am perceiving probably just the integral part of the liver that is left behind when a vein is removed? I understand that veins and arteries are probably gristly as all hell, but I also wouldn't be surprised if, in general, tissues that immediately surround veins and arteries are also somewhat gristly.......like...the transition from vein to \"pure liver tissue\" is a gradation of gristle to less gristle. \n\nAm I thinking about this right? Does is seem like this liver didn't actually have the membrane removed? And is the moderate gristle throughout something that deveining isn't sufficient to remove?\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/1hsd4yu/how_to_combat_the_gristle_in_liver/", "created_utc": 1735875425.0, "score": 2, "author": "ozzalot", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/meat/comments/1hsd4yu/how_to_combat_the_gristle_in_liver/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

We got 6 pieces total for about 20 bucks and I'm pretty sure these aren't steaks lol so I'm going to go buy some real steaks to surprise my husband tomorrow, but I'd like to know what these are, so that maybe I can cook them today and freeze the meals I make for the future?

Before I get slammed I can\u2019t have any actual grill or offset smoker because I live in a condo and it\u2019s illegal per fire code to have an open flame cooking device.

No way do I believe that, so to be safe I plan on removing the bone and splitting the shoulder into two roasts. I can smoke one tomorrow and when my rubs come in Tuesday I\u2019ll smoke the other half while working from home.\n\nCurrent plan is to remove the bone and split it perpendicular to the side with the bone to make the most consistent sized roasts between the two cuts that I can make.

If you ask a question on Reddit, make sure you give the people all the information. \n\nThe reason I came here and asked if the meat was okay, was because I don\u2019t have a very strong sense of smell. I had my nose cauterized as a child, and since then I can really only smell artificially scented things. Someone mentioned that bad mean has a sulphur scent, which is the one thing I specifically cannot smell at all. Yes that means no farts, no propane, no rotten eggs, and skunk has to be fresh, otherwise I cannot smell it either. (I promise you your special brand of fart isn\u2019t gonna be the one that breaks the barrier, many people have tried). I\u2019m not going to lie it\u2019s pretty nice not smelling farts, but not being able to grill alone kinda sucks. \n\n2. Wet Aging. \n\nThank you u/slackerwithgoals for enlightening me to the world of wet aging, and that under the right circumstances you can go much longer than a week. \n\nP.s you were right, I should have waited longer.  Next time I\u2019m going to try two weeks. \n\n3. Sous Vide tips\n\nAlso shout out u/smakdye for sharing your wisdom. Now if only next time I listen a little better, and not take it out at 5.5 hours\u2026 the 4 year old demanded food, and I started the process a little late. (It was ever so slightly dry, I assume that\u2019s from too little in its hot tub, I also usually put butter in with steaks but see point below for why I forgot) \n\n4. ADHD and pieces of meat like this don\u2019t mix super well. \n\nI originally posted this on Monday, then life happened and I didn\u2019t get to cooking it until today. I meant to put it in at 9am so it could go the full 8 hours recommended by Smakdye, but then life happened again and it didn\u2019t go in until 12:30 ish, and came out of the hot tub at 6:10pm. The small human was not happy that dinner was significantly later, but I got a \u201cgood turkey mommy\u201d out of him, so we\u2019ll call it a dinner win. \n\nLastly, I already knew this so it won\u2019t be on the list, but I\u2019m a girl. Not that it matters, just putting it out there so I don\u2019t get called a he again. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented with help, or a good laugh. This has been a fun journey.

{"title": "Butcher Molested my Ground Pork", "selftext": "So this guy is known for being a terrible butcher. I've found plastic wrap strips inside of my ground beef, the beef steaks smell rotten and like wild game when you thaw them from frozen, the cuts look like he used baby scissors and lost. I have endless examples. My in-laws decided to go to him anyway and buy half a pig. I'm asking you guys if you could please tell me what this guy did to this ground pork. I have my suspicions but I want to hear it from you. If I have evidence this guy is messing with our meat, I'm confronting him, but I need your expertise to diagnose this mess. \n\nGround Pork Symptoms\n\n* the exterior is dark blue, almost black and with a small bit of white and green (mold? definitely mold right?) and the interior is pink like NORMAL\n* When you bite into the cooked sausage (that doesn't have mold in it) there's these little chunks of white that you can't chew it's just hard like gummy pebbles.\n* It tastes like sage, overwhelming so. (not supposed to be seasoned)\n* It also tastes like ham, but there's a nuance to it. It's like a mix of ham and something INCREDIBLY gamey. I had deer meat from a very old buck before and it was reminiscent of that.\n* I cooked this sausage in a skillet (ruined the seasoning, had to strip the whole thing) and then added the meat to a stock to make soup. INSTANTLY this onslaught of speckled black and grey matter came to the surface and a thick film covered the top of the pot and I could pick it up with my fingers like it was wet paper.\n\nTHE BUTCHER MOLESTED MY PIG AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE DID!

{"title": "Buying Used: Elbow Grease vs Overhaul", "selftext": "Hello all!  New to this sub.  I enjoy doing up meats (and even veggies) on my pellet grill, and do so rather frequently.  Most typically it's things like chicken, ribs, burgers, etc.  But I do my fair share of larger cuts, such as brisket and lamb.  I also occasionally do homemade bacon--well, more accurately, I've recently started to get into this.\n\nSo i'm looking at buying a meat slicer.  My normal tendency is to go with used: will allow me to jump to that next level of quality.  Locally there is a used Globe up for sale.  The Amazon pic they've used as a reference is of a G12, but they indicate that the 'image shown is smaller model', so i'm trying to confirm what that means, what model is actually for sale.  They've included a pic in the ad, but I can't tell from looking.  They are asking $400.\n\nThe pic of the slicer for sale looks rather rough--dull and kind of 'patina-ed' where the sliced meat collects, and discolored (darkish) elsewhere.  There are also signs of what appear to be vertical drip marks (stains?) and splatter on the vertical surface behind the blade. But it's not a great pic, so it's difficult to know what's going on.\n\nMy question (finally!) is what constitutes a need for just some good ol' elbow grease (will happily do) versus the need to bring this into a professional for a complete overhaul (deal breaker)?  I have fundamental mechanical skills, as in I can take things apart, do some basic analysis, clean, possibly adjust, and put it all back together again.  But I am not rebuilding any motors, that's for sure.  What should I be looking for?  Obviously, I would ask to fire it up and have a quick go at it, but what else/how else might I be trying to test or inspect?\n\nThank you in advance, not only for any advice, but for also reading this small novella!\n\nTL;DR: Want to buy used meat slicer that looks rough.

{"title": "Where do you buy meat?", "selftext": "My wife and I have gradually been trying to buy better quality meat over the last year or two. We started with eggs, then with chicken, and are now looking to upgrade all of our meat purchases. I have been shopping at Winco (a cheaper regional grocery store) for years. Since covid, it seems like their meat quality has slightly decreased, especially beef. Over the last two years especially, it seems to have gotten worse. I used to get steaks and roasts from them that were really good and now I get ones that are just ok. My kids and I went to several different grocery stores to scope out meat prices/quality over the last week including Kroger, Sprouts, Harmons (a local upscale grocery store), and a few butcher shops. It felt like Kroger was an overpriced Winco. The butcher shops both seemed good, but obviously pricier. Harmons seemed like a good mix where most stuff was cheaper than the butcher shops but much better quality than the others. I am curious if you guys have any recommendations. Some people have recommended buying a cow/pork share from a farm, but that feels like a large investment and I don't know how good the meat is.\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/1huqsh1/where_do_you_buy_meat/", "created_utc": 1736137734.0, "score": 2, "author": "theberry10", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/meat/comments/1huqsh1/where_do_you_buy_meat/", "html_title": "Reddit - Prove your humanity"}

{"title": "How to combat the gristle in liver ", "selftext": "Times are tough. I feel like I remember things like flank and skirt being cheap. Fucking BONE MARROW used to be cheap (edit: ten years ago big name markets would give it to me for free). One of the last common vestiges seems to be liver in my area. I want to learn how to better like/utilize liver. \n\nI bought beef liver from Safeway. It came frozen in slices. The package claimed it was deveined and that it's membrane was taken off. I did the usual soaking in milk before searing and eating. It did remind me a lot of foie gras.....as if....foie gras is like the \"crazy waygu\" of liver or something......but a few issues....\n\nFirst....each of these slices were surrounded their edges by what seemed like a membrane, a thin white ish tissue that pulled off.....that's a fuckin membrane right? Am I to think that liver has multiple membranes and Safeway is selling liver that has the greater membrane taken off or is this a false sale of goods? Secondly, there was a gristle nature in some of the bites and it somewhat corresponded to the holes I could see in the slices.....presumably this is where the veins used to be. My question is....if a liver is deveined....should there be zero gristle? Or like.....is the gristle I am perceiving probably just the integral part of the liver that is left behind when a vein is removed? I understand that veins and arteries are probably gristly as all hell, but I also wouldn't be surprised if, in general, tissues that immediately surround veins and arteries are also somewhat gristly.......like...the transition from vein to \"pure liver tissue\" is a gradation of gristle to less gristle. \n\nAm I thinking about this right? Does is seem like this liver didn't actually have the membrane removed?

I reduced the heat to 165\u00b0c and cooked for another 80mins.\nI rested it for 20 mins and then served.

The dogs got most  of this one.\n\nI'm no expert on cooking or on meat.
