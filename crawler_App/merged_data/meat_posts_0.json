That being said, I\u2019d take the chance and marinade the hell out of it and make fajitas.", "This is not lab meat or 3d printed meat. There's a few reasons it could look like this:\n\n\n\n1) It could be scar tissue known as muscular steatosis or colloquially \"calloused eye\". It happens in cattle pretty regularly and there are tons of posts on the sub asking about similar products. The scar tissue looks like high marbling but it's a lie to make you sad when you get home and try to eat it.  \n\n---\n\n2) It could be high Choice grade even Prime grade. Sometimes packers have low demand and high supply on certain Prime cuts. A lot of times the case labels will say something like \"USDA CHOICE OR HIGHER\" and the vendor gets lucky and pays Choice cost for Prime product. The cryovac bags often specify what grade the product is and there's a noticeable difference in the meat itself. I have seen this happen with Eye of Round, Flank, Chuck Tenders, Top and Bottom Round.  \n\n---\n\n3) This particular vendor buys kinda whatever they can get. During Christmas they ran all their grades of rib roast under one sales PLU, whether they were Choice, Select or Ungraded. The reason this matters is because of the Ungraded options. Ungraded is literally a roll of the dice, it's been inspected for wholesomeness to consume but not graded by a USDA employed and certified grader. Because it hasn't been graded it's less expensive *but* there's also no telling on the quality. Ungraded meat typically comes from retired dairy cattle, retired breeding bulls, other species of cattle that are generally not purpose bred for protein. Sometimes these cuts come in looking like high Prime grade, other times they are Utility grade in regards to their fat content.  \n\n---\n\nIn all likelihood, this was either muscular steatosis or a Prime flank in a Choice box, with my money on the steatosis.", "\n\nThat looks insane!  I would have  bought it. \n\nThough, I've not seen steatosis in the flank before it has me wondering... Since the flank usually isn't very fatty  and if it is, certainly not this well (unless wagyu really..)\n\nDid you buy it?\n \n If you did can we see a side view? With a small slice maybe? \n\nI'd buy it because I'm a degenerate who loves the gamble and that looks like the best flank I've ever seen. Also because this peaks my interest even if it is steatosis, I'd love to take a closer look. \n\nThanks for posting this is cool.", "Is this 3d printed?", "Sir that's a zebra", "Yikes! Stripes!

I'm a huge meat eater, but realistically, our diets should be more vegetable and fruit heavy than what the typical US diet consist of, both for health and environmental reasons. Most kids have qualms eating veggies especially, which is why you see a lot of books encouraging vegetable consumption.\n\nWhat would be cool is to have a book explaining that animals are sacrificed for us to have meat, and that we should be grateful and respectful to have it.

But we also quite often visit our family farm to see animals - cows, sheep, goats, rabbits, chickens etc. She loves to pet them and help taking care of them.

I started thinking like a parent and paying attention to what messages were being sent to my daughter through kid's media. As someone who loves to eat meat and believes it is an optimal source of nutrition, I quickly noticed that meat was conspicuously absent from kid's books, music, and television.\n\nSociety seems to be going in this weird anti-meat direction, especially when it comes to kids. I don't think it helps to just site around and bitch about it, so I decided to do something. I created a kid's book that encourages kids to eat meat.\n\nThe book is titled, *My Favorite Food to Eat is Meat!* The story follows a little girl going through her day as she eats a lot of her favorite food: meat.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the book, here's some links:\n\n* Preview the book and more on my website: [myfavoritefoodismeat.com](https://myfavoritefoodismeat.com)\n* [Download the eBook for free](https://myfavoritefoodismeat.com/ebook) (just type $0 when it asks you how much you'd like to pay)\n* [Buy a physical copy on Lulu.com](https://myfavoritefoodismeat.com/lulu)\n\nMy hope is that this is just the start.

He went into the kitchen, opened the oven door... and there was the WHOLE LAMB curled inside upon a large aluminum roasting pan!!! He pulled it out and said it needs a little more time, almost ready. He pulled apart the ribs and the cavity was filled with rice, nuts, herbs and raisins. Wow... that was impressive. He reached into his cupboard and took out a large bottle of spice. It's needs more of this, he said. As he sprinkled it, I realized it was saffron. I imagine he put about $100.00 worth of it on there. He managed to accomplish roasting the lamb in his oven by tucking the front and rear legs tightly together, tied with strong string, and curling it up. It was delicious and easily fed the 30 or so people attending. You just need to hang it in a cool place for a couple of days until it thaws and then it can be curled up.

It takes usually 3 hours to cook completely. \n\nYou can also do it pretty easily with just some charcoal and sheet metal to help keep the heat in. Be sure to have enough airflow and don't have the fire directly under the lamb. It'll be too hot and you'll get too much of a smoke flavor as well.\n\nHere's a pick of my dad's setup. We didn't pre-heat the bricks here, so just the fire underneath.

Cut the rind in squares, then salt it generously. Cut up some vegetable you have left, I used a carrot, leak and some yellow onions (with the skin for extra color!). Put everything in a roast dish and cover it with beef stock so that the rind remains dry.\n\nCook it in the oven without a lid at 290 F for about 3 hours. It's ready when you can easily remove some meat with just a fork. If you can't, it needs to stay in a little longer. Take it out, drain the liquid and put the liquid in another pot. Bring to a boil and add some cornstarch to thicken it. Season with salt.\n\nPut the meat in the oven again and braise it at 480 degrees for another 5 to 10 minutes to make the crackling pop.", "That looks fucking incredible", "Sch\u00e4ufele und Klo\u00df!!

Where-as bacon can be derived from the belly and is cured and sometimes smoked.\n\nIs MasterClass right for me?\n\nTake this quiz to find out.\n\nFOOD Pork Belly vs. Bacon: Differences Between the Pork Cuts Written by MasterClass\n\nLast updated: Oct 29, 2021 \u2022 3 min read\n\nFrom pork chops to pancetta, cuts of pork are popular ingredients in the kitchen. Pork belly and bacon are two grocery store offerings that are easy to confuse at first glance.\n\nLearn From the Best\n\nThis is not bacon in any sense of the word. Bacon is cured and smoked.\n\nGrocery stores typically sell pork belly in large slabs or cut in long, inch-thick strips. Home cooks may oven-roast or fry large pieces of pork belly to eat as an entr\u00e9e or fry cubed pieces to add to vegetable or pasta dishes. The cut is especially common in Asian cuisines, often as a key ingredient in ramen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15ww6nzxabea1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53d581261ba811749b36aa3578e8b018d67f7d8c\n\nWhich Part of the Pig Does Pork Belly Come From? Pork belly cuts come from the underside of a domesticated pig, along the ventral line. As the butcher works up along the sides of a pig\u2019s belly, they\u2019ll remove the loins and spare ribs, then the remaining meat in the bottom portion of the area, known as pork belly.\n\nWhat Is Bacon?\n\nBacon is a type of thin-cut pork belly that has undergone curing and smoking (typically over wood like applewood or hickory). Curing is a preservation process that involves rubbing bacon in a mixture of salt, nitrates, and nitrites to preserve the meat and impart its characteristic pink color.\n\nMost North American grocery stores sell cured and uncured bacon. Contrary to its name, producers cure uncured bacon through natural nitrate sources like celery powder or sea salt.\n\nI have worked with similar slicers, Bizerbas, that are totally under the users control, stacking, weighing."]}

I recommend 6 hours. This is to let the salt penetrate through the fat. Never leave waygu at room temp because the fat will melt. This is meant for higher grade of waygu such as A5 grade. When you cook it, you want to aim for medium well. You don\u2019t want to undercook it due to the fat content, and you don\u2019t want to overdo it as it can still be dry. Cooking a well done takes hours on low heat, and there is a fine like between well done and leather. Most people will not be able to get that right. It\u2019s like cooking scallop. Anyways as far as cooking the waygu, I recommend using thyme, do not use butter or any other oil. Cold pan, meat on, medium high heat. The fat will melt and become it\u2019s own butter for the steak.

This post was the final nail in the meat coffin.", "What is required:\n1. Vacuum Sealer\n2. UmaiDry Bags\n3. A large cut of meat \n4. An elevated cooling rack\n\nYou can purchase a kit from UmaiDry that has both the Vacuum sealer and the bags, this is what I used to get started: \nhttps://umaidry.com/collections/all/products/dry-aged-steak-bags-kit\n\nAs for the meat I usually go to Costco. I usually get a Prime ribeye that is between 16 and 18lbs and they usually price it at $10/lb. I prefer using prime because of the marbling, but you can also purchase choice for about $5/lb and the end result will be about as tender as a prime steak.\n\nAny cooling rack will do, here is the style that I used: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DTBMPEK/ref=psdc_289721_t3_B07D7ZV1H2\n\nThe goal is to allow air to circulate around the beef to speed up the drying process.\n\nTHE PROCESS: \n\n1. Prepare your umami dry bag by curling back the edges by the opening to prevent any juice from the meat from running down the outside of the bag.\n2. Cut open one side of the bag that your cut of beef came in, drain out excess moisture from the bag but DO NOT dry the meat. The moisture is crucial for the umai bags. \n3. Put the open end of the bag of meat into the umai bag, the goal is to not touch the meat so we do not contaminate it. Once it is fully in you can start to lift the back of the bag from the beef and let it slowly fall into the Umai bag.\n4. Once it is in the bag you can fold the edges back up and get ready to seal it.\n5. Do your best to get the meat into the corner of the UmaiDry bag, this will help when sealing to get out the maximum amount of moisture.\n6. First use the seal only feature to seal about a 3 inch diagonal section of the bag on the top corner. The vacuum sealer is not wide enough for the entire Umai Dry bag so this ensures that when you actually vacuum seal it.\n7. Place one of the white seal strips near the edge of the open section of the bag. Press the vacuum and seal button and as its sealing do your best to massage as much air out as possible. YOU WILL NOT GET ALL THE AIR OUT! Its pretty much impossible. It should be tight around the meat, but small pockets are okay.\n8. At this point make a couple extra seals above the originals just to ensure that you have the best possible results and no air slips in.\n9. You can now place the steak on the drying rack in the fridge. It should have plenty of open air around it for best results.\n10. Every 5-10 days flip the meat, although we are using a drying rack for circulation the bottom still will not get as much circulation as the top so its good to flip it over every now and again.\n11. WAIT! \n12. After anywhere from 28-50 days your meat will be ready. Trim the meat and you will have some of the most flavorful and tender cuts of meat you have ever had at home.", "I do this by laying it on a wire rack inside my fridge with a bowl of salt nearby. Have never tried the umai bags and rarely do I ever a whole rib roast, but I do age individual steaks and chunkier roasts...not so long that they require a trim, but long enough to form a pellicle, shrink and condense slightly, and maybe even start growing a little mold....THEN I cook em! Most of the results you see in my posts in r/steak are done this way. And to cook, I sear with a blowtorch direct from the fridge til it's black. Inside is almost always still rare. Thicker and leaner cuts, I will reverse sear for just a bit for a little more heat penetration. Then I'll deep fry them them in lard. Then I'll torch them. Not saying umai vacuum sealed aged meat wouldn't be delicious, but the simpler way most def won't let you down!", "Looked at this and said \u201cfuck yeah\u201d out loud. Nice.", "[deleted]", "I've been aging my meat for 15 years, ladies..", "Mmmmmm.", "Nice", "Wow! Looks amazing!", "That looks incredible. I need some umai bags!", "Man, I need that in my life. Look's like a trip to Costco is in my future along with Umai bags. This my be a dumb or ignorant question, but I am new to this process. After the aging process is done, and you got this slab of beauty on board ready to cut up, do you remove the top layer that is right above the fat cap? Or do you just trim the meat to size/portion and let it be?", "Beautiful meat. Like the knife too. \n\nAfter you finish, how do you store the meat until you cook it? Do you Slice individual steaks and freeze or store them some other way? Just wondering what the best way to preserve without detracting from the taste."]}

For the thickness of that steak it should have been 12 hrs max. \n\n2. What you see here is salt induced oxidation. Basically the salt (brine) pulled all the moisture out of that dark layer you see in the cooked photo. That oxidized and turned hard. Similar to dry age but OP spend that process up. \n\n3. You can never rehydrate that dried out section. Visually you can see the salt penetrated through the meat and pulled moisture out. \n\n4. Cook is weird. Smoking the meat shouldn\u2019t result in grill marks if you plan to cast finish. Smoking should be at 180\u00b0F max and just bring that meat up to 120\u00b0 internal . Then you\u2019d seat on a hot cast with fats and resting until 130-135\u00b0F. \n\nSorry OP but all of this was done wrong.

You're good if there's no smell. This happens when beef touches itself. If you set a steak on another steak it will turn brown where they touch.", "It's fine, meat cutter of 20+ years. \n\u2022What Makes Ground Beef Red? \nAll warm-blooded animals contain a pigment called myoglobin in their muscle tissues. This pigment is normally a dark grayish-purple, but when it comes in contact with oxygen, it becomes oxymyoglobin and turns a deep red color. \nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/ground-beef-color-and-safety-1805840#:~:text=What%20Makes%20Ground%20Beef%20Red,turns%20a%20deep%20red%20color.\nTo get that eye-pleasing (red) coloration, most freshly ground beef is sold in clear packages of oxygen- permeable film. The oxygen goes through the film and allows the meat to turn that pretty red color we associate with fresh beef.\nGround Beef Turning Brown? This is Why!\n\nYou might have noticed that when you purchase your ground beef, the color is mostly pink or red, but once you refrigerate, it turns brown. As you know, ground meat contains proteins, also known as myoglobin. Once you keep it in the refrigerator, it lacks oxygen exposure and changes the color to brown.\nhttps://preparedcooks.com/ground-beef-turning-brown/", "Unless it's green and smells, all good", "Oh for the love of Jesus Fucking Christ, the amount of misinformation here is astounding. \n\nMeat scientist, food safety, raw beef. It's my degree and my career. \n\nThe natural color of beef is a dark purplish brownish color. That's why when you buy a roast and cut into it, it's a dark purple and it gradually will turn red. So what you're seeing is the red on the outside is called, \"bloom.\" It's when oxygen reacts with the iron in myoglobin and turns red. Once that meat is no longer exposed to oxygen  it will revert back to its \"natural\" dark color. The meat on the outside was blocking the meat on the inside so it's back to its dark color. \n\nThey do not put nitrogen into the meat. They will put a regulated amount of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen into sealed packages to make the myoglobin hold onto the oxygen and thus the red color longer. The amounts of these gasses that are allowed to be added are strictly regulated. Additionally, this package in particular doesn't appear to be the type that the gasses would be used it. They're used in the sealed Styrofoam trays that you can feel the gas in when you touch the top. This looks like regular cellophane wrapping. \n\nThey do not add nitrates to fresh beef. They add nitrates to meats that are \"cured,\" such as salami, bacon, beef jerky, etc. Again, these amounts are strictly regulated and the amounts used must be documented. Fun fact: your \"uncured\" meats STILL have nitrates in them, they are just derived from celery salt and unregulated. You get more nitrates from your vegetables than you do from cured meats. \n\nThey do not inject red dye into your meat. What the fuck. \n\nFor meat, you should know there is no requirement for a \"use by\" or \"best by\" date, but most places will do it as a best practice. There is also nothing that says a market can't buy a product that has one date, and change it. So they can change a date. \n\nThat being said, with meat your senses are your best tool when determining if it's off. If it's green, slimy, smells bad. Don't eat it. \n\nEven meat that is brown in the outside is fine to eat, it's just oxidized (the iron in the myoglobin itself becomes oxidized) and it's perfectly safe to eat.\n\nEdit also:  the liquid in the bottom of your packages of meat is NOT blood. All of the blood is drained from the carcass at the time of slaughter (there's truth to the statement, \"bleed like a stuck pig\"). It's called *purge* and it is simply a mixture of water and myoglobin, which is why it's pink. Having been covered in beef and pork blood, I can assure you, if it was blood it would be thick and gelatinous. Blood coagulates within minutes.", "I go more by the smell.

Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese.

But, the past few years I've been trying to do more things in my grill and every time I've cooked moose on it, if it's at the 175-180 range, blood pours out of it when I cut into it.\n\nExample; I had a 2 beautiful roast about 2-2.5 lbs each. I decided I'd try one on the rotisserie. I marinated it over night, and the next day for dinner I fired up the grill. I can't remember how long I cooked it for, but when I put my thermometer in it, it read it was at 185. Put it on the plate, wrapped it up and let it rest for 15 mins. After the rest I took it out and cut it, and blood literary poured out of it! The meat wasnt red either, just a little pink, but mostly the dark color moose turns when on the well done side. So I wanted to get it right and did the same thing the next day, but this time I went to 205, and when cut, no blood! \n\n I'm just wondering if someone else has ever ran into this.

I only get it from home, so it's hard to find other people who cook it.\n\nSorry for the long post!", "Frank is directly responsible for the deaths of 8 children and is living about the rest of his life in federal prison.", "A Moosket", "I had moose once and it was transcendent.", "That thumbnail is terrifying", "[deleted]", "what is moose like compared to beef?", "Classic Frank.", "I\u2019ve personally never had moose,  but love elk.

For medium bring the steak to about 125F in the oven. I can't tell the thickness of that steak, but start checking the temp maybe 15 minutes in to be safe, would guess it will take 20-25 though\n* Don't use non-stick for the sear, cast iron is great but stainless steel should also work perfectly\n* Get the pan quite hot, but not \"going to boil water for pasta\" hot.

Add some salt and pepper and some paprika or garlic powder, whisk and simmer until your sauce can coat the back of a wooden spoon and you can draw a line through it that doesn\u2019t break (by this i mean- stir with your wooden spoon, hold it over the pan with the handle sideways, draw a line along the back that runs along the handle. If the drips dont break the line too quickly its not too thin. Or really just use that method to check the thickness until it is where you want it). now you have a pan sauce! If you go creamy, melt some blue cheese in at the end and make a mournay sauce. A warm sauce helps keep bites warm, and covers up a multitude of sins like if it ends up being a little dry.

Season the oxtails with salt and pepper, and sear them on all sides  until browned. You may need to do this in batches. Transfer the oxtails  to a plate and set the oxtails aside.\n2. **Saut\u00e9:** Add  the onion to the pot and cook until translucent and softened, 3-5  minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and habanero, then stir and cook for 1  minute. Stir in the allspice, smoked paprika, soy sauce, tomato paste,  and cook for 2-3 minutes until the paste browns slightly.\n3. **Braise:** Add  the oxtails back to the pot. Stir in the beef broth, thyme, bay leaves  and bring the pot to a boil. You want to have enough broth to cover most  of the oxtails, so start with 4 cups and add more as necessary. Turn  the heat to low and cover with a lid slightly cracked. Simmer for 2  hours, remove the lid and stir in the butter beans, then simmer for  another 30-45 minutes uncovered.\n4. **Finish:** Remove  the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Whisk the cornstarch with 1 tbsp water  to create a slurry. Stir the slurry into the pot and increase the heat  to medium, stirring until the mixture thickens. Garnish with freshly  chopped green onion.\n\n**Recipe Notes**\n\n1. Transfer your leftovers to an airtight  container and store in the fridge for 3-4 days. You can reheat in the  microwave, or on the stovetop. In a skillet, saucepan, or pot, heat the  stew over medium heat. You can add more beef broth if needed. Let  everything simmer for 5-10 minutes or until the oxtails are warmed  through. \n2. Your stew will also last 6-12 months  frozen in an airtight container. While it\u2019ll work best to let the stew  thaw overnight in the fridge before reheating, you can reheat it  straight from the freezer using either the microwave or stovetop.\n\n**Nutrition Information:**\n\nCalories: 729kcal (36%)Carbohydrates: 23g (8%)Protein: 80g (160%)Fat: 35g (54%)Saturated Fat: 13g (81%)Cholesterol: 249mg (83%)Sodium: 1196mg (52%)Potassium: 865mg (25%)Fiber: 6g (25%)Sugar: 5g (6%)", "This looks delicious.

So it was a 75% edible meat ratio rounding down to my home scale being heavier than the store\u2019s. Please note, you will likely get 12lbs to 12.5 lbs of a whole brisket trimmed the traditional way with the point still attached to the flat, with some of the in between fat scoped out.  So that\u2019s about an 85% edible ratio. Because I trimmed to separate them and bc I\u2019m making corned beef, I probably over-trimmed the flat piece. I tried to do the traditional 1/4 inch of fat, but wounded up exposing the meat in a several spots. My brisket was not graded and it was from Smart & Final. It was $4.49 per pound or $65 whole.

I'm no professional, but a few things I've learned over the years of cooking: \n\n1. Pound your chicken to flatten it a bit before cooking it so it cooks faster and more evenly. You don't need any special tools, I just pound it with my fist until it's about an inch thick at the most. I'm assuming this is a chicken breast, at least. Maybe it's a roast? If so then cook low and slow. I couldn't give you an oven temp since I cook roasts in the crockpot. \n\n2. Marinade the meat beforehand if possible with a marinade that contains canola oil or coat the entire outside surface with oil before seasoning. Really any oil with a high smoke point will do: canola, avocado, etc. The oil creates a barrier to lock in juices while it cooks. A basic, quick marinade can simply be oil + seasoning of your choice and maybe a little vinegar. Cooking doesn't have to be complicated to be delicious. \n\n3. Don't be afraid of salt. In moderation, it's not the devil that health nuts want you to think it is. Don't go overboard, but at least use a little bit. Salt creates a chemical reaction that brings out the flavors of the other seasonings. Premade seasoning mixes may look like they contain a lot of sodium, but realistically you're not going to put a whole serving size of it on a single serving of meat so it's not that big a deal. Marinating is ideal since most of the sodium gets tossed with the remaining marinade, but no worries if you're sprinkling seasoned salt or something on the meat right before throwing it on your heat source of choice.", "You cooked the shit out of it", "Yes", "The seasoning is burnt and it looks dry inside. Overcooked.", "Sorry bro, hard pass", "Not if you enjoy it.

If you\u2019re cooking for yourself and it tastes good to you you\u2019re a chef. If you\u2019re cooking professionally and people have to guess what you\u2019re serving them you probably have room for improvement.\n\nPersonally, I would be bored if I ran out of things to learn. If you decide that you need to up your game, embrace it as a challenge\u2014and reap the rewards on every plate.", "Horrid", "Depends, if that\u2019s beef fillet, then yes.", "What is the black on top?

Jesus", "I suspect that it's half your cooking skills, and half your photography skills.", "All the juice that\u2019s supposed to be in the meat is in the pan, and the muscle fibers turn stark white when cut because they shred down to the individual fibre. your cooking can\u2019t be bad because you don\u2019t cook, you dry.\u00a0", "Please get help", "Looks like a learning opportunity! Don't feel bad. As someone who overcooks white meat poultry, you're in a very popular club called almost everyone. People have the ick over salmonella in poultry and due to poorly communicated and overly-simplified regulatory safety recommendations, a decent section of the population have never actually eaten any white meat poultry that wasn't overcooked.\n\nThe first thing to know is that the color of the meat has very little bearing on the doneness. Cutting into it to check it is horrible for multiple reasons, none the least of which is it's not a good indicator. You said below you're buying a meat thermometer! That's great news. I'm not sure what you ordered but if you don't end up liking it, I recommend the ThermoPop from Thermoworks. It's an excellent entry-level meat thermometer and it's going to be better than 90% of the junk on Amazon.\n\nNow you have a meat thermometer. Problem solved? Hardly. Ask 100 people including experienced cooks when to pull chicken and they'll likely almost all give you the answer of 165F. If you pull your white meat poultry at 165F, it's already overcooked and the carryover cooking is going to destroy it further. Pasteurization is a product of *time at temperature* not a single temperature target. At 165F you can be sure your poultry is safe because it's the temperature where most microbes are killed instantly. If you pull your white meat at 145F, it only needs to be held at that temp for 8.5 minutes to attain safe pasteurization. At 155F it's somewhere around 30 seconds. For individual breasts like you're cooking, try pulling them at 150F in the thickest part, set them on a rack, and lightly tent them with foil to rest for 10 minutes. The temperature will continue to rise past your pull point so it will continue to cook and the time at temp will render it safe to eat.\n\nDark meat is another matter altogether and it's more about hitting a target temp for tenderness. That temp is 170-180F depending on your taste, and is well above the safe pasteurization temp so you don't have to do the balancing act of trying to hit the perfect line between safety and quality. If you want something easy, choose leg meat.\n\nIndividual white meat poultry like chicken and turkey breasts are some of the more challenging things to cook really well. You have a very tight window to pull it when it's perfect. You basically always want some sort of brine-based preparation. Getting any kind of good browning is a bit difficult due to the delicateness of the cut. It takes practice. You can read more in [this article about whole roast chicken](https://blog.thermoworks.com/thermal-tips-simple-roasted-chicken/) or Kenji's teachings on poultry cooking in his book The Food Lab.", "Doesn\u2019t look appetizing to me", "The picture does have a piece of meat that has been violated to the extent the person who treated it so poorly should be due for a trial at The Hague. \n\nI will never BBQ anything other than bone in skin on thighs or wings.\n\nIt is just so easy to overcook any white meat. \n\nI don\u2019t want to take the time to perfect doing what it takes to get chicken or Turkey breasts good when the others are so much more difficult to mess up.", "It's edible, and that's what matters. However if you're looking for BBQ-ish results, it's far from it and we can definitely help you improve. Let's start with the questions and tweak your methods to help improve the end result.\n\nWhat was your cooking method, like are you smoking it, grilling it, baking in the oven, etc? \n\nHow long and at what temp did you cook it? \n\nDid you cook for a specific amount of time, or did you go for an internal temp? \n\nDid you brine it at all, and what kind of spices/rubs are you using?", "Yeah probably just find a new hobby.", "Not bad per se, but room for improvement.\n\nSeason your chicken for 24 hours. Spice rubs, wet marinades, butter and fresh herbs...\nGrill/broil it hot at the start or end of the cook for browning.\nTake temperature and remove chicken before it over cooks. Taking white to ~180F like here is too far and unessecary to get past salmonella risk (165F). Dark meat should go a little farther (180F). Yes, this makes whole birds more complicated (split white and dark meat sections and pull white early)\nLet it rest for 10-20 minutes after removing from heat to retain more moisture.\n\nWho gives a fuck about redditors opinions, but for yourself and whoever you cook for: it will look better, and taste better.", "look gross af ngl", "You have to understand the high level of elitism is most cooking subs. They all think if themselves as award winning pit masters or Michelin star chefs", "What really matters is whether you and your family enjoyed it. \nIf you feel you need to improve you can ask for tips or recipes and r/bbq and r/smoking are great resources.", "wtf is that rub and why did you cook it so much? did you marinate it at all? looks dry af", "What seasoning", "I don\u2019t see the problem, but I also don\u2019t cook chicken so wtf do I know", "Yeh i vomited in my mouth 3 times just then", "That's still oinking needs to go atleast 13 more hours", "Is that mold from your ceiling sprinkled on top?", "Yes", "It is overcooked. Common when people don't have a lot of experience with cooking chicken in particular. This isn't to the inedible stage, you can still eat it, it just won't be providing much joynas an eating experience.\n\n\nSome thoughts: did you start with fresh or frozen?  Fresh is easier to cook well.\n\n\nButterfly or pound that chicken. I run a knife through the middle of breasts to make a thinner filet before cooking. Easier to cook the middle without blasting the edges. Using a hammer or heavy pan to beat your chicken flat can also accomplish this.\n\n\nOtherwise, just keep at it. Use a thermometer. As soon as a breast hits 165, pull it. You can actually pull a little sooner, around 160 or so, and tent with foil and allow to rest. As the outside difuses its heat, the internal temp will rise those last few degrees to be safe, and the juices will redistribute through the breast.\n\n\nPractice with boneless thighs. They start thinner, and are virtually impossible to overcook (they can go up into the high 170s before drying out). They are more forgiving.\n\n\nOnce you get the feel for timing and compression, you won't need the thermometer."]}

What it eats is a huge factor. Swamp deer will be more gamey than corn/soy bean fed deer.\n2. How it is processed. If the processor takes the time to de fat and trim silver skin then less gamey taste. Also some processors will ad beef fat, pork trim and similar to the ground meat because venison by itself is very lean.\n\nSo, these play a big role in taste. If processed well, venison burger is a healthy protein option!", "Game taste has to do with lack of aging and poor processing .. I hang all my deer 14 ta 20 days before I process them. When I grind , I use 20% of total weight and then use pork butt or bacon. Or you could use beef tallow if you can find it .

Black pepper, juniper, espresso, rosemary, thyme are all seasonings that blend well & enhance the venison. I personally, have a homemade house blend that has cracked black pepper, salt, thyme & rosemary- I top burgers with a jalape\u00f1o raspberry & blackberry jam as they also pair excellently with the game meat.\n\nLastly, but most importantly, venison is lean. I like my version to be 85/15- I use pork fat for 90% of the added fat & then just a sprinkle of beef fat to bring it together. I use restraint when adding the beef fat, it has a stronger flavor and can overtake if you add too much. A little spoonful of beef tallow (the liquid/crisco textured stuff you can buy from the store) goes a long way & does a damn good job of injecting must needed fat.\n\nSorry for the rant- hope you enjoy!!!", "You have to cool the meat down ASAP. Then, age the meat hide on at least 14 days another week is preferred, but sometimes I have to schedule the butchering around my work schedule. It makes all the difference in the world.

{"title": "Update: The London Broil that spent a week in the fridge.", "selftext": "I have learned a valuable lesson this week, well maybe a couple. \n\n1. If you ask a question on Reddit, make sure you give the people all the information. \n\nThe reason I came here and asked if the meat was okay, was because I don\u2019t have a very strong sense of smell. I had my nose cauterized as a child, and since then I can really only smell artificially scented things. Someone mentioned that bad mean has a sulphur scent, which is the one thing I specifically cannot smell at all. Yes that means no farts, no propane, no rotten eggs, and skunk has to be fresh, otherwise I cannot smell it either. (I promise you your special brand of fart isn\u2019t gonna be the one that breaks the barrier, many people have tried). I\u2019m not going to lie it\u2019s pretty nice not smelling farts, but not being able to grill alone kinda sucks. \n\n2. Wet Aging. \n\nThank you u/slackerwithgoals for enlightening me to the world of wet aging, and that under the right circumstances you can go much longer than a week. \n\nP.s you were right, I should have waited longer.  Next time I\u2019m going to try two weeks. \n\n3. Sous Vide tips\n\nAlso shout out u/smakdye for sharing your wisdom. Now if only next time I listen a little better, and not take it out at 5.5 hours\u2026 the 4 year old demanded food, and I started the process a little late. (It was ever so slightly dry, I assume that\u2019s from too little in its hot tub, I also usually put butter in with steaks but see point below for why I forgot) \n\n4. ADHD and pieces of meat like this don\u2019t mix super well. \n\nI originally posted this on Monday, then life happened and I didn\u2019t get to cooking it until today. I meant to put it in at 9am so it could go the full 8 hours recommended by Smakdye, but then life happened again and it didn\u2019t go in until 12:30 ish, and came out of the hot tub at 6:10pm. The small human was not happy that dinner was significantly later, but I got a \u201cgood turkey mommy\u201d out of him, so we\u2019ll call it a dinner win. \n\nLastly, I already knew this so it won\u2019t be on the list, but I\u2019m a girl. Not that it matters, just putting it out there so I don\u2019t get called a he again. \n\nThank you to everyone who commented with help, or a good laugh. This has been a fun journey.

Or Google around your area.  \n\nWhen buying a quarter or half cow, what matters in the end is what cuts you get and the total price as to which you can determine a $/lb. You can then compare and contrast to what you usually buy a grocery store. Very often (but maybe not always) it's better to buy a quarter or half cow in terms of $/lb. The caveat however is the high upfront cost and the need for storage space.  \n\nOnce you find a few farms/butchers that can sell you a quarter or half cow, figure out what you get. They should be able to provide you something called a cut sheet where it lists how many of what cuts are in your order. You are usually able to customize it, asking for more of X and less of Y. But remember you can only get so many of certain cuts in each carcass. Expect a lot of ground beef either way. Some places may offer to convert some of even all of it to sauage if you want. Some places may also offer the bones and/or trimmings.   \n\nEvery carcass is a little different, but a typical hanging weight of a half cow would be about 300-450lbs. Using a standard 60% of hanging weight (in my area anyway), would equate to about 180-270 lbs of beef. You pay by pound typically speaking so the heavier it is, the more beef you get, but the more you pay. \n\nLast thing about storage - some places wrap everything in butcher paper, other places may vacuum seal it. Vacuum sealing is the gold standard, but butcher paper is fine if you plan to use the meat within 1 year. Any longer, I'd recommend vacuum sealing to prevent freezer burn. Some places may do that for you (cost of it is bundled with the final price you pay usually) and other places may offer to do it for a small charge.", "I sell beef, but I'm a 2 day drive away. \n\nFacebook sucks, but there are entire groups that are made up of farmers that directly market meat.\n\nJust watch for scammers.

You want to remove that either way you go. From there you have two wonderful options. \n\n1. Roast it. Medium rare to medium is best. Cross cut it. It will finish out as having a seam down the middle that some people like for its flavor. Some do not. The fat congeals and isn't bad imo. But people have been conditioned to dislike fat.\n\n2. Filet it like fish and it is two flat iron steaks.  It isn't difficult but it is difficult to master. You probably won't yield out as well as a professional but you can get the job done.

{"title": "Buying Used: Elbow Grease vs Overhaul", "selftext": "Hello all!  New to this sub.  I enjoy doing up meats (and even veggies) on my pellet grill, and do so rather frequently.  Most typically it's things like chicken, ribs, burgers, etc.  But I do my fair share of larger cuts, such as brisket and lamb.  I also occasionally do homemade bacon--well, more accurately, I've recently started to get into this.\n\nSo i'm looking at buying a meat slicer.  My normal tendency is to go with used: will allow me to jump to that next level of quality.  Locally there is a used Globe up for sale.  The Amazon pic they've used as a reference is of a G12, but they indicate that the 'image shown is smaller model', so i'm trying to confirm what that means, what model is actually for sale.  They've included a pic in the ad, but I can't tell from looking.  They are asking $400.\n\nThe pic of the slicer for sale looks rather rough--dull and kind of 'patina-ed' where the sliced meat collects, and discolored (darkish) elsewhere.  There are also signs of what appear to be vertical drip marks (stains?) and splatter on the vertical surface behind the blade. But it's not a great pic, so it's difficult to know what's going on.\n\nMy question (finally!) is what constitutes a need for just some good ol' elbow grease (will happily do) versus the need to bring this into a professional for a complete overhaul (deal breaker)?  I have fundamental mechanical skills, as in I can take things apart, do some basic analysis, clean, possibly adjust, and put it all back together again.  But I am not rebuilding any motors, that's for sure.  What should I be looking for?  Obviously, I would ask to fire it up and have a quick go at it, but what else/how else might I be trying to test or inspect?\n\nThank you in advance, not only for any advice, but for also reading this small novella!\n\nTL;DR: Want to buy used meat slicer that looks rough.

I would prefer high protein, high in iron and soft texture once cooked rather than rubbery. \n\nThank you for your help. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/1i5pyj8/which_beef_cut_to_do_mince/", "created_utc": 1737379125.0, "score": 8, "author": "blurfin_sploofers", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/meat/comments/1i5pyj8/which_beef_cut_to_do_mince/", "html_title": "", "top_comments": ["I would start with chuck, if it\u2019s too fatty you can mix in a leaner cut.

I also put the metal parts of the grinder in the freezer ahead of time to get them freezing cold.

If you're buying boneless skinless chicken parts, you are buying them from one of the big brands almost without fail.  Your local butcher can't escape the realities of modern food supply chains in the US.\n\nIf you live in a different country ignore my response because it's probably slightly different, but most of us are experiencing late stage capitalism regardless of where we live.", "Generally chicken you buy at a supermarket has had water or brine or something like that pumped into it for the additional weight, which translates to more money for them.

{"title": "How to combat the gristle in liver ", "selftext": "Times are tough. I feel like I remember things like flank and skirt being cheap. Fucking BONE MARROW used to be cheap (edit: ten years ago big name markets would give it to me for free). One of the last common vestiges seems to be liver in my area. I want to learn how to better like/utilize liver. \n\nI bought beef liver from Safeway. It came frozen in slices. The package claimed it was deveined and that it's membrane was taken off. I did the usual soaking in milk before searing and eating. It did remind me a lot of foie gras.....as if....foie gras is like the \"crazy waygu\" of liver or something......but a few issues....\n\nFirst....each of these slices were surrounded their edges by what seemed like a membrane, a thin white ish tissue that pulled off.....that's a fuckin membrane right? Am I to think that liver has multiple membranes and Safeway is selling liver that has the greater membrane taken off or is this a false sale of goods? Secondly, there was a gristle nature in some of the bites and it somewhat corresponded to the holes I could see in the slices.....presumably this is where the veins used to be. My question is....if a liver is deveined....should there be zero gristle? Or like.....is the gristle I am perceiving probably just the integral part of the liver that is left behind when a vein is removed? I understand that veins and arteries are probably gristly as all hell, but I also wouldn't be surprised if, in general, tissues that immediately surround veins and arteries are also somewhat gristly.......like...the transition from vein to \"pure liver tissue\" is a gradation of gristle to less gristle. \n\nAm I thinking about this right? Does is seem like this liver didn't actually have the membrane removed?
