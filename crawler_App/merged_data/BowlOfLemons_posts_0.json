{"title": "Bowls of Lemons: A Beginner's Guide", "selftext": "There are many important things to take in mind when making a bowl of lemons and you want to make your bowl of lemons the nicest bowl of lemons the bowl of lemons can be, so I will take you step by step in making these choices and making them right.\n\n1. The Lemons\nThere are many places you can get lemons, a farmer's market, a grocery store or even off a tree in your backyard. The lemons are what will really make the image in a bowl of lemons, the other big factor is the bowl which corresponds directly with your choice of lemons. We will discuss that next.\n\n2. The Bowl\nThe bowl should match the lemons as well as it can. A blemish-free, plump, bright lemon should go with a nice, clean ceramic bowl. If you were to get a lemon off your tree that is fresh but slightly green and maybe a bit scarred a handmade claw bowl is always a great addition to the imperfect but natural fruit. A lemon from a farmer's market would lay in-between the two; it would be fairly good looking but also natural, I personally love the look of a wood bowl with this.\n\n3. The Picture\nThe picture captures the bowl of lemons and the post can only be as good that the photography. With the clean, sleek, store bought lemons should have a modern, clean and bright background while with the home-grown lemons you want lots of natural sunlight and my want to photograph on a patio table. The in-between for the farmer's market lemons would be a old looking inn or tavern lit by candlelight.\n\nIf you follow these steps when making a bowl of lemons you will have a much better end product. Also, practice makes perfect, you will likely have to try many times to get the perfect shot of the perfect bowl of lemons. I wish you luck and if you have any questions don't hesitate to leave them in the comments.
