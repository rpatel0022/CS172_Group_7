It lacks the spring and structure. It\u2019s good just-drained and still warm, but then turns into dense mud. If you have amazing milk or whey, different story. \n\nVanilla extract \u2014 Infusing beans into bourbon in a pretty bottle looks lovely, but it\u2019s weak tea compared to commercial extracts. Plus, Bourbon vanilla has nothing to do with bourbon whiskey, it refers to Madagascar vanilla. Real extract is way more intense and complex. \n\nAnd\u2026\n\nSometimes stock \u2014 Restaurants with a ton of bones and trim and time to simmer 12+ hours can make amazing stock. But frequently homemade stock made with frozen bags of random bits results in a murky gray fluid that gives off-flavors to the final product.

In fact, I only got really into it about a year ago. Until then, it was just the mystery ingredient that made south Asian absolutely amazing and unique in flavor. Now I literally eat the stuff plain. I\u2019ll pour it into a small cup, and dip my finger into it and lick it off. It\u2019s that good. I think I might need a fish sauce intervention lol, because surely this much sodium on the regular cannot be good for me, and at this rate I\u2019ll be drinking the stuff soon \ud83d\ude02. It makes so many foods taste a million times better and by itself just has the BEST FLAVOR EVER. Disclaimer: I am a total umami addict, so there\u2019s that. But before I got into fish sauce, soy sauce and miso were the condiments that fulfilled this role and scratched my umami itch. But then I properly discovered fish sauce and WHOA. I swear it is one of the best, most perfect tasting condiments/foods on the planet. Yes, it stinks, but so do some of the world\u2019s other most wonderful foods, such as a rich Camembert. It more than makes up for its stinkiness with divine flavor, in fact, it\u2019s to the point where I\u2019ve started to like the smell simply due to positive association. Now I want to try every quality fish sauce brand I can possibly find. This thread is for my fellow fish sauce lovers to show some love for the worlds greatest condiment! What are some of your favorite ways to use it? Also, what are your favorite brands? Who else loves fish sauce as much as I do? I\u2019d imagine a lot of you, given how damn tasty it is!\n\nUmami tip: if you\u2019re craving umami flavor but aren\u2019t really hungry, or just want a very low calorie snack, try putting a bit of fish sauce on dried salted nori sheets (I like oceans halo brand). It gives you that delicious umami hit with hardly any calories, though probably quite a bit of sodium. It may not help your blood pressure, but it will help your waistline lol. Also, it\u2019s just damn tasty. And super easy! I wasn\u2019t playing around when I said I was an umami fiend!\n\nSo in conclusion, all hail the world\u2019s greatest condiment-FISH SAUCE!

Yeah, I know, how could you confuse the two? Well, blame it on old eyes, tired, not labeled containers, put on the wrong pantry shelf, not paying attention, and they kinda look similar. Steel cut oats go in the pot, saut\u00e9ing for a while before adding liquid\u2026um honey\u2026something\u2019s not right here??

Once the oats started getting al dente and sauce thickening, we tried it, expecting to make funny faces and order that pizza.\n\nGuess what?? It was fantastic!! It had a nice slightly chewy texture. The oats gave this nice nutty flavor, complemented by the garlic & lemon, and went great with the shrimp.

Better yet, learn how to dice an onion properly and keep your section tidy and clean before doing any of those other things. While you're at it, learn how to take advice and direction without talking back. And for the love of fuck learn how to spell the ingredients you're labelling (learn to label!) so that I know what the hell I'm looking at when I'm in the walk-in.  \n\nThen, and only then, will you have enough knowledge to make an informed decision on whether or not a career in the culinary industry and the expense and time investment required for culinary school will be worth it for you. \n\nTL:DR--Just because you like to cook at home and have a \"passion\" doesn't mean you're cut out for the Hospitality Industry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/culinary/comments/h15jdc/re_the_everpresent_should_i_go_to_culinary_school/", "created_utc": 1591901893.0, "score": 29, "author": "rattalouie", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/h15jdc/re_the_everpresent_should_i_go_to_culinary_school/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Not sure if my lobster was OK", "selftext": "My wife and I eat seafood regularly i.e. oysters, shrimp, scallops, crab, many types of fish, etc.  For her birthday I wanted to cook her something special and my local seafood shop, known for their fresh offerings, had fresh Maine lobster on sale.  I decided to purchase two of them to cook for dinner.  \n\nNow, while I have quite a bit of experience cooking and eating other seafood, I've never cooked lobster before.  I referred to some interweb recipes and all signs pointed to boiling some water with sea salt, adding the lobsters, waiting for the water to return to a boil, and cook for 15-20 minutes.  I did this, boiling the lobsters for roughly 18 minutes.\n\nThen we sat to eat them.  Taking the advice of one blogger, we opted to forego butter and just eat it with lemon. While we talked and cracked open our lobsters' tails we both realized that *neither of us had eaten fresh boiled lobster in our lives*.  We have both had it as an ingredient (lobster rolls, lobster mac & cheese, etc. at restaurants) but not all on its own! \n\nWhile they were cooking, my wife said they smelled a little strange, \"like cedar chips\".  When we began eating them, the lobster tasted kind of muddy, not sweet or briny.  It almost reminded me of warm water crab that wasn't really in season (I grew up near the NC coast).  We wondered if they might have been fed some sort of fish-chow while in captivity that tainted the meat. We ate them, but it wasn't exactly the delicacy we where hoping for.\n\n**So my question is:  Was something wrong with our lobsters?** Did I prepare them incorrectly?  \nDo my wife and I just have inexperienced pallets when it comes to lobster? \n\nI was going to call the seafood shop and ask them but I don't want to bother them (or seem like a dummy) unless there is truly something wrong .\n**Any insight is appreciated!**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/culinary/comments/1nchrx/not_sure_if_my_lobster_was_ok/", "created_utc": 1380417195.0, "score": 12, "author": "TheGoldMonkey", "num_comments": 9, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/1nchrx/not_sure_if_my_lobster_was_ok/", "html_title": ""}

Figured I'd share my answer, as it seems a lot of people don't know why to do it, even if they know it makes the food taste better:\n\n>Most stews and chilis taste significantly better on the second day because aromatic ingredients like onions, garlic, and peppers (not coincidentally the ingredients pictured) have reactions as they sit that produce flavor compounds that then react with proteins in the dish. The process of cooling a cooked stew or chili, sitting it for a day, and then reheating it tends to maximize this reaction.\n\n>The time also allows the flavors to soak into starches and proteins (such as the chicken and kidney beans in this chili, not pictured). Starches particularly do this, because they gelatinize when cooked, and then when they cool between cooking and reheating the flavors of the dish get trapped in them as the starches recrystallize. The second gelatinization (reheating) also changes the texture of a stew or chili as the fibers break down, and it becomes thicker.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/culinary/comments/21gt9b/why_you_should_wait_a_day_to_eat_your_stew_or/", "created_utc": 1395882335.0, "score": 6, "author": "Matticus_Rex", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/21gt9b/why_you_should_wait_a_day_to_eat_your_stew_or/", "html_title": ""}

Most schools that I found dedicated to just culinary arts (that aren't community colleges) seem to be outside of my state.

Sprinkle in a packet of taco seasoning, following the package instructions, to infuse the meat with bold, savory flavors.Warm soft tortillas in the same skillet, letting them soak up the residual spices for an extra layer of flavor.

Ive thought about making fresh dumplings in the morning and adding to it when it needs to be reheated?

Add a splash of water or chicken stock if it feels too thick, as ramen broth typically has a slightly looser consistency.\n\n2. **Prepare the Ramen Noodles**  \n   - Cook the ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.\n\n3. **Season the Sauce for Ramen**  \n   - To give the Bolognese an extra ramen-style twist, stir these into the sauce:  \n     - **1 tbsp soy sauce** (adds umami).  \n     - **1/2 tsp sesame oil** (for nuttiness).  \n     - **1/4 tsp chili flakes or chili oil** (optional, for heat).  \n     - **1/4 tsp garlic powder** (if you want a more intense garlic flavor).  \n     - **A pinch of sugar** (to balance the flavors, if needed).  \n\n4. **Assemble the Dish**  \n   - Divide the cooked ramen noodles into bowls.  \n   - Ladle the seasoned Bolognese sauce over the noodles.  \n   - Sprinkle the crispy bacon on top.\n\n5. **Optional Toppings**  \n   - Soft-boiled egg (slice it in half for presentation).  \n   - Freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  \n   - Chopped green onions.  \n   - A drizzle of chili oil or sesame oil.  \n\n6. **Final Touch**  \n   - Add a pinch of **black pepper** and a sprinkle of **toasted sesame seeds** if you like.  \n\n---\n\n### **Serving Suggestion**  \nServe it hot, mix the toppings into the noodles, and enjoy the comforting fusion of Bolognese and ramen flavors!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/2pay0vedtfae1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1735761257.0, "score": 0, "author": "Weird_Map_6000", "num_comments": 3, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/1hraxhc/gpt_ramen_20/", "html_title": ""}

Unfortunately, my experience there was nothing like I imagined. Everything was terribly organized: no clear schedule, no proper cooking classes, and no culinary instructors. Our entire practical training consisted of kitchen duties, working 24 days a month. We were expected to cook for the school members without supervision, and the only people around were the MIT volunteers from India \u2014people working for HTMI to get a one-year Swiss visa. These MIT volunteers treated me terribly, often giving \nmenial tasks like peeling vegetables or cleaning, telling us that we were there to work, not to learn or enjoy our studies.\nAlmost every Friday, I was in the kitchen cooking for HTMI and cleaning up afterward. It felt like I was working as a servant rather than a student. This \"education\" cost me 35,000 euros. The quality of the food we cooked was poor, and some days were entirely vegetarian, even though it was prepared by the students. The desserts, which were made by pastry students, were the only exception. The pastry chef only occasionally was visiting the main kitchen. The plating of desserts was outdated and reminiscent of a style from the past century\u2014certainly not what you'd expect in a fine dining restaurant. In fact, they even taught us to plate dishes in a clock-style arrangement, which felt ridiculous.\nIn the event planning class, we were expected to find sponsors to organize an event, we had to seek help from local hotels and supermarkets, which wasn\u2019t feasible. They also forgot to give me my iPad in the beginning, and when I asked about it, they accused me of trying to cheat them. To make matters worse, I had to pay my insurance twice. I was hoping for an internship, but the one they offered was below even a McDonald's level. I spent my time preparing sandwiches and salads for hotel staff, and when I reached out to the HTMI career center for support, they stopped replying to my emails.\nHTMI\u2019s website and social media posts show happ students\u2014 17 or 18\u2014living independently and partying on weekends. For those students, it\u2019s more about the experience of being away from home, drinking alcohol (even during classes sometimes) but for me, as an adult who came to gain knowledge, I feel like I lost a year of my life.

I wanted to play with my new toy before I try it on something important like a steak.\n\nSo first things first my turkey wasn't thawed all the way so I took the better part of the first hour struggling to remove the turkey neck that was frozen in the cavity.\n\nMethod was set my Anova Smart Oven to sous vide mode and set temp to 150. Insert thermometer, Throw in oven. Because of the issues I had with the frozen parts I had to dump water. in the first hour or 2. I followed the thermometer and it got to 150.\n\nAs you can see in the graph it got to temp pretty quickly considering it was coming all the way from basically frozen.\n\nAfter I finished a project I came out looked at the thermometer and pulled the turkey cranked the temp to 450 after cleaning out all the liquid on the inside of the oven (there was a lot because of as I said frozen turkey but also it happens in the sous vide mode) threw the turkey in and crisped it up.\n\nResults are awesome. Even though I made a mistake and kind of overcooked (still super juicy though) . If I could do it again. I would probably not go for the finishing in the anova as it had too much temperature drop and couldn't heat up quick enough for the bird. Probably would just use my regular oven as it won't have as much temp drop and will rebound quicker. I also would probably only take it to 145 so I don't get the final temp as high as I did this time (it wound up just over 170 on carry over)\n\nI also would like to tinker around with flavor injections before roasting. I thought about the butter trick but the skin was already tight so I didn't want to tear it too bad. I think injecting turkey broth into it or something I think would be a sick idea.\n\n[Turkey](https://preview.redd.it/7e9rk2zvlq2e1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26a74f8a5ad1b000e2e766fb6cfd58e9c968c381)\n\n[Graph \\(sorry the Y axis is on the other side\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/sia72aixlq2e1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=282e9afef7aa689433e5cf8619266b674809b8ec)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/culinary/comments/1gyd6zv/smart_oven_sous_vide_turkey/", "created_utc": 1732405107.0, "score": 3, "author": "bossmt_2", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/1gyd6zv/smart_oven_sous_vide_turkey/", "html_title": ""}

She brought me into the back classroom earlier today (less than 15 minutes ago as of writing) and asked me why I'm neglecting my work. That's when I told her I had sent an email to the career center's principal about dropping out of her class. I was holding back tears (I cry under pressure, even if I'm not all that worked up) because it's hard to face her, almost any time we did hands on learning she would find our mistakes and act as though we were entirely stupid for getting anything wrong.

Once that\u2019s dissolved and almost boiling I add it to the caramel. \n\nI caramelize the sugar together with the glucose to around 165C\n\nI make rather large badges, like 20liters at a time. \n\nA couple of questions: \n\n1. I follow a recipe that calls for adding sugar to the dairy and never really doubted that. Why would this be recommended? \n\n2. It\u2019s handy to caramelize the sugar and glucose together but would it be beneficial to add the glucose at the end? \n\n3.1 Sometimes I get crystals in the sauce after a while of keeping it in my shelf (uncooled)after the sauce has been. Any ways to prevent this, besides the keeping everything clean and being very cautious with not going in the end product with crystals? \n3.2 If I reheat the whole badge, the crystals will disappear. Will they be gone forever or is it a matter of time before this goes back to crystal sauce? \n\nSometimes I get separation at the bottom of the bottle (I keep it in bottles) after a while. What would be the best way to prevent this? I\u2019ve seen commercial caramel sauces without additives that are able to keep the stability. So I suppose it must be possible. Perhaps emulsifying it even more? \n\nAgain, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!

Should I go to my local community college and take the culinary course there while studying business and finish my general then transfer to a 4 year? If yes then which school should I go? Or should I just apply to a 4 year as soon as a graduate high school and take a business class? \n\nI've Been doing a bit of research and found a couple schools that have a business/marketing majors and some sort of food science or nutrition minor but I also know that's not the exact same as cooking. \n\nI really want to become a chef who eventually has their restaurant but I need some guidance on how to achieve that.

I\u2019ll pour it into a small cup, and dip my finger into it and lick it off. It\u2019s that good. I think I might need a fish sauce intervention lol, because surely this much sodium on the regular cannot be good for me, and at this rate I\u2019ll be drinking the stuff soon \ud83d\ude02.

It gives you that delicious umami hit with hardly any calories, though probably quite a bit of sodium. It may not help your blood pressure, but it will help your waistline lol. Also, it\u2019s just damn tasty. And super easy! I wasn\u2019t playing around when I said I was an umami fiend!\n\nSo in conclusion, all hail the world\u2019s greatest condiment-FISH SAUCE!

Taking part in a cooking competition is a rollercoaster challenging your skills, pushing your creativity, and demanding so much preparation and thought. But you know what? It was totally worth it. Seeing my dishes come together and presenting them in that competition was an experience like no other. What makes it even cooler is that this was one of the first competitions I ever joined. Talk about diving into the deep end, right? But hey, it turns out that my love for the culinary arts and a bit of dedication paid off. Landing third place in such a tough event? I'm over the moon! I'm definitely taking this as a big win and a reminder that the kitchen is where my heart is. Can't wait to keep honing my skills and diving into more culinary adventures. Here's to finding joy and success in every dish I create!  You know, maybe five years from now, I see myself free and happy, having achieved my dream of becoming a skilled chef. I can picture myself taking my talents to different parts of the world, sharing what I can do with people from all walks of life. I'll be bringing my flavors to the global stage, and I can't wait for the whole world to taste what I'm capable of.   \n\nAs I conclude this culinary journey we've shared, I'm reminded that the heart of any exceptional meal lies in the joy it brings to those who savor it. Remember, every dish tells a story, and I'm grateful to have shared a chapter of mine with you. Whether you're in the kitchen or at the dining table, may your experiences be filled with the warmth, flavors, and moments that make each bite unforgettable. Until our next culinary rendezvous, happy cooking and savor every delicious moment! \n\n  \\-arigathanks ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/culinary/comments/18capbo/this_is_not_ninong_ry_this_is_ninong_y/", "created_utc": 1701887700.0, "score": 1, "author": "NinongY", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/18capbo/this_is_not_ninong_ry_this_is_ninong_y/", "html_title": ""}

My version involves a roux, garlic, chicken broth, and a large quantity of heavy cream before adding a ton of grated parm.  Recently my wife bought one of those family sized costco versions of penne alfredo with chicken.  I had the lightbulb idea to add some extra cream and chicken, portion it out, top with shredded cheese, and froze it.  Reheating THAT works wonderfully.  My assumption is there is some kind of additive in the costco alfredo pasta that keeps it from breaking.  Later on, I tried a sort of half-and-half version where i used my own sauce along with the alfredo from costco, portioned, froze, reheated again.  There was now SOME breaking of the sauce, basically pools of butter is what i'm talking about here.  This last time, i did it entirely with my own sauce.  My god, butter breaking from the sauce EVERYWHERE.  So here I am, looking for tips on how to prevent this.

{"title": "Studies at HTMI Switzerland ", "selftext": "I dreamt of getting a bachelor's degree in culinary and I chose HTMI Switzerland. Unfortunately, my experience there was nothing like I imagined. Everything was terribly organized: no clear schedule, no proper cooking classes, and no culinary instructors. Our entire practical training consisted of kitchen duties, working 24 days a month. We were expected to cook for the school members without supervision, and the only people around were the MIT volunteers from India \u2014people working for HTMI to get a one-year Swiss visa. These MIT volunteers treated me terribly, often giving \nmenial tasks like peeling vegetables or cleaning, telling us that we were there to work, not to learn or enjoy our studies.\nAlmost every Friday, I was in the kitchen cooking for HTMI and cleaning up afterward. It felt like I was working as a servant rather than a student. This \"education\" cost me 35,000 euros. The quality of the food we cooked was poor, and some days were entirely vegetarian, even though it was prepared by the students. The desserts, which were made by pastry students, were the only exception. The pastry chef only occasionally was visiting the main kitchen. The plating of desserts was outdated and reminiscent of a style from the past century\u2014certainly not what you'd expect in a fine dining restaurant. In fact, they even taught us to plate dishes in a clock-style arrangement, which felt ridiculous.\nIn the event planning class, we were expected to find sponsors to organize an event, we had to seek help from local hotels and supermarkets, which wasn\u2019t feasible. They also forgot to give me my iPad in the beginning, and when I asked about it, they accused me of trying to cheat them. To make matters worse, I had to pay my insurance twice. I was hoping for an internship, but the one they offered was below even a McDonald's level. I spent my time preparing sandwiches and salads for hotel staff, and when I reached out to the HTMI career center for support, they stopped replying to my emails.\nHTMI\u2019s website and social media posts show happ students\u2014 17 or 18\u2014living independently and partying on weekends. For those students, it\u2019s more about the experience of being away from home, drinking alcohol (even during classes sometimes) but for me, as an adult who came to gain knowledge, I feel like I lost a year of my life. Instead, I contributed free labor to HTMI while still paying them for the privilege.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/culinary/comments/1hg863m/studies_at_htmi_switzerland/", "created_utc": 1734432955.0, "score": 1, "author": "Automatic_Lie_9672", "num_comments": 0, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/1hg863m/studies_at_htmi_switzerland/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Smart Oven Sous Vide Turkey ", "selftext": "So I decided to run an experiment with my new Thermoworks RFX Meat Thermometer. I wanted to cook a turkey before thanksgiving because.\n\n1. I love turkey and don't care if I eat it all week. And with pre-Thanksgiving prices the whole bird cost me 6.26 so even if I just get 3 meals out of it it's an amazing deal.\n2. I wanted to make Turkey stock for banging gravy.\n3. I wanted to play with my new toy before I try it on something important like a steak.\n\nSo first things first my turkey wasn't thawed all the way so I took the better part of the first hour struggling to remove the turkey neck that was frozen in the cavity.\n\nMethod was set my Anova Smart Oven to sous vide mode and set temp to 150. Insert thermometer, Throw in oven. Because of the issues I had with the frozen parts I had to dump water. in the first hour or 2. I followed the thermometer and it got to 150.\n\nAs you can see in the graph it got to temp pretty quickly considering it was coming all the way from basically frozen.\n\nAfter I finished a project I came out looked at the thermometer and pulled the turkey cranked the temp to 450 after cleaning out all the liquid on the inside of the oven (there was a lot because of as I said frozen turkey but also it happens in the sous vide mode) threw the turkey in and crisped it up.\n\nResults are awesome. Even though I made a mistake and kind of overcooked (still super juicy though) . If I could do it again. I would probably not go for the finishing in the anova as it had too much temperature drop and couldn't heat up quick enough for the bird. Probably would just use my regular oven as it won't have as much temp drop and will rebound quicker. I also would probably only take it to 145 so I don't get the final temp as high as I did this time (it wound up just over 170 on carry over)\n\nI also would like to tinker around with flavor injections before roasting. I thought about the butter trick but the skin was already tight so I didn't want to tear it too bad. I think injecting turkey broth into it or something I think would be a sick idea.\n\n[Turkey](https://preview.redd.it/7e9rk2zvlq2e1.jpg?width=4080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26a74f8a5ad1b000e2e766fb6cfd58e9c968c381)\n\n[Graph \\(sorry the Y axis is on the other side\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/sia72aixlq2e1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=282e9afef7aa689433e5cf8619266b674809b8ec)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/culinary/comments/1gyd6zv/smart_oven_sous_vide_turkey/", "created_utc": 1732405107.0, "score": 4, "author": "bossmt_2", "num_comments": 1, "permalink": "/r/culinary/comments/1gyd6zv/smart_oven_sous_vide_turkey/", "html_title": ""}
