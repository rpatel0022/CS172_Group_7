{"title": "It\u2019s been 1 month. Lost five pounds, saved $90, and learned so much.", "selftext": "My teenaged daughter told me in mid-December that she wanted to challenge herself in 2019 and was going to cut meat out of her diet (except seafood). We discussed it and I told her that I would support her by making at least 3 vegetarian meals a week for the family since her brothers didn\u2019t want to make the same lifestyle choices. I told her I would make sure that there was always an option for her to eat but I wouldn\u2019t prepare a separate meal for her on the nights we were having a meat based protein. She had some birthday money left and asked if we could buy some prepared foods for those nights. I compromised and told her I would split the cost because I felt it wasn\u2019t fair for a 15 year old to have to buy her own food. \n\nShe and I researched different menu items and decided that we were going to avoid meat analogs. We found a lot of Indian and East Asian dishes that were either vegetarian by themselves or had meatless options. I researched different preparations that use tofu or other plant based proteins. I learned about textured vegetable protein and different ways to use it. So when January 1st came around, we were armed with knowledge and ready to start. \n\nAs a single dad, I have to keep a close watch on my budget. My grocery budget is pretty tight since I\u2019m feeding 5 people on one income. Because of that, we rarely have a \u201ctraditional\u201d American plate with a meat, starch, and veg. Our meals are generally light on animal based proteins anyway but it\u2019s still a significant amount of money every month. But I found my local grocery store regularly has specials on firm and extra firm tofu (like, two 8-Oz packs for $5 usually). I also found a 16 oz bag of TVP for $4.50. Even just using it three nights a week, that was a significant reduction in my weekly grocery bill. \n\nWell...three nights a week quickly turned into 6 nights. We were having different curry dishes (Penang, red, yellow, green...), 4 bean chili, baked ziti, and so much more. Tons of fresh vegetables, lots of leafy greens, rich sauces...and the smells! Oh my, the house smells so good with all the new spices! And, my two young sons never complained about missing meat and have even asked if we can have some of the tofu and TVP based dishes again. \n\nSo after one month my wallet is heavier, waist is smaller, and nobody feels like they are missing out on anything. My daughter has started cooking more and spending time with me in the kitchen. And all of my kids have seen that I will support them and help them reach their goals however I can. \n\nI don\u2019t know what the point of this post is but I wanted to share with someone!

{"title": "UPDATE: Three weeks ago, I decided to go vegetarian to impress a girl and honestly, it's changing my life.", "selftext": " \n\nSo when I wrote my original post, I was three weeks into my vegetarian change. I was over the moon because I\u2019d never felt better, but I felt a bit guilty because I was worried that trying to bag some crumpet\\* was an unethical reason to stop eating things with a face.\n\nWell. The community was so encouraging. I learned that not eating sentient beings was a perfectly acceptable way to impress a girl. And that you can cook Tofu in many interesting ways. I\u2019m really glad I posted, and I thought I\u2019d update on the girl and some things that I\u2019ve learned during my swift change from jerk chicken to jack fruit.\n\nMeat substitutes can be great but straying away from them makes you a better cook, quicker. Enjoy the new foods and flavours (I\u2019m sad that I will never be able to try dhal for the first time again).\n\nI quit smoking and went veggie in the same week. Seriously the savings on meat are incredible. \n\nThe big one for me was being able to explore how awful some farming practices are. I won\u2019t ever push my views, but when I was actively part of the meat consumption process I wasn\u2019t unable to fully admit how bad some things are because that would have made me a bit of a hypocrite.\n\nI\u2019ve shared the experience with kind, sensible, non-judgy friends who I know will not judge me for falling off the waggon should that happen, but who will not sneer when I tell them I\u2019m a new veggie. That\u2019s been helpful. \n\nAnd the girl was impressed enough to go out with me and we\u2019re still dating and it\u2019s going well. I\u2019m super excited \u2013 we\u2019re making a veggie lasagne tomorrow.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Thanks for all the encouragement.\n\n\\*Bagging crumpet is an old British term for \u2018trying to impress a girl\u2019, which I heard and found funny.\n\nEdit: it seems that \u2018bagging crumpet\u2019 actually means \u2018knocking boots\u2019.

Meat doesn't even register as food to me. \n\nNot too long ago, I used to be a scumbag about 'white people jumping on a fad', and called people out for not switching earlier, and was smug and hoity-toity about being 'the OG vegetarian'. I've been reading a lot of posts here, and they have opened my eyes a lot. Now I feel that people who _voluntarily_ choose to give up a large part of their lifestyles and open themselves up to ridicule and mockery from friends, family, etc have more spunk than I'd ever have; I'm considering going _vegan_, and I can't even give up dairy. I never really understood the demand for 'meat-like' substitutes like Beyond, Impossible, Omni, etc, but now I do. \n\nIt is difficult enough going vegetarian in some parts of Asia, where it is a fairly large subculture _already_; it must honestly be Herculean when your entire food menu is *just* meat, or something that _could_ be vegetarian suddenly has bacon pieces in it, or chicken/beef stock. A _lot_ of Western dishes sort of revolve around 'big chunk of meat and sides', which mean they can't really be made vegetarian as easily as much Asian food can, and it kind of explains the recipe demographics here. It's also very interesting to read how much your experiences as vegetarians parallels mine, with the being-made-fun-of and the 'just try it once, it can't hurt, it tastes great' and all that. \n\nFor my part, I'm gonna start sharing more recipes and pictures from my part of the world, and help people adopt vegetarianism more.\n\nThanks :)\n\n___\n\n**EDIT:**\nFor those who asked, I uploaded a recipe for a family favourite [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/nxggc4/black_nightshade_and_tamarind_stew_%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B3_%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%A4/); do take a look!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/nx9qoj/ive_been_vegetarian_all_my_life_and_i_think/", "created_utc": 1623395092.0, "score": 1054, "author": "delta_p_delta_x", "num_comments": 140, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/nx9qoj/ive_been_vegetarian_all_my_life_and_i_think/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Why do people get so aggressive and offended when they find out I don\u2019t eat meat?", "selftext": "Last year I decided to cut meat out of my diet completely. On occasion, I will eat certain types of seafood but I have been perfectly happy with my otherwise vegetarian diet. I\u2019ve been quiet about it, I never really announced it to anyone and I never straight out tell anyone about it unless a situation comes up where it\u2019s helpful for them to know, or a relevant conversation. I\u2019ve never tried to convince anyone else to stop eating meat and never comment on anyone else\u2019s dietary choices. So I\u2019ve realized when people \u201cfind out\u201d, they act very strangely.\n\nFor example, my manager at work the other day offered me a small piece of steak to try. I told him no thank you, and he insisted and then asked why when I (nicely) refused again. I said, \u201cWell I actually don\u2019t eat meat anymore, not sure if you knew.\u201d He asked why and I just said \u201cFor health and ethical considerations I guess.\u201d He immediately told me he recently went to a steakhouse and ordered the biggest, juiciest steak on the menu and ate it all, grinning ear to ear and squinting at me. I thought this was a bizarre response. Like.... okay??? Are you trying to show me up or something? Why is that response necessary?\n\nThis is just one example as to how multiple people in my life have responded to finding out I don\u2019t eat meat. Other responses (almost verbatim) from friends, coworkers, and even my own family include: \u201c\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna stick with that forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t suddenly craving *chicken nuggets*?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know it doesn\u2019t make a difference what you do, right? You\u2019re not saving any animals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m never gonna stop eating meat I don\u2019t care what anyone says.\u201d\n\n\u201cSucks for you, more steak for me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI could watch videos from slaughterhouses and eat a big ol\u2019 steak right after.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re one of *those*.\u201d \n\nALL I SAID WAS I JUST DON\u2019T EAT MEAT! What the fuck? I never once shoved it down anyone\u2019s throat or said so without context. Most people who know me don\u2019t even find out for months. Why such negative, snarky and aggressive comments? Why try throw in my face that you\u2019re gonna eat a big juicy steak? I don\u2019t give a shit? And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m seeking praise or anything, just an \u201coh ok\u201d would be fine. I think only one or two people have actually been like, \u201cOh that\u2019s cool, you do you.\u201d \n\nIf I was going around being obnoxious and preachy that\u2019s one thing. But I keep it to myself so I guess I just wasn\u2019t expecting people to get so personally offended and pissy when they find out. I\u2019m surprised and disappointed by these reactions. \n\nIs this common or am just surrounded by asshats? Stories welcome.

A few days ago I commented the [I had no intention of trying these,](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/b3da4t/mcdonalds_launches_vegan_nuggets_in_norway/eiyzlbh/) but after realizing it was just Norway getting these, I thought I might as well give it a go, if for no other reason than for the people who want to try them but can't.\n\nSo turns out they're actually pretty good. Better than I expected after seeing the promotional pictures with the whole peas and corn in them. I think I expected either poor spicing, or a bad texture, but neither was a problem. They're spiced vaguely like falafel almost, and the mix of peas, corn, carrot, potato, and onion works really well. It's much softer than a normal chicken nugget, having the consistency of thick mashed potatoes (which makes sense, that's what they are at their base), but the breading is a lot thicker and crispier and makes up for it. The breading itself is awesome.\n\nI tried them alone, with bbq sauce, hot, and room temp. They are really tasty hot and with no sauce. They don't do great with sauce, at least the bbq, too many competing flavors going on. Room temp they are *really* bland.\n\nOne thing that stands out about them is just how filling they are. Way more filling than the normal mcnuggets. Now if only they cost less (9 piece was ~$8) and didn't use the same fry oil as the chili cheese \"tops\", they might have something good here. I won't be having them again, but that's just because there are better vegan nugget options here. Hopefully they roll this out worldwide so people can have more late night fried garbage options.\n\nPictures:\n\n[The nuggets.](https://i.imgur.com/cI6Uzxo.jpg) There were 9, but I ate one on the bus home right after leaving the store.

In the invitation to the lunch they made it very clear there would be \"vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options available\". Then, in the confirmation AND the reminder email, the same phrase was repeated. I think cool, free lunch.\n\nWe get to the lunch and it's a buffet line with barbequed pork sausages, fried chicken wings, vegetables roasted in butter, and a caesar salad with eggs and ham tossed in.\n\nI had been to one of these before where they had veggie sausages on the bbq separate from the rest, so I (being lacto-ovo) grab some roast veggies and make up a sausage bun and head to the barbeque with my vegan friend. Our conversation with the BBQ guy went like this:\n\nMe: Hi is this where we can get a veggie sausage or something?\nBBQ guy: There are vegetables and a salad over there for you.\nMe: But there is ham in the salad.\nVegan friend: and cheese, and eggs, and the veggies were roasted in butter.\nBBQ guy: shrugs, \"you can pick it out\", goes back to grilling.\n\nSo I eat my sad little plate of veggies, can't even get more because the buffet line has been demolished at this point (free food at a University...).\n\nMy vegan friend who knows the organizer goes to him, points out how many people have empty plates and sad faces, and says there were supposed to be \"vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options\". Organizer realizes his mistake and orders some veggie pizzas to be delivered. We wait 45 minutes for the pizzas, and when they arrive, the organizer makes it very clear these pizzas are for the veggies who haven't eaten yet.\n\nMy friend and I, who like vultures were circling the buffet line waiting for the pizzas to show, manage to grab a couple small pieces of pizza each before the other students ravage the pizza as well. And then, what pissed me off more than anything, a girl grabbed a slice of vegan pizza (fake cheese and all that), takes a bite, says \"this is disgusting\" and throws it in the garbage. Meanwhile there are actual vegans behind her who would have happily eaten that!!!\n\nThis is a school that prides itself on sustainability, and half the students at the event are doing Master's degrees IN SUSTAINABILITY. Did you not think there would be a large vegan/veg population in that demographic? And after you assured us 3 times there would be enough food, you didn't actually plan for it?\n\nEnd rant.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/clewvu/mini_rant_vegan_and_vegetarian_options_available/", "created_utc": 1564808346.0, "score": 914, "author": "bomberblonde", "num_comments": 82, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/clewvu/mini_rant_vegan_and_vegetarian_options_available/", "html_title": ""}

Management would be ordering a ham and a few sides (mashed potatoes, salad, bread) for the dinner, and everything else would be a potluck, where everyone on the staff can contribute whatever they like.\n\nMy coworkers are all aware that I'm a vegetarian.  And when the menu was announced I think I made a joke about not being able to eat the ham.  But I felt like mashed potatoes, salad, bread, and the desserts others signed up to bring would still be plenty for me.\n\nWithout me even having to ask for more vegetarian options, some of my other coworkers brought:\n\n1.  An extra large pizza, which was half vegetarian\n2. One coworker's moms made enchiladas for him to bring, and she made 4 vegetarian enchiladas for me.\n3. Chile rellenos \n4. Rice and beans\n5. Roasted butternut squash \n6. Chips and hummus\n7.  A kale salad\n\nThe only potluck item I couldn't have was a chicken salad someone made.

{"title": "About vegetarianism and veganism", "selftext": "A few days a go, [we updated our rules in Veggit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/wiki/rules). We have done so in order to make this community more welcoming and friendly to (lacto)-(ovo)-vegetarians. Vegans on Reddit have many communities, and some of those are much larger than [r/vegetarian](https://old.reddit.com/r/vegetarian). Our new rules have confused some people, mainly outside of our own community, so I\u2019d like to talk about what differentiates vegetarianism from veganism.\n\n**Vegetarianism** is a *diet*. It excludes eating the flesh of animals, but it may include consumption of eggs, dairy, and animal byproducts. There are a myriad of reasons why someone may choose a vegetarian diet. Health, environment, culture, religion, ethics, animal welfare, etc. People who don\u2019t eat animals, eggs, dairy, or animal byproducts follow a \u2018strict vegetarian\u2019 or \u2018plant-based\u2019 diet. 90% of the world\u2019s vegetarians live in South Asia; they are lacto-vegetarians.\n\n**Veganism** is a recent, Western *ideology* which seeks to abolish animal exploitation by humans. One of the logical effects of living a vegan lifestyle is adhering to a plant-based diet (\u2018strict vegetarian\u2019). Vegans may also refrain from buying products made of materials that came from animals (leather, silk, wool, etc). They may refrain from using products that have been tested on animals. They may also choose not to have pets or service animals. Because of their ideology, it\u2019s encouraged that they try to spread the word and convert others to veganism.\n\nIn the context of evangelism, vegetarians are a natural group for vegans to engage with. Vegetarians are conscious of the food they eat and where it comes from. Many vegans believe that vegetarians chose their diet solely because of animal welfare. That\u2019s why they feel the need to show how the egg and dairy industries are not animal-friendly. They assume that vegetarians do not know about it and if they would only press hard enough, vegetarians will eventually become vegan activists.\n\nFrom a vegan point of view, all of this is completely logical and warranted. But at [r/vegetarian](https://old.reddit.com/r/vegetarian), we would like to have a community that embraces the diversity of people who keep to a vegetarian diet, and to be a place where anyone can go who is interested in eating more vegetarian foods. This includes people who eat meat, flexitarians, pescatarians, people who eat shellfish, lacto-ovo-vegatarians, lacto-vegetarians, etc.\n\nWe understand that refraining from eating meat is a personal choice and one that can be made because of many different reasons. We don\u2019t shame anyone for their diet and we won\u2019t allow anyone to shame yours either.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/a6gilr/about_vegetarianism_and_veganism/", "created_utc": 1544891627.0, "score": 872, "author": "sumpuran", "num_comments": 397, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/a6gilr/about_vegetarianism_and_veganism/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Is vegetarian cooking really that hard?", "selftext": "Background and overview: I saw some earlier posts with similar queries, but not quite the same.\n\nMany people seem to struggle to cook vegetarian meals, at least speaking from an American in a white family. So, is it really that hard, and how can we make it more approachable?\n\nGeneral context: I've been vegetarian for about 16 years now, and I like cooking. I learned to cook from a former chef while interning at a retreat center and have also worked at multiple soup kitchens, but otherwise I am not trained and have mostly been a home cook, including with a non-vegetarian girlfriend for a time who enjoyed my food. Similarly, people at the retreat center and soup kitchens also enjoyed my food to the point that I have trained other people and overseen meals for 30+ people countless times. \n\nI currently live with my parents due to their health issues and wanting to help out  They are  both in their 70s and have some diet issues, but nothing major (low sodium and low potassium, mainly). They are both retired. \n\nMain context: My parents for dinner typically make some sort of boiled vegetable, regardless of season, like asparagus in December; a grilled protein, usually a fish or chicken, but sometimes pork or beef; and a starch, often potato (usually instant and not real) or steamed corn on the cob (again, it is winter). So, it is the typical protein-veg-starch trifecta. They also generally have a grocery-store-style salad, which consist of iceberg lettuce, sometimes romaine lettuce, and an assortment of other vegetables like cucumber, celery, and tasteless radish. I usually eat the salad with added stuff like chick peas, seeds, a solid dressing, etc. \n\nI have cooked for them before, and every time, they have eaten and complimented it, and I always offer to cook for them again. But they never do. \n\nMain practical question: Is vegetarian cooking really that difficult to do or appreciate? \n\nSecond practical question: How to make it less weird and more acceptable to non-vegetarian folks? \n\nMore emo question: How to communicate how much a family's inability to cook family meals more inclusively really hurts? \n\nEdit: Adding that I apologize for this length and the TL;DR is something along the lines of how do you live with older family who don't understand not eating meat.

Sharing my cheap, simple, quick, versatile meal prep.", "selftext": "\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nPreamble - Who is this post for, what's it all about. I have lost track of the amount of times that I have had a friend or acquaintance tell me that they would love to go vegetarian if it wasn't for some combination of the following factors: price, time in the kitchen, or boring food. If you hang around vegetarian or plant biased food communities you will often see similar comments from people who are just adapting to a new way of eating and organizing their diets. As someone who has been eating mostly plants for almost the entirety of my adult life I have learned that sometimes these are legit objections and sometimes just stuff people say to self soothe if the thought of eating meat makes them uncomfortable. I am not going to sway people who don't actually want to adopt this diet but if it ends up being helpful to a few folks anyways that would be super gratifying.\n\nI want to add to the above with the following disclaimers. I am not a professional chef, I don't have the luxury of a test kitchen to develop meals or a team of fellow cooks to help me taste test and modify techniques. I'm just a man in his 30's who grew up cooking for his family, and now cooks (most) all of his meals at home with his wife. I think this is a tasty meal. I don't think it's going to win any culinary awards or change anyone's life in terms of flavor. The point of this is to have something that I can throw together in an hour and know that at any point in the next week or so ***I am never more than 2 minutes away from a nutritious and good tasting meal.***\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe meal is very simple. Oven Roasted veggies served over rice/lentils/leafy greens. That's it. If you are an experienced cook that's all you probably need to know. Roast a fat tray of whatever you want. Make some kind of base however you want, portion it into Glasslock/Tupperware/reusable containers and leave it in the fridge.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nWhy is it?\n\nRoasting is a technique that allows you to prepare a large amount of food at a given time. As opposed to steaming, roasting will also char, caramelize, and crisp your veggies. This allows them to develop more complex flavors and textures. Roasting is also a highly versatile technique. It works well with a huge amount of veggies and proteins all at the same time. By roasting you can have Brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, and tofu all on the same tray cooking at the same time and ending up well cooked without any extra effort. The most important part of this 'recipe' is that it's so easy to change week to week so you don't have to worry about falling into a rut. Just by the produce that appeals to you most at the store or go with what's on sale/seasonal/available from your garden. Even if you are on a restricted diet due to preferences/health concerns you can change the spices week to week! Roasting is also forgiving. Timer goes off while you are changing a load of laundry? Leave it for 5 more minutes. Maybe your potatoes dry out a bit but you can just add some sauce later!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nStep-By-Step\n\nStep 0: Preheat the oven\n\nPreheat to 400\\*f.\n\nStep 1: Set Up\n\nArguably the most important part of this process. In professional kitchens this is what is called Mise En Place, a French phrase that means 'putting in place' or 'set up'. Ask any professional chef how they manage a busy dinner rush when you get overwhelmed cooking at home and mise will be a top answer. If you want to be efficient take the time to organize your area, gather everything you need and clean!\n\nThe most important part of my mise is making sure I am not running around for anything during a specific task. I live in a small loft so there is not a huge amount of space to cover, still minimizing this running around is going to make you way more focused and far more efficient! The key ways that I do it in this set up are 1. having all of my ingredients close by so I can grab the next veg without leaving the 'chopping station', 2. CRUCIAL: Keeping my compost bin within arms reach. A clean station is a fast station, you will need to clean it all anyways so it's better to not lose time working around scraps and just deal with it ASAP, 3. Cutting Board right next to the pan where everything is gonna get roasted, again this helps me keep my board clear so I can just keep chopping. Once something is cut up I can move it from the board to the sheet and then just get right to the next bit of prep.\n\n[veggies, bin, sheet pan](https://preview.redd.it/zfooj17bl5le1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91a5549c07d6f24f9e3c894c94450d46dbacfc13)\n\nStep 2: Chopping OMG so much chopping. This is probably the most skill intensive part of this process. I promise you that if you chop a lot you will get faster and more accurate. If you want to go a level above you can work on your knife skills specifically. There are \"correct\" ways to chop and I promise you they are safer and faster. That being said some people just wanna cook to eat so use whatever knife you want and use it however you want. I'm gonna add some pictures of stuff that I do that makes chopping quicker and more consistent for me, some of this is controversial so if you hate it just chill, keep chopping peppers the way you like. \n\n[Wherever possible see how much stuff you can stack without it rolling all over the place. Why chop carrots 4 times when you can chop 4 carrots at once. Just tuck your fingers back when holding stuff in place \\(like a bear claw\\) so you don't make your meal non-veggie with some accidental surgery.](https://preview.redd.it/ec3vzohhm5le1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fbe8b093780ea8ffd762928f5e10168cbfa8a4a)\n\n[Keep trying new stuff! A few years ago I started flipping my cauliflower over and slicing from the bottom this lets me get beautiful, intact florets with minimal waste. Is it optimal? IDK but I like it.](https://preview.redd.it/8st5twlzm5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f77675303ecdba78bf77e41179af111a962fb7)\n\n[With bell peppers you can make 4 easy cuts like this and end up with rectangles that are easy to stack and cut very uniformly.  The top comes free and is easy to compost!](https://preview.redd.it/ktnm56vin5le1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a3e5fd33ba6f3307c2a9576c8a0bbf3b9fd543f)\n\nThe only things that I would keep in mind is that for your more delicate (simply the softer the veggie the more delicate) you want to cut them a little bigger (like not smaller than a thumbnail square) or they have a chance to burn a bit!\n\nStep 3: Season\n\nEvery tray that I do starts with the same two ingredients. 1. An oil (I use Grapeseed or Avocado Oil you can use olive, veggie, canola) 2. Apple Cider Vinegar. This is the only part of the recipe that is going to be potentially controversial. I know oils have become a big issue recently in some communities. If you want to avoid them please continue to make the choices that you feel are best for your heath. Just use whatever substitute that you prefer we are adding fat to the pan as it helps things cook better and helps with flavor. I tend to splash the whole tray with the oil and vinegar and then mix it with my hands. Each chunk of veggie should have a thin coating and at the end so should your hands. If you are dripping in oil you probably added to much oil, if your hands feel clean or any of the veggies are dry then you you could use more or you added too much vinegar. Regardless its not a big deal just remember and fix it next time you make the meal.\n\n[Splash it on!](https://preview.redd.it/q0b8bkqwp5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1711a47de2614bdb7c431865841dcc73c8cfbe6)\n\nOnce you have your veggies on the tray and \\* moist \\* its time to add your seasonings. At this point you take over. Add whatever you like! Please go shopping at the grocery store and grab any spice mix you like. This is the beauty of the recipie/technique whatever you choose here your meals will be completely different. Taco seasoning will make it taste mexican, next week you can go curry! This week I am not feeling well so I wanted something a little more simple. I used my 'everything' mix - Salt, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Paprika, Black Pepper. Always add salt unless its in your pre-mixed seasoning blend!\n\n[I get spice blends from a local slice merchant. Its expensive, indulgent, but DELICIOUS. Please use whatever you have on hand!](https://preview.redd.it/gen79ikqq5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86726017584dfd28727bea59ec19b4304f0d500d)\n\nTip on adding spices. How do you find out if you have added enough? Taste it! The biggest advantage to veggie/vegan cooking is that our ingredients are safe (and tasty) raw. I probably had like 3 chunks of broccoli while spicing this tray to get everything all tasking perfect!\n\nStep 4: Roast\n\nSimply place the tray in the oven for 45 mins. While its cooking you will have more than enough time to tidy. I don't know your oven so maybe check at 35, and 40 minutes. When it comes out it should look something like this!\n\n[Yum!](https://preview.redd.it/6yvrhjuis5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b4c9a48d405c6de6f9b84a172cf5bf9a371342f)\n\n  \nStep 5: Serve/Store\n\nScoop this over whatever you want. I tend to like rice as its easy to make and adds some caloric content. When I have been more focused on athletics I have also served it over lentils! If I am feeling like a bit more effort I'll make a beans and rice dish and serve it with that. \n\nYou also have a chance here to customize the meal again. Feel free to add any sauce that you think you might like from the fridge at this point. Favorites of mine are siracha, sweet baby rays, and truffle oil. This re-heats well for meals and can become a great lunch prep.

Pick any thing from that list in any combination and you will have a good tasing meal. Meat eaters eat the same 3 things for most every meal: chicken, beef, pork.

{"title": "Banana Blossoms and Chips", "selftext": "Hi All! Sharing a vegetarian recipe - banana blossoms and chips. If you guys might be familiar, banana blossoms are one of the substitutes for the fish texture, and sometimes vegetarian restaurants will serve them as mock fish and chips. Here is my recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n-banana blossoms\n- 50g corn starch (helps achieve crisper texture)\n- 115g plain flour\n- 1 - 1.5 tsp baking powder (gives the batter the puffiness to be crisp and not doughy)\n- Salt to taste\n- \u2060250ml very cold sparkling water (the carbonation creates air bubbles to make the batter light and crispy. Reason for \u201cvery cold\u201d is because colder water holds the gas bubbles better. I usually put the can in the freezer for 15-30mins. If you like a doughier batter use normal water.)\n\nOptional:\n- garlic and onion powder\n- \u2060kombu powder or seaweed powder (blend dried seaweed in a food processor) - gives the \u201cocean taste\u201d \n\nSteps:\n1. Clean the banana blossoms thoroughly by soaking in diluted lemon juice for 15min to remove any sap (which will cause bitterness aftertaste) between the petals.\n2. Dry them and coat them in some plain flour.\n3. For the batter, mix all the dry ingredients (corn starch, plain flour, baking powder, other seasonings) together, then whisk in cold carbonated water slowly.\n4. Dip floured blossoms in batter and deep fry till golden brown!\n5. For the chips, I just used russet potatoes and a triple cooking method (parboil, then double fry) :)\n\nCheers!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ht9syz", "created_utc": 1735978146.0, "score": 318, "author": "Efficient-Affect823", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1ht9syz/banana_blossoms_and_chips/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

{"title": "Great introductory kit of birria", "selftext": "Context: I've been dying to try birria tacos since they went viral ~2021 I think? But everywhere I looked, it was all beef or beef products. Barely any restaurants near me that catered birria to vegetarian folks. I decided to look up the vegetarian recipe and well....it was way more complex and a lot of work than I could put honestly.\n\nLast week, I came across this kit at ShopRite, now I don't know if these have been here for a while or not because I don't shop here often but I grabbed a pack to check the ingredients and it's all vegetarian. Great! I bought two packs of two king oyster mushrooms, cooked them as per instructions on the back except the cook time ( which is just ~10 mins) for these mushrooms and voila, I had these amazing birria tacos ready in about 30 mins total.\n\n This is my first introduction to the flavors of birria and I'm not complaining.

{"title": "Is vegetarian cooking really that hard?", "selftext": "Background and overview: I saw some earlier posts with similar queries, but not quite the same.\n\nMany people seem to struggle to cook vegetarian meals, at least speaking from an American in a white family. So, is it really that hard, and how can we make it more approachable?\n\nGeneral context: I've been vegetarian for about 16 years now, and I like cooking. I learned to cook from a former chef while interning at a retreat center and have also worked at multiple soup kitchens, but otherwise I am not trained and have mostly been a home cook, including with a non-vegetarian girlfriend for a time who enjoyed my food. Similarly, people at the retreat center and soup kitchens also enjoyed my food to the point that I have trained other people and overseen meals for 30+ people countless times. \n\nI currently live with my parents due to their health issues and wanting to help out  They are  both in their 70s and have some diet issues, but nothing major (low sodium and low potassium, mainly). They are both retired. \n\nMain context: My parents for dinner typically make some sort of boiled vegetable, regardless of season, like asparagus in December; a grilled protein, usually a fish or chicken, but sometimes pork or beef; and a starch, often potato (usually instant and not real) or steamed corn on the cob (again, it is winter). So, it is the typical protein-veg-starch trifecta. They also generally have a grocery-store-style salad, which consist of iceberg lettuce, sometimes romaine lettuce, and an assortment of other vegetables like cucumber, celery, and tasteless radish. I usually eat the salad with added stuff like chick peas, seeds, a solid dressing, etc. \n\nI have cooked for them before, and every time, they have eaten and complimented it, and I always offer to cook for them again. But they never do. \n\nMain practical question: Is vegetarian cooking really that difficult to do or appreciate? \n\nSecond practical question: How to make it less weird and more acceptable to non-vegetarian folks? \n\nMore emo question: How to communicate how much a family's inability to cook family meals more inclusively really hurts? \n\nEdit: Adding that I apologize for this length and the TL;DR is something along the lines of how do you live with older family who don't understand not eating meat.

It is absolutely insane to get. I went to 3 locations and they were all sold out. I'm talking about within minutes of checking on the app and driving there it sells out. Finally at the 3rd location I overheard a worker say they are rationing them so each day of the week can have enough to be sold. I begged a manager at the 3rd location I went to to get one because I already spent an hour going to 3 locations and she was a saint and put one in for me.\n\nIt's pretty damn good. The outside has enough crunch to give a good bite to it, the inside reminds me of a Dr.Praegers burger a little with a kind of falafel/aloo patty vibe. Well seasoned, balanced. I think even non vegetarians who like falafel IMHO and want something healthier will get this no problem. \n\nBefore having it I was kind of bummed it isn't a fake meat burger, but after having it I'm actually happier because enough places have fake soy meat options, so having something new to me is better since it tastes great. I like the impossible burger at BK but it's 1200 calories and I can't have it all the time. I felt less guilty eating it and felt great after, it's very fresh tasting doesn't weigh you down.

Sharing my cheap, simple, quick, versatile meal prep.", "selftext": "\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nPreamble - Who is this post for, what's it all about. I have lost track of the amount of times that I have had a friend or acquaintance tell me that they would love to go vegetarian if it wasn't for some combination of the following factors: price, time in the kitchen, or boring food. If you hang around vegetarian or plant biased food communities you will often see similar comments from people who are just adapting to a new way of eating and organizing their diets. As someone who has been eating mostly plants for almost the entirety of my adult life I have learned that sometimes these are legit objections and sometimes just stuff people say to self soothe if the thought of eating meat makes them uncomfortable. I am not going to sway people who don't actually want to adopt this diet but if it ends up being helpful to a few folks anyways that would be super gratifying.\n\nI want to add to the above with the following disclaimers. I am not a professional chef, I don't have the luxury of a test kitchen to develop meals or a team of fellow cooks to help me taste test and modify techniques. I'm just a man in his 30's who grew up cooking for his family, and now cooks (most) all of his meals at home with his wife. I think this is a tasty meal. I don't think it's going to win any culinary awards or change anyone's life in terms of flavor. The point of this is to have something that I can throw together in an hour and know that at any point in the next week or so ***I am never more than 2 minutes away from a nutritious and good tasting meal.***\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe meal is very simple. Oven Roasted veggies served over rice/lentils/leafy greens. That's it. If you are an experienced cook that's all you probably need to know. Roast a fat tray of whatever you want. Make some kind of base however you want, portion it into Glasslock/Tupperware/reusable containers and leave it in the fridge.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nWhy is it?\n\nRoasting is a technique that allows you to prepare a large amount of food at a given time. As opposed to steaming, roasting will also char, caramelize, and crisp your veggies. This allows them to develop more complex flavors and textures. Roasting is also a highly versatile technique. It works well with a huge amount of veggies and proteins all at the same time. By roasting you can have Brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, and tofu all on the same tray cooking at the same time and ending up well cooked without any extra effort. The most important part of this 'recipe' is that it's so easy to change week to week so you don't have to worry about falling into a rut. Just by the produce that appeals to you most at the store or go with what's on sale/seasonal/available from your garden. Even if you are on a restricted diet due to preferences/health concerns you can change the spices week to week! Roasting is also forgiving. Timer goes off while you are changing a load of laundry? Leave it for 5 more minutes. Maybe your potatoes dry out a bit but you can just add some sauce later!\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nStep-By-Step\n\nStep 0: Preheat the oven\n\nPreheat to 400\\*f.\n\nStep 1: Set Up\n\nArguably the most important part of this process. In professional kitchens this is what is called Mise En Place, a French phrase that means 'putting in place' or 'set up'. Ask any professional chef how they manage a busy dinner rush when you get overwhelmed cooking at home and mise will be a top answer. If you want to be efficient take the time to organize your area, gather everything you need and clean!\n\nThe most important part of my mise is making sure I am not running around for anything during a specific task. I live in a small loft so there is not a huge amount of space to cover, still minimizing this running around is going to make you way more focused and far more efficient! The key ways that I do it in this set up are 1. having all of my ingredients close by so I can grab the next veg without leaving the 'chopping station', 2. CRUCIAL: Keeping my compost bin within arms reach. A clean station is a fast station, you will need to clean it all anyways so it's better to not lose time working around scraps and just deal with it ASAP, 3. Cutting Board right next to the pan where everything is gonna get roasted, again this helps me keep my board clear so I can just keep chopping. Once something is cut up I can move it from the board to the sheet and then just get right to the next bit of prep.\n\n[veggies, bin, sheet pan](https://preview.redd.it/zfooj17bl5le1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91a5549c07d6f24f9e3c894c94450d46dbacfc13)\n\nStep 2: Chopping OMG so much chopping. This is probably the most skill intensive part of this process. I promise you that if you chop a lot you will get faster and more accurate. If you want to go a level above you can work on your knife skills specifically. There are \"correct\" ways to chop and I promise you they are safer and faster. That being said some people just wanna cook to eat so use whatever knife you want and use it however you want. I'm gonna add some pictures of stuff that I do that makes chopping quicker and more consistent for me, some of this is controversial so if you hate it just chill, keep chopping peppers the way you like. \n\n[Wherever possible see how much stuff you can stack without it rolling all over the place. Why chop carrots 4 times when you can chop 4 carrots at once. Just tuck your fingers back when holding stuff in place \\(like a bear claw\\) so you don't make your meal non-veggie with some accidental surgery.](https://preview.redd.it/ec3vzohhm5le1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fbe8b093780ea8ffd762928f5e10168cbfa8a4a)\n\n[Keep trying new stuff! A few years ago I started flipping my cauliflower over and slicing from the bottom this lets me get beautiful, intact florets with minimal waste. Is it optimal? IDK but I like it.](https://preview.redd.it/8st5twlzm5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f77675303ecdba78bf77e41179af111a962fb7)\n\n[With bell peppers you can make 4 easy cuts like this and end up with rectangles that are easy to stack and cut very uniformly.  The top comes free and is easy to compost!](https://preview.redd.it/ktnm56vin5le1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a3e5fd33ba6f3307c2a9576c8a0bbf3b9fd543f)\n\nThe only things that I would keep in mind is that for your more delicate (simply the softer the veggie the more delicate) you want to cut them a little bigger (like not smaller than a thumbnail square) or they have a chance to burn a bit!\n\nStep 3: Season\n\nEvery tray that I do starts with the same two ingredients. 1. An oil (I use Grapeseed or Avocado Oil you can use olive, veggie, canola) 2. Apple Cider Vinegar. This is the only part of the recipe that is going to be potentially controversial. I know oils have become a big issue recently in some communities. If you want to avoid them please continue to make the choices that you feel are best for your heath. Just use whatever substitute that you prefer we are adding fat to the pan as it helps things cook better and helps with flavor. I tend to splash the whole tray with the oil and vinegar and then mix it with my hands. Each chunk of veggie should have a thin coating and at the end so should your hands. If you are dripping in oil you probably added to much oil, if your hands feel clean or any of the veggies are dry then you you could use more or you added too much vinegar. Regardless its not a big deal just remember and fix it next time you make the meal.\n\n[Splash it on!](https://preview.redd.it/q0b8bkqwp5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1711a47de2614bdb7c431865841dcc73c8cfbe6)\n\nOnce you have your veggies on the tray and \\* moist \\* its time to add your seasonings. At this point you take over. Add whatever you like! Please go shopping at the grocery store and grab any spice mix you like. This is the beauty of the recipie/technique whatever you choose here your meals will be completely different. Taco seasoning will make it taste mexican, next week you can go curry! This week I am not feeling well so I wanted something a little more simple. I used my 'everything' mix - Salt, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Paprika, Black Pepper. Always add salt unless its in your pre-mixed seasoning blend!\n\n[I get spice blends from a local slice merchant. Its expensive, indulgent, but DELICIOUS. Please use whatever you have on hand!](https://preview.redd.it/gen79ikqq5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86726017584dfd28727bea59ec19b4304f0d500d)\n\nTip on adding spices. How do you find out if you have added enough? Taste it! The biggest advantage to veggie/vegan cooking is that our ingredients are safe (and tasty) raw. I probably had like 3 chunks of broccoli while spicing this tray to get everything all tasking perfect!\n\nStep 4: Roast\n\nSimply place the tray in the oven for 45 mins. While its cooking you will have more than enough time to tidy. I don't know your oven so maybe check at 35, and 40 minutes. When it comes out it should look something like this!\n\n[Yum!](https://preview.redd.it/6yvrhjuis5le1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b4c9a48d405c6de6f9b84a172cf5bf9a371342f)\n\n  \nStep 5: Serve/Store\n\nScoop this over whatever you want. I tend to like rice as its easy to make and adds some caloric content. When I have been more focused on athletics I have also served it over lentils! If I am feeling like a bit more effort I'll make a beans and rice dish and serve it with that. \n\nYou also have a chance here to customize the meal again. Feel free to add any sauce that you think you might like from the fridge at this point. Favorites of mine are siracha, sweet baby rays, and truffle oil. This re-heats well for meals and can become a great lunch prep. My wife is omnivorous and for her meals she normally just takes some of this prep and cut of meat for her choosing.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nIf you are truly a noob here are some ingredients that I think work well. If they have a \\* after them I include them in more than 90% of my preps: Onion (prefer red)\\*, Garlic\\*, Potatoes\\*, butternut squash, cauliflower, Broccoli, sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, poblano peppers, anaheim peppers, bell peppers, carrots\\*, celery, yams, tofu\\*, tempeh. Pick any thing from that list in any combination and you will have a good tasing meal. Meat eaters eat the same 3 things for most every meal: chicken, beef, pork. We can absolutely mog them with variety, branch out and try new stuff!\n\nTotal prep time today: 15 mins (including set up, washing produce, peeling squash, taking photos)  \nTotal Clean Up: 2 mins  \nTotal Cook Time: 45 mins  \nPacking into lunch kits: 10 mins\n\nTotal Active Time: 27 mins  \nTime from start to completed: 1hr 15 mins\n\nIt took twice as long to type this explanation as it took total time to cook!\n\nIf you are new I could see doubling the time to prep and pack meals so budget 30 mins for prep if you have a tight schedule or kiddos that need supervising. \n\nHappy to answer any questions that you all might have. :)\n\n\\-Digitallightweight!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1ixenst/addressing_on_of_biggest_annoyances_with_the/", "created_utc": 1740435231.0, "score": 37, "author": "digitallightweight", "num_comments": 12, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1ixenst/addressing_on_of_biggest_annoyances_with_the/", "html_title": ""}

Some pasta dishes where beans are the second though, a lot of tortilla/tacos with bean additions, sure, but what else is there.\nBasically I am looking for options where you don't add too many carbs into the meal but focus on the protein, in this case, the beans and maybe even make more meals out of it than one.

{"title": "Banana Blossoms and Chips", "selftext": "Hi All! Sharing a vegetarian recipe - banana blossoms and chips. If you guys might be familiar, banana blossoms are one of the substitutes for the fish texture, and sometimes vegetarian restaurants will serve them as mock fish and chips. Here is my recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n-banana blossoms\n- 50g corn starch (helps achieve crisper texture)\n- 115g plain flour\n- 1 - 1.5 tsp baking powder (gives the batter the puffiness to be crisp and not doughy)\n- Salt to taste\n- \u2060250ml very cold sparkling water (the carbonation creates air bubbles to make the batter light and crispy. Reason for \u201cvery cold\u201d is because colder water holds the gas bubbles better. I usually put the can in the freezer for 15-30mins. If you like a doughier batter use normal water.)\n\nOptional:\n- garlic and onion powder\n- \u2060kombu powder or seaweed powder (blend dried seaweed in a food processor) - gives the \u201cocean taste\u201d \n\nSteps:\n1. Clean the banana blossoms thoroughly by soaking in diluted lemon juice for 15min to remove any sap (which will cause bitterness aftertaste) between the petals.\n2. Dry them and coat them in some plain flour.\n3. For the batter, mix all the dry ingredients (corn starch, plain flour, baking powder, other seasonings) together, then whisk in cold carbonated water slowly.\n4. Dip floured blossoms in batter and deep fry till golden brown!\n5. For the chips, I just used russet potatoes and a triple cooking method (parboil, then double fry) :)\n\nCheers!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ht9syz", "created_utc": 1735978146.0, "score": 319, "author": "Efficient-Affect823", "num_comments": 23, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1ht9syz/banana_blossoms_and_chips/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Bean and Shroom Burger", "selftext": "I made a kidney bean and baby bella mushroom burger on homemade buns with what I had in my kitchen. The pictured burgers have tomatoes, spinach, white onion, and cheddar. I made some sriracha mayo as I had it in the fridge and it was good on it. I served it with a homemade bourbon lime and orange-ade with some mint served on frozen berries in place of the ice I didn't have.\n\nThe pattie is vegan, the buns are not vegan, but you could sub for a vegan bun recipe, or buy your preferred buns and save some time and energy.\n\nI'm very happy with how the recipe came out. I'd change what is pictured, by getting some ketchup and pickles. Beyond this incarnation above, I want to try a more mushroom forward portobella and black bean burger with some aioli, arugala, melty blue cheese (maybe gorgonzola), tomatoes, and pickled red onions which would use an altered recipe to the one below. The pattie recipe can very easily be changed around to meet your tastes and desired dish.\n\nRecipes are below.\n\nEquipment I used:\n- mixing bowl and wooden spoon\n- cookie sheet\n- oven and stove\n- cutting board and knife\n- cast iron pan and spatula\n- vegetable oil for cooking both\n- measuring cups and spoons\n\nBean and Shroom Burger: (vegan)\n\n- 1 can of beans, I used kidney, will try with black\n- mushrooms in equal volume to the beans, I used babybella\n- oats, I used about the same amount as the other two but add conscious of its role in holding the mixture together, making it less wet, and adding some texture\n- seasoning, I used salt (non negotiable), black pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder\n\n1. Chop the mushrooms roughly, smash some of the beans, and add all together with the oats, but be conservative with the oats. \n\n2. Chop the ingredients into the pattie mix. There should still be little bits and pieces of the ingredients visible, not a homogeneous paste, but it should hold together, nor be bean mush. Lean on the side of bean mush texture to start with and add the chopped oats to absorb moisture. I chopped with a knife on a cutting board, but you could use a food processor if you have one.\n\n3. Season to taste! Mix in your spices. Actually taste it! All of this is edible as is, so eat some!\n\n4. Shape the patties. I got 6 about 3-4\" round patties. Find a size and shape you like, you can always reshape. Chill patties for immediate use or freeze for later.\n\n5. Cook the patties in an oiled pan. Cast iron works great. I did about 4 minutes on each side, until browned and some charring on the oats. I added cheese to mine on the second side.\n\nThe burgers will be fairly soft, though the oats give it some more bite than just the beans and shrooms would. They do get some crispier bits from contact with the pan which is a nice texture. I really like mushrooms, and I think that the mushrooms could have been more forward as in the dressed burger, the kidney beans come through well, but the shrooms, not so much. I might try with some rehydrated dried mushrooms as they can be really flavor packed, and the liquid reserved for soup. I could still pick out the shroom flavor, but more subtle than I'd like.\n\n\nBuns (not vegan, just vegetarian):\n- AP flour, started with 400g, ended up having to add a good amount\n- 1 cup water\n- 3 tbsp melted butter\n- 1 egg\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 2 tbsp sugar\n- packet of yeast\n\n1. Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.\n\n2. Make a crater in the flour and add water and melted butter, then the beaten egg. If your eggs are huge, reserve a bit for brushing on the buns. Don't let the hot butter start cooking your egg. \n\n3. Mix in the bowl until it holds together, then turn out on a floured surface. Knead until it can clear the surface, and fairly smooth. It should not be sticking massively to your hands, you can add some flour bit by bit if it is.\n\n4. Divide into desired size, I got 8 bun of the size picture above roughly 3-4\". Roll in to balls. I like to flatten the balls, and pull the edges together giving a smoother top, and smooth out the bottom by placing the side with the edges on the crease between my hands (held out like an open book slightly angled up). Then move the hands in opposite directions back and forth. Or just roll them into balls, they'll still beat the store bought ones.\n\n5. Place on an oiled cookie sheet and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel to rest. Probably 30 minutes is enough.\n\n6. Brush with egg, I used a fork. You could add sesame seeds, but I didn't have any in the kitchen. Be careful not to punch down the dough.\n\n7. Bake at 350 about 12-13 minutes, until the domes are good and golden brown.\n\n8. Transfer to a rack and eat when cooled.\n\nI was quite pleased with the buns, I based it off of some similar recipes I found online, though subbed out water and some added butter for the recommended milk which I didn't have. I'd like some sesame seeds for them. They had a good taste and texture and toasted up nicely.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fwutnx", "created_utc": 1728147168.0, "score": 401, "author": "Whole_Bandicoot2081", "num_comments": 11, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1fwutnx/bean_and_shroom_burger/", "html_title": ""}

Crack the eggs into a bowl and add salt, chilly flakes, and black pepper. Beat well.\n\n2. Heat the oil in a cast iron skillet, and pour the eggs in.\n\n3. When the eggs are semi-set, arrange the sliced mushrooms over one half of the omelette, and optionally sprinkle some salt and pepper over the mushrooms at this stage.\n\n4. Fold over the other half of the omelette onto this half and allow it to cook through. Remove onto plate.\n\n\n\nSalad:\n\n\n\n- 1 large tomato - chopped roughly into eighths\n\n- Handful of fresh spinach - hand torn\n\n- 1tsp extra virgin olive oil\n\n- Juice from half a medium sized lemon\n\n- Salt - to taste\n\n- Dried mixed herbs - optional\n\n\n\n1. Beat the olive oil and lemon juice together with a fork vigorously to form an opaque coloured dressing.\n\n2. Add salt and herbs directly into the dressing. Stir together.\n\n3. Mix the chopped tomato and spinach together and pour the salad dressing over them.\n\n4. Mix gently by hand and make sure the vegetables are sufficiently coated with the dressing.\n\n5. Use a fork or salad spoon to transfer the salad out of the mixing bowl onto a serving plate. Leave the leftover dressing in the bowl.\n\n\n\nSprouted kala chana:\n\n- Kala chana (also known as bengal gram) sprouts\n\n- Salt\n\n- Leftover dressing from salad\n\n\n\n1. Boil the sprouts in sufficient water with salt, until they are chewable, about 10 minutes.\n\n2. Strain them out and allow them to cool.\n\n3. Once cooled, add them to the same salad bowl and coat them with the leftover lemon and olive oil dressing. Ready to serve as-is.\n\n\n\nGarlic saut\u00e9ed spinach:\n\n- Neutral cooking oil- 1tsp\n\n- Garlic - 3 or 4 cloves chopped small\n\n- Spinach - 1 bunch chopped small\n\n- Whole dried red chilies - 2 OR Red chilly flakes, 1/4th tsp\n\n- Salt to taste\n\n\n\n1. Warm the oil in a wok or deep skillet, and fry the garlic. Add the whole red chillies at this stage if they are being used.\n\n2. Once the garlic is fragrant (10-20 seconds) add all the spinach into the pan. Give the pan a good stir so that the garlic is no longer at the bottom on the pan, reducing any chances of it burning.\n\n3. Let the spinach cook for about 12 minutes, stirring every few minutes. At the halfway point you may add red chilly flakes if whole dried red chillies were not used.\n\n4. The spinach will halve or even quarter in volume by the time it\u2019s fully cooked.\n\n5.

I posted a few days ago asking for help for making some vegetarian sausage rolls (I was later told by an American friend that they\u2019re called pigs in a blanket) for my date. I got a lot of very helpful advice and tips that I put to use with great success! \nI hereby present my vegetarian pigs in a blanket recipe! \n\nMakes 10.\n\nThe sausages:\n- 5 Vevia vegetarian sausages (or any sausages that doesn\u2019t disintegrate when boiled)  \n- About 4-5 dl water\n- A cube of vegetable bouillon\n- A teaspoon MSG\n- A dash of white vinegar \n- Salt and pepper \n\nThe pastry: \n- 50 grams of butter\n- 0.5 dl buttermilk \n- 1.4 dl water\n- 15 grams of yeast\n- Half an egg\n- A tablespoon of sugar\n- Less than half a teaspoon salt\n- 345 grams all purpose flour \n\nBefore baking:\n- The other half of the egg \n- Sesame seeds\n\n\n1. Cut the sausages in half and poke holes with a fork in them so the stock could absorb into them better.\n2. Mix water, bouillon, vinegar, msg, salt and pepper together in a pot and bring it to a boil.\n3. Throw the sausage in a let them simmer while making the pastry.\n4. In another pot melt the butter then pour in the water and buttermilk.\n5. Add the water/buttermilk mixture to a stand mixer, but it should be no hotter than 37 degrees or you\u2019ll kill the yeast that you will also add now. \n6. When fully incorporated with the yeast add the sugar, salt and egg. \n7. Sift the flour. This step is unnecessary but I like how smooth the dough becomes.\n8. Little by little add the flour until the dough is firm and smooth yet still a little sticky. \n9. Lightly flour a smooth surface (I have a silicone mat I use) then pour the dough onto it. \n10. Knead and roll the dough flat then cut out small pieces with either a pizza cutter, knife, ect. \n11. If you want ketchup you can lightly brush a layer on half the dough (otherwise they are difficult to close) \n12. Then roll up the sausages and put on a baking tray. \n13. Cover them all with a damp towel once done and let rise for 1.5-2 hours.\n14. 5-10 minutes  before they\u2019re done rising, preheat the oven to 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F)\n15. When done rising brush the egg on top of the pastry and sprinkle some sesame seeds on top.\n16. Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes and viola! \n\nI am super appreciative of all the help I got to perfect the recipe and they were received very well by my date, who was flabbergasted by getting a whole bag of them haha. I am unsure about Americas imperial measurements, so you might need to do that yourself, otherwise I will maybe edit it later to  translate it all. Last note I use a convection oven which uses fan heat, but according to google not all Americans has a convection oven so I lowered the temperature since for fan heat it\u2019s supposed to be 200\u00b0C or about 392\u00b0F. \nThanks again everyone!!\n", "url": "https://i.redd.it/kje982v8xppd1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1726730818.0, "score": 280, "author": "AyaDolly", "num_comments": 16, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1fkf6nc/vegetarian_pigs_in_a_blanketala_reddit/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Chili Tacos", "selftext": "I made these kind of birria taco inspired chili tacos with my vegetarian chili, flour tortillas, and cheese. I've already posted both recipes on an earlier post (I make them both at least once a week) and it's linked in a comment below. When I have access to masa harina, I'd do them with corn tortillas, but these were really good. I think they'd also be better served with crema. It comes together pretty quick with the chili and tortillas done ahead of time and can liven up eating the same pot of chili for a few days straight.\n\n\nChili tacos:\n\nIngredients:\n-Chili (my chili has whole beans in it, so it doesn't have the small chunks of some. With thicker chilis your consome may not be as thin and sauce-like and your filling runny)\n-Tortillas (preferably corn though flour were used here)\n-Cheese that melts well (cheddar was used above)\n-Garnishes (onion, cilantro, lime, pickled red onions,  jalape\u00f1os)\n-Sauces (crema, salsa de aguacate, whatever sounds good)\n\n1. Cook chili or reheat on the stove. If reheating, add some water to get back moisture and even have it on the runny side. The consome will be that cooking liquid so it is important its not too thick. The chili can be cooked down further afterwards.\n\n2. Dip tortillas in the chili directly or in cooking liquid taken aside. Cover both sides in the liquid.\n\n3. Add cheese to one half of the tortilla so it can be easily folded, then a bit less chili than would cover the half, draining some of the moisture back into the pot (a wooden spoon and ladle works well), then a bit more cheese. \n\n4. Move the tortilla to a hot griddle and fold in half. Cook until it has some char and crispiness. Flip and so the same. I find flipping about the fold mitigates slipping. Press the taco with the spatula.\n\n5. Serve with some of the cooking liquid from the chili, and desired garnishes and sauces (at least lime, onion, and cilantro).

{"title": "Different types of tofu", "selftext": "I saw someone ask a question about tofu on this sub, and I know that outside of Asia, most tofu is the firm or solid kind.  I'm from Asia, been vegetarian 15 years and tbh the only reason I could be vegetarian is because of tofu. So I'd like to share all the different kinds of tofu and tofu related products we get in Asia and hopefully you can find in an Asian supermarket near you. If you don't like tofu, one of these is bound to change your mind (and my money is on tofu pok!) -sorry if this already exists somewhere in this sub- \n\n1. Firm tofu - this is normal tofu. It's not very firm and not very soft, it is amazing when fried so the skin becomes crispy. Good for virtually any dish. Super easy to crumble as well.\n\n2. Extra firm tofu - this is the one I see most people in the West using. People usually press this so that the texture becomes less moist and you can tear it apart to resemble chicken. Many people also freeze this because it then becomes a little spongy when you cook it. This tofu is also great to marinate and use as tofu steaks or fry like chicken. \n\n3. Japanese pressed tofu - this tofu is pretty soft in texture. It comes in a tray, you flip the whole block out of the tray and slice it up. Usually great in ramen and soups. Miso soup with this tofu is the best. \n\n4. Soft/smooth/silken tofu - this tofu is suuuuper soft. Like, you need precision so you don't break it. It also comes in a tray with water, you slit the plastic at the top and plop the tofu out directly in whatever you want to cook it in. This tofu is perfect for steaming - just place it in a bowl, pour some soy sauce, vegetarian oyster sauce, garlic, ginger, red chilli and spring onions over it and steam away. People also like using this tofu to blend and create sauces as a replacement for cream. \n\n5. Egg tofu - for the ovo-vegetarians out there. This tofu comes in a plastic tube and is yellowish. You slice it and deep fry it, really good for sizzling dishes or with soy sauce. Nice with noodles too. // Note that you can also get smooth, eggless tofu in a tube, that's more white and says silken tofu or smooth tofu instead of egg tofu. \n\n6. Tofu pok / deep fried tofu puffs - my absolute favourite tofu in the world. This tofu is spongy, and when you cut it in half you can see that it's porous inside. So it's great to absorb things - therefore great in soups, ramen, curries. You can also fill it with things and deep fry it for a snack. \n\n7. Seasoned tofu - this tofu is already fried and seasoned. There are different kinds, eg. Five spice tofu, seaweed tofu. You can just cut them up and use them straight away. Great for stir fries, noodles or fried rice. \n\n8. Tofu skin/ fuzhuk - this is another one of my favourites and it comes in different varieties. These are the skins removed from heating soy milk and dried. You can sometimes also get them fresh. You can do lots with these - usually tear it up and cook it in curries or soups, or you can soak them for a while, then fill them, roll them and fry them. You can also marinate and pan fry them like bacon.  These skins also come in rolls or sticks which are good for soup. \n\nThere are more, but these are the most popular ones. Happy trying all the different kinds of tofu and the millions of things you can do with them, everyone!

Recipe below. You can also roast the radishes if you're short on time or sensitive to how much oil it takes to confit.\n\n* 1 sheet of puff pastry\n* 6 radishes with healthy greens intact\n* Olive oil, to confit the radishes\n* 1 c. ricotta\n* Zest and juice from 1 lemon\n* 1/2 tsp salt\n* Sprinkle of freshly cracked pepper\n* Sprinkle of capers\n* Honey for drizzling\n* Optional: a handful of fresh herbs\n\nInstructions:\n\nPreheat your oven to 300.\n\nIf the leaves of your radishes are beautiful, I recommend leaving them on. Thoroughly wash your radishes and slice them in half, lengthwise. Put in a shallow dish and pour in olive oil until they\u2019re just covered. Add salt and pepper.\n\nBake at 300 for 1-1.5 hours- this will vary based on the size of your radishes. At the 1 hour mark, check the radishes for doneness. A fork will easily go through them when done!\n\nWhile your radishes are cooking, get your puff pastry out of the freezer and let thaw.\n\nMix 1 c. ricotta with lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Reserve the lemon juice for the end. Set aside.\n\nPull the radishes out of the oil and set on a paper towel. Be sure to dab the leaves to soak up excess oil. Keep the oil for salad dressings, or cooking vegetables. It will have a beautiful earthy flavor from the radishes.\n\nTurn up the oven to 400 degrees.\n\nLay out a thawed puff pastry. If you know how to reliably produce puff pastry from scratch, do that, but I\u2019m an inexperienced baker and opt for the premade pastry.\n\nCreate a small crust by folding the pastry over itself just on the edges.\n\nSpread the ricotta mixture on the pastry, and then arrange the radishes. Cook the pastry for 14-16 minutes in the oven, until the pastry is browned and risen.\n\nAdd capers, honey, lemon juice, and fresh herbs if you so desire. Slice and enjoy!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgia4uwoxqad1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f2ae86509e723e7dee12a9c4d3dead50c57f557\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1dw5bcv/confit_radish_tart_with_lemon_and_ricotta/", "created_utc": 1720205313.0, "score": 27, "author": "jackiaveli", "num_comments": 5, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1dw5bcv/confit_radish_tart_with_lemon_and_ricotta/", "html_title": ""}
{"title": "Help me find what this food was!", "selftext": "In the 1970s, I went to a daycare run by Seventh Day Adventists.  They fed us lunch, and they made this one dish I absolutely loved.  For those that don't know, SDAs tend to follow a vegetarian diet, so I suspect this meal was vegetarian.  I always referred to it as \"macaroni and green beef\" (I was 4-5).  It consisted of pasta, something the consistency of hamburger, and it was all tinted a kind of olive/sage green color.  Hence my name for it.  I'm wondering if anyone knows \"vintage\" vegetarian recipes and might have some clue as to what this could have been.  Vegetarian/Vegan food options today are so much more expansive, which has made it hard to search for something like this.  Plus, it's pretty simple and vague.\n\nIt's been bugging me for years, I really want to scratch that nostalgia itch from my childhood.  Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe food basically consisted of two ingredients -- 1) mixed pasta (macaroni, pinwheels, etc) like you'd see used to make kids art projects at the time.  Color not consistent with spinach pasta (too pale), but more the color it would be if you cooked it in some sort of broth of that color.  2) spongy, hamburger-like substance that many suggests might have been \"TVP\", which fits the time period.  3) If I had to mention a third, there was a little bit of a clear, greenish broth (not enough to be called soup, but also not a sauce), with maybe some visible green flakes/particles no larger than dried parsley.\n\nAgain, this was food made for preschoolers at a not-fancy daycare in the 1970s.

I only have random and probably unhelpful details about it, but she\u2019s determined to find it so I figured this sub was worth a shot. \n\n1. It is not the vegetarian epicure. I own the first and second editions and she swears it is neither. \n\n2. It has no pictures, drawn or photographed. \n\n3. It apparently has a really bangin recipe for a noodle kugel, and an exceptional brown bread recipe. Note, this is not a canned Boston brown bread vibe, more of a whole wheat, molasses, oaty situation. \n\n4. Possibly the least helpful bit of information I\u2019ve gleaned is that it was a paperback that was a bit too thick to be a paperback. Also by the time she received this particular cookbook it no longer had a front cover, so I have no earthly idea what the cover art looked like.

This is the only thing being served as far as I know, so my usual tactic of just making a meal of vegetarian sides does not apply.

I spoke with the host, and I\u2019m going to bring a small vegetarian version (the dish is pho for those who were wondering) as well as some vegetarian spring rolls to share with everyone!

That\u2019s with living in a city! Everything here has SOME kind of meat or gelatin, often in the form of chicken stock if not slathered on top of whatever dish. Everything I grew up eating had meat. I\u2019ve always found myself confined to my own kitchen, which is fine\u2026 if you never want to leave your house.\n\nIn both London and Berlin there wasn\u2019t just numerous options available at every corner, but they weren\u2019t nearly as expensive as I\u2019m used to. I could hop on public transportation and get anything I wanted. I could roll up to Starbucks and get a vegan spicy chicken wrap. On the plane they offered a vegetarian meal included in the ticket price! Every restaurant had something, and it wasn\u2019t just salads or fries. It was main meals, numerous options for vegan meats and vegetarian foods.\n\nWhere I live, it\u2019s a lucky day if my college even bothers to remember some people don\u2019t eat meat. Salad bar or nothing. A side of fries or nothing. Vegan chicken? Twice as expensive at Walmart, and if you want something small from the gas station you have to pick up every single item and read it to see the ingredients because very VERY few things list themselves as vegetarian.

{"title": "Miso aubergine congee style risotto ", "selftext": "Our home has been gripped with sickness so I tried to think of the most comforting thing imaginable. Warm mush came to mind. There's a reason rice porridge and miso soup are considered healing elixirs so I decided to combine the two by making a fusion miso aubergine risotto congee.\n\nI used two aubergines. I cut one into chunks that I tossed in oil with salt and pepper but also kept two halves intact so I could roast them with a chilli soy miso glaze. The glaze consisted of 50g miso paste, 40ml soy sauce, a tablespoon of sugar, a tablespoon of honey (feel free to omit) and a teaspoon of sambal oelek. The chunks went straight into a 220c convection oven for twenty minutes. I halved and scored the intact aubergine and fried in oil for 4 minutes a side in a pan before adding the glaze and allowing to thicken. I put these in their own roasting dish, topped with the glaze and tented with foil and allowed to roast for about 30 minutes. I took the foil off with 10 minutes left. No one likes medium rare eggplant so test with a fork.\n\nFor the risotto congee I sauteed the whites from a bunch of spring onion, two cloves of garlic and a knob of ginger before adding a cup of arborio rice. Instead of wine, I used three tablespoons rice wine vinegar. The stock was a combo of stock and miso paste which I blanched a chopped head of bok choy into to maintain its texture. I added it a ladle at a time until the rice was done and I reached my desired consistency. Usually it's about a litre of stock for a traditional risotto but I added more liquid until I reached a more porridgy consistency. The rice is very forgiving.\n\nSince it was still risotto I finished it with a load of parmesan (feel free to use your cheese of choice) with the roasted aubergine chunks and bok choy, I garnished it with chilli crisp (I use Lao Gan Ma), the green of the spring onion and I topped it with the aubergine half and toasted sesame seeds.\n\nIt was spicy to clear sinuses, full of umami so we could actually taste it and it felt like a very warm hug.", "url": "https://i.redd.it/gkt3rn4zy6nc1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1709939141.0, "score": 182, "author": "Typical_Use788", "num_comments": 7, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1ba27ww/miso_aubergine_congee_style_risotto/", "html_title": ""}

I can\u2019t even fathom eating meat anymore and I\u2019m happy to live according to my principles instead of in cognitive dissonance. \ud83d\udc9a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1b3h1ei/vegetarian_for_a_little_over_a_year/", "created_utc": 1709254730.0, "score": 93, "author": "alolanalice10", "num_comments": 8, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1b3h1ei/vegetarian_for_a_little_over_a_year/", "html_title": "Reddit - The heart of the internet"}

I feel like I must have stumbled upon either an error, or an insanely good vegetable based protein source for a very low whole food calorie per gram of protein ratio.\n\nIn doing my research sprouting did show to improve the calorie per gram of protein ratio in foods. Some more than others. \n\nBut what I can\u2019t figure it is what makes the kidney bean so special in this regard. \n\nHere were my findings using USDA database as my source and a 100 gram food serving as my base measurement. I took the total calories in the serving of foods and divided it by the grams of protein in the serving to get the calories per gram of protein ratio. If high protein is what you seek then the lower this number is the better. Each gram of protein is 4 calories meaning the absolute perfect ratio for any given food is 4 calories per gram of protein and that food would be 100% protein. \n\nLentils saw an 8.6% protein content improvement. Soybeans saw a 1.4% improvement but it should be noted their ratio was already significantly better. But kidney beans shined here with a 52.8% improvement!\n\nIt\u2019s been bothering me not knowing if this is just an error in their database or a literal protein power house. At 6.87 calories per gram of protein for a boiled sprouted kidney bean, if accurate, that would mean this food is a whopping 58% protein.\n\nI know that fermenting beans in the process of making tempeh improves the nutritional makeup of the food in other aspects outside of protein content (see the comparison of tempeh to non sprouted soybeans in the table which is virtual unchanged).\n\nBut if the sprouted kidney bean datapoint is accurate I am wanting to sprout some kidney beans, pressure cook them to remove toxins, cool the sprouts and inoculate with tempeh starter and make some sprouted kidney bean tempeh. \n\nDoes anyone have any input on this?\n\nI\u2019m kind of obsessing over this so I felt the need to get it out there. \n\nThanks for reading!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/n84yynh7dshc1.jpeg", "created_utc": 1707583082.0, "score": 23, "author": "improvingiskey", "num_comments": 4, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/1ankbmd/sprouted_kidney_bean_tempeh/", "html_title": ""}

Lay tofu pieces on one half of a clean, lint-free kitchen towel. Fold over the other half of the towel and gently press to remove excess liquid. Leave the tofu to drain for at least 15 minutes.\n\nIn the meantime, preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F and line a baking tray with parchment or a silicone baking mat.\n\nTransfer the pressed tofu to a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle in salt and pepper. Toss until evenly coated. Try to be gentle so that the tofu cubes or nuggets stay intact. I find using a big flexible rubber spatula helps.\n\nSprinkle the cornstarch over the seasoned tofu and once again toss until tofu is evenly coated and there's no dry cornstarch left at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nArrange the tofu on your prepared baking sheet so that the pieces aren't touching. Bake for 15 minutes and give the pieces a flip. Bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the tofu is as crispy as you like it! The time will vary a little depending on how thoroughly you pressed your tofu.\n\nYou can measure all the ingredients for your sauce directly into a nonstick skillet. Whisk together.\n\nHeat the sauce over medium-high until it begins to bubble. Then reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, for about 3-5 minutes, until sugar has dissolved fully and sauce has thickened slightly. Add an extra tablespoon or so of water as needed to thin out the sauce to your preferred consistency.\n\nWhen your tofu is done baking, transfer it to your saucepan and stir to coat.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/196tjp8/spicy_gochujang_tofu/", "created_utc": 1705274592.0, "score": 9, "author": "Intrepid_Film2632", "num_comments": 2, "permalink": "/r/vegetarian/comments/196tjp8/spicy_gochujang_tofu/", "html_title": ""}

{"title": "Anyone else notice that delivery food has become decidedly anti-vegetarian lately?", "selftext": "Just speaking from my own experiences in the past year or so, I've been ordering semi-regularly through services like Doordash, Uber Eats, etc for years and the last few months have been a nightmare as a vegetarian. To be clear, it's definitely not the fault of the drivers - restaurants just seem to be throwing us under the bus.\n\nTo be clear, the usual trope of ordering a vegetarian dish and getting something with meat in it is still a thing, but doesn't seem to be happening any more than it used to. Instead, it feels like things that used to be safe for a vegetarian just aren't anymore, and it's by design.\n\nFor example, there's one restaurant local to me that charges $1 EXTRA for their vegetarian taco option now. It is literally the same thing as a meat taco, but without the meat and with one less tortilla. $1 to remove ingredients. That doesn't even consider the fact that they have more than doubled their prices in recent years.\n\nIt seems like just about every place I order from has removed the ability to modify an order. So something like ordering a Falafel Bowl but asking for no cheese is no longer possible.\n\nTonight, my girlfriend and I ordered a Vegetable Chow Mein /w Tofu from a well regarded local Chinese restaurant. We received (literally, no exaggeration) a container of soy sauce noodles with a single piece of broccoli in the center. That one item alone was $18.\n\nWe're getting tired of complaining.

{"title": "Very little customisation options for vegetarians", "selftext": "Hello, avid UK fast food enjoyer here. I've been a vegetarian all my life (29 yo), and I've noticed in recent years there's been a better focus on vegetarians and vegans within the fast food space. \n\nAlthough these are all good things, I find that here in the UK, you'll be hard pressed to find vegetarian options amongst restaurants such as Burger King and McDonald's. There's a clear focus on catering for vegans, which is definitely a good thing, but here in UK, if you're a vegetarian, it feels as though you have to settle for vegan fast food - there's little in-between. \n\nAn example would be the McPlant burger: I enjoy these faux meat patties, but why do I have to settle for vegan cheese? Why can't I customise the item and add normal cheese? Another example would be the limited edition burgers: meat-eaters have access to fancy, elaborate, limited edition burgers; why is there no option for me to replace the beef burger with a McPlant patty? This would allow more options for vegetarians who want to try the limited edition styles/ingredients.\n\nI was feeling hungry, so I browsed Uber Eats. I settled for Burger King, as I quite like their vegan burgers. However, I encounter the same issue; no option to add normal cheese. The Burger King Uber Eats experience goes one step further, and prevents you from selecting any drink other than Caprisuns or water when you select the vegan burger meal option. Meat burgers however, allow you to select whatever soft drink you'd like. I didn't even know soft drinks such as Coke weren't vegan to be honest. Nonetheless, why can't I choose things such as Coke, Pepsi, Tango etc, simply because I don't eat meat?\n\nOften at non fast food restraunts, there's been an influx of either meat meals or vegan meals, with no catering for vegetarians. From a business perspective, I understand, because it separates what's safe for vegans from the standard meals, and saves staff time on modifying vegan meals so that they become vegetarian. The only problem for us vegetarians however, is that we have to settle for non-dairy in our meals. I don't dislike non-dairy substitutes, but I'd much rather have the real thing.\n\nI once went to a restaurant and selected their only vegan option. It was a vegetable burger with a single lettuce leaf inside - no sauce or other additions. Just because I'm a vegetarian doesn't mean I wanna eat less, or eat healthy.\n\nThings are going in the right direction in terms of catering for all types of people, and meat-alternate food is way better than what it was when I was a child (I basically had to live on cheese sandwiches growing up), but I'd really like more customisation options. Maybe add a pop up prompt whenever you add dairy to vegan items saying \"warning, adding *this item* will result in meal no longer being vegan,\" to avoid vegans accidentally adding something non-vegan to their meals. \n\nI get that this is an absolute nitpick, but it's annoying that there seems to be a strict rule in what food I have to settle for, because I rarely have a means of making vegan meals more vegetarian whilst ordering fast food. Burger King lost out on my money because I couldn't add the drink I wanted, or add cheese to my burger. If I'd bought the burger and drink separately, it would've cost me the same as a full meal, so I'd be paying meal price, but missing out on the chips (fries \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8). Instead, I gave up and went elsewhere for an old faithful cheese pizza.

To start off, I\u2019m a 26 y/o male and I\u2019ve always loved meat. Steak, bacon, pulled pork you name it. I used to scoff at people who ate that \u201crabbit food\u201d. Back in June a buddy I work with gave me some shrooms and it was an amazing experience, for the first time in my life I felt like I was one with the universe and everything in it, connected to all the animals and the cosmos. That feeling became deeply rooted in my mind since then but I guess I tried to ignore it for some reason. A few weeks ago someone I know went hunting and sent me a video of him cutting off the deers legs with a circular saw and I was completely mortified, for the first time I was uncomfortable with the idea of eating that animal. Yesterday I went to eat my lunch at work, chicken. I just couldn\u2019t stomach it and ended up not eating the meat because it felt wrong. This morning I woke up and decided it was time to go for it, something I never thought I would do. This feels like an incredibly personal choice to me and I wanted to share with people that care, instead of people with the same mindset I used to have.
